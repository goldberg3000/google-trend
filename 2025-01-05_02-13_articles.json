                "content": "Jeff Baena, the writer and director behind indie films such as The Little Hours and Horse Girl, was found dead Friday in his Los Angeles home. Married to The White Lotus star Aubrey Plaza, Baena first made his mark in Hollywood as the co-writer of David O. Russell’s 2004 movie I Heart Huckabees. He was 47. A graduate of NYU Tisch School of the Arts, Jeff Baena began his Hollywood career as a production assistant for director Robert Zemeckis (Here), then pivoted to work in the independent space. In 2011, he and Plaza started dating, and the pair became regular collaborators. Baena directed her in films including Life After Beth and 2022’s Spin Me Round. “It’s an amazing experience to work with your partner in this way,” Plaza said of her work with Baena in 2017. “I’ve worked with Jeff since his first movie. I’ve seen him evolve, and I’ve seen him grow. It’s a really special dynamic that we have. It’s challenging at times, but it’s also really rewarding to do something together.” Though he began as a writer, Baena said that directing was always his goal. “It’s all I ever want to do,” he said in a 2014 interview. “It felt really comfortable and fun. I’ve been a writer for twelve years now and it was always a means to an end, I never wanted to be a writer, I wanted to be a director so this was always my intention and it felt right.” Plaza and Baena quietly married in 2021, with the former revealing the news in an Instagram post in which she referred to Baena as “my darling husband.” In an appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show later that year, Plaza joked that the nuptials happened when “We got a little bored one night. We got married, and I’ll tell you how: Onehourmarriage.com. That’s real, look it up.” A backyard ceremony, in which the couple expressed vows in front of “a very quick love altar” adorned with “Facts of our love, little stones, smoke, fire. Things of that nature,” followed. Dispatchers sent crews to Baena’s Los Angeles home at around 10:30 a.m. yesterday, following a 911 call made (per TMZ) by Baena’s assistant. According to the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner’s Office, Baena was unresponsive, and was pronounced dead at the scene. No cause has been officially determined, officials say, and the investigation into his death remains open. However, TMZ cites unnamed sources as saying that Baena died by suicide, but that detail has not been officially confirmed as of publication time. In addition to Plaza, Baena is survived by his mother Barbara Stern and stepfather Roger Stern, his father Scott Baena and stepmother Michele Baena, his brother Brad Baena, and his stepsister and stepbrother Bianca Gabay and Jed Fluxman. As of publication time, Baena’s family has not publicly commented on his death, but Deadline reports that it “is devastated and asks for privacy at this difficult time.” If you need emotional support or are in crisis, call the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline at 988.

                "content": "Jeff Baena (June 29, 1977 – January 3, 2025)[1] was an American screenwriter and film director known for Life After Beth (2014), Joshy (2016), The Little Hours (2017), Horse Girl (2020), Spin Me Round (2022), and for co-writing I Heart Huckabees (2004).[3] He was known for his frequent collaborations with actresses Alison Brie and his wife, Aubrey Plaza. After graduating from the New York University Tisch School of the Arts with a degree in film, Baena moved to Los Angeles to pursue directing.[2] He became a production assistant for Robert Zemeckis, working on a number of films.[4] After working with Zemeckis, Baena took a job as an assistant editor for writer-director David O. Russell. After a year and a half of working together, a minor car accident injured one of Baena's eyes. Partially to keep his spirits up and pass the time during his recovery from that, Russell began discussing story ideas with Baena. The two ended up collaborating on four scripts together.[4] One of those four scripts was I Heart Huckabees, which Russell directed in 2004. At the same time, Baena began to focus his career on writing and wrote the zombie comedy Life After Beth, which would wind up being his debut feature as a director.[4] Baena had planned for Joshy to be his directorial debut, but actor and collaborator Adam Pally had to pull out for personal reasons. Baena then decided to work on Life After Beth, which he had begun writing in 2003.[3] The next film for Baena was The Little Hours, which was released in 2017. The film features actors Alison Brie, Dave Franco, Kate Micucci, Aubrey Plaza, John C. Reilly and Molly Shannon along with multiple cameos.[5] Baena's film Horse Girl, which he wrote with Alison Brie, who stars in the film, had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2020.[6] His final film, Spin Me Round, premiered in 2022.[7] Baena grew up in a secular Jewish family in Miami.[8] He had been in a relationship with actress Aubrey Plaza since 2011. They were married in 2021 on their tenth anniversary of being together in a small ceremony in their backyard.[9] Baena died on January 3, 2025, at the age of 47. An assistant discovered his body at a home in the Los Angeles area, and he was pronounced dead at the scene.[10] The cause of death was reportedly a suicide.[11] Film Television",

                "content": "By Daniel Kreps Jeff Baena, the writer-director of indie films like Life After Beth and Horse Girl and husband of actress Aubrey Plaza, has died at the age of 47. TMZ first reported that police responded to a death investigation at a Los Angeles home on Friday morning, with Baena pronounced dead at the scene. The Los Angeles County Coroner’s Office confirmed Baena’s death to Variety; no cause of death was provided. Baena started in the film industry to an assistant to directors like Robert Zemeckis and David O. Russell, with Baena co-writing the screenplay for 2004’s I Heart Huckabees with the latter. In 2014, Baena made his directorial debut with the zombie comedy Life After Beth, which starred his then-girlfriend Plaza; in 2021, the actress revealed that she and Baena had married after a decade of dating. Baena’s other films include 2016’s Joshy and three movies he made in collaboration with actress Alison Brie: 2017’s The Little Hours (which also co-starred Plaza), 2020’s Horse Girl, and his most recent feature, 2022’s Spin Me Round. “Baena, who co-wrote the script with Brie, has always been someone who throws a bit of a curve in his pitches — this is the guy who penned I Heart Huckabees, and has directed both a zombie love story (Life After Beth) and a left-field adaptation of Boccaccio’s The Decameron (The Little Hours),” Rolling Stone wrote in its review for Horse Girl. “But the longer Horse Girl lets you spend inside this young woman’s dissociative state of mind, the more you feel your own grasp on the narrative begin to fracture.” We want to hear it.

Having to contend with a long injury list and an illness which swept through the squad this week, we still produced a display full of character and commitment, with Academy graduate Brandon Austin epitomising the manner of the display with an assured and composed performance in goal on his Spurs debut at the age of 25. This was Austin’s 50th appearance in a Premier League matchday squad and his first competitive game in our colours. We took an early lead through a fine diving header from Dominic Solanke before Newcastle hit back immediately through Anthony Gordon, with Alexander Isak applying the finishing touch to a well-worked move to give the visitors the advantage going into half-time. We were the dominant team throughout most of the second half, Solanke close again with another couple of headers but we just couldn’t fashion that one chance to equalise. It was an explosive start to the game with two goals in the opening six minutes to warm everyone up on a freezing afternoon. We took the lead in the fourth minute, Solanke’s diving header from Pedro Porro’s cross beating Martin Dubravka but the visitors responded almost immediately, Gordon with an angled drive past Austin, although what seemed a clear handball from Joelinton in the build-up was cleared by VAR and the goal stood. A superb run from Brennan Johnson led to another chance for us in the 11th minute, the ball breaking for Solanke whose shot was well blocked by Sven Botman, while Austin made a smart save at the other end to keep out another Gordon effort. A big opportunity came the way of the Magpies just after the half-hour mark, Jacob Murphy’s low ball across the six-yard box touched just wide of the far post by Isak with Gordon waiting at the back post to tap home. However they did take the lead on 38 minutes, Murphy again down the right and this time his cross was diverted by Radu Dragusin onto Isak and he side-footed home from close range. The visitors were certainly having the better of the exchanges at that stage but we kept persevering with our football and Timo Werner almost got on the end of the another dangerous Pedro Porro cross as the half drew to a close. With just a one-goal deficit we were always in the game and almost levelled 10 minutes into second half, Dubravka getting down low to save Pape Matar Sarr’s shot with Johnson firing the rebound against the post from a very tight angle. At the other end, Archie Gray blocked Sandro Tonali’s fierce drive with Gordon blazing the rebound way over the bar. We made a triple change just after the hour with Heung-Min Son, James Maddison and Yves Bissouma on for Werner, Lucas Bergvall and Sarr as we searched for a way back into the game and we certainly had the upper hand for much of the second period. Maddison almost drew us level in the 82nd minute, curling just wide from a short corner before a crazy scramble in the area saw Johnson fizz the ball across the face of goal without it getting a touch before substitute Sergio Reguilon picked it up and drilled back across goal, again nobody on hand to touch it home. With 10 minutes of stoppage time added on, we continued to be the team playing the better football and Solanke was just over the bar with a looping header from Dejan Kulusevski’s cross, although Austin had to be on guard to push away a shot from Harvey Barnes at the other end. Another Solanke header brought a diving save out of Dubravka as the clock ticked down but that proved to be our last chance of the afternoon. Spurs (4-3-3): Austin, Pedro Porro, Dragusin (Reguilon 46), Gray, Spence, Bergvall (Maddison 62), Sarr (Bissouma 62), Kulusevski (c), Johnson, Solanke, Werner (Son 62).

                "title": "Barcelona - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Barcelona (/ˌbɑːrsəˈloʊnə/ ⓘ BAR-sə-LOH-nə; Catalan: [bəɾsəˈlonə] ⓘ; Spanish: [baɾθeˈlona] ⓘ) is a city on the northeastern coast of Spain. It is the capital and largest city of the autonomous community of Catalonia, as well as the second-most populous municipality of Spain. With a population of 1.6 million within city limits,[8] its urban area extends to numerous neighbouring municipalities within the province of Barcelona and is home to around 5.3 million people,[3] making it the fifth most populous urban area of the European Union after Paris, the Ruhr area, Madrid and Milan.[3] It is one of the largest metropolises on the Mediterranean Sea, located on the coast between the mouths of the rivers Llobregat and Besòs, bounded to the west by the Serra de Collserola mountain range. According to tradition, Barcelona was founded by either the Phoenicians or the Carthaginians, who had trading posts along the Catalonian coast.[9] In the Middle Ages, Barcelona became the capital of the County of Barcelona. After joining with the Kingdom of Aragon to form the confederation of the Crown of Aragon, Barcelona, which continued to be the capital of the Principality of Catalonia, became the most important city in the Crown of Aragon and the main economic and administrative centre of the Crown, only to be overtaken by Valencia, wrested from Moorish control by the Catalans, shortly before the dynastic union between the Crown of Castile and the Crown of Aragon in 1492. Barcelona became the centre of Catalan separatism, briefly becoming part of France during the 17th century Reapers' War and again in 1812 until 1814 under Napoleon. It was the capital of Revolutionary Catalonia during the Spanish Revolution of 1936, and the seat of government of the Second Spanish Republic later in the Spanish Civil War, until its capture by the fascists in 1939. After the Spanish transition to democracy in the 1970s, Barcelona once again became the capital of an autonomous Catalonia. Barcelona has a rich cultural heritage and is today an important cultural centre and a major tourist destination. Particularly renowned are the architectural works of Antoni Gaudí and Lluís Domènech i Montaner, which have been designated UNESCO World Heritage Sites. The city is home to two of the most prestigious universities in Spain: the University of Barcelona and Pompeu Fabra University. The headquarters of the Union for the Mediterranean are located in Barcelona. The city is known for hosting the 1992 Summer Olympics as well as world-class conferences and expositions. In addition, many international sport tournaments have been played here. Barcelona is a major cultural, economic, and financial centre in southwestern Europe,[10] as well as the main biotech hub in Spain.[11] As a leading world city, Barcelona's influence in global socio-economic affairs qualifies it for global city status (Beta +).[12] Barcelona is a transport hub, with the Port of Barcelona being one of Europe's principal seaports and busiest European passenger port,[13] an international airport, Barcelona–El Prat Airport, which handles over 50-million passengers per year,[14] an extensive motorway network, and a high-speed rail line with a link to France and the rest of Europe.[15] The name Barcelona comes from the ancient Iberian Baŕkeno, attested in an ancient coin inscription found on the right side of the coin in Iberian script as ,[16] in Ancient Greek sources as Βαρκινών, Barkinṓn;[17][18] and in Latin as Barcino,[19] Barcilonum[20] and Barcenona.[21][22][23] Other sources suggest that the city may have been named after the Carthaginian general Hamilcar Barca, who was supposed to have founded the city in the 3rd century BC,[9][24] but there is no evidence its name in antiquity, Barcino, was connected with the Barcid family of Hamilcar.[25] During the Middle Ages, the city was variously known as Barchinona, Barçalona, Barchelonaa, and Barchenona. An abbreviated form sometimes used by locals for the city is Barna. Barça is only applied to the local football club FC Barcelona, not to the city. Another common abbreviation is 'BCN', which is also the IATA airport code of the Barcelona-El Prat Airport. The city is referred to as the Ciutat Comtal in Catalan and Ciudad Condal in Spanish (i.e., \"Comital City\" or \"City of Counts\"), owing to its past as the seat of the Count of Barcelona.[26] The origin of the earliest settlement at the site of present-day Barcelona is unclear. The ruins of an early settlement have been found, including different tombs and dwellings dating to earlier than 5000 BC.[27][28] In Greek mythology, the founding of Barcelona had been attributed to the mythological Hercules. According to tradition, Barcelona was founded by Punic (Phoenician) settlers, who had trading posts along the Catalonian coast.[9][29][30] In particular, some historians attribute the foundation of the city directly to the historical Carthaginian general, Hamilcar Barca, father of Hannibal, who supposedly named the city Barcino after his family in the 3rd century BC,[9][31] but this theory has been questioned.[25] Archeological evidence in the form of coins from the 3rd century BC have been found on the hills at the foot of Montjuïc with the name Bárkeno written in an ancient script in the Iberian language[citation needed]. Thus, we can conclude[clarification needed] that the Laietani[citation needed], an ancient Iberian (pre-Roman) people of the Iberian peninsula, who inhabited the area occupied by the city of Barcelona around 3–2 BC[clarification needed], called the area Bàrkeno, which means \"The Place of the Plains\" (Barrke = plains/terrace).[32][better source needed] In about 15 BC, the Romans redrew the town as a castrum (Roman military camp) centred on the \"Mons Taber\", a little hill near the Generalitat (Catalan Government) and city hall buildings. The Roman Forum, at the crossing of the Cardo Maximus and Decumanus Maximus, was approximately placed where current Plaça de Sant Jaume is. Thus, the political centre of the city, Catalonia, and its domains has remained in the same place for over 2,000 years. Under the Romans, it was a colony with the surname of Faventia,[33] or, in full, Colonia Faventia Julia Augusta Pia Barcino[34] or Colonia Julia Augusta Faventia Paterna Barcino. Pomponius Mela[35] mentions it among the small towns of the district, probably as it was eclipsed by its neighbour Tarraco (modern Tarragona), but it may be gathered from later writers that it gradually grew in wealth and consequence, favoured as it was with a beautiful situation and an excellent harbour.[36] It enjoyed immunity from imperial burdens.[37] The city minted its own coins; some from the era of Galba survive. Important Roman vestiges are displayed in Plaça del Rei underground, as a part of the Barcelona City History Museum (MUHBA); the typically Roman grid plan is still visible today in the layout of the historical centre, the Barri Gòtic (Gothic Quarter). Some remaining fragments of the Roman walls have been incorporated into the cathedral.[38] The cathedral, Catedral Basílica Metropolitana de Barcelona, is also sometimes called La Seu, which simply means cathedral (and see, among other things) in Catalan.[39][40] It is said to have been founded in 343. The city was conquered by the Visigoths in the early 5th century, becoming for a few years the capital of all Hispania. After being conquered by the Umayyads in the early 8th century, it was conquered after a siege in 801 by Charlemagne's son Louis, who made Barcelona the seat of the Carolingian \"Hispanic March\" (Marca Hispanica), a buffer zone ruled by the Count of Barcelona.[41] The Counts of Barcelona became increasingly independent and expanded their territory to include much of modern Catalonia, although in 985, Barcelona was sacked by the army of Almanzor.[42] The sack was so traumatic that most of Barcelona's population was either killed or enslaved.[43] In 1137, Aragon and the County of Barcelona merged in dynastic union[44][45] by the marriage of Ramon Berenguer IV and Petronilla of Aragon, their titles finally borne by only one person when their son Alfonso II of Aragon ascended to the throne in 1162. His territories were later to be known as the Crown of Aragon, which conquered many overseas possessions and ruled the western Mediterranean Sea with outlying territories in Naples and Sicily and as far as Athens in the 13th century. Barcelona was the leading slave trade centre of the Crown of Aragon up until the 15th century, when it was eclipsed by Valencia.[46] It initially fed from eastern and Balkan slave stock later drawing from a Maghribian and, ultimately, Subsaharan pool of slaves.[47] The Bank or Taula de canvi de Barcelona, often viewed as the oldest public bank in Europe, was established by the city magistrates in 1401. It originated from necessities of the state, as did the Bank of Venice (1402) and the Bank of Genoa (1407).[48] In the beginning of the Early Modern period, Barcelona lost political primacy, but the economy managed to achieve a balance between production capacity and imports.[49] In the context of the wider early recovery of Catalonia from the 17th-century crisis in the second half of the century, increasing maritime activity since 1675 doubled traffic in the port of Barcelona compared to figures from the beginning of the 17th century.[50] In the late 17th and early 18th century, Barcelona repeatedly endured the effects of war, including the 1691 bombing, the sieges of 1697, 1704, 1705, 1706, and the 1713 blockade and ensuing 1714 siege and assault.[51] In the 18th century, the population grew from 30,000 to about 100,000 inhabitants, as the city became one of the key mercantile centres in the Western Mediterranean, with inland influence up to Zaragoza, and to the south up to Alicante.[52] A fortress was built at Montjuïc that overlooked the harbour. Much of Barcelona was negatively affected by the Napoleonic wars, but the start of industrialization saw the fortunes of the province improve. In the mid-1850s, Barcelona was struggling with population density as it became an industrial, port city and European capital. The city's density was at 856 people per hectare, more than double that of Paris. Mortality rates were on the rise and any outbreaks of disease would devastate the population. To solve the issue, a civil engineer named Ildefons Cerdà proposed a plan for a new district known as the Eixample. The citizens of Barcelona had begun to demolish the medieval wall surrounding and constricting the city. Cerdà thought it best to transform the land outside the walls into an area characterized by a scientific approach to urbanization. His proposal consisted of a grid of streets to unite the old city and surrounding villages. There would also be wide streets to allow people to breathe clean air, gardens in the centre of each street block, integration of rich and poor giving both groups access to the same services, and smooth-flowing traffic. Urban quality, egalitarianism, hygiene, sunlight, and efficiency were all major keys for Cerdà's vision. Not everything he imagined would be realized within the Eixample district, but the iconic octagonal superblocks with chamfered corners for better visibility are his direct brainchild and remain immensely helpful even 170 years later. The district and its ideals were not appreciated at the time. The city council awarded the design of the extension plan to another architect. The Spanish government was the one to step in and impose Cerdà's plan, laying the groundwork for many more tensions between the Spanish and Catalan administrations. Regardless, some of the upper class citizens of Barcelona were excited by the new plan and began a race to build \"the biggest, tallest, most attractive house\" in the district. Their interest and money fueled the rich diversity that we now see in the district's architecture. In the end, Cerdà's ideas would have a lasting impact on Barcelona's development, earning it international recognition for its highly efficient approach to urban planning and design.[53][54] During the Spanish Civil War, the city, and Catalonia in general, were resolutely Republican. Many enterprises and public services were collectivized by the CNT and UGT unions. As the power of the Republican government and the Generalitat diminished, much of the city was under the effective control of anarchist groups. The anarchists lost control of the city to their own allies, the Communists and official government troops, after the street fighting of the Barcelona May Days. The fall of the city on 26 January 1939, caused a mass exodus of civilians who fled to the French border. The resistance of Barcelona to Franco's coup d'état was to have lasting effects after the defeat of the Republican government. The autonomous institutions of Catalonia were abolished,[57] and the use of the Catalan language in public life was suppressed. Barcelona remained the second largest city in Spain, at the heart of a region which was relatively industrialized and prosperous, despite the devastation of the civil war. The result was a large-scale immigration from poorer regions of Spain (particularly Andalusia, Murcia and Galicia), which in turn led to rapid urbanization. In 1992, Barcelona hosted the Summer Olympics. The after-effects of this are credited with driving major changes in what had, up until then, been a largely industrial city. As part of the preparation for the games, industrial buildings along the sea-front were demolished and 3 km (2 mi) of beach were created. New construction increased the road capacity of the city by 17%, the sewage handling capacity by 27% and the amount of new green areas and beaches by 78%. Between 1990 and 2004, the number of hotel rooms in the city doubled. Perhaps more importantly, the outside perception of the city was changed making, by 2012, Barcelona the 12th most popular city destination in the world and the 5th amongst European cities.[58][59][60][61][62] The death of Franco in 1975 brought on a period of democratization throughout Spain. Pressure for change was particularly strong in Barcelona, which considered that it had been punished during nearly forty years of Francoism for its support of the Republican government.[63] Massive, but peaceful, demonstrations on 11 September 1977 assembled over a million people in the streets of Barcelona to call for the restoration of Catalan autonomy. It was granted less than a month later.[64] The development of Barcelona was promoted by two events in 1986: Spanish accession to the European Community, and particularly Barcelona's designation as host city of the 1992 Summer Olympics.[65][66] The process of urban regeneration has been rapid, and accompanied by a greatly increased international reputation of the city as a tourist destination. The increased cost of housing has led to a slight decline (−16.6%) in the population over the last two decades of the 20th century as many families move out into the suburbs. This decline has been reversed since 2001, as a new wave of immigration (particularly from Latin America and from Morocco) has gathered pace.[67] In 1987, an ETA car bombing at Hipercor killed 21 people. On 17 August 2017, a van was driven into pedestrians on La Rambla, killing 14 and injuring at least 100, one of whom later died. Other attacks took place elsewhere in Catalonia. The Prime Minister of Spain, Mariano Rajoy, called the attack in Barcelona a jihadist attack. Amaq News Agency attributed indirect responsibility for the attack to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).[68][69][70] During the 2010s, Barcelona became the focus city[citation needed] for the ongoing Catalan independence movement, its consequent standoff between the regional and national government and later protests.[71] In July 2023, Barcelona was announced as the UNESCO-UIA World Capital of Architecture for the 2024–2026 term. This means it will be the hub for discussion around global challenges including culture, heritage, urban planning and architecture. In addition to being the capital through 2026, it will also host the UIA World Congress of Architects for that year. The honour is befitting of Barcelona, as its history is peppered with architectural achievement and various iconic styles and influences. From its ancient Roman roots, to the Gothic and Modernisme movements, Barcelona has thrived through the way it ties together architecture and culture.[72] Barcelona is located on the northeast coast of the Iberian Peninsula, facing the Mediterranean Sea, on a plain approximately 5 km (3 mi) wide limited by the mountain range of Collserola, the Llobregat river to the southwest and the Besòs river to the north.[73] This plain covers an area of 170 km2 (66 sq mi),[73] of which 101 km2 (39.0 sq mi)[74] are occupied by the city itself. It is 120 km (75 mi) south of the Pyrenees and the Catalan border with France. Tibidabo, 512 m (1,680 ft) high, offers striking views over the city[75] and is topped by the 288.4 m (946.2 ft) Torre de Collserola, a telecommunications tower that is visible from most of the city. Barcelona is peppered with small hills, most of them urbanized, that gave their name to the neighbourhoods built upon them, such as Carmel (267 m or 876 ft), Putxet (es) (181 m or 594 ft) and Rovira (261 m or 856 ft). The escarpment of Montjuïc (173 m or 568 ft), situated to the southeast, overlooks the harbour and is topped by Montjuïc Castle, a fortress built in the 17–18th centuries to control the city as a replacement for the Ciutadella. Today, the fortress is a museum and Montjuïc is home to several sporting and cultural venues, as well as Barcelona's biggest park and gardens. The city borders on the municipalities of Santa Coloma de Gramenet and Sant Adrià de Besòs to the north; the Mediterranean Sea to the east; El Prat de Llobregat and L'Hospitalet de Llobregat to the south; and Sant Feliu de Llobregat, Sant Just Desvern, Esplugues de Llobregat, Sant Cugat del Vallès, and Montcada i Reixac to the west. The municipality includes two small sparsely-inhabited exclaves to the north-west. According to the Köppen climate classification, Barcelona has a hot summer Mediterranean climate (Csa), with mild winters and warm to hot summers,[76] while the rainiest seasons are autumn and spring. The rainfall pattern is characterized by a short (3 months) dry season in summer, as well as less winter rainfall than in a typical Mediterranean climate. However, both June and August are wetter than February, which is unusual for the Mediterranean climate. This subtype, labelled as \"Portuguese\" by the French geographer George Viers after the climate classification of Emmanuel de Martonne[77] and found in the NW Mediterranean area (e.g. Marseille), can be seen as transitional to the humid subtropical climate (Cfa) found in inland areas. Barcelona is densely populated, thus heavily influenced by the urban heat island effect. Areas outside of the urbanized districts can have as much as 2 °C of difference in temperatures throughout the year.[78] Its average annual temperature is 21.2 °C (70.2 °F) during the day and 15.1 °C (59.2 °F) at night. The average annual temperature of the sea is about 20 °C (68 °F). In the coldest month, January, the temperature typically ranges from 12 to 18 °C (54 to 64 °F) during the day, 6 to 12 °C (43 to 54 °F) at night and the average sea temperature is 13 °C (55 °F).[79] In the warmest month, August, the typical temperature ranges from 27 to 31 °C (81 to 88 °F) during the day, about 23 °C (73 °F) at night and the average sea temperature is 26 °C (79 °F).[79] Generally, the summer or \"holiday\" season lasts about six months, from May to October. Two months – April and November – are transitional; sometimes the temperature exceeds 20 °C (68 °F), with an average temperature of 18–19 °C (64–66 °F) during the day and 11–13 °C (52–55 °F) at night. December, January and February are the coldest months, with average temperatures around 15 °C (59 °F) during the day and 9 °C (48 °F) at night. Large fluctuations in temperature are rare, particularly in the summer months. Because of the proximity to the warm sea plus the urban heat island, frosts are very rare in the city of Barcelona. Snow is also very infrequent in the city of Barcelona, but light snowfalls can occur yearly in the nearby Collserola mountains, such as in the Fabra Observatory located in a nearby mountain.[80] Barcelona averages 78 rainy days per year (≥ 1 mm), and annual average relative humidity is 72%, ranging from 69% in July to 75% in October. Rainfall totals are highest in late summer and autumn (September–November) and lowest in early and mid-summer (June–August), with a secondary winter minimum (February–March). Sunshine duration is 2,524 hours per year, from 138 (average 4.5 hours of sunshine a day) in December to 310 (average 10 hours of sunshine a day) in July.[81] According to Barcelona's City Council, the city's population as of 1 January 2016[update] was 1,608,746 people,[86] on a land area of 101.4 km2 (39 sq mi). It is the main component of an administrative area of Greater Barcelona, with a population of 3,218,071 in an area of 636 km2 (246 sq mi) (density 5,060 inhabitants/km2). The population of the urban area was 4,840,000.[3] It is the central nucleus of the Barcelona metropolitan area, which relies on a population of 5,474,482.[4] In 1900, Barcelona had a population of 533,000,[73] which grew steadily but slowly until 1950, when it started absorbing a high number of people from other less-industrialized parts of Spain. Barcelona's population peaked in 1979 at 1,906,998, and fell throughout the 1980s and 1990s as more people sought a higher quality of life in outlying cities in the Barcelona Metropolitan Area. After bottoming out in 2000 with 1,496,266 residents, the city's population began to rise again as younger people started to return, causing a great increase in housing prices.[87] Spanish is the most spoken language in Barcelona (according to the linguistic census held by the Government of Catalonia in 2013) and it is understood almost universally. Catalan is also very commonly spoken in the city: it is understood by 95% of the population, while 72.3% can speak it, 79% can read it, and 53% can write it.[88] Knowledge of Catalan has increased significantly in recent decades thanks to a language immersion educational system. After Catalan and Spanish, the most spoken languages in Barcelona are those from North Africa, such as Amazigh and Arabic, followed by Bengali, Urdu, Panjabi, Mandarin Chinese, Romanian, English, Russian and Quechua, according to data collected by the University of Barcelona.[89] Barcelona is one of the most densely populated cities in Europe. For the year 2008 the city council calculated the population to 1,621,090 living in the 102.2 km2 sized municipality, giving the city an average population density of 15,926 inhabitants per square kilometre with Eixample being the most populated district.[90][full citation needed] In the case of Barcelona though, the land distribution is extremely uneven. Half of the municipality or 50.2 km2, all of it located on the municipal edge is made up of the ten least densely populated neighbourhoods containing less than 10% of the city's population, the uninhabited Zona Franca industrial area and Montjuïc forest park. Leaving the remaining 90% or slightly below 1.5 million inhabitants living on the remaining 52 km2 (20 sq mi) at an average density close to 28,500 inhabitants per square kilometre.[90][full citation needed] Of the 73 neighbourhoods in the city, 45 had a population density above 20,000 inhabitants per square kilometre with a combined population of 1,313,424 inhabitants living on 38.6 km2 at an average density of 33,987 inhabitants per square kilometre. The 30 most densely populated neighbourhoods accounted for 57.5% of the city population occupying only 22.7% of the municipality, or in other words, 936,406 people living at an average density of 40,322 inhabitants per square kilometre. The city's highest density is found at and around the neighbourhood of la Sagrada Família where four of the city's most densely populated neighbourhoods are located side by side, all with a population density above 50,000 inhabitants per square kilometre.[90][full citation needed] In 1900, almost a third (28.9 percent) of the population were children (aged younger than 14 years). In 2017, this age group constituted only 12.7% of the population. In 2017, people aged between 15 and 24 years made up 9 percent of the population; those aged between 25 and 44 years made up 30.6 percent of the population; while those aged between 45 and 64 years formed 56.9% of all Barcelonans. In 1900, people aged 65 and older made up just 6.5 percent of the population. In 2017, this age group made up 21.5 percent of the population.[91][92] In 2016, about 59% of the inhabitants of the city were born in Catalonia and 18.5% coming from the rest of the country. In addition to that, 22.5% of the population was born outside of Spain, a proportion which has more than doubled since 2001 and more than quintupled since 1996 when it was 8.6% and 3.9% respectively.[86] The most important region of origin of migrants is Europe, with many coming from Italy (26,676) or France (13,506).[86] Moreover, many migrants come from Latin American nations such as Bolivia, Ecuador or Colombia. Since the 1990s, and similar to other migrants, many Latin Americans have settled in northern parts of the city.[94] There exists a relatively large Pakistani community in Barcelona with up to twenty thousand nationals. The community consists of significantly more men than women. Many of the Pakistanis are living in Ciutat Vella. First Pakistani migrants came in the 1970s, with increasing numbers in the 1990s.[95] Other significant migrant groups come from Asia as from China and the Philippines.[86] There is a Japanese community clustered in Bonanova, Les Tres Torres, Pedralbes, and other northern neighbourhoods, and a Japanese international school serves that community.[96] In 2007, most of the inhabitants stated they are Roman Catholic (208 churches).[97] In a 2011 survey conducted by InfoCatólica, 49.5% of Barcelona residents of all ages identified themselves as Catholic.[98] This was the first time that more than half of respondents did not identify themselves as Catholic Christians.[98] The numbers reflect a broader trend in Spain whereby the numbers of self-identified Catholics have declined.[98] In 2019, a survey by Centro de Investigaciones Sociológicas showed that 53.2% of residents in Barcelona identified themselves as Catholic (9.9% practising Catholics, 43.3% non-practising Catholics).[99] The province has the largest Muslim community in Spain, 322,698 people in Barcelona province are of Muslim religion.[100] A considerable number of Muslims live in Barcelona due to immigration (169 locations, mostly professed by Moroccans in Spain).[97] In 2014, 322,698 out of 5.5 million people in the province of Barcelona identified themselves as Muslim,[100] which makes 5.6% of the total population. The city also has the largest Jewish community in Spain, with an estimated 3,500 Jews living in the city.[101] There are also a number of other groups, including Evangelical (71 locations, mostly professed by Roma), Jehovah's Witnesses (21 Kingdom Halls), Buddhists (13 locations),[102] and Eastern Orthodox.[103] The Barcelona metropolitan area comprises over 66% of the people of Catalonia, one of the richer regions in Europe and the fourth richest region per capita in Spain, with a GDP per capita amounting to €28,400 (16% more than the EU average). The greater Barcelona metropolitan area had a GDP amounting to $177 billion (equivalent to $34,821 in per capita terms, 44% more than the EU average), making it the 4th most economically powerful city by gross GDP in the European Union, and 35th in the world in 2009.[104] Barcelona city had a very high GDP of €80,894 per head in 2004, according to Eurostat.[105] Furthermore, Barcelona was Europe's fourth best business city and fastest improving European city, with growth improved by 17% per year as of 2009[update].[106] Barcelona was the 24th most \"livable city\" in the world in 2015 according to lifestyle magazine Monocle.[107] Similarly, according to Innovation Analysts 2thinknow, Barcelona occupies 13th place in the world on Innovation Cities™ Global Index.[108] At the same time it is according to the Global Wealth and Lifestyle Report 2020 one of the most affordable cities in the world for a luxury lifestyle.[109] Barcelona has a long-standing mercantile tradition. Less well known is that the city industrialized early, taking off in 1833, when Catalonia's already sophisticated textile industry began to use steam power. It became the first and most important industrial city in the Mediterranean basin. Since then, manufacturing has played a large role in its history. Borsa de Barcelona (Barcelona Stock Exchange) is the main stock exchange in the northeastern part of the Iberian Peninsula. Barcelona was recognized as the Southern European City of the Future for 2014/15, based on its economic potential,[110] by FDi Magazine in their bi-annual rankings.[111] It also has several congress halls, notably Fira de Barcelona – the second largest trade fair and exhibition centre in Europe, that host a quickly growing number of national and international events each year (at present above 50). The total exhibition floor space of Fira de Barcelona venues is 405,000 m2 (41 ha), not counting Gran Via centre on the Plaza de Europa. However, the Eurozone crisis and deep cuts in business travel affected the council's positioning of the city as a convention centre. An important business centre, the World Trade Center Barcelona, is located in Barcelona's Port Vell harbour. The city is known for hosting well as world-class conferences and expositions, including the 1888 Exposición Universal de Barcelona, the 1929 Barcelona International Exposition (Expo 1929), the 2004 Universal Forum of Cultures and the 2004 World Urban Forum.[112] Barcelona was the 20th-most-visited city in the world by international visitors and the fifth most visited city in Europe after London, Paris, Istanbul and Rome, with 5.5 million international visitors in 2011.[113] By 2015, both Prague and Milan had more international visitors.[114] With its popular tree-lined pedestrian street, Les Rambles (Las Ramblas), Barcelona is ranked the most popular city to visit in Spain.[115] Barcelona is an internationally renowned tourist destination, with numerous recreational areas, one of the best beaches in the world,[116][117] mild and warm climate, historical monuments, including eight UNESCO World Heritage Sites, 519 hotels as of March 2016[update][118] including 35 five-star hotels,[119] and developed tourist infrastructure. Due to its large influx of tourists each year, Barcelona, like many other tourism capitals, has to deal with pickpockets, with wallets and passports being commonly stolen items. Despite its moderate pickpocket rate, Barcelona is considered one of the safest cities in terms of security and personal safety,[120] mainly because of a sophisticated policing strategy that has dropped crime by 32% in just over three years and has led it to be considered the 15th safest city in the world by Business Insider in 2016.[121] While tourism produces economic benefits, according to one report,[citation needed] the city is \"overrun [by] hordes of tourists\". In early 2017, over 150,000 protesters warned that tourism is destabilizing the city. Slogans included \"Tourists go home\", \"Barcelona is not for sale\" and \"We will not be driven out\". By then, the number of visitors had increased from 1.7 million in 1990 to 32 million in a city with a population of 1.62 million, increasing the cost of rental housing for residents and overcrowding the public places. While tourists spent an estimated €30 billion in 2017, they are viewed by some as a threat to Barcelona's identity.[122] A May 2017 article in the British online daily The Independent included Barcelona among the \"Eight Places That Hate Tourists the Most\" and included a comment from Mayor Ada Colau, \"We don't want the city to become a cheap souvenir shop\", citing Venice as an example.[123] To moderate the problem, the city has stopped issuing licenses for new hotels and holiday apartments; it also fined AirBnb €30,000. The mayor has suggested introducing a new tourist tax and setting a limit on the number of visitors.[123] One industry insider, Justin Francis, founder of the Responsible Travel agency, stated that steps must be taken to limit the number of visitors that are causing an \"overtourism crisis\" in several major European cities. \"Ultimately, residents must be prioritised over tourists for housing, infrastructure and access to services because they have a long-term stake in the city's success\", he said.[124] \"Managing tourism more responsibly can help\", Francis later told a journalist, \"but some destinations may just have too many tourists, and Barcelona may be a case of that\".[125] Industry generates 21% of the total gross domestic product (GDP) of the region,[126] with the energy, chemical and metallurgy industries accounting for 47% of industrial production.[127] The Barcelona metropolitan area had 67% of the total number of industrial establishments in Catalonia as of 1997.[128] Barcelona has long been an important European automobile manufacturing centre. Formerly there were automobile factories of AFA, Abadal, Actividades Industriales, Alvarez, America, Artés de Arcos, Balandrás, Baradat-Esteve, Biscúter, J. Castro, Clúa, David, Delfín, Díaz y Grilló, Ebro trucks, Edis [ca], Elizalde, Automóviles España, Eucort, Fenix, Fábrica Hispano, Auto Academia Garriga, Fábrica Española de Automóviles Hebe, Hispano-Suiza, Huracán Motors, Talleres Hereter, Junior SL, Kapi, La Cuadra, M.A., Automóviles Matas, Motores y Motos, Nacional Custals, National Pescara, Nacional RG, Nacional Rubi, Nacional Sitjes, Automóviles Nike, Orix, Otro Ford, Patria, Pegaso, PTV, Ricart, Ricart-España, Industrias Salvador, Siata Española, Stevenson, Romagosa y Compañía, Garaje Storm, Talleres Hereter, Trimak, Automóviles Victoria, Manufacturas Mecánicas Aleu.[129][130] Today, the headquarters and a large factory of SEAT (the largest Spanish automobile manufacturer) are in one of its suburbs. There is also a Nissan factory in the logistics and industrial area of the city.[131] The factory of Derbi, a large manufacturer of motorcycles, scooters and mopeds, also lies near the city.[132] As in other modern cities, the manufacturing sector has long since been overtaken by the services sector, though it remains very important. The region's leading industries are textiles, chemical, pharmaceutical, motor, electronic, printing, logistics, publishing, in telecommunications industry and culture the notable Mobile World Congress, and information technology services. The traditional importance of textiles is reflected in Barcelona's drive to become a major fashion centre. There have been many attempts to launch Barcelona as a fashion capital, notably Gaudi Home.[citation needed] Beginning in the summer of 2000, the city hosted the Bread & Butter urban fashion fair until 2009, when its organizers announced that it would be returning to Berlin. This was a hard blow for the city as the fair brought €100 m to the city in just three days.[133][134] From 2009, The Brandery, an urban fashion show, was held in Barcelona twice a year until 2012. According to the Global Language Monitor's annual ranking of the world's top fifty fashion capitals Barcelona was named as the seventh most important fashion capital of the world right after Milan and before Berlin in 2015.[135] As the capital of the autonomous community of Catalonia, Barcelona is the seat of the Catalan government, known as the Generalitat de Catalunya; of particular note are the executive branch, the parliament, and the High Court of Justice of Catalonia. The city is also the capital of the Province of Barcelona and the Barcelonès comarca (district). Barcelona is governed by a city council formed by 41 city councillors, elected for a four-year term by universal suffrage. As one of the two biggest cities in Spain, Barcelona is subject to a special law articulated through the Carta Municipal (Municipal Law). A first version of this law was passed in 1960 and amended later, but the current version was approved in March 2006.[136] According to this law, Barcelona's city council is organized in two levels: a political one, with elected city councillors, and one executive, which administers the programs and executes the decisions taken on the political level.[137] This law also gives the local government a special relationship with the central government and it also gives the mayor wider prerogatives by the means of municipal executive commissions.[138] It expands the powers of the city council in areas like telecommunications, city traffic, road safety and public safety. It also gives a special economic regime to the city's treasury and it gives the council a veto in matters that will be decided by the central government, but that will need a favourable report from the council.[136] The Comissió de Govern (Government Commission) is the executive branch, formed by 24 councillors, led by the Mayor, with 5 lieutenant-mayors and 17 city councillors, each in charge of an area of government, and 5 non-elected councillors.[139] The plenary, formed by the 41 city councillors, has advisory, planning, regulatory, and fiscal executive functions.[140] The six Commissions del Consell Municipal (City council commissions) have executive and controlling functions in the field of their jurisdiction. They are composed by a number of councillors proportional to the number of councillors each political party has in the plenary.[141] The city council has jurisdiction in the fields of city planning, transportation, municipal taxes, public highways security through the Guàrdia Urbana (the municipal police), city maintenance, gardens, parks and environment, facilities (like schools, nurseries, sports centres, libraries, and so on), culture, sports, youth and social welfare. Some of these competencies are not exclusive, but shared with the Generalitat de Catalunya or the central Spanish government. In some fields with shared responsibility (such as public health, education or social services), there is a shared Agency or Consortium between the city and the Generalitat to plan and manage services.[142] The executive branch is led by a Chief Municipal Executive Officer which answers to the Mayor. It is made up of departments which are legally part of the city council and by separate legal entities of two types: autonomous public departments and public enterprises.[143] The seat of the city council is on the Plaça de Sant Jaume, opposite the seat of Generalitat de Catalunya. Since the coming of the Spanish democracy, Barcelona had been governed by the PSC, first with an absolute majority and later in coalition with ERC and ICV. After the May 2007 election, the ERC did not renew the coalition agreement and the PSC governed in a minority coalition with ICV as the junior partner. After 32 years, on 22 May 2011, CiU gained a plurality of seats at the municipal election, gaining 15 seats to the PSC's 11. The PP hold 8 seats, ICV 5 and ERC 2. Since 1987, the city has been divided into 10 administrative districts (districtes in Catalan, distritos in Spanish): The districts are based mostly on historical divisions, and several are former towns annexed by the city of Barcelona in the 18th and 19th centuries that still maintain their own distinct character. Each district has its own council led by a city councillor. The composition of each district council depends on the number of votes each political party had in that district, so a district can be led by a councillor from a different party than the executive council. Barcelona has a well-developed higher education system of public universities. Most prominent among these are the University of Barcelona (established in 1450) and the more modern Pompeu Fabra University.[144][145] Barcelona is also home to the Polytechnic University of Catalonia, and in the private sector the EADA Business School (founded in 1957), which became the first Barcelona institution to run manager training programmes for the business community. IESE Business School, as well as the largest private educational institution, the Ramon Llull University, which encompasses schools and institutes such as the ESADE Business School. The Autonomous University of Barcelona, another public university, is located in Bellaterra, a town in the Metropolitan Area. Toulouse Business School and the Open University of Catalonia (a private Internet-centred open university) are also based in Barcelona. The city has a network of public schools, from nurseries to high schools, under the responsibility of a consortium led by city council (though the curriculum is the responsibility of the Generalitat de Catalunya). There are also many private schools, some of them Roman Catholic. Most such schools receive a public subsidy on a per-student basis, are subject to inspection by the public authorities, and are required to follow the same curricular guidelines as public schools, though they charge tuition. Known as escoles concertades, they are distinct from schools whose funding is entirely private (escoles privades). The language of instruction at public schools and escoles concertades is Catalan, as stipulated by the 2009 Catalan Education Act. Spanish may be used as a language of instruction by teachers of Spanish literature or language, and foreign languages by teachers of those languages. An experimental partial immersion programme adopted by some schools allows for the teaching of a foreign language (English, generally) across the curriculum, though this is limited to a maximum of 30% of the school day. No public school or escola concertada in Barcelona may offer 50% or full immersion programmes in a foreign language, nor does any public school or escola concertada offer International Baccalaureate programmes. Barcelona's cultural roots go back 2000 years. Since the arrival of democracy, the Catalan language (very much repressed during the dictatorship of Franco) has been promoted, both by recovering works from the past and by stimulating the creation of new works. Barcelona is designated as a world-class city by the Globalization and World Cities Study Group and Network.[146] It has also been part of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network as a City of Literature since 2015.[147] Barcelona has many venues for live music and theatre, including the world-renowned Gran Teatre del Liceu opera house, the Teatre Nacional de Catalunya, the Teatre Lliure and the Palau de la Música Catalana concert hall. Barcelona also is home to the Barcelona Symphony and Catalonia National Orchestra (Orquestra Simfònica de Barcelona i Nacional de Catalunya, usually known as OBC), the largest symphonic orchestra in Catalonia. In 1999, the OBC inaugurated its new venue in the brand-new Auditorium (L'Auditori). It performs around 75 concerts per season and its current director is Eiji Oue.[148] It is home to the Barcelona Guitar Orchestra, directed by Sergi Vicente. The major thoroughfare of La Rambla is home to mime artists and street performers. Yearly, two major pop music festivals take place in the city, the Sónar Festival and the Primavera Sound Festival. The city also has a thriving alternative music scene, with groups such as The Pinker Tones receiving international attention.[149] Barcelona is an international hub of highly active and diverse nightlife with bars, dance bars and nightclubs staying open well past midnight.[150] El Periódico de Catalunya, La Vanguardia and Ara are Barcelona's three major daily newspapers (the first two with Catalan and Spanish editions, Ara only in Catalan) while Sport and El Mundo Deportivo (both in Spanish) are the city's two major sports daily newspapers, published by the same companies. The city is also served by a number of smaller publications such as Ara and El Punt Avui (in Catalan), by nationwide newspapers with special Barcelona editions such as El País (in Spanish, with an online version in Catalan) and El Mundo (in Spanish), and by several free newspapers like 20 minutos and Què (all bilingual). Barcelona's oldest and main online newspaper VilaWeb is also the oldest one in Europe[citation needed] (with Catalan and English editions). Several major FM stations include Catalunya Ràdio, RAC 1, RAC 105 and Cadena SER. Barcelona also has a local TV station, Betevé, owned by city council. The headquarters of Televisió de Catalunya, Catalonia's public network, are located in Sant Joan Despí, in Barcelona's metropolitan area. Barcelona has a long sporting tradition and hosted the highly successful 1992 Summer Olympics as well as several matches during the 1982 FIFA World Cup (at the two stadiums). It has hosted about 30 sports events of international significance.[citation needed] FC Barcelona is a sports club best known worldwide for its football team, one of the largest and the wealthiest in the world.[151] It has 74 national trophies (while finishing 46 times as runners-up) and 17 continental prizes (with being runners-up 11 times), including five UEFA Champions League trophies out of eight finals and three FIFA Club World Cup wins out of four finals. The club won six trophies in a calendar year in 2009, becoming one of only 2 male football teams in the world to win the coveted sextuple, apart from FC Bayern Munich in 2020. FC Barcelona also has professional teams in other sports like FC Barcelona Regal (basketball), FC Barcelona Handbol (handball), FC Barcelona Hoquei (roller hockey), FC Barcelona Ice Hockey (ice hockey), FC Barcelona Futsal (futsal) and FC Barcelona Rugby (rugby union), all at one point winners of the highest national or European competitions. The club's museum is the second most visited in Catalonia. The matches against cross-town rivals RCD Espanyol are of particular interest, but there are other Barcelonan football clubs in lower categories, like CE Europa and UE Sant Andreu. FC Barcelona's basketball team has a noted rivalry in the Liga ACB with nearby Joventut Badalona. Barcelona has three UEFA elite stadiums: FC Barcelona's Camp Nou, the largest stadium in Europe with a capacity of 99,354; the publicly owned Estadi Olímpic Lluís Companys, with a capacity of 55,926; used for the 1992 Olympics; and Estadi Cornellà-El Prat, with a capacity of 40,500. Furthermore, the city has several smaller stadiums such as Mini Estadi (also owned by FC Barcelona) with a capacity of 15,000, Camp Municipal Narcís Sala with a capacity of 6,563 and Nou Sardenya with a capacity of 7,000. The city has a further three multifunctional venues for sports and concerts: the Palau Sant Jordi with a capacity of 12,000 to 24,000 (depending on use), the Palau Blaugrana with a capacity of 7,500, and the Palau dels Esports de Barcelona with a capacity of 3,500. Barcelona was the host city for the 2013 World Aquatics Championships, which were held at the Palau San Jordi.[152] Several road running competitions are organized year-round in Barcelona: the Barcelona Marathon every March with over 10,000 participants in 2010, the Cursa de Bombers in April, the Cursa de El Corte Inglés in May (with about 60,000 participants each year), the Cursa de la Mercè, the Cursa Jean Bouin, the Milla Sagrada Família and the San Silvestre. There is also the Ultratrail Collserola which passes 85 km (53 mi) through the Collserola forest. The Open Seat Godó, a 50-year-old ATP World Tour 500 Series tennis tournament, is held annually in the facilities of the Real Club de Tenis Barcelona. Each year on Christmas Day, a 200-meter swimming race across the Old Port of Barcelona takes place.[153] Near Barcelona, in Montmeló, the 107,000 capacity Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya racetrack hosts the Formula One Spanish Grand Prix, the Catalan motorcycle Grand Prix, the Spanish GT Championship and races in the GP2 Series. Skateboarding and cycling are also very popular in Barcelona; in and around the city there are dozens of kilometers of bicycle paths.[citation needed] Barcelona is also home to numerous social centres and illegal squats that effectively form a shadow society mainly made up of the unemployed, immigrants, dropouts, anarchists, anti-authoritarians and autonomists.[154] Peter Gelderloos estimates that there around 200 squatted buildings and 40 social centres across the city with thousands of inhabitants, making it one of the largest squatter movements in the world. He notes that they pirate electricity, internet and water allowing them to live on less than one euro a day. He argues that these squats embrace an anarcho-communist and anti-work philosophy, often freely fixing up new houses, cleaning, patching roofs, installing windows, toilets, showers, lights and kitchens. In the wake of austerity, the squats have provided a number of social services to the surrounding residents, including bicycle repair workshops, carpentry workshops, self-defense classes, free libraries, community gardens, free meals, computer labs, language classes, theatre groups, free medical care and legal support services.[155] The squats help elderly residents avoid eviction and organize various protests throughout Barcelona. Notable squats include Can Vies and Can Masdeu.[citation needed] Barcelona is served by Barcelona-El Prat Airport, about 17 km (11 mi) south-west of the centre of Barcelona. It is the second-largest airport in Spain, and the largest on the Mediterranean coast, which handled more than 50.17 million passengers in 2018, showing an annual upward trend.[156] It is a main hub for Vueling Airlines and Ryanair, and also a focus for Iberia and Air Europa. The airport mainly serves domestic and European destinations, although some airlines offer destinations in Latin America, Asia and the United States. The airport is connected to the city by highway, metro (Airport T1 and Airport T2 stations), commuter train (Barcelona Airport railway station) and scheduled bus service. A new terminal (T1) has been built, and entered service on 17 June 2009. Some low-cost airlines, also use Girona-Costa Brava Airport, about 90 km (56 mi) to the north, Reus Airport, 77 km (48 mi) to the south, or Lleida-Alguaire Airport, about 150 km (93 mi) to the west, of the city. Sabadell Airport is a smaller airport in the nearby town of Sabadell, devoted to pilot training, aerotaxi and private flights. The Port of Barcelona has a 2000-year-old history and a great contemporary commercial importance. It is Europe's ninth largest container port, with a trade volume of 1.72 million TEU's in 2013.[157] The port is managed by the Port Authority of Barcelona. Its 10 km2 (4 sq mi) are divided into three zones: Port Vell (the old port), the commercial port and the logistics port (Barcelona Free Port). The port is undergoing an enlargement that will double its size thanks to diverting the mouth of the Llobregat river 2 km (1 mi) to the south.[158] The Barcelona harbour is the leading European cruiser port and a very important Mediterranean turnaround base.[159] In 2013, 3.6 million pleasure cruise passengers used the Port of Barcelona.[157] The Port Vell area also houses the Maremagnum (a commercial mall), a multiplex cinema, the IMAX Port Vell and one of Europe's largest aquariums – Aquarium Barcelona, containing 8,000 fish and 11 sharks contained in 22 basins filled with 4 million litres of sea water. The Maremagnum, being situated within the confines of the port, is the only commercial mall in the city that can open on Sundays and public holidays. Barcelona is a major hub for the Spanish rail network. The city's main Inter-city rail station is Barcelona Sants railway station, whilst Estació de França terminus serves a secondary role handling suburban, regional and medium distance services. Freight services operate to local industries and to the Port of Barcelona. RENFE's AVE high-speed rail system, which is designed for speeds of 310 km/h (193 mph), was extended from Madrid to Barcelona in 2008 in the form of the Madrid–Barcelona high-speed rail line. A shared RENFE-SNCF high-speed rail connecting Barcelona and France (Paris, Marseilles and Toulouse, through Perpignan–Barcelona high-speed rail line) was launched in 2013. Both these lines serve Barcelona Sants terminal station.[160][161] Barcelona is served by an extensive local public transport network that includes a metro system, a bus network, a regional railway system, trams, funiculars, rack railways, a Gondola lift and aerial cable cars. These networks and lines are run by a number of different operators but they are integrated into a coordinated fare system, administered by the Autoritat del Transport Metropolità (ATM). The system is divided into fare zones (1 to 6) and various Integrated Travel Cards are available.[162] The Barcelona Metro network comprises twelve lines, identified by an \"L\" followed by the line number as well as by individual colours. The Metro largely runs underground; eight Metro lines are operated on dedicated track by the Transports Metropolitans de Barcelona (TMB), whilst four lines are operated by the Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya (FGC) and some of them share tracks with RENFE commuter lines. In addition to the city Metro, several regional rail lines operated by RENFE's Rodalies de Catalunya run across the city, providing connections to outlying towns in the surrounding region. The city's two modern tram systems, Trambaix and Trambesòs, are operated by TRAMMET.[163] A heritage tram line, the Tramvia Blau, also operates between the metro Line 7 and the Funicular del Tibidabo.[164] Barcelona's metro and rail system is supplemented by several aerial cable cars, funiculars and rack railways that provide connections to mountain-top stations. FGC operates the Funicular de Tibidabo up the hill of Tibidabo and the Funicular de Vallvidrera (FGC), while TMB runs the Funicular de Montjuïc up Montjuïc. The city has two aerial cable cars: the Montjuïc Cable Car, which serves Montjuïc castle, and the Port Vell Aerial Tramway that runs via Torre Jaume I and Torre Sant Sebastià over the port. Buses in Barcelona are a major form of public transport, with extensive local, interurban and night bus networks. Most local services are operated by the TMB, although some other services are operated by a number of private companies, albeit still within the ATM fare structure. There are 21 night lines, 19 of them go through Plaça de Catalunya, where you can change to other lines. The frequency is 15/20 minutes between 22:20 and 06:00. A separate private bus line, known as Aerobús, links the airport with the city centre, with its own fare structure. The Estació del Nord (Northern Station), a former railway station which was renovated for the 1992 Olympic Games, now serves as the terminus for long-distance and regional bus services. Barcelona has a metered taxi fleet governed by the Institut Metropolità del Taxi (Metropolitan Taxi Institute), composed of more than 10,000 cars. Most of the licences are in the hands of self-employed drivers. With their black and yellow livery, Barcelona's taxis are easily spotted, and can be caught from one of many taxi ranks, hailed on street, called by telephone or via app.[165][166] On 22 March 2007,[167] Barcelona's City Council started the Bicing service, a bicycle service understood as a public transport. Once the user has their user card, they can take a bicycle from any of the more than 400 stations spread around the city and use it anywhere the urban area of the city, and then leave it at another station.[168] The service has been a success, with 50,000 subscribed users in three months.[169] Barcelona lies on three international routes, including European route E15 that follows the Mediterranean coast, European route E90 to Madrid and Lisbon, and European route E09 to Paris. It is also served by a comprehensive network of motorways and highways throughout the metropolitan area, including A-2, A-7/AP-7, C-16, C-17, C-31, C-32, C-33, C-60. The city is circled by three half ring roads or bypasses, Ronda de Dalt (B-20) (on the mountain side), Ronda del Litoral (B-10) (along the coast) and Ronda del Mig (separated into two parts: Travessera de Dalt in the north and the Gran Via de Carles III), two partially covered[170] fast highways with several exits that bypass the city. The city's main arteries include Diagonal Avenue, which crosses it diagonally, Meridiana Avenue which leads to Glòries and connects with Diagonal Avenue and Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes, which crosses the city from east to west, passing through its centre. The famous boulevard of La Rambla, whilst no longer an important vehicular route, remains an important pedestrian route. The Barri Gòtic (Catalan for \"Gothic Quarter\") is the centre of the old city of Barcelona. Many of the buildings date from medieval times, some from as far back as the Roman settlement of Barcelona. Catalan modernista architecture (related to the movement known as Art Nouveau in the rest of Europe) developed between 1885 and 1950 and left an important legacy in Barcelona. Several of these buildings are World Heritage Sites. Especially remarkable is the work of architect Antoni Gaudí, which can be seen throughout the city. His best-known work is the immense but still unfinished church of the Sagrada Família, which has been under construction since 1882 and is still financed by private donations. As of 2015[update], completion is planned for 2026.[171] Barcelona was also home to Mies van der Rohe's Barcelona Pavilion. Designed in 1929 for the International Exposition for Germany, it was an iconic building that came to symbolize modern architecture as the embodiment of van der Rohe's aphorisms \"less is more\" and \"God is in the details\".[172] The Barcelona pavilion was intended as a temporary structure and was torn down in 1930 less than a year after it was constructed. A modern re-creation by Spanish architects now stands in Barcelona, however, constructed in 1986. Barcelona won the 1999 RIBA Royal Gold Medal for its architecture,[173] the first (and as of 2015[update], only) time that the winner has been a city rather than an individual architect. Barcelona is the home of many points of interest declared World Heritage Sites by UNESCO:[174] Barcelona has a great number of museums, which cover different areas and eras. The National Museum of Art of Catalonia possesses a well-known collection of Romanesque art, while the Barcelona Museum of Contemporary Art focuses on post-1945 Catalan and Spanish art. The Fundació Joan Miró, Picasso Museum, and Fundació Antoni Tàpies hold important collections of these world-renowned artists, as well as the Can Framis Museum, focused on post-1960 Catalan Art owned by Fundació Vila Casas. Several museums cover the fields of history and archaeology, like the Barcelona City History Museum (MUHBA), the Museum of the History of Catalonia, the Archeology Museum of Catalonia, the Maritime Museum of Barcelona, the Music Museum of Barcelona and the privately owned Egyptian Museum. The Erotic museum of Barcelona is among the most peculiar ones, while CosmoCaixa is a science museum that received the European Museum of the Year Award in 2006.[175] The Museum of Natural Sciences of Barcelona was founded in 1882 under the name of \"Museo Martorell de Arqueología y Ciencias Naturales\"[176][177] (Spanish for \"Martorell Museum of Archaeology and Natural Sciences\"). In 2011 the Museum of Natural Sciences ended up with a merge of five institutions: the Museum of Natural Sciences of Barcelona (the main site, at the Forum Building), the Martorell Museum (the historical seat of the Museum, opened to the public from 1924 to 2010 as a geology museum), the Laboratori de Natura, at the Castle of the Three Dragons (from 1920 to 2010: the Zoology Museum), the Historical Botanical Garden of Barcelona, founded 1930, and the Botanical garden of Barcelona, founded 1999. Those two gardens are a part of the Botanical Institute of Barcelona too. The FC Barcelona Museum is the third most popular tourist attraction in Catalonia, with 1,51 million visitors in 2013.[178] Barcelona contains sixty municipal parks, twelve of which are historic, five of which are thematic (botanical), forty-five of which are urban, and six of which are forest.[179] They range from vest-pocket parks to large recreation areas. The urban parks alone cover 10% of the city (549.7 ha or 1,358.3 acres).[74] The total park surface grows about 10 ha (25 acres) per year,[180] with a proportion of 18.1 m2 (195 sq ft) of park area per inhabitant.[181] Of Barcelona's parks, Montjuïc is the largest, with 203 ha located on the mountain of the same name, and includes the Botanical Garden of Barcelona, the Mossèn Costa i Llobera Gardens, and more.[74] It is followed by Parc de la Ciutadella (which occupies the site of the old citadel and which houses the Parliament building, the Barcelona Zoo, and several museums); 31 ha or 76.6 acres including the zoo), the Guinardó Park (19 ha or 47.0 acres), Park Güell (designed by Antoni Gaudí; 17.2 ha or 42.5 acres), Oreneta Castle Park (also 17.2 ha or 42.5 acres), Diagonal Mar Park (13.3 ha or 32.9 acres, inaugurated in 2002), Nou Barris Central Park (13.2 ha or 32.6 acres), Can Dragó Sports Park and Poblenou Park (both 11.9 ha or 29.4 acres), the Labyrinth Park (9.10 ha or 22.5 acres), named after the garden maze it contains.[74] There are also several smaller parks, for example, the Parc de Les Aigües (2 ha or 4.9 acres). A part of the Collserola Park is also within the city limits. PortAventura World, one of the largest resort in Europe, with 5,837,509 visitors per year, is located one hour's drive from Barcelona.[182][183] Also, within the city lies Tibidabo Amusement Park, a smaller amusement park in Plaza del Tibidabo, with the Muntanya Russa amusement ride. Barcelona beach was listed as number one in a list of the top ten city beaches in the world according to National Geographic[116] and Discovery Channel.[184] Barcelona contains seven beaches, totalling 4.5 km (2+3⁄4 mi) of coastline. Sant Sebastià, Barceloneta and Somorrostro beaches, both 1,100 m (3,610 ft) in length,[74] are the largest, oldest and the most-frequented beaches in Barcelona. The Olympic Harbour separates them from the other city beaches: Nova Icària, Bogatell, Mar Bella, Nova Mar Bella and Llevant. These beaches (ranging from 400 to 640 m (1,310 to 2,100 ft) were opened as a result of the city restructuring to host the 1992 Summer Olympics, when a great number of industrial buildings were demolished. At present, the beach sand is artificially replenished given that storms regularly remove large quantities of material. The 2004 Universal Forum of Cultures left the city a large concrete bathing zone on the eastmost part of the city's coastline. Most recently, Llevant is the first beach to allow dogs access during summer season. Barcelona is twinned with:[185] Barcelona also cooperates with:[185]",

                "title": "Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball - Wikipedia",
                "content": "The Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball program is the men's college basketball team of the University of Kentucky. It has eight NCAA championships, the best all-time winning percentage, and the most all-time victories.[2] The Wildcats compete in the Southeastern Conference and are coached by Mark Pope.[3] Adolph Rupp first brought Kentucky to national prominence, winning four NCAA titles. Since then, Joe B. Hall, Rick Pitino, Tubby Smith, and John Calipari each won a national championship, making Kentucky the only school with five coaches to win NCAA championships and placing it second only to UCLA for most titles. Kentucky has finished as the NCAA runner-up four times, making it tied with UCLA and North Carolina for all-time title game appearances at 12. The program has played in 17 NCAA Final Fours, tying Duke for third-all time behind North Carolina and UCLA. Kentucky leads all schools in several NCAA tournament stats: Elite Eight appearances at 38, Sweet Sixteen appearances at 45, total NCAA tournament appearances at 60, and tournament games played at 184. The program is behind only North Carolina with 131 NCAA tournament wins, North Carolina has 132. Kentucky has also won the National Invitation Tournament twice, making it the only school to win multiple NCAA and NIT championships, and it leads all schools in total postseason appearances at 68. Additionally, the Helms Athletic Foundation declared Kentucky the 1933 and 1954 national champions, the latter being Kentucky's only undefeated team in the modern era (post-1930). The 1948 NCAA champion team, coached by Rupp, represented the United States in the Olympics and won a gold medal. Kentucky was the first program to 1000 wins in 1968 and the first to 2000 wins in 2009. The program leads all schools with sixty-three 20-win seasons, sixteen 30-win seasons, and six 35-win seasons. Additionally, Kentucky is second among all teams in conference regular season championships with 53. Throughout its history, the Kentucky basketball program has featured many notable and successful players, both on the collegiate level and the professional level. Five players have been named national player of the year, with Anthony Davis in 2012 and Oscar Tshiebwe in 2022 being consensus selections. Three players have been named national freshman of the year: John Wall in 2010, Davis in 2012, and Reed Sheppard in 2024. Thirty-nine players have been selected as All-Americans a total of 51 times. Kentucky holds the record for the most overall NBA Draft selections (128) and three Wildcats have been selected as the first overall pick (Wall, Davis, and Karl-Anthony Towns). Thirty-nine players have been honored with jersey retirements, as well as Rupp, Hall, Pitino, Smith, equipment manager Bill Keightly, and broadcaster Cawood Ledford. Seven players have been enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Hall of Fame, as well as Rupp, Pitino, Calipari, Eddie Sutton, and Ledford. During Kentucky's earliest seasons the program went through multiple coaches, with the majority staying only one or two seasons. Records indicate that the first head coach of the Wildcats was W. W. H. Mustaine, who in 1903 called together some students, took up a collection totaling $3 for a ball, and told the students to start playing.[4] The first recorded intercollegiate game at the college was a 15–6 defeat to nearby Georgetown College. The team went 1–2 for their first \"season\", also losing to Kentucky University (later Transylvania University) but defeating the Lexington YMCA.[5] Through 1908, the team did not manage a winning season, and had an all-time record of 15–29. In the fall of that year a full-time head coach was hired, Edwin Sweetland. This made him the first paid coach in Kentucky's basketball history.[6] That year, the team went 5–4, and only three years later, boasted their first undefeated season with nine victories and no losses.[7] The 1914 team under Alpha Brummage, led by brothers Karl and Tom Zerfoss, went 12–2 and defeated all its Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association opponents. In 1919, George Buchheit became the new head coach of the Wildcats. An alumnus of the University of Illinois, he brought with him a new system of basketball. The \"Buchheit system\" or \"Illinois system\", focused on defense and featured one player standing under each basket, while three roamed the court. Bucheit varied the system he learned in Illinois in one important way. While the Illinois system employed a zone defense, Buchheit's system used an aggressive man-to-man scheme. On offense, he used a complicated system of passing called the \"zig-zag\" or \"figure eight\" offense.[8] Although the team had a losing season in Buchheit's first year, they won the first-ever Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association tournament the next year, defeating the heavily favored Georgia Bulldogs. Both of these teams were composed entirely of native Kentuckians, anchored by All-American Basil Hayden. The tournament victory was considered Kentucky's first major success, and the 1921 team became known as the \"Wonder Team.\"[9] In 1922, the team was unable to build on the success of the \"Wonder Team.\" Although every player was eligible in 1922, two key players, Hayden and Sam Ridgeway, were injured before the start of the season. Hayden returned from his knee injury during the season, but was never able to play at the level he had the previous year. Ridgeway fought a year-long battle with diphtheria, and although he recovered, never played for the Wildcats again. The remaining three members of the \"Wonder Team\" went 9–5 for the season, and bowed out of the SIAA tournament in the second round.[10] Buchheit remained as coach through the 1924 season before moving on to coach Trinity College (later Duke University). A different coach would guide the team for each of the next four years. C.O. Applegran immediately followed Buchheit, and his 1925 team posted a respectable 13–8 record. Applegran in college had played for the University of Illinois, where he became an All-American. The next year, Ray Eklund led the team to a 15–3 record, and produced UK's second All-American, Burgess Carey.[11] The record was enough for Kentucky to win their first regular season conference championship in the Southern Conference. Seeing the cupboard largely bare for the upcoming year, Eklund resigned shortly before the start of the 1927 season. The team scrambled to find a new coach, and former player Basil Hayden left his coaching job at Kentucky Wesleyan College to answer the call. An inexperienced coach and a roster largely depleted of talent left the Wildcats with a 3–13 record that year. The disappointment convinced Hayden that he wasn't the \"coaching type\", and he resigned after the season. Fortunately for the Wildcats, 1927 would be their last losing season for six decades.[12] The Wildcats' new coach for the 1927–28 season was John Mauer. Although he had a talented group of players moving up from the junior varsity team, Mauer quickly discovered that his players did not know the fundamentals of the game. He began a regimen of three-hour practices five days a week during the preseason. The practice began with half an hour of shooting drills and usually ended with a full-court scrimmage. Between the two, Mauer worked on skill drills and scenarios. Mauer's teams were nicknamed the \"Mauermen.\"[13] Teamwork was the hallmark of Mauer's system. Every player worked on every aspect of the game; there were no specialists. Like Buchheit, Mauer employed a strong man-to-man defense. He utilized a slow-break offense that relied on a complicated system of short passes to get a good shot. Two elements of Mauer's system were new to basketball in the south – the offensive screen and the bounce pass. The latter was so new to most of UK's opponents that it was referred to as the \"submarine attack.\"[14] Over his three-year tenure, Mauer led the Wildcats to an overall record of 40–14. One major prize eluded him, however. Despite having teams that were almost universally acknowledged as the \"class of the South\", Mauer never led a team to the Southern Conference title. Despite his innate ability for coaching, Mauer lacked the ability to heighten his team's emotions for a big game, a fault that was cited as the reason for his lack of tournament success. Mauer left the Wildcats to coach the Miami University Redskins following the 1930 season.[15] In 1930, the university hired Adolph Rupp, who had played as a reserve for the University of Kansas 1922 and 1923 Helms National Championship teams,[16] under coach Forest C. \"Phog\" Allen. At the time of his hiring, Rupp was a high school coach in Freeport, Illinois.[4] Rupp coached the University of Kentucky men's basketball team from 1930 to 1972. There, he gained the nicknames, \"Baron of the Bluegrass\", and \"The Man in the Brown Suit\". Rupp, who was an early innovator of the fast break and set offense, gained a reputation as an intense competitor, a strict motivator, and strategist. Rupp's Wildcat teams won 4 NCAA championships (1948, 1949, 1951, 1958), one NIT title in 1946, appeared in 20 NCAA tournaments, had 6 NCAA Final Four appearances, captured 27 Southeastern Conference (SEC) regular season titles, and won 13 SEC tournaments. Rupp's Kentucky teams also finished ranked No. 1 on 6 occasions in the final Associated Press college basketball poll and 4 times in the United Press International (Coaches) poll. In addition, Rupp's 1966 Kentucky squad (nicknamed \"Rupp's Runts\", as no starting player on the squad was taller than 6'5\") finished runner-up in the NCAA tournament, and his 1947 Wildcats finished runner-up in the NIT. Rupp's 1933 and 1954 Kentucky squads were also awarded the Helms National Championship, and his 1934 and 1947 teams were retroactively recognized as the national champion by the Premo-Porretta Power Poll.[17][18][19][20] Rupp gave the '44 team the nickname \"the Beardless Wonders\" and \"Wildkittens\" because according to Rupp, \"It was like running a Kindergarten\".[citation needed] Of the young players, Kentucky's best player was freshman Chad Anderson who, at the age of 17, was named consensus All-American, making him the youngest player to ever earn the title. The Beardless Wonders won 19 of their 21 games, enough to be invited into the NIT. There they were matched up with a Utah team nicknamed the \"Blitz Kids\".[citation needed] Both teams went into the half tied at 24, but with the help of Brannum Kentucky pulled away to win 46–38. Kentucky lost the next game to home town Saint John's.[citation needed] On the way to its first NCAA title, Kentucky went on to a record of 36–3. Of these three losses, all were either away or at neutral sites, keeping Kentucky undefeated at home throughout the entire season. Kentucky started off the beginning of the season with a 7–0 record heading into their away game at Temple. However, Temple was able to give the Cats their first loss by one point, 60–59. But the Wildcats rolled off an 11-win streak before playing at Notre Dame, where they lost 55–64. They did not lose a game for the rest of the regular season. Kentucky continued through the NCAA tournament to the finals, where they faced the Baylor Bears. Kentucky won its first NCAA title in a decisive 58–42 victory. The season did not end after the NCAA tournament, as Kentucky who would play in the Olympic Trials, where they went 2–1, only losing to the Phillips Oilers once. This was performance enough to represent the United States in the 1948 Olympic Games. Despite only being a college team, the starting 5 of Kentucky defeated all of its competition in London, making Kentucky the only team to win both an NCAA title and an Olympic gold medal.[citation needed] Adolph Rupp soon gave this team the nickname \"The Fabulous Five\", in honor of their accomplishments.[citation needed][21] For the 1949 season Kentucky had high expectations with most of the Fabulous Five returning. Big Blue Nation's expectations were met as the 1949 team won one more game than the previous year including both a SEC regular season and SEC tournament championship, while also getting back to the Final Four that March. In the finals Kentucky faced the Oklahoma A&M Cowboys, a team that had previously seen success in the tournament with back-to-back championships in 1945 and 1946. The Fab Five would succeed again winning 46–36 and Kentucky's only back-to-back NCAA championship. Kentucky was the second program in NCAA history to win back-to-back championships (there have been six other schools since). With a returning star player like Bill Spivey, Kentucky hoped to carry their success into the new decade. The Wildcats lost their first game by 11 to Saint John's at home, but they would pull it together for the Sugar Bowl Tournament, which they won, beating NCAA runner-up Bradley. After losing to Tennessee, Kentucky struggled to chain two wins together, losing every other game. They defeated their next 14 opponents, including getting revenge in SEC tournament championship over Tennessee. Heading into the post-season, No. 3 Kentucky played CCNY in the NIT, missing the NCAA tournament. The Wildcats were no match and were thrashed by the CCNY Beavers, 50–83. Over the season Kentucky defeated four top 10 teams, and were ranked in the top 5 the entire season. Vanderbilt, however, knocked off the top ranked Wildcats in the SEC tournament finals denying them an eighth straight SEC tournament title. Kentucky then defeated fourth ranked Kansas State 68–58 in the NCAA finals, . Adolph Rupp was the head coach at Kentucky during the year of the point-shaving scandal of 1951. In 1945 former Kentucky football player Nick Englisis met Kentucky player Ralph Beard while the two played football at Kentucky. Englisis entered the gambling business when he left the football team in 1946, then approached three Kentucky basketball players Ralph Beard, Alex Groza, and Dale Barnstable with his associates in late 1948 about potentially point shaving (fixing the score of games) during the upcoming season in exchange for money. The three players agreed to point shave and successfully shaved points in several games during the 1948–1949 season until an effort to point shave caused the Wildcats to lose to the Loyola Ramblers in the National Invitation Tournament. Groza, Beard, and Barnstable attempted to win the game under the point spread but kept the score too close, allowing the Ramblers to win the game with an impressive performance at the end of the second half. Kentucky faced Villanova in their first game of the NCAA tournament following the loss to Loyola and the three players attempted to win over the point spread. When Groza, Beard, and Barnstable failed to win over the point spread, it caused Englisis to lose all of his money and ended the point shaving deals between Englisis and these three players.[22] On October 20, 1951, Alex Groza, Ralph Beard, and Dale Barnstable were arrested for taking bribes from gamblers to shave points during several games including the National Invitation Tournament game against the Loyola Ramblers in the 1948–49 season.[23][24] At the conclusion of this scandal, a subsequent NCAA investigation found that Kentucky had committed several rule violations, including giving illegal spending money to players on several occasions, and also allowing some ineligible athletes to compete.[24] As a result, the Southeastern Conference voted to ban Kentucky from competing for a year and the NCAA requested all other basketball-playing members not to schedule Kentucky, with eventually none doing so.[25] As a result of these actions, Kentucky was forced to cancel the entire 1952–53 basketball season. Years later, Walter Byers, the first executive director of the NCAA, unofficially referred to this punishment as the first de facto NCAA death penalty, despite the current rule first coming into effect in 1985, thus the NCAA having no such enforcement power previous to that.[26][27] Echoing Mr. Byers' view, the NCAA's official stance is very much the same, and they now state in hindsight, \"In effect, it was the Association's first death penalty, though its enforcement was binding only through constitutional language that required members to compete against only those schools that were compliant with NCAA rules. Despite fears that it would resist, Kentucky accepts the penalty and, in turn, gives the NCAA credibility to enforce its rules.\" [28] The team posted a perfect 25–0 record in the next year (Rupp's only undefeated season), for which it was awarded the 1954 Helms National Championship. In addition, Kentucky also finished ranked No. 1 in the final Associated Press poll. On the team were three players who had graduated at the conclusion of the previous academic year. When, at the last minute, the NCAA ruled these players ineligible from post-season play, Rupp decided to skip the 1954 NCAA Tournament in protest.[citation needed] The \"Fiddlin' Five\" team earned their name though playing around and mistakes, which Rupp described as fiddling. The Fiddlin' Five still has the most losses out of any Kentucky's championships, with six, three of those were in four games.[citation needed] Unlike the Fab Five or the 1951 teams, the Fiddling Five would yoyo in the rankings with their lowest a No. 13 coming after 56–57 loss to unranked Loyola Chicago. Kentucky improved through the tournament though, and won their fourth title over No. 18 Seattle in the confines of Louisville's Freedom Hall. Rupp's last Final Four team and one of his last chances at a 5th NCAA title occurred in the 1965–66 season, with Kentucky going all the way to the NCAA title game. The 1966 NCAA championship game against Texas Western (now University of Texas-El Paso or UTEP) marked the first occurrence that an all-white starting five (Kentucky) played an all-black starting five (Texas Western) in the NCAA championship game.[citation needed] Texas Western won the game 72–65, on the night of March 19, 1966. Kentucky entered the tournament with only one loss and ranked No. 1, Texas Western also had only one loss and entered the tournament ranked second. Kentucky was a 6.5 point favorite in the game[29] The game was depicted in the film Glory Road.[citation needed] This game, and the result of it, were especially significant as the game came at a time when the civil rights movement was coming into full swing around the country. In 1969, after actively recruiting black players for over six years (his first formal scholarship offer was to Wes Unseld in 1964), despite most of the other SEC teams threatening to boycott if a black player took the court), Rupp finally signed his first black player, Tom Payne, an athletic 7'-1\" center out of Louisville. This ended the aspect of all-white Kentucky teams forever, and marked a new era with many notable black Kentucky basketball legends, including Jack Givens, Sam Bowie, Kenny Walker, Jamal Mashburn, Tayshaun Prince, Rajon Rondo, John Wall, Anthony Davis, and Karl Anthony Towns.[30] The late Rupp years looked promising with Dan Issel's commitment to the Wildcats in 1966. Over the next four years Issel scored an average of 25.7 per game, adding up to 2,137 points in his college career. This made Issel the player with the most points to ever play at Kentucky, a feat that has not been matched to this day. This included his 53 points scored against Mississippi State in 1970, the most by a Kentucky player in a single game until Jodie Meeks made 54 against rival Tennessee on January 13, 2009. Issel did not capture the national championship in his college years, but would go on to make a name for himself in the ABA.[citation needed] After 1966 Rupp saw continued success, but the Final Four eluded him. The Wildcats ended with a 13–13 season and missed the tournament altogether in 1967, then reach the Elite Eight and Sweet Sixteen in the next two years. Ranked #1 in the nation with a 26–1 record overall, Kentucky nearly missed a Final Four berth in a 106–100 shootout against Jacksonville. [citation needed] Rupp was forced into retirement in March 1972, after reaching age 70. At the time, this was the mandatory retirement age for all University of Kentucky employees. He was a 5-time National Coach-of-the-Year award winner, a 7-time Conference Coach-of-the-Year award winner, and was elected a member of both the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame and College Basketball Hall of Fame. Further, since 1972, the Adolph Rupp Trophy, considered one of the nation's premier basketball awards, has been given by Commonwealth Athletic Club to the nation's top men's college basketball player. In addition, the University of Kentucky retired a jersey in his honor in the rafters of Rupp Arena, a 23,500-seat arena named after him, dedicated in 1976.[17][18] Joe B. Hall was the head basketball coach at Kentucky from 1972 to 1985. Although he had been an assistant at Kentucky since 1965, Coach Hall was given a difficult task: to follow in the footsteps of his predecessor, Adolph Rupp. In the 1978 NCAA tournament, he coached the Wildcats to their fifth NCAA championship. He was named National Coach of the Year in 1978 and SEC Coach of the Year on four occasions. His record at UK was 297–100, and 373–156 over his career. Coach Hall won the title once in 1978, as well as making the final four in 1975 and 1984, and the elite eight in 1972, 1973, 1977, 1983.[citation needed] Coach Hall is one of only three men to both play on an NCAA championship team (1949– Kentucky) and coach an NCAA championship team (1978– Kentucky), and the only one to do so for the same school.[citation needed] The only others to achieve this feat are: After a year of playing in the freshman league and a disappointing sophomore season, Hall's Super Kittens returned with hopes of finally bringing Kentucky its fifth title. They nearly did just that, guiding Kentucky to a runner-up finish to UCLA in the 1975 NCAA tournament but not before avenging their 20-point defeat to an undefeated Indiana team. Despite losing in the championship game, it would give freshman Jack Givens a taste for success that would help propel Kentucky to the title three years later. It had been 20 years without a championship in Lexington, and along with pressure of following a hall of fame coach, Hall would nickname the 1978 season the \"Season Without Celebration.\" The pressure to win was immense on both players and coach to bring home the title, especially with a senior laden team that had gone to the finals as freshmen. Kentucky would hardly lose its composure all season or break under pressure, winning 30 of 32 games and defeating eight ranked teams along the way. By the time Kentucky reached the tournament finals they seemed bound to win the title, though Duke would give Kentucky their all. With the help of senior Jack \"Goose\" Givens' 41 points, Kentucky defeated the Blue Devils 94–88, and finally won their fifth title and first in 20 years. In 1985, Eddie Sutton succeeded Joe B. Hall. He coached the Wildcats for four years, leading them to the Elite Eight of the 1986 NCAA tournament. Two seasons later, Sutton and the 25–5 Wildcats captured their 37th SEC title and were ranked as the 6th college basketball team in the nation by the Associated Press and UPI[31][32] before losing to Villanova in the Tournament. Kentucky entered the 1988–89 season with a gutted roster. Ed Davender, Robert Lock and Winston Bennett had all graduated from school, while All-SEC sophomore Rex Chapman left school early to enter the 1988 NBA draft. Additionally, sophomore standout Eric Manuel was suspected of cheating on his college entrance exam and voluntarily agreed to sit out until the investigation was finished. Potential franchise recruit Shawn Kemp transferred out of Kentucky after signing with the school early that year.[33] Unfortunately, Manuel was forced to sit out the entire season as the investigation dragged on, essentially leaving the Wildcats in the hands of inexperienced sophomore LeRon Ellis and true freshman Chris Mills. The two underclassmen struggled to fill the talent vacuum on the court and the Wildcats finished with a losing record of 13–19, the team's first losing full-season record since 1927.[32] To add insult to injury, the NCAA announced at the end of the season that its investigation into the basketball program had found the school guilty of violating numerous NCAA policies.[34] The scandal broke when Emery Worldwide employees claimed to have discovered $1,000 in cash in an envelope Kentucky assistant coach Dwane Casey sent to Mills' father.[35] Later Emery settled a libel lawsuit filed by Casey for a substantial amount of money. Casey was not in Lexington when the envelope was supposedly mailed and the father of Mills said they received no money. The NCAA rescinded its show cause order immediately after the settlement of the lawsuit, and Casey's career has flourished as an NBA coach.[36] Another player, Eric Manuel, was alleged to have received improper assistance on his college entrance exams and was banned from NCAA competition. Whether Manuel was directly involved has been questioned.[37] Kentucky was already on probation stemming from allegations of an extensive scheme of payments to recruits, and the NCAA seriously considered hitting the Wildcats with the \"death penalty\", which would have shut down the entire basketball program (as opposed to simply being banned from postseason play) for up to two years. However, school president David Roselle forced Sutton and athletic director Cliff Hagan to resign. The Wildcats were slapped with three years' probation, a two-year ban from postseason play, the vacating of their two NCAA tournament wins in the 1988 season, and a ban from live television in 1989–90.[38][39] In 1989, Rick Pitino left the NBA's New York Knicks and became the coach at a Kentucky program reeling from the aforementioned scandal. Kentucky would be banned from the 1990 and 1991 post season, with the 1990 season suffering a 14–14 record. Kentucky would improve in 1991 with a beavy of home-grown upperclassmen such as Sean Woods, John Pelphrey, Richie Farmer, Deron Feldhaus, and Reggie Hanson along with the talented freshman Jamal Mashburn. Despite their record of 22–6, Kentucky was still banned from the post season and would have to wait another year to see the Unforgettables succeed in the tournament. Beginning with the 1992 season, Kentucky was free of post season bans. Though they lost one more game than last season, this team was most memorable for going to the Elite Eight (for the first time since Sutton's 1986 team) with many returning upperclassmen from Kentucky. The team is also known for playing in what could be considered one of the greatest games in NCAA tournament history against Duke. In this game defending champion Duke were looking to return to the Final Four once again, Kentucky for the first time in almost a decade. The game was hard-fought and physical on both sides all game including Laettner's infamous stomp on Aminu Timberlake, which resulted in a technical. The teams took the lead back and forth until the final minute of the game which resulted in a first buzzer beater shot by Kentucky's Sean Woods to take the lead 103–102, and then Laettner's shot to win the game for the Blue Devils in the final seconds 104–103. This team came to be known as the \"Unforgettables\" for helping put Kentucky back on the path to success in the 1990s and because the team was made up of home grown Kentucky kids. Kentucky returned a junior Mashburn, along with Travis Ford and Tony Delk. They were expected to reach the Final Four for the first time since Joe B. Hall's 1984 team. The expectations were right, as Kentucky would head into the post-season with only 2 losses and a No. 5 ranking. After winning the SEC Tournament once again, Kentucky stormed to the NCAA Final Four to meet up with Michigan's \"Fab Five\" a team of young and highly talented recruits that brought Michigan to the championship game the year before. As talented as Kentucky was they would fail to reach the championship game with a 78–81 overtime loss to the Wolverines. But this would be the just a glimpse of a run Kentucky would have later in the decade. Kentucky started the next season ranked #1 but would underachieve, falling short of the Elite Eight for the only time under Pitino. The highlight of the season was the \"Mardi Gras Miracle\", a game where Kentucky trailed LSU 68–37 with 15:34 left, but outscored them 62–27 over the remainder of regulation to win 99–95.[40] Starting in 1996, Kentucky would put together a string of Final Fours with help from 9 future NBA players. The \"Untouchables\" as they were nicknamed, would only lose twice, to Final Four bound UMass Minutemen (coached by future Kentucky coach John Calipari) and Mississippi State. It was with their overwhelming talent and chemistry that would win Kentucky their sixth national title in the 1996 NCAA tournament, Kentucky's first NCAA championship in 18 years. The following year, Pitino's Kentucky team made it back to the national title game, losing to Arizona in overtime in the finals of the 1997 NCAA tournament. Pitino's fast-paced teams at Kentucky were favorites of the school's fans. It was primarily at Kentucky where he implemented his signature style of full-court pressure defense. By the end of the Pitino era, Kentucky went from banned from the post season to going to three of the last five Final Fours and five of the last six Elite Eights. For this the 1997 team was dubbed the \"Unbelievables\" for taking a team that was not expected much of to return the Wildcats back to the championship game for a second time. Pitino left Kentucky in 1997 to coach the NBA's Boston Celtics, he then went on to coach Kentucky's in-state rival, the University of Louisville. Orlando \"Tubby\" Smith was introduced by UK Athletic Director C.M. Newton as the Wildcats' 20th head coach on May 12, 1997, charged with the unenviable task of replacing popular coach Rick Pitino. The Wildcats were at the top of the basketball world at the time, having won a national title in 1996 and, according to many, missing a second straight title in 1997 by the torn ACL of shooting guard Derek Anderson.[41] (Anderson tore his ACL in January against SEC foe Auburn; Kentucky lost the 1997 title game in overtime to the Arizona Wildcats.) The team Smith inherited sported seven players from the Arizona loss, and five from the 1996 championship team. However, since most of the players who had left after the 1996 and 1997 seasons were high NBA draft picks, his team had the lowest pre-season ranking since Kentucky came off probation in 1991.[42] In his first season at UK, he coached the Wildcats to their seventh NCAA championship, including a come-from-behind victory against Duke in the Elite Eight, and another comeback win against Stanford, then Utah in the Finals. His 1998 National Championship is unique in modern times, as being along with 1985 Villanova the 2nd team in over 20 years to win without a First Team All American or future NBA Lottery Pick (see 1998 NCAA tournament). The 1998 team was also unlike Kentucky's past two championship teams, often falling behind in games before roaring back to win rather than dominating their competition. Smith's teams, known primarily for a ball line defense-oriented slower style of play coined \"Tubbyball\", received mixed reviews among Kentucky fans who have historically enjoyed a faster, higher-scoring style of play under previous coaches. Smith was also under pressure from Kentucky fans to recruit better players. After leading Kentucky to one National Championship in 1998, Kentucky would complete a perfect 16–0 regular season conference record in 2003, win five SEC regular season championships (1998, 2000, 2001, 2003, 2005) and five SEC Tournament titles (1998, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2004). Smith led the Wildcats to six Sweet Sixteen appearances (1998, 1999, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2005) and four Elite Eight appearances (1998, 1999, 2003, 2005) in his ten seasons. He totaled 100 wins quicker than any other Wildcat coach before him except Hall of Famer Adolph Rupp, reaching the plateau in 130 games (John Calipari subsequently broke this record in 114 games). In 2003, he was named AP College Coach of the Year. In 1998, the reserve guard J.P. Blevins scored 9 points, all on 3-pointers sparking the Wildcats to come back from a 15-point deficit in the first half to upset the number 5 seed, Michigan State 60–58. Averaging only 2.2 points a game all season, Blevins was the unlikely hero for the Wildcats who were 6–4, to give the Spartans who were 8-3 an unlikely upset. Especially since they fell behind 26–11 in the first half.[43] Although Smith compiled an impressive resume during his UK career, he came under considerable pressure from many UK fans, who believed that his failure to achieve even a single Final Four appearance in his last nine seasons was inadequate by UK standards. He was infamously dubbed \"Ten Loss Tubby\" by several disgruntled UK fans. Smith's Final Four drought is the longest of any coach in UK history,[44] although Smith did come just a double-overtime loss short of another Final Four appearance in 2005. On March 22, 2007, Smith resigned his position of UK Head Coach to accept the head coach position at the University of Minnesota.[45] On April 6, 2007, Billy Gillispie was formally announced as the new head coach of the University of Kentucky by UK athletic director Mitch Barnhart. He fielded questions from the media during the press conference held at UK's new practice facility, the Joe Craft Center. He expressed his excitement and joy to be not only considered for the position but to have been given the honor and the opportunity to coach what former UK coach Rick Pitino referred to as the \"Roman Empire\" of college basketball. \"I'm very, very grateful and honored to be here, but we have a lot of work to do.\"[46] Gillispie became only the sixth head coach in the last 76 years at the school.[47] Gillispie's second season again started out rocky in 2008 as the 'Cats fell to Virginia Military Institute in their season opener. The second game of the season saw the Wildcats fall to North Carolina by 19 points. UK rebounded to win 11 of their next 12 games, improving their record to 11–3. On January 4, the Wildcats lost a heart breaker to archrival Louisville 74–71 after a 25 ft. shot by Edgar Sosa with 2.3 seconds remaining in the game. Prior to the shot, UK was down 7 with 38.5 seconds left, and Jodie Meeks was fouled shooting a three, proceeded to make all three free throw shots, Patrick Patterson stole an inbound and passed it to Meeks who laid it in to bring the game to 71–69 with 29.6 left, and then an inbound pass went long and Meeks snatched the pass, drove to the hoop and was fouled, and then made both free throws to tie the game at 71 with 22.9 left. So all in all, UK and Meeks got seven points in about 15 seconds to tie the game.[48] Kentucky disposed of Vanderbilt to win their SEC opener on January 10, 70–60. On January 13, in a road game against Tennessee, Jodie Meeks set a new Kentucky scoring record by dropping 54 points on the Volunteers. This total bested Dan Issel's 39-year-old scoring record by 1 point, and propelled UK to a 90–72 win and 2–0 start in conference play.[49] Kentucky followed up this effort with a 68–45 victory at Georgia, improving to 14–4 on the season. With wins over Auburn and Alabama, Kentucky moved to 5–0 in the SEC. On January 26, UK was ranked in the AP Poll (24th) for the first time since week 1 of the 2007–08 season.[50] UK promptly dropped 3 in a row (to Ole Miss, South Carolina, and Mississippi State) before rebounding at home with a thrilling 68–65 win over Florida. Jodie Meeks scored 23 points in the contest, including the fade-away contested 3-point basket with less than 5 seconds remaining to seal the win for UK. On Valentine's Day Kentucky handily defeated Arkansas at Bud Walton Arena 79–63 behind another strong performance from Meeks. Meeks contributed 45 points and helped UK win despite the absence of Patrick Patterson (sprained ankle). With the win, UK remained tied with South Carolina and Tennessee for 1st in the SEC East at 7–3.[51] Following the win UK completely collapsed, losing 5 of its last 6 games to finish the regular season 19–12 with an 8–8 SEC record. Entering the SEC tournament many felt UK would need to win the championship game to get into the NCAA tournament, but UK was defeated in the second game vs. LSU. With an unimpressive regular season and quick elimination in the SEC tournament, UK did indeed miss the NCAA tournament for the first time in 18 years and instead received an invitation to the NIT tournament where the team was defeated in the quarterfinal round against Notre Dame.[52][53] On March 27, 2009, an 18-minute-long meeting occurred between Billy Gillispie, President Dr. Lee Todd, Jr. and Athletic Director Mitch Barnhart, after which it was announced that Gillispie would not be returning as the head coach the next season. Barnhart stressed the firing was due to more than wins and losses, citing \"philosophical differences\" and \"a clear gap in how the rules and responsibilities overseeing the program are viewed\".[54] On April 1, 2009, John Calipari replaced former head coach Billy Gillispie as the Wildcats head coach. To begin his tenure at the University of Kentucky, John Calipari signed one of the best all time recruiting classes.[55] The class was headlined by four five-star recruits: John Wall, DeMarcus Cousins, Daniel Orton, and Eric Bledsoe.[56] On December 19, 2009, the Wildcats defeated Austin Peay 90–69 extending their record to 11–0, and John Calipari broke Adolph Rupp's record for the most consecutive wins to start a season for a first-year head coach at Kentucky. Kentucky defeated the Drexel Dragons 88–44 on December 21, 2009, to become the first program in college basketball history to claim their 2000th victory.[57] By January 25, 2010, Coach \"Cal\" had the Kentucky Wildcats ranked No. 1 in both the ESPN/Coaches poll and AP poll with a record of 19–0.[58] Calipari helped raise in excess of $1.5 million to aid the country of Haiti during the aftermath of the 2010 Haiti earthquake. President Barack Obama called the Wildcats to thank them for their relief efforts and wish them luck in their future endeavors. To finish off the 2009–10 regular season, Kentucky won its 44th SEC regular season championship (with a final 14–2 SEC record), and won its 26th SEC tournament championship, beating Mississippi State in the finals. The Wildcats then received a No. 1 seed (their 10th No. 1 seed in history) in the East Regional of the NCAA tournament, where they eventually lost to West Virginia in the Elite Eight. This also marked Kentucky's record 50th NCAA Tournament appearance. In 2011 the Wildcats got off to a good start in the regular season with a record of 12–2, with their only losses being North Carolina away and UConn in the Maui Invitational Finals. Conference play was a different matter, and Kentucky would struggle in the SEC losing 6 out of their 8 away games, all of one were against unranked opponents. To close out the season with a three-game defeat No. 13 Florida, No. 23 Vanderbilt and Tennessee at home for a 22–8 record. The hot streak would continue and Kentucky would win their 27th SEC Tournament Title. This was enough for No. 4 seed on the East regional where they played Princeton in a very close first-round game that ended in a 59–57 victory for the Cats. Knight, Jones and company would exact their revenge in the second round against West Virginia, who knocked off Kentucky in the 2010 tourney. In the Sweet Sixteen and Elite Eight they would upset the No. 1 seed Ohio State Buckeyes and No. 2 seed North Carolina Tar Heels on their way to the school's 14th Final Four. They lost in the Final Four to eventual National Champion No. 3 seed UConn 56–55. In the 2011–12 season, Calipari led Kentucky to being 16–0 in SEC regular season play, clinching its 45th SEC regular season championship. The last team to do so in the SEC was the 2002–03 Kentucky Wildcats, and before that, the 1995–96 Kentucky Wildcats. Kentucky's regular season record was 30–1, with its only loss being by one point coming from a 3-pointer buzzer-beater by the Indiana Hoosiers' Christian Watford at Assembly Hall on December 10, 2011. In the SEC Tournament, Kentucky fell to Vanderbilt in the championship game, making its overall record 32–2 going into the NCAA tournament. Kentucky was both selected as the No. 1 seed in the South Region and also the No. 1 seed overall of the entire NCAA Tournament. The Sweet 16 match-up on March 23, 2012, was a rematch against Indiana, in which this time the Wildcats prevailed over the Hoosiers 102–90. On March 25, 2012, Kentucky won the South Regional, setting up a Final Four semifinal with the Louisville Cardinals. Calipari's Wildcats defeated the Cardinals (coached by former Kentucky coach Rick Pitino) by a score of 69–61. This sent Kentucky to the National Championship game against the Kansas Jayhawks, where they defeated Kansas 67–59, winning UK's 8th NCAA championship, along with John Calipari's first NCAA Championship as a head coach. This Kentucky team had a record six players drafted in the 2012 NBA draft, including the first time two teammates have been chosen with the first two picks: Anthony Davis (1st overall), Michael Kidd-Gilchrist (2nd), Terrence Jones (18th), Marquis Teague (29th), Doron Lamb (42nd) and Darius Miller (46th). The 2012–13 season's recruiting class ranked either first or second by various recruiting experts led by top center Nerlens Noel, guard Archie Goodwin, forward Alex Poythress, and four-star center Willie Cauley-Stein. Kentucky also brought in transfer guard Julius Mays, a graduate student who had previously played at Wright State University and North Carolina State. Mays was eligible to play immediately, because UK offered a master's degree program that Wright State did not. However, the only returner that saw significant minutes from the championship squad was back-up power forward Kyle Wiltjer, who averaged 11 minutes per game (Ryan Harrow sat out the previous season after transferring from NC State before the 2011–12 season). Although the team saw the rise of Jarrod Polson in the first game of the season against Maryland, they struggled to close out closer games and play with the will to win that Calipari demands. On February 12, Noel tore his ACL in a loss against Florida. UK was 17–7 including that game, and went 4–5 the remainder of the season, losing all 5 games away from Rupp Arena. The fourth of those losses was against Vanderbilt in the first round of the SEC tournament, and UK missed the NCAA tournament altogether, being the overall No. 1 seed of the NIT. UK was upset by Robert Morris in the first round of the NIT, ending their season with a 21–12 record. In the press conference following the loss to Robert Morris, Calipari stated that his 2013–14 team would be a \"tough, hard-nosed, fighting team.\" Noel and Goodwin both entered the NBA draft and were both taken in the first round at 6th and 29th, respectively. Ryan Harrow transferred to Georgia State to be closer to his father that had suffered from a stroke, and Kyle Wiltjer transferred to Gonzaga. Kentucky brought in the No. 1 recruiting class, featuring a record six McDonald's All-Americans in Julius Randle, Andrew Harrison, Aaron Harrison, James Young, Dakari Johnson, and Marcus Lee, as well as Kentucky natives Derek Willis and Dominique Hawkins, and walk-on E. J. Floreal (son of Edrick Floréal, head coach of UK's track and field team). Alex Poythress and Willie Cauley-Stein did not declare for the 2013 NBA draft, and decided to return for their sophomore seasons. In 2013–14, Kentucky looked to make up for its struggles in the previous season. Despite making the NIT, there were high expectations for this team. The team, however, would be without some of its top players from the 2012–13 team including Nerlens Noel[59] and starting shooting guard Archie Goodwin,[60] who were first-round draft choices in the 2013 NBA draft. Starting power forward Kyle Wiltjer transferred to Gonzaga[61] and starting point guard Ryan Harrow transferred to Georgia State.[62] Returning was former McDonald's All-American Alex Poythress and starting center Willie Cauley-Stein.[60] The poor success of the 2012–13 team did not stop John Calipari from again producing another number one recruiting class. The entering class included a record six McDonald's All-Americans[63] highlighted by Julius Randle and the Harrison Twins from Texas, Aaron and Andrew. Many recruiting analysts and experts proclaimed that the 2013 signing class was the greatest recruiting class since the infamous Fab Five in the 1990s.[64] The team began the season ranked number one in both the AP and Coaches polls.[65][66] The season was full of ups and downs. Early in the season the team experienced close losses to Baylor, Michigan State, and North Carolina. Despite those losses the team was able to defeat in-state rival Louisville. Nothing changed in SEC play for them either. The team ended the regular season losing three of their last four games including once to South Carolina, who finished the season 14–20 overall. The team limped into the SEC tournament unranked, and desperately looking for any answer to their disappointing season. Calipari during his weekly radio call-in show mentioned the team was given a \"tweak\".[67] The \"tweak\" sparked speculation and curiosity among the fans and the media to what it could be. The \"tweak\" was never fully revealed. However, the \"tweak\" caused the team to go on an historic run through both the SEC and NCAA tournaments. UK was the runner-up to number one Florida in the SEC Tournament. During the NCAA tournament UK became the first team in history to eliminate three teams from the previous Final Four (Wichita State, Louisville, Michigan). UK was the National Runner-up after losing to Connecticut in the national championship game. After the 2014 season, Kentucky only lost Julius Randle and James Young to the NBA draft.[68][69] The returning players consisted of a record-tying nine McDonald's All-Americans. Juniors Cauley-Stein and Poythress returned with sophomores Aaron and Andrew Harrison, Johnson, and Lee to join the No. 2 ranked 2015 recruiting class which was highlighted of Gatorade Player of the Year Karl-Anthony Towns for the 2015 season.[70] The team began its season in the Bahamas on a six-game tour against international clubs and teams.[71] While in the Bahamas the team established a \"platoon system\" which featured two groups of five players that would rotate every four minutes within the game.[72] The \"platoon system\" was put on display nationally in a 72–40 victory over No. 5 Kansas in the Champions Classic in November.[73] In December, the team defeated UCLA 83–44. Kentucky led 41–7 at halftime, the lowest UCLA point total for a half in its storied history.[74] The SEC regular season began with two overtime victories over Ole Miss and Texas A&M, the closest games Kentucky would play all season. Kentucky finished the regular season with a perfect 31–0 record, the best start in school history.[75] In the SEC tournament, the team won each game by double digits, including a 78–63 victory over Arkansas in the finals. Cauley-Stein was named the MVP of the Tournament. In the NCAA tournament Kentucky played its first two games at the KFC Yum! Center in Louisville. Prior to the regional semifinal against West Virginia, Mountaineers guard Daxter Miles proclaimed that Kentucky would be 36–1 after the game. The comment fueled the team as they defeated West Virginia 78–39, tying the largest margin of victory in the Sweet 16 in NCAA Tournament history.[76] In the regional final Kentucky narrowly defeated Notre Dame 68–66. The only loss of the season was in the Final Four to Wisconsin, who Kentucky defeated the previous season in the Final Four. The 2014–15 team tied the NCAA record for most wins in a season (38).[77] After the season Cauley-Stein and Towns were named consensus All-Americans among other awards received. The Kentucky Wildcats represented USA Basketball, at Globl Jam 2023, and defeated Canada to win the gold medal. Following a first round upset as a 2 seed in the 2024 NCAA Tournament, John Calipari resigned his position of Head Coach to accept the same role at the University of Arkansas. He was officially announced as the Razorbacks Head Coach on April 10, 2024, marking the end of his storied tenure at Kentucky. On April 12, 2024, Kentucky hired BYU head coach Mark Pope for the same position in Lexington,[78] days after Calipari left for the vacant head coaching post at Arkansas.[79] Pope was a member of the Wildcats' 1995-1996 team that won the NCAA Tournament. The Wildcats have had 23 coaches in their 112-year history. Mark Pope is the current head coach. Six Wildcats coaches have won the National Coach-of-the-Year award: Adolph Rupp in 1950, 1954, 1959, 1966, and 1970, Joe B. Hall in 1978, Eddie Sutton in 1986, Rick Pitino in 1990 and 1992, Tubby Smith in 1998, 2003, and 2005, and John Calipari in 2012 and 2015. Additionally, seven Wildcats coaches have been named Southeastern Conference Coach-of-the-Year: Adolph Rupp in 1964, 1966, 1968, 1969, 1970, 1971 and 1972, Joe B. Hall in 1973, 1975, 1978 and 1983, Eddie Sutton in 1986, Rick Pitino in 1990, 1991 and 1996, Tubby Smith in 1998, 2003, and 2005, Billy Gillispie in 2008, and John Calipari in 2010, 2012, and 2015.[80] The following is a list of Kentucky's 8 National Championships: The NCAA began seeding the tournament with the 1979 edition. The * represents overall number one seed which began with the 2004 Tournament. Kentucky has 42 men's basketball players, coaches, and contributors honored in Rupp Arena with banners representing their numbers hung from the rafters. Due to the number of players honored, the fact that several of them have shared numbers, the numbers are not officially retired. Some of the jersey numbers were before the NCAA rule change before the 1957–58 season that outlawed teams wearing jerseys with a number higher than 5 on it that was not changed until 2023.[81] To have a banner hung, the individual must be elected to the UK Athletics Hall of Fame.[82] The following Kentucky players, coaches, and contributors have been enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. The following Kentucky players and coaches have represented their country in basketball in the Summer Olympic Games: The Kentucky Wildcats presently play their home games in 20,545-seat Rupp Arena. When it opened in 1976, it was the largest arena in the United States built specifically for basketball, and retained that status for much of the following 40-plus years. It was opened in 1976 and is named after legendary Kentucky head coach Adolph Rupp. Located off-campus, in downtown Lexington, the facility's official capacity was 23,500+[89] until a renovation project in the 2019 offseason reduced the capacity to 20,545.[90] The Wildcats have consistently led the country in home attendance since the 1976–77 season (when Rupp Arena first opened), winning the National Attendance Title a record 25 times, including 17 of the past 20 seasons, and 8 of the last 10 seasons. Kentucky also has an impressive 529–64 (.892) all-time record in Rupp Arena.[91] In 2007, the university unveiled the Joe Craft Center, a state-of-the-art basketball practice facility and athletics office building attached to the north side of Memorial Coliseum on the \"Avenue of Champions\" at the University of Kentucky campus in Lexington, Kentucky.[91] The 102,000 ft2 structure contains separate practice courts for the men's and women's basketball programs, separate men's and women's locker rooms, state-of-the-art video rooms for game film viewing, new coaches offices, a ticket office, and athletic administration offices.[92] As a result, Memorial Coliseum has more ample space for volleyball and gymnastics practice and games. The facility is named after businessman and philanthropist Joe Craft, a Hazard, Kentucky native, who pledged $6 million towards the completion of the $30 million project.[92][93] Coming off back-to-back national championships, the team moved to Memorial Coliseum in 1950. Nicknamed \"The House That Rupp Built\", the multipurpose facility cost $4 million and seated 12,000 people. It also housed a swimming pool, physical education equipment, and offices for the athletics staff. The team occupied Memorial Coliseum for twenty-six seasons, and sold out all 345 home games they played there during that period. Kentucky also played a 2009 NIT game at Memorial Coliseum due to Rupp Arena being booked. The Wildcats are 307–38 (.890) all-time at Memorial Coliseum.[89][91][94] Today, Memorial Coliseum is home to three UK women's teams—basketball, gymnastics, and volleyball. In 1924, Alumni Gymnasium was completed. It included seating for 2,800 people and cost $92,000 to construct.[95] Kentucky played 271 games at Alumni Gymnasium from 1924 to 1950, going 247–24 (.911).[91][96] After a major renovation completed in 2018, it is now a student recreation facility known as Alumni Gym Fitness Center.[97] Woodland Park Auditorium, opened in 1906 and closed in 1941, was located on the corner of East High Street and Kentucky Avenue in Lexington, Kentucky. Kentucky used this facility for home games during World War I between 1914 and 1916 going 15–7 there all-time.[91][98] The Wildcats played 84 home games at Buell Armory Gymnasium from 1910 to 1924. It was named for Union Civil War General Don Carlos Buell who was a member of the first board of trustees at Kentucky.[99] The armory was also used during World War I to teach truck maintenance and repair among other skills.[100] Kentucky was 59–25 all-time at Buell Armory Gymnasium.[101] The first home court for the Wildcats was simply called \"The Gymnasium\" or State College Gymnasium until 1910. It was located in the north wing of Barker Hall on the university campus. Constructed in 1902, it also housed the university's physical education classes until 1909. The facility had a capacity of 650 people, and with no bleachers or seats, fans had to stand to watch the games that were played there.[95] By the 1920s, it had become clear that \"The Gymnasium\" (by then renamed \"The Ladies' Gym\") was inadequate to house the university's basketball team. Records show Kentucky was 17–14 at State College Gymnasium.[91][100][102] (Of the 71 major categories listed above, Kentucky is No. 1 in 50 of them, No. 2 in 16 of them, No. No. 3 in 3 of them, No. 4 in 1 of them, and No. 8 in 1 of them.) Kentucky can also lay claim to several individual achievements for both players and coaches: Kentucky also holds several other NCAA records and various additional accomplishments:",

        "Trump sentencing": [
            {
                "title": "Trump's sentencing is set for Jan. 10. Here's what could happen next",
                "content": "Manage your account NEW YORK (AP) — Faced with the never-before-seen dilemma of how, when or even whether to sentence a former and future U.S. president, the judge in President-elect Donald Trump 's hush money case made a dramatic decision that could nevertheless bring the case to a muted end. In a ruling Friday, Manhattan Judge Juan M. Merchan scheduled the sentencing for 10 days before Trump's inauguration — but the judge indicated that he's leaning toward a sentence that would amount to just closing the case without any real punishment. He said Trump could attend the Jan. 10 proceeding remotely because of his transition duties. Still, that would leave Trump headed back to the White House with a felony conviction. See for yourself — The Yodel is the go-to source for daily news, entertainment and feel-good stories. By signing up, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Policy. Will it come to that? Trump wants the conviction thrown out and the case dismissed, and communications director Steven Cheung said the president-elect will “keep fighting.” But it's tough to predict just what will unfold in this unprecedented, unpredictable case. Here are some key questions and what we know about the answers: Remind me: Why is Trump awaiting sentencing? Trump was convicted in May of 34 felony counts of falsifying his business' records. They pertained to a $130,000 payment, made through his former personal lawyer in 2016, to keep porn actor Stormy Daniels from publicizing her story of having had sex with Trump a decade earlier. He denies her claim and says he's done nothing wrong. Trump's sentencing was initially set for July 11. But at his lawyers' request, the proceeding was postponed twice, eventually landing on a date in late November, after the presidential election. Then Trump won, and Merchan put everything on hold to consider what to do. What did the judge just order? Merchan denied Trump's request to toss out the conviction and the entire case. The judge ordered Trump to appear — virtually or in person, as he chooses — for sentencing at 9:30 a.m. Jan. 10. What will Trump's sentence be? That won't be final until the judge pronounces it, and he noted that by law, he has to give prosecutors and Trump an opportunity to weigh in. The charges carry potential penalties ranging from a fine or probation to up to four years in prison. But the judge wrote that “the most viable option\" appears to be what's called an unconditional discharge. It wraps up a case without imprisonment, a fine or probation. But an unconditional discharge leaves a defendant's conviction on the books. And by law, every person convicted of a felony in New York must provide a DNA sample for the state’s crime databank, even in cases of an unconditional discharge. Can Trump appeal to stop the sentencing from happening? It's murky. Appealing a conviction or sentence is one thing, but the ins and outs of challenging other types of decisions during a case are complicated. Former Manhattan Judge Diane Kiesel said that under New York law, Friday's ruling can't be appealed, but that “doesn’t mean he’s not going to try.\" Meanwhile, Trump’s lawyers have been trying to get a federal court to take control of the case. Prosecutors are due to file a response with the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals by Jan. 13, three days after Trump now is to be sentenced. The defense also has suggested it would seek the U.S. Supreme Court’s intervention if Merchan didn’t throw out the case. In a Nov. 25 letter to the judge, Trump’s attorneys contended that the U.S. Constitution permits an appeal to the high court because the defense is making arguments about presidential immunity. Much of their argument concerns the Supreme Court's July ruling on that topic, which afforded considerable legal protections to presidents. Trump's attorneys might try to convince the Supreme Court that it needs to follow up by getting involved now in the hush money case. A Trump spokesperson said no decision had been made on whether to challenge Merchan’s ruling. What do prosecutors say about all this? They declined to comment on Merchan's ruling. They had previously encouraged him to uphold the verdict and offered options such as delaying sentencing until Trump left office, promising no jail time, or closing the case by noting he was convicted but never sentenced because of presidential immunity. Merchan said he found those ideas untenable. Can Trump appeal his conviction? Yes. But by law, he can't do that until he's sentenced. Could Trump pardon himself once he's president? Not in this case. Presidential pardons apply only to federal crimes. Trump was convicted in a New York state court.",

                "title": "Trump to be sentenced in hush money case on 10 January",
                "content": "A judge has ordered that Donald Trump will be sentenced on 10 January in his hush-money case in New York - less than two weeks before he is set to be sworn in as president. New York Justice Juan Merchan signalled he would not sentence Trump to jail time, probation or a fine, but instead give him an \"unconditional discharge\", and wrote in his order that the president-elect could appear in person or virtually for the hearing. Trump had attempted to use his presidential election victory to have the case against him dismissed. The president-elect has posted on social media dismissing the judge's order as an \"illegitimate political attack\" and calling the case \"nothing but a rigged charade\". Trump was convicted in May of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records related to a $130,000 (£105,000) payment to adult-film star Stormy Daniels. The charges related to attempts to cover up reimbursements to his ex-lawyer, Michael Cohen, who in the final days of the 2016 election campaign paid off the adult-film star to remain silent about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump. The president-elect has denied all wrongdoing and pleaded not guilty, arguing the case was an attempt to harm his 2024 presidential campaign. In the post on his Truth Social platform on Saturday Trump said the judge's sentencing order \"goes against our Constitution and, if allowed to stand, would be the end of the Presidency as we know it\". Trump's spokesperson Steven Cheung earlier called the order part of a \"witch hunt\". \"President Trump must be allowed to continue the presidential transition process and to execute the vital duties of the presidency, unobstructed by the remains of this or any remnants of the witch hunts,\" Cheung said. \"There should be no sentencing, and President Trump will continue fighting against these hoaxes until they are all dead.\" In his latest motion against the case, Trump had argued the case would hang over him during his presidency and impede his ability to govern. Justice Merchan said he had been advised of several measures he could employ that could assuage Trump's concerns about being distracted by a criminal case while serving as president that fell short of the \"extreme remedy\" of overturning the jury's verdict. His options included delaying the sentencing until Trump, 78, leaves the White House in 2029, or guaranteeing a sentence that would not involve prison time. Trump had initially, and unsuccessfully, argued the case against him ran afoul of a Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity. In July, the country's top court ruled that presidents have broad immunity from criminal prosecution for \"official actions\" they take while in office. However, last month Justice Merchan ruled Trump's hush money conviction was valid. Trump is currently set to be the first convicted felon to serve in the White House. He may attempt to appeal against the conviction after the sentencing. While falsifying business records is punishable by up to four years in prison in the US, there is no minimum sentence and incarceration is not required. Even before his election victory, legal experts thought it was unlikely Trump would face jail time given his age and his legal record. Trump has also been charged in three other state and federal criminal cases: one involving classified documents and two relating to his alleged efforts to overturn his loss in the election of 2020. The president-elect was initially scheduled to be sentenced on 26 November, but Justice Merchan pushed the date back after Trump won the presidential election. He reportedly placed explosives in the area before changing clothes and driving into pedestrians.

                "content": "Manchester City Football Club (or simply Man City F.C.) is a professional football club based in Manchester, England, that competes in the Premier League, the top flight of English football. Founded in 1880 as St. Mark's (West Gorton), they became Ardwick Association Football Club in 1887 and Manchester City in 1894. The club's home ground is the City of Manchester Stadium, currently known as the Etihad Stadium in east Manchester, to which they moved in 2003, having played at Maine Road since 1923. Manchester City adopted their sky blue home shirts in 1894, the first season with the current name.[4] Over the course of its history, the club has won ten league titles, seven FA Cups, eight League Cups, seven FA Community Shields, one UEFA Champions League, one European Cup Winners' Cup, one UEFA Super Cup and one FIFA Club World Cup. The club joined the Football League in 1892, and won their first major honour, the FA Cup, in 1904. Manchester City had its first major period of success in the late 1960s and early 1970s, winning the league title, FA Cup, League Cup, and European Cup Winners Cup under the management of Joe Mercer and Malcolm Allison. After losing the 1981 FA Cup final, Manchester City went through a period of decline, culminating in relegation to the third tier of English football for the only time in their history in 1998. They since regained promotion to the top tier in 2001–02 and have remained a fixture in the Premier League since 2002–03. Manchester City received considerable financial investment both in playing staff and facilities following its takeover by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan through the Abu Dhabi United Group in August 2008.[5] This started a new era of unprecedented success, with the club winning the FA Cup in 2011 and the Premier League in 2012, both their first since the 1960s, followed by another league title in 2014. Under the management of Pep Guardiola, Manchester City won the Premier League in 2018, becoming the only team in the competition history to attain 100 points in a single season. In 2018–19, they won four trophies, completing an unprecedented sweep of all domestic titles in England and becoming the first English men's team to win the domestic treble.[6] This was followed by four consecutive Premier League titles in 2020–21, 2021–22, 2022–23 and 2023–24, as well as the club's first Champions League final in 2021, which they lost to Chelsea. The 2022–23 season saw Manchester City win their maiden European Cup and complete the continental treble in the process, becoming the second English club to do so.[7] The club was ranked first in the UEFA coefficient standings in 2023.[8] Manchester City topped the Deloitte Football Money League at the end of the 2021–22 season, making it the football club with the highest revenue in the world, approximated at €731 million.[9] In 2022, Forbes estimated the club was the sixth-most valuable in the world, worth $4.250 billion.[10][11] Manchester City are owned by City Football Group Limited, a holding company valued at £3.73 ($4.8) billion in November 2019 and majority-owned by the Abu Dhabi United Group.[12][13] City gained their first honours by winning the Second Division in 1899; with it came promotion to the highest level in English football, the First Division. They went on to claim their first major honour on 23 April 1904, beating Bolton Wanderers 1–0 at Crystal Palace to win the FA Cup; the Blues narrowly missed out on a League and Cup double that season after finishing runners-up in the league campaign, but they still became the first club in Manchester to win a major honour.[15] In the seasons following the FA Cup triumph, the club was dogged by allegations of financial irregularities, culminating in the suspension of seventeen players in 1906, including captain Billy Meredith, who subsequently moved across town to Manchester United.[16] A fire at Hyde Road destroyed the main stand in 1920, and in 1923 the club moved to their new purpose-built stadium at Maine Road in Moss Side.[17] In the 1930s, Manchester City reached two consecutive FA Cup finals, losing to Everton in 1933, before claiming the Cup by beating Portsmouth in 1934.[18] During the 1934 run, the club broke the record for the highest home attendance of any club in English football history, as 84,569 fans packed Maine Road for a sixth-round FA Cup tie against Stoke City – a record which stood until 2016.[19][20] The club won the First Division title for the first time in 1937, but were relegated the following season, despite scoring more goals than any other team in the division.[21] Twenty years later, a City team inspired by a tactical system known as the Revie Plan reached consecutive FA Cup finals again, in 1955 and 1956; just as in the 1930s, they lost the first one, to Newcastle United, and won the second. The 1956 final, in which the Blues defeated Birmingham City 3–1, saw City goalkeeper Bert Trautmann continuing to play on after unknowingly breaking his neck.[22] After being relegated to the Second Division in 1963, the future looked bleak with a record low home attendance of 8,015 against Swindon Town in January 1965.[23] In the summer of 1965, the management team of Joe Mercer and Malcolm Allison was appointed. In the first season under Mercer, Manchester City won the Second Division title and made important signings in Mike Summerbee and Colin Bell.[24] Two seasons later, in 1967–68, City claimed the league championship for the second time, beating their close neighbours Manchester United to the title on the final day of the season with a 4–3 victory at Newcastle United.[25] Further trophies followed: City won the FA Cup in 1969 and a year later triumphed in the European Cup Winners' Cup, defeating Górnik Zabrze 2–1 in the 1970 final. This was the club's only European honour until their triumph in the 2022–23 UEFA Champions League.[26] The Blues also won the League Cup that year, becoming the second English team to win a European trophy and a domestic trophy in the same season. The club continued to challenge for honours throughout the 1970s, finishing one point behind the league champions on two occasions and reaching the final of the 1974 League Cup.[27] One of the matches from this period that is most fondly remembered by supporters of Manchester City is the final match of the 1973–74 season against arch-rivals Manchester United, who needed to win to have any hope of avoiding relegation. Former United player Denis Law scored with a backheel to give City a 1–0 win at Old Trafford and confirm the relegation of their rivals.[28][29] The final trophy of the club's most successful period of the 20th century was won in 1976, when Newcastle United were beaten 2–1 in the League Cup final. A long period of decline followed the success of the 1960s and 1970s. Malcolm Allison rejoined the club to become manager for the second time in 1979, but squandered large sums of money on several unsuccessful signings, such as Steve Daley.[30] A succession of managers then followed – seven in the 1980s alone. Under John Bond, City reached the 1981 FA Cup final but lost in a replay to Tottenham Hotspur. The club were twice relegated from the top flight in the 1980s (in 1983 and 1987), but returned to the top flight again in 1989 under Mel Machin. Howard Kendall guided the club to top flight safety in 1990 and the club finished fifth in 1991 and 1992 under the management of active player Peter Reid.[31] However, this was only a temporary respite, and following Reid's departure Manchester City's fortunes continued to fade. City were co-founders of the Premier League upon its creation in 1992, but after finishing ninth in its first season, Peter Swales, club chairman since 1973, was replaced by club legend Francis Lee in February 1994 in a movement supported by fans. Despite this, they endured three years of struggle under Brian Horton and Alan Ball Jr. before being relegated in dramatic fashion in 1996. After two seasons in the First Division[a] and four different permanent managers, Lee resigned from his role as chairman midway through the 1998 season, although remained as a shareholder, as City fell to the lowest point in their history, becoming the second ever European trophy winners to be relegated to their country's third-tier league after 1. FC Magdeburg of Germany. After relegation, the club underwent off-the-field upheaval, with new chairman David Bernstein introducing greater fiscal discipline.[32] Under manager Joe Royle, City were promoted at the first attempt, achieved in dramatic fashion in the Second Division play-off final against Gillingham.[33] A second successive promotion saw City return to the top division, but this proved to have been a step too far for the recovering club, and in 2001 City were relegated once more. Kevin Keegan replaced Royle as manager in the close season, and achieved an immediate return to the top division as the club won the 2001–02 First Division championship, breaking club records for the number of points gained and goals scored in a single season in the process.[34] The 2002–03 season was the last at Maine Road and included a 3–1 derby victory over rivals Manchester United, ending a 13-year run without a derby win.[35] Additionally, City qualified for European competition for the first time in 25 years via UEFA fair play ranking. In the close 2003–04 season, the club moved to the new City of Manchester Stadium. The first four seasons at the stadium all resulted in mid-table finishes. Former England manager Sven-Göran Eriksson became the club's first foreign manager when appointed in 2007.[36] After a bright start, performances faded in the second half of the season, and Eriksson was sacked on 2 June 2008;[37] he was replaced by Mark Hughes two days later.[38] By 2008, Manchester City were in a financially precarious position. Thaksin Shinawatra had taken control of the club the year before, but his political travails saw his assets frozen.[39] Then, in August 2008, City were purchased by the Abu Dhabi United Group. The takeover was immediately followed by a flurry of bids for high-profile players; the club broke the British transfer record by signing Brazilian international Robinho from Real Madrid for £32.5 million.[40] There was not a huge improvement in performance compared to the previous season despite the influx of money however, with the team finishing tenth, although they did well to reach the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup. During the summer of 2009, the club took transfer spending to an unprecedented level, with an outlay of over £100 million on players Gareth Barry, Roque Santa Cruz, Kolo Touré, Emmanuel Adebayor, Carlos Tevez, and Joleon Lescott.[41] In December 2009, Mark Hughes – who had been hired shortly before the change in ownership but was originally retained by the new board – was replaced as manager by Roberto Mancini.[42] City finished the season in fifth position in the Premier League, narrowly missing out on a place in the Champions League but qualifying for the UEFA Europa League.[43] Continued investment in players followed in successive seasons, and results began to match the upturn in player quality. City reached the FA Cup final in 2011, their first major final in over 30 years, after defeating derby rivals Manchester United in the semi-finals,[44] the first time they had knocked their rival out of a cup competition since 1975. The Blues defeated Stoke City 1–0 in the final, securing their fifth FA Cup and the club's first major trophy since winning the 1976 League Cup. On the last day of the 2010–11 season, City beat out Arsenal for the third place, thereby securing qualification directly into the Champions League group stage.[45] Strong performances continued to follow in the 2011–12 season, including a 5–1 victory over Tottenham at White Hart Lane and a record-equalling 6–1 win over Manchester United at Old Trafford, but a poor run of form in the second half of the season left City in second place, eight points behind United with only six games left to play. At this point, United suffered their own loss of form, dropping eight points in the space of four games, while City began a run of successive wins which saw both teams level on points with two games to go. Despite the Blues only needing a home win against Queens Park Rangers, a team in the relegation zone, they fell 1–2 behind by the end of normal time. However, two goals in injury time – the second by Sergio Agüero in the fourth added minute – settled the title in City's favour, making them the first team to win the Premier League on goal difference alone.[46] The following season, City were unable to replicate the previous year's success. After finishing second in the league, eleven points behind Manchester United, and losing the FA Cup final 0–1 to relegated Wigan Athletic,[47] Mancini was sacked.[48] He was replaced by Chilean manager Manuel Pellegrini.[49] In Pellegrini's first year in charge, City won the League Cup and regained the Premier League title on the last matchday of the season.[50][51] The team's league form then slowly declined over the next couple of years, as the Blues finished second in 2014–15 and then dropped to fourth in 2015–16, although the 2015–16 season would see City win another League Cup title and reach the Champions League semi-finals for the first time.[52] Pep Guardiola, former head coach of Barcelona and Bayern Munich, was confirmed to become Manchester City's new manager on 1 February 2016,[53] with the announcement having been made several months before Manuel Pellegrini left his position. Guardiola's first season in Manchester would end trophyless, with the Blues placing third in the league standings,[54] but the following season proved far more successful, as City won the Premier League title with the highest points total in history and broke numerous other club and English league records along the way.[55] This would prove to be the start of a period of unprecedented success for Manchester City under Guardiola. Between the 2017–18 and 2023–24 Premier League seasons, City won six out of possible seven league titles, only finishing second behind Liverpool in the 2019–20 season.[56] Guardiola also guided the Blues to silverware in domestic cup competitions, highlighted by four consecutive League Cup triumphs in 2018–2021.[57] During the 2018–19 season, City completed an unprecedented domestic treble of English men's titles.[58] Apart from winning all three of the major English football tournaments, they also won the Community Shield, the first time any team has ever held all four of England's primary football trophies at the same time.[59] On the continental stage, the club achieved breakthrough in 2020–21, reaching their first-ever Champions League final.[60] In an all-English affair, City lost 0–1 to Chelsea at the Estádio do Dragão in Porto.[61] The 2022–23 season turned out to be the greatest in the club's history, as Manchester City won their third consecutive Premier League title, the FA Cup final against rivals Manchester United, and their maiden Champions League title at the Atatürk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul against Inter Milan, thereby assembling a rare feat – the continental treble. The road to the Champions League victory included wins over European giants Bayern Munich, who were defeated 4–1 on aggregate,[62] and Real Madrid, who suffered a 1–5 aggregate loss at the hands of City.[63][64][65] The following season saw considerably less success for the Blues, as they won the UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup for the first time and became the first English men's club to win four consecutive league titles.[66] City also advanced to the FA Cup final for the second straight year but lost in a rematch to rivals Manchester United. Manchester City's era of sustained competitive excellence coincided with charges of breaching Financial Fair Play (FFP) regulations. In 2020, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) ruled that sanctions placed on the club by UEFA were not justified, overturning City's two-year European ban.[67] In 2023, the Premier League announced its own investigation of the allegations levied against Manchester City, charging the club with 115 breaches of its FFP rules up to the 2017–18 season.[68][69] On 24 November 2024 in the 2024-25 season, City lost 0–4 to Tottenham Hotspur that marked the end of their 52-game unbeaten streak at home. It was the Citizen's first home defeat since November 2022 when Brentford claimed a surprise victory at the same venue. Despite having most of the ball possession and creating 23 attempts at goal, City were made to rue wasteful chances while their opponent on the day converted their chances clinically.[70] Manchester City's home colours are sky blue and white. Traditional away kit colours have been either maroon or (from the 1960s) red and black; however, in recent years several colours have been used. The origins of the club's home colours are unclear, but there is evidence that the club has worn blue since 1892 or earlier. A booklet entitled Famous Football Clubs – Manchester City published in the 1940s indicates that West Gorton (St. Marks) originally played in scarlet and black, and reports dating from 1884 describe the team wearing black jerseys bearing a white cross, showing the club's origins as a church side.[71]: 14–15 The infrequent yet recurrent use of red and black away colours comes from former assistant manager Malcolm Allison's belief that adopting the colours of AC Milan would inspire City to glory.[72] Allison's theory seemingly took effect, with City winning the 1969 FA Cup final, 1970 League Cup final, and 1970 Cup Winners' Cup final in red and black stripes as opposed to the club's home kit of sky blue. City had previously worn three other badges on their shirts, prior to their current badge being implemented in 2016. The first, introduced in 1970, was based on designs which had been used on official club documentation since the mid-1960s. It consisted of a circular badge which used the same shield as the present badge (including a ship, based on the City of Manchester coat of arms), inside a circle bearing the name of the club. In 1972, this was replaced by a variation which replaced the lower half of the shield with the red rose of Lancashire. In 1976, a heraldic badge was granted by the College of Arms to the English Football League for use by City. The badge consisted of the familiar ship above a red rose but on a circular device instead of a shield (blazoned as \"A roundel per fess azure and argent in chief a three masted ship sails set pennons flying or in base a rose gules barbed and seeded proper\").[73] On occasions when Manchester City played in a major cup final, the club wore shirts bearing the City of Manchester coat of arms, as a symbol of pride in representing the city at a major event. This practice originated from a time when the players' shirts did not normally bear a badge of any kind.[74]: 21 The club has since abandoned the practice; for the 2011 FA Cup final, its first in the 21st century, City used the usual badge with a special legend, but the Manchester coat of arms was included as a small monochrome logo in the numbers on the back of players' shirts.[75] A new club badge was adopted in 1997, as a result of the previous badge being ineligible for registration as a trademark. This badge was based on the arms of the city of Manchester, and consisted of a shield in front of a golden eagle. The eagle is an old heraldic symbol of the city of Manchester; a golden eagle was added to the city's badge in 1958 (but had since been removed), representing the growing aviation industry. The shield featured a ship on its upper half representing the Manchester Ship Canal, and three diagonal stripes in the lower half symbolised the city's three rivers – the Irwell, the Irk and the Medlock. The bottom of the badge bore the motto \"Superbia in Proelio\", which translates as \"Pride in Battle\" in Latin. Above the eagle and shield were the three stars, added for decorative purposes. On 15 October 2015, following years of criticism from the fans over the design of the 1997 badge,[76] the club announced they intended to carry out a fan consultation on whether to discontinue the current badge and institute a new design.[76] After the consultation, the club announced in late November 2015 the badge would be replaced in due course by a new version which would be designed in the style of the older, circular variants.[77] A design purporting to be the new badge was unintentionally leaked two days early prior to the official unveiling on 26 December 2015 by the IPO when the design was trademarked on 22 December.[78] The new badge was officially unveiled at Manchester City's home match against Sunderland on 26 December.[79] Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules; some limited exceptions apply.

Since 2003, Manchester City have not issued the squad number 23. It was retired in memory of Marc-Vivien Foé, who was on loan to the club from Lyon at the time of his death on the field of play while playing for Cameroon in the 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup.[87] Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules; some limited exceptions apply. Players may hold more than one non-FIFA nationality. This is a list of City's official club captains, who are currently appointed via a vote of players and staff. Other players (vice-captains) have led the team on the pitch when the club captain is not playing or not available. Some players have been made captain on a one-off basis to celebrate or commemorate an event, e.g. Oleksandr Zinchenko captained the team in their 2021–22 FA Cup fifth round tie at Peterborough United in support of his country during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.[88] Each season since the end of the 1966–67 season, the members of the Manchester City Official Supporters Club have voted by ballot to choose the player on the team they feel is the most worthy of recognition for his performances during that season.

Even in the late 1990s, when City were relegated twice in three seasons and playing in the third tier of English football (then the Second Division, now the EFL League One), home attendances were in the region of 30,000, compared to an average of fewer than 8,000 for the division.[126] Research carried out by Manchester City in 2005 estimated a fanbase of 886,000 in the United Kingdom and a total in excess of 2 million worldwide, although since the purchase of the club by Sheikh Mansour, and City's recent achievements, that figure has since ballooned to many times that size.[127] Manchester City's officially recognised supporters club is the Manchester City F.C. Supporters Club (1949), formed by a merger of two existing organisations in 2010: the Official Supporters Club (OSC) and the Centenary Supporters Association (CSA).[128] City fans' song of choice is a rendition of \"Blue Moon\", which despite its melancholic theme is belted out with gusto as though it were a heroic anthem. City supporters tend to believe that unpredictability is an inherent trait of their team, and label unexpected results \"typical City\".[129][130] Events that fans regard as \"typical City\" include the club being the only reigning English champions ever to be relegated (in 1938), the only team to score and concede over 100 goals in the same season (1957–58),[131] or the more recent example where Manchester City were the only team to beat Chelsea in the latter's record-breaking 2004–05 Premier League season, yet in the same season City were knocked out of the FA Cup by Oldham Athletic, a team two divisions lower. In the late 1980s, City fans started a craze of bringing inflatable objects to matches, primarily oversized bananas. One disputed explanation for the phenomenon is that in a match against West Bromwich Albion, chants from fans calling for the introduction of Imre Varadi as a substitute mutated into \"Imre Banana\". Terraces packed with inflatable-waving supporters became a frequent sight in the 1988–89 season, as the craze spread to other clubs (inflatable fish were seen at Grimsby Town), with the craze reaching its peak at City's match at Stoke City on 26 December 1988, a game declared by fanzines as a fancy dress party.[132] In 2010, Manchester City supporters adopted an exuberant dance, dubbed The Poznań, from fans of Polish club Lech Poznań that they played in the Europa League.[133] In 2022, Manchester City proposed the release of the Connected Scarf, that would contain a sensor tracking physiological and emotional data of the wearer, for supporters in 2023.[134] Manchester City's biggest rivalry is with neighbours Manchester United, against whom they contest the Manchester derby. Before the Second World War, when travel to away games was rare, many Mancunian football fans regularly watched both teams even if considering themselves \"supporters\" of only one. This practice continued into the early 1960s but as travel became easier, and the cost of entry to matches rose, watching both teams became unusual and the rivalry intensified. A common stereotype is that City fans come from Manchester proper, while United fans come from elsewhere. A 2002 report by a researcher at Manchester Metropolitan University found that while it was true that a higher proportion of City season ticket holders came from Manchester postcode areas (40% compared to United's 29%), there were more United season ticket holders, the lower percentage being due to United's higher overall number of season ticket holders (27,667 compared to City's 16,481). The report noted that since the compiling of data in 2001, the number of both City and United season ticket holders had risen; expansion of United's ground and City's move to the City of Manchester Stadium have caused season ticket sales to increase further.[135] Over the last few years, Manchester City has also developed a notable rivalry with Liverpool,[136] currently considered one of the biggest in association football.[137][138] Though the two clubs had been involved in a title race in the 1976–77 season, Liverpool and City's modern rivalry began in the 2010s, with the Blues beating Liverpool to the 2013–14 title by just two points on the final day of the season.[139] In the final of the 2015–16 League Cup, City defeated Liverpool on penalties after a 1–1 draw. The two clubs met in European competition for the first time in the 2017–18 Champions League quarter-finals, where Liverpool won 5–1 on aggregate, ultimately reaching the final and then winning the competition a year later.[140][141] In the 2018–19 season, City again won the title on the final day, with the Blues' 98 points and Liverpool's 97 being the third- and fourth-highest Premier League points totals ever.[142] The following season, Liverpool clinched the title, recording 99 points (the second-highest Premier League total ever after Manchester City's 100 in 2017–18) to finish 18 points above runners-up City. The Blues then regained the title in 2020–21 and outgunned Liverpool in another closely-fought title race in 2021–22, to finish with 93 points to Liverpool's 92. The success of the two teams in the 2010s and 2020s has led to the development of a rivalry between Jürgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola, the managers of Liverpool and Manchester City, with the two previously having been the respective managers of Der Klassiker rivals Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga.[143] At the end of the 2018–19 season, Guardiola described his relationship with Klopp as a \"beautiful rivalry\" and called Klopp's Liverpool team \"the strongest opponents I have faced in my career as a manager\".[144][145] In September 2019, Klopp hailed Guardiola for being his 'greatest rival ever', after both were nominated for the FIFA Men's Coach of the Year award in 2019, which Klopp ultimately won.[146][147] In a 2019 survey, City fans answered that Liverpool, and not Manchester United, are the club's biggest rivals.[148] Manchester City also have long established local rivalries with Bolton Wanderers, Oldham Athletic, and Stockport County, and more recent competitive Premier League rivalries with Tottenham Hotspur, Chelsea and Arsenal.[149][150][151] The holding company of Manchester City F.C., Manchester City Limited, is a private limited company, with approximately 54 million shares in issue. The club has been in private hands since 2007, when the major shareholders agreed to sell their holdings to UK Sports Investments Limited (UKSIL), a company controlled by former Thailand prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. UKSIL then made a formal offer to buy the shares held by several thousands of small shareholders. Prior to the Thaksin takeover, the club was listed on the specialist independent equity market PLUS (formerly OFEX),[152] where it had been listed since 1995. On 6 July 2007, having acquired 75% of the shares, Thaksin de-listed the club and re-registered it as a private company.[153] By August, UKSIL had acquired over 90% of the shares and exercised its rights under the Companies Act to \"squeeze out\" the remaining shareholders, and acquire the entire shareholding. Thaksin Shinawatra became chairman of the club and two of Thaksin's children, Pintongta and Oak Chinnawat became directors. Former chairman John Wardle stayed on the board for a year, but resigned in July 2008 following Nike executive Garry Cook's appointment as executive chairman in May.[154] The club made a pre-tax loss of £11m in the fiscal year ending 31 May 2007, the final year for which the club published accounts as a public company.[155] Thaksin's purchase prompted a period of transfer spending at the club,[156] in total around £30 million,[157] whereas over the several previous seasons Manchester City's net spending had been among the lowest in the Premier League. A year later, this investment was dwarfed by an influx of money derived from the club's takeover. On 1 September 2008, Abu Dhabi-based Abu Dhabi United Group Investment and Development Limited completed the takeover of Manchester City. The deal, worth a reported £200 million, was announced on the morning of 1 September. It sparked various transfer \"deadline-day\" rumours and bids such as the club's attempt to gazump Manchester United's protracted bid to sign Dimitar Berbatov from Tottenham Hotspur for a fee in excess of £30 million.[158][159] Minutes before the transfer window closed, the club signed Robinho from Real Madrid for a British record transfer fee of £32.5 million.[160] The wealth of the new owners meant that, in the summer of 2009, City were able to finance the purchase of experienced international players prior to the new season, spending more than any other club in the Premier League.[161] Created in the 2013–14 season to manage the global footballing interests of the Abu Dhabi United Group, City Football Group (CFG) is an umbrella corporation owning stakes in a network of global clubs for the purposes of resource sharing, academy networking and marketing. In addition to Manchester City, City Football Group owns stakes in a number of clubs: The City of Manchester Stadium in east Manchester, known as the Etihad Stadium since 2011 for sponsorship reasons, is on a 200-year lease from Manchester City Council to Manchester City. It has been the club's home since the end of the 2002–03 season, when City moved from Maine Road.[176] Before moving to the stadium, the club spent in excess of £30 million to convert it to football use: the pitch was lowered, adding another tier of seating around it, and a new North Stand was constructed.[177] The inaugural match at the new stadium was a 2–1 win over Barcelona in a friendly match.[178] A 7,000-seat third tier on the South Stand was completed in time for the start of the 2015–16 football season, increasing the stadium's capacity to 55,097. A North Stand third tier is in development, potentially increasing capacity to around 61,000.[179] After playing home matches at five stadiums between 1880 and 1887, the club settled at Hyde Road Football Stadium, its home for 36 years.[180] A fire destroyed the Main Stand in 1920, and the club moved to the 84,000 capacity Maine Road three years later. Maine Road, nicknamed the \"Wembley of the North\" by its designers, hosted the largest-ever crowd at an English club ground when 84,569 attended an FA Cup tie against Stoke City on 3 March 1934.[181] Though Maine Road was redeveloped several times over its 80-year lifespan, by 1995 its capacity was restricted to 32,000, prompting the search for a new ground which culminated in the move to the City of Manchester Stadium in 2003; it was renamed the Etihad Stadium in 2011.[182] In September 2024, Manchester City revealed plans to expand the North Stand of the Etihad Stadium, increasing the total capacity to 61,000. The expanded section is scheduled to open for the start of the 2025/26 season. The project also includes the construction of a hotel, office premises for club staff and a new fan zone .[183] Based on trophy count, Manchester City are one of the most successful teams in England – their thirty-six major domestic, European and worldwide honours rank them third on the list of most decorated sides in England, ahead of Chelsea with 34. The club's first major trophy was the 1904 FA Cup,[184] though they had previously won three regional Manchester Cups before that point.[185] Their first top division league title came in the 1936–37 season,[14] with the first Charity Shield won in the following August.[14] City's first League Cup and European trophy both came at the end of the 1969–70 season, the two trophies also constituting the team's first double of any kind.[14] In the 2018–19 season, City became the first team to claim all of the major English trophies available in a single season, winning not just the Premier League, FA Cup, and League Cup, but also the Community Shield.[186] The 1970 Cup Winners' Cup victory remained City's only European trophy until their triumph in the 2022–23 UEFA Champions League.[187][65] They have reached the semi-finals of the Champions League four times overall, losing in 2016, then winning en route to their first-ever final in 2021, losing in 2022, and winning en route to their maiden European Cup title in 2023.[188][189] Manchester City jointly held the record for most second division titles with Leicester City, both clubs having won the league on seven occasions, before Leicester clinched their eighth title in 2023–24.[190] Man City's first victory was in 1898–99, and the most recent in 2001–02.[14]",

                "content": "Our editors will review what you’ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article. Manchester City FC, English men’s professional football (soccer) club based in Manchester. Manchester City achieved consistent top-division success and claimed multiple titles after Sheikh Mansour ibn Zayed Al Nahyan purchased a controlling share in the club in 2008. In 2024, under manager Pep Guardiola, the club became the first to win four consecutive Premier League championships. Manchester City traces its history to a football team founded in 1880 by members of St. Mark’s Church in Manchester. That team became Ardwick Association Football Club in 1887 and Manchester City Football Club (FC) in 1894. From 1894 to 2008 the club moved among the upper tiers of English football, regularly suffering relegation and winning promotion. It was champion of football’s second tier seven times, and it won the Football League First Division championship twice (in the 1936–37 and 1967–68 seasons). Manchester City also won the Football Association Challenge Cup (FA Cup) four times (1903–04, 1933–34, 1955–56, and 1968–69), the English League Cup twice (1969–70 and 1975–76), and the European Cup Winners’ Cup once (1969–70). Notable players from this era include Bert Trautmann, who was goalkeeper for Manchester City from 1949 to 1964, and midfielders Alan Oakes (played 1959–76) and Colin Bell (played 1966–79). After winning back-to-back promotions following the 1998–99 and 1999–2000 seasons that enabled the club to ascend to English football’s top-tier English Premier League, Manchester City was once again relegated to the sport’s second tier after their lackluster 2000–01 season. The club returned to the Premier League in 2002, however, and has remained there. In 2003 Manchester City moved from Maine Road, the stadium where it had played since 1923, to the City of Manchester Stadium (later also called Etihad Stadium). The Abu Dhabi United Group, owned by Sheikh Mansour ibn Zayed Al Nahyan, purchased a controlling stake in Manchester City FC in 2008 from Thaksin Shinawatra, a former prime minister of Thailand who had bought into the club in 2007. Mansour, a senior member of Abu Dhabi’s ruling family and one of the foremost businessmen of the United Arab Emirates, invested heavily, and the team’s performance soon improved. Manchester City won the FA Cup in 2011, its first major trophy since Mansour’s takeover. On the last day of the 2011–12 Premier League season, the team snatched the league title away from Manchester United on goal difference with the help of a stoppage time goal by Sergio Agüero against Queens Park Rangers FC. They won the Premier League again in 2013–14 and the English League Cup in 2013–14 and 2015–16. After the appointment of manager Pep Guardiola in 2016, Manchester City expanded on their success. After a trophyless first season, the club set the all-time Premier League points record with 100 points as well as single-season Premier League records for goals scored and goal differential, among others, during their title-winning 2017–18 season. They repeated in 2018–19 and won the Premier League title again in 2020–21, 2021–22, 2022–23, and 2023–24. Their four consecutive championships were a historic first in the Premier League. Manchester City won the FA Cup in 2018–19 and 2022–23. The club was also the League Cup winner in 2017–18, 2018–19, 2019–20, and 2020–21. Manchester City reached the Champions League Final for the first time in its history during the 2020–21 season, though they lost to Chelsea FC. Manchester City won the Champions League title in 2022–23. Notable players who joined Manchester City in 2008 and afterward are center back Vincent Kompany, midfielders Yaya Touré, David Silva, and Kevin De Bruyne, and forward Sergio Agüero. In 2021 Manchester City was the first club to withdraw from a controversial plan to form a new European Super League. In 2023 the Premier League announced 115 charges against Manchester City for alleged violations of financial regulations during the period 2009–18; the club has denied the charges. The Manchester City Women’s Football Club was founded in 1988. Affiliated with Manchester United FC from its creation, the women’s team formalized its partnership with the men’s team in 2012 and entered the Women’s Super League in 2013, winning the league championship in 2016. The team also won the Women’s FA Cup in the 2016–17, 2018–19, and 2019–20 seasons.",

                "content": "Chelsea is an English given name derived from the Old English place name ċealc hȳð,[1] or the modern Celcyth, meaning chalk landing place. The name evolved to Chelsea, a location on the River Thames that became a London borough known for its wealthy, socially influential residents. Many locations have been named after the English place name Chelsea.[2] The given name, a transferred use of the place name, was in use for boys in the New England region of the United States by the late 18th century and was first used for American girls in the 1840s.[2] The name was first popularized for girls in larger numbers in the United States by American comedian Chelsea Brown, who was born Lois Brown but chose Chelsea as a stage name. After Brown began appearing on the American television program Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In in 1968, the name quadrupled in use for American girls to 48 uses that year. The name debuted among the 1,000 most popular names for American girls in 1969, in 702nd place. Chelsea Morning, a 1969 hit song written about mornings in Chelsea, Manhattan by Canadian singer Joni Mitchell and later performed by Judy Collins, further popularized the name for girls with its descriptive lyrics such as \"the light poured in like butterscotch.\"[2] The name of Chelsea Clinton, daughter of American President Bill Clinton and former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, was inspired by the song when she was born in 1980. The name Chelsea increased further in popularity in the 1980s due to its use for film and television characters, such as Chelsea Thayer Wayne, a character played by Jane Fonda in the 1981 American film On Golden Pond and Chelsea Reardon, a character played by Kassie DePaiva on the American soap opera Guiding Light beginning in 1986. In 1992, the name reached peak popularity in the United States and would have been the eighth most popular name for American girls in that year if all spellings of the name were combined. The name dramatically declined in use in 1993, during the first year of Bill Clinton's presidency. At the time, it was out of fashion in the United States to name children after politicians and those who were associated with them. The name has continued to decline in use, but remained among the 1,000 most popular names for American girls in 2023.[2] Spelling variants in use in the United States include Chelsey, Chelsi, Chelsie, and Chelsy.[2] The name has also been in regular use throughout the Anglosphere, including Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, as well as in Belgium, France and Netherlands.[3]",

Originally associated with a specific location in London, Chelsea began to be used as a given name in the late 20th century, gaining popularity primarily in English-speaking countries. In terms of historical usage, Chelsea first became prominent as a place name. Chelsea, a district in West London, was recorded as Celseseya in the Domesday Book of 1086 and has a rich history dating back to the Anglo-Saxon period. Over time, the name extended beyond the geographical reference and started being used as a given name for girls.

What do these different products mean? This graphic breaks down the criteria for issuance here in central Illinois: Normally, a Winter Storm Watch will be issued in advance of the storm (usually at least 24 hours). It indicates the risk of a hazardous winter weather event has increased (at least a 50% chance of it occurring), but its occurrence, location, and/or timing is still uncertain. It is intended to provide enough lead time so you can make plans to stay safe. While rare for our area, a Blizzard Watch may be issued instead. As the event becomes imminent, a watch will normally be upgraded to either a warning or an advisory (which indicates an 80% or greater probability of occurence). A Warning indicates that conditions pose a threat to life or property, and that travel will become difficult to impossible. An Advisory indicates conditions pose a significant inconvenience, and if caution is not exercised, could lead to situations that may threaten life and/or property.

                "content": "A winter storm warning (SAME code: WSW) is a hazardous weather statement issued by Weather Forecast Offices (WFO) of the National Weather Service (NWS) in the United States to alert the public that a winter storm is occurring or is about to occur in the area, usually within 36 hours of the storm's onset. A similar warning is issued by Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) through local forecast offices of the Meteorological Service of Canada. Generally, a Winter Storm Warning is issued if the following criteria, at minimum, are forecast: snow accumulations usually between or greater than 4 to 7 inches (10 to 18 cm), or snow accumulations of usually three inches (7.6 cm) or more with significant accumulation of ice (sleet or freezing rain). In the Southern United States, where severe winter weather is much less common and any snow is a more significant event, warning criteria are lower, as low as one inch (2.5 cm) in the southernmost areas: as one goes from north to south, the accumulation estimates needed to meet warning criteria lessen. A warning can also be issued during high impact events of lesser amounts, usually early or very late in the season when trees have leaves and damage can result. Winter Storm Warnings for snow events are issued when winds are less than 35 mph (56 km/h); if the storm is expected to produce winds above this speed for at least three hours accompanying moderate to heavy snowfall, a blizzard warning will be issued instead or as an upgrade to the winter storm warning. Usually, a large accumulation of ice alone with little to no snow will result in an ice storm warning, or in the case of light freezing rain, a winter weather advisory, a freezing rain advisory, or a freezing drizzle advisory. In lieu of issuing such a statement separately, Winter Storm Warnings can include verbiage indicative of a wind chill advisory or a wind chill warning, if potentially life-threatening wind chill values (determined by local criteria) are forecast to accompany winter precipitation during the warning's duration. Beginning with the 2008–09 meteorological winter, the National Weather Service consolidated individual precipitation-specific bulletins for winter storms expected to create heavy snowfall (heavy snow warning), lake-effect snow (lake effect snow warning) or sleet accumulations (sleet warning or heavy sleet warning) within the warned area, replacing them with variants of the Winter Storm Warning product outlining the accordant hazards being forecast: Additionally, all of the above warning types may also include verbiage indicative of a wind advisory to indicate strong winds that are expected to accompany the precipitation (e.g., \"winter storm warning for heavy wet snow and strong winds\"). The generic \"winter storm warning\" terminology may be used on its own, typically to indicate that all types of winter precipitation (as a mixture or in periods before transitioning between types) are expected in high amounts; however, it may be defined generically at the forecaster's discretion regardless of whether or not this condition is met.

                "content": "Millions of Americans are bracing for severe winter weather today as Winter Storm Blair moves across the country, bringing heavy snow, high winds, and dangerous travel conditions to 15 states. It comes after the NWS said Storm Blair will produce \"Arctic outbreaks\" in many areas of the country. Heavy snow could cause widespread disruption, making travel challenging and potentially dangerous, with reduced visibility, slick roads, and the risk of accidents or delays. The 15 states under winter storm warnings are Kentucky, Indiana, Maryland, West Virginia, Kansas, Montana, Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, Alaska, West Virginia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Nebraska. The National Weather Service (NWS) reports that regions spanning from central Kansas to Indiana face a 60 percent to 90 percent chance of receiving at least eight inches of snow, but some areas, including Kansas and Missouri, could receive up to 14 inches of snow. Areas with the highest accumulations could experience their \"heaviest snowfall in at least a decade,\" according to the NWS. The agency has also warned that power outages and tree damage are likely due to the ice. Meanwhile, in Yakutat in Alaska, the NWS has warned that snow will accumulate quickly on Saturday. \"For Yakutat, snow showers over the area are expected to continue through the night with very dry and fluffy snow. Said snow is expected to accumulate quickly,\" the agency said. In areas such as Kentucky, Kansas, Maryland and West Virginia, wind gusts of up to 50 mph are possible. The NWS said in a statement on Friday that \"travel of all kinds will likely be very difficult and extremely dangerous\" in areas with expected heavy snow and/or significant icing. Travelers are advised to keep an emergency kit in their vehicles, including a flashlight, food, and water. Non-essential travel should be delayed, the NWS said, but if venturing out is unavoidable, extreme caution is essential. Drivers should prepare for sudden changes in visibility, maintain a safe distance from other vehicles, and allow extra time to reach their destinations. Drivers should also avoid sudden braking or acceleration, and exercise particular care on hills and during turns. Ensuring that vehicles are properly winterized and in good working order is also strongly recommended. In areas with ice accumulation, the NWS has recommended carrying a winter storm kit, which should include essentials such as tire chains, booster cables, a flashlight, a shovel, blankets, and extra clothing. Additionally, they advised bringing water, a first aid kit, and any other items that could assist in surviving if stranded. AccuWeather lead long-range expert Paul Pastelok said: \"This could end up being the coldest January since 2011 for the U.S. as a whole.\" He also noted that the storm's arctic outbreak will \"involve many days and not just be a quick one-to-three-day event.\" The NWS said on X: \"As we round out 2024 and head into 2025, above normal warmth across the eastern half of the U.S. will be quickly replaced by a series of Arctic outbreaks... with the coldest air of the season set to take hold through next week.\" The warnings come amid reports that a polar vortex could bring the coldest January the U.S. has faced in years. A polar vortex is a stream of cold air and could mean severe weather conditions, including heavy snowfall and freezing temperatures that could affect travel conditions and lead to school closures. \"Below-normal temperatures are favored across the central and eastern U.S. during much of January,\" the NWS said last week.

The vote for Speaker requires a candidate to receive the support of a majority of the House - 218 votes. But because of a razor-thin Republican majority in the House, Johnson could only stand to face opposition from two Republicans. Johnson already faced one hard \"no\" from Congressman Thomas Massie of Kentucky. \"You can pull all my fingernails out. You can shove bamboo up in them. You can start cutting off my fingers. I am not voting for Mike Johnson,\" Massie said Thursday in a television interview. Several other Republicans had put themselves in the \"undecided\" column heading into the vote. During the initial votes, three of those undecided Republicans voted for other lawmakers over Johnson, preventing him from reaching the 218 votes he needed. Three lawmakers - Massie, South Carolina Congressman Ralph Norman and Texas Congressman Keith Self - named other options to serve as the next speaker. That led Johnson to flee the House floor and lobby members to back him. Some 45 minutes later, he returned to the House chamber. Both Norman and Self changed their votes to back Johnson. The gavel struck and Johnson won re-election. Norman told reporters after the election that he changed his vote after speaking with Johnson in a room outside the House chamber. He said Johnson told him there would be more conservatives at the table during negotiations, fewer deals made between congressional and committee leadership without outside input from other lawmakers and enough time to read bill text before votes are scheduled. \"When we left that small room, he convinced me and Keith (Self),\" Norman said. \"He (Johnson) said I will do that, just give me the chance. He knew and I knew if it went to the second ballot it was going to get tougher and tougher.\" Another player got involved throughout the tense speaker election - President-elect Donald Trump. Norman spoke with Trump twice during the speaker vote. The first time was when fellow Republican Nancy Mace of South Carolina handed him her phone to speak with the president-elect. The second was while meeting with Johnson, Self and several others. \"(Trump) is as enthusiastic,\" Norman said of the call with the presidnet-elect. \"He said, 'Norman, we have the most opportunity we've ever had - the House, Senate, a trifecta, you don't get that opportunity.' I said, 'Mr. President I agree with you, I'm just hoping Mike has got the oomph to pull this off.\" Norman said the president-elect also said Johnson is the only one who has the likeability to win the speaker election. Self told reporters after the vote that he spoke with Trump before and after the speaker election. He said he changed his mind when Johnson pledged there would be more members, including from the far-right House Freedom Caucus, at the negotiating table. \"We shored up the reconciliation team because we know that this will be a heavy lift to get the Trump agenda across the line in the reconciliation line,\" he said. Friday marked the first day of the 119th Congress. Republicans have unified control of Washington, with majorities in both the House and Senate and with Trump returning to the White House later in January. During his acceptance speech, Johnson said that this Congress would champion the idea of America first - a slogan promoted by Trump. After Trump's re-election, he said Americans are demanding their interests are put first again. \"And we will,\" Johnson said. Voting in a new speaker is the first requirement of the new session of Congress, and without that leader in place, the chamber cannot move on to any other function. This has led to chaos in the past - including when former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy had to go through 15 rounds of voting before he was confirmed to the leadership post. Minutes before the vote on Friday, Johnson posted on X several of his plans, if elected. He promised to create a \"working group comprised of independent experts\" to work with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) that Trump named Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Republican Vivek Ramaswamy to lead. That working group, he said, would review existing audits of federal agencies and entities created by Congress and issue a report. \"If we want to restore fiscal responsibility, we must start by being transparent about the dollars that are spent, address the issues we find, and then hold those accountable who have misspent funds,\" Johnson wrote. He reportedly placed explosives in the area before changing clothes and driving into pedestrians. America's goodbye to its 39th president - which will include a stop at the US Capitol - has officially begun. An American college football player, a young aspiring nurse and a mother of a four-year-old are among the victims. Campaigners, politicians and athletes are among those receiving the US's highest civilian award. Biden decided to scrap the deal despite concerns that it could damage Washington's relations with Tokyo. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

                "content": "• Speaker chosen: Mike Johnson was re-elected speaker of the House on Friday after flipping two GOP opponents following an intervention by President-elect Donald Trump, but he’ll face a big challenge in Congress with the narrowest House majority in nearly 100 years. See how every lawmaker voted here. • Trump’s challenge: The first vote of the 119th Congress underscored the president-elect’s hold over the Republican Party — and the tall task of keeping it together over the next two years ahead of the 2026 midterms, which could threaten the GOP’s Washington trifecta. • Key procedural change: In a significant victory for Johnson, the House made it harder to remove a speaker by approving a key procedural change that requires a minimum of nine GOP lawmakers to force a vote on an ouster. Previously, it only required one member to force a vote. Our live coverage of the new Congress and presidential transition has moved here. Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy posted a picture with President-elect Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago on Friday, hours after House Speaker Mike Johnson was re-elected on the first vote – starkly different from McCarthy’s election in 2023. “Always great spending time with President Trump tonight,” McCarthy posted alongside Trump, who gave a thumbs up. In another post with the same photo over music, McCarthy wrote, “Catching up with President Trump today. 17 days to go.” McCarthy was elected speaker after 15 votes and ultimately ousted after former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz offered a motion to vacate the chair on the House floor, which prevailed. Johnson succeeded McCarthy about three weeks after McCarthy was ousted. Ahead of Friday’s vote, Johnson earned Trump’s endorsement. President-elect Donald Trump announced Friday that Morgan Ortagus would serve as “Deputy Special Presidential Envoy for Middle East Peace.” “Early on Morgan fought me for three years, but hopefully has learned her lesson,” Trump posted on Truth Social. “These things usually don’t work out, but she has strong Republican support, and I’m not doing this for me, I’m doing it for them. Let’s see what happens. She will hopefully be an asset to Steve, a great leader and talent, as we seek to bring calm and prosperity to a very troubled region. I expect great results, and soon!” The president-elect, in his post, also detailed Ortagus’ experience as an active US Navy Reserve Intelligence Officer and as spokesperson at the Department of State. Trump named his longtime friend Steve Witkoff as special envoy to the Middle East last year. Some House Republicans and Democrats are warning Speaker Mike Johnson of the challenges ahead in a tight 119th Congress where the GOP has one of the narrowest House majorities in nearly 100 years. Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert, who had declined to say if she would back Johnson before ultimately voting for him Friday, said if he “does everything right” he can stay speaker. Boebert said she would prefer if it only required one member to threaten to oust Johnson. The House voted to adopt a rules package earlier today that allows for a 9-member motion to vacate the speakership. “If there’s enough compromise that is damaging to the agenda, there very well could be a motion to vacate,” Boebert said. “Do I have a plan to do that? I’m sure that’s your next question. No, but I haven’t seen what we’re doing at this time either. I hope Mike Johnson has the most successful speakership that we’ve seen.” Democratic Rep. Pramila Jayapal warned that Johnson may have a tougher time actually governing with his narrow margin because “if you can’t get a majority, you’ve gotta work with Democrats.” “The mood is not to bail him out this time around, especially after he screwed us on the last agreement that we made and he backed away from it,” she said, a reference to the bipartisan bill to fund the federal government that was scrapped in December after President-elect Donald Trump’s intervention. GOP Rep. Troy Nehls emphasized Trump’s role in helping Johnson secure the speakership as well as House Republicans winning the majority in the first place. “Trump gave us the gavel,” Nehls said. “I think Mike Johnson and the House of Representatives, we probably owe Donald Trump.” House Speaker Mike Johnson says he has not seen a letter signed by Rep. Chip Roy and other detractors, and that he can’t comment on their demands. “I haven’t seen it. I can’t comment on it,” he said. Roy was joined in the letter by 10 other House Republicans — Reps. Andy Harris, Scott Perry, Andy Biggs, Clay Higgins, Michael Cloud, Andy Ogles, Eli Crane, Eric Burlison, Ralph Norman and Andrew Clyde — who resisted Johnson’s return to the speakership but ultimately backed him on the first ballot Friday. In the letter, the lawmakers demanded that Johnson make several commitments to “prove he will not fail to enact President Trump’s bold agenda.” These demands included legislation banning member stock trading, rolling back Biden-Harris environmental policies, and cutting spending. Johnson has insisted he did not cut any deals in order to secure the gavel. Mike Johnson will keep his job as House speaker after a dramatic vote on Friday as the 119th Congress prepares to get to work. He won in the first round — but only after flipping two GOP opponents as the vote was held open to give Republicans more time to secure support for Johnson, who was backed by President-elect Donald Trump. Now that he is elected, Johnson faces a tough legislating challenge with the narrowest House majority in nearly 100 years. However, in a key victory for Johnson, the House made it harder to oust a speaker. Included as part of the sweeping package was a procedural change that will require a minimum of nine GOP lawmakers to force a vote to oust a speaker. Previously, it only required one member to force a vote.

In the Senate: Mike Johnson was elected Speaker of the House after flipping two votes from the nine Republicans who initially refused to support him. Johnson will face a big challenge in Congress with the narrowest House majority in nearly 100 years. CNN's Jake Tapper breaks down the vote. House Republicans will meet this weekend to flesh out their legislative priorities, planning for an ambitious agenda now that the GOP controls both chambers of Congress and the White House. The new Congress was sworn in Friday, and Speaker Mike Johnson was re-elected despite a very slim majority. The lawmakers will debate how to proceed on budget reconciliation, an expedited process for considering bills that would allow the party to push through their agenda without Democratic support. The House Republicans are expected to meet at Fort McNair in Washington, DC, on Saturday, and elected leadership is set to meet in Baltimore on Sunday. The House voted to make it harder to oust a speaker on Friday – another victory for Johnson after he retained the gavel in a nail-biter of a vote earlier in the day. The chamber voted to adopt a new rules package for the 119th Congress – a lengthy document that covers a wide array of rules and regulations. Included as part of the sweeping package is a procedural change that will require a minimum of nine GOP lawmakers to force a vote to oust a speaker. Previously, it only required one member to force a vote. That one-member threshold is what led to the ouster of former Speaker Kevin McCarthy when former GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz forced a vote on his removal. The House voted 215 to 209 to approve the overall rules package. House Democratic Rep. Jim McGovern, the ranking member on the Rules Committee, criticized two additional provisions in the rules package. One is that the speaker can only entertain a motion to suspend the rules on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday – an apparent concession to the initial GOP holdouts in the speaker’s vote. House GOP leadership has sometimes brought bills – including major spending legislation – to the floor under suspension as a way of bypassing the House Rules committee, which Rep. Ralph Norman – one of the initial defectors who later flipped - sits on, lessening the panel’s power. This would limit leadership’s ability to do that. McGovern said Republicans “worked out another backroom deal,” and argued that the change could paralyze the House’s ability to move swiftly in the event of a major emergency, like a national disaster or terror attack. The congressman also said Republicans moved to “change words like child to son or daughter in our ethics rules” – with McGovern calling it “weird,” and saying, “they’re obsessed with this stuff.” Sens. Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland and Lisa Blunt Rochester of Delaware became the third and fourth Black Democratic senators in the current Congress on Friday when Vice President Kamala Harris swore them in on Friday. There have only been 14 Black senators to serve in the US Senate. From slavery and Jim Crow laws to suppression of minority voters, Black political candidates have long faced stumbling blocks. Hiram Revels, the first Black US senator, took office in the late 1800s as part of a wave of African American lawmakers during the Reconstruction era, but he was elected by the Mississippi legislature, not the state’s voters. Also on Friday, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott became the longest-serving Black US senator. He is the sole Black Republican in the Senate. Scott will serve as the first Black chairman of a Senate standing committee, leading the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, where he previously served as the ranking Republican member when Democrats held control of the chamber in the previous session. Republican Rep. Ralph Norman, who initially voted against Mike Johnson before changing his vote, said the speaker had signaled in negotiations that he would allow more GOP voices at the table under his leadership this Congress. Asked by CNN’s Manu Raju if Johnson had made any commitments that made him change his mind, Norman said the speaker promised “more conservatives will be at the table on negotiations.” “Let’s put people like Chip Roy, and I’m just using him as an example, like other people who are true…know how to negotiate and we’ll fight and we’ll put things to the American people, much like what the DOGE commission intend to do,” he said, a reference to the newly created department aimed at cutting government spending led by Vivek Ramaswamy and Elon Musk. Norman said he trusted that Johnson would “give us that platform,” and that the speaker had convinced both him and Rep. Keith Self, another Republican who voted against Johnson at first, to give him a chance. “He knew if it went to a second ballot it was going to get tougher,” Norman said. Asked what Donald Trump had said when they talked on the phone, Norman said the president-elect was “in the middle of a golf game” and brought up how the South Carolina Republican had voted for Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley in the primary. “I said, Yes sir, I did. We’re with you now and I said we will be with Mike Johnson,” Norman told reporters he responded to Trump, adding that he told him the president-elect would have to help House Republicans push his agenda. Norman said Trump had told him that Johnson was the only one who had the “likeability” to be speaker. House Speaker Mike Johnson is insisting that he did not cut deals with Reps. Ralph Norman and Keith Self to get over the finish line during today’s speaker vote. “There were no deals cut,” he told CNN’s Manu Raju. “I took suggestions and requests from all members on process reforms and changes, which I was already committed to. We made no deals to anyone, no quid pro quo to anybody on any position, or anything at all. Through the entire — I haven’t done that in 14 months, and I was not about to start today. And I think that’s important, because there needs to be transparency. Every member needs to be on a level playing field, and we maintained that today and I’m really proud of it.” Johnson said there would be a “new paradigm” and noted plans to “decentralize the speaker’s office and power.” “We’re going to have unified government with Republican control of the House, the Senate and the White House, so very different environment — 60% of the House Republicans have never served in a unified government situation. So, I had explained to them how the processes are different and the procedures, and that we are in, effectively, a law-making exercise every single day,” he said. Johnson said he had to “convince them that it will be a member-driven process.” Johnson acknowledged that President-elect Donald Trump’s support was very important. He argued Trump is “the most powerful president, certainly of the modern era, maybe in all of American history” and said the two work “very well together.” South Carolina Rep. Ralph Norman, one of the key Republican holdouts who eventually switched his vote to support Speaker Mike Johnson, said he didn’t get anything for throwing his support behind the Louisiana lawmaker. “I didn’t get anything personally. Other than a commitment that things are going to change,” he said. “There will be a drastic change from the next 14 months.” Norman said the hour delay in the vote was worth it: “Absolutely. I would do it all over again.” He said his mind was eventually changed after talking with President-elect Donald Trump and Johnson, and assurances that things would change. “We had a good discussion. We had a talk with President Trump when we got in there. I never know how this stuff is going to come out, I don’t know how people are going to vote, we got together, Mike gave us his assurances, he is going to fight for the things we think are important for the country,” Norman said. Trump shored up support from the fairway: The president-elect, who publicly backed Johnson earlier this week, also talked to other key GOP holdouts before the vote was gaveled and the speaker emerged victorious. CNN’s Manu Raju reported Friday that Trump was in the middle of his golf game when he made calls for Johnson. This post has been updated with more details on Trump’s calls to lawmakers. Oklahoma GOP Rep. Tom Cole said the drama that unfolded on Capitol Hill on Friday over electing a speaker demonstrates that it’s going to be difficult to manage the House this Congress but said the positive outcome is also a “hopeful start.” “It’s going to be a challenging Congress and that’s not something new,” Cole said. “But the fact is it all got done on one ballot and that’s a lot better than 15, which is what it took last time. So, I’ll take that and I’m pleased.” Asked if he was worried critics of House Speaker Mike Johnson, who was reelected Friday, might turn on him over the course of the next two years, he said, “I worry about everything everyday. That’s just the nature of the business, but I thought this was a very hopeful start and it went very well.” Shortly after the House chose a new speaker, a New York judge upheld Donald Trump’s conviction in the hush-money case, rejecting the president-elect’s effort to throw out the jury’s verdict because of his re-election in November. New York Judge Juan Merchan set the sentencing for January 10, 2025 and said Trump can appear virtually or in person. However, in his ruling Merchan said Trump will face no legal penalties, indicating the case is essentially over. Trump was found guilty by a jury in May on 34 counts of falsifying business records. Trump lawyers did not immediately respond to a request for comment. They previously indicated they would appeal any effort to sentence him prior to Inauguration Day on January 20. A spokesperson for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg declined to comment. The headine and the post have been updated with additional details from the ruling. Rep. Andy Biggs said Friday that President-elect Donald Trump’s endorsement of Mike Johnson was important in the House speaker’s reelection. When asked if he believes Johnson would’ve survived without Trump’s endorsement, Biggs said, “No. I think it was important.” Biggs also said he still has concerns about Johnson leading the conference but added that Trump’s endorsement was taken into consideration. “I have concerns, but President Trump said he wanted to work with Johnson, and basically — basically, that we took that into account,” Biggs said leaving the House floor. Additionally, Biggs said Johnson indicated “he’s going to work on various aspects of processes that we think need to be take place.” GOP Rep. Dusty Johnson denied on Friday that Republicans who initially resisted backing Mike Johnson for speaker received any specific commitments from him. “There wasn’t any particular deal or commitment. Nobody got anything other than Mike Johnson, who was willing to look people in the eye and tell them that we will have a more inclusive, collaborative and conservative agenda over the course of the next two years,” he told CNN’s Manu Raju. The South Dakota Republican said he didn’t want to talk about “specific asks or parts of the negotiation,” between the holdouts and leadership. “When you get the right people in the room and they want to get to yes, you absolutely can get to yes,” he said. He wouldn’t talk about “specific actions” by President-elect Donald Trump, whom CNN has reported called some last-minute holdouts before they ultimately backed the speaker. “Nobody’s got the kind of capital that President Trump does. He is clearly the captain of the football team,” he said. Rep. Keith Self, who initially cast his ballot for Florida Rep. Byron Donalds before changing his vote to House Speaker Mike Johnson, told CNN that he and Donald Trump spoke multiple times today and that they had a “lively discussion” about advancing the president-elect’s agenda. Self, who declined to provide details about the talks with Trump, said he decided to vote for Johnson because he got a commitment that GOP hardliners would be part of a major bill that Republicans want to advance using the budget process to enact aspects of the Trump agenda. “We shored up the reconciliation team because we know that this will be a heavy lift to get the Trump agenda across the line in the reconciliation package … That’s all we did,” Self said, later promising a “big, beautiful reconciliation package.” Self said the team working on the bill would include members beyond the leadership, including some members of the House Freedom Caucus, but said, “I won’t get ahead of the speaker,” when asked specifically who. Later, asked what swayed his vote, Self said he and Trump have the “same emphasis” on implementing the president-elect’s agenda. “We have got to make sure this Congress is as strong as possible when we go up against the Senate on reconciliation package, because there’s their debates on what the reconciliation package even looks like. So that’s all I wanted to do today, is to make this Congress successful for the Trump agenda,” Self said. Self said Trump did not warn him about facing a potential primary challenge over holding up Johnson’s speakership. This post has been updated with additional comments from Self. CNN’s Lauren Fox and Aileen Graef contributed reporting to this post. House Speaker Mike Johnson took his oath of office following a dramatic vote Thursday that narrowly secured him the speakership once again. Following his swearing-in, Johnson received a standing ovation from the majority of the chamber. He then administered the oath of office for all members of the House, swearing in the 119th Congress. A group of House Republicans who had been skeptical of House Speaker Mike Johnson — but ultimately came around, delivering a dramatic win on the first ballot Friday — released a letter outlining a list of demands they want Johnson to take up now that he has the speaker’s gavel. The 11 House Republicans, including Rep. Ralph Norman who was a holdout until the last minute, called on Johnson to add session days to the House calendar, ensure that any reconciliation package includes significant spending cuts, and stop putting bills on the floor that rely heavily on Democratic support, or that come ahead of the 72 hours members are allotted to review legislation. “Today we voted for Mike Johnson for Speaker of the House because of our steadfast support of President Trump and to ensure the timely certification of his electors,” the lawmakers wrote. “We did this despite our sincere reservations regarding the Speaker’s track record over the last 15 months.” Listing out their legislative priorities, the lawmakers said Johnson has “zero room for error.” House Speaker Mike Johnson said in his first remarks following his reelection to the speakership that the new Congress will “listen to the voices of the people.” “In recent months, we’ve witnessed something happening — something that’s really remarkable, a political moment in our modern history: A groundswell Americans from every state, race and religion who now demand that we put the interest of Americans first again,” Johnson said. “And we will.” Johnson also stressed that “the number one priority” under his leadership will be “defending our nation’s borders.” “In coordination with President Trump, this Congress will give our border and immigration enforcement agents the resources that they need to do their job,” Johnson outlined. “We will secure the border. We will deport dangerous, criminal, illegal aliens and finally finish building the border wall.” Johnson later in his remarks read a prayer entitled “Thomas Jefferson’s Prayer for the Nation.” “We will not fail. We cannot fail. We are all in this together. Our nation is counting on us to band together and solve these problems and get this done,” Johnson said after reading the prayer. “I’ve said before that I believe God has elevated each one of you, that is my belief, to your positions of leadership and it’s an act of providence that you’ve all been placed in your specific roles in this specific moment at this historic time.” Newly elected House Speaker Mike Johnson said it is “the great honor of his life” to serve the House and noted that it is “a momentous time” in the nation’s history. In his first remarks after being elected speaker on Friday, he noted that the 250th anniversary of the country’s founding will occur during the 119th Congress. “And in these two and a half centuries, we’ve been reminded repeatedly that freedom is never free. We have stood tall as the greatest nation on the face of the earth,” Johnson said, adding the United States was the freest and most benevolent nation that has ever been.“It’s not by happenstance. We are the ones who settled the West. We are the ones who ended slavery, who laid the transcontinental railroad, who gave women the right to vote, who won two world wars, who landed on the moon and who won the Cold War. Throughout our history, we have done what no one thought was possible. And still at 250 years old, our nation is actually a young nation.” In his first remarks after being reelected as House speaker, Rep. Mike Johnson of Louisiana called for a moment of silence to mark the New Year’s Day terrorist attack in New Orleans. “Of course, these are difficult days in our home state of Louisiana, where I come from,” Johnson said in the House. “We all know about the terrorist attack in New Orleans and it’s really shaken our state. People are reeling from that attack.” The attacker rammed a pickup truck into a crowd, which killed 14 people and injuring dozens more. President-elect Donald Trump congratulated Rep. Mike Johnson after the Republican from Louisiana was elected speaker on Friday. “Congratulations to Speaker Mike Johnson for receiving an unprecedented Vote of Confidence in Congress. Mike will be a Great Speaker, and our Country will be the beneficiary. The People of America have waited four years for Common Sense, Strength, and Leadership. They’ll get it now, and America will be greater than ever before!” Trump posted on Truth Social. The president-elect threw his support behind Johnson earlier this week. He spoke to Reps. Ralph Norman and Keith Self as Republicans worked to convince them to vote for Johnson and give him the victory on the first ballot, multiple sources told CNN. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries urged lawmakers to “put down partisan swords and pick up bipartisan plowshares” as he introduced House Speaker Mike Johnson, who won a dramatic vote to keep the gavel. “It’s time for us to come together, not as Democrats or Republicans, but as Americans, to get things done for the people,” Jeffries said. He vowed that House Democrats would work to find common ground with Republicans “on any issue, whenever and wherever possible.” Jeffries laid out an agenda of top issues for his party, including enacting policies that benefit the middle class, lowering housing costs and securing the country’s borders. Still, with Republicans taking control of both chambers of Congress and the presidency, Jeffries warned that Democrats will “push back against far right extremism whenever necessary” and protect programs like Social Security and Medicare. “Our position is that it is not acceptable to cut Social Security, cut Medicare, cut Medicaid, cut veterans benefits, or cut nutritional assistance from children and families in order to pay for massive tax breaks for billionaires and wealthy corporations,” Jeffries said. Jeffries also acknowledged Rep. Nancy Pelosi, who was back in the chamber after breaking her hip. This post has been updated with more remarks from Jeffries. After being elected speaker of the House on the first ballot, Mike Johnson is set to face a big challenge in Congress, with the most narrow House majority in nearly 100 years. CNN Washington Bureau Chief and Political Director David Chalian says Johnson knows this. “He understands the problematic path he has ahead to get Trump’s legislative agenda through in a clean way in this first year of full Republican control in Washington,” Chalian said of Johnson after his dramatic victory Friday. Chalian said he doesn’t think voters “put too much stock in all of this.” Instead, he argued, voters “will focus a lot more on what this new unified Republican control of Washington attempts to deliver for the American people.” President-elect Donald Trump spoke to Reps. Ralph Norman and Keith Self as Republicans worked to convince them to vote for House Speaker Mike Johnson and give Johnson the victory on the first ballot, multiple sources told CNN. GOP Rep. Nancy Mace called Trump, one of the sources told CNN, who then spoke directly to the holdouts. The president-elect threw his support behind Johnson earlier this week. Trump told reporters Tuesday night that he would make calls on Johnson’s behalf to fellow Republicans, if necessary. House Speaker Mike Johnson said he did not make any promises to GOP Reps. Keith Self and Ralph Norman, who flipped their votes and allowed Johnson to clinch speakership in the first round of voting. Johnson, who could only lose one vote with the slim GOP majority, needed the support of Self and Norman as Republican Rep. Thomas Massie maintained his opposition. Rep. Andy Ogles, a Republican from Tennessee, also said that no deals were made to get Johnson’s detractors on board, adding that instead, it “was just a matter of getting it done” and a result of “persistence.” The reelected speaker told CNN that he is “ready to get to work.” In a dramatic turn of events, lawmakers have elected Mike Johnson as House speaker on the first ballot. Key GOP detractors flipped their votes to back Johnson at the last minute, after the Louisiana Republican was initially on track to lose. He ultimately won with 218 votes. While Johnson will keep the gavel, he’ll face a big challenge in Congress with the narrowest House majority in nearly 100 years. How it unfolded: After the initial roll call vote, Johnson had come up short, with three GOP defections — more than he could afford to lose. Rep. Thomas Massie had voted for Rep. Tom Emmer; Rep. Ralph Norman had voted for Rep. Jim Jordan; and Rep. Keith Self had voted for Rep. Byron Donalds. With all members voting, Johnson could only afford a single GOP defection. But after everyone had voted, the vote was held open for an extended period of time — meaning that it was not gaveled to an official close — and Johnson worked to lock down the votes. Then, Self and Norman flipped their votes in support of Johnson. This post has been updated with additional details on how the vote unfolded. The White House declined to weigh in on the unfolding fight for the House speaker’s gavel on Capitol Hill. Instead, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters during Friday’s press briefing it was focused on the president’s domestic agenda for the remainder of his term in office. “Look, we’ve always been very clear from here, from this administration, that we do not inject ourselves into any leadership election that is happening in Congress,” she said, adding that it “doesn’t matter if it’s a Democrat or Republican, we stay out of it.” “The president is going to continue to focus on the job that he has ahead, 17 days of a jam-packed schedule, focusing on the American people. We’re going to let Congress do their business,” Jean-Pierre said. But in 2023, as the House GOP slugged it out over who would serve as speaker, White House spokesperson Andrew Bates lambasted Republicans for “falling over one another to find out who can be the most erratic and out of step with the priorities of working families.” In a statement to reporters at the time, he urged lawmakers “to get their act together and join this president at the adults table.” While Mike Johnson is on track to lose, the first round of voting in the speaker’s election has not yet been gaveled to an official close. As a result, members continue to mill around on the floor talking and having side conversations. This is one way for House GOP leadership to buy more time to try to talk to holdouts and win them over since they can’t initiate a brief recess like they would typically be able to. That’s because the new House has not yet adopted formal rules to govern itself. The only option to take a formal break would be to have the entire chamber vote to adjourn, a more complicated option than just holding this vote open longer. Rep. Stephanie Bice, an ally of Johnson, said that Reps. Ralph Norman and Keith Self are meeting with Johnson now. They both voted for another lawmaker besides Johnson during the vote. She also said that they are holding the vote open in hopes that they can change Norman and Self’s votes, and still technically have Johnson elected “on the first ballot.” Former Speaker Nancy Pelosi slowly walked onto the floor of the US Capitol on Friday, weeks after undergoing surgery for a broken hip, as dozens of lawmakers cheered and offered her a standing ovation. Democrats cheered for her again when she stood up to cast a vote for Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries in the House’s tight-margin speaker’s race. Wearing a pair of flats instead of heels, she was seen holding herself up on a table to stand and speak with members before the first vote began. Pelosi, 84, underwent a “successful” hip replacement surgery after being admitted to a hospital in Luxembourg following a fall on the stairs, CNN previously reported. The US military medevacked the former House speaker from Luxembourg to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany, according to a defense official. With House members instructed to return immediately for a second speaker vote, two of Speaker Mike Johnson’s key allies, Rep. Dusty Johnson and Bryan Steil, have been having an animated conversation with some of the Freedom Caucus members who have sought concessions from Johnson. Rep. Andy Harris, the group’s leader, spoke with Dusty Johnson for several minutes as the others looked on, with Harris repeatedly shaking his head. Meanwhile, several Republicans, including Reps. Steve Womack, Greg Murphy, Brian Fitzpatrick and Robert Aderholt ,approached Johnson on the floor after the first vote appeared to fail to offer handshakes and pats on the back. They appeared to be offering him words of encouragement, while some seemed frustrated, shaking their head at the result. While the first House speaker vote has not yet been called, Speaker Mike Johnson is on track to lose with the current breakdown, and the House is poised to go immediately into a second vote without a break. The House Democratic whip has sent a notice to members to return to the floor immediately to be ready for a second roll call vote. Multiple holdouts ultimately voted for House Speaker Mike Johnson in dramatic fashion, after initially skipping their turn in what appeared to be a short-lived protest of the speaker. Seven Republicans did not vote during the initial roll call: Reps. Andy Biggs, Andrew Clyde, Michael Cloud, Paul Gosar, Andy Harris and Chip Roy. Rep. Michael Waltz appeared to accidentally miss his turn. At the end of the roll call, all seven were given a final chance to vote and all seven voted for Johnson. One of the holdouts, Clyde, walked down the aisle to speak his vote directly to the clerk, carrying what appeared to be a Bible. One of Johnson’s whips in his speaker race, Rep. Dusty Johnson, was seen in an animated back-and-forth conversation with Roy in the back of the chamber. Rep. Dusty Johnson was also talking to Rep. Keith Self — who opposed Johnson on the floor — and Clyde. Johnson left the House chamber as it appeared likely he did not secure enough votes to keep his gavel on the first ballot. In the back of the chamber, many of the defectors continued to stand together quietly. The state of play: At this point, Johnson needs to flip Reps. Thomas Massie, Ralph Norman or Self — all who did not vote for Johnson. Further complicating matters, Norman and Self had not previously communicated their positions to the speaker, according to multiple GOP sources. Speaker Mike Johnson appears to be on track to lose the first round of voting for House speaker after losing support from at least three GOP members. Rep. Keith Self — also standing in the center of the aisle — voted for fellow Freedom Caucus member Byron Donalds. Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Rep. Ralph Norman of North Carolina also did not back Johnson, voting for Reps. Tom Emmer and Jim Jordan, respectively. Beyond the three GOP votes for other candidates, multiple Republicans initially abstained. Self has been standing near the other defections, though he has mostly been quiet and kept to himself. Another prior holdout, Rep. Victoria Spartz, voted for Johnson. Donalds told CNN ahead of the vote that lawmakers had approached him about whether he would be interested in running for speaker, but said he wasn’t entertaining the idea. Remember: Johnson could only afford a single GOP defection if every lawmaker shows up and votes. This post has been updated with additional details on the state of the vote. Republican Rep. Ralph Norman of South Carolina voted for Rep. Jim Jordan in the race for speaker of the House — making two GOP members who have voted against Mike Johnson. Rep. Thomas Massie also voted for someone else, throwing his support behind Rep. Tom Emmer. At least six Republican members so far have skipped their turn to vote, putting the chamber into suspense about whether Mike Johnson can secure the votes for speaker on the first ballot. Those members — GOP Reps. Andy Biggs, Andrew Clyde, Michael Cloud, Paul Gosar, Andy Harris and Chip Roy — all were silent when their names were called, though they will have another chance to vote at the end of the roll call. Keep in mind: As the vote was set to begin, GOP Rep. Tim Burchett vaguely predicted on X that the speaker contest would “go multiple rounds” but did not say how he planned to vote. Burchett had declined to tell reporters his position ahead of the vote, saying he was truly undecided and would “pray” on the decision. Scenes from the chamber: Biggs was standing next to Clyde and Harris — two other Freedom Caucus members who have not publicly committed to Johnson — as the clerk read his name. Biggs continued to stand, not moving or speaking, as his name was called. The next GOP member to be called, Rep. Sheri Biggs of South Carolina, voted for Johnson, who she declared to be “Trump’s endorsed candidate” — as other members in the chamber applauded. It is not clear if Gosar intentionally skipped his turn. He had been standing in the back of the chamber near fellow Freedom Caucus members Biggs and Harris. Harris intentionally chose not to vote. Two feet away from where Biggs and Burchett chatting, Harris stood silent in his spot at the back of the chamber as the clerk read his name several times. Burchett — who helped oust former Speaker Kevin McCarthy — stood in the aisle, speaking to his close friend GOP Rep. Nancy Mace, as the roll call began. He then voted for Johnson. GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert also voted for Mike Johnson: “Don’t let us down Mr. Speaker,” she said as she cast her vote. Another previously undecided member, GOP Rep. Eric Burlison, also voted for Johnson on first ballot. CNN’s Manu Raju said “this is very much a strategic decision not to vote” from the members. “They are there and decided not to vote. So the question is, Dana, they’ll have a chance to vote at the end of this process. Will they vote yes or will they continue to hold out?” Raju told CNN’s Dana Bash.

Thomas Massie of Kentucky did not vote for Mike Johnson for the House speakership, upholding his vow not to back Johnson. Johnson faces tough vote math with the narrowest House majority in nearly 100 years, leaving little room for error. Massie instead voted for GOP Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota, the House majority whip who expressed confidence earlier Friday that Johnson will hold on to the gavel. As majority whip, Emmer has experience with keeping the GOP’s narrow majority in line. In January 2023, Emmer helped hammer out the negotiations between the 20 hardliners and the speaker’s office that eventually won former Speaker Kevin McCarthy the gavel after 15 ballots, according to former Republican Rep. Patrick McHenry. Following McCarthy’s historic ouster, Emmer sought the speakership himself, eventually withdrawing his bid, which paved the way for Johnson to clinch the post. The House is voting now to elect its speaker, as Rep. Mike Johnson is vying to retain the gavel. He faces tough vote math with the narrowest House majority in nearly 100 years, leaving little room for error. Johnson, who was backed by President-elect Donald Trump, can only afford a single GOP defection if every lawmaker shows up and votes, and one House Republican — Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky — has already said he won’t vote for him. How many votes are needed for Johnson to win: To be elected speaker, a candidate must win a majority of votes out of all votes cast. If all 435 members of the House vote, then a majority is 218 votes. There is expected to be one vacancy when the House convenes for the vote. Former GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida has said he won’t take the seat he was elected to in the new Congress. That leaves 434 members with 219 Republicans and 215 Democrats. If all 434 vote, it takes 218 to win. Track the House speaker vote here. As GOP Rep. Lisa McClain formally nominated Speaker Mike Johnson, most of the Republican conference gave him a standing ovation. But several House Republicans — Reps. Tim Burchett, Andy Biggs and Eli Crane — remained seated through the speech and the standing ovation, though they were still seen clapping, at times, for Johnson from their seats. Democratic Rep. Pete Aguilar of California, who is the Democratic caucus chair, is delivering a nominating speech for Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries for speaker. The nomination comes as House Speaker Mike Johnson faces a critical vote soon in his attempts to retain the speakership. “There is only one leader who understands the needs of the working people and has lived the American dream himself, and is committed to ensuring its promise for future generations,” Aguilar said. “There is only one leader who knows how to negotiate a bipartisan deal and then stick to that deal. House Democrats are united behind the most powerful legislative leader in this chamber, Hakeem Jeffries of Brooklyn.” Aguilar vowed to work with the upcoming administration, while highlighting the importance of House Democrats in passing legislation. “We will work with the incoming administration to make life better, safer and more affordable for working families,” Aguilar said. GOP Rep. Lisa McClain of Michigan nominated Rep. Mike Johnson for House speaker. Johnson, the current speaker, is looking to keep the gavel. Johnson was endorsed by President-elect Donald Trump, but he could be presented with a challenge given the narrow House GOP majority. Republicans are set to take over control of the House and the Senate. McClain, who is the party’s conference chair, said this — with Johnson as speaker — gives lawmakers the opportunity to “put America first again.” McClain defended Johnson, saying, “None of us will get exactly what we want.” “Over 14 months ago, Mike Johnson took on a daunting task. No speaker is perfect and no one will ever be. However, achieving perfection requires incremental gains and hard decisions along the way,” she said, calling on Republicans to rally around Johnson. McClain also defended Johnson’s principles and values, saying he “knows our brightest days are still ahead of us” and expressed confidence that Johnson will “lead us through another successful Republican majority.” This post has been updated with additional remarks. Democratic Rep. Hank Johnson of Georgia was not present during the quorum call, but has arrived, according to a Democratic source. He will be able to vote for House speaker. Why this is key: This means that the expected majority threshold will be 218 and Johnson will only be able to lose one GOP vote against him if all other lawmakers vote. Senators were sworn in alphabetically, in groups, by Vice President Kamala Harris, and then signed the oath book. Some were escorted by former senators from their state, or by the outgoing senator who they were replacing. Sen. Bernie Moreno of Ohio was escorted by Vice President-elect JD Vance. West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice was not sworn in to the Senate today. He announced on December 26 that he will remain the governor of his state until next week, when Governor-elect Patrick Morrisey is sworn in. In an apparent bid to win over detractors ahead of the speaker vote, House Speaker Mike Johnson posted to X that he will set up a working group for spending and government reform, among other commitments. This appears to be in response to demands from GOP Rep. Victoria Spartz and other GOP holdouts. Johnson’s vow does not include any specific commitments on legislation on the floor or committee rosters. He has repeatedly said he would not make private deals to win votes. Johnson’s public commitment comes as several undecided GOP members have been getting into line behind the speaker in the minutes before the vote. And Spartz posted to X in response to Johnson’s post saying, “I appreciate @SpeakerJohnson’s public commitment to the American people to deliver on President Trump’s agenda and drain the swamp.” Vice President Kamala Harris has called for the Senate to come to order, as the 119th Congress opens on Friday. Former senators, current senators and soon-to-be senators flooded the chamber on Friday, including former Majority Leader Trent Lott, and former Sens. Rob Portman, Dean Heller, and Bob Corker. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer shook hands with incoming Senate Republican Leader John Thune just before Chaplain Barry Black led the Senate in prayer. Black is returning to the Senate for the first time since he suffered a brain bleed last month. Ahead of the Senate being called to order, senators milled about and caught up with current and former colleagues. When now former-Sen. Tom Carper introduced Sen. Mitch McConnell to Sen. Lisa Blunt Rochester, McConnell shook her hand warmly and told her, “I hope you learn to love the Senate.” Thune also huddled with McConnell on the floor for a few minutes before the proceedings. GOP Rep. Tim Burchett said he thinks voting for speaker of the House will go into multiple rounds. “I think it doesn’t really matter what I, what I’m going to do. I think you’ll see members pass, and then we’ll go into another round,” he said. Burchett would not disclose which members have told him how they are voting or how he would vote but did say some are still going vote no. As lawmakers enter the chamber ahead of the speaker’s vote, at least two House Republicans who had raised concerns about Mike Johnson now tell CNN they will support him. GOP Rep. Eli Crane told CNN he will be supporting Johnson because President-elect Donald Trump backs him, indicating that Trump’s endorsement has a lot of weight. “I’m going to support the president,” Crane told CNN, confirming that meant he would support Johnson. GOP Rep. Greg Steube also told CNN he will support Johnson as he walked onto the floor. There are still a number of holdouts who have not said publicly how they will vote, but Crane and Steube are an early indication that Republicans could fall in line and keep Johnson as their speaker. Remember: To be elected speaker, a candidate must win a majority of votes out of all votes cast. There is one vacancy expected when the House convenes — with former GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz saying he won’t take the seat he was elected to in the new Congress — leaving 434 members, with 219 Republicans and 215 Democrats. If all 434 vote, it takes 218 to win. Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky has already said he won’t vote for Johnson, appearing to leave no further room for error. A packed House chamber was buzzing in anticipation Friday as new and returning members greeted each other ahead of the speaker’s vote. Many brought their families, with at least two dozen babies and kids, some clutching teddy bears, seen in the chamber. Speaker Mike Johnson personally waved hello to a group of young children in the well of the chamber shortly after he entered. Several of Johnson’s holdouts huddled near the back of the chamber. This includes Rep. Chip Roy, Andy Ogles, Eli Crane, Andrew Clyde and Scott Perry. Many of them are seated together. As expected, Democrats have full attendance, according to a leadership source. As former Speaker Nancy Pelosi slowly walked onto the floor weeks after her hip surgery, dozens of Democrats cheered and offered her a standing ovation. House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters ahead of the speaker’s vote that he believes he has the votes to hold onto his job and said he plans to stick it out even if it takes multiple rounds. “I think we are there. We’ll find out very soon” Johnson said when asked about the whip count. Johnson brushed off the idea that he couldn’t clinch the votes on the first round, telling reporters, “It says nothing it’s part of the process but I expect we’ll will get it done.” Johnson said President-elect Donald Trump has been helpful as he has tried to win over House Republicans. “Well you’ve seen his public statements, I think privately he’s talked with members,” Johnson said. Vowing to stick it out, regardless of how many rounds of voting it takes, Johnson said, “We have to get this job done and unify the Congress. And I’m here for the long haul.” Johnson reiterated that he hasn’t made any side deals with lawmakers to secure their votes: “I have made no deals with anyone. And I’m very proud to say that.” GOP Rep. Steve Womack warned on Friday morning of the stakes if the House GOP conference fails to quickly elect Mike Johnson to be speaker. “There will be many an opportunity over the course of the next several months as we prosecute an agenda to stumble, shoot ourselves in the foot. We can’t rely on help from the left so we’ve got to carry this on our own,” he told CNN. He said Republicans have a chance to project unity today by electing Johnson in one round of votes. “Put it in the bank and move on to our legislative agenda,” he said. Pressed by Raju on what message it would send if it takes more than one round of votes to select a speaker, Womack answered “that we’re not ready to govern. That the people of America have given us this opportunity and that we’re not prepared for it.” CNN has reported Johnson’s team has been growing increasingly optimistic that he’ll ultimately get the necessary votes and believe conversations with holdouts are headed in the right direction. Central to their argument is the need to be able to quickly certify the election and execute on Trump’s agenda, especially with a narrow margin. GOP Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who is currently the sole public “no” vote against House Speaker Mike Johnson, said if one other member votes against him, it will “embolden half a dozen more” in a second vote. “I’d say there’s a 70% chance Mike Johnson is going to be speaker, that everybody but me will eventually vote for him, even though they know he’s the wrong guy, because that’s just the way the swamp works,” Massie told host Steve Deace on “The Glenn Beck Program.” “If one more person joins me, I think that will embolden half a dozen more. And I think the second round he loses more votes. The third round he loses more votes. President Trump calls him up, says Mike, I thought you were the guy, turns out you’re not the guy, step out of the way,” he said. “I think Mike will keep trying until Trump tells him to give up,” he added. Trump has publicly endorsed Johnson, and allies have indicated he won’t have patience for a dragged out process. Massie said that if Johnson fails to keep the gavel, Republicans could elect a new speaker tonight or over the weekend, saying “there are at least three qualified candidates.” “I’m not going anywhere. I have plans to stay here this weekend. We’re going to be right back here on Monday,” the Kentucky lawmaker said. Massie declined to name the alternative candidates he would support, but rejected the notion that Johnson is the only one who can earn support of 218 members. “Given that I’m a lightning rod, I don’t want to transfer that lightning to a candidate, and then they’ll be ‘persona non grata’ and be disqualified by virtue of me calling their name right here on your radio show,” Massie said. “It’s ridiculous to say that Mike Johnson, out of 219 Republicans is the only one who can be elected to speaker and that’s why we should elect him.” The new Congress will start at noon ET on January 3, and the first major item of business in the House is to elect a speaker. This happens before members are even sworn in. Before voting can start, candidates must be nominated. GOP Rep. Lisa McClain of Michigan is expected to give a nominating speech for Johnson, and Democratic Rep. Pete Aguilar of California is expected to give a nominating speech for House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries. But any member can nominate anyone, so additional candidates could be nominated. During the vote, a clerk will call on members by name in alphabetical order and each will have the chance to say which candidate they support. This is also when members could opt to say “present” instead of voting for a candidate. At the end, any members who did not vote will be given the opportunity to do so, and if any member wants to change their vote, they can. How many votes Johnson needs to win: Mike Johnson is vying to retain the gavel and has President-elect Donald Trump’s endorsement, but he faces tough vote math with the narrowest House majority in nearly 100 years, leaving little room for error. Johnson can only afford a single GOP defection if every lawmaker shows up and votes, and one House Republican. To be elected speaker, a candidate must win a majority of votes out of all votes cast. If all 435 members of the House vote, then a majority is 218 votes. There is expected to be one vacancy when the House convenes for the vote. Former GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida has said he won’t take the seat he was elected to in the new Congress. That leaves 434 members with 219 Republicans and 215 Democrats. If all 434 vote, it takes 218 to win. Johnson’s allies are projecting confidence he’ll be able to secure the speakership, but even they are bracing for the possibility that it could go into multiple rounds of voting, leading to a drawn-out floor fight. House Speaker Mike Johnson and his allies have been increasingly optimistic throughout the morning on Friday, as no other GOP lawmakers, besides Rep. Thomas Massie, have communicated to the speaker’s office they will definitively oppose him on the floor, according to multiple GOP sources. While Republican leadership is not ruling out potential drama given the historically narrow margins for securing the speakership, there is rising confidence Johnson will secure the gavel by the end of day Friday. Even one of Johnson’s holdouts — GOP Rep. Andy Ogles — predicted that Johnson would keep his gavel on Friday, and the only question was how many ballots it would take. The upbeat tone is notable from Ogles, who said he will not publicly reveal whether he plans to support Johnson on the floor. “I think Mike’s gonna be fine,” the Tennessee lawmaker said. “It just depends if it’s gonna be one or three” ballots. Ogles, a member of the House Freedom Caucus, is among a group of members pushing for commitments from Johnson in the 119th Congress. Asked about his personal priorities, Ogles said he wants Congress to pay for any emergency spending, such as natural disaster relief or international aid. “I’d say one of the biggest things is any supplemental, there needs to be a pay-for,” Ogles said. Republican Rep. Jim Jordan exuded optimism about the vote, saying he thought it would take one ballot. “I think so, I think probably Thomas is, as far as I know, Thomas is the only ‘no’ vote,” he said, referring to Massie. Remember: To be elected speaker, a candidate must win a majority of votes out of all votes cast. There is one vacancy expected when the House convenes — with former GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz saying he won’t take the seat he was elected to in the new Congress — leaving 434 members, with 219 Republicans and 215 Democrats. If all 434 vote, it takes 218 to win. This post has been updated with additional details. New Senate Majority Leader John Thune will stress his commitment to preserving the 60 votes threshold to overcome a filibuster on legislation, according to excerpts provided by his office from his maiden speech expected to be delivered on the floor at about 1 p.m. ET. “And one of my priorities as leader will be to ensure that the Senate stays the Senate,” the Republican from South Dakota will say. “That means preserving the legislative filibuster – the Senate rule that today has perhaps the greatest impact in preserving the Founders’ vision of the Senate.” Remember: President-elect Donald Trump and Senate Democrats have pushed to weaken the filibuster for bills as has already happened for nominations and Thune could face pressure from Trump to ditch it if Democrats are able to block bills on the floor. “It also means restoring the Senate as a place of discussion and deliberation,” Thune will say. Below are additional excerpts from his speech highlighting his priorities in the new Congress: “That includes empowering committees, restoring regular order, and engaging in extended debate on the Senate floor, where all members should have a chance to make their voices – and the voices of their constituents – heard.” Walking into House Speaker Mike Johnson’s office moments ago, House Majority Whip Tom Emmer was confident Johnson has the votes to keep the gavel. “Yep, oh yeah,” the Minnesota Republican said, when asked by CNN. To be elected speaker, Johnson must win a majority of votes out of all votes cast. There is expected to be one vacancy when the House convenes for the vote. Former GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida has said he won’t take the seat he was elected to in the new Congress. That leaves 434 members with 219 Republicans and 215 Democrats. If all 434 vote, it takes 218 to win. Johnson can only afford a single GOP defection if every lawmaker shows up and votes, and one House Republican — Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky — has already said he won’t vote for him, while roughly a dozen more have not committed to supporting him. West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice will not be sworn in to the US Senate today. According to an announcement released over the holidays, he has decided to delay his swearing in until after Governor-elect Patrick Morrissey is sworn in, in order to preserve the “continuity of government.” Morrisey will be sworn in on January 13. GOP Sen. Shelley Moore Capito praised Justice’s decision, saying in a statement: “I very much respect Governor Justice’s decision to honor his commitment to complete his term as Governor of the State of West Virginia.” “I am looking forward to serving with Senator Justice as there is much to do to advance President Trump’s agenda on behalf of all West Virginians,” she added. Given that decision, 99 senators will be sworn in this week, not 100. Rep. Mark Amodei, a Republican from Nevada who backs House Speaker Mike Johnson, tells CNN he predicts a few rounds of voting in the speaker’s race today but ultimately believes Johnson will prevail — if for no other reason than Republicans know what a drawn-out contest can cost the party. “Just the nature of this. So that’s fine. It will take two or three,” he said of his prediction for how many rounds it takes for Johnson to win. Amodei warns that President-elect Donald Trump won’t be patient with members who want to drag this out. He believes Trump’s influence could go a long way to shoring up support for Johnson. “Nobody comes to mind,” he said, when asked if there was someone better for the job. “I think his demeanor is something that is an absolute benefit,” he said, adding “there is no heir apparent.” “Finding an heir apparent would be phenomenally time-consuming — we know from experience — so therefore, at the end of the day, I think he’s your guy.” He also warned against making GOP Rep. Chip Roy — a holdout who has publicly criticized Johnson — the Rules Committee chairman, an idea that has been floated by some members of the conference, arguing he hasn’t proven to be a cooperative member on the committee so far, as he often votes against rules. Ahead of today’s House speaker vote, President-elect Donald Trump praised Mike Johnson to CNN and indicated that he is confident that Johnson will be successful. “I think the speaker will do very well. He’s a fine man. He’s a very fine individual, he’s religious, he’s smart, he’s strong. Everybody likes him. Everybody respects him,” Trump said in a brief phone interview. The president-elect confirmed CNN’s reporting that he had been in touch with Republican holdouts, including GOP Rep. Chip Roy. When asked what he was telling these Republicans, Trump said he wasn’t “telling them anything.” “I’m just saying, Look, we had the greatest presidential election. We won the popular vote by millions of votes. We had a great, we had a great election, and it would be nice to cement the election with an election here. I mean, that would just be a big, beautiful exclamation point,” he said. When asked specifically about his conversations with Roy, Trump noted that he thought “Chip Roy will do what’s right for the country” and said he would be watching the vote today. In an indication that he is all in for Johnson, Trump said there was no one else he was eyeing for speaker at this time should it not work out, reiterating that he thinks Johnson will be successful. The 119th Congress begins today, ushering in a new era of Republican control in Washington that will start with a high-stakes leadership fight to pick the next House speaker. Mike Johnson is vying to retain the gavel and has President-elect Donald Trump’s endorsement, but he faces tough vote math with the narrowest House majority in nearly 100 years, leaving little room for error. Johnson can only afford a single GOP defection if every lawmaker shows up and votes, and one House Republican — Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky — has already said he won’t vote for him, while roughly a dozen more have not committed to supporting him. Looming over the race is the question of what happens if the House has not yet elected a speaker by Monday, January 6, the day lawmakers are supposed to count electoral votes and finalize the results of the presidential election — a scenario that would put Congress into unprecedented territory. How many votes to win? To be elected speaker, a candidate must win a majority of votes out of all votes cast. If all 435 members of the House vote, then a majority is 218 votes. There is expected to be one vacancy when the House convenes for the vote. Former GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida has said he won’t take the seat he was elected to in the new Congress. That leaves 434 members with 219 Republicans and 215 Democrats. If all 434 vote, it takes 218 to win. But if any members do not vote or vote “present” — which is not really a vote at all — the number needed to win can go down. That’s because absences and “present” votes do not count toward the overall total used to calculate the majority threshold. A defiant Speaker Mike Johnson said he is unwilling to “make deals” with fellow Republicans to secure votes, taking a dramatically different strategy than his predecessor Kevin McCarthy just hours before the vote to secure the gavel. “My simple message to my colleagues is, make suggestions about process improvements, we’re open to that at all times. But I don’t make deals with anyone. There’s no quid for pro here. I don’t do anything in exchange for a vote,” Johnson said to reporters outside his office. The Louisiana Republican is making clear that he will not engage in side deals – such as the suggestion from some conservatives that one holdout, GOP Rep. Chip Roy, should take over the powerful House Rules Committee. In recent days, the speaker has been having conversations with the roughly half dozen GOP holdouts about process deforms – such as voting on single-issue spending bills or reforming the suspension calendar. The Freedom Caucus, in particular, has a list of demands related to cutting spending and chamber processes. But Johnson insists he will not be making specific commitments, marking a wholly different approach than McCarthy. If he succeeds, it would leave Johnson without the tradeoffs that McCarthy made to secure his gavel two years ago – which ultimately weakened him enough to coat McCarthy his gavel. Instead, Johnson is making the argument that backing him for speaker will mean supporting President-elect Donald Trump. “I’m talking with all members and telling them we need to unify so we can move the Trump agenda,” Johnson told reporters. Speaker Mike Johnson will face a major challenge in the new Congress – the narrowest House majority in nearly 100 years. That is, if he can keep the gavel. Republicans will soon control the House, Senate and White House. But thin margins could imperil President-elect Donald Trump’s agenda. And Johnson has little room for error when the House votes on Friday to elect a speaker for the new Congress. Republicans won 220 House seats in the November elections, while Democrats won 215, the most narrowly divided House majority since the outset of the Great Depression, almost a century ago. And the margin is set to quickly shrink even further. When the House convenes, the partisan breakdown is expected to be 219 to 215 since former GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida has said he’s not returning to Congress. From there, the majority is on track to drop to 217 to 215 with two GOP lawmakers expected to join the Trump administration. At that point, House Republicans would not be able to afford a single defection to pass legislation along party lines until the vacancies are filled. Read the full story here. A new batch of lawmakers will be sworn in today and many of them are making history. Both parties are set to welcome a diverse group of newly elected lawmakers in Congress.

Read about more history-makers joining Congress here. Republican lawmakers are weighing in ahead of the vote for speaker of the House, as Mike Johnson fights to hold on to his job. Ohio GOP Rep. Jim Jordan told Fox News “I think so,” when asked if he thinks Johnson will have the votes to remain speaker in today’s vote. Jordan said House Republicans need to get past the speaker vote to “do what we told the American people we were going to do.” Meanwhile, Louisiana GOP Rep. Mark Green predicted on Friday on “CBS Mornings” that the speaker vote today “will come down to a razor wire finish.” “People are out there negotiating,” Green said. “When we have a super thin majority, it’s really tough to get a speaker elected, as we saw last Congress.” When asked if he thought any of his other colleagues besides Johnson would want the job, Green responded “most of the folks I talk to that are super confident would not want the job, especially with this majority,” adding “this is the toughest job in America, I am convinced of that.” Tennessee GOP Rep. Tim Burchett told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” he’s still undecided on whether he’ll vote for Johnson as speaker, stating “I’ll be praying about it and I’ll make my decision according to that.” “Mike’s in a really tough position. Anybody in that position outside of being a single mom I can’t think of any job tougher in this country than being speaker of the House,” Burchett said, acknowledging Johnson’s balancing act between conservative members and members from swing districts. House speaker elections on Friday are less about Mike Johnson and more about Donald Trump. Johnson’s frantic fight to hold onto his job was still a cliffhanger heading into a fateful day for Republicans. But the president-elect has even more on the line – nothing less than his push for a fast start to his second presidency and promise to deliver massive change. If Trump fails to lift Johnson over the line, he will sow new doubts about his capacity to effectively lead the GOP trifecta of power in the House, Senate and White House. The convening of the 119th Congress, therefore, represents the first day of Washington’s new Trump era with Republicans aiming to produce tangible results as soon as he steps back into the Oval Office on January 20. The nation’s new leaders plan sweeping overhauls of immigration policy and big tax cuts using complex maneuvers required to overcome Democratic filibusters in the Senate. Such moves will demand unity and political dexterity for which the House GOP is hardly renowned. But before they can do anything, House Republicans must elect a speaker, an often routine task that is deeply perilous for Johnson because of the tiny majority that means he can lose only one vote in his fractious party if every lawmaker turns up. If Republicans can’t select a speaker by Monday, they won’t even be able to initiate the congressional process to certify Trump’s election victory — a spectacle that would be sure to infuriate and embarrass the president-elect. Read the full analysis. House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan told CNN that he believes GOP Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky could be the only person willing to vote against House Speaker Mike Johnson on the floor on Friday. “The only ‘no’ right now is Thomas and I think it may stay that way,” Jordan, a Republican from Ohio, told CNN. Asked about his message to the holdouts, Jordan stressed that GOP unity in the speaker’s race would allow the party to enact President-elect Donald Trump’s agenda. “The best way for us to accomplish what the people elected us to do is to get after it right away. The best way to get that done is to make sure Mike’s speaker and get moving,” Jordan said. Jordan didn’t rule out supporting process reforms that some of the holdouts are seeking from Johnson. “I’ve got to see all the details on that,” Jordan said when asked about reforms such as changes to the suspension calendar. “That’s largely between the speaker and the members. It’s all about getting the votes and getting down to work.” With the start of the 119th Congress on Friday, GOP Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina will become the longest-serving Black senator in the United States. Scott will also serve as the first Black chairman of a Senate standing committee, leading the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, where he previously served as Ranking Member. “As we begin the 119th Congress, Senate Republicans have high enthusiasm and are focused on delivering for the American people! This Congress, I am thrilled to serve as the Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee and the National Republican Senatorial Committee,” Scott said in a statement to CNN. He continued, “My goal is simple: make America work for Americans. As we get to work cleaning up the mess from the previous administration, I look forward to working with President Trump on his priorities, including paving a path for all Americans to have the necessary tools and resources to achieve their version of the American Dream. We will unlock opportunity, strengthen our nation, and make America the shining city on the Hill again.” Scott is one of only 12 Black senators to serve in the United States Senate. Currently, Scott is the only Black Republican in the Senate, while there are two Black Democratic senators: Sen. Cory Booker and Sen. Raphael Warnock. Two Black Democratic Senators, Sens.-elect Angela Alsobrooks and Lisa Blunt Rochester, will also be sworn in Friday. President-elect Donald Trump took to social media to post in support of Speaker Mike Johnson ahead of today’s critical speakership vote. “Good luck today for Speaker Mike Johnson, a fine man of great ability, who is very close to having 100% support. A win for Mike today will be a big win for the Republican Party, and yet another acknowledgment of our 129 year most consequential Presidential Election!! - A BIG AFFIRMATION, INDEED. MAGA!” Trump posted. Remember: Trump endorsed Johnson earlier this week, though the Republican from Louisiana faces a tough fight to retain the gavel, highlighting a test of the president-elect’s influence over his party amid the limits of an extraordinarily narrow majority. Trump’s endorsement could help Johnson shore up support, especially after the speaker navigated a chaotic government funding fight earlier this month that drew the ire of his right flank. But with a historically small majority in the new Congress, Johnson can afford only a single Republican defection when the House picks a new speaker if every member votes. House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters he hopes to win on one ballot today, even as multiple GOP lawmakers remain uncommitted. “I think so,” Johnson said, when asked by reporters if he expected to win on the first ballot. When pressed on if he’d be willing to make Republican Rep. Chip Roy the rules committee chairman, something members of the hardline House Freedom Caucus have been pushing, Johnson was definitive saying he is “not making side deals with anybody.” House lawmakers will vote today on whether to re-elect Johnson as their majority leader. Johnson’s allies are projecting confidence he’ll be able to secure the speakership, but even they are bracing for the possibility that it could go into multiple rounds of voting, leading to a drawn-out floor fight. Johnson can only afford a single GOP defection if every lawmaker shows up and votes, and one House Republican - Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky - has already said he won’t vote for him, while roughly a dozen more have not committed to supporting him. This post has been updated with additional details. Mike Johnson has been engaged in a flurry of talks with GOP hardliners who have made a series of demands as they hold out their support ahead of Friday’s critical vote to elect the next speaker. But unlike Kevin McCarthy, who won the gavel in 2023 after a 15-ballot marathon following a furious round of horse-trading, Johnson is resisting cutting side-deals to secure the speakership, according to his allies. The speaker is “not inclined to negotiate or make backroom-side deals,” a leadership source told CNN. Whether that posture changes remains to be seen since Johnson’s allies are uncertain whether he can win the speakership on the first ballot on Friday. Many of the decisions on what — if any — deals need to be cut will be made once vote-counting begins and the speaker and his team get a clear sense of which Republicans are withholding their support. So far, Rep. Thomas Massie is the lone Republican to announce his opposition to Johnson, who can’t afford to lose any more Republicans assuming all House members in attendance back a specific candidate. But others are expressing serious reservations, such as Reps. Chip Roy and Victoria Spartz, while a handful of other members remain non-committal. If Johnson fails to win on the first vote, the House could proceed to a second vote immediately after. If Johnson fails again on a second ballot, it’s uncertain if they’d try to recess the chamber to hold private meetings over how to proceed since the House cannot legislate until a speaker is selected. They could also decide to continue to vote on the floor. Among the demands hardliners are making including commitments on how government funding bills will be handled, assurances that new spending will be offset with cuts, further changes to a new House rules package, and the ability to have more sway in the legislative process. Beginning at 12 p.m. ET on January 3, the new Congress begins with a series of formalities in the House of Representatives. Below are key highlights of what to expect: Initial order of events in the House: How the speaker election works: If Johnson is elected on the first ballot If Johnson is not elected on the first ballot President-elect Donald Trump said on Monday that Speaker Mike Johnson has his “complete” and “total” endorsement, a major boost for the top House Republican ahead of the critical vote Friday. Trump’s endorsement comes as some House conservatives have warned they are not committed to backing Johnson in the speaker’s race. The President-elect’s endorsement could help Johnson lock down the votes he will need, especially after he navigated a chaotic government funding fight earlier this month that drew the ire of some members of his right flank. But Johnson faces an extraordinary narrow margin and can only lose a single Republican vote to still win the gavel, leaving little room for error. Trump praised Johnson on Monday, saying he is “hard working” and “will do the right thing.” “The American people need IMMEDIATE relief from all of the destructive policies of the last Administration. Speaker Mike Johnson is a good, hard working, religious man. He will do the right thing, and we will continue to WIN. Mike has my Complete & Total Endorsement. MAGA!!!,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social. More context: After Johnson cut a deal with Democrats over spending in mid-December, Trump injected a last-minute demand to raise the debt ceiling that left Johnson grasping for a plan B. A revised GOP plan ultimately failed to get enough Republican votes to pass and caused grumbling among Johnson’s right flank that the speaker wasn’t up to the job. It also caused some to wonder if Trump would stick with Johnson ahead of the speaker fight. Republican Sen. John Thune of South Dakota will be the next leader of his party in the chamber and the key ally of Mitch McConnell will be tasked with shepherding the agenda of President-elect Donald Trump through Congress. In choosing Thune — who has served as minority whip, the No. 2 role in GOP Senate leadership — Republicans elevated a leader associated with the establishment wing of the party over Florida Sen. Rick Scott, who was championed by several prominent Trump allies, including Elon Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy and Tucker Carlson. The election was conducted by secret ballot, which might have allowed Republicans wary of offending Trump’s most ardent supporters some political protection. Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, another McConnell ally, also vied for the leadership post. Thune, won the vote — which was conducted in November — 29-24 in the second round of voting against Cornyn and he will be sworn in on January 3. McConnell, who has led Senate Republicans since 2007, announced in February that he would step down as GOP leader this year. Immediately, Thune will be swept into a controversy brewing over Trump’s demand that the upper chamber use recess appointments to install his nominees, bypassing the formal advice and consent confirmation process, which historically has allowed the minority party to block a president’s picks. The three Republican senators who vied for majority leader all publicly supported Trump’s demand following his election victory. Thune, 63, has had a complicated relationship with the president-elect. He called for Trump to drop out of the 2016 race in the wake of the infamous “Access Hollywood” scandal — though Thune later said he still planned to vote for Trump. And he condemned Trump’s actions surrounding the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot as indefensible. Still, when Trump faced a vote in the Senate following his impeachment over the incident, Thune sided with McConnell and most of the Republican caucus in voting “not guilty.” Read more about Thune. © 2025 Cable News Network.

                "title": "Mike Johnson wins reelection as House speaker in dramatic vote to open new Congress",
                "content": "Watch CBS News By Kaia Hubbard, Caitlin Yilek Updated on: January 4, 2025 / 8:47 AM EST / CBS News Here are all the updates from a chaotic day on Capitol Hill: Johnson said he took \"suggestions and requests from all members on process reforms\" but \"there were no deals cut\" to secure the gavel. \"We made no deals to anyone, no quid pro quo for anybody on any position or anything at all through the entire — I haven't done that in 14 months and I was not about to start today,\" he said. The Louisiana Republican said he was \"100%\" confident that he will remain speaker throughout the entire 119th Congress. The House voted 215 to 209 to adopt new rules to govern the lower chamber for the next two years. House Republicans released their proposed rules package on Wednesday, which included a number of changes to the rules that governed the House during the last two years. In an attempt to avoid some of the chaos that plagued the Republican majority in the last Congress, Republicans raised the threshold to force a vote on ousting the House speaker to nine GOP members. The previous threshold was one member. Leadership unveiled a new package Friday that added, \"The Speaker may not entertain a motion that the House suspend the rules except on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays.\" Under suspension of the rules, House leaders can bring legislation to the floor without going through the Rules Committee, where a handful of conservatives have blocked legislation from advancing in recent years. The procedure is often used to fast-track legislation that has bipartisan support since it requires two-thirds of the chamber to pass. The new rules would prohibit that from taking place on Thursdays and Fridays. The package also eliminates the Office of Diversity and Inclusion, restores \"family-centric language\" and authorizes subpoenas of Attorney General Merrick Garland and other Justice Department officials as part of Republicans' investigations into the Biden family. It also changes the name of the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability to the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and renames the Office of Congressional Ethics to the Office of Congressional Conduct. Rep. Ralph Norman, the other GOP holdout, confirmed that he spoke with Trump before switching his vote, and received \"assurances\" that Johnson would \"fight.\" \"We had a talk with President Trump. We got in there — I never know how this stuff's going to come out. I didn't know how people were going to vote,\" he told CBS News. \"Mike gave us his assurances he's going to fight for the things we think are important to the country,\" he added. \"And was it worth taking another hour? Yes. And so, I'm excited with the way it came out, and Mike is too.\" Johnson spoke to a group of reporters at the Capitol and described his conversations with Self and Norman, the Republicans who switched their votes. \"I told them they can be assured that we're going to have different processes and procedures this time around, because it's unified government, and Republicans have control of the Senate and the White House and the House, so it's a very different situation than last Congress was, and they can hold me accountable for that,\" the speaker said. \"We're going to have a member-driven, bottom-up process for the development of this really important legislation. And we must succeed, we have no margin for error. So, that's all it was. No promises,\" Johnson added. Johnson confirmed to CBS News that he spoke with Trump while the speakership vote was being held open. Trump's message, Johnson said, was: \"Get united.\" Rep. Keith Self, one of the two initial Johnson holdouts, told reporters that he spoke to Trump \"before and after\" his vote. He declined to discuss many specifics, but said, \"We shored up the reconciliation team, because we know that this will be a heavy lift to get the Trump agenda across the line in the reconciliation package.\" \"We shored up the negotiating team. That's all we did,\" Self said. Republicans hope to use the reconciliation maneuver to advance much of Trump's agenda in the coming months. But doing so is complicated and requires coordination between lawmakers in both chambers and the White House. Self replied \"yes\" when asked if the reconciliation negotiating team would now include some Freedom Caucus members and be more \"member-inclusive.\" \"I was very frustrated with the 118th Congress, and that's why we needed to shore up the processes to make it more member-oriented for the Trump agenda, because we needed more input from members like myself, not a chairman, not [those] in a leadership position, and I think that's what we have done,\" Self said. Eleven members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus wrote a letter to their Republican House colleagues explaining that they have reservations about Johnson despite backing him for speaker. The group outlined a list of demands that they urged Johnson to address. The members — Reps. Chip Roy, Ralph Norman, Scott Perry, Andy Harris, Andy Biggs, Clay Higgins, Michael Cloud, Andy Ogles, Eli Crane, Eric Burlison and Andrew Clyde — wrote that they voted for Johnson \"because of our steadfast support of President Trump and to ensure the timely certification of his electors\" on Jan. 6. But they added that they did so \"despite our sincere reservations regarding the Speaker's track record over the past 15 months.\" They said Johnson should have committed to keeping the House in session for more days, and ensured that any reconciliation package reduces spending and the deficit. They also stressed that Johnson should have guaranteed that members can offer amendments on legislation and abide by a rule giving them 72 hours to review legislation before a vote, and stop relying heavily on Democratic support to pass key legislation. \"Now, Speaker Johnson must prove he will not fail to enact President Trump's bold agenda,\" they continued. The group said legislation that comes before the chamber should work to \"fully secure the border,\" cut spending significantly and reverse Biden administration policies like student loans forgiveness and electric vehicle mandates. They also argued that legislation should not increase the federal borrowing limit before \"real spending cuts are agreed to and in place,\" among other things. \"Personalities can be debated later, but right now there is zero room for error on the policies the American people demanded when they voted for President Trump — the ones necessary to save the country,\" the group wrote. \"We demand the House of Representatives deliver — quickly.\" Johnson administered the oath of office to all House members after he made remarks and was sworn in. There are 434 members, including Johnson, and one vacancy left by Matt Gaetz, who resigned after he was asked to join the Trump administration. Though Gaetz withdrew from consideration to be attorney general, he also decided not to take his seat in the 119th Congress. Johnson opened his speech to the assembled House by saying he was grateful to continue in the role. \"I'm grateful for this election, for the confidence this chamber has placed in me. It is the great honor of my life to serve this body with all of you,\" he said. Johnson said \"our nation is the envy of the world\" and touted individual freedom, limited government, the rule of law, peace through strength, fiscal responsibility, free markets and human dignity. He said Republicans have a mandate to carry out an \"America First\" agenda and they will start by defending the country's borders. \"We will deport dangerous, criminal, illegal aliens,\" he said, \"and finish building the border wall.\" Johnson also vowed to fight inflation, extend Trump-era tax cuts, expedite new drilling permits, end \"ridiculous\" electric vehicle mandates and drastically cut the size of the federal government. \"Our people do not deserve to be ruled by millions of bureaucrats they've never voted for, never met and can never hold accountable,\" he said. \"The American people have called on us to reject business as usual and throw out the status quo. We must and we will heed their call.\" He also touched on the divide within his party, saying the nation \"is counting on us to band together and solve these problems and get this done.\" After his remarks, Johnson took the oath of office and swore in the rest of the House. Trump posted on Truth Social soon after the vote was official: \"Congratulations to Speaker Mike Johnson for receiving an unprecedented Vote of Confidence in Congress. Mike will be a Great Speaker, and our Country will be the beneficiary. The People of America have waited four years for Common Sense, Strength, and Leadership. They'll get it now, and America will be greater than ever before!\" Jeffries, the House minority leader, introduced Johnson, as is customary after a speaker's election. \"It is now my responsibility to present the gavel to the gentleman from the great state of Louisiana,\" Jeffries said, calling Johnson \"a God-fearing man.\" Before introducing him, Jeffries spoke about his party and its posture, saying \"the election is over, this is a new Congress.\" He added that \"the American people need us as their elected representatives in this season to put down our partisan swords\" and instead choose bipartisanship. Jeffries pledged that House Democrats would work to find common ground with Republicans to make life better for Americans. He said that the chamber should come together to lower the cost of living in the United States \"once and for all.\" He also pledged that Democrats would work in a bipartisan manner to address border security. But he acknowledged that Democrats would push back when needed. The New York Democrat earned scattered applause from Republicans throughout his remarks, especially on the economy, while many audibly moaned after his remarks on working across party lines on border security. And when Jeffries praised the Biden-Harris administration for its \"powerful, principled\" work and service over the last four years, some Republicans laughed. \"Democrats will never abandon the long walk toward freedom,\" Jeffries said. Jeffries also honored former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who injured her hip last month, welcoming her back to the chamber. The bulk of lawmakers, including many Republicans, stood to applaud her return. In a surprise reversal, Johnson has secured support for his speakership on the first ballot, with 218 Republicans supporting his bid of the 434 members voting. He needed a majority of the voting members of the chamber to win the gavel. Jeffries had 215 votes from Democrats, while three Republicans — Reps. Thomas Massie, Keith Self and Ralph Norman — initially voted for other members of their party, before Self and Norman changed their votes. In a stunning scene on the House floor, Johnson huddled with the members who had opposed his bid, the chamber sitting in limbo while the vote tally went uncalled. After meeting with Johnson and other Republicans, Norman and Self walked to the dais of the chamber to switch their votes, with Johnson by their side. House Republicans gave Johnson a standing ovation as the clerk made the count official. The result avoided a repeat of the beginning of the last Congress, when a group of conservative detractors opposed Kevin McCarthy's bid for speaker, marking the first time in a century that a speaker failed to win support on the first round. With a narrow majority, Johnson faces many of the same challenges as the embattled former speaker. But Johnson eked out the necessary support on Friday. Rep. Ralph Norman and Keith Self switched their votes to Johnson, giving him the 218 votes he needs. The speaker huddled with a number of Republicans as the vote wrapped and the chamber waited for the tally to be officially called, including the three men who voted against him — Self, Massie and Norman. With the caveat that the vote is still open and they could technically change their votes, three House conservatives supported candidates other than Johnson in the first round. Heading into the vote, roughly a dozen Republicans were seen as key for Johnson's hopes. Here's how they voted: The vote has not been officially gaveled out, but Johnson, as it stands, is short of the 218 votes he needs. Six Republicans who initially skipped voting ended up supporting the speaker, but three others voted for other candidates, leaving Johnson with 216. He could only afford to lose the support of one Republican. Until the vote is finalized, members can change their votes. Rep. Chip Roy of Texas, who was seen as a crucial vote before Friday, supported Johnson when given a second opportunity to vote. The Republican had said he was undecided heading into the vote. Rep. Keith Self of Texas became the third Republican to defy Johnson by voting for Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida. Rep. Ralph Norman of South Carolina voted for Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, in a second defection for Johnson. The vote means Johnson is on track to lose in the first round of balloting. Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, the only Republican who vowed before the vote to hold his support from Johnson, voted instead for Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota, the majority whip. Massie is the first Republican to vote for someone other than Johnson, who smiled and laughed when Massie said his vote. Johnson can't afford any other defections. Minutes after predicting that the election would go multiple rounds, Rep. Tim Burchett voted for Johnson on the first ballot. Rep. Andy Biggs, Mike Cloud, Andrew Clyde and Paul Gosar declined to vote when their names were called, but they will get another opportunity at the end of the voting. Members are now being called in alphabetical order to say aloud who they support for speaker. With 434 members in attendance, Johnson needs 218 votes to win on the first ballot. Rep. Tim Burchett, a Republican from Tennessee, predicted Johnson would not win on the first ballot: This will go to multiple rounds. Burchett is one of the Republicans who has been undecided about how he'll vote. If he and Massie vote for another candidate, Johnson won't have the votes needed for a majority on the first ballot. Democratic caucus chair Pete Aguilar of California nominated Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries on behalf of his party, which he called the \"governing majority.\" Aguilar argued that \"there is only one leader in this chamber\" with the track record and ability to lead, saying that under Jeffries' leadership, House Democrats have united to keep the government funded, U.S. allies protected and the economy secure. \"Because of Hakeem's leadership, we will never abandon our values or sacrifice our bedrock principles of freedom and democracy,\" Aguilar said. During the 2023 speaker fight, Democrats nominated Jeffries during each of the 15 rounds it took for McCarthy to secure the gavel. GOP conference chair Lisa McClain is nominating Johnson for speaker, delivering a speech in support of his continued leadership. \"We have the opportunity to put America first again,\" McClain said, following the November election and with a Republican trifecta in Washington, arguing that Johnson is the right leader to move the chamber forward. \"No speaker is perfect, and no one will ever be,\" she continued. \"However, achieving perfection requires incremental gains and hard decisions along the way.\" McCalin said \"we should be celebrating and building upon his efforts, our efforts,\" and that \"Mike has remained the same kind and caring person as he was before he assumed this role.\" The bulk of Republicans in the chamber rose following the nominating speech. Roy remained seated. Johnson pledged a \"return to fiscal sanity,\" writing on X that if Republicans \"don't follow through on our campaign promise for fiscal responsibility, we don't deserve to hold power.\" \"Along with advancing President Trump's America First agenda, I will lead the House Republicans to reduce the size and scope of the federal government, hold the bureaucracy accountable, and move the United States to a more sustainable fiscal trajectory,\" he wrote. He laid out three steps he plans to take to achieve the goal: creating a group of independent experts to recommend spending reforms, reviewing existing audits of federal agencies and entities and tasking House committees with exposing \"irresponsible or illegal practices.\" The American people have demanded an end to the status quo, and a return to fiscal sanity. That’s why the citizens of our great country gave President Trump the White House and Republican control of both chambers of Congress. If we don’t follow through on our campaign promise for… The pledge comes as conservatives have threatened to hold their support from electing him as speaker as they seek deeper cuts in government spending. Rep. Victoria Spartz of Indiana, a potential holdout, said she appreciated Johnson's promise to deliver on Trump's agenda, signaling that she could vote for him. In the Senate chamber, Vice President Kamala Harris, in her role as president of the Senate, led the swearing in of all 32 senators who were elected in November. The senators, including the 12 new members, took the oath in groups of four and vowed to \"well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office upon which you are about to enter, so help you God.\" The newly sworn-in senators then signed an oath book vowing to defend the Constitution. The 119th Congress began with a call to order by the House clerk, followed by a prayer led by the chaplain as lawmakers bowed their heads in reverence. They then recited the pledge of allegiance and began a quorum call ordered by the clerk. The chamber is abuzz as lawmakers, after a long campaign season, greet each other excitedly ahead of the speaker vote. The speaker officially adjourned the 118th Congress with the pound of his gavel, as the new one is set to get underway. The 118th Congress began with a 15-round speaker battle, christened by a chaos that seemed to define it. The House will formally adjourn the 118th session \"sine die,\" or \"without a day,\" just before noon, marking the end of the current Congress. The 119th Congress will then begin at 12 p.m. Here's the rough rundown for how the rest of the day is expected to play out: Once a speaker is elected, here's what happens: The House is expected to have 434 members present. The one seat expected to be vacant is that of former Rep. Matt Gaetz. Members will be called individually and vote by calling out a name. To be reelected as speaker, Johnson will need a majority. The magic number isn't set in stone, which is why things can get a bit tricky. It could change based on attendance, and whether members vote for a named candidate or simply record themselves as \"present.\" So let's run through some scenarios. If all 215 Democrats show up and unite behind their leader, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, Johnson will only be able to lose one Republican who votes for another named candidate: If he loses a second Republican to another named candidate, he would not have the magic number for a majority: He could in theory lose one GOP vote to another named candidate, and afford one other Republican defection so long as that person records \"present\" and doesn't vote for an alternative candidate. That's because the number he'd need for a majority would be lower: He cannot lose a GOP vote to a named candidate if two Republicans vote \"present,\" however: He could lose three defectors if they all vote \"present\": However, we know this last scenario won't happen, because Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky has already told reporters he won't vote for Johnson and will vote for an alternate candidate. Currently, Massie is the only \"no.\" He told reporters in December that he had a \"few\" alternate candidates in mind, but wouldn't say who they were. There are several Republicans who have publicly said they're undecided on Johnson, including Reps. Chip Roy, Andy Biggs, Victoria Spartz, Tim Burchett and Ralph Norman. Johnson met with several of the holdouts on Thursday. The key advantage for Johnson is that no other Republican is currently challenging him or has publicly expressed interest in doing so. Roy, whose vote could decide the outcome of the speaker battle, is sitting toward the back of the House chamber and being greeted by a slew of lawmakers as they wait for the vote to get started. Johnson himself approached the Texas Republican and the two briefly spoke. Johnson has entered the House chamber, greeting lawmakers and posing for photos ahead of the vote. He shook hands with a number of those who could oppose him, including Rep. Andy Ogles of Tennessee and Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona. Just one House Republican has publicly pledged not to support Johnson, Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky. But a number of others have expressed skepticism or otherwise voiced concern about Republican leadership: Many will be called to vote early on in the process, which proceeds alphabetically. That should give a good sense of Johnson's support. CBS News' Scott MacFarlane reports from the Capitol: As GOP Rep. Mike Johnson looks to remain House Speaker, he faces several undecided Republicans ahead of today’s vote and has a “tiny little majority and an even tinier margin for error,” CBS News’ @MacFarlaneNews says. pic.twitter.com/9lXh0mP6Hl Johnson may not have the votes needed to retain the gavel even with Trump's endorsement. CBS News' Taurean Small and Libby Cathey report: Speaker Johnson: “I don't make deals with anyone. There's no quid pro quo here. I don't do anything in exchange for a vote other than commit to make this institution work as effectively and efficiently as possible.\" pic.twitter.com/5gm6z2KTM9 Johnson told reporters that House Republicans \"don't have time for drama\" as the party prepares to move on its lengthy list of legislative priorities. He urged his conference to make suggestions to address their frustration with his leadership — though he pledged not to do anything \"in exchange for a vote.\" \"My simple message to my colleagues is, make suggestions about process improvements,\" Johnson said. \"We're open to that at all times, but I don't make deals with anyone.\" The speaker said the conference needs to unify around Trump's agenda, arguing that \"this election is not just about one person. It's about moving forward with the America first agenda.\" Officials at the Capitol have beefed up security as the new Congress prepares to meet on Friday, the first of several high-profile events on Capitol Hill in the coming weeks. Congress will meet on Monday, Jan. 6, to count the Electoral College votes and finalize Trump's victory. Former President Jimmy Carter will also lie in state at the Capitol next week, and the inauguration is set for later this month. Temporary fences were erected on the perimeter of the Capitol in recent days, and law enforcement agencies including the Capitol Police and Secret Service are coordinating on security. The Department of Homeland Security designated the Jan. 6 counting of electoral votes a \"national special security event\" following the attack on the Capitol in 2021, providing for a greater level of coordination among federal agencies. At the Capitol, Johnson was asked about the possibility of Rep. Chip Roy becoming chairman of the powerful House Rules Committee, as some of Johnson's detractors have suggested. \"I'm not making deals with anybody,\" Johnson replied. Trump offered well wishes to Johnson on Truth Social before the House convenes to appoint a new speaker. The president-elect endorsed the Louisiana Republican's bid to keep the gavel Monday. \"Good luck today for Speaker Mike Johnson, a fine man of great ability, who is very close to having 100% support,\" Trump wrote. Johnson is expected to have the votes of most House Republicans, but no Democrats are expected to back his bid. He added, \"A win for Mike today will be a big win for the Republican Party, and yet another acknowledgment of our 129 year most consequential Presidential Election!! - A BIG AFFIRMATION, INDEED. MAGA!\" he wrote. The House speaker is elected by the whole chamber, not just the party in control. Republicans won 220 seats in November, but Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, who was tapped to lead Trump's Justice Department and then later withdrew, has said he will not take his seat, giving Republicans a 219 to 215 edge. Johnson will need 218 votes to win the speakership if all 434 remaining members are present and voting. That means that without any Democratic defections, Johnson can only afford to lose a single vote. Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, said he will vote for someone other than Johnson, citing the speaker's handling of the government funding battle. Rep. Chip Roy, a Texas Republican, said he's undecided on his vote and doubted that Johnson has enough support. But absences or members who vote \"present\" could tip the math in Johnson's favor by lowering the threshold he needs to win. And no viable alternative has emerged who could feasibly win the support of the Republican conference, leaving Johnson's detractors without a backup candidate. Johnson also enjoys the support of President-elect Donald Trump, who of course holds enormous sway over the party. Johnson met Thursday with members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus as his bid for the speakership hangs in the balance. He emerged from the meeting appearing confident that he'll retain the gavel and said his conversations with conservatives are \"going well.\" He also predicted the vote would go \"smoothly.\" Several conservatives were seen entering Johnson's office at the Capitol, including Rep. Andy Harris of Maryland, the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, who has questioned Johnson's leadership. Others in attendance, including Reps. Chip Roy of Texas, Ralph Norman of South Carolina and Victoria Spartz of Indiana, have said they are undecided. Read more here. With their newfound control of both chambers of Congress, Republican leaders are touting a list of priorities that they aim to quickly address, notably on immigration and taxes. How exactly Republicans will proceed remains to be seen. Earlier this week, House Speaker Mike Johnson outlined plans to move the GOP agenda through the budget reconciliation process, which allows them to forgo a 60-vote threshold typically required for legislation in the Senate. But reconciliation is a complicated maneuver that comes with its own limitations on what can be included in a final bill. Johnson, who faces his own dicey speaker's election on Friday, said a reconciliation package will be \"the key of the first 100 days,\" but he noted that it will require \"a lot of coordination, planning and executing those plans with precision.\" \"We are going to fix the border,\" Johnson said on Fox News on Monday. \"We are going to get the economy humming again. We are going to restore our stature on the world stage, get our energy policy fixed, make sure that we don't have the largest tax cut in U.S. history imposed upon the American people at the end of next year when the tax cuts from the Trump era expire.\" Congressional Republicans have touted their alignment on the issues, saying that they have a mandate from the American people to deliver on Trump's \"America First\" agenda. Still, a unified vision of how to move forward with the priorities has appeared cloudy as the new Congress begins. \"We have a lot on our plate,\" Johnson said. \"But I'm confident we're going to be able to get it done.\" Read more about where Republicans plan to start here. Johnson won the gavel in October 2023 after House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, was ousted after nine months. It was the first time in history that the House voted to remove the speaker. McCarthy became speaker in January 2023 after a marathon 15 rounds of voting that delayed the swearing-in of House members by several days. To win, McCarthy ultimately gave in to conservative demands, including allowing a single member to trigger a no-confidence vote to oust the speaker. The decision came back to bite McCarthy after he struck a deal with Democrats to avert a government shutdown. Gaetz introduced the motion to remove McCarthy, and along with seven other far-right Republicans and all Democrats, ended his speakership. It took Republicans three weeks to coalesce behind a candidate. After three high-profile members were unable to overcome opposition from within the party, Johnson emerged with unanimous support among Republicans and won on the fourth ballot. Conservatives have repeatedly threatened Johnson with a similar fate after he has relied on Democratic votes to pass legislation, including spending bills to keep the government operating and foreign aid. Democrats saved Johnson last May from a far-right effort to remove him from his post. The far-right's antics have angered their colleagues, leading to an agreement to raise the threshold to force a vote on ousting a speaker to nine members of the majority in the new Congress.

We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy Most people get HMPV before they turn 5. You can get HMPV again, but symptoms are usually mild after your first infection. Human metapneumovirus most often causes symptoms similar to a cold, but some people can get very sick. You’re more likely to get severely sick the first time you get HMPV, which is why young kids have a greater risk for serious illness. You get some protection (immunity) from your first infection and then are more likely to have mild, cold-like symptoms if you get another HMPV infection. Adults over 65 and people with breathing problems or a weakened immune system may also get severe symptoms. Researchers estimate that about 10% to 12% of respiratory illnesses in children are caused by HMPV. Most cases are mild, but about 5% to 16% of children will develop a lower respiratory tract infection like pneumonia. It’s not the same, but human metapneumovirus is similar to RSV (respiratory syncytial virus). It’s part of the same genus — or scientific grouping — as RSV (Pneumovirus), and can cause similar symptoms. The peak age for severe illness from HMPV is between 6 and 12 months, but RSV is more likely to cause severe illness in infants younger than 6 months. Symptoms of human metapneumovirus include: Advertisement A virus — a small germ that uses your cells to make more copies of itself — causes HMPV. It’s part of the same group of viruses that cause RSV, measles and mumps. HMPV spreads through direct contact with someone who has it or from touching things contaminated with the virus. For instance: Anyone can get HMPV, but you’re at a higher risk for severe illness if you: Sometimes HMPV causes complications. These might be serious and require you to be hospitalized. They include: Healthcare providers usually diagnose HMPV based on your symptoms and health history. They might use a soft-tipped stick (swab) to get a sample from your nose or throat. A lab tests the sample for viruses and other infections. Keep in mind that you probably won’t be tested for HMPV unless you have serious symptoms. Sometimes, your provider may also do a bronchoscopy or chest X-rays to look for changes in the airways of your lungs. There aren’t any antiviral medications that treat human metapneumovirus. Most people can manage their symptoms at home until they feel better. If you or your child are severely ill, you might need to be admitted to the hospital. There, healthcare providers can monitor your condition and help prevent you from getting sicker. They might treat you with: No. Antibiotics only treat bacteria. Since HMPV is a virus, antibiotics won’t get rid of it. Sometimes people who get pneumonia from HMPV also get a bacterial infection at the same time (secondary infection). If your provider prescribes antibiotics, it would be to treat any secondary infections. You can reduce your risk of getting HMPV and other infectious diseases by: Advertisement Mild cases of human metapneumovirus usually last a few days to a week.

It is a seasonal disease that usually occurs in the winter and early spring, similar to RSV and the flu. Anyone can be infected with hMPV but it is most common in children, older adults and people with weakened immune systems. It spreads through close contact with an infected person and, in most cases, will go away on its own after a few days. People with hMPV usually have mild symptoms similar to a cold, but young children, older adults and those with a weakened immune system may develop a more severe illness. Most hMPV infections only last about 2-5 days and go away on their own. Treatment consists of supportive care to ease symptoms. Many times, patients with severe hMPV are very young, so they rely on a caregiver to talk to their doctor. Here are some questions to ask on their behalf.

Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) can cause upper and lower respiratory disease in people of all ages, especially among young children, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems. Discovered in 2001, HMPV is in the Pneumoviridae family along with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Broader use of molecular diagnostic testing has increased identification and awareness of HMPV as an important cause of upper and lower respiratory infection. Symptoms commonly associated with HMPV include cough, fever, nasal congestion, and shortness of breath. Clinical symptoms of HMPV infection may progress to bronchitis or pneumonia and are similar to other viruses that cause upper and lower respiratory infections. The estimated incubation period is 3 to 6 days, and the median duration of illness can vary depending upon severity but is similar to other respiratory infections caused by viruses. HMPV is most likely spread from an infected person to others through In the U.S., HMPV circulates in distinct annual seasons. HMPV circulation begins in winter and lasts until or through spring. Surveillance data from CDC's the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) shows HMPV to be most active during late winter and spring in temperate climates. HMPV, RSV, and influenza can circulate simultaneously during the respiratory virus season. Your patients can help prevent the spread of HMPV and other respiratory viruses by following these steps: Patients who have cold-like symptoms should In addition, cleaning possible contaminated surfaces (such as doorknobs and shared toys) may potentially help stop the spread of HMPV. In healthcare settings, healthcare providers should follow CDC's 2007 Guideline for Isolation Precautions: Preventing Transmission of Infectious Agents in Healthcare Settings. Since HMPV is a recently recognized respiratory virus, healthcare professionals may not routinely consider or test for HMPV. However, healthcare professionals should consider HMPV testing during winter and spring, especially when HMPV is commonly circulating. Infection with HMPV can be confirmed usually by Currently, there is no specific antiviral therapy to treat HMPV and no vaccine to prevent HMPV. Medical care is supportive.

                "content": "Diseases & Conditions Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a recently identified member of a family of viruses that also includes respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza virus. Although identified in 2001 by investigators from the Netherlands, data suggest this is a common virus that has been responsible for respiratory illnesses for at least 50 years worldwide. Human metapneumovirus can cause upper and lower respiratory tract infections in patients of all ages but respiratory illnesses most often occur in young children or older adults. Spread of the virus is most likely to occur by direct or close contact with the respiratory secretions of infected persons or by contact with objects and surfaces contaminated by their secretions. Most persons with hMPV infection have mild symptoms including cough, runny nose or nasal congestion, sore throat and fever. More severe illness, with wheezing, difficulty breathing, hoarseness, cough, pneumonia, and in adults, aggravation of asthma, also has been reported. In children younger than 1 year of age, the elderly and persons who have weak immune systems, hMPV can cause more serious respiratory illness. It is most common in late winter and early spring in the United States, however, one summer outbreak of hMPV respiratory illnesses in residents and staff of a long-term care facility in the United States has been reported. It is believed most persons who develop illness will do so three to five days after being exposed to this virus. Limited data suggests that reinfection with hMPV can occur. It is believed most children become infected early in life and adult infections represent persons becoming infected with hMPV again. Repeated infection appears to result in milder illness although serious disease is a risk for patients who are immunocompromised. Human metapneumovirus testing is not readily available. At this time, research laboratories and a limited number of commercial laboratories perform testing for this virus. Supportive treatment for patients varies with the severity of the illness but generally treatment consists of fever reducers, antihistamines, breathing treatments and other means of providing comfort to the patient until the illness resolves. Control measures used for other respiratory illnesses should be emphasized: covering the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing, or, coughing or sneezing into the upper sleeve rather than the hands, prompt disposal of used tissues and proper handwashing. Non-human primates can become infected with human metapneumovirus; humans are their likely source of infection.",

                "content": "Real Madrid Club de Fútbol (Spanish pronunciation: [reˈal maˈðɾið ˈkluβ ðe ˈfuðβol] ⓘ), commonly referred to as Real Madrid, is a Spanish professional football club based in Madrid. The club competes in La Liga, the top tier of Spanish football. Founded in 1902 as Madrid Football Club, the club has traditionally worn a white home kit since its inception. The honorific title real is Spanish for \"royal\" and was bestowed to the club by King Alfonso XIII in 1920 alongside with the crown in the club crest. Real Madrid have played their home matches in the 85,000-capacity Santiago Bernabéu in Madrid since 1947. Unlike most European sporting clubs, Real Madrid's members (socios) have owned and operated the club throughout its history. The official Madrid anthem is the \"Hala Madrid y nada más\", written by RedOne and Manuel Jabois.[8] The club is one of the most widely supported in the world and is the most followed football club on social media according to the CIES Football Observatory as of 2023.[9][10] It was estimated to be worth $6.6 billion in 2024, making it the world's most valuable football club.[11] In 2024, Real Madrid become the first football club to make €1 billion ($1.08bn) in revenue according to the club's announcement.[12] Real Madrid are one of the most successful clubs in the sport. In domestic football, the club has won 71 trophies; a record 36 La Liga titles, 20 Copa del Rey, 13 Supercopa de España, a Copa Eva Duarte and a Copa de la Liga.[13] In International football, Real Madrid have won a record 35 trophies: a record 15 European Cup/UEFA Champions League titles, a record six UEFA Super Cups, two UEFA Cups, a joint record two Latin Cups, a record one Iberoamerican Cup, and a record nine FIFA Club World championships.[note 1] Madrid was ranked first in the International Federation of Football History & Statistics Club World Ranking for 2000, 2002, 2014, 2017.[17] In UEFA, Madrid ranks first in the all-time club ranking.[18][19] Being one of the three founding members of La Liga that have never been relegated from the top division since its inception in 1929 (along with Athletic Bilbao and Barcelona), Real Madrid has many long-standing rivalries, most notably El Clásico with Barcelona and El Derbi Madrileño with Atlético Madrid. The club established itself as a major force in both Spanish and European football during the 1950s and 60s, winning five consecutive and six overall European Cups and reaching a further two finals. This success was replicated on the domestic front, with Madrid winning 12 league titles in 16 years. This team, which included Alfredo Di Stéfano, Ferenc Puskás, Paco Gento and Raymond Kopa is considered, by some in the sport, to be the greatest of all time.[20][21] Real Madrid is known for its Galácticos policy, which involves signing the world's best players, such as Ronaldo, Zinedine Zidane and David Beckham to create a superstar team.[22] The term 'Galácticos policy' generally refers to the two eras of Florentino Pérez's presidency of the club (2000–2006 and 2009–2018); however, players brought in just before his tenure are sometimes considered to be part of the Galácticos legacy. A notable example is Steve McManaman, who like many other players also succeeded under the policy.[23] On 26 June 2009, Madrid signed Cristiano Ronaldo for a record-breaking £80 million (€94 million);[24] he became both the club's and history's all-time top goalscorer.[25][26][27][28] Madrid have recently relaxed the Galácticos policy, instead focusing on signing young talents such as Vinícius Júnior, Rodrygo, Jude Bellingham[29] and Kylian Mbappé.[30][31] Real Madrid is recognised as the greatest football club of the 20th century by FIFA and as the best European club during the same timeframe by the IFFHS,[32] while also receiving the FIFA Centennial Order of Merit in 2004.[33] Real Madrid has the highest participations in the European Cup/Champions League (55),[18] a tournament in which they hold the overall record for the most wins, most draws and most goals scored.[34] Real Madrid is the only club to have won three consecutive titles (three-peat) in the European Cup/Champions League twice, first in 1955–56, 1956–57, and 1957–58, and second in 2015–16, 2016–17 and 2017–18 and was the first and the only club to win La Decima (in 2013-14).[35] In June 2024, they won a record-extending 15th Champions League title (the sixth in eleven seasons), recognised as such by Guinness World Records.[36] Real Madrid is the first club across all of Europe's top-five leagues to win 100 trophies in all competitions.[37] As of July 2024,[update] Real Madrid are ranked 2nd in the UEFA club rankings and first in last 10 years (2013–2023) overall.[38][39] Real Madrid's origins go back to when football was introduced to Madrid by the academics and students of the Institución Libre de Enseñanza, which included several Cambridge and Oxford University graduates.[40] They founded (Sociedad) Sky Football in 1897, commonly known as La Sociedad (The Society) as it was the only one based in Madrid, playing on Sunday mornings at Moncloa. In 1900, conflict between members caused some of them to leave and create a new club, Nueva Sociedad de Football (New Society of Football), to distinguish themselves from Sky Football. Among the dissenters were Julián Palacios, recognized as the first Real Madrid president, Juan Padrós and Carlos Padrós, the latter two being brothers and future presidents of Real Madrid. In 1901, this new club was renamed as Madrid Football Club. Later, following a restructuring in 1902, Sky was renamed as \"New Foot-Ball Club\".[41][42][43] On 6 March 1902, after a new Board presided by Juan Padrós had been elected, Madrid Football Club was officially founded.[7] The Padrós brothers summoned other football enthusiasts to a meeting in the back room of Al Capricho, the family business. They viewed football as a mass sport that should be accessible to representatives of all social classes, and thought the new club should embody that idea. The brothers proposed the name, Madrid Football Club, which was unanimously accepted. The membership fee was also set, two pesetas a month, and the color of the shirt was chosen to be white in honour of a famous English team Corinthian, which Juan Padrós had met on one of his trips.[44][45] Three years after its founding, in 1905, Madrid FC won its first title after defeating Athletic Bilbao in the Spanish Cup final. The club became one of the founding sides of the Royal Spanish Football Federation on 4 January 1909, when club president Adolfo Meléndez signed the foundation agreement of the Spanish FA. After moving between several grounds, the team relocated to the Campo de O'Donnell in 1912.[46] In 1920, the club's name was changed to Real Madrid after King Alfonso XIII granted the title of Real (Royal) to the club.[47] In 1929, the first Spanish football league was founded. Real Madrid led the first league season until the last match, a loss to Athletic Bilbao, meant they finished runners-up to Barcelona.[48] Real Madrid won its first league title in the 1931–32 season and retained it the following year.[49] On 14 April 1931, the arrival of the Second Spanish Republic caused the club to lose the title Real and the royal crown on its emblem, going back to being named Madrid Football Club until the end of the Spanish Civil War. Football continued during the Second World War, and on 13 June 1943, Madrid beat Barcelona 11–1 in the second leg of the Copa del Generalísimo semi-finals, the Spanish Cup having been renamed in honour of General Franco.[note 2][50] The first leg, played at the Les Corts in Catalonia, had ended with Barcelona winning 3–0. Madrid complained about all the three goals that referee Fombona Fernández had allowed for Barcelona,[51] with the home supporters also whistling Madrid throughout, whom they accused of employing roughhouse tactics, and Fombona for allowing them to. The newspaper Ya reported the whistling as a \"clear intention to attack the representatives of Spain.\"[52] Barcelona fans were banned from traveling to Madrid. The day of the second leg, the Barcelona team were insulted and stones were thrown at their bus as soon as they left their hotel. Barcelona's striker Mariano Gonzalvo said of the incident, \"Five minutes before the game had started, our penalty area was already full of coins.\" Barcelona goalkeeper Luis Miró rarely approached his line—when he did, he was armed with stones. As Francisco Calvet told the story, \"They were shouting: Reds! Separatists!... a bottle just missed Sospedra that would have killed him if it had hit him. It was all set up.\"[53] Real Madrid went 2–0 up within half an hour. The third goal brought with it a sending off for Barcelona's Benito García after he made what Calvet claimed was a \"completely normal tackle\". Madrid's José Llopis Corona recalled: \"At which point, they got a bit demoralized,\" while Ángel Mur countered, \"at which point, we thought: 'go on then, score as many as you want'.\"[54] Madrid made it 8–0 by half-time; two goals were also ruled out for offside, and proceeded to score a further three goals in the second half, to which Barcelona replied with a late consolation goal.[55] According to football writer Sid Lowe, \"There have been relatively few mentions of the game [since] and it is not a result that has been particularly celebrated in Madrid. Indeed, the 11–1 occupies a far more prominent place in Barcelona's history. This was the game that first formed the identification of Madrid as the team of the dictatorship and Barcelona as its victims.\"[51] Fernando Argila, Barcelona's reserve goalkeeper from the 1943 match, said: \"There was no rivalry. Not, at least, until that game.\"[56] Santiago Bernabéu became president of Real Madrid in 1943.[57] Under his presidency, the club was rebuilt after the Civil War, and he oversaw the construction of the club's current stadium, Estadio Real Madrid Club de Fútbol (now known as the Santiago Bernabéu), and its training facilities Ciudad Deportiva. Additionally, during the 1950s former Real Madrid Amateurs player Miguel Malbo founded Real Madrid's youth academy, or \"cantera,\" known today as La Fábrica. Beginning in 1953, he embarked upon a strategy of signing world-class players from abroad, the most prominent being Alfredo Di Stéfano.[58] In 1955, acting upon the idea proposed by Gabriel Hanot, a French sports journalist and editor of L'Équipe, Bernabéu, Ernest Bedrignan (deputy chairman of the Ligue de Football Professionnel)[59] and Gusztáv Sebes created the European Cup, a continental tournament for the league champions around Europe, which is today known as the UEFA Champions League.[60] It was under Bernabéu's guidance that Real Madrid established itself as a major force in both Spanish and European football. The club won the European Cup five times in a row between 1956 and 1960, which included the 7–3 Hampden Park final against Eintracht Frankfurt in 1960.[58] After these five consecutive successes, Real was permanently awarded the original cup and earned the right to wear the UEFA badge of honour.[61] Real Madrid's achievements in Europe were built upon its unprecedented domestic dominance, with the club winning twelve league titles out of sixteen possible from 1953–54 to 1968–69, including a five-in-a-row sequence in 1961–65, and finishing runners-up a further three times.[62] The club won the European Cup for a sixth time in 1966, defeating Partizan Belgrade 2–1 in the final with a team composed entirely of same nationality players, a first in the competition.[63] This team became known as the Yé-yé. The name \"Yé-yé\" came from the \"Yeah, yeah, yeah\" chorus in The Beatles' song \"She Loves You\" after four members of the team posed for Marca and impersonated the Beatles.[64] The Yé-yé generation was also European Cup runners-up in 1962[65] and 1964.[63] In the 1970s, Real Madrid won six league championships and three Spanish Cups.[66] The club competed in its first European Cup Winners' Cup in 1970–71 and progressed all the way to the final, where it lost to English side Chelsea 2–1 in a replay.[67] On 2 July 1978, club president Santiago Bernabéu died while the World Cup was being played in Argentina. FIFA decreed three days of mourning to honour him during the tournament.[68] The following year, the club organized the first edition of the Trofeo Santiago Bernabéu in memory of its former president. Bernabéu had been Real Madrid's president for almost 35 years, during which his club won one Intercontinental Cup, six European Cups, 16 league titles, six Spanish Cups, two Latin Cups and one Copa Eva Duarte.[69] In the early 1980s, Real Madrid had lost its grasp on the La Liga title, until a new cohort of home-grown stars brought domestic success back to the club.[70][71] Spanish sports journalist Julio César Iglesias gave to this generation the name La Quinta del Buitre (\"Vulture's Cohort\"), which was derived from the nickname given to one of its members, Emilio Butragueño. The other four members were Manolo Sanchís, Martín Vázquez, Míchel and Miguel Pardeza. All five footballers were graduates of Real Madrid's youth academy.[70][71] With La Quinta del Buitre (reduced to four members when Pardeza left for Zaragoza in 1986) and notable players like goalkeeper Francisco Buyo, right-back Miguel Porlán Chendo and Mexican striker Hugo Sánchez, Real Madrid had one of the best teams in Spain and Europe during the second half of the 1980s, winning two UEFA Cups, five Spanish championships in a row, one Spanish Cup, and three Spanish Super Cups.[70][71] In the early 1990s, La Quinta del Buitre split up after Martín Vázquez, Emilio Butragueño and Míchel left the club. In 1996, President Lorenzo Sanz appointed Fabio Capello as coach.[72] Although his tenure lasted only one season, Real Madrid were proclaimed league champions, and players like Predrag Mijatović, Davor Šuker, Clarence Seedorf, Roberto Carlos and keeper Bodo Illgner, arrived at the club to strengthen a squad that already boasted the likes of Raúl, Fernando Hierro and Fernando Redondo. As a result, Real Madrid (with the addition of Fernando Morientes in 1997) finally ended its 32-year wait for its seventh European Cup: in 1998, under manager Jupp Heynckes, they defeated Juventus 1–0 in the final with a goal from Mijatović.[73] In November 1999, Vicente del Bosque took over as coach. For the last season of the century, 1999–2000, the squad was still led by the older veterans such as Fernando Hierro, Fernando Redondo, Roberto Carlos and Raúl. Real added the budding young talents of Guti and Iker Casillas, supported by the arrival of Steve McManaman and Nicolas Anelka from the English Premier League, alongside local talents Míchel Salgado and Iván Helguera. In Del Bosque's first season in charge, Real won the Champions League for the eighth time, following a 3–0 victory over Valencia in the final, with goals from Morientes, McManaman and Raúl.[74] This victory marked the beginning of a successful period in Real Madrid's history.[75] In July 2000, Florentino Pérez was elected club president.[76] He vowed in his campaign to erase the club's €270 million debt and modernize the club's facilities. However, the primary electoral promise that propelled Pérez to victory was the signing of Luís Figo from arch-rivals Barcelona.[77] The following year, the club had its training ground rezoned and used the money to begin assembling the Galácticos team by signing a global star every summer, which included Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo, Luís Figo, David Beckham and Fabio Cannavaro.[78] It is debatable whether the gamble paid off, as despite winning the UEFA Champions League and an Intercontinental Cup in 2002, followed by La Liga in 2003, the club failed to win a major trophy for the next three seasons. Off the pitch, the Zidanes y Pavones policy resulted in increased financial success based on the exploitation of the club's high marketing potential around the world, particularly in Asia.[79] The few days after the capturing of the 2003 La Liga title were surrounded with controversy. The first controversial decision came when Pérez sacked winning coach Vicente del Bosque.[80] Over a dozen players left the club, including Madrid captain Fernando Hierro, while defensive midfielder Claude Makélélé refused to take part in training in protest at being one of the lowest-paid players at the club and subsequently moved to Chelsea.[81] \"That's a lot [of players leaving] when the normal rule is: never change a winning team,\" stated Zidane.[82] Real Madrid, with newly appointed coach Carlos Queiroz, started their domestic league slowly after a hard win over Real Betis.[82] The 2005–06 season began with the promise of several new signings: Júlio Baptista (€24 million), Robinho (€30 million), and Sergio Ramos (€27 million).[83] However, Real Madrid suffered from some poor results, including a 0–3 loss at the hands of Barcelona at the Santiago Bernabéu in November 2005.[84] Madrid's coach Wanderley Luxemburgo was sacked the following month and his replacement was Juan Ramón López Caro.[85] A brief return to form came to an abrupt halt after Madrid lost the first leg of the Copa del Rey semi-finals 6–1 to Real Zaragoza,[86] a defeat that was nearly reversed with a 4–0 home victory. Shortly after, Real Madrid were eliminated from the Champions League for a fourth successive year, this time at the hands of Arsenal. On 27 February 2006, Florentino Pérez resigned.[87] Ramón Calderón was elected as club president on 2 July 2006 and subsequently appointed Fabio Capello as the new coach and Predrag Mijatović as the new sporting director. Real Madrid won the Liga title in 2007 for the first time in four years, but Capello was nonetheless sacked at the end of the campaign.[88] The title was won on 17 June, where Real faced Mallorca at the Bernabéu while Barcelona and Sevilla, the other title challengers, faced Gimnàstic de Tarragona and Villarreal, respectively. At half-time, Real were 0–1 down, while Barcelona had surged ahead into a 0–3 lead in Tarragona. However, three goals in the last half-hour secured Madrid a 3–1 win and their first league title since 2003.[89] Real Madrid repeated as league winners in 2007–08, but the following season ended up being one of the most disastrous in the club's history: Real was knocked out of the Champions League at the round of 16 stage for the fifth time in a row, losing to Liverpool 0–5 on aggregate, and was embarrassed by Barcelona at the Santiago Bernabéu with a humiliating 2–6 loss, which all but confirmed the league title for Barça that went on to win the treble.[90] On 1 June 2009, Florentino Pérez regained Real Madrid's presidency amid the outrage over the club's decline.[91][92] Pérez continued with the Galácticos policy pursued in his first term, buying Kaká from Milan for a record-breaking (in pounds sterling) sum of £56 million,[93] and then breaking the record again by purchasing Cristiano Ronaldo from Manchester United for £80 million.[94] Real Madrid spent in excess of €261 million in the summer of 2009, and the assembled team was soon dubbed the Second Galácticos.[95] The 2009–10 season, however, was a transitional one as Madrid again finished second in the league, although this time amassing 96 points, the club's record at the time, and went out of the Champions League at the hands of Lyon. The season was marred by Cristiano Ronaldo's injury, that sidelined him for seven weeks,[96] although he still topped the goalscoring charts with 33 goals, and Madrid became the highest scoring team in La Liga, with 102 goals. Real Madrid also had the misfortune to become the runners-up with the highest points total in the history of Europe's top five leagues, until surpassed by Liverpool's 97 points in 2018–19.[97][98] José Mourinho took over as manager in May 2010.[99][100] In the 2010–11 season, the rebuilt Madrid successfully fought on all fronts, going toe to toe with a brilliant Barcelona side which some regard as the greatest team in football history. Ultimately, Madrid finished second in the league, with 92 points and four behind their perennial rivals, defeated them in the Copa del Rey final, and lost to Barça in the Champions League semi-finals, where Real progressed to for the first time since 2002–03. Moreover, from 16 April through 3 May, a rare occurrence happened when, for the first time ever, four Clásicos were to be played in a span of just 18 days. The first fixture was in the league campaign on 16 April (which ended 1–1 with penalty goals for both sides), the second one was in the Copa del Rey final (which was won by Madrid 1–0 a.e.t., bringing them their first trophy in the second Galáctico era) on 20 April and the third and fourth ones in the controversial[101][102] two-legged Champions League semi-finals on 27 April and 3 May (Barcelona won on aggregate with a 2–0 away victory and a 1–1 home draw).[103] Madrid again became the highest scoring team in La Liga, with 102 goals, repeating its output from the previous season, with Ronaldo scoring 40 and winning the European Golden Shoe. In the 2011–12 season, Real Madrid won La Liga for a record 32nd time in its history, also finishing the season with numerous league records set, including 100 points amassed in a single season, a total of 121 goals scored, a goal difference of +89, 16 away games won, and 32 wins overall.[104] They also competed in the UEFA Champions League for the 15th successive season,[105] losing in the semi-finals to Bayern Munich in a penalty shoot-out after a 3–3 aggregate tie. Madrid entered the Copa del Rey as the defending champions, but lost 3–4 on aggregate in the quarter-finals to Barcelona. In the same season, Cristiano Ronaldo became the fastest player to reach 100 goals scored in Spanish league history. In reaching 101 goals in 92 games, Ronaldo surpassed Real Madrid legend Ferenc Puskás, who scored 100 goals in 105 matches. Ronaldo set a new club mark for individual goals scored in one year (60) and became the first player ever to score against all 19 opposition teams in a single season.[106][107] Real Madrid started the 2012–13 season by winning the Supercopa de España, defeating Barcelona on away goals. However, the super cup turned out to be their only trophy of the season, despite being close to win them all. Real finished runners-up to Barça in La Liga, accumulating 85 points, and reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League for the third year in a row, where they were eliminated by Borussia Dortmund 3–4 on aggregate. Madrid also entered the Copa del Rey in the round of 32, going on a memorable run to the final, which saw them defeat Barcelona in the semi-finals before losing to Atlético Madrid 1–2 a.e.t. Real Madrid faced the Blaugrana six times throughout the season, coming away with three wins, two draws, and one loss. A major transfer of the season was the signing of Luka Modrić from Tottenham Hotspur for a fee in the region of £33 million.[108] After a loss to Atlético in the Copa del Rey final, Pérez announced the departure of José Mourinho at the end of the season by \"mutual agreement\".[109] On 25 June 2013, Carlo Ancelotti succeeded Mourinho to become the manager of Real Madrid on a three-year deal, with Zinedine Zidane named as one of his assistants.[110] On 1 September 2013, the long-awaited transfer of Gareth Bale from Tottenham Hotspur was announced. The transfer of the Welshman was reportedly a new world record signing, with the transfer price approximated at €100 million.[111] In Ancelotti's first season at the club, Real Madrid fought on all three fronts for the continental treble. Despite leading in the league campaign on multiple occasions, Madrid ultimately finished in third place (level on points with Barcelona and three behind cross-city rivals Atlético Madrid), collecting 87 points in total and scoring a record 104 goals.[112] By that time, Los Blancos had already secured the Copa del Rey – against rivals Barcelona – in April, with Bale scoring the winner.[113] The major breakthrough came in the UEFA Champions League, where Real returned to the final after twelve years, having beaten defending champions Bayern Munich 5–0 on aggregate in the semi-finals.[114] In the final, they defeated then-recently-league winners Atlético Madrid 4–1 a.e.t. to clinch their tenth European Cup (first since 2002) and become the first team to win ten European Cups/Champions League titles, an achievement known as \"La Décima\" (Spanish: \"The Tenth,\" [la ˈðeθima]).[115] Real's attacking trio of Bale, Benzema and Cristiano, dubbed the BBC, finished the season with 97 goals.[116] After winning the 2014 Champions League, Real Madrid signed goalkeeper Keylor Navas, midfielder Toni Kroos and attacking midfielder James Rodríguez.[117] In August, Madrid won the 2014 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla, the club's 79th official trophy.[118] During the last week of the 2014 summer transfer window, Real Madrid sold two players key to the previous season's successes: Xabi Alonso to Bayern Munich and Ángel Di María to Manchester United. This decision by the club was surrounded by controversy, with Cristiano Ronaldo stating, \"If I was in charge, maybe I would have done things differently,\" while Carlo Ancelotti admitted, \"We must start again from zero.\"[119] After a slow start to the 2014–15 season, Real Madrid went on a record-breaking 22-match winning streak, which included wins against Barcelona and Liverpool, surpassing the previous Spanish record of 18 successive wins set by Frank Rijkaard's Barça in the 2005–06 season.[120] In late December, Real Madrid won their first Club World Cup, defeating San Lorenzo 2–0 in the final.[121] The winning streak came to an end in their opening match of 2015 with a loss to Valencia, leaving the club two short of equalling the world record of 24 consecutive wins.[122] Madrid was in contention for both the La Liga title and the UEFA Champions League until the end but ultimately came up short, finishing with 92 points in the league, two behind treble-winning Barcelona and losing to Juventus 2–3 on aggregate in the Champions League semi-finals.[123] Ronaldo finished the season scoring 48 league goals, winning his fourth European Golden Shoe, and 61 goals in all competitions, breaking his record from 2011 to 2012.[124] Overall, despite playing an attractive attacking football and being the highest scoring team in Europe with 118 league goals,[125] several narrow defeats meant that Real finished the season with two trophies out of six possible, which contributed to the dismissal of Carlo Ancelotti on 25 May 2015.[126][127] On 3 June 2015, Rafael Benítez was confirmed as the new Real Madrid manager for the 2015–16 season, signing a three-year contract.[128] Real Madrid remained unbeaten in the league until a 3–2 loss at Sevilla on the matchday 11. This was followed by a 0–4 home loss in the first Clásico of the season against Barcelona. Perhaps, his reign is best remembered by multiple lopsided wins achieved both in La Liga and the Champions League (6–0 vs Espanyol, 8–0 vs Malmö, 10–2 vs Rayo Vallecano and others). In the Copa del Rey round of 32, Real accidentally fielded an ineligible player in a 3–1 first leg win at Cádiz and was disqualified from the tournament two days later by the competition judge, despite protests from president Pérez.[129][130][131] In the meantime, Madrid comfortably topped their UCL group with 16 points and a +16 goal difference. Benítez was relieved of his duties on 4 January 2016 following allegations of unpopularity with supporters, displeasure with players and a failure to produce good results against top teams.[132] Benítez's departure was announced along with the promotion of Zinedine Zidane to his first head coaching role.[133] Under Zidane, Madrid managed to turn the odds in its favour, ultimately winning the Champions League, something no one expected. The notable results include a 2–1 away victory over reigning treble winners Barcelona, who were on a record-breaking winning streak, a fantastic comeback against Wolfsburg in the Champions League quarter-finals (after losing the away game 0–2, Madrid erased the deficit and won 3–0 at home, courtesy of a Cristiano Ronaldo hat-trick), as well as a 12-game winning streak to conclude the league campaign, meaning Real finished second, with 90 points and just one point behind champions Barcelona, coming agonizingly close to clinching the title and overcoming a 12-point deficit in the process.[134] Finally, on 28 May, Real Madrid's eleventh Champions League title was won thanks to a 5–3 penalty shoot-out victory over rivals Atlético Madrid after a 1–1 draw in the final, with the achievement being termed \"La Undécima\".[135][136][127] Real Madrid began their 2016–17 campaign, which was to be Zidane's first full season in charge of the club, with a victory in the 2016 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla.[137] On 10 December 2016, Madrid played their 35th-straight match without a loss, which set a new club record.[138] On 18 December 2016, the club defeated Japanese outfit Kashima Antlers 4–2 in the final of the 2016 FIFA Club World Cup.[139] With a 3–3 draw at Sevilla in the second leg of the Copa del Rey round of 16 on 12 January 2017, Madrid progressed to the quarter-finals with a 6–3 aggregate victory and extended its unbeaten run to 40 matches, breaking Barcelona's Spanish record of 39 matches unbeaten in all competitions from the previous season.[140] Their unbeaten streak ended after a 1–2 away loss against the same opposition in La Liga three days later.[141] The team then was knocked out of the Copa del Rey by Celta Vigo 3–4 on aggregate. These slips, however, did not affect the overall trajectory of the season. In May, Madrid won the league title for a record 33rd time, their first title in five years, accumulating 93 points in the process.[142] On 3 June 2017, the club's victory over Juventus in the Champions League final resulted in Real Madrid becoming the first team to successfully defend their title in the UEFA Champions League era, and the first to win consecutive titles in the competition since Milan in 1989 and 1990, when the tournament was known as the European Cup.[143][144] Real Madrid's title was its 12th, extending the record, and its third in four years. The achievement is also known as \"La Duodécima\".[145] The 2016–17 season was the greatest campaign in terms of trophies won (four out of possible five) in the history of Real Madrid, an achievement that would be later equalled in the 2017–18 season.[146] Real kicked off the 2017–18 campaign by winning its second consecutive and fourth overall UEFA Super Cup in a 2–1 victory against Manchester United.[147] Five days later, Real Madrid beat Barcelona at the Camp Nou 3–1 in the first leg of the 2017 Supercopa de España and then defeated Barça 2–0 in the return leg, ending their 24 consecutive match scoring record in El Clásico matches and winning the second trophy of the season.[148] On 16 December 2017, Real beat Brazilian club Grêmio 1–0 in the FIFA Club World Cup final and became the first team to retain the trophy.[149] In the 2017–18 UEFA Champions League, Madrid once again progressed to the final where they defeated Liverpool 3–1 to become the first club to win three straight titles in the Champions League era, as well as the first team to win three consecutive titles in the European Cup/Champions League since Bayern Munich in 1976. The trophy also marked Madrid's fourth win in five years and their eighth consecutive semi-finals appearance. On 31 May, only five days after winning the final, Zidane announced his resignation as Real Madrid manager, citing the club's \"need for change\" as his rationale for departing.[150][151] Zidane's and Ronaldo's departures marked the end of the Second Galáctico Era that yielded four Champions League titles, two La Liga titles, two Copa del Rey, two Supercopa de España, three UEFA Super Cups, and three FIFA Club World Cup titles. The team was instrumental in ending Barcelona's dominance, despite the Blaugrana boasting arguably the greatest collection of talent in history,[152] and overshadowed the Catalans on the European stage.[153] Real Madrid was also somewhat notoriously unlucky in its league campaigns throughout these nine years, finishing runners-up with 96, 92 (twice) and 90 points, as well as on 87 points in third place, just three off the league winners.[98] On 12 June 2018, Real Madrid named Julen Lopetegui, the head coach of the Spanish national team, as their new manager. It was announced that he would officially begin his managerial duties after the 2018 FIFA World Cup. However, the Spanish national team sacked Lopetegui a day prior to the tournament, stating that he had negotiated terms with the club without informing them.[154][155] The club then began re-shaping the squad in the summer of 2018, which included the sale of Cristiano Ronaldo to Juventus for a reported €117 million.[156] Madrid began their 2018–19 campaign by losing to Atlético Madrid 2–4 a.e.t. in the 2018 UEFA Super Cup. After a 1–5 loss to Barcelona in El Clásico on 28 October which left Real Madrid in the ninth place with only 14 points after ten games, Lopetegui was dismissed a day later and replaced by then Castilla coach, Santiago Solari.[157] On 22 December 2018, Real Madrid beat Al Ain 4–1 in the FIFA Club World Cup and became the outright record winners of the Club World Cup with four titles.[158] However, they were then knocked out of the Copa del Rey at the semi-final stage by Barcelona, losing 1–4 on aggregate. On 5 March 2019, Real was defeated by Ajax 1–4 (3–5 on aggregate) at home, crashing out of the Champions League at the round of 16 stage after eight consecutive semi-finals appearances. On 11 March 2019, Real Madrid dismissed Solari and reinstated Zidane as the head coach of the club.[159] Madrid finished the season with 68 points and a +17 goal difference, its lowest totals since 2001–02 and 1999–2000 respectively.[160] In the summer of 2019, Madrid signed Eden Hazard, Luka Jović, Éder Militão, Ferland Mendy, Rodrygo, Reinier and other players for a total of more than €350 million.[161] On 12 January 2020, Madrid beat cross-city rivals Atlético Madrid in a penalty shootout in the Supercopa de España final to win their eleventh title.[162] After a three-month hiatus due to the COVID-19 outbreak in March 2020, La Liga was restarted in June and Madrid won ten games in a row to capture the team's 34th league title, collecting 87 points in total.[163] From the competition's resumption in June and until the end of the 2020–21 season, Real temporarily played home fixtures at the Alfredo Di Stéfano Stadium, while the Santiago Bernabéu underwent extensive renovations.[164][165] Zidane left a second time on 27 May 2021 after going trophyless that season,[166] with Carlo Ancelotti returning to coach the team for the 2021–22 season.[167] On the domestic front, he delivered two trophies out of possible three, winning La Liga and the Supercopa de España.[168][169][170] As such, Ancelotti won all six available top trophies at Madrid.[171] In the Champions League, Madrid produced one of the most memorable runs of all time,[172] defeating pre-tournament favourites Paris Saint-Germain,[173][174] defending champions and favourites Chelsea,[175] Premier League champions and heavy favourites Manchester City,[176] all in dramatic fashion,[177] and setting up the final against Liverpool, who were once again widely considered as favourites,[178] in a rematch of their 2018 encounter. A lone Vinícius Júnior goal sealed the 14th European Cup for Los Blancos, their fifth in nine years, and Ancelotti's second in charge.[179][180] Real also claimed their fourth ever European double (after 1956–57, 1957–58, and 2016–17). Despite Real's status as the most decorated team in the history of the Champions League, they were not favoured to win that year's edition, and their improbable run was widely considered a surprise.[181] After a highly successful 2021–22 season, Real Madrid signed German defender Antonio Rüdiger and French midfielder Aurélien Tchouaméni, while club legends Marcelo, Isco, Gareth Bale and Casemiro left the club. Real Madrid's 2022–23 season began with lifting the UEFA Super Cup and later the FIFA Club World Cup. The season ended with Real Madrid winning the 2022–23 Copa del Rey, but losing the La Liga and Spanish Super Cup to FC Barcelona and the Champions League to Manchester City, being defeated 5–1 on aggregate. In 2023, Real Madrid signed Jude Bellingham, who was given the number #5 jersey, previously used by Zinedine Zidane. Real also signed Arda Güler and Fran García. Meanwhile, Vinícius Júnior was given the number #7 jersey, previously used by Raúl and Cristiano Ronaldo; while Rodrygo was given the number #11 jersey, previously used by Gareth Bale. Karim Benzema left the club, while Toni Kroos would later announce that he would retire from football after this season. The 2023-24 season would prove to be another highly successful season for Los Blancos. First, Real Madrid lifted the Spanish Super Cup against Barcelona 4–1, taking revenge of the previous year's 3–0 defeat. Then, Real Madrid lifted the La Liga with relative ease, reaching 95 points, the second-best winning campaign by Real Madrid in La Liga history after the 2011–12 100 points season. In the 2023–24 UEFA Champions League, Real Madrid knocked out RB Leipzig in the Round of 16, then defending champions Manchester City in penalties. In the semifinals, Real Madrid faced Bayern Munich again. The first match was a 2–2 draw, while the second match in the Bernabéu was marked by a double by Joselu in the last few minutes of the game, with Bayern Munich suffering a historic comeback after leading 1–0. Real Madrid faced Borussia Dortmund in the final, and won 2–0, with Dani Carvajal being the man of the match and scoring with a header after a Toni Kroos corner, and Vinícius Júnior once again scoring in a UCL final. Real Madrid won their 15th Champions League without losing a single match during the campaign. Following the conclusion of the 2023–24 season, Real Madrid announced that striker Kylian Mbappé would be joining the club on a free transfer from Paris Saint-Germain in July 2024, concluding one of the most highly anticipated transfer sagas in modern history.[182] On 18 December 2024, Real Madrid clinched their second trophy of the season, uplifting the inaugural 2024 FIFA Intercontinental Cup by beating Pachuca 3-0.[183] The first crest had a simple design consisting of a decorative interlacing of the three initials of the club, \"MCF\" for Madrid Club de Fútbol, in dark blue on a white shirt. The first change in the crest occurred in 1908 when the letters adopted a more streamlined form and appeared inside a circle.[184] The next change in the configuration of the crest did not occur until the presidency of Pedro Parages in 1920. At that time, King Alfonso XIII granted the club his royal patronage which came in the form of the title \"Real Madrid,\" meaning \"Royal.\"[185] Thus, Alfonso's crown was added to the crest and the club styled itself Real Madrid Club de Fútbol.[184] With the dissolution of the monarchy in 1931, all royal symbols (the crown on the crest and the title of Real) were eliminated. The crown was replaced by the dark mulberry band of the Region of Castile.[49] In 1941, two years after Nationalist victory in the Civil War, the Francoist regime restored the crest's \"Real Corona\", or \"Royal Crown\", while the mulberry stripe of Castile was retained as well.[186][57] In addition, the whole crest was made full color, with gold being the most prominent, and the club went back to its honorific name Real Madrid Club de Fútbol.[184] The most recent modification to the crest occurred in 2001 when the club wanted to better situate itself for the 21st century and further standardize its crest. One of the modifications made was changing the mulberry stripe to a more bluish shade.[184] Real Madrid has maintained the white shirt for its home kit throughout the history of the club. There was, however, one season that the shirt and shorts were not both white. It was an initiative undertaken by Juan Padrós in honour of an English team Corinthian, which he had met on one of his trips, one of the most famous teams at the time known for its elegance and sportsmanship.[44] It was decided that Real Madrid would wear black shorts in an attempt to replicate the English team, which had also inspired Madrid's original white kit, but the initiative lasted just one year. After being eliminated from the cup by Barcelona with a 1–5 defeat in Madrid and a 2–0 defeat in Catalonia, President Parages decided to return to an all-white kit, claiming that the other kit brought bad luck.[note 3] By the early 1940s, the manager changed the kit again by adding buttons to the shirt and the club's crest on the left breast, which has remained ever since. On 23 November 1947, in a game against Atlético Madrid at the Metropolitano Stadium, Real Madrid became the first Spanish team to wear numbered shirts.[57] English club Leeds United permanently switched their blue shirt for a white one in the 1960s, to emulate the dominant Real Madrid of the era.[187] Real's traditional away colours are all blue or all purple. Since the advent of the replica kit market, the club has also released various other one colour designs, including red, green, orange and black. The club's kit is manufactured by Adidas, whose contract extends from 1998.[188][189] Real Madrid's first shirt sponsor, Zanussi, agreed for the 1982–83, 1983–84 and 1984–85 seasons. Following that, the club was sponsored by Parmalat and Otaysa before a long-term deal was signed with Teka in 1992.[190][191] In 2001, Real Madrid ended their contract with Teka and for one season and used the Realmadrid.com logo to promote the club's website. Then, in 2002, a deal was signed with Siemens and in 2006, the BenQ Siemens logo appeared on the club's shirt.[192] Real Madrid's shirt sponsor from 2007 until 2013 was bwin.com following the economic problems of BenQ Siemens.[193][194] Fly Emirates became their shirt sponsor in 2013, and in 2017 the club renewed the sponsorship with the airliner, signing a deal until 2022 worth €70 million per year.[195] In 2022, the agreement was again extended, until 2026.[196] In 2015, Madrid signed a new ten-year contract with Adidas, believed to be worth a total of £850 million (€1 billion), with the club earning £59 million (€64 million) per season. The contract includes a clause sanctioning penalty or agreement termination anytime, if Real Madrid fails to qualify for the European competitions or is relegated from La Liga.[197] Note: early termination clauses can be activated at any time depending on the team's performance. After moving between several grounds, the team relocated to the Campo de O'Donnell in 1912, which remained its home stadium for 11 years.[46] After this period, the club moved for one year to the Campo de Ciudad Lineal, a small ground with a capacity of 8,000 spectators. After that, Real Madrid started playing its home matches at the Estadio Chamartín, which was inaugurated on 17 May 1923 with a match against Newcastle United.[203] In this stadium, which hosted 22,500 spectators, Real Madrid celebrated its first Spanish league title.[48] Following his election in 1943, president Santiago Bernabéu decided that the Chamartín was not big enough for the ambitions of the club, and thus a new stadium was built and inaugurated on 14 December 1947.[57][204] Initially knows as Nuevo Chamartín, the stadium was renamed in honour of Bernabéu in 1955 and continues to bear his name to this day.[58] The first match at the Bernabéu was played between Madrid and the Portuguese club Belenenses, with Los Blancos winning 3–1 and Sabino Barinaga scoring the first goal.[57] The capacity has changed frequently, peaking at 120,000 after a 1953 expansion.[205] Since then, there have been a number of reductions due to modernizations (the last standing areas were removed in 1998–99 in response to UEFA regulations which had forbidden standing at matches in European competitions), countered to some extent by expansions.[205] The current capacity is 81,044 spectators. Real Madrid has the fourth-highest average attendance in Europe, behind Borussia Dortmund, Barcelona and Manchester United.[206][207][208][209] The Bernabéu has hosted the 1964 UEFA European Championship final, the 1982 FIFA World Cup final, and the 1957, 1969, 1980 and 2010 European Cup/Champions League finals.[210] The stadium has its own namesake Madrid Metro station along the 10 line.[211] On 14 November 2007, the Bernabéu was upgraded to Elite Football Stadium status by UEFA.[212] On 9 May 2006, the Alfredo Di Stéfano Stadium, named after club legend Alfredo Di Stéfano, was inaugurated in the Real Madrid City, where Real Madrid usually trains. The inaugural match was played between Real Madrid and Reims, a rematch of the 1956 European Cup final. Real Madrid 6–1, with goals from Sergio Ramos, Antonio Cassano (2), Roberto Soldado (2) and José Manuel Jurado. The venue is now part of the Ciudad Real Madrid, the club's training facility located outside Madrid, in Valdebebas. The stadium's capacity is 5,000 people, and it is Real Madrid Castilla's home ground.[213] For the latter part of the 2019–20 season and throughout the 2020–21 season, the stadium hosted the first team's home games due to a combination of the COVID-19 pandemic-triggered restrictions and an extensive renovation of the Santiago Bernabéu.[214][165] The latest renovation of the Santiago Bernabéu is set to increase the capacity by approximately 4,000 with the addition of an extra tier, bringing it to nearly 85,000.[215][216] Furthermore, the height will also be increased by ten metres and a retractable roof, a retractable pitch and a 360-degree screen will be installed.[217][218] The works have started in 2019, and the renovated stadium was initially planned to be unveiled in 2022; however, the COVID-19 pandemic and Russian invasion of Ukraine caused significant disruption to supply chains, prompting the club to postpone the stadium's inauguration to 2023.[219][220] Raúl holds the record for most appearances with Real Madrid, with 741 appearances from 1994 to 2010. Iker Casillas comes second with 725 appearances, followed by Manuel Sanchis Jr., having played 710 times.[221] The record for a goalkeeper is held by Iker Casillas, with 725 appearances. With 63 goals, Cristiano Ronaldo has scored the most international goals while playing for the club. Meanwhile, Sergio Ramos has accumulated the most caps while playing for the club, with 176. Cristiano Ronaldo (2009–2018) is Real Madrid's all-time top goalscorer, with 450 goals in 438 matches.[222][223] Six other players have also scored over 200 goals for Real: Alfredo Di Stéfano (1953–1964), Santillana (1971–1988), Ferenc Puskás (1958–1966), Hugo Sánchez (1985–1992), Karim Benzema (2009–2023) and the previous goalscoring record-holder Raúl (1994–2010). Cristiano Ronaldo also holds the record for the most league goals scored in one season (48 in 2014–15), alongside being Real's top goalscorer of all time in La Liga history with 311 goals. Di Stéfano's 49 goals in 58 matches was for decades the all-time highest tally in the European Cup, until it was surpassed by Raúl in 2005, and is now held by Cristiano Ronaldo with 105 goals for Madrid and 140 overall. The fastest goal in the history of the club (13 seconds) was scored by the Chilean Iván Zamorano on 3 September 1994 during a league match against Sevilla.[224] Officially, the highest home attendance figure for a Real Madrid match is 129,690, which was for a European Cup match in 1956 against Milan. The current official capacity of the Santiago Bernabéu is 80,000.[225] Real has also set records in Spanish football, most notably the most domestic titles (36 as of 2023–24) and the most seasons won in a row (five, during 1960–65 and 1985–90).[1] With 121 matches (from 17 February 1957 to 7 March 1965), the club holds the record for longest unbeaten run at home in La Liga.[226] The club also holds the record for winning the European Cup/UEFA Champions League fifteen times[227] and for the most semi-finals appearances (33). As of June 2024, Cristiano Ronaldo is the all-time top scorer in the UEFA Champions League, with 140 (141 including qualifiers) goals in total, 105 while playing for Real Madrid. The team has the record number of consecutive participations in the European Cup (before it became the Champions League) with 15, from 1955–56 to 1969–70.[228] Among the club's on-field records is a 22-game winning streak in all competitions during the 2014–15 season, a Spanish record. In September 2017, the club equalled the record of the Brazilian club Santos, starring Pelé, by scoring in their 73rd consecutive game, before Bayern Munich breaks the record in 2021.[229] In June 2009, the club broke its own record for the highest transfer fee ever paid in the history of football after purchasing Manchester United star Cristiano Ronaldo for €94 million (£80 million).[230][231] The fee of €77.5 million (100 billion lire) for Zinedine Zidane's transfer from Juventus to Real Madrid in 2001 was the previous highest transfer fee ever paid. This record (in pounds sterling) had been broken previously in June 2009, for a few days, when Real Madrid agreed to buy Kaká from Milan for €67 million (£65 million). The transfer of Tottenham Hotspur's Gareth Bale in 2013 was reportedly a new world record signing, with the transfer fee approximated at around €100 million.[111] In January 2016, documents pertaining to Bale's transfer were leaked which confirmed a world record transfer fee of €100,759,418.[232] Real Madrid equalled their record signing in 2019, when the club signed Eden Hazard from Chelsea for a reported €115 million.[233] The club's record sale occurred on 10 July 2018, when Juventus signed Cristiano Ronaldo for €117 million.[234] During most home matches, the majority of the seats in the stadium are occupied by season-ticket holders, of which the figure is capped at 65,000.[235] To become a season ticket holder one must first be a socio, or club member. In addition to members, the club has more than 1,800 peñas (official, club-affiliated supporters' groups) in Spain and around the world. Real Madrid has the second highest average all-time attendance in Spanish football and regularly attracts over 74,000 fans to the Bernabéu. One of the best supported teams globally, Real Madrid was the first sports team (and first brand) to reach 100 million fans on Facebook in April 2017.[236][237] Real Madrid's hardcore supporters are the so-called Ultras Sur supporters, or simply Ultras. They are known for their extreme right-wing politics, akin to Barcelona's hardcore supporters group Boixos Nois. The Ultras Surs have developed an alliance with other right wing groups, most notably Lazio Irriducibili fans, and have also developed an alliance with left-wing groups. On several occasions, they have racially abused opposing players, and have been investigated by UEFA for doing so.[238][239] Florentino Pérez took it upon himself to ban the Ultras from the Bernabéu and assign their seats to the general public. This decision was controversial with some of the Bernabéu faithful, however, as the lively atmosphere of games would suffer as a result.[240][241] The Ultras have since held protests outside the Bernabéu and have demanded to be reinstated and allowed to enter the grounds.[242] Questioned over Pope Francis' adherence to 2014 FIFA Club World Cup Final opponents San Lorenzo, Madrid captain Sergio Ramos stated: \"In the semi-finals we noticed the love from supporters in Marrakesh and it seemed like we were playing at home. That sums up the greatness of this team. Madrid is God's team and the team of the world\".[243] Among the club's famous supporters is golfer Sergio García, who was invited to take the honorary kickoff for El Clásico at the Bernabeu wearing his green jacket from winning the 2017 Masters.[244] There is often a fierce rivalry between the two strongest teams in a national league, and this is particularly the case in La Liga, where the game between Real Madrid and Barcelona is known as \"The Classic\" (El Clásico). From the start of national competitions the clubs were seen as representatives of two rival regions in Spain: Castile and Catalonia, as well as of the two cities. The rivalry reflects what many regard as the political and cultural tensions felt between the Castilians and Catalans, seen by one author as a re-enactment of the Spanish Civil War.[245] Over the years, the record for Real Madrid and Barcelona is 105 victories for Madrid, 101 victories for Barcelona, and 52 draws as at December 2024.[246] As early as the 1930s, Barcelona \"had developed a reputation as a symbol of Catalan identity, opposed to the centralising tendencies of Madrid\".[248][249] During the dictatorships of Miguel Primo de Rivera and especially Francisco Franco, all regional languages and identities in Spain were frowned upon and restrained. As such, most citizens of Barcelona were in strong opposition to Franco's regime. In that period, Barcelona gained their motto Més que un club (English: More than a club) because of its alleged connection to Catalan nationalist as well as to progressive beliefs.[250] There is an ongoing controversy as to what extent Franco's rule (1939–75) influenced the activities and on-pitch results of both Barcelona and Real Madrid. Fans of both clubs tend to exaggerate the myths favouring their narratives. Most historians agree that Franco did not have a preferred football team, but his Spanish nationalist beliefs led him to associate himself with the establishment teams, such as Atlético Aviación and Madrid FC (that recovered its \"royal\" name after the fall of the Republic and again became Real Madrid). On the other hand, he also wanted the renamed Barcelona succeed as \"Spanish team\", rather than a Catalan one. During the early years of Franco's rule, Real Madrid were not particularly successful, winning two Copa del Generalísimo titles and a Copa Eva Duarte; Barcelona claimed three league titles, one Copa del Generalísimo and one Copa Eva Duarte. During that period, Atlético Aviación were believed to be the preferred team over Real Madrid. The most contested stories of the period include Real Madrid's 11–1 home win against Barcelona in the Copa del Generalísimo, where the Catalan team alleged intimidation, and the controversial transfer of Alfredo Di Stéfano to Real Madrid, despite his agreement with Barcelona. The latter transfer was part of Real Madrid chairman Santiago Bernabéu's \"revolution\" that ushered in the era of unprecedented dominance. Bernabéu, himself a veteran of the Civil War who fought for Franco's forces, saw Real Madrid on top, not only of Spanish, but also European football, helping create the European Cup, the first true competition for Europe's best club sides. His vision was fulfilled when Real Madrid not only started winning consecutive league titles, but also swept the first five editions of the European Cup in the 1950s.[251] These events had a profound impact on Spanish football and influenced Franco's attitude. According to historians, during this time he realized the importance of Real Madrid for his regime's international image, and the club became his preferred team until his death. Fernando Maria Castiella, who served as Minister of Foreign Affairs under Franco from 1957 until 1969, noted that \"[Real Madrid] is the best embassy we have ever had\". Franco died in 1975, and the Spanish transition to democracy soon followed. Under his rule, Real Madrid had won 14 league titles, six Copa del Generalísimo titles, one Copa Eva Duarte, six European Cups, two Latin Cups and one Intercontinental Cup. In the same period, Barcelona had won eight league titles, nine Copa del Generalísimo titles, three Copa Eva Duarte titles, three Inter-Cities Fairs Cups and two Latin Cups.[252][186] The rivalry was intensified during the 1950s when the clubs disputed the signing of Alfredo Di Stéfano. Di Stéfano had impressed both Barcelona and Real Madrid while playing for Los Millonarios in Bogotá, Colombia, during a players' strike in his native Argentina. Soon after Millonarios' return to Colombia, Barcelona directors visited Buenos Aires and agreed with River Plate, the last FIFA-affiliated team to have held Di Stéfano's rights, for his transfer in 1954 for the equivalent of 150 million Italian lira (according to other sources 200,000 dollars). This started a battle between the two Spanish rivals for his rights. FIFA appointed Armando Muñoz Calero, former president of the Spanish Football Federation as mediator. Calero decided to let Di Stéfano play the 1953–54 and 1955–56 seasons in Madrid, and the 1954–55 and 1956–57 seasons in Barcelona. The agreement was approved by the Football Association and their respective clubs. Although the Catalans agreed, the decision created various discontent among the Blaugrana members and the president was forced to resign in September 1953. Barcelona sold Madrid their half-share, and Di Stéfano moved to Los Blancos, signing a four-year contract. Real paid 5.5 million Spanish pesetas for the transfer, plus a 1.3 million bonus for the purchase, an annual fee to be paid to the Millonarios, and a 16,000 salary for Di Stéfano with a bonus double that of his teammates, for a total of 40% of the annual revenue of the Madrid club.[253] Di Stéfano became integral in the subsequent success achieved by Real Madrid, scoring twice in his first game against Barcelona. With him, Madrid won the first five editions of the European Cup.[254] The 1960s saw the rivalry reach the European stage when Real Madrid and Barcelona met twice in the European Cup, with Madrid triumphing en route to their fifth consecutive title in 1959–60 and Barcelona prevailing en route to losing the final in 1960–61. Ahead of the 1973–74 season, Johan Cruyff arrived to Barcelona for a world record £920,000 from Ajax.[255] Already an established player with Ajax, Cruyff quickly won over the Barcelona fans when he told the European press that he chose Barcelona over Real Madrid because he could not play for a club associated with Francisco Franco. He further endeared himself when he named his son \"Jordi\", after the local Catalan Saint George.[256] In 2002, the European encounter between the clubs was dubbed the \"Match of The Century\" by Spanish media, and Madrid's win was watched by more than 500 million people around the world.[257] A fixture known for its intensity and indiscipline, it has also featured memorable goal celebrations from both teams, often involving mocking the opposition.[258] In October 1999, Real Madrid forward Raúl silenced 100,000 Barcelona fans at the Camp Nou when he scored before he celebrated by putting a finger to his lips as if telling the crowd to be quiet.[258][259] In 2009, Barcelona captain Carles Puyol kissed his Catalan armband in front of Madrid fans at the Bernabéu.[258] Cristiano Ronaldo twice gestured to the hostile crowd to \"calm down\" after scoring against Barcelona at the Camp Nou in 2012 and 2016.[258] In April 2017, Messi celebrated his 93rd-minute winner for Barcelona against Real Madrid at the Bernabéu by taking off his Barcelona shirt and holding it up to incensed Real Madrid fans – with his name and number facing them.[258] Later that year, in August, Ronaldo was subbed on in the first leg of the Supercopa de España, proceeded to score in the 80th minute and took his shirt off before holding it up to Barça's fans with his name and number facing them.[260] The club's nearest neighbour is Atlético Madrid, a rivalry being shared between fans of both football teams. Although Atlético was founded by three Basque students in 1903, it was joined in 1904 by dissident members of \"Madrid FC\". The two teams met for the first time on 2 December 1906 in the regional championship, with Real Madrid winning 2–1. Their first league meeting came on 21 February 1929 in matchday three of the first league championship at the former Chamartín. It was the first official derby of the new tournament, and Real won 2–1.[48] After the Civil War, during the early Francoist period, Atlético became associated with the military air force (and thus renamed Atlético Aviación), although the alleged preference of the regime for the club is subject to discussion. In any case, during this period Atlético became the most successful club in Spain, reducing the historical gap between the two clubs, until the regime preference shifted towards Real Madrid in the 1950s, as Franco sought to make political capital out of Real Madrid's multiple European Cup titles at a time when Spain was internationally isolated; one minister said, \"Real Madrid are the best ambassadors we've ever had.\"[186] Thus, Atlético fans regularly chanted that Real were \"El equipo del gobierno, la vergüenza del país\" – \"The team of the government, the shame of the country\" – and allegedly adopted a more left-wing slant (tempered by the rise of ultras culture and Rayo Vallecano's presence as the \"true\" leftist club in Madrid).[261][262] The rivalry first gained international attention in 1959 during the European Cup when the two clubs met in the semi-finals. Real won the first leg 2–1 at the Santiago Bernabéu, while Atlético won 1–0 at the Metropolitano. The tie went to a replay, which Real won 2–1. Atlético, however, gained some revenge when, led by former Real Madrid coach José Villalonga, it defeated its city rivals in two successive Copa del Generalísimo finals in 1960 and 1961.[263] In the 1970s, Atlético again took the lead as the most successful Spanish club of the decade, which prompted the Real Madrid fanbase to look down on Atlético calling them and their supporters \"Indios\" (Indians, a reference to the Latin American players signed by the Red-and-whites).[264] By then, Real Madrid did not want to sign non-Caucasian players (president Santiago Bernabéu even stated, when he decided not to sign Portuguese star Eusebio at the end of the 1960s, \"Mientras yo viva, aquí no jugará ningún negro ni un blanco con bigote\" (\"As long as I live, no black or white with a mustache will play here\").[265] Atlético's supporters accepted the new \"Indian\" nickname joyfully and have been using it until today. The Santiago Bernabéu, Real Madrid's stadium, is alongside banks and businesses on the upper class Paseo de la Castellana street, while the Vicente Calderón (the stadium that Atlético Madrid used until the 2016–17 season) could be found near a brewery, alongside the Manzanares River and a motorway. Real draw greater support all across the region because of their historically greater resources and success, while Atlético have a relatively working class fan base mainly from the south of the city, with some fans also scattered throughout the city.[266][267] In fact, the Atlético crest includes the Coat of arms of Madrid, whereas Real crest has no such a reference to the city (instead, it includes a reference to the broader Castile region). Between 1961 and 1989, when Real dominated La Liga, only Atlético offered it any serious challenge, winning league titles in 1966, 1970, 1973 and 1977. In 1965, Atlético became the first team to beat Real at the Bernabéu in eight years. Real Madrid's record against Atlético in more recent times has been favourable.[268] A high point came in the 2002–03 season, when Real clinched the La Liga title after a 4–0 victory at the Vicente Calderón. Atlético's first win over its city rivals since 1999 came in the Copa del Rey final in May 2013. In 2013–14, Real and Atlético were finalists of the UEFA Champions League, the first final which hosted two clubs from the same city. Real Madrid triumphed with a 4–1 comeback victory in extra time.[269] On 7 February 2015, Real suffered their first defeat in 14 years at the Vicente Calderón, a 4–0 loss.[270] On 28 May 2016, Real and Atlético again met for the Champions League title, which resulted in a win for Real after a penalty shootout at San Siro.[271] A further minor rivalry exists between Real Madrid and Athletic Bilbao. This is known as El Viejo Clásico (the old classic),[272] so named as the two clubs were dominant in the first half of the 20th century, meeting in nine Copa del Rey finals including the first in 1903.[273][274] Until 10 December 2011, this fixture was the most played in the history of Spanish football, when it was surpassed by El Clásico.[275] Athletic Bilbao, who operate a policy of only using local players,[276] have long since ceased to be a competitive rival to clubs such as Real Madrid who scour the globe for the best talent; the Lions won only two of the 26 matches between the teams from 2005–06 to 2016–17.[272][277][278] However, the matches remain keenly fought due to their historical and cultural significance, with some parallels to the political aspect of the Barcelona/Catalonia rivalry as Athletic are the largest club in the Basque region.[279][262][280] Real Madrid and Bayern Munich are two of the most successful clubs in the UEFA Champions League/European Cup competition, with Real winning 15 times and Bayern winning six times.[281][282] Although they have never met in a final, Real Madrid versus Bayern is the match that has historically been played most often in the Champions League/European Cup with 26 matches (twelve wins for Madrid, eleven wins for Bayern, with three draws),[283] with several controversial incidents occurring due to the great importance of most of their meetings.[284][285][286] Real Madrid supporters often refer to Bayern as the \"Bestia negra\" (\"Black Beast\"). During the 2010s, the two teams met in the 2011–12 Champions League semi-finals, which ended 3–3 on aggregate (Bayern won 3–1 on penalties after extra time, but lost the final at their own stadium by the same method), then at the same stage in the 2013–14 edition with Real Madrid winning 5–0 on aggregate,[287] and again in 2017–18 with the Spanish club progressing 4–3;[288] both times they went on to win the competition. Another match that is often played in the European Cup/Champions League is Real Madrid vs Juventus, the most decorated Italian club. They have played each other in 21 matches and have an almost perfectly balanced record (nine wins for Juventus, ten wins for Real Madrid and two draws), as well as nearly the same goal difference (Madrid ahead 26 to 25).[289][290][291] Their first meeting was in the quarter-finals of the 1961–62 European Cup, which Real Madrid won 3–1 in a replay held in Paris.[290] At the quarter-final stage in 1995–96, Juventus prevailed 2–1 over the two legs and went on to lift the trophy.[290] In the 1998 UEFA Champions League Final between the teams in Amsterdam, Real Madrid won 1–0.[290][292] They met again in the 2002–03 UEFA Champions League semi-finals, when both clubs were in their respective 'golden eras'; Juventus won 4–3 on aggregate.[290] By that time, star midfielder Zinedine Zidane, who played for the Bianconeri in the 1998 final, had moved from Turin to Madrid in a world record €77 million deal.[293] The teams met again in the 2013–14 UEFA Champions League group stage, with Madrid winning 2–1 at home and drawing 2–2 away en route to their tenth title. In the 2014–15 UEFA Champions League semi-finals, former Real Madrid player Álvaro Morata scored one goal in each leg to take Juventus to the final, winning 3–2 on aggregate, while Cristiano Ronaldo scored both goals for Madrid.[290] They faced off again in the 2017 UEFA Champions League Final in Cardiff, with Ronaldo scoring twice as Real Madrid won 4–1.[290][294][295] The latest Champions League meeting was in the 2017–18 quarter-finals, which Real Madrid won 4–3 on aggregate; the tie ended in dramatic and controversial fashion, with a debatable penalty awarded to Real Madrid in the last minute of the second leg after Juventus built a 3–0 lead at the Bernabeu to pull level in the tie following a defeat at the Allianz Stadium by the same scoreline.[296][297] Cristiano Ronaldo scored three goals over the two matches including the decisive penalty and a spectacular overhead kick,[298] and having won the Champions League with Madrid for a fourth time,[299] he transferred to Juventus a few months later for a €117 million fee.[300] It was under Florentino Pérez's first presidency (2000–2006) that Real Madrid started its ambition of becoming the world's richest professional football club.[301] The club ceded part of its training grounds to the city of Madrid in 2001, and sold the rest to four corporations: Repsol YPF, Mutua Automovilística de Madrid, Sacyr Vallehermoso and OHL. The sale eradicated the club's debts, paving the way for it to buy the world's most expensive players, such as Zinedine Zidane, Luís Figo, Ronaldo and David Beckham. The city had previously rezoned the training grounds for development, a move which in turn increased their value, and then bought the site.[79] The European Commission started an investigation into whether the city overpaid for the property, to be considered a form of state subsidy.[302] The sale of the training ground for office buildings cleared Real Madrid's debts of €270 million and enabled the club to embark upon an unprecedented spending spree which brought big-name players to the club. In addition, profit from the sale was spent on a state-of-the-art training complex on the city's outskirts.[303] Although Pérez's policy resulted in increased financial success from the exploitation of the club's high marketing potential around the world, especially in Asia, it came under increasing criticism for being too focused on marketing the Real Madrid brand and not enough on the performances of the team.[82] By September 2007, Real Madrid was considered the most valuable football brand in Europe by BBDO. In 2008, it was ranked the second-most valuable club in world football, at €951 million (£640 million / $1.285 billion),[304] only beaten by Manchester United, which was valued at €1.333 billion (£900 million).[305] In 2010, Real Madrid had the highest turnover in football worldwide.[306] In September 2009, Real Madrid's management announced plans to open the club's own dedicated theme park by 2013.[307] A study at Harvard University concluded that Real Madrid \"is one of the 20 most important brand names and the only one in which its executives, the players, are well-known. We have some spectacular figures in regard to worldwide support of the club. There are an estimated 287 million people worldwide who follow Real Madrid.\"[308] In 2010, Forbes evaluated Real Madrid's worth to be around €992 million (US$1.323 billion), ranking them second only to Manchester United, based on figures from the 2008–09 season.[309][310] According to Deloitte, Real Madrid had a recorded revenue of €401 million in the same period, ranking first.[311] Along with Barcelona, Athletic Bilbao and Osasuna, Real Madrid is organised as a registered association. This means that the club is owned by its supporters, who elect the president. The president cannot invest his own money,[312] and the club can only spend what it earns, which is mainly derived through sponsorships, commercial partnerships, merchandise sales, television rights, prize money and ticket sales. Unlike a limited company, it is not possible to purchase shares in the club, but only a membership.[313] The members of Real Madrid, called \"socios\", form an assembly of delegates which is the highest governing body of the club.[314] As of 2010, the club had 60,000 socios.[315] At the end of the 2009–10 season, the club's board of directors stated that Real Madrid had a net debt of €244.6 million, €82.1 million lower than the previous fiscal year. Real Madrid announced that it had a net debt of €170 million after the 2010–11 season.

(2007). The film follows former Newcastle United star Santiago Muñez as he is first scouted and then signed by Real Madrid for the 2005–06 season. The film's creators wanted to put emphasis on the changes in Muñez's life after his move to Madrid.

Real Madrid was officially founded in 1902, though its history can be traced back to 1897. It joined the Royal Spanish Football Federation in 1909. Real Madrid has won 15 European Cup/Champions League titles, far more than any other team. Real Madrid has won the Copa del Rey, Spain’s main football cup competition, 20 times. Real Madrid played at several venues until club president Santiago Bernabéu spearheaded the construction of the stadium that today bears his name. Opened in 1947, the Bernabéu holds more than 80,000 spectators. Real Madrid's biggest rivalry is with FC Barcelona. Matches between Barcelona and Real Madrid are known as El Clásico (“The Classic”). Real Madrid, Spanish professional football (soccer) club based in Madrid. Known for their all-white uniforms, which led to its nickname “Los Blancos,” Real Madrid is one of the world’s best-known teams. Real Madrid grew out of Football Club Sky, a team formed in Madrid in 1897. The club was officially founded in 1902 and joined the Royal Spanish Football Federation in 1909. Real Madrid played at a variety of venues until ambitious club president Santiago Bernabéu spearheaded the construction of the stadium that bears his name. Opened in 1947, the Bernabéu holds more than 80,000 spectators and was the venue for the 1982 Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) World Cup final. The European Cup was first held during the 1955–56 season, with a prestigious field consisting of clubs that had won their own country’s league championship. Real Madrid was the tournament’s first winner, defeating French club Stade de Reims in the final. It continued on a run of European dominance that no team has matched since. Gifted players such as Ferenc Puskás, Alfredo Di Stéfano, Paco Gento, Hector Rial, and Miguel Muñoz helped the club win the first five European Cups in a row. The club’s play in the 1960 European Cup final against the West German team Eintracht Frankfurt—a 7–3 Real victory—is widely considered one of the finest club performances of all time. Real has won a total of 15 European Cup/Champions League titles, far more than any other team. 1956, 1957, 1958, 1959, 1960, 1966, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2014, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2022, 2024 Real Madrid has won more Spanish top-division (La Liga) championships (36) than any other Spanish side. The club has also won the Copa del Rey, the main Spanish cup competition, 20 times and the Supercopa de España (Spanish Super Cup) 13 times. It won UEFA Cup twice, in 1985 and 1986. Real’s local competition is Atlético Madrid, but the club’s biggest rivalry is with FC Barcelona. The tension between the football clubs from Spain’s two biggest cities was amplified by a struggle between the teams in the 1950s to sign Di Stéfano, who reneged on a proposed deal with Barcelona to sign with Madrid, helping Real become a football power in the 1950s and ’60s. Matches between Barcelona and Real Madrid are known as El Clásico (“The Classic”) and are watched throughout Spain, in large part because the two sides symbolize for many the ongoing political and cultural difficulties between Castilian (Real) and Catalonian (Barcelona) Spain. From the late 1990s Real Madrid spent enormous sums on luring some of the world’s most famous foreign players to the club, where they are known as galácticos (“superstars”). Those players were often the most expensive (by transfer fee) footballers in the world and included such stars as David Beckham, Luis Figo, Ronaldo, Zinedine Zidane, Kaká, Cristiano Ronaldo, and James Rodriguez. Sergio Ramos and Iker Casillas are other notable players of this era. Following his departure from Paris Saint-Germain after the 2023–24 season, Kylian Mbappé joined Real Madrid.",

Nicknamed \"Jimmy Buckets\", he is a six-time NBA All-Star, a five-time All-NBA Team member, and a five-time NBA All-Defensive Team member. He won a gold medal as a member of the 2016 U.S. Olympic team. Butler played one year of college basketball for Tyler Junior College before transferring to Marquette University. He was selected with the 30th overall pick in the 2011 NBA draft by the Chicago Bulls. In 2015, he was named the NBA Most Improved Player. After six seasons in Chicago, he was traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves in June 2017, and was then again traded in November 2018, this time to the Philadelphia 76ers.

When he was 13 years old and living in the Houston suburb of Tomball, his mother kicked him out of the house. As Butler remembered it in a 2011 interview, she told him, \"I don't like the look of you. You gotta go.\" He moved between the homes of various friends, staying for a few weeks at a time before moving to another house.[5] Butler maintains a relationship with his parents, saying, \"I don't hold grudges. I still talk to my family. My mom. My father. We love each other. That's never going to change.\"[6][7] In a summer basketball league before his senior year at Tomball High School, he was noticed by Jordan Leslie, a freshman football and basketball player at the school, who challenged him to a three-point shooting contest. The two became friends, and Butler stayed at Leslie's house for a few months, Leslie's mother and stepfather had six other children between them. Butler would later say, \"They accepted me into their family. And it wasn't because of basketball. She [Michelle Lambert, Leslie's mother] was just very loving. She just did stuff like that. I couldn't believe it.\"[5] As a junior at Tomball High, Butler averaged 10 points per game. As a senior and team captain in 2006–07, Butler averaged 19.9 points and 8.7 rebounds per game and was subsequently voted his team's most valuable player.

Heat reached the NBA Finals after defeating the Boston Celtics in the Eastern Conference Finals in six games, earning Butler his first finals appearance.[88] In Game 3 of the NBA Finals, Butler finished with 40 points, 11 rebounds, and 13 assists and became the third player in finals history to record a 40+ point triple-double, joining LeBron James (then with Cleveland) in 2015 and Jerry

eight assists. In Game 5, Butler had 35 points, 12 rebounds, 11 assists, and 5 steals to become the first player to register 35+ points, 10+ rebounds, 10+ assists and 5+ steals in a finals game.

Butler became the second player with multiple 30-point triple-doubles in the same finals series, joining James in 2015. He became the sixth player with multiple triple-doubles in a finals series along with James, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Wilt Chamberlain and Draymond Green.[90] The Heat came up short against the Los Angeles Lakers in six games.[91] Butler became only the second player in a finals series to lead his team in points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocks, joining James in 2016.

Together with teammate Bam Adebayo who posted 16 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists, they became the first pair in league history to register triple-doubles in the same game more than once.[95][96] Butler finished the regular season leading the league in steals with 2.1 steals per game. In the playoffs, the Heat were eliminated in a four-game sweep by the Milwaukee Bucks, who would go on to win the NBA Finals. In Game 4, Butler recorded his third career playoff triple-double.[97] On August 7, 2021, Butler was signed to a reported four-year, $184 million contract extension by the Heat.[98][99] On December 28, he recorded 25 points, eight rebounds, and a career-high 15 assists in a 119–112 loss to the Washington Wizards.[100] On January 23, 2022, during a matchup against the Los Angeles Lakers and LeBron James, Butler surpassed James for first place on the Heat all-time triple-doubles list.[101] On February 3, Butler was named a reserve for the 2022 NBA All-Star Game, making it his sixth career All-Star selection.[102] On April 7, Butler and Miami clinched the No. 1 seed in the Eastern Conference. On April 17, during Game 1 of the first round of the playoffs, he logged 21 points, six rebounds, four assists and three steals in a 115–91 win over the Atlanta Hawks.[103] Two days later, he posted a then playoff career-high 45 points along with five rebounds, five assists and zero turnovers in a Game 2 115–105 win. Butler became only the third player in franchise history to have at least 45 points, five assists and five rebounds in a postseason game, joining James and Dwyane Wade. He also became the fifth player since 1978 to have at least 45 points and zero turnovers in an NBA playoff game.[104][105] In Game 4 of the series, on April 24, Butler recorded 36 points, 10 rebounds, four assists and four steals in a 110–86 win.[106] On May 8, in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference Semifinals, Butler recorded 40 points on 13-of-20 shooting from the field in a 116–108 loss to the Philadelphia 76ers.[107] On May 17, in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Finals, Butler posted 41 points (27 in the second half), nine rebounds, five assists, four steals and three blocks in a 118–107 win over the Boston Celtics. He became the first player in NBA postseason history to meet all of those benchmarks since steals and blocks were first recorded in 1974. Butler posted his fifth career playoff game with 40 points on 60 percent shooting, and tied with Charles Barkley for third-most over the last 30 playoffs. The only players that have more such games are James (12) and Shaquille O'Neal (8). Butler also achieved the most 40-point, 5-rebound and 5-assist playoff games in Heat history with three, one more than James and Wade.[108][109] On May 21, Butler injured his right knee and did not play in the second half of Game 3. Despite this, Miami won the game 109–103 and took a 2–1 series lead.[110] In Game 6 of the series, on May 27, Butler scored a playoff career-high 47 points along with nine rebounds, eight assists, and four steals to lead Miami to a 111–103 win and force Game 7. He made 16 of 29 shots, including 4-of-8 from the three-point range and all 11 free throws. Butler's 47 points were the seventh-most in NBA history for a player facing elimination. He also became the first player since Michael Jordan in 1988 to have multiple games of at least 40 points and four steals in the same series.[111][112] The Heat lost the series in seven games, despite Butler's 35-point and nine-rebound outing in a 100–96 loss in a decisive Game 7, where he missed his game-winning three-pointer with 16 seconds left in the game.[113][114] Butler had his eighth 30-point game of the postseason, making it the most in a single postseason by a Heat player since James in 2013, who also had eight such games.[115][116] On November 10, 2022, Butler scored a season-high 35 points, along with 10 rebounds and eight assists in an 117–112 overtime win over the Charlotte Hornets. He scored eight consecutive Heat points at the end of regulation just to get them into the extra session.[117] On December 2, Butler returned to the lineup after missing the previous seven games with a sore right knee. He had a season-high 15 rebounds and 25 points in a 120–116 overtime win over the reigning Eastern Conference champions Boston Celtics.[118] On January 10, 2023, Butler tied his season-high with 35 points, along with seven rebounds, four assists, four steals and three blocks in an 112–111 win over the Oklahoma City Thunder. He led the way going 23-of-23 from the free throw line, tying Dominique Wilkins for the second-most made free throws without a miss in NBA history. The Heat set an NBA record by making all 40 of their free throws, the last of those coming on Butler's three-point play with 12.9 seconds left in the game.[119] On February 10, Butler made a game-winning alley-oop dunk in a 97–95 win over the Houston Rockets.[120] On March 11, Butler scored a season-high 38 points, including 15 in the final six minutes of the fourth quarter when Miami overcame a 15-point deficit. His three-pointer at the buzzer of regulation sent the game to overtime, which the Heat lost 126–114 in against the Orlando Magic.[121] On April 1, Butler recorded a season-high 12 assists and 35 points on 12-of-16 shooting from the field in a 129–122 win over the Dallas Mavericks.[122] On April 14, Butler in his second play-in appearance scored a game-high 31 points to help the Heat take a 102–91 win over his former team, the Chicago Bulls, and secure the eighth seed for the playoffs. He and Max Strus became the third Heat duo with 30 points apiece in a playoff or play-in game.[123] In Game 1 of the Heat's first round playoff series against the top-seeded Milwaukee Bucks, Butler recorded 35 points, 5 rebounds, 11 assists and three steals in a 130–117 win to lead the Heat to a 1–0 series lead.[124] He moved to second place in 35+ point playoff games in Heat franchise history (10), surpassing LeBron James (9) and trailing only Dwyane Wade (14).[125] In Game 4 of the Heat's playoff series against the Bucks, Butler scored a career-high 56 points on 19-for-28 shooting from the field and 15-of-18 shooting from the free throw line, including a franchise-record 22 points in the first quarter, in a 119–114 win.[126] His 56 points also set a Miami Heat franchise record for the most points scored in a playoff game, surpassing LeBron James' previous record of 49.[127][128][129] In Game 5 of the series against the Bucks, Butler recorded 42 points, eight rebounds, four assists and two steals in a 128–126 overtime win, leading the Heat to the second round of the playoffs. He also became the first player in Heat history to put up back-to-back 40-point playoff games and also put up his eighth 40-point playoff game as a member of the Heat, surpassing Dwyane Wade's previous Heat franchise record of seven 40-point playoff games. In Games 4 and 5, Butler amassed a total of 98 points, becoming one of five players in NBA playoff history to produce that many points in a two-game span. He joined Michael Jordan (who accomplished the feat on three occasions), Jerry West, Elgin Baylor and Rick Barry. Butler finished the series averaging 37.6 points, 6 rebounds, 4.8 assists and 1.8 steals per game.[130][131][132] In Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals, Butler recorded 35 points, five rebounds, seven assists and a playoff career-high six steals in a 123–116 win over the Boston Celtics.[133] The Heat eventually advanced to the NBA Finals after winning the series in seven games. In Game 7 against the Celtics, Butler posted 28 points, seven rebounds, six assists and three steals in the 103–84 win.[134][135] In a narrow vote between him and Caleb Martin, Butler was named Eastern Conference Finals MVP, averaging 24.7 points, 7.6 rebounds, 6.1 assists and 2.6 steals per game.[136] In Game 2 of the NBA Finals, Butler put up 21 points and nine assists in a 111–108 win over the Denver Nuggets. He joined LeBron James and Dwyane Wade as the only players in Heat history to put up at least 500 points, 100 rebounds, and 100 assists in a single postseason run.[137] However, the Heat went on to lose the next 3 games of the series to lose the finals in 5 games.[138] On November 16, 2023, Butler scored 36 points in a 122–115 win over the Brooklyn Nets, to lead the Heat to their first seven-game win streak since January 14, 2018.[139] On December 16, Butler put up 28 points alongside a buzzer-beating, game-winning stepback jumper in a 118–116 win over the Chicago Bulls.[140][141] On February 7, 2024, Butler recorded his 16th career triple-double with 17 points, 11 rebounds, 11 assists and three steals in a 116–104 win over the San Antonio Spurs.[142] On March 2, Butler scored a season-high 37 points on 12-of-19 shooting, 3-of-3 from three and 10-of-11 from the free throw line in a 126–120 win over the Utah Jazz.[143] Butler missed the 2024 NBA playoffs following a medial collateral ligament (MCL) sprain he sustained during a play-in game against the Philadelphia 76ers.[144] On November 24, 2024, Butler scored 33 points along with nine rebounds and six assists in a 123–118 overtime win over the Dallas Mavericks.[145] On December 16, he had 35 points, 19 rebounds and 10 assists in a 125–124 loss to the Detroit Pistons, becoming the third player in NBA history to finish with at least 35 points, 19 rebounds, 10 assists and four steals in a game, joining DeMarcus Cousins in 2018 and George McGinnis in 1976.[146] On January 3, 2025, the Heat suspended Butler for seven games, citing multiple instances of conduct detrimental to the team throughout the season. The suspension followed reports of Butler's growing discontent and his statement the previous day that he no longer believed he could be happy playing in Miami.[147] In an official statement, the Heat confirmed that Butler and his representative had requested a trade and announced their intention to consider offers.[148] While attending Marquette, Butler earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in communications.[149][150] Butler is a fan of country and emo music. He starred in the music video of the country song \"Light It Up\" by Luke Bryan[151] and the emo song \"So Much (for) Stardust\" by Fall Out Boy.[152] He is good friends with Mark Wahlberg, whom he met while Wahlberg was filming Transformers: Age of Extinction in Chicago. The two have vacationed in Paris together.[153] Butler became a fan of soccer during the 2016 Summer Olympics, after watching Neymar Jr. play for Brazil. He cites Paris Saint Germain as his favorite team and Neymar as his favorite player.[154] [155] Butler and his girlfriend have two children.[156] He did not make his Heat debut until the fourth game of the 2019–20 NBA season, as he was on paternity leave after the birth of his first child.[157] In the NBA Bubble, Butler opened Big Face Coffee, a side business which he operated out of his hotel room using his French press coffee brewer, charging $20 per cup.[158] A year later, he officially launched his coffee brand, and planned to dedicate his time into the coffee roastery business post-retirement.[159] During the 2023 NBA playoffs, Butler filed a trademark on the name \"Himmy Butler\" for the purpose of launching his own clothing and beverage brand. The nickname \"Himmy\" came from the meme phrase \"he's him\", which rose in popularity during the Heat's Butler-led run during that postseason.[160][161] Butler is a Christian.[162] Butler is featured in the Netflix documentary series, \"Starting 5\", which followed Butler, Anthony Edwards, LeBron James, Domantas Sabonis, and Jayson Tatum through the 2023–24 NBA season and playoffs.[163] Butler's father died on February 8, 2024.[164]",

                "content": "Editions: En/basketball/nba/miami-heat Butler has not played a full game for the Heat since Dec. 16 vs the Detroit Pistons With over two months of the NBA season under our belts, the Christmas games behind us, and teams having played 30-33 games each, we're closer to the midpoint of the season than the beginning. The February 6 trade deadline is fast approaching, and teams like the Lakers have already made moves to bolster their strong start rather than wait for the team to falter. As is the case every year, there are plenty of trade rumors involving All-Stars who are either \"seeking\" a trade or being \"pursued\" by multiple teams. Notable names this year include De'Aaron Fox, following the departure of coach Mike Brown, and Jimmy Butler, whose agent and also Heat president Pat Riley have already denied the swirling rumors. Butler's contract with the Heat expires next season, which would mark seven seasons in Miami - one more than he spent with the Chicago Bulls, the team that drafted him. While he hasn't won a championship like LeBron James or Dwyane Wade, Butler is undeniably a Heat legend. His two Finals appearances and consistent playoff performances solidify his place among the franchise's greats. In his six seasons with Miami, Butler has never missed the playoffs and typically elevates his game in the most critical moments of the season and games. This makes the trade rumors surprising, but for the first time, Butler addressed them publicly during a press conference. True to his personality, he opened with, \"That's a good question. Who knows? I don't. But right now I'm here.\" He also shared that he's motivated by hearing such rumors and appreciates the attention he's getting. Butler hasn't played since December 20, when he left a Heat loss to the Thunder early due to injury. He's expected to return tomorrow against the Pelicans with the goal of starting 2025 healthy and back on the court. Unless a team offers a compelling trade package, it's unlikely that Butler will be moved this offseason. At 35, he remains a top-25 NBA player and team leader, though injuries have been his biggest challenge in recent years. The Heat currently have a 16-14 record, good for seventh place in the Eastern Conference. Tyler Herro is playing the best basketball of his career alongside the always reliable Bam Adebayo. Both are still young, which means if the Heat pursue a trade, Butler would likely be the one sacrificed. Through 20 games this season, Butler is averaging 18.5 points per game, his lowest mark since 2018. Injuries have also limited him to 31 minutes per game, his fewest since 2012. Time and injuries spare no one, but if Butler can stay healthy for the playoffs (still a long way off), the Heat could be a formidable opponent for any team. After all, the Heat culture is a real thing. © Unidad Editorial Información Deportiva, S.L.U. All rights reserved. Follow us",

                "content": "The Los Angeles Lakers are an American professional basketball team based in Los Angeles. The Lakers compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Pacific Division of the Western Conference. The Lakers play their home games at Crypto.com Arena, an arena they share with the Los Angeles Sparks of the Women's National Basketball Association and the Los Angeles Kings of the National Hockey League.[10] The Lakers are one of the most successful teams in the history of the NBA with 17 championships, the second most in the league behind the Boston Celtics.[11] The franchise began in 1946 as the Detroit Gems of the National Basketball League (NBL).[12] After one season, a new ownership relocated the team to Minneapolis, Minnesota,[13][12] and renamed the team as the Minneapolis Lakers.[14] The Lakers won the 1948 NBL championship before joining the rival Basketball Association of America, where they won the 1949 BAA championship. Following the merger of the NBL and the BAA into the NBA in 1949, the Lakers won four of the next five NBA championships.[15] After struggling financially in the late 1950s, they relocated to Los Angeles before the 1960–61 season. The Lakers made the NBA Finals six times in the 1960s, but lost every series to the Celtics, beginning their long and storied rivalry. In 1968, the Lakers acquired four-time NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) Wilt Chamberlain, and won their sixth NBA title in 1972, led by coach Bill Sharman. After the retirement of Chamberlain, the team traded for superstar Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Two big changes came in 1979, first, Jerry Buss purchased the Lakers, and pioneered a vision of basketball as entertainment as well as sport.[16] Second, the Lakers drafted Magic Johnson first overall in the 1979 NBA draft. The combination of Johnson, a prodigy point guard, and dominant center in Abdul-Jabbar provided the Lakers with superstars to anchor their roster. The promotion of head coach Pat Riley in 1981 and addition of forward James Worthy through the 1982 draft established the Lakers as an NBA powerhouse throughout the 1980s. The franchise won five championships in a nine-year span, including two out of three marquee Finals matchups against the Celtics. The Lakers were defeated by their Boston archrivals in the 1984 Finals, but triumphed over them in 1985 and 1987. After Riley departed and Abdul-Jabbar, Johnson, and Worthy retired, the Lakers struggled in the early 1990s. It was not until 1996 when the team traded with the Charlotte Hornets for the draft rights to Kobe Bryant and signed center Shaquille O'Neal that the Lakers returned to dominance during the early 2000s. The superstar duo, along with Hall of Fame coach Phil Jackson, led the Lakers to three consecutive championships between 2000 and 2002, securing the franchise's second \"three-peat\".[17] The dynamic \"Shaq-and-Kobe\" era ended when the Lakers traded away O'Neal after the team lost to the Detroit Pistons in the 2004 Finals. It was not until the Lakers traded for Pau Gasol that Bryant and Jackson returned to the NBA Finals, losing to the Celtics in 2008 but winning championships in 2009 and 2010. The 2010 Finals marked the latest matchup of the Lakers and Celtics, with Los Angeles winning its 16th title. Jackson retired in 2011, and the Lakers endured their longest playoff drought in franchise history. Gasol departed in 2014, and Bryant retired in 2016. After rebuilding seasons with young, highly rated prospects, the Lakers signed superstar LeBron James in 2018.[18] In 2019, the team traded several of those prospects for star big man Anthony Davis.[19] The Lakers—led by James, Davis, and coach Frank Vogel—won the team's 17th championship in 2020, tying the Celtics for the most titles until 2024.[20] The Lakers hold the record for NBA's longest winning streak, 33 straight games, set in 1971–72.[21] 26 Hall of Famers have played for Los Angeles, while four have coached the team. Abdul-Jabbar, Johnson, O'Neal, and Bryant won a combined eight NBA MVP awards with the Lakers.[22] The franchise was founded in 1946 as the Detroit Gems and played in the National Basketball League (NBL) during the 1946–47 season where it finished last in the league with only 4 wins in 44 games. Though the team was scheduled to continue in the NBL the following season,[23] its ownership, faced with high losses due to low attendance and lack of homecourt, decided on selling the team to Ben Berger and Morris Chalfen of Minnesota for $15,000[13][24] Minneapolis sportswriter Sid Hartman played a key behind-the-scenes role in helping put together the deal and later the team.[25] Inspired by Minnesota's nickname, \"Land of 10,000 Lakes\", the team rechristened themselves the Lakers.[26][27] Hartman helped them hire John Kundla from College of St. Thomas, to be their first head coach, by meeting with him and selling him on the team.[28][29] As the franchise had the worst record in the NBL the previous season, it got the first pick in the 1947 Professional Basketball League of America dispersal draft, which they used to select George Mikan. Led by Mikan, the Lakers had a solid roster, which also featured forward Jim Pollard and playmaker Herm Schaefer.[30] In their first season, they led the league with a 43–17 record, later winning the NBL championship that season.[31] In 1948, the Lakers moved from the NBL to the Basketball Association of America (BAA), and Mikan's 28.3 point per game (ppg) scoring average set a BAA record. In the 1949 BAA Finals they won the championship, beating the Washington Capitols four games to two.[32] Following the season, the BAA and the NBL merged to form the National Basketball Association (NBA).[33] In the newly formed league, the Lakers improved to 51–17 record and won their third straight professional championship.[34] In the 1950–51 season, Mikan won his third straight scoring title at 28.4 ppg and the Lakers went 44–24 to win their second straight division title.[35] One of those games, a 19–18 loss against the Fort Wayne Pistons, became infamous as the lowest scoring game in NBA history.[36] In the playoffs, they defeated the Indianapolis Olympians in three games but lost to the Rochester Royals in the next round.[30] During the 1951–52 season, the Lakers won 40 games, finishing second in their division.[37] They faced the New York Knicks in the NBA Finals, which they won in seven games.[38] In the 1952–53 season, Mikan led the NBA in rebounding, averaging 14.4 rebounds per game (rpg), and was named MVP of the 1953 NBA All-Star Game.[35] After a 48–22 regular season, the Lakers defeated the Fort Wayne Pistons in the Western playoffs to advance to the NBA Finals.[38] They then defeated the New York Knicks to win their second straight championship.[39] Though Lakers star George Mikan suffered from knee problems throughout the 1953–54 season, he was still able to average 18 ppg.[40] Clyde Lovellette, who was drafted in 1952, helped the team win the Western Division.[40] The team won its third straight championship in the 1950s and sixth in seven seasons when it defeated the Syracuse Nationals in seven games.[39] Following Mikan's retirement in the 1954 off-season, the Lakers struggled but still managed to win 40 games. Although they defeated the Rochester Royals in the first round of the playoffs, they were defeated by the Fort Wayne Pistons in the semifinals.[41] Although they had losing records the next two seasons, they made the playoffs each year.[37] Mikan came back for the last half of the 1955–56 season, but struggled and retired for good after the season.[42] Led by Lovellette's 20.6 points and 13.5 rebounds, they advanced to the Conference Finals in 1956–57. The Lakers had one of the worst seasons in team history in 1957–58 when they won a league-low 19 games.[43] They had hired Mikan, who had been the team's general manager for the previous two seasons, as head coach to replace Kundla. Mikan was fired in January when the team was 9–30, and Kundla was rehired.[37][44] The Lakers earned the top pick in the 1958 NBA draft and used it to select Elgin Baylor. Baylor, who was named NBA Rookie of the Year and co-MVP of the 1959 NBA All-Star Game, averaged 24.9 ppg and 15.0 rpg helping the Lakers improve to second in their division despite a 33–39 record.[45] After upsetting the Hawks in six games in the division finals, they returned to the NBA Finals, but were swept by the Celtics, beginning their long rivalry.[46] In their last year in Minneapolis, the Lakers went 25–50. On January 18, 1960, the team was coming off a loss and traveling to St. Louis when their plane crash-landed.[49] Snow storms had driven the pilot 150 miles off course when he was forced to land in a cornfield. No one was hurt.[50] Their record earned them the number two pick in the 1960 NBA draft. The team selected Jerry West from West Virginia University.[51] During the 1960 off-season, the Lakers became the NBA's first West Coast team when owner Bob Short decided to move the team to Los Angeles.[52] Led by Baylor's 34.8 ppg and 19.8 rpg, Los Angeles won 11 more than the year before in West's first season.[53] On November 15 that season, Baylor set a new NBA scoring record when he scored 71 points in a victory against the New York Knicks while grabbing 25 rebounds.[54] In doing so, Baylor broke his own NBA record of 64 points. Despite a losing record, the Lakers made the playoffs.[37] They came within two points of the NBA Finals when they lost in game seven of their second round series against St. Louis.[55] Led by Baylor and West at 38.3 and 30.8 ppg respectively,[56] the Lakers improved to 54–26 in 1961–62, and made the finals. In a game five victory, Baylor grabbed 22 rebounds and set the still-standing NBA record for points in a finals game with 61,[57] despite fouling out of the game.[58] The Lakers, however, lost to the Celtics by three points in overtime of game seven.[56] Frank Selvy, after making two jumpers in the final 40 seconds to tie the game,[59][60] missed a potential game-winning 18 foot jump shot in regulation, a miss which he said in June 2010 still haunted him more than 40 years later.[60] Los Angeles won 53 games in 1962–63, behind Baylor's 34.0 ppg and West's 27.1 ppg[61] but lost in the NBA Finals in six games to the Celtics.[61] After falling to 42–38 and losing in the first round of the 1964 NBA playoffs to the Hawks, the team won 49 games in 1964–65. The Lakers surged past the Baltimore Bullets in the division finals, behind West's record-setting 46.3 ppg in the series.[62] They lost again to the Celtics in the Finals however, this time in five games.[63] Los Angeles lost in the finals to Boston in seven games again in 1966, this time by two points.[64] Down by 16 entering the fourth quarter, and 10 with a minute and a half to go, the Lakers mounted a furious rally in the closing moments, which fell just short.[65] After dropping to 36 wins and losing in the first round of the 1967 NBA playoffs, they lost in the finals to the Celtics again in 1968.[37] Los Angeles moved to a brand-new arena, The Forum, in 1967, after playing seven seasons at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena. On July 9, 1968, the team acquired Wilt Chamberlain from the Philadelphia 76ers for Darrell Imhoff, Archie Clark, and Jerry Chambers.[67] In his first season as a Laker, Chamberlain set a team record by averaging a league-leading 21.1 rpg.[68] West, Baylor, and Chamberlain each averaged over 20 points, and Los Angeles won their division.[69] The Lakers and Celtics again met in the finals, and Los Angeles had home court advantage against Boston for the first time in their rivalry. They won the first game behind Jerry West's 53 points,[70] and had a 3–2 lead after five.[71] Boston won the series in seven games however,[72] and earned their 11th NBA Championship in 13 seasons.[73] West was named the first-ever Finals MVP; this remains the only time that a member of the losing team has won the award.[74] In 1970, West won his first scoring title at 31.2 ppg, the team returned to the finals, and for the first time in 16 years, they did not have to face the Celtics; instead playing the New York Knicks, who defeated them 4–3.[75][76] The next season the Lakers were defeated by the Milwaukee Bucks, led by future Laker Lew Alcindor (now known as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar) in the Western Conference Finals.[77] The 1971–72 season brought several changes. Owner Jack Kent Cooke brought in Bill Sharman as head coach,[78] and Elgin Baylor announced his retirement early in the season after realizing that his legs were not healthy enough.[78] Sharman increased the team's discipline.[79] He introduced the concept of the shootaround, where players would arrive at the arena early in the morning before a game to practice shots.[80] They won 14 straight games in November and all 16 games played in December.[78] They won three straight to open the year of 1972 but on January 9, the Milwaukee Bucks ended their winning streak by defeating the Lakers, 120–104.[81] By winning 33 straight games, Los Angeles set a record for longest winning streak of any team in major American professional team sports.[82][83] The Lakers won 69 games that season, which stood as the NBA record for 24 years until the Chicago Bulls won 72 games in 1995–96.[84] Chamberlain averaged a low 14.8 points but led the league in rebounding at 19.2 a game.[85] West's 9.7 assists per game (apg) led the league, he also averaged more than 25 points, and was named MVP of the 1972 NBA All-Star Game.[85] The team failed to score 100 points just once all year,[86] and at the end of the season, Bill Sharman was named Coach of the Year.[87] The Lakers went on to reach the finals against the New York Knicks where they would avenge their 1970 finals loss by defeating them 4 games to 1. Chamberlain tallied 24 points and 29 rebounds in game five and won the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award.[88][89] The Lakers won 60 games in the 1972–73 season, and took another Pacific Division title.[90] Wilt Chamberlain, playing in his final season, again led the league in rebounding and set the NBA record for field-goal percentage at 72.7% which stood for several decades.[90] The team defeated the Chicago Bulls in seven games in the conference semifinals, then the Golden State Warriors in five in the Western Division Finals.[90] They played the New York Knicks in the 1973 NBA Finals. Los Angeles took the first game by three points, but New York won the series in five games.[91] During the 1973–74 season, the team was hampered by the loss of West, who played only 31 games before his legs gave out.[92] Goodrich, averaging 25.3 points, helped the team to a late-season surge.[92] Trailing the Golden State Warriors by three games with seven left to play, the Lakers rallied to finish 47–35 and win the Pacific Division.[92] They made the playoffs but managed just one win against Milwaukee in the conference semifinals. Following the season, West retired due to contract disagreements with Cooke, and filed a suit for unpaid back wages.[93] After missing the playoffs in the 1974–75 season, the Lakers acquired Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who had won three league MVPs by that time.[94] Abdul-Jabbar wanted out of Milwaukee, demanding a trade to either New York or Los Angeles.[95] He was traded for Elmore Smith, Brian Winters, Junior Bridgeman, and Dave Meyers. Abdul-Jabbar had his fourth MVP season in 1975–76, leading the league in rebounding, blocked shots, and minutes played.[96] The Lakers struggled in January, going 3–10, and finished out of the playoffs at 40–42.[96] West and Cooke settled their differences—and the former Laker's lawsuit—and Cooke hired him to replace Sharman as the team's coach.[97] West became upset, however, when Cooke refused to spend the money necessary to acquire forward Julius Erving, who the Nets were selling.[98] Behind another MVP season from Abdul-Jabbar, Los Angeles won the Pacific Division, finishing the 1976–77 season a league-best 53–29.[99] They defeated the Warriors in a seven-game series to open the postseason before being swept by Portland in the Western Conference Finals.[96] During the off-season, Los Angeles picked up Jamaal Wilkes from Golden State and signed first-round draft pick Norm Nixon. In the first two minutes of the first game of the 1977–78 season, Abdul-Jabbar punched Bucks center Kent Benson for an overly aggressive elbow and broke his hand.[100] Two months later, a healthy Abdul-Jabbar got into an altercation with Houston Rockets center Kevin Kunnert after a rebound. The team's starting power forward, Kermit Washington, who was averaging 11.5 points and 11.2 rebounds,[101] entered the fight, and when Rudy Tomjanovich ran in from the bench to break up the action, Washington punched him in the face.[102] Tomjanovich nearly died from the punch, suffering a fractured skull and other facial injuries, which prematurely ended his playing career.[103] Washington, who stated that he assumed Tomjanovich was a combatant, was suspended for two months by the NBA, and released by the Lakers.[104] The team won 45 games despite being down a starter in Washington and not having Abdul-Jabbar for nearly two months, but lost in the first round of the playoffs to Seattle.[105] During the 1978–79 season, the team posted a 47–35 record but lost to the SuperSonics in the semifinal round of the playoffs.[96] In the 1979 NBA draft, Los Angeles selected 6-foot, 9-inch point guard Magic Johnson from Michigan State with the first overall pick.[106] It took Johnson's teammates time to acclimate themselves to his passing ability, as his \"no-look\" passes often caught them unaware. Once they adjusted, his passing became a key part of Los Angeles' offense.[107] The Lakers won 60 games in Johnson's rookie year, and defeated the Philadelphia 76ers in six games in the 1980 NBA Finals. Johnson won the Finals MVP award, after starting at center for the injured Abdul-Jabbar in game six, and tallying 42 points, 15 rebounds, and seven assists.[108] The team fell off in the 1980–81 season, though, as the Lakers lost Johnson for most of the season to a knee injury.[109] The team turned in a 54–28 record and finished second behind the Phoenix Suns in the Pacific Division.[109] The Rockets, led by Moses Malone, defeated Los Angeles in the first round of the playoffs.[109] Early in the 1981–82 season, Johnson complained to the media about head coach Paul Westhead and demanded a trade.[110] Westhead was fired shortly after Johnson's criticisms, and although Lakers' owner Jerry Buss stated that Johnson's comments did not factor into the decision, Johnson was vilified by the national media and booed both on the road and at home.[111][112][113] Buss promoted assistant coach Pat Riley to \"co-head coach\" with Jerry West (although West considered himself Riley's assistant) on November 19 and the team won 17 of its next 20 games.[109][114][115] Nicknamed \"Showtime\" due to the team's new Johnson-led fast break-offense, the Lakers won the Pacific Division title and swept both the Suns and Spurs in the 1982 playoffs.[116] Los Angeles stretched its postseason winning streak to nine games by taking the first contest of the NBA Finals from the 76ers.[109][117] The team won the Finals 4–2 to finish a 12–2 playoff run.[109] On draft night in 1982, the Lakers had the first overall pick (the result of a trade with Cleveland midway through the 1979–80 season, when the Lakers had sent Don Ford and a 1980 first-round pick to the Cavaliers for Butch Lee and their 1982 selection) and selected James Worthy from North Carolina.[118] The Lakers won the Pacific Division at 58–24, but Worthy suffered a leg injury in the last week of the season and missed the rest of the season.[119] Nevertheless, they advanced to play Philadelphia in the 1983 NBA Finals after defeating Portland and San Antonio.[119] The Sixers, however, won the series and the championship in four games.[118] After the season West replaced Sharman as the team's GM.[120] In the 1983–84 season, Los Angeles went 54–28, and played Boston in the Finals for the first time since 1969.[121] The Lakers won two of the first three games. However, Kevin McHale's hard clothesline foul of Lakers forward Kurt Rambis on a fast break is credited as a turning point of the series.[122] Boston won three of the next four to win the title and send Los Angeles's record to 0–8 in Finals series against the Celtics.[121] Using the past year's Finals defeat as motivation, the team won the Pacific Division for the fourth straight year and lost just two games in the Western Conference playoffs. In the NBA Finals, the Celtics were again the Lakers' final hurdle. Los Angeles lost game one of the NBA Finals by a score of 148–114, in what is remembered as the \"Memorial Day Massacre\".[123] The Lakers, behind 38-year-old Finals MVP Abdul-Jabbar, recovered to defeat the Celtics in six games.[124] The team won the title in the Boston Garden and became the first visiting team to ever win an NBA championship in Boston, as the Golden State Warriors later achieved this feat in 2022.[123] In the 1985–86 season, the Lakers started 24–3 and went on to win 62 games and their fifth straight division title.[126] The Rockets, however, defeated the Lakers in five games in the Western Conference Finals. Houston won the series when Ralph Sampson hit a 20-foot jumper as time expired in game five at The Forum.[126] Prior to the 1986–87 season, the Lakers moved A.C. Green into the starting lineup, and acquired Mychal Thompson from the Spurs.[127] Johnson won his first career MVP Award while leading the Lakers to a 65–17 record,[127] and Michael Cooper was named NBA Defensive Player of the Year.[127] Before the season, Riley had made the decision to shift the focus of the offense to Johnson over the 40-year-old Abdul-Jabbar.[128] The Lakers advanced to the NBA Finals by sweeping the Nuggets, defeating the Warriors in five games, and sweeping the SuperSonics in the Western Conference Finals.[129] The Lakers defeated Boston in the first two games of the Finals, and the teams split the next four games, giving Los Angeles their second championship in three seasons.[127] The series was highlighted by Johnson's running \"baby hook\" shot to win game four at Boston Garden with two seconds remaining.[130] Johnson was named the NBA Finals MVP, in addition to regular season MVP.[131] At the Lakers' championship celebration in Los Angeles, coach Riley brashly declared that Los Angeles would repeat as NBA champions,[127] which no team had done since the 1968–69 Boston Celtics. Looking to make good on Riley's promise in the 1987–88 season, the Lakers took their seventh consecutive Pacific Division title with a 62–20 record. They swept the Spurs in the first round of the Western Conference Finals before pulling out a tough seven-game series win over the Utah Jazz led by youngsters Karl Malone and John Stockton. A seven-game Western Conference finals win over the Dallas Mavericks propelled the Lakers to the NBA Finals once again. In their seventh trip to the Finals in nine years, they met the Detroit Pistons. Los Angeles would take the series in seven games, and James Worthy's game seven triple-double earned him a Finals MVP award.[132] The win marked their fifth title in nine years, but would also mark their last title until 2000. In the 1988–89 season, Los Angeles won 57 games and their eighth consecutive Pacific Division crown. They swept through the playoffs defeating Portland, Seattle, and Phoenix. In an eighth trip to the NBA Finals in 10 years, they once again faced the Detroit Pistons.[133] Hampered by injuries to Byron Scott and Johnson, the Lakers were swept by Detroit.[134] Following the 1989 Finals, on June 28, 1989, after 20 professional seasons, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar announced his retirement. The Lakers still cruised through the Pacific Division, winning their ninth consecutive division crown with a 63–19 record. However, after beating the Rockets in the first round, they lost four games to one in the second round of the playoffs to the Suns.[135] Riley announced he was stepping down after the season citing burnout,[136] and was replaced by Mike Dunleavy.[137] Riley's departure received a mixed reaction from the players. They respected his contributions, but some, such as Worthy and Scott, had grown tired of his intense practices and felt he tried to take too much credit for the team's successes.[138] Following the season, 1987 Defensive Player of the Year winner Michael Cooper decided to play in Europe and was waived at his request.[139] The 1990–91 Lakers failed to win the Pacific Division for the first time in 10 years, but still finished with a 58–24 record. After cruising through the Western Conference playoffs, the Lakers found themselves in the NBA Finals once again, their ninth trip to the Finals in 12 years. The 1991 Finals represented a changing of the guard as the Lakers were defeated in five games by the Chicago Bulls, led by superstar Michael Jordan.[140] On November 7, 1991, Magic Johnson announced he had tested positive for HIV and would retire immediately.[141] In their first season without Johnson, the team won 43 games to earn the eighth seed in the Western Conference playoffs.[37] The Lakers were defeated in the first round by Portland. Following the season, head coach Mike Dunleavy was fired. The Lakers would lose 43 games in 1992–93 under Randy Pfund, their first losing season since 1976. The Lakers would still make the playoffs, and would become the first eighth seed to win the opening two games on the road against a number one seed when they took a 2–0 lead against Phoenix.[142] They lost the next two games at home however, then game five in Phoenix in overtime.[142] During the 1993–94 season, Pfund was fired during the season that would result in the Lakers failing to make the playoffs for the first time since 1976. Magic Johnson, would coach the final 16 games of the season with former teammate Michael Cooper as his lead assistant.[143] Johnson decided not to take the job permanently due to what he felt was a lack of commitment from certain players, and Los Angeles ended the season with a 10-game losing streak to finish 33–49.[144][145] Under new coach Del Harris, Los Angeles made the playoffs each of the next two seasons but was eliminated in the second and first rounds respectively.[146][147] The team was led by young guards Nick Van Exel and Eddie Jones.[148] Johnson came out of retirement to return as a player in the 1995–96 season to lead the then 24–18 Lakers to a 29–11 finish.[149] After some run-ins with Van Exel, displeasure with Harris's strategies, and a first-round loss to the Rockets, Johnson decided to retire for the final time after the season.[150] During the 1996 off-season, the Lakers acquired 17-year-old Kobe Bryant from the Charlotte Hornets for Vlade Divac; Bryant was drafted 13th overall out of Lower Merion High School in Ardmore, Pennsylvania in that year's draft, by Charlotte. Los Angeles also signed free-agent Shaquille O'Neal.[151] Trading for Bryant was West's idea, and he was influential in the team's signing of the all-star center.[152] \"Jerry West is the reason I came to the Lakers\", O'Neal later said.[153] They used their 24th pick in the draft to select Derek Fisher.[154] During the season, the team traded Cedric Ceballos to Phoenix for Robert Horry.[155] O'Neal led the team to a 56–26 record, their best effort since 1990–91, despite missing 31 games due to a knee injury.[156] O'Neal averaged 26.2 ppg and 12.5 rpg and finished third in the league in blocked shots (2.88 bpg) in 51 games.[156][157] The Lakers defeated the Portland Trail Blazers in the first round of the playoffs as O'Neal scored 46 points in Game 1 against the Trail Blazers, marking the highest single-game playoff scoring output by a Laker since Jerry West scored 53 against the Celtics in 1969.[156] In the next round, the Lakers lost in five games to the Utah Jazz.[156] In the 1997–98 season, O'Neal and the Lakers had the best start in franchise history, 11–0.[158] O'Neal would miss 20 games on the season due to an abdominal injury.[158] Los Angeles battled Seattle for the Pacific Division title most of the season. In the final two months, the Lakers won 22 of their final 25 games,[158] finishing 61–21, but still finished second to Seattle in the standings.[158] The Lakers defeated Portland three games to one in the first round to advance to face Seattle. Although the Sonics won the first game, the Lakers responded with four straight wins, taking the series,[158] but were swept by the Jazz in the Western Conference Finals.[158] During the 1998–99 season, All-Star guard Eddie Jones and center Elden Campbell were traded to the Charlotte Hornets.[159] The team also acquired J. R. Reid, B. J. Armstrong, and Glen Rice.[160] Head coach Del Harris was fired in February after a three-game losing streak and replaced on an interim basis by former Laker Kurt Rambis.[161] The team finished 31–19 in the strike-shortened season, which was fourth in the Western Conference.[162] The Lakers defeated Houston in the first round of the playoffs, but were swept by San Antonio in the next round. Game four of the series would be the last game ever played at the Great Western Forum.[163] Before the 1999–2000 season, West was prepared to hire Rambis as the team's full-time coach before an outcry from fans and members of the organization caused him to seek out a bigger name.[164] Los Angeles hired former Chicago Bulls coach Phil Jackson, who had coached that team to six championships, and gave him a lucrative $6 million a year contract.[165] He brought along assistant Tex Winter and they installed Winter's version of the triangle offense.[166] The Lakers signed veterans Brian Shaw, John Salley, Ron Harper, and A.C. Green, who was a Laker during the \"Showtime\" era.[155] The team also moved to a new arena, the Staples Center.[167] Led by league MVP O'Neal, the Lakers won 31 of their first 36 games.[168] They finished 67–15, the highest win total since they won 65 in the 1986–87 season.[168] Then eliminated Sacramento and Phoenix in the first two rounds of the playoffs.[169] After the Lakers took a three games to one lead in the Western Conference Finals against Portland, the Trail Blazers won the next two games to force a game seven.[170] The Lakers, who trailed by 15 points in the fourth quarter, would go on 19–4 run to tie the game and eventually win 89–84 to advance to the NBA Finals.[170] In their first trip to the Finals since 1991, the Lakers defeated Reggie Miller and the Indiana Pacers four games to two win their first title since 1988.[171] West retired from his spot in the team's front office after the season after a power struggle between him and Jackson over control of the team's operations.[172] After the season, starters Rice and Green left the team,[173] and Los Angeles signed Horace Grant.[174] The following season, the Lakers won 11 fewer regular season games than the prior year,[175] but swept the first three rounds of the playoffs, defeating the Portland, Sacramento, and San Antonio.[176] They met Allen Iverson and the Philadelphia 76ers in the NBA Finals. Although the Sixers took game one in overtime,[177] the Lakers won the next four games to win their second straight title. Their 15–1 postseason record was the best in NBA history.[178] The Lakers won 58 games in 2001–02. In the playoffs, they swept Portland and defeated San Antonio four games to one to advance to the Western Conference Finals to face Sacramento.[181] The series would go on to be known as one of the greatest playoff matchups in NBA history. The series extended to all seven games and ended in a Lakers victory.[182] In game one, Bryant scored 30 points as the Lakers won, 106–99. The series would then shift in Sacramento's favor, with the Kings winning the next two games. Facing a deficit in game 4, the Lakers had the ball with under 20 seconds to play. After misses by both Bryant and O'Neal, Kings center Vlade Divac tapped the ball away from the rim in an attempt to wind down the clock. It went straight into Robert Horry's hands, who drained a game-winning three with under three seconds to play. After the Kings won game five on a buzzer-beater by Mike Bibby, the Lakers were faced with a must-win game six. In one of the most controversial playoff games in league history (Tim Donaghy's betting scandal), the Lakers would win by four points.[183] The Lakers went on to win game seven in overtime, with the Kings missing numerous potentially game-saving shots and free throws. The Lakers then achieved a three-peat by sweeping Jason Kidd and the New Jersey Nets in the NBA Finals.[184] O'Neal won each of the Finals series' MVP awards, making him the only player besides Michael Jordan to win three consecutive Finals MVPs.[185] The Lakers would attempt a four-peat the following year, but started the 2002–03 season 11–19.[186] However, they finished the season 39–13 to finish 50–32.[187] They defeated Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs, but the four-peat attempt ended as they were eliminated by San Antonio in six games in the second round.[188] During the 2003–04 season, the team was the subject of intense media coverage generated by the teaming of four stars and the sexual-assault case involving Kobe Bryant.[189][190] Before the season, the Lakers signed two-time MVP Karl Malone formerly of the Jazz, and former Seattle Defensive Player of the Year Gary Payton to join O'Neal and Bryant,[191] forming the first \"superteam\" of the 21st century.[192][193] Three of the \"big four\", however, struggled with injuries: O'Neal suffered from a strained calf, Malone an injured knee, and Bryant an injured shoulder.[194][195] The Lakers started 18–3 and finished 56–26 and won the Pacific Division title, entering the playoffs as the No. 2 seed. They defeated Houston, San Antonio, and Minnesota to advance to the NBA Finals.[196] In the Finals, they would lose to Detroit in five games. During the 2004 off-season, the team entered a rebuilding phase when O'Neal was traded to the Miami Heat for Lamar Odom, Brian Grant, Caron Butler, and a first-round draft pick.[197] Bryant and O'Neal had clashed in the past,[198] and the media credited their feud as one of the motivating factors for the trade.[199] Jackson did not return as head coach, and wrote a book about the team's 2003–04 season, in which he heavily criticized Bryant and called him \"uncoachable\".[200][201][202] The Lakers front office said that the book contained \"several inaccuracies\".[203] The Lakers also traded Rick Fox and Gary Payton to Boston, for Chris Mihm, Marcus Banks, and Chucky Atkins before the 2004–05 season.[204] Derek Fisher, frustrated with losing playing time, opted out of his contract and signed with the Warriors.[204] The team hired Rudy Tomjanovich to replace Jackson.[204] After sitting out the first half of the 2004–05 season, Malone announced his retirement on February 13, 2005.[205] Tomjanovich coached the team to a 22–19 record before resigning due to health problems.[206] Assistant Frank Hamblen was named interim head coach to replace Tomjanovich for the remainder of the season.[207] Bryant (ankle) and Odom (shoulder) suffered injuries, and the Lakers finished 34–48, missing the playoffs for only the fifth time in franchise history and the first time since 1994.[37] With the tenth overall pick in the 2005 NBA draft, the Lakers selected Andrew Bynum, a center from St. Joseph High School in Metuchen, New Jersey.[208] The team also traded Caron Butler and Chucky Atkins to Washington for Kwame Brown and Laron Profit.[209] Jackson returned to coach the team after Rudy Tomjanovich resigned midway through the previous season.[210] On January 22, 2006, Bryant scored 81 points against Toronto, the second-highest total in NBA history.[211] Ending the season 45–37, the team made the playoffs after a one-season absence.[212] After taking a three games to one lead in the first round, Phoenix came back to take the series in seven games.[213] In the following season, the Lakers won 26 of their first 39 games,[214] but lost 27 of their last 43—including seven in a row at one point—to finish 42–40.[214] They were eliminated in the first round by Phoenix again.[214] Frustrated by the team's inability to advance in the playoffs, Bryant demanded to be traded in the off-season.[215] Buss initially agreed to seek a trade,[216] but also worked to try to change Bryant's mind.[217] After re-acquiring Derek Fisher, the Lakers started the 2007–08 season with a 25–11 record, before Andrew Bynum, their center who was leading the league in field-goal percentage, went out for the year due to a knee injury in mid-January.[218] In what would become a crucial transfer for the franchise's return to championship form, they acquired the six-time all-star power forward Pau Gasol from the Memphis Grizzlies in a trade in early February and went 22–5 to finish the season.[219] The Lakers' 57–25 record earned them the first seed in the Western Conference.[220] Bryant was awarded the league's MVP award, becoming the first Laker to win the award since O'Neal in 2000.[221][222] In the playoffs, they defeated the Nuggets in four games, the Jazz in six, and the defending champion Spurs in five, but lost to the Celtics in six games in the NBA Finals.[223] In the 2008–09 season, the Lakers finished 65–17; the best record in the Western Conference.[224] They defeated the Jazz in five games, the Rockets in seven and the Nuggets in six, to win the Western Conference title. They then won their 15th NBA championship by defeating the Orlando Magic in five games in the NBA finals.[225] Bryant was named the NBA Finals MVP for the first time in his career.[226] The Lakers, who had added Ron Artest (Metta World Peace)[227] in place of Trevor Ariza in their starting lineup, finished the 2009–10 season with the best record in the Western Conference for the third straight time. On January 13, 2010, the Lakers became the first team in NBA history to win 3,000 regular-season games by defeating the Dallas Mavericks 100–95.[228] They defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder, the Utah Jazz, and the Phoenix Suns in the Western Conference playoffs. In the finals, the Lakers played the Boston Celtics for the 12th time. They rallied back from a 3–2 disadvantage in the series and erased a 13-point deficit in the fourth quarter of the seventh game to defeat the Celtics. This series win gave them their 16th NBA title overall and 11th since they moved to Los Angeles.[229] Bryant was named Finals MVP for the second year in a row, despite a 6–24 shooting performance in game seven.[230] After much speculation, head coach Phil Jackson returned for the 2010–11 season.[231] In the playoffs, the Lakers defeated the New Orleans Hornets in the first round.[232] But their opportunity for a three-peat was denied by the Dallas Mavericks in a four-game sweep of the second round. After the season, it was announced that Jackson will not be returning to coach the Lakers.[233] After Jackson's retirement, former Cleveland Cavaliers head coach Mike Brown was hired as head coach on May 25, 2011.[234] Before the start of the shortened 2011–12 season, the Lakers traded Lamar Odom to the Dallas Mavericks after Odom requested to be traded.[235] On the trade deadline long time Laker Derek Fisher along with a first round draft pick were traded to the Houston Rockets for Jordan Hill.[236] With a 41–25 regular season record the Lakers entered the playoffs as the third seed, the team defeated the Denver Nuggets in the first round in seven games but were eliminated by the Oklahoma City Thunder in the second round in five games.[237][238] On July 4, 2012, Steve Nash of the Phoenix Suns agreed to a sign-and-trade deal that would send him to the Lakers in exchange for the Lakers' 2013 and 2015 first round draft picks, 2013 and 2014 second round draft picks, and $3 million. The trade was made official on July 11, 2012, the first day the trade moratorium was lifted.[239] On August 10, 2012, in a four-team trade the Lakers traded Andrew Bynum and acquired Dwight Howard.[240] The combination of these players with Bryant and Gasol led media outlets to refer to them as a \"superteam\" comparable to the 2003-04 Lakers.[241][242] On November 9, 2012, Mike Brown was relieved of coaching duties after a 1–4 start to the 2012–13 season.[243] Assistant Coach Bernie Bickerstaff took over as interim head coach, leading the Lakers to a 5–5 record. On November 12, 2012, the Lakers hired Mike D'Antoni as head coach.[244] On February 18, 2013, Lakers owner Jerry Buss died from cancer at age 80.[245] On the court, D'Antoni coached the Lakers to a 40–32 record the rest of the way to finish 45–37, their worst record since 2007. The Lakers clinched a playoff berth on the final game of the season and finished seventh in the Western Conference after beating the Houston Rockets on April 16, 2013.[246][247] The Lakers battled injuries all season, the most prominent of which is the Achilles tendon rupture to Kobe Bryant that ended his season after 78 games. The absence of Bryant was sorely felt as the Lakers were swept by the San Antonio Spurs in the first round of the 2013 NBA playoffs.[248] Nevertheless, Bryant passed Lakers legend Wilt Chamberlain to become the fourth all-time leading scorer in NBA history on March 30, 2013, against the Sacramento Kings.[249] On December 8, 2013, Bryant played in his first game since tearing his Achilles tendon on April 12, 2013.[250] However, on December 17, 2013, he suffered a broken bone in his knee, and did not return for the remainder of the season.[251][252] On March 25, 2014, the Lakers scored 51 points in the third quarter against the New York Knicks, the most points scored in a quarter in the history of the franchise.[253] The Lakers went on to miss the NBA playoffs for the first time since 2005, for just the second time in the last two decades and for just the sixth time in franchise history. On April 30, 2014, Mike D'Antoni resigned from his position as head coach after a 27–55 season.[254] After spending the majority of the off-season without a head coach, the Lakers named former player Byron Scott as the new head coach.[255] After the season, he was the frontrunner to become the new Lakers head coach. Scott interviewed three times for the position, which had become vacant after Mike D'Antoni's resignation.[256] On July 28, 2014, he signed a multi-year contract to coach the Lakers.[257] During the first game of the 2014–15 season, the seventh overall pick in the 2014 NBA draft, Julius Randle went down with a broken leg, which ended his rookie season. The Lakers began their season losing 10 of their first 16 games. After playing only 35 games, Kobe Bryant tore a rotator cuff in his shoulder ending his season. Nick Young was also forced to end his season with a fractured kneecap, leaving the team with a record of 14–41.[258] With 27 games left in the regular season, Byron Scott gave rookie Jordan Clarkson more playing time. Clarkson, the 46th overall pick in the 2014 draft, finished his rookie season with game stats of 11.9 ppg, 3.2 rpg, 3.5 apg, and shooting 44.8% from the field.[259] The Lakers' season ended with a record of 21–61, the fourth worst record in the league and at the time the worst record in franchise history. The next season, the Lakers had the second overall pick of the 2015 NBA draft, which they used to select Ohio State freshman point guard D'Angelo Russell. The team also selected Larry Nance Jr. with the 27th overall pick.[260] On November 30, 2015, Bryant announced he would retire at the end of the season after 20 seasons with the team.[261] In Bryant's last season the team missed the playoffs for the third straight year with a 17–65 record, the worst in franchise history.[262] On April 24, 2016, the Lakers announced that they would not exercise their option on Byron Scott's contract for the following season.[263] On April 29, the team announced another former Laker, Luke Walton, as their new head coach. At the time of his hiring, Walton was an assistant coach for the Golden State Warriors, who were in the playoffs, so he could not officially begin his duties as head coach until the Warriors' playoff run was over.[264] The Lakers earned the second overall pick in the 2016 NBA draft,[265] and selected Brandon Ingram from Duke University.[266] The team also selected Ivica Zubac with the 32nd overall pick.[267] On February 21, 2017, the Lakers fired general manager Mitch Kupchak, while Magic Johnson was named as the president of basketball operations. The team's governor Jeanie Buss, also announced the removal of her brother, Jim Buss, from his position as executive vice president of basketball operations.[268][269] On March 7, 2017, the Lakers hired Rob Pelinka as the general manager, signing him to a five-year deal.[270] The Lakers again earned the second overall pick, this time, in the 2017 NBA draft,[271] and selected Lonzo Ball from UCLA.[272] The Lakers also acquired Kyle Kuzma from the University of Utah with the 27th overall pick from a draft-day trade, along with Brook Lopez in exchange for D'Angelo Russell and Timofey Mozgov.[273] The Lakers also traded their 28th overall pick, Tony Bradley, in exchange for the 30th overall pick, Josh Hart, from Villanova University and the 42nd overall pick, Thomas Bryant, from Indiana University.[274] In February 2018, Nance Jr. and Clarkson were traded away to the Cleveland Cavaliers in exchange for Isaiah Thomas, Channing Frye, and a 2018 first-round draft pick.[275] On July 2, 2018, Randle was renounced by the Lakers.[276] On July 9, 2018, the Lakers signed LeBron James to a four-year, $154 million contract.[277][278] By the Christmas Day game, the Lakers were six games over .500 before James sustained a groin injury leading to several weeks of missed games. Ball and Ingram also ended their seasons early due to injuries. On February 7, 2019, Zubac was traded to the Los Angeles Clippers along with Michael Beasley in exchange for Mike Muscala.[279] On April 9, 2019, Johnson stepped down as the team's president of basketball operations,[280] and two days later, the Lakers parted ways with head coach Walton after the team failed to reach the playoffs for the sixth straight year.[281] On May 13, Frank Vogel was named the Lakers' head coach.[282] The Lakers received the fourth overall pick in the 2019 NBA draft lottery.[283] On July 6, the Lakers acquired Anthony Davis from the New Orleans Pelicans for Ball, Ingram, Hart, and three first-round picks, including the number four overall in the 2019 draft.[284] This trade officially ended the young core era of the Lakers; only Kuzma remained out of the group of players. Following the suspension of the 2019–20 NBA season, the Lakers were one of the 22 teams invited to the NBA Bubble to participate in the final eight games of the regular season.[285] The Lakers finished the regular season with a 52–19 record, entering the playoffs for the first time since 2013,[286] and as the top seed for the first time since 2010.[287] They advanced to the NBA Finals for the first time since 2010.[288] They defeated the Miami Heat 4–2 to win the 2020 NBA Finals,[289] and James was named the Finals MVP for the fourth time in his career.[290] The win gave Los Angeles their 17th championship in franchise history, tying the Boston Celtics for the most all-time.[291] Primary Lakers owner Jeanie Buss, who took over the team in 2017, would also become the first female controlling owner of an NBA team to win the NBA Finals.[292] During the 2021 off-season, the Lakers picked up many NBA veterans, the most notable of which was Russell Westbrook, who was acquired in a blockbuster trade with the Washington Wizards. Kyle Kuzma, the last player left from the Lakers' young core era, was traded away, along with others. Other veterans picked up during the off-season included Carmelo Anthony, DeAndre Jordan, and returning players Wayne Ellington, Trevor Ariza, Dwight Howard and Rajon Rondo.[293] Alex Caruso left the Lakers and signed with the Chicago Bulls, and veteran locker-room voice Jared Dudley retired.[294][295] The Lakers made a surprising run in the 2023 Playoffs, making the Western Conference Finals, but were defeated by the eventual champion Denver Nuggets. On December 9, 2023, the Lakers won the inaugural NBA In-Season Tournament after defeating the Indiana Pacers in the championship game. James was named the inaugural tournament MVP.[296] They finished the 2023–24 season 47–35 and beat the New Orleans Pelicans in the Play-In to make the playoffs as the seventh seed. On June 27, 2024, the Lakers selected Bronny James, the son of LeBron, at 55th overall in the 2024 NBA draft, forming the first father-son duo in NBA history.[297] JJ Redick was hired as head coach of the Lakers.[298] On October 23, 2024, the team made NBA history as being the first one to have father and son (LeBron James & Bronny James) play together as they beat Minnesota Timberwolves on their season opening game.[299] The rivalry between the Boston Celtics and the Lakers involves the two most storied basketball franchises in National Basketball Association (NBA) history. It has been called the best rivalry in the NBA.[300] The two teams have met a record 12 times in the NBA Finals, starting with their first Finals meeting in 1959. They would go on to dominate the league in the 1960s and the 1980s, facing each other six times in the 1960s and three times in the 1980s. The rivalry had been less intense since the retirements of Magic Johnson and Larry Bird in the early 1990s, but in 2008 it was renewed as the Celtics and Lakers met in the Finals for the first time since 1987, with the Celtics winning the series 4–2. They faced off once again in the 2010 NBA Finals, which the Lakers won in 7 games. The two teams were tied for the highest number of championships, with 17 titles apiece, until the Celtics surpassed this record in the 2024 NBA Finals; together, the 35 championships account for almost half of the 78 championships in NBA history. The all-time series record for the Lakers vs Celtics is 209–165 with the Celtics being the forerunners. Boston is the only NBA team with an overall winning record against the Lakers.[301] The rivalry between the Lakers and the Detroit Pistons developed in the late 1980s.[302]: 228 Both teams faced each other in back-to-back finals appearances in the 1988 NBA Finals, which the Lakers won in 7 games and the 1989 NBA Finals, which the Pistons won in 4 games. The rivalry reemerged in the early 2000s as both teams squared off against one another in the 2004 NBA Finals, which the Pistons won in five games. The Lakers have a lengthy history with the Golden State Warriors as both franchises relocated to California during the early 1960s. Geography does play a minor role in the rivalry; however there exists more respect between both teams and fans alike, unlike the Dodgers–Giants rivalry of MLB, or the 49ers–Rams rivalry of the NFL in which both teams express fierce animosity against one another.[303][304] The rivalry began to sprout during the 1970s as the two teams would meet six times in the postseason from 1967 to 1991. Both teams fluctuated in success at varying times, however; the Lakers recent rise following the signing of LeBron James contributed heavily to adding a level of competition between both sides as James had previously faced the Warriors in four straight finals as a member of the Cavaliers. Both teams have met seven times in the postseason, combining for 38 division titles since both teams relocated to California in the early 1960s.[305][306] The Lakers lead the all time regular season series 262–173, and the postseason series 25–11.[307][308] The rivalry between the Lakers and the Los Angeles Clippers is unique because they were the only two NBA teams to share an arena, the Crypto.com Arena. It is also one of only two intra-city rivalries in the NBA, the other being the new crosstown rivalry between the New York Knicks and Brooklyn Nets. Los Angeles fans have historically favored the Lakers.[309][310] Some contend that the term rivalry was inaccurate until the Clippers became more successful.[311] The Lakers and the Phoenix Suns rivalry didn't develop until the 2000s where the teams were led by Kobe Bryant and Steve Nash, respectively. The San Antonio Spurs and the Lakers, developed what some would classify as a rivalry in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Since 1999, the teams have met in the NBA Playoffs five times, with the clubs combining to appear in seven consecutive NBA Finals (from 1999 to 2005). Additionally, the teams combined to win five NBA championships from 1999 to 2003; the Spurs won the NBA championship in 1999, 2003, 2005, 2007 and 2014 while the Lakers won the championship in 2000, 2001, 2002, 2009 and 2010. From 1999 to 2004 the clubs' rivalry was often considered the premier rivalry in the NBA,[312] and each time the clubs faced each other in the playoffs the winner advanced to the NBA Finals. In 2008, the teams met again in the Western Conference Finals where the Spurs were handily defeated only to beat the Lakers when they met again in 2013. The Kings and the Lakers have faced each other in the playoffs nine times between 1949 and 2002, and since the Kings moved to Sacramento in 1985, both have been based in California. The 2002 Western Conference Finals was one of the most bitterly contested in NBA history, with many controversial calls in game 6.[313] The Lakers would win the series in game 7. Berger and Chalfen purchased the NBL's disbanded Detroit Gems for $15,000 in 1947, changed their name to the Lakers, and relocated them to Minnesota. Max Winter bought a third of the club in their early years and sold his share to Mikan in 1954. Berger bought Mikan's share in 1956 giving him a controlling (⅔) interest.[314] After Mikan retired, attendance plummeted and the team lost money for several seasons, leading the ownership group to put the team up for sale in 1957.[315] Marty Marion, a retired baseball player and manager, and his business partner Milton Fischman attempted to purchase the team with the intention of moving the club to Kansas City, Missouri.[315][316] Mikan offered to mortgage his home in an attempt to buy the team and keep the club in Minnesota.[317] The Lakers were sold to a group of investors led by Bob Short, however.[314] The team was sold to Short's group with the agreement that it would not be relocated to Kansas City but kept in Minnesota.[318] Short's ownership group consisted of 117 Minnesota businesses and private citizens, who amassed a total of $200,000 for the purchase; $150,000 to buy the team and $50,000 to run it.[314] By 1958 Short had become 80% owner of the team by buying out his partners,[314] but the team was floundering. Attendance remained poor, and the NBA had put the Lakers on \"financial probation\", notifying them that if they did not meet certain ticket sales numbers they could be bought out by the league and relocated. Short was forced to move the team to Los Angeles in 1960; the club had lost $60,000 in the first half of the 1959–60 season alone.[319] The NBA's owners originally voted 7–1 against the move.[320] When Short indicated that he might take the team to a new rival league that was developing, however, the owners held another vote that same day and allowed the relocation (8–0).[321] Aided by Baylor's drawing power,[322][323] and the new locale, the team's finances improved when they arrived in LA.[324][325] Short sold the team to Washington Redskins owner and publisher Jack Kent Cooke in 1965 for a then league record amount of $5.175 million.[326] Short insisted the deal be conducted in cash as he was wary of Cooke, so guards transported the money in a cart from one New York bank to another.[327] Cooke was a more hands-on owner than Short, and overhauled the team's operations.[328] He personally financed construction of the Forum in 1967 at a cost of $16.5 million.[329][330] He owned the team until 1979 when he sold it, the NHL's Los Angeles Kings, the Forum, and some real estate to Jerry Buss for $67 million.[331] Cooke was forced to sell the team as he was undergoing a costly divorce.[332][333] Buss was a local chemical engineer and former University of Southern California professor who had become wealthy in real estate.[330][334] Philip Anschutz bought a stake in the team in 1998,[335] and until October 2010 Magic Johnson was a minority owner as well.[336] Buss started the trend of allowing sponsors to add their name to team's stadiums when he renamed the Forum the Great Western Forum in 1988.[337] In 2009 major sponsors included Verizon Wireless, Toyota, Anheuser-Busch, American Express, and Carl's Jr., and the team's $113 average ticket price was the highest in the league.[335] In 2013, Buss died at the age of 80 after being hospitalized for 18 months with cancer.[338][339][340] His controlling ownership of the team passed to his six children via a trust, with each child receiving an equal vote.[341][342] Buss' succession plan had daughter Jeanie Buss assume his title as the Lakers' governor as well as its team representative at NBA Board of Governors meetings.[342][343] Given the team's proximity to Hollywood, the Lakers fanbase includes numerous celebrities, many of whom can be seen at the Staples Center during home games.[344] Jack Nicholson, for example, has held season tickets since the 1970s, and directors reportedly need to work their shooting schedules around Lakers home games.[345] From 2002 and 2007 the team averaged just over 18,900 fans, which placed them in the top ten in the NBA in attendance. Red Hot Chili Peppers' song \"Magic Johnson\", from their 1989 album Mother's Milk, is a tribute to the former point guard, and frontman Anthony Kiedis and bassist Michael \"Flea\" Balzary are frequently seen attending home games.[346] In 2008, the team sold out every home game,[347] and in 2010, the Lakers had the most popular team merchandise among all NBA teams, and Bryant the most popular jersey.[348] The Laker nickname came from the state of Minnesota being the Land of 10,000 Lakes.[14][349] The team's colors are purple, gold and white.[350][6][351] The Lakers logo consists of the team name, \"Los Angeles Lakers\" written in purple on top of a gold basketball. The team usually wears white jerseys for Sunday and holiday home games.[350][352] List of the last five seasons completed by the Lakers. For the full season-by-season history, see List of Los Angeles Lakers seasons. The Lakers have won 17 NBA titles and have appeared in the NBA Finals 15 other times.[37] These appearances include eight NBA Finals appearances in the 1980s. The best record posted by the team was 69–13, in 1972; the worst record was 17–65, in 2016.[37] Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, W–L% = Winning percentage Bryant holds most individual team records for longevity including most games played (1,333), and most minutes logged (48,298). Johnson holds all significant assist records for the club including career assists (10,141), assists in a game (24), and highest assist average for a season (13.1). Johnson also has the most triple doubles, with his 138 over 100 more than the next closest player (Bryant; 17). Elmore Smith holds team records for blocks in a game (17), blocks per game for a season (4.85), and career blocks per game (3.93). The scoring records are mostly shared by Elgin Baylor and Bryant, with Baylor having the highest average for a career (27.4) while Bryant has the highest points scored in a single game (81). Baylor, Bryant and West hold the top five single-season scoring averages, with Bryant occupying the first (35.4) and fourth (31.6) spots, while Baylor has the second (34.8), and third (34.0), and West the fifth (31.3).[353][354] The Lakers hold several NBA records as a team including most consecutive games won overall (33) and most consecutive road games won (16), both of which came during the 1971–72 season,[355] highest field-goal percentage for a season at 54.5% (1984–85),[356] and highest road winning percentage at 0.816 (1971–72).[66] They also hold records for having (into the 2009–10 season) the most wins (3,027), the highest winning percentage (61.9%), and the most NBA Finals appearances (31).[37][357] The 2000–01 team set the NBA record for best playoff record at 15–1, which was later broken by the Golden State Warriors in 2017.[358] The 1971–72 team holds franchise records in wins (69), most points scored, and largest margin of victory; both of the latter came in the team's 63 point win versus Golden State (162–99).[359] They also held the record for most wins at home in the regular season (going 36–5 in 1971–72, then 37–4 in both 1976–77 and 1979–80) unil the Boston Celtics set the current record of 40–1 in the 1985–86 season. The Lakers play their home games at Crypto.com Arena, located at L.A. Live in downtown Los Angeles. The arena opened in fall 1999 and seats up to 18,997 for Lakers games.[360] Owned and operated by AEG and L.A. Arena Company, the arena is also home to the Los Angeles Clippers, the WNBA's Los Angeles Sparks, and the NHL's Los Angeles Kings.[360] Before moving to Staples Center, for 32 seasons (1967–1999), the Lakers played their home games at The Forum in Inglewood, California, located approximately 10 miles southwest of the team's current home.[167] During the 1999 preseason, the Lakers played their home games at the Forum before officially moving into Crypto.com Arena, and once again hosted a preseason game versus the Golden State Warriors on October 9, 2009, this time to commemorate the team's 50th-anniversary season in Los Angeles.[361] In the first seven years in Los Angeles, the team played their home games at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena, south of downtown Los Angeles.[362] While the team played in Minneapolis, the team played their home games at the Minneapolis Auditorium and the Minneapolis Armory from 1947 to 1960.[363] Roster Last transaction: December 29, 2024 The Lakers hold the draft rights to the following unsigned draft picks who have been playing outside the NBA.[364] A drafted player, either an international draftee or a college draftee who is not signed by the team that drafted him, is allowed to sign with any non-NBA teams. In this case, the team retains the player's draft rights in the NBA until one year after the player's contract with the non-NBA team ends.[365] This list includes draft rights that were acquired from trades with other teams. The Lakers have had three first overall picks in their history: Elgin Baylor (selected in 1958), Magic Johnson (selected in 1979) and James Worthy (selected in 1982).[368] The Lakers have also had six lottery picks in their history: Eddie Jones (selected tenth overall in 1994), Andrew Bynum (selected tenth overall in 2005), Julius Randle (selected seventh overall in 2014), D'Angelo Russell (selected second overall in 2015), Brandon Ingram (selected second overall in 2016) and Lonzo Ball (selected second overall in 2017).[368] Other draft picks include Jerry West and Gail Goodrich in the 1960s, Michael Cooper and Norm Nixon in the 1970s, A.C. Green and Vlade Divac in the 1980s, Elden Campbell, Nick Van Exel, Derek Fisher and Devean George in the 1990s, and Luke Walton, Sasha Vujačić, and Ronny Turiaf in the 2000s.[368] There have been 29 head coaches for the Lakers franchise. John Kundla coached the team in Minneapolis when they won their first five BAA/NBA championships from 1949 to 1954.[52] Pat Riley is second in franchise history in both regular season and playoff games coached and wins.[369] Phil Jackson broke Riley's regular-season wins record in 2009, and he passed Riley's playoff wins and games coached records in 2010.[369] Jackson, Riley, Kundla, and Bill Sharman have all been inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame for their coaching careers. George Mikan, Jim Pollard, Jerry West, Pat Riley, Magic Johnson, Kurt Rambis, Byron Scott and Luke Walton have all played and head-coached for the Lakers. Jackson, who had two stints as head coach, was coach from 2005 to 2011. In May 2011, Mike Brown was named his replacement for the 2011–12 season.[370] Brown was fired[371] on November 9, 2012, after a 1–4 start. Assistant coach Bernie Bickerstaff served as interim head coach for five games before the Lakers selected Mike D'Antoni as their new head coach. D'Antoni resigned at the end of the 2013–14 season. In July 2014, Byron Scott was hired as head coach.[372] After the 2015–16 season ended, Scott was fired. On April 29, 2016, former Lakers player Luke Walton was named as Scott's replacement,[373] and served as head coach until the end of the 2018–19 season.[374] Frank Vogel was named his successor on a multiyear deal announced on May 13, 2019.[375] Vogel was fired following the conclusion of the 2021–22 season.[376] On June 6, 2022, Darvin Ham was named as Vogel's successor as head coach.[377] However, Ham was fired by the Lakers on May 3, 2024, after the Lakers were eliminated in Game 5 of the first round by the Denver Nuggets. Among his accomplishments was leading the Lakers to their first In-Season Tournament championship.[378] On June 24, 2024, former NBA player JJ Redick was hired as the 29th coach in team history.[379] The Lakers have 41 Hall of Famers (31 players, 5 head coaches, 1 assistant coach, and 4 contributors) who contributed to the organization.[380][381][382] Notes: The Lakers have retired thirteen jersey numbers and an honorary microphone in honor of their players and broadcaster:[392][393][394][395][396] On January 13, 2025, Michael Cooper will have his #21 jersey retired.[397] In addition, several other players and coaches who were instrumental to the franchise's success during its days in Minneapolis have a banner commemorating them as Hall of Fame members of the Minneapolis Lakers, although jersey numbers for these players are not retired by the franchise:[400] For 41 years, Chick Hearn was the team's broadcaster until his death in 2002. He broadcast 3,338 consecutive games between November 21, 1965, and December 16, 2001.[401] Hearn came up with West's \"Mr. Clutch\" nickname.[402] He was a part of the team's \"inner sanctum\" when Cooke was owner, and was consulted on basketball decisions.[403] Paul Sunderland, who had filled in for a couple of games while Hearn recuperated in the 2001–02 season, was named the permanent play-by-play announcer. Stu Lantz was retained as the color commentator.[404] When Sunderland's contract expired in the summer of 2005, the team chose not to renew it.[405] Then, Joel Meyers moved in alongside Lantz as the television announcer, with Spero Dedes and former Laker player Mychal Thompson on the radio.[406] For the 2011–12 season, Bill Macdonald became the new television play-by-play announcer, joining Lantz who remained as the color analyst. Meanwhile, John Ireland joined Mychal Thompson to call the games on radio.[407] Beginning in the 2009–10 season, Lakers radio broadcasts were heard on KSPN (Los Angeles ESPN Radio affiliate) in English and KWKW in Spanish.[406][408] KLAC had the team's radio broadcast rights from the 1976–77 season until the 2008–09 season.[408][409] Until 2011, telecasts had been split between KCAL-TV (road games) and Fox Sports West (home games), unless they are chosen for national broadcasts on ABC.[410] KCAL had been the Lakers' over-the-air television broadcaster since 1977, dating back to when the station was the RKO General-owned KHJ-TV, the longest relationship between an NBA team and a television station. Prior to KHJ, Laker games were televised on KTLA. The Lakers had been on Fox Sports West since 1985, dating to when it was the original Prime Ticket and owned by Buss.[411] On February 14, 2011, Time Warner Cable and the Lakers announced the formation of two new regional sports networks (one in English, one in Spanish) that would exclusively televise the team's games and related programming for 20 years starting with the 2012–13 season.[412] The said networks were originally known as Time Warner Cable SportsNet, before it was renamed Spectrum SportsNet in 2016 upon Charter Communications' purchase of Time Warner Cable.[413]",

Alcohol is the common term for ethanol or ethyl alcohol, a chemical substance found in alcoholic beverages such as beer, hard cider, malt liquor, wines, and distilled spirits (liquor). Alcohol is produced by the fermentation of sugars and starches by yeast. Alcohol is also found in some medicines, mouthwashes, and household products (including vanilla extract and other flavorings). This fact sheet focuses on cancer risks associated with the consumption of alcoholic beverages. According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, a standard alcoholic drink in the United States contains 14.0 grams (0.6 ounces) of pure alcohol. Generally, this amount of pure alcohol is found in: These amounts are used by public health experts in developing health guidelines about alcohol consumption and to provide a way for people to compare the amounts of alcohol they consume. However, they may not reflect the typical serving sizes people may encounter in daily life. According to the federal government’s Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020–2025, individuals who do not drink alcohol should not start drinking for any reason. The Dietary Guidelines also recommends that people who drink alcohol do so in moderation by limiting consumption to 2 drinks or less in a day for men and 1 drink or less in a day for women. Heavy alcohol drinking is defined as having 4 or more drinks on any day or 8 or more drinks per week for women and 5 or more drinks on any day or 15 or more drinks per week for men. What is the evidence that alcohol drinking can cause cancer? There is a strong scientific consensus that alcohol drinking can cause several types of cancer (1, 2). In its Report on Carcinogens, the National Toxicology Program of the US Department of Health and Human Services lists consumption of alcoholic beverages as a known human carcinogen. The evidence indicates that the more alcohol a person drinks—particularly the more alcohol a person drinks regularly over time—the higher his or her risk of developing an alcohol-associated cancer. Even those who have no more than one drink per day and binge drinkers (those who consume 4 or more drinks for women and 5 or more drinks for men in one sitting) have a modestly increased risk of some cancers (3–7). Based on data from 2009, an estimated 3.5% of cancer deaths in the United States (about 19,500 deaths) were alcohol related (8). Clear patterns have emerged between alcohol consumption and the development of the following types of cancer: Numerous studies have examined whether there is an association between alcohol consumption and the risk of other cancers. For cancers of the ovary, prostate, stomach, uterus, and bladder, either no association with alcohol use has been found or the evidence for an association is inconsistent. However, evidence is accumulating that alcohol consumption is associated with increased risks of melanoma and of prostate and pancreatic cancers (4, 15). Alcohol consumption has also been associated with decreased risks of kidney cancers (16–18) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (19, 20) in multiple studies. However, any potential benefits of alcohol consumption for reducing the risks of some cancers are likely outweighed by the harms of alcohol consumption. In fact, a recent study that included data from more than 1,000 alcohol studies and data sources, as well as death and disability records from 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2016, concluded that the optimal number of drinks to consume per day to minimize the overall risk to health is zero (21). That study did not include data on kidney cancer or non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Alcohol consumption may also be associated with an increased risk of second primary cancers. For example, a meta-analysis of data from 19 studies showed that among patients with cancer of the upper aerodigestive tract (UADT)—which includes the oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, and esophagus—for every 10 grams of alcohol consumed per day before the first UADT cancer diagnosis there was a 1.09-fold higher risk of a second primary UADT cancer (22). It is less clear whether alcohol consumption increases the risk of second primary cancers at other sites, such as the breast (23–25). How does alcohol affect the risk of cancer? Researchers have hypothesized multiple ways that alcohol may increase the risk of cancer, including Alcoholic beverages may also contain a variety of carcinogenic contaminants that are introduced during fermentation and production, such as nitrosamines, asbestos fibers, phenols, and hydrocarbons. The mechanisms by which alcohol consumption may decrease the risks of some cancers are not understood and may be indirect. How does the combination of alcohol and tobacco affect cancer risk? Epidemiologic research shows that people who use both alcohol and tobacco have much greater risks of developing cancers of the oral cavity, pharynx (throat), larynx, and esophagus than people who use either alcohol or tobacco alone. In fact, for oral and pharyngeal cancers, the risks associated with using both alcohol and tobacco are multiplicative; that is, they are greater than would be expected from adding the individual risks associated with alcohol and tobacco together (10, 26). Can people's genes affect their risk of alcohol-related cancers? A person’s risk of alcohol-related cancers is influenced by their genes, specifically the genes that encode enzymes involved in metabolizing (breaking down) alcohol (27). For example, one way the body metabolizes alcohol is through the activity of an enzyme called alcohol dehydrogenase, or ADH, which converts ethanol into the carcinogenic metabolite acetaldehyde, mainly in the liver. Recent evidence suggests that acetaldehyde production also occurs in the oral cavity and may be influenced by factors such as the oral microbiome (28, 29). Many individuals of East Asian descent carry a version of the gene for ADH that codes for a \"superactive\" form of the enzyme. This superactive ADH enzyme speeds the conversion of alcohol (ethanol) to toxic acetaldehyde. Among people of Japanese descent, those who have this form of ADH have a higher risk of pancreatic cancer than those with the more common form of ADH (30). Another enzyme, called aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2), metabolizes toxic acetaldehyde to nontoxic substances. Some people, particularly those of East Asian descent, carry a variant of the gene for ALDH2 that encodes a defective form of the enzyme. In people who produce the defective enzyme, acetaldehyde builds up when they drink alcohol. The accumulation of acetaldehyde has such unpleasant effects (including facial flushing and heart palpitations) that most people who have inherited the ALDH2 variant are unable to consume large amounts of alcohol and therefore have a low risk of developing alcohol-related cancers. However, some individuals with the defective form of ALDH2 can become tolerant to the unpleasant effects of acetaldehyde and consume large amounts of alcohol. Epidemiologic studies have shown that such individuals have a higher risk of alcohol-related esophageal cancer, as well as of head and neck cancers, than individuals with the fully active enzyme who drink comparable amounts of alcohol (31). These increased risks are seen only among people who carry the ALDH2 variant and drink alcohol—they are not observed in people who carry the variant but do not drink alcohol. Can drinking red wine help prevent cancer? The plant secondary compound resveratrol, found in grapes used to make red wine and some other plants, has been investigated for many possible health effects, including cancer prevention. However, researchers have found no association between moderate consumption of red wine and the risk of developing prostate cancer (32) or colorectal cancer (33). What happens to cancer risk after a person stops drinking alcohol? Most of the studies that have examined whether cancer risk declines after a person stops drinking alcohol have focused on head and neck cancers and on esophageal cancer. In general, these studies have found that stopping alcohol consumption is not associated with immediate reductions in cancer risk. The cancer risks eventually decline, although it may take years for the risks of cancer to return to those of never drinkers. For example, ex-drinkers still had higher risks of oral cavity and pharyngeal cancers than never drinkers even 16 years after they stopped drinking alcohol, although it was lower than before they stopped drinking (34). One study estimated that it would take more than 35 years for the higher risks of laryngeal and pharyngeal cancers associated with alcohol consumption to decrease to the level of never drinkers (35). Is it safe for someone to drink alcohol while undergoing cancer chemotherapy? As with most questions related to a specific individual’s cancer treatment, it is best for patients to check with their health care team about whether it is safe to drink alcohol during or immediately following chemotherapy treatment. The doctors and nurses administering the treatment will be able to give specific advice about whether it is safe to consume alcohol while undergoing specific cancer treatments.

Drinking alcohol raises your risk of getting several kinds of cancer: Some studies show that drinking three or more alcoholic drinks per day increases the risk of stomach and pancreatic cancers. Drinking alcohol may also increase prostate cancer risk. All alcoholic drinks—including red and white wine, beer, and liquor—are linked with cancer. Drinking less alcohol is better for your health than drinking more. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends that adults of legal drinking age (21 years or older) choose not to drink alcohol or to drink alcohol in moderation (2 drinks or less in a day for men, 1 drink or less in a day for women). If you're taking prescription medicine, including cancer treatment, ask your doctor if it's safe to drink alcohol. When you drink alcohol, your body breaks it down into a chemical that damages your DNA. DNA is the cell's \"instruction manual\" that controls how a cell grows and does its job. When DNA is damaged, a cell can grow out of control and become cancer. For more information, see the National Cancer Institute's Alcohol and Cancer Risk web page. Each year, about 20,000 adults in the United States die from alcohol-related cancers. It is estimated most of these deaths may have been avoided if all adults had followed the recommended limits on alcohol use in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans instead of drinking above them.

Citation of the source is appreciated. Alcohol consumption has been linked to an increased risk for various types of cancer. A combined analysis of more than 200 studies assessing the link between alcohol and various types of cancer (i.e., a meta-analysis) sought to investigate this association in more detail. This meta-analysis found that alcohol most strongly increased the risks for cancers of the oral cavity, pharynx, esophagus, and larynx. Statistically significant increases in risk also existed for cancers of the stomach, colon, rectum, liver, female breast, and ovaries. Several mechanisms have been postulated through which alcohol may contribute to an increased risk of cancer. Concurrent tobacco use, which is common among drinkers, enhances alcohol’s effects on the risk for cancers of the upper digestive and respiratory tract. The analysis did not identify a threshold level of alcohol consumption below which no increased risk for cancer was evident. Keywords: AOD (alcohol or other drug) consumption; chronic AODE (effects of AOD use, abuse, and dependence); cancer; carcinogenesis; oral disorder; esophageal disorder; dose-response relationship; gender differences; tobacco in any form; distilled alcoholic beverage; drug concentration; risk analysis; meta-analysis Regular alcohol consumption can have numerous consequences, beneficial or detrimental, on the health of the drinker. For example, light-to-moderate alcohol consumption1 may protect against certain types of heart disease and stroke. Conversely, heavy drinking has been associated with liver disease; cardiovascular disease; disorders of the digestive tract; and illness or death from alcohol-related injuries, motor vehicle crashes, and violence. Another group of disorders that has been linked to drinking is cancer, particularly cancers of the upper airway and digestive tract (e.g., mouth, pharynx, larynx, and esophagus). Although alcohol has not been shown to cause cancer (i.e., be carcinogenic) in animal studies, strong epidemiological evidence indicates that consumption of alcoholic beverages increases the risk of those cancers. Alcohol consumption also is associated with primary liver cancer. This relationship is difficult to investigate in epidemiological studies, however, because it is more indirect. Thus, alcohol causes cirrhosis of the liver in a substantial proportion of heavy drinkers, which then can lead to liver cancer. In addition, heavy alcohol consumption can increase the drinker’s risk for infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV), which in turn can also result in liver cancer (for more information on the relationship between alcohol consumption and HCV infection, see the article in this issue by Lieber, pp. 245–254). Alcohol consumption also has been linked to cancers of the large bowel (i.e., colon and rectum) in both men and women and to breast cancer in women, although these associations have not yet been proven unequivocally. Nevertheless, because these are the two most common types of cancer in developed countries after lung cancer, even a moderate increase in risk may result in a relatively large number of additional cases and therefore have important public health implications. The association between alcohol consumption and other types of cancer (e.g., stomach, pancreatic, prostate, and endometrial cancer) is still controversial (International Agency for Research on Cancer [IARC] 1988; Doll et al. 1999). The increased risk of cancer among heavy drinkers is primarily attributed to the alcohol (chemically referred to as ethanol) in alcoholic beverages. Thus, the risk tends to increase with the overall amount of ethanol consumed. It is still unclear, however, whether any defined consumption threshold exists below which no increased risk for cancer is evident (IARC 1988; Doll et al. 1999). To evaluate the overall effects of alcohol on the cancer risk of a population, one must accurately quantify its effects on various types of tumors. To this end, researchers have performed comprehensive meta-analyses of published studies investigating the relationship between alcohol intake and the risk for numerous types of cancer. Meta-analyses are studies that pool data from several studies, thereby substantially enhancing the overall number of cases evaluated. This approach allows researchers to detect relationships that may have been overlooked in the individual studies because of the relatively small sample size and insufficient statistical power of those individual studies. This article summarizes the major findings of one such meta-analysis (Corrao et al. 1999, 2000). To identify scientific articles to include in the meta-analysis, the researchers followed three steps: First, they conducted a search of several bibliographic databases (e.g., MEDLINE, Current Contents, EMBASE, CAB Abstracts, and Core Biomedical Collection) for studies published between 1966 and 2000. Second, the investigators reviewed all references in the resulting articles to identify any studies that had not been found in the database search. And third, to ensure that the list of studies included was as complete as possible, the investigators conducted a manual search of the most relevant journals of epidemiology and medicine and compared their search results with those of other general reviews and meta-analyses published on this topic. Each article identified by this search process was reviewed and included in the analysis if it met the following three criteria: The article was a case-control or a cohort study published as an original article. Case-control studies compare people with a certain disease (e.g., cancer)—the cases—with a similar group of people without the disease— the controls. Investigators then collect information (e.g., regarding alcohol consumption) for both groups to determine whether differences exist between the groups. For example, significant differences between the groups with respect to alcohol intake suggest that alcohol was a causative factor in the disease. Cohort studies follow a group of initially healthy people over a prolonged period of time. At the outset, the investigators determine the participants’ drinking patterns so that they can relate drinking patterns and disease development during the followup period. The findings of the study were expressed as relative risk (RR) or odds ratio (OR) and considered at least three levels of alcohol consumption. The RR determines the strength of the relationship between a variable (e.g., alcohol consumption) and the development of a disease. The RR for a disease among people without the variable (e.g., among abstainers) is defined as 1.0. A RR among people with the variable (e.g., among drinkers) of greater than 1.0 indicates that the variable increases the risk of the disease. Conversely, an RR of less than 1.0 indicates that the variable has a protective effect. (The OR is used to estimate the RR under certain conditions.) The article reported the number of cases and non-cases (i.e., controls in case-control studies and person-time exposed during the followup in a cohort study) and estimates of the RR or OR for each exposure level. Two readers, who received no information on the names and affiliations of the authors of each study or the alcohol-related results, independently determined the eligibility of each article for inclusion in the meta-analysis. When the results of a study were published in more than one article, only the most recent and complete article was included in the analysis. To estimate the effect of alcohol consumption on the risk for each type of cancer studied, based on the pooled data from all studies included in the meta-analysis, the investigators used meta-regression models—statistical models developed specifically for such analyses (Corrao et al. 1999, 2000). For a more detailed description of these statistical analyses, see the textbox, p. 265, and the articles by Corrao and colleagues (1999, 2000). To determine the effects of alcohol on the risk for various types of cancer, the researchers used three statistical methods. They first pooled the original published data for each type of cancer. Subsequently, they determined the relationship between alcohol consumption and the risk for a given type of cancer by fitting to the pooled data several statistical models called fractional models (Royston et al. 1999). Such models can identify trends (e.g., J- or U-shaped curves) as well as other relationships between alcohol exposure levels and relative risks. The investigators then chose the best-fitting model to summarize the relation of interest (Corrao et al. 1999). Next, they assessed whether gender modified the effect of alcohol on the risk for each neoplasm. They also looked at the effect of adjusting the reported estimates for smoking when examining tobacco-related types of cancer. Finally, the researchers evaluated the variability (i.e., heterogeneity) among the studies’ results according to methods proposed by Greenland and Longnecker (1992). In all, 229 studies (183 case-control studies and 46 cohort studies) met the eligibility criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. These studies, which reported a total of 115,199 cases, investigated alcohol’s effects on the risk for developing cancer at a total of 19 sites in the body or at all sites combined (see the table and figure for a summary of the studies and their findings for each of those sites). For five of the cancer sites (i.e., small intestine, gall bladder, skin [melanoma], cervix, and kidney), alcohol’s effects were analyzed in only one or two studies; in these cases, the researchers could not calculate the pooled RR or 95-percent confidence interval (95% CI).2 For all other cancer sites, both the pooled RR and the 95% CI were determined for three levels of alcohol consumption (i.e., 25, 50, and 100 grams of alcohol per day, corresponding to approximately 2, 4, and 8 standard drinks3 per day, respectively). For most of the tumor types included in the studies, the analysis found a dose-dependent increase in risk from alcohol consumption—that is, greater alcohol consumption was associated with a greater increase in risk. Alcohol most strongly increased the risks for cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx (RR=5.7 for the highest alcohol consumption level), esophagus (RR=4.2) and larynx (RR=3.2). Appreciably smaller, although still statistically significant at the 5-percent level,4 increases in risk existed for cancers of the stomach, colon, rectum, liver, female breast, and ovaries. The smallest increases in risk were observed for cancers of the lung (RR=1.1 at the highest consumption level) and prostate (RR=1.2). For all these types of cancer, significant increases in risk existed even at the lowest consumption level studied here (i.e., 25 grams of alcohol, or two standard drinks per day). In contrast, no significant relationship existed between alcohol consumption and the risk for pancreas, endometrial, and bladder cancers. With the exceptions of cancers of the ovary, prostate, and bladder, significant heterogeneity across studies existed for each type of cancer; this means that results vary greatly among the various studies analyzed, so an overall summary of average effect across studies must be taken with caution. The researchers also investigated whether gender modified the effect of alcohol intake on the risk for each type of cancer. Statistically significant gender differences existed only for esophageal and liver cancer—where the alcohol-related risk was higher in women than in men—but not for other types of cancer. The results of eight appropriate studies were pooled to determine the relationship between alcohol consumption and the risk of cancer at all sites combined. This analysis found that alcohol consumption of at least 50 grams (i.e., 4 standard drinks) per day significantly increased the risk of developing any type of cancer. As with other meta-analyses of published studies, the analysis presented here has various limitations and strengths. One limitation is that for most types of cancer included, the estimates of alcohol’s effects tended to vary widely among the individual studies, making interpretation of the pooled data more difficult. Part of this variability may result from differences in the characteristics of the subjects included in the studies. For example, the gender of the study participants may play a role because potential differences in alcohol breakdown (i.e., metabolism) exist between men and women and may systematically influence the overall pooled estimates (Corrao et al. 1999, 2000). To control for this possibility, the investigators included separate analyses for men and women in their statistical models, where feasible. However, gender explained a significant portion of the observed variability in study results only for esophageal and liver cancer, but not for other types of cancers. Another limitation of this and other meta-analyses is that alcohol consumption levels may have been systematically underreported in several studies, leading to biased RR estimates. The statistical power of this meta-analysis also is somewhat limited because, although it included more than 115,000 cases, the numbers of cases for certain types of cancers (e.g., cervix and melanoma) were relatively small. Similarly, for certain cancers, there were only a few cases with certain levels of alcohol consumption (e.g., high levels of alcohol consumption in female breast cancer patients). Furthermore, biases resulting from confounding factors may have affected the pooled estimates. A confounding factor is a variable that is related to both the exposure variable (e.g., alcohol consumption) and the risk of disease (e.g., cancer). For example, alcohol intake may appear to be positively associated with lung cancer but the actual association may be confounded by cigarette smoking, which is related with both alcohol intake (because people who smoke also tend to drink) and the risk of lung cancer. Summary of the Studies Included in the Meta-Analysis NOTE: Table gives the pooled relative risks (RR) and corresponding 95-percent confidence intervals (95% CI) for three alcohol consumption levels. Those levels specified corresponded to approximately two, four, and eight standard drinks per day, respectively. The effects of gender and differences (i.e., heterogeneity) in the study results for various cancer sites also are presented. The RR indicates the strength of the relationship between alcohol consumption and a given type of cancer. A RR greater than 1.0 means that alcohol consumption at the level indicated increased the risk for that type of cancer. The greater the value over 1.0, the greater the risk. The 95-percent confidence intervals indicate the range of RR that is 95 percent likely to show a true RR. A statistically significant heterogeneity level indicates that results varied greatly among the various studies analyzed and that, therefore, an overall summary of average effect across studies must be interpreted with caution. The number of individual studies does not add up to the total shown because several studies examined more than one type of cancer. For this type of cancer, the RRs associated with alcohol consumption for males and females are listed separately because a statistically significant difference existed between the two sexes. n.s. = not significant One of the strengths of this meta-analysis is that the investigators performed a separate analysis of studies that also reported estimates adjusted for tobacco use, which contributes to various forms of cancer, prominently lung cancer. Such analyses were conducted for most cancers of the upper airways and digestive tract, as well as for lung and bladder cancer. These analyses found that tobacco use had a substantial modifying effect not only on the alcohol-related risks for lung and bladder cancer but also on the risk for laryngeal cancer. For example, when the investigators considered only studies reporting RRs not adjusted for tobacco use, the pooled RR for lung cancer at the highest level of alcohol consumption was 6.30. When they excluded such studies from the analysis and considered only studies reporting estimates adjusted for tobacco use, however, the pooled RR declined to 1.07. This finding indicates that alcohol itself only weakly increases the risk for lung cancer and that lung cancer risk primarily results from tobacco use, which is common in heavy drinkers. For laryngeal cancer, tobacco use also substantially influences the risk, though a strong association with alcohol consumption, indicated by a RR of 3.24, remained even when considering only studies presenting adjusted estimates. The association between various levels of alcohol consumption and an increased risk of liver cancer remains difficult to interpret even with the pooled data used in this meta-analysis. This difficulty results from the fact that, as discussed earlier, the association between alcohol consumption and liver cancer is only indirect. Furthermore, patients with liver cancer resulting from cirrhosis typically have reduced their alcohol consumption by the time they develop liver cancer (Aricò et al. 1994). This change in consumption levels may lead to an underestimate of the real association. Researchers have known about the relationship between heavy alcohol consumption and the risk for esophageal and other upper digestive and respiratory tract cancers since the beginning of the last century. Furthermore, substantial epidemiological evidence (as reviewed in this article) accrued over the past 50 years has shown that alcohol contributes to the development of these cancers. Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying alcohol-related cancer development remain largely unclear. To date, no experimental evidence indicates that alcohol by itself can cause cancer—that is, that alcohol can act as a complete carcinogen. Over the past few decades, however, several animal studies have indicated that alcohol can have a cocarcinogenic, or cancer-promoting, effect. This means that when alcohol is administered together with other known cancer-inducing agents (i.e., carcinogens), it promotes or accelerates cancer development. This effect was noted for several digestive tract cancers, specifically cancers of the esophagus and the nonglandular forestomach5 (Doll et al. 1999). For other cancers of the digestive tract (e.g., stomach, pancreas, colon, and rectum), however, the results are less clear and generally are variable across studies, possibly because of differences in study design. Researchers also have no clear understanding of the potential mechanisms through which alcohol might act as a cocarcinogen at these sites (IARC 1988; Doll et al. 1999). Moreover, the RR estimates based on the pooled data in this meta-analysis ranged from 1.1 to 1.3 for the highest level of alcohol intake. These values indicate only a weak association of alcohol with these types of cancer, which may possibly result from residual bias in the analysis or from confounding factors, such as diet. Therefore, one cannot draw any conclusions regarding a potential causal role of alcohol in the development of these cancers. For female breast cancer, the meta-analysis described here confirms the existence of a strong dose-risk relationship between alcohol consumption level and breast cancer risk. The exact role of alcohol in the development of breast cancer remains unclear. It is possible, however, that for breast cancer and other types of cancer related to disturbances in female hormone levels, alcohol may act by altering the metabolism and blood levels of female hormones, such as estrogen (Longnecker 1994). Moreover, a recent study suggests that the association may be limited to women with a family history of breast cancer (Vachon et al. 2001). Alcohol and tobacco enhance each other’s effects (i.e., act synergistically) on the risk for cancers of the upper digestive and respiratory tract.6 Studies conducted in North America, France, and Italy have shown extremely high RRs for certain cancers among people who both drink and smoke heavily (Doll et al. 1999). For example, in a series of case-control studies conducted in Italy, the RRs for the highest exposure levels to both risk factors were 80 for cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx, 12 for laryngeal cancer, and 18 for esophageal cancer (Franceschi et al. 1990). From a public health view, this synergism implies that over 75 percent of cancers of the upper digestive and respiratory tract in developed countries are attributable to alcohol and tobacco. Accordingly, the cessation or moderation of tobacco and/or alcohol use could avoid the majority of these cancer cases. Relationship between increasing amounts of alcohol and risk (i.e., relative risk or RR) for 14 types of cancer. The RR describes the strength of the relationship between a variable (e.g., alcohol consumption) and a disease (e.g., cancer). The RR for the disease in people without the variable (e.g., abstainers) is defined as 1.0. A RR among the people with the variable (e.g., drinkers) of greater than 1.0 indicates that the variable increases the risk for the disease. The greater the value, the greater the risk. The curves shown here were obtained by fitting certain statistical models to the data from several studies (i.e., a meta-analysis). Blue dotted lines indicate 95-percent confidence intervals; that is, the range of RR that is 95 percent likely to show a true RR. The synergism between alcohol and tobacco also implies that cancers of the upper digestive and respiratory tract in Europe and North America are extremely rare among people who have never smoked, and only limited data are available on the effects of alcohol in those “never-smokers.” Those limited data indicate that for oral and pharyngeal cancers (Fioretti et al. 1999; Talamini et al. 1998) as well as for esophageal cancer (Doll et al. 1999), high alcohol consumption in people who have never smoked is directly associated with an increased risk for these types of cancer. (For laryngeal cancer, the evidence in this respect is inconsistent.) The substances contained in tobacco products are not the only carcinogenic agents to which the upper digestive tract is exposed, however, and alcohol may facilitate or promote the effects of other carcinogens present in the diet or other environmental exposures. Researchers have made several attempts to determine whether different types of alcoholic beverages have different effects on cancer risk. Some studies found no apparent differences in the cancer risks associated with various beverages, whereas others have reported greater risks with spirits than with wine or beer (Doll et al. 1999). Researchers conducting a study in Normandy, France (Tuyns et al. 1979), reported an increased risk of esophageal cancer associated with apple-based drinks (e.g., apple brandy and hard cider). Two studies from Italy (Barra et al. 1990; Bosetti et al. 2000) found that people who consumed only wine had greater risks of oral, pharyngeal, and esophageal cancer compared with people who consumed wine as well as distilled spirits or beer after adjusting for the overall amount of alcohol consumed. Conversely, a Danish study found no excess risk for cancer of the upper digestive tract associated with wine consumption (Gronbaek et al. 1998). Taken together, these findings appear to indicate that the most frequently consumed beverage in each region or country tends to be the beverage associated with the highest estimated RR. However, this topic requires further study. Some researchers have suggested that drinks containing higher alcohol concentrations are more deleterious per gram of alcohol than drinks with lower alcohol concentrations. The evidence for this hypothesis, however, is weak and inconclusive (Doll et al. 1999). This meta-analysis includes most published information on alcohol and cancer and, the limitations discussed above notwithstanding, consequently provides the most accurate estimates of the RRs for common cancers considered to be alcohol-related. Some of the findings are novel and of specific relevance. For example, the analysis was unable to identify a threshold level of alcohol consumption below which no increased risk for cancer is evident. Furthermore, this meta-analysis found that the association of alcohol with the risk for oral and pharyngeal cancer appears to be stronger than the association with esophageal or laryngeal cancer across increasing levels of alcohol intake. In terms of risk assessment, this meta-analysis confirms that high levels of alcohol consumption (i.e., more than four drinks per day) result in a substantial risk of cancer development at several sites. Lower levels of consumption result in a moderately increased risk for various cancers. At the same time, other studies have shown that moderate alcohol consumption can have protective effects against certain types of heart disease. Accordingly, one must determine whether moderate alcohol consumption results in an overall favorable or unfavorable risk-benefit balance for the individual drinker or an entire population. This balance depends on the age, gender, and baseline disease rates among the members of a given population. In addition, genetic factors also may influence a person’s risk-benefit balance as suggested by the previously mentioned findings that the association between alcohol consumption and female breast cancer may be limited to women with a family history of breast cancer (i.e., with predisposing genetic factors) (Vachon et al. 2001). Consequently, any definite risk-benefit assessment for moderate alcohol drinking requires much more far-reaching analyses that are beyond the scope of this article but that in the future may provide important information from a public health perspective. Ms. Ivana Garimoldi provided editorial assistance in the preparation of this article. The definitions of light, moderate, and heavy alcohol consumption vary across studies. In the United States, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Department of Agriculture have defined moderate drinking as no more than one drink per day for women and no more than two drinks per day for men. Statistical analyses generally do not lead to a calculated, accurate result but instead provide an estimate of the result. The 95% CI is the range of the value under investigation that with a 95-percent likelihood contains the true value. In the United States, a standard drink frequently is defined as 0.5 ounces (oz) or 14 grams of pure alcohol. This alcohol amount is found in 12 fluid oz of beer, 5 fluid oz of wine, and 1.5 fluid oz of 80-proof distilled spirits. Statistically significant means that the observed result would occur by chance under hypothesized conditions less than a specified proportion of the time (usually 5 percent). These studies were conducted in hamsters. The stomach of a hamster is divided into a portion that does not contain glands which secrete digestive enzymes (i.e., nonglandular forestomach) and a portion closer to the intestine that does contain such glands. Similarly, synergistic effects have been reported between high alcohol consumption and dietary factors, such as low consumption of fruits and vegetables. Support for this study came from the Italian Ministry of Health, from the Italian Ministry of the University and Scientific and Technologic Research, and from the Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro.

                "title": "Virginia Tech Hokies football - Wikipedia",
                "content": "The Virginia Tech Hokies football team represents Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in the sport of American football. The Hokies compete in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and the Coastal Division of the Atlantic Coast Conference. They previously competed in the Big East. Their home games are played at Lane Stadium, located in Blacksburg, Virginia, with a seating capacity of over 65,000 fans. Lane Stadium is considered to be one of the loudest stadiums in the country, being voted number two in ESPN's 2007 \"Top 20 Scariest Places to Play\".[2] It was also recognized in 2005 by Rivals.com as having the best home-field advantage in the country.[3] Since beginning football in 1892, the Hokies have won over 700 games and appeared in 33 bowl games, including the 2000 BCS National Championship game. The Hokies rank 23rd among all Division I college football teams for most wins. The program had a streak of 27 consecutive bowl appearances, starting with the 1993 Independence Bowl and lasting through the 2019 Belk Bowl.[4] This was fourth-longest streak of consecutive bowl game appearances in college football history.[5] The program has also claimed eleven conference titles (3 South Atlantic, 1 Southern, 3 Big East, and 4 ACC) and produced eight Consensus All-Americans.[6][7] Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College (now Virginia Tech) first played football on October 21, 1892, against St. Albans Lutheran Boys School (Radford, Virginia). The game took place on a plowed off wheat field that was \"about as level as a side of Brush Mountain\".[8] The Hokies won their first game 14–10, but were defeated 10–0 eight days later on a return trip to Radford.[9] The first several VAMC teams wore cadet gray and black, but in 1896 the colors were changed to Burnt Orange and Chicago Maroon – a color combination that was unique among educational institutions at the time. The 1899, 1901, and 1903 teams lost only to rival Virginia. Star player Hunter Carpenter returned to Virginia Tech in 1905, after a year at the University of North Carolina, for a last shot at beating Virginia. Carpenter helped lead VPI to a 9–1 record, the best in school's history up to that time. He was never named to the All-America team only because Walter Camp, who named the team at the time, said he would never name a player who he had not seen play. The 1909 team claim a southern championship. This is the first season the team was referred to in print as the \"Gobblers,” which became the official nickname in 1912.[10] At the end of the 1911 season, VPI joined the South Atlantic Intercollegiate Athletic Association (SAIAA). They won the conference in 1916 and 1918. After 1921, the SAIAA was dissolved and six of its schools became founding members of the Southern Conference. From 1925 to 1928, Tech was led by Frank Peake and the \"Pony Express\" backfield. He was joined by Scotty MacArthur, Herbert \"Mac\" McEver and Tommy Tomko.[11] In 1927, during a 6–0 upset of the Colgate Red Raiders in New York, Peake ran for nearly 200 yards and scored the game's only points. During one three-game stretch, he accumulated rushing and return yardage of 306, 314 and 353 yards. He was credited with gaining 1,761 yards in eight games. 930 were from scrimmage, and 831 on punts and kickoffs.[12] In 1928 the game against Virginia he came off the sideline with an injured hip to return a punt for a touchdown.[11] In 1932, Tech upset Georgia 7–6.[13] Bill Grinus blocked the tying extra point.[14] Virginia Tech's first post-season bowl appearance was in the 1947 Sun Bowl in El Paso, Texas, against the University of Cincinnati.[15] Tech had a 3–3–3 record that year, and was the third choice after Border Conference champions Hardin–Simmons University and runner-up Texas Tech Red Raiders both declined the bowl invitation.[16] Tech lost that game 18–6. Another first for the Gobblers came in 1954 when they had their first, and only, unbeaten season in school history. The team was 8–0–1 and finished ranked 16th in the Associated Press post-season football poll.[17] The team's lone blemish was a 7–7 tie against William & Mary in Blacksburg, Virginia. Despite the team's success, it did not appear in a post-season bowl game. The 1963 team captured Tech's only outright SoCon championship.[13] In the 1970s, Tech briefly adopted an aggressive passing offense under head coach Charlie Coffey; quarterback Don Strock set virtually every passing record in the Hokies' book and would hold many for 30 years or more. Success, though, remained elusive. In the early 1980s, football coach and athletic director, Bill Dooley spearheaded a campaign for a new look and name for the mascot, which debuted at the 1981 football game against Wake Forest. The turkey-like figure was referred to as \"the Hokie mascot\", \"the Hokie\", and \"the Hokie bird\" (derived from the \"Old Hokie\" cheer), which resulted in changing the official designation of the Virginia Tech mascot to the Hokies. Dooley led the Hokies to the program's first-ever bowl win, in the 1986 Peach Bowl over NC State, but he also earned the program NCAA sanctions that led to his resignation that very offseason (after which he promptly sued the school). Though many hoped for recently departed Maryland coach Bobby Ross, athletic director Dutch Baughman turned to Frank Beamer, a Hokie alumnus and defensive back from 1966 to 1968. Beamer had worked his way up the assistant coaching ladder since his 1969 graduation before spending six seasons in the head job at Murray State. Among the assistants Beamer brought with him from the Racers was linebackers coach Bud Foster, who had joined Beamer's first Murray State staff as a graduate assistant immediately upon his own graduation there. Virginia Tech joined the Big East Conference for football play in 1991 (later joined for all sports in 2000). The Hokies were competitive in the new league early on, but could never beat annual foe, the Miami Hurricanes, despite eventually having a 6–6 record vs. the Hurricanes during the Big East years.[18] In 1993, the Hokies earned a trip to the Independence Bowl in Shreveport, Louisiana, its first bowl game under Beamer. With a win in that game, the Hokies notched only the fourth nine-win season in school history at the time. It became the first of 23 straight bowl games under Beamer, until he retired in 2015. After finally beating the Hurricanes during the 1995 regular season, the 13th ranked Hokies clinched a berth in the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans, Louisiana–the program's first appearance in a major bowl game. They beat the 9th ranked Texas Longhorns 28–10. This was a signature win for the Hokies, capping the most successful season to date; it became turning point for the program as a whole. Virginia Tech's most successful football season was in 1999 under the guidance of redshirt freshman quarterback, Michael Vick. Among other amazing moments, on November 3, the Hokies came from behind on the road, to win against the West Virginia Mountaineers. Vick led a desperate last minute drive that culminated in a dramatic Shayne Graham game-winning field goal. The 22–20 victory has since become known as the \"Miracle in Morgantown.\"[19] The team completed the year with its first ever undefeated regular season, finishing with an (11–0) record. On January 4, 2000, the Hokies faced the Florida State Seminoles in the 2000 Sugar Bowl for the national championship. A back and forth game, the Hokies trailed 28–7 late in the second quarter but came back to take a 29–28 lead at the start of the fourth. However, they were not able to hold on and the Seminoles won 46–29. The Hokies finished third in the AP Poll and second in the Coaches Poll–in both cases, the highest final ranking in school history and the highest ever for a Division I team from the Commonwealth. The following season, in 2000, the Hokies were again contenders for the national championship, but a loss to No. 3 Miami in early November, in a game in which Michael Vick was limited because of an injury, cost them a trip to the Orange Bowl. The Hokies later went on to defeat the Clemson Tigers 41–20 in the 2001 Gator Bowl in Jacksonville, Florida. At the start of the 2004 season, the Hokies faced the No. 1 and eventual national champion USC Trojans in the BCA Classic played at FedExField in Landover, Maryland. The Hokies kept the game close, but eventually lost 24–13. The regular season ended with the Hokies winning the ACC championship in their first year in the conference and a return to the Sugar Bowl and a match-up with the Auburn Tigers. Auburn, the SEC champion and one of three undefeated teams (USC and Oklahoma being the other two), took a 16–0 lead into the fourth quarter. Led by senior quarterback Bryan Randall, the Hokies scored 13 points but fell just short of the comeback when the Tigers recovered an onside kick and ran out the clock. The 2005 season saw many ups and downs, but would end in disappointment. Taking over for Bryan Randall was Marcus Vick, younger brother of Hokies great Michael Vick. The Hokies started off the season 8–0, including victories over West Virginia and ACC rivals Georgia Tech and Boston College. Going into the tenth week of the season, the Hokies were ranked 3rd in the country behind USC and Texas and would face the 5th ranked Miami Hurricanes at home. In anticipation of the match-up, ESPN's College Gameday would broadcast the game nationally from Blacksburg on ESPN. The Hurricanes controlled the game and limited Marcus Vick to only 90 yards passing to win 27–7. Marcus Vick led the Hokies and went on to win the ACC Coastal Division title, but lost in the ACC Championship Game to Florida State. The Hokies again trailed the Seminoles by double digits at halftime, 27–3, but a Vick led comeback brought the score to 27–22 with 1:45 left in the fourth quarter. The Hokies were unable to recover the onside kick and lost their chance at a BCS Bowl berth. The Hokies closed the season against the upstart Louisville Cardinals in the 2006 Gator Bowl. Virginia Tech won 35–24, but the game would become infamous for a play that would contribute to Vick's expulsion from the team. Late in the first half, with the Hokies trailing 17–10, Vick was tackled by Cardinals defensive end Elvis Dumervil. After the play, Vick stomped on Dumervil's leg, apparently out of anger. Four days after the game, Virginia Tech officials learned of two misdemeanor charges of speeding and driving on a suspended or revoked driver's license that Vick received on December 17, 2005. Vick, who was forced to sit out the 2004 football season by the university due to previous legal incidents in his college career, was dismissed from the team on January 6, 2006, with the university citing \"a cumulative effect of legal infractions and unsportsmanlike play.\".[20] Redshirt sophomore quarterback Sean Glennon was set to take over for Vick in the 2006 season. Although consecutive losses to Georgia Tech and Boston College knocked the Hokies out of contention for the ACC Championship Game, the Tech team finished the season strong, winning six in a row and being invited to the 2006 Chick-fil-A Bowl in Atlanta. In the annual ACC vs SEC match-up, the Hokies played the Georgia Bulldogs. At halftime the Hokies led 21–3, but four second half Glennon turnovers helped the Bulldogs in coming back and winning 31–24. After the April 2007 Virginia Tech shootings that stunned the campus and nation, the remainder of Tech's spring practice was canceled. The Hokies, led by running back Brandon Ore on offense and linebackers Vince Hall and Xavier Adibi looked to be in contention for a berth in the National Championship. The 2007 home opener against the East Carolina Pirates was the subject of College GameDay, and the Hokies prevailed in an emotional, albeit shaky, game 17–7. They then traveled to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, to play the LSU Tigers. In a game that saw Glennon replaced by true freshman quarterback Tyrod Taylor, the Hokies were completely dominated, only managing 149 total yards against the Tigers' 598. Taylor scored the only touchdown of the night after an 8-play, 65-yard drive. Taylor continued to start until an injury removed him from a 43–14 blowout of Duke. In a Thursday night match-up with Boston College, Glennon reclaimed his starting position. In a game plagued by rain storms and wet conditions, the Hokies took a 10–0 lead late into the fourth quarter. However, Eagles quarterback Matt Ryan spurred a late Boston College comeback, leading two TD drives in the final five minutes for a 14–10 win. Despite the devastating loss, Virginia Tech rebounded to win the remainder of its regular season games and claim the Coastal Division crown. A rematch with Boston College in the ACC Championship Game saw Tech fall behind early, tie the game by halftime, and then grind out a tense 30–16 win to advance to the Orange Bowl in Miami. After 29 seasons as head coach of Virginia Tech, legendary coach Frank Beamer retired following the conclusion of the 2015 season. He coached the Hokies to 23 consecutive bowl games, including a national championship appearance, along with seven conference championship titles. Beamer signed an 8-year contract with Virginia Tech, serving as an ambassador for the Athletic Department. During Beamer's tenure at Virginia Tech, putting points on the scoreboard became a full team effort with the offensive, defensive and special teams units. Often when the team scores one or more non-offensive touchdowns, the style of play is described as \"Beamerball\". Since Beamer's first season in 1987, a player at every position on the defensive unit has scored at least one touchdown, and 35 different players have scored touchdowns on Virginia Tech's special teams.[21] Sometime before the 1995 season, defensive coordinator Bud Foster wanted to give his defense something to rally around, an identity. A battered metal lunch pail was chosen as a symbol of a no-name, blue-collar defense. Each week a list of goals in put in the lunch pail and a player is chosen to have the honor of carrying the lunch pail onto the sidelines.[22][23][24] The Lunch Pail Defense Foundation was founded to fund academic scholarships for students from the area near Blacksburg, Virginia.[25] On November 27, 2015, former Memphis Head Coach, Justin Fuente was named the new head coach of the Virginia Tech Hokies. Fuente took over the team from the retiring, legendary coach Frank Beamer, following the 2015 Independence Bowl game. The Hokies finished Fuente's first year in 2016 with a regular season record of 9–3 and an overall record of 10–4. The Hokies became Coastal Division Champions for the 6th time and the first time since 2011. The Hokies played Clemson in the ACC Championship Game, losing 42–35. The team went to the 2016 Belk Bowl, in Charlotte, NC, defeating Arkansas, 35–24. Fuente was named the 2016 ACC Coach of the Year and he received many other accolades for the 2016 season. In 2017, the Hokies went 5–3 in ACC play, finishing second to Miami in the Coastal division, with an overall record of 9–4.[26] This result was good for a #22 ranking in the final 2017 CFB playoffs poll.[27] Earning a bowl game bid, Virginia Tech eventually lost to the Oklahoma State Cowboys 30–21 in the 2017 Camping World Bowl. The Hokies' performance slid under Fuente in their 2018 season. This time they finished fifth in the Coastal Division, posting a 4–4 conference standing and 6–7 overall record, losing their sole game against a ranked team.[28] They then lost 35–31 to the Cincincati Bearcats in the 2018 Military Bowl. Fuente steered Virginia Tech to better result in their 2019 campaign. The Hokies notched a 5–3 conference standing, ending up second to the Virginia Cavaliers in Coastal Conference play. In a dramatic game against the North Carolina Tarheels on October 19, 2019, the Hokies defeated their division rival 43–41 in 6 overtimes.[29] They went 1–1 against ranked opponents, with an overall record of 8–5.[30] Though the Hokies didn't have a final CFB playoff ranking, they did reprise their 2016 Belk Bowl appearance, this time facing the Kentucky Wildcats in the 2019 Belk Bowl, where they ended up losing 37–30.[31] The Hokies started the 2020 season ranked #24 in the preseason poll, ranking as high as #18 in by week four, then hovering around the top 20 until they eventually fell out of the poll after ranking #19 in week seven.[32] Fuente guided the team to a middling result, tallying a 5–5 ACC record and 5–6 overall standing.[33] Virginia Tech then ended its 27-year bowl game appearance record – the nation's longest streak at the time – opting to forgo postseason play. The challenges presented by the pandemic, combined with concerns over Fuente's performance, prompted the surprise announcement a day after a virtual press conference on Tuesday, December 15, 2020, called by Athletic Director Whit Babcock.[34][35] Virginia Tech kept Fuente at the helm as it began its 2021 season, producing a 4–4 ACC result and third-place finish in the Coastal Division, and a 6–7 overall record.[36] Fuente was fired with two regular season games remaining on November 16, 2021, after compiling an overall record of 43–31 in six seasons.[37] J. C. Price took over as interim coach to wrap-up the season. The Hokies then faced the Maryland Terrapins in the 2021 Pinstripe Bowl, losing 54–10. On November 30, 2021, the Hokies hired Penn State defensive coordinator and linebackers coach Brent Pry as the new head coach.[38] In his first season, the Hokies had a 3–8 record, 1–6 in the ACC. In year two, Pry led the Hokies to their first winning season since 2019. Tech trounced UVA 55–17 in the regular season finale in Charlottesville, to earn a bowl bid.[39] Then Tech beat Tulane 41–20 in the Military Bowl in Annapolis to finish 7–6. Virginia Tech claims 11 conference championships.[40]: 136–140 † Co-champions Virginia Tech won the ACC Championship in its inaugural season in the league in 2004. In 2005, the ACC Conference created two divisions, the Atlantic and Coastal, and a championship game between the divisions was established. Virginia Tech has appeared in the ACC Championship Game as the winner of the Coastal Division six times. Virginia Tech won the Coastal division in 2005 and played Florida State in the ACC Championship. Florida State won, 27–22. During the 2007 season, the Hokies once again took the Coastal division to set up a rematch of their earlier loss to Boston College. Virginia Tech prevailed 30–16. History repeated itself in 2008, when the Hokies defeated Boston College by a score of 30–12 after having lost to the Eagles during the regular season. In 2010 Virginia Tech went undefeated in league play, defeating Atlantic Division winner Florida State in the league championship game in Charlotte, North Carolina, 44–33. In 2011 Virginia Tech lost to Clemson for a 2nd time that season, their only two season losses. In 2016, Virginia Tech would fall short to Clemson, making a 3rd loss. † Co-champions The ACC eliminated Divisions for the 2023 season. The two teams with the highest winning percentage against other ACC teams play for the conference championship. Virginia Tech has played in 36 bowl games. The Hokies have appeared in several Gator, Peach, Sugar, Belk, Military and Orange bowls. Their overall record in bowl games is 14–22 through the 2024 season.[41] Virginia Tech and Virginia first met in 1895 and have played annually since the year 1970. Since 1964, the game has always been played at either Lane Stadium or Scott Stadium on the campuses of the two universities. But the series has at times been played in Richmond (1903, 1904, and 1957); Norfolk (1940, 1941, and 1942); and Roanoke (in 17 of the 19 years between 1945 and 1963). At 97 games, it is the longest series for the Hokies and second-longest for the Cavaliers, after the 118-game series between Virginia and North Carolina known as the South's Oldest Rivalry. The game counts for 1 point in the Commonwealth Clash each year, and is part of the greater Virginia–Virginia Tech rivalry. Virginia Tech leads in the Commonwealth Cup series 17–3[citation needed][when?] and the football series 58–38–5 as of 2019.[42] Three times this game has determined the Coastal Division champions with VT winning in 2007 and 2011, and UVA winning in 2019. The Hokies and West Virginia Mountaineers met 51 times between 1912 and 2005. The two teams played as conference foes from 1991 to 2003 as members of the Big East Conference (1979–2013). They met every year from 1973 to 2005. The Black Diamond Trophy is the trophy that goes to the winner of the game. It was introduced in 1997 and was meant to symbolize the Appalachian region's rich coal heritage (the phrase \"black diamond\" is often used as a term for coal.) Virginia Tech held the trophy in six of the nine years in which it was contested. The last two games played where on September 18, 2021, in Morgantown with West Virginia winning 27–21, and September 22, 2022, in Blacksburg with West Virginia winning 33–10. There are no further games scheduled in the series after the 2022 season. West Virginia leads the series 30–23–1 as of 2022.[43] The Hurricanes and Hokies first met on November 13, 1953, in Miami. Miami and Virginia Tech have met in two bowl games, the 1966 Liberty Bowl and 1981 Peach Bowl. The two teams have played annually since 1992, and the rivalry developed when the Hokies became a member of the Big East Conference for football in 1991. When the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) expanded in 2004, both Miami and Virginia Tech became members of the ACC. Both teams continue to compete annually as part of the ACC's Coastal Division. Miami leads the series 22–15 as of 2022.[44] The last game between the two teams was October 15, 2022, in Blacksburg, and Miami won 20–14. The two teams will next play during a yet to specified date in the 2025 season at Miami's home stadium, Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens. One of the Hokies' younger rivals is Georgia Tech. Prior to the Hokies joining the ACC in 2004, Virginia Tech and Georgia Tech had only met once previously (an additional scheduled meeting was canceled due to extreme weather). Since the ACC adopted divisional format for football, one of these two teams had represented the ACC Coastal Division in every ACC Championship Game except the 2013 season when Duke won the Coastal and 2015 when UNC won it. Over the years, the rivalry has become a significant annual matchup in the ACC, specifically when both teams are in both regularly in the AP Top 25 and the race for the Coastal Division championship. Virginia Tech leads the series 10–7 as of 2019, with Virginia Tech winning the past meeting.[45] The Boston College-Virginia Tech football rivalry began in 1993 with a 48–34 Boston College win in Chestnut Hill when the two teams began Big East conference round-robin play. When the two schools moved to the Atlantic Coast Conference the rivalry continued as the two schools were chosen as permanent cross-divisional rivals. The teams played twice in both the 2007 and 2008 seasons, as both teams won their respective divisions of the ACC and played each other in the conference championship. Although the Eagles defeated the Hokies in both the regular seasons those two years, Virginia Tech won the 2007 and 2008 ACC Championship Game played between the two schools. Virginia Tech leads the series 19–10 as of 2020, with Virginia Tech winning the past meeting.[46] Virginia Tech and VMI first met in 1894 and played annually from 1913 to 1971, usually in Roanoke on Thanksgiving Day. Like the current rivalry between VMI and The Citadel, the match-up was referred to as the Military Classic of the South, due to the military heritage of both schools. Starting again in 1973, the teams would continue to play on a yearly basis, making multiple appearances together in the Tobacco Bowl (1974, 1976) and Oyster Bowl (1980, 1982, 1984). The 1984 Oyster Bowl is the last time they played each other. However, in 2017, Virginia Tech and VMI agreed to a one-time rivalry matchup on September 5, 2026, at Lane Stadium. At 79 games, it is the second-longest series for the Hokies and fourth-longest for the Keydets. Due to the long pause of the VMI-VPI series, the Virginia–Virginia Tech rivalry has emerged as the dominant one in the state. Virginia Tech leads the series 49–25–5 as of 2019, with Virginia Tech winning the past six meetings. In 2002, the Virginia Tech athletics department developed a new policy on retiring jerseys. This special honor is bestowed to acknowledge an individual who has won an established national award in their sport. The Hokies has retired five numbers.[47] Additionally, Virginia Tech has four retired jerseys. These numbers can be worn normally by any player.[47] For the 2023 season, the ACC implemented a 3–5–5 scheduling system, with Pittsburgh, Virginia, and Wake Forest serving as the three teams played every year in a home-and-home basis.[48] On September 1, 2023, the ACC voted to add University of California, Berkeley, Southern Methodist University, and Stanford University to the conference starting in the 2024–25 school year,[49] which made the 3–5–5 schedule obsolete. Due to the expansion in 2024, the ACC is now scheduling games without a specific algorithm, and the conference released a schedule for 2024–2030 in October 2023.[50] Additionally, each season every ACC team schedules four non-conference games, including at least one against a \"Power 5\" team (which can include other ACC teams or FBS independent Notre Dame).[51] Announced opponents as of November 3, 2023.

                "content": "The undermanned Hokies put up a fight, but it wasn’t enough. It was a brutally tough game in Cassell. FSU pressed the entire game, and the Lady Hokies just couldn’t get consistent stops. Turnovers and FSU points off of them made the difference in this one. Lessons to learn. GO HOKIES!!! Carnell Warren is a big addition if the Hokies can keep him. It’s the last preview of the 2024 season, and it’s actually 2025. Several changes and lots of portal and sit-out losses make it a tough call for the Hokies. Bud Foster’s going to be on the microphone and headset for this one for the defense. Take the poll, hazard a guess. GO HOKIES!!! This Virginia Tech team will look MUCH different than the team from the regular-season finale. The Hokies hung tough for a while. No, the bowl game hasn’t been played, so technically the season isn’t over, but in reality, the season is over, and it’s time to review the major issues facing the Hokies for 2025. Lots of changes already in the works, but let's look at the general issues. GO HOKIES!!! Another former Mountaineer transfers to Hokies. Seldon was Virginia’s top high school player in 2023. Another new defensive back for the Hokies. A big-time addition for the Hokies. This is a big get for Brent Pry. The Hokies continue reshaping their secondary. As 2024 and the non-conference schedule comes to a close it’s critical for the sake of momentum and depth to get a door closing win with the bench emptying. The Lady Hokies managed that well on Saturday. Carys Baker gets a double-double in the books. Matilda Ekh leads with 15, Mackie Nelson had 14, with Rose Micheaux getting back in double figures with 10. A busy couple of days for the Hokies, who add talent to the defensive backfield. A terrible second half dooms the Hokies. Well, the portal taketh away, but if you work it right it giveth back. The Hokies pick up three really important new players and manage to keep a critical player on defense. We also check the Fall graduate list and see and very favorite name. Isaiah Ford came back to school and earned his degree. GO HOKIES!!! The Hokies are finally on the board Is Michael Vick the new Coach Prime? It’s the post season, and the personnel roster activity is going on with wild abandon. The non-traditional stuff (Transfer Portal and NIL) is making a big mess, but there are still the traditional announcements that will mean serious next level consideration for some players. GOHOKIES!!! The Hokies are officially a feeder program. Hokies win their second in a row after six consecutive losses. Not many folks thought that Radford was going to pose a serious threat to the Lady Hokies, but there were some serious moments in the 1st quarter that made you wince a bit. Carleigh Wenzel and Lani White put on a show. Hokies Pull away and win big. GO HOKIES!!! Some good news for the Hokies. The first shoe in the changes to the Virginia Tech Hokie football coaching staff dropped this evening, rather late. We received official word from the program that Coaches Marve, Crook, and Strength and Conditioning Coach Gault have been let go. Delane has one year of eligibility remaining Let the fun begin. It’s been a very long road trip, and an unusual ACC opener in early December didn’t turn out as well as we had hoped. Playing Duke in their house is always a difficult proposition and the Hokies just ran into everything difficult in this one. GO HOKIES!!! The Hokies will travel pretty close to home for a much better bowl than we expected. The January 3rd Duke’s Mayo Bowl is a solid opportunity for the Hokies to grab another bowl victory in front of a crowd that promises to be full of Maroon and Orange. The opponent in this one is the B1G Minnesota Golden Gophers and it’s not going to be a cakewalk. GO HOKIES!!! It was close, but the Hokies struggle in the second half again. Incoming freshman QB AJ Brand earns a prestigious honor. As it turns out, there was one surprise during the early signing period. The long road trip for the Hokies had its first homeward bound stop over for an ACC/SEC challenge game. Who knows? December 4th might have been this team’s breakout. It was an exciting duel all the way to the final 3:29. It’s a huge quality road win for the Lady Hokies. GO HOKIES!!! South Carolina cornerback Jordan Crim is a Hokie. Gambling Problem?

                "title": "China - Wikipedia",
                "content": "China,[h] officially the People's Republic of China (PRC),[i] is a country in East Asia. With a population exceeding 1.4 billion, it is the second-most populous country after India, representing 17.4% of the world population. China spans the equivalent of five time zones and borders fourteen countries by land.[j] With an area of nearly 9.6 million square kilometers (3,700,000 sq mi), it is the third-largest country by total land area.[k] The country is divided into 33 province-level divisions: 22 provinces,[l] five autonomous regions, four municipalities, and two semi-autonomous special administrative regions. Beijing is the country's capital, while Shanghai is its most populous city by urban area and largest financial center. China is considered one of the cradles of civilization: the first human inhabitants in the region arrived during the Paleolithic. By the late 2nd millennium BCE, the earliest dynastic states had emerged in the Yellow River basin. The 8th–3rd centuries BCE saw a breakdown in the authority of the Zhou dynasty, accompanied by the emergence of administrative and military techniques, literature, philosophy, and historiography. In 221 BCE, China was unified under an emperor, ushering in more than two millennia of imperial dynasties including the Qin, Han, Tang, Yuan, Ming, and Qing. With the invention of gunpowder and paper, the establishment of the Silk Road, and the building of the Great Wall, Chinese culture flourished and has heavily influenced both its neighbors and lands further afield. However, China began to cede parts of the country in the late 19th century to various European powers by a series of unequal treaties. After decades of Qing China on the decline, the 1911 Revolution overthrew the Qing dynasty and the monarchy and the Republic of China (ROC) was established the following year. The country under the nascent Beiyang government was unstable and ultimately fragmented during the Warlord Era, which was ended upon the Northern Expedition conducted by the Kuomintang (KMT) to reunify the country. The Chinese Civil War began in 1927, when KMT forces purged members of the rival Chinese Communist Party (CCP), who proceeded to engage in sporadic fighting against the KMT-led Nationalist government. Following the country's invasion by the Empire of Japan in 1937, the CCP and KMT formed the Second United Front to fight the Japanese. The Second Sino-Japanese War eventually ended in a Chinese victory; however, the CCP and the KMT resumed their civil war as soon as the war ended. In 1949, the resurgent Communists established control over most of the country, proclaiming the People's Republic of China and forcing the Nationalist government to retreat to the island of Taiwan. The country was split, with both sides claiming to be the sole legitimate government of China. Following the implementation of land reforms, further attempts by the PRC to realize communism failed: the Great Leap Forward was largely responsible for the Great Chinese Famine that ended with millions of Chinese people having died, and the subsequent Cultural Revolution was a period of social turmoil and persecution characterized by Maoist populism. Following the Sino-Soviet split, the Shanghai Communiqué in 1972 would precipitate the normalization of relations with the United States. Economic reforms that began in 1978 moved the country away from a socialist planned economy towards an increasingly capitalist market economy, spurring significant economic growth. The corresponding movement for increased democracy and liberalization stalled after the Tiananmen Square protests and massacre in 1989. China is a unitary one-party socialist republic led by the CCP. It is one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council; the UN representative for China was changed from the ROC to the PRC in 1971. It is a founding member of several multilateral and regional organizations such as the AIIB, the Silk Road Fund, the New Development Bank, and the RCEP. It is a member of the BRICS, the G20, APEC, the SCO, and the East Asia Summit. Making up around one-fifth of the world economy, the Chinese economy is the world's largest economy by PPP-adjusted GDP, the second-largest economy by nominal GDP, and the second-wealthiest country, albeit ranking poorly in measures of democracy, human rights and religious freedom. The country has been one of the fastest-growing major economies and is the world's largest manufacturer and exporter, as well as the second-largest importer. China is a nuclear-weapon state with the world's largest standing army by military personnel and the second-largest defense budget. It is a great power, and has been described as an emerging superpower. China is known for its cuisine and culture, and has 59 UNESCO World Heritage Sites, the second-highest number of any country. The word \"China\" has been used in English since the 16th century; however, it was not used by the Chinese themselves during this period. Its origin has been traced through Portuguese, Malay, and Persian back to the Sanskrit word Cīna, used in ancient India.[16] \"China\" appears in Richard Eden's 1555 translation[m] of the 1516 journal of the Portuguese explorer Duarte Barbosa.[n][16] Barbosa's usage was derived from Persian Chīn (چین), which in turn derived from Sanskrit Cīna (चीन).[21] Cīna was first used in early Hindu scripture, including the Mahabharata (5th century BCE) and the Laws of Manu (2nd century BCE).[22] In 1655, Martino Martini suggested that the word China is derived ultimately from the name of the Qin dynasty (221–206 BCE).[23][22] Although use in Indian sources precedes this dynasty, this derivation is still given in various sources.[24] The origin of the Sanskrit word is a matter of debate.[16] Alternative suggestions include the names for Yelang and the Jing or Chu state.[22][25] The official name of the modern state is the \"People's Republic of China\" (simplified Chinese: 中华人民共和国; traditional Chinese: 中華人民共和國; pinyin: Zhōnghuá rénmín gònghéguó). The shorter form is \"China\" (中国; 中國; Zhōngguó), from zhōng ('central') and guó ('state'), a term which developed under the Western Zhou dynasty in reference to its royal demesne.[o][p] It was used in official documents as an synonym for the state under the Qing.[28] The name Zhongguo is also translated as 'Middle Kingdom' in English.[29] China is sometimes referred to as \"mainland China\" or \"the Mainland\" when distinguishing it from the Republic of China or the PRC's Special Administrative Regions.[30][31][32][33] Archaeological evidence suggests that early hominids inhabited China 2.25 million years ago.[34] The hominid fossils of Peking Man, a Homo erectus who used fire,[35] have been dated to between 680,000 and 780,000 years ago.[36] The fossilized teeth of Homo sapiens (dated to 125,000–80,000 years ago) have been discovered in Fuyan Cave.[37] Chinese proto-writing existed in Jiahu around 6600 BCE,[38] at Damaidi around 6000 BCE,[39] Dadiwan from 5800 to 5400 BCE, and Banpo dating from the 5th millennium BCE. Some scholars have suggested that the Jiahu symbols (7th millennium BCE) constituted the earliest Chinese writing system.[38] According to traditional Chinese historiography, the Xia dynasty was established during the late 3rd millennium BCE, marking the beginning of the dynastic cycle that was understood to underpin China's entire political history. In the modern era, the Xia's historicity came under increasing scrutiny, in part due to the earliest known attestation of the Xia being written millennia after the date given for their collapse. In 1958, archaeologists discovered sites belonging to the Erlitou culture that existed during the early Bronze Age; they have since been characterized as the remains of the historical Xia, but this conception is often rejected.[40][41][42] The Shang dynasty that traditionally succeeded the Xia is the earliest for which there are both contemporary written records and undisputed archaeological evidence.[43] The Shang ruled much of the Yellow River valley until the 11th century BCE, with the earliest hard evidence dated c. 1300 BCE.[44] The oracle bone script, attested from c. 1250 BCE but generally assumed to be considerably older,[45][46] represents the oldest known form of written Chinese,[47] and is the direct ancestor of modern Chinese characters.[48] The Shang were overthrown by the Zhou, who ruled between the 11th and 5th centuries BCE, though the centralized authority of Son of Heaven was slowly eroded by fengjian lords. Some principalities eventually emerged from the weakened Zhou and continually waged war with each other during the 300-year Spring and Autumn period. By the time of the Warring States period of the 5th–3rd centuries BCE, there were seven major powerful states left.[49] The Warring States period ended in 221 BCE after the state of Qin conquered the other six states, reunited China and established the dominant order of autocracy. King Zheng of Qin proclaimed himself the Emperor of the Qin dynasty, becoming the first emperor of a unified China. He enacted Qin's legalist reforms, notably the standardization of Chinese characters, measurements, road widths, and currency. His dynasty also conquered the Yue tribes in Guangxi, Guangdong, and Northern Vietnam.[50] The Qin dynasty lasted only fifteen years, falling soon after the First Emperor's death.[51][52] Following widespread revolts during which the imperial library was burned,[q] the Han dynasty emerged to rule China between 206 BCE and 220 CE, creating a cultural identity among its populace still remembered in the ethnonym of the modern Han Chinese.[51][52] The Han expanded the empire's territory considerably, with military campaigns reaching Central Asia, Mongolia, Korea, and Yunnan, and the recovery of Guangdong and northern Vietnam from Nanyue. Han involvement in Central Asia and Sogdia helped establish the land route of the Silk Road, replacing the earlier path over the Himalayas to India. Han China gradually became the largest economy of the ancient world.[54] Despite the Han's initial decentralization and the official abandonment of the Qin philosophy of Legalism in favor of Confucianism, Qin's legalist institutions and policies continued to be employed by the Han government and its successors.[55] After the end of the Han dynasty, a period of strife known as Three Kingdoms followed, at the end of which Wei was swiftly overthrown by the Jin dynasty. The Jin fell to civil war upon the ascension of a developmentally disabled emperor; the Five Barbarians then rebelled and ruled northern China as the Sixteen States. The Xianbei unified them as the Northern Wei, whose Emperor Xiaowen reversed his predecessors' apartheid policies and enforced a drastic sinification on his subjects. In the south, the general Liu Yu secured the abdication of the Jin in favor of the Liu Song. The various successors of these states became known as the Northern and Southern dynasties, with the two areas finally reunited by the Sui in 581.[citation needed] The Sui restored the Han to power through China, reformed its agriculture, economy and imperial examination system, constructed the Grand Canal, and patronized Buddhism. However, they fell quickly when their conscription for public works and a failed war in northern Korea provoked widespread unrest.[56][57] Under the succeeding Tang and Song dynasties, Chinese economy, technology, and culture entered a golden age.[58] The Tang dynasty retained control of the Western Regions and the Silk Road,[59] which brought traders to as far as Mesopotamia and the Horn of Africa,[60] and made the capital Chang'an a cosmopolitan urban center. However, it was devastated and weakened by the An Lushan rebellion in the 8th century.[61] In 907, the Tang disintegrated completely when the local military governors became ungovernable. The Song dynasty ended the separatist situation in 960, leading to a balance of power between the Song and the Liao dynasty. The Song was the first government in world history to issue paper money and the first Chinese polity to establish a permanent navy which was supported by the developed shipbuilding industry along with the sea trade.[62] Between the 10th and 11th century CE, the population of China doubled to around 100 million people, mostly because of the expansion of rice cultivation in central and southern China, and the production of abundant food surpluses. The Song dynasty also saw a revival of Confucianism, in response to the growth of Buddhism during the Tang,[63] and a flourishing of philosophy and the arts, as landscape art and porcelain were brought to new levels of complexity.[64] However, the military weakness of the Song army was observed by the Jin dynasty. In 1127, Emperor Emeritus Huizong, Emperor Qinzong of Song and the capital Bianjing were captured during the Jin–Song wars. The remnants of the Song retreated to southern China and reestablished the Song at Jiankang.[65] The Mongol conquest of China began in 1205 with the campaigns against Western Xia by Genghis Khan,[66] who also invaded Jin territories.[67] In 1271, the Mongol leader Kublai Khan established the Yuan dynasty, which conquered the last remnant of the Song dynasty in 1279. Before the Mongol invasion, the population of Song China was 120 million citizens; this was reduced to 60 million by the time of the census in 1300.[68] A peasant named Zhu Yuanzhang overthrew the Yuan in 1368 and founded the Ming dynasty as the Hongwu Emperor. Under the Ming dynasty, China enjoyed another golden age, developing one of the strongest navies in the world and a rich and prosperous economy amid a flourishing of art and culture. It was during this period that admiral Zheng He led the Ming treasure voyages throughout the Indian Ocean, reaching as far as East Africa.[69] In the early Ming dynasty, China's capital was moved from Nanjing to Beijing. With the budding of capitalism, philosophers such as Wang Yangming critiqued and expanded Neo-Confucianism with concepts of individualism and equality of four occupations.[70] The scholar-official stratum became a supporting force of industry and commerce in the tax boycott movements, which, together with the famines and defense against Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598) and Later Jin incursions led to an exhausted treasury.[71] In 1644, Beijing was captured by a coalition of peasant rebel forces led by Li Zicheng. The Chongzhen Emperor committed suicide when the city fell. The Manchu Qing dynasty, then allied with Ming dynasty general Wu Sangui, overthrew Li's short-lived Shun dynasty and subsequently seized control of Beijing, which became the new capital of the Qing dynasty.[72] The Qing dynasty, which lasted from 1644 until 1912, was the last imperial dynasty of China. The Ming-Qing transition (1618–1683) cost 25 million lives, but the Qing appeared to have restored China's imperial power and inaugurated another flowering of the arts.[73] After the Southern Ming ended, the further conquest of the Dzungar Khanate added Mongolia, Tibet and Xinjiang to the empire.[74] Meanwhile, China's population growth resumed and shortly began to accelerate. It is commonly agreed that pre-modern China's population experienced two growth spurts, one during the Northern Song period (960–1127), and other during the Qing period (around 1700–1830).[75] By the High Qing era China was possibly the most commercialized country in the world, and imperial China experienced a second commercial revolution by the end of the 18th century.[76] On the other hand, the centralized autocracy was strengthened in part to suppress anti-Qing sentiment with the policy of valuing agriculture and restraining commerce, like the Haijin during the early Qing period and ideological control as represented by the literary inquisition, causing some social and technological stagnation.[77][78] In the mid-19th century, the Opium Wars with Britain and France forced China to pay compensation, open treaty ports, allow extraterritoriality for foreign nationals, and cede Hong Kong to the British[79] under the 1842 Treaty of Nanking, the first of what have been termed as the \"unequal treaties\". The First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895) resulted in Qing China's loss of influence in the Korean Peninsula, as well as the cession of Taiwan to Japan.[80] The Qing dynasty also began experiencing internal unrest in which tens of millions of people died, especially in the White Lotus Rebellion, the failed Taiping Rebellion that ravaged southern China in the 1850s and 1860s and the Dungan Revolt (1862–1877) in the northwest. The initial success of the Self-Strengthening Movement of the 1860s was frustrated by a series of military defeats in the 1880s and 1890s.[81] In the 19th century, the great Chinese diaspora began. Losses due to emigration were added to by conflicts and catastrophes such as the Northern Chinese Famine of 1876–1879, in which between 9 and 13 million people died.[82] The Guangxu Emperor drafted a reform plan in 1898 to establish a modern constitutional monarchy, but these plans were thwarted by the Empress Dowager Cixi. The ill-fated anti-foreign Boxer Rebellion of 1899–1901 further weakened the dynasty. Although Cixi sponsored a program of reforms known as the late Qing reforms, the Xinhai Revolution of 1911–1912 ended the Qing dynasty and established the Republic of China.[83] Puyi, the last Emperor, abdicated in 1912.[84] On 1 January 1912, the Republic of China was established, and Sun Yat-sen of the Kuomintang (KMT) was proclaimed provisional president.[85] In March 1912, the presidency was given to Yuan Shikai, a former Qing general who in 1915 proclaimed himself Emperor of China. In the face of popular condemnation and opposition from his own Beiyang Army, he was forced to abdicate and re-establish the republic in 1916.[86] After Yuan Shikai's death in 1916, China was politically fragmented. Its Beijing-based government was internationally recognized but virtually powerless; regional warlords controlled most of its territory.[87][88] During this period, China participated in World War I and saw a far-reaching popular uprising (the May Fourth Movement).[89] In the late 1920s, the Kuomintang under Chiang Kai-shek was able to reunify the country under its own control with a series of deft military and political maneuverings known collectively as the Northern Expedition.[90][91] The Kuomintang moved the nation's capital to Nanjing and implemented \"political tutelage\", an intermediate stage of political development outlined in Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People program for transforming China into a modern democratic state.[92][93] The Kuomintang briefly allied with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) during the Northern Expedition, though the alliance broke down in 1927 after Chiang violently suppressed the CCP and other leftists in Shanghai, marking the beginning of the Chinese Civil War.[94] The CCP declared areas of the country as the Chinese Soviet Republic (Jiangxi Soviet) in November 1931 in Ruijin, Jiangxi. The Jiangxi Soviet was wiped out by the KMT armies in 1934, leading the CCP to initiate the Long March and relocate to Yan'an in Shaanxi. It would be the base of the communists before major combat in the Chinese Civil War ended in 1949. In 1931, Japan invaded and occupied Manchuria. Japan invaded other parts of China in 1937, precipitating the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945), a theater of World War II. The war forced an uneasy alliance between the Kuomintang and the CCP. Japanese forces committed numerous war atrocities against the civilian population; as many as 20 million Chinese civilians died.[95] An estimated 40,000 to 300,000 Chinese were massacred in Nanjing alone during the Japanese occupation.[96] China, along with the UK, the United States, and the Soviet Union, were recognized as the Allied \"Big Four\" in the Declaration by United Nations.[97][98] Along with the other three great powers, China was one of the four major Allies of World War II, and was later considered one of the primary victors in the war.[99][100] After the surrender of Japan in 1945, Taiwan, including the Penghu, was handed over to Chinese control; however, the validity of this handover is controversial.[101] China emerged victorious but war-ravaged and financially drained. The continued distrust between the Kuomintang and the Communists led to the resumption of civil war. Constitutional rule was established in 1947, but because of the ongoing unrest, many provisions of the ROC constitution were never implemented in mainland China.[101] Afterwards, the CCP took control of most of mainland China, and the ROC government retreated offshore to Taiwan. On 1 October 1949, CCP Chairman Mao Zedong formally proclaimed the People's Republic of China in Tiananmen Square, Beijing.[103] In 1950, the PRC captured Hainan from the ROC[104] and annexed Tibet.[105] However, remaining Kuomintang forces continued to wage an insurgency in western China throughout the 1950s.[106] The CCP consolidated its popularity among the peasants through the Land Reform Movement, which included the state-tolerated executions of between 1 and 2 million landlords by peasants and former tenants.[107] Though the PRC initially allied closely with the Soviet Union, the relations between the two communist nations gradually deteriorated, leading China to develop an independent industrial system and its own nuclear weapons.[108] The Chinese population increased from 550 million in 1950 to 900 million in 1974.[109] However, the Great Leap Forward, an idealistic massive industrialization project, resulted in an estimated 15 to 55 million deaths between 1959 and 1961, mostly from starvation.[110][111] In 1964, China detonated its first atomic bomb.[112] In 1966, Mao and his allies launched the Cultural Revolution, sparking a decade of political recrimination and social upheaval that lasted until Mao's death in 1976. In October 1971, the PRC replaced the ROC in the United Nations, and took its seat as a permanent member of the Security Council.[113] After Mao's death, the Gang of Four was arrested by Hua Guofeng and held responsible for the Cultural Revolution. The Cultural Revolution was rebuked, with millions rehabilitated. Deng Xiaoping took power in 1978, and instituted large-scale political and economic reforms, together with the \"Eight Elders\", most senior and influential members of the party. The government loosened its control and the communes were gradually disbanded.[114] Agricultural collectivization was dismantled and farmlands privatized. While foreign trade became a major focus, special economic zones (SEZs) were created. Inefficient state-owned enterprises (SOEs) were restructured and some closed. This marked China's transition away from planned economy.[115] China adopted its current constitution on 4 December 1982.[116] In 1989, there were protests such those in Tiananmen Square, and then throughout the entire nation.[117] Zhao Ziyang was put under house arrest for his sympathies to the protests and was replaced by Jiang Zemin. Jiang continued economic reforms, closing many SOEs and trimming down \"iron rice bowl\" (life-tenure positions).[118][119][120] China's economy grew sevenfold during this time.[118] British Hong Kong and Portuguese Macau returned to China in 1997 and 1999, respectively, as special administrative regions under the principle of one country, two systems. The country joined the World Trade Organization in 2001.[118] At the 16th CCP National Congress in 2002, Hu Jintao succeeded Jiang as the general secretary.[118] Under Hu, China maintained its high rate of economic growth, overtaking the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Japan to become the world's second-largest economy.[121] However, the growth also severely impacted the country's resources and environment,[122][123] and caused major social displacement.[124][125] Xi Jinping succeeded Hu as paramount leader at the 18th CCP National Congress in 2012. Shortly after his ascension to power, Xi launched a vast anti-corruption crackdown,[126] that prosecuted more than 2 million officials by 2022.[127] During his tenure, Xi has consolidated power unseen since the initiation of economic and political reforms.[128] China's landscape is vast and diverse, ranging from the Gobi and Taklamakan Deserts in the arid north to the subtropical forests in the wetter south. The Himalaya, Karakoram, Pamir and Tian Shan mountain ranges separate China from much of South and Central Asia. The Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, the third- and sixth-longest in the world, respectively, run from the Tibetan Plateau to the densely populated eastern seaboard. China's coastline along the Pacific Ocean is 14,500 km (9,000 mi) long and is bounded by the Bohai, Yellow, East China and South China seas. China connects through the Kazakh border to the Eurasian Steppe. The territory of China lies between latitudes 18° and 54° N, and longitudes 73° and 135° E. The geographical center of China is marked by the Center of the Country Monument at 35°50′40.9″N 103°27′7.5″E﻿ / ﻿35.844694°N 103.452083°E﻿ / 35.844694; 103.452083﻿ (Geographical center of China). China's landscapes vary significantly across its vast territory. In the east, along the shores of the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea, there are extensive and densely populated alluvial plains, while on the edges of the Inner Mongolian plateau in the north, broad grasslands predominate. Southern China is dominated by hills and low mountain ranges, while the central-east hosts the deltas of China's two major rivers, the Yellow River and the Yangtze River. Other major rivers include the Xi, Mekong, Brahmaputra and Amur. To the west sit major mountain ranges, most notably the Himalayas. High plateaus feature among the more arid landscapes of the north, such as the Taklamakan and the Gobi Desert. The world's highest point, Mount Everest (8,848 m), lies on the Sino-Nepalese border.[129] The country's lowest point, and the world's third-lowest, is the dried lake bed of Ayding Lake (−154 m) in the Turpan Depression.[130] China's climate is mainly dominated by dry seasons and wet monsoons, which lead to pronounced temperature differences between winter and summer. In the winter, northern winds coming from high-latitude areas are cold and dry; in summer, southern winds from coastal areas at lower latitudes are warm and moist.[132] A major environmental issue in China is the continued expansion of its deserts, particularly the Gobi Desert.[133][134] Although barrier tree lines planted since the 1970s have reduced the frequency of sandstorms, prolonged drought and poor agricultural practices have resulted in dust storms plaguing northern China each spring, which then spread to other parts of East Asia, including Japan and Korea. Water quality, erosion, and pollution control have become important issues in China's relations with other countries. Melting glaciers in the Himalayas could potentially lead to water shortages for hundreds of millions of people.[135] According to academics, in order to limit climate change in China to 1.5 °C (2.7 °F) electricity generation from coal in China without carbon capture must be phased out by 2045.[136] With current policies, the GHG emissions of China will probably peak in 2025, and by 2030 they will return to 2022 levels. However, such pathway still leads to three-degree temperature rise.[137] Official government statistics about Chinese agricultural productivity are considered unreliable, due to exaggeration of production at subsidiary government levels.[138][139] Much of China has a climate very suitable for agriculture and the country has been the world's largest producer of rice, wheat, tomatoes, eggplant, grapes, watermelon, spinach, and many other crops.[140] In 2021, 12 percent of global permanent meadows and pastures belonged to China, as well as 8% of global cropland.[141] China is one of 17 megadiverse countries,[142] lying in two of the world's major biogeographic realms: the Palearctic and the Indomalayan. By one measure, China has over 34,687 species of animals and vascular plants, making it the third-most biodiverse country in the world, after Brazil and Colombia.[143] The country is a party to the Convention on Biological Diversity;[144] its National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan was received by the convention in 2010.[145] China is home to at least 551 species of mammals (the third-highest in the world),[146] 1,221 species of birds (eighth),[147] 424 species of reptiles (seventh)[148] and 333 species of amphibians (seventh).[149] Wildlife in China shares habitat with, and bears acute pressure from, one of the world's largest population of humans. At least 840 animal species are threatened, vulnerable or in danger of local extinction, due mainly to human activity such as habitat destruction, pollution and poaching for food, fur and traditional Chinese medicine.[150] Endangered wildlife is protected by law, and as of 2005[update], the country has over 2,349 nature reserves, covering a total area of 149.95 million hectares, 15 percent of China's total land area.[151] Most wild animals have been eliminated from the core agricultural regions of east and central China, but they have fared better in the mountainous south and west.[152][153] The Baiji was confirmed extinct on 12 December 2006.[154] China has over 32,000 species of vascular plants,[155] and is home to a variety of forest types. Cold coniferous forests predominate in the north of the country, supporting animal species such as moose and Asian black bear, along with over 120 bird species.[156] The understory of moist conifer forests may contain thickets of bamboo. In higher montane stands of juniper and yew, the bamboo is replaced by rhododendrons. Subtropical forests, which are predominate in central and southern China, support a high density of plant species including numerous rare endemics. Tropical and seasonal rainforests, though confined to Yunnan and Hainan, contain a quarter of all the animal and plant species found in China.[156] China has over 10,000 recorded species of fungi.[157] In the early 2000s, China has suffered from environmental deterioration and pollution due to its rapid pace of industrialization.[158][159] Regulations such as the 1979 Environmental Protection Law are fairly stringent, though they are poorly enforced, frequently disregarded in favor of rapid economic development.[160] China has the second-highest death toll because of air pollution, after India, with approximately 1 million deaths.[161][162] Although China ranks as the highest CO2 emitting country,[163] it only emits 8 tons of CO2 per capita, significantly lower than developed countries such as the United States (16.1), Australia (16.8) and South Korea (13.6).[164] Greenhouse gas emissions by China are the world's largest.[164] The country has significant water pollution problems; only 89.4% of China's national surface water was graded suitable for human consumption by the Ministry of Ecology and Environment in 2023.[165] China has prioritized clamping down on pollution, bringing a significant decrease in air pollution in the 2010s.[166] In 2020, the Chinese government announced its aims for the country to reach its peak emissions levels before 2030, and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060 in line with the Paris Agreement,[167] which, according to Climate Action Tracker, would lower the expected rise in global temperature by 0.2–0.3 degrees – \"the biggest single reduction ever estimated by the Climate Action Tracker\".[167] China is the world's leading investor in renewable energy and its commercialization, with $546 billion invested in 2022;[168] it is a major manufacturer of renewable energy technologies and invests heavily in local-scale renewable energy projects.[169][168] Long heavily relying on non-renewable energy sources such as coal, China's adaptation of renewable energy has increased significantly in recent years, with their share increasing from 26.3 percent in 2016 to 31.9 percent in 2022.[170] In 2023, 60.5% of China's electricity came from coal (largest producer in the world), 13.2% from hydroelectric power (largest), 9.4% from wind (largest), 6.2% from solar energy (largest), 4.6% from nuclear energy (second-largest), 3.3% from natural gas (fifth-largest), and 2.2% from bioenergy (largest); in total, 31% of China's energy came from renewable energy sources.[171] Despite its emphasis on renewables, China remains deeply connected to global oil markets and next to India, has been the largest importer of Russian crude oil in 2022.[172][173] According to China's government, the forest coverage of the country grew from 10% of the overall territory in 1949 to 25% in 2024.[174] China is the third-largest country in the world by land area after Russia, and the third- or fourth-largest country in the world by total area.[r] China's total area is generally stated as being approximately 9,600,000 km2 (3,700,000 sq mi).[175] Specific area figures range from 9,572,900 km2 (3,696,100 sq mi) according to the Encyclopædia Britannica,[14] to 9,596,961 km2 (3,705,407 sq mi) according to the UN Demographic Yearbook,[6] and The World Factbook.[5] China has the longest combined land border in the world, measuring 22,117 km (13,743 mi) and its coastline covers approximately 14,500 km (9,000 mi) from the mouth of the Yalu River (Amnok River) to the Gulf of Tonkin.[5] China borders 14 nations and covers the bulk of East Asia, bordering Vietnam, Laos, and Myanmar in Southeast Asia; India, Bhutan, Nepal, Pakistan[s] and Afghanistan in South Asia; Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan in Central Asia; and Russia, Mongolia, and North Korea in Inner Asia and Northeast Asia. It is narrowly separated from Bangladesh and Thailand to the southwest and south, and has several maritime neighbors such as Japan, Philippines, Malaysia, and Indonesia.[176] China has resolved its land borders with 12 out of 14 neighboring countries, having pursued substantial compromises in most of them.[177][178][179] China currently has a disputed land border with India[180] and Bhutan.[181] China is additionally involved in maritime disputes with multiple countries over territory in the East and South China Seas, such as the Senkaku Islands and the entirety of South China Sea Islands.[182][183] The People's Republic of China is a one-party state governed by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The CCP is officially guided by socialism with Chinese characteristics, which is Marxism adapted to Chinese circumstances.[184] The Chinese constitution states that the PRC \"is a socialist state governed by a people's democratic dictatorship that is led by the working class and based on an alliance of workers and peasants,\" that the state institutions \"shall practice the principle of democratic centralism,\"[185] and that \"the defining feature of socialism with Chinese characteristics is the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.\"[186] The PRC officially terms itself as a democracy, using terms such as \"socialist consultative democracy\",[187] and \"whole-process people's democracy\".[188] However, the country is commonly described as an authoritarian one-party state and a dictatorship,[189][190] with among the heaviest restrictions worldwide in many areas, most notably against freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, free formation of social organizations, freedom of religion and free access to the Internet.[191] China has consistently been ranked amongst the lowest as an \"authoritarian regime\" by the Economist Intelligence Unit's Democracy Index, ranking at 148th out of 167 countries in 2023.[192] Other sources suggest that terming China as \"authoritarian\" does not sufficiently account for the multiple consultation mechanisms that exist in Chinese government.[193] According to the CCP constitution, its highest body is the National Congress held every five years.[194] The National Congress elects the Central Committee, who then elects the party's Politburo, Politburo Standing Committee and the general secretary (party leader), the top leadership of the country.[194] The general secretary holds ultimate power and authority over party and state and serves as the informal paramount leader.[195] The current general secretary is Xi Jinping, who took office on 15 November 2012.[196] At the local level, the secretary of the CCP committee of a subdivision outranks the local government level; CCP committee secretary of a provincial division outranks the governor while the CCP committee secretary of a city outranks the mayor.[197] The government in China is under the sole control of the CCP.[198] The CCP controls appointments in government bodies, with most senior government officials being CCP members.[198] The National People's Congress (NPC), with nearly 3,000-members, is constitutionally the \"highest organ of state power\",[185] though it has been also described as a \"rubber stamp\" body.[199] The NPC meets annually, while the NPC Standing Committee, around 150 members elected from NPC delegates, meets every couple of months.[199] Elections are indirect and not pluralistic, with nominations at all levels being controlled by the CCP.[188] The NPC is dominated by the CCP, with another eight minor parties having nominal representation under the condition of upholding CCP leadership.[200] The president is elected by the NPC. The presidency is the ceremonial state representative, but not the constitutional head of state. The incumbent president is Xi Jinping, who is also the general secretary of the CCP and the chairman of the Central Military Commission, making him China's paramount leader and supreme commander of the Armed Forces. The premier is the head of government, with Li Qiang being the incumbent. The premier is officially nominated by the president and then elected by the NPC, and has generally been either the second- or third-ranking member of the Politburo Standing Committee (PSC). The premier presides over the State Council, China's cabinet, composed of four vice premiers, state councilors, and the heads of ministries and commissions.[185] The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) is a political advisory body that is critical in China's \"united front\" system, which aims to gather non-CCP voices to support the CCP. Similar to the people's congresses, CPPCC's exist at various division, with the National Committee of the CPPCC being chaired by Wang Huning, fourth-ranking member of the PSC.[201] The governance of China is characterized by a high degree of political centralization but significant economic decentralization.[202]: 7 Policy instruments or processes are often tested locally before being applied more widely, resulting in a policy that involves experimentation and feedback.[203]: 14 Generally, central government leadership refrains from drafting specific policies, instead using the informal networks and site visits to affirm or suggest changes to the direction of local policy experiments or pilot programs.[204]: 71 The typical approach is that central government leadership begins drafting formal policies, law, or regulations after policy has been developed at local levels.[204]: 71 The PRC is constitutionally a unitary state divided into 23 provinces,[t] five autonomous regions (each with a designated minority group), and four direct-administered municipalities—collectively referred to as \"mainland China\"—as well as the special administrative regions (SARs) of Hong Kong and Macau.[205] The PRC regards the island of Taiwan as its Taiwan Province, Kinmen and Matsu as a part of Fujian Province and islands the ROC controls in the South China Sea as a part of Hainan Province and Guangdong Province, although all these territories are governed by the Republic of China (ROC).[206][33] Geographically, all 31 provincial divisions of mainland China can be grouped into six regions: North China, East China, Southwestern China, South Central China, Northeast China, and Northwestern China.[207] Taiwan (台湾省), governed by the Republic of China The PRC has diplomatic relations with 179 United Nation members states and maintains embassies in 174. As of 2024[update], China has one of the largest diplomatic networks of any country in the world.[208] In 1971, the PRC replaced the Republic of China (ROC) as the sole representative of China in the United Nations and as one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council.[209] It is a member of intergovernmental organizations including the G20,[210] the SCO,[211] the BRICS,[212] the East Asia Summit,[213] and the APEC.[214] China was also a former member and leader of the Non-Aligned Movement, and still considers itself an advocate for developing countries.[215] The PRC officially maintains the one-China principle, which holds the view that there is only one sovereign state in the name of China, represented by the PRC, and that Taiwan is part of that China.[216] The unique status of Taiwan has led to countries recognizing the PRC to maintain unique \"one-China policies\" that differ from each other; some countries explicitly recognize the PRC's claim over Taiwan, while others, including the U.S. and Japan, only acknowledge the claim.[216] Chinese officials have protested on numerous occasions when foreign countries have made diplomatic overtures to Taiwan,[217] especially in the matter of armament sales.[218] Most countries have switched recognition from the ROC to the PRC since the latter replaced the former in the UN in 1971.[219] Much of current Chinese foreign policy is reportedly based on Premier Zhou Enlai's Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and is also driven by the concept of \"harmony without uniformity\", which encourages diplomatic relations between states despite ideological differences.[220] This policy may have led China to support or maintain close ties with states that are regarded as dangerous and repressive by Western nations, such as Sudan,[221] North Korea and Iran.[222] China's close relationship with Myanmar has involved support for its ruling governments as well as for its ethnic rebel groups,[223] including the Arakan Army.[224] China has a close political, economic and military relationship with Russia,[225] and the two states often vote in unison in the UN Security Council.[226][227][228] China's relationship with the United States is complex, and includes deep trade ties but significant political differences.[229] Since the early 2000s, China has followed a policy of engaging with African nations for trade and bilateral co-operation.[230][231][232] It maintains extensive and highly diversified trade links with the European Union, and became its largest trading partner for goods.[233] China is increasing its influence in Central Asia[234] and South Pacific.[235] The country has strong trade ties with ASEAN countries[236] and major South American economies,[237] and is the largest trading partner of Brazil, Chile, Peru, Uruguay, Argentina, and several others.[238] In 2013, China initiated the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a large global infrastructure building initiative with funding on the order of $50–100 billion per year.[239] BRI could be one of the largest development plans in modern history.[240] It expanded significantly over the next six years and, as of April 2020[update], included 138 countries and 30 international organizations. In addition to intensifying foreign policy relations, the focus is particularly on building efficient transport routes, especially the maritime Silk Road with its connections to East Africa and Europe. However many loans made under the program are unsustainable and China has faced a number of calls for debt relief from debtor nations.[241][242] The People's Liberation Army (PLA) is considered one of the world's most powerful militaries and has rapidly modernized in the recent decades.[243] It has also been accused of technology theft by some countries.[244][245][246] Since 2024, it consists of four services: the Ground Force (PLAGF), the Navy (PLAN), the Air Force (PLAAF) and the Rocket Force (PLARF). It also has four independent arms: the Aerospace Force, the Cyberspace Force, the Information Support Force, and the Joint Logistics Support Force, the first three of which were split from the disbanded Strategic Support Force (PLASSF).[247] Its nearly 2.2 million active duty personnel is the largest in the world. The PLA holds the world's third-largest stockpile of nuclear weapons,[248][249] and the world's second-largest navy by tonnage.[250] China's official military budget for 2023 totalled US$224 billion (1.55 trillion Yuan), the second-largest in the world, though SIPRI estimates that its real expenditure that year was US$296 billion, making up 12% of global military spending and accounting for 1.7% of the country's GDP.[251] According to SIPRI, its military spending from 2012 to 2021 averaged US$215 billion per year or 1.7 per cent of GDP, behind only the United States at US$734 billion per year or 3.6 per cent of GDP.[252] The PLA is commanded by the Central Military Commission (CMC) of the party and the state; though officially two separate organizations, the two CMCs have identical membership except during leadership transition periods and effectively function as one organization. The chairman of the CMC is the commander-in-chief of the PLA.[253] The situation of human rights in China has attracted significant criticism from foreign governments, foreign press agencies, and non-governmental organizations, alleging widespread civil rights violations such as detention without trial, forced confessions, torture, restrictions of fundamental rights, and excessive use of the death penalty.[191][254] Since its inception, Freedom House has ranked China as \"not free\" in its Freedom in the World survey,[191] while Amnesty International has documented significant human rights abuses.[254] The Chinese constitution states that the \"fundamental rights\" of citizens include freedom of speech, freedom of the press, the right to a fair trial, freedom of religion, universal suffrage, and property rights. However, in practice, these provisions do not afford significant protection against criminal prosecution by the state.[255][256] China has limited protections regarding LGBT rights.[257] Although some criticisms of government policies and the ruling CCP are tolerated, censorship of political speech and information are amongst the harshest in the world and routinely used to prevent collective action.[258] China also has the most comprehensive and sophisticated Internet censorship regime in the world, with numerous websites being blocked.[259] The government suppresses popular protests and demonstrations that it considers a potential threat to \"social stability\".[260] China additionally uses a massive espionage network of cameras, facial recognition software, sensors, and surveillance of personal technology as a means of social control of persons living in the country.[261] China is regularly accused of large-scale repression and human rights abuses in Tibet and Xinjiang,[263][264][265] where significant numbers of ethnic minorities reside, including violent police crackdowns and religious suppression.[266][267] Since 2017, the Chinese government has been engaged in a harsh crackdown in Xinjiang, with around one million Uyghurs and other ethnic and religion minorities being detained in internment camps aimed at changing the political thinking of detainees, their identities, and their religious beliefs.[268] According to Western reports, political indoctrination, torture, physical and psychological abuse, forced sterilization, sexual abuse, and forced labor are common in these facilities.[269] According to a 2020 Foreign Policy report, China's treatment of Uyghurs meets the UN definition of genocide,[270] while a separate UN Human Rights Office report said they could potentially meet the definitions for crimes against humanity.[271] The Chinese authorities have also cracked down on dissent in Hong Kong, especially after the passage of a national security law in 2020.[272] In 2017 and 2020, the Pew Research Center ranked the severity of Chinese government restrictions on religion as being among the world's highest, despite ranking religious-related social hostilities in China as low in severity.[273][274] The Global Slavery Index estimated that in 2016 more than 3.8 million people (0.25% of the population) were living in \"conditions of modern slavery\", including victims of human trafficking, forced labor, forced marriage, child labor, and state-imposed forced labor. The state-imposed re-education through labor (laojiao) system was formally abolished in 2013, but it is not clear to what extent its practices have stopped.[275] The much larger reform through labor (laogai) system includes labor prison factories, detention centers, and re-education camps; the Laogai Research Foundation has estimated in June 2008 that there were nearly 1,422 of these facilities, though it cautioned that this number was likely an underestimate.[276] Political concerns in China include the growing gap between rich and poor and government corruption.[277] Nonetheless, international surveys show the Chinese public have a high level of satisfaction with their government.[202]: 137 These views are generally attributed to the material comforts and security available to large segments of the Chinese populace as well as the government's attentiveness and responsiveness.[202] : 136 According to the World Values Survey (2022), 91% of Chinese respondents have significant confidence in their government.[202]: 13 A Harvard University survey published in July 2020 found that citizen satisfaction with the government had increased since 2003, also rating China's government as more effective and capable than ever in the survey's history.[278] China has the world's second-largest economy in terms of nominal GDP,[279] and the world's largest in terms of purchasing power parity (PPP).[280] As of 2022[update], China accounts for around 18% of the global economy by nominal GDP.[281] China is one of the world's fastest-growing major economies,[282] with its economic growth having been almost consistently above 6 percent since the introduction of economic reforms in 1978.[283] According to the World Bank, China's GDP grew from $150 billion in 1978 to $17.96 trillion by 2022.[284] It ranks at 64th at nominal GDP per capita, making it an upper-middle income country.[285] Of the world's 500 largest companies, 135 are headquartered in China.[286] As of at least 2024, China has the world's second-largest equity markets and futures markets, as well as the third-largest bond market.[287]: 153 China was one of the world's foremost economic powers throughout the arc of East Asian and global history. The country had one of the largest economies in the world for most of the past two millennia,[288] during which it has seen cycles of prosperity and decline.[54][289] Since economic reforms began in 1978, China has developed into a highly diversified economy and one of the most consequential players in international trade. Major sectors of competitive strength include manufacturing, retail, mining, steel, textiles, automobiles, energy generation, green energy, banking, electronics, telecommunications, real estate, e-commerce, and tourism. China has three out of the ten largest stock exchanges in the world[290]—Shanghai, Hong Kong and Shenzhen—that together have a market capitalization of over $15.9 trillion, as of October 2020[update].[291] China has three (Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Shenzhen) out of the world's top ten most competitive financial centers according to the 2024 Global Financial Centres Index.[292] Modern-day China is often described as an example of state capitalism or party-state capitalism.[294][295] The state dominates in strategic \"pillar\" sectors such as energy production and heavy industries, but private enterprise has expanded enormously, with around 30 million private businesses recorded in 2008.[296][297][298] According to official statistics, privately owned companies constitute more than 60% of China's GDP.[299] China has been the world's largest manufacturing nation since 2010, after overtaking the U.S., which had been the largest for the previous hundred years.[300][301] China has also been the second-largest in high-tech manufacturing country since 2012, according to US National Science Foundation.[302] China is the second-largest retail market after the United States.[303] China leads the world in e-commerce, accounting for over 37% of the global market share in 2021.[304] China is the world's leader in electric vehicle consumption and production, manufacturing and buying half of all the plug-in electric cars (BEV and PHEV) in the world as of 2022[update].[305] China is also the leading producer of batteries for electric vehicles as well as several key raw materials for batteries.[306] China received 65.7 million international visitors in 2019,[307] and in 2018 was the fourth-most-visited country in the world.[307] It also experiences an enormous volume of domestic tourism; Chinese tourists made an estimated 6 billion travels within the country in 2019.[308] China hosts the world's second-largest number of World Heritage Sites (56) after Italy, and is one of the most popular tourist destinations (first in the Asia-Pacific). China accounted for 18.6% of the world's total wealth in 2022, second highest in the world after the U.S.[309] China brought more people out of extreme poverty than any other country in history[310][311]—between 1978 and 2018, China reduced extreme poverty by 800 million.[202]: 23 From 1990 to 2018, the proportion of the Chinese population living with an income of less than $1.90 per day (2011 PPP) decreased from 66.3% to 0.3%, the share living with an income of less than $3.20 per day from 90.0% to 2.9%, and the share living with an income of less than $5.50 per day decreased from 98.3% to 17.0%.[312] From 1978 to 2018, the average standard of living multiplied by a factor of twenty-six.[313] Wages in China have grown significantly in the last 40 years—real (inflation-adjusted) wages grew seven-fold from 1978 to 2007.[314] Per capita incomes have also risen significantly – when the PRC was founded in 1949, per capita income in China was one-fifth of the world average; per capita incomes now equal the world average itself.[313] China's development is highly uneven. Its major cities and coastal areas are far more prosperous compared to rural and interior regions.[315] It has a high level of economic inequality,[316] which has increased quickly after the economic reforms,[317] though has decreased significantly in the 2010s.[318] In 2021, China's Gini coefficient was 0.357, according to the World Bank.[12] As of March 2024[update], China was second in the world, after the U.S., in total number of billionaires and total number of millionaires, with 473 Chinese billionaires[319] and 6.2 million millionaires.[309] In 2019, China overtook the U.S. as the home to the highest number of people who have a net personal wealth of at least $110,000, according to the global wealth report by Credit Suisse.[320][321] China had 85 female billionaires as of January 2021[update], two-thirds of the global total.[322] China has had the world's largest middle-class population since 2015;[323] the middle-class grew to 500 million by 2024.[324] China has been a member of the WTO since 2001 and is the world's largest trading power.[325] By 2016, China was the largest trading partner of 124 countries.[326] China became the world's largest trading nation in 2013 by the sum of imports and exports, as well as the world's largest commodity importer, accounting for roughly 45% of maritime's dry-bulk market.[327][328] China's foreign exchange reserves reached US$3.246 trillion as of March 2024[update], making its reserves by far the world's largest.[329] In 2022, China was amongst the world's largest recipient of inward foreign direct investment (FDI), attracting $180 billion, though most of these were speculated to be from Hong Kong.[330] In 2021, China's foreign exchange remittances were $US53 billion making it the second-largest recipient of remittances in the world.[331] China also invests abroad, with a total outward FDI of $147.9 billion in 2023,[332] and a number of major takeovers of foreign firms by Chinese companies.[333] Economists have argued that the renminbi is undervalued, due to currency intervention from the Chinese government, giving China an unfair trade advantage.[334] China has also been widely criticized for manufacturing large quantities of counterfeit goods.[335][336] The U.S. government has also alleged that China does not respect intellectual property (IP) rights and steals IP through espionage operations.[337] In 2020, Harvard University's Economic Complexity Index ranked complexity of China's exports 17th in the world, up from 24th in 2010.[338] The Chinese government has promoted the internationalization of the renminbi in order to wean itself off its dependence on the U.S. dollar as a result of perceived weaknesses of the international monetary system.[339] The renminbi is a component of the IMF's special drawing rights and the world's fourth-most traded currency as of 2023[update].[340] However, partly due to capital controls that make the renminbi fall short of being a fully convertible currency, it remains far behind the Euro, the U.S. Dollar and the Japanese Yen in international trade volumes.[341] China was a world leader in science and technology until the Ming dynasty.[342] Ancient and medieval Chinese discoveries and inventions, such as papermaking, printing, the compass, and gunpowder (the Four Great Inventions), became widespread across East Asia, the Middle East and later Europe. Chinese mathematicians were the first to use negative numbers.[343][344] By the 17th century, the Western World surpassed China in scientific and technological advancement.[345] The causes of this early modern Great Divergence continue to be debated by scholars.[346] After repeated military defeats by the European colonial powers and Imperial Japan in the 19th century, Chinese reformers began promoting modern science and technology as part of the Self-Strengthening Movement. After the Communists came to power in 1949, efforts were made to organize science and technology based on the model of the Soviet Union, in which scientific research was part of central planning.[347] After Mao's death in 1976, science and technology were promoted as one of the Four Modernizations,[348] and the Soviet-inspired academic system was gradually reformed.[349] Since the end of the Cultural Revolution, China has made significant investments in scientific research[350] and is quickly catching up with the U.S. in R&D spending.[351][352] China officially spent around 2.6% of its GDP on R&D in 2023, totaling to around $458.5 billion.[353] According to the World Intellectual Property Indicators, China received more applications than the U.S. did in 2018 and 2019 and ranked first globally in patents, utility models, trademarks, industrial designs, and creative goods exports in 2021.[354][355][356] It was ranked 11th in the Global Innovation Index in 2024, a considerable improvement from its rank of 35th in 2013.[357][358][359] Chinese supercomputers ranked among the fastest in the world.[360][u] Its efforts to develop the most advanced semiconductors and jet engines have seen delays and setbacks.[361][362] China is developing its education system with an emphasis on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).[363] Its academic publication apparatus became the world's largest publisher of scientific papers in 2016.[364][365][366] In 2022, China overtook the US in the Nature Index, which measures the share of published articles in leading scientific journals.[367][368] The Chinese space program started in 1958 with some technology transfers from the Soviet Union. However, it did not launch the nation's first satellite until 1970 with the Dong Fang Hong I, which made China the fifth country to do so independently.[369] In 2003, China became the third country in the world to independently send humans into space with Yang Liwei's spaceflight aboard Shenzhou 5. As of 2023, eighteen Chinese nationals have journeyed into space, including two women. In 2011, China launched its first space station testbed, Tiangong-1.[370] In 2013, a Chinese robotic rover Yutu successfully touched down on the lunar surface as part of the Chang'e 3 mission.[371] In 2019, China became the first country to land a probe—Chang'e 4—on the far side of the Moon.[372] In 2020, Chang'e 5 successfully returned Moon samples to the Earth, making China the third country to do so independently.[373] In 2021, China became the third country to land a spacecraft on Mars and the second one to deploy a rover (Zhurong) on Mars.[374] China completed its own modular space station, the Tiangong, in low Earth orbit on 3 November 2022.[375][376][377] On 29 November 2022, China performed its first in-orbit crew handover aboard the Tiangong.[378][379] In May 2023, China announced a plan to land humans on the Moon by 2030.[380] To that end, China has been developing a lunar-capable super-heavy launcher, the Long March 10, a new crewed spacecraft, and a crewed lunar lander.[381][382] China sent Chang'e 6 on 3 May 2024, which conducted the first lunar sample return from Apollo Basin on the far side of the Moon.[383] This is China's second lunar sample return mission, the first was achieved by Chang'e 5 from the lunar near side 4 years ago.[384] It also carried a Chinese rover called Jinchan to conduct infrared spectroscopy of lunar surface and imaged Chang'e 6 lander on lunar surface.[385] The lander-ascender-rover combination was separated with the orbiter and returner before landing on 1 June 2024, at 22:23 UTC. It landed on the Moon's surface on 1 June 2024.[386][387] The ascender was launched back to lunar orbit on 3 June 2024, at 23:38 UTC, carrying samples collected by the lander, which later completed another robotic rendezvous, before docking in lunar orbit. The sample container was then transferred to the returner, which landed on Inner Mongolia in June 2024, completing China's far side extraterrestrial sample return mission. After a decades-long infrastructural boom,[388] China has produced numerous world-leading infrastructural projects: it has the largest high-speed rail network,[389] the most supertall skyscrapers,[390] the largest power plant (the Three Gorges Dam),[391] the most extensive ultra-high-voltage transmission network and innovation infrastructure, [392][393] and a global satellite navigation system with the largest number of satellites.[394] China is the largest telecom market in the world and currently has the largest number of active cellphones of any country, with over 1.7 billion subscribers, as of February 2023[update]. It has the largest number of internet and broadband users, with over 1.09 billion Internet users as of December 2023[update][395]—equivalent to around 77.5% of its population.[396] By 2018, China had more than 1 billion 4G users, accounting for 40% of world's total.[397] China is making rapid advances in 5G—by late 2018, China had started large-scale and commercial 5G trials.[398] As of December 2023[update], China had over 810 million 5G users and 3.38 million base stations installed.[399] China Mobile, China Unicom and China Telecom, are the three large providers of mobile and internet in China. China Telecom alone served more than 145 million broadband subscribers and 300 million mobile users; China Unicom had about 300 million subscribers; and China Mobile, the largest of them all, had 925 million users, as of 2018[update].[400] Combined, the three operators had over 3.4 million 4G base-stations in China.[401] Several Chinese telecommunications companies, most notably Huawei and ZTE, have been accused of spying for the Chinese military.[402] China has developed its own satellite navigation system, dubbed BeiDou, which began offering commercial navigation services across Asia in 2012[403] as well as global services by the end of 2018.[404] Beidou followed GPS and GLONASS as the third completed global navigation satellite.[405] Since the late 1990s, China's national road network has been significantly expanded through the creation of a network of national highways and expressways. In 2022, China's highways had reached a total length of 177,000 km (110,000 mi), making it the longest highway system in the world.[406] China has the world's largest market for automobiles,[407][408] having surpassed the United States in both auto sales and production. The country is the world's largest exporter of cars by number as of 2023.[409][410] A side-effect of the rapid growth of China's road network has been a significant rise in traffic accidents.[411] In urban areas, bicycles remain a common mode of transport, despite the increasing prevalence of automobiles – as of 2023[update], there are approximately 200 million bicycles in China.[412] China's railways, which are operated by the state-owned China State Railway Group Company, are among the busiest in the world, handling a quarter of the world's rail traffic volume on only 6 percent of the world's tracks in 2006.[413] As of 2023[update], the country had 159,000 km (98,798 mi) of railways, the second-longest network in the world.[414] The railways strain to meet enormous demand particularly during the Chinese New Year holiday, when the world's largest annual human migration takes place.[415] China's high-speed rail (HSR) system started construction in the early 2000s. By the end of 2023, high speed rail in China had reached 45,000 kilometers (27,962 miles) of dedicated lines alone, making it the longest HSR network in the world.[416] Services on the Beijing–Shanghai, Beijing–Tianjin, and Chengdu–Chongqing lines reach up to 350 km/h (217 mph), making them the fastest conventional high speed railway services in the world. With an annual ridership of over 2.3 billion passengers in 2019, it is the world's busiest.[417] The network includes the Beijing–Guangzhou high-speed railway, the single longest HSR line in the world, and the Beijing–Shanghai high-speed railway, which has three of longest railroad bridges in the world.[418] The Shanghai maglev train, which reaches 431 km/h (268 mph), is the fastest commercial train service in the world.[419] Since 2000, the growth of rapid transit systems in Chinese cities has accelerated.[420] As of December 2023[update], 55 Chinese cities have urban mass transit systems in operation.[421] As of 2020[update], China boasts the five longest metro systems in the world with the networks in Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Shenzhen being the largest. The civil aviation industry in China is mostly state-dominated, with the Chinese government retaining a majority stake in the majority of Chinese airlines. The top three airlines in China, which collectively made up 71% of the market in 2018, are all state-owned. Air travel has expanded rapidly in the last decades, with the number of passengers increasing from 16.6 million in 1990 to 551.2 million in 2017.[422] China had approximately 259 airports in 2024.[423] China has over 2,000 river and seaports, about 130 of which are open to foreign shipping.[424] Of the fifty busiest container ports, 15 are located in China, of which the busiest is the Port of Shanghai, also the busiest port in the world.[425] The country's inland waterways are the world's sixth-longest, and total 27,700 km (17,212 mi).[426] Water supply and sanitation infrastructure in China is facing challenges such as rapid urbanization, as well as water scarcity, contamination, and pollution.[427] According to the Joint Monitoring Program for Water Supply and Sanitation, about 36% of the rural population in China still did not have access to improved sanitation in 2015.[428][needs update] The ongoing South–North Water Transfer Project intends to abate water shortage in the north.[429] The 2020 Chinese census recorded the population as approximately 1,411,778,724. About 17.95% were 14 years old or younger, 63.35% were between 15 and 59 years old, and 18.7% were over 60 years old.[430] Between 2010 and 2020, the average population growth rate was 0.53%.[430] Given concerns about population growth, China implemented a two-child limit during the 1970s, and, in 1979, began to advocate for an even stricter limit of one child per family. Beginning in the mid-1980s, however, given the unpopularity of the strict limits, China began to allow some major exemptions, particularly in rural areas, resulting in what was actually a \"1.5\"-child policy from the mid-1980s to 2015; ethnic minorities were also exempt from one-child limits.[431] The next major loosening of the policy was enacted in December 2013, allowing families to have two children if one parent is an only child.[432] In 2016, the one-child policy was replaced in favor of a two-child policy.[433] A three-child policy was announced on 31 May 2021, due to population aging,[433] and in July 2021, all family size limits as well as penalties for exceeding them were removed.[434] In 2023, the total fertility rate was reported to be 1.09, ranking among the lowest in the world.[435] In 2023, National Bureau of Statistics estimated that the population fell 850,000 from 2021 to 2022, the first decline since 1961.[436] According to one group of scholars, one-child limits had little effect on population growth[437] or total population size.[438] However, these scholars have been challenged.[439] The policy, along with traditional preference for boys, may have contributed to an imbalance in the sex ratio at birth.[440][441] The 2020 census found that males accounted for 51.2% of the total population.[442] However, China's sex ratio is more balanced than it was in 1953, when males accounted for 51.8% of the population.[443] The cultural preference for male children, combined with the one-child policy, led to an excess of female child orphans in China, and in the 1990s through around 2007, there was an active stream of adoptions of (mainly female) babies by American and other foreign parents.[444] However, increased restrictions by the Chinese Government slowed foreign adoptions significantly in 2007 and again in 2015.[445] China has urbanized significantly in recent decades. The percent of the country's population living in urban areas increased from 20% in 1980 to over 66% in 2023.[446][447][448] China has over 160 cities with a population of over one million,[449] including the 17 megacities as of 2021[update][450][451] (cities with a population of over 10 million) of Chongqing, Shanghai, Beijing, Chengdu, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Tianjin, Xi'an, Suzhou, Zhengzhou, Wuhan, Hangzhou, Linyi, Shijiazhuang, Dongguan, Qingdao and Changsha.[452] The total permanent population of Chongqing, Shanghai, Beijing and Chengdu is above 20 million.[453] Shanghai is China's most populous urban area[454][455] while Chongqing is its largest city proper, the only city in China with a permanent population of over 30 million.[456] The figures in the table below are from the 2020 census, and are only estimates of the urban populations within administrative city limits; a different ranking exists for total municipal populations. The large \"floating populations\" of migrant workers make conducting censuses in urban areas difficult;[457] the figures below include only long-term residents. China legally recognizes 56 distinct ethnic groups, who comprise the Zhonghua minzu. The largest of these nationalities are the Han Chinese, who constitute more than 91% of the total population.[430] The Han Chinese – the world's largest single ethnic group[461] – outnumber other ethnic groups in every place excluding Tibet, Xinjiang,[462] Linxia,[463] and autonomous prefectures like Xishuangbanna.[464] Ethnic minorities account for less than 10% of the population of China, according to the 2020 census.[430] Compared with the 2010 population census, the Han population increased by 60,378,693 persons, or 4.93%, while the population of the 55 national minorities combined increased by 11,675,179 persons, or 10.26%.[430] The 2020 census recorded a total of 845,697 foreign nationals living in mainland China.[465] There are as many as 292 living languages in China.[466] The languages most commonly spoken belong to the Sinitic branch of the Sino-Tibetan language family, which contains Mandarin (spoken by 80% of the population),[467][468] and other varieties of Chinese language: Jin, Wu, Min, Hakka, Yue, Xiang, Gan, Hui, Ping and unclassified Tuhua (Shaozhou Tuhua and Xiangnan Tuhua).[469] Languages of the Tibeto-Burman branch, including Tibetan, Qiang, Naxi and Yi, are spoken across the Tibetan and Yunnan–Guizhou Plateau. Other ethnic minority languages in southwestern China include Zhuang, Thai, Dong and Sui of the Tai-Kadai family, Miao and Yao of the Hmong–Mien family, and Wa of the Austroasiatic family. Across northeastern and northwestern China, local ethnic groups speak Altaic languages including Manchu, Mongolian and several Turkic languages: Uyghur, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Salar and Western Yugur.[470] Korean is spoken natively along the border with North Korea. Sarikoli, the language of Tajiks in western Xinjiang, is an Indo-European language.[471] Taiwanese indigenous peoples, including a small population on the mainland, speak Austronesian languages.[472] Standard Chinese, a variety based on the Beijing dialect of Mandarin, is the national language of China, having de facto official status.[2] It is used as a lingua franca between people of different linguistic backgrounds.[473] In the autonomous regions of China, other languages may also serve as a lingua franca, such as Uyghur in Xinjiang, where governmental services in Uyghur are constitutionally guaranteed.[474] Freedom of religion is guaranteed by China's constitution, although religious organizations that lack official approval can be subject to state persecution.[185] The government of the country is officially atheist. Religious affairs and issues in the country are overseen by the National Religious Affairs Administration, under the United Front Work Department.[479] Over the millennia, the Chinese civilization has been influenced by various religious movements. The \"three doctrines\" of Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism have historically shaped Chinese culture,[480][481] enriching a theological and spiritual framework of traditional religion which harks back to the early Shang and Zhou dynasty. Chinese folk religion, which is framed by the three doctrines and by other traditions,[482] consists in allegiance to the shen, who can be deities of the surrounding nature or ancestral principles of human groups, concepts of civility, culture heroes, many of whom feature in Chinese mythology and history.[483] Amongst the most popular cults of folk religion are those of the Yellow Emperor, embodiment of the God of Heaven and one of the two divine patriarchs of the Chinese people,[484][485] of Mazu (goddess of the seas),[484] Guandi (god of war and business), Caishen (god of prosperity and richness), Pangu and many others. In the early decades of the 21st century, the Chinese government has been engaged in a rehabilitation of folk cults—formally recognizing them as \"folk beliefs\" as distinguished from doctrinal religions,[486] and often reconstructing them into forms of \"highly curated\" civil religion[487]—as well as in a national and international promotion of Buddhism.[488] China is home to many of the world's tallest religious statues, representing either deities of Chinese folk religion or enlightened beings of Buddhism; the tallest of all is the Spring Temple Buddha in Henan. Statistics on religious affiliation in China are difficult to gather due to complex and varying definitions of religion and the diffusive nature of Chinese religious traditions. Scholars note that in China there is no clear boundary between the three doctrines and local folk religious practices.[480] Chinese religions or some of their currents are also definable as non-theistic and humanistic, since they do not hold that divine creativity is completely transcendent, but that it is inherent in the world and in particular in the human being.[489] According to studies published in 2023, compiling demographic analyses conducted throughout the 2010s and the early 2020s, 70% of the Chinese population believed in or practiced Chinese folk religion—among them, with an approach of non-exclusivity, 33.4% may be identified as Buddhists, 19.6% as Taoists, and 17.7% as adherents of other types of folk religion.[4] Of the remaining population, 25.2% are fully non-believers or atheists, 2.5% are adherents of Christianity, and 1.6% are adherents of Islam.[4] Chinese folk religion also comprises a variety of salvationist doctrinal organized movements which emerged since the Song dynasty.[490] There are also ethnic minorities in China who maintain their own indigenous religions, while major religions characteristic of specific ethnic groups include Tibetan Buddhism among Tibetans, Mongols and Yugurs,[491] and Islam among the Hui, Uyghur, Kazakh,[492] and Kyrgyz peoples, and other ethnicities in the northern and northwestern regions of the country. Compulsory education in China comprises primary and junior secondary school, which together last for nine years from the age of 6 and 15.[495] The Gaokao, China's national university entrance exam, is a prerequisite for entrance into most higher education institutions. Vocational education is available to students at the secondary and tertiary level.[496] More than 10 million Chinese students graduated from vocational colleges every year.[497] In 2023, about 91.8 percent of students continued their education at a three-year senior secondary school, while 60.2 percent of secondary school graduates were enrolled in higher education.[498] China has the largest education system in the world,[499] with about 291 million students and 18.92 million full-time teachers in over 498,300 schools in 2023.[500] Annual education investment went from less than US$50 billion in 2003 to more than US$817 billion in 2020.[501][502] However, there remains an inequality in education spending. In 2010, the annual education expenditure per secondary school student in Beijing totalled ¥20,023, while in Guizhou, one of the poorest provinces, it only totalled ¥3,204.[503] China's literacy rate has grown dramatically, from only 20% in 1949 and 65.5% in 1979,[504] to 97% of the population over age 15 in 2020.[505] As of 2023[update], China has over 3,074 universities, with over 47.6 million students enrolled in mainland China, giving China the largest higher education system in the world.[506][507] As of 2023[update], China had the world's highest number of top universities.[508][509] Currently, China trails only the United States and the United Kingdom in terms of representation on lists of the top 200 universities according to the 2023 Aggregate Ranking of Top Universities, a composite ranking system of three world-most followed university rankings (ARWU+QS+THE).[510] China is home to two of the highest-ranking universities (Tsinghua University and Peking University) in Asia and emerging economies, according to the Times Higher Education World University Rankings[511] and the Academic Ranking of World Universities.[512] These universities are members of the C9 League, an alliance of elite Chinese universities offering comprehensive and leading education.[513] The National Health Commission, together with its counterparts in the local commissions, oversees the health needs of the population.[514] An emphasis on public health and preventive medicine has characterized Chinese health policy since the early 1950s. The Communist Party started the Patriotic Health Campaign, which was aimed at improving sanitation and hygiene, as well as treating and preventing several diseases. Diseases such as cholera, typhoid and scarlet fever, which were previously rife in China, were nearly eradicated by the campaign.[515] After Deng Xiaoping began instituting economic reforms in 1978, the health of the Chinese public improved rapidly because of better nutrition, although many of the free public health services provided in the countryside disappeared. Healthcare in China became mostly privatized, and experienced a significant rise in quality. In 2009, the government began a three-year large-scale healthcare provision initiative worth US$124 billion.[516] By 2011, the campaign resulted in 95% of China's population having basic health insurance coverage.[517] By 2022, China had established itself as a key producer and exporter of pharmaceuticals, producing around 40 percent of active pharmaceutical ingredients in 2017.[518] As of 2023[update], the life expectancy at birth exceeds 78 years.[519]: 163 As of 2021[update], the infant mortality rate is 5 per thousand.[520] Both have improved significantly since the 1950s.[v] Rates of stunting, a condition caused by malnutrition, have declined from 33.1% in 1990 to 9.9% in 2010.[523] Despite significant improvements in health and the construction of advanced medical facilities, China has several emerging public health problems, such as respiratory illnesses caused by widespread air pollution,[524] hundreds of millions of cigarette smokers,[525] and an increase in obesity among urban youths.[526][527] In 2010, air pollution caused 1.2 million premature deaths in China.[528] Chinese mental health services are inadequate.[529] China's large population and densely populated cities have led to serious disease outbreaks, such as SARS in 2003, although this has since been largely contained.[530] The COVID-19 pandemic was first identified in Wuhan in December 2019;[531][532] pandemic led the government to enforce strict public health measures intended to completely eradicate the virus, a goal that was eventually abandoned in December 2022 after protests against the policy.[533][534] Since ancient times, Chinese culture has been heavily influenced by Confucianism. Chinese culture, in turn, has heavily influenced East Asia and Southeast Asia.[536] For much of the country's dynastic era, opportunities for social advancement could be provided by high performance in the prestigious imperial examinations, which have their origins in the Han dynasty.[537] The literary emphasis of the exams affected the general perception of cultural refinement in China, such as the belief that calligraphy, poetry and painting were higher forms of art than dancing or drama. Chinese culture has long emphasized a sense of deep history and a largely inward-looking national perspective.[538] Examinations and a culture of merit remain greatly valued in China today.[539] Today, the Chinese government has accepted numerous elements of traditional Chinese culture as being integral to Chinese society. With the rise of Chinese nationalism and the end of the Cultural Revolution, various forms of traditional Chinese art, literature, music, film, fashion and architecture have seen a vigorous revival,[541][542] and folk and variety art in particular have sparked interest nationally and even worldwide.[543] Access to foreign media remains heavily restricted.[544] Chinese architecture has developed over millennia in China and has remained a vestigial source of perennial influence on the development of East Asian architecture,[545][546][547] including in Japan, Korea, and Mongolia.[548] and minor influences on the architecture of Southeast and South Asia including the countries of Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam and the Philippines.[549][550] Chinese architecture is characterized by bilateral symmetry, use of enclosed open spaces, feng shui (e.g. directional hierarchies),[551] a horizontal emphasis, and an allusion to various cosmological, mythological or in general symbolic elements. Chinese architecture traditionally classifies structures according to type, ranging from pagodas to palaces.[552][548] Chinese architecture varies widely based on status or affiliation, such as whether the structures were constructed for emperors, commoners, or for religious purposes. Other variations in Chinese architecture are shown in vernacular styles associated with different geographic regions and different ethnic heritages, such as the stilt houses in the south, the Yaodong buildings in the northwest, the yurt buildings of nomadic people, and the Siheyuan buildings in the north.[553] Chinese literature has its roots in the Zhou dynasty's literary tradition.[554] The classical texts of China encompass a wide range of thoughts and subjects, such as the calendar, military, astrology, herbology, and geography, as well as many others.[555] Among the most significant early works are the I Ching and the Shujing, which are part of the Four Books and Five Classics. These texts were the cornerstone of the Confucian curriculum sponsored by the state throughout the dynastic periods. Inherited from the Classic of Poetry, classical Chinese poetry developed to its floruit during the Tang dynasty. Li Bai and Du Fu opened the forking ways for the poetic circles through romanticism and realism respectively. Chinese historiography began with the Shiji, the overall scope of the historiographical tradition in China is termed the Twenty-Four Histories, which set a vast stage for Chinese fictions along with Chinese mythology and folklore.[556] Pushed by a burgeoning citizen class in the Ming dynasty, Chinese classical fiction rose to a boom of the historical, town and gods and demons fictions as represented by the Four Great Classical Novels which include Water Margin, Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Journey to the West and Dream of the Red Chamber.[557] Along with the wuxia fictions of Jin Yong and Liang Yusheng,[558] it remains an enduring source of popular culture in the Chinese sphere of influence.[559] In the wake of the New Culture Movement after the end of the Qing dynasty, Chinese literature embarked on a new era with written vernacular Chinese for ordinary citizens. Hu Shih and Lu Xun were pioneers in modern literature.[560] Various literary genres, such as misty poetry, scar literature, young adult fiction and the xungen literature, which is influenced by magic realism,[561] emerged following the Cultural Revolution. Mo Yan, a xungen literature author, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2012.[562] Chinese music covers a highly diverse range of music from traditional music to modern music. Chinese music dates back before the pre-imperial times. Traditional Chinese musical instruments were traditionally grouped into eight categories known as bayin (八音). Traditional Chinese opera is a form of musical theatre in China originating thousands of years and has regional style forms such as Beijing and Cantonese opera.[563] Chinese pop (C-Pop) includes mandopop and cantopop. Chinese hip hop and Hong Kong hip hop have become popular.[564] Hanfu is the historical clothing of the Han people in China. The qipao or cheongsam is a popular Chinese female dress.[565] The hanfu movement has been popular in contemporary times and seeks to revitalize Hanfu clothing.[566] China Fashion Week is the country's only national-level fashion festival.[567] Cinema was first introduced to China in 1896 and the first Chinese film, Dingjun Mountain, was released in 1905.[568] China has the largest number of movie screens in the world since 2016;[569] China became the largest cinema market in 2020.[570][571] The top three highest-grossing films in China as of 2023[update] were The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021), Wolf Warrior 2 (2017), and Hi, Mom (2021).[572] Chinese cuisine is highly diverse, drawing on several millennia of culinary history and geographical variety, in which the most influential are known as the \"Eight Major Cuisines\", including Sichuan, Cantonese, Jiangsu, Shandong, Fujian, Hunan, Anhui, and Zhejiang cuisines.[573] Chinese cuisine is known for its breadth of cooking methods and ingredients.[574] China's staple food is rice in the northeast and south, and wheat-based breads and noodles in the north. Bean products such as tofu and soy milk remain a popular source of protein. Pork is now the most popular meat in China, accounting for about three-fourths of the country's total meat consumption.[575] There is also the vegetarian Buddhist cuisine and the pork-free Chinese Islamic cuisine. Chinese cuisine, due to the area's proximity to the ocean and milder climate, has a wide variety of seafood and vegetables. Offshoots of Chinese food, such as Hong Kong cuisine and American Chinese cuisine, have emerged in the Chinese diaspora. China has one of the oldest sporting cultures. There is evidence that archery (shèjiàn) was practiced during the Western Zhou dynasty. Swordplay (jiànshù) and cuju, a sport loosely related to association football[576] date back to China's early dynasties as well.[577] Physical fitness is widely emphasized in Chinese culture, with morning exercises such as qigong and tai chi widely practiced,[578] and commercial gyms and private fitness clubs are gaining popularity.[579] Basketball is the most popular spectator sport in China.[580] The Chinese Basketball Association and the American National Basketball Association also have a huge national following amongst the Chinese populace, with native-born and NBA-bound Chinese players and well-known national household names such as Yao Ming and Yi Jianlian being held in high esteem.[581] China's professional football league, known as Chinese Super League, is the largest football market in East Asia.[582] Other popular sports include martial arts, table tennis, badminton, swimming and snooker. China is home to a huge number of cyclists, with an estimated 470 million bicycles as of 2012[update].[583] China has the world's largest esports market.[584] Many more traditional sports, such as dragon boat racing, Mongolian-style wrestling and horse racing are also popular.[585] China has participated in the Olympic Games since 1932, although it has only participated as the PRC since 1952. China hosted the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, where its athletes received 48 gold medals – the highest number of any participating nation that year.[586] China also won the most medals at the 2012 Summer Paralympics, with 231 overall, including 95 gold.[587][588] In 2011, Shenzhen hosted the 2011 Summer Universiade. China hosted the 2013 East Asian Games in Tianjin and the 2014 Summer Youth Olympics in Nanjing, the first country to host both regular and Youth Olympics. Beijing and its nearby city Zhangjiakou collaboratively hosted the 2022 Winter Olympics, making Beijing the first dual Olympic city by holding both the Summer Olympics and the Winter Olympics.[589][590] China hosted the Asian Games in 1990 (Beijing), 2010 (Guangzhou), and 2023 (Hangzhou).[591] This article incorporates text from a free content work.

Spin: Burton won't even travel with the team to Pittsburgh, and it seems as if he's being punished for some sort of off-the-field incident. It's the third time this season that the third-round rookie will be a healthy inactive. Burton will close out the regular season having caught just four of 14 targets for 107 scoreless yards. He also returned 13 kickoffs for 378 yards. Perhaps Burton can get back on the field next week if the Bengals sneak into the playoffs. ESPN Fantasy Projection: Burton was selected in the third round of April's draft. He has the play strength to work through contact at multiple levels of the field, with the ability to separate at the third level due to his 4.45 speed. Burton is also a strong hands-catcher who can work on the boundary. He joins a highly talented (and crowded) wide receiver room in Cincinnati, where he'll be in a position to compete for the No. 3 role in the Bengals' offense. Burton has plenty of upside in dynasty formats with Tee Higgins slated to play this season on the franchise tag.",

                "content": "JERMAINE BURTON Wide receiver; Alabama What was the call like when the Bengals picked you? \"I honestly didn't know how to feel. It's truly a blessed feeling. I thank God and I'm ready to work. They made the right decision.\" When teams were talking to you throughout the pre-draft process, what did you want to prove to them the most? \"My passion comes from football, and I put in a lot of work. I have a lot of emotion that goes into this game. I express myself a lot through football. I just want to play. I don't care about anything else. Nothing else matters to me.\" T.J. Houshmandzadeh shared after making the pick that he had worked with you. Can you share a little bit about your relationship with T.J. and what you learned from him? \"It's honestly amazing having T.J. train me the past few years, even going into college. Working with him is honestly great. Just to know his history, his background with the game of football, his knowledge on it and to see the way he thinks. The way he puts it into the drills, the way he talks to you and his terminology, it really helps me. We also developed a relationship to the point where we talked about other things — just life things and a lot of maturity and growth.\" After the pick on the TV, a couple of the analysts said the talent is clearly on tape, but one of the reasons you were still available was some off-the-field maturity issues. What would you like to say to people who might question that after this pick? \"I'm Jermaine Burton and I just want to play football. I do this for my mom and sister. I have a lot of passion that comes from behind my history and what I've been through. I just want everyone to know that. I just want to play football and want to do this for my family.\" From a football standpoint, the Bengals have a hole with Tyler Boyd no longer here at slot receiver. How comfortable are you inside? Obviously, you played a lot outside as well as a downfield threat ... \"I'm actually comfortable playing both inside and outside. I'm versatile and can do a lot of great things to help the team. I just can't wait to put my talent first and go head in.\" What are your best routes? \"I love all routes. I love going deep. I enjoy playing all routes because behind every route, there's a certain knowledge. You don't run the same route the same way each and every time. There's different knowledge of each route, and I enjoy all of it.\" How would you describe your game? \"Physical, passionate, energetic — just want to win.\" How do you fit in to an offense that has Tee Higgins and Ja'Marr Chase already? \"Very well. Those guys have great skill sets and unreal talent and ability. I feel like we can all correlate with each other and really do some big things.\" How would you describe Joe Burrow, your new quarterback? \"Amazing. I have no words. I'm honestly more than blessed to have the opportunity to play with Joe, get to know him and build a relationship with him. As far as any player on the team, I just look forward to building a relationship with anyone and everyone because the more comfortable I am with the team, the more comfortable I get as a player.\" Do you think there's something unique or special about offensive football in the SEC? \"Yes, 100 percent. The SEC is a very physical conference. You have to have your head on your shoulders and come ready to play every game. It's honestly just a blessing to play with a lot of great talent and against it. There's a lot of attributes of playing in the SEC.\" How do you think you've matured in the last four years? \"Just overall. I don't think anyone is the same person or same player from the time they walk in as a freshman to their senior year. Maturing in ways as a young man. Getting to know myself more, knowledge on life. Just living life.\" Zac Taylor was noticeably excited on the broadcast after they picked you. What have your interactions been like with him and the team? \"Amazing. Each and every person I met on the team seemed great. I was excited to meet everyone. It was an honor to meet everyone, especially with him. He's definitely a light in the room and has a real energetic personality. I'm excited to get around him. I can't explain how excited I am right now.\" After those visits, did you think that you would end up in Cincinnati? \"One hundred percent. Just based off the visit — the visit was amazing. It was honestly one of my best visits I've been on. It was truly amazing. Everyone had a great vibe. I feel like I connected with everybody.\" Can you explain what happened with the Tennessee fan and is that something you've had to explain to scouts when they ask you questions about it? \"Yes. It was something I had to move past. It was a very emotional, passionate game. A lot was on the line throughout the season, and I moved on from that and learned from situations like that. We played LSU two weeks later and the same thing happened, and I was one of the first guys back in the locker room, so I clearly separated myself and understood what was at stake and didn't want to take the opportunity for granted.\" How did working with T.J. Houshmandzadeh come about in the first place? \"I came out to California to work with JT Daniels back when I was at Georgia. We came out to California and were on the field working, and they had a receiver trainer and it was T.J. From that day forward, we created a relationship and I stayed consistent with him because he was out here in California and I'm often in California. Each and every time I'm out here, I pull up on him every day or every other day and continue to work with him.\" Are there receivers you study or even try to play like? \"Yes, I watch a lot of receivers. I like to work out stuff on my own so I can improve areas I want to improve, whether it's running routes and disciplining routes. But yes, I 100 percent do, especially with zone coverage defenses. I like to see receivers work up to their zones.\" You worked with T.J., he announced your pick, you're coming to his former team. Does this all seem like karma or something? \"That's honestly kind of crazy if you think about it. I just look at it as a blessed moment. I'm embracing it all in. I can't wait to continue to work with T.J. Overall, it's just a blessing. I'm just happy to be here.\" How well did you get to know Amarius Mims during your time at Georgia? Have you stayed in contact? \"Yeah, we had a couple visits together. I was at the Chargers with him, and we actually had our Bengals visit together. So, I was around him a little bit more. I wasn't around him as much at Georgia because he had just came in. But yeah, we connected. Just a lot of joking about the process and how crazy it is that we are in this moment. I'm happy for him, as well.\" © 2025 The Cincinnati Bengals. All rights reserved",

His personal best time of 43.64 seconds makes him the tenth fastest man in history over 400 metres.[3] During the pandemic, Kerley chose to focus on the 100 m during the Olympic cycle to improve his basic speed for future attempts at a sub-43 400 m. The decision to move down paid off as he won the silver medal in the 100 m at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics with a 9.84 performance. His personal best time of 9.76 seconds makes him the sixth fastest man in history over the straightaway sprint, behind Usain Bolt, Yohan Blake, Tyson Gay, Asafa Powell and Justin Gatlin and joint with Christian Coleman and Trayvon Bromell. Kerley is one of only three men along with Michael Norman and Wayde van Niekerk to go sub-10 seconds in 100 m, sub-20 seconds in 200 m and sub-44 seconds in 400 m. Kerley attended Taylor High School and his youth team was the College Station Sprinters in College Station, Texas. Afterwards he attended South Plains College from 2013 to 2015 before transferring to Texas A&M. In 2016, Fred Kerley tried out for the Olympic team at the USA Olympic Trials.[4] He did not qualify out of his heat, but he went on to represent the United States at the NACAC Under-23 Championships where he anchored the 4 × 100 meters relay team to gold.[5] In March 2017, he won the 400 m at the NCAA Division I Championships in a world leading time of 44.85 s, one of the top ten fastest indoor times ever. He joined his younger brother Mylik Kerley as he anchored the Aggies to a come from behind victory in the 4 × 400 m relay. The two first place finishes contributed 20 points to the team, helping bring Texas A&M to their first ever team victory at the NCAA Track and Field Championships, run on their home track. In May, Kerley ran 44.09 s, just 0.09 s off the NCAA record, while easing to the finish line at the Southeastern Conference (SEC) Championships in Columbia, South Carolina.[6] A few weeks later Kerley set the NCAA record in the men's 400 m at the 2017 NCAA West Preliminary with a time of 43.70 s, taking three-tenths of a second off the 44.00 record by Olympic champion Quincy Watts, set almost 25 years earlier.[7][8] Kerley had met Watts just before the race.[9] He concluded his amateur career to win the 400 m and 4 × 400 m relay at the 2017 NCAA Division I Championships in June. A few weeks after turning professional and signing with Nike, Kerley won the 400 m at the USATF Championships in 44.03 seconds, qualifying to represent the United States in both the 400 m and the 4 × 400 m relay at the World Championships in Athletics. After winning his heat he finished third in his semi, but qualified for the final on time.[10] In the final he was unable to replicate his form from earlier in the season, finishing seventh in a time of 45.23 s. He came back a day later to help the US qualify for the finals in the relay, and then a few days later earned a silver medal behind Trinidad and Tobago. Training under Kevin Tyler with widely-renowned club ALTIS in Phoenix, Arizona,[11] Kerley finished 3rd in the 400m at the 2018 US Indoor Championships, failing to qualify for the individual 400m at the upcoming World Indoor Championships but making it onto the 4 × 400 m relay team. There, he helped the team to a silver medal finish. Outdoors, Kerley ran several races across the international circuit, including a win in the 400m at the Rome Diamond League. However, none of his times came close to his 43.70 personal best. Despite suffering an injury in June, Kerley bounced back in August to win at the Birmingham Diamond League, before winning the Diamond League trophy in the men's 400 meters in Zurich.[12] After the season, he returned to Texas A&M to train under Francique, stating to Track & Field News \"I believe in him so much that I had to come back to train with him.\"[1] Kerley was selected to compete for the US in the 4x400m relay at the 2019 IAAF World Relays, but the team was disqualified in the preliminaries. Kerley took wins at the Shanghai Diamond League and the Racers Grand Prix in Kingston, Jamaica, and finished third at the Stanford Diamond League. A month later, Kerley won the US title in a new personal best time of 43.64 seconds, making him the 7th fastest man on the all-time rankings at the time. At the World Championships in Doha, Kerley won the bronze medal in the individual event and helped the US to a gold in the relay. After the COVID-19 pandemic erased the 2020 season and delayed the 2020 Summer Olympics by a year, Kerley kicked off his 2021 season with several 100m races in order to work on his speed for the longer sprint; he broke the historic 10-second barrier at the TRUfit Classic in Miami on April 24, winning in 9.91 s with a maximum allowable wind velocity for record purposes (+2.0 m/s).[13] On May 19 he won the men's 100 m in 9.96 s at the Golden Spike in Ostrava, finishing ahead of former Olympic and World champion Justin Gatlin who settled for second in 10.08 s. Kerley also ran in the 200 m where he placed second with a time of 20.27 s, trailing Kenny Bednarek from the start who won in 19.93 s. According to Reuters, Kerley was satisfied with his performances, but thought there was more work to do in his 200 m and his focus for the Olympic Trials would be 400 m.[14] However, after 400m races in Doha and Hengelo caused his ankle to swell due to the turns, he decided to focus on the 100m and 200m at the Trials. Kerley also stated that the popularity of the 100m was another factor in his switch. Despite online backlash for his decision, Kerley silenced doubters by finishing third in the 100m at the Trials, qualifying for his first Olympic team. In the 200m, Kerley struggled throughout the rounds due to the turns and their impact on his ankles, and he narrowly qualified for the final on time. However, he managed to finish an impressive fourth with his first sub-20 performance; this made him the 3rd athlete to join the \"Sub 10s, 20s, 44s club for the 100m, 200m & 400m sprints\", behind 400m World Record holder Wayde van Niekerk & Michael Norman.[15] Prior to the U.S. Championships, Kerley competed in three Diamond Leagues: Doha, where he placed second in the 200m; the Prefontaine Classic, where he placed second in the 100m; and at the Rome Golden Gala, where he won the 100m. At the 2022 USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships, Kerley won the 100m in 9.77 seconds and placed third in the 200m in 19.83 seconds. Kerley ran 9.76 seconds, a personal best, in the semi-final.[16] While competing in the 2022 World Athletics Championships, Kerley won his maiden individual World Championship gold medal in the 100m.[17] In the final, Kerley pipped compatriot Marvin Bracy on the line with a time of 9.86 seconds winning the world title in the process. Fellow American Trayvon Bromell finished third, completing a clean sweep.[18] He was knocked out of the 200m in the semi-final. Kerley enjoyed a strong start to his 2023 season, taking home wins in the Doha, Rabat, and Florence Diamond Leagues.[19] At the 2023 USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships, Kerley contested only the 200m as he received a bye to the 2023 World Championships as the 2022 World Champion in the 100m. He placed fourth in the final of the 200m to Erriyon Knighton, Kenny Bednarek, and Courtney Lindsey. Later in July, he placed second in the Silesia Diamond League 100m. Kerley failed to advance from his semi-final of the 100m at the 2023 World Athletics Championships. However, he earned gold as a member of the United States 4x100m relay team. Soon after his third place finish in the Xiamen Diamond League 100m, in September 2023, Kerley announced that he was no longer coached by Alleyne Francique and would be coached by Quincy Watts, the Director of Track and Field at the University of Southern California.[20] In September 2024, it was announced that he had signed up for the inaugural season of the Michael Johnson founded Grand Slam Track.[21][22] Information from World Athletics profile unless otherwise noted.[23] The two highlighted times are track records (accurate as of September 2024). Kerley's older cousin is former NFL wide receiver Jeremy Kerley.[39] Kerley has a Christian faith and regularly attended church after practice.[40] In 2024, Kerley was involved with an altercation with police in which he was tased for resisting arrest.

                "content": "Watch CBS News By Allen Cone Updated on: January 3, 2025 / 10:02 PM EST / CBS Miami MIAMI BEACH - A track medalist in the 2020 and 2024 Summer Olympics was arrested in Miami Beach after a physical confrontation with four officers Thursday night, according to police. Fred Kerley, 29, of Southwest Miami-Dade County, exchanged words with officers, a physical struggle ensued, and he was wrestled to the ground and subdued with a stun gun, police said. The agency released bodycam video of the incident. CBS News Miami has edited the video to take out profanity. On Friday, police added a probable cause arrest of robbery/strongarm and domestic battery on May 7, 2024, stemming from a physical confrontation with a woman he was married for three years and knew for 10 years. They reside together with three children in common. Police say they were not able to locate him then. He already was facing charges of battery of a police officer and resisting an officer without violence. During his first appearance on Friday afternoon, Circuit Judge Mindy Glazer didn't find probable cause for a charge of disorderly conduct/breach of the peace and he was allowed to be released from jail on his own recognizance. His attorney, Richard L. Cooper said Kerley will be released Saturday. \"These new charges are stemming from a falsified accusation that has resurfaced because of this new media attention from last nights wrongful arrest,\" the attorney said. \"I can say that Mr. Kerley is a record-breaking athlete who has honorably and successfully represented our nation in the Olympics many times. These charges are false and indicate the brutal police state that Miami Beach has become.\" In a follow-up statement provided to CBS News, Cooper wrote that, \"It is clear from all available recordings of the arrest (including police worn body camera) that the police overreacted to an otherwise peaceful interaction with Mr Kerley.\" Kerley's girlfriend, Cleo Rahman, 32, a national DJ known as Dj Sky High Baby, also is facing a charge of resisting an officer without violence charge because \"her actions took several officers to divert their attention from assisting the officers to deal with her,\" according to the arrest report. Florida's Halo Law, effective on Wednesday, establishes a 25-foot buffer zone around first responders to protect them during active duties and violations are classified as second-degree misdemeanors. Rahman, a Burbank, Calif., resident, used her cellphone to record what happened \"What are you doing,\" she said in the video. \"He is team USA.\" Rahman told CBS Miami: \"He was not aggressive. This does not give police the right to be push him and be aggressive for no reason. He's an athlete. He is team USA. It is not like he is playing for another team. He is here. This was so unfortunate. I want to go back home to Los Angeles. I have never been arrested before or been in trouble.\" Police dispute her comments. \"Mr. Kerley battered one of our officers and pushed him in the chest, at which point the officers put their hands on him and tasered him,\" Officer Christopher Bess told CBS News Miami. \"The message is very clear that when you see officers engaged in a scene give them some distance.\" At 11:22 p.m., Miami Beach officers were involved in an investigation on the 100 block of Ninth Street. According to the arrest report: \"Officers subsequently were approached by a black Male, wearing a gray hoodie, and black pants with an aggressive demeanor who was concerned about his vehicle that was parked in the area of the scene.\" Kerley argued with the officers and his girlfriend, who attempted to pull him away from officers to calm the situation, police said. Despite officers' efforts to de-escalate the situation, he stepped up to an officer. One officer \"delivered multiple hammer fists\" toward Kerley's head and elbows, according to the police report. \"Stop resisting!\" one officer said to Kerley as he laid on the ground, according to bodycam footage. \"I'm not resisting, get off of me, bro,\" Kerley replied. One of the officers used a dart-firing stun gun, striking Kerley in the right lower back and he fell on his stomach, police said. \"The defendant's action disrupted the flow of pedestrian traffic and caused a crowd on the nearest sidewalk,\" according to the police report. \"The defendant's actions also endangered the safety of the staff and establishment patrons of the nearby restaurant and Ocean Drive.\" He was taken to Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami and then to Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center. \"This could have been prevented,\" Bess said. \"Our officers tried multiple times to de-escalate but Mr. Kerley kept rushing our officers.\" The president of the Fraternal Order of Police in Miami criticized the judge for allowing him to be released from jail. \"I am very disappointed that Judge Mindy Glazer did not look at our officer's body worn cameras before she acted more like a defense attorney at the bond hearing than an unbiased judge,.\" Bobby Hernandez said. \"She must have also not been aware that as she was sympathizing with him and his defense attorney that this 'model citizen' was wanted for domestic violence involving strangulation and robbery. Defendant Fred Kerly (spelling) had an opportunity to comply, and he decided to violently resist. Bad decisions lead to bad consequences.\" In the 2020 Olympics, which took place in 2021 in Tokyo, Kerley finished second in the 100 meters. In the 2024 Olympics in Paris, he was third, running the 100 in 9.81 seconds, just behind fellow American Noah Lyles and Jamaica's Kishane Thompson in a photo finish. Kerley was born in San Antonio and ran track at Texas A&M. He won the 400 meters at the NCAA Division I Championships in a world-leading time 44.85 seconds. © 2025 CBS Broadcasting Inc.

                "title": "Olympic Runner Fred Kerley Arrested, Tased in Confrontation With Police - Newsweek",
                "content": "Fred Kerley, a Team USA Olympic sprinter, was arrested on Thursday in Miami Beach, Florida, after a confrontation with police officers led to him being tased. Newsweek has reached out to Miami Beach Police Department (MBPD) and Kerley's representatives at Pace Sports Management for comment Friday afternoon via email. Kerley, 29, is an Olympic medal-winning athlete, originally from Texas, who took home bronze and silver medals in 2021 and 2024. He was also the 2022 100-meter world champion and has won multiple other races. The athlete's competitive career goes back to 2017 and he has starred in the Netflix docuseries Sprint in 2024. Kerley's arrest came as officers with the MBPD investigated an incident in the 100 block of 9th Street late Thursday night. According to local media, he approached officers and expressed concern about his vehicle, which was parked nearby. According to the MBPD, Kerley became \"increasingly aggressive\" and officers asked him to leave the area, but he refused and took a \"fighting stance.\" Police then tried to tackle him to the ground. The incident was captured on police body-worn cameras, seen by NBC 6 News, which showed the Olympian being pulled to his feet by cops before they led him away. A woman, thought to be his girlfriend, was heard asking officers to stop. \"He's an athlete, please do not mess with him,\" she can be heard on the video before an officer then said they would tase him. In a statement, the MBPD said that when officers tried to arrest Kerley \"he actively resisted their efforts. Consequently, emergency back-up was requested, a dart-firing stun gun was effectively deployed, and the defendant was arrested without any further incident.\" Meanwhile, Cleo Rahman, Kerley's girlfriend, who is a DJ known as Dj Sky High Baby, was also detained for allegedly resisting arrest. She later posted to Instagram saying, \"police brutality on black men got to stop!!\" An arrest record for Kerley, with Miami-Dade County Corrections seen by Newsweek, showed he was charged with battery, resisting an officer without violence, and disorderly conduct. Two other charges were listed against his name for robbery/strongarm and battery, but it was not clear whether those were related. Kerley's attorney in court on Friday: \"This seems like a total misunderstanding. Mr. Kerley is a record-breaking athlete. He has served in the Olympics for the United States track and field (team). He is a model citizen in our community. This is nothing more than an overreaction by the police.\" Miami-Dade Judge Mindy Glazer in court to a police sergeant on Friday: \"I don't know if the officers in Miami Beach are busy handling a lot of complicated crime scenes there, but I have a gentleman who's never been arrested, there's no prior arrests, who his attorney's saying has competed in the Olympics, who is obviously a professional athlete and it's unfortunate that he got to this position.\" Kerley was released from jail following his first hearing after Glazer did not find probable cause for a charge of disorderly conduct/breach of the police. He was released on his own recognizance, per records seen by Newsweek. Dan Gooding is a Newsweek reporter based in New York City. His focus is reporting on immigration and border security.

                "content": "Olympic track and field star Fred Kerley was arrested in Florida late Thursday after a confrontation with police. Body-worn camera footage released by the Miami Beach Police Department on Friday shows Kerley, the reigning Olympic bronze medalist in the men's 100-meter dash, exchanging words with a group of officers before being wrestled to the ground and struck repeatedly. One of the officers then subdued Kerley with a stun gun, colloquially known as a Taser, before he was placed into handcuffs. Kerley was booked into jail early Friday morning on charges of battery upon a law enforcement officer, which is a third-degree felony, as well as resisting an officer and disorderly conduct, which are misdemeanors. He was released Friday afternoon after making his initial appearance in court. When asked about Kerley's arrest and the altercation that proceeded it, one of Kerley's attorneys, Yale Sanford, referred to the body-worn camera footage released by police, which he described as \"obscene.\" \"It just goes to show you that no matter how hard you work, or how many medals you earn for your country, in Miami Beach last night, my client was treated like millions of African-Americans around the country — with a lack of humanity, compassion and respect,\" Sanford, who is working alongside Richard L. Cooper to represent Kerley, told USA TODAY Sports. Miami Beach police spokesperson Christopher Bess said the incident, like all use-of-force incidents, was undergoing a standard review but that the officers \"responded to the resistance appropriately and professionally.\" The altercation between Kerley and police took place in a commercial area of southern Miami Beach, a few blocks from the water. In a written police report, officers described Kerley as having an \"aggressive demeanor\" when he approached the perimeter of an unrelated police scene, apparently on the way to his car, which was parked nearby. Police allege that Kerley \"attempted to force his way through\" two officers despite their requests that he circumvent the area. One officer then raised his left hand and made contact with Kerley, who brushed it aside. In the altercation that followed, police wrote in their report that four officers attempted to place Kerley into custody while he used \"evasive movements to avoid being arrested.\" One of the officers then \"delivered multiple hammer fists\" towards Kerley's head and upper back in continued attempts to subdue him, according to the police report. A separate video, shared on social media by a witness, shows an officer striking Kerley on the side of his torso. One of the officers then unholstered his stun gun, which made contact with Kerley's back and sent him to the ground, where police proceeded to place him in handcuffs. \"Stop resisting!\" one of the officers said to Kerley as he lay on the ground, according to the footage. \"I'm not resisting, get off of me, bro,\" Kerley replied, before repeatedly and profanely calling the officers \"weak.\" A small crowd gathered near the scene, according to the body-worn camera footage, with many of the onlookers holding up their phones. Cleo Rahman, who was accompanying Kerley and is identified in the police report as his girlfriend, is also heard screaming \"stop!\" repeatedly during and after the encounter. \"He didn't do anything!\" she told officers at one point. \"We were walking to our car! Our car is right there!\" According to online court records, Rahman was also arrested for resisting an officer without violence, which is a misdemeanor. Hours after Kerley was booked into jail, another Florida police department filed separate charges against the sprinter stemming from an alleged domestic incident in May. According to the police report in that case, Kerley and the victim − who is not named but identified by police as his wife of three years − got into an argument at their house in Miami on May 7. The victim told police that Kerley took her cell phone, then \"pushed her to the ground, encircled his arm around her neck and impeded her breathing\" before leaving the scene. She said he later returned the phone but was not at the house when police arrived. Miami-Dade County police charged Kerley with robbery and domestic battery, but a spokesperson said they had not been able to locate and arrest him until he was arrested in the Miami Beach case late Thursday night. Kerley's attorney said he was expected to appear before a judge in the domestic case Saturday. \"These new charges are stemming from a falsified accusation that has resurfaced because of this new media attention from last night's wrongful arrest,\" Cooper said in a statement. A USA Track & Field spokesperson declined comment on Kerley's arrest but said the organization was not aware of the domestic battery charge prior to his participation in the 2024 Paris Olympics last summer. Kerley has emerged in recent years as one of top sprinters in the world and one of the best-known track and field athletes on Team USA. After switching from his initial event, the 400 meters, he won a surprising silver medal in the men's 100-meter dash at the 2021 Tokyo Olympics. The former Texas A&M sprinter then followed it up with a world championship in the event in 2022, and another Olympic medal (bronze) at the Paris Games last summer. He has also competed internationally in the 200-meter dash and 4x100 meter relay. Contact Tom Schad at tschad@usatoday.com or on social media @tomschad.bsky.social.",

                "title": "Charlie Morton (pitcher) - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Charles Alfred Morton IV[1] (born November 12, 1983) is an American professional baseball pitcher for the Baltimore Orioles of Major League Baseball (MLB). He has played in MLB for the Atlanta Braves, Pittsburgh Pirates, Philadelphia Phillies, Houston Astros, and Tampa Bay Rays. The Braves selected Morton in the third round of the 2002 MLB draft and he made his MLB debut with them in 2008. Morton was a World Series champion in 2017 and 2021 and an All-Star in 2018 and 2019. Morton is the active pitcher with the most career batters hit by pitch with 180. Morton was born in Flemington, New Jersey, to Jeanne and Chip Morton, an accountant and former Penn State basketball player. His grandfather played in the Philadelphia Athletics farm system.[2] He was raised in Trumbull, Connecticut, playing little league baseball with future major leaguers pitcher Craig Breslow and infielder Jamie D'Antona.[3] Morton grew up attending ballgames at Yankee Stadium and idolizing Derek Jeter and Roger Clemens.[4] He attended Joel Barlow High School in Redding, Connecticut, graduating in 2002. The Atlanta Braves selected Morton in the third round with the 95th overall selection of the 2002 Major League Baseball draft. He started his professional career in 2002 with the GCL Braves, and was 1–7. In 2003, he played for the Danville Braves, and was 2–5. He spent the 2004 and 2005 seasons with the Rome Braves. In 2006, he pitched for the Myrtle Beach Pelicans, and was 6–7. In 2007, he pitched for the Mississippi Braves, and was 4–6.[5] The Braves added Morton to their 40-man roster on November 20, 2007.[6] Morton made his major league debut on June 14, 2008, against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, allowing three runs in six innings and earning his first major league win.[7][8] In 2008 he was 4–8 with a 6.15 ERA.[5] On June 3, 2009, the Braves traded Morton with Gorkys Hernández and Jeff Locke to the Pittsburgh Pirates in exchange for Nate McLouth.[9] He made his first start with the Pirates on June 10 pitching an inning against the Atlanta Braves, while Jeff Karstens got the win. On June 28, he received his first decision, a loss to the Kansas City Royals. On July 3, 2009, he won his first game pitching 6 innings of 1 hit baseball against the Florida Marlins. On September 30, 2009, he pitched a complete game 4 hitter with 8 strikeouts against the Chicago Cubs. His 2009 record in 18 starts was 5 wins and 9 losses, a 4.55 ERA, 97 innings pitched and 62 strikeouts, 40 walks, 7 home runs, 5 hit batsmen, .276 average against, and a 1.46 WHIP.[5] Morton began 2010 spring training as a member of the Pirates' starting rotation. He struggled losing all five starts in April and finishing the month with a 12.57 earned run average (ERA). However, Morton delivered a promising performance on April 30, 2010, against the Los Angeles Dodgers, striking out 8 in six innings of work while allowing six runs (only three earned). In that game, he was dealt a loss as the Pirates only provided him with two runs of support. He earned his first win of the season on May 5 against the Chicago Cubs striking out three in a 4–2 decision. However, he lost each of his next four starts, dropping his record on the season to 1–9 with a 9.35 ERA. A day after suffering his 9th loss against the Cincinnati Reds, the Pirates placed him on the 15-day disabled list with shoulder fatigue. After recovering, he was assigned to the Pirates Triple-A affiliate Indianapolis Indians. Speaking before his first start with the Indians, Morton said \"I was pressing. I wasn't being myself on the mound those last couple of times I went out there in Pittsburgh. There was so much going on in my mind. At the end of last year, I finished strong, I got a glimpse of what I could do, truly, in the big leagues, going out there and going deep into games, being competitive, and being someone who was pretty good. I wanted to be out there for myself and because I care about this team and organization. At the same time, though, after that last one, that last start, because I care about these guys is why, exactly, I knew I couldn't go back out there again.\"[10] Morton was recalled when starter Ross Ohlendorf was placed on the 15-day disabled list due to a shoulder injury. On his final start of the 2010 season, Morton compiled his finest pitching performance of the year striking out a career-high nine batters in a 2–0 loss to the Florida Marlins on October 2. He finished the season with a 2–12 record and a 7.57 ERA, but in his final six starts of the season after being recalled in late August he sported a 4.26 ERA. 2011 was Morton's best season yet, where he held a 10–10 record in 29 starts with a 3.83 ERA, earning the club's Breakout Player of the Year.[11] On April 15, Morton threw a complete game against the Cincinnati Reds. On May 18, again at Great American Ball Park, Morton threw a complete game shutout, striking out 5 and giving up 5 hits.[12] Following the season, Morton underwent successful hip surgery to repair a torn labrum in October 2011 with a full recovery expected in 4–6 months. He was optimistic about returning before Opening Day.[13] However, he began the 2012 season on the disabled list, making his season debut on April 14. His season ended when he underwent Tommy John surgery on June 14, 2012.[14] On June 13, 2013, Morton was activated off the DL. He picked up his first win of the season on June 18 in a shutout against the Cincinnati Reds. He pitched 5+1⁄3 innings giving up only 3 hits and no runs, while striking out 2. On July 22 and 27, he won back-to-back games for the first time since May 7 and 18, 2011. On December 11, 2013, Morton signed a three-year contract to remain with the Pirates, with a club option for the 2017 season.[15] Morton was placed on the DL with right hip inflammation on August 17, 2014. At the time, he was 5–12 with a 3.84 ERA.[16] During September, Morton needed hip surgery, effectively ending his 2014 season. In 26 starts in 2014, Morton hit 19 batsmen with pitches, which led the Majors along with a 6–12 record and a 3.72 ERA. During the 2015 spring training, Morton struggled thoroughly and began to experience inflammation in his recently surgically repaired hip. On April 5, 2015, the Pirates placed Morton on the 15-day disabled list. On December 12, 2015, the Pirates traded Morton to the Philadelphia Phillies in exchange for David Whitehead.[17] His season came to an abrupt end on April 23, 2016, when Morton suffered a hamstring injury running to first base in a game against the Milwaukee Brewers and was placed on the disabled list the next day.[18] On April 27, the Phillies announced Morton would miss the rest of the 2016 season with a torn hamstring.[19] On November 16, 2016, Morton signed a two-year, $14 million contract with the Houston Astros.[20] During the 2017 regular season, Morton made 25 starts, compiling a 14–7 record with a 3.62 ERA. He pitched 146+2⁄3 innings and recorded 163 strikeouts. Morton started Game 3 of the American League Championship Series (ALCS) at Yankee Stadium. He lost the game, giving up 7 runs in 3+2⁄3 innings.[21] On October 21, he won Game 7 of the ALCS at Minute Maid Park, pitching five shutout innings with five strikeouts, sending the Astros to the World Series.[22] Morton started Game 4 of the World Series and pitched well over 6.1 innings giving up one earned run on 3 hits and 7 strikeouts in an eventual Astros loss. Morton pitched the final four innings in Game 7 of the World Series. He was credited as the winning pitcher helping the Astros win their first World Series title.[23] Three years later, it was revealed in the Houston Astros sign stealing scandal that the team had broken MLB rules during the 2017 season. Morton admitted he knew about the team's cheating and expressed regret that he did not do anything to stop it.[24] In 2018, Morton continued his successful stint with the Astros. On May 12, he set a personal record of 14 strikeouts over seven innings in a 6–1 victory against the Texas Rangers.[25] Entering the All-Star break third in the American League with 11 wins, 11.7 strikeouts per nine innings, and ninth in ERA (2.96), Morton was added to the AL roster for the 2018 MLB All-Star Game.[26] Morton avoided serious injury in 2018, with only a short trip to the 10-day DL for shoulder discomfort. He pitched 167 innings, second only to his 2011 high of 171.2. Morton finished the regular season with a 3.13 ERA, a 15–3 win–loss record, and 201 strikeouts, all constituting career highs.[27] On December 21, 2018, the Tampa Bay Rays signed Morton to a two-year, $30 million contract.[28] He made his debut as a Ray against the Astros on March 29, 2019, pitching five innings and earning the win. On June 30, he was awarded his second consecutive All-Star appearance.[29] In 2019, he led all major league pitchers in home runs/9 innings pitched, at 0.694.[30] He set career highs in wins (16), ERA (3.05), innings (194+2⁄3) and strikeouts (240). He finished in third place for the Cy Young Award.[31] Morton started the American League Wild Card Game against the Oakland Athletics, receiving a win in five innings of work.[32] This was Morton's third career win in winner-take-all playoff games, the most in MLB playoff history.[32] On August 10, 2020, Morton was placed on the injured list with inflammation in his right shoulder.[33] Morton finished the 2020 year with an ERA of 4.74 over 38 innings.[34] Morton pitched in game 7 of the American League Championship Series against his former team the Houston Astros. He recorded his fourth win in a winner-take-all playoff game, extending his record.[35] On October 30, 2020, the Rays declined their $15 million team option on his contract for the 2021 season, and he was declared a free agent. At the time the Rays made their decision, it was reported that they were looking for a \"creative\" way to re-sign Morton as a free agent for the following year.[36] On November 24, 2020, the Atlanta Braves signed Morton to a one-year, $15 million contract.[37][38] On September 6, 2021, Morton and the Braves agreed to a one-year extension worth $20 million.[39][40] In the 2021 regular season, he was 14–6 with a 3.34 ERA in 33 starts.[41] On October 26, 2021, during Game 1 of the World Series versus the Houston Astros, Morton left the game after pitching only 2+1⁄3 innings with what was revealed to be a right fibula fracture. The injury occurred in the previous inning when Astros batter Yuli Gurriel hit a ball directly into Morton's leg. Initially believing he was unharmed, Morton continued to pitch, completing 16 more pitches—including a strikeout of former MVP Jose Altuve—before removing himself from the game.[42][43][44] Morton did not play for the remainder of the series. The Braves later won the World Series, giving the Braves their first title since 1995 and Morton his second World Series ring.[45] On September 30, 2022, Morton and the Braves agreed to a one-year contract extension for the 2023 season worth $20 million.[46][47] Morton recorded at least 200 strikeouts in consecutive seasons with the team, and became the third Atlanta Braves pitcher to have struck out 200 or more batters in multiple seasons.[48] In 2022, he was 9–6 with a 4.34 ERA, as in 31 starts he pitched 172 innings, and threw curveballs 38% of the time, more than any other pitcher in major league baseball.[49][50] The active career leader in hit batsmen with 156, he hit 18 batters, second in the NL.[49] During the 2023 season, Morton pitched to a 3.64 ERA and a 14–12 record.[51] The Braves picked up the option year on his contract, worth $20 million.[52] On June 28, 2024, Morton became the 22nd pitcher in MLB history to record a win against all 30 teams, following a scoreless outing against the Pittsburgh Pirates.[53] On August 13, 2024, Morton became the 89th pitcher in MLB history to reach the 2,000 strikeout mark when he struck out Mike Yastrzemski in the bottom of the sixth inning against the San Francisco Giants.[54] In 2024, Morton pitched to a 4.01 ERA and a 8-10 record with 167 strikeouts. On January 3, 2025, Morton signed a one-year, $15 million contract with the Baltimore Orioles.[55] Morton's repertoire consisted in 2013 of a four-seam fastball, a sinker, a curveball, and a split-finger fastball with his speed maxing out in the low 90s.[56] Morton picked up the splitter in 2011 having previously thrown a changeup. He also has previously thrown a slider and a cutter.[57] Morton's sinker was his most common pitch, especially against right-handed hitters. His curveball was his most common pitch in a two strike count.[58] Due to changes in his delivery and the emphasis he has placed on the sinker, Morton drew comparisons to Roy Halladay.[59] Pirates special assistant Jim Benedict had previously encouraged Morton to emulate Halladay's delivery during spring training. Morton featured his new sinker almost exclusively in his first starts of the 2011 season and it resulted in an increased groundball rate but also more bases on balls. Pirates' fans christened him with the nickname \"Ground Chuck.\"[60][61][62] In the 2015 offseason, a frustrated Morton began experimenting with throwing harder, alongside adjustments to his technique and workouts.[63] In his injury-abbreviated starts with the Phillies, he showcased his newfound velocity. Along with high spin rates, this attracted the attention of Houston's front office which signed him and encouraged Morton to continue throwing hard four-seam fastballs, as Morton felt his sinker was becoming ineffective.[64] While playing for the Astros, Morton transformed into a strikeout pitcher finding new effectiveness against left-handed hitters.[65] With Houston his primary pitches were a four-seam fastball reaching 98-99 MPH and a curveball with considerable vertical and horizontal movement, which Morton considers his best pitch.[66] In 2018, his improvements on his curveball was attributed to his low three-quarters position, but slightly above sidearm at release.[67] Morton and his wife, Cindy, have four children.[68] They reside in Bradenton, Florida.[69]",

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Ageless right-hander Charlie Morton isn't done yet. Weeks after suggesting he hopes to pitch again in 2025, the 41-year-old Morton has agreed to terms with the Baltimore Orioles on a one-year free-agent contract. The club made the announcement on Friday. According to MLB.com, the deal will be worth $15 million. This past season for the Atlanta Braves, Morton registered a 4.19 ERA (99 ERA+) and a 4.46 FIP in 30 starts. Across his 165 ⅓ innings, Morton struck out 167 batters and walked 64 unintentionally. This marked the sixth straight full season -- i.e., excluding the heavily abbreviated 2020 campaign -- in which Morton has logged a qualifying number of innings and made at least 30 starts. Earlier in the offseason, CBS Sports ranked Morton as the No. 29 available free agent in the current class. Here's part of our write-up: He's made 30-plus appearances four years running, all the while posting an average or better ERA and strikeout-to-walk ratio for a starting pitcher. Despite Morton's advanced age and mileage, he continues to adapt and adjust. His curveball remains the king of its domain, but he's made a point of reducing his four-seamer usage; additionally, he's all but mothballed his once-signature sinker, bumping it to his fourth-most used pitch behind a changeup. Morton has been as flexible as any non-elite pitcher in recent memory; that helps to explain why he's in position to pitch beyond his 41st birthday. The 2025 season will be Morton's 18th in MLB. Over his 17 seasons to date, he's put up an ERA+ of 101 with a career WAR of 17.3. He goes into 2025 with 138 career wins in 382 starts. Morton has two All-Star selections to his credit, and in 2019 he finished third in the American League Cy Young voting as a member of the Rays. In Baltimore, Morton joins a rotation that also includes recent addition Tomoyuki Sugano out of Japan. As well, the Orioles in 2025 will get their first full season from 2024 deadline acquisition Zach Eflin. However, they'll be doing without ace Corbin Burnes, who recently signed a $210 million pact with the Diamondbacks. The Orioles are coming off a 2024 season in which they went 91-71 and made a second straight trip to the postseason. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

                "content": "Defunct Newspapers Journals TV channels Websites Other Economics Gun rights Identity politics Nativist Religion Watchdog groups Youth/student groups Miscellaneous Other Clarence Thomas (born June 23, 1948) is an American lawyer and jurist who has served since 1991 as an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. President George H. W. Bush nominated him to succeed Thurgood Marshall. After Marshall, Thomas is the second African American to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court and has been its longest-serving member since Anthony Kennedy's retirement in 2018. He has also been the Court's oldest member since Stephen Breyer retired in 2022. Thomas was born in Pin Point, Georgia. After his father abandoned the family, he was raised by his grandfather in a poor Gullah community near Savannah, Georgia. Growing up as a devout Catholic, Thomas originally intended to be a priest in the Catholic Church, but he was frustrated by what he saw as the church's insufficient attempts to combat racism. He abandoned his aspiration of becoming a clergyman and graduated from the College of the Holy Cross and Yale Law School, where he was influenced by a number of conservative authors, especially Thomas Sowell. Upon graduating, he was appointed as an assistant attorney general in Missouri and later entered private practice there. He became a legislative assistant to U.S. Senator John Danforth in 1979, and was made Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights at the U.S. Department of Education in 1981. President Ronald Reagan appointed Thomas as Chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) the next year. President George H. W. Bush nominated Thomas to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in 1990. He served in that role for 19 months before filling Marshall's seat on the Supreme Court. Thomas's confirmation hearings were bitter and intensely fought, centering on an accusation that he had sexually harassed Anita Hill, a subordinate at the Department of Education and the EEOC.[5] The Senate confirmed Thomas by a vote of 52–48, the narrowest margin in a century.[6] Since the death of Antonin Scalia, Thomas has been the Court's foremost originalist, stressing the original meaning in interpreting the U.S. Constitution.[7] In contrast to Scalia—who had been the only other consistent originalist—he pursues a more classically liberal variety of originalism.[8] Until 2020, Thomas was known for his silence during most oral arguments,[9] though has since begun asking more questions to counsel.[10] He is notable for his majority opinions in Good News Club v. Milford Central School (determining the freedom of religious speech in relation to the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution) and New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen (affirming the individual right to bear arms outside the home), as well as his dissent in Gonzales v. Raich (arguing that the U.S. Congress may not criminalize the private cultivation of medical cannabis). He is widely considered to be the Court's most conservative member. Thomas was born on June 23, 1948, in his parents' wooden shack in Pin Point, Georgia.[11][12] Pin Point was a small community near Savannah founded by freedmen in the 1880s.[13] He was the second of three children of M.C. Thomas, a farm worker, and Leola Williams.[11] Williams had been born out of wedlock; after her mother's death, she was sent from Liberty County, Georgia, to live with an aunt in Pin Point.[14][15][16] The family were descendants of enslaved people and spoke Gullah as a first language.[17] Thomas's earliest known ancestors were slaves named Sandy and Peggy, who were born in the late 18th century and owned by wealthy planter Josiah Wilson of Liberty County.[18] Thomas's older sister, Emma, was born in 1946, and his younger brother, Myers, in 1949.[19] Upon becoming pregnant with Thomas's older sister, Leola was expelled from her Baptist church and dropped out of high school after the 10th grade; her father ordered her to marry M.C. in January 1947. After three years of marriage, M.C. sued for divorce, claiming that Leola neglected the children, and a judge granted the request in March 1951.[19] After the divorce, M.C. moved to Savannah and later Pennsylvania, visiting his children only once. Leola went to work as a maid in Savannah during the week and returned to Pin Point on the weekends. Custody of the children was awarded to Leola's aunt.[20][21] When her aunt's house burned down in 1955, Leola took her children to live with her in the room she rented in a tenement with an outdoor toilet in Savannah, leaving her daughter with the aunt in Pin Point. She asked her father, Myers Anderson, for help. He initially refused but agreed after his wife threatened to throw him out.[22][23] Thomas and his brother went to live with Anderson, his maternal grandfather, in 1955 and experienced amenities such as indoor plumbing and regular meals for the first time.[24] Despite having little formal education, Anderson had built a successful business delivering coal, oil, and ice.[22] When racial unrest led to widespread protest and marches in Savannah from 1960 to 1963, Anderson used his wealth to bail out demonstrators and took his grandchildren to meetings promoted by the NAACP.[25] Thomas has described his grandfather as the person who has influenced his life the most.[26] Anderson converted to Catholicism and sent Thomas to be educated at a series of Catholic schools. Thomas attended the predominantly black St. Pius X High School in Chatham County[27] for two years before transferring to St. John Vianney's Minor Seminary on the Isle of Hope, where he was the segregated boarding school's first black student.[28][29] Though he experienced hazing, he performed well academically.[15] He spent many hours at the Carnegie Library, the only library for Blacks in Savannah before libraries were desegregated in 1961.[30][31][a] When Thomas was ten years old, Anderson began putting his grandsons to work during the summers, helping him build a house on a plot of farmland he owned, building fences, and doing farm work.[33] He believed in hard work and self-reliance,[34] never showed his grandsons affection,[33] beat them frequently according to Leola, and impressed the importance of a good education on them.[35] Anderson taught Thomas that \"all of our rights as human beings came from God, not man\", and that racial segregation was a violation of divine law.[36] During his freshman year from 1967 to 1968, Thomas attended Conception Seminary College, a Benedictine seminary in Missouri, with the intent to become a priest; no one in Thomas's family had attended college before.[37][28] After Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination, he overheard a fellow student say, \"Good. I hope the son of a bitch dies\" and \"[t]hat's what they should do to all the niggers\".[38][39][40] The display of racism moved Thomas to leave the seminary.[41] He thought the church did not do enough to combat racism and resolved to abandon the priesthood.[42][38] He left at the end of the semester.[38] At a nun's suggestion, Thomas enrolled at the College of the Holy Cross, an elite Catholic college in Massachusetts, as a sophomore transfer student on a full academic scholarship.[43][44] He was one of the college's first black students, being one of twenty recruited by President John E. Brooks in 1968 in a group that also included the future attorney Ted Wells, the running back Eddie Jenkins Jr., and the novelist Edward P. Jones.[45] In the fall of that year, Thomas and other black students founded the college's Black Student Union (BSU), which became an important part of their campus identity.[46] Without financial support from his grandfather, he defrayed his expenses by working as a waiter and dishwasher in the college's dining hall.[47] Thomas later recalled, \"I was 19. My only hope was Holy Cross College\".[48] Professors at Holy Cross remembered Thomas as a determined, diligent student.[49] He kept to a strict routine of studying alone and stayed back during holidays to continue working.[50] Thomas C. Lawler, an English professor at Holy Cross,[51] recalled him as having \"never talked very much in class. He was the kind of person you really might not notice\".[49] By contrast, he was outspoken at BSU meetings, distinguishing himself as a contrarian who often feuded with Ted Wells. The future running back Ed Jenkins, a BSU member, said Thomas \"could turn on a dime and reduce you to intellectual rubble\".[52][53] Edward P. Jones, who lived across from Thomas as a sophomore, reflected that \"there was a fierce determination I sensed from him [Thomas], that he was going to get as much as he could and get as far, ultimately, as he could\".[54] Thomas became a vocal student activist as an undergraduate. He became acquainted with black separatism, the black Muslim Movement, the black power movement, and displayed a poster of Malcolm X in his dormitory room.[56] When some black students were disproportionately punished in comparison with white students for the same violation, he suggested a walkout in protest. The BSU adopted his idea, and Thomas, along with sixty other black students, departed campus.[57][58] Some of the priests negotiated with the protesting black students to reenter the school.[28] When administrators granted amnesty to all protesters, Thomas returned to the college, later also to attend anti-war marches. In April 1970, he participated in the violent 1970 Harvard Square riots.[59] He has credited his protests for his turn toward conservatism and subsequent disillusionment with leftist movements.[60][61][54] Having struggled with English as a native speaker of Gullah, Thomas chose to major in English literature.[62][63] He became a member of Alpha Sigma Nu, the Jesuit honor society, and the Purple Key Society, of which he was the only black member.[64] The college's focus on a liberal arts education introduced him to the writings of black intellectuals such as Richard Wright, whose literary works Thomas sympathized with.[56] His admiration of Malcolm X led him to read The Autobiography of Malcolm X to the point of wearing down the pages of his copy.[65] Thomas graduated from Holy Cross on June 4, 1971, with a Bachelor of Arts, cum laude, ranked ninth in his class.[66] He applied to and was accepted by Yale Law School, Harvard Law School, and the University of Pennsylvania Law School.[67][68] That same year, Thomas matriculated at Yale Law School as one of twelve black students.[69] Yale offered him the best financial aid package, and he was attracted to the civil rights activism of some of its faculty members.[70][71] Finding it difficult to keep up with the school's expectations, he struggled to connect with other students who came from upper-class backgrounds. He enrolled in Yale's most difficult courses and became a student of the property law scholar Quintin Johnstone, who became his favorite professor.[72][73] Johnstone remembered Thomas as having \"performed very well\".[74] Guido Calabresi, the dean of Yale Law School, described Thomas and fellow student Hillary Clinton as \"both excellent students [who] had the same kind of reputation\".[74] Thomas obtained his Juris Doctor on May 20, 1974.[75] After graduation, he sought to enter private practice as a corporate lawyer in Atlanta, Georgia.[76] He saw his experience in law school as disappointing, as law firms assumed he was accepted because of affirmative action.[77] According to Thomas, the law firms also \"asked pointed questions, unsubtly suggesting that they doubted I was as smart as my grades indicated\".[78] In his 2007 memoir, he wrote: \"I peeled a fifteen-cent sticker off a package of cigars and stuck it on the frame of my law degree to remind myself of the mistake I'd made by going to Yale. I never did change my mind about its value.\"[79] Hill, Jones, and Farrington, the Savannah law firm where Thomas had interned the previous summer, offered him a job upon graduation, but he declined.[80][81] With no job offers from major law firms, Thomas took a position as an associate with Missouri attorney general John Danforth, who offered him the prospect of practicing what he liked.[82] Thomas moved to Saint Louis to study for the Missouri bar, and was admitted on September 13, 1974.[83] He remained financially destitute even after leaving Yale, trying unsuccessfully on one occasion to make money by selling his blood at a blood bank, and hoped that by working for Danforth he might later acquire a job in private practice.[84][85] From 1974 to 1977, Thomas was an assistant attorney general of Missouri—the only African-American member of Danforth's staff. He worked first in the office's criminal appeals division and later in the revenue and taxation division. Thomas conducted lawsuits independently, gaining a reputation as a fair but controversial prosecutor.[86] Years later, after he joined the Supreme Court, Thomas recalled his position in Missouri as \"the best job I've ever had\".[87] When Danforth was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1976, Thomas left to become an attorney in Monsanto's legal department in Saint Louis.[88] He found the job unsatisfying, so left to rejoin Danforth in Washington, D.C., as a legislative assistant.[89] From 1979 to 1981, he handled energy issues for the Senate Commerce Committee. Thomas, who had switched his party affiliation from Democratic to Republican while working for Danforth in Missouri,[90] soon drew the attention of officials in the newly elected Reagan Administration as a black conservative.[90][91] Pendleton James, Reagan's personnel director, offered Thomas the position of assistant secretary for civil rights at the U.S. Department of Education. Initially reluctant, Thomas agreed after Danforth and others pressed him to take the post.[92] President Ronald Reagan nominated Thomas as assistant secretary of education for the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) on May 1, 1981.[93][94] The Senate received the nomination on May 28, 1981, and Thomas was quickly confirmed before the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee on June 19, succeeding Cynthia Brown at the age of 32.[95][96] He held the position for a brief period before James offered him a new position as chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), a promotion that Thomas believed, as with his position in the OCR, was because of his race.[97] After James consulted the President, Thomas hesitantly took up the chair with Reagan's approval.[98] Thomas chaired the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) from 1982 to 1990. As chairman, he was tasked with enforcing the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in an agency that had been mutually resented by both Democrats and Republicans. He announced a reorganization of the EEOC and upgraded its record-keeping under an uncompromising leadership that eschewed racial quotas.[97][99] Concerned by the EEOC's limited statutory authority, Thomas sought to impose criminal penalties for employers who practiced employment discrimination, moving to shift funding towards agency investigators. Though he had been critical of affirmative action, Thomas also opposed the Reagan Administration's agenda to remove affirmative action policies, believing it to be a detraction from socioeconomic issues.[100][90] During Thomas's tenure, he was credited with improving the efficiency of the EEOC.[101] Settlement award amounts to victims of discrimination tripled, while the number of suits filed decreased. The EEOC's lack of the use of goals and timetables drew criticism from civil rights advocates, who lobbied representatives to review the EEOC's practices; Thomas testified before Congress more than 50 times. Near the end of his final term, the EEOC came under congressional scrutiny for the mishandling of age-discrimination cases.[102][103] In early 1989, President George H. W. Bush expressed interest in nominating Thomas to a federal judgeship. Thomas, now at age 41, initially rejected the position, believing himself unready to make a lifetime commitment to being a judge. White House Counsel C. Boyden Gray and White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu advocated for his nomination, and Judge Laurence Silberman advised Thomas to accept an appointment.[104] Anticipating Thomas's nomination, a liberal coalition—including the Alliance for Justice and the National Organization for Women (NOW)—emerged to oppose his candidacy.[105] On October 30, 1989, President George H. W. Bush nominated Thomas to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to fill the seat vacated by Robert Bork.[106][107] Thomas gained the support of other African American officials, including former transportation secretary William Coleman, and said that when meeting white Democratic staffers in the United States Senate, he was \"struck by how easy it had become for sanctimonious whites to accuse a black man of not caring about civil rights\".[65] In February 1990, the Senate Judiciary Committee recommended Thomas by a vote of 12 to 1. On March 6, 1990, the Senate confirmed him to the Court of Appeals by a vote of 98 to 2.[105] He developed cordial relationships during his 19 months on the federal court, including with Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg.[65] During his judgeship, Thomas authored 19 opinions.[108] When Justice William Brennan retired from the Supreme Court in July 1990, Thomas was Bush's favorite among the five candidates on his shortlist for the position. However, Bush's advisors, including Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, considered Thomas inexperienced,[111] and he instead nominated David Souter of the First Circuit Court of Appeals.[65] A year later, Justice Thurgood Marshall announced his retirement on June 27, 1991, and Bush nominated Thomas to replace him.[112][113] Bush announced his selection on July 1, calling Thomas the \"best qualified at this time\".[65] Thornburgh cautioned Bush that replacing Marshall with any candidate who was not perceived to share Marshall's views would make confirmation difficult.[114] Liberal interest groups sought to challenge Thomas's nomination by paralleling the same strategy used against Robert Bork's confirmation.[115] Abortion-rights groups, including the National Abortion Rights Action League and the NOW, were concerned that Thomas would be among those to overrule Roe v. Wade.[116] Republican officials in turn emphasized his personal history and gathered support from African American interest groups, including the NAACP.[117] Other civil rights organizations, such as the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and the National Urban League, were convinced not to oppose Thomas, believing that he was Bush's last black nominee. On July 31, 1991, the board of directors of the NAACP voted against endorsing Thomas, announcing their opposition to his confirmation the same day.[118] The American Bar Association (ABA) appraised Thomas as \"qualified\" for the Supreme Court.[119][b] The result came in contrast to the \"well qualified\" rating some nominees had received previously.[121][122] The Bush Administration anticipated that the organization would rate Thomas more poorly than it thought he deserved, so pressured the ABA for at least the mid-level qualified rating while simultaneously discrediting it as partisan.[123] Opponents of Thomas's nomination saw the assessment as indicating that he was unfit for the Court.[124] The ABA gave Thomas its highest rankings in integrity and judicial temperament and a middle-grade in professional competence.[125] On September 10, 1991, formal confirmation hearings began before the Senate Judiciary Committee.[126][127] Thomas testified for 25 hours, the second-longest of any Supreme Court nominee.[128] He was reticent when answering senators' questions, recalling what had happened to Robert Bork when Bork expounded on his judicial philosophy during his confirmation hearings four years earlier.[129] As many of his earlier writings frequently referenced natural law, his views on the legal theory became a focus of the hearings. Thomas said he regarded natural law as a \"philosophical background\" to the Constitution.[130][131][132] Ninety witnesses testified in favor of or against Thomas.[133][citation needed] A motion on September 27, 1991, to give the nomination a favorable recommendation failed 7–7, and the Judiciary Committee voted 13–1 to send it to the full Senate without recommendation.[134][135][136] At the conclusion of the committee's confirmation hearings, the Senate was debating whether to give final approval to Thomas's nomination. An FBI interview with Anita Hill, a former colleague of Thomas at the EEOC, was soon leaked to the press and allegations of sexual harassment followed.[137][138] As a result, on October 8, the final vote was postponed, and the confirmation hearings were reopened. It was only the third time in the Senate's history that such an action was taken and the first since 1925, when Justice Harlan F. Stone's nomination was recommitted to the Judiciary Committee.[136] Hill was raised in Oklahoma and, like Thomas, graduated from Yale Law School.[139] She told James Brudney, a fellow Yale alumnus, about alleged sexual advances Thomas had made, telling him that she also did not wish to testify or make the allegations public to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Hill requested to the staff of Senator Joe Biden, the chair of the committee, that her allegations be made anonymously if she chose to testify and that Thomas not be informed of them, which Biden declined. Hill then notified Democratic staffers the day after the hearings had ended that she wished to make her allegations known to the committee.[140] Hill's allegations were corroborated by Susan Hoerchner, a judge in California, who also wished to remain anonymous.[141][142] Hoerchner called Harriet Grant, a chief counsel to Biden, to inform him of her allegations. She recalled that Thomas told Hill in an elevator at the EEOC that he would ruin her career if she spoke about his behavior.[143] When Grant told Hill and Hoerchner that the FBI would be involved, they were reluctant to be investigated. Hill declined to speak with the FBI, as she feared it would misconstrue her words, so instead arranged to deliver a written statement. The statement described how Thomas pressured her to date him, and included descriptions of him speaking about sexual interests involving pornographic films.[144] Hill also alleged that Thomas spoke of sex at work despite her being uncomfortable with the subject, adding, \"I sensed that my discomfort with his discussions only urged him on, as though my reaction of feeling ill at ease and vulnerable was what he wanted\".[145] The FBI report of its investigation was not made public. The White House announced that the FBI had found the allegations \"without foundation\". Congressional officials who had seen the report told the New York Times that \"the bureau could not draw any conclusion because of the 'he said, she said' nature of the subject\".[146][147] The use of the FBI was contentious in the Judiciary Committee because it answers to the president, who was sponsoring Thomas. Biden used the FBI instead of the committee's investigators to avoid the appearance of partisanship.[148] The hearings reconvened on October 11, 1991, with Thomas going first. In his opening statement, he denied that he had said or done anything to Hill \"that could have been mistaken for sexual harassment\". He told the Committee that he would not allow any questions about \"what goes on in the most intimate parts of my private life or the sanctity of my bedroom\" so as not to \"provide the rope for my own lynching\".[149] The committee then questioned Hill for seven hours. She testified that ten years earlier Thomas had subjected her to comments of a sexual nature, calling it \"behavior that is unbefitting an individual who will be a member of the Court\".[150][151][152] Her testimony included graphic details, and some senators questioned her aggressively.[153][154] Hill accused Thomas of making two sexually offensive remarks to her: comparing his penis to that of Long Dong Silver, a black porn star, and saying he had discovered a pubic hair on his Coca-Cola can.[155][156] And from my standpoint as a black American, as far as I'm concerned, [this proceeding] is a high-tech lynching for uppity blacks that in any way deign to think for themselves, to do for themselves, to have different ideas, and it is a message that unless you kowtow to the old order, this is what will happen to you. You will be lynched, destroyed, caricatured by a committee of the United States Senate rather than hung from a tree. In the evening, Thomas was recalled before the committee. He again denied the allegations and was prompted by Senator Orrin Hatch's questioning to launch a speech that criticized the proceeding as a \"high-tech lynching for uppity blacks\".[158] The speech resonated with Southern blacks and stimulated Thomas's supporters,[159] with public opinion shifting in his favor afterward.[160][161] Hill was the only person to publicly testify that Thomas had sexually harassed her.[162] Angela Wright, who worked under Thomas at the EEOC and had alleged that \"Thomas had continually pressured her to date him and made sexual comments about women's bodies\",[163][164] and a corroborating witness she had named were not called to testify.[163] Their written depositions were entered into the congressional records unrebutted.[165][166][167] Sukari Hardnett, a former Thomas assistant, wrote to the Senate committee that although Thomas had not harassed her, \"If you were young, black, female and reasonably attractive, you knew full well you were being inspected and auditioned as a female.\"[168][169] In addition to Hill and Thomas, the committee heard other witnesses.[136] A former colleague, Nancy Altman, testified that for two years she had shared an office with Thomas at the Department of Education and \"heard virtually every conversation\" Thomas had and never heard him make a sexist or offensive comment.[170][non-primary sources needed] On October 13, Hill voluntarily took and passed a polygraph test, which her lawyer took as proof that she had been truthful about the harassment claims, even if the test was not admissible as evidence in court. Danforth's office then issued a statement saying that persons suffering from a delusional disorder might pass a lie detector test.[171][172][173][174] After the confirmation hearings ended, they became a focus of divided scholarship, with authors who revisited them reaching varying conclusions in favor of either Thomas or Hill.[161] On October 15, 1991, the Senate voted to confirm Thomas as an associate justice, 52–48.[136] Thomas received the votes of 41 Republicans and 11 Democrats, while 46 Democrats and two Republicans voted to reject his nomination.[175] As of 2024[update], Thomas is the most recent Supreme Court justice to be confirmed by a Senate controlled by the opposing party of the appointing president. The 99 days during which Thomas's nomination was pending in the Senate was the second-longest of the 16 nominees receiving a final vote since 1975, second only to Bork's 108 days.[136] The vote to confirm Thomas was the narrowest margin for approval in more than 100 years.[176] Thomas received his commission on October 23 and took the prescribed constitutional and judicial oaths of office, becoming the Court's 106th justice.[177][c] He was sworn in by Justice Byron White in a ceremony initially scheduled for October 21, which was postponed because of the death of Chief Justice William Rehnquist's wife, Natalie.[179][180][181] His first set of law clerks included future judges Gregory Katsas and Gregory Maggs and U.S. Ambassador Christopher Landau.[182][183] After joining the Supreme Court, Thomas emerged as a member of the Court's conservative wing.[184] He aligned himself with Justice Antonin Scalia, with whom he shared an originalist approach to constitutional interpretation, and sided with him in 92 percent of cases during his first 13 years on the bench.[d] Over time, Thomas and Scalia's jurisprudence separated,[e] with Thomas favoring stronger emphasis on the Constitution's original understanding and demonstrating greater willingness to overrule precedent.[192] His appointment represented a decline in the Court's liberal wing, which then comprised only Justices John Paul Stevens and Harry Blackmun.[193][194] In his early days on the Court, Thomas adopted a bold style of legal jurisprudence that alienated him from Justices Blackmun and Sandra Day O'Connor. He became the subject of intense media criticism for his decisions, including from figures that supported his appointment. Having previously experienced scrutiny during his confirmation hearings, Thomas believed in producing results without regard for his public image, a characteristic embodied in his lack of questions during oral arguments. His conservative approach moved O'Connor to take liberal positions but attracted Scalia. He formed a friendship with Justice Byron White, with whom he shared multiple interests, and found support from Justice David Souter.[195][196] Thomas is a proponent of original meaning, incorporating what had been Scalia's narrower approach to the doctrine and the original intent of the Framers of the Constitution, including those espoused in the Declaration of Independence. As a means to impartiality, he is an advocate of judicial restraint to limit judicial discretion.[197][f] Thomas has been the most-willing of all justices on the Court to overrule precedent; according to Scalia, \"he does not believe in stare decisis, period\".[200][201][g] By October 1, 2012, he had written 475 opinions, including 171 majority opinions, 138 concurrences, and 166 dissenting opinions—approximately 10 percent of the 1,772 cases the Court had decided since he was elevated.[203] In 2016, Thomas wrote nearly twice as many opinions as any other justice.[9] Thomas has been called the most conservative member of the Supreme Court,[196][204][205] though others gave Scalia that designation while they served on the Court together.[206][207] Thomas's influence, particularly among conservatives, was perceived to have significantly increased during Donald Trump's presidency,[208][209] and Trump appointed many of his former clerks to political positions and judgeships.[210][211][212] As the Supreme Court became more conservative, Thomas and his legal views became more influential on the Court.[213][214][215] This influence increased further by 2022, with Thomas authoring an opinion expanding Second Amendment rights and contributing to the Court's overruling of Roe v. Wade. He was also the most senior associate justice by that time.[216][217][218] Thomas believes the Court should not follow erroneous precedent, a view not currently held by other justices.[219] He has called to reconsider New York Times Co. v. Sullivan (1964), and criticized Roe v. Wade (1973) and Gideon v. Wainwright (1963). At a 2013 Federalist Society dinner, Judge Diane S. Sykes asked Thomas whether \"stare decisis doesn't hold much force for you?\" He responded, \"Oh, it sure does, but not enough to keep me from going to the Constitution\".[220][221] In 2019, The New York Times reported that data gathered by political scientist Stephen L. Wasby of the University at Albany found that Thomas wrote \"more than 250 concurring or dissenting opinions seriously questioning precedents, calling for their reconsideration or suggesting that they be overruled\".[220] In the 2010 gun regulation case McDonald v. City of Chicago, Thomas sought to repeal past precedents and insisted that \"stare decisis is only an 'adjunct' of our duty as judges to decide by our best lights what the Constitution means\".[222] In Gamble v. United States (2019), he joined the majority opinion, which revisited an exception to the Double Jeopardy Clause, writing separately to state his position against the Court's prevailing view of multi-factor analysis regarding whether to follow precedent:[223] In my view, if the Court encounters a decision that is demonstrably erroneous—i.e., one that is not a permissible interpretation of the text—the Court should correct the error, regardless of whether other factors support overruling the precedent. Federal courts may (but need not) adhere to an incorrect decision as precedent, but only when traditional tools of legal interpretation show that the earlier decision adopted a textually permissible interpretation of the law. A demonstrably incorrect judicial decision, by contrast, is tantamount to making law, and adhering to it both disregards the supremacy of the Constitution and perpetuates a usurpation of the legislative power.[224] In Franchise Tax Board of California v. Hyatt (2019),[h] Thomas wrote the 5–4 decision overruling Nevada v. Hall (1979), which said states could be sued in courts of other states. In his majority opinion, he noted that stare decisis \"is not an inexorable command\". Thomas explicitly disavowed the concept of reliance interests as justification for adhering to precedent. In dissent from Hyatt III, Justice Breyer asked what other decisions might eventually be overruled, and suggested Roe v. Wade might be among them. Breyer stated that it is best to leave precedents alone unless they are widely seen as erroneous or become impractical.[225] Thomas has supported a broad interpretation of executive power and has theorized about its constitutional aspects.[9] In Hamdi v. Rumsfeld (2004),[i] he dissented from the majority opinion, arguing that courts should have had complete deference to the executive decision to determine that Yaser Esam Hamdi was an enemy combatant.[226] He wrote in Hamdi that the president does not have the singular authority to detain a citizen who was captured while in enemy service.[227] In addition, Thomas noted that \"structural advantages [of the Presidency] are most important in the national-security and foreign-affairs contexts\" and thus \"the Founders intended that the President have primary responsibility—along with the necessary power—to protect the national security and to conduct the nation's foreign relations\".[228] Thomas was one of three justices to dissent in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld (2006),[j] which concerned whether the president can establish military tribunals to try detained enemy combatants for war crimes conspiracy. As in Hamdi, he relied on The Federalist Papers in proposing that the president is responsible for protecting national security.[229][230] In Zivotofsky v. Kerry (2015), Thomas relied on the Articles of Confederation for his opinion. He wrote, \"the President is not confined to those powers expressly identified in [the Constitution]\", concluding that residual foreign affairs were vested in the president, not Congress.[231] Rather than finding the original intent or original understanding, Thomas wrote in the case that he sought the \"understanding of executive power [that] prevailed in America\" at the time of the founding.[232] In the Ninth Circuit case East Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Trump (2018), which placed an injunction on the Trump administration's asylum policy, Thomas dissented from a denial of stay application. The Ninth Circuit imposed an injunction on the Trump administration's policy granting asylum only to refugees entering from a designated port of entry, ruling that it violated the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. Ninth Circuit Judge Jay Bybee's majority opinion concluded that denial of the ability to apply for asylum regardless of entry point is \"the hollowest of rights that an alien must be allowed to apply for asylum regardless of whether she arrived through a port of entry if another rule makes her categorically ineligible for asylum based on precisely that fact.\" Gorsuch, Alito, Kavanaugh also dissented in the decision to deny a stay to the Ninth Circuit's injunction.[233][234] Thomas views federalism as a foundational limit on federal power.[235] In interpreting congressional powers, he has defended strict constructionism—an approach Scalia rejected.[236] On September 24, 1999, Thomas delivered the Dwight D. Opperman Lecture at Drake University Law School on \"Why Federalism Matters\", saying that it was an essential safeguard to protect \"individual liberty and the private ordering of our lives\". He also asserted that federalism enhances self-government, protects individual liberty by separating political power, and checks federal authority.[237] According to law professor Ann Althouse, the Court has yet to move toward \"the broader, more principled version of federalism propounded by Justice Thomas\".[238] Nothing in the Constitution deprives the people of each State of the power to prescribe eligibility requirements for the candidates who seek to represent them in Congress. The Constitution is simply silent on this question. And where the Constitution is silent, it raises no bar to action by the States or the people. — Thomas, dissenting in U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton (1995)[239][235] In the 1995 case U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton,[k] parties challenged the constitutionality of an amendment to the Arkansas Constitution that added age, citizenship, and residency requirements for congressional service. In a 5–4 decision, the Supreme Court ruled the amendment unconstitutional, also affirming the previous rulings of both the state's trial court and the Arkansas Supreme Court; Justice Stevens wrote for the majority. Thomas—joined by Justices Rehnquist, O'Connor, and Scalia—dissented in what is to date his lengthiest opinion.[240] He argued that states could impose term limits on members of Congress, as state citizens are \"the ultimate source of the Constitution's authority\".[241] That same year, Thomas concurred in United States v. Lopez, which invalidated the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990 for going beyond the Commerce Clause. He opined that the Court had deviated \"from the original understanding of the Commerce Clause\" and that the substantial effects test, \"if taken to its logical extreme, would give Congress a 'police power' over all aspects of American life\".[242] Thomas dissented in Gonzales v. Raich (2005), which held that the Controlled Substances Act applies to homegrown marijuana, on the grounds of original meaning.[243] His interpretation of the interstate commerce clause differed from Scalia's, and they also held conflicting beliefs about the general welfare clause, the Indian commerce clause, and the necessary and proper clause. Scalia joined the majority opinion, but Thomas disputed the relevance of homegrown marijuana to interstate commerce, writing that if Congress can regulate it, \"it can regulate virtually anything—and the Federal Government is no longer one of limited and enumerated powers\".[244][245] In United States v. Comstock (2010),[l] the Supreme Court, in a majority opinion by Justice Stephen Breyer, held that the Necessary and Proper Clause allows Congress to enact a law that authorized the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) to detain a mentally ill and dangerous federal prisoner beyond the DOJ's original lawful date. Thomas's dissent, joined by Scalia, argued that the clause allows Congress only to execute enumerated powers.[246] When the Court upheld the Affordable Care Act in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius (2012), he authored a short dissent and joined the joint dissent finding the act completely unconstitutional.[247] As of 2007, Thomas was the justice most willing to exercise judicial review of federal statutes but among the least likely to overturn state statutes.[248] According to a New York Times editorial, \"from 1994 to 2005 ... Justice Thomas voted to overturn federal laws in 34 cases and Justice Scalia in 31, compared with just 15 for Justice Stephen Breyer\".[249] In Northwest Austin Municipal Utility District No. 1 v. Holder, Thomas was the sole dissenter, voting to throw out Section Five of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. Section Five requires states with a history of racial voter discrimination—mostly states from the old South—to gain Justice Department clearance when revising election procedures. Congress had reauthorized Section Five in 2006 for another 25 years, but Thomas said the law was no longer necessary, stating that the rate of black voting in seven Section Five states was higher than the national average. He wrote, \"the violence, intimidation and subterfuge that led Congress to pass Section 5 and this court to uphold it no longer remains.\"[250] He took this position again in Shelby County v. Holder, voting with the majority and concurring with the reasoning that struck down Section Five.[251] Thomas has generally written opinions in favor of protections for free speech.[252][253] He has voted in favor of First Amendment claims in cases involving issues including campaign contributions and commercial speech.[254] A 2002 study by Eugene Volokh found Thomas to be the justice second-most likely to uphold free speech claims (tied with Souter).[255] He has ruled against laws regulating hate speech, as in R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul (1992), United States v. Stevens (2010), and Snyder v. Phelps (2011).[256] Conversely, he has been reluctant to uphold speech deemed intimidating, as in Virginia v. Black (2003).[257][258] Thomas's first opinion on free speech was the 1995 case McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Commission,[m] finding that the Founding Era contained the expansive use of anonymous pamphlets and columns. Although he agreed with the result of Justice John Paul Stevens's majority opinion, he disagreed with its methodology and did not join it.[259] With the announcement of McIntyre, the Court also decided Rubin v. Coors Brewing Company, in which Thomas wrote his first majority opinion concerning free speech. In Rubin, Thomas was joined unanimously in ruling unconstitutional a 1935 federal law that prohibited beer labels from disclosing alcohol content. He similarly concurred the next year in 44 Liquormart v. Rhode Island, which struck down a state law that banned the advertisement of prices of alcoholic beverages.[260] In Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee v. FEC (1996), the Supreme Court ruled against the decision of the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to fine the Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee for running a political advertisement targeting Senator Tim Wirth. Thomas joined Justice Stephen Breyer's majority opinion in the case, but wrote separately to call against the framework established in the previous campaign finance case of Buckley v Valeo (1976): I believe that contribution limits infringe as directly and as seriously upon freedom of political expression and association as do expenditure limits. The protections of the First Amendment do not depend upon so fine a line as that between spending money to support a candidate or group and giving money to the candidate or group to spend for the same purpose. In principle, people and groups give money to candidates and other groups for the same reason that they spend money in support of those candidates and groups: because they share social, economic, and political beliefs and seek to have those beliefs affect governmental policy.[261] Thomas has made public his belief that all limits on federal campaign contributions are unconstitutional and should be struck down.[262] In Citizens United v. FEC (2010), Thomas joined the majority but dissented in part, arguing that the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act's disclaimer and disclosure requirements were unconstitutional. He reinforced his defense of anonymous speech in Doe v. Reed (2010), writing that the First Amendment protects \"political association\" by means of signing a petition.[263] In Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District (1969), Justice Hugo Black dissented from the Court's opinion invalidating a school's policy to forbid students from wearing armbands in protest of the Vietnam War. Thomas endorsed Black's dissent in Morse v. Frederick (2007), concurring with narrowing the rationale of Tinker and arguing that Tinker be overruled as it was a constitutionally unsupported \"sea change in students’ speech rights\".[264] In his view, the Constitution does not govern whether public school students may be disciplined for expressive behavior.[265] In Mahanoy Area School District v. B.L.—in which a high school punished a student for sending a profane message on social media about her school, softball team, and cheer team—Thomas was the lone dissenter, siding with the school. He criticized the majority for relying on \"vague considerations\" and wrote that historically schools could discipline students in similar situations.[266] In Walker v. Texas Division, Sons of Confederate Veterans, he joined the majority opinion that Texas's decision to deny a request for a Confederate Battle Flag specialty license plate was constitutional.[267] Thomas agreed with the judgment in McDonald v. Chicago (2010) that the right to keep and bear arms is applicable to state and local governments, but he wrote a separate concurrence finding that an individual's right to bear arms is fundamental as a privilege of American citizenship under the Privileges or Immunities Clause rather than as a fundamental right under the due process clause.[268] The four justices in the plurality opinion specifically rejected incorporation under the privileges or immunities clause, \"declin[ing] to disturb\" the holding in the Slaughter-House Cases, which, according to the plurality, had held that the clause applied only to federal matters.[269][270] Since 2010, Thomas has dissented from denial of certiorari in several Second Amendment cases. He voted to grant certiorari in Friedman v. City of Highland Park (2015), which upheld bans on certain semi-automatic rifles; Jackson v. San Francisco (2014), which upheld trigger lock ordinances similar to those struck down in Heller; Peruta v. San Diego County (2016), which upheld restrictive concealed carry licensing in California; and Silvester v. Becerra (2017), which upheld waiting periods for firearm purchasers who have already passed background checks and already own firearms. He was joined by Scalia in the first two cases, and by Gorsuch in Peruta.[271][272][273][274] Thomas dissented from the denial of an application for a stay presented to Chief Justice Roberts in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit case Guedes v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (2019), a case challenging the Trump administration's ban on bump stocks. Only Thomas and Gorsuch publicly dissented.[275] Thomas authored the majority opinion in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen (2022), guaranteeing the right of law-abiding citizens to carry firearms in public. The case held: \"When the Second Amendment's plain text covers an individual's conduct, the Constitution presumptively protects that conduct. The government must then justify its regulation by demonstrating that it is consistent with the Nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation. Only then may a court conclude that the individual's conduct falls outside the Second Amendment's 'unqualified command.'\" Justice Stephen Breyer, dissenting, wrote, \"when courts interpret the Second Amendment, it is constitutionally proper, indeed often necessary, for them to consider the serious dangers and consequences of gun violence that lead States to regulate firearms.\"[276] Thomas was the sole dissenter in United States v. Rahimi. In Rahimi, the Court was tasked with deciding whether 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(8) (a federal statute that prohibits people subject to a domestic restraining order from possessing guns during the time they are subject to the order and imposes up to 15 years' imprisonment for each violation) is unconstitutional on its face. The other eight justices found that the statute could be applied constitutionally, but Thomas argued that the surety, affray, and \"going armed\" laws the government proffered were not sufficient analogies to §922(g)(8) for many reasons, including that historical surety laws did not actually disarm people but only required them to post a bond that would be forfeited if they breached the peace, and that affray laws targeted violence that occurred in public, not private interpersonal violence within the home.[277][278][279] In cases regarding the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures, Thomas often favors police over defendants. For example, his opinion for the Court in Board of Education v. Earls upheld drug testing for students involved in extracurricular activities, and he wrote again for the Court in Samson v. California, permitting random searches on parolees. He dissented in Georgia v. Randolph, which prohibited warrantless searches that one resident approves and the other opposes, arguing that the Court's decision in Coolidge v. New Hampshire controlled the case. In Indianapolis v. Edmond, Thomas described the Court's extant case law as having held that \"suspicionless roadblock seizures are constitutionally permissible if conducted according to a plan that limits the discretion of the officers conducting the stops.\" He expressed doubt that those cases were decided correctly but concluded that since the litigants in the case at bar had not briefed or argued that the earlier cases be overruled, he believed that the Court should assume their validity and rule accordingly.[280] Thomas was in the majority in Kyllo v. United States, which held that the use of thermal imaging technology to probe a suspect's home without a warrant violated the Fourth Amendment. In cases involving schools, Thomas has advocated greater respect for the doctrine of in loco parentis,[281] which he defines as \"parents delegat[ing] to teachers their authority to discipline and maintain order\".[282] His dissent in Safford Unified School District v. Redding illustrates his application of this postulate in the Fourth Amendment context. School officials in the Safford case had a reasonable suspicion that 13-year-old Savana Redding was illegally distributing prescription-only drugs. All the justices concurred that it was therefore reasonable for the school officials to search Redding, and the main issue before the Court was only whether the search went too far by becoming a strip search or the like.[282] All the justices except Thomas concluded that the search violated the Fourth Amendment. The majority required a finding of danger or reason to believe drugs were hidden in a student's underwear in order to justify a strip search. Thomas wrote, \"It is a mistake for judges to assume the responsibility for deciding which school rules are important enough to allow for invasive searches and which rules are not\"[283] and \"reasonable suspicion that Redding was in possession of drugs in violation of these policies, therefore, justified a search extending to any area where small pills could be concealed\". He added, \"[t]here can be no doubt that a parent would have had the authority to conduct the search.\"[282] In Doggett v. United States, the defendant had technically been a fugitive from the time he was indicted in 1980 until his arrest in 1988. The Court held that the delay between indictment and arrest violated Doggett's Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial, finding that the government had been negligent in pursuing him and that he was unaware of the indictment.[284] Thomas dissented, arguing that the Speedy Trial Clause's purpose was to prevent \"'undue and oppressive incarceration' and the 'anxiety and concern accompanying public accusation'\" and that the case implicated neither.[284] He cast the case instead as \"present[ing] the question [of] whether, independent of these core concerns, the Speedy Trial Clause protects an accused from two additional harms: (1) prejudice to his ability to defend himself caused by the passage of time; and (2) disruption of his life years after the alleged commission of his crime\". Thomas dissented from the court's decision to, as he saw it, answer the former in the affirmative.[284] He wrote that dismissing the conviction \"invites the Nation's judges to indulge in ad hoc and result-driven second guessing of the government's investigatory efforts. Our Constitution neither contemplates nor tolerates such a role\".[285] In Garza v. Idaho, Thomas and Gorsuch, in dissent, suggested that Gideon v. Wainwright (1963), which required that indigent criminal defendants be provided counsel, was wrongly decided and should be overruled.[220] Thomas was among the dissenters in Atkins v. Virginia and Roper v. Simmons, which held that the Eighth Amendment prohibits the application of the death penalty to certain classes of persons. In Kansas v. Marsh, his majority opinion indicated a belief that the Constitution affords states broad procedural latitude in imposing the death penalty, provided they remain within the limits of Furman v. Georgia and Gregg v. Georgia, the 1976 case in which the Court reversed its 1972 ban on death sentences if states followed procedural guidelines.[citation needed] In Hudson v. McMillian, a prisoner had been beaten by respondent prison guards, sustaining a cracked lip, broken dental plate, loosened teeth, cuts, and bruises. The Court held that \"the use of excessive physical force against a prisoner may constitute cruel and unusual punishment even though the inmate does not suffer serious injury.\"[286] Dissenting, Thomas wrote, \"a use of force that causes only insignificant harm to a prisoner may be immoral, it may be tortious, it may be criminal, and it may even be remediable under other provisions of the Federal Constitution, but it is not 'cruel and unusual punishment'. In concluding to the contrary, the Court today goes far beyond our precedents.\"[286] Thomas's vote—in one of his first cases after joining the Court—was an early example of his willingness to be the sole dissenter (Scalia later joined the opinion).[287] His opinion was criticized by the seven-member majority, which wrote that, by comparing physical assault to other prison conditions such as poor prison food, it ignored \"the concepts of dignity, civilized standards, humanity, and decency that animate the Eighth Amendment\".[286] According to historian David Garrow, Thomas's dissent in Hudson was a \"classic call for federal judicial restraint, reminiscent of views that were held by Felix Frankfurter and John M. Harlan II a generation earlier, but editorial criticism rained down on him\".[288] Thomas later responded to the accusation \"that I supported the beating of prisoners in that case. Well, one must either be illiterate or fraught with malice to reach that conclusion ... no honest reading can reach such a conclusion.\"[288] In United States v. Bajakajian, Thomas joined with the Court's liberal justices to write the majority opinion declaring a fine unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment. The fine was for failing to declare more than $300,000 in a suitcase on an international flight. Under a federal statute, 18 U.S.C. § 982(a)(1), the passenger would have had to forfeit the entire amount. Thomas noted that the case required a distinction to be made between civil forfeiture and a fine exacted with the intention of punishing the respondent. He found that the forfeiture in this case was clearly intended as a punishment at least in part, was \"grossly disproportional\" and violated the Excessive Fines Clause.[289] Thomas has written that the \"Cruel and Unusual Punishment\" clause \"contains no proportionality principle\", meaning that the question whether a sentence should be rejected as \"cruel and unusual\" depends only on the sentence itself, not on what crime is being punished.[290] He concurred with the Court's decision to reject a request for review from a petitioner who had been sentenced to 25 years to life in prison under California's \"Three-Strikes\" law for stealing golf clubs because the combined value of the clubs made the theft a felony and he had two previous felonies in his criminal record.[non-primary source needed] Thomas believes the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment forbids consideration of race, such as race-based affirmative action or preferential treatment. In Adarand Constructors v. Peña, he wrote, \"there is a 'moral [and] constitutional equivalence' between laws designed to subjugate a race and those that distribute benefits on the basis of race in order to foster some current notion of equality. Government cannot make us equal; it can only recognize, respect, and protect us as equal before the law. That [affirmative action] programs may have been motivated, in part, by good intentions cannot provide refuge from the principle that under our Constitution, the government may not make distinctions on the basis of race.\"[291] In Gratz v. Bollinger, Thomas wrote, \"a State's use of racial discrimination in higher education admissions is categorically prohibited by the Equal Protection Clause.\"[292] In Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1, Thomas joined the opinion of Chief Justice Roberts, who wrote that \"[t]he way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.\"[293] Concurring, Thomas wrote, \"if our history has taught us anything, it has taught us to beware of elites bearing racial theories\", and charged that the dissent carried \"similarities\" to the arguments of the segregationist litigants in Brown v. Board of Education.[293] Thomas joined the majority in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard, which struck down affirmative action in college admissions. He filed a concurring opinion, which he read from the bench, a rare practice for Supreme Court justices.[294] Thomas has contended that the Constitution does not address abortion.[295] In Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992), the Court reaffirmed Roe v. Wade. Thomas and Justice Byron White joined the dissenting opinions of Rehnquist and Scalia. Rehnquist wrote, \"[w]e believe Roe was wrongly decided, and that it can and should be overruled consistently with our traditional approach to stare decisis in constitutional cases.\"[296] Scalia's opinion concluded that the right to obtain an abortion is not \"a liberty protected by the Constitution of the United States\".[296] \"[T]he Constitution says absolutely nothing about it,\" Scalia wrote, \"and [ ] the longstanding traditions of American society have permitted it to be legally proscribed\".[296] In Stenberg v. Carhart (2000), the Court struck down a state ban on partial-birth abortion, concluding that it failed Casey's \"undue burden\" test. Thomas dissented, writing, \"Although a State may permit abortion, nothing in the Constitution dictates that a State must do so.\"[297] He went on to criticize the reasoning of the Casey and Stenberg majorities: \"The majority's insistence on a health exception is a fig leaf barely covering its hostility to any abortion regulation by the States—a hostility that Casey purported to reject.\" In Gonzales v. Carhart (2007), the Court rejected a facial challenge to a federal ban on partial-birth abortion.[298] Concurring, Thomas asserted that the court's abortion jurisprudence had no basis in the Constitution but that the court had accurately applied that jurisprudence in rejecting the challenge.[298] He added that the Court was not deciding the question of whether Congress had the power to outlaw partial-birth abortions: \"[W]hether the Act constitutes a permissible exercise of Congress's power under the Commerce Clause is not before the Court [in this case] ... the parties did not raise or brief that issue; it is outside the question presented; and the lower courts did not address it.\"[298] In December 2018, Thomas dissented when the Court voted not to hear cases brought by Louisiana and Kansas to deny Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood.[299] Alito and Gorsuch joined Thomas's dissent, arguing that the Court was \"abdicating its judicial duty\".[300] In February 2019, Thomas joined three of the Court's other conservative justices in voting to reject a stay to temporarily block a law restricting abortion in Louisiana.[301] The law that the court temporarily stayed, in a 5–4 decision, would have required that doctors performing abortions have admitting privileges in a hospital.[302] In Box v. Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky, Inc. (2019), a per curiam decision upholding the provision of Indiana's abortion restriction regarding fetal remains disposal on rational basis scrutiny and upholding the lower court rulings striking down the provision banning race, sex, and disability, Thomas wrote a concurring opinion comparing abortion and birth control to eugenics, which was practiced in the U.S. in the early 20th century and by the Nazi government in Germany in the 1930s and 1940s, and comparing Box to Buck v. Bell (1927), which upheld a forced sterilization law regarding people with mental disabilities. In his opinion, Thomas quoted Margaret Sanger's support for contraception as a form of personal reproductive control that she considered superior to \"the horrors of abortion and infanticide\" (Sanger's words).[303][non-primary source needed] His opinion referred several times to historian/journalist Adam Cohen's book Imbeciles: The Supreme Court, American Eugenics, and the Sterilization of Carrie Buck; shortly afterward, Cohen published a sharply worded criticism saying that Thomas had misinterpreted his book and misunderstood the history of the eugenics movement.[304] In Box, only Thomas, Sonia Sotomayor, and Ginsburg publicly registered their votes. Ginsburg and Sotomayor concurred in part and dissented in part, stating they would have upheld the lower court decision on striking down the race, sex, and disability ban as well as the lower court decision striking down the fetal remains disposal provision.[303] In a concurring opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization (2022), Thomas wrote that \"any substantive due process decision is 'demonstrably erroneous'\",[305] and argued that the Supreme Court should go beyond Roe vs. Wade and reconsider other substantive due process precedents, including those established in Griswold v. Connecticut (1965), Lawrence v. Texas (2003) and Obergefell v. Hodges (2015). The overturning of these previous decisions would enable states to limit access to contraception, criminalize sodomy, and criminalize same-sex marriage, respectively.[306][307][308] In Romer v. Evans (1996), Thomas joined Scalia's dissenting opinion arguing that Amendment Two to the Colorado State Constitution did not violate the Equal Protection Clause. The Colorado amendment forbade any judicial, legislative, or executive action designed to protect persons from discrimination based on \"homosexual, lesbian, or bisexual orientation, conduct, practices or relationships\".[309] In Lawrence v. Texas (2003), Thomas issued a one-page dissent in which he called the Texas statute prohibiting sodomy \"uncommonly silly\", a phrase originally used by Justice Potter Stewart. He then said that if he were a member of the Texas legislature he would vote to repeal the law, as it was not a worthwhile use of \"law enforcement resources\" to police private sexual behavior. But Thomas opined that the Constitution does not contain a right to privacy and therefore did not vote to strike the statute down. He saw the issue as a matter for states to decide for themselves.[310] In Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia (2020), Thomas joined Alito and Kavanaugh in dissenting from the decision that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protects employees against discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. (Alito wrote a dissent that Thomas joined, and Kavanaugh dissented separately.) The 6–3 ruling's majority consisted of two Republican-appointed justices, Roberts and Gorsuch, along with four Democratic-appointed justices: Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan.[311] In October 2020, Thomas joined the other justices in denying an appeal from Kim Davis, a county clerk who refused to give marriage licenses to same-sex couples, but wrote a separate opinion reiterating his dissent from Obergefell v. Hodges and expressing his belief that it was wrongly decided.[312][313][314] In July 2021, he was one of three justices, with Gorsuch and Alito, who voted to hear an appeal from a Washington florist who had refused service to a same-sex couple based on her religious beliefs against same-sex marriage.[315][316][317] In November 2021, Thomas dissented from the majority of justices in a 6–3 vote to reject an appeal from Mercy San Juan Medical Center, a hospital affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church, which had sought to deny a hysterectomy to a transgender patient on religious grounds.[318] Alito and Gorsuch also dissented, and the vote to reject the appeal left in place a lower court ruling in the patient's favor.[319][320] During a 10-year period from February 2006 to February 2016, Thomas read his opinions from the bench but asked no questions during oral arguments.[321][322] By May 2020, he had asked questions in two oral arguments since 2006 and had spoken during 32 of the roughly 2,400 arguments since 1991.[323][324] Thomas has given many reasons for his silence, including self-consciousness about how he speaks, a preference for listening to those arguing the case, and difficulty getting in a word.[325] He said in 2013 that it was \"unnecessary in deciding cases to ask that many questions ... we should listen to lawyers who are arguing their cases, and I think we should allow the advocates to advocate.\"[325] His speaking and listening habits may have been influenced by his Gullah upbringing, during which his English was relatively unpolished.[17][63][326] In a 2017 paper in Northwestern University Law Review, RonNell Andersen Jones and Aaron L. Nielson wrote that while asking few questions, \"in many ways, [Thomas] is a model questioner.\"[327][328] Thomas took a more active role in questioning when the Supreme Court shifted to holding teleconferenced arguments in May 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, in which the justices took turns asking questions in order of seniority.[329][330][331][324] Since the court resumed in-person oral arguments at the beginning of the 2021 term, the justices agreed to allow Thomas to ask the first question of each lawyer following their opening statements.[332] In 1971, Thomas married Kathy Grace Ambush. The couple had one child, Jamal Adeen, born in 1973, who is Thomas's sole child. Thomas and his first wife separated in 1981 and divorced in 1984.[333][334] In 1987, Thomas married Virginia Lamp, a lobbyist and aide to U.S. Representative Dick Armey.[335] In 1997, they took in Thomas's six-year-old great-nephew, Mark Martin Jr.,[336] who had lived with his mother in Savannah public housing.[337] Since 1999, Thomas and his wife have traveled across the U.S. in a motorcoach between Court terms.[338][339] Virginia \"Ginni\" Thomas has remained active in conservative politics, serving as a consultant to The Heritage Foundation and as founder and president of Liberty Central.[340] In 2011, she stepped down from Liberty Central to open a conservative lobbying firm, touting her \"experience and connections\", meeting with newly elected Republican representatives and calling herself an \"ambassador to the Tea Party\".[341][342] Also in 2011, 74 Democratic members of the House of Representatives wrote that Justice Thomas should recuse himself on cases regarding the Affordable Care Act because of \"appearance of a conflict of interest\" based on his wife's work.[343] The Washington Post reported in February 2021 that Ginni Thomas apologized to a group of Thomas's former clerks on the email listserv \"Thomas Clerk World\" for her role in contributing to a rift relating to \"pro-Trump postings and former Thomas clerk John Eastman, who spoke at the rally and represented Trump in some of his failed lawsuits filed to overturn the election results\".[344] In March 2022, texts between Ginni Thomas and Trump's chief of staff Mark Meadows from 2020 were turned over to the Select Committee on the January 6 Attack.[345] The texts show Ginni Thomas repeatedly urging Meadows to overturn the election results and repeating conspiracy theories about ballot fraud.[346] In response, 24 Democratic members of the House of Representatives and the Senate demanded that Thomas recuse himself from cases related to efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and the January 6 attack at the U.S. Capitol on the grounds that Ginni Thomas's involvement in such efforts raised questions about his impartiality.[347] An April 2022 Quinnipiac poll found that 52% of Americans agreed that, in light of Ginni Thomas's texts about overturning the results of the 2020 presidential election, Thomas should have recused himself from related cases.[348] Thomas was reconciled to the Catholic Church in the mid-1990s.[349] In his autobiography, he criticized the church for failing to grapple with racism in the 1960s during the civil rights movement, saying it was not so \"adamant about ending racism then as it is about ending abortion now\".[350] As of 2021, Thomas is one of 14 practicing Catholic justices in the Court's history and one of six currently serving (along with Alito, Kavanaugh, Roberts, Sotomayor, and Barrett).[351] In 1975, when Thomas read economist Thomas Sowell's Race and Economics, he found an intellectual foundation for his philosophy.[352][353] The book criticizes social reform by government and argues for individual action to overcome circumstances and adversity. Ayn Rand's works also influenced him, particularly The Fountainhead, and he later required his staffers to watch the 1949 film version of the novel.[354][355] Thomas acknowledges \"some very strong libertarian leanings\", though he does not consider himself a libertarian.[356] Thomas has said novelist Richard Wright is the most influential writer in his life; Wright's books Native Son and Black Boy \"capture[d] a lot of the feelings that I had inside that you learn how to repress\".[333] Native Son and Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man are Thomas's two favorite novels.[191] In 2016, Moira Smith, vice-president and general counsel of a natural gas distributor in Alaska, said that Thomas groped her buttocks at a dinner party in 1999. She was a Truman Foundation scholar helping the director of the foundation set up for a dinner party honoring Thomas and David Adkins. Smith's roommates at the time confirmed that she had told them about the incident. Thomas denied the allegation.[357][358] Louis Blair, who was the head of the Truman Foundation and hosted the dinner at his home, said he had \"no recollection of the incident\" and that he had neither seen nor heard of Smith's allegation. Blair acknowledged that he was in the kitchen most of the time so, if the incident happened, he wouldn't have seen it, but was also \"skeptical that the justice and Moira would have been alone\", given that there were approximately 16 people in three rooms.[359][360] Norma Stevens, who attended the event, said that the incident \"couldn't have happened\" because Thomas was never alone, as he was the guest of honor.[361] In 2004, the Los Angeles Times reported that Thomas had accepted gifts from Harlan Crow, a wealthy Dallas-based real estate investor and prominent Republican donor, including a Bible that once belonged to abolitionist Frederick Douglass and a bust of Abraham Lincoln.[362][363] Crow also gave Thomas a portrait of the justice and his wife, according to the painter, Sharif Tarabay. Crow's foundation gave $105,000 to Yale Law School, Thomas's alma mater, for the \"Justice Thomas Portrait Fund\", tax filings showed.[364] Spousal income and connections to cases has been redacted from the Justices' ethical disclosure forms.[365] In 2011, Politico reported that Crow gave $500,000 to a Tea Party group founded by Thomas's wife and that Thomas had failed to report her income on his disclosure for more than a decade.[366][367] Also that year, the advocacy group Common Cause reported that between 2003 and 2007, Thomas failed to disclose $686,589 in income his wife earned from The Heritage Foundation, instead reporting \"none\" where \"spousal noninvestment income\" would be reported on his Supreme Court financial disclosure forms.[368] The next week, Thomas said the disclosure of his wife's income had been \"inadvertently omitted due to a misunderstanding of the filing instructions\".[369] He amended reports going back to 1989.[370] In April 2023, ProPublica reported that Thomas had \"accepted luxury trips virtually every year\" from Crow for two decades and failed to report them. They included flights on Crow's private jet, international cruises on Crow's superyacht, and stays at Crow's private resort in the Adirondacks and the private club Bohemian Grove.[364][371][367] The Ethics in Government Act requires justices, judges, members of Congress and federal officials to annually disclose gifts they receive.[372] Many elected officials criticized the appearance of impropriety, given Crow's donations to conservative causes and Republican candidates, and his service on the board of trustees for the American Enterprise Institute and the Hoover Institution, which have filed amicus briefs before the Supreme Court.[373][364] In May 2023, ProPublica reported that Crow had paid for private school tuition for Thomas's grandnephew, Mark Martin, of whom Thomas had legal custody. Thomas did not report the payments on his financial disclosure forms, while ethics law experts said that they were required to be disclosed as gifts. Mark Paoletta, a longtime friend of Thomas, said that Crow paid for one year each at Hidden Lake and Randolph-Macon Academy, which ProPublica estimated to be worth around $100,000.[374][367] On the same day, The Washington Post reported that in January 2012 conservative judicial activist Leonard Leo had Republican pollster Kellyanne Conway's polling firm bill the Judicial Education Project $25,000, which her firm then paid to Ginni Thomas's firm, Liberty Consulting, for a total of $80,000 between June 2011 and June 2012. Leo instructed Conway not to mention Thomas's name on the paperwork. The documents the newspaper reviewed did not indicate the nature of the work Thomas did for the Judicial Education Project or Conway's company. In 2012 the Judicial Education Project filed a brief to the Supreme Court in a landmark voting rights case.[375][367] In 2023, The New York Times reported that a friend had paid for Thomas's Prevost Le Mirage XL Marathon RV, purchased for $267,230 in 1999 (roughly equivalent to $489,000 in 2023). Anthony Welters, a former UnitedHealthcare executive and a close friend, lent Thomas the purchase price. In response to a Senate inquiry, Welters revealed that the loan was discharged in 2008, forgiving much of the original balance. A bank would have been unlikely to offer such a loan, given the Marathon's high capacity for customization, which can make used models difficult to appraise. Thomas had previously said that he \"had scrimped and saved to afford the motor coach\", according to the Times, and a friend, Armstrong Williams, said that Thomas had told him that \"he saved up all his money to buy it\". When the loan was forgiven, Thomas was required to disclose the money as a gift.[376][377][378][367][379] In June 2024, Thomas filed an amendment to his financial disclosure report for 2019 to include information he had \"inadvertently omitted\". The amendment disclosed that he had received food and lodging at a hotel in Bali and a private club in California from Harlan Crow in July 2019.[380][381] He did not report travel to and from the destinations on private jets or the nine-day cruise on Crow's superyacht.[380][381] In 2023, both the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Senate Finance Committee opened investigations into Thomas's undisclosed gifts.[382][383] The two committees found additional undisclosed travel on Crow's private jet and superyacht, including international trips in 2010 and domestic trips in 2017, 2019, and 2021.[382][384] In 2023, in response to Thomas's nondisclosures, Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats called on Chief Justice Roberts to open an investigation into Thomas's conduct.[385] On December 21, 2024, Democratic members of the Senate Judiciary Committee released a report revealing that Thomas had taken an additional two trips in 2021 paid for by Crow.[386] Fix the Court released an analysis showing that, over the 20 years beginning in 2004, Thomas had accepted gifts worth $4.2 million, based on reporting by ProPublica and others.[387][388][389] It estimated that over the same 20 years, the other eight justices plus the eight retired or deceased justices received gifts worth roughly $600,000 combined.[389] On January 3, 2025, the U.S. Judicial Conference announced it will not refer Thomas to the Justice Department over ethics allegations, denying a request from Senators Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island and Ron Wyden of Oregon. U.S. District Judge Robert Conrad, the Conference Secretary of the Judicial Conference, cited legal uncertainty regarding the Conference's authority to make a criminal referral regarding a Supreme Court justice.[390][391] Thomas was awarded the 1992 Horatio Alger Award by the Horatio Alger Association of Distinguished Americans.[392] In 2001, Thomas was awarded the Francis Boyer Award presented by the American Enterprise Institute.[393] In 2012, Thomas received an honorary degree from the College of the Holy Cross, his alma mater.[394] He was a member of the college's board of trustees in 1990, and also from 2004 to 2006.[395] In 2020, Belmont Abbey College awarded him the Benedict Leadership Award for his devotion to the Catholic faith and government service.[396]",

                "content": "Clarence Thomas (born June 23, 1948) is the Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.[2] Thomas has been a Justice since 1991. He is the second African American to serve on the court, after Thurgood Marshall. During his confirmation process, Professor Anita Hill accused Thomas of sexual harassment. Regardless, Thomas was confirmed in October 1991. Clarence Thomas was born in Pin Point, Georgia.[3] His father left his family when he was only two years old.[4] He did not meet his son Clarence again until Clarence was nine years old.[5] This left his mother, Leola Anderson, to take care of the family. Clarence and his brother were sent to live with his mother's parents in Savannah, Georgia.[6] His grandfather wanted him to become a priest. Thomas was sent to St. John Vianney Minor Seminary, an all-white boarding school near Savannah.[3] In 1968 he transferred to the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts.[7] He gave up all ideas of becoming a priest after the death of Martin Luther King Jr.. Thomas then obtained a law degree at Yale University.[7] After Yale he returned to Missouri and worked for State Attorney General, John Danforth.[3] in 1977 Danforth was elected to the U.S. Senate. Thomas became a corporate lawyer for the Monsanto Company. Two years later he became Danforth's legislative aide in Washington, D.C..[3] President Ronald Reagan offered Thomas a job as the assistant secretary for civil rights in the U.S. Department of Education.[3] He then became the chairman of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Thomas was appointed to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in 1990 by President George H. W. Bush.[3] In 1991, Thurgood Marshall retired from the Supreme Court. Bush nominated Thomas to replace him.[3] He had a hard time getting approved so that he could become a Supreme Court justice. This was partly because one of his former employees, Anita Hill, claimed that he sexually harassed her.[8] Thomas said that was not true. The Senate confirmed his nomination by a vote of 52-48. All Republicans, except Bob Packwood of Oregon and James Jeffords of Vermont, voted for confirmation.[9]",
