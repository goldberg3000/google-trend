                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Michigan earned a huge 19-13 win against No. 11 Alabama in the ReliaQuest Bowl on Tuesday. The shorthanded Wolverines, who were down several key players due to both opt outs and the transfer portal, led wire-to-wire after taking advantage of numerous Alabama mistakes in the first quarter. The Crimson Tide turned the ball over three times -- and had their first offensive drive end with a failed fourth-down conversion -- in the first 15 minutes. That means for its first four possessions Michigan's average starting position was Alabama's 21-yard line. The Wolverines took advantage, even if they left some points on the board. Three of Michigan's first four drives ended in a field goal from kicker Dominic Zvada, two of which came from 30 yards or less. Quarterback Davis Warren, who later exited the game with an apparent leg injury, did hit wide receiver Fredrick Moore for a 13-yard touchdown and Michigan left the first quarter with a 16-0 lead it never surrendered. Alabama had 2 total yards of offense until late in the second quarter when it went on two drives that covered a combined 161 yards and resulted in 10 points. It wasn't enough to spark a full comeback, however. The Crimson Tide actually had a chance to win it late in the fourth quarter. One possession after kicker Graham Nicholson hit a season-long 51-yard field goal which cut Michigan's lead to one possession, Alabama got the ball all the way to Michigan's 15-yard line. But on fourth-and-10, Milroe came under immediate pressure and threw an incomplete pass, which allowed Michigan to take possession and kneel the clock out on a momentum-building bowl victory. That was a common theme for the Wolverines through 2024, especially in their last two wins against Ohio State and Alabama. Michigan didn't play a great game on offense. In fact, after the first quarter, it was largely ineffective. But it did do enough to put the game away. Michigan's shorthanded defense definitely deserves a ton of credit, as the Wolverines held Alabama scoreless for almost three entire quarters, which allowed the offense to sit on their early 16-0 lead. Michigan did employ a smart ball-control strategy to limit Alabama's possessions and, thus, its explosive potential on offense. The Wolverines gained just 32 yards in the third quarter, but they held onto the football for a whopping 10:52 seconds. That took the air out of Alabama's late first-half surge, when it scored 10 unanswered points to cut Michigan's lead to 16-10. Michigan won the time of possession battle by almost 17 minutes, with a lot of its advantage created in that third quarter. That kept the defense fresh and it limited Alabama's window to mount a comeback. Michigan's modern run of success has been keyed, largely, by excellent running back play. The Wolverines have had star players like Blake Corum, Donovan Edwards and Kalel Mullings lead their offense while gashing opposing defenses on the ground. They may have found the next great one in freshman running back Jordan Marshall. Marshall was thrust into a starting role after Mullings and Edwards opted out and he responded with a strong performance, especially after Michigan lost starting quarterback Davis Warren to injury. Marshall carried the ball 23 times for 100 yards, averaging just over four yards per carry against a strong Alabama defense. He had a key 24-yard run early in the fourth quarter, bouncing off of Alabama defenders in the process, to set up Dominic Zvada's decisive 37-yard field goal. Not bad for a true freshman making his first career start. Marshall certainly provided Michigan fans with some optimism about the future of the Wolverines' offense, especially with players like five-star quarterback Bryce Underwood joining the fold moving forward. Alabama quarterback Jalen Milroe still has yet to make a decision on his future. Before Tuesday's bowl game, he was considered an intriguing NFL Draft prospect with plenty of untapped upside and physical traits that would make him a desirable option for front offices, likely in the middle rounds. Now his stock is up in the air. Milroe definitely had his moments in the ReliaQuest Bowl. He had one 41-yard run where he flashed his athleticism and weaved around Michigan defenders to set up Alabama's second scoring drive. He had nice throws of 25 yards to tight end Robbie Ouzts for Alabama's first touchdown of the game, and a deep 40-yard completion to wide receiver Germie Bernard near the end of the second quarter. But, overall, he was largely ineffective. He turned the ball over three times in the first quarter alone. One of those was on a botched snap, and the other was an interception after he mistimed a shallow out route. Milroe also had multiple misses on passes at every level of the field. His pocket awareness was concerning, as he struggled to sense pressure and often held onto the ball for too long. There's a good chance that Milroe still gets drafted if he declares, especially since he's one of the most physically gifted quarterbacks in college football. His lackluster bowl performance left a sour last impression on scouts, though. Or, at the very least, take a late lead. Michigan was gifted a first down thanks to an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty on Alabama linebacker Justin Jefferson, but the Wolverines weren't able to do much more with the free yardage. The Crimson Tide defense, which has been great all day, forced a punt that Alabama's Ryan Williams returned 38 yards to give his team possession on Alabama's 44-yard line. Prime scoring opportunity, though the Tide need a touchdown at this point. We've got some clutch kicking in the ReliaQuest Bowl. Alabama stalled at Michigan's 33-yard line during a crucial drive. Instead of going for it on fourth-and-10, the Crimson Tide sent kicker Graham Nicholson out. He hit his second field goal of the day and set his season high with a 51-yard boot. It had enough power behind it to split the uprights from even further out. Alabama's hanging around. Dominic Zvada, still one of the most important players in college football. It's rare that a college kicker is so reliable, but he has now hit on all four of his field goal attempts in the ReliaQuest Bowl. His latest, from 37 yards out, was the biggest, as it expanded Michigan's lead back to two possessions with 7:21 left to play. Michigan leaned on running back Jordan Marshall, who carried the ball five times, to get into scoring range. He had a nice 24-yard run that moved the ball into Alabama territory. Alabama, which has scoring drives of 71 and 90 yards, was unable to capitalize on its best starting field position of the game after a Zabien Brown interception handed Alabama the ball on the 50-yard line. Alabama quarterback Jalen Milroe almost threw an interception on third-and-7. The Crimson Tide still went for it, and Milroe was late on a pass to Jaylen Mbakwe, who caught the ball out of bounds. Michigan stills holds a narrow lead after three quarters of play. Five drives ended without any points in the third quarter. Four of those resulted in punts, while the fifth was cut short when Michigan quarterback Alex Orji threw an interception to Alabama defensive back Zabien Brown. The biggest news coming out of the third quarter was the fact that Michigan starting quarterback Davis Warren was taken to the locker room with an apparent leg injury. Without Warren, the Wolverines turned to Orji, who hasn't been able to make anything happen on offense. Alabama will start the fourth quarter with a prime opportunity to finally jump into the lead. Brown's interception gave the Tide the ball at the 50-yard line, and a quick 9-yard completion to wide receiver Rico Scott put Alabama in Michigan territory for the first time since the second quarter ended. All 16 of Michigan's points thus far came in the first quarter. Not counting the end of the first half, the Wolverines have punted on five consecutive drives since. They have crossed midfield just once since the first quarter and all four of their first-quarter drives began in plus territory. So that means Michigan's offense has possessed the ball 10 times, but it has made it past the 50-yard line just once. The Wolverines still have yet to gain more than 34 yards in a single drive. Now Alabama is having injury issues of its own. Top linebacker Jihaad Campbell just left the field with an apparent injury after attempting a tackle on Michigan running back Jordan Marshall. He was slow to get up and didn't walk off the field until Alabama's training staff came out to help him. He would be a huge loss fro the Crimson Tide defense, which has played very well today. Michigan's offense is still spinning its wheels after an ineffective drive to open the second half. To make matters worse, starting quarterback Davis Warren appears injured after taking a long sack. Alabama defensive linemen dragged Warren down near the sideline and Warren remained on the turf for a few moments. He initially got up, with the help of teammates, but went back to the ground after taking a few steps. Warren wasn't putting much weight on his right leg, which got bent under him when Smith brough him to the ground. Michigan leads No. 11 Alabama 16-7 at halftime of the ReliaQuest Bowl after the first two quarters felt way more lopsided than the score may indicate. Alabama turned the ball over three times in the first quarter -- and that doesn't include its first drive, which ended in a failed fourth-down conversion -- which gave Michigan three drives that started in the red zone. In spite of that, the Wolverines only found the end zone once in the first half thanks to a 13-yard connection between quarterback Davis Warren and wide receiver Fredrick Moore. Moore, who stepped into a bigger role when Michigan lost its top two receivers entering Tuesday's game, had a nice first half with three catches for 37 yards and the score. Though it took Alabama's offense a long time to find its footing, Michigan's inability to fully capitalize on Alabama's numerous mistakes allowed the Crimson Tide to keep the door open. They captured some late momentum with a four-play, 71-yard drive capped by a 25-yard touchdown connection between quarterback Jalen Milroe and tight end Robbie Ouzts near the end of the second quarter. Prior to that 71-yard scoring drive, Alabama had 2 total yards on offense. The Crimson Tide now enter halftime outgaining Michigan by 54 yards. Michigan's offense needs to figure something out in the second half. The Wolverines, who will receive the kickoff, cannot sit on their lead with Alabama's offense starting to hit its stride. It seemed like Alabama would have been content to run the clock out and enter half time when it gained possession at its own 4-yard line with just 50 seconds left to play and no timeouts. But, on third-and-1, Michigan inexplicably saved some clock for the Crimson Tide by calling a timeout. Then quarterback Jalen Milroe ripped off a 41-yard run, and hit wide receiver Germie Bernard for a gain of 40 yards, which put the Crimson Tide in prime scoring position. Kicker Graham Nicholson eventually ate into Michigan's lead with a 24-yard field goal. It took over 25 minutes, but Alabama's offense finally looks like itself. The Crimson Tide just battled back into this game with an easy 71-yard drive, marching down the field in just four plays to score their first touchdown of the game. Freshman wide receiver Rico Scott got things started with a 28-yard gain on a jet sweep play. Alabama then gained a combined 15 yards on a tight end screen that Josh Cuevas fumbled. Offensive lineman Elijah Pritchett recovered the ball and rumbled for another eight yards. Then, a couple plays later, Alabama quarterback Jalen Milroe hit a wide open Robbie Ouzts for a 25-yard touchdown. The only positive thing to say for Alabama's offense thus far is that it has now gone two straight possessions without a turnover. Both of those drives still ended in a punt, though. The Crimson Tide have more turnovers (3) than total yards (2). Their offense totals are being dragged down by their minus 16 yards rushing. Alabama quarterback Jalen Milroe has already been sacked three times, and Alabama's running backs have combined for 11 yards on five carries. Milroe, who was responsible for all three turnovers, is having a rough game. Outside of the mistakes, he's also been inaccurate passing the ball thus far and had a couple misses on Alabama's latest drive that forced it into another punt. Alabama's defense has played well thus far, and it just got a much-needed stop after the Crimson Tide punted for the first time. Michigan gained 24 yards in eight plays and took five minutes off the clock but, ultimately, had to punt short of the 50-yard line after a rush attempt was stoned on third-and-8. Alabama returner Ryan Williams decided to field the punt at Alabama's 16-yard line and was tackled immediately, which means that the Crimson Tide will, once again, start with unfavorable field position. The ReliaQuest Bowl really couldn't be going much worse for Alabama thus far. The Crimson Tide turned the ball over three times and had another drive end with a failed fourth-down conversion in the first quarter. One of those turnovers was an entirely unforced error when quarterback Jalen Milroe fumbled the ball on a botched snap exchange. That was the first of two fumbles for Milroe, who also had an interception. Even with all of that, Michigan wasn't able to exit the first quarter with a completely decisive lead. All four of Michigan's drives started in Alabama territory with the average start at Alabama's 21-yard line, but Michigan still came out with three field goals courtesy of kicker Dominic Zvada. Alabama's defense is keeping the Tide in this game and covering for an offense that, in addition to its sloppy play, finished the first frame with minus-2 total net yards. Credit Alabama's defense for keeping this game from spiraling entirely out of control. Michigan gained possession inside Alabama's 10-yard line after a strip-sack of Alabama quarterback Jalen Milroe but the Wolverines were unable to score a touchdown with more advantageous field position. Instead, Michigan kicker Dominic Zvada made his third field goal of the game, this one a kick from 21 yards out. Four plays and three turnovers now for Alabama. This time, quarterback Jalen Milroe came under pressure off the edge when dropping back to pass on first-and-10. Cornerback Amir Hall, who came through on a blitz, got a hand on Milroe's arm and forced the ball loose. Michigan defensive lineman Cameron Brandt was able to recover the fumble and stumbled for a gain of five yards. Now a third straight possession that will start in the red zone for the Wolverines. Michigan finally took full advantage of another Alabama mistake. After kicking field goals on Alabama's first two turnovers -- a failed fourth-down conversion and a fumble -- the Wolverines got the ball in the red zone again thanks to an interception from defensive back Wesley Walker. On third-and-7, quarterback Davis Warren lofted a pass to wide receiver Fredrick Moore, who made a phenomenal toe-tapping catch to secure a 13-yard touchdown. About everything that could go wrong for Alabama thus far has. All three of the Crimson Tide's offensive drives have now ended in a turnover. Quarterback Jalen Milroe just threw a bad interception where he stared down a receiver on an out route and pulled the trigger too late, allowing Michigan defensive back Wesley Walker to hop the route and tip the ball to himself for an interception. This is Michigan's second straight drive that will start in the red zone. Two drives that started with favorable field position and two field goals for Michigan thus far. The Wolverines got the ball in the red zone after Alabama fumbled a snap due to the bad weather. They weren't able to get a ton of yardage with three straight runs and settled for the points with a 30-yard field goal from kicker Dominic Zvada. A smart strategy in a game that may not see a ton of offense due to the conditions. It's absolutely pouring in Tampa Bay. It didn't take long to negatively affect Alabama. On the first play of the Crimson Tide's second drive, Alabama snapped the ball in shotgun formation. Quarterback Jalen Milroe couldn't get a good handle on the wet ball and fumbled it. The loose ball bounced around a bit before ending up in the hands of Michigan's Derrick Moore, who already had a big sack that ended Alabama's first offensive drive. Michigan's defense gave its offense favorable field position with a big sack and the Wolverines were able to capitalize. It didn't take much effort to get into field goal range, given Dominic Zvada's leg, and Michigan did just enough to attempt a 45-yard kick that Zvada nailed in the pouring rain. He's been Michigan's offensive MVP all year and he'll be crucial in what's shaping up to be a very bad weather game. Alabama worked the ball just past the 50-yard line and decided to go for it on fourth-and-4, looking to put some points on the board early. But Michigan's defense, which is going to have to have a big game to keep this one close, was up to the task. Crimson Tide quarterback Jalen Milroe dropped back to pass and immediately came under pressure from Michigan edge rusher Derrick Moore, who bullied the right tackle and sacked Milroe for a big loss. Michigan takes over in Alabama territory, on the edge of kicker Dominic Zvada's field goal range. Michigan won the opening toss and deferred to the second half, which means that Alabama's offense will start with the ball. The Crimson Tide have a good chance to set the tone early against a shorthanded Michigan defense, given that Kalen DeBoer's squad is almost at full strength. That includes quarterback Jalen Milroe, who has yet to make a final NFL Draft decision and, as such, is playing in Tuesday's bowl game. Games between big-time programs are sometimes as simple as effort and participation. Expect that to take center stage. Alabama has a strong culture of showing up for bowl games, winning eight of their last nine -- all except the Rose Bowl against Michigan last season. Don't expect the Tide to waste the opportunity, especially with a chance to reach 10 wins. Pick: Alabama -10.5 Michigan has already secured at least one transfer portal win over Alabama. The Wolverines signed former Crimson Tide defensive lineman Damon Payne, who is a three star in 247Sports' Transfer Rankings. He, obviously, cannot play in the ReliaQuest Bowl, but he is a big add for Michigan's future. Michigan is also the presumed favorite for Alabama transfer running back Justice Haynes, the No. 1 running back in the portal. Haynes has already received two 247Sports Crystal Ball predictions to land at Michigan. He'd be a clear starter in a room that, as outlined below, looks a little depleted entering the 2025 season. Not counting its transfer portal departures, Alabama is expected to be at mostly full strength. Coach Kalen DeBoer said during the head coaches press conference Monday that he hasn't had conversations with any of Alabama's players about opting out. That includes quarterback Jalen Milroe, who is still mulling over his NFL Draft decision. \"I'd be pretty surprised,\" DeBoer said of any opt outs. \"I think they're here to win. To compete. To put the best product we can put out there on the football field for four quarters and go out there. I wouldn't expect something like that.\" Michigan running back Kalel Mullings will not play in the ReliaQuest Bowl as he prepares for the 2025 NFL Draft. Mullings, a former linebacker, had the best season of his college career in 2024, rushing for a team-high 948 yards and 12 touchdowns. Mullings entered the season as the backup behind Donovan Edwards and assumed the role as the Wolverines' bellcow running back just weeks into the season. Edwards also opted out, which leaves the Wolverines short on experienced running backs as they prepare for their showdown against Alabama. That leaves true freshman Jordan Marshall as Michigan's expected RB1. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. CBS Sports is a registered trademark of CBS Broadcasting Inc.

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Michigan earned a huge 19-13 win against No. 11 Alabama in the ReliaQuest Bowl on Tuesday. The shorthanded Wolverines, who were down several key players due to both opt outs and the transfer portal, led wire-to-wire after taking advantage of numerous Alabama mistakes in the first quarter. The Crimson Tide turned the ball over three times -- and had their first offensive drive end with a failed fourth-down conversion -- in the first 15 minutes. That means for its first four possessions Michigan's average starting position was Alabama's 21-yard line. The Wolverines took advantage, even if they left some points on the board. Three of Michigan's first four drives ended in a field goal from kicker Dominic Zvada, two of which came from 30 yards or less. Quarterback Davis Warren, who later exited the game with an apparent leg injury, did hit wide receiver Fredrick Moore for a 13-yard touchdown and Michigan left the first quarter with a 16-0 lead it never surrendered. Alabama had 2 total yards of offense until late in the second quarter when it went on two drives that covered a combined 161 yards and resulted in 10 points. It wasn't enough to spark a full comeback, however. The Crimson Tide actually had a chance to win it late in the fourth quarter. One possession after kicker Graham Nicholson hit a season-long 51-yard field goal which cut Michigan's lead to one possession, Alabama got the ball all the way to Michigan's 15-yard line. But on fourth-and-10, Milroe came under immediate pressure and threw an incomplete pass, which allowed Michigan to take possession and kneel the clock out on a momentum-building bowl victory. That was a common theme for the Wolverines through 2024, especially in their last two wins against Ohio State and Alabama. Michigan didn't play a great game on offense. In fact, after the first quarter, it was largely ineffective. But it did do enough to put the game away. Michigan's shorthanded defense definitely deserves a ton of credit, as the Wolverines held Alabama scoreless for almost three entire quarters, which allowed the offense to sit on their early 16-0 lead. Michigan did employ a smart ball-control strategy to limit Alabama's possessions and, thus, its explosive potential on offense. The Wolverines gained just 32 yards in the third quarter, but they held onto the football for a whopping 10:52 seconds. That took the air out of Alabama's late first-half surge, when it scored 10 unanswered points to cut Michigan's lead to 16-10. Michigan won the time of possession battle by almost 17 minutes, with a lot of its advantage created in that third quarter. That kept the defense fresh and it limited Alabama's window to mount a comeback. Michigan's modern run of success has been keyed, largely, by excellent running back play. The Wolverines have had star players like Blake Corum, Donovan Edwards and Kalel Mullings lead their offense while gashing opposing defenses on the ground. They may have found the next great one in freshman running back Jordan Marshall. Marshall was thrust into a starting role after Mullings and Edwards opted out and he responded with a strong performance, especially after Michigan lost starting quarterback Davis Warren to injury. Marshall carried the ball 23 times for 100 yards, averaging just over four yards per carry against a strong Alabama defense. He had a key 24-yard run early in the fourth quarter, bouncing off of Alabama defenders in the process, to set up Dominic Zvada's decisive 37-yard field goal. Not bad for a true freshman making his first career start. Marshall certainly provided Michigan fans with some optimism about the future of the Wolverines' offense, especially with players like five-star quarterback Bryce Underwood joining the fold moving forward. Alabama quarterback Jalen Milroe still has yet to make a decision on his future. Before Tuesday's bowl game, he was considered an intriguing NFL Draft prospect with plenty of untapped upside and physical traits that would make him a desirable option for front offices, likely in the middle rounds. Now his stock is up in the air. Milroe definitely had his moments in the ReliaQuest Bowl. He had one 41-yard run where he flashed his athleticism and weaved around Michigan defenders to set up Alabama's second scoring drive. He had nice throws of 25 yards to tight end Robbie Ouzts for Alabama's first touchdown of the game, and a deep 40-yard completion to wide receiver Germie Bernard near the end of the second quarter. But, overall, he was largely ineffective. He turned the ball over three times in the first quarter alone. One of those was on a botched snap, and the other was an interception after he mistimed a shallow out route. Milroe also had multiple misses on passes at every level of the field. His pocket awareness was concerning, as he struggled to sense pressure and often held onto the ball for too long. There's a good chance that Milroe still gets drafted if he declares, especially since he's one of the most physically gifted quarterbacks in college football. His lackluster bowl performance left a sour last impression on scouts, though. Or, at the very least, take a late lead. Michigan was gifted a first down thanks to an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty on Alabama linebacker Justin Jefferson, but the Wolverines weren't able to do much more with the free yardage. The Crimson Tide defense, which has been great all day, forced a punt that Alabama's Ryan Williams returned 38 yards to give his team possession on Alabama's 44-yard line. Prime scoring opportunity, though the Tide need a touchdown at this point. We've got some clutch kicking in the ReliaQuest Bowl. Alabama stalled at Michigan's 33-yard line during a crucial drive. Instead of going for it on fourth-and-10, the Crimson Tide sent kicker Graham Nicholson out. He hit his second field goal of the day and set his season high with a 51-yard boot. It had enough power behind it to split the uprights from even further out. Alabama's hanging around. Dominic Zvada, still one of the most important players in college football. It's rare that a college kicker is so reliable, but he has now hit on all four of his field goal attempts in the ReliaQuest Bowl. His latest, from 37 yards out, was the biggest, as it expanded Michigan's lead back to two possessions with 7:21 left to play. Michigan leaned on running back Jordan Marshall, who carried the ball five times, to get into scoring range. He had a nice 24-yard run that moved the ball into Alabama territory. Alabama, which has scoring drives of 71 and 90 yards, was unable to capitalize on its best starting field position of the game after a Zabien Brown interception handed Alabama the ball on the 50-yard line. Alabama quarterback Jalen Milroe almost threw an interception on third-and-7. The Crimson Tide still went for it, and Milroe was late on a pass to Jaylen Mbakwe, who caught the ball out of bounds. Michigan stills holds a narrow lead after three quarters of play. Five drives ended without any points in the third quarter. Four of those resulted in punts, while the fifth was cut short when Michigan quarterback Alex Orji threw an interception to Alabama defensive back Zabien Brown. The biggest news coming out of the third quarter was the fact that Michigan starting quarterback Davis Warren was taken to the locker room with an apparent leg injury. Without Warren, the Wolverines turned to Orji, who hasn't been able to make anything happen on offense. Alabama will start the fourth quarter with a prime opportunity to finally jump into the lead. Brown's interception gave the Tide the ball at the 50-yard line, and a quick 9-yard completion to wide receiver Rico Scott put Alabama in Michigan territory for the first time since the second quarter ended. All 16 of Michigan's points thus far came in the first quarter. Not counting the end of the first half, the Wolverines have punted on five consecutive drives since. They have crossed midfield just once since the first quarter and all four of their first-quarter drives began in plus territory. So that means Michigan's offense has possessed the ball 10 times, but it has made it past the 50-yard line just once. The Wolverines still have yet to gain more than 34 yards in a single drive. Now Alabama is having injury issues of its own. Top linebacker Jihaad Campbell just left the field with an apparent injury after attempting a tackle on Michigan running back Jordan Marshall. He was slow to get up and didn't walk off the field until Alabama's training staff came out to help him. He would be a huge loss fro the Crimson Tide defense, which has played very well today. Michigan's offense is still spinning its wheels after an ineffective drive to open the second half. To make matters worse, starting quarterback Davis Warren appears injured after taking a long sack. Alabama defensive linemen dragged Warren down near the sideline and Warren remained on the turf for a few moments. He initially got up, with the help of teammates, but went back to the ground after taking a few steps. Warren wasn't putting much weight on his right leg, which got bent under him when Smith brough him to the ground. Michigan leads No. 11 Alabama 16-7 at halftime of the ReliaQuest Bowl after the first two quarters felt way more lopsided than the score may indicate. Alabama turned the ball over three times in the first quarter -- and that doesn't include its first drive, which ended in a failed fourth-down conversion -- which gave Michigan three drives that started in the red zone. In spite of that, the Wolverines only found the end zone once in the first half thanks to a 13-yard connection between quarterback Davis Warren and wide receiver Fredrick Moore. Moore, who stepped into a bigger role when Michigan lost its top two receivers entering Tuesday's game, had a nice first half with three catches for 37 yards and the score. Though it took Alabama's offense a long time to find its footing, Michigan's inability to fully capitalize on Alabama's numerous mistakes allowed the Crimson Tide to keep the door open. They captured some late momentum with a four-play, 71-yard drive capped by a 25-yard touchdown connection between quarterback Jalen Milroe and tight end Robbie Ouzts near the end of the second quarter. Prior to that 71-yard scoring drive, Alabama had 2 total yards on offense. The Crimson Tide now enter halftime outgaining Michigan by 54 yards. Michigan's offense needs to figure something out in the second half. The Wolverines, who will receive the kickoff, cannot sit on their lead with Alabama's offense starting to hit its stride. It seemed like Alabama would have been content to run the clock out and enter half time when it gained possession at its own 4-yard line with just 50 seconds left to play and no timeouts. But, on third-and-1, Michigan inexplicably saved some clock for the Crimson Tide by calling a timeout. Then quarterback Jalen Milroe ripped off a 41-yard run, and hit wide receiver Germie Bernard for a gain of 40 yards, which put the Crimson Tide in prime scoring position. Kicker Graham Nicholson eventually ate into Michigan's lead with a 24-yard field goal. It took over 25 minutes, but Alabama's offense finally looks like itself. The Crimson Tide just battled back into this game with an easy 71-yard drive, marching down the field in just four plays to score their first touchdown of the game. Freshman wide receiver Rico Scott got things started with a 28-yard gain on a jet sweep play. Alabama then gained a combined 15 yards on a tight end screen that Josh Cuevas fumbled. Offensive lineman Elijah Pritchett recovered the ball and rumbled for another eight yards. Then, a couple plays later, Alabama quarterback Jalen Milroe hit a wide open Robbie Ouzts for a 25-yard touchdown. The only positive thing to say for Alabama's offense thus far is that it has now gone two straight possessions without a turnover. Both of those drives still ended in a punt, though. The Crimson Tide have more turnovers (3) than total yards (2). Their offense totals are being dragged down by their minus 16 yards rushing. Alabama quarterback Jalen Milroe has already been sacked three times, and Alabama's running backs have combined for 11 yards on five carries. Milroe, who was responsible for all three turnovers, is having a rough game. Outside of the mistakes, he's also been inaccurate passing the ball thus far and had a couple misses on Alabama's latest drive that forced it into another punt. Alabama's defense has played well thus far, and it just got a much-needed stop after the Crimson Tide punted for the first time. Michigan gained 24 yards in eight plays and took five minutes off the clock but, ultimately, had to punt short of the 50-yard line after a rush attempt was stoned on third-and-8. Alabama returner Ryan Williams decided to field the punt at Alabama's 16-yard line and was tackled immediately, which means that the Crimson Tide will, once again, start with unfavorable field position. The ReliaQuest Bowl really couldn't be going much worse for Alabama thus far. The Crimson Tide turned the ball over three times and had another drive end with a failed fourth-down conversion in the first quarter. One of those turnovers was an entirely unforced error when quarterback Jalen Milroe fumbled the ball on a botched snap exchange. That was the first of two fumbles for Milroe, who also had an interception. Even with all of that, Michigan wasn't able to exit the first quarter with a completely decisive lead. All four of Michigan's drives started in Alabama territory with the average start at Alabama's 21-yard line, but Michigan still came out with three field goals courtesy of kicker Dominic Zvada. Alabama's defense is keeping the Tide in this game and covering for an offense that, in addition to its sloppy play, finished the first frame with minus-2 total net yards. Credit Alabama's defense for keeping this game from spiraling entirely out of control. Michigan gained possession inside Alabama's 10-yard line after a strip-sack of Alabama quarterback Jalen Milroe but the Wolverines were unable to score a touchdown with more advantageous field position. Instead, Michigan kicker Dominic Zvada made his third field goal of the game, this one a kick from 21 yards out. Four plays and three turnovers now for Alabama. This time, quarterback Jalen Milroe came under pressure off the edge when dropping back to pass on first-and-10. Cornerback Amir Hall, who came through on a blitz, got a hand on Milroe's arm and forced the ball loose. Michigan defensive lineman Cameron Brandt was able to recover the fumble and stumbled for a gain of five yards. Now a third straight possession that will start in the red zone for the Wolverines. Michigan finally took full advantage of another Alabama mistake. After kicking field goals on Alabama's first two turnovers -- a failed fourth-down conversion and a fumble -- the Wolverines got the ball in the red zone again thanks to an interception from defensive back Wesley Walker. On third-and-7, quarterback Davis Warren lofted a pass to wide receiver Fredrick Moore, who made a phenomenal toe-tapping catch to secure a 13-yard touchdown. About everything that could go wrong for Alabama thus far has. All three of the Crimson Tide's offensive drives have now ended in a turnover. Quarterback Jalen Milroe just threw a bad interception where he stared down a receiver on an out route and pulled the trigger too late, allowing Michigan defensive back Wesley Walker to hop the route and tip the ball to himself for an interception. This is Michigan's second straight drive that will start in the red zone. Two drives that started with favorable field position and two field goals for Michigan thus far. The Wolverines got the ball in the red zone after Alabama fumbled a snap due to the bad weather. They weren't able to get a ton of yardage with three straight runs and settled for the points with a 30-yard field goal from kicker Dominic Zvada. A smart strategy in a game that may not see a ton of offense due to the conditions. It's absolutely pouring in Tampa Bay. It didn't take long to negatively affect Alabama. On the first play of the Crimson Tide's second drive, Alabama snapped the ball in shotgun formation. Quarterback Jalen Milroe couldn't get a good handle on the wet ball and fumbled it. The loose ball bounced around a bit before ending up in the hands of Michigan's Derrick Moore, who already had a big sack that ended Alabama's first offensive drive. Michigan's defense gave its offense favorable field position with a big sack and the Wolverines were able to capitalize. It didn't take much effort to get into field goal range, given Dominic Zvada's leg, and Michigan did just enough to attempt a 45-yard kick that Zvada nailed in the pouring rain. He's been Michigan's offensive MVP all year and he'll be crucial in what's shaping up to be a very bad weather game. Alabama worked the ball just past the 50-yard line and decided to go for it on fourth-and-4, looking to put some points on the board early. But Michigan's defense, which is going to have to have a big game to keep this one close, was up to the task. Crimson Tide quarterback Jalen Milroe dropped back to pass and immediately came under pressure from Michigan edge rusher Derrick Moore, who bullied the right tackle and sacked Milroe for a big loss. Michigan takes over in Alabama territory, on the edge of kicker Dominic Zvada's field goal range. Michigan won the opening toss and deferred to the second half, which means that Alabama's offense will start with the ball. The Crimson Tide have a good chance to set the tone early against a shorthanded Michigan defense, given that Kalen DeBoer's squad is almost at full strength. That includes quarterback Jalen Milroe, who has yet to make a final NFL Draft decision and, as such, is playing in Tuesday's bowl game. Games between big-time programs are sometimes as simple as effort and participation. Expect that to take center stage. Alabama has a strong culture of showing up for bowl games, winning eight of their last nine -- all except the Rose Bowl against Michigan last season. Don't expect the Tide to waste the opportunity, especially with a chance to reach 10 wins. Pick: Alabama -10.5 Michigan has already secured at least one transfer portal win over Alabama. The Wolverines signed former Crimson Tide defensive lineman Damon Payne, who is a three star in 247Sports' Transfer Rankings. He, obviously, cannot play in the ReliaQuest Bowl, but he is a big add for Michigan's future. Michigan is also the presumed favorite for Alabama transfer running back Justice Haynes, the No. 1 running back in the portal. Haynes has already received two 247Sports Crystal Ball predictions to land at Michigan. He'd be a clear starter in a room that, as outlined below, looks a little depleted entering the 2025 season. Not counting its transfer portal departures, Alabama is expected to be at mostly full strength. Coach Kalen DeBoer said during the head coaches press conference Monday that he hasn't had conversations with any of Alabama's players about opting out. That includes quarterback Jalen Milroe, who is still mulling over his NFL Draft decision. \"I'd be pretty surprised,\" DeBoer said of any opt outs. \"I think they're here to win. To compete. To put the best product we can put out there on the football field for four quarters and go out there. I wouldn't expect something like that.\" Michigan running back Kalel Mullings will not play in the ReliaQuest Bowl as he prepares for the 2025 NFL Draft. Mullings, a former linebacker, had the best season of his college career in 2024, rushing for a team-high 948 yards and 12 touchdowns. Mullings entered the season as the backup behind Donovan Edwards and assumed the role as the Wolverines' bellcow running back just weeks into the season. Edwards also opted out, which leaves the Wolverines short on experienced running backs as they prepare for their showdown against Alabama. That leaves true freshman Jordan Marshall as Michigan's expected RB1. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. CBS Sports is a registered trademark of CBS Broadcasting Inc.

                "content": "Michigan football ended the calendar year like it started by beating Alabama in a bowl game. Michigan (8-5) held on to beat Alabama (9-4) 19-13 in the ReliaQuest Bowl in Tampa, Florida, on New Year's Eve to end the 2024 season. Michigan bookended 2024 by beating Alabama in two bowl games, with the first coming Jan. 1 in the Rose Bowl in the College Football Playoff semifinals. The stakes were much lower for this meeting with no national championship berth on the line. Michigan forced three turnovers and a turnover on downs on Alabama's first four possessions during a rain-filled first quarter, leading to an early 16-0 lead. Michigan's offense struggled to get anything going, and Alabama cobbled a comeback with a few nice drives to make it 16-10, but Dominic Zvada's fourth field goal late pushed the game out of reach. Michigan held Alabama to 260 yards with three forced turnovers and three turnover on downs leading to all 19 of the Wolverines' points. The defense had a dominant day, led by defensive end Derrick Moore with two sacks and a fumble recovery. Michigan had players sitting out and lost quarterback Davis Warren to a knee injury in the win over the Crimson Tide. 2025 RESOLUTIONS:Bryce Underwood vs Mikey Keene is Michigan football's new QB battle The Wolverines were not at full strength with prospective top draft picks like defensive tackle Mason Graham and tight end Colston Loveland opting out while the Crimson Tide played their starters. Michigan's defense finished the game with a red zone stop to put a cap on a dominant performance. Alabama connected on an 11-yard pass to Germie Bernard and 25-yard screen to Jamarion Miller to reach Michigan's 15-yard line. But Michigan forced four straight incompletions from there to force a turnover on downs and win the game with the defense. Milroe had a man open on fourth down, but had to roll out to his left and throw across-the-body to Rico Scott while Rayshaun Benny was bearing down, and the pass fell short. Michigan held Alabama to 260 yards with three forced turnovers and three turnover on downs leading to all 19 of the Wolverines' points. Michigan's offense could not keep a drive alive. Alabama's Justin Jefferson picked up an unsportsmanlike conduct on the first play for throwing a punch in a pile of players, but that's the only yards Michigan picked up. The Wolverines had three runs go for 2 yards on the next set of downs, leading to a punt. Ryan Williams fielded Hudson Holbeck's kick at Alabama's 5, but used his speed to get to the sideline and returned it to the Crimson Tide 44. Alabama picked up a pair of first downs on the ground to reach Michigan territory. Jalen Milroe chucked it deep the next play and was way off the mark, but linebacker Jaishawn Barham was flagged for roughing the passer for a hit to the head to keep the drive alive. Alabama couldn't take advantage and picked up zero yards the next three plays before kicking a 51-yard field goal to cut the deficit to six. Can Michigan's offense salt the game away with one final successful drive? Michigan just executed its longest drive of the game — nine plays, 47 yards, two first downs — to push the lead to two possessions late. Freshman running back Jordan Marshall had five carries for 35 yards on the drive, including a 24-yard rumble with a few broken tackles, to put Michigan in field goal range. He picked up 9 yards on third-and-10, but Michigan opted for a 37-yard field goal to go up by nine instead of going for it. Marshall has put together a nice claim to be Michigan's lead running back in 2025 with Kalel Mullings and Donovan Edwards sitting out. He has 98 yards on 21 carries and has accounted for over half of the Wolverines' total yardage (188). The offensive struggles continue for Alabama. The Crimson Tide kept the offense on the field for fourth-and-7 from the Michigan 34, but Jalen Milroe's sideline pass to Kobe Prentice was a few inches off and fell incomplete. Alabama has just 39 yards and two first downs in the second half. Michigan's defense has dominated. ESPN's broadcast showed injured quarterback Davis Warren on the sidelines out of uniform and on crutches. He is officially out with a knee injury. It's not like they were exactly humming before, but Alex Orji has not been able to move Michigan's offense down the field after taking over for Davis Warren. Michigan went three-and-out on the first full possession led by Orji due to a personal foul against Hogan Hansen. On the next drive, Jordan Marshall picked up one first down with a pair of runs before Michigan decided to air it out, but Orji rolled out and threw it into the arms of Brown, who jumped the route. The Wolverines suffered a significant injury on the first drive of the second half. On third-and-long, Warren tried to extend the play by getting out of the pocket but got pulled down by James Smith for a sack. Warren stayed on the ground and was helped off the field by trainers without putting weight on one of his legs. Alabama received a team penalty for players running on the field in celebration after the hit, extending the drive, but Michigan still had to punt after Alex Orji took over. The Wolverines offense remained stuck in first gear and had to punt the ball back to Alabama with less than a minute. Alabama had it at its own 4-yard line, but ripped off back-to-back 40-yard gains on a completion to Germie Bernard and a Jalen Milroe run to instantly reach the red zone. Michigan's defense stood tall after the sudden switch of field and held the Crimson Tide to a field goal. The offense was putrid between both teams in the first half. Alabama outgained Michigan 163-109 but trail due to three turnovers and a failed fourth down in the first quarter. Michigan's first four drives started in Alabama territory, including three starting in Alabama's red zone, but only produced 16 points with three field goals. After the sloppy fireworks of the first quarter, the second quarter turned into a grind. After both teams traded a pair of punts, Alabama finally found a modicum of offensive success. The Crimson Tide drove 71 yards in four plays, ending with a 25-yard touchdown pass to Outzs along the sideline. Rico Scott started the drive with a 25-yard run, followed by two runs totaling 10 yards to set up the touchdown pass. The Wolverines went nowhere after the fumble set the offense up inside the 10-yard line. Michigan had three runs for a total of three yards before settling for a chip shot from Zvada to go up by 16. Alabama is up to three turnovers in their last four plays and two on consecutive opening plays of a drive. Michigan brought a cornerback blitz with Hall, who beat his blocker and hit Milroe's arm as he cocked to throw. The ball was jarred loose and Cameron Brandt scooped it up and returned it to Alabama's 6-yard line. This time, the turnover turned into a touchdown for Michigan. On second down, quarterback Davis Warren threw a well-placed fade to the corner of the end zone intended for Moore, and the receiver turned through contact to make the catch and got one foot in bounds for a touchdown. It was Moore's first receiving touchdown of the season. Alabama may have all of its starters playing, but it sure does seem like the offense has opted out. The Crimson Tide turned it over for the third time on their third offensive possession after Walker undercut an out route from Milroe for an interception returned to Alabama's 16-yard line. Michigan only has 27 yards of offense, but also three red zone trips thanks to Alabama's giveaways. Michigan's kicker may be the only man in Tampa not too impacted by the rain. Michigan's offense went nowhere after the turnover, but Zvada stepped up to easily knock in a second field goal to push Michigan's lead to six. Mother Nature is proving once again to be undefeated. The rain considerably picked up after Michigan's field goal, and Alabama fumbled their first offensive snap after the weather shift. Jalen Milroe had the ball pop right through his hands and Derrick Moore was there to pounce on it at Alabama's 19-yard line. Michigan took the lead thanks to the reliable leg of Dominic Zvada, who easily hit the 45-yarder in rainy conditions in Tampa. The Wolverines picked up one first down on a completion to Hogan Hansen, but a failed double pass led to a fumble and 13-yard loss from Kendrick Bell the next play. Michigan couldn't make up the yardage and had to settle for a kick off of the turnover. Michigan's defense came up with a big stop on the opening possession. Alabama opted to go for it on fourth-and-4 from Michigan's 45-yard line, but the pocket collapsed immediately thanks to two strong rushes from the outside and Moore reached out an arm to pull down Milroe. Michigan's offense takes over in Alabama territory. Alabama is not expected to have any opt-outs, outside of the players who entered the portal. Michigan will be without cornerback Will Johnson, defensive tackles Mason Graham and Kenneth Grant, defensive end Josaiah Stewart, tight end Colston Loveland, running backs Kalel Mullings and Donovan Edwards and left tackle Myles Hinton. Michigan: Out with injury: QB Jack Tuttle (retired), DB Rod Moore (ACL), DB Ja'Den McBurrows (undisclosed), S Makari Paige (knee, opted out). Left via transfer portal: WR Tyler Morris, RB Tavierre Dunlap, OL Tristan Bounds, OL Raheem Anderson, P Tommy Doman, OL Dominick Giudice, WR Logan Forbes, RB Cole Cabana, LB Christian Boivin, EDGE Breeon Ishmail, QB Jayden Denegal, LB Micah Pollard, DB Myles Pollard, K Adam Samaha, OL Andrew Gentry. Alabama: Out with injury: DB Malachi Moore, LB Que Robinson, WR Cole Adams, LB Deontae Lawson, DB Keon Sabb. Left via transfer portal: RB Justice Haynes, DL Damon Payne, WR Caleb Odom, WR Kendrick Law, WR Kobe Prentice, DL Hunter Osborne, WR Emmanuel Henderson Jr., OL Miles McVay, QB Dylan Lonergan, OL Naquil Betrand, DL Jahiem Oatis, LB Keanu Koht, DB DeVonta Smith, DB Jahlil Hurley. Tony Garcia, Detroit Free Press: The Wolverines matched the Crimson Tide talent-wise when they met on the first day of 2024. On the last day, U-M will be playing without 18 players from that squad, plus 10 more who starred this season. The attrition has reached critical mass and, frankly, keeping this close would be a pretty impressive feat. A win? That would be shocking ... almost as much as November's win over then-No. 2 Ohio State. U-M can move into the offseason with confidence, no matter what happens in this game. Remember that.

                "content": "NAIA: NJCAA: College football (French: football universitaire) is gridiron football that is played by teams of amateur student-athletes at universities and colleges. It was through collegiate competition that gridiron football first gained popularity in the United States. Like gridiron football generally, college football is most popular in the United States and Canada. While no single governing body exists for college football in the United States, most schools, especially those at the highest levels of play, are members of the NCAA. In Canada, collegiate football competition is governed by U Sports for universities. The Canadian Collegiate Athletic Association (for colleges) governs soccer and other sports but not gridiron football. Other countries, such as Mexico, Japan and South Korea, also host college football leagues with modest levels of support. Unlike most other major sports in North America, no official minor league farm organizations exist for American football or Canadian football. Therefore, college football is generally considered to be the second tier of American and Canadian football; ahead of high school competition, but below professional competition. In some parts of the United States, especially the South and Midwest, college football is more popular than professional football.[2] For much of the 20th century, college football was generally considered to be more prestigious than professional football.[citation needed] The overwhelming majority of professional football players in the NFL and other leagues previously played college football. The NFL draft each spring sees 224 players selected and offered a contract to play in the league, with the vast majority coming from the NCAA. Other professional leagues, such as the CFL and UFL, additionally hold their own drafts each year which also see primarily college players selected. Players who are not selected can still attempt to obtain a professional roster spot as an undrafted free agent. Despite these opportunities, only around 1.6% of NCAA college football players end up playing professionally in the NFL.[3] Even after the emergence of the professional National Football League (NFL), college football has remained extremely popular throughout the U.S.[4] Although the college game has a much larger margin for talent than its pro counterpart, the sheer number of fans following major colleges provides a financial equalizer for the game, with Division I programs – the highest level – playing in huge stadiums, six of which have seating capacity exceeding 100,000 people.[5] In many cases, college stadiums employ bench-style seating, as opposed to individual seats with backs and arm rests (although many stadiums do have a small number of chair back seats in addition to the bench seating). This allows them to seat more fans in a given amount of space than the typical professional stadium, which tends to have more features and comforts for fans. Only three stadiums owned by U.S. colleges or universities, L&N Stadium at the University of Louisville, Center Parc Stadium at Georgia State University, and FAU Stadium at Florida Atlantic University, consist entirely of chair back seating. College athletes, unlike players in the NFL, are not permitted by the NCAA to be paid salaries. Colleges are only allowed to provide non-monetary compensation such as athletic scholarships that provide for tuition, housing, and books. With new bylaws made by the NCAA, college athletes can now receive \"name, image, and likeness\" (NIL) deals, a way to get sponsorships and money before their pro debut.[6] Modern North American football has its origins in various games, all known as \"football\", played at public schools in Great Britain in the mid-19th century. By the 1840s, students at Rugby School were playing a game in which players were able to pick up the ball and run with it, a sport later known as rugby football. The game was taken to Canada by British soldiers stationed there and was soon being played at Canadian colleges. The first documented gridiron football game was played at University College, a college of the University of Toronto, on November 9, 1861. One of the participants in the game involving University of Toronto students was William Mulock, later chancellor of the school. A football club was formed at the university soon afterward, although its rules of play then are unclear. In 1864, at Trinity College, also a college of the University of Toronto, F. Barlow Cumberland and Frederick A. Bethune devised rules based on rugby football. Modern Canadian football is widely regarded as having originated with a game played in Montreal, in 1865, when British Army officers played local civilians. The game gradually gained a following, and the Montreal Football Club was formed in 1868, the first recorded non-university football club in Canada. Early games appear to have had much in common with the traditional \"mob football\" played in Great Britain. The games remained largely unorganized until the 19th century, when intramural games of football began to be played on college campuses. Each school played its own variety of football. Princeton University students played a game called \"ballown\" as early as 1820. In 1827, a Harvard tradition known as \"Bloody Monday\" began, which consisted of a mass ballgame between the freshman and sophomore classes. In 1860, both the town police and the college authorities agreed the Bloody Monday had to go. Harvard students responded by going into mourning for a mock figure called \"Football Fightum\", for whom they conducted funeral rites. The authorities held firm, and it was another dozen years before football was once again played at Harvard. Dartmouth played its own version called \"Old division football\", the rules of which were first published in 1871, though the game dates to at least the 1830s. All of these games, and others, shared certain commonalities. They remained largely \"mob\" style games, with huge numbers of players attempting to advance the ball into a goal area, often by any means necessary. Rules were simple, and violence and injury were common.[7][8] The violence of these mob-style games led to widespread protests and a decision to abandon them. Yale, under pressure from the city of New Haven, banned the play of all forms of football in 1860.[7] American football historian Parke H. Davis described the period between 1869 and 1875 as the 'Pioneer Period'; the years 1876–93 he called the 'Period of the American Intercollegiate Football Association'; and the years 1894–1933 he dubbed the \"Period of Rules Committees and Conferences\".[9] On November 6, 1869, Rutgers University faced Princeton University, then known as the College of New Jersey, in the first collegiate football game. The game more closely resembled soccer than football as it is played in the 21st century. It was played with a round ball, and used a set of rules suggested by Rutgers captain William J. Leggett, based on The Football Association's first set of rules, which were an early attempt by the former pupils of England's public schools, to unify the rules of their various public schools.[7][10][11][12] The game was played at a Rutgers Field in New Brunswick, New Jersey. Two teams of 25 players attempted to score by kicking the ball into the opposing team's goal. Throwing or carrying the ball was not allowed, but there was plenty of physical contact between players. The first team to reach six goals was declared the winner. Rutgers won by a score of six to four. A rematch was played at Princeton a week later under Princeton's own set of rules (one notable difference was the awarding of a \"free kick\" to any player that caught the ball on the fly, which was a feature adopted from The Football Association's rules; the fair catch kick rule has survived through to modern American game). Princeton won that game by a score of 8 – 0. Columbia joined the series in 1870 and by 1872 several schools were fielding intercollegiate teams, including Yale and Stevens Institute of Technology.[7] Columbia University was the third school to field a team. The Lions traveled from New York City to New Brunswick on November 12, 1870, and were defeated by Rutgers 6 to 3. The game suffered from disorganization and the players kicked and battled each other as much as the ball. Later in 1870, Princeton and Rutgers played again with Princeton defeating Rutgers 6–0. This game's violence caused such an outcry that no games at all were played in 1871. Football came back in 1872, when Columbia played Yale for the first time. The Yale team was coached and captained by David Schley Schaff, who had learned to play football while attending Rugby School. Schaff himself was injured and unable to play the game, but Yale won the game 3–0 nonetheless. Later in 1872, Stevens Tech became the fifth school to field a team. Stevens lost to Columbia, but beat both New York University and City College of New York during the following year. By 1873, the college students playing football had made significant efforts to standardize their fledgling game. Teams had been scaled down from 25 players to 20. The only way to score was still to bat or kick the ball through the opposing team's goal, and the game was played in two 45-minute halves on fields 140 yards long and 70 yards wide. On October 20, 1873, representatives from Yale, Columbia, Princeton, and Rutgers met at the Fifth Avenue Hotel in New York City to codify the first set of intercollegiate football rules. Before this meeting, each school had its own set of rules and games were usually played using the home team's own particular code. At this meeting, a list of rules, based more on the Football Association's rules than the rules of the recently founded Rugby Football Union, was drawn up for intercollegiate football games.[7] Old \"Football Fightum\" had been resurrected at Harvard in 1872, when Harvard resumed playing football. Harvard, however, preferred to play a rougher version of football called \"the Boston Game\" in which the kicking of a round ball was the most prominent feature though a player could run with the ball, pass it, or dribble it (known as \"babying\"). The man with the ball could be tackled, although hitting, tripping, \"hacking\" and other unnecessary roughness was prohibited. There was no limit to the number of players, but there were typically ten to fifteen per side. A player could carry the ball only when being pursued. As a result of this, Harvard refused to attend the rules conference organized by Rutgers, Princeton and Columbia at the Fifth Avenue Hotel in New York City on October 20, 1873, to agree on a set of rules and regulations that would allow them to play a form of football that was essentially Association football; and continued to play under its own code. While Harvard's voluntary absence from the meeting made it hard for them to schedule games against other American universities, it agreed to a challenge to play the rugby team of McGill University, from Montreal, in a two-game series. It was agreed that two games would be played on Harvard's Jarvis baseball field in Cambridge, Massachusetts on May 14 and 15, 1874: one to be played under Harvard rules, another under the stricter rugby regulations of McGill. Jarvis Field was at the time a patch of land at the northern point of the Harvard campus, bordered by Everett and Jarvis Streets to the north and south, and Oxford Street and Massachusetts Avenue to the east and west. Harvard beat McGill in the \"Boston Game\" on the Thursday and held McGill to a 0–0 tie on the Friday. The Harvard students took to the rugby rules and adopted them as their own,[7][13][14] The games featured a round ball instead of a rugby-style oblong ball.[14] This series of games represents an important milestone in the development of the modern game of American football.[15][16] In October 1874, the Harvard team once again traveled to Montreal to play McGill in rugby, where they won by three tries. In as much as Rugby football had been transplanted to Canada from England, the McGill team played under a set of rules which allowed a player to pick up the ball and run with it whenever he wished. Another rule, unique to McGill, was to count tries (the act of grounding the football past the opposing team's goal line; there was no end zone during this time), as well as goals, in the scoring. In the Rugby rules of the time, a try only provided the attempt to kick a free goal from the field. If the kick was missed, the try did not score any points itself. Harvard quickly took a liking to the rugby game, and its use of the try which, until that time, was not used in American football. The try would later evolve into the score known as the touchdown. On June 4, 1875, Harvard faced Tufts University in the first game between two American colleges played under rules similar to the McGill/Harvard contest, which was won by Tufts 1–0.[17] The rules included each side fielding 11 men at any given time, the ball was advanced by kicking or carrying it, and tackles of the ball carrier stopped play – actions of which have carried over to the modern version of football played today.[18] Harvard later challenged its closest rival, Yale, to which the Bulldogs accepted. The two teams agreed to play under a set of rules called the \"Concessionary Rules\", which involved Harvard conceding something to Yale's soccer and Yale conceding a great deal to Harvard's rugby. They decided to play with 15 players on each team. On November 13, 1875, Yale and Harvard played each other for the first time ever, where Harvard won 4–0. At the first The Game (as the annual contest between Harvard and Yale came to be named) the future \"father of American football\" Walter Camp was among the 2000 spectators in attendance. Walter, a native of New Britain, Connecticut, would enroll at Yale the next year. He was torn between an admiration for Harvard's style of play and the misery of the Yale defeat, and became determined to avenge Yale's defeat. Spectators from Princeton also carried the game back home, where it quickly became the most popular version of football.[7] On November 23, 1876, representatives from Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Columbia met at the Massasoit House hotel in Springfield, Massachusetts to standardize a new code of rules based on the rugby game first introduced to Harvard by McGill University in 1874. Three of the schools—Harvard, Columbia, and Princeton—formed the Intercollegiate Football Association, as a result of the meeting. Yale initially refused to join this association because of a disagreement over the number of players to be allowed per team (relenting in 1879) and Rutgers were not invited to the meeting. The rules that they agreed upon were essentially those of rugby union at the time with the exception that points be awarded for scoring a try, not just the conversion afterwards (extra point). Incidentally, rugby was to make a similar change to its scoring system 10 years later.[19] Walter Camp is widely considered to be the most important figure in the development of American football.[10][11][19] As a youth, he excelled in sports like track, baseball, and association football, and after enrolling at Yale in 1876, he earned varsity honors in every sport the school offered.[19] Following the introduction of rugby-style rules to American football, Camp became a fixture at the Massasoit House conventions where rules were debated and changed. Dissatisfied with what seemed to him to be a disorganized mob, he proposed his first rule change at the first meeting he attended in 1878: a reduction from fifteen players to eleven. The motion was rejected at that time but passed in 1880. The effect was to open up the game and emphasize speed over strength. Camp's most famous change, the establishment of the line of scrimmage and the snap from center to quarterback, was also passed in 1880. Originally, the snap was executed with the foot of the center. Later changes made it possible to snap the ball with the hands, either through the air or by a direct hand-to-hand pass.[19] Rugby league followed Camp's example, and in 1906 introduced the play-the-ball rule, which greatly resembled Camp's early scrimmage and center-snap rules. In 1966, rugby league introduced a four-tackle rule (changed in 1972 to a six-tackle rule) based on Camp's early down-and-distance rules. Camp's new scrimmage rules revolutionized the game, though not always as intended. Princeton, in particular, used scrimmage play to slow the game, making incremental progress towards the end zone during each down. Rather than increase scoring, which had been Camp's original intent, the rule was exploited to maintain control of the ball for the entire game, resulting in slow, unexciting contests. At the 1882 rules meeting, Camp proposed that a team be required to advance the ball a minimum of five yards within three downs. These down-and-distance rules, combined with the establishment of the line of scrimmage, transformed the game from a variation of rugby football into the distinct sport of American football.[19] Camp was central to several more significant rule changes that came to define American football. In 1881, the field was reduced in size to its modern dimensions of 120 by 531⁄3 yards (109.7 by 48.8 meters). Several times in 1883, Camp tinkered with the scoring rules, finally arriving at four points for a touchdown, two points for kicks after touchdowns, two points for safeties, and five for field goals. Camp's innovations in the area of point scoring influenced rugby union's move to point scoring in 1890.[citation needed] In 1887, game time was set at two-halves of 45 minutes each. Also in 1887, two paid officials—a referee and an umpire—were mandated for each game. A year later, the rules were changed to allow tackling below the waist, and in 1889, the officials were given whistles and stopwatches.[19] After leaving Yale in 1882, Camp was employed by the New Haven Clock Company until his death in 1925. Though no longer a player, he remained a fixture at annual rules meetings for most of his life, and he personally selected an annual All-American team every year from 1889 through 1924. The Walter Camp Football Foundation continues to select All-American teams in his honor.[20] College football expanded greatly during the last two decades of the 19th century. Several major rivalries date from this time period. November 1890 was an active time in the sport. In Baldwin City, Kansas, on November 22, 1890, college football was first played in the state of Kansas. Baker beat Kansas 22–9.[22] On the 27th, Vanderbilt played Nashville (Peabody) at Athletic Park and won 40–0. It was the first time organized football played in the state of Tennessee.[23] The 29th also saw the first instance of the Army–Navy Game. Navy won 24–0. Rutgers was first to extend the reach of the game. An intercollegiate game was first played in the state of New York when Rutgers played Columbia on November 2, 1872. It was also the first scoreless tie in the history of the fledgling sport.[24] Yale football starts the same year and has its first match against Columbia, the nearest college to play football. It took place at Hamilton Park in New Haven and was the first game in New England. The game was essentially soccer with 20-man sides, played on a field 400 by 250 feet. Yale wins 3–0, Tommy Sherman scoring the first goal and Lew Irwin the other two.[25] After the first game against Harvard, Tufts took its squad to Bates College in Lewiston, Maine for the first football game played in Maine.[26] This occurred on November 6, 1875. Penn's Athletic Association was looking to pick \"a twenty\" to play a game of football against Columbia. This \"twenty\" never played Columbia, but did play twice against Princeton.[27] Princeton won both games 6 to 0. The first of these happened on November 11, 1876, in Philadelphia and was the first intercollegiate game in the state of Pennsylvania. Brown entered the intercollegiate game in 1878.[28] The first game where one team scored over 100 points happened on October 25, 1884, when Yale routed Dartmouth 113–0. It was also the first time one team scored over 100 points and the opposing team was shut out.[29] The next week, Princeton outscored Lafayette 140 to 0.[30] The first intercollegiate game in the state of Vermont happened on November 6, 1886, between Dartmouth and Vermont at Burlington, Vermont. Dartmouth won 91 to 0.[31] Penn State played its first season in 1887,[32] but had no head coach for their first five years, from 1887 to 1891.[32] The teams played its home games on the Old Main lawn on campus in State College, Pennsylvania. They compiled a 12–8–1 record in these seasons, playing as an independent from 1887 to 1890. In 1891, the Pennsylvania Intercollegiate Football Association (PIFA) was formed. It consisted of Bucknell University, Dickinson College, Franklin & Marshall College, Haverford College, Penn State, and Swarthmore College. Lafayette College, and Lehigh University were excluded because it was felt they would dominate the Association. Penn State won the championship with a 4–1–0 record. Bucknell's record was 3–1–1 (losing to Franklin & Marshall and tying Dickinson). The Association was dissolved prior to the 1892 season.[32] The first nighttime football game was played in Mansfield, Pennsylvania on September 28, 1892, between Mansfield State Normal and Wyoming Seminary and ended at halftime in a 0–0 tie.[33] The Army–Navy game of 1893 saw the first documented use of a football helmet by a player in a game. Joseph M. Reeves had a crude leather helmet made by a shoemaker in Annapolis and wore it in the game after being warned by his doctor that he risked death if he continued to play football after suffering an earlier kick to the head.[34] In 1879, the University of Michigan became the first school west of Pennsylvania to establish a college football team. On May 30, 1879, Michigan beat Racine College 1–0 in a game played in Chicago. The Chicago Daily Tribune called it \"the first rugby-football game to be played west of the Alleghenies.\"[35] Other Midwestern schools soon followed suit, including the University of Chicago, Northwestern University, and the University of Minnesota. The first western team to travel east was the 1881 Michigan team, which played at Harvard, Yale and Princeton.[36][37] The nation's first college football league, the Intercollegiate Conference of Faculty Representatives (also known as the Western Conference), a precursor to the Big Ten Conference, was founded in 1895.[38] Led by coach Fielding H. Yost, Michigan became the first \"western\" national power. From 1901 to 1905, Michigan had a 56-game undefeated streak that included a 1902 trip to play in the first college football bowl game, which later became the Rose Bowl Game. During this streak, Michigan scored 2,831 points while allowing only 40.[39] Organized intercollegiate football was first played in the state of Minnesota on September 30, 1882, when Hamline was convinced to play Minnesota. Minnesota won 2 to 0.[40] It was the first game west of the Mississippi River. November 30, 1905, saw Chicago defeat Michigan 2 to 0. Dubbed \"The First Greatest Game of the Century\",[41] it broke Michigan's 56-game unbeaten streak and marked the end of the \"Point-a-Minute\" years. Organized collegiate football was first played in the state of Virginia and the south on November 2, 1873, in Lexington between Washington and Lee and VMI. Washington and Lee won 4–2.[42] Some industrious students of the two schools organized a game for October 23, 1869, but it was rained out.[43] Students of the University of Virginia were playing pickup games of the kicking-style of football as early as 1870, and some accounts even claim it organized a game against Washington and Lee College in 1871; but no record has been found of the score of this contest. Due to scantiness of records of the prior matches some will claim Virginia v. Pantops Academy November 13, 1887, as the first game in Virginia. On April 9, 1880, at Stoll Field, Transylvania University (then called Kentucky University) beat Centre College by the score of 13+3⁄4–0 in what is often considered the first recorded game played in the South.[44] The first game of \"scientific football\" in the South was the first instance of the Victory Bell rivalry between North Carolina and Duke (then known as Trinity College) held on Thanksgiving Day, 1888, at the North Carolina State Fairgrounds in Raleigh, North Carolina.[45] On November 13, 1887, the Virginia Cavaliers and Pantops Academy fought to a scoreless tie in the first organized football game in the state of Virginia.[46] Students at UVA were playing pickup games of the kicking-style of football as early as 1870, and some accounts even claim that some industrious ones organized a game against Washington and Lee College in 1871, just two years after Rutgers and Princeton's historic first game in 1869. But no record has been found of the score of this contest. Washington and Lee also claims a 4 to 2 win over VMI in 1873.[42] On October 18, 1888, the Wake Forest Demon Deacons defeated the North Carolina Tar Heels 6 to 4 in the first intercollegiate game in the state of North Carolina.[47] On December 14, 1889, Wofford defeated Furman 5 to 1 in the first intercollegiate game in the state of South Carolina. The game featured no uniforms, no positions, and the rules were formulated before the game.[48] January 30, 1892, saw the first football game played in the Deep South when the Georgia Bulldogs defeated Mercer 50–0 at Herty Field. The beginnings of the contemporary Southeastern Conference and Atlantic Coast Conference start in 1894. The Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association (SIAA) was founded on December 21, 1894, by William Dudley, a chemistry professor at Vanderbilt.[49] The original members were Alabama, Auburn, Georgia, Georgia Tech, North Carolina, Sewanee, and Vanderbilt. Clemson, Cumberland, Kentucky, LSU, Mercer, Mississippi, Mississippi A&M (Mississippi State), Southwestern Presbyterian University, Tennessee, Texas, Tulane, and the University of Nashville joined the following year in 1895 as invited charter members.[50] The conference was originally formed for \"the development and purification of college athletics throughout the South\".[51] The first forward pass in football likely occurred on October 26, 1895, in a game between Georgia and North Carolina when, out of desperation, the ball was thrown by the North Carolina back Joel Whitaker instead of punted and George Stephens caught the ball.[52] On November 9, 1895, John Heisman executed a hidden ball trick using quarterback Reynolds Tichenor to get Auburn's only touchdown in a 6 to 9 loss to Vanderbilt. It was the first game in the south decided by a field goal.[53] Heisman later used the trick against Pop Warner's Georgia team. Warner picked up the trick and later used it at Cornell against Penn State in 1897.[54] He then used it in 1903 at Carlisle against Harvard and garnered national attention. The 1899 Sewanee Tigers are one of the all-time great teams of the early sport. The team went 12–0, outscoring opponents 322 to 10. Known as the \"Iron Men\", with just 13 men they had a six-day road trip with five shutout wins over Texas A&M; Texas; Tulane; LSU; and Ole Miss. It is recalled memorably with the phrase \"... and on the seventh day they rested.\"[55][56] Grantland Rice called them \"the most durable football team I ever saw.\"[57] Organized intercollegiate football was first played in the state of Florida in 1901.[58] A 7-game series between intramural teams from Stetson and Forbes occurred in 1894. The first intercollegiate game between official varsity teams was played on November 22, 1901. Stetson beat Florida Agricultural College at Lake City, one of the four forerunners of the University of Florida, 6–0, in a game played as part of the Jacksonville Fair.[59] On September 27, 1902, Georgetown beat Navy 4 to 0. It is claimed by Georgetown authorities as the game with the first ever \"roving center\" or linebacker when Percy Given stood up, in contrast to the usual tale of Germany Schulz.[60] The first linebacker in the South is often considered to be Frank Juhan. On Thanksgiving Day 1903, a game was scheduled in Montgomery, Alabama between the best teams from each region of the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association for an \"SIAA championship game\", pitting Cumberland against Heisman's Clemson. The game ended in an 11–11 tie causing many teams to claim the title. Heisman pressed hardest for Cumberland to get the claim of champion. It was his last game as Clemson head coach.[61] 1904 saw big coaching hires in the south: Mike Donahue at Auburn, John Heisman at Georgia Tech, and Dan McGugin at Vanderbilt were all hired that year. Both Donahue and McGugin just came from the north that year, Donahue from Yale and McGugin from Michigan, and were among the initial inductees of the College Football Hall of Fame. The undefeated 1904 Vanderbilt team scored an average of 52.7 points per game, the most in college football that season, and allowed just four points. The first college football game in Oklahoma Territory occurred on November 7, 1895, when the \"Oklahoma City Terrors\" defeated the Oklahoma Sooners 34 to 0. The Terrors were a mix of Methodist college and high school students.[62] The Sooners did not manage a single first down. By next season, Oklahoma coach John A. Harts had left to prospect for gold in the Arctic.[63][64] Organized football was first played in the territory on November 29, 1894, between the Oklahoma City Terrors and Oklahoma City High School. The high school won 24 to 0.[63] The University of Southern California first fielded an American football team in 1888. Playing its first game on November 14 of that year against the Alliance Athletic Club, in which USC gained a 16–0 victory. Frank Suffel and Henry H. Goddard were playing coaches for the first team which was put together by quarterback Arthur Carroll; who in turn volunteered to make the pants for the team and later became a tailor.[65] USC faced its first collegiate opponent the following year in fall 1889, playing St. Vincent's College to a 40–0 victory.[65] In 1893, USC joined the Intercollegiate Football Association of Southern California (the forerunner of the SCIAC), which was composed of USC, Occidental College, Throop Polytechnic Institute (Caltech), and Chaffey College. Pomona College was invited to enter, but declined to do so. An invitation was also extended to Los Angeles High School.[66] In 1891, the first Stanford football team was hastily organized and played a four-game season beginning in January 1892 with no official head coach. Following the season, Stanford captain John Whittemore wrote to Yale coach Walter Camp asking him to recommend a coach for Stanford. To Whittemore's surprise, Camp agreed to coach the team himself, on the condition that he finish the season at Yale first.[67] As a result of Camp's late arrival, Stanford played just three official games, against San Francisco's Olympic Club and rival California. The team also played exhibition games against two Los Angeles area teams that Stanford does not include in official results.[68][69] Camp returned to the East Coast following the season, then returned to coach Stanford in 1894 and 1895. On December 25, 1894, Amos Alonzo Stagg's Chicago Maroons agreed to play Camp's Stanford football team in San Francisco in the first postseason intersectional contest, foreshadowing the modern bowl game.[70][71] Future president Herbert Hoover was Stanford's student financial manager.[72] Chicago won 24 to 4.[73] Stanford won a rematch in Los Angeles on December 29 by 12 to 0.[74] The Big Game between Stanford and California is the oldest college football rivalry in the West. The first game was played on San Francisco's Haight Street Grounds on March 19, 1892, with Stanford winning 14–10. The term \"Big Game\" was first used in 1900, when it was played on Thanksgiving Day in San Francisco. During that game, a large group of men and boys, who were observing from the roof of the nearby S.F. and Pacific Glass Works, fell into the fiery interior of the building when the roof collapsed, resulting in 13 dead and 78 injured.[75][76][77][78][79] On December 4, 1900, the last victim of the disaster (Fred Lilly) died, bringing the death toll to 22; and, to this day, the \"Thanksgiving Day Disaster\" remains the deadliest accident to kill spectators at a U.S. sporting event.[80] The University of Oregon began playing American football in 1894 and played its first game on March 24, 1894, defeating Albany College 44–3 under head coach Cal Young.[81][82][83] Cal Young left after that first game and J.A. Church took over the coaching position in the fall for the rest of the season. Oregon finished the season with two additional losses and a tie, but went undefeated the following season, winning all four of its games under head coach Percy Benson.[83][84][85] In 1899, the Oregon football team left the state for the first time, playing the California Golden Bears in Berkeley, California.[81] American football at Oregon State University started in 1893 shortly after athletics were initially authorized at the college. Athletics were banned at the school in May 1892, but when the strict school president, Benjamin Arnold, died, President John Bloss reversed the ban.[86] Bloss's son William started the first team, on which he served as both coach and quarterback.[87] The team's first game was an easy 63–0 defeat over the home team, Albany College. In May 1900, Yost was hired as the football coach at Stanford University,[88] and, after traveling home to West Virginia, he arrived in Palo Alto, California, on August 21, 1900.[89] Yost led the 1900 Stanford team to a 7–2–1, outscoring opponents 154 to 20. The next year in 1901, Yost was hired by Charles A. Baird as the head football coach for the Michigan Wolverines football team. On January 1, 1902, Yost's dominating 1901 Michigan Wolverines football team agreed to play a 3–1–2 team from Stanford University in the inaugural \"Tournament East-West football game\" what is now known as the Rose Bowl Game by a score of 49–0 after Stanford captain Ralph Fisher requested to quit with eight minutes remaining. The 1905 season marked the first meeting between Stanford and USC. Consequently, Stanford is USC's oldest existing rival.[90] The Big Game between Stanford and Cal on November 11, 1905, was the first played at Stanford Field, with Stanford winning 12–5.[67] In 1906, citing concerns about the violence in American Football, universities on the West Coast, led by California and Stanford, replaced the sport with rugby union.[91] At the time, the future of American football was very much in doubt and these schools believed that rugby union would eventually be adopted nationwide.[91] Other schools followed suit and also made the switch included Nevada, St. Mary's, Santa Clara, and USC (in 1911).[91] However, due to the perception that West Coast football was inferior to the game played on the East Coast anyway, East Coast and Midwest teams shrugged off the loss of the teams and continued playing American football.[91] With no nationwide movement, the available pool of rugby teams to play remained small.[91] The schools scheduled games against local club teams and reached out to rugby union powers in Australia, New Zealand, and especially, due to its proximity, Canada. The annual Big Game between Stanford and California continued as rugby, with the winner invited by the British Columbia Rugby Union to a tournament in Vancouver over the Christmas holidays, with the winner of that tournament receiving the Cooper Keith Trophy.[91][92][93] During 12 seasons of playing rugby union, Stanford was remarkably successful: the team had three undefeated seasons, three one-loss seasons, and an overall record of 94 wins, 20 losses, and 3 ties for a winning percentage of .816. However, after a few years, the school began to feel the isolation of its newly adopted sport, which was not spreading as many had hoped. Students and alumni began to clamor for a return to American football to allow wider intercollegiate competition.[91] The pressure at rival California was stronger (especially as the school had not been as successful in the Big Game as they had hoped), and in 1915 California returned to American football. As reasons for the change, the school cited rule change back to American football, the overwhelming desire of students and supporters to play American football, interest in playing other East Coast and Midwest schools, and a patriotic desire to play an \"American\" game.[91] California's return to American football increased the pressure on Stanford to also change back in order to maintain the rivalry. Stanford played its 1915, 1916, and 1917 \"Big Games\" as rugby union against Santa Clara and California's football \"Big Game\" in those years was against Washington, but both schools desired to restore the old traditions.[91] The onset of American involvement in World War I gave Stanford an out: In 1918, the Stanford campus was designated as the Students' Army Training Corps headquarters for all of California, Nevada, and Utah, and the commanding officer Sam M. Parker decreed that American football was the appropriate athletic activity to train soldiers and rugby union was dropped.[91] The University of Colorado began playing American football in 1890. Colorado found much success in its early years, winning eight Colorado Football Association Championships (1894–97, 1901–08). The following was taken from the Silver & Gold newspaper of December 16, 1898. It was a recollection of the birth of Colorado football written by one of CU's original gridders, John C. Nixon, also the school's second captain. It appears here in its original form: At the beginning of the first semester in the fall of '90 the boys rooming at the dormitory on the campus of the U. of C. being afflicted with a super-abundance of penned up energy, or perhaps having recently drifted from under the parental wing and delighting in their newly found freedom, decided among other wild schemes, to form an athletic association. Messrs Carney, Whittaker, Layton and others, who at that time constituted a majority of the male population of the University, called a meeting of the campus boys in the old medical building. Nixon was elected president and Holden secretary of the association. It was voted that the officers constitute a committee to provide uniform suits in which to play what was called \"association football\". Suits of flannel were ultimately procured and paid for assessments on the members of the association and generous contributions from members of the faculty. ... The Athletic Association should now invigorate its base-ball and place it at par with its football team; and it certainly has the material with which to do it. The U of C should henceforth lead the state and possibly the west in athletic sports. ... The style of football playing has altered considerably; by the old rules, all men in front of the runner with the ball, were offside, consequently we could not send backs through and break the line ahead of the ball as is done at present. The notorious V was then in vogue, which gave a heavy team too much advantage. The mass plays being now barred, skill on the football field is more in demand than mere weight and strength. In 1909, the Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference was founded, featuring four members: Colorado, Colorado College, Colorado School of Mines, and Colorado Agricultural College. The University of Denver and the University of Utah joined the RMAC in 1910. For its first thirty years, the RMAC was considered a major conference equivalent to today's Division I, before 7 larger members left and formed the Mountain States Conference (also called the Skyline Conference). College football increased in popularity through the remainder of the 19th and early 20th century. It also became increasingly violent. Between 1890 and 1905, 330 college athletes died as a direct result of injuries sustained on the football field. These deaths could be attributed to the mass formations and gang tackling that characterized the sport in its early years. No sport is wholesome in which ungenerous or mean acts which easily escape detection contribute to victory. The 1894 Harvard–Yale game, known as the \"Hampden Park Blood Bath\", resulted in crippling injuries for four players; the contest was suspended until 1897. The annual Army–Navy game was suspended from 1894 to 1898 for similar reasons.[96] One of the major problems was the popularity of mass-formations like the flying wedge, in which a large number of offensive players charged as a unit against a similarly arranged defense. The resultant collisions often led to serious injuries and sometimes even death.[97] Georgia fullback Richard Von Albade Gammon notably died on the field from concussions received against Virginia in 1897, causing Georgia, Georgia Tech, and Mercer to suspend their football programs. The situation came to a head in 1905 when there were 19 fatalities nationwide. President Theodore Roosevelt reportedly threatened to shut down the game if drastic changes were not made.[98] However, the threat by Roosevelt to eliminate football is disputed by sports historians. What is absolutely certain is that on October 9, 1905, Roosevelt held a meeting of football representatives from Harvard, Yale, and Princeton. Though he lectured on eliminating and reducing injuries, he never threatened to ban football. He also lacked the authority to abolish football and was, in fact, actually a fan of the sport and wanted to preserve it. The President's sons were also playing football at the college and secondary levels at the time.[99] Meanwhile, John H. Outland held an experimental game in Wichita, Kansas that reduced the number of scrimmage plays to earn a first down from four to three in an attempt to reduce injuries.[100] The Los Angeles Times reported an increase in punts and considered the game much safer than regular play but that the new rule was not \"conducive to the sport\".[101] In 1906, President Roosevelt organized a meeting among thirteen school leaders at the White House to find solutions to make the sport safer for the athletes. Because the college officials could not agree upon a change in rules, it was decided over the course of several subsequent meetings that an external governing body should be responsible. Finally, on December 28, 1905, 62 schools met in New York City to discuss rule changes to make the game safer. As a result of this meeting, the Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States was formed in 1906. The IAAUS was the original rule-making body of college football, but would go on to sponsor championships in other sports. The IAAUS would get its current name of National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) in 1910,[102] and still sets rules governing the sport.[102][103] The rules committee considered widening the playing field to \"open up\" the game, but Harvard Stadium (the first large permanent football stadium) had recently been built at great expense; it would be rendered useless by a wider field. The rules committee legalized the forward pass instead. Though it was underused for years, this proved to be one of the most important rule changes in the establishment of the modern game.[104] Another rule change banned \"mass momentum\" plays (many of which, like the infamous \"flying wedge\", were sometimes literally deadly). As a result of the 1905–1906 reforms, mass formation plays became illegal and forward passes legal. Bradbury Robinson, playing for visionary coach Eddie Cochems at Saint Louis University, threw the first legal pass in a September 5, 1906, game against Carroll College at Waukesha. Other important changes, formally adopted in 1910, were the requirements that at least seven offensive players be on the line of scrimmage at the time of the snap, that there be no pushing or pulling, and that interlocking interference (arms linked or hands on belts and uniforms) was not allowed. These changes greatly reduced the potential for collision injuries.[105] Several coaches emerged who took advantage of these sweeping changes. Amos Alonzo Stagg introduced such innovations as the huddle, the tackling dummy, and the pre-snap shift.[106] Other coaches, such as Pop Warner and Knute Rockne, introduced new strategies that still remain part of the game. Besides these coaching innovations, several rules changes during the first third of the 20th century had a profound impact on the game, mostly in opening up the passing game. In 1914, the first roughing-the-passer penalty was implemented. In 1918, the rules on eligible receivers were loosened to allow eligible players to catch the ball anywhere on the field—previously strict rules were in place allowing passes to only certain areas of the field.[107] Scoring rules also changed during this time: field goals were lowered to three points in 1909[11] and touchdowns raised to six points in 1912.[108] Star players that emerged in the early 20th century include Jim Thorpe, Red Grange, and Bronko Nagurski; these three made the transition to the fledgling NFL and helped turn it into a successful league. Sportswriter Grantland Rice helped popularize the sport with his poetic descriptions of games and colorful nicknames for the game's biggest players, including Notre Dame's \"Four Horsemen\" backfield and Fordham University's linemen, known as the \"Seven Blocks of Granite\".[109] In 1907 at Champaign, Illinois Chicago and Illinois played in the first game to have a halftime show featuring a marching band.[110] Chicago won 42–6. On November 25, 1911 Kansas played at Missouri in the first homecoming football game.[111] The game was \"broadcast\" play-by-play over telegraph to at least 1,000 fans in Lawrence, Kansas.[112] It ended in a 3–3 tie. The game between West Virginia and Pittsburgh on October 8, 1921, saw the first live radio broadcast of a college football game when Harold W. Arlin announced that year's Backyard Brawl played at Forbes Field on KDKA. Pitt won 21–13.[113] On October 28, 1922, Princeton and Chicago played the first game to be nationally broadcast on radio. Princeton won 21–18 in a hotly contested game which had Princeton dubbed the \"Team of Destiny\".[114] One publication claims \"The first scouting done in the South was in 1905, when Dan McGugin and Captain Innis Brown, of Vanderbilt went to Atlanta to see Sewanee play Georgia Tech.\"[115] Fuzzy Woodruff claims Davidson was the first in the south to throw a legal forward pass in 1906. The following season saw Vanderbilt execute a double pass play to set up the touchdown that beat Sewanee in a meeting of the unbeaten for the SIAA championship. Grantland Rice cited this event as the greatest thrill he ever witnessed in his years of watching sports.[116] Vanderbilt coach Dan McGugin in Spalding's Football Guide's summation of the season in the SIAA wrote \"The standing. First, Vanderbilt; second, Sewanee, a might good second;\" and that Aubrey Lanier \"came near winning the Vanderbilt game by his brilliant dashes after receiving punts.\"[117] Bob Blake threw the final pass to center Stein Stone, catching it near the goal among defenders. Honus Craig then ran in the winning touchdown. Using the \"jump shift\" offense, John Heisman's Georgia Tech Golden Tornado won 222 to 0 over Cumberland on October 7, 1916, at Grant Field in the most lopsided victory in college football history.[118] Tech went on a 33-game winning streak during this period. The 1917 team was the first national champion from the South, led by a powerful backfield. It also had the first two players from the Deep South selected first-team All-American in Walker Carpenter and Everett Strupper. Pop Warner's Pittsburgh Panthers were also undefeated, but declined a challenge by Heisman to a game. When Heisman left Tech after 1919, his shift was still employed by protégé William Alexander. In 1906, Vanderbilt defeated Carlisle 4 to 0, the result of a Bob Blake field goal.[119][120] In 1907 Vanderbilt fought Navy to a 6 to 6 tie. In 1910 Vanderbilt held defending national champion Yale to a scoreless tie.[120] Helping Georgia Tech's claim to a title in 1917, the Auburn Tigers held undefeated, Chic Harley-led Big Ten champion Ohio State to a scoreless tie the week before Georgia Tech beat the Tigers 68 to 7. The next season, with many players gone due to World War I, a game was finally scheduled at Forbes Field with Pittsburgh. The Panthers, led by freshman Tom Davies, defeated Georgia Tech 32 to 0. Tech center Bum Day was the first player on a Southern team ever selected first-team All-American by Walter Camp. 1917 saw the rise of another Southern team in Centre of Danville, Kentucky. In 1921 Bo McMillin-led Centre upset defending national champion Harvard 6 to 0 in what is widely considered one of the greatest upsets in college football history. The next year Vanderbilt fought Michigan to a scoreless tie at the inaugural game at Dudley Field (now Vanderbilt Stadium), the first stadium in the South made exclusively for college football. Michigan coach Fielding Yost and Vanderbilt coach Dan McGugin were brothers-in-law, and the latter the protégé of the former. The game featured the season's two best defenses and included a goal line stand by Vanderbilt to preserve the tie. Its result was \"a great surprise to the sporting world\".[121] Commodore fans celebrated by throwing some 3,000 seat cushions onto the field. The game features prominently in Vanderbilt's history.[122] That same year, Alabama upset Penn 9 to 7.[123] Vanderbilt's line coach then was Wallace Wade, who coached Alabama to the South's first Rose Bowl victory in 1925. This game is commonly referred to as \"the game that changed the south\".[124] Wade followed up the next season with an undefeated record and Rose Bowl tie. Georgia's 1927 \"dream and wonder team\" defeated Yale for the first time. Georgia Tech, led by Heisman protégé William Alexander, gave the dream and wonder team its only loss, and the next year were national and Rose Bowl champions. The Rose Bowl included Roy Riegels' wrong-way run. On October 12, 1929, Yale lost to Georgia in Sanford Stadium in its first trip to the south. Wade's Alabama again won a national championship and Rose Bowl in 1930. Glenn \"Pop\" Warner coached at several schools throughout his career, including the University of Georgia, Cornell University, University of Pittsburgh, Stanford University, Iowa State University, and Temple University.[125] One of his most famous stints was at the Carlisle Indian Industrial School, where he coached Jim Thorpe, who went on to become the first president of the National Football League, an Olympic Gold Medalist, and is widely considered one of the best overall athletes in history.[126][127] Warner wrote one of the first important books of football strategy, Football for Coaches and Players, published in 1927.[128] Though the shift was invented by Stagg, Warner's single wing and double wing formations greatly improved upon it; for almost 40 years, these were among the most important formations in football. As part of his single and double wing formations, Warner was one of the first coaches to effectively use the forward pass. Among his other innovations are modern blocking schemes, the three-point stance, and the reverse play.[125] The youth football league, Pop Warner Little Scholars, was named in his honor. Knute Rockne rose to prominence in 1913 as an end for the University of Notre Dame, then a largely unknown Midwestern Catholic school. When Army scheduled Notre Dame as a warm-up game, they thought little of the small school. Rockne and quarterback Gus Dorais made innovative use of the forward pass, still at that point a relatively unused weapon, to defeat Army 35–13 and helped establish the school as a national power. Rockne returned to coach the team in 1918, and devised the powerful Notre Dame Box offense, based on Warner's single wing. He is credited with being the first major coach to emphasize offense over defense. Rockne is also credited with popularizing and perfecting the forward pass, a seldom used play at the time.[129] The 1924 team featured the Four Horsemen backfield. In 1927, his complex shifts led directly to a rule change whereby all offensive players had to stop for a full second before the ball could be snapped. Rather than simply a regional team, Rockne's \"Fighting Irish\" became famous for barnstorming and played any team at any location. It was during Rockne's tenure that the annual Notre Dame-University of Southern California rivalry began. He led his team to an impressive 105–12–5 record before his premature death in a plane crash in 1931. He was so famous at that point that his funeral was broadcast nationally on radio.[125][130] In the early 1930s, the college game continued to grow, particularly in the South, bolstered by fierce rivalries such as the \"South's Oldest Rivalry\", between Virginia and North Carolina and the \"Deep South's Oldest Rivalry\", between Georgia and Auburn. Although before the mid-1920s most national powers came from the Northeast or the Midwest, the trend changed when several teams from the South and the West Coast achieved national success. Wallace William Wade's 1925 Alabama team won the 1926 Rose Bowl after receiving its first national title and William Alexander's 1928 Georgia Tech team defeated California in the 1929 Rose Bowl. College football quickly became the most popular spectator sport in the South.[131] Several major modern college football conferences rose to prominence during this time period. The Southwest Athletic Conference had been founded in 1915. Consisting mostly of schools from Texas, the conference saw back-to-back national champions with Texas Christian University (TCU) in 1938 and Texas A&M in 1939.[132][133] The Pacific Coast Conference (PCC), a precursor to the Pac-12 Conference (Pac-12), had its own back-to-back champion in the University of Southern California which was awarded the title in 1931 and 1932.[132] The Southeastern Conference (SEC) formed in 1932 and consisted mostly of schools in the Deep South.[134] As in previous decades, the Big Ten continued to dominate in the 1930s and 1940s, with Minnesota winning 5 titles between 1934 and 1941, and Michigan (1933, 1947, and 1948) and Ohio State (1942) also winning titles.[132][135] As it grew beyond its regional affiliations in the 1930s, college football garnered increased national attention. Four new bowl games were created: the Orange Bowl, Sugar Bowl, the Sun Bowl in 1935, and the Cotton Bowl in 1937. In lieu of an actual national championship, these bowl games, along with the earlier Rose Bowl, provided a way to match up teams from distant regions of the country that did not otherwise play. In 1936, the Associated Press began its weekly poll of prominent sports writers, ranking all of the nation's college football teams. Since there was no national championship game, the final version of the AP poll was used to determine who was crowned the National Champion of college football.[136] The 1930s saw growth in the passing game. Though some coaches, such as General Robert Neyland at Tennessee, continued to eschew its use, several rules changes to the game had a profound effect on teams' ability to throw the ball. In 1934, the rules committee removed two major penalties—a loss of five yards for a second incomplete pass in any series of downs and a loss of possession for an incomplete pass in the end zone—and shrunk the circumference of the ball, making it easier to grip and throw. Players who became famous for taking advantage of the easier passing game included Alabama end Don Hutson and TCU passer \"Slingin\" Sammy Baugh.[137] In 1935, New York City's Downtown Athletic Club awarded the first Heisman Trophy to University of Chicago halfback Jay Berwanger, who was also the first ever NFL draft pick in 1936. The trophy was designed by sculptor Frank Eliscu and modeled after New York University player Ed Smith. The trophy recognizes the nation's \"most outstanding\" college football player and has become one of the most coveted awards in all of American sports.[138] During World War II, college football players enlisted in the armed forces, some playing in Europe during the war. As most of these players had eligibility left on their college careers, some of them returned to college at West Point, bringing Army back-to-back national titles in 1944 and 1945 under coach Red Blaik. Doc Blanchard (known as \"Mr. Inside\") and Glenn Davis (known as \"Mr. Outside\") both won the Heisman Trophy, in 1945 and 1946. On the coaching staff of those 1944–1946 Army teams was future Pro Football Hall of Fame coach Vince Lombardi.[135][139] The 1950s saw the rise of yet more dynasties and power programs. Oklahoma, under coach Bud Wilkinson, won three national titles (1950, 1955, 1956) and all ten Big Eight Conference championships in the decade while building a record 47-game winning streak. Woody Hayes led Ohio State to two national titles, in 1954 and 1957, and won three Big Ten titles. The Michigan State Spartans were known as the \"football factory\" during the 1950s, where coaches Clarence Munn and Duffy Daugherty led the Spartans to two national titles and two Big Ten titles after joining the Big Ten athletically in 1953. Wilkinson and Hayes, along with Robert Neyland of Tennessee, oversaw a revival of the running game in the 1950s. Passing numbers dropped from an average of 18.9 attempts in 1951 to 13.6 attempts in 1955, while teams averaged just shy of 50 running plays per game. Nine out of ten Heisman Trophy winners in the 1950s were runners. Notre Dame, one of the biggest passing teams of the decade, saw a substantial decline in success; the 1950s were the only decade between 1920 and 1990 when the team did not win at least a share of the national title. Paul Hornung, Notre Dame quarterback, did, however, win the Heisman in 1956, becoming the only player from a losing team ever to do so.[140][141] The 1956 Sugar Bowl also gained international attention when Georgia's pro-segregationist Gov. Griffin publicly threatened Georgia Tech and its President Blake Van Leer over allowing the first African American player to play in a collegiate bowl game in the south.[142] Following the enormous success of the 1958 NFL Championship Game, college football no longer enjoyed the same popularity as the NFL, at least on a national level. While both games benefited from the advent of television, since the late 1950s, the NFL has become a nationally popular sport while college football has maintained strong regional ties.[143][144][145] As professional football became a national television phenomenon, college football did as well. In the 1950s, Notre Dame, which had a large national following, formed its own network to broadcast its games, but by and large the sport still retained a mostly regional following. In 1952, the NCAA claimed all television broadcasting rights for the games of its member institutions, and it alone negotiated television rights. This situation continued until 1984, when several schools brought a suit under the Sherman Antitrust Act; the Supreme Court ruled against the NCAA and schools are now free to negotiate their own television deals. ABC Sports began broadcasting a national Game of the Week in 1966, bringing key matchups and rivalries to a national audience for the first time.[146] New formations and play sets continued to be developed. Emory Bellard, an assistant coach under Darrell Royal at the University of Texas, developed a three-back option style offense known as the wishbone. The wishbone is a run-heavy offense that depends on the quarterback making last second decisions on when and to whom to hand or pitch the ball to. Royal went on to teach the offense to other coaches, including Bear Bryant at Alabama, Chuck Fairbanks at Oklahoma and Pepper Rodgers at UCLA; who all adapted and developed it to their own tastes.[147] The strategic opposite of the wishbone is the spread offense, developed by professional and college coaches throughout the 1960s and 1970s. Though some schools play a run-based version of the spread, its most common use is as a passing offense designed to \"spread\" the field both horizontally and vertically.[148] Some teams have managed to adapt with the times to keep winning consistently. In the rankings of the most victorious programs, Michigan, Ohio State, and Alabama ranked first, second, and third in total wins. In 1940, for the highest level of college football, there were only five bowl games (Rose, Orange, Sugar, Sun, and Cotton). By 1950, three more had joined that number and in 1970, there were still only eight major college bowl games. The number grew to eleven in 1976. At the birth of cable television and cable sports networks like ESPN, there were fifteen bowls in 1980. With more national venues and increased available revenue, the bowls saw an explosive growth throughout the 1980s and 1990s. In the thirty years from 1950 to 1980, seven bowl games were added to the schedule. From 1980 to 2008, an additional 20 bowl games were added to the schedule.[149][151] Some have criticized this growth, claiming that the increased number of games has diluted the significance of playing in a bowl game. Yet others have countered that the increased number of games has increased exposure and revenue for a greater number of schools, and see it as a positive development.[152] Teams participating in bowl games also get to practice up to four hours per day or 20 hours per week until their bowl game concludes.[153] There is no limit on the number of practices during the bowl season, so teams that play later in the season (usually ones with more wins) get more opportunity to practice than ones that play earlier. This bowl practice period can be compared to the spring practice schedule when teams can have 15 on-field practice sessions.[154] Many teams that play late in the bowl season use the first few practices for evaluation and development of younger players while resting the starters.[155] Currently, the NCAA Division I football teams are divided into two divisions – the \"football bowl subdivision\" (FBS) and the \"football championship subdivision\"(FCS). As indicated by the name, the FBS teams are eligible to play in post-season bowls. The FCS teams, Division II, Division III, National Junior College teams play in sanctioned tournaments to determine their annual champions. There is not now, and never has been, an NCAA-sanctioned tournament to determine the champion of the top-level football teams. With the growth of bowl games, it became difficult to determine a national champion in a fair and equitable manner. As conferences became contractually bound to certain bowl games (a situation known as a tie-in), match-ups that guaranteed a consensus national champion became increasingly rare. In 1992, seven conferences and independent Notre Dame formed the Bowl Coalition, which attempted to arrange an annual No. 1 versus No. 2 matchup based on the final AP poll standings. The Coalition lasted for three years; however, several scheduling issues prevented much success; tie-ins still took precedence in several cases. For example, the Big Eight and SEC champions could never meet, since they were contractually bound to different bowl games. The coalition also excluded the Rose Bowl, arguably the most prestigious game in the nation, and two major conferences—the Pac-10 and Big Ten—meaning that it had limited success. In 1995, the Coalition was replaced by the Bowl Alliance, which reduced the number of bowl games to host a national championship game to three—the Fiesta, Sugar, and Orange Bowls—and the participating conferences to five—the ACC, SEC, Southwest, Big Eight, and Big East. It was agreed that the No.1 and No.2 ranked teams gave up their prior bowl tie-ins and were guaranteed to meet in the national championship game, which rotated between the three participating bowls. The system still did not include the Big Ten, Pac-10, or the Rose Bowl, and thus still lacked the legitimacy of a true national championship.[151][156] However, one positive side effect is that if there were three teams at the end of the season vying for a national title, but one of them was a Pac-10/Big Ten team bound to the Rose Bowl, then there would be no difficulty in deciding which teams to place in the Bowl Alliance \"national championship\" bowl; if the Pac-10 / Big Ten team won the Rose Bowl and finished with the same record as whichever team won the other bowl game, they could have a share of the national title. This happened in the final year of the Bowl Alliance, with Michigan winning the 1998 Rose Bowl and Nebraska winning the 1998 Orange Bowl. Without the Pac-10/Big Ten team bound to a bowl game, it would be difficult to decide which two teams should play for the national title. In 1998, a new system was put into place called the Bowl Championship Series. For the first time, it included all major conferences (ACC, Big East, Big 12, Big Ten, Pac-10, and SEC) and four major bowl games (Rose, Orange, Sugar and Fiesta). The champions of these six conferences, along with two \"at-large\" selections, were invited to play in the four bowl games. Each year, one of the four bowl games served as a national championship game. Also, a complex system of human polls, computer rankings, and strength of schedule calculations was instituted to rank schools. Based on this ranking system, the No.1 and No.2 teams met each year in the national championship game. Traditional tie-ins were maintained for schools and bowls not part of the national championship. For example, in years when not a part of the national championship, the Rose Bowl still hosted the Big Ten and Pac-10 champions.[156] The system continued to change, as the formula for ranking teams was tweaked from year to year. At-large teams could be chosen from any of the Division I-A conferences, though only one selection—Utah in 2005—came from a BCS non-AQ conference. Starting with the 2006 season, a fifth game—simply called the BCS National Championship Game—was added to the schedule, to be played at the site of one of the four BCS bowl games on a rotating basis, one week after the regular bowl game. This opened up the BCS to two additional at-large teams. Also, rules were changed to add the champions of five additional conferences (Conference USA [C-USA], the Mid-American Conference [MAC], the Mountain West Conference [MW], the Sun Belt Conference and the Western Athletic Conference [WAC]), provided that said champion ranked in the top twelve in the final BCS rankings, or was within the top 16 of the BCS rankings and ranked higher than the champion of at least one of the BCS Automatic Qualifying (AQ) conferences.[156] Several times since this rule change was implemented, schools from non-AQ conferences have played in BCS bowl games. In 2009, Boise State played TCU in the Fiesta Bowl, the first time two schools from non-AQ conferences played each other in a BCS bowl game. The last team from the non-AQ ranks to reach a BCS bowl game in the BCS era was Northern Illinois in 2012, which played in (and lost) the 2013 Orange Bowl. The longtime resistance to a playoff system at the FBS level finally ended with the creation of the College Football Playoff (CFP) beginning with the 2014 season. The CFP is a multi-team single-elimination tournament (originally four teams; expanded to 12 teams in the 2024 season) whose participants are chosen and seeded by a selection committee. The initial rounds are hosted by a group of traditional bowl games, and semifinal winners advance to the College Football Playoff National Championship, whose host is determined by open bidding several years in advance. The 10 FBS conferences are formally and popularly divided into two groups: Although rules for the high school, college, and NFL games are generally consistent, there are several minor differences. Before 2023, a single NCAA Football Rules Committee determined the playing rules for Division I (both Bowl and Championship Subdivisions), II, and III games (the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) is a separate organization, but uses the NCAA rules). As part of an NCAA initiative to give each division more autonomy over its governance, separate rules committees have been established for each NCAA division. College teams mostly play other similarly sized schools through the NCAA's divisional system. Division I generally consists of the major collegiate athletic powers with larger budgets, more elaborate facilities, and (with the exception of a few conferences such as the Pioneer Football League) more athletic scholarships. Division II primarily consists of smaller public and private institutions that offer fewer scholarships than those in Division I. Division III institutions also field teams, but do not offer any scholarships. Football teams in Division I are further divided into the Bowl Subdivision (consisting of the largest programs) and the Championship Subdivision. The Bowl Subdivision has historically not used an organized tournament to determine its champion, and instead teams compete in post-season bowl games. That changed with the debut of the four-team College Football Playoff at the end of the 2014 season, However, the NCAA does not operate that tournament, and its winner is not automatically crowned National Champion. Teams in each of these four divisions are further divided into various regional conferences. Several organizations operate college football programs outside the jurisdiction of the NCAA: A college that fields a team in the NCAA is not restricted from fielding teams in club or sprint football, and several colleges field two teams, a varsity (NCAA) squad and a club or sprint squad (no schools, as of 2024[update], field both club and sprint teams at the same time). Started in the 2014 season, four Division I FBS teams are selected at the end of regular season to compete in a playoff for the FBS national championship. The inaugural champion was Ohio State University.[164] The College Football Playoff replaced the Bowl Championship Series, which had been used as a selection method to determine the national championship game participants since in the 1998 season. The Michigan Wolverines won the most recent playoff 34–13 over the Washington Huskies in the 2024 College Football Playoff. At the Division I FCS level, the teams participate in a 24-team playoff (most recently expanded from 20 teams in 2013) to determine the national championship. Under the current playoff structure, the top eight teams are all seeded, and receive a bye week in the first round. The highest seed receives automatic home field advantage. Starting in 2013, non-seeded teams can only host a playoff game if both teams involved are unseeded; in such a matchup, the schools must bid for the right to host the game. Selection for the playoffs is determined by a selection committee, although usually a team must have an 8–4 record to even be considered. Losses to an FBS team count against their playoff eligibility, while wins against a Division II opponent do not count towards playoff consideration. Thus, only Division I wins (whether FBS, FCS, or FCS non-scholarship) are considered for playoff selection. The Division I National Championship game is held in Frisco, Texas. Division II and Division III of the NCAA also participate in their own respective playoffs, crowning national champions at the end of the season. The National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics also holds a playoff. Unlike other college football divisions and most other sports—collegiate or professional—the Football Bowl Subdivision, formerly known as Division I-A college football, has historically not employed a playoff system to determine a champion. Instead, it has a series of postseason \"bowl games\". The annual National Champion in the Football Bowl Subdivision is then instead traditionally determined by a vote of sports writers and other non-players. This system has been challenged often, beginning with an NCAA committee proposal in 1979 to have a four-team playoff following the bowl games.[165] However, little headway was made in instituting a playoff tournament until 2014, given the entrenched vested economic interests in the various bowls. Although the NCAA publishes lists of claimed FBS-level national champions in its official publications, it has never recognized an official FBS national championship; this policy continues even after the establishment of the College Football Playoff (which is not directly run by the NCAA) in 2014. As a result, the official Division I National Champion is the winner of the Football Championship Subdivision, as it is the highest level of football with an NCAA-administered championship tournament. (This also means that FBS student-athletes are the only NCAA athletes who are ineligible for the Elite 90 Award, an academic award presented to the upper class player with the highest grade-point average among the teams that advance to the championship final site.) The first bowl game was the 1902 Rose Bowl, played between Michigan and Stanford; Michigan won 49–0. It ended when Stanford requested and Michigan agreed to end it with 8 minutes on the clock. That game was so lopsided that the game was not played annually until 1916, when the Tournament of Roses decided to reattempt the postseason game. The term \"bowl\" originates from the shape of the Rose Bowl stadium in Pasadena, California, which was built in 1923 and resembled the Yale Bowl, built in 1915. This is where the name came into use, as it became known as the Rose Bowl Game. Other games came along and used the term \"bowl\", whether the stadium was shaped like a bowl or not. At the Division I FBS level, teams must earn the right to be bowl eligible by winning at least 6 games during the season (teams that play 13 games in a season, which is allowed for Hawaii and any of its home opponents, must win 7 games). They are then invited to a bowl game based on their conference ranking and the tie-ins that the conference has to each bowl game. For the 2009 season, there were 34 bowl games, so 68 of the 120 Division I FBS teams were invited to play at a bowl. These games are played from mid-December to early January and most of the later bowl games are typically considered more prestigious. After the Bowl Championship Series, additional all-star bowl games round out the post-season schedule through the beginning of February. Partly as a compromise between both bowl game and playoff supporters, the NCAA created the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) in 1998 to create a definitive national championship game for college football. The series included the four most prominent bowl games (Rose Bowl, Orange Bowl, Sugar Bowl, Fiesta Bowl), while the national championship game rotated each year between one of these venues.[166][167] The BCS system was slightly adjusted in 2006, as the NCAA added a fifth game to the series, called the National Championship Game. This allowed the four other BCS bowls to use their normal selection process to select the teams in their games while the top two teams in the BCS rankings would play in the new National Championship Game. The BCS selection committee used a complicated, and often controversial, computer system to rank all Division I-FBS teams and the top two teams at the end of the season played for the national championship.[168] This computer system, which factored in newspaper polls, online polls, coaches' polls, strength of schedule, and various other factors of a team's season, led to much dispute over whether the two best teams in the country were being selected to play in the National Championship Game. The BCS ended after the 2013 season and, since the 2014 season, the FBS national champion has been determined[169] by a four-team tournament known as the College Football Playoff (CFP). A selection committee of college football experts decides the participating teams. Six major bowl games known as the New Year's Six (NY6)—the Rose, Sugar, Cotton, Orange, Peach, and Fiesta Bowls—rotate on a three-year cycle as semi-final games, with the winners advancing to the College Football Playoff National Championship.[170] This arrangement was contractually locked in until the 2026 season, but an agreement was reached on CFP expansion to 12 teams effective with the 2024 season.[171] In the new CFP format, no conferences will receive automatic bids. Playoff berths will be awarded to the top six conference champions in the CFP rankings, plus the top six remaining teams (which may include other conference champions). The top four conference champions receive first-round byes. All first-round games will be played at the home field of the higher seed. The winners of these games advance to meet the top four seeds in the quarterfinals. The NY6 games will host the quarterfinals and semi-finals, rotating so that each bowl game will host two quarterfinals and one semi-final in a three-year cycle. The CFP National Championship will continue to be held at a site determined by open bidding several years in advance.[172] College football is a controversial institution within American higher education, where the amount of money involved—what people will pay for the entertainment provided—is a corrupting factor within universities that they are usually ill-equipped to deal with.[173][174] According to William E. Kirwan, chancellor of the University of Maryland System and co-director of the Knight Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics, \"We've reached a point where big-time intercollegiate athletics is undermining the integrity of our institutions, diverting presidents and institutions from their main purpose.\"[175] Football coaches often make more than the presidents of the universities which employ them.[176] Athletes are alleged to receive preferential treatment both in academics and when they run afoul of the law.[177] Although in theory football is an extra-curricular activity engaged in as a sideline by students, it is widely believed to turn a substantial profit, from which the athletes receive no direct benefit. There has been serious discussion about making student-athletes university employees to allow them to be paid.[178][179][180][181] In reality, the majority of major collegiate football programs operated at a financial loss in 2014.[182] There had been discussions on changing rules that prohibited compensation for the use of a player's name, image, and likeness (NIL), but change did not start to come until the mid-2010s. This reform first took place in the NAIA, which initially allowed all student-athletes at its member schools to receive NIL compensation in 2014,[183] and beginning in 2020 specifically allowed these individuals to reference their athletic participation in their endorsement deals.[184] The NCAA passed its own NIL reform, very similar to the NAIA's most recent reform, in July 2021, after its hand was forced by multiple states that had passed legislation allowing NIL compensation, most notably California.[185][186] On June 3 of 2021, \"The NCAA's board of directors adopted a temporary rule change that opened the door for NIL activity, instructing schools to set their own policy for what should be allowed with minimal guidelines\" (Murphy 2021). On July 1 of 2021, the new rules set in and student athletes could start signing endorsements using their name, image and likeness. \"The NCAA has asked Congress for help in creating a federal NIL law. While several federal options have been proposed, it's becoming increasingly likely that state laws will start to go into effect before a nationwide change is made. There are 28 states with NIL laws already in place and multiple others that are actively pursuing legislation\" (Murphy 2021). Charlie Baker called for a ban on all college football betting (and betting on college sports in general) because of prop bets for student athletes. With past scandals and threats to college athletes, Baker requested states with sports betting to adjust their regulations to remove these bet types. While some were quick to do so (including Louisiana, Colorado, Ohio), others rejected the notion and continued to offer sports betting the same way.[187][188] Canadian football, which parallels American football, is played by university teams in Canada under the auspices of U Sports. (Unlike in the United States, no junior colleges play football in Canada, and the sanctioning body for junior college athletics in Canada, CCAA, does not sanction the sport.) However, amateur football outside of colleges is played in Canada, such as in the Canadian Junior Football League. Organized competition in American football also exists at the collegiate level in Mexico (ONEFA), the UK (British Universities American Football League), Japan (Japan American Football Association, Koshien Bowl), and South Korea (Korea American Football Association). According to 2017 study on brains of deceased gridiron football players, 99% of tested brains of NFL players, 88% of CFL players, 64% of semi-professional players, 91% of college football players, and 21% of high school football players had various stages of CTE.[189] The study noted it has limitations due to \"selection bias\" in that the brains donated are from families who suspected CTE, but \"The fact that we were able to gather so many instances of a disease that was previously considered quite rare, in eight years, speaks volumes.\"[189] Other common injuries include: injuries of legs, arms, and lower back.[190][191][192][193]",

Oregon and Ohio state are set to battle in the Rose Bowl after a classic earlier this year. What will be the difference this time? ASU was picked to finish last in the Big 12, but it made the CFP and has been shepherded by the 34-year-old Dillingham. Walk-ons could become a thing of the past, but the Longhorns might not be in the playoff without theirs. We made predictions on the final score of every bowl matchup. Check back to see how we fared. Some of these first-year players lived up to their recruiting hype, and others were pleasant surprises.

                "content": "The South Carolina Gamecocks football program represents the University of South Carolina. The Gamecocks compete in the Football Bowl Subdivision of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and the Southeastern Conference. The team's head coach is Shane Beamer. They play their home games at Williams–Brice Stadium. From 1953 through 1970, the Gamecocks played in the Atlantic Coast Conference, finishing No. 14 in the 1958 final AP poll and winning the 1969 ACC Championship. From 1971 through 1991, they competed as a major independent, producing 1980 Heisman Trophy winner George Rogers, six bowl appearances, and final AP top-25 rankings in 1984 and 1987 (No. 11 and No. 15). Since 1992, they have competed in the Southeastern Conference, winning the SEC East Division in 2010 and posting seven final top-25 rankings, including three top-10 finishes and one top-5 finish. South Carolina has produced a National Coach of the Year in Joe Morrison (1984), four SEC coaches of the year in Lou Holtz (2000), Steve Spurrier (2005, 2010), and Shane Beamer (2024), one ACC coach of the year in Paul Dietzel (1969), and two overall #1 NFL Draft picks in George Rogers (1981) and Jadeveon Clowney (2014). They also have five members of the College Football Hall of Fame in former players George Rogers and Sterling Sharpe, and former coaches Holtz and Spurrier as well as former Athletic Director Mike McGee. Carolina fielded its first football team on Christmas Eve, in Charleston, South Carolina, in 1892 versus Furman.[3] At that time the football team was not sanctioned by the university.[3] They provided their own uniforms and paid their own train fare in order to participate in the game.[3] They were nicknamed the \"College Boys\" by The News and Courier and their supporters wore garnet and black.[4] USC won its first game in its third season, on November 2, 1895, against Columbia AA.[3] The squad designated their first head coach, W. H. \"Dixie\" Whaley, the following year.[3] The 1896 season also saw the inaugural game against arch-rival Clemson on November 12, which Carolina won 12–6.[3] From 1902 to 1903, coach Bob Williams led the Gamecocks to a 14–3 record.[5] In 1902, South Carolina beat Clemson, coached by John Heisman, for the first time since 1896, the first year of the rivalry.[6] \"The Carolina fans that week were carrying around a poster with the image of a tiger with a gamecock standing on top of it, holding the tiger's tail as if he was steering the tiger by the tail\", Jay McCormick said. \"Naturally, the Clemson guys didn't take too kindly to that, and on Wednesday and again on Thursday, there were sporadic fistfights involving brass knuckles and other objects and so forth, some of which resulted, according to the newspapers, in blood being spilled and persons having to seek medical assistance. After the game on Thursday, the Clemson guys frankly told the Carolina students that if you bring this poster, which is insulting to us, to the big parade on Friday, you're going to be in trouble. And naturally, of course, the Carolina students brought the poster to the parade. If you give someone an ultimatum and they're your rival, they're going to do exactly what you told them not to do.\"[7] As expected, another brawl broke out before both sides agreed to mutually burn the poster in an effort to defuse tensions. The immediate aftermath resulted in the stoppage of the rivalry until 1909.[8][9] 1903 also heralded the program's first 8-win season with an overall record of 8–2.[5] Future senator and former star player for South Carolina and UVA, Christie Benet led the Gamecocks from 1904 to 1905 and 1908 to 1909.[10] 1904's captain Gene Oliver played against Georgia with a broken jaw.[11] The Board of Trustees banned participation in football for the 1906 season after the faculty complained that the coarseness of chants and cheers, yelled by the students at football games, were not gentlemanly in nature.[12] Within months The Board of Trustees reversed their decision after hearing pleas, and receiving petitions, from students and alumni alike.[13] Play was allowed to resume in 1907.[13] A hastily assembled football team, coached by Board of Trustees member Douglas McKay, competed in an abbreviated season that same year, and the squad won all three games.[14] In 1910, South Carolina hired John Neff from UVA.[15] Norman B. Edgerton coached the team from 1912 to 1915.[16] A. B. Stoney played on the team.[17] Yet another UVA grad, W. Rice Warren coached the 1916 team.[18] Frank Dobson led the war-torn 1918 team to a 2–1–1 record.[19] Coach Sol Metzger led the 1921 team to a 5–1–2 record, losing only to Billy Laval's Furman.[20] Branch Bocock coached the 1925 and 1926 teams.[21] Billy Laval, a Columbia native, came to USC from Furman.[22] Laval accepted a three-year contract worth $8,000 per year to coach the Gamecocks, which made him the highest-paid coach in the state.[23] From 1928 to 1934, he led the Gamecocks to seven consecutive winning seasons and a 39–26–6 overall record, which included a perfect 3–0 Southern Conference campaign in 1933. Laval is one of only two South Carolina football coaches to have produced seven consecutive winning seasons (Steve Spurrier is the other, from 2008 to 2014).[24] In 2009, The State called him \"the greatest collegiate coach\" in the history of South Carolina.[23] Laval left USC after six seasons to coach multiple sports at Emory and Henry College, partly due to differences over his contract with the USC athletics department.[23] 1934 was the first season that Williams–Brice Stadium was used.[25] Prior to this, South Carolina played its home games on the school's campus.[26] Don McCallister led the Gamecocks for three seasons before being replaced. His final record is 13–20–1.[27] Under coach Rex Enright, who came to USC from his post as an assistant coach at Georgia,[28] the Gamecocks produced another undefeated Southern Conference season, (4–0–1), in 1941.[29] After the 1942 season, Enright joined the United States Navy serving as a lieutenant and working mostly in their athletic program in the United States.[28] After three head coaches (James P. Moran, Williams Newton, John D. McMillan) who had gone 10–10–5 combined in four years with one bowl appearance, Enright returned to the Gamecocks in 1946 as head football coach, and remained until 1955 when he resigned for health reasons.[28] He hired Warren Giese as his successor, and continued as athletic director until 1960. The Rex Enright Athletic Center on the South Carolina campus was named for him and the Rex Enright Award (also known as the Captain's Cup) given to the football captains of the previous season.[28] Enright gave-up his coaching duties in 1955 due to reasons related to poor health.[28] Enright retired with the distinction of being the head coach with the most wins and losses in school history (64–69–7), and he still retains the record for most school losses and is 2nd in wins.[28] Warren Giese, who was previously an assistant coach at Maryland, was hired as head coach in 1956,[30] and he led the Gamecocks to a 28–21–1 overall record in his 5-year tenure.[31] Giese employed a conservative, run-first game strategy, but he enthusiastically adopted the two-point conversion when it was made legal in 1958. That year, he also correctly predicted the rise of special teams after the NCAA relaxed its player substitution rules.[32] The Giese era included two 7–3 campaigns (1956 and 1958),[31] an 18–15–1 ACC record, and a 27–21 victory over Darrell Royal's 1957 Texas squad in Austin. Griese was replaced after a 3–6 season in 1960. Marvin Bass was hired away from Georgia Tech, where he served as defensive coordinator, as the Gamecocks head football coach.[33] He posted a 17–29–4 record in his four-year tenure and was replaced after five seasons due to the team's struggles and low fan support.[33][34] Paul Dietzel arrived in Columbia prior to the 1966 season, having previously coached at LSU, where he won a national championship, and Army.[35] In 1969, he led the Gamecocks to an ACC championship and an appearance in the Peach Bowl. As a result, Dietzel was named ACC Coach of the Year that season.[35] Soon after, South Carolina left the ACC and became an Independent program prior to the 1971 season.[36] Dietzel finished his USC tenure with a 42–53–1 overall record (18–10–1 ACC).[35] In addition to the 1969 ACC title, Dietzel's legacies at Carolina include his improvement of athletic facilities and his penning of a new fight song, which is still used to this day (\"The Fighting Gamecocks Lead the Way\").[37] Amid growing fan unrest after an upset loss to Duke, Dietzel announced that he would resign at the end of the season, which ended in a 4–7 record.[38] Jim Carlen, previously head football coach at Texas Tech and West Virginia, took over as coach in 1975.[39] Under his leadership the program achieved a measure of national prominence. Carlen led the Gamecocks to three bowl games,[39] coached 1980 Heisman Trophy winner George Rogers, and produced a 45–36–1 record during his tenure.[36] The Carlen Era included consecutive 8–4 finishes (1979–1980) and only one losing season in seven years.[39] The 1980 season was headlined by senior running back George Rogers, who led the nation in rushing with 1,894 yards. For his efforts, the Downtown Athletic Club named Rogers the winner of the 1980 Heisman Trophy award. Rogers beat out a strong group of players, including Georgia running back Herschel Walker. Behind the Rogers-led rushing attack, the Gamecocks went 8–4 overall and earned an appearance in the Gator Bowl. In addition, the 1980 Gamecocks defeated a heavily favored Michigan squad coached by the legendary Bo Schembechler. The 17–14 victory in Ann Arbor, which made Rogers a household name, was one of the biggest wins in both the Carlen Era and the program's history. Carlen retired from coaching after seven seasons at USC.[40] Joe Morrison was hired in 1983 following a one-year stint by Richard Bell.[41] After a 5–6 mark in his first year, the \"Man in Black\" led South Carolina to a 10–2 record, No. 11 final AP Poll ranking, and a Gator Bowl appearance in 1984. It was also before the 1984 season began that the team removed the Astroturf that had been in place at Williams–Brice Stadium since the early 1970s and reinstalled the natural grass that remains today. The 1984 season included victories over Georgia, Pittsburgh, Notre Dame, Florida State, and Clemson. The 1984 defense was called the \"Fire Ant\" defense. In 1987, the Gamecocks posted an 8–4 record, No. 15 Final AP Poll ranking, and another Gator Bowl trip.[42] The 1987 Gamecocks were led by the \"Black Death\" defense, which held seven opponents to 10 or fewer points and yielded just 141 points in 12 games played.[43] Morrison coached his last game in the 1988 Liberty Bowl,[42] as he died of a heart attack on February 5, 1989, at the age of 51.[41] He finished his USC tenure with a 39–28–2 overall record, three bowl appearances, and three seasons with 8 or more wins.[36][42] Due to his on-field success and \"Black Magic\" image (he traditionally wore all black on the sideline and introduced black uniforms into the team's rotation), Morrison remains a popular figure in Gamecock lore.[44] Morrison also began the tradition at Carolina, with his first game in 1983, of the pre-game entrance of the football team being the beginning of Also sprach Zarathustra, the theme from the film 2001: A Space Odyssey.[45] This is still part of the Carolina football game day experience over 40 years later.[46] Following Morrison's death, Sparky Woods was hired away from Appalachian State as head coach in 1989 and coached the Gamecocks until the end of the 1993 season.[47] He posted winning seasons in 1989 and 1990, but could not produce another winning campaign during his tenure.[47] Woods led the USC football program through the transition to the SEC and has the distinction of being South Carolina's first head coach in SEC play, as the Gamecocks entered the conference in 1992. Woods' overall record at South Carolina was 25–27–3.[47] Brad Scott left his post as offensive coordinator at Florida State and took over as the Gamecocks head coach in December 1993.[48] Despite modest preseason expectations, he led USC to a 7–5 record and a Carquest Bowl victory over West Virginia in his first season.[49] The bowl win was the first post-season victory in the program's long history. However, Scott was unable to capitalize on his early success. USC only had one non-losing record in SEC play during his tenure, only one other winning overall record, and won only six games in his final two seasons.[36] Scott was fired by athletics director Mike McGee after a 1–10 season in 1998 in which the Gamecocks lost their final ten games of the season.[50] Scott's final record at South Carolina was 23–32–1 in five seasons.[49] Former Notre Dame head coach Lou Holtz came out of retirement and was hired as USC's head coach in 1999.[51] He inherited a relatively young SEC program (joined in 1992) that posted only three winning seasons from 1990 to 1998.[52] USC won just a single game the year before Holtz's arrival and, subsequently, went 0–11 in his inaugural campaign.[53] It didn't take long for Holtz to improve the Gamecocks' fortunes, however, as he engineered 8–4 and 9–3 records in the 2000 and 2001 seasons.[54] In addition, USC won consecutive Outback Bowls over Ohio State and produced the most successful two-year run in program history (at the time), going 17–7 overall and 10–6 in SEC play.[54] The 2000 and 2001 campaigns also saw USC's return to the polls, as the Gamecocks turned in No. 19 and No. 13 rankings in the Final AP ballots for those years.[55][56] After consecutive 5–7 finishes in 2002 and 2003 (in which the team was ranked in the Top 25 during both seasons),[54] Holtz ended his USC tenure on a winning note with a 6–5 record in 2004[54] before retiring again.[57] Holtz finished with a 33–37 overall record at South Carolina.[36][54] In 2005, USC was placed on 3 years probation by the NCAA for actions during the coaching tenure of Lou Holtz,[58] all of which were self-reported by the school.[59] Five of these actions were considered major violations, and included such activities as impermissible tutoring and non-voluntary summer workouts as well as a \"lack of institutional control\".[60] Coach Holtz pointed out following the close of the investigation, \"There was no money involved. No athletes were paid. There were no recruiting inducements. No cars. No jobs offered. No ticket scandal, etc.\"[61] Former Washington Redskins and Florida head coach Steve Spurrier was hired in 2005 to replace the retiring Lou Holtz.[62][63] Spurrier led the Gamecocks to a 7–5 record and Independence Bowl appearance in his first season.[64] As a result, Spurrier was named the 2005 SEC Coach of the Year.[64] The 2006 season saw an 8–5 record and a victory over Houston in the Liberty Bowl. In 2007, the Gamecocks started the season 6–1, but would lose all of their next five games.[65] South Carolina posted consecutive 7–6 records in 2008 and 2009, returning to postseason play with appearances in the Outback Bowl and PapaJohns.com Bowl. They also defeated a Top 5 opponent for the first time ever in 2009 when they upset then-No. 4 Ole Miss 16–10 at home on a Thursday night.[64] In 2010, Spurrier scored another first with the first SEC Eastern Division Championship in school history[66] and the program's first win over a No. 1 team in program history, with a 35–21 victory over top-ranked, defending national champion Alabama.[67] In 2011, Spurrier led USC to its most successful season in program history.[68] The Gamecocks posted an 11–2 overall record, went 6–2 in SEC play,[64] and defeated No. 20 Nebraska in the Capital One Bowl[69] to earn Final Top 10 rankings in the AP and Coaches' Polls (No. 9 and No. 8, respectively). The University of South Carolina was investigated in 2011–12 by the NCAA regarding an estimated $59,000 in impermissible benefits provided to student-athletes including football players including discounted living expenses at a local hotel.[70] The school imposed its own punishment, paying $18,500 in fines and cutting three football scholarships in each of the 2013 and 2014 seasons, and reduction in official recruiting visits for the 2012–13 year.[71] The NCAA accepted these self-imposed punishments.[72] In 2012 Steve Spurrier, once again, led his South Carolina football team to double-digit wins during the course of the regular season campaign.[64] The 2012 regular season culminated with the annual season-ending game against arch-rival Clemson at Clemson's Memorial Stadium.[73][74] In 2013, Spurrier and the Gamecocks finished with another extremely successful 11–2 season capped by a 34–22 victory over the No. 19 Wisconsin in the 2014 Capital One Bowl.[75][76][77] South Carolina finished with the highest ranking in school history in the AP poll, ranked at No. 4 in the country.[76] On October 12, 2015, after a 2–4 start to the season, Spurrier announced to his team that he would be resigning, effective immediately.[78] Offensive line coach/co-offensive coordinator Shawn Elliott was named the team's interim head coach.[79] Elliott led the Gamecocks to victory the following week against Vanderbilt but lost the final five games of the season.[80] Many of South Carolina's most successful seasons came during the Steve Spurrier era, including a SEC East Division championship in 2010 and three consecutive eleven win seasons (2011–13).[81] Spurrier also boasted a 6–4 record against the school's in-state rival, Clemson, including five consecutive wins during the 2009–2013 seasons.[82] Auburn defensive coordinator and former Florida head coach Will Muschamp was named as South Carolina's new head coach on December 6, 2015.[10][83] The Will Muschamp era began with a victory over Vanderbilt by a score of 13–10.[84] After a 2–4 start, Carolina won four of their final six regular season contests, including a 24–21 victory over 18th-ranked Tennessee.[85] The Gamecocks' 2016 campaign ended with a 46–39 overtime loss to South Florida in the 2016 Birmingham Bowl.[86] In 2017 Muschamp led the Gamecocks to a 9–4 season.[87] The season started with a neutral site win against NC State in the Belk Kickoff Game in Charlotte, North Carolina.[88] In conference play South Carolina defeated five SEC schools: Florida, Tennessee, Missouri, Vanderbilt, and Arkansas, finishing second in the SEC East.[89] They finished the season with a 26–19 victory over Michigan in the Outback Bowl.[90][91][92] The 2018 season saw Muschamp and the Gamecocks finish with a 7–5 regular season finish and a 28–0 loss to Virginia in the Belk Bowl in Charlotte, NC. South Carolina finished the 2019 season with a mark of 4–8, highlighted by a road upset over Georgia. The 2020 season was played with a conference-only schedule, due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The Gamecocks started off the season 2-2, with a win over then No. 15 Auburn. The Gamecocks then lost three straight, allowing 159 points in the process. Muschamp was dismissed as head coach on November 15, 2020, after starting the 2020 season with a 2–5 record with Mike Bobo being named interim head coach for the rest of the season.[93][94] On December 6, 2020, University of South Carolina athletic director Ray Tanner announced that the school had hired Oklahoma associate head coach/tight ends coach Shane Beamer as its head coach.[95] Beamer, the son of legendary Virginia Tech head coach Frank Beamer,[96] led the 2021 Gamecocks to a 7–6 record, including a 38–21 win in the Duke's Mayo Bowl over North Carolina.[97] The Gamecocks' 2022 season displayed significant growth under Shane Beamer's leadership in his second year as head coach. Despite inconsistent offensive line play and a lackluster rush defense throughout the season, the Gamecocks finished on a high note, posting an 8–5 record and finishing the season ranked at No. 23 in both the Coaches and AP poll, their first top 25 finish since the 2013 season.[98] Additionally, Shane Beamer became the first coach in program history to win back-to-back games against top ten opponents after beating #5 Tennessee and their in-state rival #8 Clemson in weeks 12 and 13, respectively.[99] South Carolina's dominant 63–38 victory against Tennessee set the record for most points scored by an unranked team against a top-five team in college football history.[100] During the same game, South Carolina quarterback Spencer Rattler gave a legendary performance, throwing for 438 passing yards,six touchdowns, and no picks, breaking the school record for most touchdown passes in a single game.[101] The Gamecocks were invited to play against the #21 Notre Dame Fighting Irish in the TaxSlayer Gator Bowl. Although South Carolina played a competitive game with a relatively depleted roster, they ultimately lost to the Irish by a score of 45–38. The 2023 season saw a setback in the trajectory of the program. Despite quarterback Spencer Rattler and wide receiver Xavier Legette having two of the best individual seasons in school history in their final college year,[102][103][104][105] the team was noted by the media for being heavily affected by injuries, particularly from the offensive line.[106][107][108] South Carolina finished sixth in the final SEC East,[109][110][111] with an overall record of 5–7, missing a bowl game for the first time since 2020.[112] Shane Beamer achieved massive success with the Gamecocks during the 2024 season, despite media outlets projecting a 13th place finish in the SEC. After a middling 3-3 start to the first half of the season, Beamer turned the page on the narrative and trajectory of the program by leading the team to six straight wins to finish the regular season with a 9-3 record. Beamer set many records over the course of the season, which included leading the Gamecocks to it's first 6-game win streak since 2013, the first winning record in conference play since 2017, and defeated four ranked teams on the season, becoming the very first coach in program history to do so.[113]Season highlights included a dominant 44-20 victory against No. 10 Texas A&M at home, a thrilling 4-point victory over No. 23 Missouri at home - their first victory over that team since 2021, and a 17-14 road victory against archrival, No. 12 Clemson, spearheaded by an elite performance from freshman quarterback LaNorris Sellers. For his outstanding efforts, Shane Beamer was awarded SEC Coach of the year by the Associated Press and USA Today. South Carolina has affiliated with three conferences and twice been an independent.[114][115] South Carolina has had 36 head coaches.[116][117] Shane Beamer became head coach in 2020. † Interim The SEC was split into two divisions from 1992 to 2023, with the Gamecocks competing in the SEC East in that time.[118] South Carolina has 25 bowl appearances, with a 10–15 record overall.[119] The rivalry is the largest annual sporting event by ticket sales in the state of South Carolina. From 1896 to 1959, the Carolina-Clemson game was played on the fairgrounds in Columbia, South Carolina, and was referred to as \"Big Thursday.\" In 1960, an alternating-site format was implemented utilizing both teams' home stadiums. The annual game has since been officially designated \"The Palmetto Bowl\".[120] It is the 21st most played college football rivalry at 120 meetings. The Gamecocks won 5 in a row against Clemson between 2009 and 2013, Clemson then won 7 straight, but failed to extend their win streak in the series with a 31–30 loss in 2022. Clemson holds a 73–43–4 all-time lead in the series as of the conclusion of the 2023 season. The South Carolina Gamecocks did not play the Clemson Tigers in 2020 due to COVID-19 restrictions. A \"border rivalry\" dating to 1894. The 1980 game was between future Heisman Trophy winners George Rogers and Herschel Walker. Led by Walker's 219 rushing yards, Georgia won 13–10 and would go on to capture the National Championship. Rogers turned in 168 rushing yards during the course of the battle, setting the stage for a successful finish to his senior season and eventual Heisman Trophy award. The matchup has been televised yearly since 1997. The series has been far more competitive since USC joined the SEC in 1992. Georgia holds a 55–19–2 overall lead in the series as of the 2023 season.[121][122] A budding rivalry between the two schools located in cities named Columbia.[123] Although Missouri is the only school to beat the Gamecocks in multiple bowl games, the rivalry began in 2012, when Missouri joined South Carolina in the SEC East. A Mayor's Cup trophy is awarded to the winner of the annual game by the mayors of Columbia, South Carolina and Columbia, Missouri.[124] The rivalry began in 1903. While no longer a conference rivalry, since South Carolina left the ACC in 1971, the teams still meet occasionally. In the 2010s, the series had been played primarily on a Thursday. It was announced in September 2015 that USC and UNC will play every four years in 2019 and 2023.[125] South Carolina has won 7 out of the last 9 meetings; North Carolina leads the all-time series 36–20–4.[126] The Gamecocks, however have lead the series 13–7 since 1967, with the Tar Heels' overall lead in the series being reliant on victories from the earlier decades of the matchup. In 1933, under the direction of the legendary Billy Laval, the Gamecocks went undefeated in conference play. However, Duke would finish with a better conference record by one win and was awarded the championship.[127] In 1969, the Gamecocks won the ACC Championship by going undefeated in conference play. In its six ACC matchups, USC outscored its opponents by a 130–61 margin. The squad posted a 7–4 overall record with a Peach Bowl appearance against West Virginia to close the season (14–3 loss). Two years later, South Carolina left the ACC and competed as an Independent for two decades before joining the SEC in 1992. In 1980, the Gamecocks had a successful season led by running back George Rogers, who won the prestigious Heisman Trophy and was chosen #1 overall in the 1981 NFL draft. The team finished 8–4, with the biggest win coming against the eventual Big Ten champion Michigan Wolverines in front of a crowd of over 104,000 at Michigan Stadium. Led by Coach Morrison, the 1984 Gamecocks became the first team in school history to win 10 games (10–2 record) and were ranked as high as No. 2 in the polls before losing to an unranked Navy team 38–21 in the 10th game of the season. The Gamecocks finished No. 11 in the final AP Poll. Along the way, they defeated Georgia, Pittsburgh, Notre Dame, Florida State, and Clemson to earn an appearance in the Gator Bowl against Oklahoma State (21–14 loss). At the time, the No. 11 final ranking was the highest ever achieved by South Carolina. The team was nicknamed \"Black Magic\" due to their success and their distinctive black jerseys.[128] South Carolina made one of the biggest turnarounds in college football history, going from a winless season in 1999 to an eight-win campaign in 2000. Their first win of the season, against New Mexico State, came two years to the day after their previous win, against Ball State on September 2, 1998. South Carolina's turnaround in conference play was also one of the biggest in SEC history, going from 0–8 in 1999, to 5–3 in 2000 including a victory against a heavily favored Georgia team that ended the Gamecocks' SEC losing streak. South Carolina fans tore down the goalposts at Williams-Brice Stadium on both occasions in celebration. On New Year's Day 2001, the Gamecocks defeated Ohio State in the Outback Bowl in Tampa, Florida. South Carolina finished the season ranked #19 in the AP Poll and #21 in the Coaches Poll. In 2010, the Gamecocks won their first SEC Eastern Division Championship, going 5–3 in conference play.[129] For the first time in school history, they defeated the No. 1 ranked team in the country (Alabama) and won at Florida in the division-clinching game.[129] The season also included victories over division foes Georgia, Tennessee, and Vanderbilt as well as instate Atlantic Coast Conference rival Clemson.[129] In their first appearance in the SEC Championship Game, the Gamecocks lost to No. 1 Auburn, 56–17. Led by Coach Spurrier, the 2011 Gamecocks achieved its most wins in a single season and finished in the Top 10 for the first time in program history. USC posted an 11–2 overall record, went 6–2 in SEC play, and won the Capital One Bowl to finish No. 9/8 in the final AP and Coaches' Polls (respectively). Along the way, USC defeated Georgia, Tennessee, Florida, and Clemson to extend its winning streak over its biggest rivals to 3 games. This was also the first season that USC posted a 5–0 record against their SEC Eastern Division opponents. Spurrier's 2012 Gamecocks went 11–2, with their only losses coming at LSU and at Florida in consecutive weeks. USC defeated rival Clemson 27–17 in Death Valley to end the regular season. They then defeated Michigan 33–28 in the 2013 Outback Bowl with the game decided by a 28-yard touchdown pass from Dylan Thompson to Bruce Ellington with under a minute to go. The Gamecocks finished the season ranked No. 8/7 in the final AP and Coaches' Polls respectively. Again led by Coach Spurrier, the 2013 Gamecocks went 11–2, with their losses coming at Georgia and at Tennessee. Notable wins included Vanderbilt, UCF, and Missouri all of which finished ranked in the top 25. USC finished the regular season by defeating rival Clemson 31–17, marking Carolina's fifth straight win over their in-state rival. This was also the first Palmetto Bowl between top ten teams, with Carolina and Clemson ranked No. 10 and No. 6 respectively. South Carolina also completed their second consecutive season with an undefeated record on their home field, Williams–Brice Stadium. The Gamecocks' 18 game home win streak, dating back to the 2011 season, was good for the longest home winning streak in the nation at the time. The team ended the season with a 34–24 victory over Wisconsin in the 2014 Capital One Bowl. The Gamecocks finished the season ranked No. 4 in both the final AP and Coaches' polls, marking the first top five finish in program history. The Gamecocks posted an 8–5 record and finished the season ranked at No. 23 in both the Coaches and AP poll, their first top 25 finish since the 2013 season. Shane Beamer became the first coach in program history to win back-to-back games against top ten opponents after beating #5 Tennessee and their in-state rival #8 Clemson. South Carolina's dominant 63–38 victory against Tennessee set the record for most points scored by an unranked team against a top-five team in college football history. Predicted to win five games and finish thirteenth in the SEC,[130][131] South Carolina achieved the eighth nine-win season in program history.[132] The Gamecocks recorded their first 5–3 conference record since 2017 and the first of Beamer's tenure.[133] They defeated three conference opponents on the road for the first time since 2011.[134] Shane Beamer broke the record for most wins in the first four seasons by a Gamecock head coach,[135] and he was named the SEC Coach of the Year.[136][137][138] Following a disappointing and controversial first half of the season,[130][139] which saw close losses to LSU and Alabama as well as a blowout loss to Ole Miss,[140] the Gamecocks won the last six games in the regular season.[140] In this stretch, South Carolina defeated four straight conference opponents for the first time since 2005;[a] they also defeated four ranked teams and won all three trophy games for the first time in program history.[140][142][143] Two of those trophy games were decided by late-game touchdowns.[144][145] The winning streak earned South Carolina consideration for the College Football Playoff,[146][147][135][148] but they were instead selected to play Illinois in the Citrus Bowl.[149] The Gamecocks are led by redshirt freshman quarterback LaNorris Sellers as well as a defense that ranks among the best in the nation and school history.[148][150][151] Kyle Kennard won the Bronko Nagurski Trophy, honoring him as the top defensive player in college football, and was a finalist for the Lombardi Award.[152][153] Dylan Stewart is a finalist for the Shaun Alexander Freshman of the Year Award.[154] Following the regular season, Sellers began receiving consideration as one of the best players in the country.[155][135] From 2003 to 2006, Syvelle Newton played multiple positions for the Gamecocks and left his mark on the national record books in the process. He became one of only four players in college football history to record 600+ yards passing, rushing, and receiving (each) in a collegiate career.[160] In Newton's four seasons, he posted 2,474 passing yards (20 TD, 13 INT), 786 rushing yards (10 TD), and 673 receiving yards (3 TD). He also returned 6 kickoffs for 115 yards (19.2 average) and made 18 tackles and an assisted sack in limited defensive action. Garnet and black have been South Carolina’s uniform colors of choice throughout the program’s history.[178] The gamecock first appeared on South Carolina’s helmet in 1966, and has remained on the helmet in some form since 1969.[178][179] Since 1975, South Carolina has used the 'Block C' primary logo on its helmets,[178][179] and has intermittently featured the script \"Carolina\" and \"Gamecocks\" on the front of its jerseys.[citation needed] While the jersey used \"Gamecocks\" for much of the 1980s and early 1990s, it has solely used \"Carolina\" on its jersey since the late 1990s.[citation needed] Also, as South Carolina's flagship university,[133][180][181][130] USC prominently displays the state flag, and imagery derived from it.[182][183] Since 2007, South Carolina has partnered with Under Armour as its official uniform supplier, replacing Russell Athletic. Under Armour has modified the Gamecocks’ look several times, with altered piping, varying font sizes, et cetera.[178] For example, before the 2013 season, a new uniform was unveiled with eleven total stripes, the same number of buildings on The Horseshoe, the most famous part of the South Carolina campus and a national historic landmark.[184] In 2016, South Carolina signed a ten-year extension with Under Armour, which at the time was reportedly the second-most valuable deal in the SEC and seventh-most valuable in the nation. This deal will expire on June 30, 2026.[185][186][187] In support of the Wounded Warrior Project, USC wore a special uniform against Florida in 2009, against Auburn in 2011, and against LSU in 2012.[188][178] In several seasons, South Carolina has worn \"throwback\" uniforms, including homages to the 1980s in 2019,[189] and to the 1980 season in 2024.[190] The University of South Carolina makes a distinction between retired jerseys and retired numbers. Since 2007, the current athletics department policy states that the school retires jerseys, not numbers. Numbers retired prior to 2007 will continue to be in a retired state, while current and future student-athletes can wear numbers that were affiliated with jersey retirements after 2007.[140] Four players' numbers have been retired, while an additional two players' jerseys have been retired.[191][140][192] As of September 2023, South Carolina had 21 players on active rosters in the NFL, which ranked tied for 21st in the country.[197] The following is a list of Gamecock players in the NFL in any capacity (active rosters, practice squads, reserve lists, et cetera), as of September 2024.[198][199] Sixteen Gamecock players have been selected in the first round of the NFL Draft, which is 44th in the nation, as of 2024.[202][203] From 1992 to 2023, South Carolina played in the East Division of the SEC and played each opponent in the division each year along with several teams from the West Division. The SEC expanded the conference to 16 teams and eliminated its two divisions in 2024, causing a new scheduling format for the Gamecocks to play against the other members of the conference.[204] Only the 2024 conference schedule was announced on June 14, 2023, while the conference still considers a new format for the future.[205] Announced schedules as of August 26, 2024.[206] †† Will be played at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia Seifried, C.S., & Bolton, C.

                "content": "The LSU Tigers football program, also known as the Fighting Tigers, represents Louisiana State University in college football. The Tigers compete in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and the Western Division of the Southeastern Conference (SEC). LSU ranks 16th best in winning percentage in NCAA Division I FBS history and claims four national championships (1958, 2003, 2007, and 2019), 16 conference championships, and 39 consensus All-Americans.[4] Three players for the Tigers have won the Heisman Trophy: Billy Cannon (1959), Joe Burrow (2019), and Jayden Daniels (2023). The team plays on the university's campus at Tiger Stadium in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The program's current head coach is Brian Kelly. Dr. Charles E. Coates, a chemistry professor at the university known for his work on sugar, and former football player at Johns Hopkins, assembled a group of students to create the school's first team. Coates' plan for a football team dated back to autumn of the previous year, when he assembled a team and held one or two scrimmages before shelving the idea for the following autumn. The team wore makeshift uniforms with purple and gold ribbons for its first game, a 34–0 loss to Tulane and the only game played by LSU that year. The game was played in front of a crowd of 1,500 at Crescent City Base Ball Park in New Orleans.[5] The game sparked a rivalry between the schools that lasted well into the 20th century. Future Louisiana governor Ruffin G. Pleasant was the quarterback and captain of the LSU team. According to legend, purple and gold were chosen because they were Mardi Gras colors, and the green was sold out.[n 1] The game was the only one Coates ever coached, and the only football game Pleasant played in. Pleasant was later inducted into the LSU Athletic Hall of Fame.[6] LSU achieved its first victory by beating Natchez Athletic Club 26–0 in 1894. Samuel Marmaduke Dinwidie Clark has the honor of scoring the very first touchdown in LSU history. The first football game played on the LSU campus was at State Field on December 3, 1894, a loss against Mississippi. LSU's only touchdown in that game was scored by the head coach, Albert Simmonds.[7] This was the first year of play for William S. Slaughter who lettered as an end for 5 years (1894, 1895, 1896, 1897, 1898). Slaughter was LSU's first five time football letterman. By 1895, LSU had its first win in Baton Rouge. In 1896 LSU hired Allen Jeardeau of Platteville, Wisconsin. LSU went undefeated, winning the school's first conference championship in the school's first year as a member of the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association (SIAA), the first southern athletics. conference.[8] Tulane was forced to forfeit for its attempt to play Hall of Fame Penn back George H. Brooke.[9] This was the first team to be called the \"Tigers.\" The mascot was reputed to be named after the “Fighting Tigers,” the name of the 9th Louisiana Infantry in the Civil War.[10] Coach Jeardeau returned for his second but final year at LSU in 1897 for two games in Baton Rouge. A yellow fever outbreak throughout the South caused the postponement of LSU's classes starting, and the football season being cut back to only two games. Another outbreak of yellow fever similar to the one in 1897 caused LSU to play only one game in 1898. By the time LSU was able to play its only game of the season, Allen Jeardeau had departed from the school as head football coach, and no provision had been made to replace him. The job of coach then fell to the team's captain, Edmond Chavanne, thus the first LSU alumnus to coach the team. New coach John P. Gregg led the Tigers to a 1–4 season in 1899, including a loss to the \"iron men\" of Sewanee. The only wins were in an exhibition game against a high school team (which LSU does not officially record as a win) and against rival, Tulane. It was the first year of play for LSU's second five-year letterman, John J. Coleman (1899, 1900, 1901, 1902, 1903). Chavanne was rehired in 1900, posting a 2–2 record. Chavanne was replaced by W. S. Borland as head coach in 1901, leading the team to a successful 5–1 season. After the Tulane game, a 22–0 loss, LSU protested to the SIAA, and alleged that Tulane had used a professional player during the game. Several months later, the SIAA ruled the game an 11–0 forfeit in favor of LSU.[11] The seven-game 1902 season was the longest yet for the Tigers and also featured the most games on the road. LSU upset Texas, avenged last season's loss to Auburn, and lost only to Vanderbilt, which claimed an SIAA title after the win. The 1903 season broke the previous season's record for most games played (seven) with nine games. Dan A. Killian coached the Tigers from 1904 to 1906. Back René A. Messa made some All-Southern teams in 1904. The 1905 team went 3–0. In 1907, LSU became the first American college football team to play on foreign soil in the Bacardi Bowl against the University of Havana on Christmas Day in Havana, Cuba. LSU won 56–0. John Seip ran back a 67-yard punt return. The 1908 team posted an undefeated 10–0 record. Quarterback Doc Fenton led the nation in scoring with 132 points, posting then school records of 36 extra points and 6 field goals. Mike Lally was his running mate in the backfield. LSU beat Auburn 10–2, Seip going over for the first touchdown. Auburn's 2 was had by a safety, after T. C. Locke blocked Fenton's punt. Fenton could not recover the fumble because he was knocked unconscious by a spectator's cane.[12] The National Championship Foundation retroactively awarded 1908 LSU the national championship though it is not claimed by LSU. This season also led to an SIAA championship; but was clouded by accusations of professionalism from Grantland Rice and rival school Tulane.[13] Auburn and Vanderbilt were among those listed as alternative conference champions. Both Fenton and Seip were inaugural inductees into the LSU Athletic Hall of Fame. 1910 was a disastrous year for the Tigers. After a strong 1909 campaign under coaches Joe Pritchard and John W. Mayhew, which saw their only conference loss come to SIAA champion Sewanee, the team lost some star power; Stovall, Lally, and Seip had all graduated.[14] Pat Dwyer, an assistant at Auburn in 1908, was hired in 1911. He once used guard Tom Dutton for a \"kangaroo play\" in which back Lawrence Dupont would crawl between Dutton's legs; supposedly very effective in short yardage situations.[15] The 1913 team lost only to SIAA champion Auburn by a touchdown. Fullback Alf Reid made All-Southern.[16] LSU's largest loss margin came on October 31, 1914 in a game against Texas A&M in Dallas, Texas. The final score was Texas A&M 63, LSU 9. In 1916, Walter Camp gave Phillip Cooper honorable mention on his All-America team. Irving Pray and Dana X. Bible also served as the Tigers coach in 1916 Washington's Wayne Sutton coached the 1917 team to a 3–5 record. Irving Pray coached full seasons in 1919 and 1922, the inaugural season of the Southern Conference (SoCon). Branch Bocock led the Tigers for the 1921 season, in which they were beaten only by Tulane.[17] Mike Donahue came from Auburn to be the seventeenth head football coach at LSU in 1923. The biggest win in Donahue's tenure was probably the 20–14 victory over Indiana in 1924.[18] The final game of the 1924 season saw the first game played at Tiger Stadium, with an original seating capacity of 12,000, on Thanksgiving Day against Tulane. 18,000 fans managed to fit into the stadium to watch the Green Wave defeat the Tigers 13–0.[19] In 1925, the team's first full season in Tiger Stadium began with shutout wins over Louisiana Normal and Southwestern Louisiana. The following week coach Wallace Wade's national champion Alabama blew-out LSU in Tiger Stadium, 42–0, which was at the time the worst home loss in school history.[19] The 1925 team also beat John Heisman's Rice team, but ended the season with a second straight shutout loss to Tulane. Donahue resigned after the 1927 season, less than two months after signing a six-year contract extension with the team.[20] LSU compiled a record of 23 wins, 19 losses, and three ties while with Donahue, which included a 5–14–2 record in SoCon games.[21] Vanderbilt coach Dan McGugin recommended Russ Cohen for the LSU job.[22] Cohen's best year at LSU was his first, in 1928. Led by All-Southern captain Jess Tinsley, Tigers posted a 6–2–1 record, suffering losses to Arkansas and Wallace Wade's Alabama Crimson Tide. Star halfback Percy Brown broke his shoulder against Alabama.[23] The tie was to Bill Banker and rival Tulane, which was as good as its ever been from 1929 to 1931. In 1931 LSU played its first night game in Tiger Stadium, a 31–0 victory over Spring Hill. Under West Point's Biff Jones, the 1932 team tied for the Southern Conference championship in its last season as a member of the conference. The 1933 lost no games and was led by track and field athlete Jack Torrance. Jones resigned after the 1934 season after a heated exchange with noted LSU supporter, Louisiana senator Huey P. Long.[24] In the last game of the season, Long was displeased after the team had lost two straight games and were trailing at halftime to Oregon. Long decided to give a motivational speech to the team at halftime, but was turned away by Jones at the locker room door.[25] The ensuing argument ended with Jones declaring to resign, effective at the end of the game.[24] Gaynell Tinsley, the cousin of Jess, has a profile at the College Football Hall of Fame which describes him this way: \"Tinsley was a magnificent athletic specimen, standing 6-0, and weighing 196-pounds, size he used equally well as a defensive stalwart who was a blocking master.\"[26] As a sophomore in 1934, Tinsley had a 65-yard pass reception, thrown by halfback Abe Mickal, against Southern Methodist University, which stood as a record for several years as \"the longest pass in Southern football history.\"[26] Under head coach Bernie Moore, LSU won their first Southeastern Conference (SEC) Championship finishing with a 5–0 conference record and 9–2–0 overall in 1935. LSU played in their first Sugar Bowl game, falling to No. 4 TCU 3–2 at Tulane Stadium. The Tigers and Horned Frogs both took home the Williamson Poll national championship, which is not claimed by LSU. End Gaynell Tinsley was named a consensus All-American in 1935 and 1936, becoming the first All-America selection for LSU. Coach Moore once said, \"Tinsley could have made All-American at any position. He was so tough, he made blockers quit. He's the greatest lineman I ever saw.\" Along with Tinsley in the line were Marvin Stewart, Justin Rukas, and Jeff Barrett. In the backfield were Mickal, Jesse Fatherree, and Pinky Rohm – all members of LSU's \"Early Days\" team of the century.[27] The team's quarterback was Bill May, awarded the Jacobs Blocking Trophy in 1936. The 1936 team won the school's second SEC Championship finishing with a 6–0 conference record and 9–1–1 overall. The Tigers finished runner-up to Minnesota in the AP Poll. LSU won the Williamson Poll and Sagarin Ratings national championships, which are not claimed by the school. LSU's largest margin of victory, and most points scored in a football game came on November 21, in a game at Tiger Stadium against USL (University of Southwestern Louisiana, now University of Louisiana Lafayette). The final score was LSU 93, USL 0. The 1937 team featured Ken Kavanaugh and was upset by Vanderbilt using a hidden ball trick, the school's first-ever victory over a ranked opponent.[28] This season also featured the first game in the Florida–LSU football rivalry, which was won 19–0 by LSU. In 1939, in a game against Holy Cross, Kavanaugh caught four touchdown passes in the 26–7 win. According to Kavanaugh and teammate Young Bussey, Kavanaugh found four rusty nails on the sideline during the game. The next week against Rice, he found another nail and scored another touchdown to give LSU a 7–0 win. The pattern continued against Loyola and Vanderbilt, as Kavanaugh found two nails before each game and in each scored two touchdowns. A sportswriter for the Baton Rouge Advocate claimed he saw coach Moore at a local store stocking up on nails before LSU's game against No. 1 Tennessee.[29] Kavanaugh failed to score in the game, however, and the Tigers lost 20–0.[30] The Nashville Banner named Kavanaugh co-MVP of the Southeastern Conference along with Bob Foxx of Tennessee.[31][32] Kavanaugh was a consensus All-America selection for the 1939 All-America Team. The 1943 team was led by Steve Van Buren, moved to running back because of a lack of players due to World War II conscription,[33] and won the Orange Bowl. Van Buren led the NCAA in scoring that season, with 98 points (110 including the bowl game). The 1946 team played in one of the most notable instances of the Cotton Bowl Classic – \"Ice Bowl.\" LSU, led by head coach Moore and quarterback Y. A. Tittle, entered the game against Arkansas with a 9–1 record. Ice, sleet and snow pelted the stadium as LSU players filled oil drums with charcoal and started fires for makeshift heaters while fans built fires in the stands. LSU dominated the game with a 271–54 advantage in total yards and 15–1 advantage in first downs, but that did not equate to the numbers on the scoreboard; the game ended in a 0–0 tie and LSU finished the season 9–1–1. In 1948, Moore retired, and Gaynell Tinsley, who had been working as an assistant, was promoted to replace his former mentor.[34] The 1949 team made it to the Sugar Bowl, where it was swamped by Oklahoma. Tinsley became the first person to participate in the Sugar Bowl as both a player and a head coach.[35] Tinsley's LSU teams never met with the same success they had achieved in 1949. In seven years as head coach at LSU, Tinsley's teams compiled a record of 35–34–6.[36] In 1955, Paul Dietzel became the head coach at LSU.[37] Jim Taylor was an All-American in 1957, and led the SEC in scoring in 1956 and 1957. During Dietzel's first three years, none of his teams had a winning season. In 1958, however, Dietzel came up with a unique \"three-platoon system.\" Instead of replacing individual players during the game, Dietzel would bring in an entirely new set of players between plays and series. The three teams were called the White Team (the first-string offense and defense), the Gold (Go) Team (the second-string offense), and the Chinese Bandits (the second-string defense). The system worked, as the 1958 team won the school's first claimed national championship, beating No. 12 Clemson 7–0 in the Sugar Bowl. The only score was a pass from Billy Cannon to sophomore Mickey Mangham, one of the smallest players on the team. Cannon won the Heisman Trophy in 1959. On Halloween, late in the game between No. 1 LSU and No. 3 Ole Miss, LSU was trailing 3–0. Cannon returned a punt 89 yards for a TD, breaking seven tackles. This has become known as Cannon's Halloween Run. The Rebels then drove down the field but were stopped on the LSU 1-yard line as the game ended resulting in a 7–3 victory for LSU in Tiger Stadium. In the Sugar Bowl, one of the most anticipated rematches in college football history took place. This game, however, would not be the classic that transpired only weeks before. Ole Miss dominated the game from start to finish and came away with a decisive 21–0 win over the Tigers. LSU finished the season having only given up 29 points. Dietzel left for Army after the 1961 season, and Charles \"Charlie\" McClendon, an assistant since 1953, was named his successor. McClendon picked up where Dietzel left off, with three top ten finishes in his first four years. Doug Moreau broke Fenton's record of 6 field goals in 1965. In the 1966 Cotton Bowl, unranked LSU upset undefeated and No. 2 ranked Arkansas, winning the game 14–7 and snapping Arkansas' 22-game winning streak.[38] In 1972, number 6 LSU survived an upset bid from unranked Ole Miss in Tiger Stadium by winning the game on a touchdown pass from quarterback Bert Jones to running back Brad Davis. Ole Miss fans say the 1972 contest featured a few seconds of free football. The Tigers trailed the Rebels 16–10 with four seconds to play. After a lengthy incompletion by Jones, the game clock still showed one second remaining. The Tigers used the precious second to win the game on the last play, 17–16. A song was written to commemorate the game, called One Second Blues, which is featured on the album \"Hey Fightin' Tigers\".[39] The alleged home-clock advantage inspired a sign at the Louisiana state line, leaving Mississippi, reading, \"You are now entering Louisiana. Set your clocks back four seconds.\"[40][41] For that year, the Ole Miss yearbook reported the score for the game as \"Ole Miss 16, LSU 10 + 7 \". After having just four coaches over 44 years from 1935 to 1979, the team went through eight coaches in a 20-year period from 1980 to 1999. This stretch began with the death of Bo Rein in a plane crash before coaching a single game for the Tigers.[42] Following the 1979 season, NC State head coach Bo Rein was hired to replace McClendon as LSU's head coach. In January 1980, Rein took a recruiting trip to Shreveport, Louisiana. On his January 10, 1980, return trip back to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, his private aircraft crashed, leaving no survivors.[43] Rein and experienced pilot Louis Benscotter left Shreveport in a Cessna 441 aircraft. The flight was planned to be a 40-minute trip, but when Benscotter rerouted east to avoid a storm, air traffic control lost contact with him. The aircraft climbed to 40,000 feet and kept heading due east. After being tracked on radar, the aircraft was eventually intercepted by U.S. Air National Guard Convair F-106 Delta Dart fighter aircraft over North Carolina, a thousand miles off-course and at an altitude of 41,600 ft (12,700 m), 6,600 ft (2,000 m) feet higher than its maximum certified ceiling. The military pilots could not see anyone in the cockpit and the aircraft continued on over the Atlantic Ocean, where it crashed after running out of fuel. A US Coast Guard crew spotted some debris, but no wreckage was ever recovered. The bodies of Rein and Benscotter have never been found.[44] The cause of the crash is undetermined but was most likely cabin depressurization causing hypoxia, a lack of oxygen,[45] resulting in the occupants losing consciousness as in the 1999 South Dakota Learjet crash.[46] Rein's two-month stint at LSU is the fourth shortest head coaching stint in FBS history, behind only George O'Leary's five-day tenure at Notre Dame in December 2001, Mike Haywood's sixteen-day stint at Pittsburgh in December 2010 and Manny Diaz's eighteen-day stint as Temple head coach in December 2018.[47] Jerry Stovall was hired to replace Rein as head coach in 1980.[48] LSU defeated Alabama 20–10 in Birmingham, Alabama in Bear Bryant's last game coaching against LSU, in 1982. LSU's defense held Alabama to 119 yards of total offense,[49] as the Tigers defeated the Tide for the first time since 1970. \"You don't understand how it feels to get hit in the mouth for 11 years,\" Stovall said in the locker room after the game. \"This is going to feel pretty good when it soaks in.\"[50] 1983 was the first season calling LSU football for radio play-by-play man Jim Hawthorne, who served in this role until the 2016 season and became known as the \"Voice of the Tigers\".[51] LSU finished that season with a record of 4–7, and Stovall was dismissed as LSU's head coach.[52] Only two hours after the firing of Stovall, LSU hired Miami Dolphins defensive coordinator Bill Arnsparger as head coach.[53] As the LSU head coach, Arnsparger led the Tigers to two Sugar Bowl berths in three seasons, in 1984 and 1986, both times against Nebraska. In 1984, LSU finished second behind Florida, but because of NCAA rules violations and a postseason ban on Florida, earned the Southeastern Conference (SEC) champion's automatic bid to the Sugar Bowl, with a panel of administrations subsequently voting to strip Florida of the conference championship as part of a reform that prohibits teams on NCAA postseason ban sanctions from earning conference championships. His 1986 LSU squad won the school's first outright SEC title since 1970 and the Tigers' last in the pre-championship game era, though the season was marred somewhat by an upset home loss to Miami University, his alma mater. By 1985, Arnsparger was growing frustrated with various scandals in the LSU athletic department, particularly involving basketball coach Dale Brown. After Sports Illustrated ran a cover story about the university's issues, Arnsparger met privately with athletic director Bob Brodhead to complain that the negative coverage was harming football recruiting and to threaten to leave the school if something wasn't done. Shortly after the final regular season game in 1986, Arnsparger announced he was resigning to become the athletic director at Florida.[54] Mike Archer came to LSU as an assistant coach in 1984 after being both a player and an assistant coach at Miami. He replaced Bill Arnsparger as the LSU Tigers football head coach in 1987 when Arnsparger left to become the athletic director at the University of Florida.[55] Archer was Arnsparger's defensive coordinator in 1985 and 1986, and was Arnsparger's hand-picked successor. When Archer took the LSU head coaching job, he was 34 years old, the youngest head coach in Division I-A football. Archer was chosen over a number of interviewed candidates, which reportedly included Steve Spurrier, Mike Shanahan, and Mack Brown. In 1987, LSU finished the season ranked #5 in both major polls with a 10–1–1 record, blemished only by a tie against Ohio State and a loss to Alabama. The latter was all that kept the Tigers out of the 1988 Sugar Bowl; Auburn went instead. It was LSU's first 10-win season in more than 25 years. In 1988, unranked LSU staged a near-literal, earth-shattering upset victory over No. 4 Auburn in Tiger Stadium, winning the game 7–6 with 1:41 remaining on a touchdown pass from quarterback Tommy Hodson to tailback Eddie Fuller. The reaction of the crowd was so immense that it registered as an earthquake on a seismograph in LSU's Howe-Russell Geoscience Complex.[56] It was later dubbed \"The Earthquake Game\" by ESPN.[57] After back-to-back losing seasons in 1989 and 1990, Archer was forced to resign.[58] He lost four of his last five games in 1990, the lone win coming in the season finale against Tulane. Archer was replaced by Southern Miss head coach Curley Hallman.[59] During Hallman's first season in 1991, several of Hallman's football players were accused of instigating a fight with LSU men's basketball players, including All-American Shaquille O'Neal, in Broussard Hall, LSU's athletic dormitory, two days prior to the Tigers' contest with Mississippi State.[60][61] LSU started the 1991 season with one-sided losses to Georgia (31–10) and Hallman's alma mater, Texas A&M (45–7), and finished 5–6. The season marked the second time LSU suffered three consecutive losing seasons, and the first time since 1954 to 1956. The 1992 season included being shut out 32–0 by Ole Miss on Halloween, and beaten 30–6 at Arkansas in the season finale, which was the first meeting between the Tigers and the Razorbacks upon Arkansas joining the SEC. The Tigers finished 2–9, still the worst in school history. In 1993, LSU's centennial football season, the Tigers lost 58–3 to the Florida Gators in Tiger Stadium, the worst loss in school history. Amazingly, just four weeks after that, the Tigers stunned the Alabama Crimson Tide, 17–13, at Bryant–Denny Stadium in Tuscaloosa, ending the Tide's 31-game unbeaten streak. LSU entered the season finale at 5–5, with a chance at its first bowl bid since the end of the 1988 season. However, the Tigers gave up 412 yards rushing in a 42–24 loss to Arkansas at home. The beginning of the end for Hallman came on September 17, 1994, at Jordan–Hare Stadium against Auburn. LSU led 23–9 early in the fourth quarter, and the Bayou Bengals were in good position to end Auburn's 13-game winning streak. But LSU quarterback Jamie Howard threw two interceptions that were returned for Auburn touchdowns, tying the game. LSU regained the lead with a field goal, but when the Bayou Bengals were trying to run out the clock, Howard threw his fourth interception of the game, and incredibly, Auburn returned the pick for another touchdown, giving the home team a 30–26 lead. LSU drove into Auburn territory in the game's final minute, but Howard threw his fifth and sixth interceptions on consecutive drives, sealing the win for Auburn. LSU never recovered, and ultimately finished 4–7. On November 12, LSU lost to Southern Miss, Hallman's former team, 20–18 in front of the smallest Death Valley crowd since 1974 (announced attendance was 51,718, but LSU officials estimated the actual crowd was closer to 40,000). Two days later, LSU athletic director Joe Dean gave Hallman an ultimatum–resign or be fired. When Hallman refused to resign, Dean fired him, though he was allowed to finish out the season.[62] He closed out his career at LSU with a 30–12 win over Arkansas—the Tigers' first regular-season win in the series since 1956. His overall record was 16–28; his winning percentage of .364 is the worst for a non-interim coach in school history. On December 13, 1994, LSU hired Vanderbilt head coach Gerry DiNardo as Hallman's replacement.[63] Prior to the 1995 season, DiNardo petitioned the NCAA to reverse a rule which had been in place since 1983 that prohibited teams from wearing white jerseys at home. After the ruling, LSU was able to wear its white jerseys at home in Tiger Stadium for the first time since 1982.[64] For its first home game of the 1995 season in what was dubbed the “Bring Back the Magic\" Game, LSU in white jerseys upset No. 5 Auburn, winning 12–6.[65] With no time remaining in the game, LSU defensive back Troy Twillie intercepted Auburn quarterback Patrick Nix's 11-yard pass into the end zone to secure the victory.[65] The Tigers achieved their first winning season in six seasons and finished with a 7–4–1 record defeating a Nick Saban led Michigan State team in the 1995 Independence Bowl.[66] After nine straight losses to Steve Spurrier-led Florida, the No. 14 Tigers defeated the No. 1 ranked defending national champion Gators 28–21 in Tiger Stadium in 1997. LSU running back Kevin Faulk was featured on the following week's cover of Sports Illustrated with the title \"See you later, Gators.\"[67] In a game referred to as, \"No. 1 Falls,\" it was the first time LSU defeated a No. 1 ranked team and the first time the goalposts were ever torn down in Tiger Stadium.[68] In 1998, LSU started the season with a preseason ranking of No. 9. They climbed to No. 6 before losing to No. 12 Georgia on October 3. The next week the No. 11-ranked Tigers lost to the No. 6 Florida. After the loss to the Gators, LSU dropped 13 of the next 17 games, including losses to a No. 10 Notre Dame and No. 13 Arkansas later in the 1998 season. In 1999 LSU lost to No. 10 Georgia, No. 8 Florida, No. 12 Mississippi State, No. 25 Ole Miss, and No. 12 Alabama.[69] On November 15, 1999, two days after the Tigers lost to unranked Houston at home, LSU chancellor Mark Emmert fired DiNardo with one game remaining in the season. DiNardo was given the option to coach the final game of the season against Arkansas, but DiNardo declined.[70] Instead, offensive line coach Hal Hunter was named interim coach, leading LSU to a 35–10 victory over the Razorbacks. On December 1, 1999, LSU hired Michigan State head coach Nick Saban as DiNardo's replacement.[71] In Saban's first season of 2000, LSU returned to national prominence by beating No. 11 Tennessee in overtime 38–31 on ESPN, after which the goal posts were torn down for only the 2nd time in the history of Tiger Stadium. The victory over Tennessee also marked the first time that LSU played in an overtime game at home. Just a few weeks later, the goal posts were again ripped down as LSU beat Alabama 30–28 on CBS in Baton Rouge for the first time in 31 years. This was the 3rd and final time that the goal posts came down in Death Valley. In 2001, No. 21 LSU staged an upset victory over No. 2 Tennessee in the SEC Championship, winning 31–20. The victory earned LSU a spot in its first Sugar Bowl since 1986, and knocked the Volunteers out of national title contention. No. 16 LSU survived an upset bid from unranked Kentucky in 2002 by winning the game 33–30 on a miraculous 75-yard Hail Mary pass as time expired known as the \"Bluegrass Miracle\". Kentucky coach Guy Morriss had received the traditional Gatorade bath right before the Hail Mary. Kentucky fans, believing they had won, had already rushed the field and torn down one goal post. In 2003, No. 11 LSU outlasted No. 7 Georgia, 17–10. With ESPN College Gameday on hand for the first time since 1997, Quarterback Matt Mauck found wide receiver Skyler Green for a 34-yard touchdown with 3:03 remaining in the game. All-American cornerback Corey Webster sealed the victory with an interception in the final minute. The contest dubbed the \"Let the Valley Shake\" Game is notable for LSU fans chanting LSU-LSU after a Georgia touchdown.[72] Georgia head coach Mark Richt was quoted as saying, \"Usually when the opposing team does well, the crowd quiets down.[72] All I began to hear was a chant, 'L-S-U, L-S-U.'[72] It got louder and louder and louder. It was the loudest I've ever heard a stadium.\"[72] The win catapulted LSU onto the national scene. LSU won its second title and became the BCS national champion by defeating Oklahoma 21–14 in the 2004 Sugar Bowl (BCS National Championship Game). The following season saw the Tigers post a 9–3 record, ending the year with a No. 16 ranking after a loss in the 2005 Capital One Bowl on a final play touchdown pass. Prior to the game, Saban announced that he would be leaving LSU to become the head coach for the Miami Dolphins.[73] On January 4, 2005, Oklahoma State head coach Les Miles was named the new LSU head coach.[74] In Miles's first season in 2005 at LSU was moved to Arizona State's Sun Devil Stadium due to the effects of Hurricane Katrina. With one endzone painted with \"www.KatrinaSRF.com\" and the other with \"Together We Stand\" along with logos of the states of Louisiana and Arizona, LSU rallied in the fourth quarter for a 35–31 comeback victory. Trailing 17–7 in the fourth quarter, LSU returned a blocked field goal and punt for touchdowns to ignite the comeback. The lead went back-and-forth with Arizona State taking a 31–28 lead with 4:07 to play. Quarterback JaMarcus Russell then lead the Tigers on a 10-play, 91-yard drive capped with a 39-yard touchdown pass to Early Doucet on fourth-and-10 to give LSU a 35–31 lead. LSU's defense then stopped Arizona State on downs at the LSU 30-yard line to secure the victory. In 2006, Russell completed a touchdown pass to WR Early Doucet with 9 seconds to go to beat Tennessee in Neyland Stadium after a breakout performance by Tennessee backup QB Jonathan Crompton. No. 2 LSU played what was hyped as one of the most exciting games ever played in Tiger Stadium against No. 9 Florida in 2007. The game is also known for the LSU students leaving thousands of messages on the phone of Florida quarterback, Tim Tebow, prompting him to give a \"telephone\" hand gesture to the LSU student section following an early touchdown. Florida began the fourth quarter with a 24–14 lead, but behind solid defense and being a perfect 5 for 5 on fourth down conversions, the Tigers were able to take the lead 28–24 with 1:06 left in the game after a Jacob Hester touchdown to defeat the Gators. It was LSU's first national primetime game on CBS since 1981 and the game has been dubbed, \"Primetime Drama.\" LSU went on to defeat No. 1 Ohio State in the BCS national championship 38–24, becoming the first school to win two BCS national championship titles and improving their BCS record to 4–0, the best of any team. They also became the first two loss team to ever play in the BCS national championship. In the 5th game of the 2010 season, undefeated No. 12 LSU trailed the Volunteers 14–10 with 0:04 left on the clock and the ball spotted on Tennessee's 2-yard line. On 3rd and goal, after a failed quarterback sneak attempt and with time disappearing off the clock, LSU attempted to send in several players for a substitution package. Seeing that the time was about to expire, center T-Bob Hebert snapped the ball before quarterback Jordan Jefferson was ready, the ball was fumbled, Jefferson was tackled, and the clock expired. On further review, Tennessee was penalized half the distance to the goalline for illegal participation. Amid the confusion in the waning seconds, Tennessee coaches sent 4 players onto the field when they saw LSU make a substitution. Only two players then left the field, leaving the Volunteers with 13 players lined up on defense. Due to the penalty, LSU got the ball back for a single untimed play on the 1-yard line. With the last play, running back Stevan Ridley received the toss sweep, charging forward, only to be hit near the line of scrimmage, but continued to drive forward through two Tennessee defenders and into the endzone for the game-winning score. The ninth regulation game of the 2011 season for LSU found the No. 1 nationally ranked Tigers against the No. 2 Alabama Crimson Tide in a match called the \"Game of the Century\"[75] or the \"Matchup of the Year\".[76] Both teams were undefeated and both were also coming off a bye week; viewed as important to the BCS Championship game as the \"inside track\" by many of the sportswriters, the press built up the game in a Super Bowl-style atmosphere. Ultimately, the game came down to field position and a series of field goals as the top-ranked defense of both teams prevented any touchdowns. Alabama missed three field goals and a fourth was blocked during regulation, leading to a 6–6 tie heading into overtime. On the first possession of overtime, Alabama again missed a field goal from 52 yards out, only to watch LSU earn the win on the next possession with a chip-shot field goal. As a result, it was the second-lowest scoring matchup between No. 1 and No. 2 teams in the history of the NCAA, with a 9–6 decision.[77] For the first time in BCS National Championship history, two SEC teams, the No. 1 LSU Tigers and the No. 2 Alabama Crimson Tide, again faced each other in the National Championship Game. Alabama won the game, 21–0. The SEC-only title game added impetus to the push for a national playoff system and hastened the death of the BCS system as implemented up to that time.[78] Having lost three straight games after a 7–0 start into the season, rumors were floating that LSU would buy-out Miles' contract after the 2015 season.[79] However, Miles was retained for the 2016 season.[80] On September 25, 2016, LSU fired Miles and offensive coordinator Cam Cameron after an 18–13 loss to Auburn the previous day and a 2–2 start to begin the season.[81] After the firing of Les Miles, defensive line coach Ed Orgeron became LSU's interim head coach.[82] Orgeron stated that he was going to \"flip the script\". He promoted tight ends coach Steve Ensminger to offensive coordinator and brought back Pete Jenkins to take over as defensive line coach. Orgeron also decided to shorten practices and spend more time in the film room in order to keep players fresh. In addition, he brought the \"theme of daily practices\" he modeled from coach Pete Carroll during Orgeron's first stint as an assistant at USC. These practice days have descriptive nicknames like Tell the Truth Monday, Competition Tuesday, Turnover Wednesday, No Repeat Thursday, and Focus Friday. Under Orgeron's watch, LSU finished out the season with a 6–2 record. Later in 2016, he was hired as the full-time head coach.[83] The beginning of the 2017 season saw Orgeron hire Matt Canada to be the offensive coordinator. Canada was known for an offensive playbook that was heavily based on setting skilled positions in motion prior to the snap, thus using jet sweeps often. The season began with LSU ranked in the top 15, but early losses to Mississippi State and Troy quickly found LSU unranked. However, the team went 7–2 in their remaining games, finishing the year with a 9–4 record. The 2018 season began with a season opening upset of 8th-ranked Miami, followed by another upset of 7th-ranked Auburn. These victories helped LSU rise to 5th in the CFP rankings, but a loss to 25th-ranked Florida sent LSU tumbling back to 13th. In response, the Tigers pulled off a shocking upset of No. 2 Georgia.[84] The Tigers then avenged the previous year's loss to Mississippi State. The victories over Georgia and Mississippi State propelled LSU to being ranked No. 3 by the CFP going into a game against top-ranked Alabama. The LSU offense that had seemed to turn around after Steve Ensminger took over the duties of offensive coordinator was unable to score against Alabama's defense. After the loss to Alabama, LSU was able to defeat Arkansas and Rice before falling to Texas A&M in a 7-overtime game. With a 9–3 record, LSU was invited to the Fiesta Bowl to play the University of Central Florida, who had not lost a game in the previous two seasons. On New Years Day 2019, LSU gave UCF their first loss since 2016. LSU finished the 2018 season with a record of 10–3 and were ranked sixth in the nation by the AP poll and seventh by the Coaches poll. LSU was not predicted to have a good season in 2018, and some, including SEC commentator Paul Finebaum, believed it would be Orgeron's last until he had a turnaround season. After opening the season with a home win versus Georgia Southern, Orgeron's 2019 team recorded a statement road win over Texas in week two. The key play of the game was a third down pass needing seventeen yards for a first down late in the fourth quarter.[85][86] The Joe Burrow to Justin Jefferson pass resulted in a 61-yard touchdown sealing the victory.[87] That play led to the game being labeled the \"3rd-and-17\" Game.[85][88] This game propelled the team to an undefeated regular season, including a 46–41 victory over Alabama in the 2019 version of the \"Game of the Century\" at Bryant-Denny Stadium in Tuscaloosa. A win over Arkansas in the penultimate game of the regular season clinched the SEC West division title and secured a berth in the 2019 SEC Championship Game against Georgia. This was their first appearance in the SEC Championship Game since 2011. The traditionally defensive-minded Tigers averaged over 48 points per game, led by quarterback Joe Burrow, Baton Rouge-native running back Clyde Edwards-Helaire, and star receivers Ja'Marr Chase and Justin Jefferson. Burrow set new LSU and SEC single-season records for passing yards with 4,366; his 44 touchdown passes set a new LSU record and tied the SEC mark. Orgeron's Tigers defeated the Georgia Bulldogs in the SEC Championship Game to win their first SEC title since 2011. On Sunday, December 8, 2019, they were named the No. 1 seed in the College Football Playoff. They met the Big 12 Conference champion Oklahoma Sooners in the semifinals in the Peach Bowl, defeating them by a score of 63–28. Following the regular season, Orgeron was named the winner of the 2019 AP College Football Coach of the Year Award and Home Depot Coach of the Year Award. Joe Burrow won the 2019 Heisman Trophy.[89] On January 13, 2020, Orgeron won his first national championship as a head coach with a win over the unbeaten defending national champion Clemson Tigers, 42–25, finishing the season 15–0.[90] Orgeron and the LSU Tigers won the national title in their home state at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans. LSU's 2020 season was shortened in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. They played a ten-game, all-SEC schedule. LSU started the season ranked No. 6 in the AP Poll, but dropped out of the rankings after three games and finished the season with a record of 5–5. The Tigers had three different starting quarterbacks throughout the course of the season. Myles Brennan started the first three games, but was injured during the game against Missouri on October 10 and was lost for the season. T. J. Finley started the next five games. Max Johnson started the final two games of the season. He led the Tigers to an upset win over the No. 6 Florida Gators in Gainesville and a shootout win over Ole Miss in the season finale. In March 2021, a woman testifying in front of Louisiana state legislators claimed that she had reported an instance of sexual harassment by LSU running back Derrius Guice to Orgeron, but that the coach had taken no action against him, and in fact called the woman and asked her to forgive Guice. Despite high expectations and a favorable schedule, LSU stumbled to a 3–3 start in 2021, losing several games in which they were favored. Following the tumultuous start, Orgeron's Tigers were able to upend the No. 20-ranked Florida Gators in a thrilling rivalry game matchup. Despite the victory, LSU administrators announced the following day, on October 17, 2021, that they had reached a mutual agreement for Orgeron to leave the program at the end of the 2021 season.[91][92] Orgeron's last game was a last-second victory against Texas A&M at home, which allowed the Tigers to finish the season at 6–6 and become bowl eligible. Despite this, Orgeron announced shortly after the game that he would not coach in the bowl game, and that offensive line coach Brad Davis would be named interim head coach. On November 30, 2021, Notre Dame head coach Brian Kelly was named the 34th head coach at LSU, replacing Ed Orgeron.[93] Kelly cited \"wanting to be with the best\" and \"the commitment to excellence, rich traditions, and unrivaled pride and passion of LSU Football\" for the move.[94] His signed contract also more than triples his previous salary, from his 2021 salary of $2.67 million to $9 million in 2022 with the total deal being worth $95 million over ten years excluding incentives. His season started with a 24–23 loss to Florida State in the Allstate Louisiana Kickoff at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans. Florida State had a 24–10 lead, but LSU slowly chipped away at the Seminoles' lead and scored a last-second touchdown to make the game 24–23. The Tigers opted to kick the extra point to force overtime, but Florida State was able to successfully block the kick, and thus sealed the victory.[95] Moving forward, the Tigers would win 4 straight against Southern, Mississippi State, New Mexico, and Auburn before eventually losing to Tennessee by a score of 13–40. The Tigers would then go on to beat Florida, upset #7 ranked Ole Miss, upset #6 ranked Alabama 32–31, beat unranked Arkansas 13–10, clinching the SEC West and earning a spot in the 2022 SEC Championship against #1 ranked Georgia. They would go on to win against UAB 41-10 but lose to Texas A&M 23–38. LSU has been independent and affiliated with three conferences.[96]: 181–196 [inconsistent] LSU claims four national championships (1958, 2003, 2007, and 2019)[97] and have been selected national champions in four additional seasons (1908, 1936, 1962, 2011) by NCAA-designated major selectors.[98] They are additionally recorded as being the Williamson System co-champions for 1935, an apparent error in the NCAA records book.[98][99] In 1958 they finished as the only undefeated team with a victory over Clemson in the Sugar Bowl, and were named the national champions by both major polls (AP and Coaches). In 2003, 2007, and 2019 LSU claimed the national championship after winning a postseason bowl national championship game. Claimed national championships: 1958 national championshipThe 1958 LSU Tigers football team under head coach Paul Dietzel, cruised to an undefeated season capped by a win over Clemson in the 1959 Sugar Bowl. LSU was named the national champion in both the AP Poll and the Coaches' Poll prior to their 7-0 Sugar Bowl victory over Clemson. LSU's shutout victory over #12 Clemson was convincing and highlighted LSU as the only team in the country to go undefeated. Army, Auburn, and Air Force did not lose all season but they each had one game that ended in a tie. It was the first recognized national championship for LSU in the poll era. With a 10–0 regular season record, LSU was crowned national champion by the Associated Press and the Coaches' Poll (UPI), as well as by 37 other selectors. LSU's total first place votes was 130 to win the 1958 National Championship in the AP poll. LSU received 29 of the 35 first-place votes to win the #1 ranking in the Coaches poll. LSU earned the #1 rankings in the AP and Coaches poll during week 6 and held on to the #1 rankings for the rest of the year to win the 1958 National Championship in both major polls. [100] 2003 national championshipThe 2003 LSU Tigers football team was coached by Nick Saban. LSU won the BCS National Championship, the first national championship for LSU since 1958. The Tigers battled for an 11–1 regular season record and then defeated Georgia in the SEC Championship Game. The LSU Tigers faced off against Oklahoma for the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) national title. LSU beat Oklahoma 21–14 in the 2004 Sugar Bowl designated as the BCS National Championship Game. 2007 national championshipThe 2007 LSU Tigers football team, coached by Les Miles, won the Southeastern Conference championship and the national championship with a 12–2 record. The LSU Tigers took on the top ranked Ohio State Buckeyes in the 2008 BCS National Championship Game defeating them 38–24. This win made the LSU Tigers the first team to win two BCS National Championships in its history. On their way to the BCS championship, the Tigers won their tenth Southeastern Conference championship by defeating Tennessee in the 2007 SEC Championship Game. LSU became the first program to win multiple BCS National Championship Games and the second program to win a national championship with multiple losses. 2019 national championshipThe 2019 LSU Tigers football team, coached by Ed Orgeron, won the Southeastern Conference championship and the national championship with a 15–0 record. The LSU Tigers defeated the Clemson Tigers in the 2020 College Football Playoff National Championship defeating them 42–25. On their way to the College Football Playoff National Championship, the Tigers won their twelfth Southeastern Conference championship by defeating Georgia in the 2019 SEC Championship Game. LSU has won a total of 16 conference championships in three different conferences.[101]: 107 Since becoming a founding member of the Southeastern Conference (SEC) in 1933, LSU has won 12 SEC championships. ‡ LSU claims a co-championship,[101]: 107 while Clemson claims a sole championship.[102] Since the SEC began divisional play in 1992, LSU has won or shared the SEC West title 10 times, and is 5–2 in the SEC Championship game.[101]: 119–121 Helmets Pre-1946, LSU wore leather helmets. From 1947 through 1955, LSU wore an old gold helmet. In 1956, head coach Paul Dietzel changed the color of the helmet to a yellow-gold similar to that of the Green Bay Packers. It featured a white one-inch center stripe with purple three-quarter inch flanking stripes. From 1957 through 1971, LSU added jersey numbers to the sides of the helmet. In 1972, the first logo was introduced, a tiger head inside a purple circle with LSU written underneath the tiger head. In 1977, LSU introduced its current helmet. The logo features curved LSU lettering written above the Tiger head logo. Purple face masks were introduced in 1980. In 2014, LSU introduced a new Tiger head logo. Special helmets Jerseys The current style of jerseys were introduced by coach Paul Dietzel in 1957 with \"TV\" numerals on the shoulders. Those numbers were moved to the sleeves in 1959. LSU's white jerseys have purple numbers on the front, back and sleeves with a gold center stripe flanked by two purple stripes encircling the shoulders. LSU's purple jerseys have white numbers on the front, back and sleeves with a white center stripe flanked by two yellow stripes encircling the shoulders. Names were added to the backs of jerseys in 1972. LSU has worn gold jerseys four times recently: vs. Vanderbilt in 1996, vs. Notre Dame in the 1997 Independence Bowl, at Florida in 1998 and throwbacks vs. Mississippi State in 2016. LSU also wore gold jerseys as their primary jerseys during the 1940s. Save for the throwback jerseys, LSU wore gold due to the intense dislike of purple exhibited by then-LSU coach Gerry DiNardo. DiNardo's successor, Nick Saban, resurrected purple jerseys for the second game of the 2000 season vs. Houston. Since the wearing of white jerseys has become a tradition for LSU football, the white jerseys are typically worn for both home and away games.[105] The exception is for non-SEC home games, other than the home opener, where LSU wears purple jerseys. Also, though rare, in the case of away games the home teams may choose to wear white, and if so, purple is the default for LSU; this occurred in the 2004 season opener vs. Oregon State, which did not want to wear its black jerseys in the intense Louisiana heat. In 2015, South Carolina was forced to move its scheduled home game vs. LSU to Baton Rouge due to severe flooding in Columbia, South Carolina. Prior to the site change, the Gamecocks declared they would wear white jerseys at Williams-Brice Stadium, so the Tigers wore purple jerseys for the first time for an SEC game in Tiger Stadium (South Carolina was the designated home team) since 1994 vs. Alabama. In 2019, LSU was asked by the Southeastern Conference to wear purple jerseys for its away game vs. Vanderbilt to provide sufficient contrast to the Commodores' gray jerseys. From 1983 through 1994, LSU was mandated to wear purple jerseys at home, due to an NCAA rule which required the visiting team to wear white jerseys (LSU wore white jerseys as the designated home team for the 1987 Sugar Bowl vs. Nebraska and 1987 Gator Bowl vs. South Carolina). In 1995, the NCAA changed the rule to allow the home team to wear white if it obtained prior approval of the visiting team. In 1997, the Southeastern Conference ruled the home team would have choice of jersey color without consent of the visitors for conference games. Pants The team traditionally wears one style of pants, which are gold with white and purple trim. For a 1995 game at Kentucky, the Tigers wore purple pants, which had no stripes and a tiger head logo on the left thigh. LSU lost to the Wildcats 24–16 and the pants were never worn again.[106] LSU has worn white pants on 16 occasions since 1996: 5-yard lines – Tiger Stadium is notable for putting all 5-yard line numbers on the field, not just those that are multiples of 10. However, the 10-yard line numbers are the only numbers that get directional arrows, as the rules make no provision for 5-yard line numbers.[107] H-style goal posts – LSU's Tiger Stadium sports \"H\" style goal posts, as opposed to the more modern \"Y\" style used by most other schools today. This \"H\" style allows the team to run through the goal post in the north end zone when entering the field.[107] The crossbar from the goalposts which stood in the north end zone of Tiger Stadium from 1955 through 1984 is now mounted above the door which leads from LSU's locker room onto the playing field. The crossbar is painted with the word \"WIN!\", and superstition dictates every player entering the field touch the bar on his way out the door. Night games in Tiger Stadium – The tradition of playing night games in Tiger Stadium began on October 3, 1931, when LSU defeated Spring Hill 35–0. Several reasons were cited for playing at night such as avoiding the heat and humidity of afternoon games, avoiding scheduling conflicts with Tulane and Loyola football and giving more fans the opportunity to see the Tigers play. Attendance increased and night football became an LSU tradition. LSU has also traditionally played better during night games based on winning percentage.[108] Pregame show – Louisiana State University Tiger Marching Band \"pregame show\" was created in 1964, and revised over the next nine years into its current format. The marching band lines up along the end zone shortly before kick off. Then the band strikes up a drum cadence and begins to spread out evenly across the field. When the front of the band reaches the center of the field, the band stops and begins to play an arrangement of \"Pregame\" (Hold That Tiger). While it does this, the band turns to salute the fans in all four corners of the stadium. Then the band, resuming its march across the field, begins playing \"Touchdown for LSU\". Tailgating – For home football games, thousands of LSU fans gather on the Baton Rouge campus. They set up motor homes and tents as early as Thursday before Saturday football games.[109] Tailgating is found across the entire campus with many fans tailgating in the same spot year after year. LSU has been consistently ranked as the top tailgating location in the country. ESPN.com ranked LSU as the top tailgating destination in America.[citation needed] The Sporting News proclaimed \"Saturday Night in Death Valley\" and Tiger tailgating as the top tradition in college football.[110] Sports Illustrated said, \"When It Comes To Great Tailgating, Nothing Compares To LSU.\"[111] LSU's tailgating was named No. 1 in an Associated Press poll on top tailgating spots and by a CNN network survey on top tailgating locations.[112] Victory Gold – In 2012, a new tradition was established at Tiger Stadium. Following an LSU football victory, the lights that illuminate the upper arches on the north end of the stadium light up in LSU \"Victory Gold\".[113] Victory Hill – The LSU football players, coaches, cheerleaders and Mike the Tiger in his cage, \"Walk Down Victory Hill\" on North Stadium Drive prior to each home game on their way to Tiger Stadium.[107] Thousands of fans line both sides of the road to watch and cheer for the Tigers football team. The practice was started under head coach Gerry Dinardo and it endures today. The LSU Tiger Marching Band or The Golden Band from Tigerland, Golden Girls and Colorguard, \"March Down Victory Hill\" about an hour prior to each home game. Fans line both sides of the road and listen for the cadence of drums announcing the band's departure from the Greek Theatre and await the arrival of the band.[114] The band stops on top of Victory Hill and begins to play their drum cadence while beginning to march down Victory Hill. The band then stops on Victory Hill and begins to play the opening strains of the \"Pregame Salute.\" Then, while playing the introduction to \"Touchdown for LSU,\" the band begins to run in tempo through the streets and down the hill amidst the crowd of cheering fans. From there, the band enters the PMAC and plays a pep rally for TAF members. White jerseys – LSU is notable as one of the few college football teams that wears white jerseys for home games as opposed to their darker jerseys (in their case, purple). Most other NCAA football teams wear their darker jerseys in home games, even though football is one of the few college sports that do not require a specific jersey type for each respective team (for instance, college basketball requires home teams to wear white or light-colored jerseys while the away team wears their darker jerseys), and is similar to the National Football League in letting the home team decide what to wear. The tradition started in 1958, when Coach Paul Dietzel decided that LSU would wear white jerseys for home games. Another story is the tradition first started when Dietzel had LSU wear white at home for good luck against a ranked Georgia Tech team in 1957 because Georgia Tech's team had long been known for wearing white at home. LSU won the game and he continued that tradition for the 1958 season and LSU went on to win the national championship that year. Since the 1958 championship season, LSU continued to wear white jerseys at home games through the 18-year tenure of Charles McClendon. Then in 1983, new NCAA rules prohibited teams from wearing white jerseys at home. Because of this, LSU wore purple jerseys during home games from 1983 to 1994. The team's fans believed wearing purple jerseys were \"bad luck\" and often complained about being forced to wear purple jerseys at home.[115] In 1995, LSU's new coach, Gerry DiNardo, was determined to restore LSU's tradition of white home jerseys. DiNardo personally met with each member of the NCAA Football Rules Committee, lobbying LSU's case. DiNardo was successful, and LSU again began wearing white jerseys at home when the 1995 season began. In LSU's first home game with the white jerseys, unranked LSU prevailed in a 12–6 upset victory over No. 6 Auburn.[116] The 1995 rule allowing LSU to wear white at home had one stipulation: the visiting team must agree for conference and non-conference games. In 1997, the SEC amended its rule to allow the home team its choice of jersey color for conference games without prior approval of the visiting team. Therefore, only for non-conference home games does the home team seek permission to wear white jerseys at home. In 2009, the NCAA further relaxed the previous rule that required most away teams to wear white. The rule now states that teams must simply wear contrasting colors.[117] After the 1995 rule change, on three occasions LSU was forced to wear colored jerseys at Tiger Stadium. The first time was in 1996 against Vanderbilt, who was still angry at LSU for hiring Gerry DiNardo, who left Vanderbilt to become LSU's head coach after the 1994 season. LSU wore gold jerseys for that game (a 35–0 LSU victory), and fans were encouraged to wear white in an effort to \"white out\" the Commodores. The other was in 2004 when Oregon State did not want to suffer in its black jerseys due to the humid weather of Louisiana in late summer, thus forcing LSU to wear its purple jerseys for a nationally televised game on ESPN. On October 10, 2015, LSU was scheduled to play a road conference game at South Carolina, but due to massive flooding in the state of South Carolina, the game was relocated from Columbia to Baton Rouge. Despite the game being played at Tiger Stadium, South Carolina was still the designated home team and had first choice of jersey selection. South Carolina chose to wear white as they had originally planned, forcing LSU to wear their purple jerseys at Tiger Stadium for an SEC game for the first time since 1994.[118] After the 1995 rule change, LSU was forced to wear colored jerseys on the road on four occasions. In 1998 and 2000, Florida coach Steve Spurrier exercised this option and forced LSU to don a colored jersey at Gainesville. The Tigers wore gold in 1998 under Gerry DiNardo (lost 22–10) and purple in 2000 under Nick Saban (lost 41–9). In 2007 and 2009, LSU also wore its purple jerseys on the road at Mississippi State, but the Tigers emerged victorious both times (45–0 in 2007 and 30–26 in 2009).[119] Callin' Baton Rouge – The Garth Brooks song \"Callin' Baton Rouge\" is played at each game.[120] Geaux Tigers – A common cheer for all LSU athletics, Geaux Tigers, pronounced \"Go Tigers\", is derived from a common ending in Cajun French names, -eaux. Fans began using this spelling in the 1990s to add local flavor to the standard cheer. The phrase was trademarked by the university in 2005.[121] Hot Boudin – A cheer before and during games about famous food in Louisiana. It goes \"Hot boudin, cold coush-coush, come on tigers, push push push.\"[122] Push is pronounced poosh to rhyme with coush-coush [koosh-koosh]. Coush-coush is a Cajun dish generally served for breakfast.[123] Neck - A rendition of \"Talkin' Out the Side of Your Neck\", a marching band tune commonly performed by HBCU bands.[124] Performances of \"Neck\" have been infamous due to a vulgar chant based on the song's chorus (\"Suck that Tiger dick, bitch\"). In an effort to curb the chant, the tune was banned in 2010, before being allowed sparingly since 2013.[125] During a 2018 game against Georgia, the crowd broke into the chant several times despite \"Neck\" never being played.[126] The tune is reportedly planned to be included in the upcoming video game EA Sports College Football 25.[127] Tiger bait – LSU fans will yell \"Tiger Bait, Tiger Bait\" at visiting fans.[128] Tiger Bandits – Whenever LSU forces a turnover or gets the ball back via a defensive stop, the LSU band plays the Tiger Bandits song and LSU fans bow in respect to the defensive stop. The original title of the song was called \"Chinese Bandits\", but the title was eventually changed to \"Tiger Bandits\" (or just simply \"Bandits\") to make the tradition more inclusive. The term \"Chinese Bandits\" originated as the nickname that LSU Coach Paul Dietzel gave to the defensive unit he organized in 1958, which helped LSU to win its first national championship. The next season, the 1959 Chinese Bandit defense held their opponents to an average of only 143.2 yards per game. No LSU defense since has done better.[96] Jersey No. 18 is an LSU tradition established in 2003 when quarterback Matt Mauck guided LSU to a national championship. After Mauck's final season, he passed jersey No. 18 to running back Jacob Hester, who helped LSU win the 2007 national championship. The jersey became synonymous with success on and off the field as well as having a selfless attitude. Each season, a player is chosen by the coaching staff to wear the No. 18 jersey.[129] In 2017, it was the first year LSU awarded the jersey to two players, one each on offense and defense.[130] Beginning in 2012, LSU had a high number of defensive backs earn recognition for their play, leading to both current and former players to refer to the school as \"Defensive Back University\", or \"DBU\".[142][143] This has led to a sense of pride among LSU defensive backs, who strive to continue the tradition of excellence at the position.[144] Since 2005, 28 LSU defensive backs have been drafted into the NFL, including seven in the first round: LaRon Landry (6th pick in 2007), Patrick Peterson (5th pick in 2011), Morris Claiborne (6th pick in 2012), Eric Reid (18th pick in 2013), Jamal Adams (6th pick in 2017), Tre'Davious White (27th pick in 2017), and Derek Stingley Jr. (3rd pick in 2022).[145] Additionally, since 2013, LSU has also been recognized for their development of wide receivers, leading to the nickname of \"Wide Receiver University\", or \"WRU\". Particularly, LSU has been noted for its history of successful wide receiver duos, with the program having three seasons where two receivers had at least 1,000 yards receiving: 2013 (Jarvis Landry and Odell Beckham Jr.), 2019 (Ja'Marr Chase and Justin Jefferson), and 2023 (Malik Nabers and Brian Thomas Jr.). The duo of Chase and Jefferson were considered instrumental pieces in the team's 2019 national championship run. Since 2014, five LSU receivers have been drafted in the first round of the NFL Draft: Beckham Jr. (12th pick in 2014), Jefferson (22nd pick in 2020), Chase (5th pick in 2021), Nabers (6th pick in 2024), and Thomas Jr. (23rd pick in 2024).[146] LSU and Alabama have played every year since the 1960s. It has been mentioned by the LSU fan base, the origins of the rivalry date back to a 15-game undefeated streak Alabama had in Tiger Stadium, which is generally considered to be one of the most hostile atmospheres in college football. While the Alabama rivalries against Auburn and Tennessee may overshadow their rivalry with LSU, the significance of this annual rivalry increased after Alabama hired former LSU coach Nick Saban in 2007. The LSU-Alabama rivalry continued after the November 5, 2011, game and the 2012 National Championship where the two teams faced off.[147] Alabama leads the series 57-27-5 through the 2024 season.[148] Prior to Arkansas joining LSU in the Southeastern Conference, the two programs met a total of 36 times, including the famed Ice Bowl. The schools played against each other for the first time in 1901 in Baton Rouge, a 15-0 LSU victory. The rivalry grew while it was played annually from 1906 to 1936, with 1918 being the only year the game was not played between those dates. The series was contested in Shreveport from 1913 to 1936. After the Razorbacks left the Southwest Conference in 1990, Arkansas joined the SEC in 1991 and rekindled the rivalry with LSU. During their first year in the SEC, Arkansas would defeat the Tigers in the Razorbacks' first game against LSU in Fayetteville, 30–6; their first victory against LSU since the Razorbacks' 32–0 shutout of the Tigers in 1929. The winner takes home the Golden Boot, a 175-pound, four foot tall, 24-karat gold trophy in the shape of the states of Arkansas and Louisiana that resembles a boot. The game, played the day after Thanksgiving until the 2010 season, was usually the last regular season game for each team and is broadcast on CBS. LSU and Arkansas now close their respective seasons against the SEC's newest members, the Tigers vs. Texas A&M and the Razorbacks vs. Missouri. In 2002, the rivalry gained momentum as the game winner would represent the Western Division of the SEC in the SEC Championship Game. Arkansas won on a last-second touchdown pass by Matt Jones. In 2006, the Razorbacks, who had already clinched the SEC Western Division and were on a 10-game winning streak, were beaten by LSU in Little Rock. In 2007, Arkansas defeated top-ranked LSU in triple overtime, giving them their first win in Baton Rouge since 1993, and again defended the Golden Boot trophy with a last-minute touchdown drive in 2008. Fifteenth-ranked LSU won back the trophy for the first time in two years in 2009 after Razorback kicker Alex Tejada missed a field goal that would have sent the game into a second overtime, and LSU went on to lose the Capitol One Bowl. In 2011, with both teams ranked in the top 3 in the AP Poll, No. 1 LSU prevailed over No. 3 Arkansas by a score of 41–17, sending LSU to the SEC title game en route to being shutout in the 2012 BCS National Championship Game. LSU rode the momentum from the 2011 win by grinding out back-to-back one-possession wins in 2012 and 2013 against Arkansas teams that won four and three games, respectively. Arkansas returned the favor with consecutive 17-point victories in 2014 (breaking a 17-game SEC losing streak for the Hogs while pitching a 17–0 shutout against the No. 17 Tigers; Arkansas's tenth time holding LSU to 0 points and the only shutout in the series since 1995) and 2015 (a 31–14 romp in Baton Rouge which saw the unranked Razorbacks lead the No. 9 Tigers the whole game). LSU lost against Arkansas in overtime in 2021, but rebounded in 2022 to win 13–10 in Fayetteville. LSU leads the series 45*–23–2 through the 2024 season. *2 LSU wins have been vacated.[149] While Auburn's rivalries against Alabama and Georgia may overshadow its rivalry with LSU, in the 2000s, LSU had a heated rivalry with the Auburn Tigers. LSU and Auburn were not yearly rivals until the SEC's 1992 expansion placed both Tiger teams in the Western Division. The two share more than just a nickname, as they have both enjoyed success in the SEC West and plenty of memorable match ups. The home team won every game from 2000 through 2007. LSU leads the series 33-24-1 through the 2024 season, with two LSU wins being vacated.[150] Although both universities were founding members of the Southeastern Conference (SEC) in December 1932, the Florida Gators and Tigers did not meet on the gridiron for the first time until 1937. LSU is Florida's permanent inter-divisional rival. LSU has played Florida every year since 1971. The longest winning streak in the LSU–Florida series is held by Florida, with nine victories from 1988 to 1996. LSU's longest winning streak is four, from 1977 to 1980. The winner of the Florida-LSU game went on to win the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) national championship game from 2006 to 2008. Some of the notable games in this rivalry include the 1960: Wristband Robbery, 1964: Hurricane Delay, 1972: Flooded Swamp, 1989: College Football's First Overtime Game, 1997: LSU's Revenge, 2006: Tebow Domination, 2007: 5 for 5 on fourth down, and 2016: Hurricane Delay Pt 2. Florida handed LSU its most lopsided defeat in program history, a 58–3 rout at Baton Rouge in 1993. With a few exceptions, mostly during Spurrier's coaching tenure when the Gators routinely won by large margins, this rivalry has been known for close games in recent years, with both teams usually coming into the match-up highly ranked. The Gators and Tigers have combined to win five national championships and eleven SEC titles over the past two decades. The series is tied 34–34–3 through the 2024 season, though 3 LSU wins have been vacated.[151] The LSU–Mississippi State rivalry, is an annual football game between the Louisiana State Tigers and Mississippi State Bulldogs. Both universities are founding members of the Southeastern Conference, as well as the Western Division. This rivalry is LSU's longest rivalry with 108 meetings. LSU is second only to Ole Miss (3 games behind) on Mississippi St.’s list of most-commonly played opponents. Mississippi State's 34–29 victory on September 20, 2014, engineered by quarterback Dak Prescott, a Louisiana native, was the Bulldogs' first over LSU since 1999, their first in Baton Rouge since 1991, and just their fourth overall since 1985. State defeated LSU 37-7 in 2017 for their first win in the series at Starkville since 1999. The Tigers lead the series 78-36-3 through the 2024 season, with two LSU wins being vacated.[152] LSU's traditional SEC rival is Ole Miss. Throughout the 50's and 60's, games between the two schools featured highly ranked squads on both sides and seemingly every contest had conference, and at times national, title implications. The Magnolia Bowl Trophy is now awarded to the winner of the LSU-Ole Miss rivalry now known as the \"Magnolia Bowl\". Recently, the second to last regular season game has been between these two colleges. There is still a strong rivalry between both schools. From 1961 through 1988, LSU did not play on the Ole Miss campus in Oxford, Mississippi. Instead, all of the Rebels' home dates in the series were contested at Mississippi Veterans Memorial Stadium in Jackson. LSU and Ole Miss played at Oxford in 1989 for the first time in 29 seasons, then moved the series permanently to Vaught–Hemingway Stadium in 1994 after the 1991 and 1992 contests returned to Jackson. LSU leads the series 66-42-4 through the 2024 season, with two LSU wins being vacated.[153] LSU and Texas A&M began play in 1899. Since then, there have been four distinct eras; 1899 to 1923, 1942 to 1975, 1986 to 1995, and the current SEC era beginning in 2011. A&M took that first matchup over LSU, 52–0. The Aggies claimed the 1899 to 1923 era with 7 wins to LSU's 3, with two tie games. LSU took the 1942 to 1975 era winning 19 to A&M's 7, with one tie game. The 1986 to 1995 era belonged again to A&M, with the Aggies winning 6 games to LSU's 4. The current era began with A&M entering the SEC in 2011. LSU claimed victory 8 times in the first 10 meetings. In 2018, the Tigers lost at Kyle Field 74–72 in a game with 7 overtimes, the most overtimes in one game in FBS history. During the series, the two teams have meet in two bowl games. LSU won in the 1944 Orange Bowl 19–14 and prevailed 41–24 in the 2011 Cotton Bowl Classic. LSU leads the series 36–24–3 through the 2024 season, with four Tigers wins being vacated.[154] LSU's oldest rival is Tulane; the first LSU-Tulane football game was played in 1893 and for the first 50 or so years of Tiger football, no team was more hated by LSU fans than the Green Wave. The series, in which they battle for the Tiger Rag, was played continuously from 1919 to 1994.[155] The intrastate rivalry featured two teams which were geographically close (Baton Rouge and New Orleans are roughly 80 miles (130 km) apart) and drew on socio-political tensions between the state's capital and seat of government and its biggest and most culturally important city. As opponents in the SIAA, Southern Conference and SEC, the Tulane rivalry flourished for many years but slowly declined after Tulane left the SEC and de-emphasized athletics. Until 1949, the series was very competitive, with LSU leading 23–18–5; since 1949, LSU has dominated, going 45–4–2. The two teams renewed the annual series in 2006 and ended it again after the 2009 meeting with LSU leading 69–23–7.[156] Through the 2020 season[101]: 106 [157][failed verification] The LSU Tigers football team finished in the Top 25 in the first College Football Playoff ranking. The Tigers finished No. 1 in the final ranking in 2019. The LSU Tigers football team has been ranked No. 1 in the Pre-season Associated Press Poll (AP Poll) in 1959 and the Pre-season Coaches' Poll in 2012. The LSU Tigers football team finished the season ranked No. 1 in the Final Associated Press Poll (AP Poll) in 1958, 2007, and 2019. The Tigers were ranked No. 1 in the Final Coaches' Poll in 1958, 2003, 2007, and 2019.[158] The Tigers also finished No. 2 in the Final AP Poll in 1936, 2003, and 2011 and the Final Coaches Poll in 2011. LSU has played in 52 bowl games, compiling a record of 28–23–1.[159] The Tigers have played in 20 straight bowl games since 2000, the fourth longest active streak in the NCAA and second longest in the Southeastern Conference.[160] LSU players have been selected as consensus All-Americans on 40 occasions through the 2023 season, with 13 selections being unanimous.[1][2] † Unanimous selection Starting in 1994, the Southeastern Conference has annually honored one former football player from each of the member schools as an \"SEC Legend\". The LSU Tigers football team has had 381 players drafted into the National Football League (NFL).[176] This includes 39 players taken in the first round and three overall number one picks: Billy Cannon in the 1960 NFL draft and 1960 AFL draft, Jamarcus Russell in the 2007 NFL draft and Joe Burrow in the 2020 NFL draft.[177] Six former LSU football players have been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.[178] One former LSU player is a member of the Canadian Football Hall of Fame.[179] LSU has had eleven players and five head coaches inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. Tiger Stadium is the 102,321 capacity home of the LSU Tigers football team. The stadium is the sixth largest on-campus stadium in the NCAA and the ninth largest stadium in the world. The current record attendance of 102,321 was set on September 20, 2014, when LSU played host to Mississippi State. Tiger Stadium contains 70 skyboxes, called \"Tiger Den\" suites and a 3,200 seat club level named \"The Stadium Club\". The Paul Manasseh Press Box is located in the west upper-deck. On April 27, 2012, the LSU Board of Supervisors voted unanimously in favor of an $80 million south end-zone upper deck expansion that added approximately 60 \"Tiger Den\" suites, 3,000 club seats and 1,500 general public seats to bring the total capacity of Tiger Stadium to 102,321, making it the 6th-largest college football stadium in the country. Tiger Stadium first opened its gates in the fall of 1924 with a seating capacity of 12,000. In the season finale, LSU hosted Tulane in the first game. As of the 2021 season, LSU has gone on to post a 439-154-18 (.733) mark in Tiger Stadium. Moreover, Tiger Stadium is also known for night games, an idea that was first introduced in 1931 against Spring Hill (a 35-0 LSU victory). In 2006, LSU celebrated its 75th year of playing night football in Tiger Stadium. LSU has played the majority of its games at night, and the Tigers have fared better under the lights than during the day. From 1960 to 2022, LSU is 237–68–4 (.773) at night in Tiger Stadium compared to a 26–27–3 (.491) record during the day over that span.[113] 445-155-18 (.733) State Field was the former home stadium of the LSU Tigers football team from 1893 to 1923. The field was located on the old downtown Baton Rouge campus of LSU. The Charles McClendon Practice Facility is the name of the LSU Tigers football practice facility. The facility features the LSU Football Operations Center, the Tigers Indoor Practice Facility and four outdoor 100-yard football practice fields.[158] In 2002, it was named after former LSU head coach and College Football Hall of Fame member, Charles McClendon.[180] The LSU Football Operations Center, built in 2006, is an all-in-one facility[181] that includes the Tigers locker room, players' lounge, Peterson-Roberts weight room, training room, equipment room, video operations center and coaches offices.[182][183][184] The operations center atrium holds team displays and graphics, trophy cases and memorabilia of LSU football.[185][186] The LSU Indoor Practice Facility, built in 1991, is a climate-controlled 82,500 square feet facility connected to the Football Operations Center. It holds the 100-yd Anderson-Feazel LSU indoor field with Momentum Field Turf by SportExe. The indoor practice facility is located behind the football operations center.[158] The four outdoor practice fields are directly adjacent to the football operations center and indoor practice facility. Three of the fields are natural grass, while the fourth, The Scott & Espe Moran Outdoor Turf Field has a Momentum Field Turf by SportExe playing surface.[158] LSU has had 32 head coaches since organized football began in 1893. In that time, 12 coaches have led the Tigers in postseason bowl games: Bernie Moore, Gus Tinsley, Paul Dietzel, Charles McClendon, Jerry Stovall, Bill Arnsparger, Mike Archer, Gerry DiNardo, Nick Saban, Les Miles, Ed Orgeron, and Brian Kelly. Six of those coaches also won conference championships after LSU left the Southern Conference to join the SEC: Moore, Dietzel, McClendon, Arnsparger, Archer, Saban, Miles, and Orgeron won a combined 12 as a member of the SEC. During their tenures, Dietzel, Saban, Miles, and most recently Orgeron, each won national championships awarded by major selectors while with the Tigers. Of the 32 different head coaches who have led the Tigers, Dana X. Bible, Michael Donahue, Lawrence \"Biff\" Jones, Moore and McClendon have been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame.[187] Since 2002, LSU has been ranked in the Top 25 in recruiting ranking by multiple ranking services.[189] From 1992 to 2023, LSU played in the West Division of the SEC and played each opponent in the division each year along with several teams from the East Division. The SEC will expand the conference to 16 teams and will eliminate its two divisions in 2024, causing a new scheduling format for the Tigers to play against the other members of the conference.[190] Only the 2024 conference schedule was announced on June 14, 2023, while the conference still considers a new format for the future.[191] LSU will not play Auburn for the first time since 1991, the year before the SEC expanded from 10 teams to 12, and will not play Mississippi State for the first time since 1943, when State did not field a team during World War II.

                "content": "NWS All NOAA Safety National Program Lake effect snow is common across the Great Lakes region during the late fall and winter. Lake Effect snow occurs when cold air, often originating from Canada, moves across the open waters of the Great Lakes. As the cold air passes over the unfrozen and relatively warm waters of the Great Lakes, warmth and moisture are transferred into the lowest portion of the atmosphere. The air rises, clouds form and grow into narrow band that produces 2 to 3 inches of snow per hour or more. Wind direction is a key component in determining which areas will receive lake effect snow. Heavy snow may be falling in one location, while the sun may be shining just a mile or two away in either direction. The physical geography of the land and water is also important. National Weather Service meteorologists consider these factors as well as others when forecasting lake effect snow.

                "content": "Three states are bracing for lake-effect snow starting on Wednesday and extending until Sunday in some regions, the National Weather Service (NWS) warns. Newsweek has contacted the NWS via email for additional comment. With 2 to 3 feet possible, portions of Ohio, Pennsylvania and New York state are under the lake-effect snow warning for the first days of the new year as the holiday travel period ends. The NWS says \"heavy\" lake-effect snow is projected to bring up to 20 inches of snow in areas of upstate New York by Thursday. Additional bands of the lake-effect snow could bring the total to 3 feet. Following are the snow projections for the three states: Ohio: Geauga County is projected to get 8 to 14 inches of snow by Thursday night, the NWS says. Ashtabula Inland County, Lake County and eastern portions of Cuyahoga County are expected to get anywhere from 6 to 10 inches by Thursday night. Western Cuyahoga County may see 2 to 5 inches of snow, the NWS says. New York: Both Herkimer and Hamilton counties could see 6 inches to a foot of snow by Saturday. Northern portions of Cayuga County and Oswego, Jefferson and Lewis counties may see 2 to 3 feet of snow by Sunday evening, the NWS says. Southern Erie County and Wyoming, Chautauqua and Cattaraugus counties may see 1 to 2 feet of snow by Sunday evening. Madison, northern Oneida and Onondaga counties may see over 2 feet of snow by Sunday, according to the NWS. In southern portions of Cayuga County, 6 inches to a foot of snow is possible. Pennsylvania: Warren County is expected to get 4 to 10 inches by Sunday, according to the NWS. Crawford County and northern and southern Erie Country may see 8 to 20 inches of snow by Thursday, with up to 3 feet by Sunday, the NWS says. NWS Albany posted about the expected lake-effect snow on X (formerly Twitter), saying: \"We are expecting rain tonight for lower elevations, but high terrain areas will see more in the way of snow. Then, lake effect snow is expected across the western ADKs and western Mohawk Valley through Sunday, where several inches to over a foot of snow will be possible.\" NWS Cleveland also posted about the snow on X saying: \"Another round of wet weather is arriving today. Rain changes to snow tonight with a bit of light, slushy accumulation possible. Lake effect snow kicks in starting Wednesday, with Lake Effect Snow Warnings & Winter Storm Watches in effect for the 'primary snowbelt.'\" The lake-effect snow warnings for the three states will expire by Sunday night, the NWS says.

                "content": "Manage your account The National Weather Service office in Cleveland has issued a lake-effect snow warning for Erie starting at 7 a.m. on Wednesday and continuing until 7 p.m. on Sunday. Heavy lake-effect snow is expected, accumulating 2 feet to 3 feet, and winds could reach as high as 40 mph. Southern and eastern Erie County and northern Crawford County are likely to receive the greatest snow accumulations. Expect roads to become slick and hazardous, making travel conditions hazardous.

The National Weather Service in Binghamton has issues a lake effect snow warning for much of the region starting at 1 p.m. Wednesday, Jan. 1, and lasting until 4 p.m. on Sunday, Jan. 5. Some parts of the region could see up to three feet of snow to go along with wind gusts of up to 45 mph. How quickly things can change when it comes to the weather in Central New York. While conditions were downright balmy on Tuesday, Dec. 31, with sunny skies and temperatures hovering in the upper 40s, the National Weather Service in Binghamton is warning that the new year is shaping up to arrive with a wallop of lake effect snow — which was expected to start at 1 p.m. Wednesday and linger through Sunday afternoon. Initially, meteorologists said, the region will see widespread moderate snow which could be heavy at times before it transitions to lake effect snow that will fall in relatively narrow bands. “Total snow accumulations over two feet will be possible in portions northern Oneida, Onondaga and Madison County,” the National Weather Service said in an advisory on Tuesday afternoon. “Localized snow accumulations of six to 12 inches will be possible,” elsewhere in the region, including southern Oneida County with wind gusts “as high as 45 mph.” To the north, portions of Lewis and Herkimer counties, including the Tug Hill Plateau, could see up to three feet of snow before the storm is expected to end around 6 p.m. on Sunday. Across the region “travel could be very difficult to impossible,” the National Weather Service added. “The hazardous conditions could impact the Wednesday evening and Thursday morning commutes” and gusty winds could bring down tree branches. In addition, the National Weather Service offers the following precautionary/preparedness actions: Log In Keep it Clean. Please avoid obscene, vulgar, lewd, racist or sexually-oriented language. PLEASE TURN OFF YOUR CAPS LOCK. Don't Threaten. Threats of harming another person will not be tolerated. Be Truthful. Don't knowingly lie about anyone or anything. Be Nice.

                "content": "Your News Talk and Sports Leader Looks like Mother Nature had a change of plans on how to ring in 2025. The National Weather Service has cancelled the Winter Storm Watch for Central New York to replace it with a more serious alert that has upped snowfall totals across the region. The NWS has recently issued Lake Effect Snow Warning that will last through the weekend. The service says the advisory will activate at 1pm Wednesday, January 1, and will remain in effect through 4pm Sunday, January 5. This weather alert encompasses all of Oneida, Madison, Herkimer, Cayuga, Hamilton, Jefferson, Lewis, Oswego, and Onondaga County. The areas likely to get wholloped are all in North Country, with the NWS saying places like Lowville could see between 2 to 3 feet of snow. The higher elevations could potentially see even more snow. Meanwhile, Northern Oneida, Onondaga, and Madison County could see over 2 feet of snow by the time this prolonged weather event finishes with us. The only area under the Lake Effect Snow Warning looking to see less than a foot of snow is southern Cayuga County, with the NWS saying localized snow accumulations by Sunday could be between 6 to 12 inches. The agency says Herkimer and Hamilton County will see about the same amount of snow. IIn addition to the snow, the NWS warns of whipping winds of up to 45 miles per hour that could imitate blizzard-like conditions and create impossible travel conditions. Motorists who must be on the road are strongly advised to plan ahead, decrease their speeds, and increase their follow distances. If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water in your vehicle in case of an emergency. Drivers can also dial 511 to hear the latest road conditions. The NWS says during this time, bands of lake effect snow can cause whiteout conditions and drop visibilities to nothing. It can also cause the roads to become slippery. What makes this situation more dangerous is that lake effect snow conditions can change rapidly, so motorists are urged to prepare in case the weather switches for the worse. Adding insult to injury will be a cold blast of air that will cause temperatures to plummet into the teens and possibly the single digits by Sunday. The good news is, if you'd want to call it that, this could reduce the chances of us having to shovel heavy, wet snow. That all said, what an interesting way to ring in the New Year. Who would have thought 2025 would start out with 5 days straight of lake effect snow? Just know that this might be the beginning of a very rough month because weather watchers are already tracking a potential blizzard sometime within the second week of January. WIBX will chat with Ray Stagich of The Weather Channel when the weather models develop more confidence about this potential blizzard.

The game is scheduled to be played on December 31, 2024, with the Chicago Blackhawks hosting the St. Louis Blues at Wrigley Field in Chicago.[1] For the first time, two Winter Classics will be held in the same calendar year, as the 2024 Winter Classic had been played on January 1, 2024. The league announced the game on February 7, 2024, during the first intermission of the NHL on TNT's broadcast of the Tampa Bay Lightning–New York Rangers game.[1][2] Several media sources however leaked the game's site and opponents on the day before.[3][4][5] This would be a rematch of the 2017 NHL Winter Classic, when the St. Louis Blues defeated the Chicago Blackhawks, 4−1, at Busch Stadium in St. Louis. This would also be Wrigley Field's second time hosting an NHL outdoor game, having previously hosted the 2009 NHL Winter Classic.[1] New Year's Eve was chosen as the date for the Winter Classic, as opposed to its traditional New Year's Day scheduling, in response to the expansion of the College Football Playoff from four teams to 12 beginning in the 2024–25 postseason. The Winter Classic had been on a steady decline in ratings, one exacerbated by the move to the cable-only TNT Sports in 2022, and the move to the less crowded slot on New Year's Eve afternoon (much of the game will take place in the gap between the 2024 Texas Bowl ending and the Fiesta Bowl's kickoff) is intended to make the event \"something (...) very unique on that day.\"[6] In the United States, broadcasting rights to the game are held by TNT, with sister channel TruTV simulcasting, and streaming on Max. In Canada, rights are held by Sportsnet with streaming on Sportsnet+.",

                "title": "Louisville stops late two-point conversion to hold off Washington in 2024 Sun Bowl thriller - CBSSports.com",
                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Louisville escaped with a 35-34 victory over Washington in a thrilling Sun Bowl on Tuesday as the Cardinals thwarted a go-ahead two-point conversion attempt from the Huskies with nine seconds left. Then, after receiving an unsportsmanlike penalty, the Cardinals had to keep Washington from recovering a dangerous onside kick that could have returned the football to the Huskies in prime field position. It made for a wild finish to a game that the Cardinals led 35-21 until a furious Washington rally. The Huskies drew within 35-28 when they capped a 97-yard touchdown drive with a 31-yard touchdown connection between Demond Williams Jr. and Giles Jackson with 3:42 remaining. After a defensive stand from the Huskies, Williams and Jackson connected for a fourth score. But instead of kicking an extra point to tie the game and likely force overtime, first-year Washington coach Jedd Fisch rolled the dice and and went for two. Williams targeted receiver Jeremiah Hunter in the back corner of the end zone, but Louisville's Antonio Watts broke up the pass to preserve the victory. With Louisville quarterback Tyler Shough opting out, backup Harrison Bailey made the fourth start of his five-year college career. The former Tennessee and UNLV signal-caller threw a career-high three touchdown passes. The running game gave Bailey plenty of help, too, as Isaac Brown and Duke Watson combined for 182 yards rushing on 28 carries. While the Cardinals were without Shough and star receiver Ja'Corey Brooks, they did receive an infusion of talent as Caullin Lacy played for the first time since October. Lacy opted in October to sit out for the rest of the season after appearing in four regular season games. His decision came after a collarbone injury limited him to begin the season, and the move allowed him to use the 2024 season as a redshirt year. Playing in the bowl game did not jeopardize his redshirt status, and he showcased his dynamic playmaking ability with a rushing touchdown, a receiving touchdown and a 25-yard punt return. The win marked just the second bowl victory of the postseason for the ACC, which is now 2-9. Washington's Giles Jackson made his fourth touchdown grab of the day with nine seconds left on a fourth-and-goal play from the 1-yard line to bring Washington within 35-34 with nine seconds left. Huskies coach Jedd Fisch opted to go for two and the win, but Demond Williams Jr.'s pass attempt was deflected and fell incomplete, allowing the Cardinals to survive a Sun Bowl thriller. With Louisville quarterback Tyler Shough opting out, backup Harrison Bailey made the fourth start of his five-year college career. The former Tennessee and UNLV signal-caller threw a career-high three touchdown passes. The running game gave Bailey plenty of help, too, as Isaac Brown and Duke Watson combined for 182 yards rushing on 28 carries. Washington's offense finally found a rhythm again wit a 13-play, 97-yard touchdown drive capped by a 31-yard touchdown pass from Demond Williams Jr. to Giles Jackson. It was their third touchdown connection of the day — all on strikes of 30+ yards — and it brings the Huskies within a touchdown with under four minutes to play. Jackson had three receiving touchdowns on the season entering today but is ending his six-year college career with a bang. Louisville had some punter drama for this game with normal starter Brady Hodges away from the team. Carter Schwartz has stepped in and done a nice job. He just booted a 54-yarder downed on Washington's 3-yard line. He's punted five times and is averaging 43.4 yards per punt with three of his punts downed inside the 20-yard line. Per Hodges' Twitter account, he's been away from the team since Dec. 10 and is claiming Louisville's collective \"didn't want to hold up their end of things.\" Louisville turned on the jets with a 54-yard run from Duke Watson that set up an 8-yard touchdown run from Caullin Lacy to cap a 2-play drive that took a total of 52 seconds. That followed a three-and-out from Washington, which is reeling offensively to begin the second half. The balance in Louisville's attack has been impressive, and the Huskies continue to have little answer for the Cardinals' rushing attack. Louisville quarterback Harrison Bailey just found tight end Nate Kurisky wide open over the middle for a 21-yard touchdown strike on a 3rd-and-12. That was Bailey's third touchdown toss of the day, which matches the total he posted over the past four seasons at three different schools. The Cardinals have been lethal on third downs in this game and have broken the second half stalemate to take a 28-21 lead. Louisville's defense needs to regroup. After a strong start that included a pick-six from Tahveon Nicholson, the Cardinals have struggled to contain Washington's passing game. Giles Jackson has gashed Louisville's secondary for a pair of big touchdown receptions, and quarterback Demond Williams Jr.'s mobility is now giving Louisville's defense something else to think about. Washington's trouble has been defending Louisville's run game, which has kept the Huskies off-balance with a handful of explosive gains. Both offenses began on shaky footing under inexperienced backup quarterbacks, but as the half progressed, both of them settled in to create some fireworks in a tightly contested Sun Bowl. Demond Williams Jr. has been the star of the show for Washington in his second career start with 168 yards passing and two touchdowns through the air after beginning the game with a pick six. Not to be outdone, Louisville's Harrison Bailey has tossed a couple of scores. Isaac Brown and Duke Watson have also totaled 95 yards rushing on a combined 16 carries for the Cardinals in the first-ever meeting between these two teams. Demond Williams Jr. has now accounted for three touchdowns in the first half after taking off for an 8-yard touchdown run on a third-and-4 play. The freshman has settled in nicely during his second career start after beginning the game with a pick-six. Williams brings obvious shades of Arizona QB Noah Fifita to the table. He was originally committed to the Wildcats and coach Jedd Fisch before following Fisch to Washington. Like Fifita, Williams is an undersized but dynamic playmaker with a flair for the dramatic. Williams may have even more foot speed. Harrison Bailey just flashed his arm talent by dropping a corner route in the bucket for Antonio Meeks, who reeled it in for a 28-yard touchdown to put the Cards back on top. That was a perfect throw on third-and-4. Prior to that drive, Louisville hadn't completed a pass of more than nine yards. But Bailey has now completed 4 of his last 5, which included a 17-yard strike on third-and-8 to keep the scoring drive alive. The offenses have officially settled in. Demond Williams and Giles Jackson just connected for another huge touchdown against a Louisville secondary that is suddenly looking quite vulnerable. Jackson was wide open out of the slot, and Williams hit him in stride for a 49-yard score to tie the game. Williams has completed his last four passes, totaling 110 yards and two touchdowns in that span. Jackson has the first multi-touchdown game of his six-year college career. Jeff Brohm opted to go for it on fourth-and-1 from Louisville's 49-yard line. Duke Watson got a handoff, and Washington's Carson Bruener stuffed him with a leaping/diving tackle. The initial spot was unfavorable for the Cardinals, but the ruling was upheld upon review. Big-time defensive play for the Huskies, who will take over at midfield trailing 14-7 midway through the second quarter. Louisville star transfer Caullin Lacy was expected to make among the Cardinals' top perimeter threats this season but was limited to only four games due to injury. However, he's playing in the bowl game (he'll still be able to use 2024 as a redshirt year) and is making his presence felt. His 21-yard punt return helped give the Cardinals a short field, and he just scored on a 9-yard touchdown pass from Harrison Bailey. That was Lacy's third catch of the game in his first action since Oct. 19. Demond Williams Jr. just found a big dose of redemption for Washington. The freshman quarterback hit Giles Jackson for a 40-yard touchdown pass deep over the middle. Jackson was in 1-on-1 coverage and went up to make a big play to even the score at 7-7. There was no safety help, and Jackson beat his man without much trouble. That should help the Washington offense settle down after a shaky start. Both quarterbacks have been shaky early, which is not stunning considering the lack of starting experience for both. Louisville's Harrison Bailey misfired on both passing attempts on Louisville's second offensive series as the teams traded punts. Demond Williams Jr. is 0 for 2 for Washington with the pick-six. Neither team has a first down. Disaster struck early for Washington. Faced with a third-and-long, Demond Williams Jr. dropped back. He was looking for an underneath receiver breaking to the outside on a shallow cross. But Tahveon Nicholson jumped the route and ran it back 21 yards for a touchdown. Just like that, it's 7-0 Louisville. The Cards have seven interceptions in their last four games. There are just 12 total yards between the teams through two total possessions, but the Cards have the lead and Williams may have some shaky confidence. Louisville faced a fourth-and-1 from its own 34-yard line on its first possession, which forced Jeff Brohm to make a tough decision. He opted to play it safe, and Carter Schwartz booted it 44 yards. Washington will take over from its own 22-yard line. Demond Williams Jr. is making his second career start at QB for the Huskies, who are hoping to lay a foundation for their 2025 offense today. Two of the most productive passing offenses in the country clash at the historic Sun Bowl as Washington faces off against Louisville on New Year's Eve. The Huskies turned over much of the roster after a trip to the CFP National Championship a year ago but managed to reach bowl eligibility after beating USC and UCLA in the final weeks of the season. Louisville ranked among the top teams in the ACC but suffered at the expense of close-game luck, finishing with an 8-4 record. All four losses -- Notre Dame, SMU, Miami and Stanford -- were by one score. The Cardinals gave Notre Dame their closest game of the season outside of the loss to Northern Illinois. These two programs have never played one another, and they have rarely played in the Sun Bowl, either. Washington has played in the Sun Bowl four times but not since 2002. The program's only win came in 1979. Since Louisville only joined the ACC a little over a decade ago, you have to go all the way back to 1957 to catch the Cardinals' only appearance in El Paso -- a 34-20 win over Drake. Based on the season, Louisville would be substantial favorites to crush Washington. Even with several key opt outs, there's still plenty of talent remaining, headlined by Isaac Brown. Louisville's highly rated defense will be able to cause just enough mistakes from Washington QB Demond Williams and escape the battle as victors. Pick: Louisville -2.5 While incumbent Washington quarterback Will Rogers will participate in the bowl game, true freshman Demond Williams will start his second straight game for the Huskies after debuting against Oregon. Against one of the best teams in college football, Williams posted 201 yards passing and a touchdown on only 20 pass attempts, completing 85% of his passes and recording a passer rating of 185.9. Williams is the future of the program, and that will continue against Louisville. While these two teams are known for passing, the running backs may be the best players on the team, especially in the bowl games. Washington's Jonah Coleman transferred to Seattle with first-year coach Jedd Fisch from Arizona, posting 184 carries for 1,011 yards and 10 touchdowns in his first season. However, Louisville running back Isaac Brown might be the most surprising breakout player in the ACC. The freshman exploded for 1,074 yards and 11 touchdowns on a mind-boggling 7.3 yards per carry. In a decimation of ACC champion Clemson, he posted 151 yards and a touchdown on 20 carries. After the 8-4 season for Louisville, several key players have declared for the NFL Draft and opted out of the bowl game -- most notably, quarterback Tyler Shough and wide receiver Ja'Corey Brooks are both leaving to prepare for the draft. Both ranked top 20 nationally in passing yards and receiving yards per game, respectively. Star defensive lineman Ashton Gillotte will do the same after posting 26.5 sacks and 41 tackles for loss in four seasons. Washington linebacker Khmori House is the only major loss for the Huskies after transferring to North Carolina. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

                "content": "Filed under: WE’RE GRRRRRRRREAT! The transfer portal and NIL, among other rule changes, have completely reshaped the sport of college football these last few years. Virtually every aspect of the sport has felt the impact of these changes, and bowl games are no exception. Following the end of the college football regular season, the majority of the conversation around Louisville football as been around the players leaving, the players coming, and what next season will look like. For most, gone are the days where they count down the days to the bowl game and see it as the crowning achievement and reward for a great season. For most, it’s just an afterthought and a fun exhibition where win or lose, it’s just nice to see your team play one last time. After all, who could blame them when the team looks dramatically different from the one you had just watched for 12 games? But I feel confident in saying all of that went out the window as soon as the game started. I’m not sure what it was about this bowl in particular, but I think it had a lot to do with seeing how much the players on both teams cared and how hard they were going after it. From the first snap it felt like fans were 100% back in and any fleeting thoughts of bowl games being “meaningless” or the result not mattering were completely gone. The game developed into an instant classic, a nailbiter, and ultimately a momentum boosting game that we can truly use as a launch pad for the 2025 season with the majority of the game’s biggest contributors coming back next year. On offense it’s hard not to be over the moon about what’s in store for us. The running back tandem of Isaac Brown and Duke Watson once again dominated as they helped Louisville rush for over 200 yards for the 6th time this year, leading the ACC. Chris Bell and Caulin Lacy are certifiable studs, and getting them both to return would be massive. Let’s take a moment to appreciate Caulin Lacy’s insane effort play today: Caullin Lacy came to play! What an effort for the @LouisvilleFB touchdown. pic.twitter.com/BH7QmjQ8Ls Still no idea how he scored on that play. Beyond ecstatic he’s coming back. The o-line gave the very green Harrison Bailey good protection for most of the game and you got to see him really settle into the game and improve as time went on. And they were obviously the force behind the dominant run game. Having a majority of that group coming back next year is another area to be excited about. And Harrison Bailey, what a game! You could tell early on that he was a little tight and rusty, but as he settled in he made some great reads and throws, especially this beautiful ball to Antonio Meeks: Another touchdown pass for Harrison Bailey and @LouisvilleFB grabs the lead. pic.twitter.com/hpn2WHDv5Z Word on the street is that Bailey has another year of eligibility, which would be great to have if he comes back and battles Miller Moss for a starting position. He’d be an awfully nice player to have as a back up if Moss is the real deal. Regardless, what a way for him to come in in a spot like this and lead the team to victory with 3 TDs on 16/25 passing attempts. As for the defense, while there were plenty of moments that weren’t so great, many of which DC Ron English was to blame for (a conversation for another day), they ultimately came up big when needed most and got us the win in dramatic fashion. The pick 6 was pretty cool: PICK SIX! Tahveon Nicholson soars into the end zone for a @LouisvilleFB touchdown. pic.twitter.com/woLBgB6jgp (we need to do whatever we can to get Tahveon Nicholson to come back next year) But the biggest play of the game came at the end of a wild game-defining drive where Washington had been sacked on 3rd and goal by a crazy shoelace sack by Rene Konga, and then were stopped on 4th and goal only for an egregious defensive pass interference call to be made, giving Washington another 4 chances. Washington eventually cashed in on 4th and Goal to cut the score to 35-34, and went for 2 to win and seal the game against a defense that was gassed. But then Antonio Watts made a play I think most of us will remember for a long time to come: ANTONIO WATTS MAKES THE PLAY FOR @LouisvilleFB!! pic.twitter.com/Z68I7Yfxt2 The defense, as they’ve done many times in the Jeff Brohm era, came up big when we needed them most. Such a cool way to all but end a dramatic bowl game. The onside kick was terrifying, but we don’t need to talk about that either. With so much to look forward to on offense, and with Miller Moss already in the fold, one would think that Louisville will be spending a majority of their transfer portal efforts on restocking a talented, but inconsistent defense. Whether or not any staff changes will be made on that side of the ball are yet to be seen, and I don’t want to bring up anything overly negative, but in my opinion it’s hard to see this program being a championship-caliber one with Ron English at the helm. MOVING ON! Washington deserves credit for battling their way back into this one. Demond Williams Jr. gave UofL headaches all day with his legs and his ability to make crazy play after crazy play. I finally understand how annoying it must be to play against guys like Lamar Jackson. He was outstanding as he went 26/32 for 374yds, 4 TDs through the air, and 48 rushing yards and 1 TD on the ground. He was especially good at finding Giles Jackson who had 11 receptions for 164 yards and 4 TDs. They were both studs and were massive problems. Before we put a bow on the season can we talk about the weird absence of starting punter Brady Hodges? Brad Nesslar was saying at the beginning of the game UofL came out for warmups and he wasn’t there, so Carter Schwartz got the start, and Brady Hodges was a “late opt-out”. Initially there was some speculation he had fled to Mexico, or had been kidnapped by the cartel, but he put those fears to rest with this very curious tweet: I have not been with the team since December 10th. @502_Circle told me September 6th, they would be paying and are still yet to hold up their end of the deal. I graduated on December 13th and had every intention on being with the team had they held up their end of the deal. A lot to unpack here. I really have no idea the validity of this tweet. It’s also the first I’ve ever heard of a player not being paid properly by the 502Circle, and for it to first occur with the punter(?) seems very... curious. And then the strong performance from Carter Schwartz didn’t exactly help Hodge’s matters. Something to keep an eye on, I guess. All in all, what a fun game and a great way to finish a season that can really be a launch pad for 2025. 242 Days until EKU. Can’t wait to see y’all then. Gambling Problem?

        "Puerto Rico power outages": [

                "title": "Much of Puerto Rico remains in the dark after massive New Year's Eve power outage",
                "content": "Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Puerto Rico suffered the latest in a string of widespread power outages Tuesday that at one point had nearly 1.3 million businesses or homes — most of the island — in the dark. An infrastructure problem at a power plant on the island's southern coast left more than 1 million energy customers without power across the U.S. territory at 5:30 a.m., energy company Luma said in an update on X Tuesday morning. Miosotis Corretjer, a San Juan resident, said that the situation was “totally frustrating” and that the government wasn’t doing enough. “The people say that we don’t want Luma because it’s the worst service of electricity that we have in the history of our country,” she said. “It’s sad that in this day, the last day of the year, that impacts our holiday traditions, our Navidad, everything is so sad for the people of Puerto Rico.” By early evening, Luma announced that electricity for more than 336,000 customers had been restored, amounting to a return of power for more than 1 in 5 customers who had been in the dark. \"Critical facilities, including more than 16 hospitals such as the Naguabo Hospital, and essential infrastructure like the Super Aqueduct and other Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority installations, have been re-energized,\" it said in its early evening update. Luma continued, \"Our teams continue to work diligently toward full restoration.\" The news was one of multiple updates informing Puerto Ricans that power was returning, albeit in often small steps. Luma said in an earlier statement that the fault appeared to be an underground cable and that it was working with partners to restart the island's power network. \"LUMA will be restoring power to customers in phases. We’ve already begun the process of reenergizing some customers, with the full restoration process taking between 24 and 48 hours as conditions permit,\" the company said. Josué Colón, director of the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, the public body that runs the grid for 1.5 million customers in cooperation with Luma, said in a radio interview that a problem with a power line in the south caused a \"cascade effect\" that led to multiple power plants failing. He said it would take \"much of the day\" to fix the problem. Puerto Rican Gov. Pedro Pierluisi said on X that he was in touch with Luma and the private energy company Genera PR. \"We are demanding answers and solutions from both Luma and Genera, who must expedite the restart of the generating units outside the fault area and keep the people duly informed about the measures they are taking to restore service throughout the Island,\" he said. Puerto Rico’s incoming governor, Jenniffer González, said on social media that the island “can’t keep relying on an energy system that fails our people. Today’s blackout and the uncertainty around restoration continue to impact our economy and quality of life.” González said that stabilizing Puerto Rico’s electrical grid will be her top priority as governor. The Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport said it was working on electricity generators but that flights were operating normally. Puerto Rico’s electrical system had already been in decline when Category 4 Hurricane Maria devastated the island in 2017 and its power grid. The island continues to be beset by power outages as the fragile electric grid has not been permanently rebuilt since the storm razed it. In 2020, the government chose Luma, a partnership between Calgary, Alberta-based Atco and Quanta Services Inc. of Houston, to serve its electricity customers in cooperation with the state power authority. It began operating in Puerto Rico in 2021. Power outages are still a frustratingly frequent occurrence for many Puerto Ricans. A string of blackouts during the summer sparked protests and prompted San Juan Mayor Miguel Romero to declare a state of emergency. In 2022, New York Attorney General Letitia James called for a federal investigation of Luma. \"Five years after Hurricanes Irma and Maria wreaked havoc on Puerto Rico, and after billions of federal dollars were spent to modernize and strengthen the island’s electrical grid, residents continue to endure frequent outages and high electrical rates,\" James' office said in a statement that year. Customers were subjected to seven rate increases in 2022. Puerto Ricans already pay more than twice what mainland American customers do for an average electricity bill. In 2023, Luma said it reduced outage frequency by 30% in a year's time and launched 251 federally funded projects to rebuild the patched-up grid. Still, those protests led to the U.S.-owned Genera PR taking over management of previously state-owned power stations, which are on average 45 years old — twice the age of equivalent facilities on the U.S. mainland — and highly reliant on fossil fuels. More than 700,000 customers were without power in Puerto Rico in August when Tropical Storm Ernesto hit the island. Dennis Romero is a breaking news reporter for NBC News Digital.

                "title": "Alabama - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Alabama (/ˌæləˈbæmə/ AL-ə-BAM-ə)[9] is a state in the Southeastern region of the United States. It borders Tennessee to the north, Georgia to the east, Florida and the Gulf of Mexico to the south, and Mississippi to the west. Alabama is the 30th largest by area, and the 24th-most populous of the 50 U.S. states.[10][11] Alabama is nicknamed the Yellowhammer State, after the state bird. Alabama is also known as the \"Heart of Dixie\" and the \"Cotton State\". The state has diverse geography, with the north dominated by the mountainous Tennessee Valley and the south by Mobile Bay, a historically significant port. Alabama's capital is Montgomery, and its largest city by population and area is Huntsville.[12] Its oldest city is Mobile, founded by French colonists (Alabama Creoles) in 1702 as the capital of French Louisiana.[13][14] Greater Birmingham is Alabama's largest metropolitan area and its economic center.[15] Politically, as part of the Deep South, or \"Bible Belt\", Alabama is a predominantly conservative state, and is known for its Southern culture. Within Alabama, American football, particularly at the college level, plays a major part of the state's culture. Originally home to many native tribes, present-day Alabama was a Spanish territory beginning in the sixteenth century until the French acquired it in the early eighteenth century. The British won the territory in 1763 until losing it in the American Revolutionary War. Spain held Mobile as part of Spanish West Florida until 1813. In December 1819, Alabama was recognized as a state. During the antebellum period, Alabama was a major producer of cotton, and widely used African American slave labor. In 1861, the state seceded from the United States to become part of the Confederate States of America, with Montgomery acting as its first capital, and rejoined the Union in 1868. Following the American Civil War, Alabama would suffer decades of economic hardship, in part due to agriculture and a few cash crops being the main driver of the state's economy. Similar to other former slave states, Alabamian legislators employed Jim Crow laws from the late 19th century up until the 1960s. High-profile events such as the Selma to Montgomery marches made the state a major focal point of the civil rights movement in the 1950s and 1960s. During and after World War II, Alabama grew as the state's economy diversified with new industries. In 1960, the establishment of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville helped boost Alabama's economic growth by developing a local aerospace industry. Alabama's economy in the 21st century is based on automotive, finance, tourism, manufacturing, aerospace, mineral extraction, healthcare, education, retail, and technology.[16] The name of the Alabama River and state is derived from the Alabama people, a Muskogean-speaking tribe whose members lived just below the confluence of the Coosa and Tallapoosa rivers on the upper reaches of the river.[17] In the Alabama language, the word for a person of Alabama lineage is Albaamo (or variously Albaama or Albàamo in different dialects; the plural form is Albaamaha).[18] The word's spelling varies significantly among historical sources.[19] The first usage appears in three accounts of the Hernando de Soto expedition of 1540: Garcilaso de la Vega used Alibamo, while the Knight of Elvas and Rodrigo Ranjel wrote Alibamu and Limamu, respectively, in transliterations of the term.[19] As early as 1702, the French called the tribe the Alibamon, with French maps identifying the river as Rivière des Alibamons.[17] Other spellings of the name have included Alibamu, Alabamo, Albama, Alebamon, Alibama, Alibamou, Alabamu, and Allibamou.[19][20][21] The use of state names derived from Native American languages is common in the U.S. An estimated 26 states have names of Native American origin.[22] Sources disagree on the word's meaning. Some scholars suggest the word comes from the Choctaw alba (meaning 'plants' or 'weeds') and amo (meaning 'to cut', 'to trim', or 'to gather').[19][23][24] The meaning may have been 'clearers of the thicket'[23] or 'herb gatherers',[24][25] referring to clearing land for cultivation[20] or collecting medicinal plants.[25] The state has numerous place names of Native American origin.[26][27] An 1842 article in the Jacksonville Republican proposed it meant 'Here We Rest'.[19] This notion was popularized in the 1850s through the writings of Alexander Beaufort Meek.[19] Experts in the Muskogean languages have not found any evidence to support such a translation.[17][19] Indigenous peoples of varying cultures lived in the area for thousands of years before the advent of European colonization. Trade with the northeastern tribes by the Ohio River began during the Burial Mound Period (1000 BC – 700 AD) and continued until European contact.[28] The agrarian Mississippian culture covered most of the state from 1000 to 1600 AD, with one of its major centers built at what is now the Moundville Archaeological Site in Moundville, Alabama.[29][30] This is the second-largest complex of the classic Middle Mississippian era, after Cahokia in present-day Illinois, which was the center of the culture. Analysis of artifacts from archaeological excavations at Moundville were the basis of scholars' formulating the characteristics of the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex (SECC).[31] Contrary to popular belief, the SECC appears to have no direct links to Mesoamerican culture but developed independently. The Ceremonial Complex represents a major component of the religion of the Mississippian peoples; it is one of the primary means by which their religion is understood.[32] Among the historical tribes of Native American people living in present-day Alabama at the time of European contact were the Cherokee, an Iroquoian language people; and the Muskogean-speaking Alabama (Alibamu), Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek, and Koasati.[33] While part of the same large language family, the Muskogee tribes developed distinct cultures and languages. The Spanish were the first Europeans to reach Alabama during their exploration of North America in the 16th century. The expedition of Hernando de Soto passed through Mabila and other parts of the state in 1540. More than 160 years later, the French founded the region's first European settlement at Old Mobile in 1702.[34] The city was moved to the current site of Mobile in 1711. This area was claimed by the French from 1702 to 1763 as part of La Louisiane.[35] After the French lost to the British in the Seven Years' War, it became part of British West Florida from 1763 to 1783. After the U.S. victory in the American Revolutionary War, the territory was divided between the United States and Spain. The latter retained control of this western territory from 1783 until the surrender of the Spanish garrison at Mobile to U.S. forces on April 13, 1813.[35][36] Thomas Bassett, a loyalist to the British monarchy during the Revolutionary era, was one of the earliest white settlers in the state outside Mobile. He settled in the Tombigbee District during the early 1770s.[37] The district's boundaries were roughly limited to the area within a few miles of the Tombigbee River and included portions of what is today southern Clarke County, northernmost Mobile County, and most of Washington County.[38][39] What are now Baldwin and Mobile counties became part of Spanish West Florida in 1783, part of the independent Republic of West Florida in 1810, and finally part of the Mississippi Territory in 1812. Most of what is now the northern two-thirds of Alabama was known as the Yazoo lands beginning during the British colonial period. It was claimed by the Province of Georgia from 1767 onwards. Following the American Revolutionary War, it remained a part of Georgia, although heavily disputed.[40][41] With the exception of the area around Mobile and the Yazoo lands, what is now the lower one-third of Alabama was made part of the Mississippi Territory when it was organized in 1798. The Yazoo lands were added to the territory in 1804, following the Yazoo land scandal.[41][42] Spain kept a claim on its former Spanish West Florida territory in what would become the coastal counties until the Adams–Onís Treaty officially ceded it to the U.S. in 1819.[36] Before Mississippi's admission to statehood on December 10, 1817, the more sparsely settled eastern half of the territory was separated and named the Alabama Territory. The United States Congress created the Alabama Territory on March 3, 1817. St. Stephens, now abandoned, served as the territorial capital from 1817 to 1819.[43] Alabama was admitted as the 22nd state on December 14, 1819, with Congress selecting Huntsville as the site for the first Constitutional Convention. From July 5 to August 2, 1819, delegates met to prepare the new state constitution. Huntsville served as temporary capital from 1819 to 1820, when the seat of government moved to Cahaba in Dallas County.[44] Cahaba, now a ghost town, was the first permanent state capital from 1820 to 1825.[45] The Alabama Fever land rush was underway when the state was admitted to the Union, with settlers and land speculators pouring into the state to take advantage of fertile land suitable for cotton cultivation.[46][47] Part of the frontier in the 1820s and 1830s, its constitution provided for universal suffrage for white men.[48] Southeastern planters and traders from the Upper South brought slaves with them as the cotton plantations in Alabama expanded. The economy of the central Black Belt (named for its dark, productive soil) was built around large cotton plantations whose owners' wealth grew mainly from slave labor.[48] The area also drew many poor, disenfranchised people who became subsistence farmers. Alabama had an estimated population of under 10,000 people in 1810, but it increased to more than 300,000 people by 1830.[46] Most Native American tribes were completely removed from the state within a few years of the passage of the Indian Removal Act by Congress in 1830.[49] From 1826 to 1846, Tuscaloosa served as Alabama's capital. On January 30, 1846, the Alabama legislature announced it had voted to move the capital city from Tuscaloosa to Montgomery. The first legislative session in the new capital met in December 1847.[50] A new capitol building was erected under the direction of Stephen Decatur Button of Philadelphia. The first structure burned down in 1849, but was rebuilt on the same site in 1851. This second capitol building in Montgomery remains to the present day. It was designed by Barachias Holt of Exeter, Maine.[51][52] By 1860, the population had increased to 964,201 people, of which nearly half, 435,080, were enslaved African Americans, and 2,690 were free people of color.[53] On January 11, 1861, Alabama declared its secession from the Union. After remaining an independent republic for a few days, it joined the Confederate States of America. The Confederacy's capital was initially at Montgomery. Alabama was heavily involved in the American Civil War. Although comparatively few battles were fought in the state, Alabama contributed about 120,000 soldiers to the war effort. A company of cavalry soldiers from Huntsville, Alabama, joined Nathan Bedford Forrest's battalion in Hopkinsville, Kentucky. The company wore new uniforms with yellow trim on the sleeves, collar and coattails. This led to them being greeted with \"Yellowhammer\", and the name later was applied to all Alabama troops in the Confederate Army.[54] Alabama's slaves were freed by the 13th Amendment in 1865.[55] Alabama was under military rule from the end of the war in May 1865 until its official restoration to the Union in 1868. From 1867 to 1874, with most white citizens barred temporarily from voting and freedmen enfranchised, many African Americans emerged as political leaders in the state. Alabama was represented in Congress during this period by three African-American congressmen: Jeremiah Haralson, Benjamin S. Turner, and James T. Rapier.[56] Following the war, the state remained chiefly agricultural, with an economy tied to cotton. During the Reconstruction era, state legislators ratified a new state constitution in 1868 which created the state's first public school system and expanded women's rights. Legislators funded numerous public road and railroad projects, although these were plagued with allegations of fraud and misappropriation.[56] Organized insurgent, resistance groups tried to suppress the freedmen and Republicans. These groups included The Ku Klux Klan, the Pale Faces, Knights of the White Camellia, Red Shirts, and the White League.[56] Reconstruction in Alabama ended in 1874, when the Democrats regained control of the legislature and governor's office through an election dominated by fraud and violence. They wrote another constitution in 1875,[56] and the legislature passed the Blaine Amendment, prohibiting public money from being used to finance religious-affiliated schools.[57] The same year, legislation was approved that called for racially segregated schools.[58] Railroad passenger cars were segregated in 1891.[58] The new 1901 constitution of Alabama included provisions for voter registration that effectively disenfranchised large portions of the population, including nearly all African Americans and Native Americans, and tens of thousands of poor European Americans, through making voter registration difficult, requiring a poll tax and literacy test.[59] The 1901 constitution required racial segregation of public schools. By 1903 only 2,980 African Americans were registered in Alabama, although at least 74,000 were literate. This compared to more than 181,000 African Americans eligible to vote in 1900. The numbers dropped even more in later decades.[60] The state legislature passed additional racial segregation laws related to public facilities into the 1950s: jails were segregated in 1911; hospitals in 1915; toilets, hotels, and restaurants in 1928; and bus stop waiting rooms in 1945.[58] While the planter class had persuaded poor whites to vote for this legislative effort to suppress black voting, the new restrictions resulted in their disenfranchisement as well, due mostly to the imposition of a cumulative poll tax.[60] By 1941, whites constituted a slight majority of those disenfranchised by these laws: 600,000 whites vs. 520,000 African Americans.[60] Nearly all blacks had lost the ability to vote. Despite numerous legal challenges which succeeded in overturning certain provisions, the state legislature would create new ones to maintain disenfranchisement. The exclusion of blacks from the political system persisted until after passage of federal civil rights legislation in 1965 to enforce their constitutional rights as citizens.[61] The rural-dominated Alabama legislature consistently underfunded schools and services for the disenfranchised African Americans, but it did not relieve them of paying taxes.[48] Partially as a response to chronic underfunding of education for African Americans in the South, the Rosenwald Fund began funding the construction of what came to be known as Rosenwald Schools. In Alabama, these schools were designed, and the construction partially financed with Rosenwald funds, which paid one-third of the construction costs. The fund required the local community and state to raise matching funds to pay the rest. Black residents effectively taxed themselves twice, by raising additional monies to supply matching funds for such schools, which were built in many rural areas. They often donated land and labor as well.[62] Beginning in 1913, the first 80 Rosenwald Schools were built in Alabama for African American children. A total of 387 schools, seven teachers' houses, and several vocational buildings were completed by 1937 in the state. Several of the surviving school buildings in the state are now listed on the National Register of Historic Places.[62] Continued racial discrimination and lynchings, agricultural depression, and the failure of the cotton crops due to boll weevil infestation led tens of thousands of African Americans from rural Alabama and other states to seek opportunities in northern and midwestern cities during the early decades of the 20th century as part of the Great Migration out of the South.[63][64] Reflecting this emigration, the population growth rate in Alabama (see \"historical populations\" table below) dropped by nearly half from 1910 to 1920.[65] At the same time, many rural people migrated to the city of Birmingham to work in new industrial jobs. Birmingham experienced such rapid growth it was called the \"Magic City\".[66] By 1920, Birmingham was the 36th-largest city in the United States.[67] Heavy industry and mining were the basis of its economy. Its residents were under-represented for decades in the state legislature, which refused to redistrict after each decennial census according to population changes, as it was required by the state constitution. This did not change until the late 1960s following a lawsuit and court order.[68] Beginning in the 1940s, when the courts started taking the first steps to recognize the voting rights of black voters, the Alabama legislature took several counter-steps designed to disfranchise black voters. The legislature passed, and the voters ratified [as these were mostly white voters], a state constitutional amendment that gave local registrars greater latitude to disqualify voter registration applicants. Black citizens in Mobile successfully challenged this amendment as a violation of the Fifteenth Amendment. The legislature also changed the boundaries of Tuskegee to a 28-sided figure designed to fence out blacks from the city limits. The Supreme Court unanimously held that this racial \"gerrymandering\" violated the Constitution. In 1961, ... the Alabama legislature also intentionally diluted the effect of the black vote by instituting numbered place requirements for local elections.[69] Industrial development related to the demands of World War II brought a level of prosperity to the state not seen since before the civil war.[48] Rural workers poured into the largest cities in the state for better jobs and a higher standard of living. One example of this massive influx of workers occurred in Mobile. Between 1940 and 1943, more than 89,000 people moved into the city to work for war-related industries.[70] Cotton and other cash crops faded in importance as the state developed a manufacturing and service base. Despite massive population changes in the state from 1901 to 1961, the rural-dominated legislature refused to reapportion House and Senate seats based on population, as required by the state constitution to follow the results of decennial censuses. They held on to old representation to maintain political and economic power in agricultural areas. One result was that Jefferson County, containing Birmingham's industrial and economic powerhouse, contributed more than one-third of all tax revenue to the state, but did not receive a proportional amount in services. Urban interests were consistently underrepresented in the legislature. A 1960 study noted that because of rural domination, \"a minority of about 25% of the total state population is in majority control of the Alabama legislature.\"[68][71] In the United States Supreme Court cases of Baker v. Carr (1962) and Reynolds v. Sims (1964), the court ruled that the principle of \"one man, one vote\" needed to be the basis of both houses of state legislatures, and that their districts had to be based on population rather than geographic counties.[72][73] African Americans continued to press in the 1950s and 1960s to end disenfranchisement and segregation in the state through the civil rights movement, including legal challenges. In 1954, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Brown v. Board of Education that public schools had to be desegregated, but Alabama was slow to comply. During the 1960s, under Governor George Wallace, Alabama resisted compliance with federal demands for desegregation.[74][75] The civil rights movement had notable events in Alabama, including the Montgomery bus boycott (1955–1956), Freedom Rides in 1961, and 1965 Selma to Montgomery marches.[76] These contributed to Congressional passage and enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965 by the U.S. Congress.[77][78] Legal segregation ended in the states in 1964, but Jim Crow customs often continued until specifically challenged in court.[79] According to The New York Times, by 2017, many of Alabama's African Americans were living in Alabama's cities such as Birmingham and Montgomery. Also, the Black Belt region across central Alabama \"is home to largely poor counties that are predominantly African-American. These counties include Dallas, Lowndes, Marengo and Perry.\"[80] In 1972, for the first time since 1901, the legislature completed the congressional redistricting based on the decennial census. This benefited the urban areas that had developed, as well as all in the population who had been underrepresented for more than sixty years.[71] Other changes were made to implement representative state house and senate districts. Alabama has made some changes since the late 20th century and has used new types of voting to increase representation. In the 1980s, an omnibus redistricting case, Dillard v. Crenshaw County, challenged the at-large voting for representative seats of 180 Alabama jurisdictions, including counties and school boards. At-large voting had diluted the votes of any minority in a county, as the majority tended to take all seats. Despite African Americans making up a significant minority in the state, they had been unable to elect any representatives in most of the at-large jurisdictions.[69] As part of settlement of this case, five Alabama cities and counties, including Chilton County, adopted a system of cumulative voting for election of representatives in multi-seat jurisdictions. This has resulted in more proportional representation for voters. In another form of proportional representation, 23 jurisdictions use limited voting, as in Conecuh County. In 1982, limited voting was first tested in Conecuh County. Together use of these systems has increased the number of African Americans and women being elected to local offices, resulting in governments that are more representative of their citizens.[81] Beginning in the 1960s, the state's economy shifted away from its traditional lumber, steel, and textile industries because of increased foreign competition. Steel jobs, for instance, declined from 46,314 in 1950 to 14,185 in 2011.[82] However, the state, particularly Huntsville, benefited from the opening of the George C. Marshall Space Flight Center in 1960, a major facility in the development of the Saturn rocket program and the space shuttle. Technology and manufacturing industries, such as automobile assembly, replaced some the state's older industries in the late twentieth century, but the state's economy and growth lagged behind other states in the area, such as Georgia and Florida.[83] In 2001, Alabama Supreme Court chief justice Roy Moore installed a statue of the Ten Commandments in the capitol in Montgomery. In 2002, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court ordered the statue removed, but Moore refused to follow the court order, which led to protests around the capitol in favor of keeping the monument. The monument was removed in August 2003.[84] A few natural disasters have occurred in the state in the twenty-first century. In 2004, Hurricane Ivan, a category 3 storm upon landfall, struck the state and caused over $18 billion of damage. It was among the most destructive storms to strike the state in its modern history.[85] A super outbreak of 62 tornadoes hit the state in April 2011 and killed 238 people, devastating many communities.[86] Alabama is the thirtieth-largest state in the United States with 52,419 square miles (135,760 km2) of total area: 3.2% of the area is water, making Alabama 23rd in the amount of surface water, also giving it the second-largest inland waterway system in the United States.[87] About three-fifths of the land area is part of the Gulf Coastal Plain, a gentle plain with a general descent towards the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico. The North Alabama region is mostly mountainous, with the Tennessee River cutting a large valley and creating numerous creeks, streams, rivers, mountains, and lakes.[88] Alabama is bordered by the states of Tennessee to the north, Georgia to the east, Florida to the south, and Mississippi to the west. Alabama has coastline at the Gulf of Mexico, in the extreme southern edge of the state.[88] The state ranges in elevation from sea level[89] at Mobile Bay to more than 2,000 feet (610 m) in the northeast, to Mount Cheaha[88] at 2,413 ft (735 m).[90] Alabama's land consists of 22 million acres (89,000 km2) of forest or 67% of the state's total land area.[91] Suburban Baldwin County, along the Gulf Coast, is the largest county in the state in both land area and water area.[92] Areas in Alabama administered by the National Park Service include Horseshoe Bend National Military Park near Alexander City; Little River Canyon National Preserve near Fort Payne; Russell Cave National Monument in Bridgeport; Tuskegee Airmen National Historic Site in Tuskegee; and Tuskegee Institute National Historic Site near Tuskegee.[93] Additionally, Alabama has four National Forests: Conecuh, Talladega, Tuskegee, and William B. Bankhead.[94] Alabama also contains the Natchez Trace Parkway, the Selma To Montgomery National Historic Trail, and the Trail of Tears National Historic Trail. Natural wonders include the \"Natural Bridge\" rock, the longest natural bridge east of the Rockies, just south of Haleyville; Cathedral Caverns, in Marshall County, named for its cathedral-like appearance, which features one of the largest cave entrances and one of the largest stalagmites in the world; Ecor Rouge, in Fairhope, the highest coastline point between Maine and Mexico;[95] DeSoto Caverns, in Childersburg, the first officially recorded cave in the United States;[96] Noccalula Falls, in Gadsden, which has a 90-foot waterfall; Dismals Canyon, near Phil Campbell, which is home to two waterfalls and six natural bridges and is said to have been a hideout of Jesse James;[97] Stephens Gap Cave, in Jackson County, which has a 143-foot pit and two waterfalls and is one of the most photographed wild cave scenes in America;[98] Little River Canyon, near Fort Payne, one of the nation's longest mountaintop rivers; Rickwood Caverns, near Warrior, which has an underground pool, blind cave-fish, and 260-million-year-old limestone formations; and the Walls of Jericho canyon, on the Alabama–Tennessee border. A 5-mile (8 km)-wide meteorite impact crater is located in Elmore County, just north of Montgomery. This is the Wetumpka crater, the site of \"Alabama's greatest natural disaster\". A 1,000-foot (300 m)-wide meteorite hit the area about 80 million years ago.[99] The hills just east of downtown Wetumpka showcase the eroded remains of the impact crater that was blasted into the bedrock, with the area labeled the Wetumpka crater or astrobleme (\"star-wound\") because of the concentric rings of fractures and zones of shattered rock that can be found beneath the surface.[100] In 2002, Christian Koeberl with the Institute of Geochemistry University of Vienna published evidence and established the site as the 157th recognized impact crater on Earth.[101] The state is classified as humid subtropical (Cfa) under the Köppen climate classification.[102] The average annual temperature is 64 °F (18 °C). Temperatures tend to be warmer in the southern part of the state with its proximity to the Gulf of Mexico, while the northern parts of the state, especially in the Appalachian Mountains in the northeast, tend to be slightly cooler.[103] Generally, Alabama has very hot summers and mild winters with copious precipitation throughout the year. Alabama receives an average of 56 inches (1,400 mm) of rainfall annually and enjoys a lengthy growing season of up to 300 days in the southern part of the state.[103] Summers in Alabama are among the hottest in the U.S., with high temperatures averaging over 90 °F (32 °C) throughout the summer in some parts of the state. Alabama is also prone to tropical storms and hurricanes. Areas of the state far away from the Gulf are not immune to the effects of the storms, which often dump tremendous amounts of rain as they move inland and weaken. South Alabama reports many thunderstorms. The Gulf Coast, around Mobile Bay, averages between 70 and 80 days per year with thunder reported. This activity decreases somewhat further north in the state, but even the far north of the state reports thunder on about 60 days per year. Occasionally, thunderstorms are severe with frequent lightning and large hail; the central and northern parts of the state are most vulnerable to this type of storm. Alabama ranks ninth in the number of deaths from lightning and tenth in the number of deaths from lightning strikes per capita.[104] Alabama, along with Oklahoma and Iowa, has the most confirmed F5 and EF5 tornadoes of any state, according to statistics from the National Climatic Data Center for the period January 1, 1950, to June 2013.[105] Several long-tracked F5/EF5 tornadoes have contributed to Alabama reporting more tornado fatalities since 1950 than any other state. The state was affected by the 1974 Super Outbreak and was devastated tremendously by the 2011 Super Outbreak. The 2011 Super Outbreak produced a record amount of tornadoes in the state. The tally reached 62.[106] The peak season for tornadoes varies from the northern to southern parts of the state. Alabama is one of the few places in the world that has a secondary tornado season in November and December besides the typically severe spring. The northern part—along the Tennessee River Valley—is most vulnerable. The area of Alabama and Mississippi most affected by tornadoes is sometimes referred to as Dixie Alley, as distinct from the Tornado Alley of the Southern Plains. Winters are generally mild in Alabama, as they are throughout most of the Southeastern United States, with average January low temperatures around 40 °F (4 °C) in Mobile and around 32 °F (0 °C) in Birmingham. Although snow is a rare event in much of Alabama, areas of the state north of Montgomery may receive a dusting of snow a few times every winter, with an occasional moderately heavy snowfall every few years. Historic snowfall events include New Year's Eve 1963 snowstorm and the 1993 Storm of the Century. The annual average snowfall for the Birmingham area is 2 inches (51 mm) per year. In the southern Gulf coast, snowfall is less frequent, sometimes going several years without any snowfall. Alabama's highest temperature of 112 °F (44 °C) was recorded on September 5, 1925, in the unincorporated community of Centerville. The record low of −27 °F (−33 °C) occurred on January 30, 1966, in New Market.[107] Alabama is home to a diverse array of flora and fauna in habitats that range from the Tennessee Valley, Appalachian Plateau, and Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians of the north to the Piedmont, Canebrake, and Black Belt of the central region to the Gulf Coastal Plain and beaches along the Gulf of Mexico in the south. The state is usually ranked among the top in nation for its range of overall biodiversity.[112][113] Alabama is in the subtropical coniferous forest biome and once boasted huge expanses of pine forest, which still form the largest proportion of forests in the state.[112] It currently ranks fifth in the nation for the diversity of its flora. It is home to nearly 4,000 pteridophyte and spermatophyte plant species.[114] Indigenous animal species in the state include 62 mammal species,[115] 93 reptile species,[116] 73 amphibian species,[117] roughly 307 native freshwater fish species,[112] and 420 bird species that spend at least part of their year within the state.[118] Invertebrates include 97 crayfish species and 383 mollusk species. 113 of these mollusk species have never been collected outside the state.[119][120] As of 2010, the state contains 461 municipalities, consisting of 174 cities and 287 towns. Covering only 9.6% of Alabama's land mass, its municipalities are home to 60.4% of its population. Montgomery, the state's capital, is the third-most populous settlement in Alabama; and the most populous city is Huntsville. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the state contains 12 metropolitan statistical areas. Alabama's largest metropolitan area was Greater Birmingham. At the 1800 United States census, Alabama had a population of 1,250 people. Since then, the state has continued to experience population growth with every U.S. census. According to the 2020 United States census the population of Alabama was 5,024,279, which represents an increase of 244,543 or 5.12%, since the 2010 census.[123] This includes a natural increase since the last census of 121,054 (502,457 births minus 381,403 deaths) and an increase due to net migration of 104,991 into the state.[124] According to statistics from 2012, immigration from outside the U.S. resulted in a net increase of 31,180 people, and migration within the country produced a net gain of 73,811 people.[124] The state had 108,000 foreign-born residents (2.4% of the state population), of which an estimated 22.2% were undocumented (24,000). The top countries of origin for immigrants were Mexico, China, India, Germany and Guatemala as of 2018.[125] According to HUD's 2022 Annual Homeless Assessment Report, there were an estimated 3,752 homeless people in Alabama.[126][127] With a population density of 99.2 people per square mile as of 2020,[128] the majority of the state's population lives in North, Central, and South Alabama, spread throughout the Huntsville, Birmingham, Montgomery and Mobile metropolitan statistical areas. The center of population of Alabama is located in Chilton County, outside the town of Jemison.[129] Many American Indian tribes such as the Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, and Coushatta inhabited present-day Alabama before European colonization.[33] With Spanish, French, and British colonization of Alabama, white and black Americans migrated to the area. From European colonization to U.S. statehood, Alabama's population grew to become increasingly non-Hispanic white and African American. By the 2020 census, Alabama's total racial and ethnic population was 66.5% non-Hispanic white and 26.9% African American, with a growing Hispanic and Latino population of 5.3%.[130] Alabamans citing \"American\" ancestry are of overwhelmingly English extraction. Demographers estimate that a minimum of 20–23% of people in Alabama are of predominantly English ancestry and state that the figure is probably much higher. In the 1980 census, 1,139,976 people in Alabama cited that they were of English ancestry out of a total state population of 2,824,719 making them 41% of the state at the time and the largest ethnic group.[131][132][133] Alabama has the 5th-highest black and African American population among U.S. states at 25.8% alone as of 2020.[134] In 2011, 46.6% of Alabama's population younger than age 1 were minorities.[135] The largest reported ancestry groups in Alabama were American (13.4%), Irish (10.5%), English (10.2%), German (7.9%), and Scots-Irish (2.5%) based on 2006–2008 U.S. census data.[136] The Scots-Irish were the largest non-English immigrant group from the British Isles before the American Revolution, and many settled in the South, later moving into the Deep South as it was developed.[137] In 1984, under the Davis–Strong Act, the state legislature established the Alabama Indian Affairs Commission.[138] Indigenous groups within the state had increasingly been demanding recognition as ethnic groups and seeking an end to discrimination. Given the long history of slavery and associated racial segregation, the Native American or American Indian peoples, who have sometimes been of mixed race, have insisted on having their cultural identification respected. In the past, their self-identification was often overlooked as the state tried to impose a binary breakdown of society into white and black. The state has officially recognized nine American Indian tribes in the state, descended mostly from the Five Civilized Tribes of the American Southeast. These are the following.[139] The state government has promoted recognition of American Indian contributions to the state, including the designation in 2000 for Columbus Day to be jointly celebrated as American Indian Heritage Day.[140] In 2020, 33,625 identified as being Native American alone, and 97,405 did in combination with one or more other races.[141] According to the 2022 American Community Survey's estimates, approximately 94% of Alabamans speak English as their sole language, while 6% spoke a language other than English.[142] Of other languages, the majority of its multilingual population speaks Spanish (3.8%). In a separate 2021 study by the American University Washington College of Law, Spanish was spoken by 156,656 residents.[143] Following, Korean, Vietnamese, Mandarin and Cantonese, German, French, and Tagalog were the most-spoken languages; among its French-speaking population, the majority have preserved their language since French colonization.[144] Pre-colonial and present-day Alabamans have adhered to multiple religions including Native American and African diaspora religions, and predominantly Christianity with the establishment of Spanish missions in Florida. Other faiths including Judaism, Islam, and Indian religions were introduced since European colonization and American settlement. According to a 2023 Public Religion Research Institute survey, an estimated 80% of the adult population were Christian.[145] In the 2008 American Religious Identification Survey, 86% of Alabama respondents reported their religion as Christian, including 6% Catholic, with 11% as having no religion.[146] The composition of other traditions is 0.5% Mormon, 0.5% Jewish, 0.5% Muslim, 0.5% Buddhist, and 0.5% Hindu.[147] Alabama is located in the middle of the Bible Belt, a region of numerous Protestant Christians. Alabama has been identified as one of the most religious states in the United States, with about 58% of the population attending church regularly.[148] A majority of people in the state identify as Evangelical Protestant. As of 2010[update], the three largest denominational groups in Alabama are the Southern Baptist Convention, The United Methodist Church, and non-denominational Evangelical Protestant.[149] In Alabama, the Southern Baptist Convention has the highest number of adherents with 1,380,121; this is followed by the United Methodist Church with 327,734 adherents, non-denominational Evangelical Protestant with 220,938 adherents, and the Catholic Church with 150,647 adherents. Many Baptist and Methodist congregations became established in the Great Awakening of the early 19th century, when preachers proselytized across the South. The Assemblies of God had almost 60,000 members, the Churches of Christ had nearly 120,000 members. The Presbyterian churches, strongly associated with Scots-Irish immigrants of the 18th century and their descendants, had a combined membership around 75,000 (PCA—28,009 members in 108 congregations, PC(USA)—26,247 members in 147 congregations,[150] the Cumberland Presbyterian Church—6,000 members in 59 congregations, the Cumberland Presbyterian Church in America—5,000 members and fifty congregations plus the EPC and Associate Reformed Presbyterians with 230 members and nine congregations).[151] In a 2007 survey, nearly 70% of respondents could name all four of the Christian Gospels. Of those who indicated a religious preference, 59% said they possessed a \"full understanding\" of their faith and needed no further learning.[152] In a 2007 poll, 92% of Alabamians reported having at least some confidence in churches in the state.[153][154] Although in much smaller numbers, many other religious faiths are represented in the state as well, including Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, the Baháʼí Faith, and Unitarian Universalism.[151] Jews have been present in what is now Alabama since 1763, during the colonial era of Mobile, when Sephardic Jews immigrated from London.[155] The oldest Jewish congregation in the state is Congregation Sha'arai Shomayim in Mobile. It was formally recognized by the state legislature on January 25, 1844.[155] Later immigrants in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries tended to be Ashkenazi Jews from eastern Europe. Jewish denominations in the state include two Orthodox, four Conservative, ten Reform, and one Humanistic synagogue.[156] Muslims have been increasing in Alabama, with 31 mosques built by 2011, many by African-American converts.[157] Several Hindu temples and cultural centers in the state have been founded by Indian immigrants and their descendants, the best-known being the Shri Swaminarayan Mandir in Birmingham, the Hindu Temple and Cultural Center of Birmingham in Pelham, the Hindu Cultural Center of North Alabama in Capshaw, and the Hindu Mandir and Cultural Center in Tuscaloosa.[158][159] There are six Dharma centers and organizations for Theravada Buddhists.[160] Most monastic Buddhist temples are concentrated in southern Mobile County, near Bayou La Batre. This area has attracted an influx of refugees from Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam during the 1970s and thereafter.[161] The four temples within a ten-mile radius of Bayou La Batre, include Chua Chanh Giac, Wat Buddharaksa, and Wat Lao Phoutthavihan.[162][163][164] The first community of adherents of the Baháʼí Faith in Alabama was founded in 1896 by Paul K. Dealy, who moved from Chicago to Fairhope. Baháʼí centers in Alabama exist in Birmingham, Huntsville, and Florence.[165] In 2018, life expectancy in Alabama was 75.1 years, below the national average of 78.7 years and is the third lowest life expectancy in the country. Factors that can cause lower life expectancy are maternal mortality, suicide, and gun crimes.[166] A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study in 2008 showed that obesity in Alabama is a problem, with most counties having more than 29% of adults obese, except for ten which had a rate between 26% and 29%.[167] Residents of the state, along with those in five other states, were least likely in the nation to be physically active during leisure time.[168] Alabama, and the southeastern U.S. in general, has one of the highest incidences of adult onset diabetes in the country, exceeding 10% of adults.[169][170] The state has invested in aerospace, education, health care, banking, and various heavy industries, including automobile manufacturing, mineral extraction, steel production and fabrication. By 2006, crop and animal production in Alabama was valued at $1.5 billion. In contrast to the primarily agricultural economy of the previous century, this was only about one percent of the state's gross domestic product. The number of private farms has declined at a steady rate since the 1960s, as land has been sold to developers, timber companies, and large farming conglomerates.[171] Non-agricultural employment in 2008 was 121,800 in management occupations; 71,750 in business and financial operations; 36,790 in computer-related and mathematical occupation; 44,200 in architecture and engineering; 12,410 in life, physical, and social sciences; 32,260 in community and social services; 12,770 in legal occupations; 116,250 in education, training, and library services; 27,840 in art, design and media occupations; 121,110 in healthcare; 44,750 in fire fighting, law enforcement, and security; 154,040 in food preparation and serving; 76,650 in building and grounds cleaning and maintenance; 53,230 in personal care and services; 244,510 in sales; 338,760 in office and administration support; 20,510 in farming, fishing, and forestry; 120,155 in construction and mining, gas, and oil extraction; 106,280 in installation, maintenance, and repair; 224,110 in production; and 167,160 in transportation and material moving.[16] According to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, the 2008 total gross state product was $170 billion, or $29,411 per capita. Alabama's 2012 GDP increased 1.2% from the previous year. The single largest increase came in the area of information.[172] In 2010, per capita income for the state was $22,984.[128] The state's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 5.8% in April 2015.[173] This compared to a nationwide seasonally adjusted rate of 5.4%.[174] Alabama has no minimum wage and in February 2016 passed legislation preventing municipalities from setting one. (A Birmingham city ordinance would have raised theirs to $10.10.)[175] As of 2018[update], Alabama has the sixth highest poverty rate among states in the U.S.[176] In 2017, United Nations Special Rapporteur Philip Alston toured parts of rural Alabama and observed environmental conditions he said were poorer than anywhere he had seen in the developed world.[177] The five employers that employed the most employees in Alabama in April 2011 were:[178] The next twenty largest employers, as of 2011[update], included:[179] Alabama's agricultural outputs include poultry and eggs, cattle, fish, plant nursery items, peanuts, cotton, grains such as corn and sorghum, vegetables, milk, soybeans, and peaches. Although known as \"The Cotton State\", Alabama ranks between eighth and tenth in national cotton production, according to various reports,[180][181] with Texas, Georgia and Mississippi comprising the top three. Aquaculture is a large part of the economy of Alabama.[182] Alabamians began to practice aquaculture in the early 1960s.[183] U.S. farm-raised catfish is the 8th most popular seafood product in America.[184] By 2008, approximately 4,000 people in Alabama were employed by the catfish industry and Alabama produced 132 million pounds of catfish.[182] In 2020, Alabama produced 1⁄3 of the United States' farm-raised catfish.[184] The total 2020 sales of catfish raised in Alabama equaled $307 million but by 2020 the total employment of Alabamians fell to 2,442.[184] From the early 2000s to 2020, the Alabamian catfish industry has declined from 250 farms and 4 processors to 66 farms and 2 processors.[184] Reasons for this decline include increased feed prices, catfish alternatives, COVID-19's impact on restaurant sales, disease, and fish size.[184] Alabama's industrial outputs include iron and steel products (including cast-iron and steel pipe); paper, lumber, and wood products; mining (mostly coal); plastic products; cars and trucks; and apparel. In addition, Alabama produces aerospace and electronic products, mostly in the Huntsville area, the location of NASA's George C. Marshall Space Flight Center and the U.S. Army Materiel Command, headquartered at Redstone Arsenal. A great deal of Alabama's economic growth since the 1990s has been due to the state's expanding automotive manufacturing industry. Located in the state are Honda Manufacturing of Alabama, Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama, Mercedes-Benz U.S. International, and Toyota Motor Manufacturing Alabama, as well as their various suppliers. Since 1993, the automobile industry has generated more than 67,800 new jobs in the state. Alabama currently ranks 4th in the nation for vehicle exports.[185] Automakers accounted for approximately a third of the industrial expansion in the state in 2012.[186] The eight models produced at the state's auto factories totaled combined sales of 74,335 vehicles for 2012. The strongest model sales during this period were the Hyundai Elantra compact car, the Mercedes-Benz GL-Class sport utility vehicle and the Honda Ridgeline sport utility truck.[187] Steel producers Outokumpu, Nucor, SSAB, ThyssenKrupp, and U.S. Steel have facilities in Alabama and employ more than 10,000 people. In May 2007, German steelmaker ThyssenKrupp selected Calvert in Mobile County for a 4.65 billion combined stainless and carbon steel processing facility.[188] ThyssenKrupp's stainless steel division, Inoxum, including the stainless portion of the Calvert plant, was sold to Finnish stainless steel company Outokumpu in 2012.[189] The remaining portion of the ThyssenKrupp plant had final bids submitted by ArcelorMittal and Nippon Steel for $1.6 billion in March 2013. Companhia Siderúrgica Nacional submitted a combined bid for the mill at Calvert, plus a majority stake in the ThyssenKrupp mill in Brazil, for $3.8 billion.[190] In July 2013, the plant was sold to ArcelorMittal and Nippon Steel.[191] The Hunt Refining Company, a subsidiary of Hunt Consolidated, Inc., is based in Tuscaloosa and operates a refinery there. The company also operates terminals in Mobile, Melvin, and Moundville.[192] JVC America, Inc. operates an optical disc replication and packaging plant in Tuscaloosa.[193] The Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company operates a large plant in Gadsden which employs about 1,400 people. It has been in operation since 1929. Construction of an Airbus A320 family aircraft assembly plant in Mobile was formally announced by Airbus CEO Fabrice Brégier from the Mobile Convention Center on July 2, 2012. The plans include a $600 million factory at the Brookley Aeroplex for the assembly of the A319, A320 and A321 aircraft. Construction began in 2013, with plans for it to become operable by 2015 and produce up to 50 aircraft per year by 2017.b[194][195] The assembly plant is the company's first factory to be built within the United States.[196] It was announced on February 1, 2013, that Airbus had hired Alabama-based Hoar Construction to oversee construction of the facility.[197] The factory officially opened on September 14, 2015, covering one million square feet on 53 acres of flat grassland.[198] According to Business Insider, Alabama ranked 14th in most popular states to visit in 2014.[199] An estimated 26 million tourists visited the state in 2017 and spent $14.3 billion, providing directly or indirectly 186,900 jobs in the state,[200] which includes 362,000 International tourists spending $589 million.[201] The state is home to various attractions, natural features, parks and events that attract visitors from around the globe, notably the annual Hangout Music Festival, held on the public beaches of Gulf Shores; the Alabama Shakespeare Festival, one of the ten largest Shakespeare festivals in the world;[202] the Robert Trent Jones Golf Trail, a collection of championship caliber golf courses distributed across the state; casinos such as Victoryland; amusement parks such as Alabama Splash Adventure; the Riverchase Galleria, one of the largest shopping centers in the southeast; Guntersville Lake, voted the best lake in Alabama by Southern Living Magazine readers;[203] and the Alabama Museum of Natural History, the oldest museum in the state.[204] Mobile is known for having the oldest organized Mardi Gras celebration in the United States, beginning in 1703.[205] It was also host to the first formally organized Mardi Gras parade in the U.S. in 1830, a tradition that continues to this day.[205] Mardi Gras is an official state holiday in Mobile and Baldwin counties.[206] In 2018, Mobile's Mardi Gras parade was the state's top event, producing the most tourists with an attendance of 892,811. The top attraction was the U.S. Space & Rocket Center in Huntsville with an attendance of 849,981, followed by the Birmingham Zoo with 543,090. Of the parks and natural destinations, Alabama's Gulf Coast topped the list with 6,700,000 visitors.[207] Alabama has historically been a popular region for film shoots due to its diverse landscapes and contrast of environments.[208] Movies filmed in Alabama include Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Get Out, 42, Selma, Big Fish, The Final Destination, Due Date, and Need for Speed.[209] UAB Hospital, USA Health University Hospital, Huntsville Hospital, and Children's Hospital of Alabama are the only Level I trauma centers in Alabama.[210] UAB is the largest state government employer in Alabama, with a workforce of about 18,000.[211] A 2017 study found that Alabama had the least competitive health insurance market in the country, with Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Alabama having a market share of 84% followed by UnitedHealth Group at 7%.[212] Regions Financial Corporation is the largest bank headquartered in or operating in Alabama. PNC Financial Services and Wells Fargo also have a major presence in Alabama.[213] Wells Fargo has a regional headquarters, an operations center campus, and a $400 million data center in Birmingham. Many smaller banks are also headquartered in the Birmingham area, including ServisFirst and New South Federal Savings Bank. Birmingham also serves as the headquarters for several large investment management companies, including Harbert Management Corporation. Telecommunications provider AT&T, formerly BellSouth, has a major presence in Alabama with several large offices in Birmingham. Many technology companies are headquartered in Huntsville, such as ADTRAN, a network access company; Intergraph, a computer graphics company; and Avocent, an IT infrastructure company. Brasfield & Gorrie, BE&K, Hoar Construction, and B.L. Harbert International, based in Alabama and subsidiaries of URS Corporation, are all routinely are included in the Engineering News-Record lists of top design, international construction, and engineering firms. The foundational document for Alabama's government is the Alabama Constitution, the current one having been adopted in 2022. The former Alabama constitution adopted in 1901 was, with over 850 amendments and almost 87,000 words, by some accounts the world's longest constitution and roughly forty times the length of the United States Constitution.[214][215][216][217] There has been a significant movement to rewrite and modernize Alabama's constitution.[218] Critics have argued that Alabama's constitution maintains highly centralized power with the state legislature, leaving practically no power in local hands. Most counties do not have home rule. Any policy changes proposed in different areas of the state must be approved by the entire Alabama legislature and, frequently, by state referendum. The former constitution was particularly criticized for its complexity and length intentionally codifying segregation and racism. Alabama's government is divided into three coequal branches. The legislative branch is the Alabama Legislature, a bicameral assembly composed of the Alabama House of Representatives, with 105 members, and the Alabama Senate, with 35 members. The Legislature is responsible for writing, debating, passing, or defeating state legislation. The Republican Party currently holds a majority in both houses of the Legislature. The Legislature has the power to override a gubernatorial veto by a simple majority (most state Legislatures require a two-thirds majority to override a veto). Until 1964, the state elected state senators on a geographic basis by county, with one per county. It had not redistricted congressional districts since passage of its constitution in 1901; as a result, urbanized areas were grossly underrepresented. It had not changed legislative districts to reflect the decennial censuses, either. In Reynolds v. Sims (1964), the U.S. Supreme Court implemented the principle of \"one man, one vote\", ruling that congressional districts had to be reapportioned based on censuses (as the state already included in its constitution but had not implemented.) Further, the court ruled that both houses of bicameral state legislatures had to be apportioned by population, as there was no constitutional basis for states to have geographically based systems. At that time, Alabama and many other states had to change their legislative districting, as many across the country had systems that underrepresented urban areas and districts. This had caused decades of underinvestment in such areas. For instance, Birmingham and Jefferson County taxes had supplied one-third of the state budget, but Jefferson County received only 1/67th of state services in funding. Through the legislative delegations, the Alabama legislature kept control of county governments. The executive branch is responsible for the execution and oversight of laws. It is headed by the governor of Alabama. Other members of the executive branch include the cabinet, the lieutenant governor of Alabama, the Attorney General of Alabama, the Alabama Secretary of State, the Alabama State Treasurer, and the State Auditor of Alabama. The current governor is Republican Kay Ivey. The members of the Legislature take office immediately after the November elections. Statewide officials, such as the governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general, and other constitutional officers, take office the following January.[219] The judiciary is responsible for interpreting the Constitution of Alabama and applying the law in state criminal and civil cases. The state's highest court is the Supreme Court of Alabama. Alabama uses partisan elections to select judges. Since the 1980s judicial campaigns have become increasingly politicized.[220] The current chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court is Republican Tom Parker. All sitting justices on the Alabama Supreme Court are members of the Republican Party. There are two intermediate appellate courts, the Court of Civil Appeals and the Court of Criminal Appeals, and four trial courts: the circuit court (trial court of general jurisdiction), and the district, probate, and municipal courts.[220] Alabama has the death penalty with authorized methods of execution that include the electric chair and the gas chamber.[221] Some critics believe the election of judges has contributed to an exceedingly high rate of executions.[222] Alabama has the highest per capita death penalty rate in the country. In some years, it imposes more death sentences than does Texas, a state which has a population five times larger.[223] However, executions per capita are significantly higher in Texas.[224] Some of its cases have been highly controversial; the U.S. Supreme Court has overturned[225] 24 convictions in death penalty cases.[citation needed] It was the only state to allow judges to override jury decisions in whether or not to use a death sentence; in 10 cases judges overturned sentences of life imprisonment without parole that were voted unanimously by juries.[223] This judicial authority was removed in April 2017.[226] On May 14, 2019, Alabama passed the Human Life Protection Act, banning abortion at any stage of pregnancy unless there is a \"serious health risk\", with no exceptions for rape and incest. The law subjects doctors who perform abortions with 10 to 99 years imprisonment.[227] The law was originally supposed to take effect the following November, but on October 29, 2019, U.S. District Judge Myron Thompson blocked the law from taking effect due to it being in conflict with the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court case Roe v. Wade.[228] On June 24, 2022, after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, Judge Thompson lifted the injunction, allowing the law to go into effect.[229] Alabama is one of the few states that does not allow the creation of state lotteries.[230] Taxes are collected by the Alabama Department of Revenue.[231] Alabama levies a 2%, 4%, or 5% personal income tax, depending on the amount earned and filing status.[232] Taxpayers are allowed to deduct their federal income tax from their Alabama state tax, even if taking the standard deduction; those who itemize can also deduct FICA (the Social Security and Medicare tax).[233] The state's general sales tax rate is 4%.[234] Sales tax rates for cities and counties are also added to purchases.[235] For example, the total sales tax rate in Mobile County, Alabama is 10% and there is an additional restaurant tax of 1%, which means a diner in Mobile County, Alabama would pay an 11% tax on a meal. In 2020, sales and excise taxes in Alabama accounted for 38% of all state and local revenue.[236] Only Alabama, Mississippi, and South Dakota tax groceries at the full state sales tax rate.[237] The corporate income tax rate in Alabama is 6.5%. The overall federal, state, and local tax burden in Alabama ranks the state as the second least tax-burdened state in the country.[238] Property taxes of .40% of assessed value per year, are the second-lowest in the U.S., after Hawaii.[239] The state constitution currently requires a voter referendum to raise property taxes. Historically, an Alabama excise tax \"on the storage, use or other consumption in this state of tangible personal property purchased at retail for storage, use or other consumption in this state\" was the focus of a 1941 U S Supreme Court ruling, Curry v United States.[240] Alabama has 67 counties. Each county has its own elected legislative branch, usually called the county commission. It also has limited executive authority in the county. Because of the constraints of the Alabama Constitution, which centralizes power in the state legislature, only seven counties (Jefferson, Lee, Mobile, Madison, Montgomery, Shelby, and Tuscaloosa) in the state have limited home rule. Instead, most counties in the state must lobby the Local Legislation Committee of the state legislature to get simple local policies approved, ranging from waste disposal to land use zoning. The state legislature has retained power over local governments by refusing to pass a constitutional amendment establishing home rule for counties, as recommended by the 1973 Alabama Constitutional Commission.[241] Legislative delegations retain certain powers over each county. United States Supreme Court decisions in Baker v. Carr (1964) required that both houses have districts established on the basis of population, and redistricted after each census, to implement the principle of \"one man, one vote\". Before that, each county was represented by one state senator, leading to under-representation in the state senate for more urbanized, populous counties. The rural bias of the state legislature, which had also failed to redistrict seats in the state house, affected politics well into the 20th century, failing to recognize the rise of industrial cities and urbanized areas. \"The lack of home rule for counties in Alabama has resulted in the proliferation of local legislation permitting counties to do things not authorized by the state constitution. Alabama's constitution has been amended more than 700 times, and almost one-third of the amendments are local in nature, applying to only one county or city. A significant part of each legislative session is spent on local legislation, taking away time and attention of legislators from issues of statewide importance.\"[241] Alabama is an alcoholic beverage control state, meaning the state government holds a monopoly on the sale of alcohol. The Alabama Alcoholic Beverage Control Board controls the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages in the state. A total of 25 of the 67 counties are \"dry counties\" which ban the sale of alcohol, and there are many dry municipalities in counties which permit alcohol sales.[242] During Reconstruction following the American Civil War, Alabama was occupied by federal troops of the Third Military District under General John Pope. In 1874, the political coalition of white Democrats known as the Redeemers took control of the state government from the Republicans, in part by suppressing the black vote through violence, fraud, and intimidation. After 1890, a coalition of White Democratic politicians passed laws to segregate and disenfranchise African American residents, a process completed in provisions of the 1901 constitution. Provisions which disenfranchised blacks resulted in excluding many poor Whites. By 1941 more Whites than Blacks had been disenfranchised: 600,000 to 520,000. The total effects were greater on the black community, as almost all its citizens were disfranchised and relegated to separate and unequal treatment under the law. From 1901 through the 1960s, the state did not redraw election districts as population grew and shifted within the state during urbanization and industrialization of certain areas. As counties were the basis of election districts, the result was a rural minority that dominated state politics through nearly three-quarters of the century, until a series of federal court cases required redistricting in 1972 to meet equal representation. Alabama state politics gained nationwide and international attention in the 1950s and 1960s during the civil rights movement, when whites bureaucratically, and at times violently, resisted protests for electoral and social reform. Governor George Wallace, the state's only four-term governor, was a controversial figure who vowed to maintain segregation. Only after passage of the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964[77] and Voting Rights Act of 1965 did African Americans regain the ability to exercise suffrage, among other civil rights. In many jurisdictions, they continued to be excluded from representation by at-large electoral systems, which allowed the majority of the population to dominate elections. Some changes at the county level have occurred following court challenges to establish single-member districts that enable a more diverse representation among county boards. In 2007, the Alabama Legislature passed, and Republican governor Bob Riley signed a resolution expressing \"profound regret\" over slavery and its lingering impact. In a symbolic ceremony, the bill was signed in the Alabama State Capitol, which housed Congress of the Confederate States of America.[243] In 2010, Republicans won control of both houses of the legislature for the first time in 136 years.[244] As of February 2023[update], there are a total of 3,707,233 registered voters, with 3,318,679 active, and the others inactive in the state.[245] The 2023 American Values Atlas by Public Religion Research Institute found that a majority of Alabama residents support same-sex marriage.[246] With the disfranchisement of Blacks in 1901, the state became part of the \"Solid South\", a system in which the Democratic Party operated as effectively the only viable political party in every Southern state. For nearly a hundred years local and state elections in Alabama were decided in the Democratic Party primary, with generally only token Republican challengers running in the general election. Since the mid- to late 20th century, however, white conservatives started shifting to the Republican Party. In Alabama, majority-white districts are now expected to regularly elect Republican candidates to federal, state and local office. Members of the nine seats on the Supreme Court of Alabama[247] and all ten seats on the state appellate courts are elected to office. Until 1994, no Republicans held any of the court seats. In that general election, the then-incumbent chief justice, Ernest C. Hornsby, refused to leave office after losing the election by approximately 3,000 votes to Republican Perry O. Hooper Sr.[248] Hornsby sued Alabama and defiantly remained in office for nearly a year before finally giving up the seat after losing in court.[249] The Democrats lost the last of the nineteen court seats in August 2011 with the resignation of the last Democrat on the bench. In the early 21st century, Republicans hold all seven of the statewide elected executive branch offices. Republicans hold six of the eight elected seats on the Alabama State Board of Education. In 2010, Republicans took large majorities of both chambers of the state legislature, giving them control of that body for the first time in 136 years. The last remaining statewide Democrat, who served on the Alabama Public Service Commission, was defeated in 2012.[250][251][252] Only three Republican lieutenant governors have been elected since the end of Reconstruction, when Republicans generally represented Reconstruction government, including the newly emancipated freedmen who had gained the franchise. The three GOP lieutenant governors are Steve Windom (1999–2003), Kay Ivey (2011–2017), and Will Ainsworth (2019–present). Many local offices (county commissioners, boards of education, tax assessors, mayors, etc.) in the state are still held by Democrats.[253][254] Many metropolitan and suburban counties have voters who are majority Democrats, resulting in local elections being decided in the Democratic primary. Similarly most rural counties are majority-Republican and elections are effectively decided in the Republican Primary. However, since local governments in Alabama are weaker than in other parts of the country, Republicans have the upper hand in government. Alabama's 67 county sheriffs are elected in partisan, at-large races, and Republicans retain the vast majority of those posts. The current split is 18 Democrats, and 49 Republicans as of 2023. However, most of the Democratic sheriffs preside over urban and more populated counties. The majority of Republican sheriffs have been elected in the more rural counties with lower population. The state of Alabama has and 11 African-American sheriffs.[255] The state's two U.S. senators are Katie Britt and Tommy Tuberville, both of whom are Republican. In the U.S. House of Representatives, the state is represented by seven members, six of whom are Republicans (Jerry Carl, Mike Rogers, Robert Aderholt, Dale Strong, Barry Moore, and Gary Palmer) and one Democrat Terri Sewell, who represents the Black Belt as well as most of the predominantly black portions of Birmingham, Tuscaloosa and Montgomery. Public primary and secondary education in Alabama is under the purview of the Alabama State Board of Education as well as local oversight by 67 county school boards and 60 city boards of education. Together, 1,496 individual schools provide education for 744,637 elementary and secondary students.[256] Public school funding is appropriated through the Alabama Legislature through the Education Trust Fund. In FY 2006–2007, Alabama appropriated $3,775,163,578 for primary and secondary education. That represented an increase of $444,736,387 over the previous fiscal year. In 2007, more than 82 percent of schools made adequate yearly progress (AYP) toward student proficiency under the National No Child Left Behind law, using measures determined by the state of Alabama. While Alabama's public education system has improved in recent decades, it lags behind in achievement compared to other states. According to U.S. Census data (2000), Alabama's high school graduation rate (75%) is the fourth lowest in the U.S. (after Kentucky, Louisiana and Mississippi).[257] The largest educational gains were among people with some college education but without degrees.[258] According to National Assessment of Educational Progress (NEAP), Alabama ranks 39 in reading and 40 in math among fourth-grade students in the rankings from 2022.[259] Generally prohibited in the West at large, school corporal punishment is not unusual in Alabama, with 27,260 public school students paddled at least one time, according to government data for the 2011–2012 school year.[c][260] The rate of school corporal punishment in Alabama is surpassed by only Mississippi and Arkansas.[260] Alabama's programs of higher education include 14 four-year public universities, two-year community colleges, and 17 private, undergraduate and graduate universities. In the state are four medical schools (as of fall 2015) UAB Heersink School of Medicine, University of South Alabama and Alabama College of Osteopathic Medicine and The Edward Via College of Osteopathic Medicine—Auburn Campus), two veterinary colleges (Auburn University and Tuskegee University), a dental school (UAB School of Dentistry, an optometry college (UAB School of Optometry), two pharmacy schools (Auburn University and Samford University), and five law schools (University of Alabama School of Law, Birmingham School of Law, Cumberland School of Law, Miles Law School, and the Thomas Goode Jones School of Law). Public, post-secondary education in Alabama is overseen by the Alabama Commission on Higher Education and the Alabama Department of Postsecondary Education. Colleges and universities in Alabama offer degree programs from two-year associate degrees to a multitude of doctoral level programs.[261] The largest single campus is the University of Alabama, located in Tuscaloosa, with 37,665 enrolled for fall 2016.[262] Troy University was the largest institution in the state in 2010, with an enrollment of 29,689 students across four Alabama campuses (Troy, Dothan, Montgomery, and Phenix City), as well as sixty learning sites in seventeen other states and eleven other countries. The oldest institutions are the public University of North Alabama in Florence and the Catholic Church-affiliated Spring Hill College in Mobile, both founded in 1830.[263][264] Accreditation of academic programs is through the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) as well as other subject-focused national and international accreditation agencies such as the Association for Biblical Higher Education (ABHE),[265] the Council on Occupational Education (COE),[266] and the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools (ACICS).[267] According to the 2024 U.S. News & World Report, Alabama had three universities ranked in the top 100 Public Schools in America (Auburn University at 47, University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) at 76, and University of Alabama at 91).[268] According to the 2024 U.S. News & World Report, Alabama had four tier one universities (Auburn University, University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), University of Alabama and University of Alabama in Huntsville).[269] Major newspapers include Birmingham News, Mobile Press-Register, and Montgomery Advertiser.[270] Major television network affiliates in Alabama include: Alabama literature is characterized by themes of race and issues of gender and war, and is influenced by events such as the American Civil War, the Reconstruction era, the Civil Rights Movement, and the Vietnam War. Some notable examples of Alabama literature include Harper Lee's To Kill A Mockingbird, Winston Groom's Forrest Gump, Fannie Flagg's Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistlestop Cafe, and the biographies of Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr. Alabama has several professional and semi-professional sports teams, including three minor league baseball teams. The Talladega Superspeedway motorsports complex hosts a series of NASCAR events. It has a seating capacity of 143,000 and is the thirteenth largest stadium in the world and sixth largest stadium in America. Also, the Barber Motorsports Park has hosted IndyCar Series and Rolex Sports Car Series races. The ATP Birmingham was a World Championship Tennis tournament held from 1973 to 1980. Alabama has hosted several professional golf tournaments, such as the 1984 and 1990 PGA Championship at Shoal Creek, the Barbasol Championship (PGA Tour), the Mobile LPGA Tournament of Champions, Airbus LPGA Classic, and Yokohama Tire LPGA Classic (LPGA Tour), and The Tradition (Champions Tour). College football is extremely popular in Alabama, particularly the University of Alabama Crimson Tide and Auburn University Tigers, rivals in the Southeastern Conference. Alabama averages over 100,000 fans per game and Auburn averages over 80,000—both numbers among the top twenty in the nation.[272] Bryant–Denny Stadium is the home of the Alabama football team, and has a seating capacity of 101,821,[273] and is the fifth largest stadium in America.[274] Jordan-Hare Stadium is the home field of the Auburn football team and seats up to 87,451.[275] Protective Stadium is home of the UAB Blazers football program and the Birmingham Bowl. It seats 45,000.[276] Ladd–Peebles Stadium in Mobile is the home of the University of South Alabama football team, and serves as the home of the NCAA Senior Bowl, LendingTree Bowl, and Alabama-Mississippi All Star Classic; the stadium seats 40,646.[277] In 2009, Bryant–Denny Stadium and Jordan-Hare Stadium became the homes of the Alabama High School Athletic Association state football championship games, after previously being held at Legion Field in Birmingham.[278] Major airports with sustained operations in Alabama include Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport (BHM), Huntsville International Airport (HSV), Dothan Regional Airport (DHN), Mobile Regional Airport (MOB), Montgomery Regional Airport (MGM), Northwest Alabama Regional Airport (MSL) and Northeast Alabama Regional Airport (GAD). For rail transport, Amtrak schedules the Crescent, a daily passenger train, running from New York to New Orleans with station stops at Anniston, Birmingham, and Tuscaloosa. Alabama has six major interstate routes: Interstate 65 (I-65) travels north–south roughly through the middle of the state; I-20/I-59 travel from the central west Mississippi state line to Birmingham, where I-59 continues to the north-east corner of the state and I-20 continues east towards Atlanta; I-85 originates in Montgomery and travels east-northeast to the Georgia state line, providing a main thoroughfare to Atlanta; and I-10 traverses the southernmost portion of the state, traveling from west to east through Mobile. I-22 enters the state from Mississippi and connects Birmingham with Memphis, Tennessee. In addition, there are currently five auxiliary interstate routes in the state: I-165 in Mobile, I-359 in Tuscaloosa, I-459 around Birmingham, I-565 in Decatur and Huntsville, and I-759 in Gadsden. A sixth route, I-685, will be formed when I-85 is rerouted along a new southern bypass of Montgomery. A proposed northern bypass of Birmingham will be designated as I-422. Since a direct connection from I-22 to I-422 will not be possible, I-222 has been proposed, as well. Several U.S. Highways also pass through the state, such as U.S. Route 11 (US-11), US-29, US-31, US-43, US-45, US-72, US-78, US-80, US-82, US-84, US-90, US-98, US-231, US-278, US-280, US-331, US-411, and US-431. There are four toll roads in the state: Montgomery Expressway in Montgomery; Northport/Tuscaloosa Western Bypass in Tuscaloosa and Northport; Emerald Mountain Expressway in Wetumpka; and Beach Express in Orange Beach. The Port of Mobile, Alabama's only saltwater port, is a large seaport on the Gulf of Mexico with inland waterway access to the Midwest by way of the Tennessee–Tombigbee Waterway. The Port of Mobile was ranked 12th by tons of traffic in the United States during 2009.[279] The newly expanded container terminal at the Port of Mobile was ranked as the 25th busiest for container traffic in the nation during 2011.[280] The state's other ports are on rivers with access to the Gulf of Mexico.

Pitt was named People's Sexiest Man Alive in 1995 and 2000. William Bradley Pitt was born on December 18, 1963, in Shawnee, Oklahoma, to William Alvin Pitt, the proprietor of a trucking company, and Jane Etta (née Hillhouse), a school counselor.[4] The family soon moved to Springfield, Missouri, where he lived together with his younger siblings, Douglas Pitt (b. 1966) and Julie (née Pitt) Neal (b. 1969).[5] Born into a conservative Christian household,[6][7] he was raised as Southern Baptist and later \"oscillate[d] between agnosticism and atheism.\"[8] He later reconciled his belief in spirituality.[9] Pitt has described Springfield as \"Mark Twain country, Jesse James country,\" having grown up with \"a lot of hills, a lot of lakes.\"[10] Pitt attended Kickapoo High School, where he was a member of the golf, swimming, and tennis teams.[11] He participated in the school's Key and Forensics clubs, in school debates, and in musicals.[12] Following his graduation from high school, Pitt enrolled in the University of Missouri in 1982, majoring in journalism with a focus on advertising.[13] As graduation approached, Pitt did not feel ready to settle down. He loved films—\"a portal into different worlds for me\"—and, since films were not made in Missouri, he decided to go to where they were made.[14][15] Two weeks short of completing the coursework for a degree, Pitt left the university and moved to Los Angeles, where he took acting lessons and worked odd jobs.[14] He has named Gary Oldman, Sean Penn, and Mickey Rourke as his early acting heroes.[16] While struggling to establish himself in Los Angeles, Pitt took lessons from acting coach Roy London.[12][17] His acting career began in 1987, with uncredited parts in the films No Way Out (1987), No Man's Land (1987) and Less than Zero (1987).[12][18] In May 1987, he made his television debut in a two-episode role on the NBC soap opera Another World.[19] In November of the same year, Pitt had a guest appearance on the CBS sitcom Trial and Error[20][21] and the ABC sitcom Growing Pains.[22] He appeared in four episodes of the CBS primetime series Dallas between December 1987 and February 1988 as Randy, the boyfriend of Jenna Wade's daughter Charlotte (played by Shalane McCall).[23] Later in 1988, Pitt made a guest appearance on the Fox police drama 21 Jump Street.[24] In the same year, the Yugoslavian–U.S. co-production The Dark Side of the Sun (1988) was his first leading film role, starring as a young American taken by his family to the Adriatic to find a remedy for a skin condition. The film was shelved at the outbreak of the Croatian War of Independence, and was not released until 1997.[12] Pitt made two motion picture appearances in 1989: the first in a supporting role in the comedy Happy Together; the second a featured role in the horror film Cutting Class, the first of Pitt's films to reach theaters.[22] He made guest appearances on television series Head of the Class, Freddy's Nightmares, Thirtysomething, and (for a second time) Growing Pains.[25] Pitt was cast as Billy Canton, a drug addict who takes advantage of a young runaway (played by Juliette Lewis) in the 1990 NBC television movie Too Young to Die?, the story of an abused teenager sentenced to death for a murder. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly wrote: \"Pitt is a magnificent slimeball as her hoody boyfriend; looking and sounding like a malevolent John Cougar Mellencamp, he's really scary.\"[26] The same year, Pitt co-starred in six episodes of the short-lived Fox drama Glory Days and took a supporting role in the HBO television film The Image.[27] His next appearance came in the 1991 film Across the Tracks; Pitt portrayed Joe Maloney, a high school runner with a criminal brother, played by Rick Schroder.[28] The same year he featured in a Levi's jeans TV commercial based around the song \"20th Century Boy\" which played in the background.[29] After years of supporting roles in film and frequent television guest appearances, Pitt attracted wider recognition in his supporting role in Ridley Scott's 1991 road film Thelma & Louise.[27] He played J.D., a small-time criminal who befriends Thelma (Geena Davis). His love scene with Davis has been cited as the event that defined Pitt as a sex symbol.[22][30] After Thelma & Louise, Pitt starred in the 1991 film Johnny Suede, a low-budget picture about an aspiring rock star,[31] and the 1992 live-action/animated fantasy film Cool World,[22] although neither furthered his career, having poor reviews and box office performance.[32][33] Pitt took on the role of Paul Maclean in the 1992 biographical film A River Runs Through It, directed by Robert Redford.[34] His portrayal of the character was described by People's Janet Mock as a career-making performance,[35] proving that Pitt could be more than a \"cowboy-hatted hunk.\"[36] He has admitted to feeling under pressure when making the film[5] and thought it was one of his \"weakest performances ... It's so weird that it ended up being the one that I got the most attention for.\"[5] Pitt believed that he benefited from working with such a talented cast and crew. He compared working with Redford to playing tennis with a superior player, saying \"when you play with somebody better than you, your game gets better.\"[35][36] In 1993, Pitt reunited with Juliette Lewis for the road film Kalifornia. He played Early Grayce, a serial killer and the abusive husband of Lewis' character, in a performance described by Peter Travers of Rolling Stone as \"outstanding, all boyish charm and then a snort that exudes pure menace.\"[37] Pitt also garnered attention for a brief appearance in the cult hit True Romance as a stoner named Floyd, providing comic relief to the action film.[38] He capped the year by winning a ShoWest Award for Male Star of Tomorrow.[39] In 1994, Pitt portrayed the vampire Louis de Pointe du Lac in the horror film Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles, based on Anne Rice's 1976 novel of the same name.[40] He was part of an ensemble cast that included Tom Cruise, Kirsten Dunst, Christian Slater, and Antonio Banderas.[40] Despite his winning two MTV Movie Awards at the 1995 ceremony,[41] his performance was poorly received. According to the Dallas Observer, \"Brad Pitt [...] is a large part of the problem [in the film]. When directors play up his cocky, hunkish, folksy side [...] he's a joy to watch. But there's nothing about him that suggests inner torment or even self-awareness, which makes him a boring Louis.\"[42] Following the release of Interview with the Vampire, Pitt starred in Legends of the Fall (1994),[43] based on a novel by the same name by Jim Harrison, set in the American West during the first four decades of the twentieth century. Portraying Tristan Ludlow, son of Colonel William Ludlow (Anthony Hopkins) a Cornish immigrant,[44] Pitt received his first Golden Globe Award nomination, in the Best Actor category.[45] Aidan Quinn and Henry Thomas co-starred as Pitt's brothers. Although the film's reception was mixed,[46] many film critics praised Pitt's performance. Janet Maslin of The New York Times said, \"Pitt's diffident mix of acting and attitude works to such heartthrob perfection it's a shame the film's superficiality gets in his way.\"[47] The Deseret News predicted that Legends of the Fall would solidify Pitt's reputation as a lead actor.[48] In 1995, Pitt starred alongside Morgan Freeman, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Kevin Spacey in the crime thriller Seven, playing a detective on the trail of a serial killer who preys on people he considers guilty of the Seven Deadly Sins.[49] Pitt called it a great movie and declared the part would expand his acting horizons.[50] He expressed his intent to move on from \"this 'pretty boy' thing [...] and play someone with flaws.\"[51] His performance was critically well received, with Variety saying that it was screen acting at its best, further remarking on Pitt's ability to turn in a \"determined, energetic, creditable job\" as the detective.[52] Seven earned $327 million at the international box office.[32] Following the success of Seven, Pitt played psychotic anarchist Jeffrey Goines in Terry Gilliam's 1995 science fiction film 12 Monkeys. The movie received predominantly positive reviews, with Pitt praised in particular. Janet Maslin of The New York Times called Twelve Monkeys \"fierce and disturbing\" and remarked on Pitt's \"startlingly frenzied performance\", concluding that he \"electrifies Jeffrey with a weird magnetism that becomes important later in the film.\"[53] He won a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor for the film[45] and received his first Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor.[54] The following year, he appeared in the legal drama Sleepers (1996), based on Lorenzo Carcaterra's novel of the same name.[55] The film received mixed reviews.[56] In the 1997 film The Devil's Own Pitt starred, opposite Harrison Ford, as Irish Republican Army terrorist Rory Devany,[57] a role for which he was required to learn an Irish accent.[58] Critical opinion was divided on his accent; \"Pitt finds the right tone of moral ambiguity, but at times his Irish brogue is too convincing – it's hard to understand what he's saying\", wrote the San Francisco Chronicle.[59] The Charleston Gazette opined that it had favored Pitt's accent over the movie.[60] The Devil's Own grossed $140 million worldwide.[32] Later that year, he led as Austrian mountaineer Heinrich Harrer in the Jean-Jacques Annaud film Seven Years in Tibet.[61] Pitt trained for months for the role, which demanded significant mountain climbing and trekking practice, including rock climbing in California and the European Alps with his co-star David Thewlis.[62] Pitt had the lead role in 1998's fantasy romance film Meet Joe Black. He portrayed a personification of death inhabiting the body of a young man to learn what it is like to be human.[63] The film received mixed reviews, and many were critical of Pitt's performance. According to Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle, Pitt was unable to \"make an audience believe that he knows all the mysteries of death and eternity.\"[64] Roger Ebert remarked, \"Pitt is a fine actor, but this performance is a miscalculation.\"[65] In 1999, Pitt portrayed Tyler Durden in Fight Club,[66][67] a film adaptation of Chuck Palahniuk's novel of the same name, directed by David Fincher.[68] Pitt prepared for the part with lessons in boxing, taekwondo, and grappling.[69] To look the part, Pitt consented to the removal of pieces of his front teeth which were restored when filming ended.[70] While promoting Fight Club, Pitt said that the film explored not taking one's aggressions out on someone else but to \"have an experience, take a punch more and see how you come out on the other end.\"[71] Fight Club premiered at the 1999 Venice International Film Festival.[72] Despite divided critical opinion on the film as a whole,[73][74] Pitt's performance was widely praised. Paul Clinton of CNN noted the risky yet successful nature of the film,[75] while Variety remarked upon Pitt's ability to be \"cool, charismatic and more dynamically physical, perhaps than [...] his breakthrough role in Thelma and Louise\".[76] In spite of a worse-than-expected box office performance, Fight Club became a cult classic after its DVD release in 2000.[77] Pitt was cast as an Irish Traveller boxer with a barely intelligible accent in Guy Ritchie's 2000 gangster film Snatch.[78] Several reviewers were critical of Snatch; however, most praised Pitt.[79] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle said Pitt was \"ideally cast as an Irishman whose accent is so thick even Brits can't understand him\", going on to say that, before Snatch, Pitt had been \"shackled by roles that called for brooding introspection, but recently he has found his calling in black comic outrageousness and flashy extroversion;\"[80] while Amy Taubin of The Village Voice claimed that \"Pitt gets maximum comic mileage out of a one-joke role\".[81] The following year Pitt starred opposite Julia Roberts in the romantic comedy The Mexican,[82] a film that garnered a range of reviews[83] but enjoyed box office success.[32] Pitt's next role, in 2001's $143 million-grossing Cold War thriller Spy Game,[32] was as Tom Bishop, an operative of the CIA's Special Activities Division, mentored by Robert Redford's character.[84] Mark Holcomb of Salon.com enjoyed the film, although he noted that neither Pitt nor Redford provided \"much of an emotional connection for the audience\".[85] On November 22, 2001, Pitt made a guest appearance in the eighth season of the television series Friends, playing a man with a grudge against Rachel Green, played by Jennifer Aniston, to whom Pitt was married at the time.[86] For this performance he was nominated for an Emmy Award in the category of Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series.[87] In December 2001, Pitt played Rusty Ryan in the heist film Ocean's Eleven, a remake of the 1960 Rat Pack original. He joined an ensemble cast including George Clooney, Matt Damon, Andy García, and Julia Roberts.[88] Well received by critics, Ocean's Eleven was highly successful at the box office, earning $450 million worldwide.[32] Pitt appeared in two episodes of MTV's reality series Jackass in February 2002, first running through the streets of Los Angeles with several cast members in gorilla suits,[89] and in a subsequent episode participating in his own staged abduction.[90] In the same year, Pitt had a cameo role in George Clooney's directorial debut Confessions of a Dangerous Mind.[91] He took on his first voice-acting roles in 2003, speaking as the titular character of the DreamWorks animated film Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas[92] and playing Boomhauer's brother, Patch, in an episode of the animated television series King of the Hill.[93] Pitt had two major film roles in 2004, starring as Achilles in Troy, and reprising his role, Rusty Ryan, in the sequel Ocean's Twelve. He spent six months sword training before the filming of Troy, based on the Iliad.[94] An on-set injury to his Achilles tendon delayed production on the picture for several weeks.[95] Stephen Hunter of The Washington Post stated that Pitt excelled at such a demanding role.[96] Troy was the first film produced by Plan B Entertainment, a film production company he had founded two years earlier with Jennifer Aniston and Brad Grey, CEO of Paramount Pictures.[97] Ocean's Twelve earned $362 million worldwide,[32] and Pitt and Clooney's dynamic was described by CNN's Paul Clinton as \"the best male chemistry since Paul Newman and Robert Redford.\"[98] In 2005, Pitt starred as John Smith in the Doug Liman-directed action comedy Mr. & Mrs. Smith, in which a bored married couple discover that each is an assassin sent to kill the other. The feature received reasonable reviews but was generally lauded for the chemistry between Pitt and Angelina Jolie, who played his character's wife Jane Smith. The Star Tribune noted that \"while the story feels haphazard, the movie gets by on gregarious charm, galloping energy and the stars' thermonuclear screen chemistry\".[99] Mr. & Mrs. Smith earned $478 million worldwide, making it one of the biggest hits of 2005.[100] For his next film, Pitt starred opposite Cate Blanchett in Alejandro González Iñárritu's multi-narrative drama Babel (2006).[101] Pitt's performance was critically well-received, and the Seattle Post-Intelligencer said that he was credible and gave the film visibility.[102] Pitt later said he regarded taking the part as one of the best decisions of his career.[103] The film was screened at a special presentation at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival[104] and was later featured at the 2006 Toronto International Film Festival.[105] Babel received seven Academy and Golden Globe award nominations, winning the Best Drama Golden Globe, and earned Pitt a nomination for the Best Supporting Actor Golden Globe.[45] That same year, Pitt's company Plan B Entertainment produced The Departed, which won the Academy Award for Best Picture. Pitt was credited on-screen as a producer; however, only Graham King was ruled eligible for the Oscar win.[106] Reprising his role as Rusty Ryan in a third picture, Pitt starred in 2007's Ocean's Thirteen.[107] While less lucrative than the first two films, this sequel earned $311 million at the international box office.[32] Pitt's next film role was as American outlaw Jesse James in the 2007 Western drama The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, adapted from Ron Hansen's 1983 novel of the same name.[108] Directed by Andrew Dominik and produced by Pitt's company Plan B Entertainment, the film premiered at the 2007 Venice Film Festival,[109] with Pitt playing a \"scary and charismatic\" role, according to Lewis Beale of Film Journal International,[110] and earning Pitt the Volpi Cup award for Best Actor at the 64th Venice International Film Festival.[111] He eventually collected the award one year later at the 2008 festival.[112] As of January 2019, it was his own favorite of his films.[113] Pitt's next appearance was in the 2008 black comedy Burn After Reading, his first collaboration with the Coen brothers. The film received a positive reception from critics, with The Guardian calling it \"a tightly wound, slickly plotted spy comedy\",[114] noting that Pitt's performance was one of the funniest.[114] He was later cast as Benjamin Button, the lead in David Fincher's 2008 film The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, a loosely adapted version of a 1921 short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald. The story follows a man who is born an octogenarian and ages in reverse,[115] with Pitt's \"sensitive\" performance making Benjamin Button a \"timeless masterpiece\", according to Michael Sragow of The Baltimore Sun.[116] The performance earned Pitt his first Screen Actors Guild Award nomination,[117] as well as a fourth Golden Globe and second Academy Award nomination,[45] all in the category for Best Actor. The film received thirteen Academy Award nominations, and grossed $329 million at the box office worldwide.[32] Pitt's next leading role came in 2009 with the Quentin Tarantino-directed war film Inglourious Basterds, which premiered at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival.[118] Pitt played Lieutenant Aldo Raine, an American resistance fighter battling Nazis in German-occupied France.[119] The film was a box office hit, taking $311 million worldwide,[32] and garnered generally favorable reviews.[120] The film received multiple awards and nominations, including eight Academy Award nominations and seven MTV Movie Award nominations, including Best Male Performance for Pitt.[121][122] He next voiced the superhero character Metro Man in the 2010 animated feature Megamind.[123] Pitt produced and appeared in Terrence Malick's experimental drama The Tree of Life, co-starring Sean Penn, which won the Palme d'Or at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival.[124] In a performance that attracted strong praise, he portrayed the Oakland Athletics general manager Billy Beane in the drama Moneyball, which is based on the 2003 book of the same name written by Michael Lewis.[125] Moneyball received six Academy Award nominations including Best Picture and Best Actor for Pitt.[126] His next role was as mob hitman Jackie Cogan in Andrew Dominik's 2012 Killing Them Softly, based on the novel Cogan's Trade by George V.

Jolie and Pitt stated that they fell in love on the set[210][211] and that there was no infidelity.[210] In April 2005, one month after Aniston filed for divorce, a set of paparazzi photographs emerged showing Pitt, Jolie, and her son Maddox at a beach in Kenya; the press interpreted the pictures as evidence of a relationship between Pitt and Jolie. Throughout 2005, the two were seen together with increasing frequency, and the entertainment media dubbed the couple \"Brangelina\".[212] On January 11, 2006, Jolie confirmed to People that she was pregnant with Pitt's child, thereby publicly acknowledging their relationship for the first time.[213] Pitt and Jolie announced their engagement in April 2012 after seven years together.[214] They were legally married on August 14, 2014, and had their wedding in a private ceremony at the Château Miraval, France on August 23, 2014.[215] On September 19, 2016, Jolie filed for divorce from Pitt, citing irreconcilable differences.[216] On April 12, 2019, the divorce became legal.[217] In 2022, he began dating Ines de Ramon (b. 1992), a jewelry designer.[218] In July 2005, Pitt accompanied Jolie to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, where she adopted her second child, a girl.[219][220] On December 3, 2005, Pitt was in the process of becoming the adoptive father of Jolie's daughter, and Jolie's first adopted child, a boy.[221] On January 19, 2006, a California judge granted Jolie's request to change the children's surnames from \"Jolie\" to \"Jolie-Pitt\".[222] The adoptions were finalized soon after.[223] Jolie gave birth to their daughter in Swakopmund, Namibia, on May 27, 2006. Pitt confirmed that their newborn daughter would qualify for a Namibian passport.[224] The couple sold the first pictures of their daughter through the distributor Getty Images; the North American rights were purchased by People for over $4.1 million, while Hello! obtained the British rights for approximately $3.5 million. The proceeds from the sale were donated to charities serving African children.[225] Madame Tussauds in New York unveiled a wax figure of the two-month-old; it marked the first time an infant had been honoured with a statue in the museum.[226] On March 15, 2007, Jolie adopted a 3-year-old boy from an orphanage in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.[227] Pitt adopted the boy in the United States on February 21, 2008.[228] At the Cannes Film Festival in May 2008, Jolie confirmed that she was expecting twins.[229] She gave birth to son and daughter on July 12, 2008 in Nice, France.[230] The rights for the first images of the twins were jointly sold to People and Hello! for $14 million—the most expensive celebrity pictures ever taken.[231][232] The couple donated the proceeds to the Jolie-Pitt Foundation.[231][233] Since Jolie filed for divorce from Pitt on September 19, 2016, they have been embroiled in a custody battle over their children. Jolie had full custody until May 2021 when Pitt was granted joint custody, over four and a half years after proceedings began.[234] However, in July, Los Angeles superior court judge John W. Ouderkirk was removed from the case due to concerns over his impartiality as he did not sufficiently disclose business relationships with Pitt's lawyers. This resulted in the custody arrangement reverting to a previous November 2018 agreement where Jolie has primary physical custody while Pitt has \"custodial time\" with their minor children.[235][236] In September 2016, the FBI and the Los Angeles Department of Children and Family Services investigated Pitt for child abuse following an incident on a plane, where Pitt was accused by an anonymous person of being \"verbally abusive\" and \"physical\" towards one of his children.[237] Pitt was not criminally charged for the incident by the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services, or by the FBI.[238] In 2022, Jolie filed a countersuit against Pitt during a legal battle over their formerly co-owned vineyard. Jolie's lawyers stated that during negotiations, Pitt had asked Jolie to sign \"a nondisclosure agreement prohibiting her from speaking outside of court about his abuse of her and their children.\"[239] Her complaint stated that he grabbed and shook her during the plane ride, strangled one of their children, and struck another in the face, among other allegations.[239] In September 2016, Pitt got sober and began attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.[240] In December 2019, he wrote an article for Interview in which he talked with his Legends of the Fall and Meet Joe Black costar and fellow recovering alcoholic Anthony Hopkins about their experiences with addiction and recovery.[241] Pitt credits fellow actor Bradley Cooper with helping him in his sobriety.[242] Pitt has admitted to using cannabis in the late 1990s as a way to deal with his increasing fame.[243][244] According to Pitt: \"I was hiding out from the celebrity thing; I was smoking way too much dope; I was sitting on the couch and just turning into a doughnut.\"[243][244][245] He reduced his cannabis use and focused on his work after a trip to Morocco, where he witnessed extreme poverty and suffering.[243][244] In 2022, Pitt said that he had struggled for years to recognize people's faces due to prosopagnosia (face blindness).[246] In a 2013 interview, he said that his inability to recognize people's faces had become so severe that he often wanted to stay home.[247] Formally, however, Pitt has not been diagnosed with prosopagnosia.[246][248] Pitt has an interest in art, learned pottery,[249] and has created sculptures. Nine of his sculptures were exhibited together with works by musician Nick Cave and artist Thomas Houseago at the Sara Hildén Art Museum in Tampere, Finland in 2022–2023.[250][251] Pitt has been frequently cited as one of the most attractive actors of all time and has been described as a sex symbol by many sources, including Empire, who named him one of the 25 sexiest stars in film history in 1995.[12][252][253] The same year, he was named People's Sexiest Man Alive, an accolade he received again in 2000.[252][254] Pitt appeared on Forbes' annual Celebrity 100 list of the 100 most powerful celebrities from 2006 to 2008 placing at numbers 20, 5 and 10, respectively.[255][256][257] In 2007, he appeared on the Time 100 list, a compilation of the 100 most influential people in the world, as selected annually by Time magazine.[258] The magazine credited Pitt for using \"his star power to get people to look [to where] cameras don't usually catch\".[258] He was again included on the Time 100 in 2009, this time in the \"Builders and Titans\" list.[259] Beginning in 2005, Pitt's relationship with Angelina Jolie became one of the world's most reported celebrity stories. After Jolie was confirmed to be pregnant in early 2006, the intense media hype surrounding the couple reached what Reuters, in a story titled \"The Brangelina fever,\" called \"the point of insanity\".[260] To avoid media attention, the couple flew to Namibia for the birth of their daughter, which was described by a paparazzi blog as \"the most anticipated baby since Jesus Christ.\"[261] Similarly, intense media interest greeted the announcement of Jolie's second pregnancy two years later; for the two weeks Jolie spent in a seaside hospital in Nice, reporters and photographers camped outside on the promenade to report on the birth.[262] In a 2006 global industry survey by ACNielsen in 42 international markets, Pitt, together with Jolie, were found to be the favorite celebrity endorsers for brands and products worldwide.[263] Pitt has appeared in several television commercials. For the U.S. market, he starred in a Heineken commercial aired during the 2005 Super Bowl; it was directed by David Fincher, who had directed Pitt in Seven, Fight Club, and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button.[264] Other commercial appearances came in television spots including Acura Integra, in which he was featured opposite Russian model Tatiana Sorokko,[265] as well as SoftBank, and Edwin Jeans.[266] On June 2, 2015, the minor planet 29132 Bradpitt was named in his honor.[267]",

                "content": "Our editors will review what you’ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article. Brad Pitt (born December 18, 1963, Shawnee, Oklahoma, U.S.) is an American actor known for his portrayal of unconventional characters. After gaining attention for his role in Thelma & Louise (1991), Pitt channeled his magnetism as a leading man in such movies as A River Runs Through It (1992) and Legends of the Fall (1994) but avoided being typecast by assuming unorthodox roles in 12 Monkeys (1995) and Fight Club (1999). Pitt won an Academy Award for his performance in Once Upon a Time…in Hollywood (2019). Pitt grew up in Springfield, Missouri, and attended (1983–87) the University of Missouri before dropping out just short of graduation to move to California and pursue an acting career. After playing minor television and movie roles, Pitt captured the public’s attention as a charming scoundrel in the film Thelma & Louise. He followed up with such movies as A River Runs Through It, Interview with the Vampire, and Legends of the Fall (1994). Pitt then starred as a police detective in the gritty thriller Se7en (1995) and as a demented malcontent in the fantasy 12 Monkeys (1995), for which he won a Golden Globe Award and was nominated for an Oscar. Pitt deliberately played against type as Austrian mountain climber Heinrich Harrer in Seven Years in Tibet (1997), an Irish Republican Army terrorist in The Devil’s Own (1997), a modern-day personification of death in Meet Joe Black (1998), and an underground boxer in Fight Club (1999). In 2000 Pitt married actress Jennifer Aniston. The following year he starred in Ocean’s Eleven, a comedy caper about con artists. The film was a major success and led to the sequels Ocean’s Twelve (2004) and Ocean’s Thirteen (2007). In 2004 Pitt portrayed the Greek warrior Achilles in Troy. The action comedy Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005) paired Pitt with actress Angelina Jolie, with whom he became romantically involved. Pitt continued to lend his talents to films covering a wide range of subject matter, including Babel (2006), a film that traces the intersecting lives of characters from divergent backgrounds, and the period western The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007). Pitt further demonstrated his versatility in 2008, portraying a dim-witted would-be blackmailer in the Coen brothers’ Burn After Reading and a man who ages backward in the poignant fantasy The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. His chameleonic turn in the latter film earned him an Academy Award nomination for best actor. In 2009 Pitt starred in Quentin Tarantino’s Inglourious Basterds, a World War II drama about a group of Jewish American soldiers trained to kill Nazis in German-occupied France. The following year Pitt provided the voice of the superhero rival of the titular villain in the animated film Megamind. In Terrence Malick’s impressionistic drama The Tree of Life (2011), he played a domineering father in 1950s Texas. Pitt later scored another best actor Oscar nomination, for his performance as real-life general manager Billy Beane in the baseball drama Moneyball (2011). The film chronicles how Beane assembled successful teams with the Oakland Athletics by using statistics to acquire cheaper, less-well-known players. Pitt subsequently starred as a mob enforcer in the crime drama Killing Them Softly (2012) and as a former United Nations investigator fighting to contain a zombie pandemic in the thriller World War Z (2013). Pitt had supporting roles in 12 Years a Slave (2013)—which was based on the true story of Solomon Northup, a free person of color who was kidnapped and sold into slavery in the mid-19th century—and in the crime drama The Counselor (2013). In Fury (2014) he played an American army sergeant commanding the remnants of a decimated battalion during the last days of World War II. The following year Pitt reteamed with Jolie, this time in By the Sea, a marital drama she also wrote and directed. He then portrayed a morally grounded former investment banker in the black comedy The Big Short (2015), about the 2008 financial crisis. In the World War II thriller Allied (2016), Pitt starred as a Canadian intelligence officer whose wife (Marion Cotillard) might be a German spy. In 2017 he portrayed a four-star general in War Machine, a military satire that was released on Netflix. Pitt later reteamed with Tarantino in Once Upon a Time…in Hollywood (2019), playing the stunt double of a washed-up actor (Leonardo DiCaprio) in 1969 Los Angeles. For his performance, Pitt earned both an Oscar and a Golden Globe Award for best supporting actor. Also in 2019 he starred as an astronaut searching the solar system for his missing father (played by Tommy Lee Jones) in the futuristic drama Ad Astra. Pitt’s credits from 2022 include the action-romance The Lost City, in which he had a memorable cameo, and Bullet Train, about a group of assassins on a high-speed train. That year he also costarred with Margot Robbie in Damien Chazelle’s Babylon, a dramedy set in Hollywood during the 1920s. In 2024 Pitt and Clooney reunited for Wolfs, an action comedy in which they played rival fixers who are forced to work together. In addition to acting, Pitt headed his own film-production company, Plan B Entertainment. The company partnered with several others to produce 12 Years a Slave, and Pitt won an Academy Award for his producing role when that film was named best picture. Pitt’s involvement with Jolie and his 2005 divorce from Aniston were intensely scrutinized by the tabloid press. In 2006 Pitt adopted Jolie’s two children, Maddox and Zahara, whom she had adopted from Cambodia and Ethiopia, respectively. The couple had their first biological child, Shiloh, in May 2006. The next year they adopted a boy, Pax, from Vietnam, and in 2008 they added biological twins, Knox and Vivienne, to their family. Pitt and Jolie married in 2014, but two years later Jolie filed for divorce. The couple often used their celebrity status as a platform for speaking out on behalf of a number of humanitarian causes. Pitt cofounded and was actively involved in Not on Our Watch, a campaign that directed resources to developing countries in crisis, notably the Sudanese province of Darfur. In 2006 he established the Make It Right Foundation, a multimillion-dollar project to construct environmentally friendly homes in New Orleans for people displaced by Hurricane Katrina. The undertaking attracted numerous high-profile architects, but it was plagued by construction issues that resulted in several legal disputes. Notably, in 2015 the foundation sued the wood supplier after a number of completed homes began rotting; the suit was settled out of court. Three years later homeowners filed a class-action lawsuit against the foundation, alleging poor construction; in 2022 Make It Right agreed to pay the plaintiffs $20.5 million. Pitt was also interested in art, and in 2022 he exhibited a number of sculptures at a museum in Finland. His “brutally honest” works included a miniature house assembled from tree bark and tape.",

We may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back. Brad Pitt has returned to the big screen with pal George Clooney in the action-comedy Wolfs. The 60-year-old Pitt portrays Nick, a professional fixer, who is forced to work with his rival in covering up a high-profile crime despite both men preferring to act alone. Wolfs first premiered at the 2024 Venice Film Festival, where it received a 5-minute ovation. After a week-long run in select theaters September 20, the movie began streaming on Apple TV+ September 27. Wolfs marks the first time Pitt has shared the screen with Clooney in 16 years, with the pair last working together in the 2008 movie Burn After Reading. Pitt told Deadline the new movie was the perfect project for the two actors to reunite. “We kind of figured there’s gotta be a good reason to get back in a film together, something we feel like we could build upon what we’ve done before,” he said. “But also, I gotta say, as I get older, working with the people that I just really enjoy spending time with has really become important to me.” A Wolfs sequel is already in the works. Academy Award–winning actor Brad Pitt is one of the most recognizable stars in Hollywood since his rise in the 1990s. His major movie roles have included Ocean’s Eleven, Troy, Mr. and Mrs. Smith, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Moneyball, and Once Upon a Time in... Hollywood, for which he won an Oscar. Initially cast in many pretty boy roles, Pitt first proved his willingness to take on grittier roles in the 1999 cult classic Fight Club and began earning more serious award consideration following his 2006 performance in Babel. The Midwest native has also proved to be a successful movie producer, backing the Oscar-winning 12 Years a Slave among many others. Pitt is also known for his high-profile marriages with fellow actors Jennifer Aniston and Angelina Jolie. His current girlfriend is fashion executive Ines de Ramon. FULL NAME: William Bradley PittBORN: December 18, 1963BIRTHPLACE: Shawnee, OklahomaSPOUSES: Jennifer Aniston (2000-2005) and Angelina Jolie (2014-2019)CHILDREN: Maddox, Pax, Zahara, Shiloh, Knox, and VivienneASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Sagittarius Brad Pitt was born William Bradley Pitt on December 18, 1963, in Shawnee, Oklahoma. The eldest of three children in a devoutly Southern Baptist family, Brad grew up in Springfield, Missouri, with his siblings Doug and Julie. His father, Bill Pitt, owned a trucking company, and his mother, Jane Pitt, was a family counselor. As a student at Kickapoo High School, Brad participated in school musicals but originally wanted to be an advertising art director. He studied journalism at the University of Missouri in pursuit of that goal, but a quieter aspiration that was the product of his childhood love of movies—to become an actor—began to grow louder. His dreams finally seemed tangible his last semester at university when he realized, “I can leave.” On a whim, Brad dropped out of college just two credits shy of a degree, packed up his Datsun, and headed west to Los Angeles. Brad told his parents he intended to enroll in the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California, but instead spent the next several months driving a limousine. He chauffeured strippers from one bachelor party to the next and delivered refrigerators while trying to break into the Los Angeles acting scene. He joined an acting class and, shortly after, accompanied a classmate as her scene partner on an audition with an agent. In a twist of fate, the agent signed Brad instead of his partner. After weathering only seven months in Los Angeles, Pitt had secured an agent and regular acting work. Pitt’s first acting jobs came in television. The 5-foot-11 actor appeared in episodes of Dallas, the daytime soap Another World, the sitcom Growing Pains, and in 1990’s short-lived Fox series Glory Days. In 1989, Pitt played Billy Canton, the drug-addicted pimp of a teenage runaway (played by Juliette Lewis) in the NBC made-for-television movie Too Young to Die. His big-screen debut was in 1989’s horror movie Cutting Class with Donovan Leitch. Pitt then played a teen track star in Sandy Tung’s Across the Tracks (1990). It was a well-timed bit part in a controversial Hollywood film that pushed Pitt to the brink of stardom. Pitt’s performance as a renegade, sugar-tongued hitchhiker who gets picked up by Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon’s characters in Thelma & Louise (1991) grabbed universal attention despite only a few minutes’ worth of screen time in the Ridley Scott–directed movie. Pitt’s combination of charming bad-boy charisma and sensual playfulness—particularly in a fiery love scene with Davis—made him a genuine sex symbol. The young actor’s next few movies failed to boost his acting credibility and establish him as more than just a pretty face in Hollywood. But in fall 1992, the Hollywood sunshine set the golden boy alight once more in Robert Redford’s film A River Runs Through It, based on Norman McLean’s autobiography. For his first major movie role, Pitt played Paul McLean, the gambling, fly-fishing younger brother of Craig Sheffer’s Norman. Redford later admitted he didn’t choose Pitt on the strength of his audition but rather because “[he] had an inner conflict that was very interesting to me.” Pitt delivered a sparkling performance, skillfully depicting Paul’s dangerous footing between overwhelming charm and reckless self-destructiveness. In 1993, Pitt reteamed with then-girlfriend Juliette Lewis in Dominic Sela’s Kalifornia. Pitt played Early Grayce, a man who goes on a cross-country killing spree with his girlfriend. Many reviewers deemed the movie self-indulgently violent and nihilistic, and it didn’t do well at the box office, either. Pitt and Lewis broke up soon after filming, creating a publicity disaster. Pitt proceeded to lighten his repertoire with a comedic performance as Floyd, a burnt-out hippie in True Romance (1993), but his next major role came in the adaptation of Anne Rice’s Interview With the Vampire (1994), alongside Tom Cruise and a young Kirsten Dunst. Rice initially expressed outrage at the casting choices, finding the two boyish, all-American movie stars too rough for the homoerotic overtones of the tale. “It’s like casting Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer,” she reportedly complained. However, after seeing the end result, Rice retracted her initial statements and filmed a short spot for the video version that endorsed the movie. Film critic Caryn James of The New York Times noted, “the power of the film depends on Mr. Pitt’s rich and deeply affecting performance. Low-key and serene, he makes Louis convincing as a bereaved father, lover, even son.” Pitt’s next few efforts secured his place as a Hollywood staple even as many critics found his roles lacking in dimension. In 1994’s Legends of the Fall, an epic family melodrama, Pitt played the stereotypical romantic hero Tristan who had long, golden locks and a penchant for alternately selfish and self-sacrificing gestures. The actor earned his first Golden Globe nomination for the performance. The next year, Pitt took an abruptly gritty turn as a detective on the trail of a serial killer in David Fincher’s disturbing and gory thriller Seven. Morgan Freeman played Pitt’s onscreen partner as Kevin Spacey and Gwyneth Paltrow tackled other roles. At the end of 1995, Pitt starred as a mental patient in Terry Gilliam’s psychological thriller 12 Monkeys. The actor won a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor in a Movie and earned his first Oscar nod. Pitt followed with another dark thriller, Sleepers (1996), then Devil’s Own (1997) with Harrison Ford before heading to Argentina to film Seven Years in Tibet (1997), an ambitious $70 million project that was met with mixed reviews. His next film, the three-hour Meet Joe Black, co-starring Anthony Hopkins, found Pitt playing a very comely version of death and didn’t inspire high praise. In 1999, after a brief hiatus from the Hollywood hot list, Pitt reteamed with Seven director David Fincher to make Fight Club. The cult classic, also starring Edward Norton, presented an uninhibited Pitt in the disturbing role of Tyler Durden, leader of the titular fight club that serves as a bloody diversion for young professional men. Next up for Pitt was the British crime-caper Snatch (2000), co-starring Benicio Del Toro and directed by Guy Ritchie. The year 2001 was busy for the actor. In addition to submitting an Emmy-nominated guest appearance on Friends, Pitt starred with Julia Roberts in the romantic comedy The Mexican, teamed with Robert Redford again in the thriller Spy Game, and joined an A-list ensemble cast—including George Clooney, Matt Damon, Bernie Mac, and Roberts—in Steven Soderbergh’s remake of Ocean’s Eleven. The heist movie was the fifth highest-grossing film of 2001 worldwide and spurred three sequels. Pitt returned for Ocean’s Twelve (2004) and Ocean’s Thirteen (2007), both popular yet slightly less successful entries in the franchise. (Sandra Bullock led the largely female cast of Ocean’s Eight in 2018.) The same year as Ocean’s Twelve, Pitt starred in the blockbuster epic Troy (2004), based on The Iliad by Homer. He portrayed the Greek hero Achilles and led a cast that included Eric Bana and Orlando Bloom. Troy made just shy of $500 million at the global box office. In 2005, Pitt starred opposite Angelina Jolie in another blockbuster, the action flick Mr. and Mrs. Smith. Showcasing a married couple who both secretly work as spies, the movie earned more than $478 million worldwide. The two actors soon became a real-life couple. Mr. and Mrs. Smith was later adapted into a TV show by Donald Glover. The critically acclaimed drama Babel (2006) earned Pitt his third Golden Globe nomination, as the movie itself was an Oscar contender for Best Picture. The actor moved on to less serious fare in Burn After Reading (2008), a FBI comedic thriller directed by the Joel and Ethan Coen that earned two Golden Globe nominations. Pitt took on arguably his most fantastical lead role to date in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008), an Academy Award–wining movie based on a short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald. The movie saw Pitt reunite with director David Fincher and Babel co-star Cate Blanchett. Pitt portrayed the title character who is born as a 70-year-old man, ages in reverse, and falls in love with Blanchett’s character, Daisy. His lauded performance earned Pitt multiple award nominations, including a nod for Best Actor at the Oscars. In 2009, Pitt starred in Quentin Tarantino’s Inglourious Basterds followed by the award-winning The Tree of Life, with Sean Penn and Jessica Chastain, two years later. But his big role for 2011 revolved around a baseball diamond. The movie star was the lead player in Moneyball, a baseball dramedy based on the identically titled 2003 nonfiction book by Michael Lewis. The story follows the travails of Oakland A’s general manager Billy Beane, who Pitt portrayed, and his quest to reshape his team. Pitt also helped produced Moneyball, which earned six Academy Award nominations that included Best Picture and Best Actor for Pitt. In 2013, Pitt won acclaim for his performance as Gerry Lane in the zombie-apocalyptic thriller World War Z and also appeared as a supporting character in The Counselor. Rave reviews piled up for his work on another 2013 movie, 12 Years a Slave. The Steve McQueen–directed film tells the true story of free Black musician Solomon Northup, played by Chiwetel Ejiofor, who is kidnapped and sold into slavery. Pitt appeared as a Canadian carpenter who greatly aids Northup. The cast also included Benedict Cumberbatch, Lupita Nyong’o, Michael Fassbender, and Quvenzhané Wallis. For his work as a producer, Pitt won his first Oscar when 12 Years a Slave was named Best Picture in March 2014. He shared the accolade with McQueen and their fellow producers. “I know I speak for everyone standing behind me that it has been an absolute privilege to work on Solomon’s story,” Pitt said during his acceptance speech. “And we all get to stand up here tonight because of one man who brought us all together to tell that story and that is the indomitable Mr. Steve McQueen.” That August, Pitt also collected his first Emmy Award for executive producing The Normal Heart (2014). The HBO film, starring Mark Ruffalo as a gay man in 1980s New York City at the start of the HIV/AIDS crisis, was named Outstanding Television Movie. After starring as an army sergeant in the World War II action-drama Fury (2014), Pitt’s next project was with his then-wife Angelina Jolie. The couple co-starred in the art house outing By the Sea (2015), which Jolie wrote and directed. Pitt then worked on another movie inspired by a best-selling Michael Lewis book. The Big Short (2015) focused on the housing market bubble that fueled the 2008 financial collapse and a group of men who’d predicted the turmoil to come. Pitt’s role as Ben Rickert was part of that bunch, and he additionally served as a producer of the Oscar-nominated film that competed for Best Picture. Other cast members included Steve Carell, Christian Bale, and Ryan Gosling. Pitt returned to a World War II–era period piece in the 2016 romantic thriller Allied, with co-star Marion Cotillard, then continued on a military theme with 2017’s War Machine. His character in the satirical movie was based on former U.S. General Stanley McChrystal. With Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood (2019), Pitt finally scored a long-elusive Academy Award for acting. The movie, directed by Quentin Tarantino, had an all-star cast that placed Pitt in the company of Leonardo DiCaprio, Margot Robbie, Emile Hirsch, Margaret Qualley, Austin Butler, and Al Pacino. Pitt’s supporting role as Cliff Booth led to his second Golden Globe and a moment of reflection during his Oscar acceptance speech: Before 2019 was over, Pitt also headlined the sci-fi adventure Ad Astra. In 2022, Pitt made a cameo appearance in The Lost City, starred in Bullet Train as an unlucky assassin who wants his gigs to go more peacefully, and headlined Babylon as movie star Jack Conrad in a story about people trying to make it big in 1920s Hollywood. He competed for the Best Supporting Actor in a Movie trophy at the subsequent Golden Globes but didn’t win. Pitt’s new movie is the action comedy Wolfs, in which he plays a professional fixer who is forced to work with his rival (played by George Clooney) despite both men being lone wolves. The movie premiered at the 2024 Venice Film Festival ahead of a limited theatrical run and its Apple TV+ streaming release in September. A Wolfs sequel has already been confirmed. In 2025, Pitt is set to star in the sports action film F1 as a Formula 1 race car driver. He has also announced plans to produce both a movie and a docuseries about the Isle of Man TT motorcycle race. As of August 2024, Pitt has an estimated net worth of $400 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. He earns a minimum of $20 million per movie, making him one of the highest-paid actors in Hollywood. His largest upfront salary was for his new movie Wolfs; he was paid $35 million. In addition to acting, Pitt co-founded a production company in 2001 with his then-wife Jennifer Aniston and then-manager Brad Grey. Plan B Entertainment has produced many successful and award-winning movies such as The Departed (2006), 12 Years a Slave (2013), Women Talking (2022), and Wolfs (2024). Pitt assumed sole ownership of Plan B in 2005 following his and Aniston’s divorce and sold a major stake in the company in 2022. The deal was reportedly worth hundreds of millions of dollars but less than $500 million. As one of Hollywood’s most recognizable stars since the 1990s, Pitt’s romantic relationships have been closely watched. The actor has been part of several high-profile couples over the years, including his marriages to fellow actors Jennifer Aniston and Angelina Jolie. Pitt is currently dating fashion executive Ines de Ramon as he continues divorce proceedings from Jolie. After being tied to a handful of women in the 1980s, including actor Christina Applegate, Pitt began a four-year relationship with actor Juliette Lewis in 1989. The two met on the set of Too Young To Die? and became close despite their 10-year age difference. Lewis was just 17 when they first met. She and Pitt also shared the screen in 1993’s Kalifornia, but their breakup after filming caused headaches during the movie’s promotion campaign. Pitt moved on with another co-star, Gwyneth Paltrow. Then a relatively unknown actor, she and Pitt appeared as a married couple in Seven. In real life, both claimed it was “love at first sight” after meeting on the movie’s set around early 1995. Pitt and Paltrow stayed together for two and a half years and were one of Hollywood’s most admired couples. Then, in 1997, after a seven-month engagement, the couple split for unknown reasons. Pitt next started dating Friends star Jennifer Aniston in 1998, with the couple announcing their engagement just one year later. Pitt and Aniston got married in September 2000 in a lavish beachside ceremony in Malibu, California. In 2001, Pitt guest starred in an episode of Friends and the following year, the pair co-founded the production company Plan B Entertainment. After five years of marriage, Pitt and Aniston announced their separation in January 2005, divorcing in October of that year. Following their divorce, the Troy actor became the sole owner of Plan B Entertainment. In 2007, Pitt maintained he still had a “deep friendship” with Aniston. Soon after his separation from Jennifer Aniston, Pitt began dating Angelina Jolie. Jolie later revealed the two developed feelings for each other on the set of Mr. and Mrs. Smith (2005). The relationship quickly became serious. In 2005, Pitt began adoption paperwork for Jolie’s two kids at the time, Maddox and Zahara. Over the next three years, the couple added four more children to their family: Shiloh, Pax, and twins Knox and Vivienne. The children all had the hyphenated last name Jolie-Pitt. (Shiloh is in the process of dropping Pitt from her last name.) Six kids and seven years later, Pitt and Jolie became engaged in 2012 and tied the knot in a private ceremony on August 23, 2014, in France. However, the union only lasted a small fraction of their time together as a couple. In September 2016, Jolie filed for divorce and requested sole custody of their children. The drama surrounding their ongoing, contentious split has played out the media. Jolie was said to be in danger of losing custody in June 2018 due to her insistence on keeping the children from seeing their father. That August, Jolie filed court documents that claimed her estranged husband had “paid no meaningful child support since separation.” Pitt’s legal team followed with their own filing that they asserted the actor had paid more than $1.3 million in bills for the family and helped Jolie buy her current home through an $8 million loan. A judge ruled Pitt and Jolie legally single in April 2019, though the former couple’s divorce has yet to be fully finalized. In October 2022, Jolie filed a complaint alleging that Pitt was physically abusive to her and their six children during a 2016 plane ride, which led to their divorce. Jolie said he “choked one of the children and struck another in the face” and grabbed her “by the head and shook her.” She also stated Pitt poured alcohol all over her and the kids. Two years later, in April 2024, Jolie issued a new legal filing claiming that Pitt’s abuse started long before the 2016 incident. Pitt started dating Swiss luxury jewelry executive Ines de Ramon in late 2022. The couple was first spotted together that November before attending the Babylon movie premiere a month later. Pitt and his girlfriend reportedly moved in together in February 2024 and made their first red carpet appearance at the Venice Film Festival in September. Pitt is a father to six adopted and biological children who he shares with his ex-wife Angelina Jolie. From oldest to youngest, they are Maddox, Pax, Zahara, Shiloh, Knox, and Vivienne. Soon after he and Jolie began their relationship, Pitt filed paperwork in 2005 to adopt Maddox, born in 2001, and Zahara, born in 2005. Next, the couple had a daughter who they named Shiloh in May 2006. Their brood grew again in 2007 with the adoption of 3-year-old Pax, who was born in 2003. Then, in July 2008, Jolie had fraternal twins: a son named Knox and a daughter named Vivienne. Although Jolie sought full custody of their kids, Pitt was awarded joint custody of the children in May 2021. That ruling was overturned months later due to a legal technicality, then in October 2022, Jolie said in a court filing that Pitt had been physically and verbally abusive on a plane ride six years earlier. Amid the ongoing divorce, Pitt’s children have distanced themselves from him, with Zahara, Shiloh, and Vivienne choosing to adopt their mother’s last name. Shiloh began the official process to change her last name from Jolie-Pitt to just Jolie in May 2024. In a now deleted Instagram story, Pitt’s son Pax reportedly had some choice words for him on Father’s Day in 2020, calling the actor a “terrible and despicable person.” The Biography.com staff is a team of people-obsessed and news-hungry editors with decades of collective experience.

                "title": "Puerto Rico - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Puerto Rico[i] (Spanish for 'rich port'; abbreviated PR),[21] officially the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico,[b][j] is a self-governing Caribbean archipelago and island organized as an unincorporated territory of the United States under the designation of commonwealth. Located about 1,000 miles (1,600 km) southeast of Miami, Florida, between the Dominican Republic in the Greater Antilles and the U.S. Virgin Islands in the Lesser Antilles, it consists of the eponymous main island and numerous smaller islands, including Vieques, Culebra, and Mona. With approximately 3.2 million residents, it is divided into 78 municipalities, of which the most populous is the capital municipality of San Juan, followed by those within the San Juan metropolitan area.[21] Spanish and English are the official languages of the government,[23] though Spanish predominates.[24][25] Puerto Rico was settled by a succession of Amerindian peoples beginning 2,000 to 4,000 years ago;[26] these included the Ortoiroid, Saladoid, and Taíno. It was claimed by Spain following the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1493 and subsequently colonized by Juan Ponce de León in 1508.[21] Puerto Rico was contested by other European powers into the 18th century but remained a Spanish possession for the next 400 years. The decline of the indigenous population, followed by an influx of Spanish settlers, primarily from the Canary Islands and Andalusia, and African slaves vastly changed the cultural and demographic landscape of the archipelago. Within the Spanish Empire, Puerto Rico played a secondary but strategically significant role compared to larger and wealthier colonies like Peru and New Spain.[27][28] By the late 19th century, a distinct Puerto Rican identity began to emerge, centered around a fusion of European, African, and indigenous elements.[29][30] In 1898, following the Spanish–American War, Puerto Rico was acquired by the United States.[21][31] Puerto Ricans have been U.S. citizens since 1917 and can move freely between the archipelago and the mainland.[32] However, residents of Puerto Rico are disenfranchised from federal elections[33] and generally do not pay federal income tax.[34][35][k] In common with four other territories, Puerto Rico sends a nonvoting representative to the U.S. Congress, called a Resident Commissioner, and participates in presidential primaries; as it is not a state, Puerto Rico does not have a vote in the U.S. Congress, which oversees it under the Puerto Rico Federal Relations Act of 1950. Congress approved a territorial constitution in 1952, allowing residents of the archipelago to elect a governor in addition to a senate and house of representatives. The political status of Puerto Rico is an ongoing debate.[36][37] Beginning in the mid-20th century, the U.S. government, together with the Puerto Rico Industrial Development Company, launched a series of economic projects to develop Puerto Rico into an industrial high-income economy. It is classified by the International Monetary Fund as a developed jurisdiction with an advanced, high-income economy;[38] it ranks 40th on the Human Development Index. The major sectors of Puerto Rico's economy are manufacturing, primarily pharmaceuticals, petrochemicals, and electronics, followed by services, namely tourism and hospitality.[39] Puerto Rico is Spanish for \"rich port\".[21] Puerto Ricans often call the island Borinquen, a derivation of Borikén, its Indigenous Taíno name, which is popularly said to mean \"Land of the Valiant Lord\".[40][41][42] The terms boricua, borinqueño, and borincano are commonly used to identify someone of Puerto Rican heritage,[43][44] and derive from Borikén and Borinquen respectively.[45] The island is also popularly known in Spanish as La Isla del Encanto, meaning \"the island of enchantment\".[46] Columbus named the island San Juan Bautista, in honor of Saint John the Baptist, while the capital city was named Ciudad de Puerto Rico (\"Rich Port City\").[21] Eventually traders and other maritime visitors came to refer to the entire island as Puerto Rico, while San Juan became the name used for the main trading/shipping port and the capital city.[l] The island's name was changed to Porto Rico by the United States after the Treaty of Paris of 1898.[48] The anglicized name was used by the U.S. government and private enterprises (also Porto in Italian, French, and Portuguese). The name was changed back to Puerto Rico in 1931 by a joint resolution in Congress introduced by Félix Córdova Dávila.[49][m][54][55][56] The official name of the entity in Spanish is Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico (\"Free Associated State of Puerto Rico\"), while its official English name is Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.[21] The Spanish official name was suggested by its architect Luis Muñoz Marín and adopted by a constitutional assembly on July 25, 1952. Some authorities have called it a euphemism and have charged that the official name in English of \"Commonwealth\" constitutes a fig leaf, i.e., associated with the covering up of an act that is actually embarrassing or distasteful with something of innocuous appearance.[57] Puerto Rico remains a territory of the United States, exercising substantial internal self-government, but subordinated to the U.S. Constitution in areas such as foreign affairs or defense. For this reason, it is not considered to be a full-fledged associated state under either international or U.S. domestic law.[58][59] The history of Puerto Rico began with the settlement of the Ortoiroid people before 430 BC. At the time of Christopher Columbus's arrival in the New World in 1493, the dominant indigenous culture was that of the Taínos. The Taíno people's numbers went dangerously low during the later half of the 16th century because of new infectious diseases carried by Europeans, exploitation by Spanish settlers, and warfare.[61] Located in the northeastern Caribbean, Puerto Rico formed a key part of the Spanish Empire from the early years of the exploration, conquest and colonization of the New World. The island was a major military post during many wars between Spain and other European powers for control of the region in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries. In 1593, Portuguese soldiers, sent from Lisbon by order of Phillip II, composed the first garrison of the San Felipe del Morro fortress in Puerto Rico. Some brought their wives, while others married Puerto Rican women, and today there are many Puerto Rican families with Portuguese last names. The smallest of the Greater Antilles, Puerto Rico was a stepping-stone in the passage from Europe to Cuba, Mexico, Central America, and the northern territories of South America. Throughout most of the 19th century until the conclusion of the Spanish–American War, Puerto Rico and Cuba were the last two Spanish colonies in the New World; they served as Spain's final outposts in a strategy to regain control of the American continents. Realizing that it was in danger of losing its two remaining Caribbean territories, the Spanish Crown revived the Royal Decree of Graces of 1815. The decree was printed in Spanish, English and French in order to attract Europeans, with the hope that the independence movements would lose their popularity and strength with the arrival of new settlers. Free land was offered to those who wanted to populate the islands on the condition that they swear their loyalty to the Spanish Crown and allegiance to the Catholic Church.[62] In 1898, during the Spanish–American War, Puerto Rico was invaded and subsequently became a possession of the U.S. The first years of the 20th century were marked by the struggle to obtain greater democratic rights from the U.S.[citation needed] The Foraker Act of 1900 established a civil government, ending rule by American generals and the Department of War. A U.S. Supreme Court ruling, Ortega v. Lara, 202 U.S. 339, 342 (1906),[n] involving the Foraker Act and referring to the island as \"the acquired country\", soon affirmed that the U.S. Constitution applied within its territory and that any domestic Puerto Rican laws which did not conflict with it remained in force.[63] The Jones Act of 1917, which made Puerto Ricans U.S. citizens, paved the way for the drafting of Puerto Rico's Constitution and its approval by Congress and Puerto Rican voters in 1952.[citation needed] Puerto Rico is one of five territories with less representation in the Federal government, along with the Federal District. In 2009, the United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization approved a draft resolution calling on the U.S. government to expedite a process that would allow the Puerto Rican people to exercise fully their inalienable right to self-determination and independence.[64] In November 2012, a two-question referendum took place, simultaneous with the general elections.[65][66] The first question, voted on in August, asked voters whether they wanted to maintain the current status under the territorial clause of the U.S. Constitution. 54% voted against the status quo, effectively approving the second question to be voted on in November. The second question posed three alternate status options: statehood, independence, or free association.[67] 61.16% voted for statehood, 33.34% for a sovereign free-associated state, and 5.49% for independence.[68][failed verification] In 2016, President Barack Obama signed into law H.R. 5278: PROMESA, establishing a Control Board over the Puerto Rican government. This board will have a significant degree of federal control involved in its establishment and operations. In particular, the authority to establish the control board derives from the federal government's constitutional power to \"make all needful rules and regulations\" regarding U.S. territories; The president would appoint all seven voting members of the board; and the board would have broad sovereign powers to effectively overrule decisions by Puerto Rico's legislature, governor, and other public authorities.[69] There would be another referendum in 2017 in Puerto Rico, in favor of statehood although it was boycotted by some political opponents of it. (see 2017 Puerto Rican status referendum) In 2017, Puerto Rico suffered back-to-back large hurricanes: the Category 5 Hurricane Irma (September 7, 2017) and the Category 4 Hurricane Maria (September 20, 2017).[70] The storms caused an extreme amount of damage to the island, causing the following effects: all power was knocked out, 95% cell service, 43% of waste water treatment plants, 40 thousand land slides, 97% of roads blocked, 28% of health facilities damaged, leading to over 90% of the population applying for assistance after the storms.[70] See also Effects of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico It is thought that a combination of the debt crisis and two major hurricanes in the late 2010s, caused further departures from the island. Overall the population has decreased by about half a million in the 21st century, with many seeking better opportunities on the mainland.[71] Puerto Rico held its statehood referendum during the 3 November 2020 general elections; the ballot asked one question: \"Should Puerto Rico be admitted immediately into the Union as a State?\" The results showed that 52 percent of Puerto Rico voters answered yes.[72] In the United States in the early 2020s, the Puerto Rico Status Act was being worked on by Congress, and H.R. 8393 passed the House in 2022—though it has not passed the Senate; this bill would support PR making a binding referendum. The bill does not decide PR's fate, it simply prepares the United States to respond the outcome of referendum.[73] In the 5 November 2024 elections, there was three choices in a non-binding referendum which included Statehood, Independence, or Independence with Free Association on the ballot; Statehood won with 59%.[74] In addition, on November 5, 2024, Jennifer Gonzalez won the office of Governor of Puerto Rico in the 2024 general election, with nearly 40% of the vote, who is pro-statehood.[75] Puerto Rico consists of the main island of Puerto Rico and various smaller islands, including Vieques, Culebra, Mona, Desecheo, and Caja de Muertos. Of these five, only Culebra and Vieques are inhabited year-round. Mona, which has played a key role in maritime history, is uninhabited most of the year except for employees of the Puerto Rico Department of Natural Resources.[76] There are many other even smaller islets, like Monito, located near Mona,[77] and Isla de Cabras and La Isleta de San Juan, both located on the San Juan Bay. The latter is the only inhabited islet with communities like Old San Juan and Puerta de Tierra, which are connected to the main island by bridges.[78][79] The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico has an area of 5,320 square miles (13,800 km2), of which 3,420 sq mi (8,900 km2) is land and 1,900 sq mi (4,900 km2) is water.[81] Puerto Rico is larger than Delaware and Rhode Island but smaller than Connecticut. The maximum length of the main island from east to west is 110 mi (180 km), and the maximum width from north to south is 40 mi (64 km).[82] Puerto Rico is the smallest of the Greater Antilles. It is 80% of the size of Jamaica,[83] just over 18% of the size of Hispaniola and 8% of the size of Cuba, the largest of the Greater Antilles.[84] The topography of the island is mostly mountainous with large flat areas in the northern and southern coasts. The main mountain range that crosses the island from east to west is called the Cordillera Central (also known as the Central Mountain Range in English). The highest elevation in Puerto Rico, Cerro de Punta 4,390 feet (1,340 m),[81] is located in this range. Another important peak is El Yunque, one of the highest in the Sierra de Luquillo at the El Yunque National Forest, with an elevation of 3,494 ft (1,065 m).[85] Puerto Rico has 17 lakes, all man-made, and more than 50 rivers, most of which originate in the Cordillera Central.[86] Rivers in the northern region of the island are typically longer and of higher water flow rates than those of the south, since the south receives less rain than the central and northern regions. Puerto Rico is composed of Cretaceous to Eocene volcanic and plutonic rocks, overlain by younger Oligocene and more recent carbonates and other sedimentary rocks.[87] Most of the caverns and karst topography on the island occurs in the northern region. The oldest rocks are approximately 190 million years old (Jurassic) and are located at Sierra Bermeja in the southwest part of the island. They may represent part of the oceanic crust and are believed to come from the Pacific Ocean realm. Puerto Rico lies at the boundary between the Caribbean and North American Plates and is being deformed by the tectonic stresses caused by their interaction. These stresses may cause earthquakes and tsunamis. These seismic events, along with landslides, represent some of the most dangerous geologic hazards in the island and in the northeastern Caribbean. The 1918 San Fermín earthquake occurred on 11 October, 1918 and had an estimated magnitude of 7.5 on the Richter scale.[88] It originated off the coast of Aguadilla, several kilometers off the northern coast, and was accompanied by a tsunami. It caused extensive property damage and widespread losses, damaging infrastructure, especially bridges. It resulted in an estimated 116 deaths and $4 million in property damage. The failure of the government to move rapidly to provide for the general welfare contributed to political activism by opponents and eventually to the rise of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party. On 7 January 2020,[89] the country experienced its largest earthquake since 1918,[90] estimated at magnitude 6.4.[91] Economic losses were estimated to be more than $3.1 billion.[92] The Puerto Rico Trench, the largest and deepest trench in the Atlantic, is located about 71 mi (114 km) north of Puerto Rico at the boundary between the Caribbean and North American plates.[93] It is 170 mi (270 km) long.[94] At its deepest point, named the Milwaukee Deep, it is almost 27,600 ft (8,400 m) deep.[93] The Mona Canyon, located in the Mona Passage between Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, is another prominent oceanic landform with steep walls measuring between 1.25 and 2.17 miles (2.01 and 3.49 km) in height from bottom to top.[95] The climate of Puerto Rico in the Köppen climate classification is mostly tropical rainforest. Temperatures are warm to hot year round, averaging near 85 °F (29 °C) in lower elevations and 70 °F (21 °C) in the mountains. Easterly trade winds pass across the island year round. Puerto Rico has a rainy season, which stretches from April into November, and a dry season stretching from December to March. The mountains of the Cordillera Central create a rain shadow and are the main cause of the variations in the temperature and rainfall that occur over very short distances. The mountains can also cause wide variation in local wind speed and direction due to their sheltering and channeling effects, adding to the climatic variation. Daily temperature changes seasonally are quite small in the lowlands and coastal areas. Between the dry and wet seasons, there is a temperature change of around 6 °F (3.3 °C). This change is due mainly to the warm waters of the tropical Atlantic Ocean, which significantly modify cooler air moving in from the north and northwest. Coastal water temperatures during the year are about 75 °F (24 °C) in February and 85 °F (29 °C) in August. The highest temperature ever recorded was 110 °F (43 °C) at Arecibo,[96] while the lowest temperature ever recorded was 40 °F (4 °C) in the mountains at Adjuntas, Aibonito, and Corozal.[97] The average yearly precipitation is 66 in (1,676 mm).[98] Climate change in Puerto Rico has had a large impact on the ecosystems and landscapes.[99] Puerto Rico experiences the Atlantic hurricane season, similar to the rest of the Caribbean Sea and North Atlantic Ocean. On average, a quarter of its annual rainfall is contributed from tropical cyclones, which are more prevalent during periods of La Niña than El Niño.[100] A cyclone of tropical storm strength passes near Puerto Rico, on average, every five years. A hurricane passes in the vicinity of the island, on average, every seven years. Since 1851, the Lake Okeechobee Hurricane (also known as the San Felipe Segundo hurricane in Puerto Rico) of September 1928 is the only hurricane to make landfall as a Category 5 hurricane.[101] In 2017, Puerto Rico was affected by Category 5 Hurricane Irma and Category 4 Hurricane Maria,[102] causing widespread and devastating impacts, particularly to the electric grid.[102] Puerto Rico is home to three terrestrial ecoregions: Puerto Rican moist forests, Puerto Rican dry forests, and Greater Antilles mangroves.[103] Puerto Rico has two biosphere reserves recognized by the UNESCO Man and the Biosphere Programme: Luquillo Biosphere Reserve represented by El Yunque National Forest and the Guánica Biosphere Reserve. Species endemic to the archipelago number 239 plants, 16 birds and 39 amphibians/reptiles, recognized as of 1998. Most of these (234, 12 and 33 respectively) are found on the main island.[104] The most recognizable endemic species and a symbol of Puerto Rican pride is the coquí, a small frog easily identified by the sound of its call, from which it gets its name. Most coquí species (13 of 17) live in the El Yunque National Forest,[105] the only tropical rainforest in the U.S. Forest Service system, located in the northeast of the island. It was previously known as the Caribbean National Forest. El Yunque is home to more than 240 plants, 26 of which are endemic to the island. It is also home to 50 bird species, including the critically endangered Puerto Rican amazon. In addition to El Yunque National Forest, the Puerto Rican moist forest ecoregion is represented by protected areas such as the Maricao and Toro Negro state forests. These areas are home to endangered endemic species such as the Puerto Rican boa (Chilabothrus inornatus), the Puerto Rican sharp-shinned hawk (Accipiter striatus venator), the Puerto Rican broad-winged hawk (Buteo platypterus brunnescens) and the elfin woods warbler (Setophaga angelae). The Northern Karst country of Puerto Rico is also home to one of the remaining rainforest tracts in the island, with the Río Abajo State Forest being the first focus for the reintroduction of the highly endangered Puerto Rican parrot outside of the Sierra de Luquillo.[106][107] In the southwest, the Guánica State Forest and Biosphere Reserve contain over 600 uncommon species of plants and animals, including 48 endangered species and 16 that are endemic to Puerto Rico, and is considered a prime example of the Puerto Rican dry forest ecoregion and the best-preserved dry forest in the Caribbean.[108] Other protected dry forests in Puerto Rico can be formed within the Caribbean Islands National Wildlife Refuge complex at the Cabo Rojo, Desecheo, Culebra and Vieques National Wildlife Refuges, and in the Caja de Muertos and Mona and Monito Islands Nature Reserves.[109] Examples of endemic species found in this ecoregion are the higo chumbo (Harrisia portoricensis), the Puerto Rican crested toad (Peltophryne lemur), and the Mona ground iguana (Cyclura stejnegeri), the largest land animal native to Puerto Rico.[110] Puerto Rico has three of the seven year-long bioluminescent bays in the Caribbean: Laguna Grande in Fajardo, La Parguera in Lajas and Puerto Mosquito in Vieques. These are unique bodies of water surrounded by mangroves that are inhabited by the dinoflagellate Pyrodinium bahamense.[111][112] However, tourism, pollution, and hurricanes have highly threatened these unique ecosystems.[113] Puerto Rico has a republican form of government based on the American model, with separation of powers subject to the jurisdiction and sovereignty of the United States.[114][115] All governmental powers are delegated by the United States Congress, with the head of state being the president of the United States. As an unincorporated territory, Puerto Rico lacks full protection under the U.S. Constitution.[116] The government of Puerto Rico is composed of three branches. The executive is headed by the governor, currently Pedro Pierluisi Urrutia. The legislative branch consists of the bicameral Legislative Assembly, made up of a Senate as its upper chamber and a House of Representatives as its lower chamber; the Senate is headed by a president, currently José Luis Dalmau, while the House is headed by the speaker of the House, currently Tatito Hernández. The governor and legislators are elected by popular vote every four years, with the last election held in November 2020. The judicial branch is headed by the chief justice of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, currently Maite Oronoz Rodríguez. Members of the judiciary are appointed by the governor with the advice and consent of the Senate. Puerto Rico is represented in the U.S. Congress by a nonvoting delegate to the House of Representatives, the resident commissioner, currently Jenniffer González. Current congressional rules have removed the commissioner's power to vote in the Committee of the Whole, but the commissioner can vote in committee.[117] Puerto Rican elections are governed by the Federal Election Commission and the State Elections Commission of Puerto Rico.[118][119] Residents of Puerto Rico, including other U.S. citizens, cannot vote in U.S. presidential elections, but can vote in primaries. Puerto Ricans who become residents of a U.S. state or Washington, D.C. can vote in presidential elections. Puerto Rico has eight senatorial districts, 40 representative districts, and 78 municipalities; there are no first-order administrative divisions as defined by the U.S. government. Municipalities are subdivided into wards or barrios, and those into sectors. Each municipality has a mayor and a municipal legislature elected for a four-year term. The municipality of San Juan is the oldest, founded in 1521;[120] the next earliest settlements are San Germán in 1570, Coamo in 1579, Arecibo in 1614, Aguada in 1692 and Ponce in 1692. Increased settlement in the 18th century saw 30 more communities established, following 34 in the 19th century. Six were founded in the 20th century, the most recent being Florida in 1971.[121] Since 1952, Puerto Rico has had three main political parties: the Popular Democratic Party (PPD in Spanish), the New Progressive Party (PNP in Spanish) and the Puerto Rican Independence Party (PIP). The three parties stand for different political status. The PPD, for example, seeks to maintain the island's status with the U.S. as a commonwealth, while the PNP seeks to make Puerto Rico a U.S. state. Meanwhile, the PIP seeks to make Puerto Rico a sovereign nation free from U.S. authority. In terms of party strength, the PPD and PNP usually hold about 47% of the vote each while the PIP holds about 5%. After 2007, other parties emerged on the island. The first, the Puerto Ricans for Puerto Rico Party was registered that same year. The party claims that it seeks to address the islands' problems from a status-neutral platform. But it ceased to remain as a registered party when it failed to obtain the required number of votes in the 2008 general election. Four years later, the 2012 election saw the emergence of the Movimiento Unión Soberanista (English: Sovereign Union Movement) and the Partido del Pueblo Trabajador (English: Working People's Party) but none obtained more than 1% of the vote. Other non-registered parties include the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party, the Socialist Workers Movement, and the Hostosian National Independence Movement. The nature of Puerto Rico's political relationship with the U.S. is the subject of ongoing debate in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Congress, and the United Nations.[122] Specifically, the basic question is whether Puerto Rico should remain an unincorporated territory of the U.S., become a U.S. state, or become an independent country.[123] Constitutionally, Puerto Rico is subject to the plenary powers of the U.S. Congress under the territorial clause of Article IV of the U.S. Constitution.[124] Laws enacted at the federal level in the U.S. apply to Puerto Rico as well, regardless of its political status. Their residents do not have voting representation in the U.S. Congress. Puerto Rico lacks \"the full sovereignty of an independent nation\", for example, the power to manage its \"external relations with other nations\", which is held by the U.S. federal government. The U.S. Supreme Court has indicated that once the U.S. Constitution has been extended to an area (by Congress or the courts), its coverage is irrevocable. To hold that the political branches may switch the Constitution on or off at will would lead to a regime in which they, not this Court, say \"what the law is\".[125] Puerto Ricans \"were collectively made U.S. citizens\" in 1917 as a result of the Jones–Shafroth Act.[126] U.S. citizens residing in Puerto Rico cannot vote in U.S. presidential elections, though both major parties, Republican and Democratic, hold primary elections in Puerto Rico to choose delegates to vote on the parties' presidential candidates. Since Puerto Rico is an unincorporated territory and not a U.S. state, the U.S. Constitution does not fully enfranchise U.S. citizens residing in Puerto Rico.[116][127] Only fundamental rights under the American federal constitution and adjudications are applied to Puerto Ricans. Various other U.S. Supreme Court decisions have held which rights apply in Puerto Rico and which ones do not. Puerto Ricans have a long history of service in the U.S. Armed Forces and, since 1917, they have been included in the U.S. compulsory draft when it has been in effect. Though the Commonwealth government has its own tax laws, residents of Puerto Rico, contrary to a popular misconception, do pay U.S. federal taxes: customs taxes (which are subsequently returned to the Puerto Rico Treasury), import/export taxes, federal commodity taxes, social security taxes, etc. Residents pay federal payroll taxes, such as Social Security and Medicare, as well as Commonwealth of Puerto Rico income taxes. All federal employees, those who do business with the federal government, Puerto Rico-based corporations that intend to send funds to the U.S., and some others, such as Puerto Rican residents that are members of the U.S. military, and Puerto Rico residents who earned income from sources outside Puerto Rico also pay federal income taxes. In addition, because the cutoff point for income taxation is lower than that of the U.S. IRS code, and because the per-capita income in Puerto Rico is much lower than the average per-capita income on the mainland, more Puerto Rico residents pay income taxes to the local taxation authority than if the IRS code were applied to the island. This occurs because \"the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico government has a wider set of responsibilities than do U.S. State and local governments.\"[128][129][130][131][132][133][134] In 2009, Puerto Rico paid $3.742 billion into the U.S. Treasury.[135] Residents of Puerto Rico pay into Social Security, and are thus eligible for Social Security benefits upon retirement. They are excluded from the Supplemental Security Income, and the island receives a smaller fraction of the Medicaid funding it would receive if it were a U.S. state.[136] Also, Medicare providers receive less-than-full state-like reimbursements for services rendered to beneficiaries in Puerto Rico, even though the latter paid fully into the system.[137] Puerto Rico's authority to enact a criminal code derives from Congress and not from local sovereignty as with the states. Thus, individuals committing a crime can only be tried in federal or territorial court, otherwise it would constitute double jeopardy and is constitutionally impermissible.[138] In 1992, President George H. W. Bush issued a memorandum to heads of executive departments and agencies establishing the current administrative relationship between the federal government and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. This memorandum directs all federal departments, agencies, and officials to treat Puerto Rico administratively as if it were a state, insofar as doing so would not disrupt federal programs or operations. Many federal executive branch agencies have significant presence in Puerto Rico, just as in any state, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Federal Emergency Management Agency, Transportation Security Administration, Social Security Administration, and others. While Puerto Rico has its own Commonwealth judicial system similar to that of a U.S. state, there is also a U.S. federal district court in Puerto Rico, and Puerto Ricans have served as judges in that Court and in other federal courts on the U.S. mainland regardless of their residency status at the time of their appointment. Sonia Sotomayor, a New Yorker of Puerto Rican descent, serves as an associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. Puerto Ricans have also been frequently appointed to high-level federal positions, including serving as U.S. ambassadors to other nations. Unlike the vast majority of U.S. states, Puerto Rico has no first-order administrative divisions akin to counties, but has 78 municipalities or municipios as the secondary unit of administration; for U.S. Census purposes, the municipalities are considered county equivalents. Municipalities are subdivided into barrios, and those into sectors. Each municipality has a mayor and a municipal legislature elected for four-year terms, per the Autonomous Municipalities Act of 1991. Puerto Rico is subject to the Commerce and Territorial Clause of the U.S. Constitution and is thus restricted on how it can engage with other nations, sharing the opportunities and limitations that state governments have albeit not being one. As is the case with state governments, it has established several trade agreements with other nations, particularly with Latin American countries such as Colombia and Panamá.[139][140] It has also established trade promotion offices in many foreign countries, all Spanish-speaking, and within the U.S. itself, which now include Spain, the Dominican Republic, Panama, Colombia, Washington, D.C., New York City and Florida, and has included in the past offices in Chile, Costa Rica, and Mexico. Such agreements require permission from the U.S. Department of State; most are simply allowed by existing laws or trade treaties between the U.S. and other nations which supersede trade agreements pursued by Puerto Rico and different U.S. states. Puerto Rico hosts consulates from 41 countries, mainly from the Americas and Europe, with most located in San Juan.[120] At the local level, Puerto Rico established by law that the international relations which states and territories are allowed to engage must be handled by the Department of State of Puerto Rico, an executive department, headed by the secretary of state of Puerto Rico, who also serves as the unincorporated territory's lieutenant governor. It is also charged to liaise with general consuls and honorary consuls based in Puerto Rico. The Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration, along with the Office of the Resident Commissioner, manages all its intergovernmental affairs before entities of or in the U.S. (including the federal government of the U.S., local and state governments of the U.S., and public or private entities in the U.S.).[citation needed] Both entities frequently assist the Department of State of Puerto Rico in engaging with Washington, D.C.-based ambassadors and federal agencies that handle Puerto Rico's foreign affairs, such as the U.S. Department of State, the Agency for International Development, and others. The current secretary of state is Larry Seilhamer Rodríguez from the New Progressive Party, while the current director of the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration is Jennifer M. Stopiran also from the NPP and a member of the Republican Party of the U.S.[citation needed] The resident commissioner of Puerto Rico, the delegate elected by Puerto Ricans to represent them before the federal government, including the U.S. Congress, sits in the U.S. House of Representatives, serves and votes on congressional committees, and functions in every respect as a legislator except being denied a vote on the final disposition of legislation on the House floor. The current resident commissioner is Jenniffer González-Colón, a member of the New Progressive Party and the Republican Party, elected in 2016. She received more votes than any other official elected in Puerto Rico that year.[141] Many Puerto Ricans have served as U.S. ambassadors to different nations and international organizations, such as the Organization of American States, mostly but not exclusively in Latin America. For example, Maricarmen Aponte, a Puerto Rican and now an acting assistant secretary of state, previously served as U.S. ambassador to El Salvador.[142] As it is an unincorporated U.S. territory, the defense of Puerto Rico is provided by the U.S. as part of the Treaty of Paris with the president of the U.S. as its commander-in-chief. Puerto Rico has its own National Guard, and its own state defense force, the Puerto Rico State Guard, which by local law is under the authority of the Puerto Rico National Guard. The commander-in-chief of both local forces is the governor of Puerto Rico who delegates his authority to the Puerto Rico adjutant general, currently Major General José J. Reyes. The Adjutant General, in turn, delegates the authority over the State Guard to another officer but retains the authority over the Puerto Rico National Guard as a whole. U.S. military installations in Puerto Rico were part of the U.S. Atlantic Command (LANTCOM after 1993 USACOM), which had authority over all U.S. military operations that took place throughout the Atlantic. Puerto Rico had been seen as crucial in supporting LANTCOM's mission until 1999, when U.S. Atlantic Command was renamed and given a new mission as U.S. Joint Forces Command. Puerto Rico is currently under the responsibility of U.S. Northern Command. Both the Naval Forces Caribbean (NFC) and the Fleet Air Caribbean (FAIR) were formerly based at the Roosevelt Roads Naval Station. The NFC had authority over all U.S. Naval activity in the waters of the Caribbean while FAIR had authority over all U.S. military flights and air operations over the Caribbean. With the closing of the Roosevelt Roads and Vieques Island training facilities, the U.S. Navy has basically exited from Puerto Rico, except for the ships that steam by, and the only significant military presence in the island is the U.S. Army at Ft Buchanan, the Puerto Rican Army and Air National Guards, and the U.S. Coast Guard. Protests over the noise of bombing practice forced the closure of the naval base. This resulted in a loss of 6,000 jobs and an annual decrease in local income of $300 million.[143] A branch of the U.S. Army National Guard is stationed in Puerto Rico – known as the Puerto Rico Army National Guard – which performs missions equivalent to those of the Army National Guards of different U.S. states, including ground defense, disaster relief, and control of civil unrest. The local National Guard also incorporates a branch of the U.S. Air National Guard – known as the Puerto Rico Air National Guard – which performs missions equivalent to those of the Air National Guards of each one of the U.S. states. At different times in the 20th century, the U.S. had about 25 military or naval installations in Puerto Rico.[144] The largest of these installations were the former Roosevelt Roads Naval Station in Ceiba, the Atlantic Fleet Weapons Training Facility (AFWTF) on Vieques, the National Guard training facility at Camp Santiago in Salinas, Fort Allen in Juana Diaz, the Army's Fort Buchanan in San Juan, the former U.S. Air Force's Ramey Air Force Base in Aguadilla, and the Puerto Rico Air National Guard's Muñiz Air National Guard Base in San Juan.[145] The former U.S. Navy facilities at Roosevelt Roads, Vieques, and Sabana Seca have been deactivated and partially turned over to the local government. Other than U.S. Coast Guard and Puerto Rico National Guard facilities, there are only two remaining military installations in Puerto Rico: the U.S. Army's small Ft. Buchanan (supporting local veterans and reserve units) and the PRANG (Puerto Rico Air National Guard) Muñiz Air Base (the C-130 Fleet). In recent years, the U.S. Congress has considered their deactivations, but these have been opposed by diverse public and private entities in Puerto Rico – such as retired military who rely on Ft. Buchanan for the services available there. Puerto Ricans have participated in many U.S. military conflicts, including the American Revolution, when volunteers from Puerto Rico, Cuba, and Mexico fought the British in 1779 under the command of General Bernardo de Gálvez (1746–1786).[146] They continue to be disproportionately represented in present-day conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.[147] The most notable example is the 65th Infantry Regiment of the U.S. Army, nicknamed The Borinqueneers, from the original Taíno name of the island (Borinquen). The all-Puerto Rican regiment participated in World War I, World War II, the Korean War, and the War on Terror; in 2014, it was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal for its heroism during the Korean War. A significant number of Puerto Ricans serve in the U.S. Armed Forces, largely as National Guard members and civilian employees. The size of the overall military-related community is estimated to be 100,000, including retired personnel.[145] Fort Buchanan has about 4,000 military and civilian personnel. In addition, approximately 17,000 people are members of the Puerto Rico Army and Air National Guards, or the U.S. Reserve forces.[148] The insular legal system is a blend of civil law and the common law systems. Puerto Rico is the only current U.S. jurisdiction whose legal system operates primarily in a language other than American English: namely, Spanish. Because the U.S. federal government operates primarily in English, all Puerto Rican attorneys must be bilingual in order to litigate in English in U.S. federal courts, and litigate federal preemption issues in Puerto Rican courts.[149][original research?] Title 48 of the United States Code outlines the role of the U.S. Code to U.S. territories and insular areas such as Puerto Rico. After the U.S. government assumed control of Puerto Rico in 1901, it initiated legal reforms resulting in the adoption of codes of criminal law, criminal procedure, and civil procedure modeled after those then in effect in California. Although Puerto Rico has since followed the federal example of transferring criminal and civil procedure from statutory law to rules promulgated by the judiciary, several portions of its criminal law still reflect the influence of the California Penal Code. The judicial branch is headed by the chief justice of the Puerto Rico Supreme Court, which is the only appellate court required by the Constitution. All other courts are created by the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico.[150] There is also a Federal District Court for Puerto Rico, and someone accused of a criminal act at the federal level may not be accused for the same act in a Commonwealth court, and vice versa, since Puerto Rico as an unincorporated territory lacks sovereignty separate from Congress as a state does.[138] The U.S. Supreme Court held in 2016 that such a parallel accusation would constitute double jeopardy.[151] The homicide rate of 19.2 per 100,000 inhabitants was significantly higher than any U.S. state in 2014.[152][153] Most homicide victims are gang members and drug traffickers with about 80% of homicides in Puerto Rico being drug related.[154] In 1992, the FBI made armed carjacking a federal crime and rates decreased per statistics,[155] but as of 2019, the problem continued in municipalities like Guaynabo and others.[156][157][158][159][160] From 1 January 2019 to 14 March 2019, thirty carjackings had occurred on the island.[161] Puerto Rico is classified as a high income economy by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.[38] It is considered the most competitive economy in Latin America by the World Economic Forum and ranks highly on the Human Development Index. According to World Bank, gross national income per capita in Puerto Rico in 2020 was $21,740.[162] Puerto Rico's economy is mainly driven by manufacturing (primarily pharmaceuticals, textiles, petrochemicals and electronics) followed by services (primarily finance, insurance, real estate and tourism); agriculture represents less than 1% of GNP.[163][o][p] In recent years, it has also become a popular destination for MICE (meetings, incentives, conferencing, exhibitions), with a modern convention center district overlooking the Port of San Juan.[164] Responsibility for San Juan port inspections lies with PPQ.[165] So high is the volume of cargo traffic that between 1984–2000 the San Juan PPQ station recorded 7.74% of all interceptions, #4 in the country, #2 for insects and #3 for pathogens.[165] Most species are originally from South America or elsewhere in the Caribbean due to PR's position as an intermediary on the way to the mainland.[165] This is one of the worst locations for cut flowers and other plant parts – both in terms of number of problems and diversity of species – for insects in plant parts in baggage, and for pathogens in plant parts in baggage and cargo.[165] Pathogen interceptions were dramatically (17%) higher 1999–2000 than in 1985–1986.[165] Puerto Rico's geography and political status are both determining factors for its economic prosperity, primarily due to its relatively small size; lack of natural resources and subsequent dependence on imports; and vulnerability to U.S. foreign policy and trading restrictions, particularly concerning its shipping industry. Puerto Rico experienced a recession from 2006 to 2011, interrupted by four quarters of economic growth, and entered into recession again in 2013, following growing fiscal imbalance and the expiration of the IRS Section 936 corporate incentives that the U.S. Internal Revenue Code had applied to Puerto Rico. This IRS section was critical to the economy, as it established tax exemptions for U.S. corporations that settled in Puerto Rico and allowed their insular subsidiaries to send their earnings to the parent corporation at any time, without paying federal tax on corporate income. Puerto Rico has been able to maintain a relatively low inflation in the past decade while maintaining a purchasing power parity per capita higher than 80% of the rest of the world.[166] Academically, most of Puerto Rico's economic woes stem from federal regulations that expired, have been repealed, or no longer apply to Puerto Rico; its inability to become self-sufficient and self-sustainable throughout history;[q] its highly politicized public policy which tends to change whenever a political party gains power;[r] as well as its highly inefficient local government[s][t] which has accrued a public debt equal to 68% of its gross domestic product throughout time.[u][v] Puerto Rico currently has a public debt of $72.204 billion (equivalent to 103% of GNP), and a government deficit of $2.5 billion.[172][173] By American standards, Puerto Rico is underdeveloped: It is poorer than Mississippi, the poorest state of the U.S., with 41% of its population below the poverty line.[w] However, it has the highest GDP per capita in Latin America. Puerto Rico's main trading partners are the United States, Ireland, and Japan, with most products coming from East Asia, mainly China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. Puerto Rico's dependency on oil for transportation and electricity generation, as well as its dependency on food imports and raw materials, makes Puerto Rico volatile and highly reactive to changes in the world economy and climate. Tourism in Puerto Rico is also an important part of the economy. In 2017, Hurricane Maria caused severe damage to the island and its infrastructure, disrupting tourism for many months. The damage was estimated at $100 billion. An April 2019 report indicated that by that time, only a few hotels were still closed, that life for tourists in and around the capital had, for the most part, returned to normal.[175] By October 2019, nearly all of the popular amenities for tourists, in the major destinations such as San Juan, Ponce and Arecibo, were in operation on the island and tourism was rebounding. This was important for the economy, since tourism provides up to 10% of Puerto Rico's GDP, according to Discover Puerto Rico.[176] A tourism campaign was launched by Discover Puerto Rico in 2018 intended to highlight the island's culture and history, branding it distinct, and different from other Caribbean destinations. In 2019, Discover Puerto Rico planned to continue that campaign.[177] In early 2017, the Puerto Rican government-debt crisis posed serious problems for the government which was saddled with outstanding bond debt that had climbed to $70 billion.[178] The debt had been increasing during a decade-long recession.[179] The Commonwealth had been defaulting on many debts, including bonds, since 2015. With debt payments due, the governor was facing the risk of a government shutdown and failure to fund the managed health care system.[180][181] \"Without action before April, Puerto Rico's ability to execute contracts for Fiscal Year 2018 with its managed care organizations will be threatened, thereby putting at risk beginning July 1, 2017 the health care of up to 900,000 poor U.S. citizens living in Puerto Rico\", according to a letter sent to Congress by the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Health and Human Services. They also said that \"Congress must enact measures recommended by both Republicans and Democrats that fix Puerto Rico's inequitable health care financing structure and promote sustained economic growth.\"[181] Initially, the oversight board created under PROMESA called for Puerto Rico's governor Ricardo Rosselló to deliver a fiscal turnaround plan by 28 January. Just before that deadline, the control board gave the Commonwealth government until 28 February to present a fiscal plan (including negotiations with creditors for restructuring debt) to solve the problems. A moratorium on lawsuits by debtors was extended to 31 May.[179] It is essential for Puerto Rico to reach restructuring deals to avoid a bankruptcy-like process under PROMESA.[182] An internal survey conducted by the Puerto Rican Economists Association revealed that the majority of Puerto Rican economists reject the policy recommendations of the Board and the Rosselló government, with more than 80% of economists arguing in favor of auditing the debt.[183] In early August 2017, the island's financial oversight board (created by PROMESA) planned to institute two days off without pay per month for government employees, down from the original plan of four days per month; the latter had been expected to achieve $218 million in savings. Governor Rossello rejected this plan as unjustified and unnecessary. Pension reforms were also discussed including a proposal for a 10% reduction in benefits to begin addressing the $50 billion in unfunded pension liabilities.[184] Puerto Rico has an operating budget of about U.S.$9.8 billion with expenses at about $10.4 billion, creating a structural deficit of $775 million (about 7.9% of the budget).[185] The practice of approving budgets with a structural deficit has been done for 24 consecutive years starting in 2000. Throughout those years, including present time, all budgets contemplated issuing bonds to cover these projected deficits rather than making structural adjustments. This practice increased Puerto Rico's cumulative debt, as the government had already been issuing bonds to balance its actual budget for four decades beginning in 1973.[x][187] Projected deficits added substantial burdens to an already indebted nation which accrued a public debt of $71B or about 70% of Puerto Rico's gross domestic product. This sparked an ongoing government-debt crisis after Puerto Rico's general obligation bonds were downgraded to speculative non-investment grade (\"junk status\") by three credit-rating agencies. In terms of financial control, almost 9.6%—or about $1.5 billion—of Puerto Rico's central government budget expenses for FY2014 is expected to be spent on debt service.[y] Harsher budget cuts are expected as Puerto Rico must now repay larger chunks of debts in the coming years.[needs update] For practical reasons the budget is divided into two aspects: a \"general budget\" which comprises the assignments funded exclusively by the Department of Treasury of Puerto Rico, and the \"consolidated budget\" which comprises the assignments funded by the general budget, by Puerto Rico's government-owned corporations, by revenue expected from loans, by the sale of government bonds, by subsidies extended by the federal government of the United States, and by other funds. Both budgets contrast each other drastically, with the consolidated budget being usually thrice the size of the general budget; currently $29B and $9.0B respectively. Almost one out of every four dollars in the consolidated budget comes from U.S. federal subsidies while government-owned corporations compose more than 31% of the consolidated budget. The critical aspects come from the sale of bonds, which comprise 7% of the consolidated budget – a ratio that increased annually due to the government's inability to prepare a balanced budget in addition to being incapable of generating enough income to cover all its expenses. In particular, the government-owned corporations add a heavy burden to the overall budget and public debt, as none is self-sufficient. For example, in FY2011 the government-owned corporations reported aggregated losses of more than $1.3B with the Puerto Rico Highways and Transportation Authority (PRHTA) reporting losses of $409M, the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA; the government monopoly that controls all electricity on the island) reporting losses of $272M, while the Puerto Rico Aqueducts and Sewers Authority (PRASA; the government monopoly that controls all water utilities on the island) reported losses of $112M.[189] Losses by government-owned corporations have been defrayed through the issuance of bonds compounding more than 40% of Puerto Rico's entire public debt today.[190] Holistically, from FY2000–FY2010 Puerto Rico's debt grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9% while GDP remained stagnant.[191] This has not always provided a long-term solution. In early July 2017 for example, the PREPA power authority was effectively bankrupt after defaulting in a plan to restructure $9 billion in bond debt; the agency planned to seek Court protection.[192] The cost of living in Puerto Rico is high and has increased over the past decade.[z][194][195][196][197][198][199][200] Statistics used for cost of living sometimes do not take into account certain costs, such as the high cost of electricity, which has hovered in the 24¢ to 30¢ range per kilowatt-hour, two to three times the national average, increased travel costs for longer flights, additional shipping fees, and the loss of promotional participation opportunities for customers \"outside the continental United States\". While some online stores do offer free shipping on orders to Puerto Rico, many merchants exclude Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories. The household median income is stated as $19,350 and the mean income as $30,463 in the U.S. Census Bureau's 2015 update. The report also indicates that 45.5% of individuals are below the poverty level.[201] The median home value in Puerto Rico ranges from U.S.$100,000 to U.S.$214,000, while the national median home value sits at $119,600.[aa] One of the most cited contributors to the high cost of living in Puerto Rico is the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, also known as the Jones Act, which prevents foreign-flagged ships from carrying cargo between two American ports, a practice known as cabotage.[203] Because of the Jones Act, foreign ships inbound with goods from Central and South America, Western Europe, and Africa cannot stop in Puerto Rico, offload Puerto Rico-bound goods, load mainland-bound Puerto Rico-manufactured goods, and continue to U.S. ports. Instead, they must proceed directly to U.S. ports, where distributors break bulk and send Puerto Rico-bound manufactured goods to Puerto Rico across the ocean by U.S.-flagged ships.[203] The local government of Puerto Rico has requested several times to the U.S. Congress to exclude Puerto Rico from the Jones Act restrictions without success.[ab] In 2013 the Government Accountability Office published a report which concluded that \"repealing or amending the Jones Act cabotage law might cut Puerto Rico shipping costs\" and that \"shippers believed that opening the trade to non-U.S.-flag competition could lower costs\".[ac][ad] Ultimately, the report concluded that \"[the] effects of modifying the application of the Jones Act for Puerto Rico are highly uncertain\" for both Puerto Rico and the U.S., particularly for the U.S. shipping industry and the military preparedness of the U.S.[205][206] A 2018 study by economists at Boston-based Reeve & Associates and Puerto Rico-based Estudios Tecnicos has concluded that the 1920 Jones Act has no impact on either retail prices or the cost of living on Puerto Rico.[207] Cities and towns in Puerto Rico are interconnected by a system of roads, freeways, expressways, and highways maintained by the Highways and Transportation Authority under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of Transportation, and patrolled by the Puerto Rico Police Department. The island's San Juan metropolitan area is served by a public bus transit system and a metro system called Tren Urbano ('Urban Train'). Other forms of Puerto Rican public transport include seaborne ferries that serve Puerto Rico's archipelago as well as carros públicos (private mini buses). Puerto Rico has three international airports, the Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport in Carolina, Mercedita International Airport in Ponce, and the Rafael Hernández International Airport in Aguadilla, and 27 local airports. The Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport is the largest aerial transportation hub in the Caribbean.[208] Puerto Rico has nine ports in different cities across the main island. The San Juan Port is the largest in Puerto Rico, and the busiest port in the Caribbean and the 10th busiest in the United States in terms of commercial activity and cargo movement, respectively.[208] The second largest port is the Port of the Americas in Ponce, currently under expansion to increase cargo capacity to 1.5 million twenty-foot containers (TEUs) per year.[209] The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA, Spanish: Autoridad de Energía Eléctrica, AEE)—is an electric power company and the government-owned corporation of Puerto Rico responsible for electricity generation, power transmission, and power distribution in Puerto Rico.[210] PREPA was, by law, the only entity authorized to conduct such business in Puerto Rico, effectively making it a government monopoly until 2018. The Authority is ruled by a governing board appointed by the governor with the advice and consent of the Senate of Puerto Rico, and is run by an executive director. On 20 July 2018, Puerto Rico Law 120-2018 (Ley para Transformar el Sistema Eléctrico de Puerto Rico) was signed. This law authorized PREPA to sell infrastructure and services to other providers. As a result, a contract was signed on 22 June 2020, making LUMA Energy the new operator of the energy distribution and transmission infrastructure, as well as other areas of PREPA's operations, in effect partially privatizing the Puerto Rican power grid. The takeover was set for 1 June 2021, amidst protests and uncertainty from the point of view of the general public and the former-PREPA workers and union members.[211][212] Similarly, the Puerto Rico Aqueducts and Sewers Authority (PRASA, Spanish: Autoridad de Acueductos y Alcantarillados, AAA)—is a water company and the government-owned corporation responsible for water quality, management, and supply in Puerto Rico.[213] It is the only entity authorized to conduct such business in Puerto Rico, effectively making it a government monopoly. Its existence is designated by Law No. 40 of 1 May 1945, including the corresponding amendments.[214] Telecommunications in Puerto Rico includes radio, television, fixed and mobile telephones, and the Internet. Broadcasting in Puerto Rico is regulated by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC).[215] As of 2007[update], there were 30 TV stations, 125 radio stations and roughly 1 million TV sets on the island. Cable TV subscription services are available, and the U.S. Armed Forces Radio and Television Service also broadcast on the island.[216] Puerto Rico also has its own amateur radio prefixes, which differ from those of the contiguous United States in that there are two letter before the number. The most well-known prefix is KP4, but others separated for use on the archipelago (including Desecheo and Mona) are: KP3/KP4/NP3/NP4/WP3/WP4 (Puerto Rico, Vieques and Culebra) and KP5/NP5/WP5 (Desecheo Island).[217] Amateur radio operators (also known as ham radio operators) are a well-known group in the island and can obtain special vehicle license plates with their callsign on them.[218] They have been a key element in disaster relief.[219] The population of Puerto Rico reflects influences from initial Amerindian settlement, European colonization, slavery, economic migration, and the archipelago's status as unincorporated territory of the United States. Puerto Ricans are characterized by a high degree of ethnic and cultural diversity, as well as a long history of intermarriage and acculturation among different demographics; racial and ethnic identity is subsequently complex and often nebulous, shaped by the broader attitudes and policies of the Spanish colonial period, 20th century American racial politics, and modern trends in cultural and identity in the 21st century United States.[221] According to the most recent 2020 United States Census, Puerto Rico had 3,285,874 residents, an 11.8% decrease since 2010.[16] The commonwealth's population peaked in 2000, when it was 3,808,610, before declining (for the first time in census history) to 3,725,789 in 2010.[222] Emigration due to economic difficulties and natural disasters, coupled with a low birth rate, have resulted in continued population decline into the 21st century.[223] The most populous municipality is the capital, San Juan, with 342,259 people based on the 2020 Census.[224] Other major cities include Bayamón, Carolina, Ponce, and Caguas. Of the ten most populous cities on the island, eight are located within what is considered San Juan's metropolitan area, while the other two are located in the south (Ponce) and west (Mayagüez) of the island. As of 2020, Hispanic or Latinos made up 98.9 percent of the population, of which 95.5 percent were Puerto Rican and 3.4% were Hispanic of non-Puerto Rican origins; only 1.1 percent of the population was non-Hispanic.[226] Fewer than one-fifth of people (17.1 percent) identified as \"White\", a decline of almost 80 percent; by contrast, nearly half of Puerto Ricans (49.8 percent) reported being multiracial—compared to just 3 percent in 2010—while roughly one-quarter chose \"some other race alone\" (25.5 percent).[221] Censuses of Puerto Rico were completed by Spain in 1765, 1775, 1800, 1815, 1832, 1846 and 1857, yet some of the data remained untabulated and were considered reliable in a 1943 report by Irene Barnes Taeuber, an American demographer at the Office of Population Research at Princeton University.[227] Continuous European immigration and high natural increase helped the population of Puerto Rico grow from 155,426 in 1800 to almost a million by the end of the 19th century. A census conducted by royal decree on 30 September 1858 gave the following totals of the Puerto Rican population at that time: 341,015 were free colored; 300,430 were white; and 41,736 were slaves.[228] A census in 1887 found a population of around 800,000, of which 320,000 were black.[229] During the 19th century, hundreds of families arrived in Puerto Rico, primarily from the Canary Islands and Andalusia, but also from other parts of Spain such as Catalonia, Asturias, Galicia and the Balearic Islands; they were later joined by numerous Spanish loyalists from Spain's former colonies in South America. There were also smaller numbers of settlers from outside Spain, including from Corsica, France, Lebanon, Portugal, Ireland, Scotland, Germany and Italy; this immigration from non-Hispanic countries was largely the result of the Real Cédula de Gracias de 1815 (Royal Decree of Graces of 1815), which provided European Catholics with land allotments in the sparsely inhabited interior of the island, provided they paid taxes and continued to support the Catholic Church. Between 1960 and 1990, the census questionnaire in Puerto Rico did not ask about race or ethnicity. The 2000 United States Census included a racial self-identification question in Puerto Rico, according to which most Puerto Ricans identified as white and Latino and few identified as black or some other race. Although less than one percent of the population identifies as indigenous, a large proportion of Puerto Ricans have native ancestry: A 2003 study by the University of Puerto Rico,[230] which took genetic samples from 800 randomly selected subjects throughout the island, found that 61.1 percent of those surveyed had mitochondrial DNA of indigenous origin; additionally, 26.4 percent had African markers and 12.5 percent showed European descent.[231] The study reportedly resulted in a resurgence of indigenous and Taino identity among Puerto Ricans; in the 2010 census, 19,839 respondents identified as \"American Indian or Alaskan Native\", an increase of almost 49 percent from 2000 count.[231] The vast majority of recent immigrants, both legal and illegal, come from Latin America, over half come from the Dominican Republic. Dominicans represent 53% of non-Puerto Rican Hispanics, about 1.8% of Puerto Rico's population.[193] Some illegal immigrants, particularly from Haiti, Dominican Republic,[232][233] and Cuba[citation needed], use Puerto Rico as a temporary stop-over point to get to the U.S. mainland. Other major sources of recent immigrants include Cuba, Colombia, Mexico, Venezuela, Haiti, Honduras, Panama, Ecuador, Spain, and Jamaica.[234][235] Additionally, there are many non-Puerto Rican U.S. citizens settling in Puerto Rico from the U.S. mainland, majority of which are White Americans and a smaller number are Black Americans. In fact, non-hispanic people represent 1.1% and majority of them are from the U.S. mainland. Smaller numbers of U.S. citizens come from the U.S. Virgin Islands. There are also large numbers of Nuyoricans and other stateside Puerto Ricans coming back, as many Puerto Ricans engage in 'circular migration'.[236] Small numbers of non-Puerto Rican Hispanics in Puerto Rico are actually American-born migrants from the mainland U.S. and not recent immigrants. Most recent immigrants settle in and around the San Juan metropolitan area. Emigration is a major part of contemporary Puerto Rican history. Starting soon after World War II, poverty, cheap airfares, and promotion by the island government caused waves of Puerto Ricans to move to the U.S. mainland, particularly to the northeastern states and nearby Florida.[237] This trend continued even as Puerto Rico's economy improved and its birth rate declined. Puerto Ricans continue to follow a pattern of \"circular migration\", with some migrants returning to the island. In recent years, the population has declined markedly, falling nearly 1% in 2012 and an additional 1% (36,000 people) in 2013 due to a falling birthrate and emigration.[238] The impact of hurricanes Maria and Irma in 2017, combined with the unincorporated territory's worsening economy, led to its greatest population decline since the U.S. acquired the archipelago. According to the 2020 U.S. census, the number of Puerto Ricans living outside of Puerto Rico in the U.S. is almost twice as many as those living in Puerto Rico.[239] As those who leave tend to be better educated than those who remain, this accentuates the drain on Puerto Rico's economy. Based on 1 July 2019 estimate by the U.S. Census Bureau, the population of the Commonwealth had declined by 532,095 people since the 2010 Census data had been tabulated.[240] The official languages[241] of the executive branch of government of Puerto Rico[242] are Spanish and English, with Spanish being the primary language. Spanish is, and has been, the only official language of the entire Commonwealth judiciary system, despite a 1902 English-only language law.[243] However, all official business of the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico is conducted in English. English is the primary language of less than 10% of the population. Spanish is the dominant language of business, education and daily life on the island, spoken by nearly 95% of the population.[244] Out of people aged five and older, 94.3% speak only Spanish at home, 5.5% speak English, and 0.2% speak other languages.[2] A Pew Research survey indicated an adult literacy rate of 90.4% in 2012 based on data from the United Nations.[245] In Puerto Rico, public school instruction is conducted almost entirely in Spanish. There have been pilot programs in about a dozen of the over 1,400 public schools aimed at conducting instruction in English only. Objections from teaching staff are common, perhaps because many of them are not fully fluent in English.[246] English is taught as a second language and is a compulsory subject from elementary levels to high school. The languages of the deaf community are American Sign Language and its local variant, Puerto Rican Sign Language. The Spanish of Puerto Rico has evolved into having many idiosyncrasies in vocabulary and syntax that differentiate it from the Spanish spoken elsewhere. Puerto Rican Spanish utilizes many Taíno words, as well as English words. The largest influence on the Spanish spoken in Puerto Rico is that of the Canary Islands. Taíno loanwords are most often used in the context of vegetation, natural phenomena, and native musical instruments. Similarly, words attributed to primarily West African languages were adopted in the contexts of foods, music, and dances, particularly in coastal towns with concentrations of descendants of Sub-Saharan Africans.[247] Religious affiliation in Puerto Rico (2014)[248][249] Christianity is the dominant religion in Puerto Rico. Catholicism was brought by Spanish colonists and gradually became the prevailing faith. The first dioceses in the Americas, including that of Puerto Rico, were authorized by Pope Julius II in 1511.[250] In 1512, priests were established for the parochial churches. By 1759, there was a priest for each church.[251] One Pope, John Paul II, visited Puerto Rico in October 1984. All municipalities in Puerto Rico have at least one Catholic church, most of which are located at the town center, or plaza. Protestantism, which was suppressed under the Spanish Catholic regime, reemerged under U.S. rule, making contemporary Puerto Rico more interconfessional than in previous centuries, although Catholicism continues to be the dominant religion. The first Protestant church, Iglesia de la Santísima Trinidad, was established in Ponce by the Anglican Diocese of Antigua in 1872.[252] It was the first non-Catholic church in the entire Spanish Empire in the Americas.[253][254] Sources differ on the denominational breakdown of the population. Pollster Pablo Ramos stated in 1998 that the population was 38 percent Catholic, 28 percent Pentecostal, and 18 percent independent churches; the total number of Protestants collectively added up to almost two million people, or 46 percent of the population. Another researcher gave a more conservative assessment of the proportion of Protestants in 1997, finding a Protestant population of approximately 33 to 38 percent, the majority of whom are Pentecostal; however, it estimated that Puerto Rico would become 75 percent evangelical by 2022.[255] A 2014 Pew Research report found that only 56% of Puerto Ricans were Catholic, while 33% were Protestant and 8% were unaffiliated;[256][245] these figures are shared by the CIA World Factbook, which further notes that Protestants are \"largely Pentecostal\", while other religions make up 2 percent and atheists only one percent.[257] Pew Research from the year before, which surveyed Puerto Ricans living in the mainland United States, found that only about 45% of Puerto Rican adults identified themselves as Catholic, 29% as Protestant and 20% as unaffiliated with a religion.[258] By contrast, an Associated Press article in March 2014 stated that \"more than 70 percent\" of Puerto Ricans identified as Catholic.[259] There is a small Eastern Orthodox community, centered mostly around two Eastern Orthodox Churches in the territory: the Russian Orthodox mission of Saint John Climacus in San German and the Saint George Antiochian Orthodox Church in Carolina; both have services in English and Spanish.[260][261] There is a small Syriac Orthodox church in Aguada, which represents the only Oriental Orthodox denomination in the Island. Orthodox Christians accounted for one percent of the population in 2010.[262] In 2017, the first Eastern Catholic Church was established in Puerto Rico.[263][264] In 2023, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints dedicated a temple in San Juan,[265] and reported having a membership of approximately 23,000 in the commonwealth.[266] In 2015, the 25,832 Jehovah's Witnesses represented about 0.70% of the population, with 324 congregations.[267] Puerto Rico has the largest Jewish community in the Caribbean, at roughly 3,000,[268] and is the only Caribbean island where Conservative, Reform and Orthodox Jewish movements are all represented.[269][270] The island's first synagogue, Sha'are Zedeck, was established in 1952 by American Jews.[271][272][269] In 2007, there were about 5,000 Muslims in Puerto Rico, representing about 0.13% of the population.[273][274] Eight mosques are located throughout the island, with most Muslims living in Río Piedras and Caguas; most Muslims are of Palestinian and Jordanian descent.[275][276] There is also a Baháʼí community.[277] Buddhism in Puerto Rico is represented with Nichiren, Zen and Tibetan Buddhism, with the New York Padmasambhava Buddhist Center for example having a branch in San Juan.[278] There are several atheist activist and educational organizations, and an atheistic parody religion called the Pastafarian Church of Puerto Rico.[279] An ISKCON temple in Gurabo is devoted to Krishna, with two preaching centers in the San Juan metropolitan area. Taíno religious practices have been rediscovered and reinvented to some degree by a handful of advocates.[280] Similarly, some aspects of African religious traditions have persisted, as African slaves maintained various ethnic African religious practices associated with different peoples; in particular, the Yoruba beliefs of Santería or Ifá, and the Kongo-derived Palo Mayombe. Some indigenous and African practices and beliefs are syncretized with Christianity. In 1940, Juanita García Peraza founded the Mita Congregation, the first religion of Puerto Rican origin.[281] The first school in Puerto Rico was the Escuela de Gramática (Grammar School). It was established by Bishop Alonso Manso in 1513, in the area where the Cathedral of San Juan was to be constructed. The school was free of charge and the courses taught were Latin language, literature, history, science, art, philosophy and theology.[282] Education in Puerto Rico is divided in three levels—Primary (elementary school grades 1–6), Secondary (intermediate and high school grades 7–12), and Higher Level (undergraduate and graduate studies). As of 2002, the literacy rate of the Puerto Rican population was 94.1%; by gender, it was 93.9% for males and 94.4% for females.[283] According to the 2000 Census, 60.0% of the population attained a high school degree or higher level of education, and 18.3% has a bachelor's degree or higher. Instruction at the primary school level is compulsory between the ages of 5 and 18. As of 2010[update], there are 1539 public schools and 806 private schools.[284] The largest and oldest university system is the public University of Puerto Rico (UPR) with 11 campuses. The largest private university systems on the island are the Sistema Universitario Ana G. Mendez which operates the Universidad del Turabo, Metropolitan University and Universidad del Este. Other private universities include the multi-campus Inter American University, the Pontifical Catholic University, Universidad Politécnica de Puerto Rico, and the Universidad del Sagrado Corazón. Puerto Rico has four schools of Medicine and three ABA-approved Law Schools. In 2017, there were 69 hospitals in Puerto Rico.[285] As of 2021, average life expectancy is approximately 82.1 years according to the CIA World Factbook, an improvement from 78.7 years in 2010.[286] Reforma de Salud de Puerto Rico (Puerto Rico Health Reform) – locally referred to as La Reforma ('The Reform') – is a government-run program which provides medical and health care services to the indigent and impoverished, by means of contracting private health insurance companies, rather than employing government-owned hospitals and emergency centers. The Reform is administered by the Puerto Rico Health Insurance Administration.[287] Modern Puerto Rican culture is a unique mix of cultural antecedents: including European (predominantly Spanish, Italian, French, German and Irish), African, and, more recently, some North American and many South Americans. Many Cubans and Dominicans have relocated to the island in the past few decades. From the Spanish, Puerto Rico received the Spanish language, the Catholic religion and the vast majority of their cultural and moral values and traditions. The United States added English-language influence, the university system and the adoption of some holidays and practices. On 12 March 1903, the University of Puerto Rico was officially founded, branching out from the \"Escuela Normal Industrial\", a smaller organization that was founded in Fajardo three years earlier. Much of Puerto Rican culture centers on the influence of music and has been shaped by other cultures combining with local and traditional rhythms. Early in the history of Puerto Rican music, the influences of Spanish and African traditions were most noticeable. The cultural movements across the Caribbean and North America have played a vital role in the more recent musical influences which have reached Puerto Rico.[288][289] Puerto Rico has many symbols, but only the Flor de Maga has been made official by the Government of Puerto Rico.[290] Other popular, traditional, or unofficial symbols of Puerto Rico are the Puerto Rican spindalis, the kapok tree, the coquí frog, the jíbaro, the Taíno Indian, and Cerro Las Tetas with its jíbaro culture monument.[291][292] The architecture of Puerto Rico demonstrates a broad variety of traditions, styles and national influences accumulated over four centuries of Spanish rule, and a century of American rule. Spanish colonial architecture, Ibero-Islamic, art deco, post-modern, and many other architectural forms are visible throughout the island. From town to town, there are also many regional distinctions. Old San Juan is one of the two barrios, in addition to Santurce, that made up the municipality of San Juan from 1864 to 1951, at which time the former independent municipality of Río Piedras was annexed. With its abundance of shops, historic places, museums, open air cafés, restaurants, gracious homes, tree-shaded plazas, and its old beauty and architectonical peculiarity, Old San Juan is a main spot for local and internal tourism. The district is also characterized by numerous public plazas and churches including San José Church and the Cathedral of San Juan Bautista, which contains the tomb of the Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de León. It also houses the oldest Catholic school for elementary education in Puerto Rico, the Colegio de Párvulos, built in 1865. The oldest parts of the district of Old San Juan remain partly enclosed by massive walls. Several defensive structures and notable forts, such as the emblematic Fort San Felipe del Morro, Fort San Cristóbal, and El Palacio de Santa Catalina, also known as La Fortaleza, acted as the primary defenses of the settlement which was subjected to numerous attacks. La Fortaleza continues to serve also as the executive mansion for the governor of Puerto Rico. Many of the historic fortifications are part of San Juan National Historic Site. During the 1940s, sections of Old San Juan fell into disrepair, and many renovation plans were suggested. There was even a strong push to develop Old San Juan as a \"small Manhattan\". Strict remodeling codes were implemented to prevent new constructions from affecting the common colonial Spanish architectural themes of the old city. When a project proposal suggested that the old Carmelite Convent in San Juan be demolished to erect a new hotel, the Institute had the building declared as a historic building, and then asked that it be converted to a hotel in a renewed facility. This was what became the Hotel El Convento in Old San Juan. The paradigm to reconstruct and renovate the old city and revitalize it has been followed by other cities in the Americas, particularly Havana, Lima and Cartagena de Indias. Ponce Creole is a unique architectural style created in Ponce, Puerto Rico, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. This style of Puerto Rican buildings is found predominantly in residential homes in Ponce that developed between 1895 and 1920. Ponce Creole architecture borrows heavily from the traditions of France, Spain and the Caribbean vernacular to create houses that were especially built to withstand the hot and dry climate of the region, and to take advantage of the sun and sea breezes characteristic of the southern Puerto Rico's Caribbean Sea coast.[293] It is a blend of wood and masonry, incorporating architectural elements of other styles, from Classical revival and Spanish Revival to Victorian.[294] Puerto Rican art reflects many influences, much from its ethnically diverse background. A form of folk art, called santos evolved from the Catholic Church's use of sculptures to convert indigenous Puerto Ricans to Christianity. Santos depict figures of saints and other religious icons and are made from native wood, clay, and stone. After shaping simple, they are often finished by painting them in vivid colors. Santos vary in size, with the smallest examples around eight inches tall and the largest about twenty inches tall. Traditionally, santos were seen as messengers between the earth and Heaven. As such, they occupied a special place on household altars, where people prayed to them, asked for help, or tried to summon their protection. Also popular, caretas or vejigantes are masks worn during carnivals. Similar masks signifying evil spirits were used in both Spain and Africa, though for different purposes. The Spanish used their masks to frighten lapsed Christians into returning to the church, while tribal Africans used them as protection from the evil spirits they represented. True to their historic origins, Puerto Rican caretas always bear at least several horns and fangs. While usually constructed of papier-mâché, coconut shells and fine metal screening are sometimes used as well. Red and black were the typical colors for caretas but their palette has expanded to include a wide variety of bright hues and patterns. Puerto Rican literature evolved from the art of oral story telling to its present-day status. Written works by the native islanders of Puerto Rico were prohibited and repressed by the Spanish colonial government. Only those who were commissioned by the Spanish Crown to document the chronological history of the island were allowed to write. Diego de Torres Vargas was allowed to circumvent this strict prohibition and in 1647 wrote Descripción de la Ciudad e Isla de Puerto Rico (\"Description of the Island and City of Puerto Rico\"). This historical book was the first to make a detailed geographic description of the island.[296] Some of Puerto Rico's earliest writers were influenced by the teachings of Rafael Cordero. Among these was Manuel A. Alonso, the first Puerto Rican writer of notable importance. In 1849 he published El Gíbaro, a collection of verses whose main themes were the poor Puerto Rican country farmer. Eugenio María de Hostos wrote La peregrinación de Bayoán in 1863, which used Bartolomé de las Casas as a springboard to reflect on Caribbean identity. After this first novel, Hostos abandoned fiction in favor of the essay which he saw as offering greater possibilities for inspiring social change. In the late 19th century, with the arrival of the first printing press and the founding of the Royal Academy of Belles Letters, Puerto Rican literature began to flourish. The first writers to express their political views in regard to Spanish colonial rule of the island were journalists. Alejandro Tapia y Rivera, also known as the Father of Puerto Rican Literature, ushered in a new age of historiography with the publication of The Historical Library of Puerto Rico. Cayetano Coll y Toste was another Puerto Rican historian and writer. His work The Indo-Antillano Vocabulary is valuable in understanding the way the Taínos lived. Manuel Zeno Gandía in 1894 wrote La Charca and talked about the harsh life in the remote and mountainous coffee regions in Puerto Rico. Antonio S. Pedreira, described in his work Insularismo the cultural survival of the Puerto Rican identity after the American invasion. With the Puerto Rican diaspora of the 1940s, Puerto Rican literature was greatly influenced by a phenomenon known as the Nuyorican Movement. Puerto Rican literature continued to flourish, and many Puerto Ricans have since distinguished themselves as authors, journalists, poets, novelists, playwrights, essayists, and screenwriters. The influence of Puerto Rican literature has transcended the boundaries of the island to the U.S. and the rest of the world. Over the past fifty years, significant writers include Ed Vega (Omaha Bigelow), Miguel Piñero (Short Eyes), Piri Thomas (Down These Mean Streets), Giannina Braschi (Yo-Yo Boing!), Rosario Ferrer (Eccentric Neighborhoods). and Esmeralda Santiago (When I was Puerto Rican).[297][298] The mass media in Puerto Rico includes local radio stations, television stations and newspapers, the majority of which are conducted in Spanish. There are also three stations of the U.S. Armed Forces Radio and Television Service. Newspapers with daily distribution are El Nuevo Día, El Vocero and Índice, Metro, and Primera Hora. El Vocero is distributed free of charge, as are Índice and Metro. Newspapers distributed on a weekly or regional basis include Claridad, La Perla del Sur, La Opinión, Visión, and La Estrella del Norte, among others. Several television channels provide local content in the island. These include WIPR-TV, Telemundo, Univision affiliate WLII-DT (Teleonce), WAPA-TV, and WKAQ-TV. The music of Puerto Rico has evolved as a heterogeneous and dynamic product of diverse cultural resources. The most conspicuous musical sources have been Spain and West Africa, although many aspects of Puerto Rican music reflect origins elsewhere in Europe and the Caribbean and, over the last century, from the U.S. Puerto Rican music culture today comprises a wide and rich variety of genres, ranging from indigenous genres like bomba, plena, aguinaldo, danza and the popular salsa to recent hybrids like reggaeton. Puerto Rico has some national instruments, like the cuatro (Spanish for \"four\"). The cuatro is a local instrument that was made by the \"Jibaro\" or people from the mountains. Originally, the Cuatro consisted of four steel strings, hence its name, but currently the Cuatro consists of five double steel strings. It is easily confused with a guitar, even by locals. When held upright, from right to left, the strings are G, D, A, E, B. In the realm of classical music, the island hosts two main orchestras, the Orquesta Sinfónica de Puerto Rico and the Orquesta Filarmónica de Puerto Rico. The Casals Festival takes place annually in San Juan, drawing in classical musicians from around the world. With respect to opera, the legendary Puerto Rican tenor Antonio Paoli was so celebrated, that he performed private recitals for Pope Pius X and Tsar Nicholas II of Russia. In 1907, Paoli was the first operatic artist in world history to record an entire opera – when he participated in a performance of Pagliacci by Ruggiero Leoncavallo in Milan, Italy. Puerto Rico has been commemorated on four U.S. postal stamps. Insular Territories were commemorated in 1937, the third stamp honored Puerto Rico featuring 'La Fortaleza', the Spanish Governor's Palace.[299] The first free election for governor of the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico was honored on 27 April 1949, at San Juan, Puerto Rico. 'Inauguration' on the 3-cent stamp refers to the election of Luis Muñoz Marín, the first democratically elected governor of Puerto Rico.[300] San Juan, Puerto Rico was commemorated with an 8-cent stamp on its 450th anniversary issued 12 September 1971, featuring a sentry box from Castillo San Felipe del Morro.[301] In the \"Flags of our nation series\" 2008–2012, of the fifty-five, five territorial flags were featured. Forever stamps included the Puerto Rico Flag illustrated by a bird issued 2011.[302] Puerto Rican cuisine has its roots in the cooking traditions and practices of Europe (Spain), Africa and the native Taínos. Basic ingredients include grains and legumes, herbs and spices, starchy tropical tubers, vegetables, meat and poultry, seafood and shellfish, and fruits. Main dishes include mofongo, arroz con gandules, pasteles, and pig roast (or lechón). Beverages include maví and piña colada. Desserts include flan, arroz con dulce (sweet rice pudding), piraguas, brazo gitanos, tembleque, polvorones, and dulce de leche. Baseball was one of the first sports to gain widespread popularity in Puerto Rico. The Puerto Rico Baseball League serves as the only active professional league, operating as a winter league. No Major League Baseball franchise or affiliate plays in Puerto Rico; however, San Juan hosted the Montreal Expos for several series in 2003 and 2004 before they moved to Washington, D.C., and became the Washington Nationals. The Puerto Rico national baseball team has participated in the World Cup of Baseball winning one gold (1951), four silver and four bronze medals, the Caribbean Series (winning fourteen times) and the World Baseball Classic. In March 2006, San Juan's Hiram Bithorn Stadium hosted the opening round as well as the second round of the newly formed World Baseball Classic. Puerto Rican baseball players include Hall of Famers Roberto Clemente, Orlando Cepeda and Roberto Alomar, enshrined in 1973, 1999, and 2011 respectively.[306][307][308] Boxing, basketball, and volleyball are considered popular sports as well. Wilfredo Gómez and McWilliams Arroyo have won their respective divisions at the World Amateur Boxing Championships. Other medalists include José Pedraza, who holds a silver medal, and three boxers who finished in third place, José Luis Vellón, Nelson Dieppa and McJoe Arroyo. In the professional circuit, Puerto Rico has the third-most boxing world champions and it is the global leader in champions per capita. These include Miguel Cotto, Félix Trinidad, Wilfred Benítez and Gómez among others. The Puerto Rico national basketball team joined the International Basketball Federation in 1957. Since then, it has won more than 30 medals in international competitions, including gold in three FIBA Americas Championships and the 1994 Goodwill Games 8 August 2004, became a landmark date for the team when it became the first team to defeat the United States in an Olympic tournament since the integration of National Basketball Association players. Winning the inaugural game with scores of 92–73 as part of the 2004 Summer Olympics organized in Athens, Greece.[309] Baloncesto Superior Nacional acts as the top-level professional basketball league in Puerto Rico and has experienced success since its beginning in 1930. Puerto Rico is also a member of FIFA and CONCACAF. In 2008, the archipelago's first unified league, the Puerto Rico Soccer League, was established. Other sports include professional wrestling and road running. The World Wrestling Council and International Wrestling Association are the largest wrestling promotions in the main island. The World's Best 10K, held annually in San Juan, has been ranked among the 20 most competitive races globally. The \"Puerto Rico All Stars\" team, which has won twelve world championships in unicycle basketball.[310] Organized Streetball has gathered some exposition, with teams like \"Puerto Rico Street Ball\" competing against established organizations including the Capitanes de Arecibo and AND1's Mixtape Tour Team. Six years after the first visit, AND1 returned as part of their renamed Live Tour, losing to the Puerto Rico Streetballers.[311] Consequently, practitioners of this style have earned participation in international teams, including Orlando \"El Gato\" Meléndez, who became the first Puerto Rican born athlete to play for the Harlem Globetrotters.[312] Puerto Rico has representation in all international competitions including the Summer and Winter Olympics, the Pan American Games, the Caribbean World Series, and the Central American and Caribbean Games. Puerto Rico hosted the Pan Am Games in 1979 (officially in San Juan), and The Central American and Caribbean Games were hosted in 1993 in Ponce and in 2010 in Mayagüez. Puerto Rican athletes have won ten medals in Olympic competition (two gold, two silver, six bronze), the first one in 1948 by boxer Juan Evangelista Venegas. Monica Puig won the first gold medal for Puerto Rico in the Olympic Games by winning the Women's Tennis singles title in Rio 2016.[313][314] 18°12′N 66°30′W﻿ / ﻿18.2°N 66.5°W﻿ / 18.2; -66.5﻿ (Commonwealth of Puerto Rico)",

                "content": "Puerto Rico, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (Spanish: Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico), is a U.S. territory in the Caribbean Sea.[20] This means that it belongs to the United States and citizens of Puerto Rico are citizens of the United States as well. Puerto Rico is not an independent country, but like all populated U.S. territories, it enjoys a greater degree of autonomy than U.S. states. There has been a movement for independence for almost two centuries. There have been protests, votes, and armed attacks for independence.[21][22][23] Puerto Rico has about 3.3 million (3,300,000) people. Its political system is based on a republican system. It has two official languages: Spanish and English, but Spanish is almost only used by the government, the legislature and the judiciary (courts). Spanish is also the main language of the school curriculum, though English is taught in all schools as a second language (from grade 1 to 12). Puerto Rico is one of two U.S. territories where the metric system is officially used and is dominant. (The other is Guam, which was also a Spanish colony. The metric system was introduced to both territories, before they became U.S. territories.)[24] Spanish is spoken by 94.7% of the population and English is spoken by 5.3% of the population as a mother language. The currency used is the United States dollar. The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico includes the largest, main island and a number of smaller islands, including Mona, Vieques, and Culebra. Of those three smaller islands, only Culebra and Vieques are populated all year. Mona is unpopulated, but employees of the Puerto Rico Department of Natural Resources sometimes visit the island to inspect it and its wildlife. People can visit the island for hiking and camping by getting the permission needed. San Juan, on the northern side of the main island, is the island's largest city and the capital of the territory. Puerto Rico means \"rich port\" in Spanish. On May 3, 2017, Puerto Rico filed for bankruptcy after a massive debt and weak economy.[25] It is the largest bankruptcy case in American history.[25] Puerto Rico is one of the unincorporated territories of the USA. These are organized, self-governing territories with locally elected governors and legislatures. Because it is not a state, its citizens can not vote in U.S. national elections unless they have an address in one of the 50 US states. Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens and can move to or from the 50 states. Puerto Rico elects a Resident Commissioner to the U.S. House of Representatives.[26] The history of Puerto Rico began when the Ortoiroid people started living in the island between 3000 and 2000 BC. Other tribes, for example the Saladoid and Arawak Indians, lived in the island between 430 BC and 1000 AD. When Christopher Columbus arrived at the island in 1492 and named it San Juan Bautista,[27] the people living there were the Taínos.[28][29] Since it is in the northeastern Caribbean Sea, Puerto Rico formed an important part of the Spanish Empire from the early years of the exploration, conquest, and colonization of the New World. The Spanish spread race-based slavery across the island. In the 19th century, slave revolts and the abolitionist movement brought an end to legal slavery.[30] The island was a major military post during many wars between Spain and other European countries for control of the region in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries. In 1898, during the Spanish-American war, Puerto Rico was invaded and became a possession of the United States. During the 20th century, Puerto Rico's political status changed from time to time. The Foraker Act of 1900 created a civil government to replace the military government made after the Spanish–American war, and the Jones Act of 1917 gave Puerto Rican people United States citizenship. Afterwards. In 1932, the name Porto Rico was changed to Puerto Rico. in 1952, the drafting of Puerto Rico's own Constitution and democratic elections were established. A 1948 law called the Ley de la Mordaza (Gag Law) made it illegal to speak in favor of Puerto Rican independence or even display the Puerto Rican flag. This law, implemented by the U.S. colonial government, was used to persecute and imprison Puerto Rican independence leaders, instilling fear in the population, and discouraging any form of nationalist and patriotic expression.[31] The political status of Puerto Rico, a Commonwealth controlled by the United States, is still not completely defined. Many people want to resolve this status, while others want the status to remain the same. Of the people who want to change the status, some want Puerto Rico to become a new U.S. state, while others want Puerto Rico to become a fully independent country. In May 2022, Members of Congress sponsoring competing bills on how to resolve Puerto Rico’s territorial status and its relationship to the U.S. have come together to introduce new legislation combining both. The proposed legislation combines elements of the pro-statehood bill introduced by Rep. Darren Soto, D-Fla., and Rep. Jenniffer Gonzalez, Puerto Rico’s nonvoting member of Congress and a Republican, alongside the Puerto Rico Self-Determination Act from Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Nydia Velázquez, both New York Democrats. The draft legislation says that a plebiscite to resolve Puerto Rico’s political status shall be held on November 5, 2023.[1] On December 15, 2022, the U.S. House of Representatives voted in favor of the Puerto Rico Status Act. The act sought to resolve Puerto Rico's status and its relationship to the United States through a binding plebiscite.[32] Puerto Rico is an archipelago, with a main island where most of the population lives, two smaller islands (Vieques and Culebra) with residents, and many other smaller islands. The main island has a mountain range in the center, which covers most of the island. The highest point is 4,390 feet (1,338 meters) Puerto Rico has three main political parties: the Puerto Rican Independence Party, which favors Puerto Rico becoming an independent nation; the New Progressive Party, which supports Puerto Rico's transition to becoming a state of the U.S; and the Popular Democratic Party, which supports Colonialism. The issue of the political status of the island (meaning whether it's a country, a U.S. state, or a colony) is an issue of debate amongst the Puerto Rican people. In the past there have been many attempts to clearly define the island's political status by means of voting. Most of the time the majority of the people have chosen to remain a colony. However, in the last \"status voting\" the colonial option appeared to have lost well over 90% of its support, while the U.S. state option has only gained strength in the last few decades. The Puerto Rican Independence party, on the other hand, has mainly lost a great deal of support within the last six decades (60 years). Puerto Rico is said to comprise a White majority, an extinct Amerindian population, persons of mixed ancestry, Africans and a small Asian minority. Recent genetic research, however, contradicts that information. According to the 2010 US Census, 99% of the population consider themselves of Puerto Rican descent (regardless of race or skin color), making Puerto Rico one of the most culturally unified societies in the world. The population of Puerto Rico is nearly about 4 million people. The ethnic composition of the population is: Puerto Rico has a strong literary tradition. The most important playwrights are René Marqués (author of \"The Oxcart\") and Lin Manuel Miranda (creator of the Broadway musical \"Hamilton\"). The most famous poets are Julia de Burgos (\"Yo fui mi ruta\")[33] and Giannina Braschi[34] (author the poetry epic \"Empire of Dreams\"). Celebrated Puerto Rican novelists include Rosario Ferre (Eccentric Neighborhoods), Giannina Braschi (United States of Banana), and Esmeralda Santiago (When I Was Puerto Rican).[35] Puerto Rican poets who live in New York are called Nuyorican poets. José Campeche (1751-1809) is the first known Puerto Rican painter.[36] He painted in the best rococo style. Franciso Oller painted Puerto Rican landscapes and still life paintings the 19th Century. In the 20th century Franciso Rodón who paints portraits of celebrities.[37] In the 21st century, Allora and Calzadilla are conceptual artists in San Juan, Puerto Rico.[38] Puerto Rico music is often called Latin music. There are many popular styes of Puerto Rican dance music, including Salsa, Bomba, Plena, and Reggaeton.[39] One of the most popular bands today is Calle 13.[40] World famous Puerto Rican singers include Jennifer Lopez, Hector Lavoe, Tito Puentes, and Marc Anthony. Ricky Martin won the 1999 Grammy Award for \"Best Latin Pop Performance\" for Living La Vida Loca.[39] Puerto Rican philosophy deals with Puerto Rican independence, education, racism, and liberty for all. The first major Puerto Rican philosopher was Eugenio María de Hostos.[41] He was born in the 19th Century in Puerto Rico. He believed that Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic and Cuba should unite to be free from Colonial powers. Francisco José Ramos was born in the 20th century. His philosophy deals with Ancient Greeks, American imperialism, and Buddhism.[42] Giannina Braschi is a contemporary political philosopher. She writes about freedom, immigration, revolution, and justice.[43] Braschi was inspired by a major Mexican woman philosopher Sor Juana Inez de la Cruz.[44] Puerto Rican philosophers are sometimes called Latinx philosophers or Latin American philosophers.",

The 111th annual Rose Bowl game will be one of the College Football Playoff (CFP) quarterfinals and will feature top-ranked Oregon and sixth-ranked Ohio State, both members of the Big Ten Conference. The game is scheduled to begin at 2:00 p.m. PST. The Rose Bowl will be one of the 2024–25 bowl games concluding the 2024 FBS football season.[2][3] Sponsored by the Prudential financial service company, the game is officially known as the College Football Playoff Quarterfinal at the 2025 Rose Bowl Game presented by Prudential. The 2025 Rose bowl is a quarterfinal game for the College Football Playoff (CFP).[4] Oregon, being the top-ranked team in the final CFP rankings and winner of the Big Ten Championship Game, received a bye in the new 12-team format of the CFP and was selected to play in the bowl game. Sixth-ranked Ohio State, the number eight seed in the tournament, defeated Tennessee in the first round, 42–17, to advance to this game. This will be the 12th all-time meeting between Ohio State and Oregon, as well as their first post-season meeting since the 2015 (inaugural) CFP National Championship game in Arlington, which Ohio State won 42–20.[5] It will also be their third meeting in the Rose Bowl, following the 1958 and 2010 editions of the game back when the game traditionally matched the Big Ten and Pac-12 (or their predecessors') champions against each other. The Buckeyes won both times, but the Ducks won the teams' meeting earlier in the season in Week 7 at Autzen Stadium 32–31.[5] The winner of the Rose Bowl will advance in the playoff to the Cotton Bowl Classic to face the winner of the Peach Bowl.[6] Following the 1958 Rose Bowl, a sapling of a yellow aesculus (buckeye tree), the namesake of the state of Ohio, was given to Oregon and planted outside the Lillis Business complex, where it still stands.[7] This will be the ninth Rose Bowl appearance for the Ducks, who enter the game with a 4–4 record in prior appearances.[8] Their most recent prior appearance was the 2020 game, a win over Wisconsin.[8] Oregon enters the game as the Big Ten Conference champions with an 13–0 record (9–0 in conference), their first season in the conference.[9] Ohio State is 9–7 in prior Rose Bowl appearances, with their last appearance coming in the 2022 edition, a three-point victory over Utah. The Buckeyes come into this game with an 11–2 record following their 42–17 first-round win over Tennessee.

                "title": "Georgia Bulldogs football - Wikipedia",
                "content": "The Georgia Bulldogs football program represents the University of Georgia in the sport of American football. The Bulldogs compete in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and the Southeastern Conference (SEC). They play their home games at historic Sanford Stadium on the university's Athens, Georgia, campus. Georgia claims four national championships, including three (1980, 2021, 2022) from the major wire-service: AP Poll and/or Coaches' Poll. The Bulldogs' other accomplishments include 17 conference championships, of which 15 are SEC championships, second-most in conference history, and appearances in 62 bowl games, second-most all-time. The program has also produced two Heisman Trophy winners, five number-one National Football League (NFL) draft picks, and many winners of other national awards. In addition to its storied history, the team is known for its unique traditions and rabid fan base, known as the \"Bulldog Nation.\" Georgia has won over 880 games in its history, placing them 9th all-time in wins and has finished in the Top 10 of the AP Poll 28 times, 15 of which were Top 5 finishes.[3] Georgia was a founding member of the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association, one of the first collegiate athletic conferences formed in the United States. Georgia participated in the SIAA from its establishment in 1895 until 1921. During its tenure in the SIAA, Georgia was conference co-champion in two years, 1896 and 1920.[4] In 1921, the Bulldogs, along with 12 other teams, left the SIAA and formed the Southern Conference.[5] During its time in the Southern Conference, the team never won a conference championship. In 1932, the Georgia Bulldogs left the Southern Conference to form and join the SEC, where Georgia has won the second-most SEC football championships, with 15, behind Alabama (27).[6][better source needed] Georgia has been selected eight times as national champions from NCAA-designated major selectors,[7] including three (1980, 2021, 2022) from the major wire-service: AP Poll and/or Coaches' Poll. Georgia claims four national championships (1942, 1980, 2021, and 2022).[8] † Other consensus selectors for 1980 included Berryman, Billingsley, Rothman, Football News, Helms, NCF, Poling, Sagarin (ELO-Chess), Sporting News†† Other consensus selectors for 2021 include AP, FWAA/NFF, USAT/AMWAY (Coaches) Claimed national championship Georgia has won a total of 17 conference championships, eleven outright and five shared. The school's 15 Southeastern Conference Championships rank it second all time in SEC history, behind only Alabama.[18] † Co-champions From 1992 through 2023, the SEC was divided into two divisions, the East and the West. Division champions were the representatives to the SEC Championship Game. Georgia won 13 SEC Eastern Division championships, and made 11 appearances during the divisional era. The Dawgs were 4–7 in those games. Twice, in 1992 and 2007, Georgia was the Eastern Division co-champion, but lost a tiebreaker for the right to appear in the championship game. † Co-champions The Bulldogs have played in 62 bowl games, second all-time. UGA has a bowl record of 38–21–3. Their 38 wins rank the Dawgs second all-time in bowl wins.[19] They have played in a record 18 different bowls including appearances in five of the New Year's Six Bowl Games (2 Rose, 5 Orange, 3 Cotton, 7 Peach, and 11 Sugar Bowls) and appearances in the 2018, 2022, and 2023 College Football Playoff National Championship. † New Year's Six bowl game Head coaches of the Bulldogs dating from 1892.[20][21][better source needed] The first mention of \"Bulldogs\" in association with Georgia athletics occurred on November 28, 1901, at the Georgia-Auburn football game played in Atlanta. The Georgia fans had a badge saying \"Eat `em Georgia\" and a picture of a bulldog tearing a piece of cloth; however, it was not until 1920 that the nickname \"Bulldog\" was used to describe the athletic teams at the University of Georgia. Traditionally, the choice of a Bulldog as the UGA mascot was attributed to the alma mater of its founder and first president, Abraham Baldwin, who graduated from Yale University.[23] Prior to that time, Georgia teams were usually known as the \"Red and Black.\" On November 3, 1920, Morgan Blake of the Atlanta Journal wrote a story about school nicknames and proposed: The Georgia Bulldogs would sound good because there is a certain dignity about a bulldog, as well as ferocity.[24] After a 0–0 tie with Virginia in Charlottesville on Nov. 6, 1920, Atlanta Constitution writer Cliff Wheatley used the name \"Bulldogs\" in his story five times. The name has been used ever since. Georgia's standard home uniform has not significantly changed since 1980, and consists of a red helmet with the trademarked oval G, red jerseys, and famous silver britches.[27] Wally Butts first introduced the \"silver britches\", as they are colloquially known, in 1939. When Vince Dooley became Georgia's head coach, he changed the team's home uniform to include white pants. The uniform was changed back to silver pants prior to the 1980 season, and has remained silver ever since.[27] Georgia's earliest helmet was grey leather, to which a red block \"G\" logo was added in 1961. The shirts were usually red, sometimes with various striping patterns. Their uniforms in the pre-World War II era varied at times, sometimes significantly. Photographic evidence suggests that black shirts, vests, and stripes of various patterns were worn at times over the years. Vince Dooley was the first to incorporate the oval \"G\" onto the helmet in 1964, as part of uniform changes that included adoption of a red helmet and white pants. Anne Donaldson, who graduated from Georgia with a BFA in commercial art and was married to Georgia assistant coach John Donaldson, was asked by Dooley to come up with a new helmet design to replace the previous silver helmet. Dooley liked the forward oriented stylized \"G\" Donaldson produced, and it was adopted by him. Since the Georgia \"G\" was similar to the Green Bay Packers' \"G\" already in use since 1961, Dooley cleared its use with the Packers organization.[30] The Packers hold the trademark on the \"G\" logo, and have granted limited permission to Georgia and Grambling State University to utilize a similar logo.[31] Prior to the 1980 season, the \"silver britches\" were re-added to Georgia's uniform with a red-white-black stripe down the side. Since the 1980 season, Georgia has utilized the same basic uniform concept. The sleeve stripes, trim colors, and font on Georgia's home and away jerseys have varied many times, but the home jerseys have remained generally red with white numbers, and away jerseys have remained generally white with black numbers. The most recent trim redesign occurred in 2005, when sleeve stripe patterns were dropped in favor of solid black jersey cuffs on the home jersey and solid red cuffs on the away jersey. Matte gray pants have also been used at times instead of \"true\" silver since 2004, mainly because the matte gray pants are of a lighter material. One of the things that make Georgia's uniform unique is its relative longevity, and the fact that it has very rarely changed over the years. There have been occasions, however, when alternate uniforms have been worn. The Bulldogs have three main football rivals: Auburn, Florida, and Georgia Tech. All three rivalries were first contested over 100 years ago, though the series records are disputed in two cases. Georgia does not include two games from 1943 and 1944 against Georgia Tech (both UGA losses) in its reckoning of the series record, because Georgia's players were in World War II and Georgia Tech's players were not. Georgia also includes a game against one of the four predecessor institutions of the modern University of Florida in 1904 (a Georgia win) that national sportswriters[36][37][38] and Florida's athletic association do not include. Georgia has long-standing football rivalries with other universities as well, with over 50 games against five additional teams. Georgia developed rivalries with the Tennessee Volunteers and South Carolina Gamecocks during divisional play in the SEC East from 1992-2023. From 1944 to 1965, the Bulldogs played each season against the Alabama Crimson Tide.[39] While the two bordering schools no longer play annually, they have faced off against each other in four SEC Championship Games and two College Football Playoff National Championships since 2010, bringing the once dormant rivalry back to prominence.[40] Georgia's oldest and longest-running rivalry is the series with Auburn, which dates to 1892. As it is the oldest rivalry still contested between teams in the South, the series is referred to by both schools as the \"Deep South's Oldest Rivalry\". Although historically close (the series was tied as recently as the 2014 matchup), Georgia has won 16 out of the last 19 matchups, including the last seven, and leads the series 64–56–8 through the 2023 season.[41] Although no longer contested annually, the series with Clemson dates to 1897. The two schools are separated by a mere 70 miles and played annually from 1962 to 1987. The rivalry took on national importance in the early 1980s, when both Georgia and Clemson won national titles and were consistently highly ranked. The rivalry is renewed on an intermittent basis, with the next matchup scheduled in 2029. Georgia leads the series 44–18–4 after the matchup in the 2024 season.[42] Played annually (except for two occasions) at the neutral-site of Jacksonville, Florida since 1933, the Georgia-Florida rivalry is known nationwide for its associated tailgating and pageantry, being referred to as \"The World's Largest Outdoor Cocktail Party\", although that name is no longer used officially. The Georgia-Florida rivalry annually carries importance in the SEC race as the two schools have combined for 23 appearances in the SEC Championship game. The series record is disputed, with Georgia claiming a lead of 57–44–2 through the 2024 season.[43] Dating to 1893, the series with the in-state Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets has traditionally been played as the final regular season game of the season and was historically Georgia's most important and fierce rivalry. Since 2000 Georgia has dominated the series, winning 18 out of 21 matchups, lessening the importance of the once-close series. Georgia leads the series 72–41–5 through the 2024 season.[44] The series with South Carolina dates to 1894. The border-rivalry gained importance when South Carolina joined the SEC in 1992, and gained intensity when former Florida coach, Steve Spurrier, coached the Gamecocks from 2006 to 2015. Georgia leads the series 55–19–2 through the 2023 season.[45] The series with Tennessee dates to 1899. The annual rivalry began in 1992 upon the creation of the SEC Eastern Division and annually plays an important role in deciding the division champion. Georgia and Tennessee are the third and second most winningest SEC programs behind only Alabama. Georgia leads the series 28–23–2 through the 2023 season.[46] The series with Vanderbilt dates to 1893. Georgia leads the series 61–20–2 through the 2023 season.[47] The series with Alabama dates to 1895. Alabama leads the series 43–26–4 through the 2023 season.[48] The Bulldogs have had 84 players selected to the All-America team through the 2019 season.[49]: 182–187 [obsolete source] Through the 2023 season, there have been 41 consensus selections of which 16 were unanimous.[50][obsolete source] While several players were selected in more than one year, only Frank Sinkwich, Herschel Walker, David Pollack, and Jarvis Jones were selected as consensus All-Americans more than once. † Consensus All-American ‡ Consensus All-American that was selected by a unanimous vote Five former Georgia players have been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.[52] Nineteen former Georgia players and coaches have been inducted in the College Football Hall of Fame.[27][53][54] In addition, one former player, Pat Dye, has been inducted into the Hall as a coach for Auburn.[55] From 1992 to 2023, Georgia played in the East Division of the SEC and played each opponent in the division each year along with several teams from the West Division. The SEC will expand the conference to 16 teams and will eliminate its two divisions in 2024, causing a new scheduling format for the Bulldogs to play against the other members of the conference.[56] Only the 2024 conference schedule was announced on June 14, 2023, while the conference still considers a new format for the future.[57] Announced schedules as of August 4, 2024.[58]",

The Bulldogs played their home games at Sanford Stadium in Athens, Georgia, and competed in the Eastern Division of the Southeastern Conference (SEC). They were led by seventh-year head coach Kirby Smart. They entered the season as the defending consensus national champions. This season is one of two back-to-back Georgia seasons that won a national championship. In the 2021 season, Georgia won 33–18 against Alabama, and in the 2022 season, Georgia won 65–7 against TCU. The Bulldogs finished the regular season 12–0, 8–0 in SEC play to finish first in the conference's Eastern Division. In the SEC Championship Game, the Bulldogs defeated the LSU Tigers 50–30 to win their first SEC title since 2017.[1] They advanced to the College Football Playoff for the second straight year and were selected to play against Ohio State in the Peach Bowl. Georgia mounted the largest 4th-quarter comeback in CFP history to defeat Ohio State by a score of 42–41, after Ohio State missed a potential game-winning 50-yard field goal in the final seconds of the game. As the season’s last major team with an undefeated record, the Bulldogs faced off against Texas Christian University (TCU) at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California for the 2023 CFP National Championship on January 9, 2023. They dominated TCU 65–7 to become the first team since the 2012 Alabama Crimson Tide to repeat as national champions, along with becoming just the 3rd team to complete a 15–0 season in the modern era, after LSU in 2019 and Clemson in 2018. They would be subsequently joined by Michigan the following year.[2] Their 58-point margin of victory over TCU was the largest of any bowl game result,[3] until next season when Georgia defeated Florida State with a 60-point margin, 63–3, in the 2023 Orange Bowl.[4] Fifteen Bulldogs were selected in the 2022 NFL Draft, setting a new record for draft picks from a single school in the seven-round draft era (1994–present).[5] Eight players elected to enter the NCAA Transfer Portal during or after the 2021 season. † Elected to use the extra year of eligibility granted by the NCAA in response to COVID-19.

                "content": "The Oregon Ducks football program is a college football team for the University of Oregon, located in the U.S. state of Oregon. The team competes at the NCAA Division I level in the FBS and is a member of the Big Ten Conference (B1G). Though now known as the Ducks, the team was commonly called the Webfoots until the mid-1960s. The program first fielded a football team in 1894. Oregon plays its home games at the 54,000 seat Autzen Stadium in Eugene. The program has been one of the most successful programs in college football since the 2000s. Oregon football has been known in recent years for its flashy and unique uniform style, facilitated by a close partnership with Oregon-based Nike.[6] The football program began in 1894 and played its first game on March 24, 1894, defeating Albany College 44–2 under head coach Cal Young.[7][8][9] Cal Young left after that first game and J.A. Church took over the coaching position in the fall for the rest of the season. Oregon finished the season with two additional losses and a tie, but went undefeated the following season, winning all four of its games under head coach Percy Benson.[9][10][11] In 1899, the football team left the state for the first time, playing the California Golden Bears in Berkeley, California.[7] Oregon's largest margin of victory came in 1910 when they defeated the University of Puget Sound 115–0.[12] Oregon changed coaches frequently during the early 20th century, going through sixteen different head coaches in nineteen seasons,[8][13] until Hugo Bezdek, who had coached the Webfeet to a 5–0–1 record in 1906, returned to Oregon from the University of Arkansas in 1913. Bezdek, Oregon's first truly professional coach, led the team from 1913 through 1917. A versatile motivator of athletes, during his tenure Bezdek was also the West Coast scout for the Pittsburgh Pirates.[citation needed] In the 1916 season, Oregon went undefeated with seven wins and one tie under Bezdek, shutting out all but two opponents. They opened the season against Willamette University, defeating them 97–0. The game against Washington ended in a scoreless tie. Oregon used ineligible players in two games and the Pacific Coast Conference title went to Washington,[14][15] [additional citation(s) needed] but Oregon was given the invitation to the 1917 Rose Bowl, then known as the Tournament East-West Football Game at Tournament Park due to the cost of a train ticket to Los Angeles being significantly less from Eugene than from Seattle.[16] The Oregon football team defeated the heavily favored University of Pennsylvania Quakers 14–0, securing their first Rose Bowl victory.[12] In 1918 Bezdek quit Oregon to become general manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates.[citation needed] He was succeeded by Shy Huntington, one of the heroes of the 1917 Rose Bowl. Led by Charles A. Huntington and playing at newly constructed Hayward Field, which would be their home stadium in Eugene until 1967, the Webfeet again tied Washington for the Pacific Coast Conference title in 1919, winning the tiebreaker based on their 24–13 victory over the Huskies in Seattle. Oregon lost the 1920 Rose Bowl to Harvard University, 7–6.[8][17] This would be the team's last bowl appearance until the 1948 Cotton Bowl.[8][17][18][19] In the late 1920s and early 1930s, Oregon made the first attempts to establish a nationally prominent football program by luring established Eastern coaches west, first John \"Cap\" McEwan in 1926 from Army, then Clarence \"Doc\" Spears from Minnesota in 1930. Both coaches achieved moderate success, but neither outlasted his contracted term: McEwan resigned amid a contract dispute,[20] and Spears, hired under a five-year contract, left Oregon after two seasons to return to the Western Conference at Wisconsin.[21] Prince G. \"Prink\" Callison, Oregon native, alumnus, former player and coach of the freshman team, took over from Spears in 1932. Behind standout back Mike Mikulak and a smothering defense (50 points allowed, five shutouts), Callison led the 1933 Webfeet to a 9–1 mark and Pacific Coast Conference co-championship, with the only loss to USC. This record would stand as the best in school history until 2001.[22] After the homegrown Callison retired in 1937, Oregon again hired a working head coach, pulling Gerald \"Tex\" Oliver from Arizona. Oliver coached until World War II, when he took a leave of absence to serve as a naval officer; Oregon basketball coach John Warren served as interim head football coach in 1942, posting a 2–6 record, after which the school shut down the football program for the duration of the war.[8] Oliver returned as head coach after the war, eventually posting a mediocre 23–28–3 cumulative record. His 71–7 loss at Texas in 1941 on the day before the attack on Pearl Harbor stands as the most points allowed by any Oregon team, and the second largest margin of defeat. Oliver, in 1945, is the only coach to see his team lose twice to Oregon State in the same season.[23] In October 1946, Oliver abruptly resigned as Oregon's head coach, expressing dissatisfaction with the level of support shown by the administration for the football program.[24] Oliver was replaced by another working head coach, Jim Aiken of Nevada. Aiken had immediate success with the team he inherited, which like many post-war squads, was peppered with war veterans including Brad Ecklund, Jake Leicht and Norm Van Brocklin, and transfers George Bell, Woodley Lewis and John McKay.[25] Oregon's 1948 team went 9–1 in the regular season and tied with California for the PCC championship; the teams did not meet on the field that season and in a secret ballot by the conference presidents, Cal was awarded the 1949 Rose Bowl bid.[26] In a bid to soothe hurt feelings, the conference broke tradition and allowed the Webfeet to play in a post-season contest other than the Rose Bowl. Oregon's Cotton Bowl game that season (a 21–13 loss to SMU with Doak Walker) was the team's only bowl appearance between the 1920 and 1958 Rose Bowls. Aiken couldn't maintain his success with younger players. By his fourth season, the Ducks were one of the nation's worst major college teams, posting a 1–9 record in 1950, still the lowest winning percentage in school history as of 2011.[22] Aiken resigned amid allegations of recruiting and practice violations in early 1951.[27] Everything that Oregon athletics is today, it owes to Len Casanova. He has been the pillar, the strength and the inspiration for our program for over 50 years. Once again, Oregon found a working major college coach to take over its program, hiring Len Casanova from the University of Pittsburgh after Aiken's resignation.[8][29] Casanova gradually rebuilt the program, and eventually led the Ducks to a winning record in 1954. The Ducks played in the earliest nationally televised college football game in 1953, against Nebraska in Lincoln, winning 20–12.[30] In the 1957 season Oregon tied Oregon State for the conference title, but earned the Rose Bowl bid because of the conference no-repeat rule. The Webfeet lost 10–7 to the heavily favored and number one ranked Ohio State University in the 1958 Rose Bowl.[29][31] Braven Dyer of the Los Angeles Times, who had picked Ohio State to win by a 48–14 score, said: \"The score of 10–7 was a complete moral victory for the underdog Ducks from Eugene who had been doped to lose by three touchdowns. They lost, but at day's end there weren't many fans who were willing to concede that the better team had won.\" Vincent X. Flaherty, writing in the San Francisco Examiner, said: \"Len Casanova undoubtedly performed the greatest coaching feat of the season for the Rose Bowl classic...there couldn't have been a bowl team anywhere in America yesterday that dazzled with more spectacular finesse.\"[30] Casanova led the Ducks to two more bowl appearances, in the Liberty Bowl (1960 vs Penn State) and the Sun Bowl (1963 vs Southern Methodist), before becoming the UO's second full-time athletic director in January 1967, replacing Leo Harris.[7][29][31] Future Pro Football Hall of Fame members Mel Renfro and Dave Wilcox were players under his tutelage. Many of his assistant coaches such as George Seifert, John McKay, and John Robinson went on to have their own successful head coaching careers.[31] His career record of 82–73–8 marked the highest number of wins recorded by a head coach at the university at that time.[29] The Len Casanova Center, Oregon's athletic department headquarters near Autzen Stadium, is named in his honor.[31] Casanova's move to the administration began a two-decade downturn in Oregon's fortunes. Longtime offensive line coach Jerry Frei succeeded him as head coach in 1967, when Oregon moved into the new Autzen Stadium.[8][31][32] His teams were never selected for a bowl game and never won more than six games in a season. (Until the 1975 season, the Pac-8 (and Big Ten) had only one bowl team, for the Rose Bowl.) Although his Oregon career ended with a losing record, he coached several players who went on to NFL stardom, including Hall of Fame quarterback Dan Fouts and All-Pro wide receiver Ahmad Rashad, known as halfback Bobby Moore as a Duck.[33] In 1970, he coached the Ducks to an improbable comeback at UCLA, scoring twenty points in the final four minutes to win by a point, 41–40.[34] However, Frei was unable to defeat arch-rival Oregon State (under Dee Andros) in the Civil War game, and after the 1971 loss, some influential boosters reportedly demanded that Frei make significant changes to his coaching staff.[35] On January 18, 1972, Frei resigned as head coach, citing disagreements with university boosters and athletic director Norv Ritchey.[32][33] Following his resignation, the student body president at the time, as well as others, numerous published letters to the editor of The Register-Guard voiced their support of Frei.[32] After an exhaustive search that included interviews with several established head coaches, Frei's offensive line coach, Dick Enright, was elevated to head coach for the 1972 season. Enright was the least experienced candidate for the position, having been a high school coach until 1970,[36] and he struggled to maintain team discipline and consistent play. Enright famously tried to make an option quarterback out of Dan Fouts, who was not a runner.[37] Although his 1972 team did beat Oregon State for the first time in nine seasons, Enright's teams only won six games in two seasons. After complaining to the media about what he considered sub-standard conditions of football facilities,[38] he was fired after the 1973 season. Enright was replaced by Don Read, his quarterback coach.[35] Read was unable to field a competitive team in his first job as a major college head coach. Oregon's longest losing streak – 14 games – was set during Read's three-year term, which also saw the team's worst loss in history (66–0 at Washington in 1974).[39] After the Ducks' home opener in 1975, a 5–0 loss to San Jose State, UO president William Boyd told a reporter he'd \"rather be whipped in a public square than sit through a game like that.\"[40] Read was fired, with one year left on his contract, after the 1976 season ended. His teams had gone 3–18 in conference play, were shut out seven times in three seasons, and owned just one win over a team with a winning record (17–3 over Colorado State in 1976).[8][41][42] In announcing Read's termination, Oregon Athletic Director John Caine said it had been a financial decision; Read hadn't shown enough progress to generate interest in season ticket sales, boosters were not making donations, and Read couldn't be sent out recruiting without a contract extension, for which there was no support. Breaking recent—and unsuccessful—tradition, Caine also said \"the successor will not come from the current staff ... There is a need for a different approach than we've had here for a number of years ... I'm looking for a multi-talented individual, one with perhaps a different personality and a different background.\"[43] It had become clear that drastic action was needed to correct a suffering program. Caine had informed an alumni group that the Oregon football team had lost money the last three seasons. Normally, it is a university's football program that provides funding for other non-revenue sports, but at Oregon, football was siphoning money from the successful basketball program and cutting into the budgets for wrestling, baseball and track.[44] Caine could not afford to pay top dollar for a college coach; he told reporters he wouldn't top $35,000 annually for his new head coach, but that he would sweeten the pot with a $100,000 recruiting budget, the second highest in the conference.[45] The coaching search took two weeks. After being rebuffed by Bill Walsh, who took the Stanford job, and Jim Mora, who withdrew his name from consideration because he considered the job a dead end, Caine appointed UCLA assistant coach and Oregon State graduate Rich Brooks as Oregon's 29th head football coach, over finalists Monte Kiffin and Ray Greene.[46] Brooks got off to a shaky start, with four two-win seasons in his first six years at Oregon.[47][48][49] In 1980, a pay-for-credit scandal, disclosure of an illegal travel fund, misuse of phone cards and criminal sexual abuse charges against Oregon football players led Brooks to tender his resignation to President Boyd; Boyd refused to accept the resignation.[50][better source needed] Oregon was placed on probation by the Pac-10 (1980)[51] and NCAA (1982).[52] After several mediocre seasons, including 1983 and an infamous scoreless tie with Oregon State known as the \"Toilet Bowl\"[53] the Ducks posted an 8–4 season in 1989, going to the Independence Bowl – Oregon's first postseason appearance in 26 seasons.[54] Brooks would achieve two more bowl games before his final season in 1994.[55] The pinnacle of Brooks' Oregon career came in his final season, when his team became the Pacific-10 Conference Champions with a 9–3 regular season record and a Rose Bowl appearance (their conference championship was also their first ever outright conference championship as all the previous ones were shared).[55] The defining moment of the season came in a game against the 9th-ranked (AP) Washington Huskies, and is widely remembered by Duck fans as \"The Pick\".[56] Prior to that game, the Ducks had won only three games against the Huskies in 20 seasons, including many heartbreakers in the heated rivalry.[57] Late in the game, with the Ducks nursing a 24–20 lead, Washington was in position to score and take the lead when the Huskies' quarterback Damon Huard threw an interception to Kenny Wheaton, who returned the interception for a 97-yard touchdown, sealing the win for the Ducks. The Pick is replayed on the big screen at Autzen Stadium before each football game.[56] Following the Washington game, the Ducks finished the rest of the regular season without a loss, but lost to Penn State in the 1995 Rose Bowl, 38–20.[55] After the 1994 season, Rich Brooks announced that he would leave Oregon to become the new head coach of the St. Louis Rams.[58] Although Brooks had a poorer winning percentage, with 91 victories he surpassed Len Casanova to become the winningest coach in school history.[59] The field at Autzen Stadium was dedicated as Rich Brooks Field, in honor of his tenure and accomplishments.[60] Although he left the Ducks with a losing record due to his first seven teams winning a combined 22 games, he is credited with reviving Oregon's football program. His 91 wins were the most in school history at the time, while his 109 losses are still the most in school history. Offensive coordinator Mike Bellotti was elevated into the head coaching position after Rich Brooks vacated the position in 1995.[61] During his head coaching career, Bellotti elevated the expectations of the Ducks football program. Season records that in the past would have been deemed acceptable or even laudable became considered mediocre and disappointing.[60] Bellotti was immediately successful, leading the team to a 9–3 record his first year and an appearance in the Cotton Bowl Classic.[62] In his 14 seasons, Bellotti's teams were selected for 12 bowl games, and only once (2004, 5–6) did the Ducks post a losing record during his tenure.[17] Bellotti coached the team to the Pac-10 Championship in the 2000 season, shared with Washington and OSU.[63] With a Rose Bowl bid on the line, the Ducks lost the 2000 Civil War at Corvallis, dropping the Ducks to the Holiday Bowl[64] The Ducks defeated Texas 35–30 in the Holiday, for the first 10-win season in program history.[65] In the 2001 season, senior quarterback Joey Harrington, a Heisman Trophy finalist,[66][67] led the Ducks to its first 11-win season in program history and an outright Pac-10 championship.[68][69] The season was riddled with close games, 6 of which ended with a spread of one score or less, coining the nickname \"Captain Comeback\" for Harrington.[70][71] The only loss of the season came at home to the Stanford Cardinal. Oregon held a 3 touchdown lead, but mishaps on special teams cost them the game.[71] The Ducks ended the 2001 regular season ranked No. 2 in both the AP and Coaches polls, but the BCS computer formula ranked Oregon No. 4, behind No. 2 Nebraska – which had lost to Colorado in its final regular season game – and No. 3 Colorado; this kept Oregon out of the national championship game.[72] The discrepancy caused the BCS committee to alter the ranking system for subsequent years to a formula which, if applied in 2001, would have placed Oregon in the national championship game.[73] The 2001 Ducks instead played at the Fiesta Bowl against Colorado. Oregon's run defense stifled Colorado's running game, holding them to just 49 yards on 31 carries. Harrington passed for 350 yards and led the Ducks to a 38–16 win.[74] Oregon settled for a final 2nd-place ranking in both the AP and Coaches polls.[75] After the 2001 season, offensive coordinator Jeff Tedford left for the head coaching job at California,[76] replaced by Andy Ludwig. The 2003 season was highlighted by a big win against the 5th ranked Michigan Wolverines, ruining Michigan's aspirations of a big season during a trip to a west coast game for the third time in four years.[77] Ludwig resigned as offensive coordinator after a dismal 2004 campaign, the only losing season (5–6) for a Mike Bellotti-coached Oregon team.[78] Recently fired BYU head coach Gary Crowton took the offensive reins;[79] the 2005 season saw a dramatic improvement from 2004, going 10–1 in the regular season, with the only loss to top-ranked USC.[80][81] In the eighth game of the season against the Arizona Wildcats, the senior starting quarterback for the Ducks, Kellen Clemens, suffered a spiral fracture in his ankle, ending his season and his collegiate career.[82] Despite losing Clemens, the Ducks won the game as well as the rest of their regular season games but lost the Holiday Bowl to the Oklahoma Sooners.[80] In 2006 the team started off well, winning four games to open the season,[80] including a controversial victory against then-ranked No. 11 Oklahoma.[83] But the Oklahoma victory proved to be the high point of the 2006 season; the team eventually fell apart, going 3–5 for the remainder of the regular season, and were pounded by BYU in the Las Vegas Bowl, losing 8–38 in a dismal performance.[84] Gary Crowton left Oregon for the offensive coordinator position at Louisiana State University after the 2006 season;[85] Chip Kelly was hired to replace him in February 2007.[86] Kelly's impact was felt immediately, with the 2007 Ducks going 8–1 behind QB Dennis Dixon and ranked as high as No. 2, before being decimated by injuries at quarterback. Finishing the regular season with three straight losses, the Ducks were relegated to the Sun Bowl, where they defeated South Florida 56–21. A lot of people think Oregon would've made the championship if Dixon was healthy[87] Geoff Schwartz started from 2005 to 2007 at right tackle, as part of an offense that led the conference in rushing for the first time since 1955 in 2006 and then again in 2007, and was a second-team 2007 All-Pac-10 selection.[88] The 2008 season saw the emergence of quarterback Jeremiah Masoli as the leader of Chip Kelly's spread offense. Masoli, a transfer from City College of San Francisco, stepped in against Washington in the season opener, when starter Justin Roper was injured, and led the Ducks to a 44–10 victory.[89] Despite injuries, Masoli cemented himself as the starter by mid-season. In the 2008 Civil War, the Ducks defeated the Oregon State Beavers in Corvallis, 65–38, knocking the Beavers out of the Rose Bowl.[90] The Ducks went to the Holiday Bowl.[91] In a clash of two teams with high powered offenses, Oregon beat the Oklahoma State Cowboys in the 2008 Holiday Bowl and finished the season ranked in the top 10.[92][93] In March 2009, Bellotti announced his resignation; Kelly would take over as the head coach, and Bellotti was named athletic director, replacing Pat Kilkenny.[94] Bellotti left the program as the winningest coach in Oregon history, with 116 wins and a 67.8 winning percentage.[17] In his first season as the head coach of the Ducks, Chip Kelly stumbled out of the gate, losing to Boise State by 11 points in a game ending in controversy with Oregon running back LeGarrette Blount punching Boise State linebacker Byron Hout on national television, after Hout was seen heckling Blount.[95] The Ducks showed only minor improvements with close wins against the Purdue Boilermakers and the Utah Utes.[96] It wasn't until the start of the Pac-10 season that the Ducks began to display their potential, by dismantling the highly ranked California Golden Bears 42–3.[97] The 2009 Ducks only lost one more game, to the Stanford Cardinal in the regular season, to win the Pac-10 title by two games. Oregon went to the 2010 Rose Bowl, where they lost 26–17 to the Ohio State Buckeyes.[80] During the offseason, the team was mired in controversy. Starting running back LaMichael James was involved in a domestic dispute in which he pleaded guilty to physical harassment of a former girlfriend, and was suspended for the first game of 2010 season.[98] Starting quarterback Jeremiah Masoli was suspended for the entire 2010 football season over thefts from a local fraternity house.[99] On June 7, Masoli was cited for marijuana possession, driving with a suspended license and failing to stop when entering a roadway. In response, coach Chip Kelly removed him from the team.[100] Despite the loss of Masoli, the Ducks dominated their opponents in the 2010 season. On October 17, the team moved up to the No. 1 ranking in both the AP and USA Today Coaches Poll for the first time in school history.[101] This occurred after the No. 1-ranked teams, Ohio State Buckeyes and Alabama Crimson Tide lost in consecutive weeks. The Ducks finished the regular season with a 12–0 record; winning the conference at 9–0, they were the only team in Pac-10 history to defeat every other conference team in a nine conference game season.[102] Ranked No. 2 in the BCS rankings, the Ducks played Auburn in the 2011 BCS National Championship Game at University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, losing on an Auburn field goal as time expired, 22–19.[103] Despite his opening game suspension, Oregon RB LaMichael James won the 2010 Doak Walker Award as the nation's outstanding college running back.[104] James was also Oregon's first unanimous All-American football player, appearing on all five all-America teams recognized by the NCAA.[105] Oregon won its third straight conference championship in 2011, winning the new Pac-12 North Division and defeating UCLA in the inaugural Pac-12 Conference Championship Game.[106] The Ducks became the first Pac-12 team other than USC to win three consecutive titles outright since the conference was formed in 1959.[107] LaMichael James became the first player in conference history with three 1,500+ yard rushing seasons, and ranks second on the Pac-12's career rushing list. James was a finalist for the 2011 Doak Walker Award, and was named a finalist for the 2011 Paul Hornung Award. Punter Jackson Rice was a finalist for the Ray Guy Award.[108] On January 2, 2012, the Oregon Ducks won the Rose Bowl, defeating the Wisconsin Badgers 45–38 for the title.[109] The Ducks continued their streak of national relevance into the 2012 season, reaching the No. 1 ranking in the AP poll for only the second time in team history on November 12.[110] But a loss at home to Stanford ended Oregon's string of conference championships.[111] The team was selected to play in the 2013 Fiesta Bowl against Kansas State (which Oregon won 35–17),[112] making Oregon only the fourth team in history to play in four consecutive BCS bowl games.[113] Running back Kenjon Barner was a finalist for the Doak Walker Award and was named Oregon's fifth consensus All-American.[114] Immediately following the end of the 2012 season, Kelly interviewed for head coaching vacancies with the Cleveland Browns, Buffalo Bills and Philadelphia Eagles. Kelly initially declined the offers, but a few weeks later, agreed to terms with the Eagles.[115] A few days after Kelly's resignation, offensive coordinator Mark Helfrich was hired to become the Ducks' 32nd head coach.[116] On June 26, 2013, the football program was penalized with 3 years of probation and a reduction of scholarships by the NCAA but no bowl bans. This decision was made after an investigation into the school's use of football recruiting services under former head coach Chip Kelly.[117] In 2013, Helfrich's first season as head coach, the Ducks were bound for the national championship after early season domination and QB Marcus Mariota was a front-runner for the Heisman[citation needed] The Ducks then lost two games in the span of 3 weeks to Arizona and Stanford. The regular season was capped off with a 36–35 win in the game against the Oregon State Beavers. Oregon went on to beat Texas in the Valero Alamo Bowl 30–7.[118] Helfrich led the 2014 Ducks to a 12–1 (8–1) regular season record, winning his first Pac-12 Conference Championship as a head coach. The record season included wins over reigning Big Ten Conference and Rose Bowl champion Michigan State, and rivals Washington and Oregon State. The Ducks' sole loss came in a Thursday night home game against Arizona. Oregon rebounded with eight consecutive wins, including a dominant win in a rematch against the Wildcats in the Pac-12 Football Championship Game.[119] Oregon quarterback Marcus Mariota was voted the school's second unanimous All-American[120] and first Heisman Trophy winner, receiving the second highest point percentage in the award's history.[121] Mariota was also named the school's first winner of the Maxwell, Davey O'Brien, and Walter Camp awards. After finishing No. 2 in the final College Football Playoff rankings in 2014,[122] Oregon qualified to face undefeated defending national champions Florida State in the Rose Bowl, designated a semi-final game for the College Football Playoff. The Ducks defeated the Seminoles 59–20.[123] With the win the Ducks advanced to the inaugural College Football Playoff National Championship Game to face the No. 4 ranked Ohio State Buckeyes, who defeated No. 1 ranked Alabama in the Sugar Bowl, the other College Football Playoff semi-final game. The Ducks lost in the CFP National Championship game 42–20 against the Buckeyes. Oregon finished the 2014 season with an overall record of 13–2 and a No. 2 ranking in the final Associated Press football poll.[124] Oregon was ranked in the top 10 in both major pre-season football polls for 2015.[125] Following the departure of Marcus Mariota to the NFL, Oregon found itself without a proven option at quarterback. Vernon Adams, a highly regarded player for three years at FCS Eastern Washington, moved to Oregon for his final season of eligibility as a graduate transfer.[126] Adams was injured in his first game as a Duck—ironically, against his old team, Eastern Washington[127]—and either sat out of or played ineffectively in the next five games of 2015, as Oregon opened 3–3. Once Adams returned to full health, the team went on a run through conference play, winning the last six games of the regular season to finish 9–3, earning a bid in the 2016 Alamo Bowl against Texas Christian. In the Alamo Bowl, Oregon raced to a 31–0 lead in the first half, but Adams exited the game after an injury; TCU made one of the greatest comebacks in bowl game history in the second half, eventually tying the game and winning the game in the third overtime period, 47–41.[128] Oregon was ranked No. 19 AP /No. 20 Coaches in the polls following the 2015 season. The 2015 Oregon football season was marred by defensive ineptitude. Opponents tallied 37.5 points per game, the worst total in program history,[129] despite the presence of All-American defensive end DeForrest Buckner, who was drafted with the No. 7 overall pick in the 2016 NFL draft by the San Francisco 49ers.[130] Following the season, Don Pellum took the fall for the poor performance on defense and returned to position coaching, and Helfrich hired Brady Hoke, an experienced college head coach, as defensive coordinator on January 16, 2016.[131] Helfrich promoted receiver coach Matt Lubick to offensive coordinator prior to the Alamo Bowl, replacing the departed Scott Frost.[132] 2016 was Mark Helfrich's last as head coach. Oregon posted a 4–8 record, capped with losing to rival Oregon State in the season finale. OSU beat the Ducks 34–24, ending Oregon's eight game win streak versus their in-state rival.[133] Other defeats came versus the University of Washington, a 70–21 loss,[134] a 51–33 loss to Washington State University[135] and a 45–20 loss to the USC Trojans.[136] The 4 wins was the lowest total in the program since 1991.[137] Helfrich was terminated as head coach November 29, 2016.[138] Following Helfrich's dismissal, South Florida head coach Willie Taggart was named 33rd head coach of the Oregon Ducks on December 7, 2016.[139] On January 17, 2017, Oregon suspended strength and conditioning coach Irele Oderinde for one month after 3 players were hospitalized during off-season workouts.[140] On January 23, 2017, ESPN reported that co-offensive coordinator and tight ends coach David Reaves would be fired less than one week after officially being hired, following a DUI arrest.[141] On December 5, 2017, Taggart departed after a single season as head coach when he accepted the head coaching position at Florida State.[142] The team finished the season 7–5, losing to Boise State in the Las Vegas Bowl. On December 8, 2017, Mario Cristobal was named the permanent head coach of the Oregon Ducks.[143] On February 20, 2018, it was reported Cristobal made his first staffing decision with the hiring of offensive line coach Alex Mirabal, who will be Oregon's 10th and final full-time assistant coach.[144] Prior to the 2018 season, Oregon had scheduled Texas A&M for a home-and-home series for both 2018 and 2019 seasons but the Aggies backed out of the commitment. Oregon opened the season led by Junior quarterback Justin Herbert, a darkhorse Heisman Trophy candidate, and the Ducks won their first three games. The Ducks defeated Bowling Green 58–24, Portland State 62–14, and San Jose State 35–22. On September 18, 2018, Oregon was ranked 20th in the AP Top 25 and 19th in the Coaches Poll. Oregon's was defeated by then 7th-ranked Stanford at Autzen on September 22, 2018. Three weeks later, they defeated then number 7 Washington 30–27 in overtime. They finished the regular season at 8–4 and defeated the Michigan State Spartans 7–6 in the Redbox Bowl, finishing the 2018 season at 9–4. The 2019 season began with Oregon and Auburn University facing off in the Advocare Classic, a rematch of the 2011 BCS National Championship Game. Oregon led for much of the game, but was unable to hold off a late Auburn rally, losing 27–21. The Ducks bounced back from the disappointing start, winning nine consecutive games and rising to number 6 in national polls, before losing on the road to Arizona State, 31–28. Oregon closed its regular season with a victory over rival Oregon State and won the Pac-12 North division for the first time in five seasons. In the Pac-12 Championship Game, they defeated the favored Utah Utes 37–15. The win earned them a trip to the 2020 Rose Bowl Game, where they defeated the Wisconsin Badgers 28–27. Oregon finished the season ranked fifth in the AP and Coaches Polls, for their best finish since the 2014 season. In the 2020 season, the Ducks and college football at large were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Oregon ultimately played a shortened, conference-only season, going 3–2 but earning a spot in the Pac-12 Championship Game due to tie-breakers and forfeits. The Ducks again upset the favored South division champions, this time the USC Trojans, and won the conference championship 31–24. The Ducks were selected to play in the Fiesta Bowl, but fell to Iowa State, 34–17. In 2021, the first full season since the pandemic started, the Ducks started the season 4–0 and rising to number 3 in national polls with a win over then number 3 Ohio State before losing to Stanford, 31–24. Oregon won the Pac-12 North Division but lost in the Pac-12 Championship Game against Utah. Their 10–3 record earned them a game against Oklahoma in the 2021 Valero Alamo Bowl, where they lost 32–47. Oregon finished the 2021 season 10–4. On December 6, 2021, Cristobal announced to the team that he would leave the program in order to become the head coach at the University of Miami, eventually finishing his tenure.[145] Offensive coordinator Joe Moorhead also left to be the head coach at Akron.[146] On December 11, 2021, Georgia defensive coordinator Dan Lanning was named the 35th head coach at the University of Oregon, replacing Mario Cristobal after his departure to become the head coach at the University of Miami.[147][148] Despite no prior head coaching experience, Lanning arrived in Eugene with a reputation as a great defensive coach who had mentored many great players during his time at Georgia.[149] The Ducks would finish their first season under Lanning as head coach with a 10–3 record, winning the 2022 Holiday Bowl against North Carolina 28–27. Lanning finished his 3rd year and first year in the big ten, with a 13-0 record,Oregon finished as big 10 champions. Oregon has been a member of the following conferences. Dating back to their second season of existence, Oregon has claimed at least a share of 16 conference titles.[151][152] † Co-championship In 2011, the Pacific-10 Conference expansion brought the membership total to 12 teams, leading to the creation of the Pac-12 Conference and a Conference Championship Game. The champions of each division faced off in the Conference Championship Game until 2021, due to the conference announcing they would eliminate divisions starting with the 2022 season, albeit the Conference Championship Game will be kept. In 2020, the Ducks qualified for the 2020 Pac-12 Championship Game despite finishing in second place in the North Division, this was due to the original participants, the Washington Huskies, not being able to participate due to not having enough scholarship players to participate. † Co-championship ‡ - Washington was replaced in the 2020 conference championship game by runner-up Oregon due to insufficient student-athletes during the COVID-19 pandemic Players † Shared Award Marcus Mariota became the first player in the history of the University of Oregon to be awarded the Heisman Trophy, receiving 90.92% of possible points, the second highest total in the history of the trophy.[153] Mariota earned the award without a media campaign, having declined an offer from the University of Oregon during the summer prior to the 2014 season.[154] This is in contrast to the media campaigns orchestrated by the University of Oregon in the past for potential Heisman contenders, for example, during the 2001 season, a $250,000 billboard in Time's Square promoting Joey Harrington as \"Joey Heisman\".[155] Mariota's Heisman winning season was marked by breaking every career and single season record at Oregon for total offense, total scoring and passing and winning the program's 12th Pac-12 Championship. Seven other players from the University of Oregon have received Heisman votes, with LaMichael James being the only Duck to receive votes in multiple years (2010, 2011). The highest non-first-place finish in the Heisman balloting also came from LaMichael James, who in 2010 came in third behind Cam Newton (1st) and fellow Pac-12 player Andrew Luck (2nd). On December 4, 2023, Bo Nix was announced as a Heisman Trophy Finalist becoming the 4th player from Oregon to be invited to New York for the award ceremony. The following year on December 9th 2024, Quarterback Dillon Gabriel was announced as a Heisman Trophy Finalist joining the list as the 5th Ducks Player and 3rd Oregon Quarterback to be invited to the award ceremony in New York. The Ducks have had seven players and three coaches inducted in the College Football Hall of Fame.[156] † McKay played halfback at Oregon from 1947 to 1949 and coached as an assistant from 1950 to 1958. He was inducted into the CFHoF in recognition of his success as the head coach of the USC Trojans, whom he coached from 1960 to 1975, winning four national championships and nine conference championships in 16 seasons. Six former Oregon football players have been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.[157] Every year, several publications release lists of their ideal \"team\". The athletes on these lists are referred to as All-Americans. The NCAA recognizes five All-American lists. They are the Associated Press (AP), American Football Coaches Association (AFCA), Football Writers Association of America (FWAA), Sporting News (SN), and the Walter Camp Football Foundation (WCFF). As of 2023, Oregon has had 40 players honored 58 times as first team All-Americans (11 Consensus)[158] in its history, including five players honored in different seasons. During the 2019 season, left offensive tackle Penei Sewell became Oregon's 8th Consensus All-American. This is a partial list of the five most recent bowl games that Oregon has competed in. For the full Oregon bowl game history, see List of Oregon Ducks bowl games From the 2004 Holiday Bowl through the January 2016 Alamo Bowl, Oregon had played in 11 consecutive bowl games, its longest streak. The Ducks failed to make a bowl game at the end of the 2016 season, snapping the streak. From the 1989 Independence Bowl through the January 2016 Alamo Bowl, Oregon had played in bowl games for 23 of 27 seasons, missing only the 1991, 1993, 1996, and 2004 seasons. Oregon played in five BCS bowl games, including four consecutive BCS bowl games from 2009 to 2012, tied for first in consecutive BCS appearances in the BCS era. †Indicates BCS, or CFP / New Years' Six bowl. Oregon was selected as the second seed in the inaugural College Football Playoff following the 2014 season, and defeated the defending national champions, third seed Florida State, in the 2015 Rose Bowl. In the CFP national championship game, they fell to fourth seeded Ohio State, finishing number two in the country. The Oregon–Oregon State football rivalry (formerly known as the \"Civil War\") is an American college football rivalry game played annually in the state of Oregon between the Ducks of the University of Oregon in Eugene and the Beavers of Oregon State University in Corvallis.[159] First played 130 years ago in 1894, it is the fifth-most played college football rivalry game in the Football Bowl Subdivision. Oregon State is still a member of the Pac-12 Conference while Oregon moved to the Big Ten Conference on August 1, 2024. The campuses are less than fifty miles (80 km) apart in the Willamette Valley. The series has now been played continuously since 1945. Though not officially recognized by the universities, the Platypus Trophy is awarded annually to the winning team’s alumni association. Oregon leads the series 68–49–10 (.575). The game was not held in 1900, 1901, 1911, 1943, and 1944; two games were played in 1896 and 1945. The first reference to the \"Civil War\" name was in 1929 and came into common use in 1937. Prior to that, it was called the \"Oregon Classic\" or the \"State Championship Game.\"[160] The Ducks had an 8-game win streak in the series to tie for the longest streak in the history of the rivalry until losing in 2016.[citation needed] Oregon and Saint Mary's College competed in an annual Thanksgiving Day classic between 1929–1935, played at Kezar Stadium in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park.[161] The victors were awarded The Governors' Perpetual Trophy jointly by the governors of the states of California and Oregon.[162] The Gaels hold a 7–3 lead in the series and final possession of the trophy. The rivalry is unlikely to be contested again, as Saint Mary's discontinued football in 1951 due to the national emergency resulting from the Korean War.[163] The Oregon–Washington football rivalry, also known informally as the \"Cascade Clash\"[164], is an American college football rivalry between the Oregon Ducks and Washington Huskies of the Big Ten Conference. The respective campuses in Eugene and Seattle are 285 miles (460 km) apart, via Interstate 5. It is one of the top 25 most played rivalries in NCAA Division I FBS history, and has been played regularly since 1900.[165] The series started in 1900 and has incited particularly poor behavior from fans of both teams.[165] Although Washington has historically dominated the series, Oregon had a winning streak 2004 to 2015, Oregon won 12 match-ups in a row by an average of 24 points, the longest streak in the rivalry by either team. However, that streak was broken in 2016. Since then, Washington has won 5 of the last 9 games including the 2023 PAC 12 championship. As of the 2024 season, Washington leads the series 63-49-5. Oregon wins the so-called Northwest Championship by sweeping Washington, Washington State, and Oregon State. The four Pacific Northwest rivals began playing in a round-robin format in the 1903 season. Prior to the program's move to the Big Ten Conference, Oregon played each of the other 5 schools in the North Division of the Pac-12 annually and 4 of the 6 schools from the South Division. Each season, Oregon \"missed\" two schools from the South Division: either UCLA or USC and one of the four Arizona or Mountain schools. This cycle repeated after eight seasons.[166] On October 5, 2023, Oregon's Big Ten opponents from 2024 through 2028 were revealed, with their rivalry game against Washington being a protected annual game.[167][168] Announced schedules as of November 21, 2024.[169] Oregon has used six sites as home fields for its football team: Autzen Stadium, the home of Oregon's football team since 1967, was named in honor of Thomas J. Autzen, a Portland businessman and, ironically, a graduate of rival Oregon State University. After his death, the Autzen Foundation, managed by son and Oregon alum Thomas E. Autzen, gave the university $250,000 towards construction of the facility, completed in 1967.[170] Although listed capacity has been 54,000 since a 2002 expansion, standing room around the rim of the stadium allows the capacity to swell to more than 60,000, and crowds of 59,000 or more have been the norm in most years. It is notorious for being one of the loudest and most intimidating venues in college football. On October 27, 2007, in a game against USC, the crowd of 59,277 was able to reach a noise level of 127.2 decibels, the 4th loudest ever recorded at a college football game.[171] Moshofsky Sports Center, named in honor of former University of Oregon football letterman (1940–42) and long-time university supporter Ed Moshofsky, was dedicated in August 1998, the first indoor practice and training facility in the Pacific-10 Conference. Located south of the Casanova Athletic Center, the Moshofsky Center accommodates the majority of the university's intercollegiate athletic programs. The $14.6 million facility includes an enclosed full-length artificial surface football field and 120-meter four-lane synthetic surface running track and an automated system in place to lower a batting cage for use by the softball team, as well as protective netting that transforms the facility for use by the men's and women's golf teams.[172] A combination of indirect lighting and two parallel skylight panels contribute to an energy efficient system which allows the flexibility to alter lighting conditions.[173] A new Football Operations Center adjacent to Autzen Stadium, the Hatfield-Dowlin Complex, was completed in 2013.[174] Featured in the expansion, which wraps around the north and west sides of the Casanova Center, is a new 25,000-square-foot weight room, an enhanced grass football practice field as well as the addition of two new synthetic turf practice fields, and a full-service dining facility available to all University athletes, students and staff. The six story facility incorporates a centralized football headquarters upstairs incorporating nine dedicated football position meeting rooms, two team video theaters, offense and defense strategy rooms as well as a larger conference suite for the coaching staff. Additional amenities include a players' lounge, a recruiting center to host prospective student-athletes, dedicated areas to accommodate professional scouts, a media interview room as well as an advanced video editing and distribution center. A new outdoor courtyard and plaza to the west of the Casanova Center is designed in the center of the complex, uniting the expansion with the existing Cas Center and Moshofsky Center. The design and construction cost of the $68 million facility was donated by Nike founder and chairman Phil Knight. The University of Oregon football team has been known in recent years for its unique uniform style, consisting of multiple color combinations of helmets, uniforms (both shirts and pants), socks, and shoes, resulting in a new uniform setup every week (not counting in-season changes to uniform designs). The changes have been often well-liked and praised by football recruits.[175][176] New uniform schemes are coordinated by Oregon alumnus Tinker Hatfield, an executive at Nike. Nike has had the outfitting rights for the Ducks since 1995.[177] For several decades in the 20th century, Oregon's uniforms were traditional, generally featuring a yellow helmet (with the original interlocking \"UO\" emblem) and yellow pants, joined with a green home jersey with gold letters or white road jersey with green letters and \"UCLA-style\" shoulder loops. During the Jerry Frei era (1967–1971), the helmets were solid green with subtle logo variations. In 1972, new head coach Dick Enright returned the yellow helmet with Green Bay Packer-style green and white striping and no logos, a helmet style that continued until 1977, when new head coach Rich Brooks added the green block-style interlocking \"UO\" emblem. In 1985, the team added the Oregon Donald Duck logo to the jersey sleeves. Mike Bellotti made subtle changes in the livery, removing the striping from the helmet, jersey and pants, and adding a green variation of the pants.[178] The Oregon uniform underwent a radical change for the 1999 season, where new, Nike-designed gear featuring a redesigned \"O\" emblem with solid green helmets and jerseys with lightning yellow letters were revealed.[179] This began a period of unusually non-uniform standards for a typical college football team. Since 1999, Oregon has completely revised its uniform appearance roughly every three seasons.[180] The frequent uniform changes and their typically flashy uniform have provoked some controversy. Fans of a more traditional approach to college football tend to ridicule each new uniform as it is released,[181] while younger fans and players—in particular, potential Oregon athletes—react more favorably to the flashy nature of the livery.[182] The football team used nine different football combinations in the 2005 season, but introduced even more combinations in the 2006 season.[183] The new uniforms in 2006 provided 384 possible different combinations of jerseys, pants, helmets, socks, and shoes. A metallic-yellow colored helmet with silver flames, which debuted in the 2006 Las Vegas Bowl, increased the possible combinations to 512.[184] These uniforms were more technologically advanced than other uniforms, 28% lighter when dry, 34% lighter when wet, and greater durability with reinforcing diamond plating patterns at the joints.[177] The Ducks wore the previously announced white helmets for the first time on October 20, 2007, in Seattle, when they played the Washington Huskies.[185] In 2008, during the Arizona–Oregon game, they wore new, all black uniforms nicknamed \"lights out\", but instead of the typical metal diamond plated shoulder pads, the new uniforms had a wing pattern.[186][187] The original \"block UO\" helmet emblem made a comeback, when it was worn along with a throwback jersey, against Cal in 2009.[188] However, the neo-throwback green jersey with gold letters, with the modern logo instead of the \"UO\" on the yellow helmet, did appear in the 2009 Civil War.[189] For the Arizona game in 2008, Oregon unveiled a new uniform design based on the \"lights out\" design from the previous season featuring the \"wings\" pattern on the shoulder pads as well as a more simplified uniform design, while retaining the number font style of \"Bellotti Bold\" and the colors of green, black, white, yellow, grey, gold, and steel.[190] This was the primary uniform design from 2009 through the 2011 regular season. Another uniform revision was introduced at the 2012 Rose Bowl and carried forward into the 2012 season, with the \"wings\" moving from the shoulder pads to the helmets as chrome decals, and a broader \"feather\" detail with iridescent fabric highlights. Five different helmets are incorporated into the uniform kit.[191][192] On October 19, 2013, Oregon wore special Breast Cancer Awareness uniforms in a game against Washington State.[193] In addition to new bold pink helmets, the Ducks wore pink Nike Vapor Talon Elite cleats, pink Nike Vapor Carbon Elite socks and pink Vapor Jet gloves in combination with their black Nike Pro Combat uniform system.[194] The special edition uniforms were designed to raise awareness and funds for the Kay Yow Cancer Fund as the helmets were auctioned off.",

                "title": "Michigan - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Michigan (/ˈmɪʃɪɡən/ ⓘ MISH-ig-ən) is a state in the Great Lakes region of the Upper Midwest region of the United States. It borders Wisconsin to the southwest in the Upper Peninsula, and Indiana and Ohio to the south in the Lower Peninsula; it is also connected by Lakes Superior, Michigan, Huron, and Erie to Minnesota and Illinois, and the Canadian province of Ontario. With a population of nearly 10.12 million and an area of 96,716 sq mi (250,490 km2), Michigan is the 10th-largest state by population, the 11th-largest by area, and the largest by area east of the Mississippi River.[b] Its capital is Lansing, and its largest city is Detroit. Metro Detroit is among the nation's most populous and largest metropolitan economies. The name derives from a gallicized variant of the original Ojibwe word ᒥᓯᑲᒥ (mishigami),[c] meaning \"large water\" or \"large lake\".[2][9] Michigan consists of two peninsulas. The Lower Peninsula resembles the shape of a mitten, and comprises a majority of the state's land area. The Upper Peninsula (often called \"the U.P.\") is separated from the Lower Peninsula by the Straits of Mackinac, a five-mile (8 km) channel that joins Lake Huron to Lake Michigan. The Mackinac Bridge connects the peninsulas. Michigan has the longest freshwater coastline of any political subdivision in the United States, being bordered by four of the five Great Lakes and Lake St. Clair.[10] It also has 64,980 inland lakes and ponds.[11] Michigan has the second-most water area of any state, behind only Alaska.[12] The area was first occupied by a succession of Native American tribes over thousands of years. In the 17th century, French explorers claimed it as part of the New France colony, when it was largely inhabited by Indigenous peoples. French and Canadian traders and settlers, Métis, and others migrated to the area, settling largely along the waterways. After France's defeat in the French and Indian War in 1762, the region came under British rule. Britain ceded the territory to the newly independent United States after its defeat in the American Revolutionary War. The area was part of the larger Northwest Territory until 1800, when western Michigan became part of the Indiana Territory. Michigan Territory was formed in 1805, but some of the northern border with Canada was not agreed upon until after the War of 1812. Michigan was admitted into the Union in 1837 as the 26th state, a free one. It soon became an important center of industry and trade in the Great Lakes region, attracting immigrants in the late 19th and early 20th centuries from many European countries. Immigrants from Finland, Macedonia, and the Netherlands were especially numerous.[13] Migration from Appalachia and of Black Southerners as part of the Great Migration increased in the 1930s,[14][15] with many settling in Metro Detroit. Although Michigan has developed a diverse economy, in the early 20th century it became widely known as the center of the U.S. automotive industry, which developed as a major national economic force. It is home to the country's three major automobile companies (whose headquarters are all in Metro Detroit). Once exploited for logging and mining, today the sparsely populated Upper Peninsula is important for tourism because of its abundance of natural resources.[16][17] The Lower Peninsula is a center of manufacturing, forestry, agriculture, services, and high-tech industry. When the first European explorers arrived, the most populous tribes were the Algonquian peoples, which include the Anishinaabe groups of Ojibwe, Odaawaa/Odawa (Ottawa), and the Boodewaadamii/Bodéwadmi (Potawatomi). The three nations coexisted peacefully as part of a loose confederation called the Council of Three Fires. The Ojibwe, whose numbers are estimated to have been at least 35,000, were the largest.[18] The Ojibwe Indians (also known as Chippewa in the U.S.), an Anishinaabe tribe, were established in Michigan's Upper Peninsula and northern and central Michigan. Bands also inhabited Ontario and southern Manitoba, Canada; and northern Wisconsin, and northern and north-central Minnesota. The Ottawa Indians lived primarily south of the Straits of Mackinac in northern, western, and southern Michigan, but also in southern Ontario, northern Ohio, and eastern Wisconsin. The Potawatomi were in southern and western Michigan, in addition to northern and central Indiana, northern Illinois, southern Wisconsin, and southern Ontario. Other Algonquian tribes in Michigan, in the south and east, were the Mascouten, the Menominee, the Miami, the Sac (or Sauk), and the Meskwaki (Fox). The Wyandot were an Iroquoian-speaking people in this area; they were historically known as the Huron by the French, and were the historical adversaries of the Iroquois Confederation.[19] French voyageurs and coureurs des bois explored and settled in Michigan in the 17th century. The first Europeans to reach what became Michigan were those of Étienne Brûlé's expedition in 1622. The first permanent European settlement was founded in 1668 on the site where Père Jacques Marquette established Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, as a base for Catholic missions.[20][21] Missionaries in 1671–75 founded outlying stations at Saint Ignace and Marquette. Jesuit missionaries were well received by the area's Indian populations, with few difficulties or hostilities. In 1679, Robert Cavelier, Sieur de la Salle built Fort Miami at present-day St. Joseph. In 1691, the French established a trading post and Fort St. Joseph along the St. Joseph River at the present-day city of Niles. In 1701, French explorer and army officer Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac founded Fort Pontchartrain du Détroit or \"Fort Pontchartrain on-the-Strait\" on the strait, known as the Detroit River, between lakes Saint Clair and Erie.[citation needed] Cadillac had convinced King Louis XIV's chief minister, Louis Phélypeaux, Comte de Pontchartrain, that a permanent community there would strengthen French control over the upper Great Lakes and discourage British aspirations.[citation needed] The hundred soldiers and workers who accompanied Cadillac built a fort enclosing one arpent (about 0.85 acres (3,400 m2),[22][23] the equivalent of just under 200 feet (61 m) per side) and named it Fort Pontchartrain. Cadillac's wife, Marie Thérèse Guyon, soon moved to Detroit, becoming one of the first European women to settle in what was considered the wilderness of Michigan. The town quickly became a major fur-trading and shipping post. The Église de Saint-Anne (Catholic Church of Saint Anne) was founded the same year.[citation needed] While the original building does not survive, the congregation remains active.[citation needed] Cadillac later departed to serve as the French governor of Louisiana from 1710 to 1716.[citation needed] French attempts to consolidate the fur trade led to the Fox Wars, in which the Meskwaki (Fox) and their allies fought the French and their Native allies.[citation needed] At the same time, the French strengthened Fort Michilimackinac at the Straits of Mackinac to better control their lucrative fur-trading empire. By the mid-18th century, the French also occupied forts at present-day Niles and Sault Ste. Marie, though most of the rest of the region remained unsettled by Europeans. France offered free land to attract families to Detroit, which grew to 800 people in 1765. It was the largest city between Montreal and New Orleans.[24] French settlers also established small farms south of the Detroit River opposite the fort, near a Jesuit mission and Huron village. From 1660 until the end of French rule, Michigan was part of the Royal Province of New France.[d] In 1760, Montreal fell to the British forces, ending the French and Indian War (1754–1763), the North American front of the Seven Years' War in Europe. Under the 1763 Treaty of Paris, Michigan and the rest of New France east of the Mississippi River were ceded by defeated France to Great Britain.[25] After the Quebec Act was passed in 1774, Michigan became part of the British Province of Quebec. By 1778, Detroit's population reached 2,144 and it was the third-largest city in Quebec province.[26] During the American Revolutionary War, Detroit was an important British supply center. Most of the inhabitants were French-Canadians or American Indians, many of whom had been allied with the French because of long trading ties. Because of imprecise cartography and unclear language defining the boundaries in the 1783 Treaty of Paris, the British retained control of Detroit and Michigan after the American Revolution. When Quebec split into Lower and Upper Canada in 1791, Michigan was part of Kent County, Upper Canada. It held its first democratic elections in August 1792 to send delegates to the new provincial parliament at Newark (now Niagara-on-the-Lake).[27] Under terms negotiated in the 1794 Jay Treaty, Britain withdrew from Detroit and Michilimackinac in 1796. It retained control of territory east and south of the Detroit River, which are now included in Ontario, Canada. Questions remained over the boundary for many years, and the United States did not have uncontested control of the Upper Peninsula and Drummond Island until 1818 and 1847, respectively. During the War of 1812, the United States forces at Fort Detroit surrendered Michigan Territory (effectively consisting of Detroit and the surrounding area) after a nearly bloodless siege in 1812. A U.S. attempt to retake Detroit resulted in a severe American defeat in the River Raisin Massacre. This battle, still ranked as the bloodiest ever fought in the state, had the highest number of American casualties of any battle of the war. Michigan was recaptured by the Americans in 1813 after the Battle of Lake Erie. They used Michigan as a base to launch an invasion of Canada, which culminated in the Battle of the Thames. But the more northern areas of Michigan were held by the British until the peace treaty restored the old boundaries. A number of forts, including Fort Wayne, were built by the United States in Michigan during the 19th century out of fears of renewed fighting with Britain. Michigan Territory governor and judges established the University of Michigan in 1817, as the Catholepistemiad, or the University of Michigania.[28] The population grew slowly until the opening in 1825 of the Erie Canal through the Mohawk Valley in New York, connecting the Great Lakes to the Hudson River and New York City.[29] The new route attracted a large influx of settlers to the Michigan territory. They worked as farmers, lumbermen, shipbuilders, and merchants and shipped out grain, lumber, and iron ore. By the 1830s, Michigan had 30,000 residents, more than enough to apply and qualify for statehood.[30] On November 1, 1935, the U.S. Post Office issued a commemorative 3-cent stamp celebrating the 100th anniversary of Michigan statehood. Michigan's statehood, however, wasn't officially established until January 26, 1837, but since the campaign for statehood actually began in 1835, Michigan chose to hold its centennial celebration in 1935, the year the stamp was first issued.[31] A constitutional convention of assent was held to lead the territory to statehood.[32] In October 1835 the people approved the constitution of 1835, thereby forming a state government. Congressional recognition was delayed pending resolution of a boundary dispute with Ohio known as the Toledo War. Congress awarded the \"Toledo Strip\" to Ohio. Michigan received the western part of the Upper Peninsula as a concession and formally entered the Union as a free state on January 26, 1837. The Upper Peninsula proved to be a rich source of lumber, iron, and copper. Michigan led the nation in lumber production from the 1850s to the 1880s. Railroads became a major engine of growth from the 1850s onward, with Detroit the chief hub. A second wave of French-Canadian immigrants settled in Michigan during the late 19th to early 20th century, working in lumbering areas in counties on the Lake Huron side of the Lower Peninsula, such as the Saginaw Valley, Alpena, and Cheboygan counties, as well as throughout the Upper Peninsula, with large concentrations in Escanaba and the Keweenaw Peninsula.[33] The first statewide meeting of the Republican Party took place on July 6, 1854, in Jackson, Michigan, where the party adopted its platform.[citation needed] The state was predominantly Republican until the 1930s, reflecting the political continuity of migrants from across the Northern Tier of New England and New York.[citation needed] Michigan made a significant contribution to the Union in the American Civil War and sent more than forty regiments of volunteers to the federal armies.[citation needed] Michigan modernized and expanded its system of education in this period.[citation needed] The Michigan State Normal School, now Eastern Michigan University, was founded in 1849, for the training of teachers.[citation needed] It was the fourth oldest normal school in the United States and the first U.S. normal school outside New England.[citation needed] In 1899, the Michigan State Normal School became the first normal school in the nation to offer a four-year curriculum. Michigan Agricultural College (1855), now Michigan State University in East Lansing, was founded as the first agricultural college in the nation.[citation needed] Many private colleges were founded as well, and the smaller cities established high schools late in the century.[34] Michigan's economy underwent a transformation at the turn of the 20th century. Many individuals, including Ransom E. Olds, John and Horace Dodge, Henry Leland, David Dunbar Buick, Henry Joy, Charles King, and Henry Ford, provided the concentration of engineering know-how and technological enthusiasm to develop the automotive industry.[35] Ford's development of the moving assembly line in Highland Park marked a new era in transportation.[citation needed] Like the steamship and railroad, mass production of automobiles was a far-reaching development. More than the forms of public transportation, the affordable automobile transformed private life. Automobile production became the major industry of Detroit and Michigan, and permanently altered the socioeconomic life of the United States and much of the world.[citation needed] With the growth, the auto industry created jobs in Detroit that attracted immigrants from Europe and migrants from across the United States, including both blacks and whites from the rural South.[citation needed] By 1920, Detroit was the fourth-largest city in the U.S..[citation needed] Residential housing was in short supply, and it took years for the market to catch up with the population boom.[citation needed] By the 1930s, so many immigrants had arrived that more than 30 languages were spoken in the public schools, and ethnic communities celebrated in annual heritage festivals.[36] Over the years immigrants and migrants contributed greatly to Detroit's diverse urban culture, including popular music trends. The influential Motown Sound of the 1960s was led by a variety of individual singers and groups.[citation needed] Grand Rapids, the second-largest city in Michigan also became an important center of manufacturing. Since 1838, the city has been noted for its furniture industry.[37][38] In the 21st century, it is home to five of the world's leading office furniture companies. Grand Rapids is home to a number of major companies including Steelcase, Amway, and Meijer. Grand Rapids is also an important center for GE Aviation Systems. Michigan held its first United States presidential primary election in 1910.[citation needed] With its rapid growth in industry, it was an important center of industry-wide union organizing, such as the rise of the United Auto Workers.[citation needed] In 1920 WWJ (AM) in Detroit became the first radio station in the United States to regularly broadcast commercial programs. Throughout that decade, some of the country's largest and most ornate skyscrapers were built in the city. Particularly noteworthy are the Fisher Building, Cadillac Place, and the Guardian Building, each of which has been designated as a National Historic Landmark (NHL). In 1927 a school bombing took place in Clinton County. The Bath School disaster resulted in the deaths of 38 schoolchildren and constitutes the deadliest mass murder in a school in U.S. history.[39] Michigan converted much of its manufacturing to satisfy defense needs during World War II; it manufactured 10.9% of the United States military armaments produced during the war, ranking second (behind New York) among the 48 states.[40] Detroit continued to expand through the 1950s, at one point doubling its population in a decade. After World War II, housing was developed in suburban areas outside city cores to meet demand for residences. The federal government subsidized the construction of interstate highways, which were intended to strengthen military access, but also allowed commuters and business traffic to travel the region more easily. Since 1960, modern advances in the auto industry have led to increased automation, high-tech industry, and increased suburban growth. Longstanding tensions in Detroit culminated in the Twelfth Street riot in July 1967. During the late 1970s and the early 1980s, increasing fuel costs and other factors made significantly more global competition and recession among families. Michigan lost a significant amount of population due to global competition and the dramatic unavailability of manufacturing jobs.[41] Meanwhile, Michigan had increased use of technology, specifically when the IBM Personal Computer started selling in the state, in which became mostly used at work. Michigan became the leading auto-producing state in the U.S., with the industry primarily located throughout the Midwestern United States; Ontario, Canada; and the Southern United States.[42] With almost ten million residents in 2010, Michigan is a large and influential state, ranking tenth in population among the fifty states. Detroit is the centrally located metropolitan area of the Great Lakes megalopolis and the second-largest metropolitan area in the U.S. (after Chicago) linking the Great Lakes system. The Metro Detroit area in Southeast Michigan is the state's largest metropolitan area (roughly 50% of the population resides there) and the eleventh largest in the United States. The Grand Rapids metropolitan area in Western Michigan is the state's fastest-growing metro area, with more than 1.3 million residents as of 2006[update]. Michigan consists of two peninsulas separated by the Straits of Mackinac. The 45th parallel north runs through the state, marked by highway signs and the Polar-Equator Trail—[43] along a line including Mission Point Light near Traverse City, the towns of Gaylord and Alpena in the Lower Peninsula and Menominee in the Upper Peninsula. With the exception of two tiny areas drained by the Mississippi River by way of the Wisconsin River in the Upper Peninsula and by way of the Kankakee-Illinois River in the Lower Peninsula, Michigan is drained by the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence watershed and is the only state with the majority of its land thus drained. No point in the state is more than six miles (9.7 km) from a natural water source or more than 85 miles (137 km) from a Great Lakes shoreline.[44] The Great Lakes that border Michigan from east to west are Lake Erie, Lake Huron, Lake Michigan and Lake Superior. The state is bounded on the south by the states of Ohio and Indiana, sharing land and water boundaries with both. Michigan's western boundaries are almost entirely water boundaries, from south to north, with Illinois and Wisconsin in Lake Michigan; then a land boundary with Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula, that is principally demarcated by the Menominee and Montreal Rivers; then water boundaries again, in Lake Superior, with Wisconsin and Minnesota to the west, capped around by the Canadian province of Ontario to the north and east. The heavily forested Upper Peninsula is relatively mountainous in the west. The Porcupine Mountains, which are part of one of the oldest mountain chains in the world,[45] rise to an altitude of almost 2,000 feet (610 m) above sea level and form the watershed between the streams flowing into Lake Superior and Lake Michigan. The surface on either side of this range is rugged. The state's highest point, in the Huron Mountains northwest of Marquette, is Mount Arvon at 1,979 feet (603 m). The peninsula is as large as Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island combined but has fewer than 330,000 inhabitants. The people are sometimes called \"Yoopers\" (from \"U.P.'ers\"), and their speech (the \"Yooper dialect\") has been heavily influenced by the numerous Scandinavian and Canadian immigrants who settled the area during the lumbering and mining boom of the late 19th century. The Lower Peninsula is shaped like a mitten and many residents hold up a hand to depict where they are from.[46] It is 277 miles (446 km) long from north to south and 195 miles (314 km) from east to west and occupies nearly two-thirds of the state's land area. The surface of the peninsula is generally level, broken by conical hills and glacial moraines usually not more than a few hundred feet tall. It is divided by a low water divide running north and south. The larger portion of the state is on the west of this and gradually slopes toward Lake Michigan. The highest point in the Lower Peninsula is either Briar Hill at 1,705 feet (520 m), or one of several points nearby in the vicinity of Cadillac. The lowest point is the surface of Lake Erie at 571 feet (174 m). The geographic orientation of Michigan's peninsulas makes for a long distance between the ends of the state. Ironwood, in the far western Upper Peninsula, lies 630 miles (1,010 kilometers) by highway from Lambertville in the Lower Peninsula's southeastern corner. The geographic isolation of the Upper Peninsula from Michigan's political and population centers makes the region culturally and economically distinct. Frequent attempts to establish the Upper Peninsula as its own state have failed to gain traction.[47][48] A feature of Michigan that gives it the distinct shape of a mitten is the Thumb, which projects into Lake Huron, forming Saginaw Bay. Other notable peninsulas of Michigan include the Keweenaw Peninsula, which projects northeasterly into Lake Superior from the Upper Peninsula and largely comprising Michigan's Copper Country region, and the Leelanau Peninsula, projecting from the Lower Peninsula into Lake Michigan, forming Michigan's \"little finger\". Numerous lakes and marshes mark both peninsulas, and the coast is much indented. Keweenaw Bay, Whitefish Bay, and the Big and Little Bays De Noc are the principal indentations on the Upper Peninsula. The Grand and Little Traverse, Thunder, and Saginaw bays indent the Lower Peninsula. Michigan has the second longest shoreline of any state—3,288 miles (5,292 km),[49] including 1,056 miles (1,699 km) of island shoreline.[50] The state has numerous large islands, the principal ones being the North Manitou and South Manitou, Beaver, and Fox groups in Lake Michigan; Isle Royale and Grande Isle in Lake Superior; Marquette, Bois Blanc, and Mackinac islands in Lake Huron; and Neebish, Sugar, and Drummond islands in St. Mary's River. Michigan has about 150 lighthouses, the most of any U.S. state.[51] The first lighthouses in Michigan were built between 1818 and 1822. They were built to project light at night and to serve as a landmark during the day to safely guide the passenger ships and freighters traveling the Great Lakes (see: lighthouses in the United States). The state's rivers are generally small, short and shallow, and few are navigable. The principal ones include the Detroit River, St. Marys River, and St. Clair River which connect the Great Lakes; the Au Sable, Cheboygan, and Saginaw, which flow into Lake Huron; the Ontonagon, and Tahquamenon, which flow into Lake Superior; and the St. Joseph, Kalamazoo, Grand, Muskegon, Manistee, and Escanaba, which flow into Lake Michigan. The state has 11,037 inland lakes—totaling 1,305 square miles (3,380 km2) of inland water—in addition to 38,575 square miles (99,910 km2) of Great Lakes waters. No point in Michigan is more than six miles (9.7 km) from an inland lake or more than 85 miles (137 km) from one of the Great Lakes.[52] The state is home to several areas maintained by the National Park Service including: Isle Royale National Park, in Lake Superior, about 30 miles (48 km) southeast of Thunder Bay, Ontario. Other national protected areas in the state include: Keweenaw National Historical Park, Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore, Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore, Huron National Forest, Manistee National Forest, Hiawatha National Forest, Ottawa National Forest and Father Marquette National Memorial. The largest section of the North Country National Scenic Trail passes through Michigan. With 78 state parks, 19 state recreation areas, and six state forests, Michigan has the largest state park and state forest system of any state. Michigan has a continental climate with two distinct regions. The southern and central parts of the Lower Peninsula (south of Saginaw Bay and from the Grand Rapids area southward) have a warmer climate (Köppen climate classification Dfa) with hot summers and cold winters. The northern part of the Lower Peninsula and the entire Upper Peninsula has a more severe climate (Köppen Dfb), with warm, but shorter summers and longer, cold to very cold winters. Some parts of the state average high temperatures below freezing from December through February, and into early March in the far northern parts. During the winter through the middle of February, the state is frequently subjected to heavy lake-effect snow. The state averages from 30 to 40 inches (76 to 102 cm) of precipitation annually; however, some areas in the northern lower peninsula and the upper peninsula average almost 160 inches (4,100 mm) of snowfall per year.[53] Michigan's highest recorded temperature is 112 °F (44 °C) at Mio on July 13, 1936, and the coldest recorded temperature is −51 °F (−46 °C) at Vanderbilt on February 9, 1934.[54] The state averages 30 days of thunderstorm activity per year. These can be severe, especially in the southern part of the state. The state averages 17 tornadoes per year, which are more common in the state's extreme southern section. Portions of the southern border have been almost as vulnerable historically as states further west and in Tornado Alley. For this reason, many communities in the very southern portions of the state have tornado sirens to warn residents of approaching tornadoes. Farther north, in Central Michigan, Northern Michigan, and the Upper Peninsula, tornadoes are rare.[55][56] The geological formation of the state is greatly varied, with the Michigan Basin being the most major formation. Primary boulders are found over the entire surface of the Upper Peninsula (being principally of primitive origin), while Secondary deposits cover the entire Lower Peninsula. The Upper Peninsula exhibits Lower Silurian sandstones, limestones, copper and iron bearing rocks, corresponding to the Huronian system of Canada. The central portion of the Lower Peninsula contains coal measures and rocks of the Pennsylvanian period. Devonian and sub-Carboniferous deposits are scattered over the entire state. Michigan rarely experiences earthquakes, and those that it does experience are generally smaller ones that do not cause significant damage. A 4.6-magnitude earthquake struck in August 1947. More recently, a 4.2-magnitude earthquake occurred on Saturday, May 2, 2015, shortly after noon, about five miles south of Galesburg, Michigan (9 miles southeast of Kalamazoo) in central Michigan, about 140 miles west of Detroit, according to the Colorado-based U.S. Geological Survey's National Earthquake Information Center. No major damage or injuries were reported, according to then-Governor Rick Snyder's office.[57] State government is decentralized among three tiers—statewide, county and township. Counties are administrative divisions of the state, and townships are administrative divisions of a county. Both of them exercise state government authority, localized to meet the particular needs of their jurisdictions, as provided by state law. There are 83 counties in Michigan.[58] Cities, state universities, and villages are vested with home rule powers of varying degrees. Home rule cities can generally do anything not prohibited by law. The fifteen state universities have broad power and can do anything within the parameters of their status as educational institutions that is not prohibited by the state constitution. Villages, by contrast, have limited home rule and are not completely autonomous from the county and township in which they are located. There are two types of township in Michigan: general law township and charter. Charter township status was created by the Legislature in 1947 and grants additional powers and stream-lined administration in order to provide greater protection against annexation by a city. As of April 2001[update], there were 127 charter townships in Michigan. In general, charter townships have many of the same powers as a city but without the same level of obligations. For example, a charter township can have its own fire department, water and sewer department, police department, and so on—just like a city—but it is not required to have those things, whereas cities must provide those services. Charter townships can opt to use county-wide services instead, such as deputies from the county sheriff's office instead of a home-based force of ordinance officers. Since 1800 U.S. census, Michigan has experienced relatively positive and stable population growth trends; beginning with a population of 3,757, the 2010 census recorded 9,883,635 residents. At the 2020 United States census, its population was 10,077,331, an increase of 2.03% since 2010's tabulation. According to the United States Census Bureau, it is the third-most populous state in the Midwest and its East North Central subregion, behind Ohio and Illinois. The center of population of Michigan is in Shiawassee County, in the southeastern corner of the civil township of Bennington, which is northwest of the village of Morrice.[62] According to the American Immigration Council in 2019, an estimated 6.8% of Michiganders were immigrants, while 3.8% were native-born U.S. citizens with at least one immigrant parent.[63] Numbering approximately 678,255 according to the 2019 survey, the majority of Michigander immigrants came from Mexico (11.5%), India (11.3%), Iraq (7.5%), China (5.3%), and Canada (5.3%); the primary occupations of its immigrants were technology, agriculture, and healthcare. Among its immigrant cohort, there were 108,105 undocumented immigrants, making up 15.9% of the total immigrant population.[63] According to HUD's 2022 Annual Homeless Assessment Report, there were an estimated 8,206 homeless people in Michigan.[64][65] Since colonial European and American settlement, the majority of Michigan's population has been predominantly non-Hispanic or non-Latino white; Americans of European descent live throughout every county in the state, and most of Metro Detroit. Large European American groups include those of German, British, Irish, Polish and Belgian ancestry.[70] Scandinavian and Finnish Americans have a notable presence in the Upper Peninsula.[71] Western Michigan is known for its Dutch heritage, especially in Holland and metropolitan Grand Rapids.[72] Black and African Americans—coming to Detroit and other northern cities in the Great Migration of the early 20th century—have formed a majority of the population in Detroit and other cities including Flint and Benton Harbor. Since the 2021 census estimates—while Detroit was still the largest city in Michigan with a majority black population—it was no longer the largest black-majority city in the U.S., citing crime and higher-paying jobs given to whites.[73][74] As of 2007[update], about 300,000 people in Southeastern Michigan trace their descent from the Middle East and Asia.[75] Dearborn has a sizeable Arab American community, with many Assyrians, and Lebanese who immigrated for jobs in the auto industry in the 1920s, along with more recent Yemenis and Iraqis.[76] As of 2007[update], almost 8,000 Hmong people lived in the state of Michigan, about double their 1999 presence in the state.[77] Most lived in northeastern Detroit, but they had been increasingly moving to Pontiac and Warren.[78] By 2015, the number of Hmong in the Detroit city limits had significantly declined.[79] Lansing hosts a statewide Hmong New Year Festival.[78] The Hmong community also had a prominent portrayal in the 2008 film Gran Torino, which was set in Detroit. As of 2015[update], 80% of Michigan's Japanese population lived in the counties of Macomb, Oakland, Washtenaw, and Wayne in the Detroit and Ann Arbor areas.[80] As of April 2013[update], the largest Japanese national population is in Novi, with 2,666 Japanese residents, and the next largest populations are respectively in Ann Arbor, West Bloomfield Township, Farmington Hills, and Battle Creek. The state has 481 Japanese employment facilities providing 35,554 local jobs. 391 of them are in Southeast Michigan, providing 20,816 jobs, and the 90 in other regions in the state provide 14,738 jobs. The Japanese Direct Investment Survey of the Consulate-General of Japan, Detroit stated more than 2,208 additional Japanese residents were employed in the State of Michigan as of 1 October 2012[update], than in 2011.[81] During the 1990s, the Japanese population of Michigan experienced an increase, and many Japanese people with children moved to particular areas for their proximity to Japanese grocery stores and high-performing schools.[80] In 2010, about 91.11% (8,507,947) of Michigan residents age five and older spoke only English at home, while 2.93% (273,981) spoke Spanish, 1.04% (97,559) Arabic, 0.44% (41,189) German, 0.36% (33,648) Chinese (which includes Mandarin), 0.31% (28,891) French, 0.29% (27,019) Polish, and Syriac languages (such as Modern Aramaic and Northeastern Neo-Aramaic) was spoken as a main language by 0.25% (23,420) of the population over the age of five. In total, 8.89% (830,281) of Michigan's population age five and older spoke a mother language other than English.[82] Since 2021, 90.1% of residents aged five and older spoke only English at home, and Spanish was the second-most spoken language with 2.9% of the population speaking it.[83] Religious self-identification, per Public Religion Research Institute's 2021 American Values Survey[84] Following British and French colonization of the region surrounding Michigan, Christianity became the dominant religion, with Roman Catholicism historically being the largest single Christian group for the state. Until the 19th century, the Roman Catholic Church was the only organized religious group in Michigan, reflecting the territory's French colonial roots. Detroit's St. Anne's parish, established in 1701 by Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac, is the second-oldest Roman Catholic parish in the United States.[85] On March 8, 1833, the Holy See formally established a diocese in the Michigan territory, which included all of Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and the Dakotas east of the Mississippi River. When Michigan became a state in 1837, the boundary of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Detroit was redrawn to coincide with that of the state; the other dioceses were later carved out from the Detroit Diocese but remain part of the Ecclesiastical Province of Detroit.[86] Several Native American religions have been practiced in Michigan. In 2020, there were 1,492,732 adherents of Roman Catholicism.[87] There's also a significant Independent Catholic presence in Metro Detroit, including the Ecumenical Catholic Church of Christ established by Archbishop Karl Rodig; the see of this church operates in a former Roman Catholic parish church.[88][89][90] With the introduction of Protestantism to the state, it began to form the largest collective Christian group. In 2010, the Association of Religion Data Archives reported the largest Protestant denomination was the United Methodist Church with 228,521 adherents;[91] followed by the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod with 219,618, and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America with 120,598 adherents. The Christian Reformed Church in North America had almost 100,000 members and more than 230 congregations in Michigan.[92] The Reformed Church in America had 76,000 members and 154 congregations in the state.[93] By the 2020 study, non- and inter-denominational Protestant churches formed the largest Protestant group in Michigan, numbering 508,904. The Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod grew to become the second-largest single Christian denomination, and United Methodists declined to being the third-largest. The Lutheran Protestant tradition was introduced by German and Scandinavian immigrants. Altogether, Baptists numbered 321,581 between the National Missionary Baptists, National Baptists, American Baptists, Southern Baptists, National Baptists of America, Progressive National Baptists, and Full Gospel Baptists; black Baptists formed the largest constituency.[87] In West Michigan, Dutch immigrants fled from the specter of religious persecution and famine in the Netherlands around 1850 and settled in and around what is now Holland, Michigan, establishing a \"colony\" on American soil that fervently held onto Calvinist doctrine that established a significant presence of Reformed churches.[94] In the same 2010 survey, Jewish adherents in the state of Michigan were estimated at 44,382, and Muslims at 120,351.[95] The first Jewish synagogue in the state was Temple Beth El, founded by twelve German Jewish families in Detroit in 1850.[96] Islam was introduced by immigrants from the Near East during the 20th century.[97] Michigan is home to the largest mosque in North America, the Islamic Center of America in Dearborn. Battle Creek, Michigan, is also the birthplace of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, which was founded on May 21, 1863.[98][99] Source: Fortune[100] In 2017, 3,859,949 people in Michigan were employed at 222,553 establishments, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.[101] The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis estimated Michigan's Q1 2023 gross state product to be $645.293 billion, ranking 14th out of the 50 states.[102] According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, as of August 2023[update], the state's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was estimated at 3.7%.[103] Products and services include automobiles, food products, information technology, aerospace, military equipment, furniture, and mining of copper and iron ore.[quantify] Michigan is the third-largest grower of Christmas trees with 60,520 acres (245 km2) of land dedicated to Christmas tree farming in 2007.[104][105] The beverage Vernors Ginger Ale was invented in Michigan in 1866, sharing the title of oldest soft drink with Hires Root Beer. Faygo was founded in Detroit on November 4, 1907. Two of the top four pizza chains were founded in Michigan and are headquartered there: Domino's Pizza by Tom Monaghan and Little Caesars Pizza by Mike Ilitch. Michigan became the 24th right-to-work state in the U.S. in 2012, however, in 2023 this law was repealed.[106] Since 2009, GM, Ford and Chrysler have managed a significant reorganization of their benefit funds structure after a volatile stock market which followed the September 11 attacks and early 2000s recession impacted their respective U.S. pension and benefit funds (OPEB).[107] General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler reached agreements with the United Auto Workers Union to transfer the liabilities for their respective health care and benefit funds to a 501(c)(9) Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association (VEBA). Manufacturing in the state grew 6.6% from 2001 to 2006,[108] but the high speculative price of oil became a factor for the U.S. auto industry during the economic crisis of 2008 impacting industry revenues. In 2009, GM and Chrysler emerged from Chapter 11 restructurings with financing provided in part by the U.S. and Canadian governments.[109][110] GM began its initial public offering (IPO) of stock in 2010.[111] For 2010, the Big Three domestic automakers have reported significant profits indicating the beginning of rebound.[112][113][114][115] As of 2002[update], Michigan ranked fourth in the U.S. in high-tech employment with 568,000 high-tech workers, which includes 70,000 in the automotive industry.[116] Michigan typically ranks third or fourth in overall research and development (R&D) expenditures in the United States.[117][118] Its research and development, which includes automotive, comprises a higher percentage of the state's overall gross domestic product than for any other U.S. state.[119] The state is an important source of engineering job opportunities. The domestic auto industry accounts directly and indirectly for one of every ten jobs in the U.S.[120] Michigan was second in the U.S. in 2004 for new corporate facilities and expansions. From 1997 to 2004, Michigan was the only state to top the 10,000 mark for the number of major new developments;[42][121] however, the effects of the late 2000s recession have slowed the state's economy. In 2008, Michigan placed third in a site selection survey among the states for luring new business which measured capital investment and new job creation per one million population.[122] In August 2009, Michigan and Detroit's auto industry received $1.36 B in grants from the U.S. Department of Energy for the manufacture of electric vehicle technologies which is expected to generate 6,800 immediate jobs and employ 40,000 in the state by 2020.[123] From 2007 to 2009, Michigan ranked 3rd in the U.S. for new corporate facilities and expansions.[124][125] As leading research institutions, the University of Michigan, Michigan State University, and Wayne State University are important partners in the state's economy and its University Research Corridor.[126] Michigan's public universities attract more than $1.5 B in research and development grants each year.[127] The National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory is at Michigan State University. Michigan's workforce is well-educated and highly skilled, making it attractive to companies. It has the third highest number of engineering graduates nationally.[128] Detroit Metropolitan Airport is one of the nation's most recently expanded and modernized airports with six major runways, and large aircraft maintenance facilities capable of servicing and repairing a Boeing 747 and is a major hub for Delta Air Lines. Michigan's schools and colleges rank among the nation's best. The state has maintained its early commitment to public education. The state's infrastructure gives it a competitive edge; Michigan has 38 deep water ports.[129] In 2007, Bank of America announced that it would commit $25 billion to community development in Michigan following its acquisition of LaSalle Bank in Troy.[130] Michigan led the nation in job creation improvement in 2010.[131] On December 20, 2019, Governor Gretchen Whitmer signed a package of bills into law effectively legalizing online gambling activities in Michigan, which allowed commercial and tribal casinos to apply for internet gaming licenses.[132] Michigan's personal income tax is a flat rate of 4.25%. In addition, 22 cities impose income taxes; rates are set at 1% for residents and 0.5% for non-residents in all but four cities.[133] Michigan's state sales tax is 6%, though items such as food and medication are exempted. Property taxes are assessed on the local level, but every property owner's local assessment contributes six mills (a rate of $6 per $1000 of property value) to the statutory State Education Tax. Property taxes are appealable to local boards of review and need the approval of the local electorate to exceed millage rates prescribed by state law and local charters. In 2011, the state repealed its business tax and replaced it with a 6% corporate income tax which substantially reduced taxes on business.[134][135] Article IX of the Constitution of the State of Michigan also provides limitations on how much the state can tax. A 6% use tax is levied on goods purchased outside the state (that are brought in and used in state), at parity with the sales tax.[136] The use tax applies to internet sales/purchases from outside Michigan and is equivalent to the sales tax.[137] A wide variety of commodity crops, fruits, and vegetables are grown in Michigan, making it second only to California among US states in the diversity of its agriculture.[138] The state has 54,800 farms utilizing 10,000,000 acres (40,000 km2) of land which sold $6.49 billion worth of products in 2010.[139] The most valuable agricultural product is milk. Leading crops include corn, soybeans, flowers, wheat, sugar beets, and potatoes. Livestock in the state included 78,000 sheep, a million cattle, a million hogs, and more than three million chickens. Livestock products accounted for 38% of the value of agricultural products while crops accounted for the majority. Michigan is a leading grower of fruit in the US, including blueberries, tart cherries, apples, grapes, and peaches.[140][141] Plums, pears, and strawberries are also grown in Michigan. These fruits are mainly grown in West Michigan due to the moderating effect of Lake Michigan on the climate. There is also significant fruit production, especially cherries, but also grapes, apples, and other fruits, in northwest Michigan along Lake Michigan. Michigan produces wines, beers and a multitude of processed food products. Kellogg's cereal is based in Battle Creek, Michigan and processes many locally grown foods. Thornapple Valley, Ball Park Franks, Koegel Meat Company, and Hebrew National sausage companies are all based in Michigan. Michigan is home to very fertile land in the Saginaw Valley and Thumb areas. Products grown there include corn, sugar beets, navy beans, and soybeans. Sugar beet harvesting usually begins the first of October. It takes the sugar factories about five months to process the 3.7 million tons of sugarbeets into 485,000 tons of pure, white sugar.[142] Michigan's largest sugar refiner, Michigan Sugar Company[143] is the largest east of the Mississippi River and the fourth largest in the nation. Michigan sugar brand names are Pioneer Sugar and the newly incorporated Big Chief Sugar. Potatoes are grown in Northern Michigan, and corn is dominant in Central Michigan. Alfalfa, cucumbers, and asparagus are also grown. As of 2011, Michigan's tourists spent $17.2 billion per year in the state, supporting 193,000 tourism jobs.[144] Michigan's tourism website ranks among the busiest in the nation.[145] Destinations draw vacationers, hunters, and nature enthusiasts from across the United States and Canada. Michigan is over 50% forest land,[146] much of it quite remote. The forests, lakes and thousands of miles of beaches are top attractions. Event tourism draws large numbers to occasions like the Tulip Time Festival and the National Cherry Festival. In 2006, the Michigan State Board of Education mandated all public schools in the state hold their first day of school after Labor Day, in accordance with the new post-Labor Day school law. A survey found 70% of all tourism business comes directly from Michigan residents, and the Michigan Hotel, Motel, & Resort Association claimed the shorter summer between school years cut into the annual tourism season.[147] However, a bill introduced in 2023 would cancel this requirement, allowing individual districts to decide when their school year should begin.[148][149] Tourism in metropolitan Detroit draws visitors to leading attractions, especially The Henry Ford, the Detroit Institute of Arts, the Detroit Zoo, and to sports in Detroit. Other museums include the Detroit Historical Museum, the Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History, museums in the Cranbrook Educational Community, and the Arab American National Museum. The metro area offers four major casinos, MGM Grand Detroit, Hollywood Casino, Motor City, and Caesars Windsor in Windsor, Ontario, Canada; moreover, Detroit is the largest American city and metropolitan region to offer casino resorts.[150] Hunting and fishing are significant industries in the state. Charter boats are based in many Great Lakes cities to fish for salmon, trout, walleye, and perch. Michigan ranks first in the nation in licensed hunters (over one million) who contribute $2 billion annually to its economy. More than three-quarters of a million hunters participate in white-tailed deer season alone. Many school districts in rural areas of Michigan cancel school on the opening day of firearm deer season, because of attendance concerns.[citation needed] Michigan's Department of Natural Resources manages the largest dedicated state forest system in the nation. The forest products industry and recreational users contribute $12 billion and 200,000 associated jobs annually to the state's economy. Public hiking and hunting access has also been secured in extensive commercial forests. The state has the highest number of golf courses and registered snowmobiles in the nation.[151] The state has numerous historical markers, which can themselves become the center of a tour.[152] The Great Lakes Circle Tour is a designated scenic road system connecting all of the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River.[153] With its position in relation to the Great Lakes and the countless ships that have foundered over the many years they have been used as a transport route for people and bulk cargo, Michigan is a world-class scuba diving destination. The Michigan Underwater Preserves are 11 underwater areas where wrecks are protected for the benefit of sport divers. Michigan music is known for three music trends: early punk rock, Motown/soul music and techno music. Michigan musicians include Tally Hall, Bill Haley & His Comets, the Supremes, the Marvelettes, the Temptations, the Four Tops, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye \"The Prince of Soul\", Smokey Robinson and the Miracles, Aretha Franklin, Mary Wells, Tommy James and the Shondells, ? and the Mysterians, Al Green, The Spinners, Grand Funk Railroad, the Stooges, the MC5, the Knack, Madonna \"The Queen of Pop\", Bob Seger, Jack Scott, Ray Parker Jr., Jackie Wilson, Aaliyah, Eminem, Babytron, Kid Rock, Jack White and Meg White (the White Stripes), Big Sean, Alice Cooper, Greta Van Fleet, Mustard Plug, and Del Shannon.[154] Major theaters in Michigan include the Fox Theatre, Music Hall, Gem Theatre, Masonic Temple Theatre, the Detroit Opera House, Fisher Theatre, The Fillmore Detroit, Saint Andrew's Hall, Majestic Theater, and Orchestra Hall. The Nederlander Organization, the largest controller of Broadway productions in New York City, originated in Detroit.[155] Michigan's major-league sports teams include: Detroit Tigers baseball team, Detroit Lions football team, Detroit Red Wings ice hockey team, and the Detroit Pistons men's basketball team. All of Michigan's major league teams play in the Metro Detroit area. The state also has a professional second-tier (USL Championship) soccer team in Detroit City FC, which plays its home games at Keyworth Stadium in Hamtramck, Michigan. The Pistons played at Detroit's Cobo Arena until 1978 and at the Pontiac Silverdome until 1988 when they moved into The Palace of Auburn Hills. In 2017, the team moved to the newly built Little Caesars Arena in downtown Detroit. The Detroit Lions played at Tiger Stadium in Detroit until 1974, then moved to the Pontiac Silverdome where they played for 27 years between 1975 and 2002 before moving to Ford Field in Detroit in 2002. The Detroit Tigers played at Tiger Stadium (formerly known as Navin Field and Briggs Stadium) from 1912 to 1999. In 2000 they moved to Comerica Park. The Red Wings played at Olympia Stadium before moving to Joe Louis Arena in 1979. They later moved to Little Caesars Arena to join the Pistons as tenants in 2017. Professional hockey got its start in 1903 in Houghton,[156] when the Portage Lakers were formed.[157] The Michigan International Speedway is the site of NASCAR races and Detroit was formerly the site of a Formula One World Championship Grand Prix race. From 1959 to 1961, Detroit Dragway hosted the NHRA's U.S. Nationals.[158] Michigan is home to one of the major canoeing marathons: the 120-mile (190 km) Au Sable River Canoe Marathon. The Port Huron to Mackinac Boat Race is also a favorite. Twenty-time Grand Slam champion Serena Williams was born in Saginaw. The 2011 World Champion for Women's Artistic Gymnastics, Jordyn Wieber is from DeWitt. Wieber was also a member of the gold medal team at the London Olympics in 2012. Collegiate sports in Michigan are popular in addition to professional sports. The state's two largest athletic programs are the Michigan Wolverines and Michigan State Spartans, which play in the NCAA Big Ten Conference. Michigan Stadium in Ann Arbor, home to the Michigan Wolverines football team, is the largest stadium in the Western Hemisphere and the third-largest stadium worldwide. The Michigan High School Athletic Association features around 300,000 participants. Michigan's education system serves 1.6 million K-12 students in public schools. More than 124,000 students attend private schools and an uncounted number are homeschooled under certain legal requirements.[159][160] The public school system had a $14.5 billion budget in 2008–09.[161] From 2009 to 2019, over 200 private schools in Michigan closed, partly due to competition from charter schools.[162] In 2022, U.S. News & World Report rated three Michigan high schools among the nation's 100 best: City High Middle School (18th), the International Academy of Macomb (21st), and the International Academy (52nd). Washtenaw International High School ranked 107th.[163] The University of Michigan is Michigan's oldest higher educational institution and among the oldest research universities in the nation. It was founded in 1817, 20 years before Michigan Territory achieved statehood.[164][165] Kalamazoo College is the state's oldest private liberal arts college, founded in 1833 by a group of Baptist ministers as the Michigan and Huron Institute. From 1840 to 1850, the college operated as the Kalamazoo Branch of the University of Michigan. Methodist settlers in Spring Arbor Township founded Albion College in 1835. It is the state's second-oldest private liberal arts college. Michigan Technological University is the first post-secondary institution in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, founded in 1885 as the Michigan Mining School. Eastern Michigan University was founded in 1849 as the Michigan State Normal School for the training of teachers. It was the nation's fourth-oldest normal school and the first U.S. normal school outside New England. In 1899, the Michigan State Normal School became the nation's first normal school to offer a four-year curriculum. Michigan State University was founded in 1855 as the nation's first agricultural college. The Carnegie Foundation classifies eight of the state's institutions (Michigan State University, Michigan Technological University, Eastern Michigan University, Wayne State University, Central Michigan University, Western Michigan University, Oakland University, University of Michigan) as research universities.[166] In 2020, Michigan consumed 113,740- gigawatt-hours (GWh) of electrical energy and produced 116,700 (GWh) of electrical energy.[167] Coal power is Michigan's leading source of electricity, producing roughly half its supply or 53,100 GWh of electrical energy (12.6 GW total capacity) in 2020.[167] Although Michigan has no active coal mines, coal is easily moved from other states by train and across the Great Lakes by lake freighters. The lower price of natural gas is leading to the closure of most coal plants, with Consumer Energy planning to close all of its remaining coal plants by 2025;[168] DTE plans to retire 2100MW of coal power by 2023.[169] The coal-fired Monroe Power Plant in Monroe, on the western shore of Lake Erie, is the nation's 11th-largest electric plant, with a net capacity of 3,400 MW. Nuclear power is also a significant source of electrical power in Michigan, producing roughly one-quarter of the state's supply or 28,000-gigawatt-hours (GWh) of electrical energy (4.3 GW total capacity) in 2020.[167] The three active nuclear power plants supply Michigan with about 26% of its electricity. Donald C. Cook Nuclear Plant, just north of Bridgman, is the state's largest nuclear power plant, with a net capacity of 2,213 MW. The Enrico Fermi Nuclear Generating Station is the second-largest, with a net capacity of 1,150 MW. It is also one of the two nuclear power plants in the Detroit metropolitan area (within a 50-mile radius of Detroit's city center), about halfway between Detroit and Toledo, Ohio, the other being the Davis–Besse Nuclear Power Station, in Ottawa County, Ohio. The Palisades Nuclear Power Plant, south of South Haven, closed in May 2022.[170] The Big Rock Point Nuclear Power Plant, Michigan's first nuclear power plant and the nation's fifth, was decommissioned in 1997. Utility companies were required to generate at least 10% of their energy from renewable sources by 2015, under Public Act 295 of 2008. In 2016, the legislature set another mandate to reach at least 12.5% renewable energy by 2019 and 15% by end of year 2021, which all utilities subject to the law successfully met. By the end of 2022, Michigan had at least 6 GW of renewable generating capacity, and was projected to have at least 8 GW by the end of 2026. Wind energy accounted for 59% of all Michigan energy credits in 2021.[171][172] Michigan has nine international road crossings with Ontario, Canada: The Gordie Howe International Bridge, a second international bridge between Detroit and Windsor, is under construction. It is expected to be completed in 2024.[173][174][175] Michigan is served by four Class I railroads: the Canadian National Railway, the Canadian Pacific Railway, CSX Transportation, and the Norfolk Southern Railway. These are augmented by several dozen short line railroads. The vast majority of rail service in Michigan is devoted to freight, with Amtrak and various scenic railroads the exceptions.[176] Three Amtrak passenger rail routes serve the state. The Pere Marquette from Chicago to Grand Rapids, the Blue Water from Chicago to Port Huron, and the Wolverine from Chicago to Pontiac. There are plans for commuter rail for Detroit and its suburbs (see SEMCOG Commuter Rail).[177][178][179] Detroit Metropolitan Airport in the western suburb of Romulus, was in 2010 the 16th busiest airfield in North America measured by passenger traffic.[180] The Gerald R. Ford International Airport in Grand Rapids is the next busiest airport in the state, served by eight airlines to 23 destinations. Flint Bishop International Airport is the third largest airport in the state, served by four airlines to several primary hubs. Other frequently trafficked airports include Cherry Capital Airport, in Traverse City; Kalamazoo/Battle Creek International Airport, serving the Kalamazoo and Battle Creek region; Capital Region International Airport, located outside of Lansing; and MBS International Airport serving the Midland, Bay City and Saginaw tri-city region. Additionally, smaller regional and local airports are located throughout the state including on several islands. Michigan is governed as a republic, with three branches of government: the executive branch consisting of the Governor of Michigan and the other independently elected constitutional officers; the legislative branch consisting of the House of Representatives and Senate; and the judicial branch. The Michigan Constitution allows for the direct participation of the electorate by statutory initiative and referendum, recall, and constitutional initiative and referral (Article II, § 9,[181] defined as \"the power to propose laws and to enact and reject laws, called the initiative, and the power to approve or reject laws enacted by the legislature, called the referendum. The power of initiative extends only to laws which the legislature may enact under this constitution\"). Lansing is the state capital and is home to all three branches of state government. The governor and the other state constitutional officers serve four-year terms and may be re-elected only once. The current governor is Gretchen Whitmer. Michigan has two official Governor's Residences; one is in Lansing, and the other is on Mackinac Island. The other constitutionally elected executive officers are the lieutenant governor, who is elected on a joint ticket with the governor; the secretary of state; and the attorney general. The lieutenant governor presides over the Senate (voting only in case of a tie) and is also a member of the cabinet. The secretary of state is the chief elections officer and is charged with running many licensure programs including motor vehicles, all of which are done through the branch offices of the secretary of state. The Michigan Legislature consists of a 38-member Senate and 110-member House of Representatives. Members of both houses of the legislature are elected through first past the post elections by single-member electoral districts of near-equal population that often have boundaries which coincide with county and municipal lines. Senators serve four-year terms concurrent to those of the governor, while representatives serve two-year terms. The Michigan State Capitol was dedicated in 1879 and has hosted the executive and legislative branches of the state ever since. The Michigan judiciary consists of two courts with primary jurisdiction (the Circuit Courts and the District Courts), one intermediate level appellate court (the Michigan Court of Appeals), and the Michigan Supreme Court. There are several administrative courts and specialized courts. District courts are trial courts of limited jurisdiction, handling most traffic violations, small claims, misdemeanors, and civil suits where the amount contended is below $25,000. District courts are often responsible for handling the preliminary examination and for setting bail in felony cases. District court judges are elected to terms of six years. In a few locations, municipal courts have been retained to the exclusion of the establishment of district courts. There are 57 circuit courts in the State of Michigan, which have original jurisdiction over all civil suits where the amount contended in the case exceeds $25,000 and all criminal cases involving felonies. Circuit courts are also the only trial courts in the State of Michigan which possess the power to issue equitable remedies. Circuit courts have appellate jurisdiction from district and municipal courts, as well as from decisions and decrees of state agencies. Most counties have their own circuit court, but sparsely populated counties often share them. Circuit court judges are elected to terms of six years. State appellate court judges are elected to terms of six years, but vacancies are filled by an appointment by the governor. There are four divisions of the Court of Appeals in Detroit, Grand Rapids, Lansing, and Marquette. Cases are heard by the Court of Appeals by panels of three judges, who examine the application of the law and not the facts of the case unless there has been grievous error pertaining to questions of fact. The Michigan Supreme Court consists of seven members who are elected on non-partisan ballots for staggered eight-year terms. The Supreme Court has original jurisdiction only in narrow circumstances but holds appellate jurisdiction over the entire state judicial system. Michigan has had four constitutions, the first of which was ratified on October 5 and 6, 1835.[182] There were also constitutions from 1850 and 1908, in addition to the current constitution from 1963. The current document has a preamble, 11 articles, and one section consisting of a schedule and temporary provisions. Michigan, like every U.S. state except Louisiana, has a common law legal system. Having been a Democratic-leaning state at the presidential level since the 1990s, Michigan has evolved into a swing state after Donald Trump won the state in 2016. Governors since the 1970s have alternated between the Democrats and Republicans, and statewide offices including attorney general, secretary of state, and senator have been held by members of both parties in varying proportion. Additionally, from 1994 until 2022, the governor-elect had always come from the party opposite the presidency. The Democratic Party has a slim majority of two seats in the Senate of the Michigan Legislature, and the House is currently deadlocked at 54 seats for each party. The state's congressional delegation is commonly split, with one party or the other typically holding a narrow majority. Michigan was the home of Gerald Ford, the 38th president of the United States. Born in Nebraska, he moved as an infant to Grand Rapids.[183][184] The Gerald R. Ford Museum is in Grand Rapids, and the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library is on the campus of his alma mater, the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. In a 2020 study, Michigan was ranked as the 13th easiest state for citizens to vote in.[185] In 2022, Michigan voters passed an amendment recognising abortion and contraceptive rights within the state's constitution.[186] Michigan is traditionally known as \"The Wolverine State\", and the University of Michigan uses the wolverine as its mascot. The association is well and long established: for example, many Detroiters volunteered to fight during the American Civil War and George Armstrong Custer, who led the Michigan Brigade, called them the \"Wolverines\". The origins of this association are obscure; it may derive from a busy trade in wolverine furs in Sault Ste. Marie in the 18th century or may recall a disparagement intended to compare early settlers in Michigan with the vicious mammal. Wolverines are, however, extremely rare in Michigan. A sighting in February 2004 near Ubly was the first confirmed sighting in Michigan in 200 years.[187] Another wolverine was found dead in 2010.[188] 44°N 85°W﻿ / ﻿44°N 85°W﻿ / 44; -85﻿ (State of Michigan)",

                "content": "Michigan is one of the fifty states in the United States of America. It is the 11th largest state in the United States. It is made up of two peninsulas (connected by the Mackinac Bridge), the only state to be so. It borders the U.S. states of Wisconsin, Indiana, Ohio, Minnesota, and Illinois. Its borders with Minnesota and Illinois are only by water. It also borders Canada by water. It was the 26th state to join the union on January 26, 1837. In 1847, Michigan became the first U.S. state to abolish the death penalty.[7] Native American tribes first settled in Michigan before the arrival of Europeans in the 17th century. It was then a territory under U.S control. Michigan is noted as the place where many automobiles were made, and it still shows today. Michigan is 50% forest, which makes it very useful to the lumber industry. It also borders four of the Great Lakes, which are some of the largest reservoirs of fresh water in the world. Lake Superior is the largest body of freshwater in the world. The state experiences four seasons, with the winter being predominant and severe in the north, while the south has more mild, equally long seasons. The northern areas are very popular for skiing in the winter. The National Ski Hall of Fame can be found in Ishpeming in the Upper Peninsula. It is surrounded by four of the five Great Lakes. It is also home to the largest mosque in North America, the Islamic Center of America in Dearborn. Due to the large amount of water surrounding the state, boating is very popular in the warmer months. There are more private boats registered in Michigan than in any other state. Many famous people have come from Michigan. They include the singer Madonna, the comedian Andy Richter, singer Stevie Wonder, Anthony Kiedis, former president Gerald Ford, singer Kid Rock, the former Reverend Jim Bakker, basketball legend Magic Johnson, Diana Ross, and Aretha Franklin, as well as being the home of Henry Ford, the founder of Ford Motor Company. The capital city of Michigan is Lansing, and large cities include Detroit, Ann Arbor, Flint, Grand Rapids, and Saginaw. Marquette is the largest city in the Upper Peninsula. Michigan has several state universities including Michigan State University, University of Michigan, Saginaw Valley State University, Grand Valley State University, Northern Michigan University and Western Michigan University.[8] The state also has many private colleges. The current governor is Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat who took office in January 2019, and its two national senators are Debbie Stabenow and Gary Peters, both Democrats. Out of its 13 congressmen, 7 are Democrats and 6 are Republicans. In any event, Michigan had once been reliably blue in presidential elections, having voted for the Democrat in presidential elections since 1988, but then in 2016 it swung red to support Donald Trump. It will be regarded in future as a swing state. Media related to Michigan at Wikimedia Commons",

                "content": "Shop TODAY Readers’ 32 most-shopped Amazon products of 2024 Sections Shows More Follow today More Brands The arrival of New Year's Day wraps up yet another holiday season. Whether you’re sad it’s over or happy to say “sayonara” to 2024, chances are good that you may have a few errands, returns or after-Christmas shopping to cross off your to-do list this New Year’s. Or perhaps you've got a gift card burning a hole in your wallet or simply need to stock on groceries or other essentials before returning to work. Regardless, you may be wondering what Walmart’s New Year’s hours are this year. Given the holidays are a seriously busy time, it can be difficult to keep up with various stores' open and close times since so many of them have special or adjusted hours throughout the season. Unsurprisingly, many retailers have modified hours on New Year's Eve or are closed on New Year’s Day given that it’s a federal holiday. If you’re curious which stores are open on New Year’s (and which ones are closed) we’ve got a full list for you to check out right here. But what about Walmart? Fortunately, TODAY.com spoke to a Walmart spokesperson to get all the details, and here’s what you need to know about Walmart’s New Year’s Eve and New Year's Day hours to help start the new year off on the right foot. New Year’s Eve falls on Tuesday, Dec. 31, this year. In the final hours of 2024, Walmart will be open for business as usual on New Year's Eve during normal hours. So, if you need last-minute ingredients for your New Year’s cocktails or toothpicks for appetizers, you'll have plenty of time to pick up everything you need. As always, since hours may vary from store to store, confirm your local store hours before heading out the door. Walmart was closed on both Thanksgiving and Christmas this year to allow their employees to enjoy a day off. But what about New Year’s Day 2025? While some other major retailers like Costco and Aldi will be closed in observance of the holiday, Walmart will be open. According to a spokesperson, “All stores will operate during normal business hours.” However, since different store locations have varying open and close times, you should definitely take a minute to confirm your local store hours before heading out the door. To make it easy, find a Walmart near you using the store locator, which we’ve conveniently added right here. Sarah Lemire is a lifestyle and entertainment reporter for TODAY based in New York City.

                "content": "Editions: En/lifestyle/tv-shows His coverage of the 9/11 attacks earned him countless awards. Aaron Brown was a legend in journalism. The prominent journalist and host, renowned for his coverage of the 9/11 attacks, died this Sunday at the age of 76, his family reported through CNN. Brown began his career at local TV stations in Seattle, Washington, where he worked for more than 15 years. In 1992, He moved to New York to work at ABC, where he was the founding host of World News Now and later a reporter for World News Tonight with Peter Jennings. After his time at ABC, Brown began working at CNN. The experienced reporter joined the network in July 2001, but his first on-air appearance was on September 1 of that year. His emotional coverage of the attack on the WTC has been immortalized in the annals of American journalism. Many still remember Brown's timely reporting from the roof of CNN's Manhattan headquarters. Brown was praised for shedding the journalist's required objectivity to give voice to the feelings of stunned viewers across the country. His former CNN colleague John Vause recalled the highlight of Brown's coverage. \"When he was live on air, he just stopped and looked at it. And paused. And he shared this moment that everybody was thinking, 'Good Lord. There are no words,'\" Vause recalled. Minutes later, Brown was forced to comment on another heartbreaking moment, saying, \"The South Tower, the second tower. The one on the left collapsed. It collapsed in a cascade of smoke and sparks. This is devastation. There are 50,000 people who normally go to work in the Trade Center buildings.\" The family did not share the cause of Aaron Brown'sdeath, but tributes poured in from major media outlets in the U.S. Extensive headlines were dedicated to the death of the journalist, who undoubtedly left a significant mark on the media throughout the country. In a statement, CNN noted that Brown won the Edward R. Murrow Award for his coverage of the attacks, as well as three Emmys throughout his career. Brown completed his journalism career as a teacher at Arizona State University's Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication, where he was an outstanding educator. © Unidad Editorial Información Deportiva, S.L.U.

                "content": "Follow: Aaron Brown, the renowned CNN anchor who gained prominence for his coverage of the September 11 attacks and his pivotal role in shaping the network’s evening news format, died Sunday at 76, his family said. Brown’s career in journalism began in local television in Seattle before becoming the founding anchor of ABC’s overnight news program “World News Now” and anchoring “World News Tonight Saturday.” He later joined CNN, where he became known for his incisive reporting. From 2001 to 2005, he anchored “NewsNight,” a program that combined breaking news with in-depth analysis, and earned acclaim for his ability to handle complex stories with sensitivity and tact. CNN’s Anderson Cooper called Brown “a great writer and broadcaster.” “Thoughtful, funny, and diligent, he had a truly unique talent and a beautiful way with words,” Cooper said. September 11, 2001, marked Brown’s first appearance on CNN. He hadn’t been scheduled to go on air that morning, but news was breaking. And that day and in the days that followed, he quickly became a guiding presence for millions of viewers. Brown’s coverage of the 9/11 attacks from the roof of CNN’s Manhattan office at 5 Penn Plaza near Madison Square Garden established him as a trusted figure during one of the darkest moments in American history, said CNN’s John Vause, who also reported from New York that day. Brown reported live on the attacks for 17 hours. “When he was live on air, he just stopped and looked at it. And paused. And he shared this moment that everybody was thinking, ‘Good Lord. There are no words,’” Vause said, remembering how Brown took off his reporter hat to react when the South Tower of the World Trade Center collapsed. Thrown into uncharted territory on his first day, Brown processed the unfolding horror with a poise that struck a chord with viewers. “The South Tower, the second tower. The one on the left collapsed. It collapsed in a cascade of smoke and sparks,” Brown said in his segment. “This is devastation. There are 50,000 people who normally go to work in the Trade Center buildings.” The following week, he went to Washington, DC. “He walked to a hotel foyer and everybody in that foyer stood up and applauded” to congratulate him on the live coverage, Vause added. A month after September 11, Pulitzer Prize-winning television critic Howard Rosenberg praised Brown in a column in The Los Angeles Times, calling him “the steadiest man on television.” Brown “is earnest and … trustworthy. A French horn in an industry dominated by kazoos.” Ultimately, Brown “was at a terrible place at the right time,” Rosenberg wrote. Brown embodied the mode of ABC’s Peter Jennings – “the anchorman’s anchor,” as Vause put him – shaping the nation’s perception of the tragedy with his calm demeanor and humanizing approach. While he shied away from fame – “He didn’t like being in the spotlight outside of his office hours,” Vause said – Brown’s legacy endures, marked by his dedication to mentoring and storytelling. Brown won the Edward R. Murrow Award for his 9/11 coverage. Despite the accolade, he remained modest about his work, believing his reporting paled in comparison to the heroism displayed by first responders. “I think when that building fell, I understood better than any other point in my life, before or since, what a hero meant. It’s not that we didn’t try to tell the story; it’s that the story itself is too great to tell,” Brown said in 2016. “A million things had been running through my mind about what might happen … it just never occurred to me that (the buildings) would come down,” Brown said. “It’s the only time I thought, ‘Maybe you just don’t have what it takes to do a story like this.’ Because it just had never occurred to me.” Brown left a lasting impact on those who worked with him, Vause said. He recalled how Brown taught him that the words “I don’t know” are perfectly acceptable in an industry that often demands certainty and quick feet. “That’s one of the greatest things he taught me as a reporter. But he also taught me to certainly lift my game and be a much better reporter, to be ready for those questions that only he could ask,” Vause added. “He was a tough guy to work for, but he could also be quite mentoring,” he said. “It was almost like doing your midterm finals every time you were doing a live shot with Aaron.” In the pre-talk era of broadcast journalism, Brown was “first and foremost a writer and craftsman,” a skill that earned him the respect of colleagues across the media landscape, said former CNN producer Jon Auerbach, who worked with him. “He had a biting sense of humor, and in the days before people spoke of a work-life balance, Aaron knew its value. Anchoring a program at 10 p.m. can be brutal, but Aaron was able to make time for what was important to him outside the studio, whether it be his wife and daughter or a round of golf,” Auerbach said. “He could bring everybody in if you were a regular of his show,” Vause said. “He had a very dry sense of humor, very very dry at times. But you were part of the family almost. And you knew the jokes.” David Fitzpatrick, a producer who worked closely with Brown at CNN, said he “always wanted the very best of people.” They collaborated on the acclaimed coverage of the 2004 tsunami disaster in Indonesia. “It was remarkable when we received a compliment from him,” Fitzpatrick said. “He was a signature anchor during his prime time. His legacy will mean concise writing, concise presentation and a calm demeanor in the face of crisis. Impactful, insightful and measured.” Throughout his tenure, Brown was recognized for his commitment to journalistic integrity and his ability to connect with viewers during critical, historic moments. Amanda Turnbull, a former CNN producer, lauded Brown’s strong grasp of news, saying, “His storytelling was driven by the facts, but his delivery was always deeply human.” Turnbull recalled how he instilled a culture of empathy in reporting, often reminding his team to be “prepared to fail if we wanted to be great.” Brown “had such a chemistry on camera,” former CNN correspondent Susan Candiotti said. “He had a genuine ability to connect with viewers. It felt as though he was talking directly to you. His essays – his writing – was especially powerful on major stories of the day – and painted a picture that made you think.” Candiotti recalled Brown’s handling of the November 2001 death of former Beatle George Harrison. “He wove a wonderful piece recalling Harrison’s life, his contribution to music and his place in the lives of a generation who remembered Harrison,” Candiotti said. “And if you didn’t know much about him before, Aaron made sure you did by the end.” As a young man, Brown hosted a radio talk show in Minneapolis before attending the University of Minnesota and serving in the Coast Guard Reserve, according to the university. Over his career, he received numerous accolades, including three Emmy Awards. Though he dropped out of university, he later became a respected journalism lecturer. “It was kind of like a full circle in many ways with him,” Vause said. Following his departure from CNN, Brown served as the Rhodes Chair in Public Policy and American Institutions at Arizona State University’s Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication, where his influence on broadcast journalism continued to resonate. “Aaron got to do the work that he loved - and he felt lucky to do that work as part of a community of people who were dedicated to good journalism and who became good friends,” said his wife, Charlotte Raynor. “Over the course of his career, Aaron worked morning shifts, night shifts, and of course the ‘Overnight’ (a program he absolutely loved working on), but he always found a way to make both ordinary and special times with our daughter Gabby and me,” Raynor said. “These last few years, when we have all been able to live in the same city, have been the sweetest time for Aaron and me.” CNN’s Adam Levine and Laura Dolan contributed to this report.

                "content": "By Ted Johnson Political Editor Aaron Brown, an anchor who earned widespread praise for incisive reporting and calm demeanor during CNN‘s coverage of 9/11, has died. He was 76. Brown died on Sunday, the network said, quoting a statement from his family. No cause of death was given. Brown won the Edward R. Murrow Award for his coverage of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, as he anchored from the top floor of the network’s Manhattan offices. That was his first appearance on the network, as he had previously been with ABC News, serving as anchor of World News Now and World News Tonight Sunday. He was not even supposed to start for several more weeks, but was enlisted for the national crisis. In the backdrop of Brown’s coverage were the huge plumes of smoke from the Twin Towers, engulfing lower Manhattan. A decade later, Brown told NPR, “In some ways, you were like too into it, too focused to be anything other than a reporter with the biggest story anyone had ever had.” As NPR noted, when the north tower collapsed, Brown became quiet. “Good Lord. There are no words.” Brown was born and raised in suburban Minneapolis and attended the University of Minnesota before joining the U.S. Coast Guard Reserve. He had started his broadcast career as a radio talk host in Minneapolis, but later moved to Los Angeles and then to Seattle, where he became a fixture of the local news broadcasts, first at KING-TV and later at KIRO-TV. DEADLINE RELATED VIDEO: In 1991, he and Lisa McRee became the founding anchors of the overnight newscast ABC News Now, and he also served as a correspondent on other network news programs. He also anchored the Saturday evening newscast and the Sunday edition of Good Morning America. Brown’s departure to CNN was to anchor a primetime news program, NewsNight, and he was lead anchor on breaking news coverage. Four years later, though, the network scrambled its lineup, and Brown’s show was replaced by Anderson Cooper, who drew widespread attention and praise for his coverage of Hurricane Katrina. At the time, Jonathan Klein, the president of CNN/US, told The New York Times that Brown was a “first-class news talent” but “there are only so many hours in the course of a day.” Brown later went on to anchor Wide Angle, a documentary series that aired on PBS stations, and taught journalism at Arizona State University.

            {
                "title": "Charging station - Wikipedia",
                "content": "A charging station, also known as a charge point, chargepoint, or electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE), is a power supply device that supplies electrical power for recharging plug-in electric vehicles (including battery electric vehicles, electric trucks, electric buses, neighborhood electric vehicles, and plug-in hybrid vehicles). There are two main types of EV chargers: Alternating current (AC) charging stations and direct current (DC) charging stations. Electric vehicle batteries can only be charged by direct current electricity, while most mains electricity is delivered from the power grid as alternating current. For this reason, most electric vehicles have a built-in AC-to-DC converter commonly known as the \"onboard charger\" (OBC). At an AC charging station, AC power from the grid is supplied to this onboard charger, which converts it into DC power to recharge the battery. DC chargers provide higher power charging (which requires much larger AC-to-DC converters) by building the converter into the charging station instead of the vehicle to avoid size and weight restrictions. The station then directly supplies DC power to the vehicle, bypassing the onboard converter. Most modern electric car models can accept both AC and DC power. Charging stations provide connectors that conform to a variety of international standards. DC charging stations are commonly equipped with multiple connectors to charge various vehicles that use competing standards. Public charging stations are typically found street-side or at retail shopping centers, government facilities, and other parking areas. Private charging stations are usually found at residences, workplaces, and hotels. Multiple standards have been established for charging technology to enable interoperability across vendors. Standards are available for nomenclature, power, and connectors. Tesla developed proprietary technology in these areas and began building its charging networking in 2012.[1] In 2011, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) defined the following terms:[2] The terms \"electric vehicle connector\" and \"electric vehicle inlet\" were previously defined in the same way under Article 625 of the United States National Electric Code (NEC) of 1999. NEC-1999 also defined the term \"electric vehicle supply equipment\" as the entire unit \"installed specifically for the purpose of delivering energy from the premises wiring to the electric vehicle\", including \"conductors ... electric vehicle connectors, attachment plugs, and all other fittings, devices, power outlets, or apparatuses\".[3] Tesla, Inc. uses the term charging station as the location of a group of chargers, and the term connector for an individual EVSE.[4] The National Electric Transportation Infrastructure Working Council (IWC) was formed in 1991 by the Electric Power Research Institute with members drawn from automotive manufacturers and the electric utilities to define standards in the United States;[6] early work by the IWC led to the definition of three levels of charging in the 1999 National Electric Code (NEC) Handbook.[5]: 9 Under the 1999 NEC, Level 1 charging equipment (as defined in the NEC handbook but not in the code) was connected to the grid through a standard NEMA 5-20R 3-prong electrical outlet with grounding, and a ground-fault circuit interrupter was required within 12 in (30 cm) of the plug. The supply circuit required protection at 125% of the maximum rated current; for example, charging equipment rated at 16 amperes (\"amps\" or \"A\") continuous current required a breaker sized to 20 A.[5]: 9 Level 2 charging equipment (as defined in the handbook) was permanently wired and fastened at a fixed location under NEC-1999. It also required grounding and ground-fault protection; in addition, it required an interlock to prevent vehicle startup during charging and a safety breakaway for the cable and connector. A 40 A breaker (125% of continuous maximum supply current) was required to protect the branch circuit.[5]: 9 For convenience and speedier charging, many early EVs preferred that owners and operators install Level 2 charging equipment, which was connected to the EV either through an inductive paddle (Magne Charge) or a conductive connector (Avcon).[5]: 10–11, 18 Level 3 charging equipment used an off-vehicle rectifier to convert the input AC power to DC, which was then supplied to the vehicle. At the time it was written, the 1999 NEC handbook anticipated that Level 3 charging equipment would require utilities to upgrade their distribution systems and transformers.[5]: 9 The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE International) defines the general physical, electrical, communication, and performance requirements for EV charging systems used in North America, as part of standard SAE J1772, initially developed in 2001.[8] SAE J1772 defines four levels of charging, two levels each for AC and DC supplies; the differences between levels are based upon the power distribution type, standards and maximum power. AC charging stations connect the vehicle's onboard charging circuitry directly to the AC supply.[8] Commonly, though incorrectly, called \"Level 3\" charging based on the older NEC-1999 definition, DC charging is categorized separately in the SAE standard. In DC fast-charging, grid AC power is passed through an AC-to-DC converter in the station before reaching the vehicle's battery, bypassing any AC-to-DC converter on board the vehicle.[8][9] Additional standards released by SAE for charging include SAE J3068 (three-phase AC charging, using the Type 2 connector defined in IEC 62196-2) and SAE J3105 (automated connection of DC charging devices). In 2003, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) adopted a majority of the SAE J1772 standard under IEC 62196-1 for international implementation. The IEC alternatively defines charging in modes (IEC 61851-1): The connection between the electric grid and \"charger\" (electric vehicle supply equipment) is defined by three cases (IEC 61851-1): The North American Charging System (NACS) was developed by Tesla, Inc. for use in the company's vehicles. It remained a proprietary standard until 2022 when its specifications were published by Tesla.[13][14] The connector is physically smaller than the J1172/CCS connector, and uses the same pins for both AC and DC charging functionality. As of November 2023, automakers Ford, General Motors, Rivian, Volvo, Polestar, Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, Honda, Jaguar, Fisker, Hyundai, BMW, Toyota, Subaru, and Lucid Motors have all committed to equipping their North American vehicles with NACS connectors in the future.[15][16][17] Automotive startup Aptera Motors has also adopted the connector standard in its vehicles.[18] Other automakers, such as Stellantis and Volkswagen have not made an announcement.[19] To meet European Union (EU) requirements on recharging points,[20] Tesla vehicles sold in the EU are equipped with a CCS Combo 2 port. Both the North America and the EU port take 480 V DC fast charging through Tesla's network of Superchargers, which variously use NACS and CCS charging connectors. Depending on the Supercharger version, power is supplied at 72, 150, or 250 kW, the first corresponding to DC Level 1 and the second and third corresponding to DC Level 2 of SAE J1772. As of Q4 2021, Tesla reported 3,476 supercharging locations worldwide and 31,498 supercharging chargers (about 9 chargers per location on average).[4] An extension to the CCS DC fast-charging standard for electric cars and light trucks is under development, which will provide higher power charging for large commercial vehicles (Class 8, and possibly 6 and 7 as well, including school and transit buses). When the Charging Interface Initiative e. V. (CharIN) task force was formed in March 2018, the new standard being developed was originally called High Power Charging (HPC) for Commercial Vehicles (HPCCV),[21] later renamed Megawatt Charging System (MCS). MCS is expected to operate in the range of 200–1500 V and 0–3000 A for a theoretical maximum power of 4.5 megawatts (MW). The proposal calls for MCS charge ports to be compatible with existing CCS and HPC chargers.[22] The task force released aggregated requirements in February 2019, which called for maximum limits of 1000 V DC (optionally, 1500 V DC) and 3000 A continuous rating.[23] A connector design was selected in May 2019[21] and tested at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in September 2020. Thirteen manufacturers participated in the test, which checked the coupling and thermal performance of seven vehicle inlets and eleven charger connectors.[24] The final connector requirements and specification was adopted in December 2021 as MCS connector version 3.2.[25][26]: 3 With support from Portland General Electric, on 21 April 2021 Daimler Trucks North America opened the \"Electric Island\", the first heavy-duty vehicle charging station, across the street from its headquarters in Portland, Oregon. The station is capable of charging eight vehicles simultaneously, and the charging bays are sized to accommodate tractor-trailers. In addition, the design is capable of accommodating >1 MW chargers once they are available.[27] A startup company, WattEV, announced plans in May 2021 to build a 40-stall truck stop/charging station in Bakersfield, California. At full capacity, it would provide a combined 25 MW of charging power, partially drawn from an on-site solar array and battery storage.[28] Common connectors include Type 1 (Yazaki), Type 2 (Mennekes), CCS Combo 1 and 2, CHAdeMO, and Tesla.[29][30][31] Many standard plug types are defined in IEC 62196-2 (for AC supplied power) and 62196-3 (for DC supplied power): CCS DC charging requires power-line communication (PLC). Two connectors are added at the bottom of Type 1 or Type 2 vehicle inlets and charging plugs to supply DC current. These are commonly known as Combo 1 or Combo 2 connectors. The choice of style inlets is normally standardized on a per-country basis so that public chargers do not need to fit cables with both variants. Generally, North America uses Combo 1 style vehicle inlets, while most of the rest of the world uses Combo 2. The CHAdeMO standard is favored by Nissan, Mitsubishi, and Toyota, while the SAE J1772 Combo standard is backed by GM, Ford, Volkswagen, BMW, and Hyundai. Both systems charge to 80% in approximately 20 minutes, but the two systems are incompatible. Richard Martin, editorial director for clean technology marketing and consultant firm Navigant Research, stated: The broader conflict between the CHAdeMO and SAE Combo connectors, we see that as a hindrance to the market over the next several years that needs to be worked out.[34] In the United States, many of the EVs first marketed in the late 1990s and early 2000s such as the GM EV1, Ford Ranger EV, and Chevrolet S-10 EV preferred the use of Level 2 (single-phase AC) EVSE, as defined under NEC-1999, to maintain acceptable charging speed. These EVSEs were fitted with either an inductive connector (Magne Charge) or a conductive connector (generally AVCON). Proponents of the inductive system were GM, Nissan, and Toyota; DaimlerChrysler, Ford, and Honda backed the conductive system.[5]: 10–11 Magne Charge paddles were available in two different sizes: an older, larger paddle (used for the EV1 and S-10 EV) and a newer, smaller paddle (used for the first-generation Toyota RAV4 EV, but backwards compatible with large-paddle vehicles through an adapter).[35] The larger paddle (introduced in 1994) was required to accommodate a liquid-cooled vehicle inlet charge port; the smaller paddle (introduced in 2000) interfaced with an air-cooled inlet instead.[36][37]: 23 SAE J1773, which described the technical requirements for inductive paddle coupling, was first issued in January 1995, with another revision issued in November 1999.[37]: 26 The influential California Air Resources Board adopted the conductive connector as its standard on 28 June 2001, based on lower costs and durability,[38] and the Magne Charge paddle was discontinued by the following March.[39] Three conductive connectors existed at the time, named according to their manufacturers: Avcon (aka butt-and-pin, used by Ford, Solectria, and Honda); Yazaki (aka pin-and-sleeve, on the RAV4 EV); and ODU (used by DaimlerChrysler).[37]: 22 The Avcon butt-and-pin connector supported Level 2 and Level 3 (DC) charging and was described in the appendix of the first version (1996) of the SAE J1772 recommended practice; the 2001 version moved the connector description into the body of the practice, making it the de facto standard for the United States.[37]: 25 [40] IWC recommended the Avcon butt connector for North America,[37]: 22 based on environmental and durability testing.[41] As implemented, the Avcon connector used four contacts for Level 2 (L1, L2, Pilot, Ground) and added five more (three for serial communications, and two for DC power) for Level 3 (L1, L2, Pilot, Com1, Com2, Ground, Clean Data ground, DC+, DC−).[42] By 2009, J1772 had instead adopted the round pin-and-sleeve (Yazaki) connector as its standard implementation, and the rectangular Avcon butt connector was rendered obsolete.[43] Charging time depends on the battery's capacity, power density, and charging power.[44] The larger the capacity, the more charge the battery can hold (analogous to the size of a fuel tank). Higher power density allows the battery to accept more charge per unit time (the size of the tank opening). Higher charging power supplies more energy per unit time (analogous to a pump's flow rate). An important downside of charging at fast speeds is that it also adds stress to the mains electricity grid.[45] The California Air Resources Board specified a target minimum range of 150 miles (240 km) to qualify as a zero-emission vehicle, and further specified that the vehicle should allow for fast-charging.[46] Charge time can be calculated as:[47] Charging Time (h) = Battery capacity (kWh) Charging power (kW) {\\displaystyle {\\text{Charging Time (h)}}={\\frac {\\text{Battery capacity (kWh)}}{\\text{Charging power (kW)}}}} The effective charging power can be lower than the maximum charging power due to limitations of the battery or battery management system, charging losses (which can be as high as 25%[48]), and vary over time due to charging limits applied by a charge controller. The usable battery capacity of a first-generation electric vehicle, such as the original Nissan Leaf, was about 20 kilowatt-hours (kWh), giving it a range of about 100 mi (160 km).[citation needed] Tesla was the first company to introduce longer-range vehicles, initially releasing their Model S with battery capacities of 40 kWh, 60 kWh and 85 kWh, with the latter lasting for about 480 km (300 mi).[49] As of 2022[update] plug-in hybrid vehicles typically had an electric range of 15 to 60 miles (24–97 km).[50] Batteries are charged with DC power. To charge from the AC power supplied by the electrical grid, EVs have a small AC-to-DC converter built into the vehicle. The charging cable supplies AC power directly from the grid, and the vehicle converts this power to DC internally and charges its battery. The built-in converters on most EVs typically support charging speeds up to 6–7 kW, sufficient for overnight charging.[51] This is known as \"AC charging\". To facilitate rapid recharging of EVs, much higher power (50–100+ kW) is necessary.[citation needed] This requires a much larger AC-to-DC converter which is not practical to integrate into the vehicle. Instead, the AC-to-DC conversion is performed by the charging station, and DC power is supplied to the vehicle directly, bypassing the built-in converter. This is known as DC fast charging. Charging stations are usually accessible to multiple electric vehicles and are equipped with current or connection sensing mechanisms to disconnect the power when the EV is not charging. The two main types of safety sensors: Sensor wires react more quickly, have fewer parts to fail, and are possibly less expensive to design and implement.[citation needed] Current sensors however can use standard connectors and can allow suppliers to monitor or charge for the electricity actually consumed. Longer drives require a network of public charging stations. In addition, they are essential for vehicles that lack access to a home charging station, as is common in multi-family housing. Costs vary greatly by country, power supplier, and power source. Some services charge by the minute, while others charge by the amount of energy received (measured in kilowatt-hours). In the United States, some states have banned the use of charging by kWh.[53] Charging stations may not need much new infrastructure in developed countries, less than delivering a new fuel over a new network.[54] The stations can leverage the existing ubiquitous electrical grid.[55] Charging stations are offered by public authorities, commercial enterprises, and some major employers to address a range of barriers. Options include simple charging posts for roadside use, charging cabinets for covered parking places, and fully automated charging stations integrated with power distribution equipment.[56] As of December 2012[update], around 50,000 non-residential charging points were deployed in the U.S., Europe, Japan and China.[57] As of August 2014[update], some 3,869 CHAdeMO quick chargers were deployed, with 1,978 in Japan, 1,181 in Europe and 686 in the United States, and 24 in other countries.[58] As of December 2021 the total number of public and private EV charging stations was over 57,000 in the United States and Canada combined.[59] As of May 2023, there are over 3.9 million public EV charging points worldwide, with Europe having over 600,000, China leading with over 2.7 million.[60] United States has over 138,100 charging outlets for plug-in electric vehicles (EVs). In January 2023, S&P Global Mobility estimated that the US has about 126,500 Level 2 and 20,431 Level 3 charging stations, plus another 16,822 Tesla Superchargers and Tesla destination chargers.[61] As of December 2012[update], Japan had 1,381 public DC fast-charging stations, the largest deployment of fast chargers in the world, but only around 300 AC chargers.[57] As of December 2012[update], China had around 800 public slow charging points, and no fast charging stations.[57] As of September 2013[update], the largest public charging networks in Australia were in the capital cities of Perth and Melbourne, with around 30 stations (7 kW AC) established in both cities – smaller networks exist in other capital cities.[62] In India, public electric vehicle (EV) charging stations are commonly located street-side and at retail shopping centers, government facilities, and other parking areas. Private charging stations are typically found at residences, workplaces, and hotels. Several Indian companies are actively developing and managing EV charging infrastructure across the country: As of December 2013, Estonia was the only country that had completed the deployment of an EV charging network with nationwide coverage, with 165 fast chargers available along highways at a maximum distance of between 40–60 km (25–37 mi), and a higher density in urban areas.[68][69][70] As of November 2012, about 15,000 charging stations had been installed in Europe.[71] As of March 2013, Norway had 4,029 charging points and 127 DC fast-charging stations.[72] As part of its commitment to environmental sustainability, the Dutch government initiated a plan to establish over 200 fast (DC) charging stations across the country by 2015. The rollout will be undertaken by ABB and Dutch startup Fastned, aiming to provide at least one station every 50 km (31 mi) for the Netherlands' 16 million residents.[73] In addition to that, the E-laad foundation installed about 3000 public (slow) charge points since 2009.[74] Compared to other markets, such as China, the European electric car market has developed slowly. This, together with the lack of charging stations, has reduced the number of electric models available in Europe.[75] In 2018 and 2019 the European Investment Bank (EIB) signed several projects with companies like Allego, Greenway, BeCharge and Enel X. The EIB loans will support the deployment of the charging station infrastructure with a total of €200 million.[75] The UK government declared that it will ban the selling of new petrol and diesel vehicles by 2035 for a complete shift towards electric charging vehicles.[76] As of October 2023, there are 69,222 charging stations, including the Level 1, Level 2 and DC fast charging stations, across the United States and Canada.[77] As of October 2023, in the U.S. and Canada, there are 6,502 stations with CHAdeMO connectors, 7,480 stations with SAE CCS1 connectors, and 7,171 stations with Tesla North American Charging System (NACS) connectors, according to the U.S. Department of Energy's Alternative Fuels Data Center.[77] As of August 2018[update], 800,000 electric vehicles and 18,000 charging stations operated in the United States,[78] up from 5,678 public charging stations and 16,256 public charging points in 2013.[79][80] By July 2020, Tesla had installed 1,971 stations (17,467 plugs).[81] Colder areas in northern US states and Canada have some infrastructure for public power receptacles provided primarily for use by block heaters. Although their circuit breakers prevent large current draws for other uses, they can be used to recharge electric vehicles, albeit slowly.[82] In public lots, some such outlets are turned on only when the temperature falls below −20 °C, further limiting their value.[83] As of late 2023, a limited number of Tesla Superchargers are starting to open to non-Tesla vehicles through the use of a built in CCS adapter for existing superchargers.[84] Other charging networks are available for all electric vehicles. Networks like Electrify America, EVgo, ChargeFinder and ChargePoint are popular among consumers. Electrify America currently has 15 agreements with various automakers for their electric vehicles to use its network of chargers or provide discounted charging rates or complimentary charging, including Audi, BMW, Ford, Hyundai, Kia, Lucid Motors, Mercedes, Volkswagen, and more. Prices are generally based on local rates and other networks may accept cash or a credit card. In June 2022, United States President Biden announced a plan for a standardized nationwide network of 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations by 2030 that will be agnostic to EV brands, charging companies, or location, in the United States.[85] The US will provide US$5 billion between 2022 and 2026 to states through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program to build charging stations along major highways and corridors.[86] One such proposed corridor called Greenlane plans to establish charging infrastructure between Los Angeles, California and Las Vegas, Nevada.[87] However, by December 2023, no charging stations had been built.[88] South African based ElectroSA and automobile manufacturers including BMW, Nissan and Jaguar have so far been able to install 80 electric car chargers nationwide.[89] In April 2017 YPF, the state-owned oil company of Argentina, reported that it will install 220 fast-load stations for electric vehicles in 110 of its service stations in the national territory.[90] Electric car manufacturers, charging infrastructure providers, and regional governments have entered into agreements and ventures to promote and provide electric vehicle networks of public charging stations. The EV Plug Alliance[91] is an association of 21 European manufacturers that proposed an IEC norm and a European standard for sockets and plugs. Members (Schneider Electric, Legrand, Scame, Nexans, etc.) claimed that the system was safer because they use shutters. Prior consensus was that the IEC 62196 and IEC 61851-1 standards have already established safety by making parts non-live when touchable.[92][93][94] Over 80% of electric vehicle charging is done at home, usually in a garage.[95] In North America, Level 1 charging is connected to a standard 120 volt outlet and provides less than 5 miles (8.0 km) of range per hour of charging. To address the need for faster charging, Level 2 charging stations have become more prevalent. These stations operate at 240 volts and can significantly increase the charging speed, delivering up to more than 30 miles (48 km) of range per hour. Level 2 chargers offer a more practical solution for EV owners, especially for those who have higher daily mileage requirements. Charging stations can be installed using two main methods: hardwired connections to the main electrical panel box or through a cord and plug connected to a 240-volt receptacle. A popular choice for the latter is the NEMA 14-50 receptacle. This type of outlet provides 240 volts and, when wired to a 50-ampere circuit, can support charging at 40 amperes according to North American electrical code. This translates to a power supply of up to 9.6 kilowatts,[96] offering a faster and more efficient charging experience. A battery swapping (or switching) station allow vehicles to exchange a discharged battery pack for a charged one, eliminating the charge interval. Battery swapping is common in electric forklift applications.[97] The concept of an exchangeable battery service was proposed as early as 1896. It was first offered between 1910 and 1924, by Hartford Electric Light Company, through the GeVeCo battery service, serving electric trucks. The vehicle owner purchased the vehicle, without a battery, from General Vehicle Company (GeVeCo), part-owned by General Electric.[98] The power was purchased from Hartford Electric in the form of an exchangeable battery. Both vehicles and batteries were designed to facilitate a fast exchange. The owner paid a variable per-mile charge and a monthly service fee to cover truck maintenance and storage. These vehicles covered more than 6 million miles (9.7 million kilometres). Beginning in 1917, a similar service operated in Chicago for owners of Milburn Electric cars.[99] 91 years later, a rapid battery replacement system was implemented to service 50 electric buses at the 2008 Summer Olympics.[100] Better Place, Tesla, and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries considered battery switch approaches.[101][102] One complicating factor was that the approach requires vehicle design modifications. In 2012, Tesla started building a proprietary fast-charging Tesla Supercharger network.[1] In 2013, Tesla announced it would also support battery pack swaps.[103] A demonstration swapping station was built at Harris Ranch and operated for a short period of time. However customers vastly preferred using the Superchargers, so the swapping program was shut down.[104] The following benefits were claimed for battery swapping: The Better Place network was the first modern attempt at the battery switching model. The Renault Fluence Z.E. was the first car enabled to adopt the approach and was offered in Israel and Denmark.[110] Better Place launched its first battery-swapping station in Israel, in Kiryat Ekron, near Rehovot in March 2011. The exchange process took five minutes.[105][111] Better Place filed for bankruptcy in Israel in May 2013.[112][113] In June 2013, Tesla announced its plan to offer battery swapping. Tesla showed that a battery swap with the Model S took just over 90 seconds.[106][114] Elon Musk said the service would be offered at around US$60 to US$80 at June 2013 prices. The vehicle purchase included one battery pack. After a swap, the owner could later return and receive their battery pack fully charged. A second option would be to keep the swapped battery and receive/pay the difference in value between the original and the replacement. Pricing was not announced.[106] In 2015 the company abandoned the idea for lack of customer interest.[115] By 2022, Chinese luxury carmaker Nio had built more than 900 battery swap stations across China and Europe,[116] up from 131 in 2020.[117] Unlike filling stations, which need to be located near roads that tank trucks can enter conveniently, charging stations can theoretically be placed anywhere with access to electric power and adequate parking. Private locations include residences, workplaces, and hotels.[118] Residences are by far the most common charging location.[119] Residential charging stations typically lack user authentication and separate metering, and may require a dedicated circuit.[120] Many vehicles being charged at residences simply use a cable that plugs into a standard household electrical outlet.[121] These cables may be wall mounted.[citation needed] Public stations have been sited along highways, in shopping centers, hotels, government facilities and at workplaces. Some gas stations offer EV charging stations.[122] Some charging stations have been criticized as inaccessible, hard to find, out of order, and slow, thus slowing EV adoption.[123] Public charge stations may charge a fee or offer free service based on government or corporate promotions. Charge rates vary from residential rates for electricity to many times higher. The premium is usually for the convenience of faster charging. Vehicles can typically be charged without the owner present, allowing the owner to partake in other activities.[124] Sites include malls, freeway rest areas, transit stations, and government offices.[125][126] Typically, AC Type 1/Type 2 plugs are used. Wireless charging uses inductive charging mats that charge without a wired connection and can be embedded in parking stalls or even on roadways. Mobile charging involves another vehicle that brings the charge station to the electric vehicle; the power is supplied via a fuel generator (typically gasoline or diesel), or a large battery. An offshore electricity recharging system named Stillstrom, to be launched by Danish shipping firm Maersk Supply Service, will give ships access to renewable energy while at sea.[127] Connecting ships to electricity generated by offshore wind farms, Stillstrom is designed to cut emissions from idling ships.[127] A smart grid is a power grid that can adapt to changing conditions by limiting service or adjusting prices. Some charging stations can communicate with the grid and activate charging when conditions are optimal, such as when prices are relatively low. Some vehicles allow the operator to control recharging.[128] Vehicle-to-grid scenarios allow the vehicle battery to supply the grid during periods of peak demand. This requires communication between the grid, charging station, and vehicle. SAE International is developing related standards. These include SAE J2847/1.[129][130] ISO and IEC are developing similar standards known as ISO/IEC 15118, which also provide protocols for automatic payment. Electric vehicles (EVs) can be powered by renewable energy sources like wind, solar, hydropower, geothermal, biogas, and some low-impact hydroelectric sources. Renewable energy sources are generally less expensive, cleaner, and more sustainable than non-renewable sources like coal, natural gas, and petroleum power.[131] Charging stations are powered by whatever the power grid runs on, which might include oil, coal, and natural gas. However, many companies have been making advancements towards clean energy for their charging stations. As of November 2023, Electrify America has invested over $5 million to develop over 50 solar-powered electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in rural California, including areas like Fresno County. These resilient Level 2 (L2) stations aren't tied to the electrical grid, and they provide drivers in rural areas access to EV charging via renewable resources. Electrify America’s Solar Glow 1 project, a 75-megawatt solar power initiative in San Bernardino County, is expected to generate 225,000 megawatt-hours of clean electricity annually, enough to power over 20,000 homes.[132][133] Tesla's Superchargers and Destination Chargers are mostly powered by solar energy. Tesla's Superchargers have solar canopies with solar panels that generate energy to offset electricity use. Some Destination Chargers have solar panels mounted on canopies or nearby rooftops to generate energy. As of 2023, Tesla's global network was 100% renewable, achieved through a combination of onsite resources and annual renewable matching. The E-Move Charging Station is equipped with eight monocrystalline solar panels, which can supply 1.76 kW of solar power.[134] In 2012, Urban Green Energy introduced the world's first wind-powered electric vehicle charging station, the Sanya SkyPump. The design features a 4 kW vertical-axis wind turbine paired with a GE WattStation.[135] In 2021, Nova Innovation introduced the world's first direct from tidal power EV charge station.[136] Along a section of the Highway E20 in Sweden, which connects Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö, a plate has been placed under the asphalt that interfaces with electric cars, recharging an electromagnetic coil receiver. This allows greater vehicle autonomy and reduces the size of the battery compartment. The technology is planned to be implemented along 3,000 km of Swedish roads.[137] Sweden's first electrified stretch of road, and the world's first permanent one,[138] connects the Hallsberg and Örebro area. The work is scheduled for completion by 2025.[139] Commercial projects:",

                "content": "Tens of thousands of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations are available in the United States. These charging stations are being installed in key areas throughout the country for public charging and workplace charging as a supplement to residential charging. Most EV owners do the majority of their charging at home. Find charging stations by location or along a route. Use the Advanced Filters to search for private and planned stations, as well as charging stations to match certain search criteria. Consumers and fleets considering electric vehicles—which include all-electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs)—need access to charging stations. For most drivers, this starts with charging at home or at fleet facilities. Charging stations at workplaces and public destinations may help bolster market acceptance by offering more flexible charging opportunities at commonly visited locations. Community leaders can find out more through EV readiness planning, including case studies of ongoing successes. The EVI-X Toolbox offers resources to estimate the charging infrastructure necessary to support typical daily travel in a given state or city, charging infrastructure needs to support long-distance travel (100 miles or more) along highway corridors in a given state or county, and to determine how EV charging will impact electricity demand. The Combined Charging System (CCS), also known as the SAE J1772 combo, charge port on a vehicle can be used to accept charge with Level 1, Level 2, or DC fast charging equipment. Charging the growing number of EVs in use requires a robust network of stations for both consumers and fleets. The Alternative Fueling Station Locator allows users to search for public and private charging stations. Quarterly reports on EV charging station trends show the growth of public and private charging and assess the current state of charging infrastructure in the United States. Report new charging stations for inclusion in the Station Locator using the Submit New Station form. Suggest updates to existing charging stations by selecting “Report a change” on the station details page. Learn more about state electrification planning and funding, including information about the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. For a list of ENERGY STAR certified chargers, see the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Product Finder list. A listing of charging infrastructure manufacturers with the ability to filter by product type/features is available on the Electric Drive Transportation Association’s GoElectricDrive website. For information on available charging infrastructure models: The charging infrastructure industry has aligned with a common standard called the Open Charge Point Interface (OCPI) protocol with this hierarchy for charging stations: location, EV charging port, and connector. The Alternative Fuels Data Center and the Station Locator use the following charging infrastructure definitions: Charging equipment for EVs is classified by the rate at which the batteries are charged. Charging times vary based on how depleted the battery is (i.e., state-of-charge), how much energy it holds (i.e., capacity), the type of battery, the vehicle's internal charger capacity, and the type of charging equipment (e.g., charging level, charger power output, and electrical service specifications). The charging time can range from less than 20 minutes using DC fast chargers to 20 hours or more using Level 1 chargers, depending on these and other factors. When choosing equipment for a specific application, many factors, such as networking, payment capabilities, and operation and maintenance, should be considered. Alternating Current (AC) Level 1 equipment (often referred to simply as Level 1) provides charging through a 120 volt (V) AC plug. Most, if not all, EVs will come with a portable Level 1 cordset, so no additional charging equipment is required. On one end of the cord is a standard NEMA connector (for example, a NEMA 5-15, which is a common three-prong household plug), and on the other end is an SAE J1772 standard connector (often referred to simply as J1772, shown in the above image). The J1772 connector plugs into the car's J1772 charge port, and the NEMA connector plugs into a standard NEMA wall outlet. Level 1 charging is typically used when there is only a 120 V outlet available, such as while charging at home, but can easily provide charging for most of a driver's needs. For example, 8 hours of charging at 120 V can replenish about 40 miles of electric range for a mid-size EV. As of 2022, less than 1% of public EV charging ports in the United States were Level 1. * Assumes 1.9 kW charging power AC Level 2 equipment (often referred to simply as Level 2) offers charging through 240 V (typical in residential applications) or 208 V (typical in commercial applications) electrical service. Most homes have 240 V service available, and because Level 2 equipment can charge a typical EV battery overnight, EV owners commonly install it for home charging. Level 2 equipment is also commonly used for public and workplace charging and can operate at 40 to 80 amperes (Amp). Most residential Level 2 chargers operate at up to 30 Amps, delivering 7.2 kW of power. These units require a dedicated 40-Amp circuit to comply with the National Electric Code requirements in Article 625. As of 2022, nearly 80% of public EV charging ports in the United States were Level 2. Level 2 charging equipment uses the same J1772 connector that Level 1 equipment uses. All commercially available EVs in the United States have the ability to charge using Level 1 and Level 2 charging equipment. Vehicles with a J3400 (also referred to as NACS, or North American Charging Standard) connector (currently only Tesla vehicles) can use the connector for all charging levels, including Tesla's Level 2 Destination Chargers and chargers for home. All Tesla vehicles come with a J1772 adapter, which allows them to use non-Tesla Level 2 charging equipment. † A Level 2 unit can range from 2.9 to 19.2 kW power output. Direct-current (DC) fast charging equipment (typically a three-phase AC input) enables rapid charging along heavy traffic corridors at installed stations. As of 2022, more than 20% of public EV charging ports in the United States were DC fast chargers. The availability of DC fast charging is expected to increase as a result of federal funding to build a national EV charging network, such as the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program or national Alternative Fuel Corridors grant program. Additionally, DC fast charging is projected to increase due to fleets adopting medium- and heavy-duty EVs (e.g., commercial trucks and vans and transit), as well as the installation of fast charging hubs for transportation network companies (e.g., Uber and Lyft) and other applications. There are three types of DC fast charging systems, depending on the type of charge port on the vehicle: SAE Combined Charging System (CCS), CHAdeMO, and J3400. The CCS connector (also known as SAE J1772 combo) lets drivers use the same charge port with AC Level 1, Level 2, and DC fast charging equipment. The only difference is that the DC fast charging connector has two additional bottom pins. Most EV models on the market can charge using the CCS connector. The CHAdeMO connector is another common DC fast connector type among Japanese automakers. SAE International is standardizing the J3400 connector based on Tesla’s design for the NACS connector, which works for all charging levels, including Tesla's fast charging option, called a Supercharger. Although Tesla vehicles do not have a CCS or CHAdeMO charge port, they come with a limited CCS or CHAdeMO adapter that supports charging up to 19.2 kW. Tesla does sell full power adapters for both connector types. Several vehicle manufacturers have announced adopting the J3400 connector as early as 2025, which will allow non-Tesla EVs to charge at Tesla stations with the J3400 connector. ‡ A DC charging unit can provide up to 500 kW. Charging power varies by vehicle and battery state of charge. Increasing available public and private charging equipment requires infrastructure procurement. Learn about how to successfully plan for, procure, and install charging infrastructure. Once charging infrastructure has been procured and installed, it must be properly operated and maintained. Learn about charging infrastructure operation and maintenance considerations. Another standard (SAE J3068) was developed in 2018 for higher rates of AC charging using three-phase power, which is common at commercial and industrial locations in the United States. Some components of the standard were adapted from the European three-phase charging standards and specified for North American AC grid voltages and requirements. In the United States, the common three-phase voltages are typically 208/120 V, 480/277 V. The standard targets power levels between 6 kW and 130 kW. Extreme fast chargers (XFC), such as the SAE DC Level 2 standard, are capable of power outputs of up 350 kW and higher and are rapidly being deployed in the United States light-duty and select medium-duty applications (e.g., for in-route charging of electric buses). XFC will also support long-dwell overnight charging for medium- and heavy-duty vehicle applications. A 2022 report looks at the requirements for charging stations that could support in-route charging for heavy-duty EVs. While XFC are currently available from several charging manufacturers, the U.S. Department of Energy's Vehicle Technologies Office is pursuing research that will bridge the technology gaps associated with implementing XFC networks in the United States. A 2017 report highlights technology gaps at the battery, vehicle, and infrastructure levels. In particular, many EVs on the roads today are not capable of charging at rates higher than 150 kW. However, vehicle technology is advancing, and most new EV models will be able to charge at higher rates, enabling the use of XFC. You can find additional resources on EV charging and advanced charging system research efforts from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. For answers to frequently asked questions about the Megawatt Charging System and SAE J3271, see the fact sheet on Charging for Heavy-Duty Electric Trucks from Argonne National Laboratory. Inductive charging equipment, which uses an electromagnetic field to transfer electricity to an EV without a cord, has been introduced commercially for installation as an aftermarket add-on. Some currently available wireless charging stations operate at power levels comparable to Level 2, though this technology is more common for transit or other fleet operations at higher power levels comparable to DC fast. The U.S. Department of Energy is conducting research to investigate the feasibility of high-powered wireless charging. More information on inductive charging research efforts is available from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.",

Electric vehicles vs. gas Where to charge an electric car Different types of chargers Time to charge an electric car Cost to charge an electric car How far can an electric car go? How long do electric car batteries last? EV charging cables and charger plugs Electric car charging explained for those considering buying their first electric car. Electric mobility and the popularity of electric passenger vehicles has been growing rapidly over the last decade and this trend doesn’t show any signs of slowing down. However you measure it—EV sales, EVs on the roads, government EV legislation, or simply vehicle manufacturers making electric mobility pledges—it’s undeniable that the future is electric, and the age of internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles is coming to an end. 26 million EVs in 2022 350 million EVs in 2030 60% total EV share in 2030 As a society, electric vehicles can help us reduce carbon emissions and build a more sustainable future. But as drivers, EVs provide us far more than the ability to reduce our et footprint. For one, electric vehicles offer superior driving experience; instant torque and smooth handling (thanks to a low center of gravity). And let’s be honest, charging when you’re parked at your destination, instead of going out of your way to do so is something you can easily get used to. Next to the added convenience, it can save costs as well. Did you know charging is cheaper than filling up your gas tank? Next to this, EVs require much less maintenance than conventional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles due to fewer moving parts and no fluids. For people considering buying their first electric vehicle or those who just bought one, driving an EV—or more specifically charging one—is a completely new experience. On this page, we provide an overview of everything you need to know about EV charging and clear up the most common questions so you can feel more confident about switching to electric mobility. Whether you’re in the market for your first EV or considering upgrading, it’s only logical that you’re comparing your options. One of the major differences between owning an EV and a traditional vehicle with an internal combustion engine (ICE) is how you fill your proverbial tank. Many find switching from putting gas in a tank to charging a battery with electricity the scariest transition; what if you run out in the middle of nowhere? In reality, EV range anxiety has as much to do with psychology as it does with the range of electric cars (or the availability of charging stations). In fact, being able to charge your battery is one of the best things about driving an electric car. It may sound obvious, but with a gas vehicle, you can pretty much only fill up your tank at a gas station. With an EV, however, you can charge your car pretty much everywhere: at home, at the office, at a restaurant, whilst doing your shopping, whilst parked on the street, or you can top-up your car’s battery at a (no longer aptly named) gas station. So, the decision to get an EV and thinking about how to charge it go hand in hand. However, because it works a little differently than what we’re all familiar with, it can get quite confusing, especially because there are many new definitions you have to wrap your head around. As a relatively young, scattered, and rapidly growing industry, EV charging terminology is all over the place. There are different charging levels, cables and plugs (which differ depending on where you are), battery capacity possibilities, and estimated actual range. Charging stations can also vary depending on the type of current they use (AC or DC), their power output, and their charging speed. It doesn’t help that many EV charging terms are similar and often used interchangeably. For example, how fast is fast charging really? And what is rapid or even ultra-fast charging? Read on to learn everything you need to know about EV charging so you can start your transition toward electric mobility well-informed. Generally speaking, any location you can park your car in with access to electricity is a potential charging location. So, you can imagine the places you can charge your EV are as diverse as today’s electric car models. As the world is shifting towards electric mobility, the need for a suitable charging infrastructure network has never been more prevalent. As such, governments and cities across the globe are creating legislation and incentivizing the building of charging stations while more and more businesses are tapping into this new market. So in the future, as charging stations become more common fixtures on streets the world over, the locations you will be able to charge in will expand greatly. But what are the five most popular places to charge your car today? According to our Mobility Monitor report in partnership with Ipsos, in which we surveyed thousands of EV drivers (and potential EV drivers) across Europe, these are the five most popular places to charge an electric car: With 64 percent of EV drivers charging regularly at their house, home EV charging takes the crown for the most popular charging location. This comes as no surprise, as charging at home enables electric car drivers to wake up to a fully charged vehicle every day and ensures they pay only for the electricity they consume at their household's electricity rate. 34 percent of current EV drivers already regularly charge their car at the workplace, and many more have stated that they would love to be able to do so, and who wouldn’t? Driving to the office, focusing on your work during business hours, and driving home at the end of the day in a fully charged vehicle is undoubtedly convenient. As a result, more and more workplaces are starting to install EV charging stations as part of a sustainability initiative, employee engagement strategies, and to satisfy their EV-driving visitors and partners. Each day, more public charging stations are popping up as cities and local governments are investing heavily in charging infrastructure. Today, 31 percent of EV drivers already use them regularly, and they are likely to play a crucial role in supporting electrification for city dwellers without access to a home charging station. Charging at home or at the office sounds nice, but what if you’re on the road and looking for a quick top-up? Many fuel retailers and service stations are starting to provide fast charging (also known as level 3 or DC charging). 29 percent of current EV drivers already charge their car there regularly. While charging at the office or at home is convenient while you get on with your day, it can take hours to fully charge a battery, depending on the charging station’s power output. For times when you need a quick top-up, fast charging stations allow you to charge your battery in minutes, not hours, and be back on the road in no time. 26 percent of EV drivers regularly charge their car at supermarkets, while 22 percent prefer shopping malls or department stores—if the service is available to them. Think of the convenience: imagine watching a movie, having dinner, meeting a friend for a coffee, or even doing some grocery shopping and returning to a vehicle with more charge than you left it with. More and more retail locations are discovering the growing need for this service and are installing charging stations to meet the demand and acquire new customers. Charging can be categorized in multiple ways. The most common way to think about EV charging is in terms of charging levels. There are three levels of EV charging: Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3—and generally speaking, the higher the level, the higher the power output and the faster your new vehicle will charge. However, in practice, charging times are influenced by many things like the car's battery, charging capacity, the charging station's power output. But also the battery temperature, how full your battery is when you start charging, and whether you’re sharing a charging station with another car or not can also influence the charging speed. The maximum charging capacity at a given level is determined either by your car’s charging capacity or the charging station’s power output, whichever is lower. Level 1 charging simply refers to plugging your EV into a standard power socket. Depending on where you are in the world, a typical wall outlet only delivers a maximum of 2.3 kW, so charging via a Level 1 charger is the slowest way to charge an EV—giving only 6 to 8 kilometers of range per hour (4 to 5 miles). As there is no communication between the power outlet and the vehicle, this method is not only slow, but it can also be dangerous if handled improperly. As such, we don’t recommend relying on Level 1 charging to charge your vehicle except as a last resort. A Level 2 charger is a dedicated charging station that you may find mounted to a wall, on a pole, or standing on the ground. Level 2 charging stations deliver alternating current (AC) and have a power output between 3.4 kW - 22 kW. They are commonly found at residential, public parking, businesses, and commercial locations and make up the majority of public EV chargers. At the maximum output of 22 kW, an hour’s charging will provide roughly 120 km (75 miles) to your battery’s range. Even lower power outputs of 7.4 kW and 11 kW will charge your EV much faster than Level 1 charging, adding 40 km (25 miles) and 60 km (37 miles) of range per hour respectively. Because of this reason, and thanks to a range of smart charging options, connectivity and safety features that Level 2 AC chargers offer, many EV drivers invest in an AC charging station for their home. Also known as DC or fast charging, Level 3 charging uses direct current (DC) to charge a vehicle’s battery directly, instead of the alternating current (AC) used by Level 1 and 2 charging stations. This allows Level 3 chargers to bypass an EV’s slower AC/DC onboard converter and deliver DC power directly to the battery. As a result, Level 3 charging stations can deliver much more power faster, making them ideal for short-stop locations like gas stations and fleet depots. Charging times vary between different vehicles and power outputs, however, generally speaking, Level 3 chargers can charge a vehicle in minutes versus hours for Level 2 or days for Level 1 charging stations. So, the higher the level, the higher the charging speed. All clear so far, right? But what is AC and DC? When is something AC and when DC, and why is DC so much faster? AC stands for “Alternating Current”, and as its name implies, it changes direction periodically. DC stands for “Direct Current” and flows in a straight line. Without getting too technical, AC can be transported over long distances more efficiently, so this is why it flows out of your socket at your home and office. However, batteries are only able to store DC power, and electronics use DC to operate. You may have never realized it, but every time you charge your phone (or any other electrical device for that matter), the charger converts the AC power it receives from the grid into DC power to charge the battery in your device. The same principle goes for electric cars. The difference between AC and DC charging all depends on whether there is a conversion process or not. No matter how you charge it though, at the end of the day, the electricity stored in the car’s battery is always DC. With a DC charger, power is converted from AC to DC by the charger, allowing direct current to flow straight into the battery. With an AC charger, the electricity has to be converted to DC by the car’s built-in converter before it can be fed into the battery. This process will always take longer as the onboard charger has a much more limited capacity than the external converters used in DC charging stations. Once you’ve got your head around where to charge, what the different levels of charging are, and have a basic understanding of the difference between AC and DC, you can now better understand the answer to the number one question: “So how long will it take to charge my new EV?”. How long it takes precisely to charge an EV depends on different factors, such as your vehicle’s battery size, charging capacity, as well as a number of other situational factors. But, to give you an idea, here's a quick overview of average charging time estimates for a medium-sized EV. About 19 hours Between 1h 45 min - 6h Between 17 min - 52 min To give you a somewhat accurate approximation, we’ve added an overview of how long it takes to charge EVs below. This overview looks at three average battery sizes and a few different charging power outputs. For a more detailed overview of a specific model, have a look at our electric car specifications page. Type of EV Small EV Medium EV Large EV Average Battery Size (right) Power Output (Below) 40 kWh 65 kWh 90 kWh AC 2.3 kW 11h36m 18h50m 26h05m AC 7.4 kW 3h36m 5h51m 8h06m AC 11 kW 2h25m 3h56m 5h27m AC 22 kW 1h08m 1h45m 2h27m DC 50 kW 32 min 52 min 1h12m DC 100 kW 16 min 26 min 36 min DC 150 kW 17 min 24 min DC 240 kW 11 min 15 min DC 300 kW 8 min 11 min *Approximate time to charge the battery from 20 percent to 80 percent state of charge (SoC). For illustrative purposes only: Does not reflect exact charging times, some vehicles will not be able to handle certain power inputs and/or do not support fast charging. The bigger the battery, the longer it will take to charge. Simple, right? An EV's battery capacity is measured in kilowatt-hours (kWh), similar to a liter or a gallon but for electricity, with each kWh equal to the amount of energy you would use to run a 1,000-watt appliance for an hour. The vast majority of electric passenger vehicle batteries today can hold somewhere between 25 and 100 kWh when fully charged, with the average EV having a 69 kWh battery capacity. The maximum power an EV can accept differs from vehicle to vehicle and can even vary depending on the model of the car. Measured in kilowatts (kW), the charging capacity is shown for both AC charging and DC charging, and each is a large factor in determining how long it takes to charge. For instance, if two vehicles with similar-sized batteries are charging side by side at a high-power DC charging station, but one can only accept 50 kW of DC power and the other 250 kW, then the latter will charge much faster than the former. The different output of the charging station plays a large factor in how long it takes to charge an EV. The higher the kW output on a charging station, the faster it can charge (presuming that your vehicle can handle the higher power output). It might sound obvious, but how much charge you have in your vehicle when you begin your charging session also plays a part in how long it takes to charge. The same as when you’re putting gas in a traditional vehicle, depending on whether you have half a tank or are almost empty, how long it takes to charge will differ. With AC charging, the power flow from the charger to an EV is mostly flat, meaning that it will charge at roughly the same speed from 0-100 percent full. In contrast, with DC charging, the EV’s battery initially accepts a very high flow of power, then quickly peaks and starts to decrease the power it takes in as it begins to fill up. The reason for this pattern is twofold. You might remember from above that with AC charging, the conversion from AC to DC happens inside the vehicle by the onboard converter. This has a fairly limited power capacity, which is quickly reached and can be sustained throughout the whole charging session. DC charging, on the other hand, unlocks much greater power output, so it needs to adjust this as the session progresses to avoid damaging the battery. Because of their chemistry, EV batteries can take in much higher power at low states of charge, and this ability decreases progressively as they get closer to full. As a result, with a DC or Level 3 charger, the initial phase of charging (to 80 percent full) is much faster than the last 20 percent (which may take roughly the same amount of time as the first 80 percent). Another factor that will determine charging times is the weather. As batteries operate more efficiently in temperate weather—roughly between 20–25°C (68-77°F)—it will take longer to charge a vehicle in colder or extremely warm weather. Just like with how long it takes to charge an EV, the cost of charging depends on multiple variables including where you charge it, or the type of vehicle you drive. Before we get into it in greater detail, here are the approximate costs of charging four different size vehicles (with battery packs from small to large), at three different types of charging stations, so that you can get a ballpark idea of charging costs for your new EV. Vehicle type Battery size Home chargingcost per kWh: $0.15 Public / workplace chargingcost per kWh:$0.35 + $1 charging fee Fast chargingcost per kWh:$0.50 + $2 charging fee Fiat 500e 42 kWh $6.30 $15.70 $27.20 Volkswagen ID4 55 kWh $8.25 $20.25 $35.00 Hyundai IONIQ 5 77.4 kWh $11.61 $28.09 $48.44 Tesla Model 3 82 kWh $12.30 $29.70 $51.20 Important: Prices for each charging segment are approximations based on our experience and do not represent a real-life situation. These calculations are based on a median guesstimate charging tariff and represent the cost to charge from zero to 100 percent. The first thing you need to know when calculating how much it costs to charge your EV is the size of your battery. As shown above, the larger the battery, the more kWhs it can store; the more kWhs it can store, the more power it takes to fill the battery; the more power it takes, the more you have to pay to fill your battery. Simple, right? For instance, a Tesla Model 3 Long Range with an 82 kWh battery costs about $12.30 to fully charge at home but has a range of roughly 614 km (381 miles). However, a Fiat 500e with a much smaller 42 kWh battery, while costing a fraction of the price to charge, only has a 321 km (200 miles) range. Once you know how big your new EV’s battery is (measured in kWh), you can approximate how much it costs to charge at different charging stations. The three main options are at home, at public locations, or at fast-charging stations. Charging from home is the cheapest way to charge your new car. Because there’s no middle man standing in between you and the cost of energy, you’ll always get the cheapest rate available to consumers at home. How much it costs to charge at home is an easy equation. Simply take your latest energy bill and find the price per kWh you pay at home and multiply it by the size of your battery. On average, residential prices for electricity vary from around €/$0.10 on the low end in Europe and North America to €/$0.32 on the higher end. At the time of writing this guide, we’ve taken some averages around the world from Energybot (US), the European Union (EU), and Nimblefins (UK): That means if you’ve just bought a Tesla Model 3 with an 82 kWh battery and pay $0.15 for electricity, you’ll be set back around $12.30 to fully charge your EV. While this calculation gives an estimation of home charging costs, it doesn’t take into account the battery’s current state of charge, the state of your battery in general, weather conditions, or the type of charger, which can all impact your actual costs. Public charging stations can range from offices to curbside stations and commercial parking garages to shopping malls, restaurants, and hotels. The truth is that today, there’s no shortage of businesses big and small investing in EV charging. At the same time, cities and governments are investing in EV charging infrastructure to accelerate the shift towards sustainable mobility. When you put both together, you’ve got charging stations springing up in a range of locations. Public charging stations can be either Level 2 or Level 3 (AC or DC charging stations) stations but, for simplicity, we’ve split them into two categories and will discuss them separately as they usually come with very different costs. In both cases, public charging has a middleman providing the service (called charge point operators), so public charging stations usually have a marked-up price in comparison to home charging. How much it costs to charge depends on the base price of electricity in your location and how much the provider charges you for the service. In some cases, like workplaces and offices, the provider is also an employer and will provide EV charging as an employee benefit and may charge less, or even allow employees to charge for free. Others, like parking facilities and shopping malls, will take the price of electricity and mark it up to make a profit on it, like any other service they offer. Some, like restaurants and hotels, may use EV charging as a way to attract new customers and offer free or discounted charging to patrons. Just like the diversity in how much it costs, how these providers will calculate costs also differs greatly. Below is a list of the four most common ways to calculate charging tariffs. For example, a charging provider might charge $0.35 per kWh with a $1 service fee, meaning it would cost you $29.70 to fully charge a Tesla Model 3 with an 82 kWh battery. How much it costs in practice for you depends on the provider, your country and region. While public charging tends to be more expensive, it is often faster than charging at home, and still cheaper than gas. Level 3 or DC charging is the fastest way to charge an EV. Depending on the power output and your vehicle’s fast charging capabilities, it will likely take somewhere between 15 minutes and an hour to charge your EV up to 80 percent full. These speeds make DC charging stations perfect for quick top-ups at on-the-go locations like highway rest stops, gas stations, or supermarkets. However, DC charging stations are also the most expensive to build and run. To enable these charging times, DC charging stations have to deliver serious amounts of power to a vehicle’s battery—think between 50 and 350 kW rather than 22 kW, the maximum output for AC charging stations. As a result of these high installation and operating costs, charging service providers will often ask for a much higher price to pass on some of their expenses to the customer. In some cases, DC fast charging stations can cost double, or even triple, the kWh price of electricity—making the costs here similar to the cost of filling up your tank with fossil fuels. Typical costs can range from $0.60 per kWh with a $2 service fee to a flat rate of $0.99 per minute. This means that to fully charge the same Tesla Model 3 as above, it would be closer to $50 for a full battery. But where filling up your tank at the gas station is the only option for ICE vehicles, DC fast charging is more of a sporadic convenience on long trips than an everyday tool for your daily commute. One of the questions we hear potential EV drivers ask us all the time is, are EVs cheaper to charge than filling up a conventional fossil-fuel vehicle? As you may have guessed by now, the answer to that question is almost always yes. Regardless of charging costs for individual sessions, when you take into account that most EV drivers charge at home, occasionally topping up when shopping or at the workplace, and using fast charging for long-distance journeys, EV charging is usually a lot cheaper than filling a car with gasoline or diesel. Another question many potential EV drivers want to know before buying an EV is, “how far will I be able to drive with my new car?” Or should we say, the real question on everyone’s mind is, “Am I going to run out of charge on a long-distance journey?” This concern is understandable; charging a battery is one of the main differences with driving an ICE vehicle and a question on many people’s minds. In the early days of electric mobility, range anxiety gripped many potential EV drivers. And not without reason: Ten years ago, the best-selling EV, the Nissan LEAF, had a maximum range of only 175 km (109 miles). Today, the average range of EVs is nearly more than double that at 348 km (216 miles), and many EVs have a range of above 500 km (300 miles); plenty for even the longer daily urban commutes. This increase in range, together with the rapid development of charging infrastructure, means range anxiety is becoming increasingly unwarranted. But what about long trips? Even EVs with the furthest range may still need to stop and charge on a long journey. This is where DC fast charging stations come in – with their high power, they can quickly top up your battery while you stop to eat, stretch your legs, or take a bathroom break. And while it depends on where you live, fast charging infrastructure is growing rapidly and is already widely accessible across the US, UK, EU, and China. Most EV drivers won’t even have to charge their car daily. Did you know that in the US, the average American drives roughly 62 km (39 miles) a day and in Europe, the daily kilometers driven by car are on average, less than half of what they drive in the US? The bottom line is that most of our daily commutes won’t even come close to reaching an EV's maximum range, regardless of the make or model, and even back in 2010. For a more detailed overview of the range of any specific model, you can have a look at our electric car specifications page. An EV’s battery is by far the most expensive component of the car, so it’s only understandable that you want to know how long your new EV’s battery will last. Just like all lithium-ion batteries, EV batteries will slowly lose some of their capacity over time. However, unlike the battery in your phone or laptop, EV batteries are designed with heavy use in mind and last for years under normal use. That means that if you purchase an EV today with a 240 km (150 miles) range, after five years, the battery will have lost 27 km (17 miles) of accessible range. Most EV manufacturers will also give between 8-10 years warranty on their battery, or up to 100,000 km (62,000 miles). According to current estimates, EV batteries have a projected lifespan of about 15 to 20 years or around 100,000 to 200,000 miles on the road. This is longer than the current average life expectancy of a car, which is approximately 12 years, so EV batteries will, in most cases, outlive the vehicle they’re in. There are also a few simple habits you can adopt to maximize your EV’s battery life, such as only charging up to 80 percent for everyday driving and avoiding letting your car’s battery get close to empty. Many of the sections above have answered questions you may or may not have had before purchasing your new EV. However, we can take a guess that you probably haven’t even thought about charging cables and plugs, the world of EV cables and plugs is as diverse as it is complex. As different regions adopted EVs simultaneously, each developed its own cables and plugs, and there’s still no universal standard for charging to this day. As a result, just like Apple has one charging port and Samsung has another, many different EV manufacturers and countries use different charging technologies. To get a detailed overview of a specific model, our electric car specifications page shows the type of plug types and other specifications per car. Broadly speaking, the two main ways EV charging can differ are the cable connecting the car to the charging station or wall outlet and the type of plug used to connect the vehicle to the charging station. Charging cables come in four modes. While each is most commonly used with a specific type of charging, these modes do not necessarily always correlate to the “level” of charging. Mode 1 charging cables are used to connect light electric vehicles like e-bikes and scooters to a standard wall outlet and cannot be used to charge EVs. Their lack of communication between the vehicle and the charging point, as well as their limited power capacity, make them unsafe for EV charging. When you purchase an EV, it will typically come with what’s known as a Mode 2 charging cable. This type of cable allows you to connect your EV to a standard household outlet and use it to charge your vehicle with a maximum power output of around 2.3 kW. Mode 2 charging cables feature an In-Cable Control and Protection Device (IC-CPD) which manages the charging process and makes this cable much safer than Mode 1. A Mode 3 charging cable connects your vehicle to a dedicated EV charging station and is considered to be the most common for AC charging. Mode 3 cables can either be built into a charging station or removable – in fact, many EV manufacturers will provide a Mode 3 cable with their new cars to enable public charging. Mode 4 charging cables are used when fast charging. These cables are designed to transfer the higher power from DC (level 3) charging, must be connected to a charging station, and are often even liquid-cooled to deal with the heat. The charging plug is a connector that you insert into the charging socket of an electric car. These plugs can differ based on power output, the make of the vehicle, and the country the car was manufactured in. You’ll find that EV charging plugs can be mostly broken down by region and whether they’re used for AC or DC fast charging. For example, the EU primarily uses Type 2 connectors for AC charging, while the US uses CCS1 for DC fast charging.

                "content": "Effective November 8, 2023, CVRP is closed to new applications. Applications submitted on or after September 6, 2023, were placed on a standby list. For more information, view the standby list FAQ. If you missed out on CVRP, several EV incentives are still available. Learn the differences between the three charging station options and find the average costs for charging at home and on the go Imagine never having to stop at a gas station again – and instead, having an unlimited supply of fuel available at home or wherever you normally park. For many electric vehicle (EV) drivers, this is a reality. Battery electric vehicles never need gas, and for short trips, plug–in hybrids might use no gas. EV charging is simple, cost–effective, clean and convenient, particularly when you are plugged in at home – filling up your car, even while you’re asleep. There are three categories of electric vehicle (EV) charging: Level 1, Level 2 and DC fast charging. Levels 1 and 2 charging use a universal connector that can be plugged into any EV. DC fast charging uses three different connector systems called CHAdeMO, CCS Combo and Tesla Supercharger. Although EV drivers primarily charge at home, workplace and public chargers are increasingly available in communities nationwide. Use our EV Charging Station Map to find nearby charging stations. Level 1 is the slowest method of charging but is sufficient for drivers who charge overnight and travel 30–40 miles per day. Charging cables usually come with a vehicle and plug into a standard 120–volt AC outlet with no equipment installation required. Level 1 charging works well for charging at home, work or anywhere a standard outlet is available – and when you have sufficient time to charge. Level 1 charging uses a standard J1772 or Tesla connector that can plug into any EV, either directly, or through an adapter. Level 1 charging adds about 3.5 – 6.5 miles of driving range per hour of charging time. Level 2 charging is considerably faster, but requires installing a charging station, also known as electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE). EVSE requires a dedicated 240–volt or 208–volt electrical circuit, similar to what is required for a clothes dryer or electric range. Level 2 is found at many public and workplace charging stations, but also in many homes. It uses the same standard connector as Level 1 charging, meaning any EV can plug in at any Level 2 charger. Level 2 charging uses a standard J1772 or Tesla connector that can plug into any EV, either directly, or through an adapter. Depending on battery type, charger configuration and circuit capacity, Level 2 charging adds about 14 – 35 miles of range per hour of charging time. DC fast charging, also called quick charging or supercharging, provides the fastest available fill–up. It requires a 480–volt connection, making DC fast charging unsuitable for home use, and not every EV model is equipped for it. Stations offering DC fast charging are found in shopping centers and often along major travel corridors, allowing EV drivers to charge up quickly and take longer trips. DC fast charging uses CHAdeMO, CCS or Tesla connector systems. Check with your vehicle manufacturer to determine if your car has fast charging capability and what connector systems are compatible with your EV. Depending on battery type, charger configuration and circuit capacity, DC fast charging can add up to 100 miles of range in about 30 minutes of charging time. Home Charging CostsThe cost to charge your electric vehicle depends on your vehicle’s battery size and the price of electricity where you live. Most utilities offer time–of–use (TOU) rates that greatly reduce costs associated with charging a vehicle at home by charging during off–peak hours. Contact your utility to find out more.1 While electricity costs vary greatly, the average cost of electricity in California is about 16.58¢ per kilowatt hour (kWh).2 At this price point, charging a 40–kWh battery with a 150–mile range would cost about 4.42¢ per mile (or about $6.63 to fully charge). Meanwhile, fueling a 25–mpg gas vehicle at California’s average gas price of $3.11 per gallon3 would cost about 12.44¢ per mile (or about $18.66 for enough gas to drive approximately 150 miles). Home charging costs can be offset by hosting your charger on a home charging sharing network. EV drivers can earn money by sharing their home chargers or connect with other hosts to find convenient charging on the go. For more information about how you can earn money by sharing your home charger, please see these popular sharing networks: Public Charging CostsWhile charging at home is generally preferred, many people also charge their EV at public charging stations. These stations can be free, pay–as–you–go or subscription-based, and prices are set by networks or property owners. Some vehicle manufacturers, such as Hyundai, Nissan and Tesla also provide complimentary public charging. One popular public charging network charges members $1.50 per hour to charge on Level 2, and 26¢ per minute for DC fast charging in California.4 At these rates, charging a 40–kWh battery with a 150–mile range would cost about 8¢ per mile on Level 2, and 9¢ per mile for DC fast charging.

Some of the rebates also help to offset the cost of installing the charging station at your home if additional electrical work is required. Find available rebates where you live. Rebates for Commercial EV Charging StationsProperty owners can take advantage of rebates for installing commercial charging stations for public use. EV charging is a desired amenity for many California drivers and can attract more traffic to your business, improve tenant or employee satisfaction and generate a new revenue stream (fees for charging). Following are incentives that decrease the cost of charger purchases and installation. Visit the websites for more information on program eligibility requirements and funding availability.

                "title": "Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball - Wikipedia",
                "content": "The Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball program is the men's college basketball team of the University of Kentucky. It has eight NCAA championships, the best all-time winning percentage, and the most all-time victories.[2] The Wildcats compete in the Southeastern Conference and are coached by Mark Pope.[3] Adolph Rupp first brought Kentucky to national prominence, winning four NCAA titles. Since then, Joe B. Hall, Rick Pitino, Tubby Smith, and John Calipari each won a national championship, making Kentucky the only school with five coaches to win NCAA championships and placing it second only to UCLA for most titles. Kentucky has finished as the NCAA runner-up four times, making it tied with UCLA and North Carolina for all-time title game appearances at 12. The program has played in 17 NCAA Final Fours, tying Duke for third-all time behind North Carolina and UCLA. Kentucky leads all schools in several NCAA tournament stats: Elite Eight appearances at 38, Sweet Sixteen appearances at 45, total NCAA tournament appearances at 60, and tournament games played at 184. The program is behind only North Carolina with 131 NCAA tournament wins, North Carolina has 132. Kentucky has also won the National Invitation Tournament twice, making it the only school to win multiple NCAA and NIT championships, and it leads all schools in total postseason appearances at 68. Additionally, the Helms Athletic Foundation declared Kentucky the 1933 and 1954 national champions, the latter being Kentucky's only undefeated team in the modern era (post-1930). The 1948 NCAA champion team, coached by Rupp, represented the United States in the Olympics and won a gold medal. Kentucky was the first program to 1000 wins in 1968 and the first to 2000 wins in 2009. The program leads all schools with sixty-three 20-win seasons, sixteen 30-win seasons, and six 35-win seasons. Additionally, Kentucky is second among all teams in conference regular season championships with 53. Throughout its history, the Kentucky basketball program has featured many notable and successful players, both on the collegiate level and the professional level. Five players have been named national player of the year, with Anthony Davis in 2012 and Oscar Tshiebwe in 2022 being consensus selections. Three players have been named national freshman of the year: John Wall in 2010, Davis in 2012, and Reed Sheppard in 2024. Thirty-nine players have been selected as All-Americans a total of 51 times. Kentucky holds the record for the most overall NBA Draft selections (128) and three Wildcats have been selected as the first overall pick (Wall, Davis, and Karl-Anthony Towns). Thirty-nine players have been honored with jersey retirements, as well as Rupp, Hall, Pitino, Smith, equipment manager Bill Keightly, and broadcaster Cawood Ledford. Seven players have been enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Hall of Fame, as well as Rupp, Pitino, Calipari, Eddie Sutton, and Ledford. During Kentucky's earliest seasons the program went through multiple coaches, with the majority staying only one or two seasons. Records indicate that the first head coach of the Wildcats was W. W. H. Mustaine, who in 1903 called together some students, took up a collection totaling $3 for a ball, and told the students to start playing.[4] The first recorded intercollegiate game at the college was a 15–6 defeat to nearby Georgetown College. The team went 1–2 for their first \"season\", also losing to Kentucky University (later Transylvania University) but defeating the Lexington YMCA.[5] Through 1908, the team did not manage a winning season, and had an all-time record of 15–29. In the fall of that year a full-time head coach was hired, Edwin Sweetland. This made him the first paid coach in Kentucky's basketball history.[6] That year, the team went 5–4, and only three years later, boasted their first undefeated season with nine victories and no losses.[7] The 1914 team under Alpha Brummage, led by brothers Karl and Tom Zerfoss, went 12–2 and defeated all its Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association opponents. In 1919, George Buchheit became the new head coach of the Wildcats. An alumnus of the University of Illinois, he brought with him a new system of basketball. The \"Buchheit system\" or \"Illinois system\", focused on defense and featured one player standing under each basket, while three roamed the court. Bucheit varied the system he learned in Illinois in one important way. While the Illinois system employed a zone defense, Buchheit's system used an aggressive man-to-man scheme. On offense, he used a complicated system of passing called the \"zig-zag\" or \"figure eight\" offense.[8] Although the team had a losing season in Buchheit's first year, they won the first-ever Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association tournament the next year, defeating the heavily favored Georgia Bulldogs. Both of these teams were composed entirely of native Kentuckians, anchored by All-American Basil Hayden. The tournament victory was considered Kentucky's first major success, and the 1921 team became known as the \"Wonder Team.\"[9] In 1922, the team was unable to build on the success of the \"Wonder Team.\" Although every player was eligible in 1922, two key players, Hayden and Sam Ridgeway, were injured before the start of the season. Hayden returned from his knee injury during the season, but was never able to play at the level he had the previous year. Ridgeway fought a year-long battle with diphtheria, and although he recovered, never played for the Wildcats again. The remaining three members of the \"Wonder Team\" went 9–5 for the season, and bowed out of the SIAA tournament in the second round.[10] Buchheit remained as coach through the 1924 season before moving on to coach Trinity College (later Duke University). A different coach would guide the team for each of the next four years. C.O. Applegran immediately followed Buchheit, and his 1925 team posted a respectable 13–8 record. Applegran in college had played for the University of Illinois, where he became an All-American. The next year, Ray Eklund led the team to a 15–3 record, and produced UK's second All-American, Burgess Carey.[11] The record was enough for Kentucky to win their first regular season conference championship in the Southern Conference. Seeing the cupboard largely bare for the upcoming year, Eklund resigned shortly before the start of the 1927 season. The team scrambled to find a new coach, and former player Basil Hayden left his coaching job at Kentucky Wesleyan College to answer the call. An inexperienced coach and a roster largely depleted of talent left the Wildcats with a 3–13 record that year. The disappointment convinced Hayden that he wasn't the \"coaching type\", and he resigned after the season. Fortunately for the Wildcats, 1927 would be their last losing season for six decades.[12] The Wildcats' new coach for the 1927–28 season was John Mauer. Although he had a talented group of players moving up from the junior varsity team, Mauer quickly discovered that his players did not know the fundamentals of the game. He began a regimen of three-hour practices five days a week during the preseason. The practice began with half an hour of shooting drills and usually ended with a full-court scrimmage. Between the two, Mauer worked on skill drills and scenarios. Mauer's teams were nicknamed the \"Mauermen.\"[13] Teamwork was the hallmark of Mauer's system. Every player worked on every aspect of the game; there were no specialists. Like Buchheit, Mauer employed a strong man-to-man defense. He utilized a slow-break offense that relied on a complicated system of short passes to get a good shot. Two elements of Mauer's system were new to basketball in the south – the offensive screen and the bounce pass. The latter was so new to most of UK's opponents that it was referred to as the \"submarine attack.\"[14] Over his three-year tenure, Mauer led the Wildcats to an overall record of 40–14. One major prize eluded him, however. Despite having teams that were almost universally acknowledged as the \"class of the South\", Mauer never led a team to the Southern Conference title. Despite his innate ability for coaching, Mauer lacked the ability to heighten his team's emotions for a big game, a fault that was cited as the reason for his lack of tournament success. Mauer left the Wildcats to coach the Miami University Redskins following the 1930 season.[15] In 1930, the university hired Adolph Rupp, who had played as a reserve for the University of Kansas 1922 and 1923 Helms National Championship teams,[16] under coach Forest C. \"Phog\" Allen. At the time of his hiring, Rupp was a high school coach in Freeport, Illinois.[4] Rupp coached the University of Kentucky men's basketball team from 1930 to 1972. There, he gained the nicknames, \"Baron of the Bluegrass\", and \"The Man in the Brown Suit\". Rupp, who was an early innovator of the fast break and set offense, gained a reputation as an intense competitor, a strict motivator, and strategist. Rupp's Wildcat teams won 4 NCAA championships (1948, 1949, 1951, 1958), one NIT title in 1946, appeared in 20 NCAA tournaments, had 6 NCAA Final Four appearances, captured 27 Southeastern Conference (SEC) regular season titles, and won 13 SEC tournaments. Rupp's Kentucky teams also finished ranked No. 1 on 6 occasions in the final Associated Press college basketball poll and 4 times in the United Press International (Coaches) poll. In addition, Rupp's 1966 Kentucky squad (nicknamed \"Rupp's Runts\", as no starting player on the squad was taller than 6'5\") finished runner-up in the NCAA tournament, and his 1947 Wildcats finished runner-up in the NIT. Rupp's 1933 and 1954 Kentucky squads were also awarded the Helms National Championship, and his 1934 and 1947 teams were retroactively recognized as the national champion by the Premo-Porretta Power Poll.[17][18][19][20] Rupp gave the '44 team the nickname \"the Beardless Wonders\" and \"Wildkittens\" because according to Rupp, \"It was like running a Kindergarten\".[citation needed] Of the young players, Kentucky's best player was freshman Chad Anderson who, at the age of 17, was named consensus All-American, making him the youngest player to ever earn the title. The Beardless Wonders won 19 of their 21 games, enough to be invited into the NIT. There they were matched up with a Utah team nicknamed the \"Blitz Kids\".[citation needed] Both teams went into the half tied at 24, but with the help of Brannum Kentucky pulled away to win 46–38. Kentucky lost the next game to home town Saint John's.[citation needed] On the way to its first NCAA title, Kentucky went on to a record of 36–3. Of these three losses, all were either away or at neutral sites, keeping Kentucky undefeated at home throughout the entire season. Kentucky started off the beginning of the season with a 7–0 record heading into their away game at Temple. However, Temple was able to give the Cats their first loss by one point, 60–59. But the Wildcats rolled off an 11-win streak before playing at Notre Dame, where they lost 55–64. They did not lose a game for the rest of the regular season. Kentucky continued through the NCAA tournament to the finals, where they faced the Baylor Bears. Kentucky won its first NCAA title in a decisive 58–42 victory. The season did not end after the NCAA tournament, as Kentucky who would play in the Olympic Trials, where they went 2–1, only losing to the Phillips Oilers once. This was performance enough to represent the United States in the 1948 Olympic Games. Despite only being a college team, the starting 5 of Kentucky defeated all of its competition in London, making Kentucky the only team to win both an NCAA title and an Olympic gold medal.[citation needed] Adolph Rupp soon gave this team the nickname \"The Fabulous Five\", in honor of their accomplishments.[citation needed][21] For the 1949 season Kentucky had high expectations with most of the Fabulous Five returning. Big Blue Nation's expectations were met as the 1949 team won one more game than the previous year including both a SEC regular season and SEC tournament championship, while also getting back to the Final Four that March. In the finals Kentucky faced the Oklahoma A&M Cowboys, a team that had previously seen success in the tournament with back-to-back championships in 1945 and 1946. The Fab Five would succeed again winning 46–36 and Kentucky's only back-to-back NCAA championship. Kentucky was the second program in NCAA history to win back-to-back championships (there have been six other schools since). With a returning star player like Bill Spivey, Kentucky hoped to carry their success into the new decade. The Wildcats lost their first game by 11 to Saint John's at home, but they would pull it together for the Sugar Bowl Tournament, which they won, beating NCAA runner-up Bradley. After losing to Tennessee, Kentucky struggled to chain two wins together, losing every other game. They defeated their next 14 opponents, including getting revenge in SEC tournament championship over Tennessee. Heading into the post-season, No. 3 Kentucky played CCNY in the NIT, missing the NCAA tournament. The Wildcats were no match and were thrashed by the CCNY Beavers, 50–83. Over the season Kentucky defeated four top 10 teams, and were ranked in the top 5 the entire season. Vanderbilt, however, knocked off the top ranked Wildcats in the SEC tournament finals denying them an eighth straight SEC tournament title. Kentucky then defeated fourth ranked Kansas State 68–58 in the NCAA finals, . Adolph Rupp was the head coach at Kentucky during the year of the point-shaving scandal of 1951. In 1945 former Kentucky football player Nick Englisis met Kentucky player Ralph Beard while the two played football at Kentucky. Englisis entered the gambling business when he left the football team in 1946, then approached three Kentucky basketball players Ralph Beard, Alex Groza, and Dale Barnstable with his associates in late 1948 about potentially point shaving (fixing the score of games) during the upcoming season in exchange for money. The three players agreed to point shave and successfully shaved points in several games during the 1948–1949 season until an effort to point shave caused the Wildcats to lose to the Loyola Ramblers in the National Invitation Tournament. Groza, Beard, and Barnstable attempted to win the game under the point spread but kept the score too close, allowing the Ramblers to win the game with an impressive performance at the end of the second half. Kentucky faced Villanova in their first game of the NCAA tournament following the loss to Loyola and the three players attempted to win over the point spread. When Groza, Beard, and Barnstable failed to win over the point spread, it caused Englisis to lose all of his money and ended the point shaving deals between Englisis and these three players.[22] On October 20, 1951, Alex Groza, Ralph Beard, and Dale Barnstable were arrested for taking bribes from gamblers to shave points during several games including the National Invitation Tournament game against the Loyola Ramblers in the 1948–49 season.[23][24] At the conclusion of this scandal, a subsequent NCAA investigation found that Kentucky had committed several rule violations, including giving illegal spending money to players on several occasions, and also allowing some ineligible athletes to compete.[24] As a result, the Southeastern Conference voted to ban Kentucky from competing for a year and the NCAA requested all other basketball-playing members not to schedule Kentucky, with eventually none doing so.[25] As a result of these actions, Kentucky was forced to cancel the entire 1952–53 basketball season. Years later, Walter Byers, the first executive director of the NCAA, unofficially referred to this punishment as the first de facto NCAA death penalty, despite the current rule first coming into effect in 1985, thus the NCAA having no such enforcement power previous to that.[26][27] Echoing Mr. Byers' view, the NCAA's official stance is very much the same, and they now state in hindsight, \"In effect, it was the Association's first death penalty, though its enforcement was binding only through constitutional language that required members to compete against only those schools that were compliant with NCAA rules. Despite fears that it would resist, Kentucky accepts the penalty and, in turn, gives the NCAA credibility to enforce its rules.\" [28] The team posted a perfect 25–0 record in the next year (Rupp's only undefeated season), for which it was awarded the 1954 Helms National Championship. In addition, Kentucky also finished ranked No. 1 in the final Associated Press poll. On the team were three players who had graduated at the conclusion of the previous academic year. When, at the last minute, the NCAA ruled these players ineligible from post-season play, Rupp decided to skip the 1954 NCAA Tournament in protest.[citation needed] The \"Fiddlin' Five\" team earned their name though playing around and mistakes, which Rupp described as fiddling. The Fiddlin' Five still has the most losses out of any Kentucky's championships, with six, three of those were in four games.[citation needed] Unlike the Fab Five or the 1951 teams, the Fiddling Five would yoyo in the rankings with their lowest a No. 13 coming after 56–57 loss to unranked Loyola Chicago. Kentucky improved through the tournament though, and won their fourth title over No. 18 Seattle in the confines of Louisville's Freedom Hall. Rupp's last Final Four team and one of his last chances at a 5th NCAA title occurred in the 1965–66 season, with Kentucky going all the way to the NCAA title game. The 1966 NCAA championship game against Texas Western (now University of Texas-El Paso or UTEP) marked the first occurrence that an all-white starting five (Kentucky) played an all-black starting five (Texas Western) in the NCAA championship game.[citation needed] Texas Western won the game 72–65, on the night of March 19, 1966. Kentucky entered the tournament with only one loss and ranked No. 1, Texas Western also had only one loss and entered the tournament ranked second. Kentucky was a 6.5 point favorite in the game[29] The game was depicted in the film Glory Road.[citation needed] This game, and the result of it, were especially significant as the game came at a time when the civil rights movement was coming into full swing around the country. In 1969, after actively recruiting black players for over six years (his first formal scholarship offer was to Wes Unseld in 1964), despite most of the other SEC teams threatening to boycott if a black player took the court), Rupp finally signed his first black player, Tom Payne, an athletic 7'-1\" center out of Louisville. This ended the aspect of all-white Kentucky teams forever, and marked a new era with many notable black Kentucky basketball legends, including Jack Givens, Sam Bowie, Kenny Walker, Jamal Mashburn, Tayshaun Prince, Rajon Rondo, John Wall, Anthony Davis, and Karl Anthony Towns.[30] The late Rupp years looked promising with Dan Issel's commitment to the Wildcats in 1966. Over the next four years Issel scored an average of 25.7 per game, adding up to 2,137 points in his college career. This made Issel the player with the most points to ever play at Kentucky, a feat that has not been matched to this day. This included his 53 points scored against Mississippi State in 1970, the most by a Kentucky player in a single game until Jodie Meeks made 54 against rival Tennessee on January 13, 2009. Issel did not capture the national championship in his college years, but would go on to make a name for himself in the ABA.[citation needed] After 1966 Rupp saw continued success, but the Final Four eluded him. The Wildcats ended with a 13–13 season and missed the tournament altogether in 1967, then reach the Elite Eight and Sweet Sixteen in the next two years. Ranked #1 in the nation with a 26–1 record overall, Kentucky nearly missed a Final Four berth in a 106–100 shootout against Jacksonville. [citation needed] Rupp was forced into retirement in March 1972, after reaching age 70. At the time, this was the mandatory retirement age for all University of Kentucky employees. He was a 5-time National Coach-of-the-Year award winner, a 7-time Conference Coach-of-the-Year award winner, and was elected a member of both the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame and College Basketball Hall of Fame. Further, since 1972, the Adolph Rupp Trophy, considered one of the nation's premier basketball awards, has been given by Commonwealth Athletic Club to the nation's top men's college basketball player. In addition, the University of Kentucky retired a jersey in his honor in the rafters of Rupp Arena, a 23,500-seat arena named after him, dedicated in 1976.[17][18] Joe B. Hall was the head basketball coach at Kentucky from 1972 to 1985. Although he had been an assistant at Kentucky since 1965, Coach Hall was given a difficult task: to follow in the footsteps of his predecessor, Adolph Rupp. In the 1978 NCAA tournament, he coached the Wildcats to their fifth NCAA championship. He was named National Coach of the Year in 1978 and SEC Coach of the Year on four occasions. His record at UK was 297–100, and 373–156 over his career. Coach Hall won the title once in 1978, as well as making the final four in 1975 and 1984, and the elite eight in 1972, 1973, 1977, 1983.[citation needed] Coach Hall is one of only three men to both play on an NCAA championship team (1949– Kentucky) and coach an NCAA championship team (1978– Kentucky), and the only one to do so for the same school.[citation needed] The only others to achieve this feat are: After a year of playing in the freshman league and a disappointing sophomore season, Hall's Super Kittens returned with hopes of finally bringing Kentucky its fifth title. They nearly did just that, guiding Kentucky to a runner-up finish to UCLA in the 1975 NCAA tournament but not before avenging their 20-point defeat to an undefeated Indiana team. Despite losing in the championship game, it would give freshman Jack Givens a taste for success that would help propel Kentucky to the title three years later. It had been 20 years without a championship in Lexington, and along with pressure of following a hall of fame coach, Hall would nickname the 1978 season the \"Season Without Celebration.\" The pressure to win was immense on both players and coach to bring home the title, especially with a senior laden team that had gone to the finals as freshmen. Kentucky would hardly lose its composure all season or break under pressure, winning 30 of 32 games and defeating eight ranked teams along the way. By the time Kentucky reached the tournament finals they seemed bound to win the title, though Duke would give Kentucky their all. With the help of senior Jack \"Goose\" Givens' 41 points, Kentucky defeated the Blue Devils 94–88, and finally won their fifth title and first in 20 years. In 1985, Eddie Sutton succeeded Joe B. Hall. He coached the Wildcats for four years, leading them to the Elite Eight of the 1986 NCAA tournament. Two seasons later, Sutton and the 25–5 Wildcats captured their 37th SEC title and were ranked as the 6th college basketball team in the nation by the Associated Press and UPI[31][32] before losing to Villanova in the Tournament. Kentucky entered the 1988–89 season with a gutted roster. Ed Davender, Robert Lock and Winston Bennett had all graduated from school, while All-SEC sophomore Rex Chapman left school early to enter the 1988 NBA draft. Additionally, sophomore standout Eric Manuel was suspected of cheating on his college entrance exam and voluntarily agreed to sit out until the investigation was finished. Potential franchise recruit Shawn Kemp transferred out of Kentucky after signing with the school early that year.[33] Unfortunately, Manuel was forced to sit out the entire season as the investigation dragged on, essentially leaving the Wildcats in the hands of inexperienced sophomore LeRon Ellis and true freshman Chris Mills. The two underclassmen struggled to fill the talent vacuum on the court and the Wildcats finished with a losing record of 13–19, the team's first losing full-season record since 1927.[32] To add insult to injury, the NCAA announced at the end of the season that its investigation into the basketball program had found the school guilty of violating numerous NCAA policies.[34] The scandal broke when Emery Worldwide employees claimed to have discovered $1,000 in cash in an envelope Kentucky assistant coach Dwane Casey sent to Mills' father.[35] Later Emery settled a libel lawsuit filed by Casey for a substantial amount of money. Casey was not in Lexington when the envelope was supposedly mailed and the father of Mills said they received no money. The NCAA rescinded its show cause order immediately after the settlement of the lawsuit, and Casey's career has flourished as an NBA coach.[36] Another player, Eric Manuel, was alleged to have received improper assistance on his college entrance exams and was banned from NCAA competition. Whether Manuel was directly involved has been questioned.[37] Kentucky was already on probation stemming from allegations of an extensive scheme of payments to recruits, and the NCAA seriously considered hitting the Wildcats with the \"death penalty\", which would have shut down the entire basketball program (as opposed to simply being banned from postseason play) for up to two years. However, school president David Roselle forced Sutton and athletic director Cliff Hagan to resign. The Wildcats were slapped with three years' probation, a two-year ban from postseason play, the vacating of their two NCAA tournament wins in the 1988 season, and a ban from live television in 1989–90.[38][39] In 1989, Rick Pitino left the NBA's New York Knicks and became the coach at a Kentucky program reeling from the aforementioned scandal. Kentucky would be banned from the 1990 and 1991 post season, with the 1990 season suffering a 14–14 record. Kentucky would improve in 1991 with a beavy of home-grown upperclassmen such as Sean Woods, John Pelphrey, Richie Farmer, Deron Feldhaus, and Reggie Hanson along with the talented freshman Jamal Mashburn. Despite their record of 22–6, Kentucky was still banned from the post season and would have to wait another year to see the Unforgettables succeed in the tournament. Beginning with the 1992 season, Kentucky was free of post season bans. Though they lost one more game than last season, this team was most memorable for going to the Elite Eight (for the first time since Sutton's 1986 team) with many returning upperclassmen from Kentucky. The team is also known for playing in what could be considered one of the greatest games in NCAA tournament history against Duke. In this game defending champion Duke were looking to return to the Final Four once again, Kentucky for the first time in almost a decade. The game was hard-fought and physical on both sides all game including Laettner's infamous stomp on Aminu Timberlake, which resulted in a technical. The teams took the lead back and forth until the final minute of the game which resulted in a first buzzer beater shot by Kentucky's Sean Woods to take the lead 103–102, and then Laettner's shot to win the game for the Blue Devils in the final seconds 104–103. This team came to be known as the \"Unforgettables\" for helping put Kentucky back on the path to success in the 1990s and because the team was made up of home grown Kentucky kids. Kentucky returned a junior Mashburn, along with Travis Ford and Tony Delk. They were expected to reach the Final Four for the first time since Joe B. Hall's 1984 team. The expectations were right, as Kentucky would head into the post-season with only 2 losses and a No. 5 ranking. After winning the SEC Tournament once again, Kentucky stormed to the NCAA Final Four to meet up with Michigan's \"Fab Five\" a team of young and highly talented recruits that brought Michigan to the championship game the year before. As talented as Kentucky was they would fail to reach the championship game with a 78–81 overtime loss to the Wolverines. But this would be the just a glimpse of a run Kentucky would have later in the decade. Kentucky started the next season ranked #1 but would underachieve, falling short of the Elite Eight for the only time under Pitino. The highlight of the season was the \"Mardi Gras Miracle\", a game where Kentucky trailed LSU 68–37 with 15:34 left, but outscored them 62–27 over the remainder of regulation to win 99–95.[40] Starting in 1996, Kentucky would put together a string of Final Fours with help from 9 future NBA players. The \"Untouchables\" as they were nicknamed, would only lose twice, to Final Four bound UMass Minutemen (coached by future Kentucky coach John Calipari) and Mississippi State. It was with their overwhelming talent and chemistry that would win Kentucky their sixth national title in the 1996 NCAA tournament, Kentucky's first NCAA championship in 18 years. The following year, Pitino's Kentucky team made it back to the national title game, losing to Arizona in overtime in the finals of the 1997 NCAA tournament. Pitino's fast-paced teams at Kentucky were favorites of the school's fans. It was primarily at Kentucky where he implemented his signature style of full-court pressure defense. By the end of the Pitino era, Kentucky went from banned from the post season to going to three of the last five Final Fours and five of the last six Elite Eights. For this the 1997 team was dubbed the \"Unbelievables\" for taking a team that was not expected much of to return the Wildcats back to the championship game for a second time. Pitino left Kentucky in 1997 to coach the NBA's Boston Celtics, he then went on to coach Kentucky's in-state rival, the University of Louisville. Orlando \"Tubby\" Smith was introduced by UK Athletic Director C.M. Newton as the Wildcats' 20th head coach on May 12, 1997, charged with the unenviable task of replacing popular coach Rick Pitino. The Wildcats were at the top of the basketball world at the time, having won a national title in 1996 and, according to many, missing a second straight title in 1997 by the torn ACL of shooting guard Derek Anderson.[41] (Anderson tore his ACL in January against SEC foe Auburn; Kentucky lost the 1997 title game in overtime to the Arizona Wildcats.) The team Smith inherited sported seven players from the Arizona loss, and five from the 1996 championship team. However, since most of the players who had left after the 1996 and 1997 seasons were high NBA draft picks, his team had the lowest pre-season ranking since Kentucky came off probation in 1991.[42] In his first season at UK, he coached the Wildcats to their seventh NCAA championship, including a come-from-behind victory against Duke in the Elite Eight, and another comeback win against Stanford, then Utah in the Finals. His 1998 National Championship is unique in modern times, as being along with 1985 Villanova the 2nd team in over 20 years to win without a First Team All American or future NBA Lottery Pick (see 1998 NCAA tournament). The 1998 team was also unlike Kentucky's past two championship teams, often falling behind in games before roaring back to win rather than dominating their competition. Smith's teams, known primarily for a ball line defense-oriented slower style of play coined \"Tubbyball\", received mixed reviews among Kentucky fans who have historically enjoyed a faster, higher-scoring style of play under previous coaches. Smith was also under pressure from Kentucky fans to recruit better players. After leading Kentucky to one National Championship in 1998, Kentucky would complete a perfect 16–0 regular season conference record in 2003, win five SEC regular season championships (1998, 2000, 2001, 2003, 2005) and five SEC Tournament titles (1998, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2004). Smith led the Wildcats to six Sweet Sixteen appearances (1998, 1999, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2005) and four Elite Eight appearances (1998, 1999, 2003, 2005) in his ten seasons. He totaled 100 wins quicker than any other Wildcat coach before him except Hall of Famer Adolph Rupp, reaching the plateau in 130 games (John Calipari subsequently broke this record in 114 games). In 2003, he was named AP College Coach of the Year. In 1998, the reserve guard J.P. Blevins scored 9 points, all on 3-pointers sparking the Wildcats to come back from a 15-point deficit in the first half to upset the number 5 seed, Michigan State 60–58. Averaging only 2.2 points a game all season, Blevins was the unlikely hero for the Wildcats who were 6–4, to give the Spartans who were 8-3 an unlikely upset. Especially since they fell behind 26–11 in the first half.[43] Although Smith compiled an impressive resume during his UK career, he came under considerable pressure from many UK fans, who believed that his failure to achieve even a single Final Four appearance in his last nine seasons was inadequate by UK standards. He was infamously dubbed \"Ten Loss Tubby\" by several disgruntled UK fans. Smith's Final Four drought is the longest of any coach in UK history,[44] although Smith did come just a double-overtime loss short of another Final Four appearance in 2005. On March 22, 2007, Smith resigned his position of UK Head Coach to accept the head coach position at the University of Minnesota.[45] On April 6, 2007, Billy Gillispie was formally announced as the new head coach of the University of Kentucky by UK athletic director Mitch Barnhart. He fielded questions from the media during the press conference held at UK's new practice facility, the Joe Craft Center. He expressed his excitement and joy to be not only considered for the position but to have been given the honor and the opportunity to coach what former UK coach Rick Pitino referred to as the \"Roman Empire\" of college basketball. \"I'm very, very grateful and honored to be here, but we have a lot of work to do.\"[46] Gillispie became only the sixth head coach in the last 76 years at the school.[47] Gillispie's second season again started out rocky in 2008 as the 'Cats fell to Virginia Military Institute in their season opener. The second game of the season saw the Wildcats fall to North Carolina by 19 points. UK rebounded to win 11 of their next 12 games, improving their record to 11–3. On January 4, the Wildcats lost a heart breaker to archrival Louisville 74–71 after a 25 ft. shot by Edgar Sosa with 2.3 seconds remaining in the game. Prior to the shot, UK was down 7 with 38.5 seconds left, and Jodie Meeks was fouled shooting a three, proceeded to make all three free throw shots, Patrick Patterson stole an inbound and passed it to Meeks who laid it in to bring the game to 71–69 with 29.6 left, and then an inbound pass went long and Meeks snatched the pass, drove to the hoop and was fouled, and then made both free throws to tie the game at 71 with 22.9 left. So all in all, UK and Meeks got seven points in about 15 seconds to tie the game.[48] Kentucky disposed of Vanderbilt to win their SEC opener on January 10, 70–60. On January 13, in a road game against Tennessee, Jodie Meeks set a new Kentucky scoring record by dropping 54 points on the Volunteers. This total bested Dan Issel's 39-year-old scoring record by 1 point, and propelled UK to a 90–72 win and 2–0 start in conference play.[49] Kentucky followed up this effort with a 68–45 victory at Georgia, improving to 14–4 on the season. With wins over Auburn and Alabama, Kentucky moved to 5–0 in the SEC. On January 26, UK was ranked in the AP Poll (24th) for the first time since week 1 of the 2007–08 season.[50] UK promptly dropped 3 in a row (to Ole Miss, South Carolina, and Mississippi State) before rebounding at home with a thrilling 68–65 win over Florida. Jodie Meeks scored 23 points in the contest, including the fade-away contested 3-point basket with less than 5 seconds remaining to seal the win for UK. On Valentine's Day Kentucky handily defeated Arkansas at Bud Walton Arena 79–63 behind another strong performance from Meeks. Meeks contributed 45 points and helped UK win despite the absence of Patrick Patterson (sprained ankle). With the win, UK remained tied with South Carolina and Tennessee for 1st in the SEC East at 7–3.[51] Following the win UK completely collapsed, losing 5 of its last 6 games to finish the regular season 19–12 with an 8–8 SEC record. Entering the SEC tournament many felt UK would need to win the championship game to get into the NCAA tournament, but UK was defeated in the second game vs. LSU. With an unimpressive regular season and quick elimination in the SEC tournament, UK did indeed miss the NCAA tournament for the first time in 18 years and instead received an invitation to the NIT tournament where the team was defeated in the quarterfinal round against Notre Dame.[52][53] On March 27, 2009, an 18-minute-long meeting occurred between Billy Gillispie, President Dr. Lee Todd, Jr. and Athletic Director Mitch Barnhart, after which it was announced that Gillispie would not be returning as the head coach the next season. Barnhart stressed the firing was due to more than wins and losses, citing \"philosophical differences\" and \"a clear gap in how the rules and responsibilities overseeing the program are viewed\".[54] On April 1, 2009, John Calipari replaced former head coach Billy Gillispie as the Wildcats head coach. To begin his tenure at the University of Kentucky, John Calipari signed one of the best all time recruiting classes.[55] The class was headlined by four five-star recruits: John Wall, DeMarcus Cousins, Daniel Orton, and Eric Bledsoe.[56] On December 19, 2009, the Wildcats defeated Austin Peay 90–69 extending their record to 11–0, and John Calipari broke Adolph Rupp's record for the most consecutive wins to start a season for a first-year head coach at Kentucky. Kentucky defeated the Drexel Dragons 88–44 on December 21, 2009, to become the first program in college basketball history to claim their 2000th victory.[57] By January 25, 2010, Coach \"Cal\" had the Kentucky Wildcats ranked No. 1 in both the ESPN/Coaches poll and AP poll with a record of 19–0.[58] Calipari helped raise in excess of $1.5 million to aid the country of Haiti during the aftermath of the 2010 Haiti earthquake. President Barack Obama called the Wildcats to thank them for their relief efforts and wish them luck in their future endeavors. To finish off the 2009–10 regular season, Kentucky won its 44th SEC regular season championship (with a final 14–2 SEC record), and won its 26th SEC tournament championship, beating Mississippi State in the finals. The Wildcats then received a No. 1 seed (their 10th No. 1 seed in history) in the East Regional of the NCAA tournament, where they eventually lost to West Virginia in the Elite Eight. This also marked Kentucky's record 50th NCAA Tournament appearance. In 2011 the Wildcats got off to a good start in the regular season with a record of 12–2, with their only losses being North Carolina away and UConn in the Maui Invitational Finals. Conference play was a different matter, and Kentucky would struggle in the SEC losing 6 out of their 8 away games, all of one were against unranked opponents. To close out the season with a three-game defeat No. 13 Florida, No. 23 Vanderbilt and Tennessee at home for a 22–8 record. The hot streak would continue and Kentucky would win their 27th SEC Tournament Title. This was enough for No. 4 seed on the East regional where they played Princeton in a very close first-round game that ended in a 59–57 victory for the Cats. Knight, Jones and company would exact their revenge in the second round against West Virginia, who knocked off Kentucky in the 2010 tourney. In the Sweet Sixteen and Elite Eight they would upset the No. 1 seed Ohio State Buckeyes and No. 2 seed North Carolina Tar Heels on their way to the school's 14th Final Four. They lost in the Final Four to eventual National Champion No. 3 seed UConn 56–55. In the 2011–12 season, Calipari led Kentucky to being 16–0 in SEC regular season play, clinching its 45th SEC regular season championship. The last team to do so in the SEC was the 2002–03 Kentucky Wildcats, and before that, the 1995–96 Kentucky Wildcats. Kentucky's regular season record was 30–1, with its only loss being by one point coming from a 3-pointer buzzer-beater by the Indiana Hoosiers' Christian Watford at Assembly Hall on December 10, 2011. In the SEC Tournament, Kentucky fell to Vanderbilt in the championship game, making its overall record 32–2 going into the NCAA tournament. Kentucky was both selected as the No. 1 seed in the South Region and also the No. 1 seed overall of the entire NCAA Tournament. The Sweet 16 match-up on March 23, 2012, was a rematch against Indiana, in which this time the Wildcats prevailed over the Hoosiers 102–90. On March 25, 2012, Kentucky won the South Regional, setting up a Final Four semifinal with the Louisville Cardinals. Calipari's Wildcats defeated the Cardinals (coached by former Kentucky coach Rick Pitino) by a score of 69–61. This sent Kentucky to the National Championship game against the Kansas Jayhawks, where they defeated Kansas 67–59, winning UK's 8th NCAA championship, along with John Calipari's first NCAA Championship as a head coach. This Kentucky team had a record six players drafted in the 2012 NBA draft, including the first time two teammates have been chosen with the first two picks: Anthony Davis (1st overall), Michael Kidd-Gilchrist (2nd), Terrence Jones (18th), Marquis Teague (29th), Doron Lamb (42nd) and Darius Miller (46th). The 2012–13 season's recruiting class ranked either first or second by various recruiting experts led by top center Nerlens Noel, guard Archie Goodwin, forward Alex Poythress, and four-star center Willie Cauley-Stein. Kentucky also brought in transfer guard Julius Mays, a graduate student who had previously played at Wright State University and North Carolina State. Mays was eligible to play immediately, because UK offered a master's degree program that Wright State did not. However, the only returner that saw significant minutes from the championship squad was back-up power forward Kyle Wiltjer, who averaged 11 minutes per game (Ryan Harrow sat out the previous season after transferring from NC State before the 2011–12 season). Although the team saw the rise of Jarrod Polson in the first game of the season against Maryland, they struggled to close out closer games and play with the will to win that Calipari demands. On February 12, Noel tore his ACL in a loss against Florida. UK was 17–7 including that game, and went 4–5 the remainder of the season, losing all 5 games away from Rupp Arena. The fourth of those losses was against Vanderbilt in the first round of the SEC tournament, and UK missed the NCAA tournament altogether, being the overall No. 1 seed of the NIT. UK was upset by Robert Morris in the first round of the NIT, ending their season with a 21–12 record. In the press conference following the loss to Robert Morris, Calipari stated that his 2013–14 team would be a \"tough, hard-nosed, fighting team.\" Noel and Goodwin both entered the NBA draft and were both taken in the first round at 6th and 29th, respectively. Ryan Harrow transferred to Georgia State to be closer to his father that had suffered from a stroke, and Kyle Wiltjer transferred to Gonzaga. Kentucky brought in the No. 1 recruiting class, featuring a record six McDonald's All-Americans in Julius Randle, Andrew Harrison, Aaron Harrison, James Young, Dakari Johnson, and Marcus Lee, as well as Kentucky natives Derek Willis and Dominique Hawkins, and walk-on E. J. Floreal (son of Edrick Floréal, head coach of UK's track and field team). Alex Poythress and Willie Cauley-Stein did not declare for the 2013 NBA draft, and decided to return for their sophomore seasons. In 2013–14, Kentucky looked to make up for its struggles in the previous season. Despite making the NIT, there were high expectations for this team. The team, however, would be without some of its top players from the 2012–13 team including Nerlens Noel[59] and starting shooting guard Archie Goodwin,[60] who were first-round draft choices in the 2013 NBA draft. Starting power forward Kyle Wiltjer transferred to Gonzaga[61] and starting point guard Ryan Harrow transferred to Georgia State.[62] Returning was former McDonald's All-American Alex Poythress and starting center Willie Cauley-Stein.[60] The poor success of the 2012–13 team did not stop John Calipari from again producing another number one recruiting class. The entering class included a record six McDonald's All-Americans[63] highlighted by Julius Randle and the Harrison Twins from Texas, Aaron and Andrew. Many recruiting analysts and experts proclaimed that the 2013 signing class was the greatest recruiting class since the infamous Fab Five in the 1990s.[64] The team began the season ranked number one in both the AP and Coaches polls.[65][66] The season was full of ups and downs. Early in the season the team experienced close losses to Baylor, Michigan State, and North Carolina. Despite those losses the team was able to defeat in-state rival Louisville. Nothing changed in SEC play for them either. The team ended the regular season losing three of their last four games including once to South Carolina, who finished the season 14–20 overall. The team limped into the SEC tournament unranked, and desperately looking for any answer to their disappointing season. Calipari during his weekly radio call-in show mentioned the team was given a \"tweak\".[67] The \"tweak\" sparked speculation and curiosity among the fans and the media to what it could be. The \"tweak\" was never fully revealed. However, the \"tweak\" caused the team to go on an historic run through both the SEC and NCAA tournaments. UK was the runner-up to number one Florida in the SEC Tournament. During the NCAA tournament UK became the first team in history to eliminate three teams from the previous Final Four (Wichita State, Louisville, Michigan). UK was the National Runner-up after losing to Connecticut in the national championship game. After the 2014 season, Kentucky only lost Julius Randle and James Young to the NBA draft.[68][69] The returning players consisted of a record-tying nine McDonald's All-Americans. Juniors Cauley-Stein and Poythress returned with sophomores Aaron and Andrew Harrison, Johnson, and Lee to join the No. 2 ranked 2015 recruiting class which was highlighted of Gatorade Player of the Year Karl-Anthony Towns for the 2015 season.[70] The team began its season in the Bahamas on a six-game tour against international clubs and teams.[71] While in the Bahamas the team established a \"platoon system\" which featured two groups of five players that would rotate every four minutes within the game.[72] The \"platoon system\" was put on display nationally in a 72–40 victory over No. 5 Kansas in the Champions Classic in November.[73] In December, the team defeated UCLA 83–44. Kentucky led 41–7 at halftime, the lowest UCLA point total for a half in its storied history.[74] The SEC regular season began with two overtime victories over Ole Miss and Texas A&M, the closest games Kentucky would play all season. Kentucky finished the regular season with a perfect 31–0 record, the best start in school history.[75] In the SEC tournament, the team won each game by double digits, including a 78–63 victory over Arkansas in the finals. Cauley-Stein was named the MVP of the Tournament. In the NCAA tournament Kentucky played its first two games at the KFC Yum! Center in Louisville. Prior to the regional semifinal against West Virginia, Mountaineers guard Daxter Miles proclaimed that Kentucky would be 36–1 after the game. The comment fueled the team as they defeated West Virginia 78–39, tying the largest margin of victory in the Sweet 16 in NCAA Tournament history.[76] In the regional final Kentucky narrowly defeated Notre Dame 68–66. The only loss of the season was in the Final Four to Wisconsin, who Kentucky defeated the previous season in the Final Four. The 2014–15 team tied the NCAA record for most wins in a season (38).[77] After the season Cauley-Stein and Towns were named consensus All-Americans among other awards received. The Kentucky Wildcats represented USA Basketball, at Globl Jam 2023, and defeated Canada to win the gold medal. Following a first round upset as a 2 seed in the 2024 NCAA Tournament, John Calipari resigned his position of Head Coach to accept the same role at the University of Arkansas. He was officially announced as the Razorbacks Head Coach on April 10, 2024, marking the end of his storied tenure at Kentucky. On April 12, 2024, Kentucky hired BYU head coach Mark Pope for the same position in Lexington,[78] days after Calipari left for the vacant head coaching post at Arkansas.[79] Pope was a member of the Wildcats' 1995-1996 team that won the NCAA Tournament. The Wildcats have had 23 coaches in their 112-year history. Mark Pope is the current head coach. Six Wildcats coaches have won the National Coach-of-the-Year award: Adolph Rupp in 1950, 1954, 1959, 1966, and 1970, Joe B. Hall in 1978, Eddie Sutton in 1986, Rick Pitino in 1990 and 1992, Tubby Smith in 1998, 2003, and 2005, and John Calipari in 2012 and 2015. Additionally, seven Wildcats coaches have been named Southeastern Conference Coach-of-the-Year: Adolph Rupp in 1964, 1966, 1968, 1969, 1970, 1971 and 1972, Joe B. Hall in 1973, 1975, 1978 and 1983, Eddie Sutton in 1986, Rick Pitino in 1990, 1991 and 1996, Tubby Smith in 1998, 2003, and 2005, Billy Gillispie in 2008, and John Calipari in 2010, 2012, and 2015.[80] The following is a list of Kentucky's 8 National Championships: The NCAA began seeding the tournament with the 1979 edition. The * represents overall number one seed which began with the 2004 Tournament. Kentucky has 42 men's basketball players, coaches, and contributors honored in Rupp Arena with banners representing their numbers hung from the rafters. Due to the number of players honored, the fact that several of them have shared numbers, the numbers are not officially retired. Some of the jersey numbers were before the NCAA rule change before the 1957–58 season that outlawed teams wearing jerseys with a number higher than 5 on it that was not changed until 2023.[81] To have a banner hung, the individual must be elected to the UK Athletics Hall of Fame.[82] The following Kentucky players, coaches, and contributors have been enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. The following Kentucky players and coaches have represented their country in basketball in the Summer Olympic Games: The Kentucky Wildcats presently play their home games in 20,545-seat Rupp Arena. When it opened in 1976, it was the largest arena in the United States built specifically for basketball, and retained that status for much of the following 40-plus years. It was opened in 1976 and is named after legendary Kentucky head coach Adolph Rupp. Located off-campus, in downtown Lexington, the facility's official capacity was 23,500+[89] until a renovation project in the 2019 offseason reduced the capacity to 20,545.[90] The Wildcats have consistently led the country in home attendance since the 1976–77 season (when Rupp Arena first opened), winning the National Attendance Title a record 25 times, including 17 of the past 20 seasons, and 8 of the last 10 seasons. Kentucky also has an impressive 529–64 (.892) all-time record in Rupp Arena.[91] In 2007, the university unveiled the Joe Craft Center, a state-of-the-art basketball practice facility and athletics office building attached to the north side of Memorial Coliseum on the \"Avenue of Champions\" at the University of Kentucky campus in Lexington, Kentucky.[91] The 102,000 ft2 structure contains separate practice courts for the men's and women's basketball programs, separate men's and women's locker rooms, state-of-the-art video rooms for game film viewing, new coaches offices, a ticket office, and athletic administration offices.[92] As a result, Memorial Coliseum has more ample space for volleyball and gymnastics practice and games. The facility is named after businessman and philanthropist Joe Craft, a Hazard, Kentucky native, who pledged $6 million towards the completion of the $30 million project.[92][93] Coming off back-to-back national championships, the team moved to Memorial Coliseum in 1950. Nicknamed \"The House That Rupp Built\", the multipurpose facility cost $4 million and seated 12,000 people. It also housed a swimming pool, physical education equipment, and offices for the athletics staff. The team occupied Memorial Coliseum for twenty-six seasons, and sold out all 345 home games they played there during that period. Kentucky also played a 2009 NIT game at Memorial Coliseum due to Rupp Arena being booked. The Wildcats are 307–38 (.890) all-time at Memorial Coliseum.[89][91][94] Today, Memorial Coliseum is home to three UK women's teams—basketball, gymnastics, and volleyball. In 1924, Alumni Gymnasium was completed. It included seating for 2,800 people and cost $92,000 to construct.[95] Kentucky played 271 games at Alumni Gymnasium from 1924 to 1950, going 247–24 (.911).[91][96] After a major renovation completed in 2018, it is now a student recreation facility known as Alumni Gym Fitness Center.[97] Woodland Park Auditorium, opened in 1906 and closed in 1941, was located on the corner of East High Street and Kentucky Avenue in Lexington, Kentucky. Kentucky used this facility for home games during World War I between 1914 and 1916 going 15–7 there all-time.[91][98] The Wildcats played 84 home games at Buell Armory Gymnasium from 1910 to 1924. It was named for Union Civil War General Don Carlos Buell who was a member of the first board of trustees at Kentucky.[99] The armory was also used during World War I to teach truck maintenance and repair among other skills.[100] Kentucky was 59–25 all-time at Buell Armory Gymnasium.[101] The first home court for the Wildcats was simply called \"The Gymnasium\" or State College Gymnasium until 1910. It was located in the north wing of Barker Hall on the university campus. Constructed in 1902, it also housed the university's physical education classes until 1909. The facility had a capacity of 650 people, and with no bleachers or seats, fans had to stand to watch the games that were played there.[95] By the 1920s, it had become clear that \"The Gymnasium\" (by then renamed \"The Ladies' Gym\") was inadequate to house the university's basketball team. Records show Kentucky was 17–14 at State College Gymnasium.[91][100][102] (Of the 71 major categories listed above, Kentucky is No. 1 in 50 of them, No. 2 in 16 of them, No. No. 3 in 3 of them, No. 4 in 1 of them, and No. 8 in 1 of them.)
