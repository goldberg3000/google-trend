                <p class="article-content">加文·纽森（Gavin Christopher Newsom，1967年10月10日出生）是美国政治家和商人，自2019年起担任加州第40任州长。他是一名民主党成员，曾于2011年至2019年担任加州第49任副州长，并于2004年至2011年担任旧金山第42任市长。纽森于1989年从圣克拉拉大学毕业，获得政治学理学士学位。之后，他与亿万富翁继承人兼家族朋友戈登·盖蒂（Gordon Getty）作为投资者，在加州奥克维尔创立了精品酒庄PlumpJack Group。该公司发展壮大，管理着23家企业，包括酒庄、餐厅和酒店。纽森的政治生涯始于1996年，当时旧金山市长威利·布朗（Willie Brown）任命他为该市的停车和交通委员会委员。[1]次年，布朗再次任命纽森填补监督委员会的一个空缺职位，纽森于1998年首次当选该委员会成员。纽森于2003年当选旧金山市长，并在2007年连任。他在2010年当选加州副州长。担任副州长期间，纽森从2012年到2013年主持了《加文·纽森秀》（The Gavin Newsom Show）。他还撰写了2013年的书籍《公民城市》（Citizenville），重点探讨了如何利用数字化工具进行民主变革。他在2014年连任，并在2018年当选加州州长。在任期内，纽森因其在新冠肺炎疫情期间的个人行为和领导风格而受到批评，尤其是由于一些人认为其实施的严格封锁措施过于限制性且对经济造成损害。争议和公众对其领导力的不满导致2021年的一次针对他的罢免努力失败。他在2022年以超过59%的得票率成功连任。

纽森出生于1967年10月10日，是泰莎·托马斯（Tessa Thomas，娘家姓门齐斯）和威廉·阿尔弗雷德·纽森三世（William Alfred Newsom III）的儿子，威廉是加州上诉法院法官兼盖蒂石油公司律师。[2]他是旧金山的第四代居民。纽森的外曾祖父之一，苏格兰人托马斯·阿迪斯（Thomas Addis），是肾脏学领域的先驱科学家，也是斯坦福大学的医学教授。纽森是音乐家乔安娜·纽森（Joanna Newsom）的二堂叔，隔两代。[3]纽森的姑姑嫁给了罗恩·佩洛西（Ron Pelosi），他是美国众议院前议长南希·佩洛西（Nancy Pelosi）的兄弟。[4]纽森的父母于1971年离婚，当时他只有三岁。[5]纽森曾表示，他的童年并不轻松，部分原因是“相当严重”的阅读障碍。[4]他曾在旧金山的一所法美双语天主教学校，胜利圣母学校（École Notre Dame Des Victoires），上幼儿园和一年级，但最终转学，因为严重的阅读障碍一直困扰着他。这影响了他的写作、拼写、阅读和数字运算能力。[4]在整个求学过程中，纽森都不得不依靠有声读物、摘要和非正式口头指导。至今，他更喜欢通过音频来解读文件和报告。[6]纽森在胜利圣母学校上了三年级到五年级，在那里他被安排上了补习阅读课程。高中时，他打篮球和棒球，并于1985年从红杉高中（Redwood High School）毕业。纽森是篮球队得分后卫和棒球队外野手。他的球技让他登上了《马林独立报》（Marin Independent Journal）的封面。[7]泰莎·纽森做了三份工作来抚养加文和他的妹妹希拉里·纽森·卡兰（Hilary Newsom Callan）。在接受《旧金山纪事报》采访时，他的妹妹回忆起圣诞节时，他们的母亲告诉他们他们不会收到任何礼物。[7]泰莎在她家收留寄养儿童，这使纽森认识到公共服务的意义。[7][8]他父亲的经济状况很紧张，部分原因是他有把自己的收入分给别人的倾向。[8]纽森在高中做了几份工作来帮助补贴家用。[9]

                <h2 class="article-title">Gavin Newsom | Biography, Recall, & Facts | Britannica</h2>
                <p class="article-content">Gavin Newsom, born on October 10, 1967, in San Francisco, California, is an American Democratic politician currently serving as the governor of California since 2019. Before his governorship, he held the positions of lieutenant governor of California from 2011 to 2019 and mayor of San Francisco from 2004 to 2011. Newsom is the eldest of two children born to Tessa (Thomas Menzies) Newsom and William Alfred Newsom III, a lawyer and former appellate court justice. His parents divorced in 1972, leading him and his sister to be raised by their mother, who worked multiple jobs. 

Despite struggling academically due to severe dyslexia, diagnosed at age five, Newsom excelled in sports and attended Santa Clara University on a partial baseball scholarship. He played as a pitcher until an arm injury ended his career in his sophomore year, after which he graduated with a degree in political science in 1989. In 1992, he founded PlumpJack Winery in San Francisco, with investment from family friend Gordon P. Getty. The business flourished, allowing Newsom to expand into bars, restaurants, and hotels, ultimately making him a millionaire.

Newsom's political career began as a city supervisor in San Francisco, where he supported initiatives addressing homelessness, notably the Care Not Cash program, which was approved by voters in 2002. This initiative aimed to reduce cash payments to homeless individuals in favor of housing solutions, leading to a decrease in homelessness, although the issue persisted.

In 2003, Newsom ran for mayor of San Francisco, winning the election in a contentious runoff against Green Party candidate Matt Gonzalez. He gained national attention in 2004 for authorizing same-sex marriage licenses, which were later legalized nationwide in 2015. His tenure as mayor included liberal policies such as Healthy San Francisco, a universal health care program, alongside a more moderate economic approach that included tax incentives for businesses.

After an unsuccessful gubernatorial bid in 2009, Newsom was elected lieutenant governor in 2010 and re-elected in 2014. He won the governorship in 2018 with a focus on affordable housing and universal health care, taking office in January 2019. One of his early actions as governor was to impose a moratorium on the death penalty. 

Newsom's administration faced significant challenges, including the COVID-19 pandemic, during which he was the first governor to declare a state of emergency and implement strict health measures. His handling of the pandemic led to a Republican-backed recall effort, which he successfully defeated in September 2021. He was re-elected for a second term in November 2022 and continued to address environmental challenges such as wildfires and droughts.

On a personal note, Newsom was married to Kimberly Guilfoyle from 2001 to 2006 and later married filmmaker Jennifer Siebel in 2008, with whom he has four children.</p>

                <h2 class="article-title">Gavin Newsom, Governor of California - Yale Dyslexia</h2>
                <p class="article-content">Gavin Newsom, the former mayor of San Francisco and current governor of California, has a compelling story of overcoming challenges related to dyslexia. Diagnosed at a young age, Newsom struggled academically, particularly with reading and math. His early experiences in school were marked by difficulty and humiliation, which led to a decline in self-esteem. Despite these challenges, he found success in baseball and later in political science, ultimately turning his life around. Newsom credits his success to discipline, resilience, and a passion for politics, which allowed him to excel in a field he cared deeply about.

Throughout his political career, Newsom has focused on progressive issues, such as universal health care and sustainability, gaining respect for his willingness to take bold stances. He often shares his experiences with dyslexia to inspire others facing similar struggles, emphasizing the importance of discipline and the lessons learned from failure. Newsom's journey illustrates that with determination and support, individuals can overcome significant obstacles and achieve their goals.

In addition to Newsom, other public figures like John Hickenlooper, Michael Bennet, Carol Moseley Braun, and Anne Burke have also navigated their own paths in politics while dealing with learning differences. Their stories contribute to a broader narrative about the challenges and triumphs faced by individuals with dyslexia, highlighting the need for understanding and support in overcoming these obstacles.</p>
