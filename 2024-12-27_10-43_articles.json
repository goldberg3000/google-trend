                "content": "The Premier League is a professional association football league in England and the highest level of the English football league system. Contested by 20 clubs, it operates on a system of promotion and relegation with the English Football League (EFL). Seasons usually run from August to May, with each team playing 38 matches: two against each other team, one home and one away.[1] Most games are played on weekend afternoons, with occasional weekday evening fixtures.[2] The competition was founded as the FA Premier League on 20 February 1992, following the decision of First Division (the top-tier league from 1888 until 1992) clubs to break away from the English Football League. However, teams may still be relegated to and promoted from the EFL Championship. The Premier League is a corporation managed by a chief executive, with member clubs acting as shareholders.[3] The Premier League takes advantage of a £5 billion television rights deal, with Sky and BT Group securing the domestic rights to broadcast 128 and 32 games, respectively.[4][5] This deal will rise to £6.7 billion for the four seasons from 2025 to 2029.[6] The league is projected to earn $7.2 billion in overseas TV rights from 2022 to 2025.[7] Clubs were apportioned central payment revenues of £2.4 billion in 2016–17, with a further £343 million in solidarity payments to EFL clubs.[8] The Premier League is the most-watched sports league in the world, broadcast in 212 territories to 643 million homes, with a potential TV audience of 4.7 billion people.[9][10] For the 2023–24 season, the average Premier League match attendance was 38,375,[11] second to the German Bundesliga's 39,512,[12] whilst aggregated attendance across all matches in a 38-game season is the highest of any association football league.[13] Most stadium occupancies are near capacity.[14] As of 2023[update], the Premier League is ranked first in the UEFA coefficient rankings based on performances in European competitions over the past five seasons, ahead of Spain's La Liga.[15] The English top-flight has produced the second-highest number of European Cup / UEFA Champions League titles, with a record six English clubs having won fifteen European championships in total.[16] Fifty-one clubs have competed in the Premier League since its inception in 1992: 49 from England and 2 from Wales. Seven of them have won the title: Manchester United (13), Manchester City (8), Chelsea (5), Arsenal (3), Blackburn Rovers (1), Leicester City (1), and Liverpool (1).[17] Only six clubs have played in every season to date: Arsenal, Chelsea, Everton, Liverpool, Manchester United, and Tottenham Hotspur.[18] Despite significant European success in the 1970s and early 1980s, the late 1980s marked a low point for English football. Stadiums were deteriorating, supporters endured poor facilities, hooliganism was rife, and English clubs had been banned from European competition for five years following the Heysel Stadium disaster between the fans of Liverpool Football Club and the fans of Juventus in 1985.[19] The Football League First Division, the top level of English football since 1888, was behind leagues such as Italy's Serie A and Spain's La Liga in attendance and revenues, and several top English players had moved abroad.[20] By the turn of the 1990s, the downward trend was starting to reverse. At the 1990 FIFA World Cup, England reached the semi-finals; UEFA, European football's governing body, lifted the five-year ban on English clubs playing in European competitions in 1990, resulting in Manchester United lifting the Cup Winners' Cup in 1991. The Taylor Report on stadium safety standards, which proposed expensive upgrades to create all-seater stadiums in the aftermath of the Hillsborough disaster; between the fans of Liverpool and the fans of Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield, Yorkshire on 15 April 1989, was published in January 1990.[21] During the 1980s, major English clubs began to transform into business ventures, applying commercial principles to club administration to maximise revenue. Martin Edwards of Manchester United, Irving Scholar of Tottenham Hotspur, and David Dein of Arsenal were among the leaders in this transformation.[22] The commercial imperative led to the top clubs seeking to increase their power and revenue: the clubs in Division One threatened to break away from the Football League, and in doing so, they managed to increase their voting power and gain a more favourable financial arrangement, taking a 50% share of all television and sponsorship income in 1986.[22] They demanded that television companies should pay more for their coverage of football matches,[23] and revenue from television grew in importance. The Football League received £6.3 million for a two-year agreement in 1986, but by 1988, in a deal agreed with ITV, the price rose to £44 million over four years, with the leading clubs taking 75% of the cash.[24][25] According to Scholar, who was involved in the negotiations of television deals, each of the First Division clubs received only around £25,000 per year from television rights before 1986, this increased to around £50,000 in the 1986 negotiation, then to £600,000 in 1988.[26] The 1988 negotiations were conducted under the threat of ten clubs leaving to form a \"super league\", but they were eventually persuaded to stay, with the top clubs taking the lion's share of the deal.[24][27][28] The negotiations also convinced the bigger clubs that, in order to receive enough votes, they needed to take the whole of the First Division with them instead of a smaller \"super league\".[29] By the beginning of the 1990s, the big clubs again considered breaking away, especially now that they had to fund the cost of stadium upgrades as proposed by the Taylor Report.[30] In 1990, the managing director of London Weekend Television (LWT), Greg Dyke, met with the representatives of the \"big five\" football clubs in England (Manchester United, Liverpool, Tottenham Hotspur, Everton, and Arsenal) over a dinner.[31] The meeting was to pave the way for a breakaway from the Football League.[32] Dyke believed that it would be more lucrative for LWT if only the larger clubs in the country were featured on national television and wanted to establish whether the clubs would be interested in a larger share of television rights money.[33] The five clubs agreed with the suggestion and decided to press ahead with it; however, the league would have no credibility without the backing of the Football Association, and so David Dein of Arsenal held talks to see whether the FA were receptive to the idea. The FA did not have an amicable relationship with the Football League at the time and considered it a way to weaken the Football League's position.[34] The FA released a report in June 1991, Blueprint for the Future of Football, that supported the plan for the Premier League, with the FA as the ultimate authority that would oversee the breakaway league.[29] At the close of the 1990–1991 season, a proposal was tabled for the establishment of a new league that would bring more money into the game overall. The Founder Members Agreement, signed on 17 July 1991, by the game's top-flight clubs, established the basic principles for setting up the FA Premier League.[35] The newly formed top division was to have commercial independence from the Football Association and the Football League, giving the FA Premier League licence to negotiate its own broadcast and sponsorship agreements. The argument given at the time was that the extra income would allow English clubs to compete with teams across Europe.[20] Although Dyke played a significant role in the creation of the Premier League, he and ITV (of which LWT was part) lost out in the bidding for broadcast rights: BSkyB won with a bid of £304 million over five years, with the BBC awarded the highlights package broadcast on Match of the Day.[31][33] Luton Town, Notts County, and West Ham United were the three teams relegated from the old First Division at the end of the 1991–92 season, and did not take part in the inaugural Premier League season. They were replaced by Ipswich Town, Middlesbrough, and Blackburn Rovers, promoted from the old Second Division.[36] The 22 First Division clubs resigned en masse from the Football League in 1992, and on 27 May that year, the FA Premier League was formed as a limited company, working out of an office at the Football Association's then headquarters in Lancaster Gate.[20] The 22 inaugural members of the new Premier League were:[37] This meant a break-up of the 104-year-old Football League that had operated until then with four divisions; the Premier League would operate with a single division and the Football League with three. There was no change in competition format; the same number of teams competed in the top flight, and promotion and relegation between the Premier League and the new First Division remained the same as the old First and Second Divisions, with three teams relegated from the league and three promoted.[28] The league held its first season in 1992–93. It was composed of 22 clubs for that season (reduced to 20 in the 1995–96 season). The first Premier League goal was scored by Brian Deane of Sheffield United in a 2–1 win against Manchester United.[38] Manchester United won the inaugural edition of the new league, ending a twenty-six year wait to be crowned champions of England. Bolstered by this breakthrough, United immediately became the competition's dominant team, winning seven of the first nine trophies, two League and FA Cup 'doubles' and a European treble, initially under a team of hardened veterans such as Bryan Robson, Steve Bruce, Paul Ince, Mark Hughes, and Eric Cantona, before Cantona, Bruce, and Roy Keane led a young, dynamic new team filled with the Class of 92, a group of young players including David Beckham who came through the Manchester United Academy. Between 1993 and 1997, Blackburn Rovers and Newcastle United came close to challenging Manchester United's early dominance; Blackburn won the 1994–95 FA Premier League and Newcastle led the title charge over United for much of the 1995–96 season. As the decade closed, Arsenal replicated Manchester United's dominance by winning the League and FA Cup double in 1997–98, and together they would form a duopoly over the league between 1997 and 2003. The 2000s saw the rise of Liverpool alongside the \"Big 2\", followed by Chelsea finally breaking the Arsenal–Man United duopoly by winning the league in 2004–05. The dominance of the so-called \"Big Four\" clubs – Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, and Manchester United[39][40] – saw them finish at the top of the table for most of the decade, thereby guaranteeing qualification for the UEFA Champions League. Only three other clubs managed to qualify for the competition during this period: Newcastle United (2001–02 and 2002–03), Everton (2004–05), and Tottenham Hotspur (2009–10) – each occupying the final Champions League spot, with the exception of Newcastle in the 2002–03 season, who finished third. Following the 2003–04 season, Arsenal acquired the nickname \"The Invincibles\" as they became the first and, to date, only club to complete a Premier League campaign without losing a single game.[41][42] In May 2008, Kevin Keegan stated that \"Big Four\" dominance threatened the division: \"This league is in danger of becoming one of the most boring but great leagues in the world.\"[43] Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore said in defence: \"There are a lot of different tussles that go on in the Premier League depending on whether you're at the top, in the middle, or at the bottom that make it interesting.\"[44] Between 2005 and 2012, there was a Premier League representative in seven of the eight Champions League finals, with only the \"Big Four\" clubs reaching that stage. Liverpool (2005), Manchester United (2008), and Chelsea (2012) won the competition during this period, with Arsenal (2006), Liverpool (2007), Chelsea (2008), and Manchester United (2009 and 2011) all losing Champions League finals.[45] Leeds United were the only non-\"Big Four\" side to reach the semi-finals of the Champions League, in the 2000–01 season. There were three Premier League teams in the Champions League semi-finals in 2006–07, 2007–08, and 2008–09, a feat only ever achieved five times (along with Serie A in 2002–03 and La Liga in 1999–2000). Additionally, between the 1999–2000 and 2009–10 seasons, four Premier League sides reached the UEFA Cup or Europa League finals, with only Liverpool managing to win the competition in 2001. Arsenal (2000), Middlesbrough (2006), and Fulham (2010) all lost their finals.[46] Although the group's dominance was reduced to a degree after this period with the emergence of Manchester City and Tottenham, in terms of all-time Premier League points won, they remain clear by some margin. As of the end of the 2021–22 season – the 30th season of the Premier League – Liverpool, in fourth place in the all-time points table, were over 300 points ahead of the next team, Tottenham Hotspur. They are also the only teams to maintain a winning average of over 50% throughout their entire Premier League tenures.[47] The years following 2009 marked a shift from the \"Big Four\" with Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester City breaking into the top four places on a regular basis, turning the \"Big Four\" into the \"Big Six\".[48] In the 2009–10 season, Tottenham finished fourth and became the first new team to finish in the top four since Everton five years prior.[49] Criticism of the gap between an elite group of \"super clubs\" and the majority of the Premier League has continued, nevertheless, due to their increasing ability to spend more than the other Premier League clubs.[50] Manchester City won the title in the 2011–12 season, becoming the first club outside the \"Big Four\" to win since Blackburn Rovers in the 1994–95 season. That season also saw two of the \"Big Four\" (Chelsea and Liverpool) finish outside the top four places for the first time since that season.[48] With only four UEFA Champions League qualifying places available in the league, greater competition for qualification now exists, albeit from a narrow base of six clubs. In the five seasons following the 2011–12 campaign, Manchester United and Liverpool both found themselves outside of the top four three times, whilst Chelsea finished 10th in the 2015–16 season. Arsenal finished 5th in 2016–17, ending their record run of 20 consecutive top-four finishes.[51] In the 2015–16 season, underdogs Leicester City won the Premier League. With 5000/1 odds of winning the league at the beginning of the season, Leicester became the first club outside the \"Big Six\" to win the Premier League since Blackburn Rovers in the 1994–95 season.[52] Off the pitch, the \"Big Six\" wield significant financial power and influence, with these clubs arguing that they should be entitled to a greater share of revenue due to the greater stature of their clubs globally and the attractive football they aim to play.[53] Objectors argue that the egalitarian revenue structure in the Premier League helps to maintain a competitive league which is vital for its future success.[54] The 2016–17 Deloitte Football Money League report showed the financial disparity between the \"Big Six\" and the rest of the division. All of the \"Big Six\" had revenues greater than €350 million, with Manchester United having the largest revenue in the league at €676.3 million. Leicester City was the closest club to the \"Big Six\" in terms of revenue, recording a figure of €271.1 million for that season – helped by participation in the Champions League. The eighth-largest revenue generator, West Ham – who did not play in European competition – had revenues of €213.3 million, less than half of those of the club with the fifth-largest revenue, Liverpool (€424.2 million).[55] A substantial part of the clubs' revenue by then came from television broadcast deals, with the biggest clubs each taking from around £150 million to nearly £200 million in the 2016–17 season from such deals.[56] In Deloitte's 2019 report, all the \"Big Six\" were in the top ten of the world's richest clubs.[57] From the 2019–20 season, video assistant referees were used in the league.[58] The 2019–20 season saw Liverpool win their first Premier League trophy, their first top-flight trophy in 30 years.[59] Project Big Picture was announced in October 2020 that described a plan to reunite the top Premier League clubs with the English Football League, proposed by leading Premier League clubs Manchester United and Liverpool.[60] It has been criticised by the Premier League leadership and the UK government's Department for Culture, Media and Sport.[61] On 26 April 2021, play was stopped during a match between Leicester City and Crystal Palace to allow players Wesley Fofana and Cheikhou Kouyaté to break Ramadan fast. It is believed to be the first time in Premier League history that a game was paused to allow Muslim players to eat and drink after the sun had set in accordance with the rules of the faith.[62] The 2022–23 season was the first to take a six-week break between November and December 2022 to allow for the first winter World Cup,[63] with a return for the Boxing Day fixtures.[64] The Premier League players decided to take the knee at selected \"significant moments\". They assured to \"remain resolutely committed to eradicate racial prejudice\".[65] That season was notable for Newcastle United and Brighton & Hove Albion breaking the traditional \"Big Six\" as they finished fourth and sixth, respectively, whilst \"Big Six\" teams Tottenham and Chelsea finished eighth and twelfth.[66][67] Meanwhile, 2015–16 champions Leicester City were relegated, becoming the second league-winning club to suffer relegation since 1992, after Blackburn Rovers in the 2011–12 season.[68] In the 2023–24 season, Manchester City won the Premier League for the sixth time in seven years to become the first top-flight team to win four consecutive league titles in English football history.[69] Meanwhile, non-Big Six club Aston Villa finished fourth and qualified for the 2024–25 UEFA Champions League.[70] The Football Association Premier League Ltd (FAPL)[71][72][73] is operated as a corporation and is owned by the 20 member clubs. Each club is a shareholder, with one vote each on issues such as rule changes and contracts. The clubs select a chairman, chief executive, and board of directors to oversee the daily operations of the league.[74] The Football Association is not directly involved in the day-to-day operations of the Premier League, but has veto power as a special shareholder during the election of the chairman and chief executive and when new rules are adopted by the league.[75] The current chief executive is Richard Masters, who was appointed in December 2019.[76] The chair is currently Alison Brittain, who took over the role in early 2023.[77] The Premier League sends representatives to UEFA's European Club Association, the number of clubs and the clubs themselves chosen according to UEFA coefficients. For the 2023–24 season, the Premier League has 13 representatives in the Association: Arsenal, Aston Villa, Brighton & Hove Albion, Chelsea, Everton, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United, Newcastle United, Nottingham Forest, Tottenham Hotspur, West Ham United, and Wolverhampton Wanderers.[78] The European Club Association is responsible for electing three members to UEFA's Club Competitions Committee, which is involved in the operations of UEFA competitions such as the Champions League and UEFA Europa League.[79] The Premier League has faced criticism of its governance due to an alleged lack of transparency and accountability. Following the Premier League's blocking of the attempted takeover of Newcastle United by a PIF-backed consortium through the league's Owners' and Directors' test, many MPs, Newcastle United fans and related parties to the deal denounced the Premier League for its perceived lack of transparency and accountability throughout the process.[80][81][82] On 6 July 2021, consortium member Amanda Staveley of PCP Capital Partners said that \"fans surely deserve absolute transparency from the regulators across all their processes – to best ensure that they act responsibly. They (the Premier League) are performing a function like that of a government regulator – but without the same systems for accountability.\"[82] On 22 July 2021, Tracey Crouch MP – chair of the fan-led review into the UK's football governance – announced in the review's interim findings that the Premier League had \"lost the trust and confidence\" of fans. The review also recommended that a new independent regulator be created to oversee matters such as club takeovers.[83][84] Premier League chief executive Richard Masters had earlier spoken out against the implementation of an independent regulator, saying in May 2021, \"I don't think that the independent regulator is the answer to the question. I would defend the Premier League's role as regulator of its clubs over the past 30 years.\"[85] [The Premier League] is very tough and is different. If you compare this league to another league, it's like playing another sport. In [The Premier League] you never really know what is going to happen, there is very little between the teams. There are 20 clubs in the Premier League. During the course of a season (from August to May) each club plays the others twice (a double round-robin system), once at their home stadium and once at that of their opponents, for 38 games. Teams receive three points for a win and one point for a draw. No points are awarded for a loss. Teams are ranked by total points, then goal difference, and then goals scored. If still equal, teams are deemed to occupy the same position. If there is a tie for the championship, for relegation, or for qualification to other competitions, the head-to-head record between the tied teams is taken into consideration (points scored in the matches between the teams, followed by away goals in those matches.) If two teams are still tied, a play-off match at a neutral venue decides rank.[88] A system of promotion and relegation exists between the Premier League and the EFL Championship. The three lowest placed teams in the Premier League are relegated to the Championship, and the top two teams from the Championship promoted to the Premier League,[89] with an additional team promoted after a series of play-offs involving the third, fourth, fifth and sixth placed clubs.[90] The number of clubs was reduced from 22 to 20 in 1995, when four teams were relegated from the league and only two teams promoted.[91][92] The top flight had only been expanded to 22 teams at the start of the 1991–92 season – the year prior to the formation of the Premier League.[92] On 8 June 2006, FIFA requested that all major European leagues, including Italy's Serie A and Spain's La Liga, be reduced to 18 teams by the start of the 2007–08 season. The Premier League responded by announcing their intention to resist such a reduction.[93] Ultimately, the 2007–08 season kicked off again with 20 teams.[94] Video assistant referee (VAR), was introduced to the Premier League at the beginning of the 2019–20 season. It uses technology and officials to assist the referee in making decisions on the pitch.[95] However, its use has been met with mixed receptions from fans and pundits, with some praising its accuracy whilst others criticise its impact on the flow of the game and consistency of decision-making. The on-field referee still makes the final decision, but VAR can assist the referee in the decision-making process. VAR can only be used for four types of decisions: goals, penalty decisions, direct red card incidents, and cases of mistaken identity. VAR officials review the video footage and communicate with the on-field referee via a headset. The VAR officials are located in a central control room, which is equipped with multiple camera angles and the ability to replay footage at various speeds. A study evaluating fan reception of VAR in the Premier League was made by Otto Kolbinger and Melanie Knopp and was done by analysing Twitter data.[96] The researchers used sentiment analysis to measure the overall positive or negative attitudes towards VAR, as well as topic modelling to identify specific issues that fans are discussing related to VAR. The study found that the reception of VAR on Twitter is largely negative, with fans expressing frustration and criticism of the technology's impact on the flow of the game and the inconsistency of decisions. The researchers also identified specific issues, such as handball and offside decisions, that fans are particularly critical of. The study concludes that VAR has not been well received by fans in the Premier League, and that efforts to improve the technology and increase transparency in decision-making are needed to address these concerns. Fifty-one clubs have played in the Premier League from its inception in 1992, up to and including the 2023–24 season.[97] Titles won by club (%) Italics indicate former Premier League champions that are currently outside the Premier League. Twenty clubs are competing in the 2024–25 season – top seventeen from the previous season and three promoted from the Championship. In 2011, after Swansea City gained promotion, a Welsh club participated in the Premier League for the first time.[98][99] The first Premier League match to be played outside England was Swansea City's home match at Liberty Stadium against Wigan Athletic on 20 August 2011.[100] The number of Welsh clubs in the Premier League increased to two in 2013–14, as Cardiff City gained promotion,[101] but they were relegated after their maiden season.[102] Cardiff were promoted again in 2017–18 but the number of Welsh clubs remained the same for the 2018–19 Premier League season, as Swansea City had been relegated from the Premier League in 2017–18.[103] Following Cardiff City's relegation after the 2018–19 season, there are currently no Welsh clubs participating in the Premier League.[104] Because they are members of the Football Association of Wales (FAW), the question of whether clubs like Swansea should represent England or Wales in European competitions has caused long-running discussions in UEFA. Swansea took one of England's three available places in the Europa League in 2013–14 by winning the League Cup in 2012–13.[105] The right of Welsh clubs to take up such English places was in doubt until UEFA clarified the matter in March 2012, allowing them to participate.[106] Participation in the Premier League by some Scottish or Irish clubs has sometimes been discussed, but without result. The idea came closest to reality in 1998, when Wimbledon received Premier League approval to relocate to Dublin, Ireland, but the move was blocked by the Football Association of Ireland.[107][108][109][110] Additionally, the media occasionally discusses the idea that Scotland's two biggest teams, Celtic and Rangers, should or will take part in the Premier League, but nothing has come of these discussions.[111] The top four teams in the Premier League qualify automatically for the subsequent season's UEFA Champions League league phase. The champions of the Champions League and UEFA Europa League may earn an additional qualification for the subsequent season's Champions League league phase if did not finish in the top four. If this means six Premier League teams qualify, then the fourth-placed team in the Premier League is instead entered in the Europa League, as any single nation is limited to a maximum of five teams in the Champions League. However, starting from the 2024–25 UEFA Champions League there are additional berths for the two best associations in the previous season's ranking, which may result in a maximum of six teams from one association in the Champions League. The fifth-placed team in the Premier League, as well as the winners of the FA Cup, qualify for the subsequent season's Europa League league phase, but if the winner of the FA Cup also finishes in the top five places in the Premier League or has won one of UEFA's major tournaments, then this place reverts to the team that finished sixth. The winner of the EFL Cup qualifies for the subsequent season's UEFA Conference League, but if the winner had already qualified for a UEFA competition via their performance in another competition, then this place reverts to the team that finished sixth in the Premier League, or seventh if the FA Cup result had already caused the sixth-placed team to qualify.[112] The number of places allocated to English clubs in UEFA competitions is dependent upon the position the country holds in the UEFA coefficient rankings, which are calculated based on the performance of teams in UEFA competitions over the previous five years. Currently, England is ranked first, ahead of Spain. As of 26 September 2024, the coefficients for are as follows (only top five European leagues are shown):[113][114] An exception to the usual European qualification system happened in 2005, after Liverpool won the Champions League the season before, but did not finish in a Champions League qualification place in the Premier League. UEFA gave special dispensation for Liverpool to enter the Champions League, giving England five qualifiers.[115] The governing body subsequently ruled that the defending champions qualify for the competition the following year regardless of their domestic league placing. However, for those leagues with four entrants in the Champions League, this meant that if the Champions League winners finished outside the top four in its domestic league, it would qualify at the expense of the fourth-placed team. At that time, no association could have more than four entrants in the Champions League.[116] This occurred in 2012, when Chelsea – who had won the Champions League that summer, but finished sixth in the league – qualified for the 2012–13 Champions League in place of Tottenham Hotspur, who went into the Europa League.[117] From 2015–16, the Europa League champions qualify for the Champions League, increasing the maximum number of participants per country to five.[118] This took effect in England in 2016–17, when Manchester United finished sixth in the Premier League and won the Europa League, giving England five Champions League entrants for 2017–18.[119] In these instances, any Europa League berth vacated is not handed down to the next-best Premier League finisher outside of a qualifying place. If both Champions League and Europa League winners are of the same association and both finish outside the top four, then the fourth-placed team is transferred to the Europa League. With 48 continental trophies won, English clubs are the third-most successful in European football, behind Italy (50) and Spain (67). In the top-tier UEFA Champions League, a record six English clubs have won a total of 15 titles and lost a further 11 finals, behind Spanish clubs with 20 and 11, respectively.[120] In the second-tier UEFA Europa League, English clubs are third, with nine victories and eight losses in the finals.[121] In the former second-tier UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, English teams won a record eight titles and had a further five finalists.[122] In the non-UEFA organised Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, English clubs provided four winners and four runners-up, the second-most behind Spain with six and three, respectively.[123] In the newly created third-tier UEFA Conference League, English clubs have won a joint-record one title so far.[124] In the former fourth-tier UEFA Intertoto Cup, England won four titles and had a further final appearance, placing it fifth in the rankings, although English clubs were notorious for treating the tournament with disdain, either sending \"B\" squads or withdrawing from it altogether.[125][126][127] In the one-off UEFA Super Cup, England has ten winners and ten runners-up, the second-most behind Spain with 17 and 15, respectively.[128] Similarly to the Intertoto Cup, English teams did not take the former Intercontinental Cup seriously enough, despite its international status of the Club World Championship. They a made a total of six appearances in the one-off competition, winning only one of them, and withdrew a further three times.[129] English clubs have won the FIFA-organised Club World Cup four times, tied for the second-most with Brazil, and behind only Spain, with eight.[130][127] After an inaugural season with no sponsorship, the Premier League was sponsored by Carling from 1993 until 2001, during which time it was known as the FA Carling Premiership. In 2001, a new sponsorship deal with Barclaycard saw the league rebranded the FA Barclaycard Premiership, which was changed to the FA Barclays Premiership in time for the 2004–05 season. For the 2007–08 season, the league was rebranded the Barclays Premier League.[131][132] Barclays' deal with the Premier League expired at the end of the 2015–16 season. The organisation announced on 4 June 2015 that it would not pursue any further title sponsorship deals for the Premier League, arguing that they wanted to build a \"clean\" brand for the competition more in line with those of major U.S. sports leagues.[134] As well as sponsorship for the league itself, the Premier League has a number of official partners and suppliers.[135] The official ball supplier for the league is Nike who have had the contract since the 2000–01 season when they took over from Mitre.[136] Under its Merlin brand, Topps held the licence to produce collectables for the Premier League between 1994 and 2019 including stickers (for their sticker album) and trading cards.[137] Launched in the 2007–08 season, Topps' Match Attax, the official Premier League trading card game, is the best selling boys collectable in the UK, and is also the biggest selling sports trading card game in the world.[137][138] In October 2018, Panini were awarded the licence to produce collectables from the 2019–20 season.[139] The chocolate company Cadbury has been the official snack partner of the Premier League since 2017, and sponsored the Golden Boot, Golden Glove and Playmaker of the Season awards from the 2017–18 season to 2019–20 season.[140][141] The Coca-Cola Company (under its Coca-Cola Zero Sugar product line) sponsored these awards during the 2020–21 season with Castrol being the current sponsor as of the 2021–22 season.[142] The Premier League has the highest revenue of any association football league in the world, with total club revenues of €2.48 billion in 2009–10.[143][144] In 2013–14, due to improved television revenues and cost controls, the Premier League clubs collectively made a net profit in excess of £78 million, exceeding all other football leagues.[145] In 2010 the Premier League was awarded the Queen's Award for Enterprise in the International Trade category for its outstanding contribution to international trade and the value it brings to English football and the United Kingdom's broadcasting industry.[146] The Premier League includes some of the richest football clubs in the world. Deloitte's \"Football Money League\" listed seven Premier League clubs in the top 20 for the 2009–10 season,[147] and all 20 clubs were in the top 40 globally by the end of the 2013–14 season, largely as a result of increased broadcasting revenue.[148] In 2019, the league generated around £3.1 billion per year in domestic and international television rights.[4] Premier League clubs agreed in principle in December 2012, to radical new cost controls. The two proposals consist of a break-even rule and a cap on the amount clubs can increase their wage bill by each season. With the new television deals on the horizon, momentum has been growing to find ways of preventing the majority of the cash going straight to players and agents.[149] Central payments for the 2016–17 season amounted to £2,398,515,773 across the 20 clubs, with each team receiving a flat participation fee of £35,301,989 and additional payments for TV broadcasts (£1,016,690 for general UK rights to match highlights, £1,136,083 for each live UK broadcast of their games and £39,090,596 for all overseas rights), commercial rights (a flat fee of £4,759,404) and a notional measure of \"merit\" which was based upon final league position.[8] The merit component was a nominal sum of £1,941,609 multiplied by each finishing place, counted from the foot of the table (e.g., Burnley finished 16th in May 2017, five places counting upwards, and received 5 × £1,941,609 = £9,708,045 merit payment).[8] Since its split with the Football League, established clubs in the Premier League have a funding disparity from counterparts in lower leagues. Revenue from television rights between the leagues has played a part in this.[150] Promoted teams have found it difficult to avoid relegation in their first Premier League season. One Premier League newcomer has been relegated back to the Football League every season, save the 2001–02, 2011–12, 2017–18 & 2022–23 seasons. In the 1997–98 and 2023–24 seasons, all three promoted clubs were relegated by the season's end.[151] The Premier League distributes a portion of its television revenue as \"parachute payments\" to relegated clubs for adjustment to television revenue loss. The average Premier League team receives £41 million[152] whilst the average Championship club receives £2 million.[153] Starting with the 2013–14 season, these payments are in excess of £60 million over four seasons.[154] Critics maintain that the payments widen the gap between teams that have reached the Premier League and those that have not,[155] leading to the common occurrence of teams \"bouncing back\" soon after their relegation. Clubs which have failed to win immediate promotion back to the Premier League have seen financial problems, in some cases administration or liquidation. Further relegations down the footballing ladder have occurred for multiple clubs unable to cope with the gap.[156][157] Television has played a major role in the history of the Premier League. The League's decision to assign broadcasting rights to Sky in 1992 was at the time a radical decision, but one that has paid off. At the time, paid television was an almost untested proposition in the UK market as was charging fans to watch live televised football. However, a combination of Sky's strategy, the quality of Premier League football and the public's appetite for the game has seen the value of the Premier League's TV rights soar.[25] The Premier League sells its television rights on a collective basis. This is in contrast to some other European leagues, including La Liga, in which each club sells its rights individually, leading to a much higher share of the total income going to the top few clubs.[159] The money is divided into three parts:[160] half is divided equally between the clubs; one quarter is awarded on a merit basis based on final league position, the top club getting twenty times as much as the bottom club, and equal steps all the way down the table; the final quarter is paid out as facilities fees for games that are shown on television, with the top clubs generally receiving the largest shares of this. The income from overseas rights is divided equally between the twenty clubs.[161] Not all Premier League matches are televised in the United Kingdom, as the league upholds the long-standing prohibition on telecasts of any association football match (domestic or otherwise) that kicks off between 2:45 p.m. and 5:15 p.m. on Saturday matchdays.[162][163][164] The first Sky television rights agreement was worth £304 million over five seasons.[165] The next contract, negotiated to start from the 1997–98 season, rose to £670 million over four seasons.[165] The third contract was a £1.024 billion deal with BSkyB for the three seasons from 2001 to 2004. The league brought in £320 million from the sale of its international rights for the three-year period from 2004 to 2007. It sold the rights itself on a territory-by-territory basis.[166] Sky's monopoly was broken from August 2006 when Setanta Sports was awarded rights to show two out of the six packages of matches available. This occurred following an insistence by the European Commission that exclusive rights should not be sold to one television company. Sky and Setanta paid £1.7 billion, a two-thirds increase which took many commentators by surprise as it had been widely assumed that the value of the rights had levelled off following many years of rapid growth. Setanta also hold rights to a live 3 pm match solely for Irish viewers. The BBC retained the rights to show highlights for the same three seasons (on Match of the Day) for £171.6 million, a 63 per cent increase on the £105 million it paid for the previous three-year period.[167] Sky and BT Group (via its new channel BT Sport, now TNT Sports) agreed to jointly pay £84.3 million for delayed television rights to 242 games (that is the right to broadcast them in full on television and over the internet) in most cases for a period of 50 hours after 10 p.m. on matchday.[168] Overseas television rights fetched £625 million, nearly double the previous contract.[169] The total raised from those deals was more than £2.7 billion, giving Premier League clubs an average media income from league games of around £40 million-a-year from 2007 to 2010.[170] The TV rights agreement between the Premier League and Sky faced accusations of being a cartel, and a number of court cases arose as a result.[171] An investigation by the Office of Fair Trading in 2002 found BSkyB to be dominant within the pay TV sports market, but concluded that there were insufficient grounds for the claim that BSkyB had abused its dominant position.[172] In July 1999 the Premier League's method of selling rights collectively for all member clubs was investigated by the UK Restrictive Practices Court, which concluded that the agreement was not contrary to the public interest.[173] The BBC's highlights package on Saturday and Sunday nights, as well as other evenings when fixtures justify, ran until 2016.[174] Television rights alone for the period 2010 to 2013 were purchased for £1.782 billion.[175] On 22 June 2009, due to troubles encountered by Setanta Sports after it failed to meet a final deadline over a £30 million payment to the Premier League, ESPN was awarded two packages of UK rights containing 46 matches that were available for the 2009–10 season as well as a package of 23 matches per season from 2010 to 2013.[176] On 13 June 2012, the Premier League announced that BT had been awarded 38 games a season for the 2013–14, 2014–15 and 2015–16 seasons at £246 million-a-year. The remaining 116 games were retained by Sky, which paid £760 million-a-year. The total domestic rights raised £3.018 billion, an increase of 70.2% over the 2010–11 to 2012–13 rights.[177] The value of the licensing deal rose by another 70.2% in 2015, when Sky and BT paid £5.136 billion to renew their contracts with the Premier League for another three years up to the 2018–19 season.[178] A new rights cycle began in the 2019–20 season, with the domestic package increasing to 200 matches overall; in February 2018, BT were awarded the package of 32 lunchtime fixtures on Saturdays, whilst Sky was awarded four of the seven packages, covering the majority of weekend fixtures (including eight new prime time fixtures on Saturdays), as well as Monday and Friday matches. Two remaining packages of 20 fixtures each were to be sold at a later date, including three rounds of mid-week fixtures and a bank holiday round. As Sky already owned the maximum number of matches it could hold without breaching a 148-match cap, it was speculated that at least one of the new packages could go to a new entrant, such as a streaming service. The five packages sold to BT and Sky were valued at £4.464 billion.[179] In June 2018, it was announced that Amazon Prime Video and BT had acquired the remaining two packages; Amazon acquired rights to 20 matches per-season, covering a mid-week round in December, and all Boxing Day fixtures.[180] The Amazon telecasts are produced in association with Sunset + Vine and BT Sport.[181] With the resumption of play in the 2019–20 Premier League due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom, the Premier League announced that all remaining matches would be carried on British television, split primarily across Sky, BT, and Amazon. A large number of these matches were also scheduled for free-to-air broadcasts, with Sky airing 25 on Pick, Amazon streaming its four matches on Twitch, and the BBC – for the first time in league history – carrying four live matches.[182][183][184][185] As matches would continue to be played without spectators upon the start of the 2020–21 Premier League, its clubs voted on 8 September to continue broadcasting all matches through at least September (with the BBC and Amazon each holding one additional match), and \"appropriate arrangements\" being made for October.[186][187] It was later announced that matches not selected for broadcast would be carried on pay-per-view via BT Sport Box Office and Sky Box Office at a cost of £14.95 per-match. The PPV scheme was poorly received; the Football Supporters' Federation felt that the price was too high, and there were concerns that it could encourage piracy. There were calls from supporters to boycott the pay-per-views, and make donations to support charitable causes instead (with Newcastle's \"Charity Not PPV\" campaign raising £20,000 for a local food bank, and Arsenal fans raising £34,000 for Islington Giving). On 13 November, amid the reintroduction of measures across the UK, the Premier League officially announced that the non-televised matches would be assigned to its main broadcast partners, and again including additional matches for the BBC and Amazon Prime.[188][189][190][191] The next cycle of rights between 2022–23 and 2024–25 season was renewed without tender due to compelling and exceptional circumstances in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, rights remained as they were since the 2019–20 season.[192] UK highlights In August 2016, it was announced the BBC would be creating a new magazine-style show for the Premier League entitled The Premier League Show.[193] The Premier League is the most-watched football league in the world, broadcast in 212 territories to 643 million homes and a potential TV audience of 4.7 billion people.[9] The Premier League's production arm, Premier League Productions, is operated by IMG Productions and produces content for its international television partners.[194] On 22 November 2024, the Premier League announced plans to end its agreement with IMG and take Premier League Productions in-house beginning in 2026–27.[195] The Premier League is the most widely distributed sports programme in Asia.[196] In the Indian subcontinent, the matches are broadcast live on STAR Sports.[197] In MENA region, BeIN Sports holds exclusive rights to the Premier League.[198] In China, the broadcast rights were awarded to iQiyi, Migu and CCTV that began in the 2021–22 season.[199][200][201] SCTV broadcast the matches for Indonesia, and Astro for Malaysia. In Australia, Optus telecommunications holds exclusive rights to the Premier League, providing live broadcasts and online access (Fox Sports formerly held rights).[202] As of the 2022–23 season, Canadian media rights to the Premier League are owned by FuboTV,[203] after having been jointly owned by Sportsnet and TSN, and most recently DAZN.[204] The Premier League is broadcast in the United States by NBC Sports, a division of Sky parent Comcast.[205] Acquiring the rights to the Premier League in 2013 (replacing Fox Soccer and ESPN), NBC Sports has been widely praised for its coverage.[206][207][208] NBC Sports reached a six-year extension with the Premier League in 2015 to broadcast the league until the end of the 2021–22 season in a deal valued at $1 billion (£640 million).[209][210] In November 2021, NBC reached another six-year extension through 2028 in a deal valued at $2.76 billion (£2 billion).[211][212] The Premier League is broadcast by SuperSport across sub-Saharan Africa.[213] Broadcasters to continental Europe until 2025 include Canal+ for France,[214] Sky Sport Germany for Germany and Austria,[215] Match TV for Russia,[216] Sky Sport Italy for Italy,[217] Eleven Sports for Portugal,[218] DAZN for Spain,[219] beIN Sports Turkey to Turkey,[220] Digi Sport for Romania,[221] and NENT to Nordic countries (Sweden, Denmark and Norway),[222] Poland and the Netherlands.[223] In South America, ESPN covers much of the continent,[224] with coverage in Brazil shared between ESPN Brasil and ESPN4.[225][226] Paramount+ broadcasts the league in Central America.[227] As of the 2023–24 season, Premier League football has been played in 61 stadiums since the formation of the division.[228] The Hillsborough disaster in 1989 and the subsequent Taylor Report saw a recommendation that standing terraces should be abolished. As a result, all stadiums in the Premier League are all-seater.[229][230] Since the formation of the Premier League, football grounds in England have seen constant improvements to capacity and facilities, with some clubs moving to new-build stadiums.[231] Eleven stadiums that have seen Premier League football have now been demolished. The stadiums for the 2023–24 season show a large disparity in capacity. For example, Old Trafford, the home of Manchester United, has a capacity of 74,031 whilst Dean Court, the home of Bournemouth, has a capacity of 11,307. The combined total capacity of the Premier League in the 2023–24 season is 787,002 with an average capacity of 39,350. Stadium attendances are a significant source of regular income for Premier League clubs.[232] For the 2022–23 season, average attendances across the league clubs were 40,235 for Premier League matches with an aggregate attendance of 15,289,340.[233] This represents an increase of 19,109 from the average attendance of 21,126 recorded in the Premier League's first season (1992–93).[234] However, during the 1992–93 season, the capacities of most stadiums were reduced as clubs replaced terraces with seats in order to meet the Taylor Report's 1994–95 deadline for all-seater stadiums.[235][236] The 2022–23 season also set a competition record for total attendance with more than 15 million spectators, with average attendance also reaching record levels, surpassing the previous record of 39,989 set in the 2021–22 season, which in turn broke over 70 years old record set in 1948–49 season.[237] In October 2024 it was reported that the government is planning to grant the independent regulator authority to stop Premier League clubs from selling their stadiums to affiliated or third-party companies.[238] I have never known this level before. Of course, there are managers in Germany, Italy, and Spain, but in the Premier League, these are the best managers, the elite managers. The quality, the preparation. The level is so high. Managers in the Premier League are involved in the day-to-day running of the team, including the training, team selection and player acquisition. Their influence varies from club-to-club and is related to the ownership of the club and the relationship of the manager with fans.[240] Managers are required to have a UEFA Pro Licence which is the final coaching qualification available, and follows the completion of the UEFA 'B' and 'A' Licences.[241] The UEFA Pro Licence is required by every person who wishes to manage a club in the Premier League on a permanent basis (i.e., more than 12 weeks, the amount of time an unqualified caretaker manager is allowed to take control).[242] Caretaker appointments are managers that fill the gap between a managerial departure and a new appointment. Several caretaker managers have gone on to secure a permanent managerial post after performing well as a caretaker, including Paul Hart at Portsmouth, David Pleat at Tottenham Hotspur and Ole Gunnar Solskjær at Manchester United. Arsène Wenger is the longest-serving manager, having been in charge of Arsenal in the Premier League from 1996 to his departure at the conclusion of the 2017–18 season, and holds the record for most matches managed in the Premier League with 828, all with Arsenal. He broke the record set by Alex Ferguson, who had managed 810 matches with Manchester United from the Premier League's inception to his retirement at the end of the 2012–13 season. Ferguson was in charge of Manchester United from November 1986 until his retirement at the end of the 2012–13 season, meaning he was manager for the last five years of the old Football League First Division and all of the first 21 seasons of the Premier League.[243] Notably, since its creation the Premier League has never been won by an English manager. There have been several studies into the reasoning behind, and effects of, managerial sackings. Most famously, Sue Bridgewater of the University of Liverpool and Bas ter Weel of the University of Amsterdam, performed two separate studies which helped to explain the statistics behind managerial sackings. Bridgewater's study found clubs generally sack their managers upon dropping below an average of one point per match.[244] Player transfers may only take place within transfer windows set by the Football Association. The two transfer windows run from the last day of the season to 31 August and from 31 December to 31 January. Player registrations cannot be exchanged outside these windows except under specific licence from the FA, usually on an emergency basis.[246] As of the 2010–11 season, the Premier League introduced new rules mandating that each club must register a maximum 25-man squad of players aged over 21, with the squad list only allowed to be changed in transfer windows or in exceptional circumstances.[247][248] This was to enable the \"home grown\" rule to be enacted, whereby the Premier League would also from 2010 require at least eight members of the named 25-man squad to be \"home-grown players\".[247] At the inception of the Premier League in 1992–93, just 11 players named in the starting line-ups for the first round of matches hailed from outside of the United Kingdom or Ireland.[249] By 2000–01, the number of foreign players participating in the Premier League was 36% of the total. In the 2004–05 season, the figure had increased to 45%. On 26 December 1999, Chelsea became the first Premier League side to field an entirely foreign starting line-up,[250] and on 14 February 2005, Arsenal were the first to name a completely foreign 16-man squad for a match.[251] By 2009, under 40% of the players in the Premier League were English.[252] By February 2020, 117 different nationalities had played in the Premier League, and 101 nationalities had scored in the competition.[253] In 1999, in response to concerns that clubs were increasingly passing over young English players in favour of foreign players, the Home Office tightened its rules for granting work permits to players from countries outside of the European Union.[254] A non-EU player applying for the permit must have played for his country in at least 75 per cent of its competitive 'A' team matches for which he was available for selection during the previous two years, and his country must have averaged at least 70th place in the official FIFA world rankings over the previous two years. If a player does not meet those criteria, the club wishing to sign him may appeal.[255] Following the implementation of Brexit in January 2021, new regulations were introduced which require all foreign players to obtain a Governing Body Endorsement (GBE) in order to play football in the United Kingdom, regardless of EU status.[256] Italics denotes players still playing professional football,Bold denotes players still playing in the Premier League. The Premier League Golden Boot is awarded each season to the top scorer in the division. Former Blackburn Rovers and Newcastle United striker Alan Shearer holds the record for most Premier League goals with 260.[258] Thirty-three players have reached the 100-goal mark.[259] Since the first Premier League season in 1992–93, 23 players from 11 clubs have won or shared the top scorer title.[260] Thierry Henry won his fourth overall scoring title by scoring 27 goals in the 2005–06 season. Erling Haaland holds the record for most goals in a Premier League season (38 matches) with 36 goals as of 15 May 2023.[261] Ryan Giggs of Manchester United holds the record for scoring goals in consecutive seasons, having scored in the first 21 seasons of the league.[262] Giggs also holds the record for the most Premier League assists, with 162.[263] There is no team or individual salary cap in the Premier League. As a result of the increasingly lucrative television deals, player wages rose sharply following the formation of the Premier League, when the average player wage was £75,000 per year.[264] In the 2018–19 season the average annual salary stood at £2.99 million. The total salary bill for the 20 Premier League clubs in the 2018–19 season was £1.62 billion; this compares to £1.05 billion in La Liga, £0.83 billion in Serie A, £0.72 billion in Bundesliga, and £0.54 billion in Ligue 1. The club with the highest average wage is Manchester United at £6.5 million. This is smaller than the club with the highest wage bill in Spain (Barcelona £10.5 million) and Italy (Juventus £6.7 million), but higher than in Germany (Bayern Munich £6.4 million) and France (Paris Saint-Germain £6.1 million). For the 2018–19 season, the ratio of the wages of the highest-paid team to lowest-paid in the Premier League is 6.82 to 1. This is much lower than in La Liga (19.1 to 1), Serie A (16 to 1), Bundesliga (20.5 to 1), and Ligue 1 (26.6 to 1). Because of the lower differential between team wage bills in the Premier League, it is often regarded as being more competitive than other top European leagues.[265] The record transfer fee for a Premier League player has risen steadily over the lifetime of the competition. Before the start of the first Premier League season, Alan Shearer became the first British player to command a transfer fee of more than £3 million.[266] The record has increased steadily and Enzo Fernández is now the most expensive transfer fee paid by a Premier League club at £106.8 million, whilst Philippe Coutinho is the biggest transfer involving a Premier League club at £105 million. The Premier League maintains two trophies – the genuine trophy (held by the reigning champions) and a spare replica. Two trophies are held for the purpose of making the award within minutes of the title being secured, in the event that on the final day of the season two clubs are still within reach of winning the League.[293] In the rare event that more than two clubs are vying for the title on the final day of the season, a replica won by a previous club is used.[294] The current Premier League trophy was created by Royal Jewellers Garrard & Co/Asprey of London and was designed in house at Garrard & Co by Trevor Brown and Paul Marsden. It consists of a trophy with a golden crown and a malachite plinth base. The plinth weighs 33 pounds (15 kg) and the trophy weighs 22 pounds (10.0 kg).[295] The trophy and plinth are 76 cm (30 in) tall, 43 cm (17 in) wide and 25 cm (9.8 in) deep.[296] Its main body is solid sterling silver and silver gilt, whilst its plinth is made of malachite, a semi-precious stone. The plinth has a silver band around its circumference, upon which the names of the title-winning clubs are listed. The green of the malachite represents the green field of play.[296] The design of the trophy is based on the heraldry of Three Lions that is associated with English football. Two of the lions are found above the handles on either side of the trophy – the third is symbolised by the captain of the title-winning team as he raises the trophy, and its gold crown, above his head at the end of the season.[297] The ribbons that drape the handles are presented in the team colours of the league champions that year. In 2004, a special gold version of the trophy was commissioned to commemorate Arsenal winning the title without a single defeat.[298] In addition to the winner's trophy and the individual winner's medals awarded to players who win the title, the Premier League also issues other awards throughout the season. A man-of-the-match award is awarded to the player who has the greatest impact in an individual match. Monthly awards are also given for the Manager of the Month, Player of the Month and Goal of the Month.[299] These are also issued annually for Manager of the Season,[300] Player of the Season[301] and Goal of the Season. The Young Player of the Season award is given to the most outstanding U-23 player starting from the 2019–20 season.[302] The Golden Boot award is given to the top goalscorer of every season, the Playmaker of the Season award is given to the player who makes the most assists of every season,[141] and the Golden Glove award is given to the goalkeeper with the most clean sheets at the end of the season.[303] Starting with the 2021–22 season, four new awards are given. The Save of the Season is awarded to the goalkeeper deemed to have made the most impressive save.[304] The Game Changer of the Season is earned by the player with the single most game-changing performance over the course of the campaign.[305] The Most Powerful Goal is given to the player whose goal-scoring shot had the highest average velocity from the time it was struck to the time it crossed the goal line, and the Most Improbable Comeback award is meant for the team that, based on calculations performed by Oracle Corporation, goes behind and overcomes a deficit to win their respective match.[306] From the 2017–18 season, players receive a milestone award for 100 appearances and every century there after and also players who score 50 goals and multiples thereof. Each player to reach these milestones is to receive a presentation box from the Premier League containing a special medallion and a plaque commemorating their achievement.[307] In 2012, the Premier League celebrated its second decade by holding the 20 Seasons Awards:[308] Bibliography",

                "content": "Liverpool is a cathedral and port city and metropolitan borough in Merseyside, England, which had a population of 496,770 in 2022.[3] It is on the eastern side of the Mersey Estuary, near the Irish Sea, 178 miles (286 km) northwest of London. Liverpool is the fifth largest city in the United Kingdom and the administrative headquarters of the Liverpool City Region, a combined authority area with a population of over 1.5 million.[5] Liverpool's wider metropolitan area is estimated to have a population of more than 2.2 million people.[6] Established as a borough in Lancashire in 1207, Liverpool became significant in the late 17th century when the Port of Liverpool was heavily involved in the Atlantic slave trade. The port also imported cotton for the Lancashire textile mills, and became a major departure point for English and Irish emigrants to North America. Liverpool rose to global economic importance at the forefront of the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century and was home to the first intercity railway, the first non-combustible warehouse system (the Royal Albert Dock), and a pioneering elevated electrical railway; it was granted city status in 1880 and was moved from Lancashire to the newly created county of Merseyside in 1974. It entered a period of decline in the mid-20th century, but has experienced regeneration since the European Union selected it as the European Capital of Culture in 2008,[a] which was reported to have generated over £800 million for the local economy within a year.[7][8] The economy of Liverpool is diversified and encompasses tourism, culture, maritime, hospitality, healthcare, life sciences, advanced manufacturing, creative, and digital sectors.[9][10][11] The city is home to the UK's second highest number of art galleries, national museums, listed buildings, and parks and open spaces, with only London having more.[12] It is often used as a filming location due to its architecture, and was the fifth most visited UK city by foreign tourists in 2022.[13] It has produced numerous musicians, most notably the Beatles, and artists from the city have had more UK No. 1 hit singles than anywhere else.[14] It has also produced academics, actors, artists, comedians, filmmakers, poets, scientists, sportspeople, and writers. It is the home of Premier League football teams Everton and Liverpool. The world's oldest still-operating mainline train station, Liverpool Lime Street, is in the city centre; it is also served by the underground Merseyrail network. The city's port was the fourth largest in the UK in 2023, with numerous shipping and freight lines having headquarters and offices there.[15] Residents of Liverpool are often called \"Scousers\" in reference to scouse, a local stew made popular by sailors in the city, while \"Scouse\" is also the most common name given to the local accent. The city's cultural and ethnic diversity is a result of attracting immigrants, especially from Ireland, Scandinavia, and Wales; it is also the home of a large black and Chinese community, and the first mosque in England.[16] The name comes from the Old English lifer, meaning thick or muddy water, and pōl, meaning a pool or creek, and is first recorded around 1190 as Liuerpul.[17][18] According to the Cambridge Dictionary of English Place-Names, \"The original reference was to a pool or tidal creek now filled up into which two streams drained\".[19] The place appearing as Leyrpole, in a legal record of 1418, may also refer to Liverpool.[20] Other origins of the name have been suggested, including \"elverpool\", a reference to the large number of eels in the Mersey.[21] The adjective \"Liverpudlian\" was first recorded in 1833.[18] Although the Old English origin of the name Liverpool is beyond dispute, claims are sometimes made that the name Liverpool is of Welsh origin, but these are without foundation. The Welsh name for Liverpool is Lerpwl, from a former English local form Leerpool. This is a reduction of the form \"Leverpool\" with the loss of the intervocalic [v] (seen in other English names and words e.g. Daventry (Northamptonshire) > Danetry, never-do-well > ne’er-do-well). In the 19th century, some Welsh publications used the name \"Lle'r Pwll\" (\"(the) place (of) the pool\"), a reinterpretation of Lerpwl, probably in the belief that \"Lle'r Pwll\" was the original form. Another name, which is widely known even today, is Llynlleifiad, again a 19th-century coining. \"Llyn\" is pool, but \"lleifiad\" has no obvious meaning. G. Melville Richards (1910–1973), a pioneer of scientific toponymy in Wales, in \"Place Names of North Wales\",[22] does not attempt to explain it beyond noting that \"lleifiad\" is used as a Welsh equivalent of \"Liver\". A derivative form of a learned borrowing into Welsh (*llaf) of Latin lāma (slough, bog, fen) to give \"lleifiad\" is possible, but unproven. In the Middle Ages, Liverpool existed firstly as farmland within the West Derby Hundred[23] before growing in to a small town of farmers, fishermen and tradesmen and tactical army base for King John of England. The town was planned with its own castle, although due to outbreaks of disease and its subordinance to the nearby Roman port of Chester, the town's growth and prosperity stagnated until the late 17th and early 18th centuries. Substantial growth took place in the mid-late 18th century when the town became the most heavily involved European port in the Atlantic slave trade.[24] King John's letters patent of 1207 announced the foundation of the borough of Liverpool (then spelt as Liuerpul). There is no evidence that the place had previously been a centre of any trade. The creation of the borough was probably due to King John deciding it would be a convenient place to embark men and supplies for his Irish campaigns, in particular John's Irish campaign of 1209.[25][26] The original street plan of Liverpool is said to have been designed by King John near the same time it was granted a royal charter, making it a borough. The original seven streets were laid out in the shape of a double cross: Bank Street (now Water Street), Castle Street, Chapel Street, Dale Street, Juggler Street (now High Street), Moor Street (now Tithebarn Street) and Whiteacre Street (now Old Hall Street).[26] Liverpool Castle was built before 1235, it survived until it was demolished in the 1720s.[27] By the middle of the 16th century, the population was still around 600, although this was likely to have fallen from an earlier peak of 1000 people due to slow trade and the effects of the plague.[28][29][30] In the 17th century, there was slow progress in trade and population growth. Battles for control of the town were waged during the English Civil War, including a brief siege in 1644.[31] In 1699, the same year as its first recorded slave ship, Liverpool Merchant, set sail for Africa,[32] Liverpool was made a parish by Act of Parliament. But arguably, the legislation of 1695 that reformed the Liverpool council was of more significance to its subsequent development.[33] Since Roman times nearby Chester on the River Dee had been the region's principal port on the Irish Sea. However, as the Dee began to silt up, maritime trade from Chester became increasingly difficult and shifted towards Liverpool on the neighbouring River Mersey. The first of the Liverpool docks was constructed in 1715, and the system of docks gradually grew into a large interconnected system.[34] As trade from the West Indies, including sugar, surpassed that of Ireland and Europe, and as the River Dee continued to silt up, Liverpool began to grow with increasing rapidity. The first commercial wet dock was built in Liverpool in 1715.[35][36] Substantial profits from the slave trade and tobacco helped the town to prosper and rapidly grow, although several prominent local men, including William Rathbone, William Roscoe and Edward Rushton, were at the forefront of the local abolitionist movement.[37] The 19th century saw Liverpool rise to global economic importance. Pioneering, world first, technology and civic facilities launched in the city to serve the accelerating population which was fuelled by an influx of ethnic and religious communities from all around the world. By the start of the 19th century, a large volume of trade was passing through Liverpool, and the construction of major buildings reflected this wealth. In 1830, Liverpool and Manchester became the first cities to have an intercity rail link, through the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. The population continued to rise rapidly, especially during the 1840s when Irish migrants began arriving by the hundreds of thousands as a result of the Great Famine. While many Irish settled during this time in the city, a large percentage also emigrated to the United States or moved to the industrial centres of Lancashire, Yorkshire and the Midlands.[38] In her poetical illustration \"Liverpool\" (1832), which celebrates the city's worldwide commerce, Letitia Elizabeth Landon refers specifically to the Macgregor Laird expedition to the Niger River, at that time in progress.[39] This is to a painting by Samuel Austin, Liverpool, from the Mersey.[40] Britain was a major market for cotton imported from the Deep South of the United States, which fed the textile industry in the country. Given the crucial place cotton held in the city's economy, during the American Civil War Liverpool was, in the words of historian Sven Beckert, \"the most pro-Confederate place in the world outside the Confederacy itself.\"[41] Liverpool merchants helped to bring out cotton from ports blockaded by the Union Navy, built ships of war for the Confederacy, and supplied the South with military equipment and credit.[42] During the war, the Confederate Navy ship, the CSS Alabama, was built at Birkenhead on the Mersey, and the CSS Shenandoah surrendered there (being the final surrender at the end of the war). The city was also the center of Confederate purchasing war materiel, including arms and ammunition, uniforms, and naval supplies to be smuggled by British blockade runners to the South.[43] For periods during the 19th century, the wealth of Liverpool exceeded that of London,[44] and Liverpool's Custom House was the single largest contributor to the British Exchequer.[45] Liverpool was the only British city ever to have its own Whitehall office.[46] During this century, at least 40% of the world's entire trade passed through Liverpool.[47] In the early 19th century, Liverpool played a major role in the Antarctic sealing industry, in recognition of which Liverpool Beach in the South Shetland Islands is named after the city.[48] As early as 1851, the city was described as \"the New York of Europe\".[49] During the late 19th and early 20th century, Liverpool was attracting immigrants from across Europe. This resulted in the construction of a diverse array of religious buildings in the city for the new ethnic and religious groups, many of which are still in use today. The Deutsche Kirche Liverpool, Greek Orthodox Church of St Nicholas, Gustav Adolf Church and Princes Road Synagogue were all established in the 1800s to serve Liverpool's growing German, Greek, Nordic and Jewish communities, respectively. One of Liverpool's oldest surviving churches, St. Peter's Roman Catholic Church, served the Polish community in its final years as a place of worship. The 20th century saw Liverpool's established rank as a global economic powerhouse challenged. Its strategic location as an international seaport made it particularly vulnerable in two World wars. Economic depressions (both in the United Kingdom and across the world), changing housing patterns and containerisation in the maritime industry contributed to a downtrend in the city's productivity and prosperity. Despite this, the city's influence on global popular culture excelled and by the end of the century, the continuing process of urban renewal paved the way for the redefined modern city of the 21st century. The period after the Great War was marked by social unrest, as society grappled with the massive war losses of young men, as well as trying to re-integrate veterans into civilian life and the economy. Unemployment and poor living standards greeted many ex-servicemen. Union organising and strikes took place in numerous locations, including a police strike in Liverpool among the City Police. Numerous colonial soldiers and sailors from Africa and India, who had served with the British Armed Forces, settled in Liverpool and other port cities. In June 1919, they were subject to attack by whites in racial riots; residents in the port included Swedish immigrants, and both groups had to compete with native people from Liverpool for jobs and housing. In this period, race riots also took place in other port cities.[50] The Housing Act 1919 resulted in mass council housing being built across Liverpool during the 1920s and 1930s. In the 1920s and 1930s, as much as 15% of the city's population (around 140,000 people) was relocated from the inner-city to new purpose built, lower density suburban housing estates, based on the belief that this would improve their standard of living, though the overall benefits have been contested.[51][52] Numerous private homes were also built during this era. During the Great Depression of the early 1930s, unemployment peaked at around 30% in the city. Liverpool was the site of Britain's first provincial airport, operating from 1930. During the Second World War, the critical strategic importance of Liverpool was recognised by both Hitler and Churchill. The city was heavily bombed by the Germans, suffering a blitz second only to London's.[53] The pivotal Battle of the Atlantic was planned, fought and won from Liverpool.[54] The Luftwaffe made 80 air raids on Merseyside, killing 2,500 people and causing damage to almost half the homes in the metropolitan area. Significant rebuilding followed the war, including massive housing estates and the Seaforth Dock, the largest dock project in Britain. Since 1952, Liverpool has been twinned with Cologne, Germany, a city which also suffered severe aerial bombing during the war. In the 1950s and 1960s, much of the immediate reconstruction that took place in the city centre proved to be deeply unpopular. The historic portions of the city that had survived German bombing suffered extensive destruction during urban renewal. It has been argued that the so-called \"Shankland Plan\" of the 1960s, named after the town planner Graeme Shankland, led to compromised town planning and vast road-building schemes that devastated and divided inner city neighbourhoods. Concrete brutalist architecture, compromised visions, botched projects and grand designs that were never realised became the subject of condemnation. Historian Raphael Samuel labelled Graeme Shankland \"the butcher of Liverpool\".[55][56][57][58] A significant West Indian black community has existed in the city since the first two decades of the 20th century. Like most British cities and industrialised towns, Liverpool became home to a significant number of Commonwealth immigrants, beginning after World War I with colonial soldiers and sailors who had served in the area. More immigrants arrived after World War II, mostly settling in older inner-city areas such as Toxteth, where housing was less expensive. The black population of Liverpool was recorded at 1.90% in 2011. In the 2021 Census, 5.2% described themselves as black African, Caribbean, mixed white and black African, mixed white and Caribbean or 'other black'.[59][60] In the 1960s, Liverpool was the centre of the \"Merseybeat\" sound, which became synonymous with the Beatles and fellow Liverpudlian rock bands. Influenced by American rhythm and blues and rock music, they also in turn strongly affected American music. The Beatles became internationally known in the early 1960s and performed around the world together; they were, and continue to be, the most commercially successful and musically influential band in popular history. Their co-founder, singer, and composer John Lennon was killed in New York City in 1980. Liverpool Airport was renamed after him in 2002, the first British airport to be named in honour of an individual.[61][62] Previously part of Lancashire, and a county borough from 1889, Liverpool became a metropolitan borough within the newly created metropolitan county of Merseyside, in 1974. From the mid-1970s onwards, Liverpool's docks and traditional manufacturing industries declined due to restructuring of shipping and heavy industry, causing massive losses of jobs. The advent of containerisation meant that the city's docks became largely obsolete, and dock workers were made unemployed. By the early 1980s, unemployment rates in Liverpool were among the highest in the UK,[63] standing at 17% by January 1982 although, this was about half the level of unemployment that had affected the city during the Great Depression some 50 years previously.[64] During this period, Liverpool became a hub of fierce left-wing opposition to the central government in London.[65] Liverpool in the 1980s has been labelled as Britain's 'shock city'. Once the acclaimed second city of the British Empire which rivalled the capital city in global significance, Liverpool had collapsed in to its 'nadir' at the depths of post-colonial, post-industrial Britain.[66][67] In the late 20th century, Liverpool's economy began to recover. The late 1980s saw the opening of a regenerated Albert Dock which proved to be a catalyst for further regeneration.[68] In the mid-1990s, the city enjoyed growth rates higher than the national average. At the end of the 20th century, Liverpool was concentrating on regeneration, a process that continues today. Ongoing regeneration combined with the hosting of internationally significant events has helped to re-purpose Liverpool as one of the most visited, tourist orientated, cities in the United Kingdom. City leaders are focussing on long-term strategies to grow the city's population and economy, while national government explores the continuous potential for devolution in the city. In 2002, Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh visited Liverpool to mark the Golden Jubilee. On speaking to an audience at Liverpool Town Hall, the Queen recognised Liverpool as \"one of the most distinctive and energetic parts of the United Kingdom\", and paid tribute to the city's \"major orchestras, world-class museums and galleries\". She also acknowledged Liverpool's bid to become the European Capital of Culture.[69][70] To celebrate the Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II in 2002, the conservation charity Plantlife organised a competition to choose county flowers; the sea-holly was Liverpool's final choice. The initiative was designed to highlight growing threats to the UK's flower species and also ask the public about which flowers best represented their county.[71] Capitalising on the popularity of 1960s rock groups, such as the Beatles, as well as the city's world-class art galleries, museums and landmarks, tourism and culture have become a significant factor in Liverpool's economy. In 2004, property developer Grosvenor started the Paradise Project, a £920 million development based on Paradise Street. This produced one of the most significant changes to Liverpool's city centre since the post-war reconstruction. Renamed as 'Liverpool One,' the centre opened in May 2008. In 2007, events and celebrations took place in honour of the 800th anniversary of the founding of the borough of Liverpool. Liverpool was designated as a joint European Capital of Culture for 2008. The celebrations included the erection of La Princesse, a large mechanical spider 20 metres high and weighing 37 tonnes, which represented the \"eight legs\" of Liverpool: honour, history, music, the Mersey, the ports, governance, sunshine and culture. La Princesse roamed the streets of the city during the festivities, and concluded by entering the Queensway Tunnel. Spearheaded by the multi-billion-pound Liverpool ONE development, regeneration continued throughout the 2010s. Some of the most significant redevelopment projects included new buildings in the Commercial District, King's Dock, Mann Island, around Lime Street, the Baltic Triangle, RopeWalks, and Edge Lane.[72][73][74] Changes to Liverpool's governance took place in 2014. The local authority of Liverpool City Council decided to pool its power and resources with surrounding boroughs through the formation of the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority in a form of devolution. With a devolved budget granted by central government, the authority now oversees and invests in foremost strategic affairs throughout the Liverpool City Region, including major regeneration projects. The authority, along with Liverpool City Council itself, has embarked on long-term plans to grow the population and economy of the city.[75][76][77][78] By the 2020s, urban regeneration throughout the city continues. Liverpool Waters, a mixed-use development in the city's disused northern docklands, has been identified as one of the largest megaprojects in the UK's history. Everton's new stadium at Bramley-Moore Dock was regarded as the largest single-site private sector development in the United Kingdom at the time of construction.[79][80] Major events, business and political conferences regularly take place in the city and form an important part of the economy. In June 2014, Prime Minister David Cameron launched the International Festival for Business in Liverpool, the world's largest business event in 2014,[81] and the largest in the UK since the Festival of Britain in 1951.[82] The Labour Party has chosen Liverpool numerous times since the mid 2010s for their annual Labour Party Conference. Liverpool hosted the Eurovision Song Contest 2023. Liverpool has been a centre of invention and innovation. Railways, transatlantic steamships, municipal trams,[83] and electric trains were all pioneered in Liverpool as modes of mass transit. In 1829 and 1836, the first railway tunnels in the world were constructed under Liverpool (Wapping Tunnel). From 1950 to 1951, the world's first scheduled passenger helicopter service ran between Liverpool and Cardiff.[84] The first School for the Blind,[85] Mechanics' Institute,[86] High School for Girls,[87][88] council house,[89] and Juvenile Court[90] were all founded in Liverpool. Charities such as the RSPCA,[91] NSPCC,[92] Age Concern,[93] Relate, and Citizen's Advice Bureau[94] all evolved from work in the city. The first lifeboat station, public bath and wash-house,[95] sanitary act,[96] medical officer for health (William Henry Duncan), district nurse, slum clearance,[97] purpose-built ambulance,[98] X-ray medical diagnosis,[99] school of tropical medicine (Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine), motorised municipal fire-engine,[100] free school meal,[101] cancer research centre,[102] and zoonosis research centre[103] all originated in Liverpool. The first British Nobel Prize was awarded in 1902 to Ronald Ross, professor at the School of Tropical Medicine, the first school of its kind in the world.[104] Orthopaedic surgery was pioneered in Liverpool by Hugh Owen Thomas,[105] and modern medical anaesthetics by Thomas Cecil Gray. The world's first integrated sewer system was constructed in Liverpool by James Newlands, appointed in 1847 as the UK's first borough engineer.[106][107] Liverpool also founded the UK's first Underwriters' Association[108] and the first Institute of Accountants. The Western world's first financial derivatives (cotton futures) were traded on the Liverpool Cotton Exchange in the late 1700s.[109] In the arts, Liverpool was home to the first lending library (The Lyceum), athenaeum society (Liverpool Athenaeum), arts centre (Bluecoat Chambers),[110] and public art conservation centre (National Conservation Centre).[111] It is also home to the UK's oldest surviving classical orchestra (Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra)[112] and repertory theatre (Liverpool Playhouse).[113] In 1864, Peter Ellis built the world's first iron-framed, curtain-walled office building, Oriel Chambers, which was a prototype of the skyscraper. The UK's first purpose-built department store was Compton House, completed in 1867 for the retailer J.R. Jeffrey.[114] It was the largest store in the world at the time.[115] Between 1862 and 1867, Liverpool held an annual Grand Olympic Festival. Devised by John Hulley and Charles Pierre Melly, these games were the first to be wholly amateur in nature and international in outlook.[116][117] The programme of the first modern Olympiad in Athens in 1896 was almost identical to that of the Liverpool Olympics.[118] In 1865, Hulley co-founded the National Olympian Association in Liverpool, a forerunner of the British Olympic Association. Its articles of foundation provided the framework for the Olympic Charter. A concept devised by retail entrepreneur David Lewis, the first Christmas grotto opened in Lewis's department store in Liverpool in 1879.[119] Sir Alfred Lewis Jones, a shipowner, introduced bananas to the UK via Liverpool's docks in 1884.[120] The Mersey Railway, opened in 1886, incorporated the world's first tunnel under a tidal estuary[121] and the world's first deep-level underground stations (Liverpool James Street railway station). In 1889, borough engineer John Alexander Brodie invented the football goal net. He was also a pioneer in the use of pre-fabricated housing[123] and oversaw the construction of the UK's first ring road (A5058) and intercity highway (East Lancashire Road), as well as the Queensway Tunnel linking Liverpool and Birkenhead. Described as \"the eighth wonder of the world\" at the time of its construction, it was the longest underwater tunnel in the world for 24 years. In 1897, the Lumière brothers filmed Liverpool,[124] including what is believed to be the world's first tracking shot,[125] taken from the Liverpool Overhead Railway, the world's first elevated electrified railway. The Overhead Railway was the first railway in the world to use electric multiple units, employ automatic signalling, and install an escalator. Liverpool inventor Frank Hornby was a visionary in toy development and manufacture, producing three of the most popular lines of toys in the 20th century: Meccano, Hornby Model Railways (both in 1901), and Dinky Toys in 1934.[126] The British Interplanetary Society, founded in Liverpool in 1933 by Phillip Ellaby Cleator, is the world's oldest existing organisation devoted to the promotion of spaceflight. Its journal, the Journal of the British Interplanetary Society, is the longest-running astronautical publication in the world.[127] In 1999, Liverpool was the first city outside London to be awarded blue plaques by English Heritage in recognition of the \"significant contribution made by its sons and daughters in all walks of life\".[128] For the purposes of local government, Liverpool is classified as a metropolitan borough with city status. The metropolitan borough is located within both the county of Merseyside and the Liverpool City Region. Each of these geographical areas is treated as an administrative area with different levels of local governance applying to each. Liverpool City Council is the governing body solely for the Metropolitan Borough of Liverpool and performs functions that are standard of an English Unitary Authority. The Liverpool City Region Combined Authority and the Mayor of the Liverpool City Region reserve major strategic powers over such things as transport, economic development and regeneration for the city along with the 5 surrounding boroughs of the Liverpool City Region. The Combined Authority has competency over areas which have been devolved by national government and are specific to the city region.[129] Nevertheless, there are a few exceptions to local governance apart from these two structures. Liverpool was administered by Merseyside County Council between 1974 and 1986 and some residual aspects of organisation which date back to this time have survived. When the County Council was disbanded in 1986, most civic functions were transferred to Liverpool City Council. However, several authorities such as the police and fire and rescue service, continue to be run at a county-wide level. The county of Merseyside, therefore, continues to exist as an administrative area for a few limited services only, while the capability and capacity of the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority is evolving over time.[130] The city also elects five members of Parliament (MPs) to the Westminster Parliament, all Labour as of the 2024 general election. Liverpool City Council operates under a constitution comprising 85 city councillors who are directly elected by the Liverpool electorate every 4 years and represent a variety of different political parties. The city councillors make decisions about local services for the city's people. At each election, the political party that wins the majority of the 85 council seats leads the council for the following 4 years. The local leader of this party assumes the role of Leader of the City Council who then chairs a Cabinet of 9 councillors who are assigned specific responsibilities known as 'portfolios'. The incumbent Leader of Liverpool City Council is Councillor Liam Robinson, who represents the Labour Party, which secured a large majority at the 2023 local election,[132] the Leader is also a member of the Mayor of the Liverpool City Regions cabinet (Separate from the City Council Cabinet), at present Robinson holds the portfolio of Cabinet Member for Innovation. The City Council's decisions and scrutiny of activities are undertaken by a number of different committees and panels which include the Overview and Scrutiny Committees, Scrutiny Panels, Regulatory Committees and other committees. The day-to-day management of the council is carried out by the management team which includes the Chief Executive and several directors and senior officers. The management team works with the Cabinet and councillors to deliver strategic direction and priorities such as the budget and the City Plan.[133][134] Every four years, the city elects 85 councillors from 64 local council wards.[135] During the 2023 Liverpool City Council election, the Labour Party consolidated its control of Liverpool City Council, following on from the previous elections. Out of the total 85 City Council seats up for election, The Labour Party won 61 seats (53.13% of the electorate's total votes), the Liberal Democrats won 15 seats (21.61% of the votes), the Green Party won 3 seats (9.76% of the votes), the Liverpool Community Independents won 3 seats (4.64% of the votes) and the Liberal Party won the remaining 3 seats (3.21% of the votes). The Conservative Party, the political party in power at national government, had no representation on Liverpool City Council. Only 27.27% of the eligible Liverpool electorate turned out to vote.[136] Throughout most of the 19th and early 20th centuries, Liverpool was a municipal stronghold of Toryism. However, support for the Conservative Party in recent times has been among the lowest in any part of Britain, particularly since the monetarist economic policies of former prime minister Margaret Thatcher. After the 1979 general election, many have claimed that her victory contributed to longstanding high unemployment and decline in the city.[137] Liverpool is one of the Labour Party's key strongholds; however, the city has also seen hard times under Labour governments. Particularly in the Winter of Discontent (late 1978 and early 1979) when Liverpool suffered public sector strikes along with the rest of the United Kingdom, but also when it suffered the particularly humiliating misfortune of having grave-diggers going on strike, leaving the dead unburied for long periods.[138] In recent years, Liverpool City Council began an extensive improvement program designed to ensure that the authority makes efficient use of taxpayer's money and to encourage more business and investment in the city. Grosvenor Group, the property company responsible for Liverpool One, commended the changes as an \"opportunity for bold thinking in liverpool\".[139] In 2021, a highly critical government inspection and subsequent report of Liverpool City Council (referred to as the Caller report) identified multiple shortcomings at Liverpool City Council. The Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government, Robert Jenrick sent government commissioners to oversee the City Council's highways, regeneration, property management, governance and financial decision-making. The authority was compelled to commit to a three-year improvement plan in which the entire structure of the council would be overhauled. As a result of the intervention, major structural changes at the City Council took place by the 2023 United Kingdom local elections, which were labelled \"the most unpredictable [elections] in the city's history\". The number of electoral wards in the city was doubled from 30 to 64, while the overall number of City Councillors up for election was reduced from 90 to 85. In future, the council would also change to 'all out' elections every four years whereby every single City Councillor would be eligible for re-election at the same time. The role of elected city mayor was also abolished and the Council reverted to the previous Leader and Cabinet style of leadership. The outcome of the elections were seen not only as a test of how the general public would respond to the government intervention in the city, but also to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's government as a whole.[140][141][142][143] Councillor Liam Robinson became the new Leader of Liverpool City Council at the 2023 City Council election. The Liverpool Strategic Futures Advisory Panel, chaired by the Mayor of Liverpool City Region Steve Rotheram, and including several high-profile figures with experience in local government, was established. The panel was tasked with directing the council's long-term future outside of government intervention measures and to advise on plans and priorities that the city should pursue.[144] In February 2008, Liverpool City Council was reported to be the worst-performing council in the country, receiving just a one-star rating (classified as inadequate). The main cause of the poor rating was attributed to the council's poor handling of tax-payer money, including the accumulation of a £20m shortfall while the city held the title of European Capital of Culture.[145] In April 2024, the Office for Local Government released a ranking of local authorities, placing Liverpool City Council 317th out of a possible 318.[146] The Lord Mayor of Liverpool is an ancient ceremonial role. Councillors within Liverpool City Council (not the general public) elect the Lord Mayor annually, who then serves a one-year term. The Lord Mayor is styled as the \"first citizen\" and is chosen to represent the city at civic functions and engagements, promote it to the wider world, support local charities and community groups, attend religious events, meet delegates from Liverpool's twin cities, chair council meetings and confer Honorary Freemen and associations.[147] The Lord Mayor is also the presiding officer for Liverpool City Council full meetings. . Liverpool is one of the six constituent boroughs of the Liverpool City Region. The Mayor of the Liverpool City Region is directly every four years by residents of those six boroughs and oversees the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority. The Combined Authority is the top-tier administrative body for the local governance of the city region and is tasked with taking major strategic decisions on issues such as transport and investment, economic development, employment and skills, tourism, culture, housing and physical infrastructure. The current Mayor is Steve Rotheram. Liverpool is included within five parliamentary constituencies, through which MPs are elected to represent the city in Westminster: Liverpool Riverside, Liverpool Walton, Liverpool Wavertree, Liverpool West Derby and Garston and Halewood.[148] At the last general election, all were won by Labour with representation being from Kim Johnson, Dan Carden, Paula Barker and Ian Byrne respectively.[149] Due to boundary changes prior to the 2010 election, the Liverpool Garston constituency was merged with most of Knowsley South to form the Garston and Halewood cross-boundary seat. At the most recent 2024 election, this seat was won by Maria Eagle of the Labour Party.[149] Liverpool has been described as having \"the most splendid setting of any English city.\"[150] At 53°24′0″N 2°59′0″W﻿ / ﻿53.40000°N 2.98333°W﻿ / 53.40000; -2.98333 (53.4, −2.98), 176 miles (283 kilometres) northwest of London, located on the Liverpool Bay of the Irish Sea, Liverpool is built across a ridge of sandstone hills rising up to a height of around 230 feet (70 m) above sea-level at Everton Hill, which represents the southern boundary of the West Lancashire Coastal Plain. The Mersey Estuary separates Liverpool from the Wirral Peninsula. The boundaries of Liverpool are adjacent to Bootle, Crosby and Maghull in south Sefton to the north, and Kirkby, Huyton, Prescot and Halewood in Knowsley to the east. Liverpool experiences a temperate maritime climate (Köppen: Cfb), like much of the British Isles, with relatively mild summers, cool winters and rainfall spread fairly evenly throughout the year. Rainfall and temperature records had been kept at Bidston Hill since 1867, but records for atmospheric pressure go back as far as at least 1846.[151] Bidston closed down in 2002 but the Met Office also has a weather station at Crosby. Since records began in 1867, temperatures have ranged from −17.6 °C (0.3 °F) on 21 December 2010 to 34.5 °C (94.1 °F) on 2 August 1990, although Liverpool Airport recorded a temperature of 35.0 °C (95.0 °F) on 19 July 2006.[152] The lowest amount of sunshine on record was 16.5 hours in December 1927 whereas the most was 314.5 hours in July 2013.[153][154] Tornado activity or funnel cloud formation is very rare in and around the Liverpool area and tornadoes that do form are usually weak. Recent tornadoes or funnel clouds in Merseyside have been seen in 1998 and 2014.[155][156] During the period 1981–2010, Crosby recorded an average of 32.8 days of air frost per year, which is low for the United Kingdom.[157] Snow is fairly common during the winter although heavy snow is rare. Snow generally falls between November and March but can occasionally fall earlier and later. In recent times, the earliest snowfall was on 1 October 2008[158] while the latest occurred on 15 May 2012.[159] Although historically, the earliest snowfall occurred on 10 September 1908[160] and the latest on 2 June 1975.[161] Rainfall, although light, is quite a common occurrence in Liverpool, with the wettest month on record being August 1956, which recorded 221.2 mm (8.71 in) of rain and the driest being February 1932, with 0.9 mm (0.035 in).[162] The driest year on record was 1991, with 480.5 mm (18.92 in) of rainfall and the wettest was 1872, with 1,159.9 mm (45.67 in).[163] Suburbs and districts of Liverpool include: In 2010, Liverpool City Council and the Primary Care Trust commissioned the Mersey Forest to complete \"A Green Infrastructure Strategy\" for the city.[172] Liverpool is a core urban element of a green belt region that extends into the wider surrounding counties, which is in place to reduce urban sprawl, prevent the towns in the conurbation from further convergence, protect the identity of outlying communities, encourage brownfield reuse, and preserve nearby countryside. This is achieved by restricting inappropriate development within the designated areas and imposing stricter conditions on permitted building.[173] Due to being already highly built up, the city contains limited portions of protected green belt area within greenfield throughout the borough at Fazakerley, Croxteth Hall and country park and Craven Wood, Woodfields Park and nearby golf courses in Netherley, small greenfield tracts east of the Speke area by the St Ambrose primary school, and the small hamlet of Oglet and the surrounding area south of Liverpool Airport.[174] The green belt was first drawn up in 1983 under Merseyside County Council[175] and the size in the city amounts to 530 hectares (5.3 km2; 2.0 sq mi).[176] Since the mid-20th century, Scouser has become the predominant demonym for the inhabitants of Liverpool, and is strongly associated with the Scouse accent and dialect of the city.[177] The Scouse accent is described as progressively diverging from the Lancastrian accent in the late 19th century.[178][179][180][181][182] The etymology of Scouser is derived from the traditional dish Scouse brought to the area by sailors travelling through Liverpool's port.[183][182][184] Prior to the establishment of Scouser as there have been a number of different terms used to refer to inhabitants of Liverpool of varying popularity and longevity: Professor Tony Crowley argues that up until the 1950s, inhabitants of Liverpool were generally referred to by a number of demonyms. He argues that there was a debate in the mid 20th century between the two rival terms of 'Liverpolitan' and 'Liverpudlian'. The debate surrounded the lexicology of these terms and their connotations of social class.[184][188] Professor John Belchem suggests that a series of other nicknames such as 'Dick Liver', 'Dicky Sam' and 'whacker' were used, but gradually fell out of use. Belchem and Philip Boland suggest that comedic radio presenters and entertainers brought the Liverpool identity to a national audience, which in turn encouraged locals to be gradually more known as 'scousers'. By the time that Frank Shaw's My Liverpool, a Celebration of 'Scousetown' was published in 1971, Belchem argues that 'Scouser' had firmly become the dominant demonym.[177][189][190] The city of Liverpool is at the core of a much larger and more populous metropolitan area, however, at the most recent UK Census in 2021, the area governed by Liverpool City Council had a population of 486,100, a 4.2% increase from the previous Census in 2011. This figure increased to 500,500 people by 2022, according to data from Liverpool City Council. Taking in to account how local government is organised within the cities and metropolitan areas of England, the Liverpool was the fifth largest of England's 'core cities' and had the second overall highest population density of those, by 2021.[202][203] The population of the city has steadily risen since the 2001 Census. As well as having a growing population, the population density also grew at the 2021 Census compared to the previous Census. Since 2011, its population size ranked 10th out of 309 local authority areas.[204] The population of the city is comparatively younger than that of England as a whole. Family life in the city is also growing at odds with the North West England region as a whole: At the 2021 Census, the percentage of households including a couple without children increased in Liverpool, but fell across the North West. The percentage of people aged 16 years and over (excluding full-time students) who were employed also increased in Liverpool compared to the overall North West region where it fell. The 2021 Census also showed that Liverpool's ethnic and international population was growing. The number of residents in the city born outside of England has increased since the previous Census, while the number of residents who did not identify with any national identity associated with the UK has also increased at a faster rate than England as a whole. The overall share of the city's population who identified as Asian and Black increased, while the percentage who identified as white decreased in the city compared with previous Census.[205] It has been argued that the city can claim to have one of the strongest Irish heritages in the United Kingdom, with as many as 75 percent (estimated) of Liverpool's population with some form of Irish ancestry.[206] The growing population of Liverpool in the 21st century reverses a trend which took place between the 1930s and 2001, when the population of the city proper effectively halved. At the 1931 United Kingdom census, Liverpool's population reached an all-time high of 846,302. Following this peak, in response to central government policy, the Council authority of Liverpool then built and owned large several 'new town' council estates in the suburbs within Liverpool's metropolitan area. Tens of thousands of people were systematically relocated to new housing in areas such as Halton, Knowsley, St Helens, Sefton, Wirral, Cheshire West and Chester, West Lancashire, Warrington and as far as North Wales. Such a mass relocation and population loss during this time was common practice for many British cities, including London and Manchester, In contrast, satellite towns such as Kirkby, Skelmersdale and Runcorn saw a corresponding rise in their populations (Kirkby being the fastest growing town in Britain during the 1960s).[207][208][205][209] Liverpool is typically grouped with the wider Merseyside (plus Halton) area for the purpose of defining its metropolitan footprint, and there are several methodologies. Sometimes, this metropolitan area is broadened to encompass urban settlements in the neighbouring counties of Lancashire and Cheshire.[210][211] The Office for National Statistics in the United Kingdom uses the international standardised International Territorial Levels (ITLs) to divide up the economic territory of the UK. This enables the ONS to calculate regional and local statistics and data. The ONS uses a series of codes to identify these areas. In order of hierarchy from largest area to smallest area, Liverpool is part of the following regions:[212][213][214] North West England (code TLD) At the 2021 Census, the ITL 1 region of North West England had a usual resident population of 7,417,300.[215] Merseyside (code TLD7) The ITL 2 region of Merseyside is defined as the area comprising East Merseyside (TLD71) plus Liverpool (TLD72), Sefton (TLD73) and Wirral (TLD74). At the 2021 Census, the population of this area was as follows:[216] East Merseyside (TLD71): Liverpool (TLD72) = 486,100 Sefton (TLD73) = 279,300 Wirral (TLD74) = 320,200 Therefore, the total population of the ITL 2 Merseyside region was 1,551,500 based on the 2021 Census. The smallest ITL 3 area classed as Liverpool (code TLD72), therefore, had a population of 486,100 at the 2021 Census. At the 2021 Census, the ONS used a refreshed concept of built-up areas (BUAs) based on the physical built environment, using satellite imagery to recognise developed land, such as cities, towns, and villages. This allows the ONS to investigate economic and social statistics based on actual settlements where most people live. Data from the 2021 Census is not directly comparable with 2011 Census data due to this revised methodology. Using the population figures of BUAs at the 2021 Census (excluding London), Liverpool Built-up Area is the third largest in England with some 506,565 usual residents (behind only Birmingham and Leeds). Liverpool's built-up area is, therefore, larger than the major English cities of Bristol, Manchester, Newcastle upon Tyne, Nottingham and Sheffield.[217] Excluding London, the Liverpool City Region was the 4th largest combined authority area in England, by 2021. The population is approximately 1.6 million. The Liverpool City Region is a political and economic partnership between local authorities including Liverpool, plus the Metropolitan boroughs of Knowsley, Sefton, St Helens, Wirral and the Borough of Halton. The Liverpool City Region Combined Authority exercises strategic governance powers for the region in many areas. The economic data of the Liverpool city region is of particular policy interest to the Office for National Statistics, particularly as the British Government continuously explores the potential to negotiate increased devolved powers for each combined authority area.[218][219][220][221] A 2011 report, Liverpool City Region – Building on its Strengths, by Lord Heseltine and Terry Leahy, stated that \"what is now called Liverpool City Region has a population of around 1.5 million\", but also referred to \"an urban region that spreads from Wrexham and Flintshire to Chester, Warrington, West Lancashire and across to Southport\", with a population of 2.3 million.[222] In 2006, in an attempt to harmonise the series of metropolitan areas across the European Union, ESPON (now European Observation Network for Territorial Development and Cohesion) released a study defining a \"Liverpool/Birkenhead Metropolitan area\" with an estimated population of 2,241,000 people. The metro area comprised a functional urban area consisting of a contiguous urban sprawl, labour pool, and commuter Travel to work areas. The analysis defined this metropolitan area as Liverpool itself, combined with the surrounding areas of Birkenhead, Wigan/Ashton, Warrington, Widnes/Runcorn, Chester, Southport, Ellesmere Port, Ormskirk and Skelmersdale.[6] Liverpool and Manchester are sometimes considered as one large polynuclear metropolitan area,[223][224][225] or megalopolis. In recent decades, Liverpool's population is becoming more multicultural. According to the 2021 census, 77% of all Liverpool residents described their ethnic group as White English, Welsh, Scottish, Northern Irish or British. The remaining 23% were described as non-White English/British. Between 2011 and 2021, there was population growth across all ethnic groups, except 'White English/British' and 'Any Other', where there were overall losses. The number of 'Other White residents' in Liverpool also increased by almost 12,000 people, with notable increases in the 'Other Asian', 'Arab', and 'Other Mixed/Multiple' population categories. The non-White English/British population as a percentage of the total population across the 'newly organised city electoral wards' ranged from 5% in the Orrell Park ward to 69% in the Princes Park ward. 9 out of 10 Liverpool residents regarded English as their main language. The highest non-English languages in the city were Arabic (5,743 main speakers) followed by Polish (4,809 main speakers). Overall, almost 45,000 residents had a main language that was not English.[226] According to a 2014 survey, the ten most popular surnames of Liverpool and their occurrence in the population are:[228][229] Liverpool is home to Britain's oldest Black community, dating to at least the 1730s. Some Liverpudlians can trace their black ancestry in the city back ten generations.[230] Early Black settlers in the city included seamen, the children of traders sent to be educated, and freed slaves, since slaves entering the country after 1722 were deemed free men.[231] Since the 20th century, Liverpool is also noted for its large African-Caribbean,[4] Ghanaian,[232] and Somali[233] communities, formed of more recent African-descended immigrants and their subsequent generations. The city is also home to the oldest Chinese community in Europe; the first residents of the city's Chinatown arrived as seamen in the 19th century.[234] The traditional Chinese gateway erected in Liverpool's Chinatown is the largest such gateway outside China. Liverpool also has a long-standing Filipino community. Lita Roza, a singer from Liverpool who was the first woman to achieve a UK number one hit, had Filipino ancestry. The city is also known for its large Irish and Welsh populations.[235] In 1813, 10 per cent of Liverpool's population was Welsh, leading to the city becoming known as \"the capital of North Wales.\"[235] During, and in the decades following, the Great Irish Famine in the mid-19th century, up to two million Irish people travelled to Liverpool within one decade, with many subsequently departing for the United States.[236] By 1851, more than 20 per cent of the population of Liverpool was Irish.[237] At the 2001 Census, 1.17 per cent of the population were Welsh-born and 0.75 per cent were born in the Republic of Ireland, while 0.54 per cent were born in Northern Ireland,[238] but many more Liverpudlians are of legacy Welsh or Irish ancestry.[239] Other contemporary ethnicities include Indian,[4] Latin American,[240] Malaysian,[241] and Yemeni[242] communities, which number several thousand each. The thousands of migrants and sailors passing through Liverpool resulted in a religious diversity that is still apparent today. This is reflected in the equally diverse collection of religious buildings,[244] including two Christian cathedrals. Liverpool is known to be England's 'most Catholic city', with a Catholic population much larger than in other parts of England.[245] This is mainly due to high historic Irish migration to the city and their descendants since.[246] The parish church of Liverpool is the Anglican Our Lady and St Nicholas, colloquially known as \"the sailors church\", which has existed near the waterfront since 1257. It regularly plays host to Catholic masses. Other notable churches include the Greek Orthodox Church of St Nicholas (built in the Neo-Byzantine architecture style), and the Gustav Adolf Church (the Swedish Seamen's Church, reminiscent of Nordic styles). Liverpool's wealth as a port city enabled the construction of two enormous cathedrals in the 20th century. The Anglican Cathedral, which was designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott and plays host to the annual Liverpool Shakespeare Festival, has one of the longest naves, largest organs and heaviest and highest peals of bells in the world. The Roman Catholic Metropolitan Cathedral, on Mount Pleasant next to Liverpool Science Park, was initially planned to be even larger. Of Sir Edwin Lutyens's original design, only the crypt was completed. The cathedral was eventually built to a simpler design by Sir Frederick Gibberd. While this is on a smaller scale than Lutyens' original design, it still incorporates the largest panel of stained glass in the world. The road running between the two cathedrals is called Hope Street. The cathedral has long been colloquially referred to as \"Paddy's Wigwam\" due to its shape.[247] Liverpool contains several synagogues, of which the Grade I listed Moorish Revival Princes Road Synagogue is architecturally the most notable. Princes Road is widely considered to be the most magnificent of Britain's Moorish Revival synagogues and one of the finest buildings in Liverpool.[248] Liverpool has a thriving Jewish community with a further two orthodox Synagogues, one in the Allerton district of the city and a second in the Childwall district of the city where a significant Jewish community reside. A third orthodox Synagogue in the Greenbank Park area of L17 has recently closed and is a listed 1930s structure. There is also a Lubavitch Chabad House and a reform Synagogue. Liverpool has had a Jewish community since the mid-18th century. The Jewish population of Liverpool is around 5,000.[249] The Liverpool Talmudical College existed from 1914 until 1990, when its classes moved to the Childwall Synagogue.[citation needed] Liverpool also has a Hindu community, with a Mandir on Edge Lane, Edge Hill. The Shri Radha Krishna Temple from the Hindu Cultural Organisation in Liverpool is located there.[250] Liverpool also has the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Wavertree[251] and a Baháʼí Centre in the same area.[252] The city had the earliest Mosque in England and possibly the UK, founded in 1887 by William Abdullah Quilliam, a lawyer who had converted to Islam who set up the Liverpool Muslim Institute in a terraced house on West Derby Road.[253] Apart from the first mosque in England which now houses a museum,[254][255] the largest and main one, Al-Rahma mosque, was also the third purpose-built mosque in the United Kingdom.[256] The second largest mosque in Liverpool is the Masjid Al-Taiseer.[257] Other mosques in the city include the Bait ul Lateef Ahmadiyya Mosque,[258] Hamza Center (Community Center),[259] Islamic community centre,[260] Liverpool Mosque and Islamic Institute,[261] Liverpool Towhid Centre,[262] Masjid Annour,[263] and the Shah Jalal Mosque.[264] Liverpool forms an integral part of North West England's economy, the third largest regional economy in the United Kingdom. The city is also a major contributor to the economy of Liverpool City Region, worth over £40 billion per year.[268][269][270] The local authority area governed by Liverpool City Council accounts for 39% of the Liverpool city region's total jobs, 40% of its total GVA and 35% of its total businesses. At the local authority level, the city's GVA (balanced) at current basic prices was £14.3 billion in 2021. Its GDP at current market prices was £15.9 billion. This equates to £32,841 per head of the population.[271][272] At the 2021 United Kingdom census, 51.1% of Liverpool's population aged 16 years and over was classed as employed, 44.2% economically inactive and 4.8% unemployed. Of those employed, the most popular industries providing the employment were human health and social work activities (18.7%), wholesale and retail trade; repair of motor vehicles and motor cycles (15%), education (10.8%), public administration and defence; compulsory social security (7.3%), accommodation and food service activities (6.8%), construction (6.5%), transport and storage (5.8%), manufacturing (5.5%) and professional, scientific and technical activities (5.2%).[273] According to the ONS Business Register and Employment Survey 2021, some industries within Liverpool perform strongly compared to other local authorities in Great Britain. In terms of absolute number of jobs per industry in Great Britain's local authority areas, Liverpool features in the national top 10 for human health and social work activities; arts, entertainment and recreation; public administration and defence; compulsory social security; accommodation and food service activities and real estate activities. Liverpool features in the national top 20 for number of jobs in education; construction; wholesale and retail trade; repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles; transportation and storage; financial and insurance activities and professional, scientific and technical activities.[274] In 2023, Liverpool City Council set out an economic growth plan for the city over the following 20 years. The City Council will have particular focus on economic sectors such as the visitor economy (tourism), culture, life sciences, digital and creative sectors, and advanced car manufacturing.[275] According to the International passenger Survey, from the ONS, Liverpool was one of the top 5 most visited cities in the UK by overseas tourists in 2022. As of the same year, the city's tourist industry was worth a total of £3.5 billion annually and was part of a larger city region tourist industry worth £5 billion. A consistent calendar of major events, as well as a plethora of cultural attractions, continue to provide a significant draw for tourists. Tourism related to the Beatles is worth an estimated £100m to the Liverpool economy each year alone. Liverpool One, as well as a growing retail offer overall, has led to the city being one of the most prominent destinations for shopping in the UK. Liverpool Cruise Terminal, which is situated close to the Pier Head, enables tourists to berth in the centre of the city.[276][277][278][279][280][281][282] Liverpool is home to the Knowledge Quarter, a 450-acre city centre district that hosts some of the world's most influential institutions in science, health, technology, education, music and the creative performing arts. The UK government has also identified the city as a 'pharmaceutical production superpower' and one of the UK's leading regions for bioprocessing. The accolade led to the government choosing the city for England's second ever 'Investment Zone' in 2023. This will involve millions of pounds being invested over the coming years in to science orientated districts including the Knowledge Quarter and the so-called 'pharma cluster' in the city suburb of Speke. The two clusters form an internationally significant role in infectious disease control. Liverpool City Council also plan to invest in the city's Baltic Triangle, which is renowned in the creative and digital industries.[283][284][285][286][287][288] Car manufacturing also takes place in the city at the Jaguar Land Rover Halewood plant, where the Range Rover Evoque model is assembled. In 2023, Jaguar Land Rover announced that the Halewood plant would begin to shift its focus to electric car production.[289][290] Historically, the economy of Liverpool was centred on the city's port and manufacturing base. Today, the Port of Liverpool is the UK's fourth largest port by tonnage of freight, handling over 30 million tonnes in 2020. The city is also the UK's largest port for transatlantic trade, handling 45% of the country's trade from the United States. In 2023, the city was chosen by the British government to be a designated Freeport to encourage growing international commerce. The Liverpool2 container terminal, completed in 2022, has greatly increased the volume of cargo which Liverpool is able to handle and has facilitated the world's biggest container vessels.[291][292][293][294][295][296][297] Liverpool is also home to numerous UK headquarters, or the major strategic branch offices, of many shipping and freight lines including: Atlantic Container Line,[298] Bibby Line,[299] Borchard Lines Ltd,[300] CMA CGM,[301] Hapag-Lloyd,[302] Independent Container Line,[303] Irish Ferries,[304] Maersk Line,[305] Mediterranean Shipping Company[306] and Zim Integrated Shipping Services.[307] Liverpool's rich architectural base has helped the city become the second most filmed city in the UK outside London. As well as being a featured location in its own right, it often doubles up for Chicago, London, Moscow, New York City, Paris and Rome. The Depot studios, close to the city centre, provide space for film and TV productions.[308][309] Major economic projects planned for the city include the revitalisation of disused land in the North docks/Ten Streets area, Liverpool Waters and a new purpose built TV studio at the former Littlewoods Pools building, adjacent to the Depot.[310][311][312] The Liverpool City Region GDP in 2021 was £40.479 billion. The 6 contributing boroughs to this GDP were as follows:[313] The policy agenda of the British Government is to continuously monitor the economy and productivity of the UK's core cities within the context of their respective city regions. The government's longer-term plan is to assess each area's potential for increased devolution and transfer of additional powers and budgets from central government in Whitehall to their corresponding combined authorities. As such, official statistics about Liverpool's economy within the context of the Liverpool City Region, are closely monitored by the Office for National Statistics. This allows policy and decision makers to more accurately assess the 'functional economic area' of the city, which is not bound by traditional local government geographies.[314][315][316][317][318] As of 2023, there are 10 city regions in England with Combined Authorities. The economy of Liverpool's combined authority area in comparison to the other city regions is as follows: Liverpool's long commercial history has given rise to a considerable variety of architectural styles found within the city, ranging from 16th century Tudor buildings to modern-day contemporary architecture.[320] The majority of buildings in the city date from the late-18th century onwards, the period during which the city grew into one of the foremost powers in the British Empire.[321] There are over 2,500 listed buildings in Liverpool, of which 27 are Grade I listed[322] and 85 are Grade II* listed.[323] The city also has a greater number of public sculptures than any other location in the United Kingdom aside from Westminster and significant number of Georgian houses still exist.[324][325] This richness of architecture has subsequently seen Liverpool described by English Heritage, as England's finest Victorian city.[326] The value of Liverpool's architecture and design was recognised in 2004, when several areas throughout the city were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Known as the Liverpool Maritime Mercantile City, the sites were added in recognition of the city's role in the development of international trade and docking technology.[327] However, this status was revoked in July 2021, when UNESCO resolved that recent and proposed developments, such as the Bramley-Moore Dock Stadium and Liverpool Waters projects, had resulted in the \"serious deterioration\" of the area's significance.[328] As a major British port, the docks in Liverpool have historically been central to the city's development. Several major docking firsts have occurred in the city including the construction of the world's first enclosed wet dock (the Old Dock) in 1715 and the first ever hydraulic lifting cranes.[329] The best-known dock in Liverpool is the Royal Albert Dock, which was constructed in 1846 and today comprises the largest single collection of Grade I listed buildings anywhere in Britain.[330] Built under the guidance of Jesse Hartley, it was considered to be one of the most advanced docks anywhere in the world upon completion and is often attributed with helping the city to become one of the most important ports in the world. Today, the Royal Albert Dock houses restaurants, bars, shops, two hotels as well as the Merseyside Maritime Museum, International Slavery Museum, Tate Liverpool and The Beatles Story. North of the city centre is Stanley Dock, home to the Stanley Dock Tobacco Warehouse, which was at the time of its construction in 1901, the world's largest building in terms of area[331] and today stands as the world's largest brick-work building.[332] One of the most famous locations in Liverpool is the Pier Head, renowned for the trio of buildings – the Royal Liver Building, the Cunard Building and the Port of Liverpool Building – which sit upon it. Collectively referred to as the Three Graces, these buildings stand as a testament to the great wealth in the city during the late 19th and early 20th century. Built in a variety of architectural styles, they are recognised as being the symbol of 'maritime Liverpool' and are regarded by many as contributing to one of the most impressive waterfronts in the world.[333][334][335][336] In the 21st century, several areas along Liverpool's waterfront have undergone significant redevelopment. Among the notable developments are the Museum of Liverpool, the construction of the Liverpool Arena, ACC Liverpool and Exhibition Centre Liverpool on King's Dock, Alexandra Tower and 1 Princes Dock on Prince's Dock and Liverpool Marina around Coburg and Brunswick Docks. The Wheel of Liverpool opened on 25 March 2010.[337][338] However, plans to redevelop parts of Liverpool city centre have been marred by controversy. In December 2016, a newly formed company called North Point Global Ltd. was given the rights to develop part of the docks under the \"New Chinatown\" working name. Though heavily advertised in Liverpool, Hong Kong and Chinese cities with high-profile advertisements and videos, the \"New Chinatown\" development failed to materialise.[339] In January 2018, the Liverpool Echo and Asia Times revealed that the site remained sans any construction. North Point Global as well as its subcontractor \"Bilt\" had both declared bankruptcy, and the small investors (mostly middle class couples) who had already paid money for the apartments had lost most of their savings in them.[340] Liverpool's historic position as one of the most important trading ports in the world has meant that over time many grand buildings have been constructed in the city as headquarters for shipping firms, insurance companies, banks and other large firms. The great wealth this brought then allowed for the development of grand civic buildings, which were designed to allow the local administrators to 'run the city with pride'.[341] The commercial district is centred on the Castle Street, Dale Street and Old Hall Street areas of the city, with many of the area's roads still following their medieval layout. Having developed predominantly over a period of three centuries, the area is regarded as one of the most important architectural locations in the city, as recognised by its inclusion in Liverpool's former World Heritage site.[342] The oldest building in the area is the Grade I listed Liverpool Town Hall, which is located at the top of Castle Street and dates from 1754. Often regarded as the city's finest piece of Georgian architecture, the building is known as one of the most extravagantly decorated civic buildings anywhere in Britain.[343][344] Also on Castle Street is the Grade I listed Bank of England Building, constructed between 1845 and 1848, as one of only three provincial branches of the national bank.[343] Among the other buildings in the area are the Tower Buildings, Albion House (the former White Star Line headquarters), the Municipal Buildings and Oriel Chambers,[345] which is considered to be one of the earliest Modernist style buildings ever built.[346] The area around William Brown Street is referred to as the city's 'Cultural Quarter', owing to the presence of numerous civic buildings, including the William Brown Library, Walker Art Gallery, Picton Reading Rooms and World Museum Liverpool. The area is dominated by neo-classical architecture, of which the most prominent, St George's Hall,[347] is widely regarded as the best example of a neo-classical building anywhere in Europe.[348] A Grade I listed building, it was constructed between 1840 and 1855 to serve a variety of civic functions in the city and its doors are inscribed with \"S.P.Q.L.\" (Latin senatus populusque Liverpudliensis), meaning \"the senate and people of Liverpool\". William Brown Street is also home to numerous public monuments and sculptures, including Wellington's Column and the Steble Fountain. Many others are located around the area, particularly in St John's Gardens, which was specifically developed for this purpose.[349] The William Brown Street area has been likened to a modern recreation of the Roman Forum.[350] While the majority of Liverpool's architecture dates from the mid-18th century onwards, there are several buildings that pre-date this time. One of the oldest surviving buildings is Speke Hall, a Tudor manor house located in the south of the city, which was completed in 1598.[351] The building is one of the few remaining timber framed Tudor houses left in the north of England and is particularly noted for its Victorian interiors, which were added in the mid-19th century.[352] In addition to Speke Hall, many of the city's other oldest surviving buildings are also former manor houses including Croxteth Hall and Woolton Hall, which were completed in 1702 and 1704 respectively.[353] The oldest building within the city centre is the Grade I listed Bluecoat Chambers,[354] which was built between 1717 and 1718. Constructed in British Queen Anne style architecture,[355][356] the building was influenced in part by the work of Christopher Wren[357] and was originally the home of the Bluecoat School (who later moved to a larger site in Wavertree in the south of the city). Since 1908, it has acted as a centre for arts in Liverpool.[355] Liverpool is noted for having two Cathedrals, each of which imposes over the landscape around it.[358] The Anglican Cathedral, which was constructed between 1904 and 1978, is the largest Cathedral in Britain[359] and the fifth largest in the world. Designed and built in Gothic style, it is regarded as one of the greatest buildings to have been constructed during the 20th century[360] and was described by former British Poet Laureate, John Betjeman, as \"one of the great buildings of the world\".[361] The Roman Catholic Metropolitan Cathedral was constructed between 1962 and 1967 and is known as one of the first cathedrals to break the traditional longitudinal design.[362] In the 21st century, many parts of Liverpool's city centre have undergone significant redevelopment and regeneration after years of decline. So far, the largest of these developments has been Liverpool One, which saw almost £1 billion invested in the redevelopment of 42 acres (17 hectares) of land, providing new retail, commercial, residential and leisure space.[363] Around the north of the city centre, several new skyscrapers have also been constructed including the RIBA award-winning Unity Buildings and West Tower, which at 140m is Liverpool's tallest building. Many redevelopment schemes are also in progress including Circus,[364] King's Dock,[365] Paddington Village[366] and Liverpool Waters.[367] There are many other notable buildings in Liverpool, including the art deco former terminal building of Speke Airport, the University of Liverpool's Victoria Building, (which provided the inspiration for the term Red Brick University), and the Adelphi Hotel, which was in the past considered to be one of the finest hotels anywhere in the world.[368] The Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in England describes Merseyside's Victorian Parks as collectively the \"most important in the country\".[369] Liverpool has ten listed parks and cemeteries, including two Grade I and five Grade II*, more than any other English city apart from London.[370] Liverpool has an extensive transport infrastructure that connects the city with its metropolitan area, the rest of the United Kingdom, Europe and the world. Various modes of transport provide considerable connections by road, rail, air and sea. The local network of buses, trains and ferries is managed by Merseytravel on behalf of the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority and the Metro Mayor of the Liverpool City Region. The Mayor and Combined Authority have control of a devolved transport budget and associated transport powers for this local system. The city's major port and international airport provide global links for both passengers and freight.[371][372] The city sits at the centre of a much larger metropolitan area. The city's suburbs run contiguously into the neighbouring boroughs defined by the ONS as the Liverpool Built-up Area. The wider City Region and Merseyside in general is densely urbanised and divided by several motorways and major roads. The city is served by a network motorways. The three motorways in closest proximity are the M58 to the north, and M62 and M57 to the east. To the north, the M58 motorway runs 12 miles and provides links to the neighbouring counties of Lancashire and Greater Manchester, finally joining with the M6 west of Wigan.[373] To the east, the M62 runs across the north of the UK, ultimately connecting Liverpool with Hull on the opposite coast, and along the route to several large cities including Manchester, Leeds and Bradford. The M62 also provides a connection to both the M6 and M1 motorways, providing indirect links to more distant areas including Birmingham, London, Nottingham, Preston and Sheffield.[374][375] To the east, but running north-south, the M57 acts as a 10-mile ring road for the city itself and links the M62 and M58 motorways, as well as the A580 East Lancashire Road providing a link directly to the A5300 that links to the bridges that cross the Mersey to the south of the city.[376] To the south, Liverpool is connected to Widnes and Warrington via the A562 and A5300 and across the River Mersey to Runcorn in Cheshire, via the Silver Jubilee and Mersey Gateway bridges. The M56 motorway then provides routes into parts of the neighbouring counties, with connections to the Wirral and North Wales, and a direct route to Manchester Airport.[377] The Kingsway and Queensway Tunnels connect Liverpool with the settlements on the Wirral Peninsula across the Mersey to the west, including Birkenhead, and Wallasey. The A41 road and M53 motorway, which both begin in Birkenhead, link to Cheshire and Shropshire and via the A55, to North Wales.[378] Liverpool is served by two separate rail networks. The local rail network is managed and run by Merseyrail and provides links throughout the Liverpool city region and beyond (see Local travel below). The national network, which is managed by Network Rail, provides Liverpool with connections to major towns and cities across England. The city's primary main line station is Lime Street station, which is the terminus for several lines into the city. The station is served by a number of different train operating companies including Avanti West Coast, East Midlands Railway, London North Eastern Railway, Northern Rail, TransPennine Express and West Midlands Trains.[380][381] Between them, the station is connected with direct train services to numerous destinations including London (in 2 hours 8 minutes with Pendolino trains), Birmingham, Glasgow, Hull, Leeds, Manchester, Newcastle upon Tyne, Norwich, Nottingham, Preston, Scarborough, Sheffield and York.[382][383][384][385] Opened in 1836, Lime Street station is the world's oldest mainline terminus station still in use.[386] In the south of the city, Liverpool South Parkway provides a connection to the city's airport. The Port of Liverpool connects passengers and freight to Liverpool from all around the world. Passenger ferry services depart from the city across the Irish Sea to Belfast and the Isle of Man. Services are provided by several companies, including the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company, P&O Ferries and Stena Line. The Liverpool Cruise Terminal handles over 200,000 passengers and crew annually and is located alongside the Pier Head in the city centre. Berthing facilities for long-distance passenger cruises are provided and served by a large number of different cruise lines. Ports in Australia, France, Faroe Islands, Iceland, North America, Norway, Spain and the Caribbean are served by the facility.[387][388][389] The cruise lines that call at Liverpool cruise terminal include the following: As of 2022[update], the Port of Liverpool is the fourth busiest port in the UK by freight tonnage, handling 33 million tonnes of freight cargo.[409] It is the main port in the country for transatlantic trade and the largest port on the west coast of the UK. The Royal Seaforth and Liverpool2 container terminals are the port's two main terminals and handle a wide variety of cargo including containers, liquid and dry bulk cargoes such as coal and grain, biomass and roll-on/roll-off cargoes such as cars and trucks.[410][411][412][413][414][415] Leeds and Liverpool Canal runs into Liverpool city centre via Liverpool Canal Link at Pier Head since 2009.[416] Liverpool John Lennon Airport, which is located in the south of the city, provides Liverpool with direct air connections across the United Kingdom and Europe. It offers direct services to over 60 airports worldwide and to over 100 destinations via one-stop connections in Frankfurt, Dublin and Reykjavík. The airport is primarily served by low-cost airlines namely Aer Lingus, easyJet, Jet2.com, Loganair, Lufthansa, Play, Ryanair, Widerøe and Wizz Air, although it does provide facilities for private aircraft.[417][418][419][420][421] Liverpool's urban railway network, known as Merseyrail, is one of the busiest and most extensive in the country. The network provides approximately 30 million passenger journeys per year, across a system of 69 stations throughout Liverpool's metropolitan area, within the formal boundaries of the Liverpool city region and adjacent areas of Cheshire and Lancashire.[422][423][424][425] The network consists of three lines: the Northern Line, which runs to Southport, Ormskirk, Headbolt Lane and Hunts Cross; the Wirral Line, which runs through the Mersey Railway Tunnel and has branches to New Brighton, West Kirby, Chester and Ellesmere Port; and the City Line, which begins at Lime Street, providing links to St Helens, Wigan, Preston, Warrington and Manchester.[426][427] The network is predominantly electric and covers 75 miles (120 kilometres) of track.[428][429] Trains are owned and operated by the Merseyrail franchise and managed by Merseytravel under the direction of the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority. Local services on the City Line are operated by Northern rather than Merseyrail, although the line itself remains part of the Merseyrail network. Within Liverpool city centre, four stations and over 6+1⁄2 miles (10.5 kilometres) of tunnels are underground.[428] Hamilton Square and Liverpool James Street are the oldest deep level underground stations in the world.[430] In 2023, for the first time in UK history, battery-powered passenger trains launched on Merseyrail tracks from the newly opened Headbolt Lane station in Kirkby. The Liverpool City Region Combined Authority's long term \"Merseyrail for All\" plan is to reduce dependency on live third rail and promote battery power in order to further expand Merseyrail to previously inaccessible places across the city region and as far as Manchester, Wrexham, Warrington and Preston.[431][432] Local bus services within and around Liverpool are managed by Merseytravel[433] and are run by several different companies, including Arriva and Stagecoach. The two principal termini for local buses are Queen Square bus station (located near Lime Street railway station) for services north and east of the city, and Liverpool One bus station (located near the Royal Albert Dock) for services to the south and east.[434] Cross-river services to the Wirral use roadside terminus points in Castle Street and Sir Thomas Street. A night bus service also operates on Saturdays providing services from the city centre across Liverpool and wider region.[435] Tour bus services are provided by Maghull Coaches which allow tourists to hop-on-hop-off and view historical landmarks and attractions, as well as Liverpool F.C. and Beatles related locations.[436][437] National Express services operate from the Liverpool One bus station to and from destinations across the UK.[438] In 2023, the Liverpool city region confirmed plans to become the second place outside London to implement bus franchising. Local leaders have argued that it will improve services by transferring control over fares, ticketing and routes from bus companies to the Combined Authority. The full implementation of bus franchising will take place by the end of 2028.[439][440] The cross-river ferry service in Liverpool, known as the Mersey Ferry, is managed and operated by Merseytravel, with services operating between the Pier Head in Liverpool city centre and both Woodside in Birkenhead and Seacombe in Wallasey. Services operate at intervals ranging from 20 minutes, at peak times, to every hour during the middle of the day and at weekends.[441] Despite remaining an important transport link between the city and the Wirral Peninsula, the Mersey Ferry has become an increasingly popular tourist attraction within the city, with daytime River Explorer Cruises providing passengers with an historical overview of the River Mersey and surrounding areas.[442] A scooter-sharing system and electric bicycle scheme operates throughout Liverpool which allows residents and visitors to move around the city on rented scooters and bicycles. The scheme is operated by Swedish technology company Voi, and riders are able to pick up and drop off bikes and scooters at various locations around the city.[443][444][445] National Cycle Route 56, National Cycle Route 62 and National Cycle Route 810 run through Liverpool. As with other large cities, Liverpool is an important cultural centre within the United Kingdom, incorporating music, performing arts, museums and art galleries, literature and nightlife among others. In 2008, the cultural heritage of the city was celebrated with the city holding the title of European Capital of Culture, during which time a wide range of cultural celebrations took place in the city, including Go Superlambananas! and La Princesse. Liverpool has also held Europe's largest music and poetry event, the Welsh national Eisteddfod, three times, despite being in England, in 1884, 1900, and 1929. Liverpool is internationally known for music and is recognised by Guinness World Records as the \"World Capital City of Pop\".[447] Musicians from the city have produced 58 No. 1 singles, more than any other city in the world.[448] Both the most successful male band and girl group in global music history have contained Liverpudlian members. Liverpool is most famous as the birthplace of the Beatles and during the 1960s was at the forefront of the Beat Music movement, which would eventually lead to the British Invasion. Many notable musicians of the time originated in the city including Billy J. Kramer, Cilla Black, Gerry and the Pacemakers and The Searchers. The influence of musicians from Liverpool, coupled with other cultural exploits of the time, such as the Liverpool poets, prompted American poet Allen Ginsberg to proclaim that the city was \"the centre of consciousness of the human universe\".[449] Other musicians from Liverpool include Billy Fury, A Flock of Seagulls, Echo & the Bunnymen, Frankie Goes to Hollywood, Frankie Vaughan, Anathema, Ladytron, The Zutons, Cast, Atomic Kitten and Rebecca Ferguson. The La's 1990 hit single \"There She Goes\" was described by Rolling Stone as a \"founding piece of Britpop's foundation.\"[450] The city is also home to the oldest surviving professional symphony orchestra in the UK, the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, which is based in the Philharmonic Hall.[451] The chief conductor of the orchestra is Vasily Petrenko.[452] Sir Edward Elgar dedicated his Pomp and Circumstance March No. 1 to the Liverpool Orchestral Society, and the piece had its first performance in the city in 1901.[453] Among Liverpool's curiosities, the Austrian émigré Fritz Spiegl is notable. He not only became a world expert on the etymology of Scouse, but composed the music to Z-cars and the Radio 4 UK Theme. Well established festivals in the city include Africa Oyé and Brazilica which are the UK's largest free African and Brazilian music festivals respectively.[454][455] The dance music festival Creamfields was established by the Liverpool-based Cream clubbing brand which started life as a weekly event at Nation nightclub. There are numerous music venues located across the city, however, the Liverpool Arena is by far the largest. Opened in 2008, the 11,000-seat arena hosted the MTV Europe Music Awards the same year, and since then has played host to world-renowned acts such as Andrea Bocelli, Beyoncé, Elton John, Kanye West, Kasabian, The Killers, Lady Gaga, Oasis, Pink, Rihanna, and UB40. On 7 October 2022, the [[publisherBBCrporation and the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) announced that Liverpool would host the Eurovision Song Contest 2023 on behalf of the previous year's winning country Ukraine, which was unable to meet the demands of hosting the event due to security concerns caused by the Russian invasion of the country. The contest was held at Liverpool Arena, and consisted of two semi-finals on 9 and 11 May and a final on 13 May 2023. This was the first time that the contest took place in the city, and was also a record-extending ninth time that the UK has hosted the contest, having last done so in Birmingham in 1998.[456] Liverpool has more galleries and national museums than any other city in the United Kingdom apart from London.[12] National Museums Liverpool is the only English national collection based wholly outside London.[457] The Tate Liverpool gallery houses the modern art collection of the Tate in the North of England and was, until the opening of Tate Modern, the largest exhibition space dedicated to modern art in the United Kingdom. The FACT centre hosts touring multimedia exhibitions, while the Walker Art Gallery houses one of the most impressive permanent collections of Pre-Raphaelite art in the world.[458] Sudley House contains another major collection of pre-20th-century art.[459] Liverpool University's Victoria Building was re-opened as a public art gallery and museum to display the university's artwork and historical collections which include the largest display of art by Audubon outside the US.[460] A number of artists have also come from the city, including painter George Stubbs who was born in Liverpool in 1724. The Liverpool Biennial festival of arts runs from mid-September to late November and comprises three main sections; the International, The Independents and New Contemporaries although fringe events are timed to coincide.[461] It was during the 2004 festival that Yoko Ono's work \"My mummy was beautiful\" invited controversy when photographs of a woman's breast and crotch were exhibited on the main shopping street.[462] Felicia Hemans (née Browne) was born in Dale Street, Liverpool, in 1793, although she later moved to Flintshire, in Wales. Felicia was born in Liverpool, a granddaughter of the Venetian consul in that city. Her father's business soon brought the family to Denbighshire in North Wales, where she spent her youth. They made their home near Abergele and St. Asaph (Flintshire), and it is clear that she came to regard herself as Welsh by adoption, later referring to Wales as \"Land of my childhood, my home and my dead\". Her first poems, dedicated to the Prince of Wales, were published in Liverpool in 1808, when she was only fourteen, arousing the interest of Percy Bysshe Shelley, who briefly corresponded with her. [463] An engraving of a painting of The Wishing Gate. by S. F. Serres was published in Fisher's Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1834 with a poetical illustration by Letitia Elizabeth Landon to which she adds the note 'I believe that to this haunted gate, a common superstition is attached, namely, that to wish, and to have that wish fulfilled, is the result of such wish being uttered while passing'. It stood on the North Shore before the docks were built and was a place where farewells could be waved to departing voyagers.[464] A number of notable authors have visited Liverpool, including Daniel Defoe, Washington Irving, Charles Dickens, Thomas De Quincey, Herman Melville, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Gerard Manley Hopkins and Hugh Walpole. Defoe, after visiting the city, described it, as \"one of the wonders of Britain in his 'Tour through England and Wales'\".[465] Melville's novel Redburn deals with the first seagoing voyage of 19 years old Wellingborough Redburn between New York and Liverpool in 1839. Largely autobiographical, the middle sections of the book are set in Liverpool and describe the young merchantman's wanderings, and his reflections.[463] From 1842 to 1869, Dickens visited the city to give public readings of his novels.[466] Hawthorne was stationed in Liverpool as United States consul between 1853 and 1856.[467] Hopkins served as priest at St Francis Xavier Church, Langdale St., Liverpool, between 1879 and 81.[468] Although he is not known to have ever visited Liverpool, Jung famously had a vivid dream of the city which he analysed in one of his works.[469] Her Benny, a novel telling the tragic story of Liverpool street urchins in the 1870s, written by Methodist preacher Silas K. Hocking, was a best-seller and the first book to sell a million copies in the author's lifetime.[470] The prolific writer of adventure novels, Harold Edward Bindloss (1866–1945), was born in Liverpool. The writer, docker and political activist George Garrett was born in Seacombe, on the Wirral Peninsula in 1896 and was brought up in Liverpool's South end, around Park Road, the son of a fierce Liverpool–Irish Catholic mother and a staunch 'Orange' stevedore father. In the 1920s and 1930s, his organisation within the Seamen's Vigilance Committees, unemployed demonstrations, and hunger marches from Liverpool became part of a wider cultural force. He spoke at reconciliation meetings in sectarian Liverpool, and helped found the Unity Theatre in the 1930s as part of the Popular Front against the rise of fascism, particularly its echoes in the Spanish Civil War. Garrett died in 1966.[471] The novelist and playwright James Hanley (1897–1985) was born in Kirkdale, Liverpool, in 1897 (not Dublin, nor 1901 as he generally implied) to a working-class family.[472] Hanley grew up close to the docks and much of his early writing is about seamen. The Furys (1935) is first in a sequence of five loosely autobiographical novels about working-class life in Liverpool. James Hanley's brother, novelist Gerald Hanley (1916–92) was also born in Liverpool (not County Cork, Ireland, as he claimed).[473] While he published a number of novels he also wrote radio plays for the BBC as well as some film scripts, most notably The Blue Max (1966).[474] He was also one of several scriptwriters for a life of Gandhi (1964).[475] Novelist Beryl Bainbridge (1932–2010) was born in Liverpool and raised in nearby Formby. She was primarily known for her works of psychological fiction, often set among the English working classes. Bainbridge won the Whitbread Awards prize for best novel in 1977 and 1996 and was nominated five times for the Booker Prize. The Times newspaper named Bainbridge among their list of \"The 50 greatest British writers since 1945\".[476] J. G. Farrell was born in Liverpool in 1935 but left at the outbreak of war in 1939.[477] A novelist of Irish descent, Farrell gained prominence for his historical fiction, most notably his Empire Trilogy (Troubles, The Siege of Krishnapur and The Singapore Grip), dealing with the political and human consequences of British colonial rule. However, his career ended when he drowned in Ireland in 1979 at the age of 44. Helen Forrester was the pen name of June Bhatia (née Huband) (1919–2011),[478][479] who was known for her books about her early childhood in Liverpool during the Great Depression, including Twopence to Cross the Mersey (1974), as well as several works of fiction. During the late 1960s the city became well known for the Liverpool poets, who include Roger McGough and the late Adrian Henri. An anthology of poems, The Mersey Sound, written by Henri, McGough and Brian Patten, has sold well since it was first being published in 1967. Liverpool has produced several noted writers of horror fiction, often set on Merseyside – Ramsey Campbell, Clive Barker and Peter Atkins among them. A collection of Liverpudlian horror fiction, Spook City was edited by a Liverpool expatriate, Angus Mackenzie, and introduced by Doug Bradley, also from Liverpool.[480] Bradley is famed for portraying Barker's creation Pinhead in the Hellraiser series of films. Liverpool also has a long history of performing arts, reflected in several annual theatre festivals such as the Liverpool Shakespeare Festival, which takes place inside Liverpool Cathedral and in the adjacent historic St James' Gardens every summer; the Everyword Festival of new theatre writing, the only one of its kind in the country;[481] Physical Fest, an international festival of physical theatre;[482] the annual festivals organised by Liverpool John Moores University's drama department and the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts; and other festivals by the large number of theatres in the city, such as the Empire, Everyman,[483][484] Playhouse,[485][486] Royal Court, and Unity theatres. Notable actors and actresses from Liverpool include Arthur Askey, Tom Baker, Kim Cattrall, Jodie Comer, Stephen Graham, Rex Harrison, Jason Isaacs, Tina Malone, the McGann brothers (Joe, Mark, Paul, and Stephen), David Morrissey, Elizabeth Morton, Peter Serafinowicz, Elisabeth Sladen, Alison Steadman, and Rita Tushingham. Actors and actresses from elsewhere in the world have strong ties to the city, such as Canadian actor Mike Myers (whose parents were both from Liverpool) and American actress Halle Berry (whose mother was from Liverpool). Liverpool has a thriving and varied nightlife. The majority of the city's late-night restaurants, bars, pubs, nightclubs, music venues and comedy clubs are located in a number of distinct districts. In 2023, figures from global data company Square show that night-time spending in bars and restaurants in Liverpool city centre outperformed all major UK cities, including London.[487] Figures by the Liverpool BID Company suggest that the busiest nights of the week in Liverpool city centre are Friday and Saturday. Using cameras to track the flow of people in key locations between 7 pm and 4 am, at least 1.5 million people pass through the city centre every Friday night and almost 2 million people on Saturday nights. The data demonstrates that Monday night is the quietest night of the week in the city centre and footfall then increases every single night to reach its peak on Saturday nights. 125,889 people worked in the city's night time economy as of 2022, according to the Liverpool BID Company.[488][489][490] Liverpool's nightlife is concentrated in a number of districts including Ropewalks which comprises Concert Square, St. Peter's Square and the adjoining Seel Street and Duke Street. Other popular areas include Hardman Street, the Cavern Quarter, Baltic Triangle, Royal Albert Dock and the city's Pride Quarter, which is home to a large number of LGBT venues.[491][492] In the city's suburbs, Lark Lane in Aigburth is noted for an abundance of bars and late-night venues.[493][494] In Liverpool primary and secondary education is available in various forms supported by the state including secular, Church of England, Jewish, and Roman Catholic. Islamic education is available at primary level, but there is no secondary provision. One of Liverpool's important early schools was The Liverpool Blue Coat School; founded in 1708 as a charitable school. It is now a state grammar school. The Liverpool Blue Coat School is the top-performing school in the city with 100% 5 or more A*-C grades at GCSE resulting in the 30th best GCSE results in the country and an average point score per student of 1087.4 in A/AS levels.[495] Other notable schools include Liverpool College founded in 1840 Merchant Taylors' School founded in 1620.[496] Another of Liverpool's notable senior schools is St. Edward's College situated in the West Derby area of the city. Historic grammar schools, such as the Liverpool Institute High School and Liverpool Collegiate School—both closed in the 1980s—are still remembered as centres of academic excellence. Bellerive Catholic College is the city's top-performing non-selective school, based upon GCSE results in 2007. Liverpool has three universities: the University of Liverpool, Liverpool John Moores University and Liverpool Hope University. Edge Hill University, founded as a teacher-training college in the Edge Hill district of Liverpool, is now located in Ormskirk in South-West Lancashire. Liverpool is also home to the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts (LIPA). The University of Liverpool was established in 1881 as University College Liverpool. In 1884, it became part of the federal Victoria University. Following a Royal Charter and Act of Parliament in 1903, it became an independent university, the University of Liverpool, with the right to confer its own degrees. It was the first university to offer degrees in biochemistry, architecture, civic design, veterinary science, oceanography and social science. Liverpool Hope University, which was formed through the merger of three colleges, the earliest of which was founded in 1844, gained university status in 2005. It is the only ecumenical university in Europe.[497] It is situated on both sides of Taggart Avenue in Childwall and has a second campus in the city centre (the Cornerstone). The Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, founded to address some of the problems created by trade, continues today as a post-graduate school affiliated with the University of Liverpool and houses an anti-venom repository. Liverpool John Moores University was previously a polytechnic, and gained status in 1992. It is named in honour of Sir John Moores, one of the founders of the Littlewoods football pools and retail group, who was a major benefactor. The institution was previously owned and run by Liverpool City Council. It traces it lineage to the Liverpool Mechanics' institute, opened in 1823, making it by this measure England's third-oldest university. The city has one further education college, City of Liverpool College in the city centre. Liverpool City Council operates Burton Manor, a residential adult education college in nearby Burton, on the Wirral Peninsula. There are two Jewish schools in Liverpool, both belonging to the King David Foundation. King David School, Liverpool, is the High School and the King David Primary School. There is also a King David Kindergarten, featured in the community centre of Harold House. These schools are all run by the King David Foundation located in Harold House in Childwall; conveniently next door to the Childwall Synagogue. Liverpool is one of the most successful footballing cities in England, and is home to two top flight Premier League teams. Everton F.C. was founded in 1878 and was one of the twelve founder members of the Football League. It plays at Goodison Park. Liverpool F.C. were founded in 1892 and play at Anfield. Between them, the clubs have won 28 English First Division titles, 12 FA Cup titles, 10 League Cup titles, 6 European Cup titles, 1 FIFA Club World Cup title, 1 European Cup Winners' Cup title, 3 UEFA Cup titles, and 24 FA Charity Shields. The two clubs contest the Merseyside derby, dubbed the 'friendly derby'. Despite the name the fixture is known for its keen rivalry, having seen more sending-offs in this fixture than any other. Unlike many other derbies it is not rare for families in the city to contain supporters of both clubs.[498] Liverpool F.C. is the English and British club with the most European Cup titles with six, the latest in 2019. Liverpool has played at Anfield since 1892, when the club was formed to occupy the stadium following Everton's departure due to a dispute with their landlord. Liverpool are still playing there 125 years later, although the ground has been completely rebuilt since the 1970s. The Spion Kop (rebuilt as an all-seater stand in 1994–95) was the most famous part of the ground, gaining cult status across the world due to the songs and celebrations of the many fans who packed onto its terraces. Anfield as capacity for 54,000 spectators in comfort and is a distinctive landmark in an area filled with smaller and older buildings. Liverpool club also has a multimillion-pound youth training facility called The Academy. After leaving Anfield in 1892, Everton moved to Goodison Park on the opposite side of Stanley Park. The ground was opened on 24 August 1892, by Lord Kinnaird and Frederick Wall of the FA but the first crowds to attend the ground saw a short athletics meeting followed by a selection of music and a fireworks display. Everton's first game there was on 2 September 1892 when they beat Bolton 4–2. It was one of the host venues during the 1966 FIFA World Cup. It now has the capacity for just under 40,000 spectators all-seated, but the last expansion took place in 1994 when a new Park End Stand gave the stadium an all-seater capacity. The Goodison Road Stand dates back to the 1970s, while the Gwladys Street Stand and Bullens Road Stand are refurbished pre-Second World War structures. Everton is currently in the process of relocating, with a stadium move first mooted as early as 1996.[499] In 2003, the club were forced to abandon plans for a 55,000-seat stadium at King's Dock due to financial constraints,[500] with further proposed moves to Kirkby (comprising part of Destination Kirkby, moving the stadium just beyond Liverpool's council boundary into Kirkby) and Walton Hall Park similarly scrapped. The club will relocate to the multimillion-pound Everton Stadium designed by the American architect Dan Meis at the nearby Bramley-Moore Dock on the River Mersey waterfront during the 2024/25 season, with ground broken on the project in August 2021.[501] The new stadium will have a capacity of 52,888 which could be expanded to 62,000 demand permitting and it will be a host venue for the UEFA Euro 2028. Everton also have a multimillion-pound training facility based at Finch Farm. The Everton Women's Team play in the Women's Super League at the Walton Hall Park Stadium. Boxing is massively popular in Liverpool. The city has a proud heritage and history in the sport and is home to around 22 amateur boxing clubs, which are responsible for producing many successful boxers, such as Nel Tarleton, Alan Rudkin, John Conteh, Andy Holligan, Liam Smith, Paul Hodkinson, Tony Bellew and Robin Ried. The city also boasts a consistently strong amateur contingent which is highlighted by Liverpool being the most represented city on the GB Boxing team, as well as at the 2012 London Olympics, the most notable Liverpool amateur fighters include; Jimmy Lloyd, George Turpin, Tony Willis, Robin Reid and David Price who have all medalled at the Olympic Games. Boxing events are usually hosted at the Echo Arena and Liverpool Olympia within the city, although the former home of Liverpool boxing was the renowned Liverpool Stadium. Aintree Racecourse in the adjacent Metropolitan Borough of Sefton is home to the world's most famous steeple-chase, the Randox Grand National which takes place annually in early April. The race meeting attracts horse owners/ jockeys from around the world to compete in the demanding 4-mile (6.5-kilometre) and 30-fence course. There have been many memorable moments of the Grand National, for instance, the 100/1 outsider Foinavon in 1967, the dominant Red Rum and Ginger McCain of the 1970s and Mon Mome (100/1) who won the 2009 meeting. In 2010, the National became the first horse race to be televised in high-definition in the UK. The Royal Liverpool Golf Club, situated in the nearby town of Hoylake on the Wirral Peninsula, has hosted The Open Championship on a number of occasions, most recently in 2023. It also hosted the Walker Cup in 1983. Liverpool once contained four greyhound tracks, Seaforth Greyhound Stadium (1933–1965), Breck Park Stadium (1927–1948), Stanley Greyhound Stadium (1927–1961) and White City Stadium (1932–1973). Breck Park also hosted boxing bouts and both Stanley and Seaforth hosted Motorcycle speedway. Wavertree Sports Park is home to the Liverpool Harriers athletics club, which has produced such athletes as Curtis Robb, Allyn Condon (the only British athlete to compete at both the Summer and Winter Olympics), and Katarina Johnson-Thompson; Great Britain was represented by Johnson-Thompson at the 2012 London Olympics in the women's heptathlon, and she would go on to win the gold medal at the 2019 World Championships, giving Liverpool its first gold medal and breaking the British record in the process. In August 2012, Liverpool gymnast Beth Tweddle won an Olympic bronze medal in London 2012 in the uneven bars at her third Olympic Games, thus becoming the most decorated British gymnast in history. Park Road Gymnastics Centre provides training to a high level. Liverpool has produced several swimmers who have represented their nation at major championships such as the Olympic Games. The most notable of which is Steve Parry who claimed a bronze medal at the 2004 Athens Olympics in the 200m butterfly. Others include Herbert Nickel Haresnape, Margaret Kelly, Shellagh Ratcliffe and Austin Rawlinson. There is a purpose-built aquatics centre at Wavertree Sports Park, which opened in 2008. The City of Liverpool Swimming Club has been National Speedo League Champions 8 out of the last 11 years. The city is the hub of the Liverpool and District Cricket Competition, an ECB Premier League.[502] Sefton Park and Liverpool are the league's founder members based in the city with Wavertree, Alder and Old Xaverians clubs having joined the league more recently.[503] Liverpool plays host Lancashire County Cricket Club as an outground most seasons, including six of eight home County Championship games during Lancashire's 2011[504] title winning campaign[505] while Old Trafford was refurbished.[506][507] Since 2014 Liverpool Cricket Club has played host[508] to the annual Tradition-ICAP Liverpool International tennis tournament, which has seen tennis stars such as Novak Djokovic, David Ferrer, Mardy Fish, Laura Robson and Caroline Wozniacki. Previously this had been held at Calderstones Park, situated in Allerton in the south of the city. Liverpool Tennis Development Programme at Wavertree Tennis Centre is one of the largest in the UK. Professional basketball came to the city in 2007 with the entry of Everton Tigers, later known as Mersey Tigers, into the elite British Basketball League. The club was originally associated with Everton F.C., and was part of the Toxteth Tigers youth development programme, which reached over 1,500 young people every year.[509] The Tigers began to play in Britain's top league for the 2007–08 season, playing at the Greenbank Sports Academy before moving into the newly completed Echo Arena during that season. After the 2009–10 season, Everton F.C. withdrew funding from the Tigers, who then changed their name to Mersey Tigers. The club were expelled from the British Basketball League in 2013 due to financial problems.[510] Liverpool is one of three cities which still host the traditional sport of British baseball and it hosts the annual England-Wales international match every two years, alternating with Cardiff and Newport. Liverpool Trojans are the oldest existing baseball club in the UK. The 2014 Tour of Britain cycle race began in Liverpool on 7 September, using a city centre circuit to complete 130 km (80.8 mi) of racing.[511] The Tour of Britain took nine stages and finished in London on 14 September. A 2016 study of UK fitness centres found that, of the top 20 UK urban areas, Liverpool had the highest number of leisure and sports centres per capita, with 4.3 centres per 100,000 of the city population.[512] The city has one daily newspaper: the Echo, published by Reach plc. The Liverpool Daily Post was also published until 2013. The UK's first online only weekly newspaper called Southport Reporter (Southport and Mersey Reporter), is also one of the many other news outlets that cover the city. The independent media organisation The Post[513] also covers Liverpool, while Nerve magazine publishes articles and reviews of cultural events. Liverpool TV is a local television station serving Liverpool City Region and surrounding areas. The station is owned and operated by Made Television Ltd and forms part of a group of eight local TV stations. It broadcasts from studios and offices in Liverpool.

                "title": "Scouse - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Scouse (/skaʊs/ skowss), more formally known as Liverpool English[2] or Merseyside English,[3][4][5] is an accent and dialect of English associated with the city of Liverpool and the surrounding Liverpool City Region. The Scouse accent is highly distinctive as it was influenced heavily by Irish and Welsh immigrants who arrived via the Liverpool docks, as well as Scandinavian sailors who also used the docks,[6] and thus has very little in common with the accents found throughout the rest of England.[7] People from Liverpool are known as Liverpudlians, but are usually called Scousers; the name comes from scouse, a stew originating from Scandinavian lobscouse eaten by sailors and locals.[8][9][10][11] The development of Liverpool since the 1950s has spread the accent into nearby areas such as the towns of Runcorn and Skelmersdale.[12] Variations within Scouse have been noted: the accent of Liverpool's city centre and northern neighbourhoods is usually described as fast, harsh, and nasal,[13] while the \"Beatles-like\" accent found in the southern suburbs of Liverpool is typically referred to as slow, soft, and dark.[14] Popular colloquialisms have shown a growing deviation from the historical Lancashire dialect that was previously found in Liverpool,[12] as well as a growth in the influence of the accent in the wider area.[7][15][16][17][18] Scouse is often considered by other Britons to be one of the country's least popular accents due to its difficulty, but it conversely also performs very well in polls of British accents that people perceive as happy and friendly.[19] The word scouse is a shortened form of lobscouse, the origin of which is uncertain.[20] It is related to the Norwegian lapskaus, Swedish lapskojs, and Danish labskovs (skipperlabskovs), as well as the Low German labskaus and refers to a stew of the same name commonly eaten by sailors. In the 19th century, poorer people in Liverpool, Birkenhead, Bootle and Wallasey commonly ate scouse as it was a cheap dish and familiar to the families of seafarers. Outsiders tended to call these people \"scousers\".[21] In The Lancashire Dictionary of Dialect, Tradition and Folklore, Alan Crosby suggested that the word only became known nationwide with the popularity of the BBC sitcom Till Death Us Do Part (1965–1975), which featured a Liverpudlian socialist and a Cockney conservative in a regular argument.[10] Originally a small fishing village, Liverpool developed as a port. After the 1700s, it developed into a major international trading and industrial centre. The city consequently became a melting pot of several accents and dialects as sailors and traders from different areas (specifically Wales and Ireland) established themselves in the area. Until the mid-19th century, the dominant local accent was similar to that of neighbouring areas of Lancashire. For instance, the comedian and actor Robb Wilton (1881–1957), despite coming from the Everton district of Liverpool, spoke with a dry Lancashire accent rather than a Scouse accent.[22][better source needed] The influence of immigrants from Ireland (especially Dublin) and Northern Wales, as well as visiting Scandinavian sailors, contributed to a distinctive local Liverpool accent.[23][24] The first reference to a distinctive Liverpool accent was in 1890. Linguist Gerald Knowles suggested that the accent's nasal quality may have derived from poor public health in the 19th century, by which the prevalence of colds among many people over a long time resulted in a nasal accent coming to be regarded as the norm and copied by newer incomers learning the dialect of the local area.[25] Scousers tend to speak at a higher pitch than most other English speakers, sometimes approaching falsetto. The Victorian phonetician Alexander John Ellis said that Liverpool and Birkenhead \"had no dialect proper\", as he conceived of dialects as speech that had been passed down through generations from the earliest English speakers. Ellis did research some locations on the Wirral, but these respondents spoke in the traditional Cheshire dialect at the time and not in Scouse.[26] The 1950s Survey of English Dialects recorded traditional Lancastrian dialect from the town of Halewood, finding no trace of Scouse influence. The phonetician John C. Wells wrote that \"the Scouse accent might as well not exist\" in The Linguistic Atlas of England, which was the Survey's principal output.[27] An academic study of Scouse was undertaken by Gerald Knowles at the University of Leeds in 1973. He identified a key problem: that traditional dialect research had focused on developments from a single proto-language, but Scouse (and many other urban dialects) had resulted from interactions between an unknown number of languages.[28] The phonemic notation used in this article is based on the set of symbols used by Watson (2007). Scouse is highly distinguishable from other English dialects. Because of this international recognition, Keith Szlamp made a request to IANA on 16 September 1996 to make it a recognised Internet dialect.[47] After citing a number of references,[48][49][50][51][11] the application was accepted on 25 May 2000 and now allows Internet documents that use the dialect to be categorised as Scouse by using the language tag \"en-Scouse\". Scouse has also become well-known globally as the accent of the Beatles.[52] While the members of the band are famously from Liverpool,[53] their accents have more in common with the older Lancashire-like Liverpool dialect found in the southern suburbs; the accent has evolved into Scouse since the 1960s. Other northern English dialects include:",

Liverpool, a city and seaport in northwestern England, forms an irregular crescent along the north shore of the Mersey estuary a few miles from the Irish Sea. It is the nucleus of the metropolitan county of Merseyside in the historic county of Lancashire. The location that became the city of Liverpool was granted a charter for a planned new town by King John of England in 1207. In 1830 the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, the first in England to link two major cities, was opened. A rail network providing easy and cheap access to all major British industrial centers was soon created. All four of the Beatles—John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr—were born and started their musical careers in Liverpool. Liverpool, city and seaport, northwestern England, forming the nucleus of the metropolitan county of Merseyside in the historic county of Lancashire. The city proper, which is a metropolitan borough of Merseyside, forms an irregular crescent along the north shore of the Mersey estuary a few miles from the Irish Sea. The first significant date in the history of Liverpool is 1207, when King John of England granted a charter for a planned new town there. The town’s medieval growth was slow, but in the 18th century it expanded rapidly as a result of profitable trade with the Americas and the West Indies and became the second most important port in Britain. A major element in the general trading pattern was the Liverpool Triangle—the exchange of manufactured goods from the Mersey hinterland for slaves in West Africa who were in turn traded for sugar, molasses, spices, and other plantation crops in the West Indies. The first dock in Liverpool was built in 1715. By the end of the century, four other docks had been established along the Mersey, so that the port outranked even London in dock space. In 1830 the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, the first in England to link two major cities, was opened. A rail network providing easy and cheap access to all major British industrial centres was soon created, and steam ferry links between Liverpool and the Wirral, across the Mersey estuary, were established. This growth was accompanied by high levels of immigration from surrounding areas and from Ireland, especially during and after the Irish Potato Famine (1845–49). By the beginning of the 20th century, Liverpool had become the centre of 7 miles (11 km) of docks extending along the Mersey from Hornby (1884) in the north to Herculaneum (1866) in the south. Additional improvements were made to the docks, but after World War II Liverpool declined as an exporting and passenger port. That change can be attributed mainly to the decreasing significance, in the economic life of Britain, of Liverpool’s industrial hinterland and its traditional trade with the United States and West Africa. Low capital investment and unemployment in the docks intensified the situation. Liverpool continues to exert a great degree of dominance over the surrounding metropolitan region. Although the traditional activities of transport, communication, distribution, and shipping have declined, they are still important in the economic life of the city. The port, in addition to handling general cargo, has developed as a major facility for containerized shipping, and in 2012 it became a terminus for cruise ships. The docklands and several areas of the historic centre of the city collectively were named a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2004. However, that designation was rescinded in 2021 because of developments that have caused “the irreversible loss of attributes.” Paramount among Liverpool’s important contributions to 20th-century popular culture were the Beatles, who emerged from the Cavern (a nightclub that was part of the city’s musical scene in the 1960s) to become the world’s best-known rock group. Local “performance” poets such as Roger McGough, Adrian Henri, and Brian Patten helped popularize poetry in the 1960s. And from the heyday of the music hall to the radio comedy of Tommy Handley in the 1940s, Liverpudlians contributed to the British comedy tradition. Tourism has grown in importance and includes a rise in interest for visiting locations associated with the Beatles. Architectural landmarks include the 18th-century Town Hall and the 19th-century St. George’s Hall; the Neo-Gothic Anglican cathedral, founded in 1904 and completed in 1978; and the Roman Catholic Metropolitan Cathedral (1967), of strikingly modern design. Tate Liverpool (a branch of the national Tate galleries), Merseyside County Museum and Library, the Walker Art Gallery, the Picton Library, the International Slave Museum, and the University of Liverpool (chartered 1881) are among the many cultural institutions. Liverpool also has a well-known symphony orchestra, and the city is home to two world-class professional football (soccer) teams (Everton and Liverpool FC). Area 43 square miles (112 square km). Pop.

Pep Guardiola's reigning Premier League champions have now won just one in their past 13 games across all competitions but started with plenty of verve and led in the 14th minute when Bernardo Silva slid home Jeremy Doku's pass via a deflection off Jarrad Branthwaite. Silva, captaining City as Kyle Walker sat out this one through illness to compound a weighty absentees list, should have doubled the lead after the half-hour when Phil Foden set him up to drive a venomous shot past the post. As they have so often during their remarkable downturn, Guardiola's team were made to pay for their profligacy. Manuel Akanji and Rico Lewis were unable to deal with a cross Abdoulaye Doucoure had an age to make and Iliman Ndiaye produced a delightful finish with the outside of his right boot.

The Ukraine full-back not receiving a second booking looked like it might be Everton's biggest reprieve of that flashpoint but Pickford outwitted Haaland, guessing correctly to his right to keep out a well-struck kick that was not close enough to the corner. Haaland headed home when Savinho got to the rebound but had strayed offside and the Norwegian's aerial play in the area was perplexing thereafter following another confidence-sapping moment. The torpid state of City's self-belief was on show as the more they strained for a winner, the more they left themselves exposed to an Everton sucker punch. Doucoure and Orel Mangala had effort deflated just wide and Jack Harrison passed up a great counter-attacking opportunity in stoppage time. Guardiola's quest for answers goes on. Latest live updates | Team news and lineups | Where to watch where you are Jordan Pickford's save from Erling Haaland's second-half penalty was the pivotal moment in this 1-1 draw. The City striker is the first player down the tunnel, he looks absolutely bereft. City were pretty good up until that point, with Iliman Ndiaye's fine equaliser coming against the run of play. But after the penalty miss all the collapsing confidence and mounting doubt from their slumpo of one win in 13 was on show. A more incisive opponent probably would have punished it, but Sean Dyche would gladly have taken a point apiece from their recent run of games against Arsenal, Chelsea and City when the fixtures came out. 90+5 mins: Everton break. They have men over! Ajkanji stands up to Harrison's shot. 90+4 mins: Foden looks to flip a ball over the Everton defence. Branthwaite deals with it and Foden makes absolutely sure Broja won't break by almost pulling his shorts down. A slapstick booking. 90+3 mins: Everton break. Here's Gueye. His cross is deflected behind. Offside. Stand down. City have the ball again. 90+1 mins: Lewis lets fly from outside the box but it's over. 90 mins: Six added minutes for either team to find a winner as Everton clear another City corner. 87 mins: Branthwaite clatters through Savinho, advantage played but De Bruyne can't make the cross with Haaland and Foden queueing up. 85 mins: Simpson-Pusey and Gundogan on for Ake and Kovacic for City. 83 mins: ALMOST 2-1 TO EVERTON! A thundering strike from Mangala takes a wicked deflection and flies wide with Ortega rooted. The corner is deep towards Tarkowski and teh City goalkeeper claims his header. 76 mins: Branthwaite makes a brilliant and vital tackle on Haaland on halfway but he's down in pain. It looked like City's No. 9 inadvertently trod on him. Quite frankly, that an awful lot of human to put their weight on you. 74 mins: Gvardiol has a shot blocked from outside the box. That looked like a team running out of ideas. Handily for City, here comes Kevin De Bruyne - a man with plenty of them. His compatriot Jeremy Doku makes way. Looks like Foden will come out to play on the left wing. 69 mins: Almost 2-1 to Everton! A well-constructed break ends with Harrison's cross finding Doucoure, who back-post effort is deflected behind by Lewis. The corner is absolutely rubbish and almost goes out for a throw. The excellent Calvert-Lewin makes way for Broja. The City fans sing for Kevin De Bruyne. 68 mins: Haaland grapples successfully with Branthwaite to keep a City attack alive. Lewis slides a pass towards the No. 9 but he's not on the same wavelength. 66 mins: Foden finds Haaland in the box but again he lacks his usual conviction. They come again but Savinho duffs a tame shot over the far post. City are playing well despite grappling with their own vanishing self-belief. It all makes for quite compelling viewing. 64 mins: Ake makes a brilliant last-ditch take as Calvert-Lewin looks to dart through on goal. This game is being played more and more in transitions and that suits Everton. 63 mins: Kovacic shoots but it's blocked because he wanted too many touches. 61 mins: Doku goes on a FIFA dribble entirely outside of this game's context and pierces into the Everton box. They scramble away as far as Silva, whose shot is blocked. 60 mins: Savinho seems to want Mykolenko for a second Christmas lunch. He wins a corner off the beleaguered full-back. Gvardiol prods over at the near post on the volley. Kevin De Bruyne is warming up. 58 mins: Tarkowski fouls Silva and that's a bit of a waste from an Everton point of view. 57 mins: Nice combination play from Ndiaye and Calvert-Lewin. Ake is equal to it. Everton corner. 53 mins: PICKFORD SAVES!!!!!!!!! The shot is hard and low but not in the corner and Pickford saves down to his right. The punchline for City? Savinho gets to the rebound, diverts it across goal for Haaland to head home... he's offside. 51 mins: PENALTY TO CITY! Mykolenko has been on the waltzers against Savinho all afternoon and brings him down. No second booking, Haaland to take. 50 mins: Silva wins a corner and takes it quickly. Haaland up at the back post, falls to Savinho... brilliant save from Pickford with his boot. Now Kovacic... just wide. 49 mins: Haaland gets up to Savinhos latest cross but can only nod across goal. City camped around the Everton box. 47 mins: Gvardiol gets a glancing touch on Foden's latest corner but Everton are able to hack out of the goalmouth. Silva who opened the scoring, gets us back underway. The next goal in this one feels huge. Gvardiol blocks Harrison's cross behind with his face. Not pleasant on a cold day. Calvert-Lewin heads over and that's that. City have been pretty good here, have gone ahead again but are no longer winning. The sort of stuff that gnaws at a the confidence of a team in their predicament and Everton have definitely warmed to their task. 45 mins: Kovacic...Haaland...Foden! Coleman slides in heroically. Another corner. This one is straight into Pickford's gloves. We'll have one added minute. 44 mins: The ball falls to Savinho from the set piece, who hits a rasping one that's blocked. 43 mins: Free-kiock into the wall. Akanji lumps a dicey pass to Lewis, who does well to keep his cool. Forward come the hosts again. Coleman thwarts Doku, now it's another corner. 42 mins: Brainless from Everton as a free-kick is clumped from halfway, Haaland wins the header and Silva releases Doku. He's fouled on the edge of the box by Mykolenko, who's booked. Foden over it. 41 mins: Ndiaye now gets all the way back to the left-back position and does as good a job of defending Savinho as anyone has today. He's had some five minutes. 40 mins: Everton come forward again, sensing the suffocating nervousness inside the Etihad. Ndiaye drives across goal but it comes to nought. 36 mins: GOOOOOAAAAAAALLLLLL!!!!!!! Iliman Ndiaye!!!!!!!! And that's what happens when you don't take your chances! City deal with the initial cross from Coleman but Everotn keep the attack alive. Doucoure's cross gets a a faint touch from Akanji, which takes Lewis out of the equation and Ndiaye finds an accomplished finish for his third Premier League goal of the season and first since mid-October. A special finish!Iliman Ndiaye has Everton level at the Etihad! 👀#PLonPrime #MCIEVE pic.twitter.com/RJhXeDq0YK 33 mins: OH, SHOULD BE 2-0 TO CITY! Haaland does well to collect a second ball, Foden squares to Silva, who is suddenly in oceans of space. He looks to drive a lavish outside-of-the-foot finish across Pickford, who looks on and pays and sees the ball whistle just past his left upright. Pep Guardiola's reaction to this Bernardo Silva chance says it all! 😲#PLonPrime #MCIEVE pic.twitter.com/SRL6gAe2EH 30 mins: Savinho on the charge again. He shoots this time as the Everton bodies converge and Pickford collects a looping ball near his goalline. It's impressive from the Brazil winger but he still needs to be more decisive in the final third. 28 mins: Everton corner from very little. Ndiaye's left-wing delivery is cleared at the near post. Gueye catches a shot sweetly from the edge of the box but Ortega is behind it all the way. 26 mins: Silva pings one over the Everton line for Haaland. He can't quite get it under his spell and Pickford does superbly. That said, you sense that a Haaland anywhere near top form would have probably made it 2-0. 23 mins: Foden slips a pass through to Haaland. There's maybe a bit too much on it, he rounds Pickford but the angle is then prohibitive and Branthwaite clears behind. Foden over the corner and Ake heads over at the near post. 21 mins: That's what Ecerton want. Calvert-Lewin smartly chests down a long ball forward, brining the support attackers into play. Ndiaye lays the ball back to Mangala 25 yards out. The midfielder curls high and wide of the target. 19 mins: Foden over a City free-kick. He drops an absolutely doozy of a Christmas gift onto the six-yard line. Ribbon, glittery paper, all sorts. No one is there to convert. 14 mins: GOOOOOOAAAAAAALLLLLLLLL!!!!!! Bernardo Silva!!!!!! Doku pulls out to the touchline and plays a wall pass to Silva. A classic Guardiola team move. The Portugal midfielder's scrapping qualities come to the fore as a he slides with the hulking Branthwaite and diverts a finish beyond Pickford into the far corner. Perfectly-timed run, and a fortuitous Bernardo Silva finish! ⚽️🔵Man City score the first goal of Boxing Day!#PLonPrime #MCIEVE pic.twitter.com/Et0IRU7nyL 13 mins: Savinho darting inside once more but he won't cut the trigger, much to the crowd's chagrin. At the other end, Gvardiol just played the hosts into a spot of bother, which gave Ake a chance to test his recently repaired hamstring. Something he may or may not appreciate. 12 mins: Lewis feeds Savinho, who leaves Mykolenko on his backside, The ball breaks for Haaland but onto his weaker right foot and the shot is blocked. 10 mins: This has perhaps predictably settled into attacks vs. defence, cat-and-mouse fayre. Everton packed behind the ball but their defensive line leaving just enough encouragement for City to try a little chip over for Haaland. Here's one and Pickford gathers. 6 mins: Silva is twice careless in possession in midfield and Everton get away the second time. Calvert-Lewin can't get on the end of Harrison's searching cross as he is well marshalled by Akanji and Ake. 4 mins: Now some fancy footwork from Savinho before Pickford pouches his low cross. The home faithful provide a full-throated response. 3 mins: Both City full-backs are pegged wide, leaving Mateo Kovacic to deal with the base of the midfield alone. The Croatian does that tidily before Savinho has a shot blocked. Coleman concedes a corner. Taken short, Foden dinks a cross... Gvardiol heads against the post! 2 mins: Everton look to go direct when a City attack breaks down following Gvardiol's misplaced pass but Calvert-Lewin is offside. We just observed a minute's silence for those associated with both clubs who have passed away during 2024, including ex-Everton striker Kevin Campbell and former City boss Sven-Goran Eriksson. Everton to kickoff and Gueye gets us underway. 5 mins before kickoff: Here they come, out into the cold and drizzle. Can City warm their fans spirits with a much-needed win or are Everton about to frustrate another of the Premier League's big hitters? 10 mins before kickoff: It's a foul day in east Manchester. Kickoff not far away but plenty of fans in both the bome and away sections appear to be sheltering indoors until the last possible moment. 🏡🩵 pic.twitter.com/EoF7cv45r0 30 mins before kickoff: Erling Haaland was pretty scathing of his own performances after City suffered their latest defeat at Aston Villa last time out. The big Norwegian has scored just three times in his past 12 Premier League games, while Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford has kept five clean sheets in his past six matches to lead the Golden Glove standings. Haaland scored both goals as City battled to a 2-0 win over an obdurate Everton in this fixture last season and it feels inevitable that he and Pickford will have a key say over the destination of the points this afternoon. 1 hour before kickoff: Here's the Everton side in full. Ashley Young's suspension means a first start since August for club captain Seamus Coleman. Doku and Savinho each starting for City with their capacity to switch wings could mean a lively lunchtime for the veteran. I'm sure he'll take it all in his stride. Your Toffees to face @ManCity!🔵 #MCIEVE pic.twitter.com/khQ4ayhIbK 1 hr 15 mins before kickoff: The teams are in and City have more fitness woes. Jack Grealish has a minor injury and Kyle Walker is ill. Both are not involved. Nathan Ake is back from a hamstring straight and starts, which feels risky for his long-term fitness, but needs must. Savinho and Jeremy Doku each start on the wings to prospectively add a little more verve and service Erling Haaland with a working supply line. Your Boxing Day City side 🩵XI | Ortega Moreno, Lewis, Akanji, Ake, Gvardiol, Kovacic, Bernardo (C), Savinho, Foden, Doku, HaalandSUBS | Carson, Brits, De Bruyne, Gundogan, Simpson-Pusey, Mubama, Alleyne, O'Reilly, McAtee#ManCity | @etihad pic.twitter.com/LsM0Awa77U 1 hr 25 mins before kickoff: The other side of that is that if Pep Guardiola could pick anyone to plonk in the opposition dugout to get him out of a slump, it would almost certainly be Sean Dyche. Of course, the City manager would never say that it loud and, in his programme notes for today's game, discussed the toughness and threat his side will face from Everton in glowing terms. However, his head-to-head with Dyche across the latter's spells with Burnley and Everton reads P17 W16 D1 L0 with 52 goals scored. Some of those games were tight, such as City's suffocatingly tense 1-0 win at Turf Moor during the 2018/19 title run-in, but some...weren't. There are four 5-0s in this selection and a couple of 4-1s. FULL-TIME Burnley 0-1 Man CitySergio Aguero’s 20th #PL goal of the season gets the champions over the line and back on top of the table#BURMCI pic.twitter.com/JoemAmvYgb 1 hr 40 mins before kickoff: Everton boss Sean Dyche has seen his team shutout title-chasing Arsenal and Chelsea in their past two games. Unsurprisingly, he fancies the assignment against a City team who have become increasingly gunshy around the opposition box and brittle at the other end during their sapping slump. Speaking before the match, Dyche tapped into the creeping end-of-empire feel that has started to gather around the Etihad Stadium over these hard winter months. You go there to win anyway but when the facts and stats start ­changing they add belief. That’s just the way sport works. If a team starts suffering a little bit then it adds belief to whoever is going there. Remember under Sir Alex when people went to Old Trafford? Even when they were down you would think they’d score in Fergie time. But once that started to break down a little bit people started to believe they could have a go. It’s not down to one team or one result, it’s down to that feel, and that is what changes. If we can capitalise on that then great, but it’s not that easy. They are still a top-class bunch of players. 2 hours before kickoff: Welcome to another blockbuster Boxing Day! Man City trained on Christmas Day in a bid to be primed and ready for the visit of Everton, with Guardiola and his players desperate for an upturn in performances and results. 💬 @ErlingHaaland's post-match reflection. The match kicks off in Manchester, UK at 12:30 p.m. local time. Here's how that time translates across some of the major territories: City are without Ruben Dias and John Stones, meaning Nathan Ake (hamstring) is the latest man to be haphazardly rushed back into a light and creaking backline. Goalkeeper Ederson missed the Villa Park trip — Guardiola said he did \"not feel good\" — and Matheus Nunes is also still out. They are joined on the sidelines by Kyle Walker (illness) and Jack Grealish (knock). Kevin De Bruyne did not get off the bench last time out and is among the substitutes again, where he and Ilkay Gundogan account for almost all of the senior football experience at Guardiola's disposla.

                "content": "Theodore Edmond Bridgewater Jr.[1] (born November 10, 1992) is an American professional football quarterback for the Detroit Lions of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Louisville Cardinals, winning the 2013 Sugar Bowl, and was selected as the final first round pick of the 2014 NFL draft by the Minnesota Vikings. During his second season, Bridgewater led the Vikings to a division title and earned Pro Bowl honors. Upon suffering a severe leg injury the following offseason, Bridgewater appeared in only one game over the next two years. Bridgewater joined the New Orleans Saints in 2018 as a backup, but served as the team's starter in relief of Drew Brees and helped contribute to them winning their conference's top seed. He later held starting roles with the Carolina Panthers and Denver Broncos for one season each and spent his last two seasons as a backup for the Miami Dolphins and Detroit Lions. After initially retiring from the NFL in 2023, Bridgewater became the head football coach at Miami Northwestern, his former high school. Bridgewater returned to the Detroit Lions in 2024 after leading Miami Northwestern to a state championship. The son of Teddy Bridgewater Sr. and Rose Murphy, Bridgewater was born in Miami, Florida, on November 10, 1992. He attended Miami Northwestern Senior High School.[2] The school's football field was later renamed in his honor.[3] In his sophomore year, Bridgewater replaced Jacory Harris as starting quarterback and took over a team that had been named the 2007 national champions by USA Today. Bridgewater completed 97 of 160 attempts (60.6 percent) for 1,560 yards over the season, throwing 16 touchdowns with three interceptions. He also carried 45 times for 211 yards (4.7 average) and two more scores. Northwestern finished the season 13–3, falling short to Seminole High School of Sanford 28–21 in the 6A state title game.[4] As a junior, Bridgewater passed for 2,546 yards and 32 touchdowns and rushed for 379 yards and five more scores. In a late-September game against Hialeah-Miami Lakes High School, he completed 19 of 24 passes for 327 yards and a Dade County record of seven touchdowns.[5] Bridgewater was named second-team All-State for 6A classification and first-team All-County by the Miami Herald. Northwestern finished the season 10–2, after a 29–16 loss to rival Miami Central High School. As a senior, Bridgewater had 2,606 passing yards and 22 touchdowns despite missing parts of the season with a medial collateral ligament injury. He also rushed for 223 yards and eight more scores. Northwestern had a 9–3 record for the season, losing 42–27 to Miami Central in the 6-A semifinals, in which he threw for 436 yards and scored four touchdowns. Regarded as a four-star recruit, Bridgewater was considered the sixth best dual-threat quarterback prospect in the nation by Rivals.com.[6] He played in the 2011 U.S. Army All-American Bowl.[7] Bridgewater originally committed to the University of Miami in June 2010.[8] However, after the firing of Miami head coach Randy Shannon in November 2010, Bridgewater switched his commitment to the University of Louisville.[9] Sources: As a freshman at Louisville in 2011, Bridgewater entered the season as a backup to Will Stein. However, by the Cardinals' fourth game of the season against Marshall, he was starting and remained the starter the rest of the year.[10][11] Bridgewater finished the season completing 191 of 296 passes for 2,129 yards, 14 touchdowns, and 12 interceptions.[12] For his play, Bridgewater was named the Big East Rookie of the Year and was named a freshman All-American by Rivals.com, Scout.com, CBS Sports, and Sporting News.[13][14][15][16][17] As a sophomore in 2012, Bridgewater started 11 of 12 regular season games. In his only non-starting action, coming off the bench while injured against Rutgers, Bridgewater led his team to a win, a Big East title, and a berth to the BCS.[18] He finished the regular season completing 267-of-387 passes for 3,452 yards, 25 touchdowns, and just seven interceptions.[19] Bridgewater finished sixth in the nation in completion percentage, eighth in yards per attempt, and seventh in passing efficiency. For his play, Bridgewater was named the Big East Offensive Player of the Year.[20] The Cardinals entered the 2013 Sugar Bowl against the Florida Gators as decided underdogs.[21][22] Although Florida boasted the nation's #1 pass efficiency defense,[23] Bridgewater passed for 266 yards and two touchdowns to become the game's MVP during a 33–23 victory.[24] As a junior in 2013, Bridgewater completed 303-of-427 passes for 3,970 yards, 31 touchdowns, and four interceptions.[25] In his final college game against the Miami Hurricanes in the 2013 Russell Athletic Bowl, Bridgewater completed 35-of-42 passes for 447 yards three touchdowns and was named the game's MVP.[26][27] As early as April 2013, Bridgewater was seen as one of the top prospects for the 2014 NFL draft, alongside Jadeveon Clowney and Johnny Manziel. Reports said that, had Bridgewater been eligible for the 2013 Draft, he most likely would have been the first quarterback taken.[28] At one point, he was projected by many to be the first overall pick in the draft.[29][30] On January 1, 2014, Bridgewater announced that he would forgo his final year of eligibility at Louisville.[31] Bridgewater was selected by the Minnesota Vikings as the 32nd and final pick of the first round of the draft.[35] The Vikings had traded their second round and fourth round picks to the Seattle Seahawks to move up and select Bridgewater.[36] He signed a four-year contract worth $6.85 million with a $3.3 million signing bonus with the Vikings.[37] Bridgewater entered the season as the second-string quarterback, behind veteran Matt Cassel, but ahead of Christian Ponder.[38] Bridgewater made his NFL debut on September 21, 2014, against the New Orleans Saints, entering in relief of the injured Cassel and finished the game with 150 passing yards.[39] Bridgewater was named the starting quarterback for the remainder of the season after Cassel, who broke his foot in the aforementioned game, was placed on injured reserve.[40] On September 28, 2014, Bridgewater made his first NFL start against the Atlanta Falcons and won the game, in large part due to his 317 passing yards, and scored his first NFL touchdown on a 13-yard rush.[41] After spraining his ankle during the Falcons matchup, Bridgewater was inactive for the next game against the Green Bay Packers in Week 5. However, he was able to recover in time for the Week 6 game against the Detroit Lions. However, a weak offensive line against a strong Lions' defense led to a 17–3 rout. Bridgewater was intercepted three times, two from tipped passes, and was sacked eight times.[42] During Week 7 against the Buffalo Bills, Bridgewater threw his first NFL touchdown pass to Cordarrelle Patterson. Despite being sacked five times and throwing two interceptions, Bridgewater helped the Vikings get a 16–10 lead, but the effort was negated only by the Bills' comeback win which put them up 17–16 with no time to retaliate.[43] In the next game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Bridgewater threw for 241 yards and a touchdown and was sacked only once. He led a game-tying drive to force overtime, where fellow first-round pick Anthony Barr made a fumble recovery on the Bucs' first overtime play, giving the Vikings a 19–13 win.[44] His third win as a starter, a 29–26 comeback win over the Washington Redskins, broke a franchise record shared by Fran Tarkenton and Ponder for wins among starting rookie quarterbacks.[45] Bridgewater added to this record with wins over the Carolina Panthers, New York Jets, and Chicago Bears in weeks 13, 14, and 17 respectively.[46][47][48] The win over the Jets is notable for when wide receiver Jarius Wright turned a screen pass from Bridgewater into an 87-yard touchdown, giving the Vikings another overtime win. Bridgewater finished his rookie year with 2,919 passing yards, 14 touchdowns, 12 interceptions, and an 85.2 passer rating. He also rushed for 209 yards and a touchdown.[49] He played in 13 games, starting 12 of them. On January 13, 2015, Bridgewater was selected as the quarterback of the 2014 NFL All-Rookie team by the Pro Football Writers of America, joining Tommy Kramer as the only Vikings quarterbacks to claim this award.[50] Bridgewater also won the 2014 Pepsi Rookie of the Year award, as voted by fans.[51] Bridgewater threw for no touchdowns and an interception behind a struggling offensive line that allowed five sacks in the 3–20 loss at the San Francisco 49ers in Week 1.[52] He threw only 18 times the next game, but completed 14 of those passes for 153 yards and threw his first touchdown pass of the year to tight end Kyle Rudolph in a 26–16 win over the Lions in Minnesota's home opener.[53] Bridgewater had some struggles in week three against the San Diego Chargers, going 13 of 24 for 121 yards and one interception but won the game 31–14 with a strong performance by the defense and running back Adrian Peterson.[54] He rebounded to go 27 of 41, 269 yards and a touchdown pass to Mike Wallace against Denver Broncos who had the number one ranked defense coming into the game. Minnesota still lost 23–20 as Bridgewater was sacked seven times.[55] Coming off of a bye week, he threw 31 times and completed 17 of them for 249 yards with another touchdown pass to Rudolph, but threw two interceptions in a sloppy 16–10 win against the Kansas City Chiefs.[56] Bridgewater then had arguably the best game of his career the next week against the Lions going 25 of 35, 316 yards, two touchdown passes and no interceptions, including his first touchdown pass to rookie Stefon Diggs.[57] That game was Bridgewater's fourth career 300+ yard passing game, and the second 300+ passing game of Bridgewater's career against the Lions. Bridgewater led his fourth career fourth-quarter comeback at the Bears despite having a below-average day going 17 of 30, 187 yards, one touchdown and one interception.[58] Bridgewater went 13 of 21 for 144 yards and an interception while also rushing for a touchdown and two-point conversion against the St. Louis Rams before he sustained a blow to the head by the Rams' safety Lamarcus Joyner that caused Bridgewater to leave the game in the fourth quarter. Minnesota still managed to pull off a 21–18 victory in overtime against the Rams.[59] At home against the Bears in week 15, Bridgewater completed 17 of 20 pass attempts, four passing touchdowns, and a rushing touchdown in a 38–17 win, giving him a career-high passer rating (154.4).[60][61] In a fight for the NFC North Division Title in week 17 against the Packers, Bridgewater connected only 52.6% of his passes for 99 yards and an interception. Despite his career-lowest passer rating (45.7), the Vikings pulled off a 20–13 victory and won their first division title since 2009.[62][63] Bridgewater finished his second season with 3,231 passing yards, 14 touchdowns, and 9 interceptions. He also rushed for 192 yards and 3 touchdowns. During the wild-card round against the Seahawks in one of the coldest games ever played, Bridgewater was 17-of-24 for 146 yards as the Vikings fell 10–9 after Blair Walsh missed a 27-yard field goal.[64] On January 25, 2016, Bridgewater was named to his first Pro Bowl.[65] During a team practice on August 30, 2016, Bridgewater suffered a non-contact injury to his left leg. An ambulance took Bridgewater off the field and the rest of practice was canceled.[66] A subsequent MRI confirmed that Bridgewater tore his ACL and suffered other structural damage, including a dislocation of the knee joint. The injury was so severe that Bridgewater was at risk of losing his leg, with the surgeon describing it as a \"horribly grotesque injury... It's almost like a war wound. Everything is blown.\"[67] As a result, Bridgewater missed the rest of the 2016 season.[68][69] After the loss of Bridgewater for at least the 2016 season, the Vikings traded a first-round pick in the 2017 NFL draft and a conditional fourth-round pick in the 2018 NFL draft to the Philadelphia Eagles for quarterback Sam Bradford.[70] In 2016, the Vikings went 8–8, finishing third in the NFC North and missing the playoffs, despite starting the season with a 5–0 record.[71] The media initially reported that Bridgewater's injury would keep him out for 17–19 months, meaning he would miss the entire 2017 season. In January 2017, doctors confirmed that the healing would indeed take 19 months.[72] On May 1, 2017, the Vikings declined the fifth-year option on Bridgewater's contract, making him a free agent after the 2017 season.[73] Bridgewater began throwing and doing individual work in May at Vikings mini-camps. Head coach Mike Zimmer said on June 6, that Bridgewater \"has a long way to go\" until he is fully healed, but was impressed by his rehabilitation progress to that point.[74] However, on September 2, the Vikings announced that Bridgewater would begin the season on the PUP list, meaning that he would miss the first six games to begin the year.[75] On October 16, Bridgewater was cleared to practice, but could not return to action for three more weeks.[76][77] He was activated off PUP to the active roster on November 8 to be Case Keenum's backup.[78][79] Bridgewater entered the Week 15 game against the Cincinnati Bengals in relief of Keenum in the fourth quarter. The crowd gave Bridgewater a standing ovation as he walked onto the field.[80] Bridgewater finished with an interception out of two pass attempts as the Vikings won 34–7.[81][82] On March 18, 2018, Bridgewater signed a one-year contract with the Jets.[83][84] The contract only guaranteed a $500,000 signing bonus, though he could make up to a maximum of $15 million from a non-guaranteed salary and incentives.[85] On August 29, 2018, the Jets traded Bridgewater and a 2019 sixth-round draft pick to the Saints for a 2019 third-round draft pick.[86][87] Bridgewater made his Saints debut on October 8 against the Redskins, taking a knee twice to close out the game. He did this in two more games later in the season.[88] On December 28, with the Saints already having locked up the #1 seed, the team announced that Bridgewater would start in the season finale against the Panthers.[89] Making his first start since 2015, Bridgewater finished the game completing 14 of 22 passes for 118 yards, a touchdown, and an interception as the Saints lost 33–14. He also rushed for 12 yards.[90] On March 15, 2019, Bridgewater signed a one-year, $7.25 million fully guaranteed contract with the Saints.[91] During Week 2, he replaced Drew Brees, who left with a right thumb injury, completing 17 of 30 passes for 165 yards in a 27–9 loss to the Los Angeles Rams.[92] Due to Brees's injury, Bridgewater was named the starting quarterback for Week 3. In that game, Bridgewater completed 19 of 27 passes for 177 yards and two touchdowns as the Saints defeated the Seahawks on the road by a score of 33–27. This was the first game where Bridgewater threw for more than one touchdown in a game since week 15 of the 2015 season. In Week 5 against the Buccaneers, Bridgewater threw for 314 yards, four touchdowns, and one interception in the 31–24 win.[93] In Week 6, against the Jacksonville Jaguars, he had 240 passing yards and one passing touchdown in the 13–6 victory.[94] In Week 7, against the Bears, he had 281 passing yards and two passing touchdowns.[95] Brees returned from his injury in Week 8 against the Arizona Cardinals.[96] On March 26, 2020, Bridgewater signed a three-year, $63 million contract with the Panthers.[97] Bridgewater made his Panthers debut in the season-opening 34–30 loss to the Las Vegas Raiders and finished the game with 269 passing yards, including a 75-yard touchdown to former Jets teammate Robby Anderson.[98] During Week 2 against the Buccaneers, Bridgewater finished with 367 passing yards and two interceptions as the Panthers lost, 31–17.[99] In Week 3 against the Los Angeles Chargers, Bridgewater threw for 235 yards and one touchdown during the 21–16 win. This was Bridgewater's first win as a Panther.[100] In Week 5 against the Falcons, Bridgewater threw for 313 yards and two touchdowns during the 23–16 win.[101] In Week 9 against the Chiefs, Bridgewater threw for 310 yards and two touchdowns and rushed for 19 yards and another touchdown during the 33–31 loss.[102] Bridgewater finished the season with career-high totals in several statistics, including completions (340), passing yards (3,733), touchdowns (15) and rushing yards (279).[103] On April 28, 2021, weeks after the Panthers acquired Sam Darnold in a trade with the Jets, Bridgewater was traded to the Broncos in exchange for a 2021 sixth-round pick.[104] The team brought in Bridgewater to compete with incumbent quarterback Drew Lock, and the players split starts throughout the 2021 preseason.[105] On August 25, 2021, the Broncos announced that Bridgewater had won the starting job.[106] On September 12, Bridgewater made his Broncos debut on the road against the New York Giants, completing 28-of-36 passes for 264 yards and two touchdowns in a 27–13 season-opening victory.[107] He then led the team to 2–0 with a victory over the Jaguars in Week 2 with a 328-yard, two-touchdown day.[108] Bridgewater suffered a concussion in the Broncos Week 15 loss to the Bengals ruling him out for the rest of the season.[109] Bridgewater was placed on injured reserve on January 5, 2022.[110] He finished the 2021 season with 3,052 passing yards, 18 passing touchdowns, and seven interceptions to go along with two rushing touchdowns.[111] On March 17, 2022, Bridgewater signed a one-year contract with the Miami Dolphins worth up to $10 million.[112] Bridgewater made his first appearance for the Dolphins in Week 3 against the Bills after starter Tua Tagovailoa briefly left the game in the second quarter. He attempted two passes and was sacked once before Tagovailoa returned in the second half.[113] In Week 4 against the Bengals, Bridgewater came in the second quarter after Tagovailoa left the game with a head and neck injury. Bridgewater threw for 193 yards, a touchdown, and an interception in the 27–15 loss.[114][115] During Week 5 against the Jets, Bridgewater committed an intentional grounding penalty that occurred in the endzone for a safety. During the play, he was hit by Sauce Gardner and left the game due to a concussion.[116] In Week 6, against the Vikings, Bridgewater came into the game in relief of Skylar Thompson and passed for 329 yards, two touchdowns, and two interceptions in the 24–16 loss.[117] Following Tua Tagovailoa entering concussion protocols after their Week 16 loss against the Packers, head coach Mike McDaniel announced that Bridgewater would start against the New England Patriots in Week 17.[118] In the game, Bridgewater completed 12-of-19 passes for 161 yards, a touchdown, and an interception that was returned for a touchdown before exiting the game in the third quarter after suffering a broken finger in his throwing hand. The Dolphins went on to lose 23–21.[119] As a result of the injury, third-string rookie quarterback Skylar Thompson made his second start of the season in Week 18 against the Jets.[120] On August 10, 2023, Bridgewater signed with the Lions, a move which reunited him with Dan Campbell, the assistant head coach during his time with the Saints.[121] On December 16, 2023, Bridgewater announced his plans to retire from the NFL following the conclusion of the season, and become a high school football coach.[122] Bridgewater officially announced his retirement for the first time on February 2, 2024.[123] On December 26, 2024, Bridgewater announced on NFL Network that he intended to continue his playing career in the NFL, and that he would be re-signed by the Lions, joining Hendon Hooker in backing up starting quarterback Jared Goff.[124] After the Lions' 2023 season ended with a loss to the 49ers in the NFC Championship game, Bridgewater formally confirmed his retirement from playing, and was shortly named the head coach for Miami Northwestern High School, his alma mater.[125] In his first season, Bridgewater and Miami Northwestern won the Class 3A Florida High School Athletic Association state title.[126] Bridgewater grew up in Miami as the youngest of four children to a single mother. He is a Christian.[127][128] He graduated from the University of Louisville with a degree in Sports Administration after the 2013 college football season.[129] His mother, Rose, is a breast cancer survivor. In 2014, soon after her son was drafted by the Vikings, Cadillac presented a pink Escalade to Rose when they learned that Bridgewater had wanted to get her one ever since he was in the third grade.[130]",

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Teddy Bridgewater is making his return to the NFL. The quarterback is coming out of retirement to join the Detroit Lions, head coach Dan Campbell confirmed on Thursday. The 32-year-old teased a return earlier this month, not long after leading his alma mater Miami Northwestern to a state title in his first year as a high school football coach and Campbell confirmed that the two have been in contact for a while. The Lions were the last squad he suited up, playing for them in 2023, and he joins them again as they look to make a playoff run. Campbell had nothing but positive things to say about his returning QB. Coach Campbell on Teddy Bridgewater pic.twitter.com/UEDA77T35q \"To be able to add somebody back here that's got experience, he's stayed in shape, he's been throwing … it just brings a level of professionalism, veteran presence. Somebody that's great for our team, great for the position,\" he said. \"... This gives us somebody that's played a lot in the NFL.\" Jared Goff is Detroit's starter and the quarterback room also includes second-year player Hendon Hooker. Former fifth-rounder Jake Fromm is the Lions' practice squad QB. Campbell emphasized that this \"doesn't mean we're disappointed in Hooker\" and \"does not mean that Hooker is out.\" With the playoffs fast approaching, Campbell felt this was a great opportunity to get someone familiar with the team who has that veteran presence and experience. Bridgewater \"brings a certain level of comfort\" to the coaches and they have that trust in him, given their previous relationship. Campbell says he understands what it looks like, with people questioning what this means for Hooker, but said the playoffs are a \"different world\" and they want to have the depth to be ready for whatever happens. The Lions have dealt with extensive injuries this year, with 21 players on injured reserve, so it's not surprising that preparing for players potentially being sidelined is on the front of their mind. Campbell has also seen what can happen with quarterbacks in the playoffs, with teams being left thin at the position. He says this \"absolutely\" gives them a solid option for the emergency third quarterback and lessens their concerns there. \"If something happens you've got your third ready to roll,\" he said. Aside from what he brings to the field, Campbell also said Bridgewater brings a lot as a leader. \"It's great for our team. I think everybody in that locker room respects Teddy and what he stands for, the type of human being he is, but also the type of player,\" Campbell said. \"... When you get guys that you feel like make everybody around them a little bit better, it's hard not to have those guys around, or add them if you can.\" Bridgewater appeared in just one game for the Lions last season, but did not record a pass attempt. Bridgewater, a 2014 first-round pick of the Vikings out of Louisville, also played for the Saints, Panthers, Broncos and Dolphins. On Dec. 17, Bridgewater made the surprise announcement that he was actively pursuing a return to the league. \"We'll see how these next week-and-a-half, two weeks play out. Might be signing with a team or something and then returning back to coach high school football in February. So we'll see.\" Just over a week later, his plans are revealed. When he first discussed coming out of retirement, he did note that it doesn't mean he is done coaching. \"We wanted to win a state championship and then coach goes back to the league, see what happens and then come back in February in the offseason and continue coaching high school football. So we'll see how it plays out,\" Bridgewater said. Bridgewater's last starting gig came in 2022 as a member of the Dolphins, where he went 0-2 with 683 yards, four touchdowns and four interceptions on the year. In his career, Bridgewater has a 33-32 starting record, while throwing for 15,120 yards, 75 touchdowns and 47 interceptions. The Lions have the second-best odds of winning it all, per Caesars Sportsbook, so Bridgewater has a chance to win a Super Bowl ring and a high school championship within the same year. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive.

The 32-year-old quarterback will rejoin the Detroit Lions, coach Dan Campbell confirmed Thursday. Currently, the Lions' quarterback room is compromised of Jared Goff as Detroit's undisputed starter, second-year player Hendon Hooker, and former fifth-rounder Jake Fromm on the practice squad. Campbell outlined the Lions' objectives for signing Bridgewater for the rest of the season. \"It just brings a level of professionalism, veteran presence, somebody that's great for our team, he's great for the position.,\" Campbell said. \"Doesn't mean we're disappointed in [Hendon] Hooker. That's not what this means. It just means this gives us somebody that's played a lot in the NFL. It'll be good to get him back in the fold with us.\" Related: Bridgewater's return adds depth to the Lions' quarterback room, which currently includes starter Jared Goff and promising young backup Hendon Hooker. Campbell emphasized that Bridgewater's signing does not reflect any dissatisfaction with Hooker's development. \"This does not mean we're disappointed in [Hendon] Hooker,\"Campbell reiterated. \"That's not what this means. It just means this gives us somebody that's played a lot in the NFL.\" Bridgewater, a first-round pick by the Minnesota Vikings in 2014, spent last season as Goff's backup in Detroit. He briefly retired from the NFL earlier this year to coach his high school alma mater, Miami Northwestern, leading them to a state championship. \"My team knows that's the plan. We wanted to win a state championship and then coach goes back to the league, see what happens, and then come back February in the offseason, continue coaching high school football,\"Bridgewater told NFL Network's \"The Insiders\" last week. Bridgewater brings valuable experience to the Lions, having played for multiple teams throughout his career. He will provide veteran leadership and insurance for Goff as the team makes a playoff push in the final weeks of the season. The Lions currently hold a 13-2 record and are poised for a deep playoff run. Bridgewater's return adds another layer of depth and experience to a team already brimming with talent. © Unidad Editorial Información Deportiva, S.L.U. All rights reserved. Follow us",

                "content": "Senior Writer The Detroit Lions have brought back a familiar face. The team signed veteran quarterback Teddy Bridgewater to the active roster and he was on the practice field Thursday as the Lions begin on-field preparations for Monday night's game on the road against the San Francisco 49ers. Bridgewater spent last season as Jared Goff's backup in Detroit but retired after the season to coach his high school alma mater, Miami Northwestern. After leading Northwestern to a state title earlier this month, Bridgewater told NFL Network Insiders Ian Rapoport and Tom Pelissero he planned to return to the NFL. Bridgewater, 32, knows the offense and is a good fit in Detroit. \"I've been in contact with Teddy for a while. It was something that was always potentially a possibility,\" Lions head coach Dan Campbell said Thursday. \"We all know what Teddy's been doing down there and giving back to his community. They won a championship down there, so his debut at coaching worked out pretty dang good. \"But to be able to get somebody back here that's got experience – he's staying in shape, he's been throwing, just get him worked back in here a little bit. It just brings a level of professionalism, veteran presence, somebody that's great for our team, great for the position.\" Bridgewater has career stops with the Minnesota Vikings, New Orleans Saints, Carolina Panthers, Denver Broncos and Miami Dolphins. He's played in 79 games with 65 starts and has a 33-32 record, throwing for 15,120 yards, 75 touchdowns and 47 interceptions. Campbell said the move to add Bridgewater was not a sign that they are disappointed or lacking trust in second-year quarterback Hendon Hooker. The 2023 third-round pick has served as Goff's backup all season and Campbell said he has gotten 'a little bit better' each week. \"Doesn't mean we're disappointed in Hooker, that's not what this means, it just means this gives us somebody that's played a lot in the NFL, we're getting ready for the playoffs,\" Campbell said. \"And so, it'll be good to get him back in the fold with us.\" \"I understand what it looks like, but it's just a different world that we're getting ready to walk into, and I just – we felt like this was the right thing to do, especially with somebody that I have a tremendous amount of trust with and for. He understands our offense well, the guys know him well, the coaches know him well, and he brings a certain level of comfort to us.\" CHEESEHEADS FOR A DAY Lions fans will become huge Green Bay Packers fans Sunday starting at around 4:25 p.m. The Packers face the Vikings in Minnesota, and a Packers win would give the Lions an opportunity to clinch the NFC North title and the No. 1 seed in the NFC with a win Monday night in San Francisco. A Vikings win will mean that no matter what happens in the Lions-49ers game Monday night, the Week 18 matchup between the Vikings and Lions in Detroit will be a winner take all for the division title (and the No. 1 seed for Detroit) with the loser falling to the No. 5 seed and starting the playoffs on the road.

Campbell said he felt pretty good about Reeves-Maybin making it back this week after the Lions started his practice clock last week. The veteran linebacker has been out since injuring his neck Week 9 in Houston. He was a Pro Bowl special teamer for the Lions last year and is a valuable reserve at linebacker, especially in passing situations. The Lions have been hit hard by injury at linebacker with Alex Anzalone, Derrick Barnes, and Malcolm Rodriguez currently on IR. EXTRA POINT The Lions began the practice clock of wide receiver/returner Kalif Raymond Thursday, though Campbell didn't seem optimistic he would be able to play Monday in San Francisco. \"I don't feel as confident with him as I do Germ (Reeves-Maybin), but it's good to have him back out practicing,\" Campbell said of the possibility Raymond returns this week against the 49ers. \"It will be good to get him back out there running around.\" Head coach Dan Campbell said third-year wide receiver Jameson Williams' performance against the Chicago Bears Sunday was probably his best as a Detroit Lion.

                "title": "Rutgers Scarlet Knights football - Wikipedia",
                "content": "The Rutgers Scarlet Knights football program represents Rutgers University in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) of the National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA). Rutgers competes as a member of the Big Ten Conference. Prior to joining the Big Ten, the Scarlet Knights were a member of the American Athletic Conference (formerly the Big East Conference) from 1991 to 2013. Rutgers plays its home games at SHI Stadium, in Piscataway, New Jersey. The team is currently led by head coach Greg Schiano. The Scarlet Knights football team is notable for playing in the first collegiate football game in 1869, in which the Scarlet Knights won 6–4. On November 6, 1869, Rutgers University and Princeton University competed in the first intercollegiate football game.[7] The site for the contest was a small plot of land on what is now College Avenue on Rutgers' campus in New Brunswick, New Jersey. The structure of the game resembled more of a soccer and rugby-style contest in which players were allowed to kick and bat the ball with their fists and hands, instead of modern-day football. At the time, Rutgers was referred to as the Queensmen, a homage to the school's chartered name of Queen's College. The Rutgers squad was captained by William J. Leggett and donned scarlet kerchiefs atop their heads in an effort to distinguish between the two teams. Rutgers won the contest by a score of 6–4.[8] A week after the first game was held in New Brunswick, Rutgers visited Princeton for a second matchup. This time, Princeton prevailed by a score of 8–0. Rutgers and Princeton had planned for a third game in the 1869 season, but the contest never took place due to fears that the games were interfering with the students' studies. Thus, both schools would end the season with a record of 1–1.[8] From 1929 to 1975, Rutgers was a member of the Middle Three Conference, which consisted of a round-robin against Lafayette College and Lehigh University.[9] J. Wilder Tasker served as the head football coach of the Queensmen football program for seven seasons, from 1931 to 1937. Under his leadership, the Scarlet Knights compiled a record of 31–27–5. Tasker was replaced by Harvey Harman, who led the team from 1938 through the 1940s and into the 1950s (Rutgers did not field a football team from 1942 to 1946 due to World War II). Harvey Harman's record was 33–26–1 in a total of 14 seasons.[10] Succeeding Tasker was John Stiegman, who compiled a record of 22–15 in four seasons.[11] Starting in 1940, the 'conference champion' received the Little Brass Cannon. Following Lehigh's capture of the Little Brass Cannon in 1951, Rutgers became an independent team in 1952, but Rutgers still played games against Lafayette and the Middle Three round-robin in the 1953 season.[12] John Bateman succeeded Stiegman and coached the Scarlet Knights for 13 seasons, compiling a record of 73–51.[13] After compiling an 8–1 record in their first year under Bateman,[14] the 1961 Rutgers Scarlet Knights football team compiled a perfect 9–0 record, the first undefeated season in program history, and won the Middle Atlantic Conference University Division championship. Center Alex Kroll was the 1961 team captain and selected as a consensus All-American.[15] [16] In 1961, Rutgers was one of two major teams to compile a perfect season, Alabama being the other. The Scarlet Knights were considered a contender for the Rose Bowl, but were not selected because university president Mason Welch Gross did not express the same interest with the Rose Bowl's organizers.[17][18] Rutgers also compiled an 8–2 campaign in 1968.[19] Although Rutgers continued to be a part of the Middle Three until 1975, Rutgers became a member of the Middle Atlantic Conference from 1958 to 1961. Rutgers won the conference championship in three of those four years (1958, 1960, and 1961) and was awarded the Wilmington Touchdown Club Trophy. Rutgers then again became independent, and then remained so until it joined the Big East Conference in 1991. Frank Burns was promoted from assistant coach, to head coach after John Bateman's departure, under Burns, the Scarlet Knights enjoyed eight consecutive winning seasons,[20] which included a 9–2 campaign in the 1975 season,[21] and a perfect 11–0 season in 1976,[22] followed by winning records of 8–3,[23] 9–3,[24] 8–3[25] and 7–4[26] seasons. In 1976, Rutgers declined an invitation to play an unranked McNeese State University team at the inaugural Independence Bowl, by feeling snubbed by more prestigious bowl games despite their 11–0 perfect season.[27] In 1978, Rutgers appeared in its first bowl game, the Garden State Bowl, which it lost to Arizona State by a score of 34–18. However, with consecutive 5–6 campaigns in 1981 and 1982, and a 3–8 record in 1983, resulted in Frank Burns being dismissed as Rutgers head coach. Frank Burns left Rutgers with a 78–43–1 overall record. [28][29][30][31] Penn State offensive line coach Dick Anderson was hired to replace Burns in 1984.[32] The Scarlet Knights mostly struggled during Dick Anderson's tenure as head coach despite winning records in 1984, 1986 and 1987,[33][34][35] which resulted in Anderson's firing after the end of the 1989 season.[36] Tampa Bay Buccaneers defensive coordinator Doug Graber took over the Rutgers football program starting in 1990.[37] Under Graber's tutelage, the Scarlet Knights achieved winning seasons in 1991 and 1992,[38][39] but struggled to maintain consistency and, following a 4–7 campaign in 1995, Graber was fired with two years remaining on his original seven-year contract.[40] Rutgers joined the Big East Conference in all sports in 1991.[41] The team struggled to compete throughout the 1990s, facing powerhouse teams from Virginia Tech, Miami, and West Virginia on a yearly basis. Longtime assistant coach Terry Shea was hired to replace Graber in December 1995,[42] However, the Rutgers program suffered its worst five-year stretch in program history.[43] Shea's tenure not only failed to produce a single winning season, it failed to win more than three games in a single season with the exception of a 5–6 campaign in 1998.[44][45] After the 2000 season Shea was fired.[43] Greg Schiano took over as head coach after Terry Shea's termination.[46] Despite some early recruiting successes, his first four years resulted in losing seasons.[47][48][49][50] In 2005, the team achieved its first winning season since Graber's 7-4 campaign in 1992, which notched them a rematch bowl berth against Arizona State in the 2005 Insight Bowl.[51] In that game, Rutgers lost 45–40 in a shootout, but was led by a 100-yard rushing performance from freshman running back Ray Rice.[52] In 2006, Rutgers started the season with nine straight wins, culminating in a momentous eighteen-point comeback victory at home against the Louisville Cardinals, ranked third at the time, in what became known as the \"Pandemonium In Piscataway.\" Kicker Jeremy Ito sealed the 28–25 win with a field goal.[53] The following week, Rutgers got to its highest polling rank in school history, topping out at No. 7 in the AP Poll and No. 6 in the BCS. At year's end, the Scarlet Knights had a record of 11–2 and a postseason rank of No. 12 in the AP Poll, with a victory in the postseason: Rutgers beat Kansas State 37–10 in the Texas Bowl. It was the first bowl win in Rutgers history.[54][55] The following year, Rutgers received its first preseason rank in the AP Poll at No. 16. 2007 was an up-and-down year for the Scarlet Knights, rising into the Top 10 for the second consecutive year, only to suffer back-to-back losses.[56] Highlighted by a 30–27 upset over second ranked South Florida, and ended with an 8–5 record and a 52–30 victory over Ball State in the International Bowl.[56][57] 2008 saw Rutgers again go 8–5,[58] beginning the year 1–5 with a slow start, before seven straight victories to finish the season, winning 29–23 in the PapaJohns.com Bowl with a victory over NC State.[59] In 2009, Rutgers entered the season as the favorite to win the Big East Conference. However, the season opener was a loss to Cincinnati, who would end up with a perfect regular season—and the conference title. Rutgers finished the season with a 9–4 record,[60] defeating UCF 45–24 in the St. Petersburg Bowl.[61] Rutgers' streak of five consecutive bowl appearances ended in 2010, a year marred by a spinal cord injury suffered by defensive lineman Eric LeGrand in the sixth game of the season against Army.[62] Rutgers lost its final six games that year, and finished with a record of 4–8.[63] In 2011 the Scarlet Knights finished 9–4 with a postseason win over Iowa State 27–13 in the Pinstripe Bowl. After the 2011 season, Schiano left Rutgers less than a week before National Signing Day to become the head coach of the NFL's Tampa Bay Buccaneers.[64] Schiano left Rutgers with a 68–67 overall record.[65] Schiano also finished 5–1 overall in the post season in eleven years as head coach. He left Rutgers ranked second on the all-time wins list. Kyle Flood was promoted from offensive line coach and took over as head coach after Schiano's departure.[66] He was the 29th head coach in Rutgers football history. In 2012, Rutgers began the season 7–0, including a 35–26 defeat of Arkansas on the road in Fayetteville.[67] The team reached a No. 15 ranking in both the BCS and AP Polls, before a surprise homecoming loss to Kent State by a score of 35–23.[68] Rutgers would go on to finish the regular season 9–3,[69] including a heartbreaking 20–17 loss to Louisville in the last game of the season, in which the winner would clinch the conference's BCS Bowl berth.[70] Rutgers suffered yet another bowl loss in the Russell Athletic Bowl, dropping an overtime decision to former Big East foe Virginia Tech by a score of 13–10.[71] In November 2012, Rutgers was announced as a formal expansion acquisition of the Big Ten Conference, alongside rival Maryland of the ACC.[72] Both Maryland and Rutgers were unanimously accepted to join the conference in all sports, effective July 1, 2014. Before this, however, Rutgers competed for one season in the American Athletic Conference, created from the remaining teams of the former Big East Conference.[73] Despite high expectations, Rutgers had an underwhelming 2013 season in the AAC,[74] finishing 6–7 after losing the New Era Pinstripe Bowl to Notre Dame by a score of 29–16.[75] 2014 marked Rutgers football's first official season of Big Ten play, with conference home games against Penn State, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Indiana, as well as road games against Ohio State, Nebraska, Michigan State, and Maryland.[76] Rutgers finished the 2014 season in the Big Ten with a conference record of 3–5, including its first Big Ten Conference win over conference member Michigan, and an overall record of 7–5. Rutgers became bowl-eligible with that record and earned an invitation to play on December 26, 2014, in the 2014 Quick Lane Bowl, where it trounced North Carolina 40–21 and capped off its inaugural Big Ten season at 8–5.[77] After the 2014 season, the Scarlet Knights were awarded their first Lambert-Meadowlands Trophy, being recognized as the top team in the eastern region.[78] Looking to back up its strong showing in 2014 with another successful campaign in the Big Ten, the Scarlet Knights struggled in 2015, beleaguered before the onset of the season by the arrest of multiple active players on assault-related charges.[79] During the season, the Scarlet Knights failed to gain traction, finishing 4–8 with a 1–7 Big Ten Record. Amid the disappointment of a poor season and off-the field issues, both head coach Kyle Flood and athletic director Julie Hermann were both fired on November 29, 2015.[80][81] On December 7, 2015, Rutgers officially announced Ohio State defensive coordinator Chris Ash as the Scarlet Knights' new head football coach, becoming the 30th head coach in program history.[82] Rutgers posted a 2–10 record in Ash's first season, in the 2016 campaign.[83] In 2017, Rutgers started their first 4 games with only 1 win against Morgan State by the score of 65–0. They won their second game of the season in Illinois, for their first Big Ten win in 2 years. Rutgers finished 4–8 overall in Chris Ash second season as head coach. In 2018, Rutgers had a disappointing season, finishing 1–11 in Chris Ash third season as head coach. Rutgers won their home season opener against Texas State 35–7. Rutgers finished last in Big Ten play. Chris Ash, entering his fourth season as head coach, started the 2019 Rutgers football season with a win over the UMass Minutemen 48–21. On September 29, 2019, a day after a 52–0 loss to Michigan, Ash was fired as the Rutgers football head coach.[84] Assistant Nunzio Campanile would replace him as interim head coach.[85] Chris Ash had a dismal record in the four seasons he was with the Scarlet Knights, he finished 8–32 overall. On December 1, 2019, Rutgers and Greg Schiano agreed to an 8-year, $32 million contract that would see him return as the head coach of the Scarlet Knights.[86][87][88] The 2020 season presented unforeseen challenges dealing with the coronavirus pandemic. Playing a Big Ten-only schedule, the Scarlet Knights were one of just two teams in the conference to play all nine of its scheduled games. Rutgers, despite missing spring and summer camp, matched the program high with three Big Ten victories, all away to equal the number of league road wins the previous six seasons combined. Rutgers finished the 2020 season 3–6 overall. The program also achieved academic success with 46 student-athletes recognized on the Fall Academic All-Big Ten list, the most for the Scarlet Knights since joining the conference. The team posted its highest GPA ever as a program during the spring 2020 semester. In 2021 Schiano's second season back as head coach and playing a full schedule, Rutgers went 5–7 overall. It was an improvement but also disappointing given that expectations were for bowl eligibility. However On December 23, the NCAA football oversight committee approved Rutgers as the first bowl alternate, under rules whereby five-win teams are ranked by Academic Progress Rate (APR) calculations. Rutgers finished first in APR among the five-win schools and was given the option to accept the bid. Rutgers accepted the bowl bid to play in the TaxSlayer Gator Bowl to play against Wake Forest with only a week of preparation for the game, the Scarlet Knights would go on to lose by a score of 38–10 to conclude the 2021 season. In 2022, Rutgers won their first three games of the season, then would go on to win only one game the rest of the season, winning against the Indiana Hoosiers for their only conference win, finishing the season with a disappointing 4–8 overall record.[89] However, despite the team's losing record, it was a milestone year for head coach Greg Schiano becoming the all-time winningest coach in the programs history with 79 career wins, passing legendary coach Frank Burns 78 career wins.[90] In 2023 Rutgers won seven games to secure its first winning season since 2014. The Scarlet Knights picked up three Big Ten wins to match the program high previously set in 2014, 2017 and 2020.[89] Rutgers strength of schedule was ranked second nationally heading into bowl season and finished number four and highest among Big Ten teams according to the ESPN College Football Power Index. Eight opponents from the regular season appeared in bowl games. Rutgers solid defense and running back Kyle Monangai who rushed for 1,262 yards with 8 touchdowns led the Scarlet Knights to the postseason where Rutgers defeated the Miami Hurricanes in the Pinstripe Bowl by a score of 31–24 in which Monangai rushed for 163 yards and 1 rushing touchdown and was the MVP of the game. Rutgers has one national championship. Rutgers has one conference championship. † Co-champions Rutgers has played in 13 bowl games, with a postseason record of 7–5.[91] There have been 29 head coaches of the Rutgers football team, 4 of whom have served in multiple tenures.[92] Greg Schiano is currently the head coach. † Interim Traditional uniforms have featured red jerseys, white pants, and red helmets but the particular style has changed many times over the years. The helmets, in particular, have featured a wide range of logos. The Block R logo has seen various forms over the years but what fans now consider the \"traditional\" team logo debuted in 2001. Between 2012 and 2016, the uniform featured a distinctive chrome helmet with a rotation of red, black, and white jerseys that are based on the team's knight mascot. Rutgers returned to more of their traditional uniform (red jerseys, white pants, and red helmets) in 2016. Black jerseys have been rarely used by the team. Although black pants were worn on a couple of occasions with white jerseys on the road, the black jerseys (with black pants) have only been used eight times, in 2007, 2011, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018. In 2019, Rutgers sent a cease-and-desist letter about the Block R logo to Ruston High School in Ruston, Louisiana. The controversy was reported by national media outlets.[95] In September 2022, Rutgers unveiled new, white uniforms with red trim and matching white helmets at the season opener against Boston College.[96] Prior to every home football game, the team travels down the \"Scarlet Walk\" greeting fans and the players touch the \"First Game\" statue commemorating the first ever college football game played in 1869. A cannon is fired after a Rutgers touchdown and at the end of a game with a Rutgers win. A chant where one side of the stadium yells \"R\" and the other side responds with \"U\". Rutgers has had many key contributing players in its 155-year history of college football. Dating back to the 1910s, the university has had several All-American candidates as well as a couple of once potential Heisman Trophy candidates in its storied history. 1910s Paul Robeson, born in Princeton, NJ played under future College Football Hall of Fame coach George Sanford. In his junior and senior years, playing as an end, Robeson was selected as an All-American in 1917 and 1918. After college, he played three years in the early NFL, first with the Akron Pros in 1921 and then the Milwaukee Badgers in 1922. Robeson was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a player in 1995. 1920s Homer Hazel first played for Rutgers in 1915, and then from 1923 to 1924. He was twice named an All-American, as an end in 1923 and a fullback in 1924. Hazel was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame as a player in 1951. 1950s Bill Austin, a native of Fanwood, NJ was one of the first recognized players from Rutgers. Gifted with a twisting and elusive running style, Austin led the Scarlet Knights in rushing three straight seasons. Despite being undersized at 5'11 and 170 lbs, he rushed for 2,073 yards while ranking up 204 points in his career with Rutgers. His 32-touchdown career ranks second in the Rutgers annals among all-time scorers and he also had a total of 13 interceptions from his defensive back position, which is one short of all-time mark. Austin was inducted into the Rutgers Football Hall of Fame in 1988 and was recognized as an AP All-American in 1958. That year, Austin led the team to an 8–1 record, though the team could've gone 9-0 if Austin did not sit out the Quantico Marines game with an apparent hand injury. Austin was also considered a potential Heisman Trophy candidate, though the award was won by Pete Dawkins of Army that year. Austin went on to play for the Washington Redskins after being drafted in 1959. 1960s By the 1960s, Alex Kroll came onto the scene as a formidable opponent. At 6'2 228 lbs playing center, Kroll played and was enrolled at Yale for two seasons before serving in the Army. He later formed a bond with the football captains at Rutgers before deciding to transfer there. Kroll was extremely physical in the trenches, giving way to his spot as the captain of the team in 1961. In his senior year biography, \"his performance and leadership in 1960 helped Rutgers to a season which surpassed even the most optimistic of the previews. He has size, speed, hustle, and an uncanny ability to call defenses best equipped to stop the enemy.\" Kroll was an excellent student in the classroom, played linebacker at times, and helped lead Rutgers to a 17–1 record in his time at Rutgers, earning him AP All-American center award in the undefeated season of 1961. 1970s The 1970s featured several great players for the Scarlet Knights. From 1971 to 1973, running back JJ Jennings tore up the record books, ranking him third all time at Rutgers with 2,935 yards rushing. He also led the nation in scoring during the 1973 season, with Honorable Mention on the list of the AP All-American team. In the late 1970s, Rutgers football, led by coach Frank R. Burns, showed the nation its capabilities with an undefeated record in 1976 (11–0). That year included Rutgers star defensive tackle, Nate Toran, who finished his career with 52 sacks including 17 in 1976. Toran earned third team AP All-American that year and was joined by honorable mentions John Alexander, Jim Hughes, Henry Jenkins, and Mark Twitty. 1980s An array of different players from the 1980s led Rutgers to match-ups against teams such as Penn State, Michigan State, Alabama, and more. During that time, Deron Cherry, a standout safety for Rutgers, was an honorable AP All-American in 1980, followed by his teammate Ed McMichael. Other standouts included Jim Dumont Sr. and Tyronne Stowe, who holds the all-time record of 533 tackles. In the late 1980s, Scott Erney was an Honorable AP All-American mention, leading the team to key victories in 1988 over Michigan State and Penn State. Wide receiver Eric Young, who later went on to play baseball in the MLB, was another Honorable AP All-American mention. 1990s The early 1990s brought in a great recruiting class for Rutgers football, featuring running backs Bruce Presley and Terrell Willis. Together they were known as \"Thunder and Lightning,\" they racked up 5,889 yards combined earning Presley with second team Freshman All-American honors in 1992, and Willis with first team Freshman All-American honors in 1993. In 1994, tight end Marco Battaglia came onto the scene as a force. In his career \"on the banks,\"[97] Marco went from 27 catches, to 58, to 69 catches in 1995. With great size at 6'3\", 245 lbs, he was drafted in the second round of the 1996 NFL draft. 2000s Running back Ray Rice is a player who has stood out as a major icon in Rutgers Football. Recruited out of New Rochelle HS in New York, Rice beat out four other running backs his freshman year to earn a starting spot in 2005. He racked up 1,120 yards that season. In 2006, Rice finished second in the nation in rushing and was a finalist for the Maxwell Award, given to the best player in the country. By 2007, Rutgers University had set up a Heisman campaign for Rice. By the end of his career, Ray amassed 4,926 yards on the ground with 49 career rushing touchdowns and leads the Rutgers record book in almost every major rushing category. He was second team AP All-American two years in a row in 2006 and 2007. Wide receiver Kenny Britt and defensive back Devin McCourty were both also Honorable Mentions on the AP All-American team. Fullback Brian Leonard recruited out of Gouverneur New York HS, Leonard finished his Rutgers' career ranked fourth all-time in rushing yards with 2,775, fourth all-time in rushing touchdowns with 32, sixth all-time in receiving yards with 1,864, first all-time in receptions with 207, and tied for fourth all-time in receiving touchdowns with 13, second all-time in all-purpose yards with 4,639, and first all-time in total combined touchdowns with 45, and first all-time in career points scored with 272 total. He played for the Scarlet Knights from 2003 to 2006. 2010s Defensive back Logan Ryan played for Rutgers from 2010 to 2012. He was a first team All-Big East. Quarterback Gary Nova recruited out of Don Bosco Prep HS in New Jersey, he played for Rutgers from 2011 to 2014. Nova holds several passing records at Rutgers, with 73 career touchdown passes, making him number one in that category in the programs history. He is also number two in passing yards with 9,258 placing him second behind Mike Teel who passed for 9,383 yards. Nova is also number one in pass attempts and number two in completions in his career at Rutgers. Nova was the team's MVP in the 2014 season. Running back Isiah Pacheco recruited out of Vineland South HS in New Jersey, Pacheco finished his career ranked sixth in the Rutgers record books with 563 carries and seventh with 2,442 rushing yards with an overall total of 19 touchdowns. He also finished 11th in program history with 3,039 all-purpose yards. Punter Adam Korsak out of Melbourne Australia was a special teams weapon for Scarlet Knights. During his career at Rutgers, Korsak set many records. He is the NCAA all-time leader in punting yards with 15,318 and in attempts with 339 and also net punting yards in a season of (45.25 in 2021). He never had a punt blocked in his career at Rutgers. The greatest punter in Rutgers history was recognized as the best in the nation and was named the winner of the 2022 Ray Guy Award. It also marked a historic career for the most prolific punter in FBS history. The Scarlet Knights have had 3 players drafted in the first round of the NFL Draft. In 2010, Anthony Davis was selected 11th overall by the San Francisco 49ers, Devin McCourty was chosen No. 27 overall by the New England Patriots and in 2009, Kenny Britt was chosen No. 30 overall by the Tennessee Titans. An Associated Press All-America selection, Britt became the first player in Rutgers history to be selected in the first round of the NFL Draft. 2010 also marked the fourth consecutive year that a Scarlet Knights player been taken on the draft's first day after Brian Leonard (2007) and Ray Rice (2008) were both second-round draft selections. In the 2024 NFL draft Max Melton was selected No. 43 overall in the second-round by the Arizona Cardinals, bolstering Rutgers’ presence in the NFL. As of August 28, 2024, there are a total of 11 Scarlet Knights listed on NFL team rosters. Rutgers has a contract with SportsNet New York to air various football-related programming during the season. Previous to its Big Ten membership (where its media rights are mainly a part of the Big Ten Network), this included games produced by ESPN Plus.

With Christmas Day over, you may be stuffed with food and cheer, but I'm here to fly the flag for some great after-Christmas deals that are live right now and well worth a look if you have some spare money or gift vouchers to spend. There are deals from major retailers, including Amazon, Walmart, and Target. And as these companies look to clear their shelves to make way for 2025's products, this could be your last change to score some great deals on TVs, fitness gear, appliances, iPads, and more.How do I know that? Well I've been covering deals for years and happen to be one of TechRadar's Senior Deals Editor, so I know a deal from a dud. As such, I've been digging through the sales pages of big retailers to bring you bagians that I can fully recommend you take a look at. A few standout deals include the all-new Apple Watch SE on sale for $189, this Eufy by Anker smart scale on sale for $23.95, and the highly-rated Tineco wet dry vacuum mop on sale for $99.

If Mackenzie hasn't flagged a deal for you, then it's not worth your time. That's because Mack has more than a decade of e-commerce experience, and a knack for spotting a great deal amid a mass of shrug-worthy discounts. She can spot a bargain OLED TV from a mile away and will make sure you don't miss great price cuts on AirPods. So you're in the right place for some great after-Christmas deals to buy right now.

We still rate these as the best headphones for most people, exactly because you can find them at a price like this during holiday sales.

                "title": "Chelsea (given name) - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Chelsea is an English given name derived from the Old English place name ċealc hȳð,[1] or the modern Celcyth, meaning chalk landing place. The name evolved to Chelsea, a location on the River Thames that became a London borough known for its wealthy, socially influential residents. Many locations have been named after the English place name Chelsea.[2] The given name, a transferred use of the place name, was in use for boys in the New England region of the United States by the late 18th century and was first used for American girls in the 1840s.[2] The name was first popularized for girls in larger numbers in the United States by American comedian Chelsea Brown, who was born Lois Brown but chose Chelsea as a stage name. After Brown began appearing on the American television program Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In in 1968, the name quadrupled in use for American girls to 48 uses that year. The name debuted among the 1,000 most popular names for American girls in 1969, in 702nd place. Chelsea Morning, a 1969 hit song written about mornings in Chelsea, Manhattan by Canadian singer Joni Mitchell and later performed by Judy Collins, further popularized the name for girls with its descriptive lyrics such as \"the light poured in like butterscotch.\"[2] The name of Chelsea Clinton, daughter of American President Bill Clinton and former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, was inspired by the song when she was born in 1980. The name Chelsea increased further in popularity in the 1980s due to its use for film and television characters, such as Chelsea Thayer Wayne, a character played by Jane Fonda in the 1981 American film On Golden Pond and Chelsea Reardon, a character played by Kassie DePaiva on the American soap opera Guiding Light beginning in 1986. In 1992, the name reached peak popularity in the United States and would have been the eighth most popular name for American girls in that year if all spellings of the name were combined. The name dramatically declined in use in 1993, during the first year of Bill Clinton's presidency. At the time, it was out of fashion in the United States to name children after politicians and those who were associated with them. The name has continued to decline in use, but remained among the 1,000 most popular names for American girls in 2023.[2] Spelling variants in use in the United States include Chelsey, Chelsi, Chelsie, and Chelsy.[2] The name has also been in regular use throughout the Anglosphere, including Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, as well as in Belgium, France and Netherlands.[3]",

                "title": "Chengdu J-20 - Wikipedia",
                "content": "The Chengdu J-20 (Chinese: 歼-20; pinyin: Jiān-Èrlíng), also known as Mighty Dragon (Chinese: 威龙; pinyin: Wēilóng,[8][9][10] NATO reporting name: Fagin),[11] is a twin-engine all-weather stealth[12] fighter developed by China's Chengdu Aerospace Corporation for the People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF).[5] The J-20 is designed as an air superiority fighter with precision strike capability.[13] The aircraft has three notable variants: the initial production model, the revised airframe variant with new engines and thrust-vectoring control, and the aircraft-teaming capable twin-seat variant. Descending from the J-XX program of the 1990s,[14] the aircraft made its maiden flight on 11 January 2011,[1][2] and was officially revealed at the 2016 China International Aviation & Aerospace Exhibition.[15] The aircraft entered service in March 2017[5] with the first J-20 combat unit formed in February 2018,[5] making China the second country in the world to field an operational stealth aircraft.[16] The J-20 emerged from the late-1990s J-XX program. In 2008, the PLAAF endorsed Chengdu Aerospace Corporation's proposal, Project 718. Chengdu had previously used the double-canard configuration in the J-9, its first design and cancelled in the 1970s, and the J-10.[17][18] In 2009, a senior PLAAF official revealed that the first flight was expected in 2010–11, with a service entry date by 2019.[19] On 22 December 2010, the first J-20 prototype underwent high speed taxiing tests outside the Chengdu Aircraft Design Institute (CADI).[6][20] Three months later, the first J-20 prototype made its maiden flight in Chengdu.[1][2] The first prototype was painted with the number \"2001\". In May 2012, the second prototype took flight in the CADI facility.[21][22] Several changes were made to the third J-20 prototype, numbered \"2011\", which made its maiden flight in March 2014.[23] The new prototype showed increasing sophistication in design, including numerous subtle changes from the first two prototypes.[23] The new airframe introduced modified diverterless supersonic inlet (DSI) intakes, stealth coating, streamlined underwing fairings, and redesigned vertical stabilizers. Analysts noted new equipment and devices for multi-role operations, such as integrated targeting pods for precision-guided munition, and six additional passive infrared sensors can also be spotted around the aircraft.[24][25][26] In December 2015, the low rate initial production (LRIP) version of the J-20 was spotted by military observers.[27][28] The LRIP aircraft revealed dielectric surfaces that were previously painted for prototypes, potentially containing various sensors or baked-in radar absorbing materials.[27] In October 2017, Chinese state media reported that the designs of the J-20 had been finalized, and were ready for mass production as well as being combat-ready.[29] In March 2018, Chinese military revealed other versions of the J-20 platform were being developed.[30] In January 2019, Chinese media reported that a twin-seat variant of the J-20 is rumored to be in development for use in tactical bombing, electronic warfare and carrier strike roles.[31] In November 2019, a J-20 painted in yellow primer coating was spotted during its flight testing by defense observers at the Chengdu Aerospace Corporation manufacturing facility. The aircraft is equipped with a new variant of WS-10 Taihang engines with serrated afterburner nozzles to enhance stealth.[32][33] Report indicated Chengdu Aerospace Corporation terminated the manufacturing of J-20 with Russian engines in mid-2019.[34] Chinese media reported that a new variant of the J-20 was unveiled on July 8, 2020, and entered mass production the same day. The only change mentioned was that the new J-20 was to be equipped with thrust vectoring control.[35] Conflicting reports emerged regarding the exact engine type. Analyst Andreas Rupprecht expressed skepticism regarding the use of Russian engines on the J-20, as he believes that the J-20 is using a variant of the WS-10, which he called the WS-10C. This engine has improved thrust, stealthier serrated afterburner nozzles, and higher reliability, but it is not designed for thrust vectoring, unlike the WS-10 TVC demonstrated on a J-10 in 2018 China International Aviation & Aerospace Exhibition.[36] Analyst Jamie Hunter believed the new engine type is what he called WS-10B-3, a Chinese-made thrust-vectoring engine demonstrated on the 2018 Zhuhai Airshow.[34] In January 2021, South China Morning Post reported that the J-20 would replace its engines with the WS-10C.[37][38] The WS-10C is considered an interim solution before Shenyang WS-15 passes evaluations. Moreover, WS-10C will not be equipped with the thrust-vectoring version of the J-20 that entered mass production in 2019, which still required further testing. Overall, Chinese engineers believe WS-10C is comparable with AL-31F in performance,[39][40] and the replacement would also reduce China's dependency on Russian engines.[40] The WS-10C-powered J-20 has officially showcased to the public on 28 September 2021 at Zhuhai Airshow.[39][41][42] The development of a twin-seater variant was hinted at by J-20's chief designer in 2019.[43] In January 2021, Aviation Industry Corporation of China released computer renderings of the twin-seat variant of the J-20 fighter in celebration of the 10th anniversary of the jet's maiden flight.[44] In February 2021, a South China Morning Post infographic depicted a twin-seat J-20 variant powered by thrust vectoring WS-10C.[45] In October 2021, a taxiing prototype, dubbed J-20S by analysts,[46][47] was spotted near Chengdu Aerospace Corporation facilities, making J-20S the first-ever two-seat stealth fighter.[48][49] The twin-seat design allows the possibility for the second operator to coordinate attacks and reconnaissance missions from other friendly aircraft via networking or unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) linked via \"loyal wingman\" systems and sensors. The advantage of a second operator includes the potential for better interpreting and exploiting the enormous sensory data that could overload the limited cognitive and processing capacity for a single human, especially in a contested air combat environment.[47][50] In March 2022, Chinese state media reported that the J-20, reportedly with one engine replaced by the WS-15,[51] had performed flight trials.[52] In December 2022, Chinese military analysts indicated the WS-15 was undertaking the last stage of testing and development.[53] In late December, a prototype of the new J-20 variant was observed at Chengdu Aerospace Corporation facilities. The new variant was painted in yellow primer and different from previous J-20 aircraft in airframe design, with a low-profile blended canopy, aiming to optimize transonic flight performance and maneuverability. The new prototype was speculated to be used to test the WS-15 engine and thrust-vectoring.[54][55] In March 2023, the executive of Aero Engine Corporation of China (AECC) announced the serial production of the WS-15 has started.[56][57] FlightGlobal speculated that small-scale production and in-flight testing with the J-20 fighter was underway.[58] On 29 June 2023, a J-20 fighter in yellow primer was observed taking off from Chengdu Aircraft Cooperation airfield fitted with reportedly two WS-15 engines.[51][59] Clear photo of WS-15 equipped J-20A fighter taking flight appeared in 2024.[60] In October 2023, the Pentagon reported that PLAAF was upgrading the J-20, with enhancements such as extended weapon-carrying capability, thrust vectoring nozzles, control systems for unmanned aircraft teaming, and WS-15 high-thrust engines.[61] In November 2024, the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) officially announced the twin-seat variant of the J-20, designated the J-20S. Functions of the variant include long-range operations with multi-role capabilities, including air superiority, precision strikes, manned-unmanned teaming, battlefield surveillance, electronic warfare, and command and control.[62] The J-20 has a long and blended fuselage, with a chiseled nose section and a frameless canopy. Immediately behind the cockpit are low-observable diverterless supersonic inlet (DSI) intakes. All-moving canard surfaces with pronounced dihedral are placed behind the intakes, followed by leading edge extensions (LERX) merging into the delta wing with forward-swept trailing edges. The aft section has twin outward canted all-moving fins, short but deep ventral strakes, and conventional or low-observable[13] engine exhausts.[63][64] One important design criterion for the J-20 is high instability.[65][66] This requires sustained pitch authority at a high angle of attack, in which a conventional tail-plane would lose effectiveness due to stalling. On the other hand, a canard can deflect opposite to the angle of attack, avoiding stall and thereby maintaining control.[67] A canard design is also known to provide good supersonic performance, excellent supersonic and transonic turn performance, and improved short-field landing performance compared to the conventional delta-wing design.[68][69] Leading edge extensions and body lift are incorporated to enhance performance in a canard layout. This combination is said by the designer to generate 1.2 times the lift of an ordinary canard delta, and 1.8 times more lift than an equivalent-sized pure delta configuration. The designer claims such a combination allows the use of a smaller wing, reducing supersonic drag without compromising transonic lift-to-drag characteristics that are crucial to the aircraft's turn performance.[65][66][70] The use of a bubble canopy, extensive flight-control surfaces, and canard configuration for angle-of-attack control indicates J-20's intention to operate in air-superiority missions and within-visual-range engagements. Chief test pilot Li Gang describes the J-20 as having comparable manoeuvrability to the Chengdu J-10 while being significantly better at low-observable (LO) performance. The J-20 is a multirole air superiority fighter, with the interceptor role being just one of the options.[13] The J-20 avionics aim to obtain situational awareness through advanced sensor and data fusion while denying situational awareness to the adversary through stealth and electronic warfare. The J-20 features an integrated avionic suite consisting of multi-spectral sensors capable of providing omnidirectional coverage with.[13][71] Official information on the type of radar that J-20s use has not yet been released publicly. Some analysts believed that J-20s used Type 1475 (KLJ-5) active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar with 1856 transmit/receive modules,[72] but more recent information revealed that this radar was designed for upgraded versions of the J-11D.[73] Other analysts point out that, based on the nose cross-section of the J-20 and known data about a single transmit/receive module surface in the J-16's AESA radar system, J-20s likely contain 2000–2200 transmit/receive modules.[74] A Chinese study commissioned by the military suggested the J-20's AESA radar would have a tracking range of 200 km (120 mi; 110 nmi) with simultaneous tracking for 20 targets, and multi-target engagement capabilities.[71] The nose includes electro-optical sensors for an omnidirectional view, including a chin-mounted enclosed electro-optical sensor with a forward field-of-view for air-to-air applications.[75] In 2015, Beijing A-Star Science and Technology was developing passive sensors, the EOTS-89 electro-optical targeting system and the EORD-31 infrared search and track, for the J-20. The passive sensors enhance the capability to engage stealthy aircraft.[76] The J-20's usage of electro-optical sensors resembles the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II's avionic suite, including the AN/AAQ-37 Distributed Aperture System.[75][12] According to Chinese media in February 2024, the J-20 is equipped to perform airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) operations.[77] The aircraft features a fully-digital glass cockpit with one primary large color liquid-crystal display (LCD) touchscreen, three smaller auxiliary displays, and a wide-angle holographic heads-up display (HUD).[78][79][80] The size of the primary LCD screen is 610 mm × 230 mm (24 in × 9 in), 650 mm (25.63 in) diagonal size, with two illumination systems for operational redundancy.[81] The aircraft is fitted with a helmet-mounted display (HMD) system, which displays combat information inside the pilots' helmet visor and facilities firing missiles at high off-boresight angle.[82][83] The main weapon bay is capable of housing both long-range air-to-air missiles (AAM; PL-15 – PL-21) and precision-guided munitions (PGM; LS-6/50, LS-6/100,[84] FT-7[85]), while the two smaller lateral weapon bays behind the air inlets are intended for short-range AAMs (PL-10). These side bays allow closure of the bay doors prior to firing the missile, enhancing stealth and allowing the missile to be fired in the shortest possible time.[86][87] The main bay may carry four medium/long-range AAMs, with each lateral bay carrying a short-range missile.[88] In 2023, the United States reported that China planned to increase the J-20's missile capacity in \"low-observable configuration\".[61] A staggered arrangement of six PL-15s is possible with modified rail launchers under development.[82] A thinner profile missile, designated PL-16, was also reportedly under development in 2020 to allow the six missiles for internal carriage.[89] The PL-16 features a compressed airframe, folded fins, and a high-performance dual-pulse motor to reduce size, while maintaining the same level of performance as the PL-15.[90] The J-20 will likely use air-to-air missiles to engage in air superiority combat with other aircraft and to destroy high-value airborne assets. Supplemental missions may include launching anti-radiation missiles and air-to-ground munitions for precision-strike missions.[91] The wings include four hardpoints for auxiliary fuel tanks to extend the ferrying range[92] and large weapons, like the PL-17. The J-20 is unlikely to be the primary carrier of such large weapons as they compromise the aircraft's stealth.[93] The J-20 reportedly lacks an internal autocannon or rotary cannon, suggesting a preference for long-range engagements with missiles rather than short-ranged dogfights.[94][95] The J-20 is powered by Shenyang WS-10, an afterburner turbofan engine manufactured by Shenyang Liming Aircraft Engine Company, which reportedly enables supercruise and high maneuverability.[103] The WS-10C served as an interim engine before the adoption of the more powerful Shenyang WS-15.[91] During the prototype and initial service period, the fighter was powered by an improved Lyulka-Saturn AL-31 variant, reportedly the AL-31FM2 developed by Salyut.[98] The engine has a \"special power setting\" thrust of 145 kN (32,600 lbf).[104][105] The Shenyang WS-10B reportedly powered low rate initial production aircraft in 2015,[96] and was used as an interim engine before the adoption of the AL-31.[106][107] There are conflicting reports concerning the powerplant of the TVC-equipped J-20, dubbed J-20B.[35][108] The powerplant has been identified as the AL-31FM2, or a variant of the WS-10; \"WS-10C\" by Andreas Rupprecht,[36] or \"WS-10B-3\" by Jamie Hunter. The TVC-equipped WS-10B-3 was demonstrated at the 2018 China International Aviation & Aerospace Exhibition.[34] The Shenyang WS-10C was selected as the replacement for AL-31 due to delays on the testing and production of the WS-15 engine.[107] Aircraft powered by WS-10Cs were flying by September 2019.[39] The engine has a thrust of 142-147 kN,[34][39] a thrust-to-weight ratio of 9.5,[102] providing necessary propulsion for J-20 to supercruise, and is fitted with serrated afterburner nozzles for enhanced rear-aspect stealth.[34][39] Flights with prototypes[109] powered by the WS-10C were underway by November 2020.[110] The PLAAF began receiving WS-10C powered aircraft by 2021.[111] In January 2022, it was reported that aircraft powered by the WS-10C would be upgraded with TVC.[99] Reportedly, the WS-10C enabled supercruise.[100][101] The intended powerplant is the Shenyang WS-15[98] with a thrust of 180 kN.[112][113] The WS-15 enables supercruise, enhances maneuverability,[97] and gives the J-20 more thrust than the F-22 and F-35.[51] The engine's extra power and cooling could also be used by future directed energy weapons and sensors.[114][113] The WS-15 development was reportedly ongoing in 2019.[98][107] In March 2022, Chinese state media reported that the J-20 had performed flight trials[53] with the engine and experienced significantly improved performance.[52] It was also reported that eventually, new production and existing aircraft powered by the AL-31 would be fitted with the WS-15.[52] In April 2023, China reported that the WS-15 was ready for mass production.[56] The aircraft is equipped with a retractable refueling probe embedded on the right side of the cockpit, to help the fighter to maintain stealth while flying greater distances.[115] Analysts noted that the J-20's airframe employs a holistic approach to reduce its Radar cross-section (RCS), uniquely combining canard wings with leading edge root extensions (LERX).[30][13] The chined forebody, modified radar radome, and electroconductive canopy[13] use a stealth shaping, yielding signature performance in a mature design similar to the F-22.[116] The diverterless supersonic inlets (DSI) leading into serpentine inlets (S-ducts) can obscure the reflective surface of the engine from radar detection. DSI intakes save weight, reduce complexity, and minimize radar signature. Additional low-observable features include a flat fuselage bottom holding an internal weapons bay, sawtooth edges on compartment doors, mesh coverings on cooling ports at the base of the vertical tails, embedded antennas, and radar-absorbent coating materials.[13][117] While the aircraft's fins/strakes and axisymmetric rear areas may expose the aircraft to radar, the overall stealth shaping of the J-20 is robust and considerably more capable than the Russian PAK-FA.[63][118] Improvements regarding stealth were subsequently introduced - one prototype in 2014 was powered by WS-10 engines equipped with different jagged-edge nozzles and tiles for greater stealth.[119] The J-20 production model with the serrated WS-10C engine is also capable of mitigating negative effects on rear-aspect stealth.[120] Others have raised doubts about the use of canards on a low-observable design, stating that canards would guarantee radar detection and compromise stealth.[121][122] However, these critiques with respect to the canard's RCS may be unfounded.[13] Canards and low-observability are not necessarily mutually exclusive designs. Northrop Grumman's proposal for the U.S. Navy's Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) incorporated canards on a stealthy airframe.[123][124] Lockheed Martin employed canards on a stealth airframe for the Joint Advanced Strike Technology (JAST) program during early development before dropping them due to complications with aircraft carrier recovery.[125][126] McDonnell Douglas and NASA's X-36 featured canards and was considered to be extremely stealthy.[127] RCS can be further reduced by controlling canard deflection through flight-control software, as on the Eurofighter.[128][129] Similarly, Chinese aerospace researchers also concluded that, in terms of stealth, the canard delta configuration is comparable with the conventional arrangement.[130] Composite materials are applied to minimize the J-20's RCS.[75] The DSI enables an aircraft to reach Mach 2.0 with a simpler intake than traditionally required, and improves stealth performance by eliminating radar reflections between the diverter and the aircraft's skin. Analysts have also noted that the J-20 DSI reduces the need for the application of radar-absorbent materials.[131][132] A removable radar reflectors (Luneburg lens) is mounted on the underside of the J-20 to amplify its radar returns, concealing the real radar signature.[75] In the 2021 production model, the emitter is re-engineered to be retractable.[133] In May 2018, Indian Air Chief Marshal B.S. Dhanoa claimed at a press conference that the radars on India's Su-30MKI fighters were \"good enough\" and could detect a J-20 from \"several kilometers away\" while answering a question on whether the J-20 posed a threat to India. However, experienced analysts didn't take Dhanoa's claim seriously due to his exaggeration and the lack of validity.[134][135] Analyst Justin Bronk from Royal United Services Institute noted that Chinese were possibly flying the J-20 with radar reflectors during peacetime for safety and training purposes due to the potential for accidents and identification from other aircraft or ground installations.[136] In a more recent report, Bronk also states that even with limited stealth, J-20 could hide and strike enemy critical platforms in an airspace with background clutter caused by non-stealth fighters and other electromagnetic noise.[91] According to Aviation Week in 2021, the J-20's stealth characteristics were superior to the Sukhoi Su-57 in the frontal aspect but inferior overall - particularly in the rear - to the F-35 .[13] As the program matures with each batch, recently produced models have seen constant and significant enhancement in their stealth profile.[137][138] On 10 December 2010, the first J-20 prototype was observed undertaking high-speed taxiing tests around the Chengdu Aircraft Design Institute (CADI) facilities before the maiden flight.[6] On 11 January 2011, the first J-20 prototype (numbered \"2001\") made its first flight, lasting about 15 minutes, with a Chengdu J-10B serving as the chase aircraft.[1][2] After the successful flight, a ceremony was held, attended by the pilot, Li Gang, Chief Designer Yang Wei and General Li Andong, Deputy-Director of General Armaments.[139] On 17 April 2011, a second test flight of an hour and 20 minutes took place.[140] On 5 May 2011, a 55-minute test flight was held that included retraction of the landing gear.[141] On 26 February 2012, the first prototype J-20 performed various low-altitude maneuvers.[142][143] On 10 May 2012, the second prototype (numbered \"2002\") underwent high-speed taxiing tests, and flight testing that began later that month.[144][22] On 20 October 2012, photographs of the prototype with open compartment doors and a modified pitot tube emerged,[N 2] suggesting the possible inclusion of radar or sensors. In March 2013, images of the side weapon bays appeared, displaying a missile launch rail.[145][146] On 16 January 2014, the third J-20 prototype was revealed, showing new intakes, embedded engine nozzles, and stealth coating, as well as redesigned vertical stabilizers, and an Electro-Optical Targeting System.[119][25][147] This particular aircraft, numbered \"2011\", performed its maiden flight on 1 March 2014 and is said to represent the initial pre-serial standard.[23] By the end of 2014, three more pre-serial prototypes were flown, each with incremental improvements to the design. The fourth prototype \"2012\" was tested on 26 July 2014, sharing many similarities with the \"2011\". This pair of aircraft was reportedly powered by AL-31FM2 engines.[148][149] The fifth prototype, numbered \"2013\", took off on 29 November 2014.[150] Three weeks later, number \"2015\" made its maiden flight on 19 December 2014, indicating rapid construction capability. Both prototypes featured retractable aerial refueling probes and infrared-suppression engine nozzles.[117] The sixth prototype \"2015\" featured a slight alteration to tail booms, suggesting the installation of rear-facing sensors. PLAAF also modified an airliner to serve as the AESA radar test-bed for the J-20 program.[150] On 13 September 2015, a new prototype, marked \"2016\", began testing. It had noticeable improvements, such as apparently modified DSI bumps on the intakes. The DSI changes suggested the possibility of more powerful engines being used than its predecessors, likely to be an advanced 14-ton thrust derivative of the Russian AL-31 or Chinese Shenyang WS-10 turbofan engines. By 2020, the J-20 is scheduled to use the 18–19 ton WS-15 engine, enabling the jet to supercruise without using afterburners. The trapezoidal flight booms around the engines were further enlarged, possibly to accommodate rearwards-facing radars, electronic countermeasures, and jamming equipment. The fuselage was extended to the engine's exhaust nozzles. Compared to its \"2014\" and \"2015\" predecessors, the engine's surface area is further embedded inside the stealthy coating, providing greater rear-facing stealth against enemy detection.[117] On 24 November 2015, a new J-20 prototype, numbered \"2017\", took to the sky. The most significant change in the new prototype was the reshaped cockpit canopy, which provides the pilot with greater visibility. The lack of other design changes suggested that \"2017\" is very close to the final J-20 production configuration. Since '2017' was likely the last J-20 prototype, the low rate initial production (LRIP) of the J-20 is likely to begin in 2016.[151] Chinese media reported that the design of the J-20 was frozen and finalized, as formal ceremonies were held for the prototype \"2017\" after completing the flight testing.[152] The LRIP version later appeared in December 2015.[27] In March 2017, Chinese media reported that the fighter entered service. But it still faced a series of technical challenges that needed to be tackled, including the reliability of its WS-15 engines, the aircraft's flight control system, stealth coatings, hull materials, and infrared sensor.[153] In September 2017, a newly built J-20 prototype (numbered \"2021\") was flight testing with Chinese-made WS-10 Taihang engines, featuring sawtoothed serration edge on its afterburning nozzles.[154] The J-20 with indigenous WS-10C engines began production in 2019.[34][91] In September 2018, it was reported that issues with the development of the WS-15 engine, particularly the reliability of the turbine blades overheating at top speeds were fixed.[155] The WS-15 reportedly required further development after failing final verification testing at the end of 2019.[40] The COVID-19 pandemic imposed further delays.[107] In March 2022, Chinese state media reported that the WS-15 engine completed final testing.[156] In November 2021, the US military reported that the J-20 was gradually receiving upgrades.[157] In the same month, new J-20 two-seater variant began flight testing.[158] In December 2022, the prototype \"2051\" in yellow premier coat took flight. The new prototype had a redesigned canopy section and was speculated for engine and thrust-vectoring testing[54][55] In March 2023, J-20 fitted with one Shenyang WS-15 engine reportedly performed experimental flights.[51] On 29 June 2023, the J-20 prototype \"2052\" equipped with two distinguishable WS-15 engines took flight in Chengdu,[159] captured by Chinese military enthusiasts and spread throughout social media.[59] Another prototype with serial number \"2053\" also reportedly conducted a test flight in the same period with WS-15 engines.[160] Despite the lack of clear pictures, circumstantial evidence such as a photo of the engine installation ceremony, lack of censorship by the authorities, and modified airframe suggested the WS-15 was evidently mounted, though Janes Information Services noted the engines on trial apparently lacks the thrust vectoring control (TVC) paddles, which could be added later.[161][162][163] According to editor of Beijing-based Aerospace Knowledge magazine, vector thrust control and variable cycle engines were \"likely under development\".[164] In 2024, clear photo evidence confirmed that J-20 prototypes took flight with the WS-15, and the engine approached the final stage of testing before serial production.[160][164] Analyst Rick Joe speculated the initial production batch of the revised J-20 model might enter service with WS-10 or WS-15 engine, depending on the circumstances surrounding the development.[7] In late December 2015, a new J-20 numbered 2101 was spotted; it is believed to be the LRIP version of the aircraft.[27] Chinese media suggested the stealth aircraft will enter production ahead of schedule.[165] In July 2016, pre-production models with dark-grey paint and low visibility insignias were spotted inside a Chengdu Aerospace Corporation (CAC) facility. The production rate indicated an intended initial operational capability (IOC) date of around 2017–2018.[166] In October 2017, Chinese media reported that CAC initiated the serial production for the J-20 and is on a path towards achieving full operational capability with the People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF). State media described the CAC's production rate as \"stable\", meaning achieving a regular production rate for minimal economies of scale. The production rate was expected to be three aircraft per month.[167][168] In 2019, CAC began manufacturing J-20 fitted with Chinese-made WS-10 Taihang engines.[32] J-20s manufactured after mid-2019 were no longer fitted with Russian AL-31F turbofan engines.[34] The PLAAF began receiving WS-10C powered aircraft by 2021.[111] The production rate of J-20 was expected to be further increased.[169][170] In January 2022, United States Air Force (USAF) analyst Derek Solen estimated 50 to 74 fighters were in service based on open-source intelligence.[171] In August 2022, USAF analyst Li Xiaobing reported that over 150 had been delivered;[172] claims of 150 being in service had been made in 2021.[173] In late-2022, Andreas Rupprecht estimated total production at 208 aircraft - including pre-production aircraft - based on interpreting serial numbers;[174] an alternate interpretation with satellite images estimated 170-180.[159] The International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) reported more than 140 aircraft in service in 2022.[175] According to Bronk, the aircraft at the 2022 China International Aviation & Aerospace Exhibition had visible improvements to manufacturing tolerance and quality control.[174] According to the Chinese military, CAC accelerated production and delivery by implementing a pulse assembly line. According to Chinese military analysts, this was a response to increasing numbers of F-35 fighters deployed by the United States in the Asia-Pacific.[176][177] In 2023, the reported number of J-20s exceeded the 187 F-22 airframes. IISS reported that more than 200 aircraft were produced by the end of 2023.[178] The Diplomat reported up to 250 aircraft by July 2023, and predicted production reaching 100 aircraft per year by the end of 2023. Defense analysts had predicted the number of J-20s would match the F-22s in 2027.[159] In mid-2024, Janes Information Services estimated that approximately 195 aircraft were in PLAAF service, with more than 70 aircraft inducted between July 2023 and June 2024.[77] Pilot training for the J-20 started as early as March 2017, after the fighter entered limited service in the initial operational capability (IOC) phase. During the IOC phase, the fighters are equipped with radar reflectors, also known as the Luneburg lens, to enlarge and conceal the actual radar cross-section.[179][136] The J-20 participated in its first combat exercise in January 2018, practicing beyond-visual-range maneuvers against China's fourth-generation fighters such as J-16 and J-10C. The exercise was reported to be realistic.[180] Training with mixed generations allows pilots to become familiar with fifth-generation aircraft, and to develop tactics both for and against them.[181] Chinese Ministry of National Defense also revealed that J-20 has conducted night confrontation missions during several coordinated tactical training exercises.[182] The J-20 participated in its first over-ocean combat exercise in May 2018.[183] In April 2022, the J-20 is confirmed to be engaged in regular maritime patrols in the East China Sea and the South China Sea for routine training missions, in a statement released by CAC.[184][185] In March 2023, Chinese state media reported that the PLAAF uses J-20 fighters to simulate the F-35 in surface strike missions during opposing force training. The exercise tested the command chain and kill chain integration between the PLA Ground Force and Air Force, with two branches sharing real-time data for combined air defense missions and training tactics against stealth fighters.[186] On 12 December 2016, at least six J-20s were observed in PLAAF air bases, with tail numbers 78271-78276 identified.[187] Another six were believed to be ready for delivery by the end of December 2016.[188] On 9 March 2017, Chinese media revealed that the J-20 had entered service in the Chinese Air Force,[3][4] making China the second country in the world—after the United States—and the first in Asia to field an operational fifth-generation stealth aircraft.[16] Chinese National Defense Ministry confirmed the service status in September 2017.[180] It is anticipated that frontline units could be equipped with the low observable combat aircraft before 2020. The International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) proposed that, as the trend continues, the US could lose its monopoly on operational stealth aircraft.[189] The PLAAF began inducting J-20s into combat units in February 2018,[5] one month after its first combat drill.[180] The aircraft entered service with the 9th Fighter Brigade based at Wuhu Air Base, Anhui province in late 2018 – March 2019, replacing Su-30MKK fighters previously deployed there.[5][190] On 27 August 2019, the Central Military Commission of the People's Liberation Army approved the J-20 as the PLAN's future primary fighter, beating out the Shenyang FC-31. Arguments for the J-20 state that the plane is far more advanced, longer-ranged, and carries a heavier payload than the FC-31, while those supporting the FC-31 argued that it is cheaper, lighter, and far more maneuverable than the J-20. The J-20 would likely be commissioned upon the Type 003 aircraft carrier under construction, however, the length of the J-20 means that it has to be shortened to be considered operable on an aircraft carrier.[191] On 26 June 2021, Chinese state media reported that J-20 fighters were deployed to PLAAF units monitoring the East China Sea and Taiwan Strait. Analysts suggested that the PLAAF aimed to equip at least one to two brigades in each of the five theater commands before 2026.[192] By 2022, J-20s were deployed in combat units in all five theater commands;[193] this was officially confirmed in September 2022.[194] In March 2022, USAF general Kenneth Wilsbach confirmed that USAF F-35s have encountered J-20s deployed over the East China Sea.[195] In April 2022, Chinese state media reported J-20 started regular patrol in the South China Sea.[196] According to the China Aerospace Studies Institute (CASI), three combat brigades received the J-20 by 2021, another three by 2022, and another two by 2024.[193] In June 2024, Janes reported 12 brigades with J-20s, of which three (1st, 9th, and an unidentified unit at Changsha-Ningxiang) were equipped only with J-20s.[77] Asia Times reported that PLAAF had prioritized deploying J-20s for airbases close to China's maritime border, and believed J-20's long combat range is well-suited for high-speed interceptions, strategic area defense, and long-range strike missions over the First- and Second-island chain.[114] The following is a table of significant milestones in the J-20 program history as gleaned from public sources and cited previously in the present article: Flight testing began with prototypes in late 2010, with maiden flight in 2011. The variant entered serial production in October 2017. J-20 was incorporated into training units of the People's Liberation Army Air Force in March 2017[98] and combat units in February 2018.[5] Initially, this variant was dubbed J-20A by analysts,[120] while the later model with WS-15 engine was dubbed J-20B.[51] Later photo evidence suggested that China called the WS-15-powered variant the J-20A and previous variants J-20.[159] Initially referred to as the 'J-20B'[98][51] by defense analysts. It's an improved J-20 variant with a slightly raised cockpit, enlarged spine, reshaped nosecone, and modified engine intakes optimized for the WS-15 engines. Internal upgrades include an overhaul of software, avionics, and sensor suites, refines in airframe material and structures, improvements in signature reduction, and significant advancements in power and thermal management.[7][60] Prototype #2051 was first spotted in December 2022.[198][199] The twin-seat variant of J-20, designated J-20S. The aircraft was officially revealed at Zhuhai Airshow in 2024.[200]>[201] Initially speculated as J-20S,[61] J-20AS, or J-20B[50] by defense analysts, the twin-seat version of J-20 was first spotted in October 2021,[46] taxiing inside a Chengdu Aircraft Corporation facility in yellow primer paint and untreated composite,[202][203] making it the first twin-seat stealth fighter in the world.[47][46] The twin-seat design allows the possibility for the second operator to conduct airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) missions, which J-20 would leverage its avionics and networking capability to provide battlespace surveillance, battle management, and intelligence analysis. The stealth fighter could act as a more survivable and distributed alternative to traditional airborne warning and command post aircraft.[204] Another possibility is to coordinate attacks and reconnaissance missions from unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) linked via \"loyal wingman\" systems and sensors.[47][50][205] China is known to be developing various \"loyal wingman\" prototypes such as AVIC Dark Sword.[203] In addition to aircraft teaming, a twin-seat configuration may also provide marginal benefits in pilot training and strike missions.[47][203] The advantage of a second operator includes the potential for better interpreting and exploiting the enormous sensory data, which could overload the limited cognitive and processing capacity of a single human.[47][50] The back-seater operator would focus on managing the manned or unmanned aircraft fleet, reducing the pilot's workload in a contested air combat environment.[203][206] With increased automation and artificial intelligence in the aircraft system, the two men crew would likely be able to delegate more complex AEW&C tasks, absorb information, and make tactical decisions.[204] In August 2022, a Chinese defense publication suggested the twin-seat variant could be used as an electronic warfare platform.[207] In October 2022, Chinese media showcased the concept of the J-20 two-seater controlling stealth Hongdu GJ-11 unmanned combat aerial vehicle, and the back seat is designated for the weapons officer.[208][209] It could also potentially manage the LJ-1, a low-end modular drone platform.[210] The first test flight coincided with a visit by United States Secretary of Defense Robert Gates to China, and was initially interpreted by the Pentagon as a possible signal to the visiting US delegation. Speaking to reporters in Beijing, secretary Gates said, \"I asked President Hu about it directly, and he said that the test had absolutely nothing to do with my visit and there had been a pre-planned test.\"[211][212] Hu seemed surprised by Gates' inquiry.[213][214][215] Abraham M. Denmark of the Center for New American Security in Washington, along with Michael Swaine, an expert on the PLA and United States–China military relations, explained that senior officials are not involved in the day-to-day management of aircraft development and were unaware of the test.[212][91] Robert Gates downplayed the significance of the aircraft by questioning how stealthy the J-20 may be, but stated the J-20 would \"put some of our capabilities at risk, and we have to pay attention to them, we have to respond appropriately with our own programs.\"[216] The U.S. Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper testified that the United States knew about the program for a long time and that the test flight was not a surprise.[217] In 2011, Loren B. Thompson (Lexington Institute), echoed by a 2015 RAND Corporation report, felt that J-20's combination of forward stealth and long-range puts America's surface assets at risk and that a long-range maritime strike capability may cause the United States more concern than a short-range air-superiority fighter like the F-22.[218][219][220] In its 2011 Annual Report to Congress, the Pentagon described the J-20 as \"a platform capable of long-range, penetrating strikes into complex air defense environments.\"[221] A 2012 report by the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission suggests that the United States may have underestimated the speed of development of the J-20 and several other Chinese military development projects.[222] In the early 2010s, Western observers were not able to reach a consensus on the J-20's primary role or its specific capabilities. Experts and analysts called into question many of China's claims and stated it was considered a low observability aircraft but did not fall in the category of a true stealth aircraft based on U.S. Military standards.[223][224][225][226][227] After the deployment announcement in 2018, several analysts noted that the experience that the PLAAF will gain with the J-20 would give China a significant edge over India, Japan, and South Korea, which have struggled to design and produce their own fifth-generation fighters on schedule.[12] However, despite the failure of their indigenous projects, Japan and South Korea would soon operate the imported F-35A in 2019 equipped with better situational awareness and jet propulsion technology, negating this potential technological disparity.[228][229] United States Marine Corps created a full-scale replica (FSR) of a Chengdu J-20 in December 2018. The replica was spotted parked outside the Air Dominance Center at Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport in Georgia. The United States Marine Corps later confirmed that the aircraft was built for training.[230] By 2019, aviation researchers believed that the progress of J-20 signified that China had surpassed Russia in the application of contemporary aviation technologies such as composite materials, advanced avionics, and long-range weapons systems.[231][232] According to Justin Bronk of the Royal United Services Institute, the J-20 is one of the examples of how China has transitioned from the dependency of Russian technology to developing indigenous sensors and weapons that are superior to those of Russia; and how China is beginning to build a clear lead over Russia in most aspects of combat aircraft development in the 2020s.[233] In March 2022, the United States Air Force (USAF) general Kenneth Wilsbach described J-20s were flying professionally and he is \"relatively impressed\" with the Chinese command and control structure and AEW&C capabilities after confirming two nations had an encounter in South China Sea.[195][234] In a separate comment, the general mentioned the E-3 Sentry AEW&C aircraft is insufficient for timely detection of the J-20s.[235] In another press conference, Wilsbach downplayed his earlier remarks, stating that he would not \"lose sleep about the J-20\", USAF Chief of Staff Gen. Charles Q. Brown reflected the same sentiment, but added that the United States needs to keep up the innovation pace in the development of sixth-generation fighter technologies to not \"lose sleep\".[236][237][51] Gen. Mark D. Kelly, the head of USAF Air Combat Command (ACC) added that the United States knows China is on schedule for its 6th-generation fighter program.[238] In June 2022, the US Air Force reactivated the 65th Aggressor Squadron, equipped with F-35A to conduct opposing force training and replicate Chinese aircraft threats.[239][240] Nellis Air Force Base planned to further upgrade its fleet with more F-35s and F-22s to replicate the Chinese fifth-generation fighters.[241] In July 2024, USAF Major Joshua Campbell of CASI recommended that the USAF evaluate the concept of twin-seat J-20 fighters for future combat systems. Campbell found merit in China's approach to human-to-machine interaction in an operationally limited (CDO-L) combat environment with information saturation. He believed the twin-seat J-20, with its secondary pilot serving as a control operator for managing collaborative combat aircraft (CCA) and other aircraft in formation, could serve as an inspiration for the F-15EX program and air platforms beyond traditional roles before more advanced AI decision-maker becomes available.[242] Western sources contribute the idea that J-20 is optimized for anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) engagements, while Chinese sources universally describe J-20 as an air-superiority fighter meant to engage other fighters.[13] Rod Lee, research director at the China Aerospace Studies Institute of the Air University, believes J-20 is intended to be primarily used for destroying high-value airborne assets, which is an alternative way of establishing air superiority. Supplemental missions may include launching anti-radiation missiles and air-to-ground munitions. Rod Lee believes J-20 has the maneuverability to engage in air superiority combat with other aircraft, but PLAAF has de-emphasized the traditional attrition warfare while advocating the \"systems destruction\" approach because they believe it is more effective.[91] Matthew Jouppi of Aviation Week noted the ill-informed assumptions that existed in defense circles and argued that the United States has not adequately addressed threats posed by the increasing Chinese airpower.[13] The visual, physical configuration and stealth shaping have been claimed to be influenced by foreign aircraft, including the F-22, F-35, F-117, MiG 1.44, MiG-31, Rafale, and Eurofighter Typhoon, according to an opinion piece published in The Diplomat by Rick Joe, saying that \"if the J-20 did enjoy any of the benefits of espionage in its development, the visible physical configuration and stealth shaping were unlikely to be the recipients of it\". Instead, Joe adds that the J-20's external physical configuration is a logical development of Chengdu's previous canard-delta designs: the Chengdu J-9 - particularly the \"twin tail, side intake, canard delta\" J-9V-II - from the 1960s and 1970s, and the Chengdu J-10. Furthermore, Joe said that stealth shaping is a much more universal and consistent trait that leaves limited room for variety, and that future international designs will likely reflect this.[120] According to Rouble Sharma of GlobalData, the development of the J-20 showed a robust pace and displayed the Chinese aviation industry's in-house research, design, and manufacturing capabilities. The indigenization of critical components such as the jet engines, avionics, radar, and weapons systems helped to fast-track the production rate, and constant tests and upgrades fixed tethering and performance issues between batches. GlobalData estimated that in 2022, the Chengdu J-20 cost USD 100 million per aircraft, and the whole project cost USD $30 billion.[243] Data from Tsinghua University[245][246] General characteristics [247] Performance Armament Avionics Aircraft of comparable role, configuration, and era Related lists",

                "title": "China Stuns With Heavy Stealth Tactical Jet’s Sudden Appearance (Updated)",
                "content": "Manage your account In something of a stunning development, China appears to already be flying a stealthy, high-performance sixth-generation crewed combat aircraft, imagery of which began to emerge today. At this early stage, we have very little idea about the precise identity of the new aircraft, but many elements of its design are very much in line with what we already knew about Chinese sixth-generation airpower aspirations. Only a matter of hours after the appearance of the first Chinese combat aircraft today, videos and photos of another new design began to circulate. Also tailless, this smaller design may well originate from the Shenyang Aircraft Corporation, and you can read more about it here. pic.twitter.com/IZ9BlwjoOc — Justin Bronk (@Justin_Br0nk) December 26, 2024 第三圈 pic.twitter.com/GvKReHJ3sm — 東風 (@eastwind6699) December 26, 2024 Video and photos that began to circulate on social media today show the previously unseen aircraft conducting a daytime test flight, alongside a two-seat Chengdu J-20S fighter, serving as a chase plane. The locations and dates of the various imagery cannot be verified at this stage, although the presence of the J-20 suggests the Chengdu Aircraft Corporation (CAC) factory airfield is a likely candidate. There has also been no official comment from the Chinese Ministry of Defense or state media so far. Aside from the sheer size of the new aircraft, which we will address in a moment, the most striking thing about it is its planform and tailless configuration. It has a modified delta wing with chine lines extending all the way to the nose area, while its central fuselage section, at least the bottom of it, is loosely reminiscent of the J-20. The broad nose could even provide space for side-by-side crew seating, although the limited views of the canopy mean we cannot be sure whether the aircraft has a single-seat or two-seat arrangement, with tandem twin seats being another option. There was already growing evidence pointing to the fact that China’s next fighter would be tailless, and designs of this kind had previously appeared in the form of technical studies. Back in October 2021, a mysterious tailless aircraft shape appeared in satellite images of a CAC factory airfield. It was a large modified, diamond-like delta planform with a relatively thin nose section that also had a significant wingspan — broadly similar to that of a J-20. But it’s worth noting that this shape does not look the same as the aircraft we are seeing. Beyond that, next-generation tactical combat aircraft eschewing traditional tails is a major design driver being pursued by the U.S. military, as well. This is predominantly to significantly reduce the aircraft’s radar signature across multiple bands and from all aspects. There are some aerodynamic efficiencies also to be had with such a design, especially one used for long-range operations via a reduction in aerodynamic drag, which should provide better performance for sustained high-speed dashes and cruising flight. At the same time, a tailless configuration can adversely affect overall maneuverability, even with the most advanced computerized flight control systems. There are currently no signs of thrust-vectoring engines on this aircraft, which would help enhance agility and overall stability. The engine exhausts are mounted in the best place to mask the aircraft’s infrared signature, atop the rear of its fuselage, similar to the YF-23. While a tailless configuration, size, general shaping, and exhaust layout point directly toward a design tailored for stealth and endurance, it’s not entirely clear the exact level of enhanced low observability this new aircraft might offer. Just deleting the tail surfaces and strakes and providing a more general aerodynamic clean-up, while leveraging the same now nearly 15-year-old technology found on the the J-20, for example, would still be a massive improvement. Clearly, this aircraft incorporates significantly greater low observable technologies that are a leap ahead of the J-20, beyond its tailless design. Also notable is the elaborate arrangement of control surfaces coupled with the tailless design, with five trailing edge control surfaces per wing. These include prominent split flaps close to the wingtips. These would be used differentially to provide yaw control in the absence of tail control surfaces, as well as deploying simultaneously to serve as air brakes. In terms of size, the new aircraft can be compared to the J-20 — the imagery suggests it is at least as long. The J-20 is close to 70 feet from nose to tail. In this regard, this design’s twin-wheel main landing gear is also worth noting, providing another pointer to the considerable weight of the aircraft. Above all, its large size would seem to reflect an overarching concern with long endurance and comparatively massive internal volume to accommodate a very large fuel load, as well as weapons and sensors. Maybe the aircraft’s most unusual feature is its air intake arrangement. It appears to have an air intake on top of the fuselage, as well as twin intakes on either side of the lower fuselage. This has already led to speculation that the aircraft may have a highly unorthodox three-engine arrangement. Unconfirmed rumors point to a powerplant comprising three domestically produced WS-10C turbofans, as used in the J-20. Considering the aircraft’s higher gross weight than the J-20, three engines may be necessary in order to meet aggressive performance goals, especially for sustained high-speed flight and operations at high altitudes. Three it is. pic.twitter.com/3nSa3hFWeM — Mike Pryce (@MichaelJPryce) December 26, 2024 That China has been working on a sixth-generation combat aircraft program is also no surprise. Back in September 2022, now-retired Air Force Gen. Mark D. Kelly, who was then-head of Air Combat Command (ACC), said China was working on the same kind of air combat “system of systems” that his service was pursuing under its Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) initiative, including a sixth-generation manned fighter jet. At the time, Kelly noted that China saw sixth-generation air power, including future manned fighter aircraft, “greatly the way we see it: an exponential reduction in signature, exponential acceleration of processing power and sensing.” Another key factor would be the ability to “iterate” improvements aided by open mission systems, Kelly added. Regarding a potential successor to the J-20, Kelly warned that China “are not dummies. They know what they’re doing.” Kelly also said he expected the Chinese sixth-generation air combat program to include an “exponential” improvement in stealth compared with current platforms. At this early stage, it’s far from clear whether the new aircraft is a prototype sixth-generation fighter, or perhaps a more generalized demonstrator that will test new technologies that could potentially end up on a variety of different platforms, including a large tactical aircraft much like it. It seems almost certain that China, for some time now, has been engaged in preliminary testing of different manned fighter configurations. This development work may also include demonstrators, both sub-scale and full-size, and the new aircraft may well be related to it. The aircraft could also be related to a new regional stealth bomber aircraft, which could potentially be a crewed component tied to the broader Chinese sixth-generation airpower initiative. The regional bomber program, known as JH-XX, remains very secretive, but you can read more on what is known about that project here. Previously, it was thought that the Shenyang Aircraft Corporation might be working on the JH-XX, in which case a J-20 chase plane, from the rival Chengdu, would seem less likely. More likely, at least at this time, this aircraft could be more closely tied to China’s version of America’s NGAD initiative, which aimed to develop a similar manned heavy “fighter-like” aircraft that would work just as much as a command and control node for drones as a classic fighter. Range, sustained speed in cruise, weapons payload, and low observability are all thought to be top priorities of the manned fighter component of NGAD, or at least were. The fighter element of the program is now on hold and still may be canceled entirely, or end up looking very different, under the Trump administration. The fact that this exotic aircraft was flying during the day, in an area where it was seemingly easily photographed also tells a lot about the program’s status. It is very likely China intended for this to be seen at this time. Overall, while so much remains unknown, what we can say about this aircraft definitively is that it’s a large, very heavy, tactical jet that has had a massive premium put on combat radios and survivability. High altitude operations are also likely a feature of this design, especially if it does indeed feature three engines. But above all else, if procured in an operation form by the PLAAF, it would be able to fly over long regional distances and loiter for extended periods on station far from home without tanker support — something China lacks in terms of capacity versus the United States. It would also presumably be able to do this in closer proximity to threats than any other manned aircraft in China’s arsenal. In other words, it could put targets in the air, on the ground, and at sea at risk in areas where they currently do not expect a threat from a manned combat aircraft. This has real implications for American tankers, airlifters, and airborne early warning and control, and reconnaissance aircraft, as well as allied ships and forces operating at forward locales. It would also serve as a critical force-multiplying sensor platform operating far forward. Paired with drone wingmen of relevant endurance, its lethality and survivability would be multiplied. In other words, the existence of this aircraft is a very big deal. Update, 3:45 p.m. EST: The designation of the new combat aircraft that appeared today, apparently from the Chengdu Aircraft Corporation, has now been reported — albeit unconfirmed — as the J-36. A new photo of the jet shows it with a code number displayed on the forward fuselage, with the first two digits being ‘36,’ although the remainder has been censored. The J-36 designation would be logical after the J-35 — the highest number confirmed so far in the Chinese fighter (Jianjiji) series. Also noticeable here is what look like two sets of large apertures on either side of the nose. One appears to be an electro-optical window while the other looks like it is for an RF sensor. The latter is very likely to be for side-looking airborne radar (SLAR) arrays, which would provide a far greater radar coverage than just a front-mounted array alone. It also allows for unique tactics that can greatly enhance the survivability of the aircraft during an engagement. You can read more about this feature here and the tactics related to maintaining perpendicular radar locks here. The Su-57 has this feature and the F-22 was going to have it before it got cut due to cost during the aircraft’s latter development period. The optical apertures are of interest for reconnaissance and situational awareness, with a relatively large camera system being able to fit behind those big windows, if indeed that is what they are. Also seen in this image is the weapons bay, which looks similar in configuration with the J-20, although it is likely far deeper and possibly longer. There are also additional trailing edge segmented surfaces viewable in the central tail section, where the exhaust would be exiting above. This is very interesting because just how much articulation those have isn’t clear. There appears to be a whopping 18 separate segments on the aircraft’s trailing edge. A flight data probe can also be seen in these images on the aircraft’s nose, which is customary for aircraft in early flight test configuration. The rear aspect of the aircraft shows the three-pack of YF-23-like exhausts: Contact the author: thomas@thedrive.com",

                "title": "China Videos Tease Beijing's Newest 'Sixth Generation' Fighter Jets - Newsweek",
                "content": "New footage widely circulating online on Thursday appears to show a Chinese advanced stealth fighter flying for the first time, which could be a major step forward for Beijing's air force if confirmed. Newsweek has reached out via email to China's Defense Ministry for comment. China has been modernizing all aspects of its military, including its air force. The Pentagon said earlier this month that the Chinese air force and naval aviation together made up the \"largest aviation force in the Indo-Pacific region.\" The Pentagon has also described China and \"its increasingly capable military as the department's top pacing challenge.\" Earlier this month, a senior Defense Department official said China's air force, \"with respect to its modernization and indigenization of its unmanned aerial systems, is quickly approaching U.S. standards.\" On Thursday, open-source intelligence accounts shared videos and photos of an unidentified fighter jet. Several accounts, including one on X (formerly Twitter) by Justin Bronk, a senior research fellow for airpower and military technology at the London-based Royal United Services Institute think tank, floated the idea that the footage could show a prototype sixth-generation fighter jet. It is \"fascinating\" that the Chinese military has \"chosen to fly this prototype in daylight now,\" Bronk said, although he cautioned that the footage could actually show a fifth-generation jet known as JH-XX. The footage shows a Chengdu J-20S fighter, a twin-engine all-weather stealth jet, accompanying the unidentified jet, according to The War Zone, a defense news website. The purported sixth-generation jet took off from the headquarters of the Chengdu Aircraft Corp. in Sichuan province, the site said. Multiple countries are developing sixth-generation fighter jets. U.S. fifth-generation fighters like the F-35 are widely flown, and militaries have for years looked for the next jet waiting in the wings. The U.S. Air Force is in the midst of its Next Generation Air Dominance program, designed to replace the F-22 Raptor stealth jet in the next decade, although the future of the program has been cast in doubt. The U.K., Italy and Japan are working together to make a sixth-generation, crewed aircraft under a project called the Global Combat Air Program. In the British Royal Air Force, the aircraft is referred to as Tempest, which is expected to replace the Typhoon jet in 2035, although London is deep in a strategic defense review of the country's military that could affect the sixth-generation program. Russia has said its fifth-generation Su-57 stealth jet can be fitted with sixth-generation features. While it is not clear whether this is a confirmed first sighting of a Chinese sixth-generation fighter, further information and footage will likely come out in the next months.

                "content": "The first video of a brand new Chinese stealth fighter jet, believed to be a 6th-generation machine, has appeared on social media. The large tail-less fighter is believed to be a strike aircraft. Its unconventional design may make the new stealth fighter jet difficult, if not impossible, to detect using conventional radars. When inducted, these Chinese stealth fighter jets would likely become an unprecedented threat along India's frontiers. India does not have a stealth fighter jet yet. In May, NDTV reported satellite images showed China deployed its most advanced J-20 stealth fighter jets less than 150 km from the boundary with India in Sikkim. India counters the J-20 with its fleet of 36 French-built Rafale fighters. Significantly, Shigatse, where the Chinese J-20 has been spotted, lies less than 290 km from Hasimara in West Bengal, where India bases its second squadron of 16 Rafales. The Chengdu J-20, also known as the Mighty Dragon, is a twin-engine stealth fighter introduced into service in 2017. Some reports suggest China may already have deployed as many as 250 of the stealth fighters which are difficult to observe by radar.

                "content": "All of today's best Boxing Day deals picked by the experts When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. There's perhaps no single day of the year that's better for bagging a bargain on in-demand tech in the UK than Boxing Day (aside from, you know... Black Friday). This year's Boxing Day is no exception as several of the nation's best retailers have launched wide-ranging sales tailor-made for those looking to spend their Christmas spending money. As TechRadar's deals editor, I've covered the Boxing Days sales for over three years now so I've got plenty of tips and know-how to share with our readers. I've been busy searching Amazon, Currys, John Lewis, and many other retailers to find record-low prices on tech that we've tested and loved here at TechRadar. You'll find my definitive list of the 36 best deals in the Boxing Day sales below, including laptops, TVs, headphones, and many more popular categories with our readers. While it's hard to pick favourites, today's highlights include the excellent LG B4 OLED TV for just £749, the Apple AirPods Pro 2 for £179, and the superb Nikon Z6 III camera for just £1,999. These are all record-low prices on top models here on-site so they get an easy recommendation - although there's plenty more to check out below. The Sony WH-1000MX4 are older now but they are still some of the best over-ear headphones ever. These wireless Sony cans package together top-notch audio, excellent comfort, and effective noise cancellation all at a reasonable price point that's about £70 less than the newer Sony XM5 that are only a minor upgrade. We still rate these as the best headphones for most people because you can find them at a price like this during major sales. The latest wearable in Fitbit's range of dedicated fitness trackers has dropped back to its cheapest price in the current Amazon sale - just in time for that new year fitness push. It's a small but welcome £40 saving on a device we found lighter, prettier and smarter compared to the previous version in our Fitbit Charge 6 review. Key features include a seven-day battery life, onboard GPS and GLONASS, sleep tracking, smart wake, SpO2 blood oxygen tracking and all the other features the excellent Charge 5 offered. This entry-level electric toothbrush is a solid pickup while it's less than half price in Amazon's latest sale. It doesn't boast many impressive high-end features but it has the basic ones you really need to brush your teeth effectively and efficiently, including a two-minute timer and a visible pressure sensor. Plus, you get a handy carry case included for free. The Shark Stratos has all you could need from a vacuum cleaner and at a very good price after this huge discount. It has a cartridge system which protects against dust cup odours that always come alongside pet hair and dander. Its Clean Sense IQ technology knows when to adjust the power and you won’t have to worry about hair getting trapped and wrapped up in the brush-roll. Meanwhile, 60 minutes of runtime should suit most homes. Amazon's last-minute deals sale has the top-rated Blink Video Doorbell on sale for £29.99 – which matches the record-low price. The Blink Video Doorbell is a cheap and easy way to get alerts to your phone when motion is detected or when guests are at your door. It features infrared night video, long-lasting battery life, compatibility with other smart devices and displays, and two-way audio to speak to visitors. Here's a strong saving on some of the best bone conduction headphones for runners that we've tried thanks to their impressive audio quality, comfortable fit and safety features. The Shokz OpenRun offer an eight-hour battery life, but you can also fast-charge them for ten minutes before going for a run in order to grab a full 90 minutes of juice. The Fire HD 8 tablet is unlikely to make it into our list of the best tablets but if you're after a cheap tablet that does the basics well, then you'll be more than satisfied. It's not the most powerful device but this cheap and durable tablet lasts up to 13 hours, making it good for light use and watching videos. It's still at its Black Friday price - but not for long. I'm sneaking this one into my tech roundup as it's an excellent late gift idea for the puzzle fan in your life. Much like the Wordles, Heardles and Connections of the world, you can expect dozens of bite-sized puzzles in this collection. Each one asks you to solve silly and increasingly elaborate crimes by using the clues to eliminate suspects, weapons and locations in a strange but compelling mix of Cluedo and Sudoku. This is an excellent low price for Google's previous generation flagship phone that boasts some smart AI features in the heart of the phone and improves how you experience it. It is for this reason that the Pixel 8 Pro tops our new list of the best AI phones. The 6.7-inch display is as good as the iPhone 15 Pro Max and the camera is equally impressive. The phone will also fix any of your past Google Photos, even if they were taken with a different phone. All that, plus a free Fitbit, make this an excellent deal. New record-low price: The LG B4 may be the entry level OLED in LG's 2024 TV lineup, but it delivers spectacular picture quality with rich contrast and fine details, along with a wealth of gaming features including 4K, 120Hz, Dolby Vision gaming, VRR and more. Available for the first time in 48-inches, this deal takes the newest size down to a record low of under £700 -- easily the cheapest way to get a 2024 OLED TV! Lenovo IdeaPad 3: was £399 now £249 at Currys Display - 15.6-inches Processor - Intel Core i3 RAM - 8GB Storage - 128GB I usually recommend Chromebooks for those on a tight budget but I think this Lenovo IdeaPad 3 is a surprisingly decent low-cost Windows 11 choice. Sure, it's not a world beater but you are getting 8Gb of RAM and a Core i3 chipset here, which are enough to cover the basics. Generally speaking, these specs won't carry you far but they'll work if you're simply going to use your laptop for writing documents, streaming shows, or answering emails. Samsung Galaxy Book4 Edge: was £849 now £599 at Currys Display - 15.6-inches Processor - Snapdragon X Plus RAM - 8GB Storage - 256GB I don't think I've ever seen a laptop with the fancy new Snapdragon X Plus chipset go for cheaper than this Samsung at Currys - and by quite a stretch, actually. At £600, this is an absolute bargain price for a laptop that's tailor-made for powerful performance and industry-leading battery life. This is a particularly strong option if you want a MacBook but can't quite make the budget stretch - although you do only get a relatively small 256GB storage drive here. Asus Vivobook 15: was £849 now £599 at Currys Display - 15.6-inch OLED Processor - Intel Ultra 5 RAM - 16GB Storage - 512GB Currys is knocking it out the park with its mid-range laptop deals this Boxing Day - case in point: this Asus Vivobook 15. You're getting a massive £250 discount here on a machine that's not only loaded-up with 16GB of RAM and a brand-new Ultra 5 chipset, but also a stunning 3K OLED display. For £600? This is a good performer that's great for consuming all types of media. Recommended. I've seen a lot of people talk about and use Loop earplugs lately so if you want to see what the fuss is all about then this entry-level pair is down to a record-low price. Use them to block out noise on a commute, help you focus in the office, protect your ears from loud music at bars or concerts, or help you create a better environment for sleep. They're reusable and can last for up to five years so a good investment if you'll be a regular user. This compact capsule coffee machine is incredibly easy to use, virtually mess-free, and comes bundled with a handy milk-frother for lattes and cappuccinos. The set usually sells for around £130 at Amazon but has now hit a record-low price in the Boxing Day sales. Even though the console has only just come out, EE has already taken £40 off the brand-new PS5 Pro. What's more, if you have an existing PS5 to trade in, you can get up to another £260 off, bringing the price to as little as £399. The upgraded PS5 Pro boasts greater power over the base console, enabling select games to look better and run smoother. Plus, there's 2TB of storage included, which is double the amount in the standard PS5. Just know, though, that this console doesn't have a disc drive so you'll need to buy all of your games digitally on the PS Store – or buy the PS5 Disc Drive accessory and attach it to the console to play physical games. This beats the discount we saw last year by £20 on the latest generation Apple AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C support. As well as that more universal connection option, Apple's newest premium earbuds come with sought-after improvements to audio quality and noise cancellation. In our AirPods Pro 2 review, we said that these upgrades ensured they were a big step up compared to the originals and helped them truly compete with other high-end buds. This MSI Cyborg is a strong contender for gaming laptop deal of the day over at Currys thanks to its solid line-up of an RTX 4060 graphics card, Intel Core i7 chipset, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB SSD. Put together, these are great specs for 1080p gaming and today's massive £200 price cut easily makes this one of the best bang for the buck machines going currently. Recommended. Here's a great deal on a cheap 4K TV that's even cheaper than Black Friday. A £50 saving might not seem like much, but this TCL 55V6BK was already sitting cheap at £300 considering it supports 4K resolution, HDR 10, and comes with Android TV built-in for easy streaming. Don't expect an incredible picture here or super speedy gaming performance, but for a budget option - solid. This budget tablet has been hovering around the £100 mark for a few weeks now but Amazon has just issued a brand-new record-low price on the Honor Pad X8a. We haven't reviewed the 'a' version of this tablet, but we have reviewed the standard X8 and found it to be a solid budget choice. This is a slightly upgraded version with more RAM, a bigger battery, and a more powerful chipset. In short, it's just a way better tablet and one that's likely to stack-up well against the other budget options from Amazon and Samsung in this price range. Breville sandwich maker: was £35 now £25 at AmazonA Christmas gifting classic - who hasn't given or received a Breville sandwich maker at some point? Right now, this well-loved appliance is sitting at the cheapest price all year at Amazon - cheaper than on Black Friday, in fact. There's not much to say here - this is just a great deal on a solid appliance that's perfect for warming and toasting all kinds of breads, sandwiches, and paninis. Throw out that crusty old kettle and get great results every time with this Ninja Black Perfect Temperature Kettle. Featuring rapid boil and six different settings, this appliance is a must-have if you're serious about getting the perfect brew every time. As the name suggests, the Fire TV Stick 4K streams shows and movies on your TV in ultra-high 4K resolution. It's a good offer for a solid streaming stick that comes with access to all the major apps and supports voice controls through Alexa. Be aware, though, that the previous generation version has been as low as £22.99 before - but that was almost three years ago. Chances of seeing that price again are slim as this discount seems to be the new normal for the upgrade streaming stick and the old version has been discontinued from sale.

This gift card will give you more than enough to pick up a popular AAA game like Marvel's Spider-Man 2 or a good few months of PS Plus. Here's a great option if you're looking for a relatively cheap Windows laptop in this year's Boxing Day sakes. With a 12th gen Intel Core i5 chipset, 8GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD, you're getting good specs for basic computing tasks with this Asus Zenbook. The main selling point for this model, however, is the 2.4k resolution display and slick lightweight 14-inch form-factor, which makes it great if you need something portable. Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra: free Chromebook with contract at Mobiles.co.ukThe phones retailer Mobiles.co.uk is throwing in a free Samsung ChromeBook Go with specific Galaxy S24 Ultra contracts this week - a pretty damn good bundle deal if you were thinking about upgrading. While not all of the retailer's plans are eligible for the freebie here (it's mostly ID Mobile and Vodafone options), the laptop is still worth about £250 by itself. Certain plans also come with free Galaxy Buds3 also so be on the lookout for those. It's rare to find such a big 50-inch inch 4K TV for under £259 so this Hisense A6N is an easy recommendation - even if it isn't a world-beating set. You won't get an amazing picture here, or high-end gaming performance but this Hisense will get you streaming 4K content with Dolby Vision and HDR10+ support for a great price. Again, worth a look if you're on a budget this December. The Galaxy Z Fold 6 isn't a device for everyone - it is, after all, incredibly expensive. With that said, today's deal at the EE Store cuts a whopping £730 off this device via cashback - which is a stunning deal considering this is for an unlocked device. Even better still, you don't need to trade-in for this particular promotion, unlike with other similar discounts at the major networks and Samsung itself. This Asus Vivobook laptop has just hit a new record-low price at Very. At just £749, this high-end laptop is an absolute steal considering you get a 3K OLED display, powerful Ryzen 9 processor, 16GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD. While it's not a cheap laptop by any stretch of the imagination, this one will have no issues powering through most tasks with its superb chipset and gorgeous OLED display. If you're looking for a slightly bigger smart home display, Amazon has the latest Echo Show 8 on sale for £94.99. That's back to the record-low price I saw during Black Friday. The eight-inch display allows you to make calls, watch movies, check the weather, and control compatible smart home devices completely hands-free thanks to Alexa compatibility. The addition of room-filling spatial audio gives a big boost to all of these features to improve sound quality. The iPad 10.2 is a little older model but it remains a great deal at this discounted price ahead of Boxing Day. The 10.2-inch Retina display and A13 Bionic chip ensure excellent picture quality and superior performance to this day. If you need an entry-level slate for web browsing, streaming videos, light admin work or playing basic games then this can do it all without issue. Right now, when it comes to powerful and affordable tablets that offer excellent value for money, nothing else can beat the Apple iPad 10.2 at this price. The Ninja Double Stack is a great-looking air fryer packed with key features. It has a capacity of 7.6 litres across the two baskets with six preset functions and two independent cooking zones. Its functions include roasting, baking, and dehydrating, so there’s something for every cooking plan here. It cooks up to 55% faster than your fan oven so it’s a great money and timesaver. TechRadar's top camera of 2024, the Nikon Z6 III, is available with an incredible £700 price cut at Jessops right now. This fantastic mirrorless camera was just released a few months ago and features an impressive 24.5MP full-frame partially stacked sensor with vastly improved autofocus and 6K video up to 60fps. Our Nikon Z6 III review awarded this excellent camera a full five stars out of five, which feels like excellent value now with this incredible record-low price. PSVR 2 is an incredible VR headset for PS5, and it's since been updated to work on PC. This bundle featuring Horizon: Call of the Mountain is the same price as the headset by itself at a new record-low price, so this is the version I'd recommend if you want the most bang for your buck. Especially as the accompanying game is a killer app for PSVR 2. Display - 13.6 inchesProcessor - Apple M2RAM - 8GBStorage - 256GB As suspected, with Apple bumping up the base memory of the MacBook Air M2 and M3 to 16GB, retailers are cutting the prices of their existing stock of models with 8GB. While not the most powerful MacBook out there, this version with the M2 chip remains an excellent all-rounder, especially when it comes to day-to-day tasks like browsing the internet and writing up documents. For this new low price, you'll struggle to find a better value laptop than this, even if there's less memory than I'd like to see.

According to The Independent’s tech critic David Phelan, these are among the best earbuds and offer a “significant improvement over the already-splendid first-generation model”. Noise-cancelling is twice as good; you get six hours on a single charge, rather than five; there are touch controls on the buds themselves, so you can adjust the volume without having to take your phone out of your pocket, and there’s a MagSafe case with a lanyard loop for easy charging and storage. Now reduced to their lowest-ever price, trust me, you don’t want to miss this post-Christmas deal. If Santa didn’t leave a Dyson airwrap under the tree, fear not, as Boots is offering a stellar (and rare) saving on the cult tool for Boxing Day. Available in a limited edition strawberry blush hue, the airwrap boasts six attachments, from two barrels to a coanda smoothing dryer, a round volumising bristle brush, a flat brush and a diffuser. Helping you create super sleek curly styles with the barrels and a voluminous bouncy look thanks to the brushes, there are endless styling options. It’s a non-negotiable in my own routine while beauty tester Louise thought the same, with the tool earning a spot in her round-up of the best hot brushes. Since this affordable Ninja air fryer entered my kitchen, meal times have never been easier. Proving that air fryers don’t have to dominate your kitchen counter space, this design is sleek and space-saving. Better yet, it comes with a 30 per cent discount at Currys. It also received rave reviews from tester Lauren, was noted that despite “using up to 75 per cent less fat than traditional frying methods, you still get a good crunch. Its generous 3.8l basket can fit a medium-sized chicken and allows you to air fry, roast, reheat and dehydrate”. What more could you want? Taking the top spot in IndyBest’s guide to the best winter duvets, this 15-tog design from Dunelm now has 20 per cent off. “Cosy and luxurious, this duvet guarantees winter-ready warmth,” said assistant eCommerce editor Sarah when she put the duvet to the test. “While it is synthetic, it is incredibly plush and soft with a down-like feel and has the classic rustle sound you’d expect from a natural filling. Plus, because it’s made with polyester, it’s suitable for anyone looking to avoid feathers.” You can also save on the design in single, king and super king sizes. Want to upgrade your cookware? Save 40 per cent on the price of this chic Le Creuset casserole dish, which is reduced in both the navy and grey mist colourways at John Lewis.

Even better, the sturdy cast iron design comes with Le Creuset’s lifetime guarantee – what’s not to love? While this isn’t a saving on the mattress itself, Simba is offering free items with selected mattresses. So, if you’re moving home or really want to invest in your sleep, this could be a great way to save money. For example, if you purchase the hybrid luxe, you’ll also receive two hybrid pillows, a hybrid duvet and a performance mattress protector for free, saving you £766 if you were to purchase them separately. The mattress also comes IndyBest-approved, as it took the top spot in our round-up, where sleep expert Sarah Jones praised the hybrid luxe for providing “decent support”, being “breathable” and “naturally temperature-regulating”. Treat yourself to a little pick me up with this duo of Glossier’s bestselling lip balms.

Our resident IndyBest electric toothbrush tester Steve named this the best model in his review, the Oral-B Pro 3 combines great cleaning performance with a budget-friendly price compared to rival brushes. The Oral-B Pro 3 is discounted to around £50 fairly regularly, so this Boxing Day deal might be your last chance to catch it at its cheapest price this year. One of my favourite beauty cleansers, Elemis’s pro-collagen cleansing balm has reached cult status for very good reason. It even landed a spot in beauty expert Louise’s review of the best cleansing balms, in which she noted, after she’d removed the product from her face, her skin “felt soft and smooth, with a subtle glow that you often find after having a facial. From start to finish, the experience is a luxurious treat”. I’m restocking while the formula is on sale, to give my skin some TLC ahead of the new year. Samsung’s smart ring tracks your health metrics around the clock, offering you wellness tips and insights into your activity, stress levels and sleep quality without the need to wear a watch. When tech critic Alex reviewed the Galaxy Ring review, he said it has “one of the best design choices we’ve seen for a smart ring”. Now, I’ve spotted a major £80 discount at Currys for Boxing Day. The end-of-year sales are one of the best times to upgrade your phone, particularly when there are deals like this one from iD Mobile at Carphone Warehouse. The 100GB plan on the Apple iPhone 16 has you paying just £99 up front and then £39.99 per month. That’s a total of £959.76 over the course of the 24-month plan (mid-contract price bumps not included).

The vertuo pop is Nespresso’s most affordable coffee machine – and, naturally, it’s been tried and tested by the team at IndyBest. Spoiler alert: Lauren loved it. Now, you can invest for nearly half price thanks to John Lewis. Receiving a glowing five-star review, she praised the “small but mighty” machine that will slot seamlessly into most people’s kitchen countertops. “Weighing in at just 3.5kg, if you have a large cupboard and won’t be using the machine every day, it’s also incredibly easy to store away until you need it,” she added. I love the colours available, too, with the blue and yellow brightening up your kitchen surfaces. This cult brand’s hoodies were rated highly in my review of the best blanket hoodies, where I found the oversized hoodie to be cocooning and warming. Complete with a hood, sleeves and practical front pouch, the hoodie is finished in a plush soft-to-touch flannel fleece with sherpa fleece lining the inside. Large enough to curl beneath it on the sofa but still sufficiently fitted and lightweight to move around the house while working from home, the Oodie is a saviour when temperatures plummet. Right now, you can pick one up for less than £30. “If you’re looking for a sleep tracker, activity tracker or just want to know as much as you can about your body, then the gen 3 Oura ring will tick a lot of your boxes, in one tiny package,” Kat said in her review of the fitness device. With six different coloured rings available (from silver to gold), it’s a more stylish choice than a Fitbit or Garmin. When Kat tested the device out, she was impressed with its battery life and sleep insights, as well as fertility and period tracking. Right now, the Oura gen3 ring is the cheapest I’ve ever seen at Amazon. Run, don’t walk. Apple’s nifty AirTag trackers haven’t been this cheap in years. “For any iPhone owner prone to losing things, investing in a pack of four might be one of the best decisions you ever make,” tech wizard Alex wrote in his review of the best key finders. “Precision tracking works wonderfully well when you can get a signal, and the fact it’s powered by removable batteries is a real bonus.” A must-have for travel in 2025, add these to your basket pronto. Right now, there’s up to 50 per cent off a range of jewellery at Missoma, including these molten hoop earrings. Providing a subtle twist on the classic hoop style, this pair is made with 18ct gold plated vermeil on sterling silver and comes complete with butterfly closures. Whether you’re looking to refresh your everyday ear stack or want something to complete your New Year’s Eve look, this goes-with-everything pair is now less than £60. One of the top names in coffee makers, Delonghi features in home appliance tester Zoe’s review of the best coffee machines. Here’s a deal on a more compact model at Currys, which offers a simple bean-to-cup extraction thanks to its 13-setting burr grinder and one-touch operation. I’ve just moved house, so this is the perfect choice for my smaller kitchen – it’s gone straight in my basket. IndyBest writer Lois loved Our Place’s always pan when she tested it, owing to its non-stick abilities and how it’s made from “post-consumer recycled aluminium”. She also liked the “satisfaction from cooking on such an uncannily smooth surface”. I’ve got the spice colourway in the always pan and can confirm it’s just as enjoyable to display as it is to cook with. With five hues to choose from, you can tailor it to your kitchen interiors. Here’s a £275 saving on the MacBook Air from 2020, which is still a powerful, versatile and lightweight laptop with an impressive all-day battery life. This festive deal at Laptops Direct sees Apple’s best-selling laptop reduced to just £650 for Boxing Day. The post-Christmas sales are prime time to give your interiors a refresh. Case in point, the mega Dusk sale, where you can save an extra 15 per cent right now with the code “FLASH15”. This Hampshire style secured a spot in our round-up of tried and tested corner sofas, where our reviewer named it the best traditional-style chaise sofa. “Dusk’s Hampshire chaise sofa is a triumph of both form and function – and, as with all of the brand’s offerings, it is enticingly affordable, given its high quality,” they said. Now, you can save more than £400 – and I’m sold. One of my favourite budget make-up buys, Maybelline’s New York sensational sky high mascara is even more affordable thanks to this Amazon deal. Boasting a uniquely designed brush that’s long, thin and densely packed with tiny little plastic bristles, it’s ideal for getting to hard-to-reach areas and easy to manoeuvre with minimal mess. When assistant eCommerce editor Sarah reviewed the mascara, she raved about the tiny bristles that line the wand, which she found “helped comb through each and every lash – yes, even those pesky ones right in the corner”. You can pick it up for just £7 right now. Audiobook subscription service Audible is currently just 99p per month for three months for Amazon Prime subscribers who’ve never had Audible before (or haven’t been a member in the past 12 months). Whether walking the dog or doing the washing up, you can listen to thousands of select Audible Originals, podcasts, and audiobooks (personal favourites include Miriam Margolyes’s This Much is True and Barbara Kingsolver’s Demon Copperhead). Once your trial period comes to an end, an Audible subscription will cost £7.99 each month, which will pay for one audiobook (each month) as well as the above. The offer will end on 21 January 2025, so, you’ve still got plenty of time to subscribe, even after the Boxing Day sales end. Touted as the world’s best massage device, the Theragun Pro is the brand’s most advanced massage gun – and it’s now discounted in the Boxing Day sales. With a second-generation proprietary EQ-150 motor, it’s 20 per cent quieter than its predecessors, easy to hold and looks incredibly sleek. Use it to release tension and knots, speed up your post-workout recovery and improve your mobility. Here’s to a healthier 2025. Ugg’s mini boots are now reduced in the Boxing Day sales. Made from soft sheepskin, the stacked sole style is favoured by the likes of our fashion writers, Hailey Bieber and the Hadid sisters. Perfect for cosy days indoors or out, save £50 on the classic boots while the discount lasts. Crafted from Skims’ signature modal ribbed fabric, this is the dress that goes with everything. Soft and comfortable in a minimalist full-length silhouette, it’s perfect for any occasion – whether you plan to be lounging at home, heading out for lunch or throwing a party. With a classic crew neck and slight racer back and front, it’s now 50 per cent off in the Boxing Day sales. Once upon a time, the Boxing Day sales lasted for one day only, and bargain hunters would have to get out bright and early to secure the goods. These days, however, the sale event runs through January, so there’s no need to rush. Don’t be fooled by the name, the Boxing Day sales are not really much different to the January sales that follow. The name may change when 1 January swings around, but the deals continue. From 26 December to 31 January, you’ll find the same products discounted, and often, the price will continue to drop even lower as we move through January. If you’re looking for something in particular, though, such as a piece of clothing in your size or a highly sought-after piece of tech, it may be worth making your purchase as soon as you spot a discount as sale items are not always replenished. It would be totally understandable if you believed that Boxing Day is named after the sport – we all heard the tales in our youth. But, Boxing Day’s origins couldn’t be more different to a match in the ring. Most historians today agree that Boxing Day stems back to Queen Victoria’s reign when the rich were Looking for moe bargains?

                "title": "Jimmy Butler - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Jimmy Butler III (born September 14, 1989) is an American professional basketball player for the Miami Heat of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Nicknamed \"Jimmy Buckets\", he is a six-time NBA All-Star, a five-time All-NBA Team member, and a five-time NBA All-Defensive Team member. He won a gold medal as a member of the 2016 U.S. Olympic team. Butler played one year of college basketball for Tyler Junior College before transferring to Marquette University. He was selected with the 30th overall pick in the 2011 NBA draft by the Chicago Bulls. In 2015, he was named the NBA Most Improved Player. After six seasons in Chicago, he was traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves in June 2017, and was then again traded in November 2018, this time to the Philadelphia 76ers. In July 2019, he signed with the Heat. During his first season with the team, Butler reached the NBA Finals. In 2021, he led the league in steals. In 2023, Butler and the eighth-seeded Heat played in the 2023 NBA Finals, their second appearance in four years.[1][2] Butler was born in Houston on September 14, 1989.[3][4] His father, Jimmy Butler Jr., left the family when Butler was an infant. When he was 13 years old and living in the Houston suburb of Tomball, his mother kicked him out of the house. As Butler remembered it in a 2011 interview, she told him, \"I don't like the look of you. You gotta go.\" He moved between the homes of various friends, staying for a few weeks at a time before moving to another house.[5] Butler maintains a relationship with his parents, saying, \"I don't hold grudges. I still talk to my family. My mom. My father. We love each other. That's never going to change.\"[6][7] In a summer basketball league before his senior year at Tomball High School, he was noticed by Jordan Leslie, a freshman football and basketball player at the school, who challenged him to a three-point shooting contest. The two became friends, and Butler stayed at Leslie's house for a few months, Leslie's mother and stepfather had six other children between them. Butler would later say, \"They accepted me into their family. And it wasn't because of basketball. She [Michelle Lambert, Leslie's mother] was just very loving. She just did stuff like that. I couldn't believe it.\"[5] As a junior at Tomball High, Butler averaged 10 points per game. As a senior and team captain in 2006–07, Butler averaged 19.9 points and 8.7 rebounds per game and was subsequently voted his team's most valuable player. Butler was not recruited coming out of high school and chose to attend Tyler Junior College in Tyler, Texas. After his freshman season at Tyler Junior College, where he had averaged 18.1 points, 7.7 rebounds, and 3.1 assists per game, Butler received interest from Division I programs. Considered a two-star recruit by 247Sports.com,[8] he was listed as the No. 127 junior college prospect in 2008.[9] Butler accepted an athletic scholarship to attend Marquette, where, as a sophomore in the 2008–09 season, he averaged 5.6 points and 3.9 rebounds per game and recorded a free-throw percentage of 76.8%. He moved into the starting lineup as a junior during the 2009–10 season to average 14.7 points and 6.4 rebounds per game and received All-Big East Honorable Mention honors. Butler had two game-winning shots versus UConn and St. John's, to help Marquette finish 11–7 in the Big East and earn its fifth consecutive NCAA tournament appearance. As a senior in 2010–11, he averaged 15.7 points per game and received All-Big East Honorable Mention for the second straight year. Butler was selected with the 30th overall pick in the 2011 NBA draft by the Chicago Bulls.[10] He played 42 games during the lockout-shortened 2011–12 season.[11] The following season, he played all 82 games for the Bulls. Butler played limited minutes to begin the 2012–13 season. His minutes increased over the second half of the season and he started in all 12 playoff games.[11][12] In an April 9, 2013, regular season game, Butler scored a then career-high 28 points in a 101–98 loss against the Toronto Raptors.[11][13] Two days later, he recorded his first NBA double-double game with 22 points and a then career-high 14 rebounds against the New York Knicks.[11] In the 2013–14 season, Butler missed 15 games due to injury, he played in 67 games.[11] He averaged a career-high 38.7 minutes per game, which ranked first in the NBA.[11] He scored a season-high 26 points against the Memphis Grizzlies on December 30.[11] He set a franchise record when he played 60:20 in a triple-overtime game against the Orlando Magic on January 15 and finished with 21 points, seven rebounds and six assists.[11] At the season's end, he was named to the NBA All-Defensive Second Team.[14] On November 25, 2014, Butler tied a career high with 32 points in a loss to the Denver Nuggets.[15] On December 3, 2014, he was named the Eastern Conference Player of the Month for games played in October/November.[16] He set a new career high of 35 points in a 103–97 win over the New York Knicks on December 18.[17] On January 29, 2015, Butler was named a reserve for the Eastern Conference in the 2015 NBA All-Star Game.[18] On March 2, 2015, he was ruled out for three to six weeks with a left elbow injury.[19] He returned to play on March 23 against the Charlotte Hornets, recording 19 points and 9 rebounds in a 98–86 win.[20] On April 20, Butler set a playoff career high for the second straight game, scoring 31 points in the Bulls' 91–82 win over the Milwaukee Bucks to take a 2–0 lead in their first-round series.[21] On April 25, Butler again set a playoff career high with 33 points, in a Bulls' 92–90 loss to the Bucks, holding their series lead to 3–2.[22] They went on to win Game 6 of the series, moving them onto the semi-finals where they lost 4–2 to the Cleveland Cavaliers. On May 7, he was named the 2014–15 NBA Most Improved Player and became the first player in franchise history to win the award.[23] On July 9, 2015, Butler re-signed with the Bulls to a five-year, $95 million contract. The deal included a player option for the fifth year.[24][25] On December 9, he scored a then career-high 36 points in a loss to the Boston Celtics.[26] He topped that mark with 43 points on December 18 in a 147–144 quadruple overtime loss to the Detroit Pistons.[27] On January 3, Butler broke Michael Jordan's team record for points in a half, scoring 40 of his 42 after the break to lead the Bulls to a 115–113 win over the Toronto Raptors.[28] Two days later, he recorded 32 points and a then season-high 10 assists in a 117–106 win over the Milwaukee Bucks.[29] On January 14, he scored a career-high 53 points in a 115–111 overtime win over the Philadelphia 76ers. Butler had 10 rebounds and six assists while making 15-of-30 field goals and 21-of-25 free throws to help the Bulls end a three-game losing streak. He became the first Bulls player to score 50 points since Jamal Crawford in 2004.[30] On February 5, Butler suffered a left knee strain in a game against the Denver Nuggets[31] and missed around four weeks.[32] He was voted to play in the 2016 NBA All-Star Game, but the injury forced him to drop out, and he was subsequently replaced by teammate Pau Gasol.[33] Butler missed 11 games with the knee injury, returning to action for the Bulls on March 5 against the Houston Rockets. In 34 minutes of playing, he recorded 24 points, 11 rebounds, 6 assists and 1 steal in a 108–100 win, helping the Bulls break a four-game losing streak.[34] He returned to the sidelines on March 7 for the team's game against the Milwaukee Bucks due to back soreness and swelling in his left knee.[35] After a three-game absence, he returned to play on March 14 against the Toronto Raptors.[36] On April 2, he recorded his first career triple-double with 28 points and career highs of 17 rebounds and 12 assists in a 94–90 loss to the Detroit Pistons.[37] In the Bulls' season finale on April 13, Butler recorded his second career triple-double with 10 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists in a 115–105 win over the Philadelphia 76ers.[38] In the Bulls' season opener on October 27, Butler scored a team-high 24 points in a 105–99 win over the Boston Celtics.[39] On November 9, he scored 39-points in a 115–107 loss to the Atlanta Hawks.[40] Three days later, he scored 37 points, made all 14 of his free throws, had eight rebounds and a season-high nine assists in a 106–95 win over the Washington Wizards.[41] On November 20, he scored a season-high 40 points in a 118–110 win over the Los Angeles Lakers.[42] The following day, he was named Eastern Conference Player of the Week for games played Monday, November 14 through Sunday, November 20.[43] On December 28, he matched his season-high with 40 points, he hit a 20-footer at the buzzer, scored nine points in the final 21⁄2 minutes, and made all 11 of his free throws, to give the Bulls a 101–99 win over the Brooklyn Nets. Butler ended with 11 rebounds as the Bulls overcame a seven-point deficit in the final three minutes.[44] On January 2, 2017, Butler scored 52 points in a 118–111 win over the Charlotte Hornets. He was a point shy of his career high and scored 20 points in the first half and 17 in the game's final four minutes. He had 12 rebounds and six assists while shooting 21-of-22 from the free-throw line.[45] On January 7, he hit the 40-point mark for the third time in six games, finishing with 42 points in a 123–118 overtime win over the Toronto Raptors.[46] Two days later, he was named Eastern Conference Player of the Week for games played Monday, January 2 through Sunday, January 8.[47] On January 19, Butler was named a starter on the Eastern Conference All-Star team for the 2017 NBA All-Star Game.[48] After questioning the desire of the team's younger players following a loss to the Atlanta Hawks on January 25, Butler was fined and held out of the starting lineup against the Miami Heat on January 27. He finished with three points on 1-for-13 shooting.[49] On February 25, 2017, he recorded his third career triple-double with 18 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists in a 117–99 win over the Cleveland Cavaliers.[50] On March 26, 2017, he had 20 points and a then career-high 14 assists in a 109–94 win over the Milwaukee Bucks.[51] On April 6, 2017, he recorded his fourth career triple-double with 19 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists in a 102–90 win over the Philadelphia 76ers.[52] On June 22, 2017, Butler was traded, along with the rights to Justin Patton (the 16th pick in the 2017 NBA draft), to the Minnesota Timberwolves in exchange for Zach LaVine, Kris Dunn and the rights to Lauri Markkanen (the seventh pick in the 2017 NBA draft).[53] In his debut for the Timberwolves in their season

Western Conference All-Star reserve.[59] On February 9, in his return to Chicago, Butler scored 38 points in a 114–113 loss to the Bulls.[60] Butler chose to not play in the All-Star Game, prioritizing the stretch run of the season and thought the rest would benefit him.[61] In the Timberwolves' first game after the All-Star break, on February 23 against the Houston Rockets, Butler left the game late in the third quarter with a right knee injury.[62] Two days later, he underwent meniscus surgery and was ruled out indefinitely.[63] Butler returned to play on April 6 and scored 18 points in a 113–96 win over the Los Angeles Lakers.[64] In Game 3 of the Timberwolves' first-round playoff series against the Rockets, Butler made four 3-pointers among his 28 points in a 121–105 win.[65] The Timberwolves went on to lose the series in five games.[66] Shortly before training camp in 2018, Butler requested a trade from the Timberwolves,[67] indicating he would not re-sign with the team in the 2019 off-season.[68] A month after requesting this trade, in an October practice of this season, Butler teamed up with third-string players to scrimmage and win against the team's usual starters.[69] When a trade was not achieved prior to the start of the regular season, Butler opted to play for Minnesota in 2018–19.[68] He appeared in 10 of the Timberwolves' first 13 games before being traded in early November.[67][70] On November 12, 2018, Butler was traded, along with Justin Patton, to the Philadelphia 76ers in exchange for Jerryd Bayless, Robert Covington, Dario Šarić and a 2022 second-round draft pick.[71] He made his debut for the 76ers two days later, scoring 14 points in a 111–106 loss to the Orlando Magic.[72] On November 25, he recorded 34 points and 12 rebounds and made a 3-pointer with 2.3 seconds remaining to give the 76ers a 127–125 victory over the Brooklyn Nets.[73] On December 5, he scored a season-high 38 points in a 113–102 loss to the Toronto Raptors.[74] Two days later, he had a second straight 38-point game in a 117–111 win over the Detroit Pistons.[75] On January 29, Butler was shifted to point guard and had 20 points and six assists in a 121–105 win over the Los Angeles Lakers.[76] In Game 1 of the 76ers' first-round playoff series against the Nets, Butler scored a game-high 36 points in a 111–102 loss.[77] In Game 2 of

76ers force a Game 7.[79] In Game 7, he made a layup with 4.2 seconds in the fourth quarter to tie the score at 90–all, but the 76ers eventually lost the game 92–90 following Kawhi Leonard's game-winning buzzer beater.[80] On July 6, 2019, Butler signed with the Miami Heat via a sign and trade with the 76ers in a four-team trade.[81] On December 9, Butler was named Eastern Conference Player of the Week after he averaged 27.5 points, 9.0 rebounds and 8.5 assists per game.[82] On December 10, Butler recorded a then career-high 18 rebounds, along with 20 points and 11 assists in a 135–121 overtime win against the Atlanta Hawks.[83] On January 30, 2020, Butler was named to his fifth NBA All-Star Game.[84] On February 3, Butler scored a season-high 38 points on 14-of-20 shooting from the field, as the Heat beat his former team, the Philadelphia 76ers 137–106.[85] On August 31, in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Semifinals, Butler scored a then playoff career-high 40 points on 13-of-20 shooting from the field in a 115–104 win over the first-seeded Milwaukee Bucks.[86] On September 8, Miami advanced to the next round after Game 5 win, thus completing the upset.[87] The Heat reached the NBA Finals after defeating the Boston Celtics in the Eastern Conference Finals in six games, earning Butler his first finals appearance.[88] In Game 3 of the NBA Finals, Butler finished with 40 points, 11 rebounds, and 13 assists and became the third player in finals history to record a 40+ point triple-double, joining LeBron James (then with Cleveland) in 2015 and Jerry West with the Los Angeles Lakers in 1969.[89] Butler also became the first player to have more points, rebounds and assists in a finals game than James, who finished with 25 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists. In Game 5, Butler had 35 points, 12 rebounds, 11 assists, and 5 steals to become the first player to register 35+ points, 10+ rebounds, 10+ assists and 5+ steals in a finals game. He is also the second player to reach such stats in NBA playoff history after Gary Payton in 2000. Butler became the second player with multiple 30-point triple-doubles in the same finals series, joining James in 2015. He became the sixth player with multiple triple-doubles in a finals series along with James, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Wilt Chamberlain and Draymond Green.[90] The Heat came up short against the Los Angeles Lakers in six games.[91] Butler became only the second player in a finals series to lead his team in points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocks, joining James in 2016. He finished the finals averaging 26.2 points, 8.3 rebounds, 9.8 assists, 2.2 steals and 0.8 blocks per game.[92][93] On February 11, 2021, Butler recorded his 10th career triple-double with 27 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists in the Heat's 101–94 win over the Houston Rockets.[94] On February 18, Butler logged his 13th career triple-double with 13 points, 10 rebounds and 13 assists in a 118–110 win over the Sacramento Kings, becoming the first player in franchise history with three consecutive triple-doubles. Together with teammate Bam Adebayo who posted 16 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists, they became the first pair in league history to register triple-doubles in the same game more than once.[95][96] Butler finished the regular season leading the league in steals with 2.1 steals per game. In the playoffs, the Heat were eliminated in a four-game sweep by the Milwaukee Bucks who would go on to win the NBA Finals. In Game 4, Butler recorded his third career playoff triple-double.[97] On August 7, 2021, Butler was signed to a reported four-year, $184 million contract extension by the Heat.[98][99] On December 28, he recorded 25 points, eight rebounds, and a career-high 15 assists in a 119–112 loss to the Washington Wizards.[100] On January 23, 2022, during a matchup against the Los Angeles Lakers and LeBron James, Butler surpassed James for first place on the Heat all-time triple-doubles list.[101] On February 3, Butler was named a reserve for the 2022 NBA All-Star Game, making it his sixth career All-Star selection.[102] On April 7, Butler and Miami clinched the No. 1 seed in the Eastern Conference. On April 17, during Game 1 of the first round of the playoffs, he logged 21 points, six rebounds, four assists and three steals in a 115–91 win over the Atlanta Hawks.[103] Two days later, he posted a then playoff career-high 45 points along with five rebounds, five assists and zero turnovers in a Game 2 115–105 win. Butler became only the third player in franchise history to have at least 45 points, five assists and five rebounds in a postseason game, joining James and Dwyane Wade. He also became the fifth player since 1978 to have at least 45 points and zero turnovers in an NBA playoff game.[104][105] In Game 4 of the series, on April 24, Butler recorded 36 points, 10 rebounds, four assists and four steals in a 110–86 win.[106] On May 8, in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference Semifinals, Butler recorded 40 points on 13-of-20 shooting from the field in a 116–108 loss to the Philadelphia 76ers.[107] On May 17, in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Finals, Butler posted 41 points (27 in the second half), nine rebounds, five assists, four steals and three blocks in a 118–107 win over the Boston Celtics. He became the first player in NBA postseason history to meet all of those benchmarks since steals and blocks were first recorded in 1974. Butler posted his fifth career playoff game with 40 points on 60 percent shooting, and tied with Charles Barkley for third-most over the last 30 playoffs. The only players that have more such games are James (12) and Shaquille O'Neal (8). Butler also achieved the most 40-point, 5-rebound and 5-assist playoff games in Heat history with three, one more than James and Wade.[108][109] On May 21, Butler injured his right knee and did not play in the second half of Game 3. Despite this, Miami won the game 109–103 and took a 2–1 series lead.[110] In Game 6 of the series, on May 27, Butler scored a playoff career-high 47 points along with nine rebounds, eight assists, and four steals to lead Miami to a 111–103 win and force Game 7. He made 16 of 29 shots, including 4-of-8 from the three-point range and all 11 free throws. Butler's 47 points were the seventh-most in NBA history for a player facing elimination. He also became the first player since Michael Jordan in 1988 to have multiple games of at least 40 points and four steals in the same series.[111][112] The Heat lost the series in seven games, despite Butler's 35-point and nine-rebound outing in a 100–96 loss in a decisive Game 7, where he missed his game-winning three-pointer with 16 seconds left in the game.[113][114] Butler had his eighth 30-point game of the postseason, making it the most in a single postseason by a Heat player since James in 2013, who also had eight such games.[115][116] On November 10, 2022, Butler scored a season-high 35 points, along with 10 rebounds and eight assists in an 117–112 overtime win over the Charlotte Hornets. He scored eight consecutive Heat points at the end of regulation just to get them into the extra session.[117] On December 2, Butler returned to the lineup after missing the previous seven games with a sore right knee. He had a season-high 15 rebounds and 25 points in a 120–116 overtime win over the reigning Eastern Conference champions Boston Celtics.[118] On January 10, 2023, Butler tied his season-high with 35 points, along with seven rebounds, four assists, four steals and three blocks in an 112–111 win over the Oklahoma City Thunder. He led the way going 23-of-23 from the free throw line, tying Dominique Wilkins for the second-most made free throws without a miss in NBA history. The Heat set an NBA record by making all 40 of their free throws, the last of those coming on Butler's three-point play with 12.9 seconds left in the game.[119] On February 10, Butler made a game-winning alley-oop dunk in a 97–95 win over the Houston Rockets.[120] On March 11, Butler scored a season-high 38 points, including 15 in the final six minutes of the fourth quarter when Miami overcame a 15-point deficit.

He and Max Strus became the third Heat duo with 30 points apiece in a playoff or play-in game.[123] In Game 1 of the Heat's first round playoff series against the top-seeded Milwaukee Bucks, Butler recorded 35 points, 5 rebounds, 11 assists and three steals in a 130–117 win to lead the Heat to a 1–0 series lead.[124] He moved to second place in 35+ point playoff games in Heat franchise history (10), surpassing LeBron James (9) and trailing only Dwyane Wade (14).[125] In Game 4 of the Heat's playoff series against the Bucks, Butler scored a career-high 56 points on 19-for-28 shooting from the field and 15-of-18 shooting from the free throw line, including a franchise-record 22 points in the first quarter, in a 119–114 win.[126] His 56 points also set a Miami Heat franchise record for the most points scored in a playoff game, surpassing LeBron James' previous record of 49.[127][128][129] In Game 5 of the series against the Bucks, Butler recorded 42 points, eight rebounds, four assists and two steals in a 128–126 overtime win, leading the Heat to the second round of the playoffs. He also became the first player in Heat history to put up back-to-back 40-point playoff games and also put up his eighth 40-point playoff game as a member of the Heat, surpassing Dwyane Wade's previous Heat franchise record of seven 40-point playoff games. In Games 4 and 5, Butler amassed a total of 98 points, becoming one of five players in NBA playoff history to produce that many points in a two-game span. He joined Michael Jordan (who accomplished the feat on three occasions), Jerry West, Elgin Baylor and Rick Barry.

The two have vacationed in Paris together.[151] Butler became a fan of soccer during the 2016 Summer Olympics, after watching Neymar Jr. play for Brazil. He cites Paris Saint Germain as his favorite team and Neymar as his favorite player.[152] [153] Butler and his girlfriend have two children.[154] He did not make his Heat debut until the fourth game of the 2019–20 NBA season, as he was on paternity leave after the birth of his first child.[155] In the NBA Bubble, Butler opened Big Face Coffee, a side business which he operated out of his hotel room using his French press coffee brewer, charging $20 per cup.[156] A year later, he officially launched his coffee brand, and planned to dedicate his time into the coffee roastery business post-retirement.[157] During the 2023 NBA playoffs, Butler filed a trademark on the name \"Himmy Butler\" for the purpose of launching his own clothing and beverage brand. The nickname \"Himmy\" came from the meme phrase \"he's him\", which rose in popularity during the Heat's Butler-led run during that postseason.[158][159] Butler is a Christian.[160] Butler is featured in the Netflix documentary series, \"Starting 5\", which followed Butler, Anthony Edwards, LeBron James, Domantas Sabonis, and Jayson Tatum through the 2023–24 NBA season and playoffs.[161] Butler's father died on February 8, 2024.[162]",

                "title": "Jimmy Butler trade rumors: Heat president Pat Riley insists team won't move star despite reported preference - CBSSports.com",
                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Heat president Pat Riley said Thursday that his team has no plans to trade Jimmy Butler, despite swirling rumors. \"We usually don't comment on rumors, but all this speculation has become a distraction to the team and is not fair to the players and coaches,\" Riley said in a statement posted on the team's social media. \"Therefore, we will make it clear - We are not trading Jimmy Butler.\" The forceful statement comes a day after ESPN's Shams Charania reported that Butler, a six-time NBA All-Star and two-time Eastern Conference champion, would prefer to be traded by the Miami Heat ahead of the February trade deadline. Butler has reportedly not made a formal trade request to the Heat, but is ready to move on from Miami, and Charania reported earlier in December that the Heat are open to making a deal. Butler has a player option for the 2025-26 season that he has informed teams he intends to decline, according to Charania, allowing him to become an unrestricted free agent after the season. He could have negotiated a long-term extension with the Heat before these rumors gained any steam, but Miami was hesitant, according to Pat Riley at his end-of-season press conference last spring, due to Butler's limited availability. Butler has never played more than 58 games in a regular season for the Heat. The only team with significant cap space this offseason, as of this writing, is the Brooklyn Nets. The Nets are in the middle of a rebuild and are not expected to pursue an older, big-name free agent in the near future. That means for Butler to get the long-term contract he's seeking, he'd have to get traded now, so that a team that wants to keep him has his Bird Rights in the offseason. He reportedly prefers a win-now contender, with teams such as the Houston Rockets, Dallas Mavericks, Golden State Warriors and Phoenix Suns reportedly on his wishlist. Both the Heat and Butler's camp have denied that a trade request has been made, according to Ira Winderman of the Sun-Sentinel. While this does not directly contradict Charania's reporting, which also states that a formal request has not been made, it should be noted that Butler's agent, Bernie Lee, has pushed back heavily on Charania's prior reporting on Butler trade rumors. In a series of tweets, he called Charania's reporting \"complete and utter made up bulls---\" and that \"all this is fabricated.\" The Miami Herald added that \"according to a source, Butler was also disappointed that the Heat did not publicly deny a Dec. 10 ESPN report that Miami was open to trading him.\" The team has now done just that. The Heat are 14-13 thus far this season. They have been a Play-In Tournament team in each of the past two seasons, including when they made their run to the 2023 NBA Finals. According to Charania, they are ready to lean into the rising, younger core of Tyler Herro and Bam Adebayo, and given their history of retooling quickly, they could potentially use the return on a Butler deal to kickstart whatever the next era of Heat basketball turns out to be. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive.

                "title": "Todd McLellan - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Todd Andrew McLellan (born October 3, 1967) is a Canadian professional ice hockey coach and former player who currently serves as head coach of the Detroit Red Wings of the National Hockey League (NHL). He previously served as head coach of the San Jose Sharks, Edmonton Oilers, and Los Angeles Kings, and as an assistant coach with the Red Wings, with whom he won the Stanley Cup in 2008. He was drafted in 1986 by the New York Islanders and played five games with the major league club in the 1987–88 season before retiring in the minors the following season due to recurring injury. After living in Goodeve, Saskatchewan, and Melville, Saskatchewan, during his childhood, McLellan started his playing career with the Saskatoon Blades of the Western Hockey League (WHL) from 1983 to 1987. In the 1986 NHL Entry Draft, he was drafted by the New York Islanders in the fifth round. He played a total of five games at the NHL level, spending most of two seasons with the Islanders' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Springfield Indians. However, recurring shoulder injuries dating back to his junior hockey days ended McLellan's North American playing career after the 1988–89 season. He scored his only NHL goal on his league debut on December 28, 1987, in a 6-4 loss to the New Jersey Devils. He returned home to study at the University of Saskatchewan for a year, before resuming his playing career for S.IJ. Utrecht of the Eredivisie in the Netherlands. During his three seasons there, the team hired a new coach, who moved in with McLellan and made him a player-coach, which McLellan recognizes as why he became interested in coaching.[1] Following his stint as a player-coach with SIJ Utrecht, McLellan returned to Canada in 1992. He went into full-time coaching in 1993, being hired as the coach of the North Battleford North Stars of the Saskatchewan Junior League. In 1994, McLellan was hired as the head coach and general manager of the Swift Current Broncos of the WHL, where he succeeded Graham James. In his six seasons with Swift Current, the Broncos qualified for the WHL playoffs in all seasons. McLellan himself was named WHL Executive of the Year in 1997 and Coach of the Year in 2000.[1] Following his successes at the junior level, McLellan was hired by the expansion Minnesota Wild to coach their minor league affiliate, the Cleveland Lumberjacks of the International Hockey League (IHL). After the IHL folded in 2001, McLellan and his staff were transferred to the Wild's new minor league affiliate, the Houston Aeros of the AHL. As coach of the Aeros, McLellan led Houston to the Calder Cup in 2003.[1] In 2005, Mike Babcock selected McLellan to serve as his assistant with the Detroit Red Wings. In Detroit, McLellan was tasked with handling the Red Wings' forwards and managing the team's power play, as well as reporting player performance to head coach Babcock. Under his watch, the Red Wings had the top-ranked power play in the NHL, finishing first in power play efficiency in 2005–06 and third in 2007–08. As a member of the coaching staff, McLellan won his first Stanley Cup with the Red Wings in 2007–08.[1] On June 11, 2008, the San Jose Sharks hired McLellan to become their new head coach, replacing Ron Wilson.[2] He would end up the head coach for the Western Conference All-Star team, and lead the Sharks to their first Presidents' Trophy with an NHL-leading 117 points to finish the regular season, and finished third in voting for that season's Jack Adams Award, behind winner Claude Julien and Andy Murray. On March 14, 2013, with a 4–3 victory over the Los Angeles Kings, McLellan became the winningest coach in Sharks history with 207 victories.[3] On February 5, 2014, against the Dallas Stars, McLellan tied Darryl Sutter for the most games coached in Sharks history with 434.[4] After the team missed the playoffs in the 2014–15 season, McLellan and the Sharks agreed to mutually part ways on April 20, ending his tenure as the Sharks' winningest coach.[5] He coached the Canadian national team at the 2015 World Championship, where the team won the title for the first time since 2007 with a perfect 10–0 record.[6] On May 19, 2015, he was named head coach of the Edmonton Oilers, becoming the 14th head coach in team history. He succeeded Todd Nelson, who took over on an interim basis after Dallas Eakins was fired. At the time of his signing, McLellan became the highest-paid coach in NHL history, earning around $3 million per season.[7] However, he would hold the distinction for exactly one day, as McLellan's former colleague Mike Babcock signed an eight-year contract with the Toronto Maple Leafs worth around $6.25 million per season on May 20.[8][9] McLellan's first season in Edmonton was a rebuilding one. The Oilers finished with 70 points, the second-worst record in the league. However, the following season—the first in the team's new arena, Rogers Place—saw a dramatic turnaround. The Oilers tallied over 100 points for the first time since the 1980s dynasty years. On March 28, 2017, the Oilers defeated the Los Angeles Kings 2–1 to make the playoffs for the first time in 11 years. They also earned home-ice advantage in a playoff series for the first time since winning their last Cup in 1990. They upended McLellan's old team, the Sharks, in six games to win a playoff series for only the sixth time since 1990. On November 20, 2018, McLellan was fired by the Oilers and replaced by Ken Hitchcock after posting a record of 9–10–1.[10][11] On April 16, 2019, the Los Angeles Kings named McLellan head coach.[12] On February 2, 2024, he was fired, despite signing a one-year contract extension nearly four months prior that would have kept him behind the bench through the 2024–25 season.[13] Before his firing, Los Angeles stumbled after a strong 20–7–4 start to the season, losing 14 of McLellan's final 17 games with a 3–8–6 record.[14][15] On December 26, 2024, McLellan returned to the Red Wings, with the team hiring him as head coach after the dismissal of Derek Lalonde.[16] In 1992, McLellan married his wife Debbie. They have two sons, Tyson and Cale.[1]",

                "content": "Washington (AFP) – Todd McLellan was named the new head coach of the Detroit Red Wings on Thursday after the NHL club fired Derek Lalonde after three seasons in the role. Issued on: 27/12/2024 - 01:17Modified: 27/12/2024 - 01:15 The 57-year-old Canadian, who signed a multi-year contract with the Red Wings, had previous coaching stints with the NHL San Jose Sharks, Edmonton Oilers and Los Angeles Kings. McLellan, who was fired by the Kings last February 2 after going 23-15 with 10 overtime losses, has a career NHL coaching record of 598-412-134 over 1,144 regular-season games and a 42-46 mark in Stanley Cup playoff contests. His teams have reached the playoffs nine times in his 14 full NHL campaigns but never reached a Stanley Cup Final. In the 2022 and 2023 seasons, his Kings club lost to Edmonton in the first round of the playoffs. McLellan had previously served as an assistant coach with the Red Wings from 2005-08 and was on the staff when Detroit won the 2008 Stanley Cup. Lalonde, 52, became the fourth NHL coach fired this season after the November cuts of Boston's Jim Montgomery and Drew Bannister of St. Louis, as well as Chicago's Luke Richardson on December 5. He went 89-86-23 with the Red Wings after four seasons as an assistant coach at Tampa Bay, having helped the Lightning to the Stanley Cup in 2020 and 2021. The Red Wings are 13-17-4 and seventh in the Atlantic division, ranking near the bottom of the NHL in goals and penalty killing. They have not reached the playoffs since the 2015-16 season, the longest drought in team history following 25 consecutive trips to the post-season. © 2024 AFP © 2024 Copyright France 24 - All rights reserved.

DETROIT (AP) Tucker Gleason ran for one overtime score and threw for four more as Toledo beat Pittsburgh 48-46 in a bowl-record six overtimes at the GameAbove Sports Bowl at Ford Field on Thursday. The game surpassed the previous mark set 48 hours earlier when South Florida beat San Jose State 41-39 in five overtimes in the Hawaii Bowl on Tuesday. Pitt freshman Julian Dugger, making his college debut, ran for two overtime scores and threw for two more, but his incomplete pass in the sixth overtime ended the game. After Gleason and Dugger traded rushing touchdowns in the first overtime, each team got a field goal in the second. Each threw two-point passes in the third overtime, and Gleason got another in the fourth to make it 44-42. Dugger was sacked, apparently ending the game, but the Rockets were called for holding. Dugger was ruled short on a sneak attempt, sending Toledo rushing onto the field for a second time, but replay ruled he crossed the plane. In the fifth overtime, Dugger made it 46-44 with a scoring pass to Gavin Bartholomew, but Gleason tied it with his fifth scoring pass of the game. The sixth put Toledo back in front, and Dugger was pressured into a bad throw to end the game. The Panthers played without starting quarterback Eli Holstein (leg) and backup Nate Yarnell (transfer portal). David Lynch, a redshirt freshman walk-on, started his first game but was pulled in the third quarter after throwing two interceptions. Dugger led the Panthers to two touchdowns and a field goal on his first three drives, turning a 20-12 deficit into a 30-20 lead. However, Toledo got their second pick-6 of the game when Darius Alexander returned Dugger's interception 58 yards for a touchdown. The extra point made it 30-27 with 7:49 left and the Rockets kicked a tying field goal with 1:45 to play. Toledo started quickly, driving for a Gleason touchdown pass on the game's opening drive, but Kyle Louis blocked the extra point and returned it for Pitt's first defensive two-point conversion since 1990. Desmond Reid's 3-yard run and Ben Sauls' 57-yard field goal gave Pittsburgh a 12-6 lead, but Gleason's 67-yard touchdown pass to Junior Vandeross III put the Rockets up 13-12 midway through the second quarter. On the next play from scrimmage, Braden Awls picked off Lynch's pass and returned it 42 yards for a touchdown and a 20-12 halftime lead. Copyright 2024 STATS LLC and Associated Press.

            {
                "title": "Chiefs 29-10 Steelers (Dec 25, 2024) Game Recap - ESPN",
                "content": "Adam Schefter explains how limited options could play a part in the Steelers' plans at quarterback moving forward. PITTSBURGH -- — Andy Reid donned a Santa Claus suit in a giddy Kansas City Chiefs locker room on Christmas Day, then handed his team a present it increasingly looks like it deserves: home-field advantage throughout the AFC playoffs. How Reid managed to slide into the costume so quickly after Kansas City's clinical 29-10 victory over the reeling Pittsburgh Steelers to lock up the top seed in the AFC for the fourth time in seven years is a mystery (though he hinted there's an elf involved). How Reid's team manages to pull away from the pack year after year is not. A lot of Patrick Mahomes. A dash of Travis Kelce. A splash of speed. A defense that quietly goes about its business, even when its leader is standing on the sideline in sweatpants. Yes, it has been ugly — by Kansas City's lofty standards — at times while the Chiefs have chased a third straight championship. Yet as the playoffs loom, the group that looked so vulnerable for most of the season suddenly seems to be rounding into form. And the road to the Super Bowl will once again go through Arrowhead Stadium. Just the way the Chiefs like it. “Getting the No. 1 seed is important,” Mahomes said after throwing for 320 yards and three touchdowns. “It's like winning a playoff game.” Even if how the Chiefs locked it up didn't exactly feel like one. Kansas City (15-1) spent three hours toying with the Steelers (10-6) like a cat batting around shreds of leftover wrapping paper. The Chiefs raced to an early 13-point lead and were never really threatened by Pittsburgh, which has dropped three straight to see its chances of capturing the AFC North take another hit. “That sucked, to be blunt,” Steelers coach Mike Tomlin said. It often does when Pittsburgh is on one side of the line of scrimmage and Mahomes is on the other. Mahomes is now 4-0 against the Steelers with 17 touchdowns against just one interception. He connected on first-half scoring tosses to Xavier Worthy and Justin Watson and added a history-making 12-yard touchdown flip to Kelce to seal it in the fourth quarter. The grab was the 77th scoring reception of Kelce's career, breaking a franchise record set by Hall of Famer Tony Gonzalez. The 35-year-old Kelce celebrated by dunking the ball over the goal post, a nod to Gonzalez's signature move. The gesture drew a 15-yard penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct, though it hardly mattered. Harrison Butker made the longer extra point and the Chiefs were firmly in control. “It's just showing Tony some love,” Kelce said with a laugh on the day he joined Gonzalez and Jason Witten as the only tight ends to reach 1,000 receptions. Kelce finished with eight catches for 84 yards while playing for an offense that is starting to get its swagger back. The defense wasn't bad either, even with five-time Pro Bowl defensive end Chris Jones sidelined by a calf injury. Jones' teammates hardly looked gassed while playing for the third time in 11 days. “It was tough,” cornerback Trent McDuffie said. “I mean, three games in 11 days is crazy for anybody. But I thought we handled it very well.” The Steelers did not. Pittsburgh went 0-3 during the span, a brutal stretch against Super Bowl contenders Philadelphia, Baltimore and Kansas City in which the Steelers looked outclassed. Perhaps more troubling than the losses is the way they played out. Pittsburgh lost each contest by at least 14 points and could find itself starting the postseason on the road after playing fast-and-loose with the two-game division lead it enjoyed just three weeks ago. “I think that there's highs and lows in every season,” Pittsburgh quarterback Russell Wilson said after throwing for 205 yards with an ill-timed pick in the end zone in the first quarter. “We've got to make sure that we end this last game on the right footing and right belief.” That hasn't been an issue in years in Kansas City. Not with Mahomes at the controls. He spread his 29 completions to eight different players, including a career-best eight to Worthy and four to Hollywood Brown, whose return from injury has given the Chiefs another playmaker in what is starting to look like another stacked deck. “We're playing, especially offensively, our best football of the year,” Mahomes said. Looks like it. The two-time MVP hardly bothered by the ankle injury he suffered against Cleveland, throwing touchdowns to cap Kansas City's first two drives. And while the Steelers drew within 13-7 and 16-10, they never had the ball with a chance to take the lead in the second half. Instead, the Chiefs — who spent most of the first three months of the season squeaking by most weeks — zoomed away with the No. 1 seed and several weeks to rest before a bid for a three-peat that certainly looks doable.

                "title": "Chiefs vs. Steelers score, takeaways: Kansas City locks up AFC No. 1 seed after convincing Christmas Day win - CBSSports.com",
                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Patrick Mahomes' three touchdown passes keyed the Kansas City Chiefs to a convincing 29-10 win over the Pittsburgh Steelers on Christmas Day. With the win, the Chiefs clinched the AFC's No. 1 seed and the coveted first-round playoff bye that comes with it. The Chiefs are also the eighth team in NFL history to win at least 15 regular-season games. While it wasn't a lump of coal, the Steelers received a third straight loss for Christmas and are now trailing the Ravens in the AFC North division standings. While they have already clinched a playoff berth, the Steelers would have to settle for a wild-card spot if the postseason started today. The visiting Chiefs stormed out to a 13-0 lead after scoring on their first two possessions. The Steelers cut their deficit to 13-7 at halftime and were trailing 16-10 late in the third quarter. Kansas City responded by once again scoring touchdowns on consecutive drives, with the second score being set up by a Pittsburgh turnover. Mahomes' third touchdown pass of the day -- a 12-yard completion to Travis Kelce with 12:38 left -- essentially put a bow on the game. On the play, Kelce passed Hall of Fame tight end Tony Gonzalez for the most touchdown receptions in franchise history. Mahomes torched Pittsburgh's secondary to the tune of 320 yards on 29 of 38 passing. Kansas City's defensive charge was spearheaded by its pass rush that sacked Russell Wilson five times. The Chiefs were able to get to Wilson despite the absence of Chris Jones, who was sidelined with an injury. Here's a closer look at how the Chiefs gave their fans a Merry Christmas. The Chiefs received an early Christmas present when Marquise Brown made his Kansas City debut this past Saturday. Kansas City showed off its shiny \"new\" toy on Christmas, as Brown's presence put even more strain on the Steelers' already stretched out defense. While his numbers don't jump off a page, \"Hollywood\" Brown's four receptions forced the Steelers to focus on him while giving the Chiefs' other playmakers more room to roam. That included fellow speedster Xavier Worthy, who gave the Chiefs an early 7-0 with with his short touchdown catch. Kansas City never took its foot off the gas pedal, especially Mahomes, who proved once again that the conversation regarding the NFL's best player stops and ends with him. Mahomes riddled Pittsburgh's proud defense while completing passes to eight different teammates. At the top of that the stat sheet was Kelce, whose 87 yards was his most in a game since Week 9. Defensively, the Chiefs pounced on Pittsburgh's traditionally slow-starting offense by pressuring Wilson, who threw a costly interception to safety Justin Reid late in the first quarter (more on that later). Kansas City's defense later made the game-clinching play when Trent McDuffie forced a fumble that set up Kelce's knockout punch. Where do you want to start? Pittsburgh's third loss in 11 days can be chalked up to a variety of things. Among those things was an underperforming offense and a defense that no longer seems capable of bailing the team out. It's clear that the Steelers' plan was to control the ball while limiting Mahomes' possessions. While the strategy somewhat worked (Pittsburgh won time of possession and controlled the ball for over 17 minutes in the first half), the Steelers didn't fully capitalize on their scoring opportunities. The offense's slow start (and the defense's subsequent slow start) was a crushing blow to Pittsburgh's upset hopes. The Steelers tried to claw back into the game, but they ultimately dug themselves too deep of a hole to climb out of. Offensively, the Steelers didn't do enough to protect Wilson, who continues to pay for price for Pittsburgh's inability to give him a proven No. 2 receiver. Defensively, the Steelers secondary looked confused and out of sync, which was likely somewhat due to the absence of injured starting cornerback Joey Porter Jr. Pittsburgh outrushed the Chiefs 202-61, with Najee Harris leading the way with 74 yards on 13 carries (Harris became the first player in franchise history to rush for over 1,000 yards in each of his first four seasons). But the Steelers' mistakes and their defense's inability to come up with big plays made Pittsburgh's running game a moot point. As noted earlier, the game was up for grabs late in the third quarter after a Chris Boswell field goal made it a 16-10 game. But the Chiefs countered with an 11-play, 77-yard drive that was capped off by a short Kareem Hunt touchdown run. The drive featured two big catches by Brown that included a 17-yard gain on a second-and-14 play. Pittsburgh's next drive was quickly doomed after defensive end Felix Anudike-Uzomah dumped Wilson for a 5-yard loss on second down. On the next play, Steelers tight end Pat Freiermuth caught a short pass and tried to fight for the first down, but he fumbled the ball away in the process. Kansas City quickly cashed in on the turnover on Kelce's record-setting score. Reid's pick was crucial as it abruptly ended a sure Steelers scoring drive. The pick occurred one play after a holding call on Steelers tight end Broderick Jones wiped out a touchdown run by Jaylen Warren. The win gave the Chiefs a franchise-record 15 wins. Kansas City is the first 15-win team since the 2015 Carolina Panthers. Of the previous seven 15-win teams, only two (the 1984 49ers and 1985 Bears) went onto win the Super Bowl. The last five teams to win at least 15 games came up short in their quest to win the Super Bowl. The Steelers will get a little time off before hosting the Bengals in Week 18. The Bengals (7-8) may not be playing for a possible playoff spot depending on what happens between now and the end of the season. Cincinnati has to defeat the Broncos on Saturday if it's going to have any shot at the postseason. Speaking of Denver, the Chiefs will face the Broncos in Denver in Week 18. With the No. 1 seed in hand, the Chiefs will likely rest several key players for that game. George Pickens screams at the sideline after being offsides on a 4th-and-15 play. Things have unraveled quickly for the Steelers, who turn the ball over on downs. Kelce has now passed HOF TE Tony Gonzalez for the most career TD catches in franchise history. Kelce now has 77 career TD grabs. Gonzalez caught 76 scores during his 12-year run in Kansas City. Fittingly, the Chiefs' knockout punch was delivered by Mahomes and Kelce. Mahomes fires a 12-yard TD pass to Kelce while capitalizing on the Freiermuth fumble. Cam Heyward appeared to sustain an injury on the play; he's sitting on the field as trainers are looking at his right leg. Heyward was able to walk off the field under his own power. It's 29-10 KC with 12:38 left. Freiermuth fumbles while fighting for the first down on third-and-15. The ball was punched out by Trent McDuffie and recovered by Nick Bolton. That play occurred one play after Wilson was sacked for a fifth time. Chiefs about to extend their lead and especially put a bow on their franchise record 15th win of the season. Chiefs open the 4th with a short Kareem Hunt TD while extending lead to 22-10. Mahomes picked on the two-point try, though by second-year CB Cory Trice. Chiefs have been getting the necessary yards on the ground when they need them, but really, the key has been the Chiefs' speed at WR and their pass protection. KC takes a 16-10 lead into the fourth quarter. The Chiefs have a second-and-3 on the Steelers' 6-yard line with a chance to take a commanding lead. Mahomes is 25 of 32 with 274 yards with 2 TD's and has yet to be sacked. Eight different Chiefs have caught passes, led by Worthy, who has 79 yards and a score on 8 catches (8 targets). Quick slants to Hollywood Brown that gain 17 and 12 yards give the Chiefs the ball in Steelers territory late in the third quarter. KC's running game has been non-existent, but their newfound depth at receiver with Hollywood has proven to be critical in this game. Wilson was ... you guessed it ... sacked on third down as the Steelers settle for a Chris Boswell. It's 16-10 Chiefs with 5:45 left in the third. Adding to injury was that Wilson had Freiermuth open on that third down. Wilson has been sacked four times today, two by Mike Danna. KC's pass rush has been effective despite Chris Jones' absence. Justin Reid leaves the game after helping tackle Jaylen Warren. We'll keep you monitored on his status. Steelers near midfield, but Wilson continues to be under duress. Karlaftis (who already has two sacks) just hit Wilson, nearly forcing a fumble. Wilson does give the Steelers a first down on a 15-yard run. Wilson's scrambling has been significant today. Chiefs got a second chance on a third down following offsetting penalties. But Mahomes misfires on third down, and Harrison gives KC a 16-7 lead on a short FG with 12:21 left in the third. Steelers ramped up the pressure on Mahomes, but they still haven't been able to sack him. That was a win for Pittsburgh. The Chiefs haven't had many possessions, and given how that drive started, I don't think Mike Tomlin is that upset with allowing a field goal. Worthy burns Steelers rookie LB Payton Wilson for a 21-yard gain as the Chiefs are in the red zone early in the third quarter. Talking and communication issues for Pittsburgh today, especially on pass defense. Score: 13-7 ChiefsFirst downs: Steelers 12-8Third down: Both teams 3-7Total yards: Steelers 181-175Red zone: Chiefs 2-2, Steelers 1-2TOP: Steelers 17:03 Mahomes: 14-18, 143 yards, 2 TD, 0 sacksMahomes leads KC with 12 yards on 1 carry (team has 32 yards on 10 carries ... Pacheco 11 yards on 4 carries)Watson: 2 catches, 60 yards, TD Worthy: 4 catches, 27 yards, TDWilson: 10-15, 105 yards, INT, 2 sacks, rush TDWarren: 61 yards on 8 carries; Harris 21 yards on 7 carriesSteelers: 97 yards on 18 carries Pickens: 50 yards on 3 catches (4 targets)Freiermuth: 39 yards on 4 catches (5 targets) Pittsburgh ran out the clock after the officials ruled that Mike Williams did not possess the ball on a catch that would have put the Steelers in position to possibly attempt a long FG before the half. Nice open field tackle by Minkah Fitzpatrick on third down forces the Chiefs to punt with 38 seconds left in the first half. Steelers still have one TO left. Was going to be hard for KC to score there as they used up all of their timeouts earlier in the half. Steelers punt, but Chiefs flagged for having too many men on the field, so Pittsburgh re-gains possession with 2:07 left in the first half with the ball near midfield. Wilson scampers for 12 yards as Steelers trying to get on the board before halftime. Wilson has been more mobile in recent weeks, and it's mostly paying dividends. It's giving the offense with what Justin Fields provided during the season's first six weeks. KC appeared entered the red zone on a completion to Kelce, but a questionable hold against Jawaan Taylor wiped the play out and moved KC back to its own 40. KC called time as it appeared that they may discuss a long FG, but they ultimately punt. Steelers have the ball on their own 20, down 13-7 with 6:06 left in the first half. Mahomes hits Xavier Worthy for 13 yards on 3rd and 7 as the Chiefs are now past midfield. Steelers getting some pressure on Mahomes but aren't getting home. Steelers score after Wilson runs it in after no one was open on a play-action pass play. Wilson was 4 of 5 on the drive that included a few completions to Freiermuth, who is having his best season since his rookie year (which was Ben Roethlisberger's final season in Pittsburgh). Warren also making an impact with 50 yards on 6 carries. 13-7 Chiefs with 10:28 left in the first half. Feels like this is a significant drive in the game, with Pitt already being down 13-0. Steelers cross midfield after Wilson hits three straight passes, including a 15-yard completion to Pat Freiermuth. First quarter was summed up by two Mahomes TD passes and a missed scoring opportunity by the Steelers after a Warren TD was called back (holding). Mahomes 7 of 10 for 92 yards and 2 TD's in the first quarter. Wilson was 2 of 4 for 48 yards with a pick. After scoring on their first two drives, the Chiefs have to punt on their third drive. It could have been much worse, though, had Patrick Queen been able to hang onto a possible pick on third down (off a deflected pass) that would have given the Steelers the ball deep in KC territory. Pittsburgh is squandering its opportunities to get turnovers. That's now five turnovers they could have recorded over the past two games (four fumbles, one pick). Wilson goes deep and hits Pickens for 41. Warren rips off a 22-yard run on the next play and appeared to score a TD, but a holding call on TE Darnell Washington wiped out the score. Wilson throws a pick to Justin Reid one play later. Steelers get no points as Wilson has now turned it over three times over the past 5 quarters. Steelers blitz and Mahomes makes them pay with a 49-yard bomb to Justin Watson, who beat Donte Jackson downfield. Watson then scores on an 11-yard completion on third-and-4. Pittsburgh punts for a second time on two drives after George Karlaftis sacks Wilson on second down. Chiefs muff the punt, but are able to recover the fumble. That's now four consecutive fumbles by the opposition that the Steelers have been unable to recover. Najee Harris bursts to the outside for Pitt's first first down on their second drive. Nice block by Van Jefferson to seal the corner for Harris, who should be fresh after getting a total of 15 carries the past two games. Mahomes throws a quick dart to a wide open Xavier Worthy in the flat. Worthy out-ran Minkah Fitzpatrick to the end zone. But KC missed the point after after a penalty on Worthy after the TD pushed Harrison Butler's attempt back 15 yards. Kareem Hunt gains 4 on both down as the Chiefs are in scoring range. KC starts the game with four straight runs, including an 8-yard run by Isiah Pacheco on their first play. But Chiefs have already had to call two timeouts on this drive. Steelers gain 7 yards on first down but have to punt after Wilson takes a sack on third down (he fumbled but pounced on the ball). DE Mike Danna sacked Wilson, but it was more of a coverage sack as no one was open. Chiefs start on Pittsburgh's 42 after a long punt return.

The Pittsburgh Steelers inactive players for today's game vs Chiefs. This is the list of the Kansas City Chiefs players that are inactive for today's game. Russell Wilson has struggled in the past three weeks without George Pickens. This week, Pickens has the opportunity to showcase his value as the team's MVP by reigniting the passing game. Patrick Mahomes is close to breaking Peyton Manning's record for most touchdown passes in a player's first eight seasons. With 17 TDs and just three picks since Week 8, Mahomes needs three more on Christmas Day to surpass Manning--a remarkable feat given his limited starts as a rookie. The Pittsburgh Steelers lost to the Kansas City Chiefs, 42 to 21, in the 2021 AFC Wild Card game on January 16, 2022. Chiefs at Steelers is scheduled to kick off at 1:00 PM ET. Chiefs at Steelers can be watch on Netflix. The Kansas City Chiefs are poised to secure the AFC's No. 1 playoff seed as they face the Pittsburgh Steelers on Christmas Day. The Chiefs will be missing safety Chamarri Conner (concussion) and offensive tackle D.J. Humphries (hamstring). Defensive tackle Chris Jones (calf) and offensive tackle Jawaan Taylor (knee) are questionable. Jones leads the NFL in pressures, and Taylor's absence could elevate Wanya Morris to the lineup. For the Steelers, wide receiver George Pickens returns after a three-game absence, bolstering Pittsburgh's deep-passing game. Pickens, with 14 catches of 20+ yards, is pivotal for their offense. The Steelers lead the NFL with 31 takeaways, including a league-best 15 fumble recoveries. Key contributors include T.J. Watt (6 forced fumbles) and Donte Jackson (5 interceptions). However, the Chiefs have gone five games without a turnover, their longest streak since 2018. Pittsburgh ranks second in rushing attempts this season, averaging 31.9 per game. Najee Harris and Jaylen Warren have shared the workload effectively. The Steelers are 9-1 when surpassing 30 rushing attempts. Kansas City, however, has only allowed two teams to hit that mark this season, making run defense critical. Patrick Mahomes thrived last week with quick passes, completing 17-of-19 throws under 2.5 seconds for 155 yards and a touchdown. This strategy could neutralize Pittsburgh's pass rush, led by Watt, Cameron Heyward, and Alex Highsmith. The Chiefs have limited elite pass rushers like Myles Garrett and Danielle Hunter in recent games, a trend they'll aim to continue against Watt. Steelers kicker Chris Boswell leads the league with 39 field goals, including 12 from 50+ yards. Pittsburgh's struggles in the red zone (48% touchdown rate) have made his contributions crucial. The Chiefs, boasting the NFL's No. 8 red zone defense, will look to keep Boswell busy by forcing field goals instead of touchdowns. © Diciembre 2024 Unidad Editorial Información Deportiva, S.L.U.

                "title": "Texan English - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Texan English is the array of American English dialects spoken in Texas, primarily falling under Southern U.S. English. As one nationwide study states, the typical Texan accent is a \"Southern accent with a twist\".[1] The \"twist\" refers to inland Southern U.S., older coastal Southern U.S., and South Midland U.S. accents mixing together, due to Texas's settlement history, as well as some lexical (vocabulary) influences from Mexican Spanish.[1] In fact, there is no single accent that covers all of Texas and few dialect features are unique to Texas alone. The newest and most innovative Southern U.S. accent features are best reported in Lubbock, Odessa, somewhat Houston and variably Dallas, though general features of this same dialect are found throughout the state, with several exceptions:[2] Abilene and somewhat Austin, Corpus Christi, and El Paso appear to align more with Midland U.S. accents than Southern ones. After Mexico gained independence in 1821, Mexican Texas legally permitted an influx of American settlers from the United States (mainly the Southern United States),[3] who within a decade outnumbered Hispanics in Texas,[4] making English as common as Spanish in central and north Texas. After Texas became an independent republic in 1836, English, with its distinct Southern influences, became the predominant language. After the Mexican Revolution of 1910–1920, a great number of Spanish-speaking Mexicans immigrated to Texas,[5][6] slowing down in the mid-20th century only to increase massively since 1990,[4] driving the development of a young Spanish-influenced dialect of Texan English: Tejano English. Some linguists draw dialect boundaries based upon phonological (sound-pattern) differences and others on lexical (word-usage) differences, leading to various views on how to classify dialects in Texas, often by dividing the state into an eastern versus a western dialect region.[7] 20th-century lexical research delimited Texas into two \"layers\": a southern Texas layer along the Mexican border with several Spanish loanwords and a central Texas layer settled by speakers of German and other European languages amidst a dominant Anglo-American settlement.[8][9] 21st-century phonological research reveals accents in Texas grouped in a way not easy to demarcate in terms of simple geographical boundaries,[10] and ongoing research reveals an urban–rural divide within Texas becoming more significant than a region-wide divide. Some linguists propose that urbanization, geographic and social mobility, and the mass media have homogenized the speech of the United States to a national norm.[11] Due to rapid urbanization, increasing dominance of high tech industries, and massive migrations, Texan speech has been reshaped as well, especially since 1990.[4] The general tendency in the phonology of Texas English is that mergers expand at the expense of distinctions, although traditional Southern-style Texan English preserved older phonemic distinctions.[11] Since much of the traditional regional vocabulary concerned farming and rural life, these terms are now disappearing or being replaced by technical terms.[11] As stated above, an internal rural–urban split is emerging within Texan English, meaning that most traditionally Southern (or stereotypically Texan) features remain strong in rural areas but tend to disappear in large urban areas and small cities.[4] The urban-rural linguistic split mainly affects Southern-style phonological phenomena like the pen-pin merger, the loss of the offglide in /aɪ/, and upgliding diphthongs, all of which are now recessive in metropolitan areas.[4] Meanwhile, some traditional grammatical features like y'all and fixin' to are expanding to non-natives in metropolitan areas as well as to the Hispanic population.[4] Essentially all Texas English phonologically falls under the Southeastern super-dialect region of the United States and often specifically the Southern dialect region, though noticeably not the cities of El Paso, Abilene, and Austin, and not particularly Houston and Corpus Christi.[2] Moreover, as of 21st-century research, the accents of Dallas show enormous variability.[10] Texas English may use many grammatical constructions typically associated with Southern U.S. English, including fixin' to,[19] multiple modals like might could and should oughta (reportedly used by every social class and, as of the 1980s Linguistic Atlas of the Gulf States, predominately in Upper and Lower East Texas), and plural verbal -s as in Our father and mother helps used by both Black and (somewhat less commonly) white Texans.[20] Many of these lexical terms are shared with the Midland and Southern dialects generally: Due to Spain's past influence in Texas, the vocabulary of Texas is much more influenced by Spanish than the vocabulary of other states. Some of the Texan terms that originated from Spanish are listed below.[22] Texan English frequently shows up in the media. In the 1950s and 1960s, many Hollywood western movies like Giant, Hud, and The Alamo were set in Texas. In those movies, Hollywood stars like James Dean, Rock Hudson, Dennis Hopper, Paul Newman, and Patricia Neal first had to learn how to speak Texan English and were instructed by native Texans. Also the famous TV series Dallas was often characterized by Texan English. Texas Instruments sometimes uses Texan English in its products. The TIFORM software for its TI-990 minicomputer sometimes displayed \"Shut 'er Down Clancey She's a-Pumping Mud\" as a humorous error message.[28] The Texan accent gained nationwide fame with the presidency of native Texan Lyndon B. Johnson. A lifelong resident of the Texas Hill Country, Johnson's thick accent was a large part of his personality and brought attention and fame to the dialect.[4][29] The Texan dialect gained fame again when George W. Bush started to serve as president. He had moved to West Texas at the age of two and has since retained the Texan dialect. In his speech, words like \"America\" sometimes sound like \"Amur-kah\" or even just like \"Mur-kah\".[4][30] Former U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson also speaks with a distinctively Texan accent.[31][32] Due to hundreds of years of Spanish and later Mexican intermingling, around 6 million (ca. 29%) people in Texas speak Spanish as the first language.[33] Recent data shows that Spanish is still increasing.[34] Since there are so many Spanish speakers in Texas, Spanish has a high impact on the English dialect spoken in Texas.[35] Many Mexican Americans in Texas speak their own variety of English which has many Spanish features (terms, phonology, etc.), Tejano English, a Chicano English dialect mostly spoken by working-class Mexican Americans. A very distinctive feature of that dialect is the /-t,d/-deletion in words which contain a /t/ or /d/ in the final position.[36]",

                "content": "Beyoncé Giselle Knowles-Carter (/biˈɒnseɪ/ ⓘ, bee-ON-say;[6] born September 4, 1981)[7] is an American singer, songwriter, and businesswoman. Regarded as one of the most influential cultural figures in music history,[8] she has transformed the sound of popular music with her vocal ability, live performances and artistic innovations. Her work is considered to be amongst the greatest of all time.[9] As a child, Beyoncé began performing through various singing and dancing competitions. She debuted in the late 1990s and rose to fame as a member of Destiny's Child, one of the best-selling girl groups of all time. Her debut solo album, Dangerously in Love (2003), became one of the best-selling albums of the 21st century and spawned the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles \"Crazy in Love\" and \"Baby Boy\". Beyoncé's commercial success continued with the albums B'Day (2006), I Am... Sasha Fierce (2008) and 4 (2011), all of which featured hit singles including \"Irreplaceable\", \"Check on It\", \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on it)\", \"If I Were a Boy\", \"Halo\", \"Run the World (Girls)\" and \"Love On Top\". She has also ventured into acting, with leading roles in the films Dreamgirls (2006), Cadillac Records (2008) and Obsessed (2009). Beyoncé's career shifted after forming her own management company Parkwood Entertainment, creating monocultural events through acclaimed concept albums.[10] She explored personal and sociopolitical themes on Beyoncé (2013) and Lemonade (2016), which are credited with popularizing the surprise album and visual album. The former inspired setting Friday as the Global Release Day, while the latter became the best-selling album of 2016 worldwide. Her ongoing trilogy project – currently consisting of queer-inspired dance album Renaissance (2022) and Americana epic Cowboy Carter (2024) – has highlighted the contributions of Black pioneers to American musical and cultural history, spawning the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles \"Break My Soul\" and \"Texas Hold 'Em\". Beyoncé is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold 200 million records worldwide, making her the most Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA)-certified female artist in history.[11][12][13] Her accolades include the most Grammy Awards (32), NAACP Image Awards (25), BET Awards (32) and Soul Train Music Awards (25) of any artist. Billboard ranked her as the greatest pop star of the 21st century and Rolling Stone named her among the best singers of all time.[14][15] She was repeatedly named artist of the decade for both the 2000s and 2010s, including recognition as the RIAA's Top Certified Artist of the Decade and Pollstar's Touring Artist of the Decade.[16] She is the only female artist to debut all of her eight solo albums at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200, and she is the only artist to release new Billboard Hot 100 number-one hits in four different decades (including group achievements).[17] She is a ubiquitous figure within popular culture and has influenced various other artists. Beyoncé Giselle Knowles was born on September 4, 1981, at the Park Plaza Hospital[18] in Houston, Texas, to Tina Knowles (née Beyoncé), a hairdresser and salon owner, and Mathew Knowles, a Xerox sales manager.[19] Tina is Louisiana Creole and Mathew is African American.[20][21][22][23] Beyoncé's younger sister, Solange Knowles, is also a singer and a former backup dancer for Destiny's Child. Solange and Beyoncé are the first sisters to have both had number one solo albums.[24] Beyoncé's maternal grandparents, Lumis Albert Beyincé and Agnéz Deréon (daughter of Odilia Broussard and Eugène DeRouen),[25] were French-speaking Louisiana Creoles, with roots in New Iberia;[26][25][27] She is a descendant of Acadian militia officer Joseph Broussard, who was exiled to French Louisiana after the expulsion of the Acadians, and of the French military officer and Abenaki chief Jean-Vincent d'Abbadie, Baron de Saint-Castin.[21][28] She has additional Breton heritage. Beyoncé's fourth great-grandmother, Marie-Françoise Trahan, was born in 1774 in Bangor, located on Belle Île, France. Trahan was a daughter of Acadians who had taken refuge on Belle Île after the Acadian expulsion. The Estates of Brittany had divided the lands of Belle Île to distribute them among 78 other Acadian families and the already settled inhabitants. The Trahan family lived on Belle Île for over ten years before migrating to Louisiana, where she married a Broussard descendant.[29] Beyoncé researched her ancestry and discovered that she is descended from a slave owner who married his slave.[30] Her mother is also of distant Irish and Jewish ancestry.[31][32][33][26] Beyoncé also has Belgian ancestry from Hainaut Province, Wallonia and is related to a former mayor of Froidchapelle, Belgium.[34][35] Beyoncé was raised with multiple religious traditions, attending St. John's United Methodist Church in Houston as well as St. Mary of the Purification Catholic Church.[36][37][38] She went to St. Mary's Catholic Montessori School in Houston and enrolled in dance classes there.[39] Her singing ability was discovered when dance instructor Darlette Johnson began humming a song and Beyoncé finished it, able to hit the high-pitched notes.[40] Beyoncé's interest in music and performing continued after winning a school talent show at age seven, singing John Lennon's \"Imagine\" to beat 15/16-year-olds.[41][42] In the fall of 1990, Beyoncé enrolled in Parker Elementary School, a music magnet school in Houston, where she performed with the school's choir.[43] She also attended the High School for the Performing and Visual Arts[44] and later Alief Elsik High School.[20][45] Beyoncé was also a member of the choir at St. John's United Methodist Church where she sang her first solo and was a soloist for two years.[37][46] When Beyoncé was eight, she met LaTavia Roberson at an audition for an all-girl entertainment group.[47] They were placed into a group called Girl's Tyme with three other girls, and rapped and danced on the talent show circuit in Houston.[48] After seeing the group, R&B producer Arne Frager brought them to his Northern California studio and placed them in Star Search, the largest talent show on national TV at the time. Girl's Tyme failed to win, and Beyoncé later said the song they performed was not good.[49][50] In 1995, Beyoncé's father, Mathew, resigned from his job to manage the group.[51] The move reduced the family's income by half, and Beyoncé's parents were forced to sell their house and cars and move into separated apartments.[20][52] Mathew cut the original line-up to four and the group continued performing as an opening act for other established R&B girl groups.[47] The girls auditioned before record labels and were finally signed to Elektra Records, moving to Atlanta Records briefly to work on their first recording, only to be cut by the company.[20] This put further strain on the family, and Beyoncé's parents separated. On October 5, 1995, Dwayne Wiggins's Grass Roots Entertainment signed the group. In 1996, the girls began recording their debut album under an agreement with Sony Music, the Knowles family reunited, and shortly after, the group got a contract with Columbia Records with the assistance of Columbia talent scout Teresa LaBarbera Whites.[41] The group changed their name to Destiny's Child in 1996, based upon a passage in the Book of Isaiah.[53] In 1997, Destiny's Child released their major label debut song \"Killing Time\" on the soundtrack to the 1997 film Men in Black.[50] In November, the group released their debut single and first major hit, \"No, No, No\". They released their self-titled debut album in February 1998, which established the group as a viable act in the music industry.[47] The group released their Multi-Platinum second album The Writing's on the Wall in 1999. The record features songs such as \"Bills, Bills, Bills\", the group's first number-one single, \"Jumpin' Jumpin'\" and \"Say My Name\", which became their most successful song at the time, and would remain one of their signature songs. \"Say My Name\" won the Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals and the Best R&B Song at the 43rd Annual Grammy Awards.[47] The Writing's on the Wall sold more than eight million copies worldwide.[49] During this time, Beyoncé recorded a duet with Marc Nelson, an original member of Boyz II Men, on the song \"After All Is Said and Done\" for the soundtrack to the 1999 film, The Best Man, as well as \"Ways To Get Cut Off\", a collaboration with fellow Columbia Records signee JoJo Robinson that was later shelved.[54][55] The remaining band members recorded \"Independent Women Part I\", which appeared on the soundtrack to the 2000 film Charlie's Angels. It became their best-charting single, topping the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart for eleven consecutive weeks.[47] In early 2001, while Destiny's Child was completing their third album, Beyoncé landed a major role in the MTV made-for-television film, Carmen: A Hip Hopera, starring alongside American actor Mekhi Phifer. Set in Philadelphia, the film is a modern interpretation of the 19th-century opera Carmen by French composer Georges Bizet.[56] When the third album Survivor was released in May 2001, Luckett and Roberson filed a lawsuit claiming that the songs were aimed at them.[47] The album debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200, with first-week sales of 663,000 copies sold.[57] The album spawned other number-one hits, \"Bootylicious\" and the title track, \"Survivor\", the latter of which earned the group a Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals.[58] After releasing their holiday album 8 Days of Christmas in October 2001, the group announced a hiatus to further pursue solo careers.[47] In July 2002, Beyoncé made her theatrical film debut, playing Foxxy Cleopatra alongside Mike Myers in the comedy film Austin Powers in Goldmember,[59] which spent its first weekend atop the U.S. box office and grossed $73 million.[60] Beyoncé released \"Work It Out\" as the lead single from its soundtrack album which entered the top ten in the UK, Norway, and Belgium.[61] In 2003, Beyoncé starred opposite Cuba Gooding Jr. in the musical comedy The Fighting Temptations as Lilly, a single mother with whom Gooding's character falls in love.[62] The film received mixed reviews from critics but grossed $30 million in the U.S.[63][64] Beyoncé released \"Fighting Temptation\" as the lead single from the film's soundtrack album, with Missy Elliott, MC Lyte, and Free which was also used to promote the film.[65] Another of Beyoncé's contributions to the soundtrack, \"Summertime\", fared better on the U.S. charts.[66] Beyoncé's first solo recording was a feature on Jay-Z's song \"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\" that was released in October 2002, peaking at number four on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart.[68] On June 14, 2003, Beyoncé premiered songs from her first solo album Dangerously in Love during her first solo concert and the pay-per-view television special, \"Ford Presents Beyoncé Knowles, Friends & Family, Live From Ford's 100th Anniversary Celebration in Dearborn, Michigan\".[69] The album was released on June 24, 2003, after Michelle Williams and Kelly Rowland had released their solo efforts.[70] The album sold 317,000 copies in its first week, debuted atop the Billboard 200,[71] and has since sold 11 million copies worldwide.[72] The album's lead single, \"Crazy in Love\", featuring Jay-Z, became Beyoncé's first number-one single as a solo artist in the US.[73] The single \"Baby Boy\" also reached number one,[67] and singles, \"Me, Myself and I\" and \"Naughty Girl\", both reached the top-five.[74] The album earned Beyoncé a then record-tying five awards at the 46th Annual Grammy Awards; Best Contemporary R&B Album, Best Female R&B Vocal Performance for \"Dangerously in Love 2\", Best R&B Song and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration for \"Crazy in Love\", and Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals for \"The Closer I Get to You\" with Luther Vandross. During the ceremony, she performed with Prince.[75] In November 2003, she embarked on the Dangerously in Love Tour in Europe and later toured alongside Missy Elliott and Alicia Keys for the Verizon Ladies First Tour in North America.[76] On February 1, 2004, Beyoncé performed the American national anthem at Super Bowl XXXVIII, at the Reliant Stadium in Houston, Texas.[77] After the release of Dangerously in Love, Beyoncé had planned to produce a follow-up album using several of the left-over tracks. However, this was put on hold so she could concentrate on recording Destiny Fulfilled, the final studio album by Destiny's Child.[78] Released on November 15, 2004, in the U.S.[79] and peaking at number two on the Billboard 200,[80][81] Destiny Fulfilled included the singles \"Lose My Breath\" and \"Soldier\", which reached the top five on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.[82] Destiny's Child embarked on a worldwide concert tour, Destiny Fulfilled... and Lovin' It sponsored by McDonald's Corporation,[83] and performed songs such as \"No, No, No\", \"Survivor\", \"Say My Name\", \"Independent Women\" and \"Lose My Breath\". In addition to renditions of the group's recorded material, they also performed songs from each singer's solo careers, including numbers from Dangerously in Love. During the last stop of their European tour, in Barcelona on June 11, 2005, Rowland announced that Destiny's Child would disband following the North American leg of the tour.[84] The group released their first compilation album Number 1's on October 25, 2005, in the U.S.[85] and accepted a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in March 2006.[86] The group has sold 60 million records worldwide.[87][88] Beyoncé's second solo album B'Day was released on September 4, 2006, in the U.S., to coincide with her twenty-fifth birthday.[89] It sold 541,000 copies in its first week and debuted atop the Billboard 200, becoming Beyoncé's second consecutive number-one album in the United States.[90] The album's lead single \"Déjà Vu\", featuring Jay-Z, reached the top five on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.[74] The second international single \"Irreplaceable\" was a commercial success worldwide, reaching number one in Australia, Hungary, Ireland, New Zealand and the United States.[74][91] B'Day also produced three other singles; \"Ring the Alarm\",[92] \"Get Me Bodied\",[93] and \"Green Light\" (released in the United Kingdom only).[94] At the 49th Annual Grammy Awards (2007), B'Day was nominated for five Grammy Awards, including Best Contemporary R&B Album, Best Female R&B Vocal Performance for \"Ring the Alarm\" and Best R&B Song and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration\"for \"Déjà Vu\"; the Freemasons club mix of \"Déjà Vu\" without the rap was put forward in the Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical category. B'Day won the award for Best Contemporary R&B Album.[95] The following year, B'Day received two nominations – for Record of the Year for \"Irreplaceable\" and Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals for \"Beautiful Liar\" (with Shakira), also receiving a nomination for Best Compilation Soundtrack Album for Motion Pictures, Television or Other Visual Media for her appearance on Dreamgirls: Music from the Motion Picture (2006).[96] Her first acting role of 2006 was in the comedy film The Pink Panther starring opposite Steve Martin,[97] grossing $158.8 million at the box office worldwide.[98] Her second film Dreamgirls, the film version of the 1981 Broadway musical[99] loosely based on The Supremes, received acclaim from critics and grossed $154 million internationally.[100][101][102] In it, she starred opposite Jennifer Hudson, Jamie Foxx, and Eddie Murphy playing a pop singer based on Diana Ross.[103] To promote the film, Beyoncé released \"Listen\" as the lead single from the soundtrack album.[104] In April 2007, Beyoncé embarked on The Beyoncé Experience, her first worldwide concert tour, visiting 97 venues[105] and grossed over $24 million.[b] Beyoncé conducted pre-concert food donation drives during six major stops in conjunction with her pastor at St. John's and America's Second Harvest. At the same time, B'Day was re-released with five additional songs, including her duet with Shakira \"Beautiful Liar\".[107] I Am... Sasha Fierce was released in November 2008 and formally introduced Beyoncé's alter ego Sasha Fierce.[108] It was met with mixed reviews from critics,[109] but sold 482,000 copies in its first week, debuting atop the Billboard 200, and giving Beyoncé her third consecutive number-one album in the U.S.[110] The album featured her fourth UK number-one single \"If I Were a Boy\" and her fifth U.S. number-one song \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\".[111] \"Halo\" achieved the accomplishment of becoming her longest-running Hot 100 single in her career,[112] \"Halo\"'s success in the U.S. helped Beyoncé attain more top-ten singles on the list than any other woman during the 2000s.[113] The music video for \"Single Ladies\" has been parodied and imitated around the world, spawning the \"first major dance craze\" of the Internet age according to the Toronto Star.[114] At the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, the video won three categories, including Video of the Year.[115] In March 2009, Beyoncé embarked on the I Am... Tour, her second headlining worldwide concert tour, consisting of 108 shows, grossing $119.5 million.[116] Beyoncé further expanded her acting career, starring as blues singer Etta James in the 2008 musical biopic Cadillac Records. Her performance in the film received praise from critics,[117] and she garnered several nominations for her portrayal of James, including a Satellite Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress, and an NAACP Image Award nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress.[118][119] Beyoncé donated her entire salary from the film to Phoenix House, an organization of rehabilitation centers for heroin addicts around the country.[120] Beyoncé starred opposite Ali Larter and Idris Elba in the thriller, Obsessed. She played Sharon Charles, a mother and wife whose family is threatened by her husband's stalker. The film received negative reviews from critics,[121] and did well at the U.S. box office, grossing $68 million – $60 million more than Cadillac Records[122] – on a budget of $20 million.[123] At the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards, Beyoncé received ten nominations, tying with Lauryn Hill for most Grammy nominations in a single year by a female artist.[124] Beyoncé went on to win six of those nominations, breaking a record she previously tied in 2004 for the most Grammy awards won in a single night by a female artist with six. In 2010, Beyoncé provide guest vocals on Lady Gaga's single \"Telephone\".[125][126] The song topped the U.S. Pop Songs chart, becoming the sixth number-one for both Beyoncé and Gaga, tying them with Mariah Carey for most number-ones since the Nielsen Top 40 airplay chart launched in 1992.[127] Beyoncé announced a hiatus from her music career in January 2010, heeding her mother's advice, \"to live life, to be inspired by things again\".[128][129] During the break, she and her father parted ways as business partners.[130][131] Beyoncé's musical break lasted nine months and saw her visit multiple European cities, the Great Wall of China, the Egyptian pyramids, Australia, English music festivals and various museums and ballet performances.[128][132] \"Eat, Play, Love\", a cover story written by Beyoncé for Essence that detailed her 2010 career break, won her a writing award from the New York Association of Black Journalists.[133] On June 26, 2011, she became the first solo female artist to headline the main Pyramid stage at the 2011 Glastonbury Festival in over twenty years.[134][135] The performance was lauded, with several publications noting an ascension in Knowles' capabilities as a live performer. Other publications discussed the polarized attitude of the UK music establishment in response to a Black woman performing on the same stages and to the same crowd sizes that were past reserved for legacy rock acts.[136][137] Her fourth studio album 4 was released two days prior in the U.S.[138] 4 sold 310,000 copies in its first week and debuted atop the Billboard 200 chart, giving Beyoncé her fourth consecutive number-one album in the U.S. The album was preceded by two of its singles \"Run the World (Girls)\" and \"Best Thing I Never Had\".[74][125][139] The fourth single \"Love on Top\" spent seven consecutive weeks at number one on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, while peaking at number 20 on the Billboard Hot 100, the highest peak from the album.[140] In late 2011, she took the stage at New York's Roseland Ballroom for four nights of special performances:[141] the 4 Intimate Nights with Beyoncé concerts saw the performance of her 4 album to a standing room only.[141] On August 1, 2011, the album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), having shipped 1 million copies to retail stores.[142] By December 2015, it reached sales of 1.5 million copies in the U.S.[143] The album reached one billion Spotify streams on February 5, 2018, making Beyoncé the first female artist to have three of their albums surpass one billion streams on the platform.[144] In June 2012, she performed for four nights at Revel Atlantic City's Ovation Hall to celebrate the resort's opening, her first performances since giving birth to her daughter.[145][146] In January 2013, Beyoncé performed the American national anthem singing along with a pre-recorded track at President Obama's second inauguration in Washington, D.C.[147][148] The following month, Beyoncé performed at the Super Bowl XLVII halftime show, held at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans.[149] The performance stands as the second most tweeted about moment in history at 268,000 tweets per minute.[150] Her feature-length documentary film, Life Is But a Dream, first aired on HBO on February 16, 2013.[151] The film was co-directed by Beyoncé herself.[152] Beyoncé embarked on The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour on April 15 in Belgrade, Serbia; the tour included 132 dates that ran through to March 2014.

The album debuted atop the Billboard 200 chart, giving Beyoncé her fifth consecutive number-one album in the U.S.[157] This made her the first woman in the chart's history to have her first five studio albums debut at number one.[158] Beyoncé received critical acclaim[159] and commercial success, selling one million digital copies worldwide in six days;[160] Musically an electro-R&B album, it concerns darker themes previously unexplored in her work, such as \"bulimia, postnatal depression [and] the fears and insecurities of marriage and motherhood\".[161] The single \"Drunk in Love\", featuring Jay-Z, peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.[162] According to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), Beyoncé sold 2.3 million units worldwide, becoming the tenth best-selling album of 2013.[163] The album also went on to become the twentieth best-selling album of 2014.[164] As of November 2014[update], Beyoncé has sold over 5 million copies worldwide and has generated over 1 billion streams, as of March 2015[update].[165] At the 57th Annual Grammy Awards in February 2015, Beyoncé was nominated for six awards, ultimately winning three: Best R&B Performance and Best R&B Song for \"Drunk in Love\", and Best Surround Sound Album for Beyoncé.[166][167] In April 2014, Beyoncé and Jay-Z officially announced their On the Run Tour.

The appearance was considered controversial as it appeared to reference the 50th anniversary of the Black Panther Party and the NFL forbids political statements in its performances.[171][172][173] Immediately following the performance, Beyoncé announced The Formation World Tour, which highlighted stops in both North America and Europe.[174][175] It marked the first ever all-stadium tour by a female artist and ended on October 7, with Beyoncé bringing out her husband Jay-Z, Kendrick Lamar, and Serena Williams for the last show.[176] The tour went on to win Tour of the Year at the 44th American Music Awards.[177] In April 2016, Beyoncé released a teaser clip for a project called Lemonade. A one-hour film which aired on HBO on April 23, a corresponding album with the same title was released on the same day exclusively on Tidal.[178] Lemonade debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200, making Beyoncé the first act in Billboard history to have their first six studio albums debut atop the chart; she broke a record previously tied with DMX in 2013.[179] With all 12 tracks of Lemonade debuting on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, Beyoncé also became the first female act to chart 12 or more songs at the same time.[180] Lemonade was streamed 115 million times through Tidal, setting a record for the most-streamed album in a single week by a female artist in history.[181] It was 2016's third highest-selling album in the U.S. with 1.554 million copies sold in that time period within the country[182] as well as the best-selling album worldwide with global sales of 2.5 million throughout the year.[183] Lemonade became the most critically acclaimed work of her career.[184] Several music publications included the album among the best of 2016, including Rolling Stone, which listed Lemonade at number one.[185] The album's visuals were nominated in 11 categories at the 2016 MTV Video Music Awards, the most ever received by Beyoncé in a single year, and went on to win 8 awards, including Video of the Year for \"Formation\".[186][187] The eight wins made Beyoncé the most-awarded artist in the history of the VMAs (24), surpassing Madonna (20).[188] Beyoncé occupied the sixth place for Time magazine's 2016 Person of the Year.[189] In January 2017, it was announced that Beyoncé would headline the Coachella Music and Arts Festival. This would have made Beyoncé only the second female headliner of the festival since it was founded in 1999.[190] It was later announced on February 23, 2017, that Beyoncé would no longer be able to perform at the festival due to doctor's concerns regarding her pregnancy. The festival owners announced that she would instead headline the 2018 festival.[191] Upon the announcement of Beyoncé's departure from the festival lineup, ticket prices dropped by 12%.[192] At the 59th Grammy Awards in February 2017, Lemonade led the nominations with nine, including Album, Record, and Song of the Year for Lemonade and \"Formation\" respectively,[193] ultimately winning two, Best Urban Contemporary Album for Lemonade and Best Music Video for \"Formation\".[194] In September 2017, Beyoncé collaborated with J Balvin and Willy William, to release a remix of the song \"Mi Gente\". Beyoncé donated all proceeds from the song to hurricane charities for those affected by Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma in Texas, Mexico, Puerto Rico, and other Caribbean Islands.[195] On November 10, Eminem released \"Walk on Water\" featuring Beyoncé as the lead single from his album Revival. On November 30, Ed Sheeran announced that Beyoncé would feature on the remix to his song \"Perfect\".[196] \"Perfect Duet\" was released on December 1, 2017. The song reached number-one in the United States, becoming Beyoncé's sixth song of her solo career to do so.[197] On January 4, 2018, the music video of Beyoncé and Jay-Z's 4:44 collaboration, \"Family Feud\" was released.[198] It was directed by Ava DuVernay. On March 1, 2018, DJ Khaled released \"Top Off\" as the first single from his forthcoming album Father of Asahd featuring Beyoncé, husband Jay-Z, and Future.[199] On April 14, 2018, Beyoncé played the first of two weekends as the headlining act of the Coachella Music Festival. Her performance of April 14, attended by 125,000 festival-goers, was immediately praised, with multiple media outlets describing it as historic. The performance became the most-tweeted-about performance of weekend one, as well as the most-watched live Coachella performance and the most-watched live performance on YouTube of all time. The show paid tribute to black culture, specifically historically black colleges and universities and featured a live band with over 100 dancers. Destiny's Child also reunited during the show.[200][201] On June 6, 2018, Beyoncé and husband Jay-Z kicked-off the On the Run II Tour in Cardiff, United Kingdom. Ten days later, at their final London performance, the pair unveiled Everything Is Love, their joint studio album, credited under the name The Carters, and initially available exclusively on Tidal. The pair also released the video for the album's lead single, \"Apeshit\", on Beyoncé's official YouTube channel.[202][203] Everything Is Love received generally positive reviews,[204] and debuted at number two on the U.S. Billboard 200, with 123,000 album-equivalent units, of which 70,000 were pure album sales.[205] On December 2, 2018, Beyoncé alongside Jay-Z headlined the Global Citizen Festival: Mandela 100 which was held at FNB Stadium in Johannesburg, South Africa.[206] Their 2-hour performance had concepts similar to the On the Run II Tour and Beyoncé was praised for her outfits, which paid tribute to Africa's diversity.[207] Homecoming: A Film by Beyoncé, a documentary and concert film focusing on Beyoncé's historic 2018 Coachella performances, was released by Netflix on April 17, 2019.[208][209] The film was accompanied by the surprise live album Homecoming: The Live Album.[210] It was later reported that Beyoncé and Netflix had signed a $60 million deal to produce three different projects, one of which is Homecoming.[211] Homecoming: A Film by Beyoncé received six nominations at the 71st Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards.[212] Beyoncé starred as the voice of Nala in the remake The Lion King, which was released in July 2019.[213] Beyoncé is featured on the film's soundtrack, released on July 11, 2019, with a remake of the song \"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\" alongside Donald Glover, Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen, which was originally composed by Elton John.[214] An original song from the film by Beyoncé, \"Spirit\", was released as the lead single from both the soundtrack and The Lion King: The Gift – a companion album released alongside the film, produced and curated by Beyoncé.[215][216] Beyoncé called The Lion King: The Gift a \"sonic cinema\". She stated that the album was influenced by R&B, pop, hip hop, gqom and Afro Beat.[215][217] The songs were produced by African producers, which Beyoncé said was because \"authenticity and heart were important to [her]\", since the film is set in Africa.[215] In September of the same year, a documentary chronicling the development, production and early music video filming of The Lion King: The Gift entitled \"Beyoncé Presents: Making The Gift\" was aired on ABC.[218] In April 2020, Beyoncé was featured on the remix of Megan Thee Stallion's song \"Savage\", marking her first music release for the year.[219] The song peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, marking Beyoncé's eleventh song to do so across all acts.[220] On June 19, 2020, Beyoncé released the nonprofit charity single \"Black Parade\".[221] On June 23, she followed up the release of its studio version with an a cappella version exclusively on Tidal.[222] Black Is King, a visual album based on the music of The Lion King: The Gift, premiered globally on Disney+ on July 31, 2020. Produced by Disney and Parkwood Entertainment, the film was written, directed and executively produced by Beyoncé. The film was described by Disney as \"a celebratory memoir for the world on the Black experience\".[223] Beyoncé received the most nominations (9) at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards and the most awards (4), which made her the most-awarded singer, most-awarded female artist, and second-most-awarded artist in Grammy history.[224] In 2021, Beyoncé wrote and recorded a song titled \"Be Alive\" for the biographical drama film King Richard.[225] She received her first Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song at the 94th Academy Awards for the song, alongside co-writer Dixson.[226] On March 27, 2022, Beyoncé performed \"Be Alive\" at the 94th Academy Awards. Choreographed by friend and past collaborator Fatima Robinson, Beyoncé was applauded for choosing to perform on the Compton tennis courts Venus and Serena Williams practiced on in their childhood instead of at the venue.[227][228] On June 9, 2022, Beyoncé removed her profile pictures across various social media platforms, causing speculation that she would be releasing new music.[229] Days later, Beyoncé caused further speculation via her nonprofit BeyGood's Twitter account hinting at her upcoming seventh studio album.[230] On June 15, 2022, Beyoncé officially announced her seventh studio album, titled Renaissance.[231] The lead single of Renaissance, \"Break My Soul\", was released on June 20, 2022.[232] The album was released on July 29, 2022.[233][234] \"Break My Soul\" became Beyoncé's 20th top ten single on the Billboard Hot 100, which made her join Paul McCartney and Michael Jackson as the only artists in Hot 100 history to achieve at least twenty top tens as a solo artist and ten as a member of a group.[235] As Renaissance was released, Beyoncé announced that the album was the first installment of a trilogy she conceived and recorded over three years during the COVID-19 pandemic. A time she found to be her \"most creative [period].\"[236][231] The three recorded projects are designated into acts under Roman numerals.[237] Upon release, Renaissance received universal acclaim from critics.[238] Renaissance debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart, making her the first female artist to have her first seven studio albums debut at number one in the United States.[239] \"Break My Soul\" concurrently rose to number-one on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming the twelfth song to do so across her career discography.[240] On January 21, 2023, Beyoncé performed in Dubai at a private show.[241] The performance, which was her first full concert in more than four years, was delivered to an audience of influencers and journalists.[242] Beyoncé was reportedly paid $24 million to perform.[243] Beyoncé faced criticism for her decision to perform in the United Arab Emirates where homosexuality is illegal.[243][242][244] On February 1, Beyoncé announced the Renaissance World Tour with dates in North America and Europe,[245] becoming for a short-span, the highest-grossing tour by a female artist.[246] On July 28, Beyoncé appeared on \"Delresto (Echoes)\", the second single from rapper Travis Scott's album Utopia, eventually becoming her 100th career appearance on the Billboard Hot 100 chart (encompassing Destiny's Child, her solo career, and musical duo The Carters).[247] On November 30, 2023, Beyoncé released documentary concert film Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé written, directed, and produced by her in collaboration with film distributor AMC Theatres. The film chronicles the development and execution of Beyoncé's Renaissance World Tour, and contained new song \"My House\" in the end credits.[248] In February 2024, Beyoncé launched her hair care brand Cécred.[249] On February 11, 2024, immediately following a partner commercial with Verizon for the Super Bowl LVIII, she announced the second installment of her trilogy project and released its first two songs, \"Texas Hold 'Em\" and \"16 Carriages\".[250] \"Texas Hold 'Em\" became her highest chart debut in her career, her ninth solo number-one and her thirteenth across all credits on the Billboard Hot 100. On March 12, 2024, she announced the album's title, Cowboy Carter.[251][252] A country and gospel-tinged record, it was released on March 29 to universal acclaim from critics, and includes collaborations with artists including Tanner Adell and her daughter Rumi Carter, Miley Cyrus, Tiera Kennedy, Willie Jones, Post Malone, Linda Martell, Willie Nelson, Shaboozey, Brittney Spencer, Dolly Parton, and Reyna Roberts.[253] In July 2024, NBC released two promotional commercials featuring Beyoncé for their coverage of the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, France.[254] Set to Cowboy Carter songs \"Ya Ya\" and \"Just For Fun\", she introduced the entire USA Olympic Team and Gold-medal gymnast Simone Biles, respectively.[255][256] On August 20, Beyoncé announced SirDavis, a whiskey in collaboration with Moët Hennessy developed for years prior and co-founded with master distiller Dr. Bill Lumsden.[257] In October 2024, Levi's launched a four-part global campaign with Beyoncé titled \"Reiimagine\" that will stretch into 2025 and focus on women's history of the company, using Cowboy Carter track \"Levii's Jeans\".[258] The first commercial starring Beyoncé amassed 2.4 billion impressions in under a month.[259] Beyoncé reprised her role as Nala for Mufasa: The Lion King, a prequel to the 2019 remake, released in December 2024.[260] On December 25, 2024, Beyoncé headlined the first ever NFL Christmas Gameday Halftime Show.[261] With \"Single Ladies\", clearly I'd just gotten married, and people want to get married every day – then there was the whole Justin Timberlake thing [recreating the video] on Saturday Night Live, and it was also the year YouTube blew up. With \"Irreplaceable\", the aggressive lyrics, the acoustic guitar, and the 808 drum machine – those things don't typically go together, and it sounded fresh. \"Crazy in Love\" was another one of those classic moments in pop culture that none of us expected. I asked Jay to get on the song the night before I had to turn my album in – thank God he did. It still never gets old, no matter how many times I sing it. Critics have described Beyoncé's voice as being mezzo-soprano.[263][264] Jody Rosen highlights her tone and timbre as particularly distinctive, describing her voice as \"one of the most compelling instruments in popular music\".[265] Her vocal abilities mean she is identified as the centerpiece of Destiny's Child.[266] Jon Pareles of The New York Times commented that her voice is \"velvety yet tart, with an insistent flutter and reserves of soul belting\".[267] Rosen notes that the hip hop era highly influenced Beyoncé's unique rhythmic vocal style, but also finds her quite traditionalist in her use of balladry, gospel and falsetto.[265] Other critics praise her range and power, with Chris Richards of The Washington Post saying she was \"capable of punctuating any beat with goose-bump-inducing whispers or full-bore diva-roars.\"[268] On the 2023 Rolling Stone's list of the 200 Greatest Singers of all time, Beyoncé ranked at number 8, with the publication noting that \"in [her] voice lies the entire history of Black music\".[269] Beyoncé's music is generally R&B,[270][271] pop[270][272] and hip hop[273] but she also incorporates soul and funk into her songs. 4 demonstrated Beyoncé's exploration of 1990s-style R&B, as well as further use of soul and hip hop than compared to previous releases.[262] While she almost exclusively releases English songs, Beyoncé recorded several Spanish songs for Irreemplazable (re-recordings of songs from B'Day for a Spanish-language audience), and the re-release of B'Day. To record these, Beyoncé was coached phonetically by American record producer Rudy Perez.[274] Beyoncé has received co-writing credits for most of her songs.[275] Her early songs with Destiny's Child were personally driven and female-empowerment themed compositions like \"Independent Women\" and \"Survivor\", but after the start of her relationship with Jay-Z, she transitioned to more man-tending anthems such as \"Cater 2 U\".[276] Beyoncé's songwriting process is also known for combining parts of different tracks, resulting in alteration of song structures. Sia, who co-wrote \"Pretty Hurts\", called Beyoncé \"very Frankenstein when she comes to songs\";[277] Diana Gordon, who co-wrote \"Don't Hurt Yourself\" called her a \"scientist of songs\";[278] Caroline Polachek who co-wrote \"No Angel\", called her a \"genius writer and producer for this reason. She's so good at seeing connections.\"[279] In 2001, she became the first Black woman and second female lyricist to win the Pop Songwriter of the Year award at the ASCAP Pop Music Awards.[20][280] Beyoncé was the third woman to have writing credits on three number-one songs (\"Irreplaceable\", \"Grillz\" and \"Check on It\") in the same year, after Carole King in 1971 and Mariah Carey in 1991. She is tied with American lyricist Diane Warren at third with nine songwriting credits on number-one singles.[281] The latter wrote her song \"I Was Here\" for 4, which was motivated by the September 11 attacks.[282] In May 2011, Billboard magazine listed Beyoncé at number 17 on their list of the Top 20 Hot 100 Songwriters for having co-written eight singles that hit number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. She was one of only three women on that list, along with Alicia Keys and Taylor Swift.[283] Beyoncé has received criticism, including from journalists and musicians, for the extensive writing credits on her songs.[275] The controversy surrounding her songwriting credits began with interviews in which she attributed herself as the songwriter for songs in which she was a co-writer[284] or for which her contributions were marginal.[275] In a cover story for Vanity Fair in 2005, she claimed to have \"written\" several number-one songs for Destiny's Child, contrary to the credits, which list her as a co-writer among others.[284] During a 2007 interview with Barbara Walters, she claimed to have conceived the musical idea for the Destiny's Child song \"Bootylicious\",[285] which provoked the song's producer Rob Fusari to call her father and then-manager Mathew Knowles in protest over the claim. In 2010, Fusari told Billboard: \"[Knowles] explained to me, in a nice way, he said, 'People don't want to hear about Rob Fusari, producer from Livingston, N.J. No offense, but that's not what sells records. What sells records is people believing that the artist is everything.'\"[286] However, in an interview for Entertainment Weekly in 2016, Fusari said Beyoncé \"had the 'Bootylicious' concept in her head. That was totally her. She knew what she wanted to say. It was very urban pop angle that they were taking on the record.\"[287] I am really passionate about all of the steps [during] the production [...] I love to stack vocals, and I love to create my own little Oreo with arrangements, sometimes it can be thousands of vocals [and then] I go back and then kind of piece things together, because usually the songs are way too long [...] I go back and edit the structure of the song. [I] make sure that [...] every section has an intention, so that takes months. [...] I hear certain elements of things that go with things that are opposites. I am rarely happy with one track, it's usually four or five things put together that again don't really go together. I am so excited when I'm able to adjust the tempo and key and mute certain elements that don't complement and put opposites together. Sometimes it's just like the EQ of a synth or the warmth of a bass or the distortion of a bass that's on a different song and I can hear like, 'Ah! That's exactly what is missing to make the track full and complete!' Beyoncé's collaborators frequently mention her talent and involvement in the record production of her songs,[289][290] sometimes describing her as a genius in the skill.[291] She is known to have favorite saturation and distortion plug‑ins, intentionality about stereo imaging and concentration on individual elements of her songs as a \"focal point\" in production.[292] Beyoncé names Michael Jackson as her major musical influence.[293][294] Aged five, Beyoncé attended her first ever concert where Jackson performed and she claims to have realized her purpose.[295] When she presented him with a tribute award at the World Music Awards in 2006, Beyoncé said, \"if it wasn't for Michael Jackson, I would never ever have performed.\"[296] Beyoncé was heavily influenced by Tina Turner, and once said \"Tina Turner is someone that I admire, because she made her strength feminine and sexy\".[297][298] She admires Diana Ross as an \"all-around entertainer\",[299] and Whitney Houston, who she said \"inspired me to get up there and do what she did.\"[300][301] Beyoncé cited Madonna as an influence \"not only for her musical style, but also for her business sense\",[302] saying that she wanted to \"follow in the footsteps of Madonna and be a powerhouse and have my own empire.\"[303] She also credits Mariah Carey's singing and her song \"Vision of Love\" as influencing her to begin practicing vocal runs as a child.[304][305] Her other musical influences include Rachelle Ferrell,[306] Aaliyah,[307] Janet Jackson,[308] Prince,[309] Lauryn Hill,[299] Sade Adu,[310] Donna Summer,[311] Fairuz,[312][313] Mary J. Blige,[314] Selena,[315] Anita Baker, and Toni Braxton.[299] The feminism and female empowerment themes on Beyoncé's second solo album B'Day were inspired by her role in Dreamgirls[316] and by singer Josephine Baker.[317] Beyoncé paid homage to Baker by performing \"Déjà Vu\" at the 2006 Fashion Rocks concert wearing Baker's trademark mini-hula skirt embellished with fake bananas.[318] Beyoncé's third solo album, I Am... Sasha Fierce, was inspired by Jay-Z and especially by Etta James, whose \"boldness\" inspired Beyoncé to explore other musical genres and styles.[319] Her fourth solo album, 4, was inspired by Fela Kuti, 1990s R&B, Earth, Wind & Fire, DeBarge, Lionel Richie, Teena Marie, The Jackson 5, New Edition, Adele, Florence and the Machine, and Prince.[262] Beyoncé has stated that she is personally inspired by Michelle Obama (the 44th First Lady of the United States), saying \"she proves you can do it all\",[320] and has described Oprah Winfrey as \"the definition of inspiration and a strong woman.\"[299] She has also discussed how Jay-Z is a continuing inspiration to her, both with what she describes as his lyrical genius and in the obstacles he has overcome in his life.[321] Beyoncé has expressed admiration for the artist Jean-Michel Basquiat, posting in a letter \"what I find in the work of Jean-Michel Basquiat, I search for in every day in music ... he is lyrical and raw\".[322][323] Beyoncé has also cited Cher as a fashion inspiration.[324] In 2006, Beyoncé introduced her all-female tour band Suga Mama (also the name of a song on B'Day) which includes bassists, drummers, guitarists, horn players, keyboardists and percussionists.[325] Her background singers, The Mamas, consist of Montina Cooper-Donnell, Crystal Collins and Tiffany Moniqué Riddick. They made their debut appearance at the 2006 BET Awards and re-appeared in the music videos for \"Irreplaceable\" and \"Green Light\".[274] The band have supported Beyoncé in most subsequent live performances, including her 2007 concert tour The Beyoncé Experience, I Am... Tour (2009–2010), The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour (2013–2014) and The Formation World Tour (2016). Beyoncé has received praise for her stage presence and voice during live performances. According to Barbara Ellen of The Guardian, Beyoncé is the most in-charge female artist she's seen onstage.[326] Similarly, Alice Jones of The Independent wrote she \"takes her role as entertainer so seriously she's almost too good.\"[327] The ex-President of Def Jam L.A. Reid has described Beyoncé as the greatest entertainer alive.[328] Jim Farber of the Daily News and Stephanie Classen of The StarPhoenix both praised her strong voice and her stage presence.[329][330] I choose to invest my time and energy only in projects that I am passionate about. Once I've committed, I give it all of me. I start with identifying my intention and making sure that I am aligned with the collaborators for the same purpose. It takes enormous patience to rock with me. My process is tedious. I review every second of footage several times and know it backwards and forwards. I find every ounce of magic and then I deconstruct it. I keep building more layers and repeat this editing process for months. I won't let up until it's undeniably reached its full potential. I believe my strength is understanding how storytelling, music, lighting, angles, fashion, art direction, history, dance, and editing work together. They are all equally important. Beyoncé has worked with numerous directors for her music videos throughout her career, including Melina Matsoukas, Jonas Åkerlund, and Jake Nava. Bill Condon, director of Beauty and the Beast, stated that the Lemonade visuals in particular served as inspiration for his film, commenting, \"You look at Beyoncé's brilliant movie Lemonade, this genre is taking on so many different forms ... I do think that this very old-school break-out-into-song traditional musical is something that people understand again and really want.\"[332] Described as being \"sexy, seductive and provocative\" when performing on stage, Beyoncé has said that she originally created the alter ego \"Sasha Fierce\" to keep that stage persona separate from who she really is. She described Sasha Fierce as being \"too aggressive, too strong, too sassy [and] too sexy\", stating, \"I'm not like her in real life at all.\"[333] Sasha was conceived during the making of \"Crazy in Love\", and Beyoncé introduced her with the release of her 2008 album, I Am... Sasha Fierce. In February 2010, she announced in an interview with Allure magazine that she was comfortable enough with herself to no longer need Sasha Fierce.[334] However, Beyoncé announced in May 2012 that she would bring her back for her Revel Presents: Beyoncé Live shows later that month.[335] Beyoncé has been described as having sex appeal, with music journalist Touré writing that since the release of Dangerously in Love, she has \"become a crossover sex symbol\".[336] When off stage, Beyoncé says that while she likes to dress sexily, her onstage dress \"is absolutely for the stage\".[337] Due to her curves and the term's catchiness, in the 2000s, the media often used the term \"bootylicious\" (a portmanteau of the words \"booty\" and \"delicious\") to describe Beyoncé,[338][339] the term popularized by the single of the same name by her group Destiny's Child. In 2006, it was added to the Oxford English Dictionary.[340] In September 2010, Beyoncé made her runway modelling debut at Tom Ford's Spring/Summer 2011 fashion show.[341] She was named the \"World's Most Beautiful Woman\" by People[342] and the \"Hottest Female Singer of All Time\" by Complex in 2012.[343] In January 2013, GQ placed her on its cover, featuring her atop its \"100 Sexiest Women of the 21st Century\" list.[344][345] VH1 listed her at number 1 on its 100 Sexiest Artists list.[346] Several wax figures of Beyoncé are found at Madame Tussauds Wax Museums in major cities around the world.[347] According to Italian fashion designer Roberto Cavalli, Beyoncé uses different fashion styles to work with her music while performing.[348] Her mother co-wrote a book, published in 2002, titled Destiny's Style,[349] an account of how fashion affected the trio's success.[350] The B'Day Anthology Video Album showed many instances of fashion-oriented footage, depicting classic to contemporary wardrobe styles.[351] In 2007, Beyoncé was featured on the cover of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue, becoming the second African American woman after model and television personality Tyra Banks,[352] and People magazine recognized Beyoncé as the best-dressed celebrity.[353] Beyoncé has been nicknamed \"Queen Bey\" by publications over the years. The term is a reference to the common phrase \"queen bee\", a term used for the leader of a group of females. The nickname also refers to the Queen bee of a beehive, with her fan base being named \"BeyHive\". BeyHive was previously titled \"The Beyontourage\", (a portmanteau of Beyoncé and entourage), but was changed after online petitions on Twitter and online news reports during competitions.[354] In 2006, the animal rights organization People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), criticized Beyoncé for wearing and using fur in her clothing line House of Deréon.[355] Emmett Price, a professor of music at Northeastern University, wrote in 2007 that he thinks race plays a role in many criticisms of Beyoncé's image, saying white celebrities who dress similarly do not attract as many comments.[356] In 2008, the French personal care company L'Oréal was accused of whitening her skin in their Feria hair color advertisements, responding that \"it is categorically untrue\",[357][358] and in 2013, Beyoncé herself criticized H&M for their proposed \"retouching\" of promotional images of her, and according to Vogue requested that only \"natural pictures be used\".[359] Beyoncé has been a vocal advocate for the Black Lives Matter movement. The release of \"Formation\" on February 6, 2016, saw her celebrate her Sub-Saharan Black African ancestry, with the song's music video featuring pro-black imagery and a shot of wall graffiti that says \"Stop shooting us\". The day after the song's release, she performed it at the 2016 Super Bowl halftime show with back up dancers dressed to represent the Black Panther Party. This incited criticism from conservative politicians and police officers, with some police boycotting Beyoncé's then upcoming Formation World Tour.[360] Beyoncé responded to the backlash by releasing tour merchandise that said \"Boycott Beyoncé\",[361][362][363] and later clarified her sentiment, saying: \"Anyone who perceives my message as anti-police is completely mistaken. I have so much admiration and respect for officers and the families of officers who sacrifice themselves to keep us safe,\" Beyoncé said. \"But let's be clear: I am against police brutality and injustice. Those are two separate things.\"[364] In 2002, Beyoncé and Jay-Z collaborated on the song \"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\",[365] which appeared on his seventh album The Blueprint 2: The Gift & The Curse (2002).[366] Beyoncé appeared as Jay-Z's girlfriend in the music video for the song, fueling speculation about their relationship.[367] On April 4, 2008, Beyoncé and Jay-Z married without publicity.[368] As of April 2014[update], the couple had sold a combined 300 million records together.[168] They are known for their private relationship, although they have appeared to become more relaxed since 2013.[369] Both have acknowledged difficulty that arose in their marriage after Jay-Z had an affair.[370][371] Beyoncé miscarried around 2010 or 2011, describing it as \"the saddest thing\" she had ever endured.[372] She returned to the studio and wrote music to cope with the loss. In April 2011, Beyoncé and Jay-Z traveled to Paris to shoot the album cover for 4, and she unexpectedly became pregnant in Paris.[373] In August, the couple attended the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, at which Beyoncé performed \"Love On Top\" and ended the performance by revealing she was pregnant.[374] Her appearance helped that year's MTV Video Music Awards become the most-watched broadcast in MTV history, pulling in 12.4 million viewers;[375] the announcement was listed in Guinness World Records for \"most tweets per second recorded for a single event\" on Twitter,[376] receiving 8,868 tweets per second[377] and \"Beyonce pregnant\" was the most Googled phrase the week of August 29, 2011.[378] On January 7, 2012, Beyoncé gave birth to a daughter, Blue Ivy, at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.[379] Following the release of Lemonade, which included the single \"Sorry\", in 2016, speculations arose about Jay-Z's alleged infidelity with a mistress referred to as \"Becky\". Jon Pareles in The New York Times pointed out that many of the accusations were \"aimed specifically and recognizably\" at him.[380] Similarly, Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone noted the lines \"Suck on my balls, I've had enough\" were an \"unmistakable hint\" that the lyrics revolve around Jay-Z.[381] On February 1, 2017, she revealed on her Instagram account that she was expecting twins. Her announcement gained over 6.3 million likes within eight hours, breaking the world record for the most liked image on the website at the time.[382] On July 13, 2017, Beyoncé uploaded the first image of herself and the twins onto her Instagram account, confirming their birth date as a month prior, on June 13, 2017,[383] with the post becoming the second most liked on Instagram, behind her own pregnancy announcement.[384] The twins, a daughter named Rumi and a son named Sir, were born at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in California via caesarean section. She wrote of her pregnancy and its aftermath in the September 2018 issue of Vogue, in which she had full control of the cover, shot at Hammerwood Park by photographer Tyler Mitchell.[385][386] Beyoncé performed \"America the Beautiful\" at President Barack Obama's 2009 presidential inauguration, as well as \"At Last\" during the first inaugural dance at the Neighborhood Ball two days later.[387] The couple held a fundraiser at Jay-Z's 40/40 Club in Manhattan for President Obama's 2012 presidential campaign[388] which raised $4 million.[389] Beyoncé voted for Obama in the 2012 presidential election.[390] She performed the American national anthem \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" at his second inauguration in January 2013.[147] The Washington Post reported in May 2015, that Beyoncé attended a major celebrity fundraiser for 2016 presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.[391] She also headlined for Clinton in a concert held the weekend before Election Day the next year. In this performance, Beyoncé and her entourage of backup dancers wore pantsuits; a clear allusion to Clinton's frequent dress-of-choice. The backup dancers also wore \"I'm with her\" tee shirts, the campaign slogan for Clinton. In a brief speech at this performance Beyoncé said, \"I want my daughter to grow up seeing a woman lead our country and knowing that her possibilities are limitless.\"[392] She endorsed the bid of Beto O'Rourke during the 2018 United States Senate election in Texas.[393] In July 2024, Beyoncé gave Vice President Kamala Harris permission to use Lemonade promotional single \"Freedom\" as the official song for her 2024 presidential campaign.[394][395] Harris subsequently launched a digital ad in support of her candidacy featuring the song.[396] In October 2024, Beyoncé, alongside her mother Tina and Kelly Rowland endorsed Harris for president at a campaign rally in her hometown of Houston.[397] In a 2013 interview with Vogue, Beyoncé stated that she considered herself to be \"a modern-day feminist\".[398] She would later align herself more publicly with the movement, sampling \"We should all be feminists\", a speech delivered by Nigerian author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie at a TEDx talk in April 2013, in her song \"Flawless\", released later that year.[399] The next year she performed live at the MTV Video Awards in front a giant backdrop reading \"Feminist\".[400] Her self-identification incited a circulation of opinions and debate about whether her feminism is aligned with older, more established feminist ideals. Annie Lennox, celebrated artist and feminist advocate, referred to Beyoncé's use of her word feminist as 'feminist lite'.[401] Adichie responded with \"her type of feminism is not mine, as it is the kind that, at the same time, gives quite a lot of space to the necessity of men.\"[402] Adichie expands upon what \"feminist lite\" means to her, referring that \"more troubling is the idea, in Feminism Lite, that men are naturally superior but should be expected to 'treat women well'\" and \"we judge powerful women more harshly than we judge powerful men. And Feminism Lite enables this.\"[403] Beyoncé responded about her intent by utilizing the definition of feminist with her platform was to \"give clarity to the true meaning\" behind it. She says to understand what being a feminist is, \"it's very simple. It's someone who believes in equal rights for men and women.\" She advocated to provide equal opportunities for young boys and girls, men and women must begin to understand the double standards that remain persistent in our societies and the issue must be illuminated in effort to start making changes.[404] She has also contributed to the Ban Bossy campaign, which uses TV and social media to encourage leadership in girls.[405] Following Beyoncé's public identification as a feminist, the sexualized nature of her performances and the fact that she championed her marriage was questioned.[406] In December 2012, Beyoncé along with a variety of other celebrities teamed up and produced a video campaign for \"Demand A Plan\", a bipartisan effort by a group of 950 U.S. mayors and others[407] designed to influence the federal government into rethinking its gun control laws, following the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.[408] Beyoncé publicly endorsed same-sex marriage on March 26, 2013, after the Supreme Court debate on California's Proposition 8.[409] She spoke against North Carolina's Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act, a bill passed (and later repealed) that discriminated against the LGBT community in public places in a statement during her concert in Raleigh as part of the Formation World Tour in 2016.[410] She has condemned police brutality against black Americans. She and Jay-Z attended a rally in 2013 in response to the acquittal of George Zimmerman for the killing of Trayvon Martin.[411] The film for her sixth album Lemonade included the mothers of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown and Eric Garner, holding pictures of their sons in the video for \"Freedom\".[412] In a 2016 interview with Elle, Beyoncé responded to the controversy surrounding her song \"Formation\" which was perceived to be critical of the police. She clarified, \"I am against police brutality and injustice. Those are two separate things. If celebrating my roots and culture during Black History Month made anyone uncomfortable, those feelings were there long before a video and long before me\".[413] In February 2017, Beyoncé spoke out against the withdrawal of protections for transgender students in public schools by Donald Trump's presidential administration. Posting a link to the 100 Days of Kindness campaign on her Facebook page, Beyoncé voiced her support for transgender youth and joined a roster of celebrities who spoke out against Trump's decision.[414] Beyoncé has been documented pursuing many passions, sometimes being described as a renaissance woman.[415][416] Some of these include canvas painting,[417] video editing,[418] poetry,[419] scriptwriting,[420] lighting and stage design,[421] animation and clothes design,[422] photography,[423] cultural historiography[424] and beekeeping (with around 80,000 bees).[331] I started painting portraits of women [in 2002], while filming Austin Powers [...] I got hooked and wouldn't sleep. I made this special room with saris and pillows. I would light candles, play Miles Davis and Björk, and paint all night. It was very therapeutic. Whenever I finish one of my paintings, I try to figure out what it represents in my life. I'll be like, 'It's dark behind her and light in front of her, so a dark period must be coming to an end. Something light and beautiful is going to happen.' Forbes magazine began reporting on Beyoncé's earnings in 2008, calculating that the $80 million earned between June 2007 to June 2008, for her music, tour, films and clothing line made her the world's best-paid music personality at the time, above Madonna and Celine Dion.[425][426] It placed her fourth on the Celebrity 100 list in 2009[427] and ninth on the \"Most Powerful Women in the World\" list in 2010.[428] The following year, the magazine placed her eighth on the \"Best-Paid Celebrities Under 30\" list, having earned $35 million in the past year for her clothing line and endorsement deals. In 2012, Forbes placed Beyoncé at number 16 on the Celebrity 100 list, twelve places lower than three years ago yet still having earned $40 million in the past year for her album 4, clothing line and endorsement deals.[429][430] In 2012, Beyoncé and Jay-Z placed at number one on the \"World's Highest-Paid Celebrity Couples\", for collectively earning $78 million.[431] The couple made it into the previous year's Guinness World Records as the \"highest-earning power couple\" for collectively earning $122 million in 2009.[432] For the years 2009 to 2011, Beyoncé earned an average of $70 million per year, and earned $40 million in 2012.[433] In 2013, Beyoncé's endorsements of Pepsi and H&M made her and Jay-Z the world's first billion-dollar couple in the music industry.[434] That year, Beyoncé was listed as the fourth-most-powerful celebrity in the Forbes rankings.[435] In June 2014, Beyoncé ranked at number one on the Forbes Celebrity 100 list, earning an estimated $115 million throughout June 2013 – June 2014. This in turn was the first time she had topped the Celebrity 100 list as well as being her highest yearly earnings to date.[436] In 2016, Beyoncé ranked at number 34 on the Celebrity 100 list with earnings of $54 million. She and Jay-Z also topped the highest-paid celebrity couple list, with combined earnings of $107.5 million.[437] Beyoncé is one of the wealthiest musical artists. As of 2018[update], Forbes calculated her net worth to be $355 million, and in June of the same year, ranked her as the 35th-highest-earning celebrity, with annual earnings of $60 million. This tied Beyoncé with Madonna as the only two female artists to earn more than $100 million within a single year twice.[438][439] As a couple, Beyoncé and Jay-Z have a combined net worth of $1.16 billion.[440] In July 2017, Billboard announced that Beyoncé was the highest-paid musician of 2016, with an estimated total of $62.1 million.[441] By December 2023, Forbes estimated Beyoncé's net worth to be $800 million.[442] In 2023, the couple bought a house in Malibu, California, designed by the architect Tadao Ando, for $200 million. It established a record for the most expensive residence sold in the state of California.[443] Beyoncé's success has led to her becoming a cultural icon and earning her the nickname \"Queen Bey\".[444] Constance Grady wrote for Vox, \"The transformation of Beyoncé from well-liked pop star to cultural icon came in three phases, punctuated by the self-titled Beyoncé album of 2013, 2016's Lemonade, and 2018's Homecoming concert at Coachella.\"[445] In The New Yorker, music critic Jody Rosen described Beyoncé as \"the most important and compelling popular musician of the twenty-first century ... the result, the logical end point, of a century-plus of pop.\"[446] She topped NPR list of the \"21st Century's Most Influential Women Musicians\".[447] James Clear, in his book Atomic Habits (2018), draws a parallel between Beyoncé's success and the dramatic transformations in modern society: \"In the last one hundred years, we have seen the rise of the car, the airplane, the television, the personal computer, the internet, the smartphone, and Beyoncé.\"[448] The Observer named her Artist of the Decade (2000s) in 2009.[449] Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Alex Suskind opined that Beyoncé was the decade's (2010s) defining pop star, stating \"no one dominated music in the 2010s like Queen Bey\", explaining that her \"songs, album rollouts, stage presence, social justice initiatives, and disruptive public relations strategy have influenced the way we've viewed music since 2010.\"[450] Based on Billboard rankings of chart success and sales, Beyonce was ranked 9th on the Top R&B and Hip Hop artists of the 2010s decade chart, behind the likes of Drake, Rihanna, Chris Brown, Nicki Minaj, Post Malone, The Weeknd, Kendrick Lamar and Lil Wayne in ranks 1 through 8, respectively.[451] British publication NME also shared similar thoughts on her impact in the 2010s, including Beyoncé on their list of the \"10 Artists Who Defined The Decade\".[452] In 2018, Rolling Stone included her on its Millennial 100 list.[453] Music critics have often credited Beyoncé with the invention of the staccato rap-singing style that has since dominated pop, R&B, and rap music. Lakin Starling of The Fader wrote that Beyoncé's innovative implementation of the delivery style on Destiny's Child's 1999 album The Writing's on the Wall invented a new form of R&B.[454] The staccato rap-singing style continued to be used in the music industry in the late 2010s and early 2020s; Aaron Williams of Uproxx described Beyoncé as the \"primary pioneer\" of the rapping style that dominates the music industry today, with many rappers implementing Beyoncé's rap-singing.[455] Michael Eric Dyson agrees, saying in 2019 that Beyoncé \"changed the whole genre\" and has become the \"godmother\" of mumble rappers, who use the staccato rap-singing cadence. Dyson added: \"She doesn't get credit for the remarkable way in which she changed the musical vocabulary of contemporary art.\"[456] Beyoncé has been credited with reviving the album as an art form in an era dominated by singles and streaming. This started with her 2011 album 4; while mainstream R&B artists were forgoing albums-led R&B in favor of singles-led EDM, Beyoncé aimed to place the focus back on albums as an art form and re-establish R&B as a mainstream concern.[457] This remained a focus of Beyoncé's, and in 2013, she made her eponymous album only available to purchase as a full album on iTunes, rather than being able to purchase individual tracks or consume the album via streaming. Kaitlin Menza of Marie Claire wrote that this made listeners \"experience the album as one whole sonic experience, the way people used to, noting the musical and lyrical themes\".[458] Jamieson Cox for The Verge described how Beyoncé's 2013 album initiated a gradual trend of albums becoming more cohesive and self-referential, and this phenomenon reached its endpoint with Lemonade, which set \"a new standard for pop storytelling at the highest possible scale\".[459] Megan Carpentier of The Guardian wrote that with Lemonade, Beyoncé has \"almost revived the album format\" by releasing an album that can only be listened to in its entirety.[460] Myf Warhurst on Double J's \"Lunch With Myf\" explained that while most artists' albums consist of a few singles plus filler songs, Beyoncé \"brought the album back\", changing the art form of the album \"to a narrative with an arc and a story and you have to listen to the entire thing to get the concept\".[461] She is known for coining popular phrases such as \"put a ring on it\", a euphemism for marriage proposal, \"I woke up like this\", which started a trend of posting morning selfies with the hashtag #iwokeuplikethis, and \"boy, bye\", which was used as part of the Democratic National Committee's campaign for the 2020 election.[462][463] Similarly, she also came up with the phrase \"visual album\" following the release of her fifth studio album, which had a video for every song. This has been recreated by many other artists since, such as Frank Ocean and Melanie Martinez.[464] The album also popularized surprise releases, with many artists releasing songs, videos or albums with no prior announcement, such as Taylor Swift, Nicki Minaj, Eminem, Frank Ocean, Jay-Z and Drake.[465] In January 2012, research scientist Bryan Lessard named Scaptia beyonceae, a species of horse-fly found in Northern Queensland, Australia after Beyoncé due to the fly's unique golden hairs on its abdomen.[466] Beyoncé has received numerous awards and is the most-awarded female artist of all time.[467] Having sold over 200 million records worldwide (a further 60 million additionally with Destiny's Child), Beyoncé is one of the best-selling music artists of all time.[468] The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) listed Beyoncé as the top certified artist of the 2000s decade, with a total of 64 certifications.[469][470] In 2009, Billboard named her the Top Female Artist and Top Radio Songs Artist of the Decade.[471][472][473] In 2010, Billboard named her in their Top 50 R&B/Hip-Hop Artists of the Past 25 Years list at number 15.[474] In 2012, VH1 ranked her third on their list of the \"100 Greatest Women in Music\", behind Mariah Carey and Madonna.[475] In 2002, she received Songwriter of the Year from American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers becoming the First African American woman to win the award. In 2004 and 2019, she received NAACP Image Award for Entertainer of the Year and the Soul Train Music Award for Sammy Davis Jr. – Entertainer of the Year. In 2005, she also received APEX Award at the Trumpet Award honoring the achievements of Black African Americans. In 2007, Beyoncé received the International Artist of Excellence award by the American Music Awards. She also received Honorary Otto at the Bravo Otto. The following year, she received the Legend Award for Outstanding Contribution to the Arts at the World Music Awards[476] and Career Achievement Award at the LOS40 Music Awards. In 2010, she received the Award of Honor for Artist of the Decade at the NRJ Music Award.[477] At the 2011 Billboard Music Awards, Beyoncé received the inaugural Billboard Millennium Award.[478] Beyoncé received the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award at the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards and was honored as Honorary Mother of the Year at the Australian Mother of the Year Award in Barnardo's Australia for her Humanitarian Effort in the region and the Council of Fashion Designers of America Fashion Icon Award in 2016. In 2019, alongside Jay-Z, she received GLAAD Vanguard Award which is presented to a member of the entertainment community who does not identify as LGBT but who has made a significant difference in promoting equal rights for LGBT people.[479] In 2020, she was awarded the BET Humanitarian Award. Consequence named her the 30th best singer of all time.[480] Beyoncé has won 32 Grammy Awards, both as a solo artist and member of Destiny's Child and The Carters, making her the most honored individual by the Grammys.[481][482] She is also the most nominated artist in Grammy Award history with a total of 88 nominations.[483] \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\" won Song of the Year in 2010 while \"Say My Name\",[47] \"Crazy in Love\" and \"Drunk in Love\" have each won Best R&B Song. Dangerously in Love, B'Day and I Am... Sasha Fierce have won Best Contemporary R&B Album, while Lemonade has won Best Urban Contemporary Album. Beyoncé set the record for the most Grammy awards won by a female artist in one night in 2010 when she won six awards, breaking the tie she previously held with Alicia Keys, Norah Jones, Alison Krauss, and Amy Winehouse, with Adele equaling this in 2012.[484] Beyoncé has won 30 MTV Video Music Awards, making her the joint most-decorated artist in Video Music Award history.[485] She won 26 awards as a solo artist, two awards each with The Carters and Destiny's Child, making her lifetime total of 30 VMAs.[486] \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\" and \"Formation\" won Video of the Year in 2009 and 2016 respectively. Beyoncé tied the record set by Lady Gaga in 2010 for the most VMAs won in one night for a female artist with eight in 2016.[188] She is also the most-awarded and nominated artist in BET Award history,[487] winning 36 awards (including two with Destiny's Child) from over 80 nominations,[488] the most-awarded artist of the Soul Train Music Awards with 25 wins (21 as a soloist and four with Destiny's child),[489] and the most-decorated artist at the NAACP Image Awards with 25 wins as a solo artist and five with Destiny's Child.[490][491] Following her role in Dreamgirls, Beyoncé was nominated for Best Original Song for \"Listen\" and Best Actress at the Golden Globe Awards,[492] and Outstanding Actress in a Motion Picture at the NAACP Image Awards.[493] Beyoncé won two awards at the Broadcast Film Critics Association Awards 2006; Best Song for \"Listen\" and Best Original Soundtrack for Dreamgirls: Music from the Motion Picture.[494] According to Fuse in 2014, Beyoncé is the second-most award-winning artist of all time, after Michael Jackson.[495][496] Lemonade won a Peabody Award in 2017.[497] In 2022, \"Be Alive\" was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song,[498] the Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Song,[499] and the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song.[500] She was named on the 2016 BBC Radio 4 Woman's Hour Power List as one of seven women judged to have had the biggest impact on women's lives over the past 70 years, alongside Margaret Thatcher, Barbara Castle, Helen Brook, Germaine Greer, Jayaben Desai and Bridget Jones,[501] She was named the Most Powerful Woman in Music on the same list in 2020.[502] In the same year, Billboard named her with Destiny's Child the third Greatest Music Video artists of all time, behind Madonna and Michael Jackson.[503] In June 2021, Beyoncé won the award of \"top touring artist\" of the decade (2010s) at the Pollstar Awards.[504] In that same month, Beyoncé was inducted into the Black Music & Entertainment Walk of Fame as a member of the inaugural class.[505] In 2010, Beyoncé founded her own entertainment company Parkwood Entertainment which formed as an imprint based from Columbia Records, the company began as a production unit for videos and films in 2008. Parkwood Entertainment is named after a street in Houston, Texas where Beyoncé once lived.[506] With headquarters in New York City, the company serves as an umbrella for the entertainer's various brands in music, movies, videos, and fashion. The staff of Parkwood Entertainment have experiences in arts and entertainment, from filmmaking and video production to web and fashion design. In addition to departments in marketing, digital, creative, publicity, fashion design and merchandising, the company houses a state-of-the-art editing suite, where Beyoncé works on content for her worldwide tours, music videos, and television specials. Parkwood Entertainment's first production was the musical biopic Cadillac Records (2008), in which Beyoncé starred and co-produced.[507] The company has distributed Beyoncé's albums such as her self-titled fifth studio album (2013), Lemonade (2016) and The Carters, Everything is Love (2018). Beyoncé has signed other artists to Parkwood such as Chloe x Halle, who performed at Super Bowl LIII in February 2019.[508] In February 2024, Beyoncé launched Cécred, a hair care product line developed to fit different hair textures.[249] Following its launch, she established an annual grant in collaboration with BeyGood. This is an effort to provide financial support to cosmetology students and professional hair stylists within the beauty industry.[509] A yearly $500,000 is funding cosmetology school scholarships and salon business grants across five cities chosen for their large, diverse community of hair stylists: Atlanta, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles and Clementon.[c][510] Beyoncé has worked with Pepsi since 2002,[511] and in 2004 appeared in a Gladiator-themed commercial with Britney Spears, Pink, and Enrique Iglesias.[512] In 2012, Beyoncé signed a $50 million deal to endorse Pepsi.[513] The Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPINET) wrote Beyoncé an open letter asking her to reconsider the deal because of the unhealthiness of the product and to donate the proceeds to a medical organisation.[514] Nevertheless, NetBase found that Beyoncé's campaign was the most talked about endorsement in April 2013, with a 70 percent positive audience response to the commercial and print ads.[515] Beyoncé has worked with Tommy Hilfiger for the fragrances True Star (singing a cover version of \"Wishing on a Star\")[516] and True Star Gold;[517] she also promoted Emporio Armani's Diamonds fragrance in 2007.[518] Beyoncé launched her first official fragrance, Heat, in 2010.[519] In February 2011, Beyoncé launched her second fragrance, Heat Rush.[520] Beyoncé's third fragrance, Pulse, was launched in September 2011.[521] In 2013, The Mrs. Carter Show Limited Edition version of Heat was released.[522] The six editions of Heat are the world's best-selling celebrity fragrance line,[522] with sales of over $400 million.[523] The release of a video-game Starpower: Beyoncé was cancelled after Beyoncé pulled out of a $100 million deal with GateFive who alleged the cancellation meant the sacking of 70 staff and millions of pounds lost in development.[524] It was settled out of court by her lawyers in June 2013 who said that they had cancelled because GateFive had lost its financial backers.[525] Beyoncé also has had deals with American Express,[426] Nintendo DS[526] and L'Oréal since the age of 18.[527] In March 2015, Beyoncé became a co-owner, with other artists, of the music streaming service Tidal. The service specializes in lossless audio and high definition music videos. Beyoncé's husband Jay-Z acquired the parent company of Tidal, Aspiro, in the first quarter of 2015.[528] Including Beyoncé and Jay-Z, sixteen artist stakeholders (such as Kanye West, Rihanna, Madonna, Chris Martin, Nicki Minaj and more) co-own Tidal, with the majority owning a 3% equity stake.[529] The idea of having an all artist owned streaming service was created by those involved to adapt to the increased demand for streaming within the current music industry.[530] In November 2020, Beyoncé formed a multi-year partnership with exercise equipment and media company Peloton. The partnership was formed to celebrate homecoming season in historically black colleges and universities, providing themed workout experiences inspired by Beyoncé's 2019 Homecoming film and live album after 2020's homecoming celebrations were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of the partnership, Beyoncé and Peloton are donating free memberships to all students at 10 HBCUs, and Peloton are pursuing long-term recruiting partnerships at the HCBUs. Gwen Bethel Riley, head of music at Peloton, said: \"When we had conversations with Beyoncé around how critical a social impact component was to all of us, it crystallized how important it was to embrace Homecoming as an opportunity to celebrate and create dialogue around Black culture and music, in partnership with HBCUs.\"[531] Upon news of the partnership, a decline in Peloton's shares reversed, and its shares rose by 8.6%.[532] In 2021, Beyoncé and Jay-Z partnered with Tiffany & Co. for the company's \"About Love\" campaign. Beyoncé became the fourth woman, and first Black woman, to wear the 128.54-carat Tiffany Yellow Diamond.[533] The campaign featured a robin egg blue painting by Jean-Michel Basquiat titled Equals Pi (1982).[534] Both Beyonce and the brand faced significant backlash for the campaign, as the Tiffany Yellow Diamond, which was discovered in the Kimberley diamond mines in South Africa in 1877, is classified as a blood diamond and viewed as a symbol of British colonialism over Africa.[535][536][537] Beyoncé and her mother introduced House of Deréon, a women's fashion line, in 2005.[538] The concept is inspired by three generations of women in their family, with the name paying tribute to Beyoncé's grandmother, Agnèz Deréon, a respected seamstress.[539][540] According to Tina, the overall style of the line best reflects her and Beyoncé's taste and style. Beyoncé and her mother founded their family's company Beyond Productions, which provides the licensing and brand management for House of Deréon, and its junior collection, Deréon.[538] House of Deréon pieces were exhibited in Destiny's Child's shows and tours, during their Destiny Fulfilled era.[541][542] The collection features sportswear, denim offerings with fur, outerwear and accessories that include handbags and footwear, and are available at department and specialty stores across the U.S. and Canada.[538] In 2005, Beyoncé teamed up with House of Brands, a shoe company, to produce a range of footwear for House of Deréon.[543] In January 2008, Starwave Mobile launched Beyoncé Fashion Diva, a \"high-style\" mobile game with a social networking component, featuring the House of Deréon collection.[538] In July 2009, Beyoncé and her mother launched a new junior apparel label, Sasha Fierce for Deréon, for back-to-school selling. The collection included sportswear, outerwear, handbags, footwear, eyewear, lingerie and jewelry.[544] It was available at department stores including Macy's and Dillard's, and specialty stores Jimmy Jazz and Against All Odds.[544] In May 2010, Beyoncé teamed up with clothing store C&A to launch Deréon by Beyoncé at their stores in Brazil.[545] The collection included tailored blazers with padded shoulders, little black dresses, embroidered tops and shirts and bandage dresses.[545] In October 2014, Beyoncé signed a deal to launch an activewear line of clothing with British fashion retailer Topshop.[546][547] The 50–50 venture is called Ivy Park and was launched in April 2016. The brand's name is a nod to Beyoncé's daughter and her favorite number four (IV in Roman numerals), and also references the park where she used to run in Texas.[548] She has since bought out Topshop owner Philip Green from his 50% share after he was alleged to have sexually harassed, bullied and racially abused employees.[549] She now owns the brand herself.[550] In April 2019, it was announced that Beyoncé would become a creative partner with Adidas and further develop her athletic brand Ivy Park with the company. Knowles will also develop new clothes and footwear for Adidas. Shares for the company rose 1.3% upon the news release.[551] In December 2019, they announced a launch date of January 18, 2020.[552] Beyoncé uploaded a teaser on her website and Instagram.[553] The collection was previewed on the upcoming Elle January 2020 issue, where Beyoncé is seen wearing several garments, accessories and footwear from the first collection.[554] In February 2023, The Wall Street Journal reported that the line was struggling financially with revenue falling by more than 50% over the past fiscal year to $40 million; well short of the company's $250 million projected forecast.[555] In March 2023, it was announced that Beyoncé and Adidas reached a mutual decision to end their partnership.[556][557] In March 2023, Olivier Rousteing, the creative director of Balmain, announced that he and Beyoncé collaborated on a couture collection complete with sixteen looks corresponding to the sixteen tracks on her album Renaissance. This \"Renaissance Couture\" collection marked the first time that a Black woman oversaw the development of a collection from a Parisian couture house.[558] In September 2024, Beyoncé partnered with Levi Strauss & Co. to remake a classic '80s 'Launderette' campaign.[559] Michelle Gass, the CEO of Levis Strauss & Co., shared insights regarding the advantages of the company's collaboration with Beyoncé, emphasizing that the advertising campaign could significantly enhance sales in the women's clothing segment.[560] In 2002, Beyoncé, Kelly Rowland and Tina Knowles built the Knowles-Rowland Center for Youth, a community center in Downtown Houston. After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Beyoncé and Rowland founded the Survivor Foundation to provide transitional housing to displaced families and provide means for new building construction, to which Beyoncé contributed an initial $250,000.[561] The foundation has since expanded to work with other charities in the city,[562] and also provided relief following Hurricane Ike three years later.[563] Beyoncé also donated $100,000 to the Gulf Coast Ike Relief Fund.[564] In 2007, Beyoncé founded the Knowles-Temenos Place Apartments, a housing complex offering living space for 43 displaced individuals. As of 2016, Beyoncé had donated $7 million for the maintenance of the complex.[565] After starring in Cadillac Records in 2009 and learning about Phoenix House, a non-profit drug and alcohol rehabilitation organization, Beyoncé donated her full $4 million salary from the film to the organization. Beyoncé and her mother subsequently established the Beyoncé Cosmetology Center, which offers a seven-month cosmetology training course helping Phoenix House's clients gain career skills during their recovery.[566] In January 2010, Beyoncé participated in George Clooney and Wyclef Jean's Hope for Haiti Now: A Global Benefit for Earthquake Relief telethon,[567] donated a large sum to the organization,[568] and was named the official face of the limited edition Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) \"Fashion For Haiti\" T-shirt.[569] In April 2011, Beyoncé joined forces with U.S. First Lady Michelle Obama and the National Association of Broadcasters Education Foundation, to help boost the latter's campaign against child obesity[570] by reworking her single \"Get Me Bodied\".[571] Following the death of Osama bin Laden, Beyoncé released her cover of the Lee Greenwood song \"God Bless the U.S.A.\", as a charity single to help raise funds for the New York Police and Fire Widows' and Children's Benefit Fund.[572] Beyoncé became an ambassador for the 2012 World Humanitarian Day campaign donating her song \"I Was Here\" and its music video, shot in the UN, to the campaign.[573][574] In 2013, it was announced that Beyoncé would work with Salma Hayek and Frida Giannini on a Gucci \"Chime for Change\" campaign that aims to spread female empowerment. The campaign, which aired on February 28, was set to her new music.[575] A concert for the cause took place on June 1, 2013, in London.[576] With help of the crowdfunding platform Catapult, visitors of the concert could choose between several projects promoting education of women and girls.[577][578] Beyoncé also took part in \"Miss a Meal\", a food-donation campaign,[579] and supported Goodwill Industries through online charity auctions at Charitybuzz that support job creation throughout Europe and the U.S.[580][581] Beyoncé and Jay-Z secretly donated tens of thousands of dollars to bail out Black Lives Matter protesters in Baltimore and Ferguson, as well as funded infrastructure for the establishment of Black Lives Matter chapters across the U.S.[582] Before Beyoncé's Formation World Tour show in Tampa, her team held a private luncheon for more than 20 community leaders to discuss how Beyoncé could support local charitable initiatives, including pledging on the spot to fund 10 scholarships to provide students with financial aid. Tampa Sports Authority board member Thomas Scott said: \"I don't know of a prior artist meeting with the community, seeing what their needs are, seeing how they can invest in the community. It says a lot to me about Beyoncé. She not only goes into a community and walks away with (money), but she also gives money back to that community.\"[583] In June 2016, Beyoncé donated over $82,000 to the United Way of Genesee County to support victims of the Flint water crisis. Beyoncé additionally donated money to support 14 students in Michigan with their college expenses.[584] In August 2016, Beyoncé and Jay-Z donated $1.5 million to civil rights groups including Black Lives Matter, Hands Up United and Dream Defenders.[585] After Hurricane Matthew, Beyoncé and Jay-Z donated $15 million to the Usain Bolt Foundation to support its efforts in rebuilding homes in Haiti.[586] During Hurricane Harvey in August 2017, Beyoncé launched BeyGOOD Houston to support those affected by the hurricane in Houston. The organization donated necessities such as cots, blankets, pillows, baby products, feminine products and wheelchairs, and funded long-term revitalization projects.[587] On September 8, Beyoncé visited Houston, where she sponsored a lunch for 400 survivors at her local church, visited the George R Brown Convention Center to discuss with people displaced by the flooding about their needs, served meals to those who lost their homes, and made a significant donation to local causes.[588][589] Beyoncé additionally donated $75,000 worth of new mattresses to survivors of the hurricane.[590] Later that month, Beyoncé released a remix of J Balvin and Willy William's \"Mi Gente\", with all of her proceeds being donated to disaster relief charities in Puerto Rico, Mexico, the U.S. and the Caribbean after hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, and the Chiapas and Puebla earthquakes.[591] In April 2020, Beyoncé donated $6 million to the National Alliance in Mental Health, UCLA and local community-based organizations in order to provide mental health and personal wellness services to essential workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. BeyGOOD also teamed up with local organizations to help provide resources to communities of color, including food, water, cleaning supplies, medicines and face masks.[592] The same month Beyoncé released a remix of Megan Thee Stallion's \"Savage\", with all proceeds benefiting Bread of Life Houston's COVID-19 relief efforts, which includes providing over 14 tons of food and supplies to 500 families and 100 senior citizens in Houston weekly.[593] In May 2020, Beyoncé provided 1,000 free COVID-19 tests in Houston as part of her and her mother's #IDidMyPart initiative, which was established due to the disproportionate deaths in African-American communities. Additionally, 1,000 gloves, masks, hot meals, essential vitamins, grocery vouchers and household items were provided.[594] In July 2020, Beyoncé established the Black-Owned Small Business Impact Fund in partnership with the NAACP, which offers $10,000 grants to black-owned small businesses in need following the George Floyd protests.[595] All proceeds from Beyoncé's single \"Black Parade\" were donated to the fund.[596] In September 2020, Beyoncé announced that she had donated an additional $1 million to the fund.[597] As of December 31, 2020, the fund had given 715 grants to black-owned small businesses, amounting to $7.15 million donated.[598] In October 2020, Beyoncé released a statement that she has been working with the Feminist Coalition to assist supporters of the End SARS movement in Nigeria, including covering medical costs for injured protestors, covering legal fees for arrested protestors, and providing food, emergency shelter, transportation and telecommunication means to those in need.

                "content": "Beyoncé Giselle Knowles-Carter (bee-YON-say) (born September 4, 1981), known mononymously as Beyoncé, is an American singer, songwriter, record producer, actress, businesswoman, dancer and model. She is known as a lead singer of female R&B group Destiny's Child. She released her first solo album, Dangerously in Love, in 2003, when Destiny's Child was on a break. Since then, she has released six more albums, which have all produced hit singles. She has sold over 250 million records worldwide as a solo artist, and as the lead singer of the world's best-selling female group of all time, selling over 100 million records worldwide. She is the most awarded musicians in Grammys of all time, with 32 wins during her career, as well as her nominations.[6][7] Beyoncé Giselle Knowles was born at Park Plaza Hospital in Houston, Texas.[8] Her mother is Tina Knowles (née Beyincé; currently Lawson) and has Creole descent, which means she has some African and French roots. Her father is Mathew Knowles, who is African American. Knowles went to several performing arts schools, and took part in singing and dancing competitions as a child. Her younger sister, Solange, is also a musician. In her youth, she started the girl group Girls Tyme. Her father Mathew became her manager. Knowles became very famous in the late 1990s. She became the lead singer of the R&B girl group Destiny's Child. The group became the world's best-selling girl group of all time, selling over 85 million records worldwide. Destiny's Child took a break from recording music. Knowles released her solo debut album, Dangerously in Love, in 2003. Two singles from the album—\"Crazy in Love\" and \"Baby Boy\"—reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The album became one of the most successful albums of that year. Dangerously in Love was given five Grammy Awards. After Destiny's Child split, Knowles released her second album. B'Day was released in 2006, and its singles \"Déjà Vu\", \"Irreplaceable\" and \"Beautiful Liar\" reached the top ten in the United States. Her third album I Am... Sasha Fierce was released in 2008. \"If I Were a Boy\", \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\", \"Halo\" and \"Sweet Dreams\" became hit singles for Knowles. \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\" became another number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100. The album earned six Grammys in 2010, the most Grammys won by a woman in one night. Only Adele would do this again at the 2012 Grammys. Her next album, 4 (2011), became her fourth number one album on the Billboard 200 chart. She became the third artist in history to have her first four albums debut at number one. Beyoncé released her fifth album Beyoncé on iTunes on December 13, 2013. The public did not know about the album before it was released. The album has fourteen songs and 17 videos.[9] It has been given good reviews. It entered the Billboard 200 at number one. This made her the first female artist in the history of the chart to have her first five albums enter the chart at the top.[10] Knowles performed \"Drunk in Love\" with JAY-Z at the 2014 Grammy Awards. She was nominated for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration for \"Part II (On the Run)\" with JAY-Z.[11] In February 2016, Beyoncé was a guest performer at Super Bowl 50. She performed \"Formation\", the lead single from her sixth studio album, Lemonade. The performance was controversial, as it had elements of the #BlackLivesMatter movement along with influences from the Black Panthers.[12] She announced The Formation World Tour in a commercial after the Super Bowl performance. In April 2016, an hour-long film, Lemonade, was shown on HBO. After the film aired, the Lemonade album was released. The album became her best-reviewed of her career. It entered the charts at number one in the US and Canada. Lemonade features the singles \"Formation\", \"Sorry\", and \"Hold Up\". It won the Grammy Award for Best Urban Contemporary Album in 2017, while the music video for \"Formation\" won the award for Best Music Video. In 2017, Beyoncé released the promotional single \"Die with You\". She later contributed to the remix of \"Mi Gente\" by J Balvin and Willy William. This caused the song to jump to number three on the Billboard Hot 100. On December 1, 2017, an acoustic duet between Beyoncé and Ed Sheeran of Sheeran's song \"Perfect\" was released and was at the top of the iTunes charts in 32 countries.[13] The song became Beyoncé's sixth US number-one as a solo artist and her tenth number-one song in the US including songs with Destiny's Child. Knowles was featured on a remix of rapper Megan Thee Stallion's song \"Savage\"; it became Knowles’ seventh number-one song in the US.[14] On June 20, 2022, she released \"Break My Soul\", the lead single from her seventh studio album, Renaissance and the album was released on July 29, 2022. \"Break My Soul\" became her eighth solo US number-one (twelfth overall), while the album's next single, \"Cuff It\", reached number ten on the Hot 100.[15] Knowles has a three octave mezzo-soprano vocal range. Other sources state that she possesses a contralto vocal range at age of 30s. Jon Pareles of The New York Times commented that her voice is \"velvety yet tart, with an insistent flutter and reserves of soul belting\". Jody Rosen notes that the hip hop era highly influenced Knowles' unique rhythmic vocal style, but also finds her quite traditionalist in her use of balladry, gospel and falsetto. Her first role in a movie was for the musical Carmen: A Hip Hopera (2001). Her first major movie was Austin Powers in Goldmember (2002). The movie Dreamgirls (2006) was nominated for two Golden Globe Awards. Her other movies Cadillac Records (2008) and Obsessed (2009) did not do so well. In 2019, she starred as Nala in the 2019 drama-live action remake The Lion King. In 2005, Knowles and her mother created a fashion line called House of Deréon. In 2016, she also introduced a fitness-wear collection called Ivy Park.[16] In 2010, she released her first perfume which she called Heat. In 2013, Knowles became H&M's new swimwear model since she gave birth to her daughter Blue Ivy just a year prior. She became a spokesperson for L'Oréal, Pepsi, Tommy Hilfiger, Nintendo, and Vizio. In 2010, Knowles was ranked first on Forbes list of the \"100 Most Powerful and Influential Musicians in the World\",[17] and second on its list of the \"100 Most Powerful and Influential Celebrities in the World\".[18] In 2012, she was named \"World's Most Beautiful Woman\" by People magazine.[19] Many of Knowles' recordings and movies were given many nominations, with many winning them. These include 32 Grammy Awards, 24 [MTV Video Music Awards], three [American Music Awards], a Billboard Millennium Award, and a star on the [Hollywood Walk of Fame] with Destiny's Child. In 2009, [Billboard (magazine)|Billboard] named her the Top Radio Songs Artist of the 2000s decade. They also ranked her 4th for Artist of the Decade.[20][21] The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), named Knowles as the Top Certified Artist of the 2000s.[22][23] In the US, she has sold over 17 million copies as of May 2014. She has sold more than 30.4 million digital singles as of January 2012.[24] Worldwide, she has sold 245 million records. This makes her one of the best-selling music artists of all time.[25] Knowles appeared on [VH1]'s 2010 list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\".[26] They ranked her third on their \"100 Greatest Women in Music\" list in 2012. In 2000, Knowles met Jay-Z and proposed her on his 38th birthday on December 4, 2007. The couple married on April 4, 2008. On January 7, 2012, she gave birth to their first daughter, Blue Ivy Carter, via natural birth in Lennox Hill Hospital, New York. Knowles is a feminist. In the February 2013 issue of GQ magazine she said, \"You know, equality is a myth, and for some reason, everyone accepts the fact that women don’t make as much money as men do. I don’t understand that. Why do we have to take a backseat? I truly believe that women should be financially independent from their men. And let’s face it, money gives men the power to run the show. It gives men the power to define value. They define what’s sexy. And men define what’s feminine. It’s ridiculous.\"[27] Knowles joined the Ban Bossy campaign in 2014.[28] In December 2013, it was revealed that she and her husband Jay-Z were longtime vegans.[29] She wrote the foreword to the book The 22-Day Revolution by trainer Marco Borges, which was released in April 2015.[30] On February 1, 2017, Knowles announced via Instagram that she was expecting twins.[31] She gave birth to a daughter, Rumi and a son, Sir on June 13, 2017 via cesarean section.[32][33]",

                "content": "Our editors will review what you’ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article. Beyoncé and her husband, JAY-Z (Shawn Carter), have three children. Their eldest daughter was born in 2012 and is named Blue Ivy. Their twins, a boy and a girl, were born in 2017 and are named Sir and Rumi, respectively. Beyoncé achieved fame in the late 1990s as the lead singer of the R&B group Destiny’s Child and then launched a hugely successful solo career. Her hit solo albums included Dangerously in Love (2003), B’Day (2006), I Am…Sasha Fierce (2008), 4 (2011), Beyoncé (2013), and Lemonade (2016). By 2019 Beyoncé had won 23 Grammy Awards and was the most-nominated female artist in Grammy history, with 62 nominations. She first won the award as a member of the R&B group Destiny’s Child in 2000. Beyoncé (born September 4, 1981, Houston, Texas, U.S.) is an American singer-songwriter and actress who achieved fame in the late 1990s as the lead singer of the R&B group Destiny’s Child and then launched a hugely successful solo career. In 2023 she broke the record for most Grammy Awards won by an artist, with 32 Grammy wins over the course of her career. Beyoncé was born Beyoncé Giselle Knowles to Tina (née Beyoncé) and Mathew Knowles (divorced 2011). She has a younger sister, Solange, who also became a successful recording artist. At age nine Beyoncé formed the singing-rapping girl group Destiny’s Child (originally called Girl’s Tyme) in 1990 with childhood friends. In 1992 the group lost on the Star Search television talent show, and three years later it was dropped from a recording contract before an album had been released. In 1997 Destiny’s Child’s fortunes reversed with a Columbia recording contract and then an eponymous debut album that yielded the hit single “No, No, No Part 2.” Its follow-up album, The Writing’s on the Wall (1999), earned the group two Grammy Awards and sold more than eight million copies in the United States. Survivor (2001), the group’s third album, reached the number one spot on the Billboard 200 chart. By this time the group’s lineup, which had seen several personnel changes, was composed of Beyoncé, Kelly Rowland, and Michelle Williams. With her powerful voice and charisma, Beyoncé was clearly the leader of the group and wrote hit songs for Destiny’s Child, such as the saucy “Bootylicious.” Eventually, the group parted ways to pursue individual projects. Beyoncé used her songwriting talents to pen her first solo album, Dangerously in Love (2003). The album debuted to rave reviews, and, aided by the exuberant single “Crazy in Love,” which features rapper Jay-Z, it topped charts around the world. In 2004 Beyoncé won five Grammy Awards, including best contemporary R&B album and best female R&B vocal performance. Destiny’s Child reunited in 2004 to release Destiny Fulfilled. While generally not as acclaimed as the group’s previous efforts, the album sold more than seven million copies worldwide and spawned several hit singles. The trio embarked on a world tour in 2005, during which they announced that the group would officially disband. That same year they released #1’s, a collection of well-known songs and number one hits. In 2006 Beyoncé released her second solo studio album, B’Day, which features several coproducers, including the hit-making duo the Neptunes. Although much of the album carried echoes of 1970s-style funk, the pop ballad “Irreplaceable” became its most successful single. In 2008 she and Jay-Z married, and the union made them one of the top-earning couples in the entertainment industry. Later that year Beyoncé released the double album I Am…Sasha Fierce. Whereas the first half (I Am) captures an introspective mood, the second (Sasha Fierce) contains songs better suited to the dance floor. The album as a whole generated several hits, including the assertive “Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It),” and it contributed to Beyoncé’s dominance of the 2010 Grammy Awards. Her six awards, which included those for song of the year, best female pop vocal performance, and best contemporary R&B album, amounted to the most Grammys collected by a female artist in a single night. (The record was matched by pop singer Adele in 2012.) Days after a triumphant headlining performance at England’s Glastonbury Festival, Beyoncé released 4 (2011), a genre-bending mix of ballads and dance tracks that evokes influences ranging from Motown-era torch songs to the audio collages of rapper M.I.A. In early 2013 Destiny’s Child reunited for a halftime appearance at the Super Bowl and released a new song, “Nuclear.” Shortly thereafter Beyoncé collected a Grammy for her single “Love on Top.” She returned later in the year with the confidently sensuous and expressive Beyoncé, which boasts brand-name producers and appearances from, among others, the Nigerian author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie and the singer’s toddler daughter, Blue Ivy. The record, initially offered exclusively on iTunes, was promoted as a “visual album,” with music videos made to accompany each track. The single “Drunk in Love,” which features Jay-Z, was awarded several Grammys, including best R&B song. On the expansive and musically variegated Lemonade (2016), Beyoncé focused on themes of betrayal and perseverance. Conceived as another visual album, it debuted as an HBO television special. Lemonade attracted considerable acclaim, and it netted Beyoncé two Grammys, including a best music-video award for the anthemic “Formation.” In 2018 Beyoncé and Jay-Z released a collaborative album, Everything Is Love, credited to the Carters, and it took the Grammy for best urban contemporary album. That same year Beyoncé became the first Black woman to headline the Coachella Valley Festival in Indio, California. Her highly acclaimed performance, which featured marching bands from historically Black colleges, was the subject of Homecoming, a Netflix documentary and live album released in 2019. Although Beyoncé worked on a number of projects between studio albums, fans were left waiting for a new solo album. In 2022 she finally delivered with act i: RENAISSANCE. It received four Grammys, including best dance/electronic music album, and with those awards, Beyoncé surpassed classical music conductor Georg Solti for the most Grammy wins (32). Her world concert tour in 2023 broke the record, previously held by Madonna, for the highest grossing concert tour by a female artist. It also broke the record for the highest grossing tour of all time, until it was surpassed by Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour, which began in 2023. In February 2024 Beyoncé appeared in a commercial during the Super Bowl telecast to announce that she was releasing new music. Immediately after the game, she dropped two singles, “Texas Hold ’Em” and “16 Carriages,” on the music streaming service Tidal. Both songs feature a country music sound, leading her fans to guess that her new album, which she teased right after the Super Bowl on her Instagram page, would be a country album. The following month she revealed the album’s name, Cowboy Carter, confirming her fans’ guess. In the meantime, “Texas Hold ’Em” went to number one on the Billboard country chart, marking the first time in history that a Black woman had topped that chart. It was not her first foray into country music; in 2016 she performed her song “Daddy Lessons” with the Dixie Chicks (now known as the Chicks) at the Country Music Awards. In another Instagram post, Beyoncé revealed that the backlash she received after that performance spurred her to “dive into the history of Country music” as a future project. She also asserted, “This ain’t a Country album. This is a ‘Beyoncé album.’ ” The album’s release in late March prompted a long-overdue discourse about the African American roots of country music. Cowboy Carter’s impressive roster of guest artists includes singers Miley Cyrus and Linda Martell, folk musician Rhiannon Giddens, and singer-songwriters Dolly Parton and Willie Nelson. Parton’s classic song “Jolene” is reimagined with new lyrics by Beyoncé, and country singer Tanner Adell is among several vocalists who join in on a cover of the Beatles’ “Blackbird.” In 2001 Beyoncé made her acting debut in the television movie Carmen: A Hip Hopera, which aired on MTV. Her role as Foxxy Cleopatra in Austin Powers in Goldmember (2002) made her a film star and led to parts in The Fighting Temptations (2003) and The Pink Panther (2006). In 2006 she played Deena Jones in Dreamgirls, the film adaptation of the 1981 Broadway musical about a 1960s singing group. Beyoncé’s performance was nominated for a Golden Globe Award and her song “Listen” for an Academy Award. She later starred in Cadillac Records (2008), in which she portrayed singer Etta James, and the thriller Obsessed (2009) before providing the voice of a fairylike forest queen in the animated Epic (2013). For the 2019 remake of Disney’s The Lion King, Beyoncé voiced the character of Nala and performed several songs on the soundtrack, including “Spirit,” an original song she cowrote, and a rendition of “Can You Feel the Love Tonight.” She also concurrently released an album inspired by the movie, The Lion King: The Gift. Songs from that record were later featured in the visual album Black Is King (2020), which aired on the streaming service Disney+. For the single “Black Parade,” Beyoncé earned the Grammy for best R&B performance in 2021. That year she received three other awards to set the record for most Grammys (28) won by a female artist, surpassing bluegrass musician and singer Alison Krauss. Beyoncé later cowrote and performed “Be Alive” for the film King Richard (2021), and it received an Oscar nomination for best original song.",

            {
                "title": "Nosferatu (word) - Wikipedia",
                "content": "\"Nosferatu\" has been presented as an archaic Romanian word[1] synonymous with \"vampire\". It was largely popularized in the late 19th and early 20th centuries by Western fiction such as the gothic novel Dracula (1897) and the German expressionist film Nosferatu (1922). One of the suggested etymologies of the term is that it is derived from the Romanian Nesuferitu (\"the offensive one\" or \"the insufferable one\"). The etymology of the word nosferatu is undetermined. There is no doubt that it achieved currency through Bram Stoker's 1897 novel Dracula and its unauthorised first cinematic adaptation, Nosferatu (1922). Stoker identified his source for the term as 19th-century British author and speaker Emily Gerard. It is commonly thought that Gerard introduced the word into print in an 1885 magazine article, \"Transylvanian Superstitions\",[2] and in her travelogue The Land Beyond the Forest[3] (\"Transylvania\" is Latin for \"[the land] across/beyond the forest\"). She merely refers to \"Nosferatu\" as the Romanian word for vampire:[4] More decidedly evil, however, is the vampire, or nosferatu, in which every Romanian peasant believes as firmly as he does in heaven or hell. There are two sorts of vampires-—living and dead. The living vampire is in general the illegitimate offspring of two illegitimate persons, but even a flawless pedigree will not ensure anyone against the intrusion of a vampire into his family vault, since every person killed by a nosferatu becomes likewise a vampire after death, and will continue to suck the blood of other innocent people till the spirit has been exorcised, either by opening the grave of the person suspected and driving a stake through the corpse, or firing a pistol shot into the coffin. In very obstinate cases it is further recommended to cut off the head and replace it in the coffin with the mouth filled with garlic, or to extract the heart and burn it, strewing the ashes over the grave.[2] However, the word had already appeared in an 1865 German-language article by Wilhelm Schmidt.[5] Schmidt's article discusses Transylvanian customs and appeared in an Austro-Hungarian magazine, which Gerard could have encountered as a reviewer of German literature living in Austria-Hungary. Schmidt's article also mentions the legendary Scholomance by name, which parallels Gerard's \"Transylvanian Superstitions\".[2] Schmidt does not identify the language explicitly, but he puts the word nosferatu in a typeface which indicates it to be a language other than German. Schmidt's description is unambiguous in identifying nosferatu as a \"Vampyr\". At this point, I come to the vampire – nosferatu. It is this, the illegitimate offspring of two illegitimately begotten people or the unfortunate spirit of one killed by a vampire, who can appear in the form of dog, cat, toad, frog, louse, flea, bug, in any form, in short, and plays his evil tricks on newly engaged couples as incubus or succubus – zburatorul – by name, just like the Old Slavonic or Bohemian Blkodlak [sic], Vukodlak or Polish Mora and Russian Kikimora. That which was believed about this and used as a defense[6] more than 100 years ago is still true today, and there can hardly dare to be a village which would not be in a position to present a personal experience or at least hearsay with firm conviction of the veracity.[7] Schmidt expanded on his 1865 article in an 1866 monograph, adding the observation that the vampire was the \"uncanniest spawn of national-slavic fantasy\" and that his description was the Romanian perception.[8] However, nosferatu in that form does not appear to be a standard word in any known historical phase of Romanian (aside from that introduced by the novel and the films).[9] Internal evidence in Dracula suggests that Stoker believed the term meant \"not dead\" in Romanian, and thus he may have intended the word undead to be its calque.[10] Peter Haining identifies an earlier source for nosferatu as Roumanian Superstitions (1861) by Heinrich von Wlislocki.[11] However, Wlislocki seems only to have written in German, and according to the Magyar Néprajzi Lexikon, Wlislocki was born in 1856 (d. 1907), which makes his authorship of an English-titled 1861 source doubtful. Certain details of Haining's citation also conflict with David J. Skal,[9] so this citation seems unreliable. Skal identifies a similar reference to the word \"nosferat\" in an article by Wlislocki dating from 1896.[12] Since this postdates Gerard and has a number of parallels to Gerard's work, Skal considers it likely that Wlislocki is derivative from Gerard. There is also evidence to suggest that Haining derived his citation for Roumanian Superstitions from a confused reading of an extract in Ernest Jones's book, On the Nightmare (1931).[13] Wlislocki's later description of \"der Nosferat\" is more extensive than either Schmidt's or Gerard's. The former two German-language sources particularly emphasize the dual role of the creature as both blood-drinker and incubus/succubus. Wlislocki's nosferat is said to drink the blood of older people, while seeking to have sexual intercourse with young people and especially newlyweds, often being blamed for illegitimate children (who become moroi), impotence, and infertility. From the description by Wlislocki, who was a half-Saxon native of Kronstadt (Hungarian Brassó, Romanian Brașov, one of Saxon Transylvania's \"seven cities\"), it is difficult not to get the impression that both the term and the idea must have been quite well known in his community, which makes the inability to confirm its existence in Romanian literature rather puzzling. One proposed etymology of nosferatu is that the term originally came from the Greek nosophoros (Greek: νοσοφόρος), meaning \"disease-bearing\".[14] F. W. Murnau's film Nosferatu (1922) strongly emphasizes this theme of disease, and Murnau's creative direction in the film may have been influenced by this etymology (or vice versa).[15] There are several difficulties with this etymology. Schmidt, Gerard, and Wlislocki, all three sometime residents of Transylvania, identified the word as Romanian, and even proponents of the \"nosophoros\" etymology (as well as most other commentators) seem to have little doubt that this is correct; Wlislocki particularly was regarded as an expert in Transylvanian languages and folklore and was a prolific author on the subjects. Curiously, in Wlislocki's 1896 article, he presents a parenthetical analysis of the related Romanian term solomonar but has nothing to say regarding the origin and connections of the term nosferat, despite having normalized the spelling of both relative to Schmidt's earlier account. If this Romanian identification is taken to be correct, the first objection to the \"nosophoros\" etymology is that Romanian is a Romance language. While Romanian does have some words borrowed from Greek, as do most European languages, Greek is generally considered to be only a minor contributor to the Romanian vocabulary—absent any other information, any given Romanian word is much more likely to be of Latin origin than Greek. Second, the word appears to be quite rare in Greek. One instance of a Greek word similar to νοσοφόρος, νοσηφόρος (\"nosēphoros\"), is attested in fragments from a 2nd-century AD work by Marcellus Sidetes on medicine plus another of the Ionic dialect variant νουσοφόρος (\"nousophoros\") from the Palatine Anthology.[16] These two variant forms are subsumed as examples of the main νοσοφόρος lemma in the definitive Liddel-Scott Greek–English Lexicon, but examples of the normalized form itself seem to be lacking. In any event, supporting evidence for a relationship between this rare and obscure Greek term and nosferatu appears weak. In some versions of the \"nosophoros\" etymology, an intermediate form *nesufur-atu,[15] or sometimes *nosufur-atu is presented[14] but both the original source for this and the justification for it are unclear. This form is often indicated to be Slavonic or Slavic. It is likely that either Old Church Slavonic or the protolanguage Proto-Slavic is intended. As with νοσοφόρος, this supposed Slavonic word does not appear to be attested in primary sources, which severely undermines the credibility of the argument. Another common etymology suggests that the word meant \"not breathing\", which appears to be attempting to read a derivative of the Latin verb spirare (\"to breathe\") as a second morpheme in nosferatu, with the closest hypothetical Romanian word being *nuspirândul. Skal notes that this is \"without basis in lexicography\", viewing all these etymologies (including the widely repeated nosophoros etymology) with skepticism.[9] A final possibility is that the form given by Gerard and the German folklorists is a well-known Romanian term without the benefit of normalized spelling, or possibly a misinterpretation of the sounds of the word due to Gerard's limited familiarity with the language, or possibly a dialectal variant of the word. The standardization of Romanian was rather incomplete in the 19th century, as can be seen in Dictionariulu Limbei Romane of 1871, which in a highly Latinized orthography defines incubu (\"incubus\") as \"unu spiritu necuratu\" compared to the modern standard \"un spirit necurat\". Three candidate words that have been put forth are necurat (\"unclean\", usually associated with the occult, compare a avea un spirit necurat, to have an evil spirit, be possessed),[dubious – discuss][17][18] nesuferit[dubious – discuss],[9] and nefârtat (\"enemy\", lit. \"unbrothered\").[19] The nominative masculine definite form of a Romanian noun in the declension to which these words belong takes the ending \"-ul\" or even the shortened \"u\", as in Romanian \"l\" is usually lost in the process of speaking, so the definite forms nefârtatu, necuratu and nesuferitu are commonly encountered.",

                "content": "Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror (German: Nosferatu – Eine Symphonie des Grauens) is a 1922 silent German Expressionist vampire film directed by F. W. Murnau and starring Max Schreck as Count Orlok, a vampire who preys on the wife (Greta Schröder) of his estate agent (Gustav von Wangenheim) and brings the plague to their town. Nosferatu was produced by Prana Film and is an unauthorized and unofficial adaptation of Bram Stoker's 1897 novel Dracula. Various names and other details were changed from the novel, including Count Dracula being renamed Count Orlok then finally Nosferatu, an archaic Romanian word with a suggested etymology of Nesuferitu`, meaning \"the offensive one\" or \"the insufferable one\". Although those changes are often represented as a defense against copyright infringement,[3] the original German intertitles acknowledged Dracula as the source. Film historian David Kalat states in his commentary track that since the film was \"a low-budget film made by Germans for German audiences... setting it in Germany with German-named characters makes the story more tangible and immediate for German-speaking viewers\".[4] Even with several details altered, Stoker's heirs sued over the adaptation, and a court ruling ordered all copies of the film to be destroyed. However, several prints of Nosferatu survived,[1] and the film came to be regarded as an influential masterpiece of cinema and the horror genre.[5][6] Critic and historian Kim Newman declared it as a film that set the template for the genre of horror film.[7] In 1838, in the fictional German town of Wisborg,[1][8] Thomas Hutter is sent to Transylvania by his employer, estate agent Herr Knock, to visit a new client, Count Orlok, who is planning on buying a house across from Hutter's own residence. While embarking on his journey, Hutter stops at an inn in which the locals are frightened by the mere mention of Orlok's name. Hutter rides on a coach to Orlok's castle in the Carpathian Mountains, where he is welcomed by Orlok himself. When he is eating dinner and accidentally cuts his thumb, Orlok tries to suck the blood out, but his repulsed guest pulls his hand away. Hutter wakes up the morning after to find fresh punctures on his neck, which he attributes to mosquitoes. That night, Orlok signs the documents to purchase the house and notices on the table a miniature portrait of Hutter's wife, Ellen, an image that the young man carries with him in a small circular frame. Admiring the portrait, the count remarks that she has a \"lovely neck.\" Reading a book about vampires that he took from the inn, Hutter begins to suspect that Orlok is indeed a vampire. With no way to bar the door to his bedroom, Hutter desperately tries to hide as midnight approaches. Suddenly, the door begins to slowly open by itself; and, as Orlok enters, a terrified Hutter hides under the bedcovers and falls unconscious. Meanwhile, back in Wisborg, Ellen arises from her own bed and sleepwalks to the railing of her bedroom's balcony. She starts walking on top of the railing, which gets the attention of her friend Harding in the adjacent room. When the doctor arrives, Ellen shouts Hutter's name and envisions Orlok in his castle threatening her unconscious husband. The next day, Hutter explores the castle, only to retreat back into his room after he finds the coffin in which Orlok is resting dormant in the crypt. Hours later, Orlok piles up coffins on a coach and climbs into the last one before the coach departs; Hutter rushes home after learning of this. The coffins are taken aboard a schooner, where the sailors discover rats in the coffins. All of the crewmen later die, and Orlok takes control of the vessel. When the ship arrives in Wisborg, Orlok leaves unobserved, carries one of his coffins and moves into the house that he purchased. Many deaths in the town follow after Orlok's arrival, which the local doctors blame on an unspecified plague caused by the rats from the ship. Ellen reads the book that Hutter found; it claims that a vampire can be defeated if a pure-hearted woman distracts the vampire with her beauty and offers him her blood of her own free will; she decides to sacrifice herself. Ellen opens her window to invite Orlok in and pretends to fall ill so that she can send Hutter to fetch Professor Bulwer, a physician. After he leaves, Orlok enters and drinks her blood, but the sun rises, which causes Orlok to vanish in a puff of smoke. Ellen lives just long enough to be embraced by her grief-stricken husband. Orlok's castle is later shown destroyed. Nosferatu has been noted for its themes regarding fear of the Other, as well as for possible antisemitic undertones,[1] both of which may have been partially derived from the Bram Stoker novel Dracula, upon which the film was based.[9] The physical appearance of Count Orlok, with his hooked nose, long claw-like fingernails, and large bald head, has been compared to stereotypical caricatures of Jewish people from the time in which Nosferatu was produced.[10] His features have also been compared to those of a rat or a mouse, the former of which Jews were often equated with.[11][12] Orlok's interest in acquiring property in the German town of Wisborg, a shift in locale from the Stoker novel's London, has also been analyzed as preying on the fears and anxieties of the German public at the time.[13] Professor Tony Magistrale wrote that the film's depiction of an \"invasion of the German homeland by an outside force [...] poses disquieting parallels to the anti-Semitic atmosphere festering in Northern Europe in 1922.\"[13] When the foreign Orlok arrives in Wisborg by ship, he brings with him a swarm of rats which, in a deviation from the source novel, spread the plague throughout the town.[12][14] This plot element further associates Orlok with rodents and the idea of the \"Jew as disease-causing agent\".[10][12] It is also notable that Orlok's accomplice in conspiracy Knock is a Jewish realtor, who acts as the vampire's fifth column in the Biedermeier town of Wisborg.[15] There were other views – writer Kevin Jackson has noted that director F. W. Murnau \"was friendly with and protective of a number of Jewish men and women\" throughout his life, including Jewish actor Alexander Granach, who plays Knock in Nosferatu.[16] Additionally, Magistrale wrote that Murnau, being a homosexual, would have been \"presumably more sensitive to the persecution of a subgroup inside the larger German society\".[12] As such, it has been said that perceived associations between Orlok and antisemitic stereotypes are unlikely to have been conscious decisions on the part of Murnau.[12][16] Murnau and Grau gave Orlok in the film a demonic lineage and an occult origin: Orlok is the creation of Belial, one of the Satanic archdemons. Belial in Psalm 41:8–10 is also associated with pestilence, with Orlok in film being the very manifestation of contagion, rats pouring out of his coffins onto the streets of Wisborg, spreading Black Death.[17] Orlok's link to Belial is also highly significant because Belial is \"one of the demons traditionally summoned by Goetic magicians\" – making Orlok someone who practiced dark sorcery before becoming a vampire.[18] Orlok and his servant Knock are communicating in occult language – the documents between Orlok and Knock are written in the Enochian language, a constructed language said to be that of the angels, which was recorded in the private journals of English occultist John Dee and his colleague English alchemist Edward Kelley in late 16th-century Elizabethan England.[19][20] The character of Professor Bulwer in the film is named in reference to English occult novelist Edward Bulwer-Lytton.[20] The idea of astral entities, arising from the dark thoughts of human beings, responsible for epidemics that call for blood sacrifices in order to prevent them, is also closely linked to that of the alchemist Paracelsus, whose figure is partly embodied in the film in the character of Professor Bulwer (who is mentioned in the film to be Paracelsian himself). This is made concrete in the film in the plague epidemic that spreads through the city of Wisborg, which cannot be remedied by scientific methods, but by the blood sacrifice of a woman, thus destroying forever the dark being responsible for this catastrophic situation.[21] The idea for making this vampire film saw its genesis in the war-time experience of producer Albin Grau. Grau served in the German army during World War I on the Serbian front. While in Serbia Grau encountered a local farmer who told him of his father, who the farmer believed had become an undead vampire. F. W. Murnau, director of the film, also saw considerable action in World War I – not only as a company commander in the trenches of the Eastern Front, but also later in the air after he transferred to the German air service. He survived at least eight crashes. Max Schreck who portrayed Count Orlok also served in the trenches with the German army. Little is known of his war-time experience, but there are some signs he may have dealt with some form of post-traumatic stress disorder. Colleagues commented that he preferred to keep to himself. He was known to take long walks in the forest alone, often times disappearing for hours at a time. He once stated that he lived in \"a remote and incorporeal world\". Thus it is considered that the turmoil of 1920s Germany and the war-time experiences of those who produced the film left their marks on the production of the film.[22] As Lotte Eisner, a dedicated occultist, wrote: \"Mysticism and magic, the dark forces to which Germans have always been more than willing to commit themselves, had flourished in the face of death on the battlefields\" – these forces were intrinsic to the shaping of cinema's first vampires. Albin Grau himself also linked the war and vampires: \"this monstrous event that is unleashed across the earth like a cosmic vampire to drink the blood of millions and millions of men\". Belial as well is the link between war and contagion, as Orlok is linked directly to the Black Death and many critics have linked Nosferatu's disease-bearing rodents to the transmissible sickness associated with trench warfare in which rats flourished. As noted by Ernest Jones in his psychoanalytic study of nightmares, vampire legends proliferate in periods of mass contagion.[23] The studio behind Nosferatu, Prana Film, was a short-lived silent-era German film studio founded in 1921 by Enrico Dieckmann and occultist artist Albin Grau,[1] named after a Theosophical journal which was itself named for the Hindu concept of prana.[4] Although the studio's intent was to produce occult- and supernatural-themed films, Nosferatu was its only production,[24] as it declared bankruptcy shortly after the film's release. Grau claimed he was inspired to shoot a vampire film by a war experience: in Grau's apocryphal tale, during the winter of 1916, a Serbian farmer told him that his father was a vampire and one of the undead.[25] As a lifelong student of the occult and member of Fraternitas Saturni, under the magical name of Master Pacitius, Grau was able to imbue Nosferatu with hermetic and mystical undertones. One example in particular was the cryptic contract that Count Orlok and Knock exchanged, which was filled in Enochian, hermetic and alchemical symbols. Grau was also a strong influence on Orlok's verminous and emaciated look[26] and he also designed the film’s sets, costumes, make-up and the letter with the Enochian symbols. He also was responsible for film's advertising campaign, creating movie posters and advertisements. Grau’s visual style was also deeply influenced by work of the artist Hugo Steiner-Prag who had illustrated other texts with esoteric subjects such as Gustav Meyrink’s Golem and E. T. A. Hoffmann’s Die Elixiere des Teufels (1907).[27] Diekmann and Grau gave Henrik Galeen, a disciple of Hanns Heinz Ewers, the task to write a screenplay inspired by the Dracula novel, although Prana Film had not obtained the film rights. Galeen was an experienced specialist in dark romanticism; he had already worked on The Student of Prague (1913), and the screenplay for The Golem: How He Came into the World (1920). Galeen set the story in the fictional north German harbour town of Wisborg. He changed the characters' names and added the idea of the vampire bringing the plague to Wisborg via rats on the ship. Galeen's Expressionist style screenplay was poetically rhythmic, without being so dismembered as other books influenced by literary Expressionism, such as those by Carl Mayer. Lotte Eisner described Galeen's screenplay as \"voll Poesie, voll Rhythmus\" (\"full of poetry, full of rhythm\").[28] Actor Conrad Veidt was offered the role of Count Orlok, having previously worked with Murnau, but had to decline for scheduling reasons. In the search for an alternative the choice finally fell on the then-still-unknown actor Max Schreck.[29] Filming began in July 1921, with exterior shots in Wismar. A take from Marienkirche's tower over Wismar marketplace with the Wasserkunst Wismar [de] served as the establishing shot for the Wisborg scene. Other locations were the Wassertor [de], the Heiligen-Geist-Kirche yard and the harbour. In Lübeck, the abandoned Salzspeicher served as Nosferatu's new Wisborg house, the one of the churchyard of the Aegidienkirche served as Hutter's, and down the Depenau a procession of coffin bearers bore coffins of supposed plague victims. Many scenes of Lübeck appear in the hunt for Knock, who ordered Hutter in the Yard of Füchting to meet Count Orlok. Further exterior shots followed in Lauenburg, Rostock and on Sylt. The exteriors of the film set in Transylvania were actually shot on location in northern Slovakia, including the High Tatras, Vrátna dolina, Orava Castle, the Váh River, and Starý Castle [sk].[30] The team filmed interior shots at the JOFA studio in Berlin's Johannisthal locality and further exteriors in the Tegel Forest.[1] For cost reasons, cameraman Fritz Arno Wagner only had one camera available, and therefore there was only one original negative.[31] The director followed Galeen's screenplay carefully, following handwritten instructions on camera positioning, lighting, and related matters.[28] Nevertheless, Murnau completely rewrote 12 pages of the script, as Galeen's text was missing from the director's working script. This concerned the last scene of the film, in which Ellen sacrifices herself and the vampire dies in the first rays of the sun.[32][33] Murnau prepared carefully; there were sketches that were to correspond exactly to each filmed scene, and he used a metronome to control the pace of the acting.[34] The original score was composed by Hans Erdmann and performed by an orchestra at the film's Berlin premiere. However, most of the score has been lost, and what remains is only a partial adapted suite.[1] Thus, throughout the history of Nosferatu screenings, many composers and musicians have written or improvised their own soundtrack to accompany the film. For example, James Bernard, composer of the soundtracks of many Hammer horror films in the late 1950s and 1960s, wrote a score for a reissue.[1][35] Bernard's score was released in 1997 by Silva Screen Records. A version of Erdmann's original score reconstructed by musicologists and composers Gillian Anderson and James Kessler was released in 1995 by BMG Classics, with multiple missing sequences composed anew, in an attempt to match Erdmann's style. An earlier reconstruction by German composer Berndt Heller has many additions of unrelated classical works.[1] In 2022, the New York Times wrote about Dutch composer Jozef van Wissem's new score and record release for Nosferatu. Beginning with a solo played on the lute, his performance incorporates electric guitar and distorted recordings of extinct birds, graduating from subtlety to gothic horror. \"My soundtrack goes from silence to noise over the course of 90 minutes,\" he said, culminating in \"dense, slow death metal.\"[36] A new score for full orchestra and piano was commissioned by the Louisville Orchestra from its former composer-in-residence Sebastian Chang. It premiered, played live with the film in October 2023.[37] Shortly before the premiere, an advertisement campaign was placed in issue #21 of the magazine Bühne und Film, with a summary, scene and work photographs, production reports, and essays, including a treatment on vampirism by Albin Grau.[39] Nosferatu opened in the Netherlands on 16 February 1922 at the Hague Flora and Olympia cinemas.[40] Nosferatu premiered in Germany on 4 March 1922 in the Marmorsaal of the Berlin Zoological Garden. This was planned as a large society evening entitled Das Fest des Nosferatu (Festival of Nosferatu), and guests were asked to arrive dressed in Biedermeier costume. The German cinema premiere itself took place on 15 March 1922 at Berlin's Primus-Palast.[1] The 1930s sound version Die zwölfte Stunde – Eine Nacht des Grauens (The Twelfth Hour: A Night of Horror), which is less commonly known, was a completely unauthorized and re-edited version of the film. It was released in Vienna, Austria on 16 May 1930 with sound-on-disc accompaniment and a recomposition of Hans Erdmann's original score by Georg Fiebiger, a German production manager and composer of film music. It had an alternative ending lighter than the original and the characters were renamed again; Count Orlok's name was changed to Prince Wolkoff, Knock became Karsten, Hutter and Ellen became Kundberg and Margitta, and Annie was changed to Maria.[1] This version, of which Murnau was unaware, contained many scenes filmed by Murnau but not previously released. It also contained additional footage not filmed by Murnau but by a cameraman, Günther Krampf, under the direction of Waldemar Roger [de] (also known as Waldemar Ronger),[41] supposedly also a film editor and lab chemist.[citation needed] The name of director F. W. Murnau is no longer mentioned in the credits.[citation needed] This version, lasting approximately 80 minutes, was presented on 5 June 1981 at the Cinémathèque Française.[42] Nosferatu brought Murnau into the public eye, especially when his film Der brennende Acker (The Burning Soil) was released a few days later. The press reported extensively on Nosferatu and its premiere. With the laudatory votes, there was also occasional criticism that the technical perfection and clarity of the images did not fit the horror theme. The Filmkurier of 6 March 1922 said that the vampire appeared too corporeal and brightly lit to appear genuinely scary. Hans Wollenberg described the film in photo-Stage No. 11 of 11 March 1922 as a \"sensation\" and praised Murnau's nature shots as \"mood-creating elements.\"[43] In the Vossische Zeitung of 7 March 1922, Nosferatu was praised for its visual style.[44] Nosferatu was also the first film to show a vampire dying from exposure to sunlight. Previous vampire novels such as Dracula had shown them being uncomfortable with sunlight, but not undeath-threateningly so.[45] The film has received overwhelmingly positive reviews. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 97% based on 63 reviews, with an average rating of 9.05/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"One of the silent era's most influential masterpieces, Nosferatu's eerie, gothic feel – and a chilling performance from Max Schreck as the vampire – set the template for the horror films that followed.\"[46] In 1995, the Vatican included Nosferatu on a list of 45 important films that people should watch.[47] It was ranked twenty-first in Empire magazine's \"The 100 Best Films of World Cinema\" in 2010.[48] In 1997, critic Roger Ebert added Nosferatu to his list of The Great Movies, writing: Here is the story of Dracula before it was buried alive in clichés, jokes, TV skits, cartoons and more than 30 other films. The film is in awe of its material. It seems to really believe in vampires. ...Is Murnau's Nosferatu scary in the modern sense? Not for me. I admire it more for its artistry and ideas, its atmosphere and images, than for its ability to manipulate my emotions like a skillful modern horror film. It knows none of the later tricks of the trade, like sudden threats that pop in from the side of the screen. But Nosferatu remains effective: It doesn't scare us, but it haunts us.[49] Nosferatu only entered the public domain worldwide by the end of 2019. Despite this, the film had already been subject to widespread circulation via a sped-up, unrestored black and white bootleg copy.[50] Beginning in 1981, the film has had various different official restorations, several of which have been issued on home video in the U.S., Europe and Australia. These versions, which are all tinted, speed-corrected and have specially recorded scores, are separately copyrighted with respect to new copyrightable elements.[1] The most recent restoration, completed in 2005/2006, has been released on DVD and Blu-ray throughout the world, and features a reconstruction of Hans Erdmann's original score by Berndt Heller.[51] In 1977, Spanish amateur filmmaker José Ernesto Díaz Noriega added humorous and iconoclastic dialogues to the film. His adaptation or détournement, titled Manuscrito encontrato en Zarazwela or Nos fera tu la pugnete, was based on a S8 mm print of the English version. \"Observing the curious coincidence of the fiction that is related in the film with history\",[52] Díaz Noriega adapted Nosferatu's plot to the years of the Spanish transition to democracy: Prime Minister Arias Navarro becomes Draculas Navarro and Juan Carlos de Borbón becomes Jonathan Carolus (prince of Franconia). The original Transylvania becomes Galitzia and the Pazo de Meirás becomes the vampire's castle. All Murnau's characters find equivalence in the political actors of the Spanish transition to democracy.[53] A 1979 adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel Dracula by director Werner Herzog, Nosferatu the Vampyre, starred Klaus Kinski (as Count Dracula, not Count Orlok).[54] The film is a remake of the 1922 film with character names that are faithful to the novel. A remake by director David Lee Fisher was in development after being successfully funded on Kickstarter on 3 December 2014.[55] On 13 April 2016, it was reported that Doug Jones had been cast as Count Orlok in the film and that filming had begun. The film would use green screen to insert colorized backgrounds from the original film atop live-action, a process Fisher previously used for his remake The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (2005).[56][1] In November 2023, it premiered at the Emagine Theater in Novi.[57] It was later released on video on demand via Amazon Prime Video in September 2024 and on streaming though Apple TV+ on 18 October 2024.[58] In July 2015, a remake was announced with Robert Eggers writing and directing.[59] It was reported in September 2022 that Eggers' remake would be distributed by Focus Features, with Bill Skarsgård set to star as Orlok and Lily-Rose Depp as Ellen Hutter. Willem Dafoe, Nicholas Hoult, and Emma Corrin also appear.[60] The film wrapped principal photography on 19 May 2023.[61] The film's first teaser trailer was released on 24 June 2024, and later released on 25 December 2024.[62]",

                "content": "In 1887, a vampire wakes up and seeks to quench his thirst for blood. Brave men and women ally to destroy him  but to do so, they will have to thwart the plot of Renfeld, his faithful servant. Nosferatu is a card game mixing tactics, bluffing, and team play, with the vampire and Renfeld facing off against the vampire hunters. At the start of the game, everyone knows who Renfeld is, and Renfield knows which of the hunters is actually a vampire (as he chooses how to distribute the character cards), but the vampire's identity is hidden from everyone else. The hunters must identify the vampire and kill him with the ancestral stake before he can play five bite cards; if the hunters accidentally stake one of their own, then demoralized and weakened they lose the game. Components  Rules  8 Character Cards  49 Library Cards  11 Clock Cards  5 Ritual Cards  1 Ancestral Stake CardEach player other than Renfield starts with two cards from the library, which is comprised of rumors, components, bites and night cards. Three ritual cards  silver mirror, blood transfusion, and time distortion  are placed face-up on the table. Renfield takes the \"Eternal Darkness\" card, while one hunter holds the ancestral stake. Renfield creates a \"clock\" by taking one night card for each player and shuffling it with a dawn card. The game lasts a number of rounds, with the rounds continuing until one of the winning conditions is met. At the start of a round, players take turns doing the following: Drawing two cards from the library, discarding one card face-up, placing one card face-down in an action pile, then drawing a card from the clock. As soon as a player draws the dawn card or each player has played once, this part of the round ends. Renfield shuffles all the cards in the action pile, then reveals them. If the pile contains only components, the player holding the stake chooses one of the rituals, takes its action  forcing Renfield to reveal a character card, removing a bite from a hunter, or removing a night card from the clock  then turns the ritual face-down. Once all three rituals have been used, they're turned face-up and can be used again. If the deck contains bite cards, then Renfield applies the bites to the hunters, with a hunter losing one card in his stock for each bite; a hunter can have at most two bites. Night cards in the pile are added to the clock, thereby giving the vampire more time to work in future rounds, while making it tougher for players to achieve rituals. If the dawn card was revealed, the holder of the ancient stake can stab someone, thereby ending the game with victory for one side or the other, or pass the stake to another player. (If dawn didn't break, then the stake passes to another player with no opportunity for stabbing.) Once a hunter is bitten, Renfield flips the \"Eternal Darkness\" card to its \"Darkness Master\" side. If the library runs out and the \"Darkness Master\" side is face-up, you flip the card, shuffle the library, and start a new round. If, however, \"Eternal Darkness\" still shows (i.e., no one was bitten during this pass through the library), then the stake holder must reveal someone's character card, possibly unveiling the vampire for all to see. Better get chomping, Fangs, if you don't want to be exposed!",
