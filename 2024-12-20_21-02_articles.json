                "content": "Week 16’s iteration of “Thursday Night Football” was all Denver Broncos ... until it wasn’t. The Los Angeles Chargers came back from an 11-point deficit to take home the prime-time win, 34-27. To complete the comeback, they excelled in all phases of the game. Quarterback Justin Herbert threw for 284 yards, two touchdowns and an interception. Los Angeles’ offensive play-makers also combined for 117 rushing yards — including 28 from Herbert and two rushing touchdowns — both of which were from tailback Gus Edwards. Defensively, the Chargers were able to create chaos in their pass-rush, particularly in the second half, and kept Broncos quarterback Bo Nix out of rhythm. And on special teams, Los Angeles accomplished something no team had since 1976: scored three points on a fair-catch kick. It was the first time any team had attempted such a play since 2019, and kicker Cameron Dicker’s 57-yarder was the longest successful attempt in NFL history. NFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more. The Chargers now hold the head-to-head tiebreaker over the Broncos with their second win over Denver this season. The win also boosted Los Angeles’ playoff odds to 97%, according to NFL.com. For the Broncos, the loss slightly hurt their playoff chances. However, they still remain on the right side of the playoff bubble and have an 85% chance to make the postseason. DO YOU LIKE FOOTBALL? Then you'll enjoy getting our NFL newsletter delivered to your inbox Nick Niemann, a linebacker and member of Los Angeles' hands team, was able to hold onto the high-bouncing kick by his fingertips. The Chargers take over possession with 57 seconds left and will try to kneel out the clock. Will Lutz pulled his team back within one score on his second field goal of the night. The 55-yard kick was Lutz's longest made field goal of the year. With under one minute to play, he'll attempt an onside kick to keep the Broncos' winning hopes alive Just two plays after Gus Edwards' explosive, 43-yard play put the Chargers in Denver territory, Hassan Haskins broke away on a 34-yard catch-and-run off of a screen pass. The score gave Los Angeles its first two-score lead of the night. The Chargers, who once trailed by 11 points in the third quarter, now lead, 34-24. There are just under two minutes left to play as the Broncos drive. Edwards, who had already scored two touchdowns, had the Chargers' most explosive play of the night when he broke through multiple tackles for a long run. The play advanced Los Angeles from its own 26 to Denver's 31. Derius Davis, a second-year receiver, scored the first receiving touchdown of his NFL career on a 19-yard bullet pass from quarterback Justin Herbert. It was the second touchdown of Davis' career including a punt return score he had as a rookie. Joshua Palmer added some extra juice with a nice, one-handed snag in the back of the end zone for a two-point conversion. It's 27-24 Chargers with 12:23 left to play. It's a five-point game after veteran running back Gus Edwards hit pay dirt from five yards out and the Chargers failed their two-point conversion attempt. The Broncos still lead, 24-19, with under three minutes to go in the third quarter. Will Lutz attempted his first field goal of the night from 41 yards out and knocked it through for the three points, giving Denver another two-score lead. The Broncos hold a 24-13 with 8:31 left in the third quarter. Near the start of the second half, the Chargers announced that linebacker Denzel Perryman is questionable to return to action after sustaining a groin injury. Troy Dye is listed as the linebacker behind him on the depth chart. Chargers head coach Jim Harbaugh dug deep into the rule book for the final points of the first half. A 15-yard fair-catch interference penalty against the Broncos on a punt with no time left on the clock in the first half. The half can't end on a defensive penalty, so the Chargers had an opportunity for an untimed down with 0:00 on the clock. Harbaugh sent Cameron Dicker out to attempt a fair-catch kick. No Broncos players were allowed to rush and the play looked similar to a traditional kickoff, though from midfield and Dicker aiming for the uprights. Dicker's 57-yard attempt was good, and it was the first successful free kick in the NFL since 1976. It also was the longest fair-catch kick in NFL history. Ray Wersching was the last kicker to successfully make a fair-catch field goal, doing so for the Chargers against the Bills on Nov. 21, 1976. Between Wersching's free kick field goal and that of Dicker on Thursday night, NFL kickers were 0-9 on such attempts. It's all about the rookies for Denver tonight! Kris Abrams-Draine, filling in for the injured Riley Moss, was the latest first-year to make an impact against the Chargers. The cornerback read Justin Herbert's throw perfectly and secured the takeaway for the Broncos just in front of the goal line. It gave Denver the ball once again on its own 18 and less than a minute to play. Devaughn Vele, the seventh-round rookie out of Utah, caught a 6-yard pass from quarterback Bo Nix to give the Broncos a two-score lead. It was the final piece of a six-play drive in which Denver only attempted passing plays. It's 21-10 Broncos with 6:22 in the second quarter. Broncos defensive end Zach Allen brought down running back Gus Edwards behind the line of scrimmage on a third-and-inches play. Chargers head coach Jim Harbaugh opted to try the field goal on the ensuing fourth-and-3, and Cameron Dicker converted on his first field goal chance of the night. It's 14-10 Broncos with under nine minutes to play in the first half. Denver fullback Michael Burton ran a short out route to the flat, and quarterback Bo Nix made the easy toss for a 1-yard touchdown. It was the third score of the 10-year veteran's career and second in three weeks. The Broncos lead, 14-7, with just over 12 minutes to go until halftime. Both teams have one rushing touchdown through 15 minutes: Rookie Audric Estime has it for the Broncos, and veteran Gus Edwards was responsible for the Chargers'. Denver has the ball on the Los Angeles 33-yard line on first-and-10 to begin the second quarter. Los Angeles running back Gus Edwards drove his way through a pile and leaned forward for his third touchdown of the year. It also brought his team back even with Denver just one drive after the Broncos took an early lead. It's 7-7 with three minutes left in the first quarter. Chargers safety Marcus Maye, who was filling in for Elijah Molden, headed to the locker room to receive X-rays on his ankle. The team designated him as questionable for the remainder of the game. Los Angeles' safety depth will be tested further with Molden hurt, Maye now questionable and Alohi Gillman on IR. Audric Estime, the Broncos' rookie running back out of Notre Dame, followed his blockers on a 3-yard touchdown run. His first career score was the finishing touch on a 10-play, 72-yard drive by Denver to open the scoring. It's 7-0 Broncos halfway through the first quarter.

That season (2021), SoFi Stadium became the first NFL stadium to host a conference championship game and the Super Bowl in the same season. The Rams also were the second team to play a Super Bowl (following the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Super Bowl 55) in their home stadium. ➤ Ranking NFL's stadiums from 1 to 30: Where does SoFi Stadium rate?

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. The Broncos (9-6) failed to clinch their first playoff appearance since the 2015 season as the Los Angles Chargers (9-6) exploded in the second half, outscoring Denver 21-6 en route to a 34-27 victory on 'Thursday Night Football' and a season sweep of their AFC West rival. The result of the Chargers' victory is Los Angeles and Denver swap places in the conference standings with the Chargers now standing as the AFC's sixth seed and the Broncos tumbling down to the seventh and final postseason slot with two weeks remaining in the regular season for both franchises. Both teams entered Week 16 tied atop the NFL, along with the Philadelphia Eagles, for the league's best scoring defense, allowing 17.6 points per game, and while Los Angeles' defense didn't look a top scoring defense early, it certainly did late. The Broncos offense didn't have any issues moving the ball against the host Chargers' No. 1 scoring defense in the first two quarters, scoring touchdowns on each of their first three drives. The first concluded with a 3-yard rushing touchdown by fifth-round rookie running back Audric Estime; the next two were a 1-yard touchdown pass from first-round rookie quarterback Bo Nix to fullback Michael Burton, and another touchdown pass, a 6-yard strike, from Nix to seventh-round rookie wide receiver Devaughn Vele. However, their offense went completely cold after their first three drives. Five of the Broncos' final seven drives ended in punts with the other two being a 41-yard field goal to open the second half, and a 55-yard field goal on their final possession of the night. Nix finished the game with 248 yards passing and two touchdowns on 29 of 40 passing, but he threw for only 109 yards on 14 of 19 passing in the game's final two quarters. Justin Herbert and the Chargers offense fed off the momentum of concluding the half with a 57-yard field goal off the first fair-catch kick since 1976 from kicker Cameron Dicker after the Broncos committed a fair catch interference penalty on a punt with no time left on the clock that trimmed their halftime deficit to eight, 21-13. The Chargers scored three touchdowns on their four second-half possessions prior to recovering a last-ditch onside kick by the Broncos with just under a minute left to play. Running back Gus Edwards added his second rushing touchdown of the game from 5 yards out and finished the game with 68 rushing yards and two scores on 14 carries. Then, Herbert locked in, throwing two touchdown passes, including a miraculous 19-yarder to wide receiver Derius Davis in which the Chargers quarterback launched the football to the end while rolling to the left with a defender draped all over him. A shovel pass to running back Hassan Haskins for a 34-yard score with 2:27 left to play sealed the victory as Herbert finished with 284 yards passing, two touchdowns and an interception on 23 of 30 passing. Herbert heroics, and a defense that stepped up after a horrific start. Herbert finished this game 23 of 30 for 284 yards, with two touchdowns and an interception, but the stat line doesn't do his performance justice -- even when you account for his 40 rushing yards. He was firing lasers all over the field, and he repeatedly came up with huge plays at the most crucial moments. He was the best player on the field. And L.A.'s defense yielded just six points the rest of the game, after allowing the Broncos to begin the night with three consecutive touchdown drives. Their offense peaked too early, and their defense had no answers once the Chargers got going. As previously mentioned, the Broncos scored touchdowns on each of their first three drives. But beyond the 21 points they got, the ease with which they did it was astounding. They opened the game by going 72 yards on 10 plays, 70 yards on 12 plays and 70 yards on six plays. They didn't take a negative play until there were around four minutes remaining in the first half. It was SO easy for them ... until it wasn't. After those first three possessions, Denver ran just 35 more plays, and gained only 143 yards on those snaps. And after holding the Chargers to 10 points on their first five possessions, the defense yielded three touchdowns on four second-half drives before the final possession where the Chargers ran out the clock. Leading 21-10 late in the second quarter, the Broncos had the ball deep in their own territory. They'd been rolling offensively so with 41 seconds left they tried to put together a real drive rather than just running out the clock. But it went disastrously bad. A first-down pass to Javonte Williams went backward. Crucially, a second-down pass fell incomplete. And then a third-down run was stopped after just a yard, with 8 seconds left. The Chargers called timeout to force a punt. Why not, right? Something strange might happen. And then something strange happened. That's right, we got a fair-catch free kick for the first time since 1976. Aided, naturally, by a fair catch interference penalty, which moved the ball into Cameron Dicker's range. That sequence left the Chargers down by only one score at halftime, and started their run to eventually win the game. It's tough to choose between Herbert's ridiculous touchdown throws, but let's go with the one with a higher degree of difficulty. SHEESH. That is a frozen rope, on the move to his left, thrown back across his body, over the top of a defender and right on the money to the receiver, in stride, in the end zone. Hard to make a better throw than that. L.A. improves to 9-6 with this win and also moved ahead of the Broncos in the standings. The Chargers now hold the No. 6 seed in the AFC and hold the tiebreaker over Denver in the event the two teams finish with the same record. Their final two games of the season are at New England and at Las Vegas. Denver drops to 9-6 with the loss and falls behind the Chargers in the standings. Denver now holds the No. 7 seed in the AFC but remains fairly safe in the playoff race, with the Colts, Dolphins and Bengals all sitting at 6-8 and needing a lot of things to break their way (likely including Denver losing out) in order to make the field. The Broncos finish out the season with games at Cincinnati and home against the Chiefs. And that'll almost do it, folks. Chargers are gonna win this one and improve to 9-6, while the Broncos will drop to 9-6 themselves. Well, this is all gonna come down to an onside kick after that deep field goal by Wil Lutz. Those have been VERY unsuccessful this season. Let's see if the Broncos can be the exception to the rule. Justin Herbert, man. What a ridiculous game from this guy. This is his second truly spectacular touchdown of the night. The shovel pass under pressure to Hassan Haskins, who scoots his way through the defense to put the Chargers up two scores with a little more than two minutes remaining. Herbert has used his legs way more often this season, and to great effect. That was an enormous conversion on third-and-10 right there to keep his offense on the field, and then Gus Edwards followed it with his longest run of the season to get L.A. deep into Denver territory. Big swing. Also, the Broncos probably should've gone for it there, considering the situation. Sean Payton might regret punting it away. Great series for L.A.'s defense. Bud Dupree got it started with a sack on first down to put the Broncos behind the chains. A short run and a short pass later, and now the Chargers have a chance to run a bunch of clock in the four-minute drill to try to put this game away. After a big third-down conversion from Herbert to Hayden Hurst, the Broncos pass rush quickly ended the drive. First, Jonathon Cooper came off the edge to bat a pass down out of the air on second down. And then Drew Sanders got to Herbert in the pocket for a sack before he could slip away. Denver has a chance to tie or re-take the lead midway through the fourth. The Broncos since opening the game with three straight touchdowns: 27 plays, 87 yards, 1 FG, 4 punts. Nix missed an opportunity right there. Mims had about five steps on the corner and Nix underthrew the ball. Should've been a TD. What an outrageous throw from Herbert to give the Chargers their first lead of the game. Holy cow. Rolling to his left, back across his body, over the top of the defender and in a spot where only Derius Davis could catch it. Unreal throw. Well, we had a free kick earlier and now it looks like we have a simultaneous catch. Thursday Night Football! Gus Edwards it into the end zone again for L.A.'s second touchdown of the night. Immediately capitalizes on the late hit by Strnad. And suddenly it's a one-score game again. Two-point conversion fails, though, so it remains a five-point lead for Denver. Justin Strnad with a really silly play right there. It's not like that was a late slide. Herbert was on his way to the ground well before Strnad began his tackle attempt. After that conversion, Denver's series stalled out after Estime was dropped behind the line and then Nix threw the ball way out of the end zone. A short pass set up fourth-and-3, but Sean Payton opted for a field goal rather than trying to pick up a second conversion of the drive. Denver converted each of its first four third-down opportunities of the game, but missed its last three. Alas, the Broncos kept the line moving this time around with a screen pass to Courtland Sutton on fourth down and now have a chance to extend their lead. In case you're wondering... It's not every day that you see one of these. Because the half ended on a fair catch, and because there was a personal-foul penalty on the catch, the Chargers got the opportunity to kick a free field goal and Cameron Dicker nailed it to make this a one-score game at the half. Really, really poor clock management from the Broncos made that possible. Well there that goes! Kris Abrams-Draine just made a terrific play on a Herbert pass up the seam and came away with an interception. Just cut right in front of the receiver and snatched it out of the air. Only Herbert's third pick of the season. Justin Herbert (12-14 for 141 yards) has been just as effective as Bo Nix (14-19, 158 yards, 2 TD) on a per-dropback basis so far. The difference here is Gus Edwards has 18 yards on his 8 carries and the Broncos' backs are averaging over 5 yards per carry, so Denver's drives have sustained in a way L.A.'s haven't. That sack by Bosa was enough to get L.A. its first stop of the night. Nix's third-down pass for Vele was tapped up into the air. No defenders in the area or else it might've had a chance to get picked. Now Herbert can cut this to a one-score lead before the half and make it a very different game. With 4:13 left in the second quarter, the Broncos finally had their first negative play of the night. Joey Bosa dropped Bo Nix for a sack. The Chargers go three-and-out this time, and now Denver has a chance to make it a three-score game. Also, Gus Edwards is getting looked at by trainers. Wheels might be starting to come off for the Chargers here. Two pretty egregious missed calls in favor of the Broncos so far, with the personal foul on their opening drive and the missed illegal man downfield on that last touchdown. Stop me if you've heard this before: The Broncos easily marched right down the field and scored a touchdown. 6 plays, 70 yards, 2:28, zero negative plays, and Devaughn Vele with the score this time. It looked like we were on our way to a fourth consecutive touchdown drive, but the Broncos stuffed Gus Edwards behind the line of scrimmage on a third-and-1 opportunity and Jim Harbaugh decided to send the field goal team out there. The way this Broncos offense looks so far, that might be a pretty big mistake. The Chargers need all the points they can get if they want to keep pace. (And you shouldn't really be kicking on fourth-and-3 from the 19 in the first place.) Once again, Denver got whatever it wanted on a relatively easy touchdown drive. Bo Nix threw two incomplete passes but every other play gained positive yards. The touchdown came on a play-action bootleg concept with FB Michael Burton sneaking out into the flat. Extremely easy stuff. Significantly more effective second drive for the Chargers. They marched right down the field just as efficiently as Denver did on its first possession. Justin Herbert is now 4 of 4 for 43 yards, with the big plays on the drive being completions to Josh Palmer and Scott Matlock, plus a 19-yard run by Kimani Vidal before Gus Edwards punched it into the end zone from the 1-yard line. The Chargers are incredibly banged up in the secondary and could now be without yet another safety. The Amazon broadcast reported that Maye has an ankle injury and headed to the X-ray room. Quick, efficient work for the Broncos on that first possession. They gained positive yards on every snap. 10 plays, 72 yards, 5:56 off the clock and Estime's first career touchdown from 3 yards out. The Broncos have not been very good at running the ball this season (23rd in the NFL in yards per carry), but are finding plenty of success on the ground on their first drive. The Chargers have yielded 4.7 yards per carry to opponents, so this early success makes some sense. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

                "content": "With the game still in the balance, and the Broncos needing a stop, the Chargers stormed down the field on a six play, 2:01 drive that sealed the game for LA. Herbert's best throw of the day was his shortest one to Hassan Haskins who did the dirty work taking it 34 yards for the TD that put the nail in the Broncos' coffin. The Chargers are now tied with the Broncos at 9-6 but because they won both matchups against Denver, they hold the tie breaker. The Ravens are the other team in the hunt for the top Wild Card spot, but. it looks as if it's going to be those three teams that get into the post season as an AFC Wild Cards. Of course a lot depends on what happens in the game between the Steelers and Ravens on Saturday. Joshua Palmer made an insane catch in the back of the end zone for the two point conversion that put the Chargers up three. That's just the kind of second half it was for LA who seemed to have everything bouncing their way after the Fair Catch Kick call to end the first half. Herbert really turned it on in the second half as he used his feet to get out of the pocket and scramble when he needed to. This time he looked like he might get sacked but instead he throws a dime to Derius Davis in the end zone to give the Chargers their first lead of the night. The defense started rolling and that sparked the offense to start getting into the end zone. The first of the second half came on this Gus Edwards run just a play after a late hit on the QB flag gave LA a first down instead of a 4th and 5. LA took advantage of the flag by turning three points into seven with Edwards' second TD of the night. An incomplete pass and a Chargers timeout stopped the clock with 8 seconds left and forced the Broncos to punt. On the return, Denver was called for a kick catch interference flag as the clock expired, which meant the Chargers got a free 15 yards and put them in range to kick a Fair Catch Kick which looks more like a kick off then a field goal. But Cameron Dicker came on the field and kicked the 57 yarder on the first Fair Catch Kick in almost half a decade. The Chargers were driving down field late in the first half, trying to chip into the lead, but Justin Herbert made one of his only bad throws of the night when he got picked in the end zone by Kris Abrams-Davis as it looked like Denver was going into half with all the momentum. Denver would extend the lead after a 54 yard screen pass by Marvin Mims Jr. set up Nix's second TD pass of the day. That would be the last time the Broncos got into the end zone all night. The Chargers defense woke up and looked like the top ranked defense that they were earlier in the year. Nix ended the night with 263 yards and 2 TDs on 29/40 passing, but like the rushing game, most of that came in the first half. It looked like there was no stopping the Broncos early on as they continued to ground and pound which opened up the passing game for Bo Nix. Nix found his full back MIchael Burton with the one yard TD pass as Denver scored on their first two drives of the night. The Chargers would respond with a TD drive of their own as Justin Herbert set up this TD with a long pass Joshua Palmer that put LA at the 3 yard line. Gus Edwards would cap the drive with a feisty run to tie the game up, but the offense would go quiet after that. The Los Angeles Chargers took a step closer to the playoffs with a big win over their division rival on Thursday Night Football. A big second half from Justin Herbert led the Chargers over the Broncos in the 34-27 win from Sofi Stadium. It wasn't the prettiest of starts for the Chargers who went three and out on their first drive of the game and then let the Broncos march down the field to put the opening TD on the board. The Broncos has 110 yards rushing, but most of those came in the first half. IT'S ALL OVER!!! The Chargers comeback on the Broncos and draw level with them in the Wild Card race! The Broncos got the hop they needed on the onside kick but Neimann the linebacker made a great catch and that's going to do it! Lutz drills the 55 yard kick as Denver elected to go for a quick score and rely on the onside kick. It's 34-27 Chargers with 57 to go. Short pass to the right side for Williams and he runs out of bounds after an 11 yard gain. 1st and 10 from the LA 37. Quick pass to Krull for a gain of 4 yards and a first down. 1st adn 10 from the LA 48. Nix finds Krull on the right side for a gain of 10 yards. 4th and 3 from the DEN 48. Nix's short pass to Williams skips off the turf and that brings up3rd and long. 3rd and 13 from the DEN 38. WE ARE AT THE TWO MINUTE WARNING FROM LA! Nix tucked it and ran it before lateraling the ball to Williams for a big gain but a holding call is going to bring that play back. 2nd and 13 from the DEN 38. Nix to the right side for Franklin who makes the 7 yard catch. 2nd and 3 from the DEN 48. Nix to the right side for Sutton and he reels it in for 11 yards. 1st and 10 from the DEN 41.

Herbert and the Chargres looked like they might put some points on the board before the half but his pass to the end zone was picked by Kris Abrams-Draine. The Chargers would get a chance to put points on the board in one of the strangest plays you probably haven't seen before in your life before tonight. After Marvin Mims took a WR screen 55 yards down the left sideline, the Broncos would be set up Nix with a chance to find Devaughn Vele this TD pass as Denver started the game scoring TDs on their first three drives. Nix and the Broncos would ease back down the field again and score another TD on their second drive. This time the Broncos opened up the passing game a bit and it was the fullback Michael Burton who made the short catch for a TD.

These two teams are in playoff position because of their defenses. Unfortunately the Chargers defense has been getting exposed over the last few weeks as they play tougher and tougher opponents as the weeks go on. The Broncos are trending in the right direction and I think they are the better team. They are more complete. They have more ways to hurt you and they have gotten better since they lost to the Chargers earlier in the year, where LA has gotten worse. I think the Broncos win in a low scoring, defense struggle. AFC Standings heading into Week 16 Taking a look at the AFC standings, we see the Kansas City Chiefs at the top of the conference with a record of 13-1. They have clinched the AFC West for the ninth straight year. That means that these two teams playing tonight will have to settle for a Wild Card spot. The Broncos and the Ravens are currently tied at 9-5 but the Broncos lost to the Ravens earlier this season so Baltimore would get the top Wild Card spot if the season ended today. The Chargers currently have the third and final Wild Card spot, and are trying to fend off the 6-8 Dolphins, 6-8 Bengals and the 6-8 Colts. The Broncos are in the playoffs with a win today, while the Chargers can get into the playoffs with a win and a some help this weekend. If they win and the Dolphins and Colts lose, they are in. For the Chargers portion of the star watch, we highlight a star that hasn’t really been playing like a star this season. Herbert teamed up with new coach Jim Harbaugh who is know as a QB coaching savant. While his numbers haven’t been great, he also hasn’t made a whole lot of mistakes. He has 16 TDs and just 2 INTs while throwing for 2,959 yards. Modest, but clean numbers for a QB who saw a lot of his top weapons depart in the offseason. The other thing that Herbert has done this season is stay pretty healthy. In previous seasons he has battled injury after injury and despite playing and fighting through pain that has affected his play and his numbers. Last year he played just 13 games and passed for under 4,000 yards for the first time in his career. That looks like it will happen again this year, but if the Charger can make the playoffs, we know that he can turn it on at any point and with a defense like LA’s that could be trouble for teams in the postseason. Jim Harbaugh’s first year in LA has had it’s peaks and valleys but one thing has remained a constant for most of the year. The Chargers defense. They didn’t give up more than 20 points in their first 10 games of the season and in that time they went 7-3. Aside from their win over the Chargers, they really hadn’t beat a good, over .500 team. They have had a tough stretch of games over the last month, and have gone 1-3 in their last four games beating the Falcons but losing against the Ravens, Chiefs and then the Bucs last week. They are in great position to get a playoff spot, but the way they are playing should concern Jim Harbaugh and the Chargers fans. After a disastrous season last year, the Broncos and Sean Payton got rid of Russell Wilson and drafted rookie QB Bo Nix to be their face of the future. Expectations were realistic, and no one really though this team would be in this position already. Denver lost their first two games as Bo Nix looked like a rookie QB who wasn’t quite ready for the speed of the game. They would win five of their next six games, only losing to this Chargers team during that stretch and Nix looked like he was starting to find his groove. A couple of tough games against the Chiefs and Ravens gave them a bit of a reality dose but they would bounce back and win their next four games against the Falcons, Raiders, Browns and Colts to find themself in the drivers seat for a playoff spot in the AFC. The Chargers locked horns with another team in the chase for the playoffs, but only one team showed up and played like a playoff team. It wasn’t the Chargers. LA actually led in the first half, after the defense picked off Baker Mayfield and Justin Herbert connected with Quinton Johnston on the second of his two TD passes, but the LA offense would shut down after that. Baker and the Bucs switch on in the second half and scored 27 unanswered points to win 40-17. Herbert ended the game 21/33 with 195 yards and 2 TDs with 1 INT, but it wasn’t enough for the Chargers who are still waiting for their offense to turn on before they face a do or die situation in the playoffs, or before that. The defense is the star of the show for the Broncos, but in this part of the preview we would be remiss if we did highlight Bo Nix in the star watch section. Nix put himself in contention and is a real candidate for the rookie of the year after a fantastic stretch in which he had stretch of games in which he threw 16 TDs and just two INTs. It was a rough start to the season, as the rookie threw zero TDs and four picks in the first two weeks of the season, but Sean Payton took the first year QB under wing and has turned him into a fantastic quarterback that is leading his team to the playoffs in his first year. Nix has 2,972 yards, 20 TDs and 11 INTs, and while his passing stats are impressive it’s his legs that many teams don’t account for. He has 327 yards rushing and 4 TDs and has shown he can change the game by scrambling and stretching a defense out. He may or may not win ROTY, but he will be more than happy getting his team to the playoffs in his first year. The Broncos came off of their Week 14 BYE and looked a little sluggish in the first half of their game against the Colts. They went down 10-0 early in the second quarter and rookie Bo Nix was far from perfect, throwing three interceptions, but like they have done so often this year, the Denver defense bailed them out. They turned the Colts over five times, and none of those turnovers were bigger than the pick six that Nick Bonitto took to the house on a disastrous trick play for Indianapolis. Denver scored 21 points in the fourth quarter and won the game 31-13 to improve to 9-5. Hello everyone and welcome to Los Angeles where the Chargers are in good position to get a Wild Card but they can be in much better shape with a win tonight. While they might be in playoff position they have hit a bit of a rut, losing three of their last four games and their one time top rated defense is no longer looking as dominant as it did a month and a half ago. The Broncos on the other hand have bounced back from a two game losing skid to the Chiefs and the Ravens with a four game losing streak including a big win over the Colts last week. These two teams will most likely be in the post season no matter the outcome of this game, but Broncos and Chargers will be hoping to get the best possible Wild Card seed, and that starts with tonight’s big divisional match up. A couple AFC West currently occupying two of the three Wild Card spots in the conference go toe-to-toe tonight and the winner will most likely be guaranteed a place in the postseason. It’s the Denver Broncos taking on the Los Angeles Chargers in a Thrusday night divisional match up with massive implications and AS English will be with you all night providing live coverage, stats, highlights and analysis of tonight’s game from Sofi Stadium.",

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. The Broncos (9-6) failed to clinch their first playoff appearance since the 2015 season as the Los Angles Chargers (9-6) exploded in the second half, outscoring Denver 21-6 en route to a 34-27 victory on 'Thursday Night Football' and a season sweep of their AFC West rival. The result of the Chargers' victory is Los Angeles and Denver swap places in the conference standings with the Chargers now standing as the AFC's sixth seed and the Broncos tumbling down to the seventh and final postseason slot with two weeks remaining in the regular season for both franchises. Both teams entered Week 16 tied atop the NFL, along with the Philadelphia Eagles, for the league's best scoring defense, allowing 17.6 points per game, and while Los Angeles' defense didn't look a top scoring defense early, it certainly did late. The Broncos offense didn't have any issues moving the ball against the host Chargers' No. 1 scoring defense in the first two quarters, scoring touchdowns on each of their first three drives. The first concluded with a 3-yard rushing touchdown by fifth-round rookie running back Audric Estime; the next two were a 1-yard touchdown pass from first-round rookie quarterback Bo Nix to fullback Michael Burton, and another touchdown pass, a 6-yard strike, from Nix to seventh-round rookie wide receiver Devaughn Vele. However, their offense went completely cold after their first three drives. Five of the Broncos' final seven drives ended in punts with the other two being a 41-yard field goal to open the second half, and a 55-yard field goal on their final possession of the night. Nix finished the game with 248 yards passing and two touchdowns on 29 of 40 passing, but he threw for only 109 yards on 14 of 19 passing in the game's final two quarters. Justin Herbert and the Chargers offense fed off the momentum of concluding the half with a 57-yard field goal off the first fair-catch kick since 1976 from kicker Cameron Dicker after the Broncos committed a fair catch interference penalty on a punt with no time left on the clock that trimmed their halftime deficit to eight, 21-13. The Chargers scored three touchdowns on their four second-half possessions prior to recovering a last-ditch onside kick by the Broncos with just under a minute left to play. Running back Gus Edwards added his second rushing touchdown of the game from 5 yards out and finished the game with 68 rushing yards and two scores on 14 carries. Then, Herbert locked in, throwing two touchdown passes, including a miraculous 19-yarder to wide receiver Derius Davis in which the Chargers quarterback launched the football to the end while rolling to the left with a defender draped all over him. A shovel pass to running back Hassan Haskins for a 34-yard score with 2:27 left to play sealed the victory as Herbert finished with 284 yards passing, two touchdowns and an interception on 23 of 30 passing. Herbert heroics, and a defense that stepped up after a horrific start. Herbert finished this game 23 of 30 for 284 yards, with two touchdowns and an interception, but the stat line doesn't do his performance justice -- even when you account for his 40 rushing yards. He was firing lasers all over the field, and he repeatedly came up with huge plays at the most crucial moments. He was the best player on the field. And L.A.'s defense yielded just six points the rest of the game, after allowing the Broncos to begin the night with three consecutive touchdown drives. Their offense peaked too early, and their defense had no answers once the Chargers got going. As previously mentioned, the Broncos scored touchdowns on each of their first three drives. But beyond the 21 points they got, the ease with which they did it was astounding. They opened the game by going 72 yards on 10 plays, 70 yards on 12 plays and 70 yards on six plays. They didn't take a negative play until there were around four minutes remaining in the first half. It was SO easy for them ... until it wasn't. After those first three possessions, Denver ran just 35 more plays, and gained only 143 yards on those snaps. And after holding the Chargers to 10 points on their first five possessions, the defense yielded three touchdowns on four second-half drives before the final possession where the Chargers ran out the clock. Leading 21-10 late in the second quarter, the Broncos had the ball deep in their own territory. They'd been rolling offensively so with 41 seconds left they tried to put together a real drive rather than just running out the clock. But it went disastrously bad. A first-down pass to Javonte Williams went backward. Crucially, a second-down pass fell incomplete. And then a third-down run was stopped after just a yard, with 8 seconds left. The Chargers called timeout to force a punt. Why not, right? Something strange might happen. And then something strange happened. That's right, we got a fair-catch free kick for the first time since 1976. Aided, naturally, by a fair catch interference penalty, which moved the ball into Cameron Dicker's range. That sequence left the Chargers down by only one score at halftime, and started their run to eventually win the game. It's tough to choose between Herbert's ridiculous touchdown throws, but let's go with the one with a higher degree of difficulty. SHEESH. That is a frozen rope, on the move to his left, thrown back across his body, over the top of a defender and right on the money to the receiver, in stride, in the end zone. Hard to make a better throw than that. L.A. improves to 9-6 with this win and also moved ahead of the Broncos in the standings. The Chargers now hold the No. 6 seed in the AFC and hold the tiebreaker over Denver in the event the two teams finish with the same record. Their final two games of the season are at New England and at Las Vegas. Denver drops to 9-6 with the loss and falls behind the Chargers in the standings. Denver now holds the No. 7 seed in the AFC but remains fairly safe in the playoff race, with the Colts, Dolphins and Bengals all sitting at 6-8 and needing a lot of things to break their way (likely including Denver losing out) in order to make the field. The Broncos finish out the season with games at Cincinnati and home against the Chiefs. And that'll almost do it, folks. Chargers are gonna win this one and improve to 9-6, while the Broncos will drop to 9-6 themselves. Well, this is all gonna come down to an onside kick after that deep field goal by Wil Lutz. Those have been VERY unsuccessful this season. Let's see if the Broncos can be the exception to the rule. Justin Herbert, man. What a ridiculous game from this guy. This is his second truly spectacular touchdown of the night. The shovel pass under pressure to Hassan Haskins, who scoots his way through the defense to put the Chargers up two scores with a little more than two minutes remaining. Herbert has used his legs way more often this season, and to great effect. That was an enormous conversion on third-and-10 right there to keep his offense on the field, and then Gus Edwards followed it with his longest run of the season to get L.A. deep into Denver territory. Big swing. Also, the Broncos probably should've gone for it there, considering the situation. Sean Payton might regret punting it away. Great series for L.A.'s defense. Bud Dupree got it started with a sack on first down to put the Broncos behind the chains. A short run and a short pass later, and now the Chargers have a chance to run a bunch of clock in the four-minute drill to try to put this game away. After a big third-down conversion from Herbert to Hayden Hurst, the Broncos pass rush quickly ended the drive. First, Jonathon Cooper came off the edge to bat a pass down out of the air on second down. And then Drew Sanders got to Herbert in the pocket for a sack before he could slip away. Denver has a chance to tie or re-take the lead midway through the fourth. The Broncos since opening the game with three straight touchdowns: 27 plays, 87 yards, 1 FG, 4 punts. Nix missed an opportunity right there. Mims had about five steps on the corner and Nix underthrew the ball. Should've been a TD. What an outrageous throw from Herbert to give the Chargers their first lead of the game. Holy cow. Rolling to his left, back across his body, over the top of the defender and in a spot where only Derius Davis could catch it. Unreal throw. Well, we had a free kick earlier and now it looks like we have a simultaneous catch. Thursday Night Football! Gus Edwards it into the end zone again for L.A.'s second touchdown of the night. Immediately capitalizes on the late hit by Strnad. And suddenly it's a one-score game again. Two-point conversion fails, though, so it remains a five-point lead for Denver. Justin Strnad with a really silly play right there. It's not like that was a late slide. Herbert was on his way to the ground well before Strnad began his tackle attempt. After that conversion, Denver's series stalled out after Estime was dropped behind the line and then Nix threw the ball way out of the end zone. A short pass set up fourth-and-3, but Sean Payton opted for a field goal rather than trying to pick up a second conversion of the drive. Denver converted each of its first four third-down opportunities of the game, but missed its last three. Alas, the Broncos kept the line moving this time around with a screen pass to Courtland Sutton on fourth down and now have a chance to extend their lead. In case you're wondering... It's not every day that you see one of these. Because the half ended on a fair catch, and because there was a personal-foul penalty on the catch, the Chargers got the opportunity to kick a free field goal and Cameron Dicker nailed it to make this a one-score game at the half. Really, really poor clock management from the Broncos made that possible. Well there that goes! Kris Abrams-Draine just made a terrific play on a Herbert pass up the seam and came away with an interception. Just cut right in front of the receiver and snatched it out of the air. Only Herbert's third pick of the season. Justin Herbert (12-14 for 141 yards) has been just as effective as Bo Nix (14-19, 158 yards, 2 TD) on a per-dropback basis so far. The difference here is Gus Edwards has 18 yards on his 8 carries and the Broncos' backs are averaging over 5 yards per carry, so Denver's drives have sustained in a way L.A.'s haven't. That sack by Bosa was enough to get L.A. its first stop of the night. Nix's third-down pass for Vele was tapped up into the air. No defenders in the area or else it might've had a chance to get picked. Now Herbert can cut this to a one-score lead before the half and make it a very different game. With 4:13 left in the second quarter, the Broncos finally had their first negative play of the night. Joey Bosa dropped Bo Nix for a sack. The Chargers go three-and-out this time, and now Denver has a chance to make it a three-score game. Also, Gus Edwards is getting looked at by trainers. Wheels might be starting to come off for the Chargers here. Two pretty egregious missed calls in favor of the Broncos so far, with the personal foul on their opening drive and the missed illegal man downfield on that last touchdown. Stop me if you've heard this before: The Broncos easily marched right down the field and scored a touchdown. 6 plays, 70 yards, 2:28, zero negative plays, and Devaughn Vele with the score this time. It looked like we were on our way to a fourth consecutive touchdown drive, but the Broncos stuffed Gus Edwards behind the line of scrimmage on a third-and-1 opportunity and Jim Harbaugh decided to send the field goal team out there. The way this Broncos offense looks so far, that might be a pretty big mistake. The Chargers need all the points they can get if they want to keep pace. (And you shouldn't really be kicking on fourth-and-3 from the 19 in the first place.) Once again, Denver got whatever it wanted on a relatively easy touchdown drive. Bo Nix threw two incomplete passes but every other play gained positive yards. The touchdown came on a play-action bootleg concept with FB Michael Burton sneaking out into the flat. Extremely easy stuff. Significantly more effective second drive for the Chargers. They marched right down the field just as efficiently as Denver did on its first possession. Justin Herbert is now 4 of 4 for 43 yards, with the big plays on the drive being completions to Josh Palmer and Scott Matlock, plus a 19-yard run by Kimani Vidal before Gus Edwards punched it into the end zone from the 1-yard line. The Chargers are incredibly banged up in the secondary and could now be without yet another safety. The Amazon broadcast reported that Maye has an ankle injury and headed to the X-ray room. Quick, efficient work for the Broncos on that first possession. They gained positive yards on every snap. 10 plays, 72 yards, 5:56 off the clock and Estime's first career touchdown from 3 yards out. The Broncos have not been very good at running the ball this season (23rd in the NFL in yards per carry), but are finding plenty of success on the ground on their first drive. The Chargers have yielded 4.7 yards per carry to opponents, so this early success makes some sense. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

                "content": "Superman is a superhero who appears in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character was created by writer Jerry Siegel and artist Joe Shuster, and debuted in the comic book Action Comics #1 (cover-dated June 1938 and published April 18, 1938).[1] Superman has been adapted to several other media including radio serials, novels, films, television shows, theater, and video games. Superman was born Kal-El, on the fictional planet Krypton. As a baby, his parents Jor-El and Lara sent him to Earth in a small spaceship shortly before Krypton was destroyed in a natural cataclysm. His ship landed in the American countryside near the fictional town of Smallville, Kansas. He was found and adopted by farmers Jonathan and Martha Kent, who named him Clark Kent. Clark began developing superhuman abilities, such as incredible strength and impervious skin. His adoptive parents advised him to use his powers to benefit humanity, and he decided to fight crime as a vigilante. To protect his personal life, he changes into a colorful costume and uses the alias \"Superman\" when fighting crime. Clark resides in the fictional American city of Metropolis, where he works as a journalist for the Daily Planet. Superman's supporting characters include his love interest and fellow journalist Lois Lane, Daily Planet photographer Jimmy Olsen, and editor-in-chief Perry White, and his enemies include Brainiac, General Zod, and archenemy Lex Luthor. Superman is the archetypal superhero: he wears an outlandish costume, uses a codename, is unfailingly good and honest, and fights evil with the aid of extraordinary abilities. Although there are earlier characters who arguably fit this definition, Superman popularized the superhero genre and established its conventions. He was the best-selling superhero in American comic books up until the 1980s.[2] Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster met in 1932 while attending Glenville High School in Cleveland and bonded over their admiration of fiction. Siegel aspired to become a writer and Shuster aspired to become an illustrator. Siegel wrote amateur science fiction stories, which he self-published as a magazine called Science Fiction: The Advance Guard of Future Civilization. His friend Shuster often provided illustrations for his work.[3] In January 1933, Siegel published a short story in his magazine titled \"The Reign of the Superman\". The titular character is a homeless man named Bill Dunn who is tricked by an evil scientist into consuming an experimental drug. The drug gives Dunn the powers of mind-reading, mind-control, and clairvoyance. He uses these powers maliciously for profit and amusement, but then the drug wears off, leaving him a powerless vagrant again. Shuster provided illustrations, depicting Dunn as a bald man.[4] Siegel and Shuster shifted to making comic strips, with a focus on adventure and comedy. They wanted to become syndicated newspaper strip authors, so they showed their ideas to various newspaper editors. However, the newspaper editors were not impressed, and told them that if they wanted to make a successful comic strip, it had to be something more sensational than anything else on the market. This prompted Siegel to revisit Superman as a comic strip character.[5][6] Siegel modified Superman's powers to make him even more sensational. Like Bill Dunn, the second prototype of Superman is given powers against his will by an unscrupulous scientist, but instead of psychic abilities, he acquires superhuman strength and bullet-proof skin.[7][8] Additionally, this new Superman was a crime-fighting hero instead of a villain, because Siegel noted that comic strips with heroic protagonists tended to be more successful.[9] In later years, Siegel once recalled that this Superman wore a \"bat-like\" cape in some panels, but typically he and Shuster agreed there was no costume yet, and there is none apparent in the surviving artwork.[10][11] Siegel and Shuster showed this second concept of Superman to Consolidated Book Publishers, based in Chicago.[12][a] In May 1933, Consolidated had published a proto-comic book titled Detective Dan: Secret Operative 48.[13] It contained all-original stories as opposed to reprints of newspaper strips, which was a novelty at the time.[14] Siegel and Shuster put together a comic book in a similar format called The Superman. A delegation from Consolidated visited Cleveland that summer on a business trip and Siegel and Shuster took the opportunity to present their work in person.[15][16] Although Consolidated expressed interest, they later pulled out of the comics business without ever offering a book deal because the sales of Detective Dan were disappointing.[17][18] Siegel believed publishers kept rejecting them because he and Shuster were young and unknown, so he looked for an established artist to replace Shuster.[19] When Siegel told Shuster what he was doing, Shuster reacted by burning their rejected Superman comic, sparing only the cover. They continued collaborating on other projects, but for the time being Shuster was through with Superman.[20] Siegel wrote to numerous artists.[19] The first response came in July 1933 from Leo O'Mealia, who drew the Fu Manchu strip for the Bell Syndicate.[21][22] In the script that Siegel sent to O'Mealia, Superman's origin story changes: He is a \"scientist-adventurer\" from the far future when humanity has naturally evolved \"superpowers\". Just before the Earth explodes, he escapes in a time-machine to the modern era, whereupon he immediately begins using his superpowers to fight crime.[23] O'Mealia produced a few strips and showed them to his newspaper syndicate, but they were rejected. O'Mealia did not send to Siegel any copies of his strips, and they have been lost.[24] In June 1934, Siegel found another partner, an artist in Chicago named Russell Keaton.[25][26] Keaton drew the Buck Rogers and Skyroads comic strips. In the script that Siegel sent Keaton in June, Superman's origin story further evolved: In the distant future, when Earth is on the verge of exploding due to \"giant cataclysms\", the last surviving man sends his three-year-old son back in time to the year 1935. The time-machine appears on a road where it is discovered by motorists Sam and Molly Kent. They leave the boy in an orphanage, but the staff struggle to control him because he has superhuman strength and impenetrable skin. The Kents adopt the boy and name him Clark, and teach him that he must use his fantastic natural gifts for the benefit of humanity. In November, Siegel sent Keaton an extension of his script: an adventure where Superman foils a conspiracy to kidnap a star football player. The extended script mentions that Clark puts on a special \"uniform\" when assuming the identity of Superman, but it is not described.[27] Keaton produced two weeks' worth of strips based on Siegel's script. In November, Keaton showed his strips to a newspaper syndicate, but they too were rejected, and he abandoned the project.[28][29] Siegel and Shuster reconciled and resumed developing Superman together. The character became an alien from the planet Krypton. Shuster designed the now-familiar costume: tights with an \"S\" on the chest, over-shorts, and a cape.[30][31][32] They made Clark Kent a journalist who pretends to be timid, and conceived his colleague Lois Lane, who is attracted to the bold and mighty Superman but does not realize that he and Kent are the same person.[33] In June 1935 Siegel and Shuster finally found work with National Allied Publications, a comic magazine publishing company in New York owned by Malcolm Wheeler-Nicholson.[35] Wheeler-Nicholson published two of their strips in New Fun Comics #6 (1935): \"Henri Duval\" and \"Doctor Occult\".[36] Siegel and Shuster also showed him Superman and asked him to market Superman to the newspapers on their behalf.[37] In October, Wheeler-Nicholson offered to publish Superman in one of his own magazines.[38] Siegel and Shuster refused his offer because Wheeler-Nicholson had demonstrated himself to be an irresponsible businessman. He had been slow to respond to their letters and had not paid them for their work in New Fun Comics #6. They chose to keep marketing Superman to newspaper syndicates themselves.[39][40] Despite the erratic pay, Siegel and Shuster kept working for Wheeler-Nicholson because he was the only publisher who was buying their work, and over the years they produced other adventure strips for his magazines.[41] Wheeler-Nicholson's financial difficulties continued to mount. In 1936, he formed a joint corporation with Harry Donenfeld and Jack Liebowitz called Detective Comics, Inc. in order to release his third magazine, which was titled Detective Comics. Siegel and Shuster produced stories for Detective Comics too, such as \"Slam Bradley\". Wheeler-Nicholson fell into deep debt to Donenfeld and Liebowitz, and in early January 1938, Donenfeld and Liebowitz petitioned Wheeler-Nicholson's company into bankruptcy and seized it.[3][42] In early December 1937, Siegel visited Liebowitz in New York, and Liebowitz asked Siegel to produce some comics for an upcoming comic anthology magazine called Action Comics.[43][44] Siegel proposed some new stories, but not Superman. Siegel and Shuster were, at the time, negotiating a deal with the McClure Newspaper Syndicate for Superman. In early January 1938, Siegel had a three-way telephone conversation with Liebowitz and an employee of McClure named Max Gaines. Gaines informed Siegel that McClure had rejected Superman, and asked if he could forward their Superman strips to Liebowitz so that Liebowitz could consider them for Action Comics. Siegel agreed.[45] Liebowitz and his colleagues were impressed by the strips, and they asked Siegel and Shuster to develop the strips into 13 pages for Action Comics.[46] Having grown tired of rejections, Siegel and Shuster accepted the offer. At least now they would see Superman published.[47][48] Siegel and Shuster submitted their work in late February and were paid US$130 (equivalent to $2,800 in 2023) for their work ($10 per page).[49] In early March they signed a contract at Liebowitz's request in which they gave away the copyright for Superman to Detective Comics, Inc. This was normal practice in the business, and Siegel and Shuster had given away the copyrights to their previous works as well.[50] The duo's revised version of Superman appeared in the first issue of Action Comics, which was published on April 18, 1938. The issue was a huge success thanks to Superman's feature.[1][51][52] Siegel and Shuster read pulp science-fiction and adventure magazines, and many stories featured characters with fantastical abilities such as telepathy, clairvoyance, and superhuman strength. One character in particular was John Carter of Mars from the novels by Edgar Rice Burroughs. John Carter is a human who is transported to Mars, where the lower gravity makes him stronger than the natives and allows him to leap great distances.[53][54] Another influence was Philip Wylie's 1930 novel Gladiator, featuring a protagonist named Hugo Danner who had similar powers.[55][56] Superman's stance and devil-may-care attitude were influenced by the characters of Douglas Fairbanks, who starred in adventure films such as The Mark of Zorro and Robin Hood.[57] The name of Superman's home city, Metropolis, was taken from the 1927 film of the same name.[58] Popeye cartoons were also an influence.[58] Clark Kent's harmless facade and dual identity were inspired by the protagonists of such movies as Don Diego de la Vega in The Mark of Zorro and Sir Percy Blakeney in The Scarlet Pimpernel. Siegel thought this would make for interesting dramatic contrast and good humor.[59][60] Another inspiration was slapstick comedian Harold Lloyd. The archetypal Lloyd character was a mild-mannered man who finds himself abused by bullies but later in the story snaps and fights back furiously.[61] Kent is a journalist because Siegel often imagined himself becoming one after leaving school. The love triangle between Lois Lane, Clark, and Superman was inspired by Siegel's own awkwardness with girls.[62] The pair collected comic strips in their youth, with a favorite being Winsor McCay's fantastical Little Nemo.[58] Shuster remarked on the artists who played an important part in the development of his own style: \"Alex Raymond and Burne Hogarth were my idols – also Milt Caniff, Hal Foster, and Roy Crane.\"[58] Shuster taught himself to draw by tracing over the art in the strips and magazines they collected.[3] As a boy, Shuster was interested in fitness culture[63] and a fan of strongmen such as Siegmund Breitbart and Joseph Greenstein. He collected fitness magazines and manuals and used their photographs as visual references for his art.[3] The visual design of Superman came from multiple influences. The tight-fitting suit and shorts were inspired by the costumes of wrestlers, boxers, and strongmen. In early concept art, Shuster gave Superman laced sandals like those of strongmen and classical heroes, but these were eventually changed to red boots.[34] The costumes of Douglas Fairbanks were also an influence.[64] The emblem on his chest was inspired by heraldic crests.[65] Many pulp action heroes such as swashbucklers wore capes. Superman's face was based on Johnny Weissmuller with touches derived from the comic-strip character Dick Tracy and from the work of cartoonist Roy Crane.[66] The word \"superman\" was commonly used in the 1920s and 1930s to describe men of great ability, most often athletes and politicians.[67] It occasionally appeared in pulp fiction stories as well, such as \"The Superman of Dr. Jukes\".[68] It is unclear whether Siegel and Shuster were influenced by Friedrich Nietzsche's concept of the Übermensch; they never acknowledged as much.[69] Since 1938, Superman stories have been regularly published in periodical comic books published by DC Comics. The first and oldest of these is Action Comics, which began in April 1938.[1] Action Comics was initially an anthology magazine, but it eventually became dedicated to Superman stories. The second oldest periodical is Superman, which began in June 1939. Action Comics and Superman have been published without interruption (ignoring changes to the title and numbering scheme).[71][72] Several other shorter-lived Superman periodicals have been published over the years.[73] Superman is part of the DC Universe, which is a shared setting of superhero characters owned by DC Comics, and consequently he frequently appears in stories alongside the likes of Batman, Wonder Woman, and others. More Superman comic books have been sold in publication history than any other American superhero character.[74] Exact sales figures for the early decades of Superman comic books are hard to find because, like most publishers at the time, DC Comics concealed this data from its competitors and thereby the general public, but given the general market trends at the time, sales of Action Comics and Superman probably peaked in the mid-1940s and thereafter steadily declined.[75] Sales data first became public in 1960, and showed that Superman was the best-selling comic book character of the 1960s and 1970s.[2][76][77] Sales rose again starting in 1987. Superman #75 (Nov 1992) had over 23 million copies sold,[78] making it the best-selling issue of a comic book of all time, due to a media sensation over The Death of Superman in that issue.[79] Sales declined from that point on. In March 2018, Action Comics sold just 51,534 copies, although such low figures are normal for superhero comic books in general (for comparison, Amazing Spider-Man #797 sold only 128,189 copies).[80] The comic books have become a niche aspect of the Superman franchise due to low readership,[81] though they remain influential as creative engines for the movies and television shows. Comic book stories can be produced quickly and cheaply, and are thus an ideal medium for experimentation.[82] Whereas comic books in the 1950s were read by children, since the 1990s the average reader has been an adult.[83] A major reason for this shift was DC Comics' decision in the 1970s to sell its comic books to specialty stores instead of traditional magazine retailers (supermarkets, newsstands, etc.) — a model called \"direct distribution\". This made comic books less accessible to children.[84] Beginning in January 1939, a Superman daily comic strip appeared in newspapers, syndicated through the McClure Syndicate. A color Sunday version was added that November. Jerry Siegel wrote most of the strips until he was conscripted into the United States Army in 1943. The Sunday strips had a narrative continuity separate from the daily strips, possibly because Siegel had to delegate the Sunday strips to ghostwriters.[85] By 1941, the newspaper strips had an estimated readership of 20 million.[86] Joe Shuster drew the early strips, then passed the job to Wayne Boring.[87] From 1949 to 1956, the newspaper strips were drawn by Win Mortimer.[88] The strip ended in May 1966, but was revived from 1977 to 1983 to coincide with a series of movies released by Warner Bros.[89] Initially, Siegel was allowed to write Superman more or less as he saw fit because nobody had anticipated the success and rapid expansion of the franchise.[90][91] But soon Siegel and Shuster's work was put under careful oversight for fear of trouble with censors.[92] Siegel was forced to tone down the violence and social crusading that characterized his early stories.[93] Editor Whitney Ellsworth, hired in 1940, dictated that Superman not kill.[94] Sexuality was banned, and colorfully outlandish villains such as Ultra-Humanite and Toyman were thought to be less nightmarish for young readers.[95] Mort Weisinger was the editor on Superman comics from 1941 to 1970, his tenure briefly interrupted by military service. Siegel and his fellow writers had developed the character with little thought of building a coherent mythology, but as the number of Superman titles and the pool of writers grew, Weisinger demanded a more disciplined approach.[96] Weisinger assigned story ideas, and the logic of Superman's powers, his origin, the locales, and his relationships with his growing cast of supporting characters were carefully planned. Elements such as Bizarro, his cousin Supergirl, the Phantom Zone, the Fortress of Solitude, alternate varieties of kryptonite, robot doppelgangers, and Krypto were introduced during this era. The complicated universe built under Weisinger was beguiling to devoted readers but alienating to casuals.[97] Weisinger favored lighthearted stories over serious drama, and avoided sensitive subjects such as the Vietnam War and the American civil rights movement because he feared his right-wing views would alienate his left-leaning writers and readers.[98] Weisinger also introduced letters columns in 1958 to encourage feedback and build intimacy with readers.[99] Weisinger retired in 1970 and Julius Schwartz took over. By his own admission, Weisinger had grown out of touch with newer readers.[100] Starting with The Sandman Saga, Schwartz updated Superman by making Clark Kent a television anchor, and he retired overused plot elements such as kryptonite and robot doppelgangers.[101] Schwartz also scaled Superman's powers down to a level closer to Siegel's original. These changes would eventually be reversed by later writers. Schwartz allowed stories with serious drama such as \"For the Man Who Has Everything\" (Superman Annual #11), in which the villain Mongul torments Superman with an illusion of happy family life on a living Krypton. Schwartz retired from DC Comics in 1986 and was succeeded by Mike Carlin as an editor on Superman comics. His retirement coincided with DC Comics' decision to reboot the DC Universe with the companywide-crossover storyline \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\". In The Man of Steel writer John Byrne rewrote the Superman mythos, again reducing Superman's powers, which writers had slowly re-strengthened, and revised many supporting characters, such as making Lex Luthor a billionaire industrialist rather than a mad scientist, and making Supergirl an artificial shapeshifting organism because DC wanted Superman to be the sole surviving Kryptonian. Carlin was promoted to Executive Editor for the DC Universe books in 1996, a position he held until 2002. K.C. Carlson took his place as editor of the Superman comics. In the earlier decades of Superman comics, artists were expected to conform to a certain \"house style\".[102] Joe Shuster defined the aesthetic style of Superman in the 1940s. After Shuster left National, Wayne Boring succeeded him as the principal artist on Superman comic books.[103] He redrew Superman taller and more detailed.[104] Around 1955, Curt Swan in turn succeeded Boring.[105] The 1980s saw a boom in the diversity of comic book art and now there is no single \"house style\" in Superman comics.[citation needed] The first adaptation of Superman beyond comic books was a radio show, The Adventures of Superman, which ran from 1940 to 1951 for 2,088 episodes, most of which were aimed at children. The episodes were initially 15 minutes long, but after 1949 they were lengthened to 30 minutes. Most episodes were done live.[106] Bud Collyer was the voice actor for Superman in most episodes. The show was produced by Robert Maxwell and Allen Ducovny, who were employees of Superman, Inc. and Detective Comics, Inc. respectively.[107][108] In 1966 Superman had a Tony-nominated musical play produced on Broadway. It's a Bird... It's a Plane... It's Superman featured music by Charles Strouse, lyrics by Lee Adams and book by David Newman and Robert Benton. Actor Bob Holiday performed as Clark Kent/Superman and actress Patricia Marand performed as Lois Lane. DC Comics trademarked the Superman chest logo in August 1938.[126] Jack Liebowitz established Superman, Inc. in October 1939 to develop the franchise beyond the comic books.[51] Superman, Inc. merged with DC Comics in October 1946.[127] After DC Comics merged with Warner Communications in 1967, licensing for Superman was handled by the Licensing Corporation of America.[128] The Licensing Letter (an American market research firm) estimated that Superman licensed merchandise made $634 million in sales globally in 2018 (43.3% of this revenue came from the North American market). For comparison, in the same year, Spider-Man merchandise made $1.075 billion and Star Wars merchandise made $1.923 billion globally.[129] The earliest paraphernalia appeared in 1939: a button proclaiming membership in the Supermen of America club. The first toy was a wooden doll in 1939 made by the Ideal Novelty and Toy Company.[130] Superman #5 (May 1940) carried an advertisement for a \"Krypto-Raygun\", which was a gun-shaped device that could project images on a wall.[131] The majority of Superman merchandise is targeted at children, but since the 1970s, adults have been increasingly targeted because the comic book readership has gotten older.[132] During World War II, Superman was used to support the war effort. Action Comics and Superman carried messages urging readers to buy war bonds and participate in scrap drives.[133] Other superheroes became patriots who went to fight: Batman, Wonder Woman and Captain America. In a contract dated March 1, 1938, Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster gave away the copyright to Superman to their employer, DC Comics (then known as Detective Comics, Inc.)[b] prior to Superman's first publication in April. Contrary to popular perception, the $130 that DC Comics paid them was for their first Superman story, not the copyright to the character — that, they gave away for free. This was normal practice in the comic magazine industry and they had done the same with their previous published works (Slam Bradley, Doctor Occult, etc.),[50] but Superman became far more popular and valuable than they anticipated and they much regretted giving him away.[134] DC Comics retained Siegel and Shuster, and they were paid well because they were popular with the readers.[135] Between 1938 and 1947, DC Comics paid them together at least $401,194.85 (equivalent to $7,310,000 in 2023).[136][137] Siegel wrote most of the magazine and daily newspaper stories until he was conscripted into the United States Army in 1943, whereupon the task was passed to ghostwriters.[138][139] While Siegel was serving in Hawaii, DC Comics published a story featuring a child version of Superman called \"Superboy\", which was based on a script Siegel had submitted several years before. Siegel was furious because DC Comics did this without having bought the character.[140] After Siegel's discharge from the Army, he and Shuster sued DC Comics in 1947 for the rights to Superman and Superboy. The judge ruled that Superman belonged to DC Comics, but that Superboy was a separate entity that belonged to Siegel. Siegel and Shuster settled out-of-court with DC Comics, which paid the pair $94,013.16 (equivalent to $1,192,222 in 2023) in exchange for the full rights to both Superman and Superboy.[141] DC Comics then fired Siegel and Shuster.[142] DC Comics rehired Jerry Siegel as a writer in 1959. In 1965, Siegel and Shuster attempted to regain rights to Superman using the renewal option in the Copyright Act of 1909, but the court ruled Siegel and Shuster had transferred the renewal rights to DC Comics in 1938. Siegel and Shuster appealed, but the appeals court upheld this decision. DC Comics fired Siegel once again, when he filed this second lawsuit.[143] In 1975, Siegel and several other comic book writers and artists launched a public campaign for better compensation and treatment of comic creators. Warner Brothers agreed to give Siegel and Shuster a yearly stipend, full medical benefits, and credit their names in all future Superman productions in exchange for never contesting ownership of Superman. Siegel and Shuster upheld this bargain.[3] Shuster died in 1992. DC Comics offered Shuster's heirs a stipend in exchange for never challenging ownership of Superman, which they accepted for some years.[141] Siegel died in 1996. His heirs attempted to take the rights to Superman using the termination provision of the Copyright Act of 1976. DC Comics negotiated an agreement wherein it would pay the Siegel heirs several million dollars and a yearly stipend of $500,000 in exchange for permanently granting DC the rights to Superman. DC Comics also agreed to insert the line \"By Special Arrangement with the Jerry Siegel Family\" in all future Superman productions.[144] The Siegels accepted DC's offer in an October 2001 letter.[141] Copyright lawyer and movie producer Marc Toberoff then struck a deal with the heirs of both Siegel and Shuster to help them get the rights to Superman in exchange for signing the rights over to his production company, Pacific Pictures. Both groups accepted. The Siegel heirs called off their deal with DC Comics and in 2004 sued DC for the rights to Superman and Superboy. In 2008, the judge ruled in favor of the Siegels. DC Comics appealed the decision, and the appeals court ruled in favor of DC, arguing that the October 2001 letter was binding. In 2003, the Shuster heirs served a termination notice for Shuster's grant of his half of the copyright to Superman. DC Comics sued the Shuster heirs in 2010, and the court ruled in DC's favor on the grounds that the 1992 agreement with the Shuster heirs barred them from terminating the grant.[141] Under current US copyright law, Superman is due to enter the public domain on January 1, 2034.[145][c] However, this will only apply (at first) to the character as he is depicted in Action Comics #1, which was published in 1938. Versions of him with later developments, such as his power of \"heat vision\", may persist under copyright until the works they were introduced in enter the public domain.[146] Lois Lane, who also debuted in Action Comics #1, is expected to enter public domain in 2034, but supporting characters introduced in later publications, such as Jimmy Olsen and Supergirl, will pass into the public domain at later dates. Superman's success immediately begat a wave of imitations. The most successful is Captain Marvel, first published by Fawcett Comics in December 1939. Captain Marvel had many similarities to Superman: Herculean strength, invulnerability, the ability to fly, a cape, a secret identity, and a job as a journalist. DC Comics filed a lawsuit against Fawcett Comics for copyright infringement.[citation needed] The trial began in March 1948 after seven years of discovery. The judge ruled that Fawcett had indeed infringed on Superman. However, the judge also found that the copyright notices that appeared with the Superman newspaper strips did not meet the technical standards of the Copyright Act of 1909 and were therefore invalid. Furthermore, since the newspaper strips carried stories adapted from Action Comics, the judge ruled that DC Comics had effectively abandoned the copyright to the Action Comics stories and Superman, and therefore forfeited its right to sue Fawcett for copyright infringement.[141] DC Comics appealed this decision. The appeals court ruled that unintentional mistakes in the copyright notices of the newspaper strips did not invalidate the copyrights. Furthermore, Fawcett knew that DC Comics never intended to abandon the copyrights, and therefore Fawcett's infringement was not an innocent misunderstanding, and therefore Fawcett owed damages to DC Comics.[d] The appeals court remanded the case back to the lower court to determine how much Fawcett owed in damages.[141] At that point, Fawcett Comics decided to settle out of court with DC Comics. Fawcett paid DC Comics $400,000 (equivalent to $4,555,000 in 2023) and agreed to stop publishing Captain Marvel. The last Captain Marvel story from Fawcett Comics was published in September 1953.[147] DC Comics licensed Captain Marvel in 1972 and published crossover stories with Superman. By 1991, DC Comics had purchased Fawcett Comics and with it the full rights to Captain Marvel. DC eventually renamed the character \"Shazam\" to prevent disputes with Marvel Comics, who had created a character of their own named \"Captain Marvel\" back when the Fawcett character had lingered in limbo.[148] Several elements of the Superman narrative have remained consistent in the myriad stories published since 1938. In Action Comics #1 (1938), Superman is born on an alien world to a technologically advanced species that resembles humans. Shortly after he is born, his planet is destroyed in a natural cataclysm, but his scientist father foresaw the calamity and saves his baby son by sending him to Earth in a small spaceship. The ship is too small to carry anyone else, so Superman's parents stay behind and die. The earliest newspaper strips name the planet Krypton, the baby Kal-L, and his biological parents Jor-L and Lora;[149] their names were changed to Jor-el, and Lara in a 1942 spinoff novel by George Lowther.[150] The ship lands in the American countryside, where the baby is discovered by the Kents, a farming couple. The Kents name the boy Clark and raise him in a farming community. A 1947 episode of the radio serial places this yet unnamed community in Iowa.[151] It is named Smallville in Superboy #2 (June 1949). The 1978 Superman movie placed it in Kansas, as have most Superman stories since.[152] New Adventures of Superboy #22 (Oct. 1981) places it in Maryland. In Action Comics #1 and most stories published before 1986, Superman's powers begin developing in infancy. From 1944 to 1986, DC Comics regularly published stories of Superman's childhood and adolescent adventures, when he called himself \"Superboy\". From 1986 on (beginning with Man of Steel #1), Superman's powers emerged more slowly and he began his superhero career as an adult. The Kents teach Clark he must conceal his otherworldly origins and use his fantastic powers to do good. Clark creates the costumed identity of Superman so as to protect his personal privacy and the safety of his loved ones. As Clark Kent, he wears eyeglasses to disguise his face and wears his Superman costume underneath his clothes so that he can change at a moment's notice. To complete this disguise, Clark avoids violent confrontation, preferring to slip away and change into Superman when danger arises, and in older stories he would suffer occasional ridicule for his apparent cowardice. In Superboy #78 (1960), Superboy makes his costume out of the indestructible blankets found in the ship he came to Earth in. In Man of Steel #1 (1986), Martha Kent makes the costume from human-manufactured cloth, and it is rendered indestructible by an aura that Superman projects. The \"S\" on Superman's chest at first was simply an initial for \"Superman\". When writing the script for the 1978 movie, Tom Mankiewicz made it the crest of Superman's Kryptonian family, the House of El.[153] This was carried over into some comic book stories and later movies, such as Man of Steel. In the comic story Superman: Birthright, the crest is described as an old Kryptonian symbol for hope. Clark works as a newspaper journalist. In the earliest stories, he worked for The Daily Star, but the second episode of the radio serial changed this to the Daily Planet. In comics from the early 1970s, Clark worked as a television journalist, which was an attempt to modernize the character. However, for the 1978 movie, the producers chose to make Clark a newspaper journalist again because that was how most people outside of comic book readers knew him.[154] The first story in which Superman dies was published in Superman #149 (1961), in which he is murdered by Lex Luthor by means of kryptonite. This story was \"imaginary\" and therefore was ignored in subsequent books. In Superman #188 (April 1966), Superman is killed by kryptonite radiation but is revived in the same issue by one of his android doppelgangers. In the 1990s The Death and Return of Superman story arc, after a deadly battle with Doomsday, Superman died in Superman #75 (Jan. 1993). He was later revived by the Eradicator using Kryptonian technology. In Superman #52 (May 2016) Superman is killed by kryptonite poisoning, and this time he is not resurrected, but replaced by the Superman of an alternate timeline. Superman maintains a secret hideout called the \"Fortress of Solitude\", which is located somewhere in the Arctic. Here, Superman keeps a collection of mementos and a laboratory for science experiments. Action Comics #241 (1958) depicts the Fortress of Solitude as a cave in a mountain, sealed with a very heavy door that is opened with a gigantic key too heavy for anyone but Superman to use. In the 1978 movie, the Fortress of Solitude is a structure made of white crystal. Superman's secret identity is Clark Joseph Kent, a reporter for the Daily Planet. Although his name and history originate from his early life with his adoptive Earth parents, everything about Clark was staged for the benefit of his alternate identity: as a reporter for the Daily Planet, he receives late-breaking news before the general public, always has a plausible reason to be present at crime scenes, and need not strictly account for his whereabouts as long as he makes his publication deadlines. He sees his job as a journalist as an extension of his Superman responsibilities—bringing truth to the forefront and fighting for the little guy. He believes that everybody has the right to know what is going on in the world, regardless of who is involved.[155] In the Bronze Age of Comic Books, Clark Kent was featured in a series that appeared primarily in The Superman Family, \"The Private Life of Clark Kent\" where Superman dealt with various situations subtly while remaining Clark. To deflect suspicion that he is Superman, Clark Kent adopted a mainly passive and introverted personality with conservative mannerisms, a higher-pitched voice, and a slight slouch. This personality is typically described as \"mild-mannered\", as in the opening narration of Max Fleischer's Superman animated theatrical shorts. These traits extended into Clark's wardrobe, which typically consists of a bland-colored business suit, a red necktie, black-rimmed glasses, combed-back hair, and occasionally a fedora. Clark wears his Superman costume underneath his street clothes, allowing easy changes between the two personae and the dramatic gesture of ripping open his shirt to reveal the familiar \"S\" emblem when called into action. His hair also changes with the clothing change, with Superman sporting a small curl or spit curl on his forehead. Superman usually stores his Clark Kent clothing compressed in a secret pouch within his cape,[156] though some stories have shown him leaving his clothes in some covert location (such as the Daily Planet storeroom)[157] for later retrieval. As Superman's alter ego, the personality, concept, and name of Clark Kent have become synonymous with secret identities and innocuous fronts for ulterior motives and activities. In 1992, Superman co-creator Joe Shuster told the Toronto Star that the name derived from 1930s cinematic leading men Clark Gable and Kent Taylor, but the persona from bespectacled silent film comic Harold Lloyd and himself.[158] Clark's middle name is given variously as either Joseph, Jerome, or Jonathan, all being allusions to creators Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster. In the original Siegel and Shuster stories, Superman's personality is rough and aggressive. He often uses excessive force and terror against criminals, on some occasions even killing them. This came to an end in late 1940 when new editor Whitney Ellsworth instituted a code of conduct for his characters to follow, banning Superman from ever killing.[159] The character was softened and given a sense of humanitarianism. Ellsworth's code, however, is not to be confused with \"the Comics Code\", which was created in 1954 by the Comics Code Authority and ultimately abandoned by every major comic book publisher by the early 21st century. In his first appearances, Superman was considered a vigilante by the authorities, being fired upon by the National Guard as he razed a slum so that the government would create better housing conditions for the poor. By 1942, however, Superman was working side-by-side with the police.[160][161] Today, Superman is commonly seen as a brave and kind-hearted hero with a strong sense of justice, morality, and righteousness. He adheres to an unwavering moral code instilled in him by his adoptive parents.[162] His commitment to operating within the law has been an example to many citizens and other heroes, but has stirred resentment and criticism among others, who refer to him as the \"big blue boy scout\". Superman can be rather rigid in this trait, causing tensions in the superhero community.[163] This was most notable with Wonder Woman, one of his closest friends, after she killed Maxwell Lord.[163] Booster Gold initially had an icy relationship with the Man of Steel but grew to respect him.[164] Having lost his home world of Krypton, Superman is very protective of Earth,[165] and especially of Clark Kent's family and friends. This same loss, combined with the pressure of using his powers responsibly, has caused Superman to feel lonely on Earth, despite having his friends and parents. Previous encounters with people he thought to be fellow Kryptonians, Power Girl[166] and Mon-El,[167] have led to disappointment. The arrival of Supergirl, who has been confirmed to be his cousin from Krypton, relieved this loneliness somewhat.[168] Superman's Fortress of Solitude acts as a place of solace for him in times of loneliness and despair.[169] The catalog of Superman's abilities and his strength has varied considerably over the vast body of Superman fiction released since 1938. Since Action Comics #1 (1938), Superman has superhuman strength. The cover of Action Comics #1 shows him effortlessly lifting a car over his head. Another classic feat of strength on Superman's part is breaking steel chains. In some stories, he is strong enough to shift the orbits of planets[170] and crush coal into diamond with his hands. Since Action Comics #1 (1938), Superman has a highly durable body, invulnerable for most practical purposes. At the very least, bullets bounce harmlessly off his body. In some stories, such as Kingdom Come, not even a nuclear bomb can harm him. In the earliest stories, Superman's costume is made out of exotic materials that are as tough as he is, which is why it typically does not tear up when he performs superhuman feats. In later stories, beginning with Man of Steel #1 (1986), Superman's body is said to project an aura that renders invulnerable any tight-fitting clothes he wears, and hence his costume is as durable as he is even if made of common cloth. In Action Comics #1, Superman could not fly. He traveled by running and leaping, which he could do to a prodigious degree thanks to his strength. Superman gained the ability to fly in the second episode of the radio serial in 1940.[171] Superman can fly faster than sound and in some stories, he can even fly faster than the speed of light to travel to distant galaxies. Superman can project and perceive X-rays via his eyes, which allows him to see through objects. He first uses this power in Action Comics #11 (1939). Certain materials such as lead can block his X-ray vision. Superman can project beams of heat from his eyes which are hot enough to melt steel. He first used this power in Superman #59 (1949) by applying his X-ray vision at its highest intensity. In later stories, this ability is simply called \"heat vision\". Superman can hear sounds that are too faint for a human to hear, and at frequencies outside the human hearing range. This ability was introduced in Action Comics #11 (1939). Since Action Comics #20 (1940), Superman possesses superhuman breath, which enables him to inhale or blow huge amounts of air, as well as holding his breath indefinitely to remain underwater or space without adverse effects. He has a significant focus of his breath's intensity to the point of freezing targets by blowing on them. The \"freeze breath\" was first demonstrated in Superman #129 (1959). Action Comics #1 (1938) explained that Superman's strength was common to all Kryptonians because they were a species \"millions of years advanced of our own\". In the first newspaper strips, Jor-El is shown running and leaping like Superman, and his wife survives a building collapsing on her. Later stories explained they evolved superhuman strength simply because of Krypton's higher gravity. Superman #146 (1961) established that Superman's abilities other than strength (flight, durability, etc.) are activated by the light of Earth's yellow sun. In Action Comics #300 (1963), all of his powers including strength are activated by yellow sunlight and can be deactivated by red sunlight similar to that of Krypton's sun. Exposure to green kryptonite radiation nullifies Superman's powers and incapacitates him with pain and nausea; prolonged exposure will eventually kill him. Although green kryptonite is the most commonly seen form, writers have introduced other forms over the years: such as red, gold, blue, white, and black, each with peculiar effects.[172] Gold kryptonite, for instance, nullifies Superman's powers but otherwise does not harm him. Kryptonite first appeared in a 1943 episode of the radio serial.[173] It first appeared in comics in Superman #61 (Dec. 1949).[174] Superman is also vulnerable to magic. Enchanted weapons and magical spells affect Superman as easily as they would a normal human. This weakness was established in Superman #171 (1964). Like all Kryptonians, Kal-El is also highly susceptible to psychokinetic phenomena ranging along Telekinesis, Illusion casting, Mind control, etc., as shown in Wonder Woman Vol 2 # 219 (Sept. 2005). A powerful enough psionic can affect either the psyche or microbiology of Superman to induce strokes or mangle his internal organs, as well as disrupt his mind and perceptions of the world, something a young power-amped Gene-Bomb meta showcased in Superman #48 (Oct. 1990). Superman's first and most famous supporting character is Lois Lane, introduced in Action Comics #1. She is a fellow journalist at the Daily Planet. As Jerry Siegel conceived her, Lois considers Clark Kent to be a wimp, but she is infatuated with the bold and mighty Superman, not knowing that Kent and Superman are the same person. Siegel objected to any proposal that Lois discover that Clark is Superman because he felt that, as implausible as Clark's disguise is, the love triangle was too important to the book's appeal.[175] However, Siegel wrote stories in which Lois suspects Clark is Superman and tries to prove it, with Superman always duping her in the end; the first such story was in Superman #17 (July–August 1942).[176][177] This was a common plot in comic book stories prior to the 1970s. In a story in Action Comics #484 (June 1978), Clark Kent admits to Lois that he is Superman, and they marry. This was the first story in which Superman and Lois marry that was not an \"imaginary tale\". Many Superman stories since then have depicted Superman and Lois as a married couple, but about as many depict them in the classic love triangle. In modern era comic books, Superman and Lois are a stable married couple, and the Superman supporting cast was further expanded with the introduction of their son, Jonathan Kent. Other supporting characters include Jimmy Olsen, a photographer at the Daily Planet, who is friends with both Superman and Clark Kent, though in most stories he does not know that Clark is Superman. Jimmy is frequently described as \"Superman's pal\", and was conceived to give young male readers a relatable character through which they could fantasize being friends with Superman. In the earliest comic book stories, Clark Kent's employer is George Taylor of The Daily Star, but the second episode of the radio serial changed this to Perry White of the Daily Planet.[178] Clark Kent's foster parents are Ma and Pa Kent. In many stories, one or both of them have died by the time Clark becomes Superman. Clark's parents taught him that he should use his abilities for altruistic means, but that he should also find some way to safeguard his private life. The villains Superman faced in the earliest stories were ordinary humans, such as gangsters, corrupt politicians, and violent husbands; but they soon grew more colorful and outlandish so as to avoid offending censors or scaring children. The mad scientist Ultra-Humanite, introduced in Action Comics #13 (June 1939), was Superman's first recurring villain. Superman's best-known nemesis, Lex Luthor, was introduced in Action Comics #23 (April 1940) and has been depicted as either a mad scientist or a wealthy businessman (sometimes both).[179] In 1944, the magical imp Mister Mxyzptlk, Superman's first recurring super-powered adversary, was introduced.[180] Superman's first alien villain, Brainiac, debuted in Action Comics #242 (July 1958). The monstrous Doomsday, introduced in Superman: The Man of Steel #17–18 (Nov.-Dec. 1992), was the first villain to evidently kill Superman in physical combat without exploiting Superman's critical weaknesses such as kryptonite and magic. The details of Superman's origin story and supporting cast vary across his large body of fiction released since 1938, but most versions conform to the basic template described above. A few stories feature radically altered versions of Superman. An example is the graphic novel Superman: Red Son, which depicts a communist Superman who rules the Soviet Union. DC Comics has on some occasions published crossover stories where different versions of Superman interact with each other using the plot device of parallel universes. For instance, in the 1960s, the Superman of \"Earth-One\" would occasionally feature in stories alongside the Superman of \"Earth-Two\", the latter of whom resembled Superman as he was portrayed in the 1940s. DC Comics has not developed a consistent and universal system to classify all versions of Superman. Superman is often considered the first superhero. This point can be debated: Ogon Bat, the Phantom, Zorro, and Mandrake the Magician arguably fit the definition of the superhero yet predate Superman. Nevertheless, Superman popularized this kind of character and established the conventions: a costume, a codename, extraordinary abilities, and an altruistic mission.[citation needed] Superman's success in 1938 begat a wave of imitations, which include Batman, Captain America, and Captain Marvel. This flourishing is today referred to as America's Golden Age of Comic Books, which lasted from 1938 to about 1950. The Golden Age ended when American superhero book sales declined, leading to the cancellation of many characters; but Superman was one of the few superhero franchises that survived this decline, and his sustained popularity into the late 1950s led to a revival in the Silver Age of Comic Books, when characters such as Spider-Man, Iron Man, and The X-Men were created. After World War II, American superhero fiction entered Japanese culture. Astro Boy, first published in 1952, was inspired by Mighty Mouse, which in turn was a parody of Superman.[181] The Superman animated shorts from the 1940s were first broadcast on Japanese television in 1955, and they were followed in 1956 by the TV show Adventures of Superman starring George Reeves. These shows were popular with the Japanese and inspired Japan's own prolific genre of superheroes. The first Japanese superhero movie, Super Giant, was released in 1957. The first Japanese superhero TV show was Moonlight Mask in 1958. Other notable Japanese superheroes include Ultraman, Kamen Rider, and Sailor Moon.[182][183][184] Since the Pop Art period and the 1960s, the character of Superman has been \"appropriated\" by multiple visual artists and incorporated into contemporary artwork,[185][186] most notably by Andy Warhol,[187][188] Roy Lichtenstein,[189] Mel Ramos,[190] Dulce Pinzon,[191] Mr. Brainwash,[192] Raymond Pettibon,[193] Peter Saul,[194] Giuseppe Veneziano,[195] F. Lennox Campello,[196] and others.[192][197][198] Superman has been interpreted and discussed in many forms, with Umberto Eco noting that \"he can be seen as the representative of all his similars\".[199] Writing in Time in 1971, Gerald Clarke stated: \"Superman's enormous popularity might be looked upon as signaling the beginning of the end for the Horatio Alger myth of the self-made man.\" Clarke viewed the comics characters as having to continuously update in order to maintain relevance and thus representing the mood of the nation. He regarded Superman's character in the early seventies as a comment on the modern world, which he saw as a place in which \"only the man with superpowers can survive and prosper\".[200] Andrew Arnold, writing in the early 21st century, has noted Superman's partial role in exploring assimilation, the character's alien status allowing the reader to explore attempts to fit in on a somewhat superficial level. A.C. Grayling, writing in The Spectator, traces Superman's stances through the decades, from his 1930s campaign against crime being relevant to a nation under the influence of Al Capone, through the 1940s and World War II, a period in which Superman helped sell war bonds,[201] and into the 1950s, where Superman explored the new technological threats. Grayling notes the period after the Cold War as being one where \"matters become merely personal: the task of pitting his brawn against the brains of Lex Luthor and Brainiac appeared to be independent of bigger questions\", and discusses events post 9/11, stating that as a nation \"caught between the terrifying George W. Bush and the terrorist Osama bin Laden, America is in earnest need of a Saviour for everything from the minor inconveniences to the major horrors of world catastrophe. And here he is, the down-home clean-cut boy in the blue tights and red cape\".[202] An influence on early Superman stories is the context of the Great Depression. Superman took on the role of social activist, fighting crooked businessmen and politicians and demolishing run-down tenements.[203] Comics scholar Roger Sabin sees this as a reflection of \"the liberal idealism of Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal\", with Shuster and Siegel initially portraying Superman as champion to a variety of social causes.[204][205] In later Superman radio programs the character continued to take on such issues, tackling a version of the Ku Klux Klan in a 1946 broadcast, as well as combating anti-semitism and veteran discrimination.[206][207][208] Scott Bukatman has discussed Superman, and the superhero in general, noting the ways in which they humanize large urban areas through their use of the space, especially in Superman's ability to soar over the large skyscrapers of Metropolis. He writes that the character \"represented, in 1938, a kind of Corbusierian ideal. Superman has X-ray vision: walls become permeable, transparent. Through his benign, controlled authority, Superman renders the city open, modernist and democratic; he furthers a sense that Le Corbusier described in 1925, namely, that 'Everything is known to us'.\"[209] Jules Feiffer has argued that Superman's real innovation lay in the creation of the Clark Kent persona, noting that what \"made Superman extraordinary was his point of origin: Clark Kent.\" Feiffer develops the theme to establish Superman's popularity in simple wish fulfillment,[210] a point Siegel and Shuster themselves supported, Siegel commenting that \"If you're interested in what made Superman what it is, here's one of the keys to what made it universally acceptable. Joe and I had certain inhibitions... which led to wish-fulfillment which we expressed through our interest in science fiction and our comic strip. That's where the dual-identity concept came from\" and Shuster supporting that as being \"why so many people could relate to it\".[211] Ian Gordon suggests that the many incarnations of Superman across media use nostalgia to link the character to an ideology of the American Way. He defines this ideology as a means of associating individualism, consumerism, and democracy and as something that took shape around WWII and underpinned the war effort. Superman, he notes was very much part of that effort.[212] Superman's immigrant status is a key aspect of his appeal.[213][214][215] Aldo Regalado saw the character as pushing the boundaries of acceptance in America. The extraterrestrial origin was seen by Regalado as challenging the notion that Anglo-Saxon ancestry was the source of all might.[216] Gary Engle saw the \"myth of Superman [asserting] with total confidence and a childlike innocence the value of the immigrant in American culture\". He argues that Superman allowed the superhero genre to take over from the Western as the expression of immigrant sensibilities. Through the use of a dual identity, Superman allowed immigrants to identify with both of their cultures. Clark Kent represents the assimilated individual, allowing Superman to express the immigrants' cultural heritage for the greater good.[214] David Jenemann has offered a contrasting view. He argues that Superman's early stories portray a threat: \"the possibility that the exile would overwhelm the country\".[217] David Rooney, a theater critic for The New York Times, in his evaluation of the play Year Zero considers Superman to be the \"quintessential immigrant story [...] [b]orn on an alien planet, he grows stronger on Earth, but maintains a secret identity tied to a homeland that continues to exert a powerful hold on him even as his every contact with those origins does him harm\".[218] It is popularly believed that Superman took inspiration from Judaic mythology. The British rabbi Simcha Weinstein notes that Superman's story has some parallels to that of Moses. For example, Moses as a baby was sent away by his parents in a reed basket to escape death and was adopted by a foreign culture. Weinstein also posits that Superman's Kryptonian name, \"Kal-El\", resembles the Hebrew phrase qōl ʾēl (קוֹל-אֵל) which can be taken to mean \"voice of God\".[219] The historian Larry Tye suggests that this \"Voice of God\" is an allusion to Moses' role as a prophet.[220] The suffix \"el\", meaning \"god\", is also found in the name of angels (e.g. Gabriel, Ariel), who are airborne humanoid agents of good with superhuman powers. The Nazis also thought Superman was a Jew and in 1940 Joseph Goebbels publicly denounced Superman and his creator Jerry Siegel.[221] All that said, historians such as Martin Lund and Les Daniels argue that the evidence for Judaic influence in Siegel and Shuster's stories is merely circumstantial. Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster were not practicing Jews and never acknowledged the influence of Judaism in any memoir or interview.[222][223] Superman stories have occasionally exhibited Christian themes as well. Screenwriter Tom Mankiewicz consciously made Superman an allegory for Jesus Christ in the 1978 movie starring Christopher Reeve: baby Kal-El's ship resembles the Star of Bethlehem, and Jor-El gives his son a messianic mission to lead humanity into a brighter future.[224] This messianic theme was revisited in the 2013 movie Man of Steel, wherein Jor-El asks Superman to redeem the Kryptonian race, which corrupted itself through eugenics, by guiding humanity down a wiser path.[225]",

                "content": "Amazon Labor Union – comprising 10,000 workers across the US – is striking over the company’s refusal to negotiate With Christmas less than a week away, thousands of Amazon warehouse workers across the countries are on strike after the company refused to start contract negotiations with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. Though it’s been well over two years since the first Amazon warehouse union was formed in New York City, and workers at several other warehouses across the country have started to unionize, the company has refused to recognize and negotiate a contract with the union. The Teamsters gave Amazon a 15 December deadline to come to the bargaining table, which the company refused to acknowledge. Here’s what you need to know about the Amazon warehouse strike. Amazon employs more than 1.5 million people around the world. The Amazon Labor Union (ALU) has gained about 10,000 workers across 10 facilities in the US over the last two years. In June, the ALU voted to affiliate with the Teamsters, which has 1.3 million union members across the country. The Teamsters said that seven of the 10 facilities with unions are on strike. The warehouses include one in the borough of Queens in New York, one in Atlanta, three in southern California, one in San Francisco and a seventh in a Chicago suburb. The Teamsters said that Amazon Teamsters at other facilities “are prepared to join them”. The union says the strike is the largest against Amazon in the company’s history. It’s unclear how the strike will affect operations. Amazon has hundreds of thousands of employees still working at delivery hubs and facilities that aren’t unionized. The company said it does not anticipate the strike affecting its operations heading into Christmas. But the Teamsters president, Sean O’Brien, said in a statement on Thursday morning that if Amazon customers have package delays, “you can blame Amazon’s insatiable greed”. “We gave Amazon a clear deadline to come to the table and do right by our members. They ignored it,” he said. “These greedy executives had every chance to show decency and respect for the people who make their obscene profits possible. Instead, they’ve pushed workers to the limit and now they’re paying the price. The strike is on them.” The Teamsters said its local unions will also put up picket lines at hundreds of other non-unionized Amazon fulfillment centers across the country. The Teamsters has not specified how long the strike will last, meaning it could go on past Christmas and into the new year. Sign up to Business Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning after newsletter promotion Though thousands of its employees have voted to unionize, the company has staunchly opposed efforts to increase union membership and has refused to recognize some employees as Amazon workers. The union wants Amazon to negotiate a contract with its members, who are demanding better wages, job security and benefits. Amazon warehouse workers and delivery drivers have long reported conditions that can be taxing on workers. A report from a US Senate committee, led by the Democratic senator Bernie Sanders, released this week accused Amazon of putting workers under heavy quotas that risk their safety. The committee said that Amazon warehouses recorded 30% more injuries at its warehouses over the industry average. Amazon has said that the report is “fundamentally flawed”. Some Amazon Teamster members are delivery drivers who work for third-party companies, called “delivery service partners”, who drive vans with Amazon logos but are technically not employed by the company. Earlier this year, two regional directors with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) issued initial complaints that said Amazon is technically a joint employer of the drivers, even if they are hired by third parties. The hearing over an NLRB complaint in southern California is scheduled for March. In September, Amazon filed its own complaint challenging the structure of the NLRB, arguing that it is unconstitutional because board members cannot be removed by the president. Though the company, along with Elon Musk’s SpaceX, which filed a similar suit, argued in front of a panel of judges from the US court of appeals for the fifth circuit in November, the court has yet to issue a ruling. That’s all to say that Amazon’s resistance to recognizing the union is still tied up in court, and the company maintains that many of the unionized members are not its employees and that the union harasses and intimidates employees. “For more than a year now, the Teamsters have continued to intentionally mislead the public – claiming that they represent ‘thousands of Amazon employees and drivers’. They don’t, and this is another attempt to push a false narrative,” an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement.",

                "title": "Neil Cavuto leaving Fox News is bad news for viewers. Here's why.",
                "content": "Manage your account Everything is coming up roses for Donald Trump. ABC News settles a lawsuit with Trump many legal experts think the network could have won, paying $15 million. Amazon gives $1 million to Trump's inaugural fund. Jeff Bezos, the founder and executive chairman of Amazon, is also the owner of the Washington Post. Remind me, what does democracy die in again? And now, Neil Cavuto is leaving Fox News. This may not seem as momentous, but in its way it is. Trump has long been critical of Cavuto, who hosts \"Your World with Neil Cavuto,\" \"Cavuto: Coast to Coast\" and \"Cavuto Live.\" A Fox News source, however, said that Cavuto's exit had nothing to do with Trump's return to office. Cavuto's contract was up at the end of the month and Cavuto chose to leave. More: Neil Cavuto is leaving Fox News after 28 years amid 'evolving' shifts in business Still. The timing is awful for viewers. Cavuto, who has been at the network for 28 years, was one of the few remaining big personalities willing to criticize Trump — doing so fairly and responsibly — and certainly the most critical of the news team. (Jessica Tarlov remains a reliable critic on \"The Five,\" but she's outnumbered.) For instance, in October Cavuto blasted Trump on the air for spreading misinformation about federal response to Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton. \"That kind of misinformation gets out there, and whether it's perpetrated by a politician or someone you think is someone of note and authority, it is wrong and it is bull and it cannot be tolerated,\" Cavuto said. In February Cavuto cut away from live coverage of a Trump rally to dispute Trump's false claims about the 2020 election. \"We're continuing the monitoring of the president’s remarks,\" Cavuto said, \"and I mean no offense to him if some of you might want to continue hearing. But I did have to say that even though the former president is entitled to his opinions, he’s not entitled to his own set of facts.” Bravo. He's exactly right, and with an emboldened Trump threatening his perceived enemies, it's more important than ever to say that kind of thing. Who's going to say it that strongly now? Certainly, there aren't a lot of candidates who straddle news and personality the way Cavuto does at Fox News. But that's expected; at times the prime-time hosts at times seem to serve practically as campaign boosters for Trump. But what about the rest of the media? ABC News' $15 million will go to Trump's presidential library to settle a defamation lawsuit over an interview anchor George Stephanopoulos conducted in March with U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace, a rape survivor. Stephanopoulos asked how she could support Trump, who has been found liable of sexual abuse by a New York jury. Stephanopoulos repeatedly said Trump had been found liable of rape. Greater legal minds than mine can explain the distinction — and why it would have been difficult for Trump to prove Stephanopoulos intentionally defamed him. The smart money says ABC was worried about what would come out in discovery in emails and texts. Still, it sets the potential for a chilling precedent. And if you think it's going to appease Trump, dream on. He's already filed suit against the Des Moines Register and Gannett over a pre-election poll that showed Trump would lose Iowa; he won the state. (Note: Gannett owns The Arizona Republic.) The Register is standing firm in defense of the poll. Good. Trump has long been a fan of legal threats. If you sued someone every time a poll was wrong, there wouldn't be any polls left. (Although some people might cheer that development.) As for Bezos, who owns several companies, it seems clear he's toadying up to Trump. In addition to the Amazon donation, Bezos dined with him at Mar-a-Lago, effusively congratulated him after the election and, most damningly, killed a Post endorsement of Kamala Harris for president. All of a sudden the paper changed its policies and wasn't going to endorse anymore. Nice timing. Which brings us back to Cavuto. He is expected to address his departure on his last show Thursday. A rotating group of anchors will host his shows until a new show debuts in 2025. Too bad. Media needs more people like Cavuto, not fewer. It's going to be a long four years otherwise.

                "content": "WASHINGTON D.C., DC — Neil Cavuto, a business journalist who hosts a weekday afternoon show on Fox News Channel and has been with the network since its inception in 1996, is leaving after Thursday's show, Fox said. A workhorse at the network, Cavuto also hosts programs at Fox's sister, the Fox Business Network, and is not considered one of the stable of opinion hosts. “Neil Cavuto's illustrious career has been a master class in journalism and we're extremely proud of his incredible 28-year run with Fox News Media,” the network said. “His programs have defined business news and set the standard for the entire industry. We wish him a heartfelt farewell and all the best on his next chapter.” Unlike many at Fox, he has not interviewed President-elect Donald Trump since 2017 and sometimes has angered him. One time came when Cavuto said on his show that Trump had “decisively lost” his debate with Democrat Kamala Harris. Cavuto remarked this summer that when the stock market goes up, Trump says it is because of investors looking forward to him being back in power, but when it's down, he blames the Democrats. On social media Thursday, Trump used all-caps to say Cavuto's departure is “GOOD NEWS FOR AMERICA.” He said it “should have happened a long time ago.” While Cavuto's exit removes a Trump irritant from Fox, that fact had nothing to do with it, said a person at the network with knowledge of the discussions but spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk about contracts. Cavuto's contract was coming to an end and while he was offered an extension, he decided to leave, the person said. With the television news business hurting financially, some major personalities have reportedly been asked to take pay cuts. Some, like the “Today” show's Hoda Kotb, decided to leave instead. Cavuto, 66, has stayed on the job despite a number of health issues through the years. He has multiple sclerosis, underwent heart surgery and had bouts of long COVID. There's no immediate word on who will replace Cavuto at 4 p.m. Eastern on Fox's schedule, a coveted slot before the network's most popular show, “The Five.” ___ David Bauder writes about media for the AP.

                "content": "Neil Patrick Cavuto (born September 22, 1958) is an American television news anchor, executive, commentator, and business journalist. He was the host of Your World with Neil Cavuto and Cavuto Live, both on Fox News, and Cavuto: Coast to Coast on sister channel Fox Business Network until he left the network on December 19, 2024. [1] Cavuto was born in Westbury, New York, on Long Island, the son of Kathleen T. (Feeley), a United Nations staffer and homemaker, and Patrick \"Pat\" Cavuto, a can company sales executive.[2] His father was of Italian descent, while his mother was of Irish ancestry.[3] He was raised in Danbury, Connecticut, where he attended Immaculate High School. At 17, he became the manager of a fish and chips restaurant while attending high school.[4] He worked as a White House intern during the Carter Administration. He graduated from St. Bonaventure University in 1980 with a bachelor's degree in mass communication, and earned a master's degree from American University.[5] Before joining Fox, Cavuto was a principal anchor and reporter for CNBC.[6] He co-anchored CNBC's initial broadcast on April 17, 1989.[6][7] He hosted Power Lunch on CNBC, contributed to NBC's Today, and worked with the Public Broadcasting Service for 15 years reporting for Nightly Business Report. He was also a New York City bureau chief.[8] Cavuto joined Fox News in July 1996, and became host and managing editor of Your World with Neil Cavuto when the network launched in October.[9] He became a vice president of FOX Business News in March 2006. He serves all three positions concurrently.[10] Your World is Fox's main business news program.[11] He has five nominations for Cable ACE awards.[12] He is the author of More Than Money and Your Money or Your Life.[13] Both books were New York Times best sellers.[5] A frequent critic of President Donald Trump, Cavuto has been labeled a \"Trump skeptic\" by NPR and The Daily Beast.[14][15][16] In February 2020, Trump dedicated 20 minutes of a rally in Colorado Springs, Colorado, to attacking him.[17] On December 19, 2024 it was announced that Cavuto would be leaving Fox News after 28 years on air after declining to accept a new contract from Fox. Rotating hosts will helm the program until a new host is named in January 2025. Cavuto and his wife, Mary Fulling, whom he married on October 15, 1983, have three children. They live in Mendham Borough, New Jersey.[18][19] Cavuto has experienced numerous health problems,[20] saying: \"I don't hide that I have had a tough life in many respects. I fought back a near-life-ending cancer, only to end up with multiple sclerosis years later. Doctors have since told me that the odds of contracting both diseases in the same life are something like two million to one! Yet here I am, marching on, continuing to do my job when doctors who've examined my scans and MRIs tell me I shouldn't be walking or talking.\"[21] As reported on June 22, 2016, by Charles Payne on Your World, Cavuto had undergone, and was recovering from, recent cardiac surgery.[22] In October 2021, Cavuto tested positive for COVID-19. He had been vaccinated, and said: \"Had I not been vaccinated, and with all my medical issues, this would be a far more dire situation. It's not, because I did and I'm surviving this because I did.\"[23] He subsequently contracted the disease a second time, and was hospitalized with pneumonia. After recovering, he again praised the efficacy of vaccines and advocated their use.[24]",

                "content": "This is an accepted version of this page Ethan Samuel Slater (born June 2, 1992) is an American actor and singer. He is best known for his role as SpongeBob SquarePants in the musical of the same name, for which he received a Tony Award nomination and won a Drama Desk Award in 2018. He had his first major film role as Boq in the musical film Wicked (2024). Ethan Samuel Slater was born on June 2, 1992, in Washington, D.C. He is the third child of Jay Slater, an employee at the Food and Drug Administration.[1][2] He is Jewish and was raised Conservative, attending Ohr Kodesh in Silver Spring.[3] After attending Charles E. Smith Jewish Day School, his family moved to Silver Spring, Maryland.[4][5][6] Slater's mother died when he was seven, which he describes as a \"really big, formative thing in my life. She had left this huge imprint on me, even though I had so few memories.\"[7] Slater graduated from Georgetown Day School in Washington, DC, and studied drama at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York. During his time in college, he auditioned to apprentice at a Shakespeare workshop, which then got him an audition in front of director Tina Landau.[8] Slater graduated from Vassar with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Drama in 2014.[9] Slater's first theater appearance was at the New York Musical Theatre Festival in July 2015, in which he starred as Luis in the musical Claudio Quest, directed by John Tartaglia,[10] earning a nomination for the festival's award in the category for Best Individual Performance.[11] Between September 30 and October 24, 2015, he starred in Please excuse my dear aunt Sally in the One Year Lease Theater Company.[12] In December 2015 he joined the Delaware Theatre Company in Wilmington, acting in Barry Levinson's play Diner, directed and choreographed by Kathleen Marshall.[13] During the same period he appeared in several short films, including Lightning Bugs in a Jar and Evol. In 2016 Slater was cast in the lead role SpongeBob SquarePants in Kyle Jarrow's musical of the same name directed by Tina Landau at the Oriental Theatre in Chicago.[14] The musical achieved success and was praised by theater critics, bringing the production to Broadway at the Palace Theatre in New York between 2017 and 2018.[15][16] For his performance, Slater earned a Tony Award nomination for Best Actor in a Musical in 2018, winning in the respective category at the Drama Desk Award and Outer Critics Circle Award. He is also awarded the Theatre World Award for Best Performance in a Broadway Debut in 2018.[17][18] Between 2018 and 2019 he appeared in a few episodes of television series, including Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, Murphy Brown, Instinct and The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel. On March 4, 2019, Slater was cast by director Bartlett Sher in the theatrical special of Camelot at the Lincoln Center Theater in New York.[19] Between 2021 and 2022 he starred in the musical Assassins with the direction of John Doyle at the Lynn F. Angelson Theater in New York, playing Lee Harvey Oswald.[20] His performance earned him a Lucille Lortel Awards nomination for Best Performance.[21] From March to April 2022, Slater originated the role of Max Weinbaum in the play Good Night, Oscar at the Goodman Theatre in Chicago.[22] From 2023 to 2024, he played the Historian, Prince Herbert, and other roles in the Broadway revival of Spamalot at the St. James Theatre.[23][24][25] He played Boq in the two-part film adaptation of the musical Wicked, directed by Jon M. Chu.[26][27] Slater began dating clinical psychologist Dr. Lilly Jay,[28] his high school sweetheart, in 2012.[29][30] They married in 2018, and their son was born in 2022.[31] The couple separated in 2023 and Slater subsequently filed for divorce. The same year, Slater began a relationship with singer Ariana Grande, whom he met on the set of Wicked. In September 2024, it was reported that his divorce from Jay had been finalized.[32][33]",

                "content": "When news first broke that pop star Ariana Grande and her Wicked costar Ethan Slater were an item in July 2023, Slater’s estranged wife Lilly Jay described the relationship with a few choice words. Grande “isn’t a girl’s girl,” Jay told Page Six. “My family is just collateral damage.” The former couple has one son together. Now, more than a year of Wicked-mania later, Jay, a clinical psychologist, has published a lengthy essay for The Cut about what happened when her personal life became tabloid fodder. Jay and Slater attend the Tony Awards in June 2018. Jay writes that Slater was her “high-school sweetheart,” and for years, she avoided social media. As Slater began to work as an actor, the divergence between their chosen careers grew stark. “It was a tenuous balance—my profession, which requires privacy, and his, which is measured in applause—but it worked well while life was unfolding according to our plans,” she writes. Ahead of filming for Wicked, Jay moved to London with Slater and their then two-month-old son. “Consumed by the magic and mundanity of new motherhood, I didn’t understand the growing distance between us.” Jay wrote that she and Slater have worked out a co-parenting relationship, but the promotional cycle for Wicked wore on her. “While our partnership has changed, our parenthood has not. Both of us fiercely love our son 100 percent of the time, regardless of how our parenting time is divided,” she said. “As for me, days with my son are sunny. Days when I can’t escape the promotion of a movie associated with the saddest days of my life are darker.” Wicked: Part One opened in theaters on November 22, earning $114 million in its opening weekend, but the promotional tour is ongoing. On Monday, Universal Pictures announced that the sequel would officially be titled Wicked: For Good, and is set to be released in November 2025. As for Slater and Grande, their relationship is still going strong. Earlier this week, Grande took to Instagram to respond with a heart emoji to a black-and-white photo Slater shared from a photo shoot with UK-based Schön Magazine. In another comment, she added that Slater is “the Buster Keaton of today!” Representatives for Slater and Grande did not immediately respond to Vanity Fair.

                "title": "Fair catch kick - Wikipedia",
                "content": "The fair catch kick is a rule at the professional and high school levels of American football that allows a team that has just made a fair catch to attempt a free kick[A] from the spot of the catch. The kick must be either a place kick or a drop kick, and if it passes over the crossbar and between the goalposts of the opposing team's goal, a field goal, worth three points, is awarded to the kicking team. The fair catch kick is considered to be an obscure rule and it is rarely attempted. Because most fair catches are made well out of field goal range, and a team making a fair catch has possession of the ball and a first down, it is rarely to a team's advantage to attempt a fair catch kick rather than run a play from scrimmage. A team may attempt a fair catch kick if it makes a fair catch when the clock expires at the end of either half, as a half must be extended in order to allow a fair catch kick attempt. At the professional level, the most recent successful fair catch kick was made in 2024 by Cameron Dicker of the Los Angeles Chargers against the Denver Broncos; prior to that, the last successful attempt had occurred in 1976. The fair catch kick has its origins in rugby football's goal from mark, which has since been abolished in both major rugby codes; a similar rule, the mark, is a major part of Australian rules football. The fair catch kick rule states that, after a player has successfully made a fair catch or has been awarded a fair catch as the result of a penalty such as kick catch interference, their team can attempt a kick from the spot of the catch;[1][2] the National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS) rulebook also allows a kick to be made if the down following the fair catch or awarded fair catch has to be replayed.[1] Prior to the kick, the opposing team must be lined up at least ten yards beyond the spot of the ball.[3][4] The kick itself can be either a place kick or drop kick;[5][6] a kicking tee cannot be used at the professional level, but use of a tee up to two inches in height is permitted at the high school level.[4][7] Like other field goal attempts, the kicking team is awarded three points if the kick goes above the crossbar and between the goalposts of the opposing team's goal and did not touch a player of the kicking team after the kick.[8][9] If the attempt fails, the opposing team is awarded control of the ball from the spot of the kick.[10][11] The opposing team can also return the kick if it does not go out of bounds.[3][11] In the NFHS rulebook, the fair catch kick is specifically defined as a free kick.[12] The National Football League (NFL) rulebook specifically states that the fair catch kick is not a free kick,[4] instead considering the fair catch kick to be a distinct type of kick.[13] Despite this, reporters at both levels describe the fair catch kick as a free kick.[14][15][16] The XFL (2020) rulebook defines the fair catch kick separately from the free kick. Under the XFL rules, a fair catch kick cannot itself be returned and the play ends when either team secures possession of the ball; the formation is executed under the XFL's rules for an onside kick, which are separate from those of the XFL's standard kickoff formation.[17] The fair catch kick found in American football originated in rugby football. A similar rule in rugby, the goal from mark, allowed a player who had fair caught a ball to attempt an uncontested free kick from the spot of the fair catch. Both major codes of rugby have eliminated the rule; rugby league abolished the goal from mark in 1922, and rugby union removed it in 1977.[18] Australian rules football has retained the rule, and it is a vital part of the Australian game; a \"fair catch\" of a ball kicked more than 15 meters in the air is called a mark, and the player making the mark is then awarded a free kick.[19] The fair catch kick has been present in the NFL rulebook since the league's inception,[14] and also remains in the NFHS rulebook.[20] The fair catch kick is not legal in National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA) football; the NCAA abolished the fair catch in 1950, but re-added it a year later. When the fair catch returned to the rulebook, however, the option to attempt a kick after the fair catch was removed.[21] The fair catch kick rule is very rarely invoked,[14][16][18] and is one of the rarest plays in football.[16][18] The rule has been regarded as \"obscure\",[14][15] \"bizarre\",[18] and \"quirky\".[22] A unique set of circumstances is required for a fair catch kick to be a viable option. For one, the fair catch would need to be made at a point on the field where a field goal attempt has a reasonable chance of being successful;[23] most fair catches are made well outside of field goal range.[24] Furthermore, for a fair catch kick to be a viable option near the end of the fourth quarter, the team attempting the kick needs to be either tied or behind by three points or fewer; even if such a situation were to occur, a coach might still decline to attempt a fair catch kick. For example, New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick, known for his knowledge and utilization of obscure football rules, declined the opportunity to attempt a 75-yard fair catch kick at the end of regulation in Super Bowl LI; although kicker Stephen Gostkowski was able to kick the ball that far and the game was tied, Belichick felt the risk of a return touchdown by the opposing team off a failed kick outweighed the opportunity to score from the kick.[25] Art McNally, who led the officiating department of the National Football League from 1968 to 1990, said that even in the event a fair catch is made within field goal range, most teams would attempt to score a touchdown unless there is not enough time left to score one.[26] Accordingly, most fair catch kick attempts occur when a team has fair-caught a ball from a punt from deep in their opponent's territory but there is not enough time left in the half to go for a touchdown.[18] After Cottonwood High School (Murray, Utah) kicker Ryan Nielson successfully completed a game-winning fair catch kick in 2022, coach Casey Miller said he thought \"I've never seen a chance to do this play in my life. If it's not going to happen now, it will never happen in my lifetime.\"[27] Despite its drawbacks, there are several unique advantages to using the fair catch kick. Because the play does not start until the ball is kicked, the kicker can take a running start before kicking as opposed to the typical two steps taken on regular field goal attempts. Similarly, the kicker does not have to worry about a low snap because the ball is not snapped. Because the defense cannot come within 10 yards of the kicker before the ball is kicked, the kicker can give the ball a lower trajectory than a field goal kick from scrimmage without the threat of it being blocked. The fair catch kick would also be of a shorter distance than a normal field goal attempt from the same spot, because the fair catch kick is taken from the spot of the catch, while a typical field goal is taken seven yards behind the line of scrimmage.[23] The NFL does not keep a record of fair catch kick attempts, so the exact number of attempts is unknown.[26] Out of the 27 recorded fair catch kick attempts in regular season and postseason games, seven were successful; all five known attempts in exhibition games were unsuccessful. With one exception, all fair catch kick attempts were made within the last 30 seconds of either the 2nd or 4th quarter. The last attempt was made on December 19, 2024, by Cameron Dicker of the Los Angeles Chargers. At 57 yards, it is the longest successful kick to date.",

                "title": "WATCH: Chargers utilize obscure NFL rule to hit league's first fair-catch kick field goal since 1976 - CBSSports.com",
                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. The game between the Chargers and Broncos got a little confusing toward the end of the first half on Thursday night when Los Angeles decided to take advantage of an obscure NFL rule known as the fair-catch kick. With eight seconds left to play in the first half, the Broncos were facing a fourth-and-12 from their own 16-yard line, which was an obvious punting situation for Denver. Chargers returner Derius Davis called for a fair catch on the play, and that's where the rarely used fair-catch kick came in. Basically, the rule goes like this: If a team fair catches a punt, they're allowed to attempt a free kick on the next play. The kick isn't a typical field goal, either. The defense has to line up 10 yards off the ball -- similar to a kickoff -- and the defense is NOT allowed to try and block the kick. The \"free kick\" is more like a kickoff, except the kicker has to attempt the field goal off the ground and there's also a holder (The kicker also has the option to dropkick the ball, but that almost never happens). Here's how the NFL describes the rule: \"After a fair catch, the receiving team has the option to put the ball in play by a snap or a fair-catch kick (field goal attempt), with fair-catch kick lines established ten yards apart. All general rules apply as for a field goal attempt from scrimmage. The clock starts when the ball is kicked. (No tee permitted.)\" Now that you know how the rule works, let's get back to the game. Davis actually called for a fair catch from his own 38-yard line, but the Broncos were called for fair-catch interference on the play, which is a 15-yard penalty. That moved the ball to Denver's 47-yard line, and under the fair-catch kick rule, that meant the Cameron Dicker got to attempt a field goal from that exact spot. Dicker nailed the kick, which made him the first player since Ray Wersching in 1976 to make a fair-catch kick. Cameron Dicker makes the first free kick field goal since 1976! 🤯#TNFonPrime pic.twitter.com/sSwcJL5Gt9 Dicker's field goal cut Denver's lead to 21-13 at the half. Wersching was also playing for the Chargers when he hit his free kick, which means the only two fair-catch kicks the NFL has seen since 1970 have been converted by the Chargers, who went on to win 34-27. Although the team calling for the fair catch can take advantage of the free kick rule at any point during a game, it really only makes sense at the end of a half. If the Chargers had called for this fair catch with 20 seconds left in the half, they likely would have run a play or two to try and get the ball closer for a field goal attempt. Remember, the free kick is only an option on the very next play after a fair catch. The fair-catch kick rule is very rarely used in the NFL. The last player to attempt a fair catch field goal before Thursday night was Joey Slye, who missed a 60-yard attempt in 2019. Before Slye came along, Phil Dawson also attempted one for the 49ers in 2013, which is mostly notable because his coach at the time was Jim Harbaugh, which means he's now been on the sideline as the head coach for two fair-catch kicks. Dicker's field goal attempt was actually only the sixth fair-catch kick attempted in the NFL over the past 30 years, but everyone had missed their kick before Dicker came along. Dicker's kick was also just the fourth fair-catch kick out of 20 to be converted in the Super Bowl era. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

                "content": "The Los Angeles Chargers just did something that hasn't been done in an NFL game since 1976: successfully executed a fair catch kick. But what is a fair-catch kick? According to the NFL rules, if a player makes a fair catch, his team may attempt a kick from the spot rather than begin its next possession. If the kick goes through the goalposts on the scoring end of the field, it's worth three points — as many as a field goal. On a fair-catch kick, the ball does not have to be snapped, and the kicker can have a bigger running start before kicking the ball. Essentially, it's just like a kickoff attempt but with a holder instead of a tee. Dicker attempted the 57-yard fair-catch kick after the Denver Broncos' punt coverage team was flagged for fair catch interference at the end of the first half of Thursday night's game. Chargers head coach Jim Harbaugh elected to attempt the kick on an untimed down since the Broncos would not be allowed to return it on a potential miss. Here's the exact wording of the NFL's rule on fair catches, from Rule 10, Section 2, Article 4: All things Chargers: Latest Los Angeles Chargers news, schedule, roster, stats, injury updates and more. \"After a fair catch is made or is awarded as the result of fair catch interference, the receiving team has the option of putting the ball in play by a snap or fair catch kick (drop kick or place kick without a tee) from the spot of the catch or succeeding spot after enforcement of any applicable penalties (3-9 and 11-4-3). This includes the 15-yard penalty enforced from the receiving team’s 20-yard line as applicable if the fair catch is made or awarded in his end zone from fair catch interference or illegal contact with the receiver after he has made a fair catch.\" Also according to the rulebook, the fair-catch kick is technically distinct from a free kick. The NFL only considers kickoffs, safety kicks or onside kicks to be free kicks and specifically states that a fair-catch kick \"is not a free kick.\" There's also this from Rule 10, Section 2, Article 5: \"If time expires during a play in which a player has signaled for a fair catch, the following shall apply: ...If the kicking team interferes with a receiver who has signaled for a fair catch, the receiving team will have the option to extend the period by attempting a fair catch kick or by a snap from scrimmage after enforcement of any applicable penalties.\" Dicker's kick was the first fair-catch kick attempted since Joey Slye did it with the Carolina Panthers against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2019. It was the first to score points since 1976, when Ray Wersching of the then-San Diego Chargers knocked one through from 45 yards out at the end of the first half against the Buffalo Bills. At 65 yards, Dicker's fair-catch kick was the longest successful attempt in NFL history.",

He has been nominated for a Grammy Award (winning once) as a producer, arranger and performer a total of fifteen times (and in every decade) from 1973 to 2015.[5] He has also produced Grammy-nominated albums for Bette Midler, Dionne Warwick, Nancy Wilson, and Sarah Vaughan.[6] Manilow has sold more than 85 million records as a solo artist worldwide, making him one of the world's bestselling artists.[7][8][9] Barry Manilow was born Barry Alan Pincus on June 17, 1943, in Brooklyn, New York,[10] the son of Edna Manilow and Harold Kelliher, a truck driver of Irish descent. Barry's mother made his father change his name to Pincus, which was the name of a Jewish uncle of his father from the 1800s.[11][12][13] Barry's parents were divorced when he was a baby, and his mother's Jewish family allowed no further contact between Barry and his father.[13] Barry's maternal grandparents were Russian Jewish immigrants, and his paternal grandfather was Jewish, though his grandmother was a Catholic of Irish descent.[14] His Irish roots trace back to Limerick, Ireland.[15] Barry's grandfather had his surname changed to Manilow a few weeks before Barry's bar mitzvah.[13] Manilow grew up in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn and graduated in 1961 from the now-defunct Eastern District High School.[16] While in high school, he met Susan Deixler, and they later married for a short time.[17] He enrolled in the City College of New York, where he briefly studied before entering the New York College of Music.[18] He also worked at CBS while he was a student to pay his expenses. Afterwards, he studied musical theater at Juilliard Performing Arts School.[18] In 1964, Manilow met Bro Herrod, a CBS director, who asked him to arrange some songs for a musical adaptation of the melodrama, The Drunkard.[19] Instead, Manilow wrote an entire original score.[20][21] Herrod used Manilow's composition in the Off Broadway musical, which had an eight-year run at New York's 13th Street Repertory Theatre.[22] During this time, Manilow began work as a commercial jingle writer and singer, which continued through the remainder of the 1960s.[23] He performed many of the TV jingles that he composed, including State Farm Insurance (\"Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there\") or Band-Aid (\"I am stuck on Band-Aid, 'cause Band-Aid's stuck on me!\"), for which he adopted a childlike voice and wrote the music (Donald B Wood wrote the lyrics).[24] His singing-only credits include commercials for Kentucky Fried Chicken, Pepsi (\"all across the nation, it's the Pepsi Generation\"), McDonald's (\"you deserve a break today\"),[25] and Dr Pepper.[26] Manilow was awarded an Honorary Clio at the 50th Anniversary Clio Awards in Las Vegas in 2009 for his 1960s work as a jingle writer and singer. When accepting the award, he stated that he learned the most about making pop music by working for three or four years as a writer in the jingle industry.[27] By 1967, Manilow was the musical director for the WCBS-TV series Callback, which premiered on January 27, 1968.[28] He next conducted and arranged for Ed Sullivan's production company, arranging a new theme for The Late Show, while writing, producing, and singing his radio and television jingles.[29] At the same time, he and Jeanne Lucas performed as a duo for a two-season run at Julius Monk's Upstairs at the Downstairs club in New York.[30][31] By 1969, Manilow was signed by Columbia/CBS Music vice-president and recording artist, Tony Orlando, who went on to co-write with and produce Manilow and a group of studio musicians under the name \"Featherbed\" on the Columbia Pictures' newly acquired Bell Records label.\"[28][32][33][34] Manilow recorded and accompanied artists on the piano for auditions and performances in the first two years of the 1970s. He recorded four tracks as Featherbed, produced by Tony Orlando on Bell Records. Three of the tracks were: \"Morning\", a ballad; \"Amy\", a psychedelic-influenced pop song; and an early, uptempo version of his own co-composition (with Orlando), \"Could It Be Magic\".[28][33][34] The fourth tune recorded was \"Rosalie Rosie\", which was to be the flip side of \"Could It Be Magic\", but Bell Records went with \"Morning\" as the flip for Featherbed's second release instead. Neither of two singles released impacted on the charts.[28] Bette Midler saw Manilow's act in 1971 and chose the young musician as her pianist at the Continental Baths in New York City that year,[35] and subsequently as a producer on both her debut and second record albums The Divine Miss M (1972) and Bette Midler (1973).[36] He also acted as her musical director on the tour mounted for her first album.[37] In 1973, Manilow was nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year for his production role on The Divine Miss M at the 16th Grammy Awards.[38] Manilow worked with Midler from 1971 to 1975.[39] After the Featherbed singles failed to impact on the music charts, in July 1973, Bell Records released the album, Barry Manilow, which offered an eclectic mix of piano-driven pop and guitar-driven rock music, including a song called \"I Am Your Child\", which Manilow had composed with Marty Panzer.[40][41] Among other songs on the album were Jon Hendricks' vocalese jazz standard \"Cloudburst\", most successfully recorded by his group Lambert, Hendricks and Ross in 1959, and a slower-tempo version of \"Could It Be Magic\". The latter's music was based on Chopin's \"Prelude in C Minor\" and provided Donna Summer with one of her first hits. It was also covered by Take That in the 1990s, as an up-beat disco version of the song. Take That have since performed Manilow's original version during their Beautiful World Tour.[citation needed] In 1974, Clive Davis became temporary president of Bell with the goal of revitalizing Columbia Pictures's music division. With a $10 million investment by CPI, and a reorganization of the various Columbia Pictures legacy labels (Colpix, Colgems, and Bell), Davis introduced Columbia Pictures' new record division, Arista,[42] in November 1974, with Davis himself owning 20% of the new venture. Bell had its final number 1 hit in January 1975 with Manilow's breakthrough 1974 release of the single \"Mandy\" (Bell 45,613), followed shortly by the label's final hit, as well as its final single, \"Look in My Eyes Pretty Woman\" by Tony Orlando and Dawn (Bell 45,620—US #11), after which the more successful Bell albums were reissued on Arista. The final releases using the Bell imprint have the designation \"Bell Records, Distributed by Arista Records, 1776 Broadway, New York, New York 10019\" around the rim of the label.[citation needed] Davis' reorganization efforts continued to bear fruit in 1974, with the release of Manilow's second album, Barry Manilow II, with \"Mandy\" as the lead single. Manilow had not wanted to record the song, which had originally been titled \"Brandy\" when originally recorded by its co-writer Scott English, but the song was included at the insistence of Davis. The title was changed to \"Mandy\" during the actual recording session on August 20, 1974, due to the fact that there had already been a song called \"Brandy (You're a Fine Girl)\" performed by Looking Glass and released in 1972 on Davis' Epic label.[citation needed] \"Mandy\" was the start of a string of hit singles and albums that lasted through the early 1980s, coming from the multi-platinum and multi-hit albums Tryin' to Get the Feeling, This One's for You, Even Now, and One Voice. Following the success of Barry Manilow II, the first Bell Records album was remixed and reissued on Arista Records as Barry Manilow I. When Manilow went on his first tour, he included in his show what he called \"A V.S.M.\", or \"A Very Strange Medley\", a sampling of some of the commercial jingles that he had written, composed, and/or sung in the 1960s. The medley appeared later on his triple-platinum 1977 album Barry Manilow Live.[43] Beginning with Manilow's March 22, 1975, appearance on American Bandstand to promote the second album, a productive friendship with Dick Clark started.[44] Among their projects together were numerous appearances by Manilow on Clark's productions of Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve, singing his original seasonal favorite \"It's Just Another New Year's Eve\", American Bandstand anniversary shows, American Music Awards performances, and the 1985 television movie Copacabana, starring Manilow and executive produced by Clark.[45] Despite being a songwriter in his own right, several of Manilow's commercial successes were songs written by others. In addition to \"Mandy\", other hits that he did not write or compose include \"Tryin' to Get the Feeling Again\" (by David Pomeranz), \"Weekend in New England\" (by Randy Edelman), \"Ships\" (by Ian Hunter), \"Looks Like We Made It\" (by Richard Kerr and Will Jennings), \"Can't Smile Without You\" and \"Ready to Take a Chance Again\" (by Charles Fox and Norman Gimbel). His number 1 hit \"I Write the Songs\" was composed by Bruce Johnston of The Beach Boys. According to album liner notes, Manilow did, however, perform co-production as well as arrangement duties on all the above tracks along with Ron Dante, most famous for his vocals on records by The Archies.[citation needed] Manilow's breakthrough in Britain came with the release of Even Now, the first of many top-20 albums on that side of the Atlantic, which contained four singles that became major hits in the US. This was quickly followed by Manilow Magic – The Best Of Barry Manilow, also known as Greatest Hits. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, ABC aired four variety television specials starring Manilow, who served as an executive producer. The Barry Manilow Special with Penny Marshall as his guest premiered on March 2, 1977, to an audience of 37 million. The special was nominated for four Emmys at the 29th Primetime Emmy Awards and won in the category of Outstanding Special–Comedy, Variety or Music.[46] The Second Barry Manilow Special in 1978, with Ray Charles as his guest, was also nominated for four Emmys at the 30th Primetime Emmy Awards.[46] Manilow's \"Ready to Take a Chance Again\" originated in the film Foul Play, which also featured \"Copacabana\", from his fourth studio album Even Now. \"Ready to Take a Chance Again\" and its songwriters Charles Fox and Norman Gimbel were nominated that year for the \"Best Original Song\" Oscar at the 51st Academy Awards.[47] On February 11, 1979, a concert from Manilow's sold-out dates from his Even Now Tour at the Greek Theater in Los Angeles aired on the HBO series Standing Room Only, which was the first pay-television show to pose a serious threat to network primetime specials for ratings.[48] From the same tour in 1978, a one-hour special from Manilow's sold-out concert at the Royal Albert Hall aired in the UK.[citation needed] On May 23, 1979, ABC aired The Third Barry Manilow Special, with John Denver as his guest. This special was nominated for two Emmy awards at the 31st Primetime Emmy Awards and won for Outstanding Choreography.[46] Also in 1979, Manilow produced Dionne Warwick's \"comeback\" album Dionne, her first to go platinum. He scored a top ten hit of his own, in the fall of 1979, with the song \"Ships\" (written and composed by Ian Hunter, former lead singer of Mott the Hoople) from the album One Voice.[citation needed] During the 1980s, Manilow topped the Adult Contemporary radio charts with songs such as \"The Old Songs\", \"Somewhere Down the Road\", \"Read 'Em and Weep\" (written by Jim Steinman), and a remake of the 1941 Jule Styne and Frank Loesser standard \"I Don't Want to Walk Without You\". Manilow's songs continued to receive frequent radio airplay throughout the decade. In the UK, Manilow performed five sold-out concerts at the Royal Albert Hall. In the United States, at Radio City Music Hall, his 1984 ten-night run set a box-office sales record of nearly $2 million, making him the top draw in the 52-year history of the venue.[49] In 1980, Manilow's One Voice special, with Dionne Warwick as his guest, was nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Music Direction at the 32nd Primetime Emmy Awards.[46] Also in 1980, a concert from Manilow's sold-out shows at London England's Wembley Arena was broadcast while he was on a world tour. Manilow released the self-titled Barry (1980), which was his first album to not reach the top ten in the United States, stopping at number 15. The album contained the top 10 hits \"I Made It Through the Rain\" (originally a minor hit for its writer, Gerard Kenny) and \"Bermuda Triangle\". The album If I Should Love Again followed in 1981, with two top 40 recordings that both hit number 1 on the AC chart – \"The Old Songs\" and \"Somewhere Down The Road\" and a third single that became a hit in the UK – a cover of the 1965 The Four Seasons smash \"Let's Hang On!\". This was the first of his albums that Manilow produced without Ron Dante, who had co-produced all the previous albums. Manilow's sold-out concert at the Pittsburgh Civic Arena in Pittsburgh aired nationally on Showtime and locally on Philadelphia's now-defunct PRISM. In 1982, a concert from his sold-out Royal Albert Hall show was broadcast in England. The live album and video Barry Live in Britain also came from his Royal Albert Hall shows.[citation needed] On August 27, 1983, Manilow performed a landmark open-air concert at Blenheim Palace in Britain, an event that he told the audience was \"one of the most exciting nights\" in his life.[50] It was the first such event ever held at that venue and was attended by an estimated 40,000 people. This concert was also taped for airing on Showtime. In December 1983, Manilow was reported to have endowed the music departments at six major universities in the United States and Canada.[51] The endowments were part of a continuing endeavor by Manilow to recognize and encourage new musical talent.[52] In 1984, Manilow released 2:00 AM Paradise Cafe, a jazz/blues collection of original barroom tunes recorded in one live take in the studio. That same year, Showtime aired a documentary of Manilow recording the album with a number of jazz legends including Sarah Vaughan and Mel Tormé. In 1984 and 1985, England aired two one-hour concert specials from his National Exhibition Centre (NEC) concerts. In 1985, Manilow left Arista Records for RCA Records, where he released the pop album Manilow, and began a phase of international music, as he performed songs and duets in French, Spanish, Portuguese, and Japanese. The Manilow album was a complete about-face from the Paradise Cafe album, containing a number of uptempo tracks that featured synthesizers. In 1985, Japan aired a Manilow concert special where he played \"Sakura\" on the koto.[citation needed] In his only lead acting role, he portrayed Tony Starr in the 1985 CBS film Copacabana, which was based on his 1978 hit song \"Copacabana\", alongside Annette O'Toole as Lola Lamarr and Joseph Bologna as Rico Castelli. Manilow penned all the songs for the movie, with lyrics provided by his longtime collaborators Bruce Sussman and Jack Feldman. A soundtrack album for the TV film, Copacabana: The Original Motion Picture Soundtrack Album, was released on RCA Records.[citation needed] In October 1986, Manilow, along with Bruce Sussman, Tom Scott, and Charlie Fox, went to Washington, D.C. for two days of meetings with legislators, including lunch with then Senator Al Gore (D-TN).[53] They were there to lobby against a copyright bill put forward by local television broadcasters that would mandate songwriter-producer source licensing of theme and incidental music on syndicated television show reruns and would disallow the use of the blanket license then in effect. The songwriters said without the blanket license, artists would have to negotiate up front with producers individually, without knowing if a series would be a success. The license now pays according to a per-use formula. Manilow said that such a bill would act as a precedent for broadcasters to get rid of the blanket license entirely.[54] The following year, McGraw-Hill published Manilow's autobiography, Sweet Life: Adventures on the Way to Paradise, which took three years to complete. While promoting the work, Manilow defended his music in a telephone interview: \"I live in laid-back L.A., but in my heart, I'm an energetic New Yorker and that's what has always come out of my music. I've always been surprised when the critics said I made wimpy little ballads.\"[55] Manilow returned to Arista Records in 1987 with the release of Swing Street. The album, a mixture of traditional after-dark and techno jazz, contained \"Brooklyn Blues\", an autobiographical song for Manilow, and \"Hey Mambo\", an uptempo Latin style duet with Kid Creole, produced with the help of Emilio Estefan, Jr., founder of Miami Sound Machine.[citation needed] CBS aired Manilow's Big Fun on Swing Street special in March 1988. It featured songs and special guests from his Swing Street and 2:00 am Paradise Cafe albums, including Kid Creole and the Coconuts, Phyllis Hyman, Stanley Clarke, Carmen McRae, Tom Scott, and Uncle Festive, a band within Manilow's band at the time. The special was nominated for two Emmys in technical categories, and won in the category of Outstanding Art Direction for a Variety or Music Program at the 40th Primetime Emmy Awards.[46] In 1988, Manilow performed \"Please Don't Be Scared\" and \"Mandy/Could It Be Magic\" at That's What Friends Are For: AIDS Concert '88, a benefit concert for the Warwick Foundation headed by Dionne Warwick and shown on Showtime a few years later. In the 1988 Walt Disney Pictures animated feature Oliver & Company, Bette Midler's character sang a new Manilow composition called \"Perfect Isn't Easy\". The 1989 release of Barry Manilow, which contained \"Please Don't Be Scared\", \"Keep Each Other Warm\", and \"The One That Got Away\", ended Manilow's streak of albums of original self-written material (he only wrote or arranged two of the album's songs) and began a phase of his recording career consisting of covers and compilations.[citation needed] From April 18 to June 10, 1989, Manilow put on a show called Barry Manilow at the Gershwin, making 44 appearances[56] at the Gershwin Theatre (also known as the Uris Theatre), where he had also recorded Barry Manilow Live in 1976. A bestselling 90-minute video of the same show was released the following year as Barry Manilow Live on Broadway. The Showtime one-hour special Barry Manilow SRO on Broadway consisted of edited highlights from this video. Manilow followed this set of shows with a world tour of the Broadway show.[citation needed] Manilow released a number of cover tunes during the 1990s, starting with tracks on the 1989 release Barry Manilow, and continuing with his 1990 Christmas LP Because It's Christmas. On the Christmas album, Manilow was joined by pop girl trio Exposé and together they recreated, note for note, a 1943 million-selling recording of \"Jingle Bells\" by Bing Crosby and The Andrews Sisters. Manilow has credited Patty, Maxene, and LaVerne Andrews as inspiring him, perhaps most evident in his recording of \"Jump, Shout Boogie\".[57] Consequent \"event\" albums followed, including: Showstoppers, a collection of Broadway songs (1991),[58] Singin' with the Big Bands (1994) and a late 1970s collection Summer of '78 (1996), which included the hit \"I Go Crazy\", formerly a hit for Paul Davis in 1978. The decade ended with Manilow recording a tribute to Frank Sinatra Manilow Sings Sinatra (1998) released months after Sinatra's death.[59] In 1990, Japan aired National Eolia Special: Barry Manilow On Broadway where he sang the title song \"Eolia\", which was used as a song there in a commercial for an air conditioner company of the same name, as well as other songs from his 1989–1990 Live on Broadway tour. In the early 1990s, Manilow signed on with Don Bluth to compose the songs with lyricists Jack Feldman and Bruce Sussman for three animated films. He co-wrote the Broadway-style musical scores for Thumbelina (1994) and The Pebble and the Penguin (1995). The third film, entitled Rapunzel, was shelved after the poor performance of The Pebble and the Penguin. Manilow was also to be cast as the voice of a cricket. Manilow also composed the score and wrote two songs with Bruce Sussman for Disney Sing Along Songs: Let's Go To The Circus.[citation needed] Manilow produced the 1991 album With My Lover Beside Me by legendary jazz vocalist Nancy Wilson.[58] The record is based on lyrics left behind by famed composer Johnny Mercer that had never been set to music. Manilow was invited in 1993 by Mercer's widow to complete the songs. His own recording of \"When October Goes\", with lyrics by Mercer, was released as a single in 1984, from his album 2:00 AM Paradise Cafe.[58] Further Mercer compositions were set to music by Manilow over the following years, culminating in the 1991 Nancy Wilson release. Manilow is featured in a duet on the record in the final cut \"Epilogue\".[citation needed] On February 19, 1992, Manilow testified before the Subcommittee on Intellectual Property and Judicial Administration House Committee in support of H.R. 3204, The Audio Home Recording Act of 1991.[60] The bill was signed into law on October 28, 1992, by President George H. W. Bush and became effective immediately. In 1993, PBS aired Barry Manilow: The Best of Me, which was taped at Wembley Arena in England earlier that year. The BBC also played a one-hour version of the same show including \"The Best of Me\", sung during the concert, as a bonus song or \"lucky strike extra\" as Manilow says, not seen in The Complete Collection and Then Some..., the video release of the show; however, the song was included on the DVD of the same title, with Manilow seated in front of a black curtain, lip-syncing to the recording. He performed 14 concerts as part of an extended tour covering Germany, Austria and Denmark. Manilow branched out in another direction and, with long-time lyricist Bruce Sussman, launched Copacabana, a musical play based on previous Manilow-related adaptations. They wrote new songs and it ran for two years on the London West End, and a tour company formed.[61] In December 1996, A&E aired Barry Manilow: Live By Request, the first of his two Live By Request appearances. The broadcast was A&E's most successful music program, attracting an estimated 2.4 million viewers. The show was also simulcast on the radio. In March 1997, VH-1 aired Barry Manilow: The Summer of '78, a one-hour special of Manilow solo at the piano being interviewed and playing his greatest hits as well as songs from Summer of '78, his latest release at the time. In another collaboration between Manilow and Sussman, they co-wrote the musical Harmony: A New Musical, which previewed October 7 to November 23, 1997, at the La Jolla Playhouse in La Jolla, California.[62] Later in 2003, Harmony was originally scheduled for a tryout run in Philadelphia before going to Broadway, but was canceled after financial difficulties. After a legal battle with Mark Schwartz, the show's producer, Manilow and Sussman in 2005 won back the rights to the musical.[63] In 1998, Manilow released the record album Manilow Sings Sinatra which earned him a Grammy nomination for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album at the 42nd Annual Grammy Awards in 1999.[38] On October 23, 1999, NBC aired the two-hour special StarSkates Salute to Barry Manilow taped at the Mandalay Bay Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada, featuring numerous figure skaters performing to Manilow's music. Manilow also performed.[citation needed] In 2000, Manilow had two specials, Manilow Country and Manilow Live!, taped over two consecutive days at the Tennessee Performing Arts Center in Nashville, Tennessee. On April 11, 2000, The Nashville Network (TNN) aired the two-hour Manilow Country, which featured country stars Trisha Yearwood, Neal McCoy, Deana Carter, Jo Dee Messina, Lorrie Morgan, Kevin Sharp, Lila McCann, Gillian Welch and Jaci Velasquez singing their favorite Manilow hits with a \"country\" twist; Manilow also performed. This special was TNN's first High Definition (HD) broadcast and became one of TNN's highest rated concert specials.[citation needed] In June 2000, DirectTV aired the two-hour concert special Manilow Live! where Manilow had his band, a 30-piece orchestra, and a choir. This HDTV special documented the concert tour at the time with the greatest hits of his career and was also released to video. Also that year, he worked with Monica Mancini on her Concord album The Dreams of Johnny Mercer, which included seven songs of Mercer's lyrics set to Manilow's music. Meanwhile, Manilow's record contract with Arista Records was not renewed due to new management. He then got a contract at Concord Records, a jazz-oriented label in California, and started work on the long-anticipated concept album Here at the Mayflower. The album was another eclectic mix of styles, almost entirely composed and produced by Manilow himself. While Manilow was at Concord Records, the Barry Manilow Scholarship was awarded for four consecutive years (2002–2005) to the six highest-achieving students to reward excellence in the art and craft of lyric writing. The UCLA Extension course \"Writing Lyrics That Succeed and Endure\" was taught by long-time Manilow collaborator Marty Panzer, and each student received three additional \"master class\" advanced sessions as well as a three-hour private, one-on-one session with Panzer. Scholarship recipients were selected by the instructor based on progress made within the course, lyric writing ability, and the instructor's assessment of real potential in the field of songwriting.[64] In February 2002, Manilow returned to the charts when Arista released a greatest hits album, Ultimate Manilow. On May 18, 2002, Manilow returned to CBS with Ultimate Manilow, his first special on the network since his Big Fun on Swing Street special in 1988. The special was filmed in the Kodak Theatre in Hollywood, California, and was nominated for an Emmy in the category of Outstanding Music Direction at the 54th Primetime Emmy Awards.[46] Produced by Manilow, Bette Midler Sings the Rosemary Clooney Songbook was released on September 30, 2003. It was the first time that the pair had worked together in more than twenty years. The album went gold, and they collaborated again in 2005 on Bette Midler Sings the Peggy Lee Songbook. On December 3, 2003, A&E aired A Barry Manilow Christmas: Live by Request, his second of two concerts for the series. The two-hour special had Manilow taking requests for Christmas songs performed live with a band and an orchestra. Manilow told the audience that he was what Clay Aiken was going to look like in thirty years, thus acknowledging an ongoing comparison between the two. Also on the special were guests Cyndi Lauper, José Feliciano, and Bette Midler (Midler, busy preparing her own tour in Los Angeles, appeared only in a pre-taped segment).[citation needed] In 2004, Manilow released two albums: a live album, 2 Nights Live! (BMG Strategic Marketing Group, 2004); and Scores: Songs from Copacabana & Harmony, an album of Manilow singing songs from his musicals. Scores was the last of Manilow's creative projects with the Concord label.[citation needed] During his third appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show on September 15, 2004, Winfrey announced that Manilow is one of the most requested guests of all time on her show. On the show, he promoted his One Night Live! One Last Time! tour. It was around this time period where Manilow appeared for the first time on the mainstream FOX program American Idol in which his back-up singer, Debra Byrd, doubles as voice coach on the series. Manilow also appeared on Clay Aiken's TV special, A Clay Aiken Christmas.[citation needed] Las Vegas Hilton executives in a press conference with Manilow on December 14, 2004, announced his signing to a long-term engagement as the house show.[65] He began the residency in February 2005 with a show entitled Manilow: Music and Passion.[66] In March 2006, Manilow's engagement was extended through 2008.[66] Manilow returned to Arista Records under Davis for a new covers album, released January 31, 2006, called The Greatest Songs of the Fifties. Manilow said he was blown away with the idea, which Davis presented when he visited Manilow's Las Vegas show. \"When he suggested this idea to me, I slapped my forehead and said, 'Why hasn't anyone thought of this idea?'\" Manilow said.[67] It was an unexpected success, debuting at number one in the Billboard 200, marking the first time a Manilow album debuted at the top of the album chart as well as the first time a Manilow album has reached number one in 29 years. It was eventually certified Platinum in the U.S., and sold more than 3 million copies worldwide.[citation needed] In March 2006, PBS aired Barry Manilow: Music and Passion, a Hilton concert recorded exclusively for the network's fundraising drive. Manilow was nominated for two Emmys, winning for Outstanding Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program at the 58th Primetime Emmy Awards. A sequel album to his bestselling fifties tribute album, The Greatest Songs of the Sixties was released on October 31, 2006, including songs such as \"And I Love Her\" and \"Can't Help Falling in Love\". It nearly repeated the success of its predecessor, debuting at number 2 in the Billboard 200.[citation needed] In January 2007, Manilow returned to his hometown of New York City for three shows at Madison Square Garden. These included showing onscreen Manilow performing in one of his first television appearances, while the \"live\" Manilow played along onstage. The same year saw him playing several shows on the east coast of the United States in August. Four more took place in December, half in the New York tri-state area in Uniondale and East Rutherford, and two in Cleveland and Detroit. Manilow launched another short tour in early 2008, visiting several large venues including the Xcel Energy Center in St. Paul, Minnesota. A further album in the decades themed series, The Greatest Songs of the Seventies, went on release September 18, 2007. Barry Manilow: Songs from the Seventies, a PBS concert special based on the work, was taped in Manilow's home town, Brooklyn, in October 2007. The show aired on PBS in December 2007 and was rebroadcast over New Year 2009. He appeared on American Idol on February 3, 2009, during Hollywood Week to give advice to the contestants.[citation needed] Manilow released his third Christmas album in November 2007, In the Swing of Christmas, which went Gold and earned him another Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album Grammy Award nomination at the 51st Grammy Awards in 2008.[68][69] In December 2008, Manilow narrated the animated Christmas special Cranberry Christmas, which was broadcast on ABC Family and sponsored by Ocean Spray. In addition to narrating, he also contributed two original songs that he composed with his long time collaborator, lyricist Bruce Sussman: \"Christmas Is Just Around the Corner\" and \"Watch Out for Mr. Grape\". \"Christmas Is Just Around the Corner\" was also released as a single, and appeared as a bonus track on the 2009 re-release of In the Swing of Christmas.[70] In October 2009, Manilow TV, a monthly video subscription service, launched. Once a month, Barry Manilow picks a different concert from his personal archive to show to subscribers. In the first month, the first episode showed performances on April 20–21, 1996, at Wembley Arena in London.[citation needed] Manilow ended his residency at the Hilton with a show entitled \"Ultimate Manilow: the Hits\" on December 30, 2009, after 300 performances for 450,000 fans.[66] On January 26, 2010, Manilow released The Greatest Love Songs of All Time, and, in December of that year, the album was nominated for a Grammy Award in the category of Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album at the 52nd Grammy Awards.[38] He opened his new show \"Manilow Paris Las Vegas\" at the Paris Hotel & Casino at Las Vegas in March 2010.[71] On December 11, 2010, Manilow performed at the Nobel Peace Prize Concert in Oslo, Norway.[72] Manilow completed work on his new album, 15 Minutes, in March 2011, with his official Facebook page announcing that he had completed putting \"finishing touches\" to the album on March 16, 2011.[25] On March 13, 2011, Manilow appeared at the 2011 Laurence Olivier Awards at London's Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, singing \"Copacabana\" with the BBC Concert Orchestra and also singing with hit West End star, Kerry Ellis.[73] Since March 2011, he has hosted They Write the Songs, a documentary series for BBC Radio 2 in which he looks at the life and work of popular composers.[74] In May 2011, Manilow recorded his concerts at the O2 Arena in London, for CD and DVD release in early 2012.[75] In a June 2011 interview with the Los Angeles Times, Manilow said that his new album is influenced by Britney Spears; the album is about the pleasures and pitfalls of fame. It was influenced directly by Spears' personal struggles in late 2007.[76] The album 15 Minutes debuted at number 7 on the U.S. Billboard 200 Album Chart. The first single from 15 Minutes, \"Bring on Tomorrow\", entered the U.S. Billboard Hot 200 Singles Chart's top 40, becoming Manilow's 47th top 40 hit.[citation needed] In November 2011, Manilow recorded his shows at the Paris Las Vegas for an upcoming TV special and DVD release.[citation needed] Manilow concluded his two-year residency at the Paris Hotel in Las Vegas on December 11, 2012. This also ended his seven-year stay in Las Vegas.[citation needed] In January 2013, Manilow returned to Broadway with his concert series \"Manilow on Broadway\". It was his first appearance on Broadway in more than two decades.[77] On July 4, 2013, Manilow performed live on the west lawn of the U.S. Capitol as part of A Capitol Fourth. This was his second appearance on the PBS program.[78] On September 6, 2013, Harmony: A New Musical started a second run. This time at Atlanta's Alliance Theatre. The musical then had performances in Los Angeles in 2014.[citation needed] On November 12, 2013, he performed at the BBC's Children in Need Rocks 2013.[79] On March 11, 2014, Manilow released Night Songs, an album of standards performed only with piano and synthesized acoustic bass by Manilow himself. It earned him a Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album Grammy nomination that year at the 57th Grammy Awards.[38] On October 28, 2014, Manilow released My Dream Duets, which won him his fourth Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album Grammy Award nomination at the 58th Annual Grammy Awards. This was the fifteenth Grammy Award nomination of his career with nominations occurring in every decade since the 1970s.[80][5] On February 11, 2015, Manilow began his One Last Time! tour at the CenturyLink Center Omaha in Omaha, Nebraska with stops at most major North American venues. Other destinations included Chicago at the United Center, Los Angeles at the Staples Center, and Brooklyn at the Barclay's Center for the tour finale on June 17, where Manilow celebrated his 72nd birthday during his Barclays Center debut.[81] In 2017, Billboard declared that Manilow has been on a Billboard 200 hot streak since 2002, when his greatest-hits collection Ultimate Manilow debuted and peaked at No. 3 (February 23, 2002), becoming his highest-charting set (and first top 10) since 1979's One Voice (No. 9). Since 2002, Manilow has logged a dozen top 40 efforts (including Ultimate). Further, he has notched at least one top 40 album in each of the five decades from the 1970s through the 2010s.[82] In 2019, it was announced that Manilow's original musical Harmony would make its New York debut at National Yiddish Theatre Folksbiene in the Museum of Jewish Heritage, running from February 11 until March 29, 2020.[83] The run was canceled due to the start of the COVID-19 health crisis and rescheduled for Spring of 2022.[84] On February 14, 2020, Manilow released Night Songs II, which debuted at No. 32 on the Billboard 200, marking his sixth consecutive decade of top 40-charting albums beginning with Barry Manilow II in 1975.[citation needed] In April 2020, Manilow scored his 36th top-20 Billboard Adult Contemporary chart hit with \"When the Good Times Come Again\" which peaked at number 12 on the week of July 2. The song was originally recorded for his self-titled 1989 album and never released as a single. A fan made a lyric video for the song when the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Manilow found the video and posted it on his Facebook page, leading his management company to send the song to radio stations for airplay.[85] In August 2020, Manilow sold his song catalog to Hipgnosis Songs Fund.[86] In 2021, Manilow started his The Hits Come Home residency at the Westgate Hotel in Las Vegas.[35] On December 11, 2023, NBC aired a Christmas special Barry Manilow's A Very Barry Christmas, featuring Manilow.[87][88] A fourteen-night residency at the London Palladium in May and June 2024 has been billed as the \"last, last UK concerts\".[89] Manilow married his high-school sweetheart, Susan Deixler, in 1964.[17] Manilow later stated that he was in love with his wife and that his passion for a music career, in addition to his lack of maturity, put a strain on their relationship. He left the woman he considered \"the perfect wife\" after just one year of marriage in pursuit of a \"wondrous musical adventure\". Manilow credits the response he received from Playboy in December 1965 for the courage to leave everything behind and begin a career in music: I asked a lot of people what I should do, and they all said different things. Finally, I was so desperate, I wrote to the Playboy Advisor.[90] Deixler had the marriage annulled in 1966.[91] After coming out as gay in 2017, Manilow stated that he had been in love with Deixler and the failure of his marriage at the time was not related to issues of sexual orientation.[17] Manilow began a relationship with TV executive Garry Kief, who soon became his manager, in 1978. The two married in 2014, after same-sex marriage became legal in California.[35] They kept the relationship and his sexual orientation private until the marriage made headlines in 2015. Manilow did not initially want his personal relationship with Kief to become public. The media began to publicize the event when a friend of Manilow's, Suzanne Somers, publicly disclosed the private exchange of vows at Manilow's home in Palm Springs, California. No official paperwork was filed, but it was reported that Manilow and Kief exchanged wedding bands as a sign of their dedication.[92][93] Manilow officially came out as gay in April 2017, telling People that he was pleasantly surprised to find that his mostly female fan base was supportive of the marriage; he had feared the news would disappoint them.[17][35][94][95] Manilow has a stepdaughter through his husband's previous marriage and an adopted granddaughter.[96] To help with the aftermath of Hurricane Hugo in 1989, which affected the Charleston, South Carolina, area, Manilow held a benefit concert November 12, 1989, at the University of South Carolina's Carolina Coliseum in Columbia where the $10 tickets sold out in three hours, and asked concertgoers to bring canned food to be donated to residents in disaster areas.[97] Before his concert, Mayor T. Patton Adams named that day Barry Manilow Day, and Manilow presented The Red Cross and The Salvation Army with checks of $42,500 each.[98] On January 15, 1994, three hours before showtime, Manilow canceled a performance at an Ethnic Pride and Heritage Festival hosted at the Convention Center in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Benefactors included the Children's Hospital of New Jersey in Newark, the Community Foundation of New Jersey as well as United Hospitals Medical Center Foundation and Newark Museum in Newark during the pre-inaugural activities for then New Jersey Governor-elect Christie Whitman. Manilow said that he was specifically told in writing that the concert would be part of a non-partisan event.[99] To help in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, for every U.S. dollar donated by his fans to the American Red Cross through the Manilow Fund for Health and Hope website, Manilow personally matched, and the fund itself also matched, tripling the original donation. The fund delivered $150,000, raised in 48 hours, to the American Red Cross.[100][101] On October 27, 2011, Manilow visited Joplin, Missouri, a little more than five months after a tornado destroyed one-third of that city, including its only high school. His Manilow Music Project made a contribution of $300,000 to restore the musical program and instruments that were lost.[102] On February 8, 1994, Manilow sued Los Angeles radio station KBIG (104.3 FM), seeking $13 million in damages and $15 million in punitive damages, claiming that one of their advertisements was causing irreparable damage to his professional reputation. The ad, a thirty-second spot which began airing on January 31, suggested that people listen to KBIG because it does not play Manilow's music. The lawsuit was filed in Orange County Superior Court by Los Angeles attorney C. Tucker Cheadle.[103] Two days later, KBIG/104.3 FM agreed to drop the commercial poking fun at the singer, but a lawyer representing his business interests stopped short of agreeing to withdraw a $28 million lawsuit.[104] Arizona Court of Appeals Judge Philip Espinosa sued Manilow over the audio volume of a December 23, 1993, concert he attended with his wife.[105] The judge said in the lawsuit he has had a constant ringing in his ears (tinnitus) and nearly blew his ears out. Espinosa sought unspecified damages, and the trial was set for September 23, 1997. The suit also named Manilow's production company, an Arizona concert promoter, and the city of Tucson, Arizona, which runs the convention center where the concert was held. In July 1997, to settle the suit it was reported that Manilow donated $5,000 to the American Tinnitus Association.[106] In 1979, Manilow's musical style was satirized in the song \"I Need Your Help Barry Manilow\" performed by Ray Stevens.[107] The song leads off with a musical phrase resembling the opening of \"I Write the Songs\" and also references \"Mandy\", \"Copacabana\", \"Can't Smile Without You\", \"Weekend in New England\", \"Could It Be Magic\" and \"Tryin' to Get the Feeling Again\" in a storyline where the singer details a litany of comedically unfortunate events in his life, reaching the conclusion that he needs Manilow to sing one of his more melancholy and wistful songs to comfort him, as several of Manilow's biggest hits have story lines about suffering and misfortune. The song reached number 49 on the US Billboard Hot 100 number 11 on the Adult Contemporary chart. It spent a total of eight weeks on Hot 100 chart and also charted in Great Britain, Canada, and Australia. The single's cover art is a spoof of Manilow's album Barry Manilow II, and the song's album spoofs title and cover art of Manilow's Tryin' to Get the Feeling. In 1989, an American tabloid claimed that Manilow was engaged to porn star Robin Byrd. On a June 22, 1989, appearance on The Tonight Show, Johnny Carson asked Manilow about the headline story.[108] Manilow replied that he was just friends with Byrd, an innocent picture had been taken, and that there was no truth to the supposed engagement. After he met Byrd, his band gave him a videotape of Debbie Does Dallas as a present for his birthday. Manilow told Carson that he could not watch his friend doing what she does in that movie.[109] Manilow made headlines in June 2006 when Australian officials blasted his music from 9:00 p.m. until midnight every Friday, Saturday, and Sunday to deter gangs of youths from congregating in a residential area late at night.[110] In February 2022, New Zealand authorities employed a similar tactic against protesters who camped outside the country's parliament building to protest COVID-19 vaccine mandates.[111]",

                "title": "Big Lots Closing Stores: See Full List of Locations - Newsweek",
                "content": "Ohio-based discount retailer Big Lots may have to close more stores, according to a recent filing in its Chapter 11 bankruptcy case, as reviewed by Newsweek. The potential for more store closures comes after a fifth notice was filed in bankruptcy court. Newsweek reached out Wednesday via email to Big Lots' press team for comment on Wednesday. On Monday, the fifth notice of store closures was filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, proposing the closure of more than a dozen Big Lots stores. The 19 new closures include five stores in California, three stores in Texas and Oregon, two in Florida and Nevada, and single stores in Georgia, Idaho, Arizona and Washington. The closures would affect Atlanta, San Antonio, Phoenix, Los Angeles, Las Vegas and Florida's Orlando, among other cities. Big Lots, referred to as \"the debtors,\" has until 4 p.m. ET on Saturday to file an objection to the proposed closures, according to the court document. If no objection is filed and there is no court intervention, Big Lots is authorized to commence the process of store closing sales for the 19 stores across the country. Before this announcement, Big Lots had announced the closure of nearly 500 stores. The Hill reports that at least 140 of those stores have already been closed, and many are set to close by January 2025. California will have the most stores closed, with 75 out of 109 set to be shuttered in the state. In August, when a big wave of store closures was announced, a Big Lots spokesperson told Newsweek the move is part of a broader strategy to stabilize the company financially. The company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission reveal that these closures come as Big Lots grapples with significant debt and declining sales. High inflation and stiff competition have dampened consumer spending at retail chains. On September 9, Big Lots filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. At the time, the company operated about 1,300 stores nationwide, but that number has been dropping significantly since the filing. The company reported a net loss of $205 million for the first quarter of 2024 and an increase in long-term debt to $573.8 million. In a September 9 press release, Big Lots said it entered into a sale agreement with an affiliate of Nexus Capital Management for approximately $760 million, consisting of $2.5 million in cash plus payoff of remaining debt and assumption of liabilities. The retailer was co-founded by Michael Cohen and Damian Giangiacomo in 2013. Mandy Taheri is a Newsweek reporter based in Brooklyn. She joined Newsweek as a reporter in 2024.

                "content": "Big Lots is closing five stores in California and an additional 14 stores nationwide as the company continues to navigate through Chapter 11 bankruptcy, court documents show. Big Lots announced in September that the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and planned on closing more than 340 stores. The closures are occurring due to affiliate Nexus Capital Management LP acquiring Big Lots as part of a sale agreement, the retailer said in a news release. \"Though most of our stores are profitable, and we are taking every step possible to improve the profitability of all our stores, we will need to close certain locations to ensure that our business operates efficiently and we can continue serving our customers,\" according to the retailer. In October, Big Lots closed 50 additional stores across the United States, including 15 in California. Although the stores are closing, the retailer filed motions in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware to continue paying and providing benefits to employees and sending payments to important vendors so it can continue to run the business. The sale to Nexus is expected to be final by the fourth quarter of 2024, and the agreement includes $707.5 million of financing, with $35 million coming from some of Big Lots' current lenders.

Goodbye, weird treasure trove of cheap stuff Most of us have enjoyed rambling around a Big Lots store at some time or another—but maybe we should have gone more often. Big Lots announces closures of many of its locations throughout the U.S. We were just shopping in one last night—the cashiers were so nice, and it was sad to think they are likely out of a job now. These stores were always like a treasure trove of unexpected items, everything from a plug-in fireplace and mantel to an interesting snack aisle to patio furnishings. The store stocks items from production overruns, discontinued products and more, which explains the interesting hodgepodge of inventory. Right now, the chain’s website doesn’t mention anything about store closures, but members have gotten emails stating their local store is closing. Driving past these locations, a big banner announces the closure as well. The company said that inflation and competition difficulties have made it hard to keep stores open, according to The Hill. Consumers just aren’t spending as much these days. Another chain that closed restaurants in May, Red Lobster, said that debt and a fiasco with an all-you-can-eat shrimp promotion caused the closure of almost 100 locations. According to The Hill, the company, in an SEC filing, has said that between 35 and 40 locations could be closing, but the number looks far bigger. For instance, 60 locations in California are tagged for closures, and 89 others in the U.S. have closure notices on their individual websites. In California, these stores will close, according to Fox40.com: Closures in other states include, according to The Hill: Good news for folks in Arkansas, Delaware, Idaho, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, West Virginia, or Wyoming—none of your stores are going to be closing, but you might want to do some shopping there to ensure that stays the case.

The Cardinals fought off a first set defeat and later multiple set points in the third set to outlast the Panthers. Pitt came out strong, taking the first set 25-21 behind the dominant play of Olivia Babcock, who finished with a match-high 33 kills. The Panthers’ offense was firing early, hitting .373 in the opening set. Louisville responded in a back-and-forth second set, rallying from an early deficit to win 25-23 and level the match. The third set saw Pitt surge ahead, but Louisville’s Anna DeBeer delivered a clutch block to tie it at 23-23. The Cardinals stayed composed, taking the set 29-27. DeBeer’s all-around play and defensive presence shifted momentum in Louisville’s favor. Louisville, which lost DeBeer to injury, remained in control in the fourth set to secure the match. With the win, Louisville advances to its second national title match in three years. The Cardinals will look to capture their first-ever championship after falling short in 2022.

                "content": "Andrew Ladd McConkey (born November 11, 2001) is an American professional football wide receiver for the Los Angeles Chargers of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Georgia Bulldogs, winning two national championships and the 2023 Wuerffel Trophy. He was selected by the Chargers in the second round of the 2024 NFL draft. McConkey attended North Murray High School in Chatsworth, Georgia.[1][2] He made the varsity team as a freshman. McConkey played quarterback, running back, defensive back, and punter and was also a return specialist.[3] In his senior year, he led North Murray to a 9–1 record and the school's first ever region championship.[4] McConkey finished the year with 36 total touchdowns and 3,051 total yards, being named the offensive player of the year for the region.[5] McConkey was a three-star recruit and committed to the University of Georgia, his only Power Five offer, on February 2, 2020.[6][7] His jersey number, 15, was retired by North Murray in 2023.[8] McConkey redshirted and was initially a member of Georgia's scout team.[9] In McConkey's redshirt freshman year, he caught five touchdowns with 28 receptions for 430 yards.[10] His first career touchdown came against Vanderbilt. McConkey also rushed for one touchdown. He was named the SEC Freshman of the Week after the 34-10 win over Auburn, where he received 135 yards and scored one touchdown.[11] McConkey played in all of Georgia's games making seven starts.[12] McConkey scored two touchdowns, one receiving, and one rushing, against Oregon in the 2022 season opener.[13] Against Kent State, McConkey recorded a career high six receptions.[14] He scored a touchdown against Florida before tallying a season-high 94 yards against #1 Tennessee.[15][16] The following week against Mississippi State, McConkey would rush for a 70-yard touchdown while also adding a 17-yard receiving touchdown.[17] He left the SEC Championship Game against LSU on December 3, 2022, due to knee tendinitis.[18] In the 2023 College Football Playoff National Championship Game, McConkey recorded five receptions for 88 yards and two touchdowns in a 65–7 victory.[19] Following the game, he announced that he would return to Georgia for the 2023 season.[20][21] The following season, McConkey missed significant time due to injuries.[22][23] He finished the regular season with 29 receptions for 456 yards and two touchdowns, and he was named the recipient of the Wuerffel Trophy.[24][25] On January 1, 2024, McConkey declared for the 2024 NFL draft.[26][27] McConkey graduated from Georgia in 2023 with a degree in finance.[28] McConkey was selected by the Los Angeles Chargers 34th overall with the pick acquired from a trade with New England Patriots.[32] On June 19, 2024, McConkey signed his four-year rookie contract with the Chargers worth $9.9 million guaranteed, with a $4 million signing bonus.[33] In his NFL debut, he scored a receiving touchdown in a 22–10 victory over the Las Vegas Raiders in Week 1.[34] A middle child, McConkey grew up a fan of the Tennessee Volunteers.[16][35] His father, Benji McConkey, was a star quarterback in high school at Dalton High,[36] while his brother, Hinton McConkey, played quarterback for the University of West Georgia in Division II in 2018.[37] McConkey writes \"1-20-16\" on his towel before games to honor his grandfather Vic McConkey, who died on that date.[38]",

                "title": "Chargers' 'small' Ladd McConkey always has been a big producer - Los Angeles Times",
                "content": "Preston Poag had the night planned. The high school football coach looked ahead at the Georgia Bulldogs’ schedule to see when Ladd McConkey had a free weekend. He convinced the wide receiver to skip out on a hunting trip. The occasion called for it: North Murray High was going to retire McConkey’s jersey. Poag nearly moved McConkey to tears, but two weeks later the receiver called his former coach and pleaded to not have his jersey retired. There are plenty of other great players who deserve the honor, McConkey said. “Shut the crap up and get your butt here,” Poag responded. Even as his star outgrows his small hometown in northern Georgia, McConkey has maintained his humble nature with the Chargers while the 22-year-old rookie leads the team with 30 catches for 376 yards and four touchdowns entering a road game against the Cleveland Browns (2-6) on Sunday at 10 a.m. PST. Sports NFL Week 9 picks: The Rams face NFC West rival Seahawks in Seattle and the Chargers also are on the road against the Browns, who now start Jameis Winston. After his 111-yard, two-touchdown effort against New Orleans — a game in which he became the first Chargers rookie since Keenan Allen in 2013 to have 100 yards receiving in a game — McConkey smiled shyly at the faintest whiff of praise. He simply was happy to get into the end zone and make plays for his team. His teammates were ready to sing his praises instead. “Beast,” safety Derwin James Jr. said. “Dog. Y’all seen him. … Ladd that guy.” As the Chargers (4-3) looked for replacements for longtime stars Allen and Mike Williams, McConkey quietly turned himself into one of quarterback Justin Herbert’s most sure-handed targets. A second-round selection who was the ninth receiver taken in last April’s draft, McConkey is third among rookie wide receivers in yards per game (53.7). If McConkey reaches the century mark Sunday, he would join Allen as the only Chargers rookies to record back-to-back 100-yard receiving games. Rewatching the film of McConkey’s plays against the Saints, coach Jim Harbaugh was struck by the way the receiver seemed to look one place and then catch the ball in another. It reminded him of former Carolina Panthers star Steve Smith Sr. “They have a subtle way of catching it,” said Harbaugh, who was the Panthers’ scout team quarterback when Smith was a rookie. “They catch it like just a couple feet away from where they’re looking. It’s pretty cool.” The receiver puts up big numbers by perfecting the smallest details. From the first days of training camp, Herbert noticed how precisely McConkey broke in and out of routes, how he positioned his body to prevent defenders from undercutting him and how he actively grabbed the ball when it came. With skills that are hard to teach, McConkey is what Herbert called “a friend to the quarterback.” Chargers Coach Jim Harbaugh sometimes shares expressions that have his Chargers raising eyebrows and seeking explanations, but his words of wisdom change perspectives. “He’s natural at it,” Herbert said. McConkey always has had “the it-factor,” Poag said. The former North Carolina State quarterback and pitcher coached him as early as 9 years old when McConkey, despite his small stature, was untouchable against even older opponents. He played receiver, running back, defensive back, punter and kick returner for North Murray, a school about 15 miles south of the Tennessee border. As a senior he led the Mountaineers to Georgia’s Class 3A quarterfinals for the first time as their starting quarterback. Still, major colleges were slow to believe McConkey could be a legitimate prospect. Coaches loved his film then side-eyed the slight build of a 5-foot-11, 165-pound receiver in person. Even after he got interest from Georgia, coaches from smaller schools doubted he would play for the Bulldogs, asking Poag what would happen when a big Southeastern Conference defender lined up against him. “They won’t touch him,” Poag said confidently. Chargers Chargers Bradley Bozeman and his wife have served communities for years, and the center’s move to defend his quarterback also helped to feed their foundation. McConkey helped Georgia to two national championships, catching five passes for 88 yards and two touchdowns in the Bulldogs’ blowout win of Texas Christian in the 2022 game in SoFi Stadium. Now catching the passes and scoring touchdowns in the same stadium, McConkey has made the transition to the NFL look seamless. He modestly shrugged at the suggestion, however, saying there are still “bad days that y’all don’t see.” He credited the coaches at Georgia for preparing him to face the rigors of the NFL. “I feel like coach [Kirby] Smart and everybody at Georgia kind of prepared me for this,” McConkey said. “We practiced hard at Georgia, we take game reps at practice, so now it’s just transitioning over here and continuing that, but taking it to another notch.” Chargers Everything you need to know about the Chargers facing the Cleveland Browns at Huntington Bank Field on Sunday, including start time, TV channel and betting odds. Haunted by some of the same minor injuries that interrupted his college career, McConkey has nursed a hip injury for the last three weeks as the Chargers have struggled to keep their receiver room intact. The team is hoping to get Quentin Johnston (ankle) back soon after a two-game absence. Signed as the veteran leader for the new-look group, free agent D.J. Chark Jr. went on injured reserve because of a hip injury that turned into a lingering groin injury. While he toiled in the training room to return to the field, Chark watched with pride as the Chargers’ young receivers experienced their first breakthrough moments. After McConkey’s signature moment, Chark can’t wait to get in on the fun. “I think the sky’s the limit for him,” Chark said.

                "title": "Doula - Wikipedia",
                "content": "A doula (/ˈduːlə/; from Ancient Greek δούλα 'female slave'; Greek pronunciation: [ˈðula]) is a non-medical professional who provides guidance for the service of others and who supports another person (the doula's client) through a significant health-related experience, such as childbirth, miscarriage, induced abortion or stillbirth, as well as non-reproductive experiences such as dying.[1][2][3][4] A doula might also provide support to the client's partner, family, and friends.[5][6] The doula's goal and role is to help the client feel safe and comfortable, complementing the role of the healthcare professionals who provide the client's medical care. Unlike a physician, midwife, or nurse, a doula cannot administer medication or other medical treatment or give medical advice.[7][2] An individual might need to complete training to work as a doula, although training and certification processes vary throughout the world.[7][3][4][8] Some doulas work as volunteers; others are paid for their services by their client, medical institutions, or other private and public organizations. Doulas receive varying amounts of training, and their professionalism also varies.[4][9] The contributions of doulas during reproductive experiences and end-of-life care have been studied and have been shown to benefit their clients.[4][10][11][12] For example, a birth doula providing support during childbirth might increase likelihood of vaginal birth (rather than Caesarean section), decrease the need for pain medication during labor, and improve the perception of the birthing experience.[13][14] The benefits of a doula providing other types of support have been less well studied, but might improve a client's experience with medical care or help an individual cope with health transitions.[15][16][4][17] The concept of having a companion providing support to the birthing woman dates back to prehistoric times, evidenced by archeological findings of stone carvings and statues and anthropological studies.[18] However, the contemporary role of \"doula\" first emerged from the grassroots natural birth movement in the United States in the 1960s when women began desiring unmedicated, low-intervention births and began to have friends and others with formal or practical knowledge about childbirth provide them with support during pregnancy.[19] The term doula was first used in a 1969 anthropological study conducted by Dana Raphael, a protégée of Margaret Mead, with whom she co-founded the Human Lactation Center in Westport, Connecticut, in the 1970s.[20] Raphael suggested it was a widespread practice that a female of the same species be part of childbirth, and in human societies this was traditionally a role occupied by a family member or friend whose presence contributed to successful long-term breastfeeding.[20] Raphael derived the term from modern Greek (δούλα, doúla (Greek pronunciation: [ˈðula]), \"slave\"[21]), as told to her by an elderly Greek woman,[22] Eleni Rassias,[23] and described it as coming from \"Aristotle's time,\" an Ancient Greek word δούλα meaning \"female slave.\"[24] Two physician-researchers, Marshall Klaus and John Kennell, who conducted clinical trials on the medical outcomes of doula-attended births, adopted the term to refer to a person providing labor support.[7] In 1992, Doulas of North America (later DONA International) was co-founded by Klaus, Kennell, Phyllis Klaus, Penny Simkin, and Annie Kennedy, becoming the first organization to train and certify doulas.[25][26] The organization with the backing of the research of Klaus and Kennell helped lend credibility and professionalize doulas.[27] Due to the lobbying efforts of DONA International, the term doula was accepted into the American Heritage Dictionary and Oxford Dictionary in 2003, followed by Merriam Webster Dictionary in 2004.[26] Alternative names to this role include \"childbirth assistant\" and \"monitrice,\" but they did not catch on as \"doula\" had.[19] In 2008, activists in New York City began the Doula Project, to expand the role of the doula to other reproductive experiences beyond birth, grounded in reproductive justice framework.[28][29] The participants began working as abortion doulas and coined the term \"full-spectrum doula\" who support all pregnancy experiences and outcomes such as pregnancy termination, miscarriage and fetal loss.[28][30] Full spectrum doula groups can be found in major cities in the United States.[31] In 2019, Black maternal health advocate and Parents writer Christine Michel Carter interviewed Vice President Kamala Harris about the popularity of doulas in the Black community.[32] As a senator, in 2019 Harris reintroduced the Maternal Care Access and Reducing Emergencies (CARE) Act which aimed to address the maternal mortality disparity faced by women of color by training providers on recognizing implicit racial bias and its impact on care. Harris stated: \"We need to speak the uncomfortable truth that women—and especially Black women—are too often not listened to or taken seriously by the health care system, and therefore they are denied the dignity that they deserve. And we need to speak this truth because today, the United States is 1 of only 13 countries in the world where the rate of maternal mortality is worse than it was 25 years ago. That risk is even higher for Black women, who are three to four times more likely than white women to die from pregnancy-related causes. These numbers are simply outrageous.\" A doula focused on birth is also known as a birth companion, nonclinical birth worker, birth coach, or post-birth supporter, by providing continuous care before, during, or after in the form of information, advocacy, physical support, and emotional support.[2][14][8][10] A birth doula is also called a labor doula. A birth doula might accompany a pregnant woman during labor and birth in place of or in addition to a partner, family member, or friend. Unlike these other birth companions, a doula has formal training in labor support.[2][14] The kinds of support provided during childbirth might include physical assistance and comfort (massage, maintaining a supporting posture, or providing water), emotional support (providing company, encouragement or simply talking in a soothing tone of voice), acting as an advocate during childbirth (supporting the birthing woman's right to make decisions about their own body and baby to the medical team) and informational support (provide information about the birthing process and non-medication based forms of pain relief, and facilitating communication between their client and health providers).[14][5] Most doula-client relationships begin a few months before the baby is due. Before the labor, the doula and the family can develop a relationship where the pregnant woman and their support person (e.g. the other parent) feel comfortable asking questions, expressing their fears and concerns, and discussing birth preferences.[24] Continuous support during labor provided by doulas has been associated with improved outcomes for both birthing women and babies, including shorter delivery, fewer cesarean sections and complications, the use of fewer medications and fetal extraction tools, less time in neonatal intensive care units, positive psychological benefits, more satisfying birth experiences, and increased breastfeeding.[11][5] Cross-country research on the effects of doulas on childbirth and postnatal care is complicated by the variety of settings, cultures, and medical systems of individual countries and the characteristics of patients. These benefits appear to be contingent on the doula providing continuous rather than intermittent assistance and knowing the specific social and cultural setting within which their services are provided.[33] Doula care can help reduce health disparities of those with the greatest need including those with less education, lower incomes, less preparation for childbirth and those lacking social support.[34][35][36][37] Research also supports the effectiveness of female friends or relatives, after minimal training, as a low-cost alternative to professional doulas.[11][38] In March 2014, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) put out a Consensus Statement titled \"Safe Prevention of Primary Cesarean Delivery\" in which it said, \"Increasing [a woman's] access to non-medical interventions during labor, such as continuous labor support, also has been shown to reduce cesarean birth rates.\"[39] As more research has become available on the positive benefits of trained labor support provided by someone not employed by the hospital, in 2017 ACOG officially announced the need for all birthing individuals to have access to continuous labor support outside hospital staff, and said, \"Evidence suggests that, in addition to regular nursing care, continuous one-to-one emotional support provided by support personnel, such as a doula, is associated with improved outcomes.\"[40][41] The official committee opinion put out by ACOG also offers other recommendations that allow birthing women more choice and access to more supportive care. Doulas could be utilized to help achieve many of these recommendations as they move towards better collaboration.[42] In 2017 the United Kingdom's Royal College of Midwives published a position statement on doulas, which supports the choice of the individual to hire a doula for their birth as long as the doula does not provide medical care.[43] A 2018 study examined women's perceptions of doulas in several different countries, including Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, Malawi, Sweden, Nepal, Russia, Canada, and the United States of America and found that having continuous support from a companion such as a doula was highly appreciated by most women.[10] However, perceptions may vary from country to country due to cultural factors, such as an emphasis on modesty and privacy, which might affect what kind of support a woman prefers.[10] A 2018 study examining news media discourse in China noted that Chinese doulas needed to register with official departments or organizations and are closely linked with midwifery. The doula profession was introduced in 1996 to mainland China and demand of their services increased since then, with women citing dissatisfaction with medical care. After China's implementation of the Second-Child Policy, doula care was strongly linked to doula support in regard to family planning.[44] Tensions between doctors, nurses, and doulas have sometimes been described as a \"turf battle,\"[45] though it is also recognized that doulas and nurses can occupy complementary roles that provide opportunities for mutual learning and assistance.[46] Some hospitals have created internal doula training programs to reduce conflict between doulas and medical staff.[45][47] There is no law requiring doulas to become certified, however, certification can benefit professional doulas by providing structured education prior to entry into the field, access to a mentor, opportunities for networking, and client confidence.[48] In North America, training generally takes the form of a two- to the three-day seminar, and some experience with childbirth.[49] Trainees might have hands-on practice with various techniques used during childbirth, including maternal positions and movements, relaxation and breathing exercises and other measures that could be used for comfort. Certification can occur through organizations at various levels (local, national, or international) and some require positive evaluations from medical professionals. Certification may also require, in addition to attending a training course, time spent working or learning about maternity care and childbirth classes, and possibly a written exam.[17] Some doulas train through distance education.[46] There is a movement to encourage certification and provide documentation of it on consumer websites such as DoulaMatch where an individual can find certified doulas, childbirth educators, yoga instructors, and other birth-related professionals.[46] Doulas not trained by a formal organization can be controversial within medical settings due to a lack of formal medical education when a discussion regarding medical interventions in labor versus pursuing natural childbirth without an epidural or cesarean section arises.[45] Major doula organizations that offer certification programs include Birth Arts International, Birth Works, Birthing from Within, Childbirth and Postpartum Professional Association (CAPPA), DONA International, Hypnobirthing, International Childbirth Education Association (ICEA), and ProDoula.[50] Because of the lack of standardization, doula organizations provide different courses with varying requirements and anyone can refer to themselves as a doula.[51] Doulamatch.net, an online referral page for doulas, has offered a list of items that students should look for as they begin looking for training. Amy Gilliland, a researcher on doula care and culture, also lists some qualities a training program should have.[52] Some theorists have stated that it might take college-level work or more in-depth online education in order to provide some of the communication skills that might be necessary.[53] In 2010, a survey of professional Canadian doulas found that the common motivations for doula work include \"desire to support women in childbirth, personal interest, and a wish to share their own positive birth experience with others\" but did not see the work as a means to create steady income.[54] Doulas of color also found motivation in providing care for their racial, ethnic and cultural communities so as to provide culturally competent care.[55] Volunteer doulas often saw doula work as a way to \"help others, to establish a practice as an employed doula, and to have a route into nursing or midwifery.\"[56] From 2021 to present, Canada has specifically focused research on the cultural significance of indigenous practices in doula work.[57][58][59] A 2004 study of North American doulas identified challenges to doula work such as lack of support from clinicians, balancing doula work with family and other work obligations, and being on call.[60] Volunteer doulas also found challenges in individuals' poor understanding of the doula's role, lack of clear boundaries, and complex socio-economic issues.[56] Additionally, doulas often are challenged with the task to navigate their role in medicalized (hospital) births.[61] Due to the social hierarchy and privilege that medical professionals have in medical settings doulas are often subordinate to doctors and physicians. Doulas have to negotiate the power dynamics between the patient and medical provider, while also establishing their legitimacy and role in the process of childbirth.[62] They, therefore, have to be cognizant of the medical environment in which their client chooses to give birth in order to effectively advocate for their client's needs.[63] An antepartum doula provides help and support to someone who has been put on bed rest or is experiencing a high-risk pregnancy. Emotional, physical and practical support can be provided by an antepartum doula in this circumstance.[64] Postpartum doulas provide educational support and practical support in the home in the first weeks and months after childbirth or after adding an infant to the family. The same doula often provides both birth and postpartum services.[2] Their services include a mixture of emotional support and practical help, such as infant care, breastfeeding support, information, advocacy and referral, partner support, sibling care, and household organization/work as the family adjusts to the addition of a new baby.[65] There is some evidence that postpartum doula support can increase breastfeeding and decrease postpartum depression.[5][66] Other workers overlap in some of these services, such as maternity nurses, health visitors, newborn care specialists, lactation consultants, and, historically, monthly nurses. Full-spectrum doulas extend the role of a birth attendant and provide support for all reproductive experiences which connect the role to the larger reproductive justice movement.[3] This can include support for abortion, miscarriage, stillbirth, queer family planning, adoption, and fertility as well as extending services to women, men, transgender and gender non-conforming individuals.[3][67][68] Abortion doulas focus on providing support to clients having an induced abortion. They provide emotional, physical, and informational support virtually or in person.[3][15] Full-spectrum doulas often identify as activists as well as service providers and emphasize the human rights of their clients in the hopes of ending social stereotypes.[3] Abortion doulas provide care before, during, and after an abortion, with support varying by person and their informational, emotional, physical, and practical needs. Doulas work in a variety of situations, including community collectives and as solo practitioners, and provide abortion support as a service in their full-spectrum practice. There are no certifications specifically for abortion doulas that are administered nationally or through individual states.[69] In the United States following the landmark decision, Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, doulas expect to be contacted more frequently about abortion support as access becomes more limited. They are taking precautions to retain online anonymity to better protect patients and themselves and navigate the threat of legal action.[69] A gender doula provides care before, during, and after the gender transition process for transgender and non-binary individuals.[70] Gender doulas may also serve as patient advocates for their clients against medical practitioners who may misgender or undermine the gender identity of the client. End-of-life or death doulas care for critically ill adults in geriatric care,[17] and during death.[71] While some doulas work independently or on a volunteer basis, others might work in association with a health care service, such as a palliative care service. The roles of an end-of-life doula include not only physical tasks, such as assisting with posture or making the bed comfortable but also emotional and psychological tasks, such as providing guidance and support. In the United States, doulas can be found in hospital, community-based programs as well as private practice or doula agencies. They might also be reimbursed by insurance companies or out-of-pocket by clients.[72][73][74] Since insurance companies typically do not cover the cost of hiring a doula, they are more popular among middle- and upper-class parents than amongst parents with lower incomes.[45][75] Since doula care has the potential to lower maternity costs and reduce health disparities, there is a push for coverage through Medicaid reimbursement programs. As of 2022, four states, Oregon, Minnesota, Virginia and Wisconsin, have implemented reimbursement programs.[34][76] In 2019, New York State launched a doula pilot program for Medicaid reimbursement in Erie and Kings Counties.[77] In that same year, New York State passed a bill to certify doulas to lend legitimacy to the profession and to pave the way for Medicaid reimbursement from the federal government, becoming the first state to do so. Doulas in New York, however, expressed concern about the bill, having not been involved with the bill's writing, citing that state certification would make doulas more beholden to the formal medical system, be a hit to business if certification programs are not approved by the state, and might prevent community doulas from working with low-income individuals.[78][79] In the UK, the National Health Service and promotion of midwifery for low-risk pregnancies provide a continuity of care unavailable to North American pregnant women, but still are seeing an upswing in doulas. This pattern has been suggested to result from the lack of midwives available and a move to provide doulas to individuals at greater risk for poor outcomes.[56] A 2019 study reviewed perceptions of labor companionship across mostly high income countries and found barriers that prevent the universal implementation of doula care. These challenges are due to a multitude of factors dealing with perception (for example, providers not understanding the benefits or roles and other medical aspects being seen as more important) and logistics (chiefly, gaps in policy, difficulty of integration, and lack of training).[80] Community-based doulas work with underserved communities of which they are often members to provide a sense of cultural humility that fosters trust and strengthens relationships between the doula and their client. The services provided are often low cost, and expand in the amount of support offered compared to traditional doulas and consider physical, social spiritual and emotional needs. Services include an increased amount of home visits, preparation for the birthing experience, education, guidance navigating health care systems, language support, screening for mental health, and food security needs.[81] Additionally, community-based doula models provide insight in the creation of policies that will support those families and underserved communities.[81] These doulas also actively engage policy makers by recommendations on certification and Medicaid coverage, integration into medical care, and participating on advisory boards.[82] Since the 1980s, women incarcerated in the US has increased nearly 800 percent, of which an estimated 12,000 pregnant women are incarcerated annually. Pregnant prisoners are allowed to be shackled in more than 20 states and are forced to return to jail within 24 hours without their infants.[83] The environmental factors of the penal system are shown to increase the risks associated with poor perinatal outcomes and have long-term health risks for the women and their children.[84] The implementation of prison doulas rose out of the movement to end shackling for pregnant and laboring women from the prison abolition, human rights, reproductive justice, and birth justice movements in the early 2000s.[84][85] Prison doula organizations work with those incarcerated to provide prenatal care, childbirth education, birth attendance, and breast feeding support. By providing doula services to jails, prisons, recovery centers, and county hospitals, doulas work to improve birth experiences and bonding as well as to challenge the dehumanizing penal environment.[85] In studies of women who received doula services while incarcerated, the women reported increased happiness around their pregnancy; greater feelings of empowerment; a sense of normalcy around birth; and support during separation from their infant.[84][86] While well-received, prison doula support is not widespread in the United States and most programs are local due to the lack of an established federal standard of medical care for pregnant incarcerated individuals.[83] In 2018, Washington was the first state to provide access to midwifery and doula services for incarcerated women for prenatal care, delivery, and postpartum care. However, the bill does not establish means of funding the services, and does not establish guidelines for care.[87]",

                "title": "Stephen Curry - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Wardell Stephen Curry II (/ˈstɛfən/ STEF-ən;[1] born March 14, 1988) is an American professional basketball player and point guard for the Golden State Warriors of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Near-unanimously considered the greatest shooter of all time,[2][3] Curry is credited with revolutionizing the sport by inspiring teams and players at all levels to more prominently utilize the three-point shot.[4][5][6][7] He is a four-time NBA champion, a two-time NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP), an NBA Finals MVP, an NBA All-Star Game MVP, an NBA Clutch Player of the Year, and the inaugural NBA Western Conference finals MVP. He is also a two-time NBA scoring champion, a ten-time NBA All-Star, and a ten-time All-NBA selection (including four on the First Team). Internationally, he has won two gold medals at the FIBA World Cup and a gold medal at the 2024 Summer Olympics as part of the U.S. men's national team. Curry is the son of former NBA player Dell Curry and the older brother of current NBA player Seth Curry. He played collegiately for the Davidson Wildcats, where he set career scoring records for Davidson and the Southern Conference, and helped the Wildcats advance to the Elite Eight in 2008. He was named Conference Player of the Year twice, and set the NCAA single-season record for three-pointers made (162) during his sophomore year. Curry was selected by the Warriors as the seventh overall pick in the 2009 NBA draft. In 2014–15, Curry won his first league MVP award and led the Warriors to their first championship since 1975. The following season, he became the first player to be elected MVP by a unanimous vote and lead the league in scoring while shooting above 50–40–90. That same year, the Warriors broke the record for the most wins in a regular season in NBA history (73) en route to the 2016 NBA Finals, which they lost to the Cleveland Cavaliers in Game 7. Curry helped the Warriors win back-to-back titles in 2017 and 2018, and reach the 2019 NBA Finals, losing to the Toronto Raptors in six games. Following injury struggles and missed playoff appearances in 2020 and 2021, Curry won his fourth championship with the Warriors and first Finals MVP award, defeating the Boston Celtics in the 2022 NBA Finals. The same season, he became the all-time leader in three-pointers made in NBA history, surpassing Ray Allen.[8] Curry is the holder of numerous other records, notably for his efficiency and three-point shooting. He has the highest career free-throw percentage in NBA history (91.0%) and has led the league in three-pointers made a record eight times. In 2013, he set the NBA record for three-pointers made in a regular season with 272, surpassed that record in 2015 (286), and again in 2016 (402). Curry was born on March 14, 1988,[9] at the Akron General Medical Center in Akron, Ohio, to Sonya (née Adams) and Dell Curry.[10][11] He grew up in Charlotte, North Carolina, where his father spent most of his NBA career with the Charlotte Hornets.[11][12] Dell often took Curry and his younger brother Seth to his games, where they would shoot with the Hornets during warm-ups.[13] The family briefly moved to Toronto, where Dell finished out his career as a member of the Raptors.[12] During this time, Curry played for the Queensway Christian College boys' basketball team, leading them to an undefeated season.[14][15] He was also a member of Toronto 5–0, a club team that plays across Ontario,[16][17] pitting him against fellow future NBA players Cory Joseph and Kelly Olynyk.[17] Curry led the team to a 33–4 record, en route to winning the provincial championship.[18] After Dell's retirement, the family moved back to Charlotte and Curry enrolled at Charlotte Christian School,[19] where he was named all-conference and all-state, and led his team to three conference titles and three state playoff appearances. Because of his father's storied career at Virginia Tech, Curry wanted to play college basketball for the Hokies, but was only offered a walk-on spot due in part to his slender 160-pound frame.[20] He ultimately chose to attend Davidson College, who had aggressively recruited him from the tenth grade.[21] Before Curry even played in his first game for the Wildcats, head coach Bob McKillop praised him at a Davidson alumni event, saying: \"Wait 'til you see Steph Curry. He is something special.\"[22] In his first collegiate game against Eastern Michigan, Curry finished with 15 points but committed 13 turnovers. In the next game against Michigan, he scored 32 points, dished out four assists, and grabbed nine rebounds. Curry finished the season leading the Southern Conference in scoring with 21.5 points per game. He was second in the nation among freshmen in scoring, behind only Kevin Durant of Texas. Curry's scoring helped the Wildcats to a 29–5 overall record and a Southern Conference regular-season title. On March 2, 2007, in the Southern Conference tournament semi-finals against Furman, Curry made his 113th three-point field goal of the year, breaking Keydren Clark's NCAA freshman season record for three-pointers.[23] Curry eclipsed the school freshman scoring record with his 502nd point against Chattanooga on February 6, 2007.[24] On March 15, 2007, Davidson marched into the NCAA tournament as a 13th seed set to play Maryland; despite Curry's game-high 30 points, Davidson lost 82–70.[25] At the end of his freshman season, Curry was named Southern Conference Freshman of the Year, SoCon Tournament MVP, and selected to the SoCon All-tournament team, All-freshman team, and All-SoCon First Team.[26] He was also an honorable mention in Sports Illustrated's All-Mid-Major. After the season ended, he was selected for the USA team to appear at the 2007 FIBA U-19 World Championships in which he averaged 9.4 points, 3.8 rebounds, and 2.2 assists in 19.4 minutes, helping Team USA to a silver medal finish.[27] In his sophomore season in 2007–08, Curry had grown to his adult height of 6 ft 2 in (1.88 m) and again led the Southern Conference in scoring, averaging 25.5 points per game while adding 4.7 rebounds per game and 2.8 assists per game. He led the Wildcats to a 26–6 regular-season record and a 20–0 conference record. As a result of Curry's exceptional play, Davidson earned its third straight NCAA tournament bid. On March 21, 2008, Davidson matched up with seventh-seeded Gonzaga. Gonzaga led by 11 points early in the second half but Curry went on to score 30 points in the half[28] to push Davidson to their first NCAA Tournament win since 1969 with a score of 82–76. Curry ended the game with 40 points while also going 8-for-10 from three-point range.[29] On March 23, Davidson played second-seeded Georgetown in the second round of the NCAA Tournament. Georgetown was ranked eighth nationally and entered the game as a heavy favorite after an appearance in the Final Four in 2007. Curry managed just five points in the first half of the game as Davidson trailed by as many as 17 points, but his 25 second-half points led Davidson to a 74–70 comeback victory.[28] On March 28, 2008, Curry led Davidson to another win, against third-seeded Wisconsin. Curry scored 33 points as Davidson won 73–56 to advance to the Elite 8.[30] Curry joined Clyde Lovellette, Jerry Chambers, and Glenn Robinson as the only college players to score over 30 points in their first four career NCAA tournament games.[30] Curry also tied Darrin Fitzgerald of Butler for the single-season record for most three-pointers with 158.[31][32] On March 30, 2008, he set the record, against the top-seeded Kansas Jayhawks, with his 159th three-pointer of the season. Curry scored 25 points in the game but Davidson lost 59–57, and the Jayhawks went on to win the championship.[33] Curry finished the season averaging 25.9 points, 2.9 assists, and 2.1 steals per game. He was named to the Associated Press' All-America Second Team on March 31, 2008.[34] He also was named the Most Outstanding Player of the Midwest Region of the 2008 NCAA tournament, becoming the first player from a team not making the Final Four to do so since Juwan Howard of Michigan in 1994.[35] Curry was nominated for an ESPY in the Breakthrough Player of the Year category.[36] After Davidson's loss against Kansas in the NCAA Regional Finals, Curry announced that he would return for his junior year.[31] He stated that he wanted to develop as a point guard, his likely position in the NBA. On November 18, 2008, Curry scored a career-high 44 points in Davidson's 82–78 loss to Oklahoma.[37] He extended a career-long streak by scoring at least 25 points for the seventh straight game.[37] On November 21, Curry registered a career-high 13 assists, to go along with 30 points in Davidson's 97–70 win over Winthrop.[38] On November 25, against Loyola, Curry was held scoreless as Loyola constantly double-teamed him. It was Curry's only scoreless collegiate game and just his second without double-digit points. He finished 0-for-3 from the field as Davidson won the game 78–48.[39] In Davidson's next game 11 days later, Curry matched his career high of 44 in a 72–67 win over North Carolina State.[40] Curry surpassed the 2000-point mark for his career on January 3, 2009, as he scored 21 points against Samford.[41] On February 14, 2009, Curry rolled his ankle in the second half of a win over Furman. The injury caused Curry to miss the February 18 game against The Citadel, the first and only game he missed in his college career.[42] On February 28, 2009, Curry became Davidson's all-time leading scorer with 34 points in a 99–56 win against Georgia Southern. That gave Curry 2,488 points for his career, surpassing previous school leader John Gerdy.[43] Davidson won the 2008–09 Southern Conference regular season championship for the south division, finishing 18–2 in the conference.[44][45] In the 2009 Southern Conference tournament, Davidson played Appalachian State in the quarterfinals and won 84–68. Curry scored 43 points, which is the third most points in Southern Conference tournament history.[46] In the semifinals, against the College of Charleston, Curry had 20 points but Davidson lost 52–59. Despite lobbying from Davidson head coach Bob McKillop and Charleston coach Bobby Cremins,[47] the Wildcats failed to get an NCAA tournament bid. Instead, they received the sixth seed in the 2009 NIT. Davidson played the third seed, South Carolina, on the road in the first round. Curry scored 32 points as the Wildcats beat the Gamecocks 70–63.[48][49] Davidson then lost 80–68 to the Saint Mary's Gaels in the second round. Curry registered 26 points, nine rebounds, and five assists in what was his final game for the Wildcats.[50] In his final season at Davidson, Curry averaged 28.6 points, 5.6 assists, and 2.5 steals. He was the NCAA scoring champion and was named a consensus first team All-American.[51] Curry opted out of his senior year at Davidson, but he stated that he still planned to earn his degree.[52] He completed his bachelor's degree in sociology in May 2022.[53] Curry's completion of his degree qualified him for jersey or number retirement; Davidson reserves that honor for players who complete their degrees at the school. In a ceremony held on August 31, 2022, Curry became the first Davidson player to have his number retired (six others have jerseys retired, but their numbers remain in circulation). At the ceremony, he also entered Davidson's athletic hall of fame and physically received his Davidson diploma.[54][55] On June 25, 2009, his father's 45th birthday, Curry was selected as the seventh overall pick in the 2009 NBA draft by the Golden State Warriors.[56] Although the Warriors already had another lean, 6-foot-3, offensive-minded guard in Monta Ellis, coach Don Nelson had a penchant for using small lineups in his Nellie Ball system, and had warmed to the idea of selecting Curry.[57][58] However, Ellis announced at a media session that he and Curry were too small to play together.[59] Curry appeared in 80 games (77 starts) during the 2009–10 season, averaging 17.5 points, 4.5 rebounds, 5.9 assists, and 1.90 steals in 36.2 minutes.[60] His second half of the season vaulted him into the rookie of the year race.[61] He was named Western Conference Rookie of the Month for January, March, and April, finishing as the only Western Conference rookie to win the award three times.[60] He finished runner-up for the NBA Rookie of the Year behind Tyreke Evans[61] and was a unanimous NBA All-Rookie First Team selection, becoming the first Warriors player since Jason Richardson in 2001–02 to earn All-Rookie First Team honors.[60] He scored 30-plus points eight times, setting the most 30-point games by any rookie in 2009–10 and the most since LeBron James had 13 and Carmelo Anthony had 10 in 2003–04. Curry had five 30-point/10-assist games, which tied Michael Jordan for the second-most 30-point/10-assist games by a rookie (Oscar Robertson is first with 25). He became just the sixth rookie in NBA history to post a 35-point, 10-assist, 10-rebound game when he registered his first career triple-double with 36 points, 13 assists, and 10 rebounds against the Los Angeles Clippers on February 10. In the Warriors' season finale against the Portland Trail Blazers on April 14, Curry recorded a then- career-high 42 points, nine rebounds and eight assists, becoming the first rookie since Robertson in February 1961 to register at least those numbers in each category in the same game. Curry finished his rookie season with 166 three-pointers, which were, at the time, the most ever by a rookie in NBA history.[60] In 2010–11, Curry appeared in 74 games (all starts), averaging 18.6 points, 3.9 rebounds, 5.8 assists, and 1.47 steals in 33.6 minutes per contest.[60] His free throw percentage of .934 (212–227 FT) set a new Warriors single-season record, surpassing the previous mark of .924 set by Rick Barry in 1977–78. He also became the first Warriors player to lead the NBA in free throw percentage since Mark Price in 1996–97.[60] Curry registered 20-or-more points 35 times, including seven 30-plus performances. He posted a season-high 39 points and a then- career-high 14 made field goals (on 20 attempts) against the Oklahoma City Thunder on December 5. In February 2011, during All-Star Weekend, Curry won the Skills Challenge[62] and registered 13 points, eight assists, and six rebounds in 28 minutes as a member of the Sophomore squad in the Rookie Challenge.[60] In May 2011, he was named the recipient of the NBA Sportsmanship Award,[63] and underwent surgery on his right ankle.[64] In the lockout-shortened 2011–12 season, Curry appeared in 26 games (23 starts), averaging 14.7 points, 3.4 rebounds, 5.3 assists, and 1.50 steals in 28.2 minutes per contest. He missed 40 games due to right ankle and foot injuries,[60] including the last 28 games with a sprained right ankle and subsequent surgery on the ankle, which was performed on April 25.[65] In 2012, Golden State included Curry in a trade offer to the Milwaukee Bucks for Andrew Bogut, which the Bucks rejected due to Curry's history with bad ankles. Ellis was traded instead.[66][67][68] According to then- Warriors general manager Larry Riley, they offered Curry with the intention of steering the deal to Ellis.[67] The deal opened an opportunity for Curry to lead the team.[59] Prior to the start of the 2012–13 season, Curry signed a four-year, $44 million contract extension with the Warriors.[69][70] At the time, many basketball writers considered the move risky for Golden State because of Curry's injury history.[71] Over the course of the year, Curry and former backcourt teammate Klay Thompson gained a reputation for their perimeter scoring, earning them the nickname the \"Splash Brothers\".[72] In 2012–13, Curry appeared in 78 games (all starts), averaging then-career highs of 22.9 points (seventh in NBA) and 6.9 assists to go with 4.0 rebounds and 1.62 steals in 38.2 minutes.[60] He set a new NBA single-season three-point record with 272 three-pointers, eclipsing the previous mark set by Ray Allen (269 in 2005–06), doing so on 53 less attempts than Allen did with Seattle.[60] Curry earned Western Conference Player of the Month honors for the month of April. During this time he averaged 25.4 points, 8.1 assists, 3.9 rebounds, and 2.13 steals in eight games in the final month of the season to become the third Warrior to win the award, joining Chris Mullin (November 1990 and January 1989) and Bernard King (January 1981). He tallied two of the NBA's top six scoring games with 54 points on February 27 at New York and 47 on April 12 at Los Angeles, becoming the first Warrior to score 45-plus at New York and Los Angeles in the same season since Rick Barry in 1966, joining Barry, Guy Rodgers, and Wilt Chamberlain as the only four Warriors to do so. Curry's 54 points against the Knicks included a then- career-best and then- franchise-record 11 three-pointers, becoming the first player in NBA history to score 50-plus points while hitting 10-plus three-pointers in a game. It was the most scored by a Warrior since Purvis Short tallied 59 points in 1984. In 2013, he appeared in the playoffs for the first time in his career, with the Warriors earning the sixth seed in the Western Conference. In 12 playoff games (all starts), he averaged 23.4 points, 8.1 assists, and 3.8 rebounds. He set a new franchise record with 42 playoff three-pointers, eclipsing the Warriors' career playoff mark of 29 previously held by Jason Richardson, giving him a total of 314 three-pointers for the season to become the first player in NBA history to make at least 300 three-pointers in a single season.[60] In 2013–14, Curry appeared in 78 games (all starts), averaging career highs of 24.0 points (seventh in the NBA) and 8.5 assists (fifth in the NBA) to go with 4.3 rebounds and 1.63 steals, becoming the first player in Warriors franchise history to average 24 points and eight assists in a single season (ninth player in NBA history). He led the league in three-pointers made for a second consecutive season with 261, becoming the first player since Ray Allen in 2001–02 and 2002–03 to lead the league in three-pointers in back-to-back seasons. He was named Western Conference Player of the Month for April and earned All-NBA Second Team honors, becoming the first Warriors player named to the First or Second Team since 1993–94.[60] On December 7 against the Memphis Grizzlies, Curry eclipsed Jason Richardson (700) as the franchise's leader in career three-pointers.[73] In February, he made his first All-Star appearance,[74] becoming the Warriors' first All-Star starter since Latrell Sprewell in 1995.[60] He scored a season-high 47 points on April 13 against the Portland Trail Blazers for his third 40-point game of the year. He finished the regular season tied for second in the NBA in triple-doubles with four, the most by a Warrior in a single season since Chamberlain had five in 1963–64.[60] Seeded sixth for the second consecutive postseason, the Warriors were defeated in seven games by the Los Angeles Clippers.[75] Prior to the start of the 2014–15 season, the Warriors hired former NBA player and general manager Steve Kerr as their new head coach.[77] Kerr implemented significant changes to Golden State's schemes, including playing at a faster pace and giving Curry more freedom to shoot, helping the team evolve into a title contender.[78] On February 4, Curry scored a season-high 51 points in a win over the Dallas Mavericks.[79] He was the leading vote-getter for the All-Star Game and won the Three-Point Contest on All-Star Saturday night.[80][81] On April 9, he broke his own league record for three-pointers made in a season during a game against the Portland Trail Blazers.[82] The Warriors finished the year with 67 wins and Curry was voted the NBA Most Valuable Player after posting averages of 23.8 points, 7.7 assists, and 2 steals per game.[83] Over the course of the season, he sat out 17 fourth quarters due to Golden State's wide margins of victory.[84] In Game 5 of the Conference Semifinals against the Memphis Grizzlies, Curry became the first player in league history to register six three-pointers and six steals in a game.[85] In Game 6, he made a playoff career-high 8 three-pointers en route to a series-clinching victory.[86] In Game 3 of the Conference Finals against the Houston Rockets, he broke the NBA record for most three-pointers made in a single postseason.[87][88] The Warriors went on to defeat the Rockets to earn a Finals matchup with the Cleveland Cavaliers, where Curry struggled to start the series, converting on only 22 percent of his field goals in Game 2.[89] In Game 5, he scored 37 points,[90] and in Game 6, Golden State closed out the series to win their first championship in 40 years.[91] For the Finals, Curry averaged 26 points and 6.3 assists per game.[90] The Warriors' playoff run was the first in which an All-NBA first team selection eliminated all other first team selections en route to a championship.[92] To start the 2015–16 season, Curry became the first player since Michael Jordan in 1989–90 to score 118 points in his team's first three games,[93] including a season-high 53 points against the New Orleans Pelicans in the third game.[94] The Warriors made NBA history on November 24 when they became the first team ever to start 16–0 with a win over the Los Angeles Lakers,[95] before improving to 24–0 on December 11 with a double-overtime win over the Boston Celtics.[96] Their streak was broken the following day against the Milwaukee Bucks.[97] On December 28, Curry recorded his sixth career triple-double with 23 points, a career-high 14 rebounds, and 10 assists in a 122–103 win over the Sacramento Kings.

His 51 points tied Gilbert Arenas and Michael Jordan for the Verizon Center record.[100] During the 2016 NBA All-Star Weekend, Curry competed in his third straight All-Star game for the West, and competed in the Three-Point Contest, where he lost in the final round to former teammate Klay Thompson. At 48–4, the Warriors entered the All-Star break with the best record through 52 games in NBA history, one win better than the 1995–96 Chicago Bulls and 1966–67 Philadelphia 76ers.[101] On February 25, Curry scored 51 points and made 10 three-pointers to lead the Warriors past the Orlando Magic 130–114, becoming the first player to record at least three 50-point games since LeBron James and Dwyane Wade in 2008–09. He also became the first player in NBA history to score at least 50 points in a game with only one free throw attempted.[92] Curry surpassed Kyle Korver's record of 127 consecutive games with a made three-pointer.[102] In the following game, two days later, the Warriors defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder in overtime 121–118, owing to a long-distance game-winning shot made by Curry with 0.6 seconds remaining. In doing so, he tied the then- NBA single-game record (12) with Kobe Bryant and Donyell Marshall and finished with 46 points.[103] He also broke his own NBA record for made three-pointers in a season, setting a new mark at 288.[104] In February 2016, Curry averaged over 35 points per game, while shooting at least 50% from both the field and three-point range, becoming the first player in NBA history to achieve this feat in a calendar month.[105] On March 7, in a win over the Magic, Curry scored 41 points and became the first player in NBA history to make 300 regular-season three-pointers.[106] On April 1, Curry missed a three-pointer to tie the game against the Celtics with 5.3 seconds left, as the Warriors suffered their first home defeat since January 27, 2015, snapping an NBA-record 54-game winning streak in the regular season at Oracle Arena.[107] On April 7, Curry scored 27 points to help the Warriors become the second team in NBA history to win 70 games in a season with a 112–101 win over the San Antonio Spurs.[108] Three days later in a rematch against the Spurs, Curry scored 37 points in a 92–86 win, not only tying the 1996 Bulls, but snapping San Antonio's undefeated home streak and also ending a long losing streak in AT&T Center.[109] In the Warriors' regular-season finale on April 13 against the Memphis Grizzlies, Curry scored 46 points with 10 made three-pointers, becoming the first player in NBA history to make 400 three-pointers in a season (finishing with 402).[110] With a 125–104 win over the Grizzlies, the Warriors became the first 73-win team in NBA history, surpassing the 1995–96 Chicago Bulls' 72–10 record to finish the 2015–16 season with just nine losses.[111] With the conclusion of the regular season, Curry became the seventh player in NBA history to join the 50–40–90 club and the first to achieve this feat while averaging over 30 points per game.[112][113] Curry led the league in scoring (30.1 points per game), steals (2.14), and free throw percentage (90.8), becoming the first player to lead all three statistics in a season.[114] For his record-breaking season, Curry was named the league's first ever unanimous MVP, becoming the 11th player in history to win the award in consecutive seasons and the first guard to do so since Steve Nash in 2004–05 and 2005–06.[115] His scoring average increase of 6.3 is the largest ever by a reigning MVP.[112] In the 2016 playoffs, the Warriors defeated the Houston Rockets in the first round despite Curry only playing in the first half of Games 1 and 4 due to injury.[116][117][118] A right MCL injury kept him out of the first three games of the second round.[119] In Game 4 of the second-round series against the Portland Trail Blazers, Curry came off the bench to score 40 points in a 132–125 overtime win;[120] 17 of those points came in the extra period, an NBA record for points scored by an individual in overtime.[121] Curry led the Warriors to a 4–1 victory over the Trail Blazers, as they moved on to the Western Conference Finals to face the Oklahoma City Thunder. After going down 3–1, he helped the Warriors rally to win the series 4–3 and advance to their second straight NBA Finals.[122] In the Finals, Curry's play relative to his regular season performance remained inconsistent, as it had been since he returned from injury against Portland;[123] still, he broke Danny Green's record of 27 three-pointers made in a Finals.[124] Despite being up 3–1 in the series, the Warriors were defeated by the Cleveland Cavaliers in seven games and became the first team in NBA Finals history to lose a series after leading 3–1.

He had hit a three-pointer in every regular-season game since November 11, 2014.[127] Three days later, he hit 13 three-pointers against New Orleans, becoming the first player in NBA history to make as many three-pointers in a regular-season game.[128] Curry shot 16-of-26 overall against the Pelicans for his first 40-point game of the season, finishing with 46 in a 116–106 win.[129] On December 11, Curry hit 2 three-pointers against the Minnesota Timberwolves to pass Steve Nash for 17th on the NBA's career three-pointers list.[130] With 14 points against the Dallas Mavericks on December 30, Curry (11,903) passed Purvis Short (11,894) for seventh place on the Warriors' all-time scoring list.[131] In a loss to the Memphis Grizzlies on January 6, 2017, Curry had his second 40-point game of the season and reached the 12,000-point threshold, becoming the seventh player in Warriors franchise history to score 12,000 career points.[132] On January 19, Curry was named a starter on the Western Conference All-Star team for the 2017 NBA All-Star Game.[133] On February 2, he hit his 200th three-pointer of the season in the Warriors' 133–120 win over the Los Angeles Clippers, making him the first player in NBA history to have 200 or more three-pointers in five consecutive seasons.[134] On March 5, he scored 31 points and moved into the top 10 on the NBA's career three-point list in a 112–105 win over the New York Knicks.

They went up 3–0 in the series, becoming the third team in NBA history to win their first 11 playoff games.[139] His 36 points in Game 4 led to a 129–115 victory that saw the Warriors advance to the NBA Finals for a third straight year while becoming the first team in league history to start the playoffs 12–0.[140] In Game 2 of the 2017 NBA Finals against the Cleveland Cavaliers, Curry recorded his first career postseason triple-double with 32 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds to help the Warriors go up 2–0 in the series with a 132–113 win.[141] Curry helped the Warriors clinch the series and the championship in Game 5 with 34 points, 10 assists, and six rebounds, as Golden State claimed its second title in three years.[142] On July 1, 2017, Curry agreed to a five-year, $201 million extension with the Warriors, becoming the first NBA player to sign a supermax contract worth over $200 million.[143] He officially signed the contract on July 25.[144] On December 1, he scored 23 points and passed Jason Kidd for eighth place on the career three-pointers made list in a 133–112 win over the Orlando Magic.[145] On December 4, in a 125–115 win over the New Orleans Pelicans, Curry hit 5 three-pointers to become the fastest NBA player to achieve the milestone of 2,000 career three-pointers, achieving that mark in just 597 games, 227 less than the previous fastest player to achieve that mark, Ray Allen.[146][147] In that same game, Curry injured his right ankle and subsequently missed 11 games,[148] returning to action on December 30 and scoring 38 points with a season-high 10 three-pointers in a 141–128 win over the Memphis Grizzlies. Curry shot 13 of 17 and 10 of 13 from deep in 26 minutes for his ninth 30-point game of the season.

Three titles ... Wherever that puts us in the conversation in the history of the NBA ... I'm a three-time champ.\"[164] Rohan Nadkarni of Sports Illustrated argued that \"the Golden State dynasty started with Stephen Curry.

He became the first player in Finals history to make 5+ three-pointers in four consecutive games.[230] Curry (at age 34 years, 88 days) also became the second-oldest player in NBA Finals history to record a 40-point, 10-rebound game behind only LeBron James in 2020 (at age 35 years, 284 days).[231] In Game 5 of the Finals, Curry passed Boston Celtics legend John Havlicek for 10th on the all-time Finals assists list.[232] In Game 6 of the Finals, Curry scored 34 points along with seven rebounds, seven assists, and led the Warriors to a 103–90 victory over the Celtics.

He became the first player to score 50 points in a Game 7 and tied Karl Malone for the most points in a playoff game at age 35 or older.[249][250] He also became the first player in playoff history to score at least 20 points from behind the arc and in the paint in the same game.[251] Following the series' completion, Curry joined Jordan as the only players in playoff history to record at least 200 points in a series at age 35 or older.[252] His 50 points also set a record for the most points scored in a Game 7.[253][c] In Game 4 of the Conference Semifinals against the Lakers, Curry logged his third postseason career triple-double with 31 points, 10 rebounds, 14 assists, and three steals in a 104–101 loss.[255][256] The Warriors were eliminated in six games, despite Curry's 32-point outing in a 122–101 closeout loss in Game 6.[257] On November 1, 2023, Curry became the first player in NBA history to make a three-pointer in 250 consecutive regular season games.[258] On November 3, he scored a game-winning layup in a 141–139 win against the Oklahoma City Thunder.[259] On December 16, Curry scored 37 points on 14-for-22 shooting, including 6-for-8 from beyond the arc in a 124–120 victory over the Brooklyn Nets. He became the first player in NBA history to record at least 3,500 career three-pointers.[260][261] On January 27, 2024, Curry recorded 46 points and nine made three-pointers, in a 145–144 double-overtime loss to the Los Angeles Lakers.[262] On February 1, Curry was named to his tenth All-Star Game and his first as a reserve.[263] On February 3, Curry scored a season-high 60 points on 22-of-38 shooting from the field with 10 three-pointers made in a 141–134 overtime loss to the Atlanta Hawks, setting several NBA records; he joined Kobe Bryant as the only players in history to record a 60-point game after turning 35 years old; he became the second player after Rick Barry to score at least 60 points with at most six free throws attempted; he joined Damian Lillard and Karl-Anthony Towns as the only players to record at least 60 points and 10 made three-pointers in a regular season game; he became the first player in history to average over 40 points per game on 50–40–100 splits in a four-game span.[264][265] On February 8, Curry scored 42 points on 15-of-22 shooting from the field, including a season-high 11-of-16 shooting from three, in a 131–109 win over the Indiana Pacers.[266] On February 10, Curry put up 30 points and nine rebounds, alongside a game-winning three-pointer in a 113–112 win over the Phoenix Suns.[267] On April 25, Curry was named the 2023–24 NBA Clutch Player of the Year over DeMar DeRozan and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander after leading the league in clutch points that season.[268] On August 30, 2024, Curry signed a one-year, $62.6 million contract extension with the Warriors throughout the 2026–27 season, becoming the first NBA player to earn $60 million in a single season.[269] He also joined LeBron James and Kevin Durant as the only players in history to amass $500 million in career earnings.[270] On November 10, 2024, Curry recorded 36 points and seven assists in a 127–116 road victory over the Oklahoma City Thunder.[271] Two days later, he scored all of Golden State's final twelve points as part of a 37-point, 6-rebound and 9-assist outing in a 120–117 win over the Dallas Mavericks in Klay Thompson's first return to the Bay Area after leaving for Dallas in a sign-and-trade during the offseason.[272] Curry's first experience with the United States national team came at the 2007 FIBA Under-19 World Championship, where he helped Team USA capture the silver medal.[273] In 2010, he was selected to the senior squad, playing limited minutes at the 2010 FIBA World Championship (later known as the FIBA Basketball World Cup) as the United States won the gold medal in an undefeated tournament.[274] In 2012, Curry was excluded from the list of 20 finalists selected for consideration for the 2012 U.S. Olympic team in London, which reportedly left him \"very disappointed\" but motivated to improve his game for future opportunities.[275][276] In 2014, he took on a larger role with the team, helping them to another undefeated tournament at the 2014 World Cup and scoring 10 points in the final game.[277] On June 6, 2016, Curry withdrew from consideration for the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, citing ankle and knee ailments as the major reason behind the decision.[278] Curry made his Olympic debut with the 2024 U.S. Olympic team in Paris, alongside his longtime head coach Steve Kerr.[279] He initially struggled from the field. In a tightly contested semifinal game against Serbia, Curry led a 17-point comeback in a 95–91 win, finishing with a tournament-high 36 points, 8 rebounds, and 9-of-14 shooting from three-point range.[280] In the final two minutes, Curry made a successful steal, layup, and two clutch free throws to maintain a lead of four points.[281] He set a national record for most points scored in an Olympic knockout game and an Olympic record for most three-pointers made in a knockout game, respectively.[282][283] His 36 points are the second-most ever scored in a game by an American, behind Carmelo Anthony's 37-point performance against Nigeria in 2012. In a postgame interview, teammate Kevin Durant called Curry's performance \"one of the greatest games I've ever seen him play\".[281] Curry followed up his performance with another successful outing in the final match against France, tallying 24 points, 5 assists, 2 steals, and 8-of-12 shooting from three-point range.[284] He made 4 consecutive three-pointers within the final 3 minutes to help seal the game and secure the United States' 5th straight Olympic gold medal and his career-first.[285] Curry finished the tournament as the team's leading scorer, averaging 14.8 points per game, and set a new Olympic record for most three-pointers made in a final.[286] For his performances, Curry was named to the Olympics All-Star Five team.[287] He joined LeBron James, Magic Johnson, and Michael Jordan as the fourth player in NBA history to win at least four championships, two league MVP awards, a Finals MVP award, and an Olympic gold medal in a career.[288][289] Listed at 6 feet 2 inches (1.88 m) and 185 pounds (86 kg), Curry plays almost exclusively at the point guard position combined with the signature play style of an elite shooting guard. He has career averages of 24.8 points, 6.4 assists, 4.7 rebounds, and 1.5 steals per game (through the end of the 2023–24 season),[83] His career free throw percentage of 91.0% is the highest in NBA history, and he has led the league in annual free-throw percentage four times.[290][291] He has been named league MVP twice, including the first unanimous selection in league history (2015–16).[83] Known for his three-point shooting, athleticism, and playmaking, Curry is an offensive threat from underneath the rim to near half-court.[292][293] Using an unorthodox jump shot, he is capable of releasing the ball in under half a second upon jumping, adding greater arc to his shots and making them difficult to block.[294] Therefore, Curry is able to adjust his release and balance to make shots from virtually anywhere on the court. For his high shooting proficiency and ball-handling, he has been referred to as the \"Baby-Faced Assassin\" since his collegiate basketball years[295] and \"Chef Curry\" while playing in the NBA.[296] For their shooting abilities, Curry and former teammate Klay Thompson are often referred to as the Splash Brothers. In the 2013–14 season, they set the record for combined three-pointers made in a season with 484, a record they broke the following season (525), and again in the 2015–16 season (678).[297] Curry is also known for putting pressure on defenses with his long range and led the league in field goals made from beyond 28 feet in the 2015–16 season.[298] A clutch scorer, he often shoots at his best in high-pressure moments and takes game-winning shots.[299][300] Curry has made 10 game-winning shots[d] in his career, the most by any player since the 2012–13 season.[302] He was named the 2023–24 NBA Clutch Player of the Year after leading the league in clutch points, made clutch field goals, and made clutch three-pointers.[301] His career three-point field goal percentage (3P%) of .425% ranks as the 12th highest in NBA history.[303] In 2015–16, Curry posted the highest eFG% (.630) and 3P% (.454) ever recorded in a season while averaging over 30 points per game.[304] He holds four of the top-five seasons with most three-pointers made, led by his NBA record 402 three-pointers from the 2015–16 season, and has served as the annual leader a record eight times.[305][306] He is also the fastest player in league history to make 2,000 career three-pointers, doing so in 227 fewer games than the previous record-holder, Ray Allen.[146] Additionally, Curry is the fastest player to make 100 three-pointers in a season, doing so in just 19 games, breaking his own previous record of 20 games.[307] Owing to his offensive presence, Curry's scoring creates a \"gravity\" effect that forces opposing defenders to frequently double-team him during both on-ball and off-ball movement, creating mismatches that his teammates exploit.[308][309] With Curry, the Warriors average 10.8 isolations per game; without Curry, they average 15.3 isolations per game. His absence slows the Warriors offense and leads to less passing and ball movement. With Curry, the Warriors average 1.05 points every shot that comes after an off-ball screen; without Curry, it drops to 0.95 points per game. His absence makes it much easier for defenders to switch on screens. Of Curry's success with or without other elite teammates, NBC Sports' Tom Haberstroh said, \"You can pluck All-Star after All-Star off the court like flower petals, and the Steph-led Warriors will still dominate like a champion. He's that transcendent of a player.\"[310] Curry's short stature relative to the rest of the league impeded his defensive abilities for the majority of his career.[311][312] With a low center of gravity, he leverages his fast pace and reflexes to break defenses.[312] Some analysts, including Ethan Sherwood Strauss of ESPN, have complimented his defensive play or called it underrated.[311][313] Strauss said in 2015 that Curry became \"one of the NBA's most effective defenders – ranking fifth among point guards in defensive real plus-minus.\"[313] Curry led the league in total steals in the 2014–15 season and steals per game in the following season.[314] Curry is often considered the greatest shooter[2][3] and one of the greatest players in NBA history.[4][315][316] He is credited with revolutionizing the game of basketball by inspiring teams, from high school to the NBA, to regularly use the three-point shot.[5][6][7] Analysts have referred to him as \"the Michael Jordan of the three-point era\", saying that he did for the three-point shot what Jordan did for the slam dunk.[317][318][319] The Guardian's Robert O'Connell cites Curry's February 27, 2013, game against the New York Knicks, in which he made 11-of-13 shots from behind the arc en route to a 54-point performance, as the start of the three-point era.[320] The era has been referred to as \"the Steph Effect\"[7] or \"the NBA's Three-Point Revolution\".[321] Curry is also often compared to Magic Johnson in debates over the greatest point guard of all time, owing to their generational impact, winningness, and diverse skillsets.[322][323][324] Regarded as the face of the Warriors dynasty,[325][326] Curry helped redefine three-point scoring as a central element of modern-day basketball strategy rather than a mere novelty.[316][327] His influence has inspired the league to transition from physical play around the basket to a \"pace and space\" approach that emphasizes three-point shooting.[327] This transformation can be attributed, in part, to teams attempting to counter the Warriors' dominance and young players aspiring to emulate Curry's range.[7][320] Curry regularly attempts shots from 30 to 35 feet at an efficiency of .54, compared to the league average of under .22 from this range and .35 for made three-pointers overall.[316] Kirk Goldsberry of ESPN opined that \"Curry isn't just the best 3-point shooter ever, he's the best deep 3-point shooter ever.\"[316] As Curry himself noted, \"I'm sure coaches tell their high school players that shooting the way I do takes work and time;\" Jesse Dougherty of The Washington Post stated that \"coaches have to explain that while Curry's skill set is something to aspire to, his game is built on fundamentals.\"[7] His ability to make these shots is complemented by a high degree of ball-handling skills, release, and capacity to shoot effectively with one or more defenders contesting his attempts.[316] Sally Jenkins, also of The Washington Post, highlighted the degree of difficulty of Curry's shooting, citing a period in which he achieved a .67 success rate on shots taken from 28 to 50 feet.[293] Jeff Austin of Octagon noted that Curry \"had to develop tremendous strength in his wrists to shoot and maintain that form from 40 and 50 feet.\"[293] Goldsberry concludes that \"no player in the history of the NBA has combined range, volume, and efficiency from downtown as well as Curry,\" making him \"the most efficient volume scorer on the planet.\"[316] The developers of the NBA 2K video game series have even expressed concerns about accurately replicating Curry's unique abilities.[327] Where Curry ranks as one of the greatest NBA players has been more subject to debate.[328] Steve Nash, a two-time NBA MVP and one of the league's all-time efficient shooters, said Curry is \"already an all-time great\" and that people question his greatness \"because he doesn't dominate the game physically. He dances. He pays a tax for that. He pays a tax for his great teammates.\"[328] Scottie Pippen, a six-time NBA champion with the Chicago Bulls, said that Curry's \"willingness to sacrifice\" for Durant is \"one of the great stories in history.\" Crediting Curry as \"one of the greatest guards the game has ever seen\", he said: \"If you have a mind for the game, you know that it takes sacrifice to be great. All the greats have to sacrifice something. Otherwise you can't win.\"[328] In 2018, CBS Sports ranked Curry at No. 19 in their list of \"50 greatest NBA players of all time\".[329] In a 2019 feature, Sports Illustrated stated that \"Curry and the Warriors are a great match of player and system\" and that \"the entire ecosystem is predicated on the idea that a player doesn't need to dominate the ball to dominate a game. Curry took that noble idea and elevated it beyond any reasonable expectation.\"[330] In 2020, ESPN ranked Curry as the 13th greatest basketball player of all time, the second-highest active player behind LeBron James. Nick Friedell of ESPN described Curry as \"the greatest shooter of all time\", noting his game-changing influence \"is seen on every level of basketball as younger generations shoot more than ever while trying to replicate his game.\"[331] In October 2021, Curry was honored as one of the league's greatest players of all time as a member of the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.[332] In an \"NBA 75\" feature, Marcus Thompson II of The Athletic opined that \"in 20 years, Curry will be talked about with excitement reserved for the most legendary. Like the elders of today talk about Abdul-Jabbar and Bill Russell, and how their children revere Larry Bird and Charles Barkley.\"[333] After winning his fourth NBA championship and first Finals MVP award in 2022, Complex ranked Curry as the 10th greatest player in NBA history the following year. Angel Diaz cited his generational impact with \"nothing left (for Curry) to accomplish\" as reasons for his place among the sport's greats.[334] On July 30, 2011, Curry married longtime girlfriend and Toronto-area native Ayesha Alexander in Charlotte.[15][16][335] Curry and Alexander met at their church in Charlotte when they were 15 and 14 years old, respectively.[336] Together, they have two daughters who were born in 2012 and 2015,[337][338] and two sons who were born in 2018 and 2024, respectively.[339][340] In July 2019, Curry paid $31 million for a home in Atherton, California.[341] Curry's younger brother, Seth, is also a professional basketball player,[342] and his younger sister, Sydel, played volleyball at Elon University.[343] Curry is a Pentecostal Christian and has been outspoken about his faith.[344][345] He spoke about his faith during his MVP speech by saying: \"People should know who I represent and why I am who I am, and that's because of my Lord and Savior.\" He also said the reason that he pounds his chest and points up is that he has a \"heart for God\" and as a reminder that he plays for God.[346] On some of his \"Curry One\" basketball shoes, there is a lace loop scripted \"4:13\". It is a reference to the Bible verse Philippians 4:13, which reads: \"I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.\"[347][348] Curry has a tattoo of First Corinthians 13:8 in Hebrew on his wrist (\"Love never fails...\").[349] Curry is also an investor in Active Faith, a Christian sports apparel brand.[350][351] During the 1992 NBA All-Star Game weekend, Curry's father entrusted him to Biserka Petrović, mother of future Hall of Fame player Dražen Petrović, while Dell competed in the Three-Point Contest. Following the 2015 NBA Finals, Curry gave Biserka one of his Finals-worn jerseys, which will reportedly be added to the collection of the Dražen Petrović Memorial Center, a museum to the late player in the Croatian capital of Zagreb.[352] Curry is diagnosed with keratoconus and wears contact lenses to correct his vision.[353] He is also an avid golfer; he started playing golf at the age of 10, played golf in high school, and frequently plays golf with former teammate Andre Iguodala.[354][355][356] A 5-handicap golfer, Curry participates in celebrity golf tournaments and has played golf alongside Barack Obama.[357][358][359] In August 2017, Curry competed in the Ellie Mae Classic on an unrestricted sponsor exemption.[360] Although he missed the first cut, he scored 4-over-74 for both days he participated, surpassing most expectations for an amateur competing in the pro event.[361] In July 2023, Curry won the American Century Championship, an annual celebrity golf tournament held at the Edgewood Tahoe Resort in Stateline, Nevada. He shot a hole-in-one during the second round and won the tournament on the final hole with a walk-off eagle putt.[362] In August 2019, Curry and Howard University, a historically black institution in Washington, D.C., jointly announced that the school would add NCAA Division I teams in men's and women's golf starting in the 2020–21 school year, with Curry guaranteeing full funding of both teams for six years.[363] Curry is also a fan of English soccer club Chelsea F.C.[364][365] \"No NBA athlete has a larger contingent of fans at every arena, lining up 20- and 30-deep hoping for a glimpse, if not an autograph. This crazy popularity is why his jersey sales consistently rank No. 1, why he was voted to be the captain of the [2018] Western Conference All-Star team and why 9-year-old girls feel comfortable enough to write letters asking for his help – and actually get it.\" Curry is one of the most successful players in the NBA, and has also become an international celebrity, on par with four-time MVP LeBron James.[367][368] Like James, he has been considered the face of the NBA, but has said that he is not motivated by that and is not looking \"to take LeBron's throne or whatever. You know, I'm trying to chase rings, and that's all I'm about. So that's where the conversation stops for me.\"[369] His flashy play and penchant for coming up big in the clutch have made him a fan favorite, and his smaller physique is said to have made his success seem more attainable for younger fans of the NBA.[370][371] Memorabilia associated with Curry is highly sought after; his 2009 rookie card ranks among the most expensive sports cards of all-time and is the most expensive basketball card ever sold, purchased by Alt Fund II for a record $5.9 million in July 2021.[372][373] Curry has led the NBA in jersey sales for five cumulative years; three consecutive times from the 2015–16 to 2017–18 seasons and two consecutive times from the 2022–23 to 2023–24 seasons, respectively.[374][375] ESPN has ranked Curry among the most famous international athletes. He is the highest paid NBA player of all-time by season and has been ranked in Forbes' list of the world's highest-paid celebrities for his endorsements six times.[376][377] ESPN's Kirk Goldsberry reasoned that one reason for Curry's popularity is that while most people are not tall enough to dunk, everyone can attempt a shot, which is something Curry inspires.[316] Owen Davis of Sky Sports echoed this sentiment, stating: \"After all, not everyone is blessed with supreme height and athleticism, but everyone can learn to pass, dribble and shoot. Curry is proof that if you work hard enough, you can still find ways to dominate, no matter your size.\"[327] Monte Poole of NBC Sports found Curry to be \"the most human of superstars,\" with a childlike aura to him when he plays with success. His fanbase ranges from very young children to the elderly, and casual or committed fans enjoy his style of play. Poole stated that \"the joy factor exponentially increases\" when Curry is on the court and that \"the sight of this relatively ordinary specimen sending much bigger players into silent surrender is an intoxicant for the Warriors and their fans.\"[366] Curry is widely known for his partnership with Under Armour, serving as the \"face of their footwear line\" and the President of his signature shoe and apparel line called the \"Curry Brand\".[378] Originally signed to Nike, Curry began a partnership with Under Armour in the 2013 offseason.[379] After becoming the NBA MVP and one of the most popular athletes in the world, sales of Curry's shoe line became an influential factor for the brand, with stock prices pivoting based on its success.[380][381] In September 2017, it was announced that Curry had signed an exclusive autograph contract with Steiner Sports Memorabilia. The full product line included hand-signed official basketballs and jerseys, autographed photographs, framed signs and wall-art, game-used memorabilia, and limited-edition pieces.[382] In October 2018, Curry announced his involvement with the relaunch of Palm, a mobile companion device that pairs with a primary smartphone.[383] Curry is an investor and the leading brand ambassador for Palm, a small startup based in San Francisco which licenses the Palm name from TCL Corporation. He is also involved with designing and testing accessories and even helped to name the device.[384] In 2021, Curry, among other high-profile athletes and celebrities, was a paid spokesperson for FTX, a cryptocurrency exchange. In November 2022, FTX filed for bankruptcy, erasing billions of dollars in customer funds, with Curry, alongside other spokespeople, being sued for promoting unregistered securities through a class-action lawsuit.[385][386][387] In February 2022, the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in a lawsuit against Bitconnect that the Securities Act of 1933 extends to targeted solicitation using social media.[388] Since 2018, Curry has served as the chief executive officer of Thirty Ink, a San Francisco-based company that works to provide equitable opportunities to people through brand, media, experiences, and philanthropy, as the four major verticals. Since 2019, Curry has been the Global Brand Ambassador for Rakuten. The company partnered with Curry on a one-day shopping spree at the Warriors Shop in Chase Center for 20 Bay Area children. Curry posed as a team shop employee during the event and helped find sports gear around the store.[389] In 2012, Curry started donating three insecticide-treated mosquito nets for every three-pointer he made to the United Nations Foundation's Nothing But Nets campaign to combat malaria. He was first introduced to the malaria cause by Davidson teammate Bryant Barr when they were both in school. Curry visited the White House in 2015 and delivered a five-minute speech to dignitaries as part of President Barack Obama's launch of his President's Malaria Initiative strategy for 2015–2020.[390][391] In 2015, Curry wore sneakers that bore the name \"Deah Shaddy Barakat\"—a victim of the 2015 Chapel Hill shooting. According to his sister Suzanne, Deah was known for his \"love for basketball and anything Steph Curry.\"[392] Deah donned Curry's No. 30 as his jersey number for his intramural basketball team at North Carolina State University, and recreated Curry's pose from his GQ photoshoot.[392] Curry said that Deah's family \"did a great job of reaching out to me and making me aware of the details of his life and personality ... It was really kind of a cool deal to be able to use the platform yesterday to honor Deah and his family ... I'm going to send them the shoes I wore yesterday. And hopefully, they know that I've been thinking about them.\"[393][394][395] Following his MVP award win and historic 2015–16 season, Curry donated his prize vehicle—a 2016 Kia Sorento—to the East Oakland Youth Development Center, a local non-profit organization located in the backyard of Oracle Arena.[396] In December 2018, while on a podcast, Curry jokingly questioned whether the Apollo program's Moon landing actually took place, which received substantial media attention and criticism. NASA went on to offer Curry a tour of the Johnson Space Center and discuss further. He partnered with Under Armour in creating signature shoes inspired by the comment and subsequent discussion.

                "content": "Our editors will review what you’ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article. Stephen Curry (born March 14, 1988, Akron, Ohio, U.S.) is an American professional basketball player who led the Golden State Warriors of the National Basketball Association (NBA) to championships in 2014–15, 2016–17, 2017–18, and 2021–22 and to the best regular-season record in league history (73–9) in 2015–16. Curry grew up immersed in basketball as the son of 16-year NBA veteran sharpshooter Dell Curry. The younger Curry learned the intricacies of the game from his father. His keen shooting and high “basketball IQ” were not enough to persuade college coaches to overlook his wiry frame and unremarkable 6-foot (1.8-meter) height. He did not receive scholarship offers from major college basketball programs and attended Davidson (North Carolina) College, which had an enrollment of fewer than 2,000 students. He quickly made his mark, however, averaging 21.5 points per game as a freshman to lead all first-year players in the country. Curry became a national sensation during his sophomore season, when he led 10th-seeded Davidson on an improbable run to the Elite Eight of the National Collegiate Athletic Association men’s top-division basketball championship tournament in a performance that featured what would soon be recognized as his signature shot: a three-pointer from well outside the line. His junior season did not feature any such postseason heroics, but his average of 28.6 points per game led the country, and he was named a consensus first-team All-American. Curry, who by then was 6 feet 2 inches (1.88 meters) tall, entered the 2009 NBA draft, in which he was selected by the Warriors with the seventh overall pick. Curry made an immediate impact with the Warriors, becoming the team’s starting point guard and averaging 17.5 points per game in his first season. A series of ankle sprains led to Curry’s playing just 26 games in the 2011–12 season, and he underwent off-season ligament surgery. He then signed a modest four-year $44 million contract extension that allowed Golden State to surround its budding star with other talented players. Curry led the league in three-pointers made (272) in 2012–13. The following season he repeated that feat (with 261) and earned his first All-Star selection. In 2014–15 he made a then-record 286 three-pointers while leading the Warriors to an NBA-best 67–15 record and was named the league’s Most Valuable Player (MVP). In the following postseason, Curry propelled the Warriors to the franchise’s first title in 40 years over the Cleveland Cavaliers. Curry led his team to even greater heights in 2015–16, as Golden State bested the 1995–96 Chicago Bulls’ 72–10 regular-season record by one additional victory. He also topped the NBA with an average of 30.1 points per game and shattered his own league standard by making an astounding 402 three-point shots. Curry earned his second consecutive MVP award for his efforts and became the first person to be voted MVP unanimously. However, the Warriors’ historic season ultimately ended in shocking disappointment as the team surrendered a 3–1 NBA finals lead to the Cavaliers. In 2016–17 Curry led the NBA in three-point field goals made (324) for a fifth straight season as the Warriors again led the NBA in wins (67). Golden State then ran off an unprecedented 12 straight victories to open the postseason and won a third consecutive Western Conference title. The Warriors finally had a postseason loss in game four of the NBA finals, but the team rebounded to defeat the Cavaliers in five games to capture Curry’s second NBA title. A knee injury limited Curry to 51 games during the 2017–18 regular season, ending his five-year run as the league leader in three-point field goals attempted and made. He returned during the second round of the playoffs to help the Warriors win their fourth consecutive conference championship and third NBA title (in a four-game sweep of the Cavaliers). Curry continued his dazzling play in 2018–19, averaging 27.3 points per game and earning first-team All-NBA honors. In the playoffs, he guided an injury-plagued Warriors team to a fifth straight conference title, the most in a row since the NBA instituted conferences in 1970–71. However, additional injuries and inspired play by the opposing Toronto Raptors led to a six-game Golden State loss in the finals. The Warriors entered the 2019–20 season shorthanded after losing fellow All-Stars Kevin Durant (departure via free agency) and Klay Thompson (season-ending injury during the 2019 finals). Curry himself played in just five games during that campaign after breaking his hand early in the season, which led to the Warriors having a league-worst record. Curry returned to form and had a fantastic 2020–21 season, leading the NBA with 32 points per game, but the team missed the playoffs despite having a winning record. In December 2021 Curry made yet another mark in the NBA history books by scoring his 2,974th career three-pointer, breaking the NBA record for all-time three-point field goals scored. Following another season-ending injury in 2020, Thompson rejoined the team in 2021–22 and helped the Warriors finally return to form, as Golden State won 53 games and qualified for the postseason. There, the team—and Curry—regained their dominance, losing just six games during the NBA playoffs to win a fourth title during Curry’s era, and he was named finals MVP after scoring 31.2 points per game during the six-game series win over the Boston Celtics. His strong play continued in 2022–23, but the Warriors lost in the conference semifinals. The team missed the playoffs the following season. Curry occasionally played on the U.S. men’s national basketball team. He helped the squad win the gold medal at the 2010 FIBA World Championship and at the 2014 FIBA World Cup. Curry made his Olympic debut at the 2024 Paris Games. The U.S. team advanced to the gold-medal game, and Curry scored 24 points, including four three-pointers late in the fourth quarter, to help the United States defeat France, 98–87. In 2011 Curry married Ayesha Alexander, an actress who later wrote several popular cookbooks. The couple have four children: daughters Riley (2012) and Ryan (2015) and sons Canon (2018) and Caius (2024).",

                "content": "Professional basketball player Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors was the first person to be named Most Valuable Player by unanimous vote in NBA history. (1988-) Stephen Curry is a professional American basketball player with the Golden State Warriors. The son of former NBA player Dell Curry, Stephen first garnered national attention for his impressive play at Davidson College. He was drafted in 2009 by Golden State and eventually developed into one of pro basketball's top players with his stellar shooting skills. After garnering Most Valuable Player honors and helping the Warriors win the NBA championship in 2015, Curry led the team to a league-record 73 wins the following season. In May 2016, Curry became the first person to be named MVP by unanimous vote in NBA history, and one of only 11 players to win the MVP award two years in a row. He then helped the Warriors win the NBA title again in 2017 and 2018, both times over the Cleveland Cavaliers. Stephen Curry was born Wardell Stephen Curry II in Akron, Ohio on March 14, 1988, but mainly grew up in Charlotte, North Carolina. The oldest son of former NBA player Dell Curry, Curry learned the fundamentals of basketball by watching and practicing with his father. However, it was mom Sonya, a former Division I volleyball star, who instilled the discipline to train in her son while Dell Sr. was with his team on road trips. Curry has two siblings. His younger brother, Seth Curry, went on to a career in professional basketball after starting at Duke University. Stephen’s sister Sydel became a volleyball player at Elon University. Lightly recruited by major college basketball programs despite a standout career at Charlotte Christian School, Curry enrolled at tiny Davidson College near his hometown. He immediately showcased his skills by scoring 32 points against the University of Michigan in his second game and wound up earning Southern Conference freshman of the year honors. \"Make it work no matter what you have to work with – that’s something that stuck with me very early on as a point guard. Adjust. Get creative. Try a different angle, a different lane, a different move or a different shot – just make it work.\" - Stephen Curry Curry became a national star in March of his sophomore year when he carried the Wildcats to a berth in the regional finals of the NCAA tournament with a series of high-scoring performances. After leading the nation with an average of 28.6 points per game as a college junior in 2009, Curry was selected with the seventh pick of the NBA Draft by the Golden State Warriors. Despite his slight frame and boyish looks, Curry proved more than capable of handling the NBA opposition with his shooting and ball-handling abilities. As a guard, he averaged more than 22 points per game after the 2010 All-Star break and wound up finishing second in the Rookie of the Year balloting. His impressive play earned him a spot on the USA Men's Basketball Senior National Team, which won the gold medal at the 2010 World Championships. Curry sustained a sprained ankle while practicing with the national team, an injury that lingered for the following two seasons. A return to full health allowed him to regain his dazzling form in 2012-13, and Curry responded by setting an NBA record with 272 three-pointers. Named the Western Conference Player of the Month in April, he followed by leading the Warriors to an upset against the Denver Nuggets in the first round of the playoffs. After earning his first All-Star nod in 2014, Curry reached new levels of performance and popularity the following season. As one half of the \"Splash Brothers\" duo, which also featured sharpshooting guard Klay Thompson, Curry led an exciting Warriors team to an early 16-game win streak and was the leading vote-getter for the 2015 All-Star Game. Curry capped a memorable season by helping the Warriors knock off LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers in the NBA Finals, giving the team its first championship since 1975. For an encore, Curry helped the Warriors to 24 consecutive wins out of the starting gate in the 2015-16 season, a torrid pace that propelled the team to an NBA-record 73 wins. The superstar guard again demonstrated his unparalleled skills throughout the season, finishing with an astounding 402 three-pointers and league-high 30.1 points per game. Despite his accomplishments, Curry knew that the personal and team records would be for naught if Golden State couldn't repeat as champions. The Warriors were put to the test when Curry suffered ankle and knee injuries early in the playoffs, but he returned to score a record 17 overtime points in Game 4 of the Western Conference semifinals, before sparking a comeback win in the following round over the Oklahoma City Thunder. However, his quest for a second straight title fell just short when a long season came to a close with a 93-89 loss to the Cavaliers in Game 7 of the 2016 NBA Finals. In 2017, Curry helped lead the Warriors to a Finals matchup with James and the Cavaliers once again. In Game 5, Curry scored 34 points and teammate Kevin Durant added another 39 points in a 129-120 victory, for the Warriors' second NBA championship in three years. The victory was sweet and long-awaited for Curry. After the Warriors' 2016 loss, he had asked a friend to save a cigar for him so he could smoke it when the team won back the title. Curry lit up his cigar live on NBA TV. \"I've been waiting a whole year to smoke this,\" Curry said. Expected to contend for the title with his teammates again in 2018, Curry instead encountered a setback by way of an MCL sprain late in the regular season, his absence leaving the Warriors on shakier ground heading into the playoffs. But the superstar guard returned in the second round to finish off the New Orleans Pelicans and then helped put away the top-seeded Houston Rockets for the Western Conference crown. Game 1 of the fourth straight Warriors-Cavaliers Finals went down to the wire before Curry helped his team pull away in overtime with a game-high 33 points. Three games later, the veteran guard again topped the field with 37 points as the Warriors finished off the sweep to claim their third NBA title in four years. In 2015, Curry set a new record with 286 three-pointers and led the league in steals, an impressive all-around display that garnered him the Most Valuable Player Award. In May 2016, Curry became the first person to be named Most Valuable Player by unanimous vote in NBA history, and one of only 11 players to win the MVP award two years in a row. \"I never really set out to change the game. I never thought that would happen in my career,\" Curry said after receiving the MVP honor. \"What I wanted to do was just be myself. ... I know it inspires a lot of the next generation, a lot of people who love the game of basketball to value the skill of it, value the fact that you can work every single day to get better. You've got to be able to put the time and the work. That's how I got here, that's how I continue to get better every single day.\" Although Curry enjoyed a stellar 2018-19 campaign with an average of 27.3 points per game, there were signs of turmoil within the NBA's reigning dynasty. Golden State still managed to advance to the 2019 NBA Finals, though Curry was unable to lift his team in the wake of injuries to Durant and Thompson, and the Warriors lost to the Toronto Raptors in six games. Having bid farewell to Durant in free agency, the Warriors prepared to start a new chapter in 2019-20 with the move to the Chase Center in San Francisco. However, the team's hopes of competing suffered a serious blow when Curry broke his hand just four games into the season, an injury that knocked him out of action until early March 2020. According to the NBA, at of the end of the 2018-19 regular season, Curry’s career stats are: In 2012, Curry signed a four-year contract extension with the Golden State Warriors. Curry’s $12.1 yearly salary made him just the 85th-highest paid NBA player in the 2016-17 season, despite his two-time MVP status. However, in June 2017, Curry made up for his previous bargain rate and then some by signing the NBA’s highest-paid contract ever: a $201 million salary over five years that will take him through the 2020-21 season. Curry has signed endorsement deals with Under Armour, JPMorgan Chase, Brita, Vivo and PressPlay. In April 2018, it was announced that Curry's newly formed production company, Unanimous Media, had signed a deal with Sony Pictures Entertainment. The arrangement gives Sony first-look rights at Unanimous' film and TV projects, which reportedly will focus on faith, family and sports-related content. \"I've been blessed to have this platform and I want to use it to affect the world positively,\" said Curry said in a statement. \"Partnering with Sony to share inspiring content with a global audience was a foregone conclusion.\" Since his time as a student at Davidson, Curry has been involved with the United Nations Foundation Nothing But Nets campaign, which distributes insecticide-treated mosquito nets across Africa to help combat malaria. The NBA star also raises resources for schools through the Stephen Curry Foundation and annually hosts a pair of charity golf events. Curry married his college sweetheart, Ayesha Alexander, on July 30, 2011. Born on March 23, 1989, in Toronto, Canada, Ayesha Curry is an entrepreneur and former actress known for the TV series Ballers and as the host of the cooking show Ayesha's Home Kitchen. The Currys have two daughters. On July 19, 2012, they welcomed their first, named Riley. Their second daughter, Ryan, was born on July 10, 2015. Three years later on July 4, 2018, Ayesha gave birth to their first son, Canon W. Jack. We strive for accuracy and fairness. If you see something that doesn't look right, contact us!

Son Heung-min scored a spectacular goal directly from a corner to fire Tottenham into the English League Cup semifinals in a thrilling 4-3 win over Manchester United on Thursday. Spurs will play Premier League leader Liverpool for a place in the final, and Arsenal was drawn against Newcastle in the other last-four matchup. Son’s strike in the 88th-minute at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium came as Spurs tried to hold off a dramatic comeback from United, having led 3-0 in the second half. United had pulled it back to 3-2 and was pushing for an equalizer when Son whipped in a curling right-footed shot past goalkeeper Altay Bayindir. “Obviously we made it harder than it should have been, for sure,\" Tottenham manager Ange Postecoglou said and added, “Are you not entertained?” United’s players complained Bayindir had been fouled by Tottenham’s Lucas Bergvall as Son’s shot flew past him. Replays appeared to show contact between the two, but with no VAR at this stage of the competition, there was no chance of a review. Jonny Evans scored again for United in stoppage time, but Spurs held on for the win that had looked all but certain shortly after halftime. Having gone ahead through Dominic Solanke’s goal from close range in the 15th, Tottenham took control after the break. Dejan Kulusevski doubled the lead a minute after the restart and Solanke fired in his second in the 54th. United head coach Ruben Amorim made a triple substitution — bringing on Joshua Zirkzee, Amad Diallo and Kobbie Mainoo. It quickly had an impact with Zirkzee forcing Fraser Forster into a flying save and then capitalizing on a loose pass by the Tottenham goalkeeper to make it 3-1. Forster was guilty of another mistake in the 70th when his attempted clearance was closed down by Diallo and ricocheted over the line. United increased the pressure, but Son’s unlikely goal gave Spurs a cushion again — and it proved to be the decisive strike after Evans’ late header reduced the deficit again. “I know the studio (punditry team) is probably going into meltdown over my lack of tactics,” Postecoglou said. “I love the fact that we go out there and take it to oppositions.” ___ James Robson is at https://twitter.com/jamesalanrobson ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer © 2024 All rights reserved.",

                "content": "Robert Wood Johnson IV (born April 12, 1947) is an American businessman who is co-owner of the New York Jets and was formerly the United States ambassador to the United Kingdom from 2017 to 2021. He is a great-grandson of Robert Wood Johnson I, and an heir to the Johnson & Johnson pharmaceutical fortune. In 2000 he purchased the New York Jets football team for $635 million, the highest price for a New York professional sports team at that time, and is currently the Jets co-owner alongside his brother, Christopher Johnson. During his tenure as owner, Johnson was also part of the NFL search committee for a new commissioner. A longtime Republican Party donor, Johnson was a supporter of Donald Trump's presidential campaign, and was appointed by Trump to the post of United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom. Events during his tenure included Britain's exit from the EU and the relocation of the United States embassy in London. His brother Christopher took over Jets operations during his post. Upon his return in 2021, Johnson resumed his role as chairman. In 2023, he pursued Aaron Rodgers, with the Jets finalizing a trade with the Green Bay Packers in April. In 2022, Johnson made a £2 billion bid for Chelsea F.C. but withdrew from the bidding process later that month. Johnson was born in New Brunswick, New Jersey, the son of Betty Johnson (née Wold; 1921–2020)[1] and Robert Wood Johnson III, and the great-grandson of Robert Wood Johnson I, who founded the Johnson & Johnson pharmaceutical company,[2][3] along with his brothers James Wood Johnson and Edward Mead Johnson.[4] Robert Wood Johnson IV grew up with four siblings: Keith Johnson, Billy Johnson, Elizabeth \"Libet\" Johnson, and Christopher Wold Johnson, in northern New Jersey, and attended the Millbrook School. He graduated from the University of Arizona.[5][6] He worked for J&J for a single summer.[7] Johnson was the chairman and chief executive of The Johnson Company, Inc., a private investment firm.[8] In 2006, a Senate subcommittee produced a 370-page report that said that some prominent figures, including Johnson, purchased capital gain losses as a way to reduce their own income tax bills. Johnson settled with the IRS in 2006, agreeing to pay the owed taxes plus interest.[9] Johnson was the committee president of the Pre-Commissioning Unit for the San Antonio-class ship USS New York (LPD-21).[10] In January 2000, Woody Johnson purchased the New York Jets for $635 million, making it the third-highest price ever paid for a professional sports team at the time, and the highest for a New York professional sports team.[11] As of September 2019, Forbes valued the team at $3.2 billion.[12] Following his acquisition of the Jets, Johnson moved the team to the newly constructed Meadowlands Stadium, sharing it as an equal partner with the New York Giants. The stadium, later named MetLife Stadium, officially opened on April 10, 2010.[13] In 2017, upon being appointed the U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Johnson's brother, Christopher Johnson, assumed the roles of CEO and acting owner of the Jets.[14] Woody Johnson resumed his position as chairman in 2021 after returning to the United States, with Christopher Johnson becoming vice-chairman.[15][16] In January 2023, Johnson expressed the need for a strong quarterback to complement the Jets' robust defense, describing it as the \"missing piece\" in the team's lineup.[17] Subsequently, Johnson pursued four-time MVP Aaron Rodgers, stating to ESPN the importance of securing the best possible quarterback to lead the team.[18][19] The Jets also hired Nathaniel Hackett as offensive coordinator, given his strong rapport with Rodgers.[20] On April 24, 2023, it was reported that the Jets were finalizing a trade deal with the Green Bay Packers for Rodgers.[21] In March 2022, Johnson made a £2 billion bid to purchase London football club Chelsea F.C. from sanctioned billionaire Roman Abramovich.[22][23] Johnson, who became a fan of the team during his ambassadorship in London, was considered to have an advantage over other bidders like Saudi Media Group due to his familiarity with London and experience in sports management.[24][25] However, by March 25, it was reported that Johnson was no longer in contention to buy Chelsea F.C.[26] Johnson also helped the league select a successor to NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue.[27][28] Johnson is a billionaire.[29][7] As a fourth-generation descendant of one of the founders of the Johnson & Johnson company, he is one of the heirs of the Johnson family fortune.[7][a] In a 2017 financial disclosure form, Johnson listed his net worth at $4.2 billion, with most of his wealth tied to his ownership of the Jets and its stadium; he also reported owning at least 1.56 million J&J shares (a stake then valued at more than $50 million).[30] As of April 2024, the Bloomberg Billionaires Index placed his net worth at an estimated $9.92 billion.[7] By the year 2000, Johnson had given more than $1 million to various Republican candidates and committees. Between 1997 and 1998, he donated $130,000 to the Republican Party, along with donating $22,583 to George W. Bush's 1998 gubernatorial re-election campaign of Texas. He was later a major New York fundraiser for Bush's 2000 presidential campaign.[31] In May 2008, he orchestrated a fundraiser in New York City that brought in $7 million in a single evening for John McCain's presidential campaign, by far the largest amount collected up to that point by a campaign that had been struggling to raise money. Johnson also provided significant funding to 2008 Republican National Convention host committee; from a $10 million shortfall, Johnson contributed personally and solicited friends to assist in covering the convention deficit.[32] In 2011, Johnson endorsed former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney in the 2012 Republican presidential primaries.[33] In September 2013, Johnson hosted a fundraiser for the Republican National Committee (RNC) at his home in New York City.[34] By 2016, Johnson had known Donald Trump for about 30 years, with the two men having social connections.[35] Nevertheless, in the 2016 Republican presidential primaries, Johnson initially endorsed Jeb Bush over Trump.[35] In June 2015, Johnson was named the national finance chairman for Bush's campaign.[36] On several occasions, Trump singled out Johnson in a speech attacking Bush for accepting \"special interest\" money from donors.[35][37] In May 2016, after Trump became the presumptive nominee, Johnson endorsed Trump for president.[38][35][2] He met with Trump at Trump Tower and was named one of the RNC's six finance vice chairmen, responsible for an effort to raise $1 billion on behalf of Trump's campaign.[35][37] Johnson had by August 2019 donated $1.5 million to Donald Trump's presidential campaigns and inaugural committee.[39] In February 2020, Johnson gave $575,000 to a fundraising committee for Trump's 2020 re-election campaign, and $355,000 to the RNC.[40] In May 2020, he gave $1 million to America First Action, Inc., a pro-Trump super PAC.[40] On January 8, 2021, Johnson released a statement condemning the 2021 United States Capitol attack.[41] In 2023, Johnson gave at least $1 million to a super PAC backing Trump's 2024 presidential campaign.[42][43] He stood behind Trump at an election-night rally during the 2024 South Carolina primary.[44] On January 19, 2017, President-elect Donald Trump announced that he planned to nominate Johnson to become United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom.[45][46] On June 22, 2017, Trump nominated Johnson for the position.[47][48][49] Prior to becoming ambassador, he had no diplomatic experience.[2] Following a hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee,[50] Johnson was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on August 3, 2017,[51] by voice vote.[48] He was sworn in by Vice President Mike Pence on August 21, 2017, in the Oval Office. Johnson presented his credentials to Queen Elizabeth II on November 8, 2017.[52][53] In 2018, Johnson oversaw the relocation of the United States Embassy in London from Grosvenor Square, where it had been since 1938, to a new location in Nine Elms.[54] During Johnson's tenure, Britain withdrew from the EU. Johnson advocated for a bilateral US-UK trade deal post-Brexit, in line with President Trump's hopes during that time.[55] Johnson had a private dinner with Queen Elizabeth II at Winfield House on March 14, 2019, just two days after British Parliament rejected Theresa May's Brexit plan.[56] In June 2019, he further stated that a post-Brexit deal between the US and the UK would cover \"all things that are traded\", including the National Health Service and agricultural sector.[57] In January 2020, Johnson stated that the US was never interested in the NHS, but reiterated American interest in a free-trade deal with the UK.[58] Johnson advocated for closer agricultural trade between the US and UK, and the deregulation of US food exports to Britain.[59] In March 2019, Johnson wrote an article in the Daily Telegraph saying that chlorinated chicken was a \"public safety no-brainer\" and that health fears over hormone-fed beef were \"myths\".[60] This came after he urged the UK to open up to the US agriculture market after the British exit from the European Union and ignore the \"smear campaign\" of those with \"their own protectionist agenda\".[61] Johnson was criticized by several British agriculture standard boards, such as the Red Tractor Assurance whose CEO, Jim Moseley stated the UK's food standards were \"now under threat from ... the United States food lobby\".[62][61] Minette Batters, president of the UK National Farmers Union, agreed with Johnson's claims that chlorine-rinsed chicken was safe for consumption, but stated that factors such as animal welfare and environmental protection also had to be considered.[63] Batters commented that accepting US agricultural products produced in ways that would be illegal in the UK would \"put British producers out of business\". The US National Farmers Union maintained that US methods of meat production were \"safe\", describing criticism as \"fear-mongering\".[60] Johnson advised the UK government to ban Huawei from being used in the nation's 5G networks after departing Prime Minister Theresa May approved the company in early 2019.[64] Johnson said that Huawei could represent an economic and security risk, comparing it to \"letting a kleptomaniac move into your house.\"[65] In 2020, after Britain decided to ban Huawei from its 5G mobile networks, Johnson welcomed the decision as a victory for human rights and fair trading practices.[66] In July 2020, the State Department investigated allegations made by some current and former staff members that accused Johnson of making inappropriate comments about issues concerning race, personal appearance, and Black History Month.[67][68][69] Johnson denied the allegations, asserting that the claims were inconsistent with his values and record. The State Department and the U.S. Embassy in London stood by Johnson, highlighting his professional conduct and dedication to U.S.-UK relations. While an Inspector General report on the matter was pending, Johnson maintained that he had always followed ethical guidelines and that the accusations did not reflect his long-standing principles.[70] After the investigation, the inspector general issued a report in August 2020 that said that Johnson \"sometimes made inappropriate or insensitive comments on topics generally considered Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO)-sensitive, such as religion, sex, or color\" that could \"create an offensive working environment\" and violate EEO (antidiscrimination) laws.[71] The inspector general's office recommended that the State Department's Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs and Office of Civil Rights (S/OCR) coordinate an investigation into Johnson's conduct. S/OCR did so, and found that allegations against Johnson were unsubstantiated.[72] In February 2018, Johnson as ambassador sought to have the lucrative British Open golf tournament moved to Trump's Turnberry Golf Resort in Scotland, raising the idea with Secretary of State for Scotland David Mundell.[2] The New York Times reported, and the former deputy chief of mission at the U.S. embassy in London Lewis Lukens later confirmed, that Trump had asked Johnson to seek British government influence in obtaining the Open for Turnberry.[2][73] At the time Lukens warned Johnson not to raise the question with the UK government, saying that an attempt to further the president's personal financial interests in this way would be unethical and probably illegal. Johnson did so anyway, unsuccessfully.[2][73] In a statement, the British government said that Johnson \"made no request of Mr. Mundell regarding the British Open or any other sporting event\"; the statement did not say whether Johnson had raised the subject of Turnberry.[2] Johnson did not deny the episode, saying only that he complied with \"the ethical rules and requirements of my office\"; Trump denied that he had ever spoken to Johnson \"about Turnberry.\"[74] Lukens documented his concerns to State Department officials. Johnson forced out Lukens several months later, before the scheduled end of his tenure in London.[2] The report that Johnson used his position as ambassador to promote the president's personal business interests sparked an inquiry by the State Department inspector general's office.[40] In an interview in August 2020, Lukens said that the inspector general's report had halted without a public report being issued, which he considered unusual.[73] In 1977, Johnson married former fashion model Nancy Sale Johnson. They had three children before divorcing in 2001. In early 2010, daughter Casey Johnson died of diabetic ketoacidosis.[75] He started a research foundation, the Alliance for Lupus Research, after his daughter Jaime was found to have lupus.[76] In 2009, Johnson married Suzanne Ircha, a former actress and equities managing director at Sandler O'Neill & Partners.[77][78] They have two children.[79] Suzanne's father emigrated from Ternopil, Ukraine after World War II, and her mother was a first-generation Ukrainian American.[80] She grew up in a Ukrainian neighborhood in Greenwich Village.[81] Johnson has homes in Bedminster Township, New Jersey,[82] and Palm Beach island in Florida, residing in the latter since 2020.[83] He formerly had an apartment in Manhattan,[82] but sold the unit (a two-floor duplex at 834 Fifth Avenue) in 2014 to billionaire Leonard Blavatnik for $80 million, setting a record for the costliest co-op ever sold in New York.[84] Johnson is known for philanthropy, especially donations to medical research. He raised money and lobbied to increase federal funding for lupus and diabetes.[85] Johnson is also a trustee of the Robert Wood Johnson Jr. Charitable Trust.[31] He is the only member of the Johnson family to be invited to join the board of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.[86] Johnson was the chairman of the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation International. He and his wife became involved with diabetes charities after his daughter Casey was diagnosed with diabetes in 1988.[31] In 1994, he co-wrote the book Managing Your Child's Diabetes with his wife Nancy, and Casey.[87] As of 2000, he had donated $12 million to the foundation. Johnson was a chairman on the Council on Foreign Relations, and successfully lobbied Congress to approve a five-year, $750 million package for funding diabetes research in 2002.[88] Casey died of diabetic ketoacidosis on January 4, 2010.[89] On October 24, 2012, Johnson wrote an opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal titled \"The Folly of Defunding Diabetes Research\", which urged Congress to approve long-term funding for the Special Diabetes Program.[90] He visited the University of Birmingham in 2018 to discuss the university's diabetes research and research library.[91] Johnson is the founding chairman of the Alliance for Lupus Research (ALR).[92] He founded the legacy organization, Alliance for Lupus Research, in 1999 after his daughter Jaime[93] was diagnosed with lupus, and he realized that there was a lack of research in that area.[94] During the ongoing 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Johnson and his wife Suzanne, who comes from a Ukrainian background, have organized aid efforts for Ukraine.[95] Their family visited Poland, which is the primary destination for Ukrainian refugees displaced by the crisis.[96] While in Poland, they made visits to community centers, shelters, and orphanages housing Ukrainian refugees.[97] In an article for The Telegraph, Johnson urged the United States and the United Kingdom to aid Ukraine.[96] In April 2022, the Jets pledged a $1 million donation to Ukraine, to be distributed to various organizations, including Plast Scouting USA and United24.[98][99][97] Media related to Woody Johnson at Wikimedia Commons",

                "content": "ROBERT WOOD JOHNSON, a member of the founding family of Johnson & Johnson, has built upon his family's proud legacy of achievement as a successful businessman, compassionate philanthropist, civic leader, and diplomat. Upon purchasing the team in 2000, Johnson established his commitment to a culture of success built on three key elements: passionate players, supportive fans, and a new stadium. Under his leadership, the Jets entered their new home field, MetLife Stadium, an award-winning venue that has been ranked as the #1 highest grossing venue in the world and recognized by Billboard as stadium of the decade. He also moved the Jets into the Atlantic Health Jets Training Center, a world-class 224,000 square-foot complex that united the entire organization, and provided the perfect facility for everyone—players, coaches, and staff—to continually improve and excel. In 2017, Johnson was appointed the U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom. As ambassador, he strengthened the 'Special Relationship' between the US and the UK, by promoting security and economic prosperity over a range of issues from trade to cyber security policies. While in London, the Ambassador resided in the historic Winfield House, receiving world leaders including Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II and on multiple occasions, President Donald Trump. Ambassador Johnson led the relocation of over 1,000 employees from the Embassy's historic location at Grosvenor Square to a new state of the art headquarters at Nine Elms. When the pandemic struck London, he then directed those employees in the remote, effective, and efficient operation of the Embassy to continue to serve and promote the United States' interests in the United Kingdom. Throughout his tenure at the Embassy, Ambassador Johnson engaged with government leaders and the British people, traveling extensively throughout the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland to hear local concerns and emphasize the 'Special Relationship.' Beyond the field, Ambassador Johnson's philosophy of a successful team celebrates the crucial role of fans, as well as the significant role the team plays in the community. In this spirit, the team, through the New York Jets Foundation, positively influences the lives of young people in the area by expanding youth football, preventing bullying, and promoting social justice, particularly in disadvantaged communities. Among the Foundation's programs is the launch of the first Girls High School Flag Football League in New Jersey and first NFL Girls Flag Football League in the United Kingdom. In 2022, the Jets announced a $1 million donation to help aid the people of Ukraine, with the money distributed among various organizations, each receiving $100,000, over the course of a year. For Johnson, the events in Ukraine are personal; his wife, Suzanne, grew up in a Ukrainian neighborhood in New York. Her mother, Marie, was born to Ukrainian immigrant parents while Suzanne's father, Stefan Ircha, was originally from Ternopil, a town outside of Kyiv, and immigrated to the United States after WWII. In 2022, the Johnson family traveled to Poland to meet with Ukrainian refugees and understand firsthand how the unprovoked invasion has impacted their lives. Chief among Ambassador Johnson's healthcare initiatives is the support for lupus research. In 1999, he founded the Alliance for Lupus Research (now the Lupus Research Alliance). This was the first organization devoted exclusively to finding new methods to prevent, treat, and ultimately cure lupus. Thanks to his leadership, the organization has dedicated more than $245 million for research grants and achieved the major milestone of funding research which set the stage for the recent FDA approval of three new treatments for this autoimmune disease. Over many years, Ambassador Johnson has been active in philanthropy and civic affairs, including past roles as an Honorary Trustee of the Wildlife Conservation Society and a past board member of the National September 11 Memorial & Museum at the World Trade Center and the Peregrine Fund. The Ambassador also served as a Trustee and a Trustee Emeritus of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the nation's largest philanthropic organization devoted exclusively to promoting health and healthcare for Americans. Currently, the Ambassador is an active member of the NFL's Finance Committee, Investment Committee, and Stadium Committee. COPYRIGHT © 2024 NEW YORK JETS",

                "title": "New York Jets Owner Woody Johnson Faces Major Decision After Trump’s Election Win",
                "content": "With President Donald Trump winning the 2024 Election on November 5, New York Jets owner Woody Johnson will have a big decision to make. Many have wondered if Johnson plans to return to London. In Trump's first term as president, he served as the Ambassador to the United Kingdom. Johnson left the Jets for three and a half years to serve in that position. Woody's brother, Christopher Johnson, took over the day-to-day operations for New York when he was in London. As of November 6, it remains uncertain if Johnson wants to return to London or if Trump even wants him back. According to reports, many inside the organization believe there's a chance it'll happen again. Recent remarks might not suggest so, however. Sports Illustrated obtained comments Johnson made about his past work and the future in an interview with the Millbrook School, where he attended high school. \"I was hoping to stay [in London], as my work touched on a little bit of everything -- military, cultural affairs, and developing relationships -- and I didn't get the chance to start until August of 2017. President Trump was elected in November and took office in January. But senate confirmations take time, and time wastes resources.\" Johnson later added that his goal when he returned home was to win a Super Bowl. That could indicate he wants to stay with the Jets and build a winning team. With their struggles in 2024, it's also possible he wants to head back into politics. His comments came before the first game of the campaign for New York. \"But coming home, I wanted to win a Super Bowl. There are two things in life: sports and politics. In each, you're in the danger zone, and that's where you learn and you find success. So now, it's working on getting there. Winning seven games is not acceptable. This data dive is the best thing I've ever done--ripping the hell out of the Jets organization. Status quo is death; it will kill you. You have to change, so you have to have an organization that embraces change. Otherwise, it's impossible to win.\" If Trump wants Johnson back, that decision isn't expected to come for a while. Perhaps it'll happen quicker than last time, as Trump didn't appoint him until June of 2017. With a coaching search and a general manager decision to make, Johnson might be hoping he won't have to go to London until June of 2025. Jon Conahan has been covering all major sports since 2019.

            {
                "title": "Chip Roy - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Charles Eugene \"Chip\" Roy (born August 7, 1972)[1] is an American attorney and politician serving as the U.S. representative for Texas's 21st congressional district. A member of the Republican Party, Roy took office on January 3, 2019. Before his election to Congress, he served as chief of staff to Senator Ted Cruz and as first assistant attorney general of Texas. A member of and policy chair of the House Freedom Caucus, Roy is considered a member of the far-right faction of the House Republican Conference.[2][3] Roy was born in Bethesda, Maryland,[4] and raised in Lovettsville, Virginia. His parents, Don and Rhonda Roy, were conservatives who supported Ronald Reagan and helped shape Roy's political views.[5] After graduating from Loudoun Valley High School,[6] Roy attended the University of Virginia, receiving a Bachelor of Science in commerce in 1994 and a Master of Science in information systems in 1995.[5] There, he worked as a dorm resident assistant for a year.[7] After graduation Roy spent three years as an investment banking analyst.[5] Wary that his career might require him to relocate to Manhattan, Roy decided to pursue a different career.[5] He enrolled at the University of Texas School of Law, where he met his future wife, Carrah.[5] He graduated in 2003 with a Juris Doctor. Though initially Roy saw politics \"as an avocation, a sort of interest, but not something I would do anytime soon, if ever\",[5] his mind began to change when, while still in law school, he began working for then-Texas attorney general John Cornyn on his 2002 campaign for the United States Senate.[7][8] After the September 11 attacks, Roy reflected on his goals. \"I was in law school when September 11 happened. I will always remember that moment, crystallized in my head. That had a lot to do with my commitment to public service\", he has said.[9] When Cornyn was elected and made vice chairman of the Republican Committee and the Judiciary Committee, Roy served as his staff director and senior counsel. Roy provided counsel for Cornyn and his staff on legislative issues including nominations, intellectual property, crime, civil justice reform and advising him during the immigration reform debates under the George W. Bush administration.[10][11][12] Roy worked for Cornyn until 2009.[8] Roy returned to Texas as a special assistant in the office of the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Texas.[13] In 2006, Roy met Ted Cruz, then Texas Solicitor General, during a strategy session discussing the case League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry, a case about redistricting that Cruz argued before the United States Supreme Court.[11] Roy resigned from his job as a special assistant U.S. attorney after six months to be a ghostwriter on then-Governor of Texas Rick Perry's 2010 book Fed Up! and work for Perry's 2012 presidential campaign.[4][8][10] The book served as a campaign agenda for Perry's campaign, and offered a range of Perry's positions, including criticism of the Social Security system as unconstitutional (calling it \"a Ponzi scheme\"), changing the election of U.S. senators back to state legislatures (they were made popularly elected by the Seventeenth Amendment), ending life tenure for federal judges, and repealing the 16th Amendment (which allows a federal income tax).[10] The book also denounces as \"overreach\" federal efforts to regulate health care, labor conditions, energy policy, and pollution.[10] In the book's acknowledgments section, Perry singled out Roy for \"special recognition\" for resigning his previous post \"to devote himself full-time to the completion of the original manuscript\" and his \"amazing knowledge of the U.S. Constitution and other Founding documents, and a keen ability to frame federalist arguments in striking terms that make complicated law easier for non-lawyers like me to understand and discuss.\"[10] In his review of the book, Gene Healy of the libertarian Cato Institute credited Roy as \"the guy who did most of the heavy lifting in the book.\"[10] On April 1, 2011, Perry announced Roy as his choice for Texas's Director of State-Federal relations, an office whose duties include lobbying for federal funds for state institutions (such as grants to universities).[4][12][13] During the confirmation hearings for his position before the Texas Senate, Roy said he would oppose an \"intrusive federal government that spends our money recklessly.\"[14] He promised to help Texas legislators \"push back on Washington where necessary\" and stand up for \"liberty, state sovereignty and an end to the crippling pile of debt and regulation coming from Washington that is destroying our nation and endangering the state.\"[10] When asked about the recent Texas House vote to slash most of the office's funds, transferring them to a tuition reimbursement program for children of the military, he said it was \"hardly surprising…I might have voted to cut it as well, based on what I understand of the office, but possibly without hiding behind the political gamesmanship of moving it from one account to another.\"[14] He promised to consider eliminating the entire office if it didn't \"stand for something.\"[5] Roy's nomination was opposed by Texas State Senator Kirk Watson, who pointed out that the office's mission was \"to promote communication and build relationships between the state and federal governments\" and asked Roy \"when you or someone else\" decided to redefine its purpose.[14] The committee approved Roy's nomination, 6–1, with the full State Senate later confirming the nomination.[4] Roy served in the office from April to October 2011.[15] The week of his 39th birthday in August 2011, Roy was diagnosed with Stage 3 Hodgkin lymphoma.[5] He later said his experience battling cancer convinced him of the importance of \"health-care freedom\", and that examining his medical bills showed him \"how truly convoluted our system is.\"[5] After Cruz's election to the Senate in 2012, Roy became his chief of staff.[10][16] While working for Cruz, Roy gained attention for criticizing other Republicans who did not join Cruz in demanding Obamacare be defunded before voting to keep the government running past September 30, 2013. During the 2013 United States federal government shutdown, Roy's main tasks were behind the scenes, plotting a course through the media coverage and determining tactics when Republican allies deserted the cause and the party's leadership became increasingly hostile.[7] Roy chastised defecting Republicans, and was quoted as saying Tom Coburn was serving in a \"surrender caucus\" and likening Mitch McConnell to Barack Obama.[17] Cruz said Republicans who did not join him had fallen into \"a powerful, defeatist approach…they're beaten down and they're convinced that we can't give a fight, and they're terrified.\"[17] Their cause was joined by Marco Rubio, Rand Paul, Mark Meadows and Mike Lee. The media picked up on Roy taking to Twitter to jab John McCain, sarcastically calling it \"shocking\" that \"someone talking to [Democratic Senator Chuck] Schumer 5x a day and the White House daily\" did not support the hardball approach.[17] Coburn complained about these tactics to the Washington Examiner, saying: \"The worst thing is being dishonest about what you can accomplish, ginning everybody up and then creating disappointment.\"[17] Roy's response on Twitter gained media attention: \"Since when is a promise to fight disastrous policy 'dishonest?' No, the worst thing is giving up & leaving your base believing there is no need to be a Republican any longer.\"[17] Coburn told a reporter that he had \"no ill will\" toward Roy: \"He knows I'm not part of the surrender caucus.\"[17] He added: \"a good portion of it [Obamacare] is mandatory spending, and the only way to get rid of mandatory spending…is 67 votes because you got to override a presidential veto\"[18] and that Cruz's and Roy's tactics would result in the Democrats taking control of the House.[18] Roy told a reporter that his job was to advance Cruz's priorities, and he had not been told to stand down: \"The Washington establishment uses every tool at its disposal to push its own narrative on the American public—and in this case, it's the narrative of 'we can't.' They plant stories, strong-arm members and try to create fake 'wins' for cover that simply do not change the status quo. It is important that we push back.\"[17] In response to questions about Roy's behavior, McCain said, \"He and Senator Cruz are entitled to their opinions, but I don't pay that much attention to that kind of thing because I believe my position. It wouldn't be the first person who has criticized me.\" Richard Burr, who supported defunding but not threatening to cause a shutdown, also was unmoved by Roy's quips: \"It doesn't matter to me what he does. The only thing that's important is that I'm on Senator Cruz's bill to eliminate Obamacare.\"[17] On September 25, 2013, Cruz and Roy met with trusted staffers and Cruz read aloud from Psalm 40 (which includes the line \"troubles without number surround me\") and then took to the Senate floor for a 21-hour speech against Obamacare.[7] Despite such efforts the shutdown did not result in the desired policy change: the Republican leadership brokered a deal with the Democrats, reopened the government, and Obamacare funding was only marginally affected.[7] Politico called Roy an \"architect\" of Cruz's strategy, and he later told a reporter, \"Was I intimately involved with it? Yes. Unapologetically. I think it was the right strategy. And but for the same hand-wringers in the Senate that continue to give us the status quo, we might have been successful.\"[7][19] In September 2014, as Cruz contemplated a 2016 presidential campaign, Roy's duties in his office moved from chief of staff to top political strategist.[20][21] During the exploratory phase of Cruz's campaign, Roy and Cruz got into an argument about political tactics and strategy that became heated enough to cause Roy to leave Cruz's Senate staff. Despite the level of disagreement, they discussed working together in the future. Cruz later recalled, \"We often agreed, but not always, and we would have vigorous debates. Chip never backs down, and we would have extended discussions about which battles should be the highest priority.\"[22] In 2014, despite controversy over the Texas State Securities Board issuing a disciplinary order against him for soliciting investment clients without being registered in the state, Ken Paxton easily won election as Texas attorney general.[23] He chose Roy as his first assistant attorney general,[13][20] saying: \"Chip is a longtime friend, and someone whose counsel I trust. I am pleased that he will bring his strong legal mind, devotion to liberty, and servant's heart to the Office of Attorney General as first assistant.\"[23][24] Roy's continuing battle with cancer influenced his decision to return to Texas, as he wished to be close to his family rather than commute weekly to Washington, D.C. or travel extensively on a presidential campaign.[11] Stepping into his role in Texas's attorney general's office, Roy confronted over 28,000 active cases, including high-profile cases on voter ID and same-sex marriage.[5] He also participated in the 2015 lawsuit United States v. Texas against President Obama's executive action on immigration. The case challenged the constitutionality of the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans (DAPA) program.[11] Roy explained Texas's position to reporters: \"the U.S. Senate and House aren't doing their job in standing up for and defending [the powers granted only to them by the Constitution's] Article 1, I think it is critical what Texas is doing in stepping up and defending when the president himself said repeatedly he didn't have the power to do this.\"[11] In July 2015, a Collin County grand jury indicted Paxton on two first-degree felony counts of securities fraud and a third-degree felony for failure to register as a securities dealer.[25] Paxton maintained his innocence, but news stories continued to focus on the charges. Due to Paxton's decision to work from his home in McKinney rather than the capital in Austin, reporters covering the office's work highlighted the rolls of his solicitor general Scott Keller, his chief of staff Bernard McNamee, and especially Roy.[25] With Paxton avoiding all but the friendliest audiences, speculation arose that Roy was the de facto attorney general.[25] In September 2015, while praising Roy at the Pflugerville First Baptist Church as one of the \"visionaries on this religious liberties issue\", Paxton said, \"I get credit, sometimes not credit, for what happens in my office.\"[25] MacNamee soon resigned in frustration over Paxton's behavior. Roy inadvertently drew unwanted attention to the situation in an interview about Texas's challenge to the DAPA program. When a reporter asked him how Paxton's legal problems affected the agency, Roy's response was seen as revealing Paxton's absence from running the office. He said, \"We're in constant communication with the attorney general, and we're focused on doing our job every day to defend the state of Texas. ...The first assistant attorney general, the solicitor general, our head of civil litigation, all of us are charged to manage the daily affairs of this agency, and that's what we're doing.\"[25] When Paxton's name did not appear in a New York Times piece about a suit against Texas in the Supreme Court over abortion restrictions, his communications staff complained to Keller about it. Paxton traveled to Washington to hear the oral arguments, paying for his own ticket and submitting a copy of it to the state alongside the one his office had purchased for Roy to show how much money he had saved Texas.[25] Eight days after the Supreme Court hearing, Paxton called his communications director, Allison Castle, who could not get any news organization to agree to interview him about the case. He demanded she resign or be fired. He then did the same to Roy, who resigned. Both were placed on emergency leave, which caused further controversy.[25][26][27] Reporters also began to investigate whether Paxton had broken state law in the way he had hired staff: giving people the job before they filled out an application and without first advertising openings before filing them with people from outside the department.[28] Paxton's choice to replace Roy was Jeff Mateer from First Liberty Institute, who had attracted notoriety by offering to represent, pro bono, any business that wished to sue the city of Plano over its anti-LGBT discrimination ordinance.[25] On March 10, 2016, the day after Paxton announced that Roy had \"resigned to pursue other endeavors,\" he was named the executive director of the Trusted Leadership PAC, which was supporting Cruz's presidential campaign.[13][29][30] The PAC was formed to bring the preexisting separate Cruz-supporting PACs into a single operating structure.[5] Controversy arose when it was discovered that Roy remained a state employee while working for the PAC. Roy responded that he had not received any pay from the PAC while he was on the state payroll, and only used his accrued vacation and compensatory time from the state after resigning to work for the PAC. This had left open the option for him to receive leave after his vacation and holiday time expired, which would have allowed him to continue receiving health benefits for his cancer treatment. After The Dallas Morning News reported on the matter,[31] Roy fully resigned, maintaining that doing so was the result of a good report from his oncologist.[5] While working for the campaign, Roy called presidential candidate Donald Trump's conservative credentials into question, at one point tweeting, \"@RealDonaldTrump Supports Planned Parenthood, which kills babies and puts them in a freezer, government funding of healthcare and Palestine.\"[19] At the time of Roy's hiring, pro-Cruz political consultant (and future Trump campaign manager) Kellyanne Conway had said, \"This is a two-person race where Senator Cruz is building significant momentum and is the proven conservative, able to win the nomination and defeat Hillary Clinton,\"[30] but Cruz dropped out of the race less than two months after Roy took over the PAC.[5] Despite a scandal about the Cruz campaign's relationship with Cambridge Analytica, Roy and Trusted Leadership PAC had no interaction with the company.[5] By September 19, 2016, Roy had found employment as the Director of the Center for Tenth Amendment Action for the Texas Public Policy Foundation (TPPF), a conservative think tank.[32] In 2018, Roy ran for the United States House of Representatives in Texas's 21st congressional district to succeed Lamar Smith, who did not run for reelection. Covering his campaign, Politico likened him to Cruz.[19] Roy finished first in an 18-candidate field and received Smith's endorsement in a runoff on May 22 against Matt McCall.[5] Roy said he agreed with Smith in questioning the scientific consensus on climate change which clearly attributes it to human activity.[5] When he supported Cruz in the 2016 presidential primary, Roy's criticism of Trump caused some of his friends to describe him as committed to the \"Never Trump\" cause.[19] By 2018, his position had changed. Roy praised Trump's job performance as president, citing his decision to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate accords and his results in \"regulatory relief, on tax relief, on judges, on the embassy in Jerusalem\" and his attacks on \"the swamp or the establishment or the status quo or whatever you want to call the inner workings of Washington, D.C.\"[19][33] Roy also echoed Trump's position about a \"deep state\", which he defined as \"entrenched bureaucrat[s] who hide something from the political decision-makers\" causing \"pushback from deep within the bowels of each of the agencies.\"[19] He called for federal agencies \"to be thinned out so that we don't have those issues.\"[19] Roy promised if elected to push back against the status quo and restrict the federal government's power, calling for Medicare to be delegated to the states, for Congress to pass a balanced budget, and for action to be taken to prevent judges from \"legislating from the bench\".[5] He suggested that the House should attempt to pass no legislation the next term until it advanced a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution.[34] He also held that there were threats from \"porous borders, gangs and drug cartels\" that he would address if elected.[34] The Club for Growth supported his candidacy.[5] The House Freedom Fund (aligned with the Freedom Caucus in the House) contributed $143,000 to Roy's campaign.[5][35] By February, Cruz joined in campaigning for Roy, telling voters, \"I know how he responds under pressure, under heat, and that he won't buckle.\"[5] Roy finished 10 points ahead of McCall in the Republican primary election. He beat McCall by 5% in the \"top-two\" runoff.[36] McCall credited much of Roy's victory to Cruz's endorsement and efforts. McCall said that Cruz was able to convince others to endorse Roy, even Louie Gohmert, whom McCall hailed as his congressional role model.[37] Roy defeated Democratic nominee Joseph Kopser, a businessman, aerospace engineer and veteran, in the general election,[38] 50%–48%, a closer than expected margin.[39] As the 2020 electoral season approached, Democrats sought to associate Roy with Cruz, whose popularity was seen as in decline.[40] Roy was reelected, defeating Democratic nominee Wendy Davis[41] by seven points and winning eight of the district's 10 counties.[42][43] The Wall Street Journal described Roy's Republican primary race of 2022 as \"a case study in whether a conservative Republican usually aligned with Mr. Trump can survive politically after angering the former president—even a modest amount.\"[22] Even before a challenger arose against Roy, Trump had called for him to be defeated in the Republican primary. By June 2021, physician Robert Lowry had filed with the Federal Election Commission to face Roy in the primary, with the possibility of more candidates entering the race by the December 13 deadline.[22] Roy ended up winning the primary with 83.2% of the vote, receiving more than 10 times as many votes as Lowry, who was the closest challenger. Roy went on to win the general election as well with 63% of the vote. In 2024, Roy was re-elected with 61.9% of the vote in the general election against Democrat candidate Kristin Hook.[44] Coming into office, Roy cast himself as a conservative version of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: \"I doubt she and I agree on many issues. But functionally, this place is broken.\"[35] He was happy to be part of the Freedom Caucus: \"they're serving as a check against the current broken system where the power brokers make decisions at the top and just say 'Here's what we're going to do'.\"[35] He added that Republican power brokers in Congress lost control of the House because \"You demonstrate rote incompetence when you are leaving us with a trillion dollars in deficits this year on top of $22 trillion in debt. You said you were going to do something to secure our border, and you didn't. And you said you were going to fight for—I use the term 'health care freedom'—and you didn't. It's hard to really take that to the people and say, 'Hey, send me back'.\"[35] Roy's first speech as a representative was on immigration and what he called \"chaos and lawlessness on the southern border.\"[35] He complained that \"members of both sides of the aisle have buried their heads in the sand over the last several decades, talking instead of doing.\"[35] Right-leaning news outlets hailed Roy's speech.[35] Soon after taking office, Roy opposed a bill in the House that tried to prevent Trump from withdrawing from NATO without Congress's consent. It passed, 357 to 22.[35] When the House voted to give back pay to the 800,000 federal workers affected by the government shutdown, Roy opposed the measure. Roy was one of few Republicans to vote against the measure, which passed 411 to 7. Trump signed the bill into law.[35] In July 2021, Roy voted against the bipartisan ALLIES Act, which would increase by 8,000 the number of special immigrant visas for Afghan allies of the U.S. military during its invasion of Afghanistan, while also reducing some application requirements that caused long application backlogs; the bill passed in the House 407–16.[45] In 2021, a recording of Roy surfaced in which he said he wanted \"18 more months of chaos and the inability to get stuff done\" during a Democratic-controlled Congress and presidency.[46] Roy's conservative positions have frequently put him in conflict with House GOP leadership.[47] On May 24, 2019, Roy singlehandedly halted a House disaster relief funding bill that gave $19 billion in relief for communities hit by disasters, including $900 million for hurricane-damaged Puerto Rico, and fast-tracked $4 billion in grants to Texans suffering due to the effects of Hurricane Harvey. The money for Texas had been approved in 2018 but held up due to working out regulations with the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Office of Management and Budget. Cornyn had championed the bill and Cruz voted for it. House leaders of both parties had agreed to advance the bill under a quick procedure rule that required unanimous consent of those in the chamber. Most members of Congress had already left Washington for the Memorial Day recess. The day before, the Senate had passed the bill 85–8, and the House had passed a similar version earlier in the month 257–150. Due to Roy's objection, the unanimous consent vote was derailed. Roy blamed Nancy Pelosi for the previous delay in Texans receiving the funds and voiced his dislike of procedure being used.[48][49][50] During other pro forma sessions, Roy's tactic was adopted by Representatives Thomas Massie and John Rose, who returned to Washington during the recess week for two more similar unanimous consent request attempts.[51][52][53] Ultimately Roy's action delayed the bill's passage for several days until lawmakers returned from recess. Hurricane season began on June 1 and coastal communities soon began seeing flooding amid strong storms.[54] The bill was stalled for 11 days before passing on June 3 by a margin of 354–58, with Roy voting against it.[55] Roy received bipartisan criticism for his objection to the bill. He explained his vote against the measure, saying it added to the national debt and did not include additional spending for federal operations along the U.S.–Mexico border.[56][57] Five other Texas representatives joined Roy in opposing the bill: Lance Gooden, John Ratcliffe, Van Taylor, Ron Wright, and Michael Cloud (whose district bore the direct brunt of Hurricane Harvey).[54] On June 12, 2019, Roy derailed the usually uneventful House procedural process for appropriation bills. During the first debate of a four-bill spending package of the upcoming 2020 fiscal year the chamber scheduled for working through amendments through most of the day, with roll call votes not expected until around 5:30 p.m., Roy rose in an effort to protest what he saw as Democratic inaction on Trump's $4.5 billion supplemental funding request for the Department of Homeland Security (to address what his administration held was urgently needed due to an increasing number of migrants at the southern border). From the floor he halted the normal process by making a motion to adjourn at 12:14 p.m.[58] The motion was defeated, 146–244. Representative Andy Biggs then made another motion to adjourn, which was defeated, 140–254. Members of both parties voted against the motions and voiced complaints about the disruption. Members had been forced to leave committee hearings, markups, lunches, and other events for the unscheduled votes. After the votes the House resumed normal business, beginning a debate on a rule governing proceedings on the fiscal package. While managing the debate on the rule for the Republican minority, Woodall yielded his time to several members of his conference. Each requested unanimous consent for immediate consideration of the border funding supplemental. The chair declined these, ruling the time may be yielded only for debate on the rule in question. When proceedings shifted to amendment debate and lawmakers proceeded to call for a voice vote on many of the amendments (most of them uncontroversial), Roy objected and asked for roll call votes on each one. This once again caused members to have to return to the chamber for unscheduled votes, and as Roy continued to use this tactic it became clear that the previous schedule, which anticipated finishing up no later than 11 p.m., would be extended until early in the morning.[58] Roy continued to call for roll-call votes for each of the dozens of amendments offered. This caused members of both parties to voice displeasure with him and cancel their evening plans. Roy himself canceled his plans for his 15-year wedding anniversary.[59] The House finished voting at 4 a.m.[59] The Texas Tribune reported that by such tactics Roy within \"a span of just three weeks…established a reputation as the leading obstructionist in the House.\"[7] On June 28, 2019, in response to the humanitarian crisis involving migrant children at the southern border, Roy proposed legislation to amend the Antideficiency Act (ADA) to allow the United States Border Patrol to accept donations from people who want to help migrant children directly. The bill was filed after Border Patrol officials turned away people attempting to donate supplies such as diapers, toys, and hygiene items, saying they could not accept donations due to the ADA, which prevents the government from accepting \"any donations other than what Congress has allocated to it.\"[60][Notes 1][61][62] On October 5, 2020, while campaigning for reelection, Roy called for Paxton's resignation after seven senior leaders within his office (including Roy's replacement, Jeff Mateer) accused him of bribery, abuse of office, and other charges. Roy noted that rather than address the charges and demonstrate their falsity, Paxton had attacked the staffers' character. He took particular issue with Paxton's choice \"to attack the very people entrusted, by him, to lead the office—some of whom I know well and whose character are beyond reproach.\"[63][64][65][66] Hours after Roy's call for him to step down, Paxton released a statement saying, \"Despite the effort by rogue employees and their false allegations I will continue to seek justice in Texas and will not be resigning.\" The charges arose from Paxton's relationship with Nate Paul, an Austin real estate developer who donated $25,000 to Paxton's 2018 campaign. Paxton claimed that his office had been referred a case investigating an FBI raid in August 2019 of Paul's offices and home which had \"allegations of crimes relating to the FBI, other government agencies and individuals\".[67][66] When it was brought to Roy's attention that Paul had donated $2,700 to him the same 2018 electoral cycle, Roy said he did \"not recall meeting Mr. Paul and it shows as an online contribution.\"[68] Over 100 text messages gathered by the January 6th Commission revealed the coordination by Roy and Utah's U.S. Senator Mike Lee with Trump Chief of Staff Mark Meadows to overturn Trump's defeat in the 2020 election.[69][70][71][72] On November 7, 2020, before traveling to Georgia to help fight the election results there, Roy texted Meadows: \"Dude, we need ammo. We need fraud examples. We need it this weekend\": two days earlier, he had texted Meadows: \"We have no tools / data / information to go out and fight RE: election / fraud. If you need / want it, we all need to know what's going on.\"[70][73] On the same day, he also appealed to Meadows to have \"The President tone down the rhetoric, and approach the legal challenge firmly, intelligently and effectively without resorting to throwing wild desperate haymakers, or whipping his base into a conspiracy frenzy.\"[70] On November 19, 2020, he texted Meadows to express his concern for the lack of evidence, writing: \"Hey brother - we need substance or people are going to break.\"[69][73] On December 10, 2020, Roy wrote in opposition to Paxton's lawsuit Texas v. Pennsylvania, demanding four other states' election results be overturned as part of Trump's false claims that Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 presidential election was the result of widespread voter fraud. Despite 106 of his fellow House Republicans filing an amicus brief in support of the lawsuit, Roy wrote, \"I will not join because I believe the case itself represents a dangerous violation of federalism & sets a precedent to have one state asking federal courts to police the voting procedures of other states. I cannot support an effort that will almost certainly fail on grounds of standing and is inconsistent with my beliefs about protecting Texas sovereignty from the meddling of other states. Our remedy must be, from this day forward, to decline to allow the usurpation of our authority as people—through our states—to govern ourselves in all respects.\"[74][75] Cornyn also questioned Paxton's lawsuit, telling reporters \"I, frankly, struggle to understand the legal theory of it.\"[76] After the Supreme Court declined to hear the case, Roy told a reporter, \"It was clearly evident and obvious that it would have zero chance of success for anybody who understands the law and understands the Supreme Court and understands how these cases are going to go.\"[37] On December 31, 2020, in reference to attempts to challenge the results of the 2020 election, Roy texted Meadows: \"The President should call everyone off. It's the only path. If we substitute the will of states through electors with a vote by Congress every 4 years, we have destroyed the electoral college\"; the next day he texted Meadows that if Trump \"allows this to occur, we're driving a stake in the heart of the federal republic.\"[70] Roy joined fellow Republican Legislators Thomas Massie, Kelly Armstrong, Ken Buck, Mike Gallagher, Nancy Mace, and Tom McClintock in issuing a statement on January 3, 2021, against their colleagues' efforts to challenge the results of the 2020 election.[77] They signed a letter that, while giving credence to the idea that \"significant abuses in our election system resulting from the reckless adoption of mail-in ballots and the lack of safeguards maintained to guarantee that only legitimate votes are cast and counted,\" held that \"only the states have authority to appoint electors, in accordance with state law. Congress has only a narrow role in the presidential election process. Its job is to count the electors submitted by the states, not to determine which electors the states should have sent.\"[77][78] They pointed to the Twelfth Amendment in support of their position, and wrote, \"As of this moment, not a single state has submitted multiple conflicting slates of electoral votes. …Unless that happens between now and January 6, 2021, Congress will have no authority to influence the outcome of the 2020 presidential election.\"[77] Congressional action despite this \"would amount to stealing power from the people and the states. It would, in effect, replace the electoral college with Congress, and in so doing strengthen the efforts of those on the left who are determined to eliminate it or render it irrelevant.\"[77] The letter called on Republican legislators to remember their oath: \"We must respect the states' authority here. Though doing so may frustrate our immediate political objectives, we have sworn an oath to promote the Constitution above our policy goals. We must count the electoral votes submitted by the states.\"[77] On the same day as the joint statement, Roy objected to the seating of 67 incoming representatives from states that Trump claimed rigged their elections against him: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Roy held that if his Republican colleagues (including Gohmert and Cruz) were going to hold that ballots should be questioned about the presidential race (calling for an emergency 10-day audit), then no certainty could be granted for any race. He said \"a number of my colleagues...have publicly stated that they plan to object to the acceptance of electors from those particular six states due to their deeply held belief that those states conducted elections plagued by statewide, systemic fraud and abuse that leaves them absolutely no way for this chamber or our constituents to trust the validity of their elections. Such allegations, if true, raise significant doubts about the elections of at least some of the members of the United States House of Representatives that, if not formally addressed, could cast a dark cloud of suspicion over the validity of this body for the duration of the 117th Congress.\"[79][80] He added, \"It would confound basic human reason if the presidential results were to face objection while the congressional results of the same process escaped without public scrutiny.\"[81][82] Roy apologized to those who had come to the swearing-in ceremony and said that if a colleague objected to his own seating in response he would welcome a vote.[81] Due to Roy's actions, the House held a vote on the matter and the result was 371 to 2 in favor of moving ahead with the swearing in of all members.[83] The Dallas Morning News wrote that Roy's actions were \"a dramatic escalation in the GOP feud\" over the counting of electoral votes, noting Roy was in the minority of his party but \"a conservative firebrand...[who] has developed a reputation for a damn-the-consequences approach to doing what he thinks is right, even if it means irking his fellow Republicans.\"[83] Roy spent most of January 5, 2021, working on the remarks he planned on giving on the House floor the next day. He called constitutional scholars as well as other members to sharpen his writing. At the end of the day, when returning to his Virginia apartment, he stopped at a sports bar and was troubled by what he saw: \"The place was filled with MAGA Trump supporters. Absolutely filled. I kept hearing people say, 'Liberals are going to be upset tomorrow when the vice president stops this steal and gives this election back to the president.'[37] I heard that repeatedly from people in that bar. I had called the Sheriff of Hays County earlier that day to tell him to look after Carrah and the kids and I told friends here in town to look after Carrah and the kids because I could tell things were getting a little amped up. And that night I re-texted the sheriff and said 'Please be keeping an eye out for Carrah and the kids' because the temperature was so high.\"[84] The next day, when there was an objection to counting Arizona's electoral votes, Roy went with the other members of the House to debate their acceptance. He began seeing notifications on social media of an angry mob outside the Capitol and began texting his staff to try to ensure their safety in the Longworth office building. Legislators paused the debate when the Capitol police announced a breach in the building, but thinking it isolated, resumed debate. Roy was in the well of the lectern about fourth in line to the microphone, where he planned to object to those objecting to the electoral votes. After Capitol police instructed members to hunker in place and make use of their emergency gas masks, Roy tweeted, \"To those storming the Capitol - I am on the House floor and I will not be deterred from upholding my oath, under God, to the Constitution by mob demand.\"[85] Roy felt to stay in the chamber would be like a \"sitting duck\" and was able to get Capitol police to direct representatives to a secure exit. Upon receiving their instructions, Roy went to the indicated door and called for his fellow members to exit through it while he held it open. During the January 6 Capitol attack, Roy was in the House chamber. He tweeted to Trump, \"Mr. President - get to a microphone immediately and establish calm and order. Now. And work with Capitol Police to secure the Capitol. It's the last thing you'll do that matters as President.\"[86] He later told a reporter, \"We must enforce the law. People have breached the Capitol, they need to go to jail. It's dangerous. A lot of people there with a lot of emotions running high. Look, I wish the president had spun people to—as I said, on the floor of the House of Representatives [Wednesday] night—to believe things that were not going to happen, and that was unfortunate.\"[87] As Congress prepared to return to the chambers, Roy tweeted, \"We will reconvene. We will vote to accept the electors from the states, as instructed by the Constitution. That is our job.\"[85] Returning to the chamber once safety was restored, Roy addressed the House, \"Many of my colleagues were poised this afternoon to vote to insert Congress into the constitutionally prescribed decision-making of the states by rejecting the sole official electors sent to us by each of the states of the union. I hope they will reconsider. I can tell you that I was not going to, and I will not be voting to reject the electors. And that vote may well sign my political death warrant. But so be it. I swore an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States—and I will not bend its words into contortions for political expediency and then claim I am honoring that oath.\"[88] In the two House votes that challenged the electors of Arizona and Pennsylvania, Roy voted to certify the electors appointed by those states.[88] Even as Roy's favorability dropped significantly in his district, he said he had no regrets: \"I did not take an oath to the political expediency of either Donald Trump or any other member of a political party. I took an oath to the Constitution of the United States. My view is immovable in that regard. And for those raising questions about it, I want to know where they were—precisely where they were—when a Capitol Hill police officer was getting his head bashed in by a fire extinguisher by an angry mob spun up in no small part by the president's irresponsible actions.\"[37] Roy told a reporter that Republicans were \"being fed misinformation\" and that one of his responsibilities was to counsel voters on just how they were misled.[37] During the second impeachment of Donald Trump, Roy held that Trump's behavior \"was clearly, in my opinion, impeachable conduct, pressuring the vice president to violate his oath to the Constitution.\"[89] Still, Roy opposed impeachment. He held that the Democratic leadership in the House \"drafted articles that I believe are flawed… focusing on the legally specific terms of incitement and insurrection. Even noting impeachment does not require meeting a certain legal standard – the danger for open speech & debate in this body and for the Republic generally is high – if the House approves the articles as written.\" If accepted, he said, \"The language of this impeachment will be used to target members of this body under section 3 of the 14th Amendment. It will be used to suggest that any statements we make are subject to review by our colleagues and send us down the perilous path of the cleansing political speech in the public square.\"[89][90] Roy joined all of Texas's House Republicans in voting against impeachment.[91] When asked whether he or any of his fellow Republicans had been threatened with violence if they voted to impeach, Roy said, \"I'm not aware of any specific threats against me or anybody else. Honestly, if somebody would have threatened me, I probably would have said FU and voted to impeach. I just don't react well to that sort of thing.\"[37] In events leading up to the insurrection at the Capitol, reporters observed an ideological split between Roy and Cruz. On January 5, Roy forced members of the House to go on record in a voice vote concerning the seating of 67 representatives-elect from the six states that Trump asserted had invalid elections, a move The Washington Post called a \"gutsy step\" that was \"putting a spotlight on the hypocrisy of his fellow Republicans\" for contesting the presidential results in those states but not the results for other races in those states, though the same methods were used to tabulate votes.[92] That same day the media learned that Cruz would join Representatives Andy Biggs and Paul Gosar in objecting to the certification of Arizona's electoral votes, despite Attorney General William Barr's declaration that there was no evidence of fraud and despite every lawsuit put forward to challenge the outcome in Arizona having been dismissed or dropped by Trump's legal team. Cruz led a coalition of 11 Republican senators demanding an audit. Cruz's objections to Arizona were joined by Senator Josh Hawley challenging Pennsylvania's electoral votes and Senator Kelly Loeffler those of Georgia.[93] In contrast, Roy called on his fellow legislators to recall that \"we have sworn an oath to promote the Constitution above our policy goals\" and that they had a duty to follow its text.[93] The Post contrasted Roy with Cruz, who it said \"is stoking his 2024 presidential hopes by helping to lead a dishonest drive to question the electoral college results.\"[93] James Tilove of Texas Monthly wrote of Cruz and Roy, \"Their paths on January 6 could not have been more divergent, with Roy denouncing the president and the elector challenges, and Cruz continuing that night to press his objection to certifying the Biden electors from Arizona—the first of two states voted on—even after witnessing the terrible passions the doomed maneuver had stirred.\"[37] Roy acknowledged that he and Cruz disagreed on how to honor their oaths to the Constitution, but said, \"My friendship with Senator Ted Cruz is immovable. I think everybody needs to dial it down on both kinds of extremes. Those attacking [Cruz and some others] and calling them seditionists, it's absolutely absurd. We can agree to disagree on these things and we need to. I'll have more to say on that later but my friendship with Senator Ted Cruz is not up for negotiation.\"[37] On January 28, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez expressed a desire in a tweet to \"know more\" about the stock trading app Robinhood, which had blocked some retail investors' trading while hedge funds faced no such constraints. When Cruz tweeted his agreement, Ocasio-Cortez rebuffed him, holding that his calling the Electoral College votes into question had helped incite the January 6 insurrectionists, some of whom called for violence against her. She tweeted: \"I am happy to work with Republicans on this issue where there's common ground, but you almost had me murdered 3 weeks ago so you can sit this one out. Happy to work w/ almost any other GOP that aren't trying to get me killed. In the meantime if you want to help, you can resign.\" Roy objected to Ocasio-Cortez's assertions in a letter to Pelosi demanding that she be forced to apologize or face sanctions, saying \"she accused Senator Ted Cruz, in essence, of attempted murder. it is completely unacceptable behavior for a Member of Congress to make this kind of scurrilous charge against another member in the House or Senate for simply engaging in speech and debate regarding electors as they interpreted the Constitution. …It is my sincere hope that we all stop this heightened rhetoric and move forward to actually do the work the American people sent us here to do.\"[94][95] On February 1, Ocasio-Cortez detailed her experience on January 6, which was compounded by the trauma of being a sexual assault survivor, saying, \"Ted Cruz and Representatives Chip Roy, and, oh, by the way, some of the other representatives who actually encouraged people to threaten members of Congress, or tweeted out the location of the Speaker, are now telling me to apologize for saying and speak truth to what happened. These are the tactics that abusers use. The folks who are saying, 'We should move on,' 'We shouldn't have accountability,' etc., are saying, 'Can you just forget about this so we can do it again?'\"[96] Roy replied that he was saddened to learn she had been a victim of sexual assault, but \"I will not be swayed from my beliefs about right and wrong—regarding this or anything else.\" He took issue with being accused of using abuser tactics: \"Her comparison of my defense of colleagues to her circumstances were again inappropriate…It does not change the fact that her allegation against Sen. Cruz was completely unacceptable for a Member of Congress to make against another member for engaging in free speech and debate about what our Constitution says about electors. Nor does it change my position that she should apologize for and retract those remarks.\"[97] On March 8, 2021, 13 suspension bills—bills brought up under suspension of House rules—were scheduled to be put forward on the House floor, including a measure with overwhelming Republican support to present the U.S. Capitol Police with a Congressional Gold Medal. These plans were scrapped because Roy and Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene expressed their intent to demand recorded roll call votes for each bill. As this parliamentary maneuver would have forced voting to go into the early morning, the leadership rescheduled the voting.[98] Of the delay, Roy said, \"We need to continue to have conversations about every bill that's moving through the floor.\" He held that instead of the suspension calendar being \"done right\", the Democratic leadership was \"jamming through 10 Democrat bills [and] three Republican bills on a Monday we fly back, while we're jamming through a $2 trillion bill which we have no say in, while we've got fences around the Capitol, we've metal detectors, etc. …We need to have a conversation in this town about how to make the House work again. That's what we're doing.\"[99] He said his motivation was to force conversations over how to make Congress \"work better\" as \"This place is completely dysfunctional.\"[98] Roy also criticized the Democratic leadership for doing away with the \"motion to recommit\", which Republicans in the previous Congress had used to force last-minute changes to legislation on the House floor.[100] House Minority Whip Steve Scalise made clear the House Republican leadership had not planned or approved Roy's remarks, but also said he too wanted \"to see an open process.\"[100] Not all of the GOP Leadership opposed Roy; Conference Chair Liz Cheney said, \"This process is not going to be able to continue smoothly as long as the Democrats continue to try to ram pieces of legislation through without adequate hearings, without adequate debate and discussion, without adequate ability to offer amendments, without a motion to recommit. …The majority needs to understand we are not interested in a situation where they have taken away so many rights of the minority and they expect things are going to operate smoothly. It shouldn't be a surprise to anyone that this is going on.\"[100] Democrats characterized the moves as producing nothing but pointless delay and agitation.[100] They singled out Greene as merely attention-seeking due to having been stripped of her committee assignments in February, and her repeated disruptions of the legislative process (such as discussion of the Equality Act) by use of \"motions to adjourn debate\", forcing members to hurry to the House floor to vote to remain in session.[101][102] The Republican caucus, increasingly annoyed by Greene's tactics, were more supportive of Roy's, as the timing allowed both the protest to gain attention, along with a rescheduling that prevented mass disruption.[102] Hoyer and Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy held talks on how to address Roy's and Greene's maneuvers.[100][103] In its coverage of the episode, Politico called Roy \"a master of procedural delays on the floor.\"[100] Due to changes in the rules on account of the COVID-19 pandemic, each roll-call vote took at least an additional 45 minutes longer than under normal circumstances, and a growing number of Republicans joined with Democrats in complaining about the delays. Among the bills that were rescheduled due to Roy's procedural protest was one giving Congressional Gold Medals to the Capitol Police and the assisting police forces who withstood the January 6 attack on the Capitol. When the measure received a roll call vote on March 17, it did not pass with unanimous support. Twelve Republicans voted against it, objecting to the use of the word \"insurrectionists\".[104][105][106] Roy, who had earlier said, \"These words all matter, right? …I have to study the language fully\", supported the measure.[107] The final vote tally was 413–12.[106][108] The bill moved to the Senate, which had passed its own version. A new bill was created to resolve the differences between the two versions. The largest change was the addition of having a medal displayed inside the Capitol itself, and lines that added those Capitol Police officers who suffered under the car ramming attack on a Senate security barricade on April 2, 2021. The revised bill returned to the House and was put up for a vote on June 15. Despite his vote in March, Roy joined 20 other Republicans in voting against this version, which passed, 406–21.[109][110] Roy released a statement saying the original \"legislation has since been amended to include events that have absolutely nothing to do with January 6th. Instead of honoring our men and women of law enforcement, Democrats are playing political games with the tragedy of April 2, 2021.\"[111] Roy defended Representative Liz Cheney when the House voted to strip her of her position as chair of the House Republican Conference over her criticism of Trump. On January 13, 2021, he said: \"It has come to my attention that a number of my colleagues are circulating calls for Liz Cheney to step down from, or to be removed as, chair of the Republican Conference for her position in support of impeachment of the president. I reject this call, and offer my support. …there can be little debate that, among other things, the president's pressure exerted on Vice President Pence to violate his oath, and the false hope it sent to emotionally charged supporters, was wrong, troubling, and impeachable. Liz should be commended, not condemned, for standing up in defense of the Constitution and standing true to her beliefs.\"[112] On May 11, Roy released a memo calling the conference to be clear that the controversy over Cheney was not about her position that the election \"was not stolen\", but rather that she had \"forfeited her ability to be our spokesperson by pulling us into distraction. …looking backwards while repeatedly and unhelpfully engaging in personal attacks and finger-wagging towards President Trump rather than leading the conference forward with a unifying message.\" He said the conference should be \"fighting to stop the radical Democrat agenda\" rather than \"falling prey to the high drama of swamp politics.\"[113] After Representative Elise Stefanik announced that she would run to succeed Cheney, Roy and other conservative Republicans had discussed concerns over Stefanik's comparably moderate voting record, with Roy taking the lead in this group.[114] His May 11 memo accused Stefanik of campaigning as a Republican but supporting the Democrats' agenda once sworn in. Representative Lance Gooden told a reporter that with the amount of support Stefanik had gathered, her victory seemed virtually assured, so \"One of the problems of those who had issues with Elise were that no one had really stepped forward to run against her, they were being critical, but no one really seemed to have the nerve to put their name down. So it seems as if Chip Roy is that candidate.\"[115] Roy's fundraising campaign sent out donation requests that emphasized his opposition to Cheney.[115] Cheney was ultimately ousted from her position as chair by voice vote with no one objecting.[116] By May 13, shortly before a scheduled candidate forum, Roy officially announced his candidacy for the position. He cited what he saw as Stefanik's lack of conservative qualifications and the rapid pace of the process as his reasons for running.[117] (After Cheney was ousted that Wednesday, McCarthy had scheduled the forum for Thursday evening and the vote for Friday morning.)[118] After Trump released a statement opposing Roy,[119] the conservative group FreedomWorks came out in support of Roy, saying they were pleased to hear of his nomination, and that \"Rep. Roy has a lifetime 100% voting record on our scorecard. He has demonstrated that Republicans can legislate based on conservative principles and also get elected in competitive districts.\"[119] Around 60 House Republicans gathered for the candidate forum to hear pitches between Roy and Stefanik to take over the position. The forum was described as a friendly and formal back-and-forth, with Roy contending that he was the more conservative choice, and Stefanik emphasizing her work to elect GOP women along with her ability to fundraise. Both promised to set aside their personal views to better deliver party messaging.[118] Some attendees told reporters that they felt many in the audience had previously decided who they would support before the forum was even held. Roy did not respond to any questions after the forum: \"We are going to have a vote tomorrow in the Republican conference.\"[118] When asked whether Trump's endorsement of Stefanik and bashing of him concerned him, Roy likened the reporters to \"vultures\" and said: \"This is all D.C. swamp business.\"[118] In contrast, Stefanik called the forum a \"great discussion\", said she had cross-conference support and \"we are in a strong position.\" On May 14, the day of the election, Representative Ken Buck of the Freedom Caucus formally nominated Roy, and his nomination was seconded by Boebert.[120] Roy lost the election to Stefanik in a secret ballot, 134–46.[120] Afterward he released a statement congratulating Stefanik, but taking pride in being able to \"provide an alternative with a proven record of standing up not for politicians—but for freedom, the Constitution, and the conservative principles Americans hold dear.\"[120] Roy did not support the House measure to create the January 6 commission. He held that forming a commission was not \"a responsible and proper way\" to investigate the issue, and that \"The proposed commission does not have powers that existing law enforcement and existing congressional committees don't already have; however, it does have an unlimited budget and a vague mandate.\"[121] The bill passed the House on May 19, 2021, by a vote of 252 to 175.[121] On May 13, Roy and Representative Thomas Massie sent Attorney General Merrick Garland a letter expressing concern that those facing federal charges for participation in the January 6 rioters would be subject to \"overly aggressive tactics, overcharge, and abuse of power of the federal government in order to satisfy favored political groups.\"[122] They claimed that they had heard reports that Assistant U.S. Attorneys were not allowed discretion to \"enter into plea deals without permission from political appointees\" at the Department of Justice.[122] They also wrote, \"there are disturbing reports of heavily armed teams of federal agents bursting into family homes to arrest individuals with no history or likelihood of violence\", and demanded congressional oversight of the prosecutions.[122] When Massie's office was asked their sources for the reports, they responded, \"Mr. Roy's office has spoken with attorneys handling these cases and we can't comment any further than that.\"[122] Emmett Till Antilynching Act Roy, Andrew Clyde and Thomas Massie were the only House members to vote against The Emmett Till Antilynching Act, which passed the 117th United States Congress.[123] On January 3, 2023, at the beginning of the 118th Congress, during the election of the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, Roy nominated and voted for Byron Donalds for Speaker, in rebuke of House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy.[124] Roy became a leader in the negotiation process for the holdouts against McCarthy.[125] Roy and his group of about 20 wanted: (1) to bring down the threshold for calling a vote of no confidence against the speaker to one member, (2) more enforcement to allow more time to read bills, (3) a greater role for the House Freedom Caucus in Republican leadership,[126] requiring Republican leadership to refrain from being involved in primary elections,[125] and (4) an end to U.S. aid to Ukraine.[127] Roy switched his vote to McCarthy on the 12th, 13th, 14th, and 15th ballots. During the October 2023 Speaker election, as the House Republican Conference considered choosing Majority Leader Steve Scalise or Judiciary Committee chair Jim Jordan as their nominee for Speaker, Roy (who supported Jordan) made a proposal that would have required 217 of the 221 members to support the eventual nominee before a floor vote could be held; the idea was tabled 135-88.[128] Jordan was ultimately nominated, and Roy voted for him on the first three floor ballots. On the fourth ballot, Roy, along with all other present Republicans, voted for the new nominee Mike Johnson, who was elected Speaker. In December 2024, Roy opposed raising the United States debt ceiling.[129] As a result, Donald Trump criticised him and encouraged Texas Republicans to consider a primary challenge.[130] During the 117th Congress, Roy voted with President Joe Biden's stated position 1.8% of the time according to a FiveThirtyEight analysis.[133] On March 13, 2020, Trump declared the COVID-19 pandemic a national emergency, allowing access to billions in aid. The same day, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Speaker Nancy Pelosi concluded negotiations for a COVID-19 relief bill. The $2.2 billion measure included funding for free testing for the uninsured, paid sick leave, $1 billion for food aid, and extended unemployment along with other measures to address Americans affected by the pandemic. The next morning, Roy was among the Republican representatives who voted against the bill, calling it \"welfare\".[134][135] The bill passed 363–40.[136] As the pandemic began to spread, Maine Governor Janet Mills released an executive order on April 3 calling on out-of-state visitors to self-quarantine for 14 days after entering Maine.[137] This was seen as a response to Mainers, especially in coastal communities, who were complaining that non-residents were trying to escape more crowded urban areas and endangering the community. Mills made a point not to authorize investigating people solely due to out-of-state license plates, so that military or health care workers who had come to the state would not feel harassed.[137] Maine's law enforcement held that the order would be difficult to enforce due to limited staffing and that it was mainly an effort to have neighbors encourage each other to comply with the rules. Cumberland County Sheriff Kevin Joyce told reporters, \"If we receive a complaint we will send a deputy to educate the person about the quarantine but trying to build a case or enforce the order is unrealistic.\"[138] On April 6, Roy guested on The Mark Levin Show and criticized governors like Mills who had responded forcefully to the pandemic, saying that they were following projections about infections that were mere guesses \"not even [based on statistical] models, they are fingers in the air. And they are throwing them out there and they are causing the American people to freak out and panic instead of going through this logically.\"[139] Roy agreed with Mark Levin that governors in \"states who barely have this virus\" who were issuing stay-at-home orders were overreacting, saying, \"Well, I am glad that there's a number of governors who haven't. …And there was a Maine sheriff today who basically told the Maine governor to pound sand. He is not going to go around and check people when they are driving around the state of Maine. And we need more of that. We need more rational human beings who are going to step back and say 'No, this isn't a police state. This isn't Nazi Germany. This isn't Russia. We are not going to do that. What we're going to do is have common sense discussions on what we can do to make things better.'\"[139] Roy also said that state authorities defining which businesses were essential was a form of tyranny: \"I always get entertained or really frankly ticked off at these local county judges and mayors and these little tinpot dictators that are making decisions about peoples' lives when they declare what is and is not an essential business. ..You know what? Any business is essential to its owner and the people who work there. Every single one of them... and all the central planners effectively are deciding how we live our lives.\"[139][140] In May 2020, Roy said, \"We need immune systems that are strong. We need immunity systems that can fight this... We need herd immunity.\" Asked whether acquiring such immunity would entail unnecessary deaths, Roy said that the countrywide stay-at-home orders and attendant delays in accessing cancer screenings or entering into addiction treatment, as well as mental health problems precipitated by unemployment, had increased indirect deaths and suffering.[140] In July 2020, Roy blamed surging coronavirus cases in Southern Texas on \"people coming across our border\" from Mexico. At the time, the border with Mexico had been closed for all nonessential activity since March.[141] In a July 28 appearance with talk show host Steve Deace, Roy suggested that the stay-at-home orders imposed in response to the pandemic were a part of \"a fraud being perpetrated on the American people of fear. We are literally, purposely allowing the government...we are purposely causing fear among the American people by virtue of the actions or inactions of our government leaders and then allowing the media to spin up that fear. That is unfortunate and it is costing lives and it's costing economic activity, it's costing jobs and it's costing mental health, and it's frankly undermining our national security and the health of our nation, and frankly I don't think that's accidental. I think that is all about design and all about reclaiming power in November and I think on November fourth there'll be a magic awakening of how we can suddenly beat the virus. …[We need to] start raising a fuss, say 'this is my country. I want my country back, and I want to live healthily and I don't want a bureaucrat government or insurance or otherwise standing between me and my doctor; me and my ability to stay healthy; me and my ability to live free.' And that's what's happening and we need to stop it.\"[142][143] Roy said that Texas was holding COVID-19 cases down; in fact, cases were surging in Texas at the time.[141] Later that month, after Representative Louie Gohmert tested positive for COVID-19, Roy said he did not plan to isolate himself even though he had had a recent maskless interaction with Gohmert on the House floor.[144] Roy retweeted a comment by Deace on November 13 that said, \"We are not going to honor any of these CDC Thanksgiving guidelines, and instead will intentionally violate them all. But thanks.\" Roy's tweet added, \"I will do whatever I want to do on Thanksgiving. Period. #StandUpForAmerica\".[145] Two days later, Roy retweeted his earlier tweet and added, \"I apologize to the folks who have raised concerns that I said 'I will do whatever I want to do on Thanksgiving. Period.' I should have been more clear, so here it goes: 'I will do whatever I want to do on Thanksgiving … or any other day … Period.'\"[146] On December 23, 2020, Roy joined Trump's opposition to a recently passed $900 billion COVID-19 relief package, saying, \"This bill is an irresponsible swamp bill. It is the merger of an omnibus bill that is bloated with typical wasteful spending, on top of a relief bill that has a whole lot of things in it that frankly aren't all that focused on relief. The president's right to call B.S. on this ridiculous bill. Both parties are at fault. …The American people don't just want another check, they want us to do our job like they have to do when they sit around their kitchen table and small businesses have to do when they are trying to make ends meet and America's leadership in Washington refuses to do what they have to do.\"[147] After Republican leadership pushed back on Trump's claim that the bipartisan legislation was a \"disgrace\", Trump signed the bill, which was attached to a $1.4 trillion spending measure to keep the government running through September 2021.[148] On January 12, 2021, the House implemented a rule about wearing masks on the floor, with violators to receive a warning and then fines that would be deducted from their salary and could not be paid out of campaign funds or expense accounts. Roy joined about a dozen Republican House members, led by Marjorie Taylor Greene and including Thomas Massie, Lauren Boebert, Ralph Norman, Beth Van Duyne, Louis Gohmert, and Mary Miller, in a protest against mask wearing in the chamber on May 18, 2021. They positioned themselves in front of C-SPAN cameras, grouping together to take selfies and posting them on Twitter. Despite House Republicans' formal effort to set the rule aside on May 19, 2021, it was kept in place, with the Capitol physician reiterating, \"Extra precautions are necessary given the substantial number of partially vaccinated, unvaccinated, and vaccine-indeterminate individuals.\"[149] Roy was among the Republican House members reprimanded for not wearing a mask on the House floor. He was warned that additional instances would result in $500 fine (with fines going up to $2,500 thereafter).[150] He did not respond to reporters asking whether he had been vaccinated.[151][149] Roy was one of three House Republicans to vote \"present\" on a resolution condemning Trump's action of withdrawing forces from Syria.[152] Along with Matt Gaetz and a handful of Republicans, Roy broke with his party and voted to end Saudi assistance to the War in Yemen.[153] In March 2021, Roy was one of 14 House Republicans to vote against a measure condemning the Myanmar coup d'état (Paul Gosar voted \"present\").[154] After the vote, The Washington Post noted a pattern of a small group of House Republicans, including Roy, who on several occasions \"objected to what would seem to most observers as an unobjectionable proposal.\"[155] It described them as an \"emerging far-right 'no' caucus …a consistent cohort of House Republicans who are uniting to constitute much of the minority on measures that otherwise pass overwhelmingly. …[united by] staunchly right-wing politics and, in many cases, a penchant for media attention.\"[155] In June 2021, Roy was one of 49 House Republicans to vote to repeal the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002.[156] In September 2021, Roy was among 75 House Republicans to vote against the National Defense Authorization Act of 2022, which contains a provision that would require women to be drafted.[157][158] Roy was among 19 House Republicans to vote against the final passage of the 2022 National Defense Authorization Act.[159] In July 2022, Roy was one of 18 Republicans to vote against ratifying Sweden's and Finland's applications for NATO membership.[160] In 2023, Roy was among 47 Republicans to vote in favor of H.Con.Res. 21 which directed President Joe Biden to remove U.S. troops from Syria within 180 days.[161][162] In December 2023, Roy introduced legislation to withdraw the United States from the United Nations, titled the \"Disengaging Entirely from the United Nations Debacle (DEFUND) Act.\"[163][164][165] On March 19, 2024, Roy voted NAY to House Resolution 149 Condemning the illegal abduction and forcible transfer of children from Ukraine to the Russian Federation. He was one of nine Republicans to do so.[166] During a congressional hearing held in the wake of a mass shooting in Atlanta that killed eight people, including six Asian American women, Roy questioned whether the committee's attempts to prevent hate crimes and hate incidents against Asian Americans would hamper free speech. His opening statement also included a remark that appeared to advocate lynching: \"There are old sayings in Texas about find all the rope in Texas and get a tall oak tree. We take justice very seriously. And we ought to do that. Round up the bad guys.\" His statements prompted criticism from Democrats, including Representative Grace Meng, who said, \"This hearing was to address the hurt and pain of our community, to find solutions. And we will not let you take our voice from us.\"[167][168][169] After the hearing, Roy declined to apologize and complained about \"Chinese Communists who seek to destroy us\" while clarifying that he meant the discussion should focus on \"taking out bad guys\" instead of addressing issues like hate speech.[167][168][169] Texas GOP chair and former Florida congressman Allen West wrote that Roy's remarks \"were inappropriate and unfortunate ... While his comments about hanging were dumb, they're not grounds for resignation ... My recommendation to Congressman Chip Roy would be to engage the brain before firing the mouth ... It would avoid embarrassing situations such as this.\"[170] On May 18, 2021, Roy was one of 62 Republicans to vote against a bill that ordered the Department of Justice to expedite the review of COVID-19-related hate crimes reported to law enforcement and help establish ways to report indictments online. The bill also directed the Department of Justice to perform public outreach on the issue, and instructed the Attorney General and the Department of Health and Human Services to issue best-practice guidance on how to mitigate racially discriminatory language for describing the pandemic.[171] Roy explained his opposition before the vote, saying, \"We can't legislate away hate. The perspective of many of us is that we don't need new laws, we don't need more committees, and we don't need more bureaucracy. We need to give our police the resources they need to do their job. We need to make sure that we are rooting out crime wherever it may exist between whatever communities it may exist. We need more emphasis on family, more emphasis on community, more emphasis on the Lord Almighty, and less reliance on the federal government to make our communities better. …The concern of many on my side of the aisle is in this continued sordid business of divvying us up on race and focusing on race. We have spent the better part of the last year rightfully concerned, focused, and outraged on what we saw with respect to Mr. Floyd. But we have had a continued focus on race over the last year, and I think one can look at the impact on communities and the impact on Black communities throughout the United States' cities, businesses that have been closed down, and crime sprees that have occurred and wonder what this continued focus on race is doing to better our great nation.\"[171][172] Roy was one of 14 Republicans to vote against the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act, which passed, 415–14. The bill recognized as a public holiday a commemoration of June 19, 1865, the day slaves in Galveston, Texas, learned that two and a half years earlier President Abraham Lincoln had issued the Emancipation Proclamation freeing any slave held in rebel states. Roy took issue with the bill's name, saying, \"Juneteenth should be commemorated …[but] the holiday should not be called 'Juneteenth National Independence Day' but rather 'Juneteenth National Emancipation (or Freedom or otherwise) Day.' This name needlessly divides our nation on a matter that should instead bring us together by creating a separate Independence Day based on the color of one's skin.\"[173][174] On June 28, 2019, Roy responded to stories of people being turned away after attempting to donate goods (such as diapers, soaps, sanitary wipes, and toys) to migrant children and families being held by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The rejection was due to the Antideficiency Act, which mandates that government agencies cannot accept donations or spend any money other than that allocated by Congress. Roy put forward a bill called the Charitable Donations Freedom Act, which would amend the mandate to allow donations of goods. In response to worries that the wording may be too broad and limit Congressional oversight, Roy said he was willing to \"work to make sure it's not either too narrow or too broad.\"[175] On June 28, 2019, the bill was referred to the House Committee on Oversight and Reform.[176] In a July 2019 hearing on border detention conditions, in order to emphasize that she was telling the truth, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez asked to be sworn in, taking the role of a witness at a House panel before relating a story about a migrant woman who said she had to drink water from a toilet because her sink broke. In response, Roy accused her of political theatrics and playing to her Twitter followers.[177] On February 10, 2021, Roy coauthored a letter with 50 other members of Congress criticizing President Joe Biden for refocusing treatment of immigrants under Title 42 health regulations, rather than Title 8, which deals with asylum claims, primarily Homeland Security and Executive Office for Immigration Review matters.[178] Roy voted against the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act of 2019 which would amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to eliminate the per-country numerical limitation for employment-based immigrants, to increase the per-country numerical limitation for family-sponsored immigrants, and for other purposes.[179] Roy voted against the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020 which authorizes DHS to nearly double the available H-2B visas for the remainder of FY 2020.[180][181] Roy voted against Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 1158),[182] which effectively prohibits ICE from cooperating with Health and Human Services to detain or remove illegal alien sponsors of unaccompanied alien children (UACs).[citation needed] He has received past endorsements from anti-immigration groups such as NumbersUSA and the Federation for American Immigration Reform.[183] Roy has stated that the percentage of the population of the United States in 2024 that is foreign-born is the highest in history. Roy said that this high percentage is a threat to western values, and that the children of immigrants are not being raised to respect the U.S. Constitution and capitalism. In a congressional speech on May 8th 2024 in which Roy warned of the high foreign-born population in the United States, Roy also claimed that there has been a “massive Muslim takeover of the United Kingdom.\" Roy further said he had \"pretty strong concerns about Sharia law and whether that will be forced upon the American people.\"[184][185][186] In 2024, Roy defended Trump's plan to \"deport 20 million people\" if elected president by writing on X that he wanted to \"ethnic cleanse\" white progressive Democrats by deporting them.[187] Roy is an outspoken critic of gun control, having made several speeches in support of gun rights.[188] The NRA Political Victory Fund has repeatedly given him an \"A\" rating and endorsement.[189][190][183] Roy voiced strong opposition to a March 2021 House Republican secret ballot of 102–84 to return earmarks to internal rules, saying, \"It is the currency of corruption in Washington. We shouldn't do it. The Republican party should be ashamed of themselves. …I think we've got $30 trillion in debt and people are tired of the swamp and the GOP should be ashamed of itself, if it jumps headfirst right back into the swamp.\"[191][192] He signed and circulated a letter along with 17 other members of his conference promising never to request earmarks for their districts.[191] In 2022, Roy was one of 39 Republicans to vote for the Merger Filing Fee Modernization Act of 2022, an antitrust package that would crack down on corporations for anti-competitive behavior.[193][194] Roy was among the 71 Republicans who voted against final passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 in the House.[195] Roy met his wife, Carrah, at the University of Texas. They have two children. Roy was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma in 2011.[13] Roy has said his religious faith informs his political positions, including his opposition to the Equality Act, which he has characterized as trying to prevent his family from being able to \"carry out our beliefs without penalty\".[200] He has pointed to his generational connection to the Baptist faith, which includes his great-grandfather working as the janitor for the First Baptist Church.[201] Roy is a member of Hyde Park Baptist Church in Austin; the church is part of the Southern Baptists of Texas Convention.[202]",

                "title": "Republican Chip Roy responds to Donald Trump's primary threat : \"No apologies\" - Newsweek",
                "content": "Representative Chip Roy, a Texas Republican, responded to President-elect Donald Trump's call for him to face a primary challenge on Thursday. \"My position is simple - I am not going to raise or suspend the debt ceiling (racking up more debt) without significant & real spending cuts attached to it. I've been negotiating to that end. No apologies,\" Roy wrote in a post to X (formerly Twitter). The confrontation comes as House Republicans scramble to pass a bill to fund the federal government and avoid a government shutdown less than a week before Christmas. Roy, a staunch conservative, is among the lawmakers who oppose raising the debt ceiling, which Trump has deemed \"unnecessary\" amid negotiations on the spending bill, known as a continuing resolution (CR). The debt ceiling is a a statutory limit on how much the federal government can borrow. It has long been a sticking point in policy debates fro Congress, which has raised or suspended it at several points to avoid defaulting on national debt. Critics, however, say that eliminating the limit would be bad for the country's long-term economic strength. Roy responded to a Truth Social post from Trump, who accused Roy of \"getting in the way\" of a deal. Trump wrote that \"Republican obstructionists have to be done away with,\" and that Roy should be \"dismissed as being utterly unknowledgeable as to the ways of politics, and as to Making America Great Again.\" \"Chip Roy is just another ambitious guy, with no talent. By the way, how's Bob Good doing? I hope some talented challengers are getting ready in the Great State of Texas to go after Chip in the Primary. He won't have a chance!\" Trump posted. Roy opposes raising the debt limit, which Trump has come out in support of. The president-elect told NBC News eliminating the debt ceiling would be the \"smartest thing it [Congress] could do.\" \"The Democrats have said they want to get rid of it. If they want to get rid of it, I would lead the charge,\" he said. Trump earlier said Republicans supporting the original CR proposed by House Speaker Mike Johnson this week should be primaried. Former Vice President Mike Pence on X: \"Congressman Chip Roy is one of the most principled conservatives in Washington DC and people across this country are grateful for his stand against runaway federal spending. We just can't keep piling trillions in debt on our children and grandchildren.\" Radio Host Dana Loesch on X: \"Why?@chiproytx is one of the best conservative fighters in Congress. He is popular here in Texas. Why are we picking fights with proven conservative stalwarts and not the left? Why is he speaking more harshly of Chip Roy than Mike Johnson?\" Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, on X: \"I agree with President-elect Trump that Congress should terminate the debt limit and never again govern by hostage taking.\" Trump announced on Truth Social Thursday afternoon that he supports a new spending package reached by House Speaker Mike Johnson that would \"keep the Government open, fund our Great Farmers and others, and provide relief for those severely impacted by the devastating hurricanes.\" He encouraged all members of Congress to vote in support of the bill Thursday night.
