                "content": "The first meteor shower of the New Year also has the potential to be one of the year's best – if the weather cooperates. But astronomers lament that the Quadrantid meteors tend to fall short of expectations due to the comparatively short length of their maximum activity and the obscuring wintry conditions of early January. That doesn't mean the cosmic display – one of the few meteor showers to be caused by debris from an asteroid instead of a comet – isn't worth seeking out. Stargazers could be treated to a host of bright fireballs and the sight of multiple meteors per hour whizzing across the night sky at more than 25 miles per second when the Quadrantids reach their peak. Here's what to know about the Quadrantid meteor shower, including when it peaks and what causes it. Meteor showers occur on a predictable schedule each year, with some lasting for mere days and others stretching on for weeks. A meteor shower is at its best when the Earth passes through the densest part of the associated cosmic debris. That window, otherwise known as the shower's peak activity, is when stargazers will want to be on the lookout for meteors. The Quadrantids began zipping through the skies on Dec. 26 and will continue through Jan. 16, according to the American Meteor Society. But while most meteor showers have a two-day peak, the Quadrantids' maximum activity only lasts a few hours – making the meteors much more difficult to spot, according to NASA. For stargazers, that means the best time to catch the Quadrantid meteors will be in the predawn hours Thursday night into Friday morning, astronomers say. Timeanddate.com offers a detailed schedule for when to see the Quadrantids. The Quadrantids are best viewed from the Northern Hemisphere and are not well seen from the Southern Hemisphere. During its peak, anywhere from 60 to 200 Quadrantid meteors can be seen per hour under ideal conditions, according to NASA. While the meteors are known to lack persistent tails, they often produce bright fireballs, which are larger explosions of light persisting longer than an average meteor streak. The meteors seem to emerge – or radiate – from an obsolete constellation called \"Quadrans Muralis\" that today is located between the constellations of Bootes and Draco near the end of the handle of the Big Dipper, NASA says. Both the constellation and the shower are named after the quadrant, an early astronomical instrument used to observe and plot star positions. Astronomers caution that the radiant is not a good guide for where stargazers should look to view the streaking meteors, which should be visible across the night sky. Here are some general viewing tips from NASA: ◾ Find an area well away from street lights and the light pollution of cities. ◾ Come prepared for winter temperatures with a sleeping bag, blanket, or lawn chair. ◾ Lie flat on your back with your feet facing northeast and look up, taking in as much of the sky as possible. It should take less than 30 minutes for your eyes to adapt so that you can see streaking meteors. Meteor showers occur when Earth passes through dusty debris trails left by comets and other space objects as they orbit the sun. The debris – space rocks known as meteoroids – collides with Earth's atmosphere at high speed and disintegrates, creating fiery and colorful streaks in the sky, according to NASA. Those resulting fireballs, better known as \"shooting stars,\" are meteors. If meteoroids survive their trip to Earth without burning up in the atmosphere, they are called meteorites, NASA says. Unlike most meteor showers, the Quadrantid meteor shower doesn't originate from a comet, but from an asteroid. For many years, the origin of the Quadrantids remained unknown. Though the Quadrantids were first seen in 1825, it wasn't until 2003 that an astronomer at Lowell Observatory in Arizona discovered a small asteroid, 2003 EH1, was the source of the shower. Astronomers theorize that 2003 EH1, which takes about 5 ½ years to orbit the sun, is a dead comet that is now essentially a rock. Eric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

With no time to waste in 2025, the first celestial show of the year gets underway this week with the Quadrantid meteor shower peak. NASA said the Quadrantid meteor shower is unique because of its brief peak and the origin of the shooting stars. Most meteor showers originate from comet debris, but the Quadrantids come from an asteroid.

Astronomers say this asteroid could be a new object known as a \"dead comet\" or \"rock comet.\" DON'T MISS THESE CELESTIAL EVENTS IN 2025 Although the Quadrantids have been observed in the night sky since the early 1800s, their origin was only discovered in 2003.

(Photo by Tayfun Coskun/Anadolu via Getty Images) Also, unlike other annual meteor showers, which peak over several days, the Quadrantids are a quick skygazing show. The peak lasts just six hours. According to NASA, this brief encounter is because the Earth crosses the thin stream of particles at a perpendicular angle. According to the American Meteor Society (AMS), this year's peak happens Friday, with the best chance of seeing meteors early Friday morning. During the peak, as many as 200 meteors can be seen under perfect weather and viewing conditions. The timing of this year's Quadrantid meteor shower peaks between 15:00 and 18:00 UTC (10 a.m. and 1 p.m. EST), which favors those in Hawaii and Alaska, according to AMS Editor Robert Lunsford. The cloud cover forecast for Friday morning. (FOX Weather) While early January doesn't offer the best weather for stargazing, the peak this year happens a few days after a new Moon with only 11% illumination. This means less moonlight to compete with the meteor shower. Unfortunately, cloud cover will cover many parts of the U.S. with active winter weather happening. According to the AMS, the Quadrantids continue through mid-January, when an average of 25 meteors per hour are possible under good conditions.

                "title": "2025 Quadrantid meteor shower to peak January 3",
                "content": "A daily update by email. Science news, great photos, sky alerts. The Quadrantid meteor shower is one of a few each year with a narrow peak, in this case lasting only about 6 hours. When to watch: The best time to watch for the 2025 Quadrantids is the hours before dawn on January 3. (The predicted peak** is 19 UTC on January 3). Nearest moon phase: A first quarter moon will come at 23:56 UTC on January 6, 2025 (5:56 p.m. CST) so the moon will be a waxing crescent and set a few hours after sunset on January 2 and not interfere with the Quadrantid meteors. Radiant: Rises in the north-northeast after midnight and is highest up before dawn. The radiant point for the Quadrantids is in a now-obsolete constellation, Quadrans Muralis the Mural Quadrant. Nowadays, we see the radiant near the famous Big Dipper asterism. Because the Quadrantid radiant is far to the north on the sky’s dome, this is mostly a far-northern shower, not as good for the Southern Hemisphere. Expected meteors at peak, under ideal conditions: Under a dark sky with no moon, when the radiant is high in the sky, the Quadrantids can (briefly) produce over 100 meteors per hour. Duration of shower: The Quadrantid meteor shower runs from mid-November through mid-January each year, according to this 2017 article in the journal Icarus. You might see a Quadrantid streak by any time during that interval. But most activity is centered on the peak. This time period is when we’re passing through the meteor stream in space! Note: The Quadrantid shower is one of four major meteor showers each year with a sharp peak (the other three are the Lyrids, Leonids and Ursids). Report a fireball (very bright meteor) to the American Meteor Society: it’s fun and easy! From the late, great Don Machholz (1952-2022), who discovered 12 comets … For many years, the parent comet for the Quadrantids remained unknown. That’s because astronomers were looking for an object whose orbit matched the orbit of the Quadrantids’ meteor stream. Other meteor showers do have parent objects whose orbits match their meteor streams. But the Quadrantids’ parent object – or objects – are different. There are currently at least two related objects associated with Quadrantid meteors. Neither presently comes anywhere near Earth’s orbit. But both seem to be responsible for these early January meteors. The chief object that spawns the Quadrantids is an asteroid named 2003 EH1. It’s believed to be a dormant or extinct comet. The Lowell Observatory Near-Earth-Object Search (LONEOS) based near Flagstaff, Arizona, found asteroid 2003 EH1 on March 6, 2003. The asteroid takes 5.5 years to orbit the sun. Its closest point to the sun (perihelion) is 1.2 astronomical units (AU). One AU is the distance between the Earth and the sun. In past centuries, 2003 EH1 must have passed much closer to the Earth’s orbit. Now, though, this asteroid stays well outside Earth’s orbit. Yet particles ejected from this asteroid do intersect Earth’s orbit, to produce the Quadrantids’ narrow peak. And astronomers now say there is also a second, related object that also contributes to this meteor shower. The second object – Comet 96P/Machholz – produces a less intense and shallower peak. The material we see streaking across the sky left this comet centuries ago. Its perihelion distance is 0.12 AU, and it orbits the sun every 5.3 years. It was back near the Earth in late January 2023. 2025 EarthSky lunar calendar is available now. A unique and beautiful poster-sized calendar with phases of the moon for every night of the year. Get yours today! What’s the story on these two parent objects for the Quadrantids? The latest theory is that a large comet was captured by our sun and settled into a short-period orbit in about 2,000 BCE. This comet supplied meteors to the inner solar system and then it broke apart sometime between 100 CE and 950 CE. This breakup produced the Machholz Complex. In other words, there are multiple resultant offspring of this great comet. They are Comet 96P/Machholz, the Marsden Comet Group, the Kracht Comet Group, asteroid 2003 EH1 and eight meteor showers. The group is named the Machholz Complex after the main object, 96P/Machholz. A comet that was seen more than 500 years ago, C/1490 Y1, might be involved, too. The orbit calculated for this comet comes from rough positions calculated for the comet’s predicted return, which should be every few years. But we have not seen this comet again. One study suggests it approached too close to the planet Jupiter. So it might have been thrown out of the solar system. That might be why we haven’t seen it since 1490. Or, the comet might have split up prior to its next return, producing the Machholz Complex. This is not the final word about the parent objects of the Quadrantid meteor shower. Research continues among orbit calculators to better understand the transition of material from the surface of these objects to our Earth’s atmosphere every January. A new paper comes out nearly every year on the subject. That is how science works. Regardless of their origins, the Quadrantid meteor shower is a fine way to start a new year. The radiant point of the Quadrantid shower makes an approximate right angle with the Big Dipper and the bright star Arcturus. If you trace the paths of the Quadrantid meteors backward, they appear to radiate from this point on the starry sky. See chart at the top of this page. Now for our usual caveat. You don’t need to find the meteor shower radiant to see the Quadrantid meteors. You need to be at mid-northern or far-northern latitudes, up in the wee hours of the morning, and hope the peak comes at just the right time to your part of the world. The meteors will radiate from the northern sky but appear in all parts of the sky. Most meteor showers get their name from the constellations from which they appear to radiate. So it is with the Quadrantids. But the Quadrantids’ constellation no longer exists, except in memory. The name Quadrantid comes from the constellation Quadrans Muralis (Mural Quadrant). French astronomer Jerome Lalande created this constellation in 1795. This now-obsolete constellation was between the constellations of Boötes the Herdsman and Draco the Dragon. What happened to it? Where’d it go? To understand the history of the Quadrantids’ name, we go back to the earliest observations of this meteor shower. In early January 1825, Antonio Brucalassi in Italy reported that: … the atmosphere was traversed by a multitude of the luminous bodies known by the name of falling stars. They appeared to radiate from Quadrans Muralis. In 1839, two men, Adolphe Quetelet of Brussels Observatory in Belgium and Edward C. Herrick in Connecticut, independently suggested the Quadrantids as an annual shower. Then, in 1922, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) created a list of the 88 modern constellations. And it did not include Quadrans Muralis. Hardly anyone would remember this old constellation, if not for the Quadrantid meteor shower. The Quadrantids favor the Northern Hemisphere because their radiant is so far north on the sky’s dome. If you’re in the Southern Hemisphere, you might be tempted to resign yourself to the months-long meteor drought that kicks off every year and ends in April with the Lyrids. But, once in a while, we do hear from Southern Hemisphere dwellers who’ve seen a few Quadrantids! Bottom line: The best time to watch the Quadrantid meteor shower in 2025 is the hours before dawn on January 3, in a moon-free sky. This shower has a narrow peak, lasting only hours. **Peak times for meteor showers provided by Robert Lunsford of the American Meteor Society. Note that meteor shower predicted peaks may vary.

The Quadrantid meteor shower is active from late December 2024 to early January 2025. It will peak on 3–4 January. Read on for tips on how to catch the best view of this stunning shower from planetary scientist and meteorite expert Dr Ashley King. Meteors are often called shooting stars, though the bright streaks you see in the sky don’t have anything to do with stars. In fact, what you’re wishing on are tiny particles of dust – leftovers from the birth of our solar system – vaporising in Earth’s atmosphere. Some of the more spectacular of these meteors can sometimes be visible from city centres, including in London, however you’re bound to get the best experience away from the light pollution in urban areas. A bright meteor recorded on a meteor-monitoring CCTV camera at the Natural History Museum. “The darker the skies, the better your chances of seeing the really faint meteors as well,” says Ashley. “You could go to the coast or stand on a hill in the middle of the countryside somewhere.” A full Moon can really light up the sky too, so you’ll likely have more success spotting meteors when a shower’s peak coincides with a new Moon. Fortunately, in 2025, several showers are set to occur when the skies are at their darkest. You also need to be patient. “You might not be able to see anything for the first 10 minutes while your eyes adjust to the dark,” he adds. “Once you get used to the low light levels you’ll begin to notice more and more. So don’t give up too quickly.” Meteor showers occur when Earth passes through streams of tiny pieces of debris – meteoroids – left behind by comets and asteroids. The peak of a meteor shower is when we see the highest rate of meteors. This happens as we pass through the densest part of the debris stream. Most comets are composed of dust and ice, which Ashley likens to “a big, dirty snowball”. “As comets orbit the Sun, the ice sublimes [changes from a solid to a gas] and the trapped dust is swept out into a tail behind them.” Nearly all meteors are tiny dust particles, about the size of a grain of sand travelling at tens of kilometres per second through space. “As they come out of the vacuum of space and into Earth’s atmosphere, that little dust grain interacts with all the particles and ions in the atmosphere. It gets heated up by the friction and forms the impressive flash that we see,” he says. “The Earth isn’t close to the comet – it’s just passing through some of the dust it left behind.” At other times of year, you may still see meteors in the sky, but only about one every 10 minutes. These sporadic meteors, as they are known, will come from random directions. A lone meteor. © Jacek Halick (CC BY-SA 4.0) via Wikimedia commons The Quadrantid meteor shower begins on 28 December 2024 and ends on 12 January 2025, and is best viewed from the Northern Hemisphere. It’s thought to occur when Earth passes through the trail left by the asteroid 2003 EH1. The Quadrantid meteor shower has a much shorter peak than others, lasting for just six hours before its intensity rapidly drops off. In 2025, the peak will occur on 3–4 January, just a few days after a new Moon. At its peak, and in ideal viewing conditions, up to 120 meteors and bright fireballs can be seen per hour, with the particles entering Earth’s atmosphere at around 40 kilometres per second. The Quadrantids appear to radiate from an area near the Big Dipper between the constellations of Boötes and Draco. This area was previously recognised as a separate constellation, which was named Quadrans Muralis by French astronomer Jerome Lalande in 1795. In 1922, the decision was made to no longer recognise Quadrans Muralis as an official constellation, but the meteor shower still continues to be named after it. In March 2003, a small near-Earth asteroid was discovered and named as 2003 EH1. This body completes an orbit of the Sun once every 5.5 years and is thought to be the source of the Quadrantid meteor shower. Some think that 2003 EH1 might be an extinct comet. This is a comet that has expelled most of its ice and so appears more like an asteroid, as it no longer has enough material to form a tail or coma – the ice and dust envelope that forms around a comet’s solid centre. People watching a meteor shower. © Allexxandar/ Shutterstock The Lyrid meteor shower takes place between 14–30 April as the Earth’s orbit passes through the dust trail left behind, hundreds of years ago, by comet C/186 G1 (Thatcher). This year, at the peak of the display on 22 April, around 18 meteors per hour are expected to be visible. The most spectacular are ‘Lyrid fireballs’, which occur when meteoroids the size of a large marble pass through the atmosphere. Their slightly larger size produces a meteor train which we see as a flash and line across the night sky. This year, the peak of the Lyrids falls during the Moon’s last quarter, making viewing conditions much better than in 2024, when it coincided with a full Moon. The Lyrid meteor shower gets its name because it appears to radiate from the area of the sky near the constellation Lyra, the Harp – but the meteors can appear anywhere in the sky. Comet Thatcher, responsible for the Lyrid meteor shower, takes 415 years to complete a full orbit of the Sun. We have no photographs of this comet because the last time it visited the inner solar system was in 1861 – well before the widespread use of photography. We won’t see it again until the year 2283. Lyrid meteor shower. © lovemushroom/ Shutterstock The Perseid meteor shower takes place from 17 July to 24 August as Earth passes through the trail left behind by the very large comet Swift-Tuttle. Most meteors are pieces of dust around the size of a grain of sand. Larger pieces can create spectacular fireballs and make bright trails across the sky. The Perseid shower may feature more than 100 meteors per hour at its peak, including bright streaks and fireballs. The best views will be from a dark location on the night of 12 August. This meteor shower is usually one of the best celestial events of the year to watch. Unfortunately, viewing conditions for the Perseids won’t be ideal this year, with the peak falling just three days after a full Moon. Perseids get their name because they appear to radiate from the constellation Perseus, but they can appear anywhere in the sky. Swift-Tuttle, responsible for the Perseid meteor shower, takes 133 years to complete a full orbit of the Sun. At 26 kilometres wide it is the largest solar system object to regularly pass so close to Earth. It’s likely significantly bigger than the asteroid that ended the age of dinosaurs, but don’t worry, calculations have shown that Swift-Tuttle isn’t a threat to the planet. Swift-Tuttle’s elongated orbit means that debris enters Earth’s atmosphere at great speed. The Perseid meteor shower in 2015. © John Fowler via Flickr (CC BY 2.0) The Orionid meteor shower takes place from 2 October to 7 November as Earth passes through the trail of Halley’s Comet, one of the most famous comets of all time. In 2025, the shower is due to peak on the night of 21–22 October. This year the peak falls on a moonless night, giving you ideal dark sky conditions for spotting meteors. Orionids are some of the fastest and brightest meteors, entering the atmosphere at just under 70 kilometres per second. Orionids get their name because they seem to radiate from the constellation Orion, but they can appear anywhere in the sky. Stargazers can usually expect to see up to 20 meteors per hour. Halley’s Comet is a short-period comet, meaning it takes less than 200 years to go around the Sun. Its orbital period is 75–76 years and it last passed close to Earth in 1986. It will be back again in 2061. In 1986, space agencies sent the missions Vega, Giotto, Sakigake and Suisei to Halley – known as the ‘Halley Armada’ – so it’s one of the best-studied comets. Halley’s Comet has been observed for centuries – in 1066 it was considered an omen of doom. It even appears on the Bayeux Tapestry, which depicts events leading up to the Norman conquest of England in the eleventh century. Orionid meteor shower and the Milky Way. © Brian Spencer/ Shutterstock The Leonid meteor shower takes place annually between 6–30 November as Earth crosses the trail of comet 55P/Tempel-Tuttle. Entering the atmosphere at 70 kilometres per second, the Leonids are some of the fastest-moving and brightest meteors. The shower promises up to 15 meteors per hour at its peak on the evening of 17 November, which is just a few days before a new Moon. Leonids get their name because they seem to radiate from the constellation Leo. Comet Tempel-Tuttle is a short-period comet, taking 33 years to go around the Sun. Its last visit was in 1998 with a return expected in 2031. The comet is quite small, only about three kilometres across. The comet is named for the two astronomers, Ernst Tempel and Horace Tuttle, who each independently discovered it in 1865 and 1866, respectively. Horace Tuttle also co-discovered Comet Swift-Tuttle, which causes the Perseid meteor shower. One of the most spectacular meteor showers of the year, the Geminids take place from 4–20 December as Earth passes through the trail of dust left by the ‘rock comet’ 3200 Phaethon. At the shower’s peak on the morning of 14 December, stargazers willing to brave the cold could be rewarded with a display of up to 150 multicoloured meteors per hour. It’s often one of the best showers of the year for viewers in the northern hemisphere, as it’s one of the most active. This year it falls just a few days before a new Moon. Geminids get their name because meteors appear to radiate from the constellation Gemini. Discovered by satellite in 1983, Phaethon has an orbital period of 524 days and is one of only a few asteroids associated with a meteor shower. According to Ashley, there’s been quite a lot of debate about what Phaethon really is. “Like other comets, Phaethon has an elliptical orbit but is unusual as it doesn’t go to the outer solar system. It has been officially classified as a B-type asteroid, but it has also been suggested that it could be a ‘rock comet’ or a ‘dead comet’.” Scientists have been studying Phaethon’s infrared emissions to learn more about this mysterious space rock. In 2023, this research revealed that Phaethon is likely linked to the CY group of carbonaceous chondrites. Carbonaceous chondrites are some of the oldest rocks in the solar system. They are often rich in water, sulphur and organic material, but those in the CY group show signs of drying and decomposition caused by heating. Phaethon travels even closer to the Sun than Mercury does. Scientists at the Natural History Museum have helped estimate that, at perihelion – the asteroid’s closest point to the Sun – its surface reaches 730 °C and some of its components turn to gas. The pressure this gas creates causes the rock to break down, leaving a comet-like trail of dust behind the asteroid as it travels through space. Phaethon may once have been similar to the asteroid Ryugu, from which the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Hayabusa2 mission returned samples in December 2020, and Bennu, an asteroid visited by NASA’s OSIRIS-REx mission, which returned to Earth with samples in September 2023. Our scientists have been leading some of the first analyses of the Bennu samples. Phaethon is considered a potentially hazardous asteroid, meaning it could impact the Earth at some point hundreds of years in the future. For this reason, it’s very well studied and there are plans to send space missions there in the future, such as DESTINY+, which aims to launch in 2028.

The traditional \"Celtic from the East\" theory, says the proto-Celtic language arose in the late Bronze Age Urnfield culture of central Europe, named after grave sites in southern Germany,[12][13] which flourished from around 1200 BC.[14] This theory links the Celts with the Iron Age Hallstatt culture which followed it (c. 1200–500 BC), named for the rich grave finds in Hallstatt, Austria,[14][15] and with the following La Tène culture (c. 450 BC onward), named after the La Tène site in Switzerland. It proposes that Celtic culture spread westward and southward from these areas by diffusion or migration.[16] A newer theory, \"Celtic from the West\", suggests proto-Celtic arose earlier, was a lingua franca in the Atlantic Bronze Age coastal zone, and spread eastward.[17] Another newer theory, \"Celtic from the Centre\", suggests proto-Celtic arose between these two zones, in Bronze Age Gaul, then spread in various directions.[11] After the Celtic settlement of Southeast Europe in the 3rd century BC, Celtic culture reached as far east as central Anatolia, Turkey. The earliest undisputed examples of Celtic language are the Lepontic inscriptions from the 6th century BC.[18] Continental Celtic languages are attested almost exclusively through inscriptions and place-names. Insular Celtic languages are attested from the 4th century AD in Ogham inscriptions, though they were being spoken much earlier. Celtic literary tradition begins with Old Irish texts around the 8th century AD. Elements of Celtic mythology are recorded in early Irish and early Welsh literature. Most written evidence of the early Celts comes from Greco-Roman writers, who often grouped the Celts as barbarian tribes. They followed an ancient Celtic religion overseen by druids. The Celts were often in conflict with the Romans, such as in the Roman–Gallic wars, the Celtiberian Wars, the conquest of Gaul and conquest of Britain. By the 1st century AD, most Celtic territories had become part of the Roman Empire. By c. 500, due to Romanisation and the migration of Germanic tribes, Celtic culture had mostly become restricted to Ireland, western and northern Britain, and Brittany. Between the 5th and 8th centuries, the Celtic-speaking communities in these Atlantic regions emerged as a reasonably cohesive cultural entity. They had a common linguistic, religious and artistic heritage that distinguished them from surrounding cultures.[19] Insular Celtic culture diversified into that of the Gaels (Irish, Scots and Manx) and the Celtic Britons (Welsh, Cornish, and Bretons) of the medieval and modern periods.[2][20][21] A modern Celtic identity[22] was constructed as part of the Romanticist Celtic Revival in Britain, Ireland, and other European territories such as Galicia.[23] Today, Irish, Scottish Gaelic, Welsh, and Breton are still spoken in parts of their former territories, while Cornish and Manx are undergoing a revival. The first recorded use of the name 'Celts' – as Κελτοί (Keltoi) in Ancient Greek – was by Greek geographer Hecataeus of Miletus in 517 BC,[24] when writing about a people living near Massilia (modern Marseille), southern Gaul.[25] In the fifth century BC, Herodotus referred to Keltoi living around the source of the Danube and in the far west of Europe.[26] The etymology of Keltoi is unclear. Possible roots include Indo-European *kʲel 'to hide' (seen also in Old Irish ceilid, and Modern Welsh celu), *kʲel 'to heat' or *kel 'to impel'.[27] It may come from the Celtic language. Linguist Kim McCone supports this view and notes that Celt- is found in the names of several ancient Gauls such as Celtillus, father of Vercingetorix. He suggests it meant the people or descendants of \"the hidden one\", noting the Gauls claimed descent from an underworld god (according to Commentarii de Bello Gallico), and linking it with the Germanic Hel.[28] Others view it as a name coined by Greeks; among them linguist Patrizia de Bernardo Stempel, who suggests it meant \"the tall ones\".[29] In the first century BC, Roman leader Julius Caesar reported that the Gauls called themselves 'Celts', Latin: Celtae, in their own tongue.[30] Thus whether it was given to them by others or not, it was used by the Celts themselves. Greek geographer Strabo, writing about Gaul towards the end of the first century BC, refers to the \"race which is now called both Gallic and Galatic\", though he also uses Celtica as another name for Gaul. He reports Celtic peoples in Iberia too, calling them Celtiberi and Celtici.[31] Pliny the Elder noted the use of Celtici in Lusitania as a tribal surname,[32] which epigraphic findings have confirmed.[33][34] A Latin name for the Gauls, Galli (pl.), may come from a Celtic ethnic name, perhaps borrowed into Latin during the Celtic expansion into Italy from the early fifth century BC. Its root may be Proto-Celtic *galno, meaning \"power, strength\" (whence Old Irish gal \"boldness, ferocity\", Welsh gallu \"to be able, power\"). The Greek name Γαλάται (Galatai, Latinized Galatae) most likely has the same origin, referring to the Gauls who invaded southeast Europe and settled in Galatia.[35] The suffix -atai might be a Greek inflection.[36] Linguist Kim McCone suggests it comes from Proto-Celtic *galatis (\"ferocious, furious\"), and was not originally an ethnic name but a name for young warrior bands. He says \"If the Gauls' initial impact on the Mediterranean world was primarily a military one typically involving fierce young *galatīs, it would have been natural for the Greeks to apply this name for the type of Keltoi that they usually encountered\".[28] Because Classical writers did not call the inhabitants of Britain and Ireland Κελτοί (Keltoi) or Celtae,[5][8][9] some scholars prefer not to use the term for the Iron Age inhabitants of those islands.[5][8][9][10] However, they spoke Celtic languages, shared other cultural traits, and Roman historian Tacitus says the Britons resembled the Gauls in customs and religion.[11] For at least 1,000 years the name Celt was not used at all, and nobody called themselves Celts or Celtic, until from about 1700, after the word 'Celtic' was rediscovered in classical texts, it was applied for the first time to the distinctive culture, history, traditions, language of the modern Celtic nations – Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Cornwall, Brittany, and the Isle of Man.[37] 'Celt' is a modern English word, first attested in 1707 in the writing of Edward Lhuyd, whose work, along with that of other late 17th-century scholars, brought academic attention to the languages and history of the early Celtic inhabitants of Great Britain.[38] The English words Gaul, Gauls (pl.) and Gaulish (first recorded in the 16–17th centuries) come from French Gaule and Gaulois, a borrowing from Frankish *Walholant, 'Roman-land' (see Gaul: Name), the root of which is Proto-Germanic *walha-, 'foreigner, Roman, Celt', whence the English word Welsh (Old English wælisċ). Proto-Germanic *walha comes from the name of the Volcae,[39] a Celtic tribe who lived first in southern Germany and central Europe, then migrated to Gaul.[40] This means that English Gaul, despite its superficial similarity, is not actually derived from Latin Gallia (which should have produced *Jaille in French),[citation needed] though it does refer to the same ancient region. Celtic refers to a language family and, more generally, means 'of the Celts' or 'in the style of the Celts'. Several archaeological cultures are considered Celtic, based on unique sets of artefacts. The link between language and artefact is aided by the presence of inscriptions.[41] The modern idea of a Celtic cultural identity or \"Celticity\" focuses on similarities among languages, works of art, and classical texts,[42] and sometimes also among material artefacts, social organisation, homeland and mythology.[43] Earlier theories held that these similarities suggest a common \"racial\" (race is now a contested concept) origin for the various Celtic peoples, but more recent theories hold that they reflect a common cultural and linguistic heritage more than a genetic one. Celtic cultures seem to have been diverse, with the use of a Celtic language being the main thing they had in common.[5] Today, the term 'Celtic' generally refers to the languages and cultures of Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Cornwall, the Isle of Man, and Brittany; also called the Celtic nations. These are the regions where Celtic languages are still spoken to some extent. The four are Irish, Scottish Gaelic, Welsh, and Breton; plus two recent revivals, Cornish (a Brittonic language) and Manx (a Goidelic language). There are also attempts to reconstruct Cumbric, a Brittonic language of northern Britain. Celtic regions of mainland Europe are those whose residents claim a Celtic heritage, but where no Celtic language survives; these include western Iberia, i.e. Portugal and north-central Spain (Galicia, Asturias, Cantabria, Castile and León, Extremadura).[44] Continental Celts are the Celtic-speaking people of mainland Europe and Insular Celts are the Celtic-speaking people of the British and Irish islands, and their descendants. The Celts of Brittany derive their language from migrating Insular Celts from Britain and so are grouped accordingly.[45] The Celtic languages are a branch of the Indo-European languages. By the time Celts are first mentioned in written records around 400 BC, they were already split into several language groups, and spread over much of western mainland Europe, the Iberian Peninsula, Ireland and Britain. The languages developed into Celtiberian, Goidelic and Brittonic branches, among others.[46][47] The mainstream view during most of the twentieth century is that the Celts and the proto-Celtic language arose out of the Urnfield culture of central Europe around 1000 BC, spreading westward and southward over the following few hundred years.[14][48][49][50] The Urnfield culture was preeminent in central Europe during the late Bronze Age, circa 1200 BC to 700 BC. The spread of iron-working led to the Hallstatt culture (c. 800 to 500 BC) developing out of the Urnfield culture in a wide region north of the Alps. The Hallstatt culture developed into the La Tène culture from about 450 BC, which came to be identified with Celtic art.[citation needed] In 1846, Johann Georg Ramsauer unearthed an ancient grave field with distinctive grave goods at Hallstatt, Austria. Because the burials \"dated to roughly the time when Celts are mentioned near the Danube by Herodotus, Ramsauer concluded that the graves were Celtic\".[51] Similar sites and artifacts were found over a wide area, which were named the 'Hallstatt culture'. In 1857, the archaeological site of La Tène was discovered in Switzerland.[51] The huge collection of artifacts had a distinctive style. Artifacts of this 'La Tène style' were found elsewhere in Europe, \"particularly in places where people called Celts were known to have lived and early Celtic languages are attested. As a result, these items quickly became associated with the Celts, so much so that by the 1870s scholars began to regard finds of the La Tène as 'the archaeological expression of the Celts'\".[51] This cultural network was overrun by the Roman Empire, though traces of La Tène style were still seen in Gallo-Roman artifacts. In Britain and Ireland, the La Tène style survived precariously to re-emerge in Insular art.[citation needed] The Urnfield-Hallstatt theory began to be challenged in the latter 20th century, when it was accepted that the oldest known Celtic-language inscriptions were those of Lepontic from the 6th century BC and Celtiberian from the 2nd century BC. These were found in northern Italy and Iberia, neither of which were part of the 'Hallstatt' nor 'La Tène' cultures at the time.[11] The Urnfield-Hallstatt theory was partly based on ancient Greco-Roman writings, such as the Histories of Herodotus, which placed the Celts at the source of the Danube. However, Stephen Oppenheimer shows that Herodotus seemed to believe the Danube rose near the Pyrenees, which would place the Ancient Celts in a region which is more in agreement with later classical writers and historians (i.e. in Gaul and Iberia).[52] The theory was also partly based on the abundance of inscriptions bearing Celtic personal names in the Eastern Hallstatt region (Noricum). However, Patrick Sims-Williams notes that these date to the later Roman era, and says they suggest \"relatively late settlement by a Celtic-speaking elite\".[11] In the late 20th century, the Urnfield-Hallstatt theory began to fall out of favour with some scholars, which was influenced by new archaeological finds. 'Celtic' began to refer primarily to 'speakers of Celtic languages' rather than to a single culture or ethnic group.[11] A new theory suggested that Celtic languages arose earlier, along the Atlantic coast (including Britain, Ireland, Armorica and Iberia), long before evidence of 'Celtic' culture is found in archaeology. Myles Dillon and Nora Kershaw Chadwick argued that \"Celtic settlement of the British Isles\" might date to the Bell Beaker culture of the Copper and Bronze Age (from c. 2750 BC).[53][54] Martín Almagro Gorbea (2001) also proposed that Celtic arose in the 3rd millennium BC, suggesting that the spread of the Bell Beaker culture explained the wide dispersion of the Celts throughout western Europe, as well as the variability of the Celtic peoples.[55] John T. Koch[56] and Barry Cunliffe[57] have developed this 'Celtic from the West' theory. It proposes that the proto-Celtic language arose along the Atlantic coast and was the lingua franca of the Atlantic Bronze Age cultural network, later spreading inland and eastward.[11] More recently, Cunliffe proposes that proto-Celtic had arisen in the Atlantic zone even earlier, by 3000 BC, and spread eastwards with the Bell Beaker culture over the following millennium. His theory is partly based on glottochronology, the spread of ancient Celtic-looking placenames, and thesis that the Tartessian language was Celtic.[11] However, the proposal that Tartessian was Celtic is widely rejected by linguists, many of whom regard it as unclassified.[58][59] Celticist Patrick Sims-Williams (2020) notes that in current scholarship, 'Celt' is primarily a linguistic label. In his 'Celtic from the Centre' theory, he argues that the proto-Celtic language did not originate in central Europe nor the Atlantic, but in-between these two regions. He suggests that it \"emerged as a distinct Indo-European dialect around the second millennium BC, probably somewhere in Gaul [centered in modern France] ... whence it spread in various directions and at various speeds in the first millennium BC\". Sims-Williams says this avoids the problematic idea \"that Celtic was spoken over a vast area for a very long time yet somehow avoided major dialectal splits\", and \"it keeps Celtic fairly close to Italy, which suits the view that Italic and Celtic were in some way linked\".[11] The Proto-Celtic language is usually dated to the Late Bronze Age.[14] The earliest records of a Celtic language are the Lepontic inscriptions of Cisalpine Gaul (Northern Italy), the oldest of which pre-date the La Tène period. Other early inscriptions, appearing from the early La Tène period in the area of Massilia, are in Gaulish, which was written in the Greek alphabet until the Roman conquest. Celtiberian inscriptions, using their own Iberian script, appear later, after about 200 BC. Evidence of Insular Celtic is available only from about 400 AD, in the form of Primitive Irish Ogham inscriptions.[citation needed] Besides epigraphic evidence, an important source of information on early Celtic is toponymy (place names).[60] Arnaiz-Villena et al. (2017) demonstrated that Celtic-related populations of the European Atlantic (Orkney Islands, Scottish, Irish, British, Bretons, Basques, Galicians) shared a common HLA system.[clarification needed][61] Other genetic research does not support the notion of a significant genetic link between these populations, beyond the fact that they are all West Europeans. Early European Farmers did settle Britain (and all of Northern Europe) in the Neolithic; however, recent genetics research has found that, between 2400 and 2000 BC, over 90% of British DNA was overturned by European Steppe Herders in a migration that brought large amounts of Steppe DNA (including the R1b haplogroup) to western Europe.[62] Modern autosomal genetic clustering is testament to this fact, as both modern and Iron Age British and Irish samples cluster genetically very closely with other North Europeans, and less so with Galicians, Basques or those from the south of France.[63][64] The concept that the Hallstatt and La Tène cultures could be seen not just as chronological periods but as \"Culture Groups\", entities composed of people of the same ethnicity and language, had started to grow by the end of the 19th century. At the beginning of the 20th century the belief that these \"Culture Groups\" could be thought of in racial or ethnic terms was held by Gordon Childe, whose theory was influenced by the writings of Gustaf Kossinna.[65] As the 20th century progressed, the ethnic interpretation of La Tène culture became more strongly rooted, and any findings of La Tène culture and flat inhumation cemeteries were linked to the Celts and the Celtic language.[66] In various[clarification needed] academic disciplines the Celts were considered a Central European Iron Age phenomenon, through the cultures of Hallstatt and La Tène. However, archaeological finds from the Halstatt and La Tène culture were rare in Iberia, southwestern France, northern and western Britain, southern Ireland and Galatia[67][68] and did not provide enough evidence for a culture like that of Central Europe. It is equally difficult to maintain that the origin of the Iberian Celts can be linked to the preceding Urnfield culture. This has resulted in a newer theory that introduces a 'proto-Celtic' substratum and a process of Celticisation, having its initial roots in the Bronze Age Bell Beaker culture.[69] The La Tène culture developed and flourished during the late Iron Age (from 450 BC to the Roman conquest in the 1st century BC) in eastern France, Switzerland, Austria, southwest Germany, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary. It developed out of the Hallstatt culture without any definite cultural break, under the impetus of considerable Mediterranean influence from Greek, and later Etruscan civilisations. A shift of settlement centres took place in the 4th century. The western La Tène culture corresponds to historical Celtic Gaul. Whether this means that the whole of La Tène culture can be attributed to a unified Celtic people is difficult to assess; archaeologists have repeatedly concluded that language and material culture do not necessarily run parallel. Frey notes that in the 5th century, \"burial customs in the Celtic world were not uniform; rather, localised groups had their own beliefs, which, in consequence, also gave rise to distinct artistic expressions\".[70] Thus, while the La Tène culture is certainly associated with the Gauls, the presence of La Tène artefacts may be due to cultural contact and does not imply the permanent presence of Celtic speakers.[citation needed] The Greek historian Ephorus of Cyme in Asia Minor, writing in the 4th century BC, believed the Celts came from the islands off the mouth of the Rhine and were \"driven from their homes by the frequency of wars and the violent rising of the sea\". Polybius published a history of Rome about 150 BC in which he describes the Gauls of Italy and their conflict with Rome. Pausanias in the 2nd century AD says that the Gauls \"originally called Celts\", \"live on the remotest region of Europe on the coast of an enormous tidal sea\". Posidonius described the southern Gauls about 100 BC. Though his original work is lost, later writers such as Strabo used it. The latter, writing in the early 1st century AD, deals with Britain and Gaul as well as Hispania, Italy, and Galatia. Caesar wrote extensively about his Gallic Wars in 58–51 BC. Diodorus Siculus wrote about the Celts of Gaul and Britain in his 1st-century history.[citation needed] Diodorus Siculus and Strabo both suggest that the heartland of the people they call Celts was in southern Gaul. The former says that the Gauls were to the north of the Celts, but that the Romans referred to both as Gauls (linguistically the Gauls were certainly Celts). Before the discoveries at Hallstatt and La Tène, it was generally considered that the Celtic heartland was southern Gaul, see Encyclopædia Britannica for 1813.[citation needed] The Romans knew the Celts then living in present-day France as Gauls. The territory of these peoples probably included the Low Countries, the Alps and present-day northern Italy. Julius Caesar in his Gallic Wars described the 1st-century BC descendants of those Gauls.[citation needed] Eastern Gaul became the centre of the western La Tène culture. In later Iron Age Gaul, the social organisation resembled that of the Romans, with large towns. From the 3rd century BC the Gauls adopted coinage. Texts with Greek characters from southern Gaul have survived from the 2nd century BC.[71] Greek traders founded Massalia about 600 BC, with some objects (mostly drinking ceramic vessels) being traded up the Rhône valley. But trade became disrupted soon after 500 BC and re-oriented over the Alps to the Po valley in the Italian peninsula. The Romans arrived in the Rhone valley in the 2nd century BC and encountered a mostly Celtic-speaking Gaul. Rome wanted land communications with its Iberian provinces and fought a major battle with the Saluvii at Entremont in 124–123 BC. Gradually Roman control extended, and the Roman province of Gallia Transalpina developed along the Mediterranean coast.[72][73] The Romans knew the remainder of Gaul as Gallia Comata, 'Long-haired Gaul'.[74] In 58 BC, the Helvetii planned to migrate westward but Julius Caesar forced them back. He then became involved in fighting the various tribes in Gaul, and by 55 BC had overrun most of Gaul. In 52 BC, Vercingetorix led a revolt against Roman occupation but was defeated at the Battle of Alesia and surrendered.[75] Following the Gallic Wars of 58–51 BC, Caesar's Celtica formed the main part of Roman Gaul, becoming the province of Gallia Lugdunensis. This territory of the Celtic tribes was bounded on the south by the Garonne and on the north by the Seine and the Marne.[76] The Romans attached large swathes of this region to neighbouring provinces Belgica and Aquitania, particularly under Augustus.[77] Place- and personal-name analysis and inscriptions suggest that Gaulish was spoken over most of what is now France.[78][79] Until the end of the 19th century, traditional scholarship dealing with the Celts did acknowledge their presence in the Iberian Peninsula[80][81] as a material culture relatable to the Hallstatt and La Tène cultures. However, since according to the definition of the Iron Age in the 19th century Celtic populations were supposedly rare in Iberia and did not provide a cultural scenario that could easily be linked to that of Central Europe, the presence of Celtic culture in that region was generally not fully recognised. Modern scholarship, however, has proven that Celtic presence and influences were most substantial in what is today Spain and Portugal (with perhaps the highest settlement saturation in Western Europe), particularly in the central, western and northern regions.[82][83] In addition to Gauls infiltrating from the north of the Pyrenees, the Roman and Greek sources mention Celtic populations in three parts of the Iberian Peninsula: the eastern part of the Meseta (inhabited by the Celtiberians), the southwest (Celtici, in modern-day Alentejo) and the northwest (Gallaecia and Asturias).[84] A modern scholarly review[85] found several archaeological groups of Celts in Spain: The origins of the Celtiberians might provide a key to understanding the Celticisation process in the rest of the Peninsula. The process of Celticisation of the southwestern area of the peninsula by the Keltoi and of the northwestern area is, however, not a simple Celtiberian question. Recent investigations about the Callaici[90] and Bracari[91] in northwestern Portugal are providing new approaches to understanding Celtic culture (language, art and religion) in western Iberia.[92] John T. Koch of Aberystwyth University suggested that Tartessian inscriptions of the 8th century BC might be classified as Celtic. This would mean that Tartessian is the earliest attested trace of Celtic by a margin of more than a century.[93] In Germany by the late Bronze Age, the Urnfield culture (c. 1300 BC – c. 750 BC) had replaced the Bell Beaker, Unetice and Tumulus cultures in central Europe,[96] whilst the Nordic Bronze Age had developed in Scandinavia and northern Germany. The Hallstatt culture, which had developed from the Urnfield culture, was the predominant Western and Central European culture from the 12th to 8th centuries BC and during the early Iron Age (8th to 6th centuries BC). It was followed by the La Tène culture (5th to 1st centuries BC). The people who had adopted these cultural characteristics in central and southern Germany are regarded as Celts. Celtic cultural centres developed in central Europe during the late Bronze Age (c. 1200 BC until 700 BC). Some, like the Heuneburg, the oldest city north of the Alps,[97] grew to become important cultural centres of the Iron Age in Central Europe, that maintained trade routes to the Mediterranean. In the 5th century BC the Greek historian Herodotus mentioned a Celtic city at the Danube – Pyrene, that historians attribute to the Heuneburg. Beginning around 700 BC (or later), Germanic peoples (Germanic tribes) from southern Scandinavia and northern Germany expanded south and gradually replaced the Celtic peoples in Central Europe.[98][99][100][101][102][103] The Canegrate culture represented the first migratory wave of the proto-Celtic[104][105] population from the northwest part of the Alps that, through the Alpine passes, had already penetrated and settled in the western Po valley between Lake Maggiore and Lake Como (Scamozzina culture). It has also been proposed that a more ancient proto-Celtic presence can be traced back to the beginning of the Middle Bronze Age, when North Westwern Italy appears closely linked regarding the production of bronze artefacts, including ornaments, to the western groups of the Tumulus culture.[106] La Tène cultural material appeared over a large area of mainland Italy,[107] the southernmost example being the Celtic helmet from Canosa di Puglia.[108] Italy is home to Lepontic, the oldest attested Celtic language (from the 6th century BC).[109] Anciently spoken in Switzerland and in Northern-Central Italy, from the Alps to Umbria.[110][111][112][113] According to the Recueil des Inscriptions Gauloises, more than 760 Gaulish inscriptions have been found throughout present-day France – with the notable exception of Aquitaine – and in Italy,[114][115] which testifies the importance of Celtic heritage in the peninsula.[citation needed] In 391 BC, Celts \"who had their homes beyond the Alps streamed through the passes in great strength and seized the territory that lay between the Apennine Mountains and the Alps\" according to Diodorus Siculus. The Po Valley and the rest of northern Italy (known to the Romans as Cisalpine Gaul) was inhabited by Celtic-speakers who founded cities such as Milan.[116] Later the Roman army was routed at the battle of Allia and Rome was sacked in 390 BC by the Senones.[117] At the battle of Telamon in 225 BC, a large Celtic army was trapped between two Roman forces and crushed.[118] The defeat of the combined Samnite, Celtic and Etruscan alliance by the Romans in the Third Samnite War sounded the beginning of the end of the Celtic domination in mainland Europe, but it was not until 192 BC that the Roman armies conquered the last remaining independent Celtic kingdoms in Italy.[citation needed] The Celts also expanded down the Danube river and its tributaries. One of the most influential tribes, the Scordisci, established their capital at Singidunum (present-day Belgrade, Serbia) in the 3rd century BC. The concentration of hill-forts and cemeteries shows a dense population in the Tisza valley of modern-day Vojvodina, Serbia, Hungary and into Ukraine. Expansion into Romania was however blocked by the Dacians.[citation needed] The Serdi were a Celtic tribe[119] inhabiting Thrace. They were located around and founded Serdika (Bulgarian: Сердика, Latin: Ulpia Serdica, Greek: Σαρδῶν πόλις), now Sofia in Bulgaria,[120] which reflects their ethnonym. They would have established themselves in this area during the Celtic migrations at the end of the 4th century BC, though there is no evidence for their existence before the 1st century BC. Serdi are among traditional tribal names reported into the Roman era.[121] They were gradually Thracianized over the centuries but retained their Celtic character in material culture up to a late date.[when?][citation needed] According to other sources they may have been simply of Thracian origin,[122] according to others they may have become of mixed Thraco-Celtic origin. Further south, Celts settled in Thrace (Bulgaria), which they ruled for over a century, and Anatolia, where they settled as the Galatians (see also: Gallic Invasion of Greece). Despite their geographical isolation from the rest of the Celtic world, the Galatians maintained their Celtic language for at least 700 years. St Jerome, who visited Ancyra (modern-day Ankara) in 373 AD, likened their language to that of the Treveri of northern Gaul.[citation needed] For Venceslas Kruta, Galatia in central Turkey was an area of dense Celtic settlement.[citation needed] The Boii tribe gave their name to Bohemia, Bologna and possibly Bavaria, and Celtic artefacts and cemeteries have been discovered further east in what is now Poland and Slovakia. A Celtic coin (Biatec) from Bratislava's mint was displayed on the old Slovak 5-crown coin.[citation needed] As there is no archaeological evidence for large-scale invasions in some of the other areas, one current school of thought holds that Celtic language and culture spread to those areas by contact rather than invasion.[123] However, the Celtic invasions of Italy and the expedition in Greece and western Anatolia, are well documented in Greek and Latin history.[124][125] There are records of Celtic mercenaries in Egypt serving the Ptolemies. Thousands were employed in 283–246 BC and they were also in service around 186 BC. They attempted to overthrow Ptolemy II.[126] All living Celtic languages today belong to the Insular Celtic languages, derived from the Celtic languages spoken in Iron Age Britain and Ireland.[127] They separated into a Goidelic and a Brittonic branch early on. By the time of the Roman conquest of Britain in the 1st century AD, the Insular Celts were made up of the Celtic Britons, the Gaels (or Scoti), and the Picts (or Caledonians).[citation needed] The renown of insular Celts has caused a popular belief that Celtic clans only lived in the British Isles.[128] Linguists have debated whether a Celtic language came to the British Isles and then split, or whether the two branches arrived separately. The older view was that Celtic influence in the Isles was the result of successive migrations or invasions from the European mainland by diverse Celtic-speaking peoples over several centuries, accounting for the P-Celtic vs. Q-Celtic isogloss. This view has been challenged by the hypothesis that the islands' Celtic languages form an Insular Celtic dialect group.[129] In the 19th and 20th centuries, scholars often dated the \"arrival\" of Celtic culture in Britain (via an invasion model) to the 6th century BC, corresponding to archaeological evidence of Hallstatt influence and the appearance of chariot burials in what is now England. Cunliffe and Koch propose in their newer 'Celtic from the West' theory that Celtic languages reached the Isles earlier, with the Bell Beaker culture c.2500 BC, or even before this.[130][131] More recently, a major archaeogenetics study uncovered a migration into southern Britain in the Bronze Age from 1300 to 800 BC.[132] The newcomers were genetically most similar to ancient individuals from Gaul.[132] From 1000 BC, their genetic marker swiftly spread through southern Britain,[133] but not northern Britain.[132] The authors see this as a \"plausible vector for the spread of early Celtic languages into Britain\".[132] There was much less immigration during the Iron Age, so it is likely that Celtic reached Britain before then.[132] Cunliffe suggests that a branch of Celtic was already spoken in Britain, and the Bronze Age migration introduced the Brittonic branch.[134] Like many Celtic peoples on the mainland, the Insular Celts followed an Ancient Celtic religion overseen by druids. Some of the southern British tribes had strong links with Gaul and Belgica, and minted their own coins. During the Roman occupation of Britain, a Romano-British culture emerged in the southeast. The Britons and Picts in the north, and the Gaels of Ireland, remained outside the empire. During the end of Roman rule in Britain in the 400s AD, there was significant Anglo-Saxon settlement of eastern and southern Britain, and some Gaelic settlement of its western coast. During this time, some Britons migrated to the Armorican peninsula, where their culture became dominant. Meanwhile, much of northern Britain (Scotland) became Gaelic. By the 10th century AD, the Insular Celtic peoples had diversified into the Brittonic-speaking Welsh (in Wales), Cornish (in Cornwall), Bretons (in Brittany) and Cumbrians (in the Old North); and the Gaelic-speaking Irish (in Ireland), Scots (in Scotland) and Manx (on the Isle of Man).[citation needed] Classical writers did not call the inhabitants of Britain and Ireland Celtae or Κελτοί (Keltoi),[5][8][9] leading some scholars to question the use of the term 'Celt' for the Iron Age inhabitants of those islands.[5][8][9][10] The first historical account of the islands was by the Greek geographer Pytheas, who sailed around what he called the \"Pretannikai nesoi\" (the \"Pretannic isles\") around 310–306 BC.[135] In general, classical writers referred to the Britons as Pretannoi (in Greek) or Britanni (in Latin).[136] Strabo, writing in Roman times, distinguished between the Celts and Britons.[137] However, Roman historian Tacitus says the Britons resembled the Celts of Gaul in customs and religion.[11] Under Caesar the Romans conquered Celtic Gaul, and from Claudius onward the Roman empire absorbed parts of Britain. Roman local government of these regions closely mirrored pre-Roman tribal boundaries, and archaeological finds suggest native involvement in local government.[citation needed] The native peoples under Roman rule became Romanised and keen to adopt Roman ways. Celtic art had already incorporated classical influences, and surviving Gallo-Roman pieces interpret classical subjects or keep faith with old traditions despite a Roman overlay.[citation needed] The Roman occupation of Gaul, and to a lesser extent of Britain, led to Roman-Celtic syncretism. In the case of the continental Celts, this eventually resulted in a language shift to Vulgar Latin, while the Insular Celts retained their language.[citation needed] There was also considerable cultural influence exerted by Gaul on Rome, particularly in military matters and horsemanship, as the Gauls often served in the Roman cavalry. The Romans adopted the Celtic cavalry sword, the spatha, and Epona, the Celtic horse goddess.[138][139] To the extent that sources are available, they depict a pre-Christian Iron Age Celtic social structure based formally on class and kingship, although this may only have been a particular late phase of organisation in Celtic societies. Patron-client relationships similar to those of Roman society are also described by Caesar and others in the Gaul of the 1st century BC.[citation needed] In the main, the evidence is of tribes being led by kings, although some argue that there is also evidence of oligarchical republican forms of government eventually emerging in areas which had close contact with Rome. Most descriptions of Celtic societies portray them as being divided into three groups: a warrior aristocracy; an intellectual class including professions such as druid, poet, and jurist; and everyone else. In historical times, the offices of high and low kings in Ireland and Scotland were filled by election under the system of tanistry, which eventually came into conflict with the feudal principle of primogeniture in which succession goes to the first-born son.[citation needed] Little is known of family structure among the Celts. Patterns of settlement varied from decentralised to urban. The popular stereotype of non-urbanised societies settled in hillforts and duns,[140] drawn from Britain and Ireland (there are about 3,000 hill forts known in Britain)[141] contrasts with the urban settlements present in the core Hallstatt and La Tène areas, with the many significant oppida of Gaul late in the first millennium BC, and with the towns of Gallia Cisalpina.[citation needed] Slavery, as practised by the Celts, was very likely similar to the better documented practice in ancient Greece and Rome.[142] Slaves were acquired from war, raids, and penal and debt servitude.[142] Slavery was hereditary,[143] though manumission was possible. The Old Irish and Welsh words for 'slave', cacht and caeth respectively, are cognate with Latin captus 'captive' suggesting that the slave trade was an early means of contact between Latin and Celtic societies.[142] In the Middle Ages, slavery was especially prevalent in the Celtic countries.[144] Manumissions were discouraged by law and the word for 'female slave', cumal, was used as a general unit of value in Ireland.[145] There are only very limited records from pre-Christian times written in Celtic languages. These are mostly inscriptions in the Roman and sometimes Greek alphabets. The ogham script, an Early Medieval alphabet, was mostly used in early Christian times in Ireland and Scotland (but also in Wales and England), and was only used for ceremonial purposes such as inscriptions on gravestones. The available evidence is of a strong oral tradition, such as that preserved by bards in Ireland, and eventually recorded by monasteries. Celtic art also produced a great deal of intricate and beautiful metalwork, examples of which have been preserved by their distinctive burial rites.[146] In some regards the Atlantic Celts were conservative: for example, they still used chariots in combat long after they had been reduced to ceremonial roles by the Greeks and Romans. However, despite being outdated, Celtic chariot tactics were able to repel the invasions of Britain attempted by Julius Caesar.[147] According to Diodorus Siculus: The Gauls are tall of body with rippling muscles and white of skin and their hair is blond, and not only naturally so for they also make it their practice by artificial means to increase the distinguishing colour which nature has given it. For they are always washing their hair in limewater and they pull it back from the forehead to the nape of the neck, with the result that their appearance is like that of Satyrs and Pans since the treatment of their hair makes it so heavy and coarse that it differs in no respect from the mane of horses. Some of them shave the beard but others let it grow a little; and the nobles shave their cheeks but they let the moustache grow until it covers the mouth. During the later Iron Age the Gauls generally wore long-sleeved shirts or tunics and long trousers (called braccae by the Romans).[148] Clothes were made of wool or linen, with some silk being used by the rich. Cloaks were worn in the winter. Brooches[149] and armlets were used, but the most famous item of jewellery was the torc, a neck collar of metal, sometimes gold. The horned Waterloo Helmet in the British Museum, which long set the standard for modern images of Celtic warriors, is in fact a unique survival, and may have been a piece for ceremonial rather than military wear.[150] Archaeological evidence suggests that the pre-Roman Celtic societies were linked to the network of overland trade routes that spanned Eurasia. Archaeologists have discovered large prehistoric trackways crossing bogs in Ireland and Germany. Due to their substantial nature, these are believed to have been created for wheeled transport as part of an extensive roadway system that facilitated trade.[151] The territory held by the Celts contained tin, lead, iron, silver and gold.[152] Celtic smiths and metalworkers created weapons and jewellery for international trade, particularly with the Romans.[153] The myth that the Celtic monetary system consisted of wholly barter is a common one, but is in part false. The monetary system was complex and is still not understood (much like the late Roman coinages), and due to the absence of large numbers of coin items, it is assumed that \"proto-money\" was used. This included bronze items made from the early La Tène period and onwards, which were often in the shape of axeheads, rings, or bells. Due to the large number of these present in some burials, it is thought they had a relatively high monetary value, and could be used for \"day to day\" purchases. Low-value coinages of potin, a bronze alloy with high tin content, were minted in most Celtic areas of the continent and in South-East Britain prior to the Roman conquest of these lands. Higher-value coinages, suitable for use in trade, were minted in gold, silver, and high-quality bronze. Gold coinage was much more common than silver coinage, despite being worth substantially more, as while there were around 100 mines in Southern Britain and Central France, silver was more rarely mined. This was due partly to the relative sparsity of mines and the amount of effort needed for extraction compared to the profit gained. As the Roman civilisation grew in importance and expanded its trade with the Celtic world, silver and bronze coinage became more common. This coincided with a major increase in gold production in Celtic areas to meet the Roman demand, due to the high value Romans put on the metal. The large number of gold mines in France is thought to be a major reason why Caesar invaded.[154] Very few reliable sources exist regarding Celtic views on gender roles, though some archaeological evidence suggests their views may have differed from those of the Greco-Roman world, which tended to be less egalitarian.[155][156] Some Iron Age burials in northeastern Gaul suggest women may have had roles in warfare during the earlier La Tène period, but the evidence is far from conclusive.[157] Celtic individuals buried with both female jewellery and weaponry have been found, such as the Vix Grave in northeastern Gaul, and there are questions about the gender of some individuals buried with weaponry. However, it has been suggested that the weapons indicate high social rank rather than masculinity.[158] Most written accounts of the Ancient Celts are from the Romans and Greeks, though it is not clear how accurate these are. Roman historians Ammianus Marcellinus and Tacitus mentioned Celtic women inciting, participating in, and leading battles.[159] Plutarch reports that Celtic women acted as ambassadors to avoid a war among Celtic chiefdoms in the Po valley during the 4th century BC.[160] Posidonius' anthropological comments on the Celts had common themes, primarily primitivism, extreme ferocity, cruel sacrificial practices, and the strength and courage of their women.[161] Cassius Dio suggests there was great sexual freedom among women in Celtic Britain:[162] ... a very witty remark is reported to have been made by the wife of Argentocoxus, a Caledonian, to Julia Augusta. When the empress was jesting with her, after the treaty, about the free intercourse of her sex with men in Britain, she replied: \"We fulfill the demands of nature in a much better way than do you Roman women; for we consort openly with the best men, whereas you let yourselves be debauched in secret by the vilest\". Such was the retort of the British woman. Barry Cunliffe writes that such references are \"likely to be ill-observed\" and meant to portray the Celts as outlandish \"barbarians\".[163] Historian Lisa Bitel argues the descriptions of Celtic women warriors are not credible. She says some Roman and Greek writers wanted to show that the barbarian Celts lived in \"an upside-down world ... and a standard ingredient in such a world was the manly warrior woman\".[164] The Greek philosopher Aristotle wrote in his Politics that the Celts of southeastern Europe approved of male homosexuality. Greek historian Diodorus Siculus wrote in his Bibliotheca historica that although Gaulish women were beautiful, the men had \"little to do with them\" and it was a custom for men to sleep on animal skins with two younger males. He further claimed that \"the young men will offer themselves to strangers and are insulted if the offer is refused\". His claim was later repeated by Greco-Roman writers Athenaeus and Ammianus.[165] H. David Rankin, in Celts and the Classical World, suggests some of these claims refer to bonding rituals in warrior groups, which required abstinence from women at certain times,[166] and says it probably reflects \"the warlike character of early contacts between the Celts and the Greeks\".[167] Under Brehon Law, which was written down in early Medieval Ireland after conversion to Christianity, a woman had the right to divorce her husband and gain his property if he was unable to perform his marital duties due to impotence, obesity, homosexual inclination or preference for other women.[168][169][failed verification] Celtic art is generally used by art historians to refer to art of the La Tène period across Europe, while the Early Medieval art of Britain and Ireland, that is what \"Celtic art\" evokes for much of the general public, is called Insular art in art history. Both styles absorbed considerable influences from non-Celtic sources, but retained a preference for geometrical decoration over figurative subjects, which are often extremely stylised when they do appear; narrative scenes only appear under outside influence. Energetic circular forms, triskeles and spirals are characteristic. Much of the surviving material is in precious metal, which no doubt gives a very unrepresentative picture, but apart from Pictish stones and the Insular high crosses, large monumental sculpture, even with decorative carving, is very rare; possibly it was originally common in wood. Celts were also able to create developed musical instruments such as the carnyces, these famous war trumpets used before the battle to frighten the enemy, as the best preserved found in Tintignac (Gaul) in 2004 and which were decorated with a boar head or a snake head.[170] The interlace patterns that are often regarded as typical of \"Celtic art\" were characteristic of the whole of the British Isles, a style referred to as Insular art, or Hiberno-Saxon art. This artistic style incorporated elements of La Tène, Late Roman, and, most importantly, animal Style II of Germanic Migration Period art. The style was taken up with great skill and enthusiasm by Celtic artists in metalwork and illuminated manuscripts. Equally, the forms used for the finest Insular art were all adopted from the Roman world: Gospel books like the Book of Kells and Book of Lindisfarne, chalices like the Ardagh Chalice and Derrynaflan Chalice, and penannular brooches like the Tara Brooch and Roscrea Brooch. These works are from the period of peak achievement of Insular art, which lasted from the 7th to the 9th centuries, before the Viking attacks sharply set back cultural life.[citation needed] In contrast the less well known but often spectacular art of the richest earlier Continental Celts, before they were conquered by the Romans, often adopted elements of Roman, Greek and other \"foreign\" styles (and possibly used imported craftsmen) to decorate objects that were distinctively Celtic. After the Roman conquests, some Celtic elements remained in popular art, especially Ancient Roman pottery, of which Gaul was actually the largest producer, mostly in Italian styles, but also producing work in local taste, including figurines of deities and wares painted with animals and other subjects in highly formalised styles. Roman Britain also took more interest in enamel than most of the Empire, and its development of champlevé technique was probably important to the later Medieval art of the whole of Europe, of which the energy and freedom of Insular decoration was an important element. Rising nationalism brought Celtic revivals from the 19th century.[citation needed] The Coligny calendar, which was found in 1897 in Coligny, Ain, was engraved on a bronze tablet, preserved in 73 fragments, that originally was 1.48 metres (4 feet 10 inches) wide and 0.9 metres (2 feet 11 inches) high (Lambert p. 111). Based on the style of lettering and the accompanying objects, it probably dates to the end of the 2nd century.[171] It is written in Latin inscriptional capitals, and is in Gaulish. The restored tablet contains 16 vertical columns, with 62 months distributed over 5 years.[citation needed] French archaeologist J. Monard speculated that it was recorded by druids wishing to preserve their tradition of timekeeping in a time when the Julian calendar was imposed throughout the Roman Empire. However, the general form of the calendar suggests the public peg calendars (or parapegmata) found throughout the Greek and Roman world.[172] Tribal warfare appears to have been a regular feature of Celtic societies. While epic literature depicts this as more of a sport focused on raids and hunting rather than organised territorial conquest, the historical record is more of tribes using warfare to exert political control and harass rivals, for economic advantage, and in some instances to conquer territory.[citation needed] The Celts were described by classical writers such as Strabo, Livy, Pausanias, and Florus as fighting like \"wild beasts\", and as hordes. Dionysius said that their:[173] [174] manner of fighting, being in large measure that of wild beasts and frenzied, was an erratic procedure, quite lacking in military science. Thus, at one moment they would raise their swords aloft and smite after the manner of wild boars, throwing the whole weight of their bodies into the blow like hewers of wood or men digging with mattocks, and again they would deliver crosswise blows aimed at no target, as if they intended to cut to pieces the entire bodies of their adversaries, protective armour and all. Polybius (2.33) indicates that the principal Celtic weapon was a long bladed sword which was used for hacking edgewise rather than stabbing. Celtic warriors are described by Polybius and Plutarch as frequently having to cease fighting in order to straighten their sword blades. This claim has been questioned by some archaeologists, who note that Noric steel, steel produced in Celtic Noricum, was famous in the Roman Empire period and was used to equip the Roman military.[175][176] However, Radomir Pleiner, in The Celtic Sword (1993) argues that \"the metallographic evidence shows that Polybius was right up to a point\", as around one third of surviving swords from the period might well have behaved as he describes.[177] In addition to these long bladed slashing swords, spears and specialized javelins were also used.[178] Polybius also asserts that certain of the Celts fought naked: \"The appearance of these naked warriors was a terrifying spectacle, for they were all men of splendid physique and in the prime of life.\"[179] According to Livy, this was also true of the Celts of Asia Minor.[180] Celts had a reputation as head hunters.[181] Paul Jacobsthal says: \"Amongst the Celts the human head was venerated above all else, since the head was to the Celt the soul, centre of the emotions as well as of life itself, a symbol of divinity and of the powers of the other-world.\"[182] Writing in the first century BC, Greek historians Posidonius and Diodorus Siculus said Celtic warriors cut off the heads of enemies slain in battle, hung them from the necks of their horses, then nailed them up outside their homes.[181] Strabo wrote in the same century that Celts embalmed the heads of their most esteemed enemies in cedar oil and put them on display.[181] Roman historian Livy wrote that the Boii beheaded a defeated Roman general after the Battle of Silva Litana, covered his skull in gold, and used it as a ritual cup.[181] Archaeologists have found evidence that heads were embalmed and displayed by the southern Gauls.[183][184] In another example, at the southern Gaulish site of Entremont, there stood a pillar carved with skulls, within which were niches where human skulls were kept, nailed into position.[185] Roquepertuse nearby has similar carved heads and skull niches. Many lone carved heads have been found in Celtic regions, some with two or three faces.[186] Examples include the Mšecké Žehrovice Head and the Corleck Head. Severed heads are a common motif in Insular Celtic myths, and there are many tales in which 'living heads' preside over feasts or speak prophecies.[181][186] The beheading game is a motif in Irish myth and Arthurian legend, most famously in the tale Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, where the Green Knight picks up his own severed head after Gawain has struck it off. There are also many legends in Celtic regions of saints who carry their own severed heads. In Irish myth, the severed heads of warriors are called the mast or nuts of the goddess Macha.[187] Like other European Iron Age societies, the Celts practised a polytheistic religion and believed in an afterlife.[188][189][unreliable source] Celtic religion varied by region and over time, but had \"broad structural similarities\",[188] and there was \"a basic religious homogeneity\" among the Celtic peoples.[190] Because the ancient Celts did not have writing, evidence about their religion is gleaned from archaeology, Greco-Roman accounts, and literature from the early Christian period.[191] The names of over two hundred Celtic deities have survived (see list of Celtic deities), although it is likely that many of these were alternative names, regional names or titles for the same deity.[188] Some deities were venerated only in one region, but others were more widely known.[188] According to Miranda Aldhouse-Green, the Celts were also animists, believing that every part of the natural world had a spirit.[191] The Celts seem to have had a father god, who was often a god of the tribe and of the dead (Toutatis probably being one name for him); and a mother goddess who was associated with the land, earth and fertility[192] (Dea Matrona probably being one name for her). The mother goddess could also take the form of a war goddess as protectress of her tribe and its land.[192] There also seems to have been a male celestial god—identified with Taranis—associated with thunder, the wheel, and the bull.[192] There were gods of skill and craft, such as the pan-regional god Lugus, and the smith god Gobannos.[192] Celtic healing deities were often associated with sacred springs,[192] such as Sirona and Borvo. Other pan-regional deities include the horned god Cernunnos, the horse and fertility goddess Epona, the divine son Maponos, as well as Belenos, Ogmios, and Sucellos.[188][191] Caesar says the Gauls believed they all descended from a god of the dead and underworld.[188] Triplicity is a common theme in Celtic cosmology, and a number of deities were seen as threefold,[193] for example the Three Mothers.[194] Celtic religious ceremonies were overseen by priests known as druids, who also served as judges, teachers, and lore-keepers. Other classes of druids performed sacrifices for the perceived benefit of the community.[195] There is evidence that ancient Celtic peoples sacrificed animals, almost always livestock or working animals. It appears some were offered wholly to the gods (by burying or burning), while some were shared between gods and humans (part eaten and part offered).[196] There is also some evidence that ancient Celts sacrificed humans, and some Greco-Roman sources claim the Gauls sacrificed criminals by burning them in a wicker man.[197] The Romans said the Celts held ceremonies in sacred groves and other natural shrines, called nemetons.[188] Some Celtic peoples built temples or ritual enclosures of varying shapes (such as the Romano-Celtic temple and viereckschanze), though they also maintained shrines at natural sites.[188] Celtic peoples often made votive offerings: treasured items deposited in water and wetlands, or in ritual shafts and wells, often in the same place over generations.[188] Modern clootie wells might be a continuation of this.[198] Most surviving Celtic mythology belongs to the Insular Celtic peoples: Irish mythology has the largest written body of myths, followed by Welsh mythology. These were written down in the early Middle Ages, mainly by Christian scribes. The supernatural race called the Tuatha Dé Danann are believed to represent the main Celtic gods of Ireland. Their traditional rivals are the Fomóire, whom they defeat in the Battle of Mag Tuired.[199] Barry Cunliffe says the underlying structure in Irish myth was a dualism between the male tribal god and the female goddess of the land.[188] The Dagda seems to have been the chief god and the Morrígan his consort, each of whom had other names.[188] One common motif is the sovereignty goddess, who represents the land and bestows sovereignty on a king by marrying him. The goddess Brigid was linked with nature as well as poetry, healing and smithing.[193] Some figures in medieval Insular Celtic myth have ancient continental parallels: Irish Lugh and Welsh Lleu are cognate with Lugus, Goibniu and Gofannon with Gobannos, Macán and Mabon with Maponos, while Macha and Rhiannon may be counterparts of Epona.[200] In Insular Celtic myth, the Otherworld is a parallel realm where the gods dwell. Some mythical heroes visit it by entering ancient burial mounds or caves, by going under water or across the western sea, or after being offered a silver apple branch by an Otherworld resident.[201] Irish myth says that the spirits of the dead travel to the house of Donn (Tech Duinn), a legendary ancestor; this echoes Caesar's comment that the Gauls believed they all descended from a god of the dead and underworld.[188] Insular Celtic peoples celebrated four seasonal festivals, known to the Gaels as Beltaine (1 May), Lughnasa (1 August), Samhain (1 November) and Imbolc (1 February).[188] The Roman invasion of Gaul brought a great deal of Celtic peoples into the Roman Empire. Roman culture had a profound effect on the Celtic tribes which came under the empire's control. Roman influence led to many changes in Celtic religion, the most noticeable of which was the weakening of the druid class, especially religiously; the druids were to eventually disappear altogether. Romano-Celtic deities also began to appear: these deities often had both Roman and Celtic attributes, combined the names of Roman and Celtic deities, or included couples with one Roman and one Celtic deity. Other changes included the adaptation of the Jupiter Column, a sacred column set up in many Celtic regions of the empire, primarily in northern and eastern Gaul. Another major change in religious practice was the use of stone monuments to represent gods and goddesses. The Celts had probably only created wooden cult images (including monuments carved into trees, which were known as sacred poles) before the Roman conquest.[194] While the regions under Roman rule adopted Christianity along with the rest of the Roman empire, unconquered areas of Ireland and Scotland began to move from Celtic polytheism to Christianity in the 5th century. Ireland was converted by missionaries from Britain, such as Saint Patrick. Later missionaries from Ireland were a major source of missionary work in Scotland, Anglo-Saxon parts of Britain, and central Europe (see Hiberno-Scottish mission). Celtic Christianity, the forms of Christianity that took hold in Britain and Ireland at this time, had for some centuries only limited and intermittent contact with Rome and continental Christianity, as well as some contacts with Coptic Christianity. Some elements of Celtic Christianity developed, or retained, features that made them distinct from the rest of Western Christianity, most famously their conservative method of calculating the date of Easter. In 664, the Synod of Whitby began to resolve these differences, mostly by adopting the current Roman practices, which the Gregorian Mission from Rome had introduced to Anglo-Saxon England.[citation needed] Genetic studies on the limited amount of material available suggest continuity between Iron Age people from areas considered Celtic and the earlier Bell Beaker culture of Bronze Age Western Europe.[205][206][207] Like the Bell Beakers, ancient Celts carried a substantial amount of Western Steppe Herders ancestry, which is derived from Yamnaya pastoralists who expanded westwards from the Pontic–Caspian steppe during the late Neolithic and the early Bronze Age and associated with the initial spread of Indo-European languages.[208] This ancestry was particularly prevalent among Celts of Northwest Europe.[207] Examined individuals overwhelmingly carry types of the paternal haplogroup R-M269,[202][203][204] while the maternal haplogroups H and U are frequent.[209][210] These lineages are associated with steppe ancestry.[202][209] The spread of Celts into Iberia and the emergence of the Celtiberians is associated with an increase in north-central European ancestry in Iberia, and may be connected to the expansion of the Urnfield culture.[211] The paternal haplogroup haplogroup I2a1a1a has been detected among Celtiberians.[212] There appears to have been significant gene flow among Celtic peoples of Western Europe during the Iron Age.[213][207] While the Gauls of southern France display genetic links with the Celtiberians, the Gauls of northern France display links with Great Britain and Sweden.[214] Modern populations of Western Europe, particularly those who still speak Celtic languages, display substantial genetic continuity with the Iron Age populations of the same areas.[215][216][217] Geography Organisations",

                "content": "Celtic refers to Irish culture and heritage, along with the historical people who migrated from the British Isles throughout much of Europe. While the early pronunciation was with an /s/ sound, reflecting its nearest origin in French, the modern standard is a hard \"c\" sound like /k/. This is because language historians desired the word to better reflect its Greek and Classical Latin origins. The soft \"c\" sound is usually reserved for sports teams now, like the Boston Celtics. Be it in the pub or in the halls of academia, whenever the topic of Irish culture, language, music, literature—basically, anything Irish—is brought up, the words Celt and Celtic are bound to be heard. In modern-day English, those words are commonly used in reference to the Irish people and their widely-accepted traditions (of course everybody is Irish on St. Patrick's Day; the Celtic cross or knot is a popular tattoo; the Claddagh ring makes a nice gift). The \\k\\ pronunciation for Celt and Celtic dates to the 18th century. The \\k\\ pronunciation for Celt and Celtic dates to the 18th century. The \\k\\ pronunciation for Celt and Celtic dates to the 18th century. The etymology of the noun Celt—from which the adjective Celtic is derived—is straightforward. It's a 16th-century borrowing of the French word Celte, which itself is from Latin Celta, the singular of Celtae, which is the name for a member of an early Indo-European people from antiquity who spread over much of Europe from the British Isles and Spain to Asia Minor. The Latin name is derived from Greek Keltoi, and both the Latin and Greek words referred to the Gauls, the Celtic people who occupied the region that is now France and Belgium. See? Straightforward. With that history laid out, we're wondering how you pronounced all the capital 'c' and 'k' words, especially if you're unfamiliar with French, Latin, Greek, and even English Celt and Celtic, for that matter. The question: is the 'c' sounded \\s\\ or \\k\\? Following its French and Latin predecessors, early pronunciation of Celt was actually \\SELT\\. (In French and Latin, the 'c' is pronounced \\s\\, as in the last name of the French painter Paul Cézanne and in Latin century.) The pronunciation \\KELT\\ started being heard as early as the 18th century, which, in time, ushered in the variant spelling Kelt. The variants were introduced by language and history academics who believed that the pronunciation of Celt should reflect the initial \\k\\ sound in the ancient Greek Keltoi and the Classical Latin Celtae. (It wasn't until the Middle Ages that the letter 'c' in Latin began being pronounced before vowels as the combination \\ts\\—prior, it was pronounced \\k\\; English speakers subsequently reduced the Latin 'c' to a simple \\s\\.) Outside of academia, the variant Kelt never caught on, and it is rarely if ever used today; however, the \\k\\ pronunciation for Celt and Celtic has since flourished. Another influence on pronouncing Celt and Celtic with a soft 'c' is English's phonetic rule for 'c' when followed by 'e' (or 'i,' as in circus or Cicero), which says that, in such cases, the 'c' is usually pronounced as \\s\\. Think cell, cereal, ceiling, and dance. Nevertheless, English speakers, especially those who wanted to sound knowledgeable about things Celtic, grew to prefer the hard 'c' pronunciation, which harkened back to the words' ancient roots. From the 18th century onward, more and more people began sounding the words with an initial \\k\\. By the mid-20th century, \\k\\ became the norm, which is fitting since the pronunciation is in line with that of the Celtic family of languages that include Irish, Scottish Gaelic, Welsh, Breton, and the now-extinct (or, depending on who you talk to, nearly extinct) languages Manx and Cornish. Apparently, people appreciated the ethnic pronunciation. This shift in the pronunciation of Celt is fully evinced when comparing H. W. Fowler's 1926 Dictionary of Modern English with Robert Burchfield's 1996 revised edition. Here's what Fowler had to say about Celt(ic): \"The spelling C-, & the pronunciation s-, are the established ones, & no useful purpose seems to be served by the substitution of k-.\" Decades later, Burchfield observes a different trend: \"Except for the football club Celtic (in Glasgow), which is pronounced [SEL-tik], both Celt and Celtic are pronounced with initial \\k\\ in standard English.\" Burchfield is referring to the Scottish Celtic Football Club, founded in 1887. In America, there is basketball's Boston Celtics, founded in 1946, whose name is also pronounced with an initial \\s\\. The European away support that Celtic enjoys is phenomenal. Few clubs have a fanbase that travels in such numbers or makes as much noise, all the more remarkable when you consider the poor record that the club has away from home in recent times.— Liam Kelly, The Celtic Star, 20 Feb. 2020 Aside from this use of the initial soft 'c' in sports teams' names, Celtic with a hard 'c' is the standard; however, you might still sometimes hear the 'c' softly sounded by those who are uninitiated in the history and etymology of Celt and Celtic as well as those who are unfamiliar with the words and resort to the phonetic rules of English. (And, as happens so often in English, those phonetic rules let them down.) See Definitions and Examples » Get Word of the Day daily email! Learn a new word every day.

                "content": "Melvin Wayne Osmond (August 28, 1951 – January 1, 2025) was an American musician. He was the second-oldest of the original Osmond Brothers singers and the fourth-oldest of the nine Osmond children. Starting in 1958, Wayne and three of his brothers (Alan, Merrill, and Jay in their respective age orders) began singing as a barbershop quartet. They were later discovered in 1961 by Jay Emerson Williams, the father of Andy Williams, at a performance at Disneyland which was being filmed for the Disneyland After Dark episode of Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color. In 1962, the four Osmonds were cast over a seven-year period on NBC's The Andy Williams Show, a musical variety program. After their early singles failed, MGM Records signed the band, inspired by the success of the Jackson 5, and sent them to Muscle Shoals. There, they recorded One Bad Apple , a song initially written for the Jacksons but rejected by their label. [2] Each of these four Osmond brothers were also cast in nine episodes of the 1963–1964 ABC Western series, The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters, with Wayne in the role of young Leviticus Kissel. In the band's rock formation, Osmond played guitar[3] and occasionally drums,[4] among many other instruments, with Osmond recalling shortly before his death that he learned to play eight instruments during his time with the band.[5] He was found to have perfect pitch.[3] His last intended appearance with the Osmonds was October 13, 2018; however, the four brothers performed as a group a year later at CBS daytime show The Talk, as a birthday present to their sister, Marie.[6][7] Osmond was born on August 28, 1951, to Olive May (née Davis; 1925–2004) and George Virl Osmond (1917–2007) in Ogden, Utah. He was the fourth oldest out of nine children.[8] Like the rest of his family, he was a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.[7] On December 13, 1974, Osmond married Kathlyn White from Bountiful, Utah, a former Miss Davis County Fair and Miss Utah of 1974. They had five children, three daughters and two sons.[9][10] In the 1990s, Osmond moved to Branson, Missouri. In 1997, he was diagnosed with a brain tumor, which was successfully treated at the expense of his hearing; the treatment damaged his cochlea, leaving Osmond nearly deaf.[11] A stroke in 2012 left him unable to play guitar.[3] In 2019, Mr. Osmond performed with Alan, Merrill, and Jay Osmond in what Marie Osmond called their final live performance on The Talk. He held a pilot's license, from which he earned the nickname \"Wings,\" and continued to fly aircraft until mobility issues prevented him from doing so near the end of his life.[5] Osmond suffered another, more serious stroke and died at University of Utah Hospital in Salt Lake City, Utah, on January 1, 2025, at the age of 73, surrounded by his wife and children.[4][5][12] This article about an American musician is a stub.

                "content": "Advertisement Supported by He was a founding member of the family pop group, whose slew of hits in the 1970s included the No. 1 record “One Bad Apple.” By Hank Sanders and Emmett Lindner Wayne Osmond, an original member of the Osmonds, the family singing group that had a string of pop hits in the 1970s and helped launch the careers of his more renowned siblings Donny and Marie, died on Wednesday in Salt Lake City. He was 73. His death, at University of Utah Hospital, was caused by complications of a recent stroke, his daughter Amy Cook said. As an original member of the group, which began as a sibling quartet called the Osmond Brothers, Wayne and his brothers were child stars and later became ubiquitous pop stars. As practicing Mormons, the family built a brand around resisting the temptations of fame while capturing the spirit of the era with their flared jumpsuits and rollicking dance choreography. Songs like “One Bad Apple” and “Yo-Yo” became Top 10 singles in the early 1970s (“One Bad Apple” reached No. 1). The group drew comparisons to the Jackson Five — young Donny, known for his raspy high notes, was their equivalent of Michael Jackson — and reached a feverish level of fame. When the Osmonds landed at Heathrow Airport in London on a trip to Britain in 1972, “they were lucky to escape alive,” a reporter wrote in The New York Times that year, and they “produced the kind of teary, lip‐trembling, shrieking scenes that recalled the early impact of the Beatles, post‐Liverpool.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Stockton was born in Tiger, Georgia, to Rob and Sherri Stockton, both former collegiate athletes. Rob played football at Georgia Southern and Sherri played basketball at Erskine College.[1][2] He was named after one of his great-grandfathers, V.D. Stockton, a World War II veteran who served in a plane, earning the nickname Gunner.[1] Stockton grew up in a family of Georgia Bulldogs fans, his grandfather Lawrence Stockton was a University of Georgia alumnus and ticket holder who was sprayed with firehoses and arrested after the 1986 edition of the Deep South's Oldest Rivalry for rushing No. 8 Auburn's field following a Georgia upset victory. Lawrence died of a heart attack in 2010 exiting EverBank Stadium after watching Georgia lose to Florida 34-31 in overtime in their annual rivalry game.[2][3] Stockton began playing quarterback for his youth football team at age six and was trained by George Bobo, the father of Georgia offensive coordinator Mike Bobo.[2][4][3] He attended Rabun County High School and played baseball and football; he was a two-time baseball All-American but was best in football.[5] As a freshman, Stockton earned the football team's starting quarterback job and led them to a region championship and state playoff quarterfinals appearance.[6] That season, he threw for 2,917 yards and 34 touchdowns to only six interceptions while completing 65 percent of his passes, additionally running for 709 yards and 17 touchdowns with an average of 6.8 yards-per-carry.[6] He was named the Football Player of the Year by newspaper Now Habersham for his performance.[6] Stockton became highly recruited and was invited to the 2022 All-American Bowl after his freshman season, receiving offers from Alabama and Penn State.[7][8] As a sophomore in 2019, he threw for 3,472 yards and 43 touchdowns while running for 1,179 yards and 16 scores.[9] He became a five-star recruit for the Class of 2022 and was ranked the best dual-threat quarterback nationally 247Sports.[9] Prior to the 2020 season, Stockton's junior year, he committed to play college football for the South Carolina Gamecocks over the Georgia Bulldogs.[10] In 2020, he threw for 3,128 yards and 45 touchdowns and ran for 1,581 yards and a further 26 touchdowns, helping Rabun County reach the state playoff semifinals with a 12–2 record.[5][11] After South Carolina dismissed coaches Will Muschamp and Mike Bobo, Stockton flipped his commitment to Georgia.[12] As a senior in 2021, he led them to the state playoff quarterfinals again with a 12–2 record while throwing for 4,134 yards, 55 touchdowns and only one interception, being named All-State for the fourth time in his career and being named the Gatorade Georgia Player of the Year.[5][13] He set the state records in passing touchdowns, total passing and rushing touchdowns and combined passing and rushing yards.[13] He totaled 13,562 passing yards and 177 passing touchdowns at Rabun County while also running for 4,372 yards and 77 touchdowns in his career.[5] Stockton enrolled early at Georgia in January 2022.[5][14][15] He redshirted as a true freshman in 2022, completing one pass for nine yards in the annual G-Day intrasquad game.[5] He was a member of their 2022 national championship team.[16][17] In the 2023 G-Day game, he completed 13-of-22 pass attempts for 144 yards, no touchdown and an interception while running for one score.[18] He battled Carson Beck and Brock Vandagriff for a starting role in the 2023 season, with Beck winning and Stockton being the third-string behind Vandagriff.[19][16] He made his collegiate debut in a win over the UT Martin Skyhawks, completing three-of-five passes for 29 yards.[5][20] Stockton saw further action in games against Ball State and UAB, ending the regular season with six completions on nine attempts for 52 yards with an interception.[21] He also appeared in the team's 2023 Orange Bowl win over Florida State, throwing for 96 yards and two touchdowns.[22] Entering the 2024 season, Stockton was listed as the backup quarterback behind Beck.[1] In the 2024 SEC Championship Game, Stockton replaced Beck after halftime, following an injury to Beck.[23] He threw for 72 yards and an interception, as Georgia went on to win 22–19 in overtime.[24] With Beck ruled out for the remainder of the season, Stockton was thrusted into the starting role to begin the Bulldogs' College Football Playoff run, beginning in the 2025 Sugar Bowl.[25]",

Gunner was elevated to the role of starting quarterback for the University of Georgia after quarterback Carson Beck suffered an elbow injury during the SEC Championship Game against Texas on December 7. Beck underwent season-ending surgery and has since declared himself for the 2025 NFL Draft. Born in Tiger, Georgia, roughly 75 miles from University of Georgia’s campus in Athens, Gunner grew up a massive fan of the Bulldogs. A son of two collegiate athletes — his father, Rob, played football at Georgia Southern and his mom, Sherri, played basketball at Erskine College — he has athletics in his blood. “The number one thing for Gunner is he’s known our community, and especially our family, his friends, and those people closest to him, believe in him,” Rob told UGASports in a story published on Sunday, December 29. “We’ve always loved him and want the best for him. This is something that he’s worked for [and] something he’s dreamed of.” Rob added, “You look at pictures of your kid, and they’re throwing the ball in your backyard and dreaming of being the starting quarterback at the University of Georgia. It has happened. It is unreal.” For more about Gunner’s story, keep reading. Gunner’s great-grandfather, V.D. Stockton, served in World War II. A newspaper at the time referred to him as “Gunner Stockton.” According to The Athletic, Gunner’s parents liked the nickname so much that they decided to give it to their son. In October 2010, Gunner’s grandfather, Lawrence Stockton, died shortly after leaving Georgia’s 34-31 overtime loss to the Florida Gators at Jacksonville’s EverBank Field. According to ESPN, Lawrence walked back to a tailgating area after the game and collapsed and died from a heart attack. He was 63 years old. Gunner shares a close bond with his oldest sister, Georgia, his only sibling. The duo shared a cute moment when Georgia was dropped off at Presbyterian College in Clinton, South Carolina in the summer of 2019. “PC officially has a baller on campus,” Gunner shared via Instagram. “I know it’s gonna be hard for you not seeing me everyday but hopefully it won’t be too hard for ya 😂. You are the best. Love you more than you know ❤️” In 2021, Gunner and Georgia took in a Bulldogs game from the sidelines of Sanford Stadium. “Pretty good way to end the week,” Gunner shared via Instagram alongside a picture of him and his sister. Gunner, Georgia and the rest of their extended family spent the holidays together in 2024, just days before the Bulldogs’ game against Notre Dame in the 2025 Sugar Bowl, as evidenced by a series of photos shared by Georgia via Instagram. Gunner originally committed to play quarterback at SEC rival South Carolina. However, he announced his decommitment in January 2021. “After much discussion and prayer with my family, I have decided to decommit from The University of South Carolina,” Gunner said in a statement at the time. “Back in August, I made the decision to commit to the University, program, and staff. A lot has changed since that time, and I feel that I should reevaluate my situation.” Gunner’s decision came on the heels of Will Muschamp, the head coach to which Gunner committed, being fired. The quarterback announced his commitment to the University of Georgia later that month. If you see a 1984 Ford F-150 driving around Georgia’s campus, that’s just the team’s starting quarterback. “It was literally broke down, parked up at their house and wouldn’t crank,” his father, Rob, told the Athens Banner-Herald in a story published on Friday, December 27. “He wanted to get it running, so me and him tinkered with it.” You have successfully subscribed.

The redshirt sophomore took the helm as UGA's QB after Carson Beck got injured during the first half of the SEC Championship Game in December. Beck was attempting a deep shot into the end zone when he was hit from behind by a Texas defensive lineman in the middle of his throwing motion. RELATED: What to know about Georgia-Notre Dame CFP matchup in Sugar Bowl Beck has since had surgery on his right elbow to repair his ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) and is recovering while he also declared for the 2025 NFL Draft. But despite the shakeup during the SEC Championship, Stockton took to the field in the second half of the game -- adding a bit of spark for the Dawgs. Georgia had only scored three points in the first half, and the Dawgs went on to win the SEC Championship in overtime against Texas, 22-19. During the game, Stockton turned in a mostly efficient stewardship of the Bulldogs' offense, completing 13 of his 16 pass attempts for 135 yards with an interception. The numbers weren't eye-popping, but the Dawgs found an offensive rhythm in the second half with Stockton under center. After the SEC Championship victory, Smart had emotional praise for Stockton. \"The kid's a winner. This kid's special,\" Smart said. \"He's a winner.\" Smart elaborated in postgame comments, calling Stockton a \"phenomenal leader\" and saying that he felt like \"everybody rose up around him\" in the second half. As the Dawgs gear up for Thursday's rescheduled Sugar Bowl against Notre Dame, fans await how the new man in charge will fare in this highly anticipated game. A win for Georgia means the Bulldogs are headed to the College Football Playoff Semifinal at the Orange Bowl. For more information about the 2025 Sugar Bowl, click here.

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Only one more quarter stands between the Lakers and the win they were favored to collect coming into this evening. They have a bit of a cushion as they currently lead the Trail Blazers 88-77. If the Lakers keep playing like this, they'll bump their record up to 19-14 in no time. On the other hand, the Trail Blazers will have to make due with an 11-22 record unless they turn things around (and fast). Portland Trail Blazers @ Los Angeles Lakers Current Records: Portland 11-21, Los Angeles 18-14 The Trail Blazers have enjoyed a three-game homestand but will soon have to dust off their road jerseys. They will venture away from home to challenge the Los Angeles Lakers at 10:30 p.m. ET on Thursday at Crypto.com Arena. The Trail Blazers might want some stickum for this one as the team gave up 24 turnovers on Monday. The Trail Blazers are hoping to turn things around on Thursday after a slow start to the season, which is looking a lot like last year's. They suffered a grim 125-103 defeat to the 76ers. Portland was down 91-72 at the end of the third quarter, and things only got worse from there. Meanwhile, the Lakers couldn't handle the Cavaliers on Tuesday and fell 122-110. The loss doesn't tell the whole story though, as several players had good games. One of the most active was Austin Reaves, who almost dropped a triple-double on 35 points, nine rebounds, and ten assists. The match was his third in a row with at least 30 points. Another player making a difference was Anthony Davis, who dropped a double-double on 28 points and 13 rebounds. Portland's loss ended a three-game streak of wins at home and dropped them to 11-21. As for Los Angeles, their defeat dropped their record down to 18-14. The Trail Blazers are hoping to beat the odds on Thursday, as the experts think they're headed for a loss. Anyone thinking of taking them against the spread should keep this in mind: the team hasn't covered the last three times they've played Los Angeles. The Trail Blazers came up short against the Lakers in their previous matchup back in December of 2024, falling 107-98. Can the Trail Blazers avenge their loss or is history doomed to repeat itself? We'll find out soon enough. Los Angeles is a big 9-point favorite against Portland, according to the latest NBA odds. The oddsmakers had a good feel for the line for this one, as the game opened with the Lakers as a 8-point favorite. The over/under is 224.5 points.

                "content": "SPOILERS AHEAD! You are in the right place if you're after hints to solve today's NYT Connections puzzle by yourself. Slowly reveal today's Connections answers here! We have our dedicated Connections answers page for a complete archive of past solutions. Scroll to the bottom, and you'll see all the answers from the NYT Connections Solutions History. We've been keeping track, so you don't have to. If you play word games, you'll have heard of the new NYT Connections game, already played by loads of daily puzzle enthusiasts - you have to place the 16 words on the grid into four groups or categories that share a common thread. Some days are easier than others, so help is here with today's NYT Connections hints. Not every NYT connections player wants today's answers. That's why we created this page! Here, we will give you one connection clue for each category to help you solve today's puzzle yourself - feel free to bookmark this page whenever you need a quick connections hint. Looking to sharpen your Wordle skills? Don't forget to check out today's Wordle answer. We've got a whole page dedicated to it, with daily solutions, Wordle hints, an archive of past answers, and a lot more. For buzzy players, you'll find \"What is today's Spelling Bee pangram?\" over on our NYT Spelling Bee Answers segment. We have scoured our database for pangram solutions so you can uplevel to QB status (Queen Bee) without relying on Hivemind. Use our NYT Connections hint page to get help when you need it! Here are a few how-tos for using it. Say you want to search for a quick hint but don't want to know exactly which categories the 16 words go into; tap on the first flashcard labeled SEE HINT. This button will give you a short clue to help you guess the category title. We've color-coded them to help you out using the NYT Connections colors, and they're ordered from easy to most difficult. (Yellow to Purple) If you need the category title, we've got that too. Simply tap the flashcard labeled SEE GROUP, and the name of each category will come up. You might use this if you're stuck on a particular guess and unsure which category you want. If you're completely stuck, we have all of today's Connections answers. We've left this until the end, partially for suspense and also to help those who want to solve the daily puzzle themselves. Tap SEE WORD to see which of the 16 words go into which group. Again this is color-coded so you can see how difficult each group was to guess, according to The New York Times. NYT Connections is pretty similar to a game you might have played as a child called Categories. However, instead of having a certain starting letter (like in categories), you start with 16 words on your grid. Each group has four words that share a common thread. You have to place these words into one of the four categories or groups without making four mistakes. You make a mistake when you group the wrong words in a category. Every time you guess a correct group NYT Connections will tell you which color group you guessed correctly. Each of the four groups has a color associated with it, and they each mean a slightly different thing. 🟡 Yellow Simple or easy answer. 🟢 Green Fairly easy to guess. 🔵 Blue It is an unfamiliar answer or trivia. 🟣 Purple The most difficult to guess. It could be anything from slang to trivia. Once you've made all your guesses, you can share your NYT Connections solution grid with your friends. Solving the daily puzzle is fairly straightforward, but you'll have to know about categorizations before you start; being good with trivia also helps! Here’s our tips to get started. Like any good word game puzzle, there are a few skills you can brush up on before you start playing, and with time these skills will get stronger the more you play. NYT Connections' current editor Wyna Liu says the blue and green groups are medium-difficult. That's because words grouped into blue or green are often based on trivia questions like FILE EXTENSIONS or SYNONYMS FOR..... So, get that board game out or that book about useless information and start swatting up on trivial facts (because they may help you!). Before you make any guesses, assess which words could be categorized. Once you see one, get it out of the way as soon as possible. That way, you narrow down your word choices for your next guess.

Plus, the editors often include words that seem like they could have a connection to throw players off their game. Here are some tips and tricks to help you solve NYT Connections puzzles more effectively: Start with the easiest connections, these are usually the most straightforward categories. Scan for synonyms or similar items: Sometimes connections are made up of obvious relationships like synonyms, homophones, or word forms. Once you've solved an easier group, those words will be removed from the grid. The remaining words may seem less random and give clues to other groups. Narrow down tricky groups by focusing on what’s left and seeing if they share more abstract traits. Beware of misleading overlaps. Some words may seem to fit into multiple categories, like \"CRASH\" fitting into both \"car accidents\" and \"loud noises\". Try multiple ideas, but keep in mind you only have four mistakes. Focus on the less obvious words after the easiest groups are cleared. Many groups have more abstract relationships (e.g., \"things that spin\" or \"words with double meanings\"). Keep your mind open to less tangible connections. Connections may also involve wordplay, including homophones, abbreviations, or puns. For example, “SLIP” and “SNEAK” may refer to types of shoes. Think about themes like time periods, shapes, word endings, or even cultural references like games, movies, musical genres, sports, geography, science, or historical events. Try grouping words by their part of speech. For example, all verbs (e.g., run, jump, swim) might form a group. Identify plural or singular forms and group similar grammatical forms together. Some groups may be tied together by shared prefixes and suffixes like “-tion,” “-able,” or “re-.” This can help identify a connection between words that otherwise seem unrelated. Look for words that can form familiar phrases or compound words by adding the same word before or after them. For example, if you see \"JUICE,\" \"ORCHARD,\" \"CIDER,\" and \"SAUCE,\" think of \"APPLE __.\" Try both directions to find hidden connections, focusing on common categories like food (\"__ PEPPER\") or places (\"NEW __\"). This quick check often reveals less obvious groupings and helps solve the most challenging parts of the puzzle. Avoid guessing wildly. You only have four chances to make mistakes. If you start seeing connections that seem plausible, try grouping them before submitting. This is a game that rewards both observation and patience. Don’t rush through your guesses! If there’s a word that could belong with a couple others, use our tool to identify which color group it belongs to. Or if you’re completely stuck, reveal the topic of one of the groups – this will open up the grid for you. Download the App Follow Us: © 1996-2025 LoveToKnow Media, except where otherwise noted.

                "content": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex (/ˈmɛɡən/; born Rachel Meghan Markle; August 4, 1981) is an American member of the British royal family, media personality and former actress. She is married to Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, the younger son of King Charles III. Meghan was born and raised in Los Angeles, California. Her acting career began at Northwestern University. She played the part of Rachel Zane for seven seasons (2011–2018) in the American TV legal drama Suits. She also developed a social media presence, which included The Tig (2014–2017), a lifestyle blog. During The Tig period, Meghan became involved in charity work focused primarily on women's issues and social justice. She was married to American film producer Trevor Engelson from 2011 until their divorce in 2014. Meghan retired from acting upon her marriage to Prince Harry in 2018 and became known as the Duchess of Sussex. Meghan and Harry have two children: Archie and Lilibet. The couple stepped down as working royals in January 2020, moved to Meghan's native Southern California and launched Archewell Inc., a Beverly Hills-based mix of for-profit and not-for-profit (charitable) business organizations. In March 2021, she and her husband participated in Oprah with Meghan and Harry, a much-publicized American television interview by Oprah Winfrey. She has written The Bench (a picture book for children) and presented a podcast Archetypes. Meghan and Harry starred in Harry & Meghan, a Netflix docuseries, which was released in December 2022. Rachel Meghan Markle was born on August 4, 1981, at West Park Hospital in Canoga Park, Los Angeles, California. She identifies as mixed race; \"My dad is Caucasian and my mom is African American. I'm half black and half white.\"[1] Her parents – former makeup artist Doria Ragland (born 1956) and Thomas Markle Sr. (born 1944), a television lighting director and director of photography[2][3] – separated when she was two years old and divorced four years later.[4][5][6] Markle reportedly has a close relationship with her mother.[7][8] Until the age of nine, both parents contributed to raising her; then, her father was left in charge of caring for her (while her mother pursued a career) so Meghan lived with him full-time before commencing university at age eighteen.[9][10] Markle Sr. worked as a director of photography and lighting for General Hospital and Married... with Children, and Meghan occasionally visited the set of Married... with Children as a child.[11][12] In later life, she became estranged from her father and paternal half-siblings, Samantha Markle and Thomas Markle Jr.[13][14] Growing up in View Park–Windsor Hills, Los Angeles,[15] Markle attended Hollywood Little Red Schoolhouse.[16][17] At age eleven, she and her classmates wrote to Procter & Gamble to gender-neutralize a dishwashing soap commercial on national television.[18] She was raised as a Christian, though conflicting reports indicate she was raised either Catholic or Protestant.[19][20][21] She graduated from Immaculate Heart High School (Los Angeles), a fee-charging all-girls Catholic school.[22] Markle took part in plays and musicals at the school, where her father helped with lighting.[23] During her teenage years, she worked at a local frozen yogurt shop and later as a waitress and babysitter.[24][25] She also volunteered at a soup kitchen in Skid Row, Los Angeles.[26][27] In 1999, she was admitted to Northwestern University (NU) in Evanston, Illinois, where she joined Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority.[28][29] With other members of Kappa Kappa Gamma, Markle did volunteer work with the Glass Slipper Project. After her junior year, her uncle Michael Markle helped secure her an internship as a junior press officer at the American embassy in Buenos Aires,[30] and considered a political career.[31][32] However, she did not score high enough in the Foreign Service Officer Test to proceed further with the US State Department[33] and returned to NU. She also attended a study abroad program in Madrid.[29] In 2003, Markle earned her bachelor's degree with a double major in theater and international studies from Northwestern's School of Communication.[31][33] According to Markle, she had some difficulty getting roles early in her career due to being \"ethnically ambiguous\" because \"I wasn't black enough for the black roles and I wasn't white enough for the white ones.\"[34] To support herself between acting jobs, she worked as a freelance calligrapher and taught bookbinding.[11][35] Her first on-screen appearance was a small role as a nurse in an episode of the daytime soap opera General Hospital,[36][37] a show for which her father served as a lighting director.[38] Markle had small guest roles on the television shows Century City (2004), The War at Home (2006) and CSI: NY (2006).[36] For her role in Century City, she told the casting directors that she was a SAG-AFTRA member when she was not, but after being cast, the employers were obliged to help her join the union according to the Taft–Hartley Act.[39] Markle also did several contract acting and modeling jobs. Between 2006 and 2007, she worked as a \"briefcase girl\" on 34 episodes of the US version of the game show Deal or No Deal.[11] She appeared in Fox's series Fringe as Junior Agent Amy Jessup in the first two episodes of its second season.[40] Markle appeared in small roles in the films Get Him to the Greek, Remember Me (produced by her then-partner Trevor Engelson) and The Candidate in 2010 and the film Horrible Bosses in 2011.[41] She was paid $187,000 for her role in Remember Me and $171,429 for her role in the short film The Candidate.[42] In July 2011, she joined the cast of the USA Network show Suits through to late 2017 and the seventh season. Her character, Rachel Zane, began as a paralegal and eventually became an attorney.[43] While working on Suits, she lived for nine months each year in Toronto.[44][45] Fortune magazine estimated that she was paid $50,000 per episode, amounting to an equivalent annual salary of $450,000.[46] Markle and American film producer Trevor Engelson began dating in 2004.[47][48] They were married in Ocho Rios, Jamaica on August 16, 2011.[49] They separated in July 2013, and granted a no-fault divorce in February 2014, citing irreconcilable differences.[50] Markle's subsequent live-in relationship with Canadian celebrity chef and restaurateur Cory Vitiello ended in May 2016 after almost two years.[51] In mid-2016,[52] Markle began a relationship with Prince Harry, a grandson of Queen Elizabeth II.[53][54] According to the couple, they first connected with each other via Instagram,[55] and they have also said that they were set up on a blind date by a mutual friend in July 2016.[52] On November 8, eight days after the relationship was made public by the press, the prince directed his communications secretary to release a statement on his behalf to express personal concern about pejorative and false comments made about his girlfriend by mainstream media and internet trolls.[56][57] Later, in a letter to a British media regulator, Markle's representatives complained about harassment from journalists.[58] In September 2017, Markle and Prince Harry appeared together in public in Toronto at the Invictus Games, of which Harry is founding patron.[59][60] Meghan Markle's engagement to Prince Harry was announced on November 27, 2017, by Harry's father Charles (then the Prince of Wales).[61] The announcement was greeted with enthusiasm by the British media and prompted generally positive comments about a mixed-race person as a member of the royal family,[62] especially in regard to Commonwealth countries.[9] Markle announced that she would retire from acting[63][64] and her intention to become a British citizen.[65] In preparation for the wedding, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, baptized Markle and confirmed her in the Church of England on March 6, 2018.[66] The private ceremony, performed with water from the River Jordan, took place in the Chapel Royal at St James's Palace.[66] The marriage ceremony was held on May 19 at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle.[67] Her wedding dress was designed by Clare Waight Keller.[68] Markle later revealed that there was a private exchange of vows three days earlier, with the Archbishop of Canterbury in the couple's garden.[69] However, this private exchange of vows was not a legally recognized marriage.[70][71] After the wedding, the Duke and Duchess lived at Nottingham Cottage in London, in the grounds of Kensington Palace.[72] In May 2018, it was reported that they had signed a two-year lease on Westfield Large, located on the Great Tew Estate in the Cotswolds.[73] They gave up the lease after photos of the house and its interior were published by a paparazzi agency.[73] The couple considered settling at the twenty-one room Apartment 1 within Kensington Palace,[74][75] but moved to Frogmore Cottage in the Home Park of Windsor Castle instead.[76][77] The Crown Estate refurbished the cottage at a cost of £2.4 million, paid out of the Sovereign Grant, with the Duke later reimbursing expenses beyond restoration and ordinary maintenance, a part of which was offset against rental payments that were due at the time.[78][79] Meghan gave birth to a son, Archie, on May 6, 2019.[80] The Duke and Duchess of Sussex's office moved to Buckingham Palace and officially closed on March 31, 2020, when the Sussexes withdrew from undertaking official royal engagements.[81][82] After some months in Canada and the United States, in June 2020, the couple bought a house on the former estate of Riven Rock, Montecito, California.[83][84] The next month, Meghan suffered a miscarriage.[85] She gave birth to a daughter, Lilibet, on June 4, 2021.[86] The Duke and Duchess own a Labrador named Pula and two Beagles named Guy and Mamma Mia.[87][88] Meghan previously owned a Labrador-German Shepherd cross named Bogart.[89] Markle was politically vocal before marrying Prince Harry. At age 9, she and her friends reportedly campaigned against the Gulf War.[90] Decades later, she backed Hillary Clinton during the 2016 United States presidential election and publicly denounced the opponent and eventual winner, Donald Trump. In the same year, when the referendum on the United Kingdom's membership of the European Union resulted in favor of Brexit, Markle expressed her disappointment on Instagram.[91] In 2017, Markle recommended the book Who Rules the World? by left-wing intellectual Noam Chomsky on her Instagram account.[92] In July 2018, Irish Senator Catherine Noone tweeted that the Duchess was \"pleased to see the result\" of the Irish referendum on legalizing abortion. Meghan received criticism for potentially breaching the protocol that prohibits royals from interfering in politics;[93] Noone deleted her tweet and emphasized that her statement was misleading and \"the Duchess was not in any way political\".[93] After she returned to the United States and as an eligible voter, she released a video with her husband encouraging others to register for the 2020 United States presidential election on National Voter Registration Day. Some media outlets took it as an implicit endorsement of the Democratic candidate, Joe Biden, which prompted then-President Trump to dismiss their messaging at a press conference.[94] In October 2021, she penned an open letter to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, advocating for paid leave for parents.[95] Her remarks were met by backlash from Republican representatives Jason Smith and Lisa McClain, who found her statement \"out of touch\" and criticized her interference with American politics while utilizing her British royal titles.[96] Meghan has reportedly lobbied senators from both parties on the issue of paid family leave, including Democratic senators Patty Murray and Kirsten Gillibrand, as well as Republican senators Shelley Moore Capito and Susan Collins.[97][98] She has also publicly spoken in support of federal voting protections.[99] In February 2022, she voiced her support for the Supreme Court nomination of Ketanji Brown Jackson.[100] In June 2022, she publicly supported Moms Demand Action, an organization which campaigns for safer gun laws in the US.[101] In the same month, in an interview with Jessica Yellin for Vogue, Meghan criticized the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States that abortion is not a protected constitutional right and voiced her support for the proposed Equal Rights Amendment.[102] After becoming engaged, Markle's first official public appearance with Prince Harry was at a World AIDS Day walkabout in Nottingham on December 1, 2017.[103][104] On March 12, the 2018 Commonwealth Day service at Westminster Abbey was the first royal event she attended with the Queen.[105] On March 23, Harry and Meghan made an unannounced day visit to Northern Ireland.[106] In total, Markle attended 26 public engagements prior to the wedding.[107] Meghan's first official engagement after marriage was on May 22, when she and her husband attended a garden party celebrating the charity work of King Charles III (then the Prince of Wales).[108] In July 2018, Meghan's first official trip abroad as a royal was to Dublin, Ireland, alongside Harry.[109][110] In October 2018, the Duke and Duchess traveled to Sydney for the 2018 Invictus Games.[111] This formed part of a Pacific tour that included Australia, Fiji, Tonga and New Zealand.[112][113] As representatives of the Queen, the couple were greeted warmly by crowds in Sydney, and the announcement of Meghan's pregnancy hours after their arrival delighted the public and media.[113][114] During their visit to Morocco in February 2019, the Duke and Duchess focused on projects centered on \"women's empowerment, girls' education, inclusivity and encouragement of social entrepreneurship\".[115] Meghan also participated in her husband's work as youth ambassador to the Commonwealth, which included overseas tours.[116][117] As part of establishing a separate office from that of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in 2019, the Duke and Duchess created an Instagram social media account, which broke the record for the fastest account at the time to reach a million followers.[118] In July 2019, the Duchess's security team were criticized for creating an empty zone of about 40 seats around her at Wimbledon where she was watching a match between Serena Williams and Kaja Juvan.[119] In August 2019, Meghan and her husband were criticized by environmental campaigners for using private jets regularly when taking their personal trips abroad, which would leave more carbon footprint per person compared to commercial planes. The criticism was in line with similar criticism faced by the royal family in June 2019, after it was claimed that they \"had doubled [their] carbon footprint from business travel\".[120][121] In September and October 2019, a Southern African tour included Malawi, Angola, South Africa and Botswana. Archie traveled with his parents, making it \"their first official tour as a family\".[122] Meghan completed 179 engagements in total in 2018 and 2019.[123] In January 2020, Meghan and Harry returned to the UK from a vacation in Canada and announced that they were stepping back from their role as senior members of the royal family and would balance their time between the United Kingdom and North America.[124][125] A statement released by the Palace confirmed that the Duke and Duchess were to cease to undertake royal duties as representatives of the Queen and would therefore no longer receive the relevant financial support.[126] The couple would retain their HRH styles but not use them.[126] The formal role of the Duke and Duchess was subject to a twelve-month review period, ending in March 2021. Meghan's final public solo engagement as a senior royal was a visit to Robert Clack School on March 7, 2020, in Dagenham ahead of International Women's Day.[127] She and Harry attended the Commonwealth Day service at Westminster Abbey on March 9, 2020, which was their last engagement as a couple before they officially stepped down on March 31. Two years later, they made their first official appearance in the UK in June 2022 while attending the Platinum Jubilee National Service of Thanksgiving.[128] They visited the UK and Germany in September 2022 for a number of charity events in Manchester and Düsseldorf.[129] On September 8, 2022, while Meghan and Harry were in London preparing to attend a charity event, Queen Elizabeth II died at Balmoral Castle in Scotland, and they remained in the United Kingdom for her funeral.[130] Meghan and Harry visited Nigeria in May 2024 to honor the work of the Invictus Games. Meghan had previously stated that a genetic test had found she was of 43% Nigerian ancestry. According to CNN, their trip focused on \"sports rehabilitation, mental health, and women's empowerment\".[131] Meghan co-hosted a women's empowerment summit with the head of the World Trade Organization, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, and she was honored in a ceremony by some of the Nigerian Chiefs.[131] In summer 2019, before announcing their decision to step down in January 2020, Meghan and her husband were involved in talks with Jeffrey Katzenberg, the founder of the now-defunct streaming platform Quibi, over a possible role in the service without gaining personal profits, but they eventually decided against joining the project.[132] In September 2019, it was reported that the couple had hired New York-based PR firm Sunshine Sachs, which represented them until 2022.[133][134][135] The couple has also been associated with Adam Lilling's Plus Capital, a venture capital fund designed to connect early stage companies with influencers and investors.[136] In June 2020, they signed with the Harry Walker Agency, owned by media company Endeavor, to conduct paid public speaking engagements.[137] In September 2020, the Sussexes signed a private commercial deal with Netflix.[138] In December 2020, it was announced that Meghan had invested in Clevr Blends, a coffee company based in Southern California.[139][140] In the same month, Meghan and Harry signed a multi-year deal with Spotify to produce and host their own programs through their audio producing company, Archewell Audio.[141] A holiday special was released by the couple on the service in December 2020,[142] while Meghan's podcast, titled Archetypes, premiered in August 2022.[143][144] In June 2023, Spotify cancelled the podcast, which ran for a single season of 12 episodes.[145][146] The Bench, a picture book written by Meghan with illustrations by Christian Robinson, was published in June 2021 by Random House Children's Books. It is based on her perception of the relationship between her husband and their son.[147] The book received a mixed response; it garnered praise for its illustrations and messaging but was criticized for its structure and writing.[148][149][150] On June 17, the book reached number one in the children's picture books category of The New York Times Best Seller list.[151] In July 2021, it was announced that Meghan would executive produce, alongside David Furnish, a Netflix animated series called Pearl.[152] The series was originally pitched to Netflix in 2018.[153][154] Pearl would depict the adventures of a 12-year-old girl who is inspired by influential women from history,[155] but the project was canceled in May 2022.[156] In the same month, it was reported that Meghan and Harry had signed a four-book publishing deal with Random House, including a wellness guide by Meghan and a memoir by Harry.[157] In October 2021, Meghan and Harry announced their partnership with Ethic, a sustainable investment firm based in New York City, which also manages the couple's investments.[158][159] According to state filings from Delaware, where the couple's Archewell foundation is registered, Meghan and Harry incorporated 11 companies and a trust beginning in early 2020 which include Orinoco Publishing LLC and Peca Publishing LLC to hold the rights for their books as well as Cobblestone Lane LLC and IPHW LLC which are holders of their foundation's logos.[160] Frim Fram Inc., which ran The Tig, had been registered earlier as a new corporation in Delaware in December 2019.[161] Harry & Meghan, a docuseries about the Sussexes, was produced by Netflix and the couple's Archewell Productions and premiered on December 8, 2022.

She visited the kitchen regularly and suggested that the displaced women publish a cookbook to assist in funding for the group.[183] Together: Our Community Cookbook, her first charity project as Duchess of Sussex, was announced in September.[184] In August 2020, Meghan used proceeds from the cookbook to donate £8,000 to the UK charity Migrateful, which supports refugees, asylum seekers and migrants by helping them organize cookery classes.[185] In March 2021, she donated £10,000 from the proceeds to the UK-based charity Himmah to assist them with stocking the group's food bank, provide them with equipment and help the Salaam Shalom Kitchen, the only Muslim and Jewish community kitchen in the UK.[186] In March 2020, it was announced that Meghan's first post-royal project would be the narration of Disneynature's documentary Elephant, which was released on April 3.[187] In support of elephants, Disneynature and the Disney Conservation Fund would donate to Elephants Without Borders for species conservation in Botswana.[188] In June 2020, the couple backed the Stop Hate for Profit campaign and encouraged CEOs of different companies to join the movement.[189] In July 2020, she spoke in support of the Black Lives Matter movement.[190] In April 2021, the couple were announced as campaign chairs for Vax Live: The Concert to Reunite the World, an event organized by Global Citizen to increase access to COVID-19 vaccinations.[191] They also announced their support for a vaccine equity fundraiser initiated by the same organization,[192] and penned an open letter to the pharmaceutical industry CEOs urging them to address the vaccine equity crisis.[193] In July 2021, Meghan and Harry were among people who were selected by UK-based charity Population Matters to receive the Change Champions Award for their decision to have only two children and help with maintaining a smaller and more sustainable population.[194] In August 2021, to mark her 40th birthday, Meghan launched 40x40, a campaign that asks people around the world to spend 40 minutes of their time mentoring women reentering the workforce.[195] In October 2021 and ahead of the 2021 G20 Rome summit, the couple penned an open letter together with the Director-General of the World Health Organization Tedros Adhanom, asking the G20 leaders to expedite efforts for the global distribution of COVID-19 vaccines.[196] In February 2022, the couple were selected to receive NAACP's President's Award for their work on causes related to social justice and equity.[197] In the following month, they were among more than a hundred people who signed an open letter published by the People's Vaccine Alliance, asking for free global access to COVID-19 vaccines and calling out the UK, EU and Switzerland for opposing a waiver that would allow vaccine intellectual property protections to be lifted.[198] In October 2022, Meghan and Harry were named as Ripple of Hope Award laureates for their work on racial justice, mental health and other social initiatives through their foundation Archewell.[199] In April 2023, she was named as a recipient of the Ms. Foundation for Women's Women of Vision Award.[200] From January 2019 to February 2021, Meghan was patron of London's National Theatre and the Association of Commonwealth Universities.[201][202] She continued her role as the private patron of Mayhew until 2022.[203] She remains a private patron of Smart Works.[202] From March 2019 to February 2021, she was the vice president of The Queen's Commonwealth Trust.[204][202] Until February 2021, periodically, online QCT chat sessions were conducted and uploaded to YouTube for general public viewing.[205] In October 2019, along with other members of the royal family, Meghan voiced a Public Health England announcement, for the \"Every Mind Matters\" mental health program.[206] In 2019 Meghan was a contributor and guest editor for the September issue of British Vogue and highlighted the works of 15 women from different areas, who were described as \"Forces for Change\".[207] Edward Enninful, editor-in-chief of the British Vogue, later revealed that the issue had become the \"fastest-selling issue in the history of British Vogue\".[208] In the same issue, it was announced that she had collaborated with a number of British fashion houses and stores to launch a capsule collection, called The Smart Set, in September 2019 to benefit the charity Smart Works. The collection sought to help \"unemployed and disadvantaged women\", through selling items \"on a one-for-one basis, meaning an item is donated for each item purchased\".[209] Taking advantage of the \"Meghan Markle effect\" (driving consumer purchases), in 10 days the collection provided a year's worth of clothes for the charity.[210] In February 2018, Markle and fiancé Harry attended the first annual forum of The Royal Foundation.[211] After marriage, Meghan became the foundation's fourth patron alongside Prince Harry, Prince William and his wife, Catherine.[212] In May 2019, as a part of their Heads Together initiative, the Duchess of Sussex together with her husband and in-laws launched Shout, a text messaging service for those who suffer from mental issues.[213] In June 2019, it was announced that Harry and Meghan would split from the charity and establish their own foundation. Nevertheless, the couples would collaborate on mutual projects, such as the mental health initiative Heads Together.[214][215] The following month, \"Sussex Royal The Foundation of The Duke and Duchess of Sussex\" was registered in England and Wales.[216] However, it was confirmed on February 21, 2020, that \"Sussex Royal\" would not be used as a brand name for the couple, following their step back from official life as working royals.[217] On August 5, 2020, the Sussex Royal Foundation was renamed \"MWX Foundation\" and dissolved the same day.[218] In March 2021, it was reported that the Charity Commission for England and Wales was conducting a review of the Sussex Royal organization in a \"regulatory and compliance case\" regarding its conduct under charity law during dissolution.[219] Representatives for the couple claimed that Sussex Royal was \"managed by a board of trustees\" and that \"suggestion of mismanagement\" directed exclusively at the Duke and Duchess would be incorrect.[219] The commission later concluded that the foundation did not act unlawfully, but criticized the board of directors for expending a \"substantial proportion of funds\" to setting up and closing the charity.[220][221] In April 2020, Meghan and Harry confirmed that an alternative foundation (in lieu of Sussex Royal) would be called \"Archewell\".[222] The name stems from the Greek word \"arche\", which means \"source of action\"—the same word that inspired the name of their son.[222] Archewell was registered in the United States.[223] Its website was officially launched in October 2020.[224] Between 2010 and 2012, Markle anonymously ran the blog The Working Actress, which detailed the \"pitfalls and triumphs of struggling to make it in Hollywood\".[225] In 2014, she founded her own lifestyle blog The Tig, which posted articles about food, fashion, beauty, travel, and inspirational women.[226] The viewing audience consisted primarily of the fans of Markle and Suits. Promotion of the blog on other social media platforms targeted three million followers on Instagram, 800,000 on Facebook and 350,000 on Twitter.[227] In April 2017, The Tig closed. In January 2018, she took all articles offline and deleted her social media accounts.[227] It is estimated that Markle's social media activities annually earned her about $80,000 from endorsements and sponsorships.[42] She rejoined Instagram in January 2025.[228] She was also known for socializing at Soho House.[229] Markle became known through The Tig for her fashion sense,[45] releasing two fashion collections with Canadian clothing company Reitmans in 2015 and 2016.[227] The lines were based on her personal style and that of her Suits character.[45] Markle has cited Emmanuelle Alt as her style inspiration.[230][231] In 2016, she hosted USA Network's video series Power Lunch with Meghan Markle in collaboration with Lexus and Eater, discussing the culinary inspirations of five different New York kitchens.[232] In 2015, Markle visited Malta after discovering an ancestor had been born there. Her trip was documented by Elle UK.[233][234] She was featured in the cover story for the October 2017 issue of Vanity Fair and the December 2017 issue of Elle France.[235][236] Shortly after her engagement to Prince Harry in 2017, she caused a surge of interest in Scottish retailer Strathberry after carrying one of its handbags to a public event.[237][238] This was reported as an indication that her fashion choices would produce results similar to the Kate Middleton effect.[237][239] After Markle and Prince Harry's first appearance as a couple, brands Mackage, Birks, R&R Jewelers, Crown Jewelers, and Everlane noted an upswing in their website hits and sales.[240][241][238] It was speculated that Markle's effect would be broader internationally because she already had a strong American appeal.[239] Consequently, the United States saw a boost in yellow gold jewelry sales in the first quarter of 2018.[242] In 2018, Tatler included Meghan with other senior royal women on its list of Britain's best dressed people.[243] Following the announcement of her pregnancy, she appeared in a Karen Gee dress that resulted in the Australian designer's website crashing.[244] Fashion website Net-a-Porter ranked Meghan as one of the best dressed women in 2018.[245] She was nominated for the 2018 Teen Choice Awards in the category Choice Style Icon.[246] In 2019, British brand Reiss reported a growth in profits after Meghan was seen wearing a mini dress by them on International Women's Day.[247] In 2022, the black Armani dress worn by Meghan during her Oprah interview was selected by the Fashion Museum, Bath, as Dress of the Year 2021.[248] In the same year, she was featured in the cover story for the 2022 Fall Fashion issue of The Cut.[249] There was controversy over her claim in the interview that she had been told at the premiere of The Lion King that her marriage resulted in rejoicing in South Africa similar to that seen at Nelson Mandela's release from prison in 1990.[250] In 2018, Time selected Meghan as one of the 100 Most Influential People in the World[251] and placed her on its shortlist for Person of the Year.[252] Her name appeared again on the listicle in 2021, and she and her husband were featured on one of the magazine's seven worldwide covers.[253] In 2019, the magazine named Meghan and Prince Harry among the 25 Most Influential People on the Internet.[254] She was also chosen as one of the 25 most influential women in the United Kingdom by British Vogue magazine in 2018, 2019 and 2021.[255][256][257] Her influence was also recognized in both the 2019 and 2020 editions of Powerlist, the 100 most influential Britons of African and Afro-Caribbean descent.[258] In 2022, she was named as one of the 50 Women Changing the World over the past year by Worth magazine.[259] In the same year, Variety named her as a stellar honoree for its Power of Women issue,[260][261] and Financial Times included her on its list of \"25 most influential women of 2022\".[262] In December 2022, Meghan was found to be the second most disliked member of the British royal family by statistics and polling company YouGov, behind her husband's uncle Prince Andrew.[263] In March 2023, The Independent included her on its \"Influence List 2023\".[264] Meghan and Harry's exit from the royal family was satirized in a 2023 episode of South Park.[265] In the same year, James Hibberd of The Hollywood Reporter named Meghan and Harry among the Hollywood losers of 2023.[266] Following Meghan and Harry's trip to Nigeria in May 2024, Lucia Stein of the ABC argued that the couple could have been used by the royal family, and added that \"perhaps how helpful they would have been\" had an agreement on a \"hybrid working model\" been achieved.[267] Among other things, she noted Meghan's style and meetings were extensively covered internationally. Media editor, Tina Brown commented in relation to the visit, they are \"enormously appealing to the public, and very good at [public engagement].\"[267] Brown later criticized Meghan's activities arguing that she had \"the worst judgement of anyone in the entire world\" and \"her issue is that she doesn't listen... She does what she wants to do.\"[268] In November 2016, the MailOnline was criticized for running an article on Markle's family background titled \"(Almost) Straight Outta Compton\", which triggered a response from Prince Harry's Communications Secretary.[15] In October 2019, Meghan filed a lawsuit against Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL), the publisher of The Mail on Sunday and MailOnline over the publication of a letter she had sent to her father.[269][270] Thomas Markle Sr. had provided the publisher with excerpts of the letter after five of his daughter's friends, including Abigail Spencer,[271] referenced it in a People article.[4][272][273] She subsequently received support from more than 70 female MPs from different parties who in an open letter condemned the use of \"outdated, colonial undertones\" against her in some national media outlets.[274] In May 2020, the court dismissed claims of the tabloid's alleged dishonesty and malice, as they were deemed either vague or irrelevant to the case.[275] In February 2021, the High Court of Justice found in a summary judgment that ANL's Mail on Sunday had invaded Meghan's privacy by publishing the letter,[276] and she won her claim for \"misuse of private information and copyright infringement\" in May 2021.[277] She was given a £450,000 down payment on her £1.5 million legal fees as an interim payment, and pursuant to copyright law, her legal team asked for a front-page statement by The Mail on Sunday and MailOnline to acknowledge her legal victory.[278] The Court of Appeal granted ANL permission to appeal against the ruling.[279] The appeal was subsequently launched by ANL in November 2021.[280] Meghan and Harry's former communications secretary Jason Knauf—who had previously denied co-authoring the letter with Meghan[281]—gave a statement to the court of appeal, mentioning that Meghan gave him briefing points to share with Finding Freedom's authors Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand and that Prince Harry welcomed the suggestion that they should conceal their involvement, while they both discussed the book \"on a routine basis\".[282] ANL had previously applied to use the book in their defense.[283][284] Knauf also revealed that Meghan wondered whether she should refer to her father as \"daddy\" in the letter, as she believed \"in the unfortunate event that it leaked, it would pull at the heartstrings\".[282] Meghan subsequently apologized to the court for not remembering the emails earlier, adding that the \"extent of the information\" Knauf shared with the book's authors was \"unknown\" to her.[285] She also stated in her witness statement that she was \"unable to retrieve any text messages with Mr Knauf\" due to \"an automatic deletion system\" that had been installed on her devices in 2016 for security reasons.[286] In December 2021, three senior appeal judges upheld the judgement of the High Court against ANL, prompting Meghan to call for reform of the tabloid industry.[287] In the same month, ANL's The Mail on Sunday and MailOnline published a front-page statement on Boxing Day acknowledging Meghan's victory, adding that there had been an agreement on \"financial remedies\".[288] In addition to covering a portion of Meghan's legal costs, the outlet agreed to pay her £1 in damages for invading her privacy and a confidential sum for infringing her copyright.[289] They were also banned from naming Meghan's friends, who had spoken to People magazine about the letter in 2018.[289] In November 2016, The Sun ran the headline \"Harry girl's on Pornhub\".[57] The outlet denied any smear after it was revealed that the clips were illegally uploaded scenes from the TV series Suits and not pornographic material.[57] They subsequently apologized via an official statement in February 2017.[290] In February 2018, a letter containing white powder and a racist note addressing Markle was sent to St James's Palace, triggering counter-terrorism and hate crime investigations by Scotland Yard.[291] Meghan and Harry obtained a formal apology in May 2019 from Splash News for privacy invasion at their Cotswolds residence.[292][293] In December 2019, PA Media retracted the publishing of a Christmas card photograph of Meghan, Harry, and their son Archie. The agency said that the photo was retracted because they had been advised that the photograph was \"not representative of the Christmas card sent by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex\".[294] The couple had a legal warning issued to the press in general in January 2020 after the publication of paparazzi photographs.[295] In March 2020, the couple took Splash UK to court after Meghan and her son were photographed without permission in Canada during a \"private family outing\". The case was settled later that year with Splash UK agreeing to no longer take unauthorized photos of the family.[296] The Duke and Duchess announced in April that they would no longer cooperate with the Daily Mail, The Sun, Daily Mirror and Daily Express.[297] They won an apology in October from American news agency X17 for taking photographs of their son at their home using drones.[298] In March 2021, ITV News reported Meghan had complained directly to ITV's CEO about Piers Morgan's comments on mental health following her interview with Oprah Winfrey.[299] Ofcom received over 57,000 complaints about the program including one from the Duchess of Sussex.[300][301] In the same month, it was reported that an American private investigator unlawfully handed over personal details about Meghan to The Sun, including her Social Security number, cell phone number and address, when she first started dating Prince Harry in 2016. Meghan and her husband condemned the \"predatory practices\" of the British tabloids, while The Sun stated that the investigator \"was instructed clearly in writing to act lawfully\", and they did not \"use the information he provided for any unlawful practice\".[302] In July 2021, Meghan filed legal complaints against The Times for two separate articles, with the first one covering an unproven allegation from Robert Lacey's book that she had left an engagement in Fiji for not being appointed by UN Women as a goodwill ambassador and the second one claiming that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge had refused to talk to Prince Harry after Prince Philip's funeral due to fears of a potential leak.[303][304] In January 2022, the couple jointly filed a legal complaint against The Times for an article reporting on Archewell raising less than $50,000 in 2020.[305] In the same month, she complained to the BBC regarding their five-part podcast Harry, Meghan and the Media, in which the presenter Amol Rajan stated that Meghan had \"apologized for misleading\" the Court of Appeal in her case against the Mail on Sunday.[306][307] The BBC responded by issuing a statement on its \"corrections and clarifications\" website to emphasize that she had \"apologized to the court for not remembering email exchanges\".[307] In March 2022, Meghan's half-sister, Samantha Markle, filed a defamation lawsuit against her in Florida, accusing her of lying in the Oprah interview and disseminating false statements via her communications secretary for the book Finding Freedom and sought damages in excess of $75,000.[308][309] In June 2022, Meghan's initial motion to dismiss the case was rejected by a judge following amendments made by Samantha in her complaint.[310] She filed a second motion in the same month.[310][311] In addition to applying for the case to be dismissed, Meghan's lawyer also applied for the discovery process to be delayed, pending the outcome of the dismissal application.[312] A Florida judge later denied the application to halt the discovery process,[313] but dismissed the lawsuit in March 2023.[314] In April 2023, Samantha refiled the lawsuit with another amended complaint that covered statements made by Meghan in her Netflix docuseries as well.[315] The lawsuit was later dismissed with prejudice in March 2024, after a judge ruled that the claimant was unable to provide evidence of defamation.[316] Samantha later appealed the decision.[317] Between December 2022 and January 2023, more than 25,000 complaints were submitted to the Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO) about a column by Jeremy Clarkson in The Sun,[318] in which he stated that he hated Meghan \"on a cellular level\" and dreamed \"of the day when she is made to parade naked through the streets of every town in Britain while the crowds chant, 'Shame!' and throw lumps of excrement at her.\"[319] On December 20, 2022, Conservative MP Caroline Nokes wrote to The Sun's editor, Victoria Newton, calling for \"action [to be] taken\" against Clarkson. The letter was signed by more than 60 cross-party MPs.[320] On December 23, The Sun issued an apology, stating \"columnists' opinions are their own\" but they \"regret the publication of this article\" and are \"sincerely sorry\".[321] On the following day, a spokesperson for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex described the apology as \"nothing more than a PR stunt\".[322] Clarkson said his column was a reference to a scene from the television series Game of Thrones and he later revealed that he had emailed Meghan and Harry on Christmas Day 2022 to apologise.[318][323] A spokesperson for the couple said Clarkson wrote solely to Harry and the article was not an isolated incident.[318] In February 2023, IPSO announced that it was launching an investigation about the article.[324] In June 2023, IPSO concluded that the column was sexist and contained a \"pejorative and prejudicial reference\" to Meghan's sex, but it rejected complaints that the piece raised an issue of fact, or was meant to harass her or included discriminatory references on the grounds of race.[325] In 2021, shortly before Meghan and Harry were due to be interviewed by Oprah Winfrey, Valentine Low reported in The Times that Meghan's former communications secretary, Jason Knauf, complained in October 2018 that her conduct at Kensington Palace had caused two personal assistants to quit and had undermined the confidence of a third employee,[326] prompting an investigation by Buckingham Palace into the bullying allegations.[327][328] The palace hired an external law firm to examine the claims, with ten aides reported to have cooperated with the review.[329][330] Criticism of Meghan for twice wearing earrings gifted from Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in 2018, after he was accused of complicity in the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi, appeared at the same time.[331][326][332] Her representatives denied her awareness of the accusations against Mohammed bin Salman and said The Times were being used by Buckingham Palace for \"a smear campaign\" against her.[333][326] The television special Oprah with Meghan and Harry was broadcast on CBS on March 7, 2021.[334] Meghan spoke about her personal and royal life and public pressure. She claimed to have been contemplating suicide during her time as a working royal and complained of a lack of protection for her and her son while being part of the royal institution.[335] There was a wide and polarized reaction to the interview.[336] In an updated epilogue for the couple's unauthorized biography, Finding Freedom by Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand, the authors claimed that \"two of the individuals mentioned in [Knauf's] email asked for any allegations made to HR about their experiences with Meghan to be rescinded\".[337] Speaking on behalf of the Duchess in a BBC documentary, Jenny Afia, a lawyer who represented Meghan in her case against ANL, stated that the bullying allegations were \"just not true\".[338] In June 2022, The Times reported that the results from the inquiry made Buckingham Palace modify some of the policies and procedures in its HR department, but the report would not be published to ensure the privacy of those who took part in it.[339] In September 2024 The Hollywood Reporter reported on complaints raised by American staff members about Meghan's behavior. Her spokesperson declined to comment.[340] In March 2019, European consulting firm 89up reported on their discovery of 1,103 highly connected Twitter accounts with more than two and a half million tweets in favor of Meghan, most of which appeared to be bots carrying out \"coordinated attacks\" on royal correspondents who had reported negatively on her.[341][342] In the same year, CNN had reported on research by Hope not Hate, stating that out of 5,200 \"abusive tweets directed at Meghan\" in January and February 2019, 3,600 came from a small group of trolls.[341] In March 2019, the royal family introduced new rules for followers commenting on its official social media accounts in response to the online abuse aimed at Meghan and her sister-in-law Catherine.[343] In October 2021, Twitter analytics service Bot Sentinel released their analysis of more than 114,000 tweets about the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, as a result of which they found 83 accounts with a combined number of 187,631 followers that were possibly responsible for approximately 70% of the negative content posted about the couple.[344][345][346] The report prompted an investigation by Twitter.[344] The company stated that it found no evidence of \"widespread coordination\" between the accounts and said that it had taken action against users who violated Twitter's conduct policy.[344] Bot Sentinel released three more reports in the following months, arguing that the accounts were part of a \"bot network\" and a similar network could be found on YouTube.[347][348][349] In January 2022, the BBC named Meghan and Harry among people whose photos and videos were used in fake instant profits advertisements and bitcoin-related investment schemes.[350] Among theories widespread on social media, including Twitter and YouTube, were unfounded assertions that Meghan had faked her pregnancies, instead using surrogate mother(s), or that her children do not exist at all.[351][352][353] Meghan's half-sister, Samantha, was reported to have run multiple Twitter accounts that targeted Meghan.[354][355] Meghan became a princess of the United Kingdom upon her marriage to Prince Harry, entitled to the style of Royal Highness.[356] After her marriage, she was styled \"Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Sussex\". She also holds the titles of Countess of Dumbarton and Baroness Kilkeel.[357] She is the first person to hold the title \"Duchess of Sussex\".[358][359] Following the Duke and Duchess's decision to step back from royal duties in 2020, the couple agreed not to use the style of Royal Highness in practice, but they are still referred to as \"His/Her Royal Highness\" in legal settings.[360][361][362][363] During Meghan's trip to Nigeria in May 2024, Igwe Alfred Achebe, the Obi of Onitsha, and Oba Abdulrosheed Akanbi, the Oluwo of Iwo, gave her the chieftaincy titles Ada Mazi (transl. 'the daughter of the Igbo ancestral palace') and Adetokunbo (transl. 'royalty from across the seas').[131]",

                "content": "Our editors will review what you’ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article. Meghan, duchess of Sussex (born August 4, 1981, Los Angeles, California, U.S.) is an American British actress and consort (2018– ) of Prince Harry, duke of Sussex and fifth in line to the British throne. Markle was born to Doria Ragland, an African American former television studio intern who later became a social worker and yoga instructor, and her husband, Thomas Markle, a lighting director who was white; the couple met on the set of the soap opera General Hospital. Markle’s parents divorced when she was a young child, but both remained active in her life. In 1995 she had an uncredited role in the sitcom Married…with Children, for which her father served as director of lighting and of photography. After graduating from Immaculate Heart High School, an all-girls Roman Catholic school, in 1999, Markle studied theatre and international studies at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois (B.A., 2003). Markle then returned to Los Angeles to embark on an acting career. She quickly began landing guest roles in TV shows, including CSI: NY, 90210, CSI: Miami, and Fringe, and she supplemented her income working as a freelance calligrapher. Her big break came when she was cast as paralegal Rachel Zane in the popular USA Network legal drama series Suits (2011–19). She also played leading roles in such movies as Random Encounters (2013) and Anti-Social (2015). In addition, she ran a lifestyle blog, The Tig (2014–17). Markle, who had briefly been married (2011–13) to producer Trevor Engelson, was introduced to Prince Harry by a mutual friend in 2016; Harry is the younger of the two sons of Prince Charles (later Charles III) and Princess Diana; his older brother is Prince William. An early date was a camping trip to Botswana. The tabloid press quickly discovered the relationship, and its coverage of the couple was seen by many as salacious and often insulting and racist. Late in 2016 Harry made the relationship public while berating the British press for its treatment of Markle. The couple’s engagement was announced in November 2017. The wedding took place at Windsor Castle on May 19, 2018, and Meghan was given the title duchess of Sussex. Their first child, Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, was born on May 6, 2019. Though Meghan was often praised for her open and relaxed demeanour, the couple continued to be bedeviled by the tabloid press. In addition, a rift between Harry and Meghan and the other royals began to appear. In January 2020 the couple announced that they would retreat from their royal duties and planned to become financially independent of the royal family. It was later announced that they would, as of March 31, no longer be “working members” of the royal family. The couple subsequently relocated to Los Angeles, where they continued to support various charities. In addition, Meghan publicly discussed politics and personal subjects that were considered unsuitable topics for members of the royal family. Notably, in 2020 she revealed that she had experienced a miscarriage. On June 4, 2021, she gave birth to a daughter, Lilibet (“Lili”) Diana Mountbatten-Windsor; the name honoured both Harry’s mother and his grandmother Elizabeth II, whose nickname was Lilibet. Shortly thereafter Meghan released the children’s book The Bench, about a father-son relationship. In 2022 she began hosting the podcast Archetypes, which sought to “investigate the labels that try to hold women back.” In September 2022 Elizabeth II died, and Meghan and Harry were prominent at various events, including the funeral. In addition, they made a joint appearance with William and his wife, Princess Catherine, at Windsor Castle, despite an alleged rift between the brothers. Later that year the highly anticipated docuseries Harry & Meghan aired on Netflix. A candid look at their relationship, it chronicled the couple’s courtship, marriage, and decision to step back from their royal duties.

                "content": "Anthony Edwards (born August 5, 2001), nicknamed \"Ant-Man\" or simply \"Ant\",[1] is an American professional basketball player for the Minnesota Timberwolves of the National Basketball Association (NBA). A shooting guard, he played college basketball for the Georgia Bulldogs and was selected with the first overall pick by the Timberwolves in the 2020 NBA draft. He was named an All-Star during the 2022–23 and 2023–24 seasons. Edwards also won a gold medal on the 2024 U.S. Olympic team. Edwards finished his high school career at Holy Spirit Preparatory School in his hometown of Atlanta, Georgia, where he was rated a consensus five-star recruit and one of the best players in the 2019 class by major recruiting services. As a senior, he earned McDonald's All-American and USA Today All-USA first team honors. He committed to play college basketball for Georgia, becoming the highest-rated recruit to do so, and was named SEC Freshman of the Year after his freshman season with the team. Edwards spent his early life in Oakland City, Atlanta, Georgia.[2] When he was three years old, he was given the nickname \"Ant-Man\" by his father. For much of his childhood, Edwards played football in the running back, quarterback, and cornerback positions.[3] He played youth football for the Atlanta Vikings and became one of the best Pop Warner running backs in the country by age 10.[3][4][5] Edwards switched his focus to basketball because he \"thought it looked more fun\" after watching his brothers play the sport. He often played basketball with his brothers at their grandmother's house. Entering ninth grade, he began training with Justin Holland, a former college basketball player for Liberty and an Atlanta-based basketball trainer.[3] Due to his success with the Atlanta Xpress 15-under Amateur Athletic Union team, Edwards was considered a four-star recruit by Rivals in 2016.[6] He began playing high school basketball for Therrell High School in Atlanta as a member of the 2019 class.[7] In early January 2017, Edwards transferred to Holy Spirit Preparatory School in Atlanta and reclassified to the 2020 class. He made the move in an effort to improve his academic performance, since Holy Spirit Preparatory had \"small class sizes and support to help that.\"[8] In March 2018, Edwards helped Holy Spirit Preparatory defeat The Heritage School for the Georgia Independent School Association (GISA) Class AAA state championship.[9] He reclassified back to the 2019 class in November 2018 after seeing academic improvement.[7][10] As a result, Edwards rose to become the number one recruit in the Top247 rankings by recruiting website 247Sports.[11] In his senior season, his team finished as GISA Class AAA runners-up to The Heritage School, despite 27 points from Edwards.[12] At the end of the season, he was averaging 29 points, nine rebounds, and two assists per game.[13] Edwards garnered USA Today All-USA first team recognition.[13][14] He played in the McDonald's All-American Game and Jordan Brand Classic in March and April 2019, respectively.[15][16] By consensus among major recruiting services 247Sports, ESPN, and Rivals, Edwards was rated a five-star recruit, top-five player, and the top shooting guard in the 2019 class.[17][18][19] On February 11, 2019, he committed to play college basketball for Georgia, becoming the program's best recruit in the modern recruiting era.[20][21] Edwards chose the Bulldogs over offers from Florida State, Kansas, Kentucky, and North Carolina.[7] He was drawn to Georgia because two of his favorite players, Dwyane Wade and Victor Oladipo, had been coached in college by head coach Tom Crean.[22] Sources: On November 5, 2019, Edwards made his debut for the Georgia Bulldogs, recording 24 points, 9 rebounds, and 4 steals in a 91–72 win over Western Carolina. It was the most points by a Georgia freshman debutant since Basketball Hall of Fame inductee Dominique Wilkins in 1979.[23] On November 26, he scored a season-high 37 points, including 33 in the second half, and posted six rebounds, four steals, and three blocks in a 93–85 loss to third-ranked Michigan State at the Maui Invitational. Edwards became the first Georgia freshman to score at least 37 points in a game since Jacky Dorsey in 1975.[24] In his final game at the tournament, he led all scorers with 24 points and made the game-winning shot against NCAA Division II team Chaminade.[25] On February 1, 2020, Edwards recorded 29 points and 15 rebounds, both game-highs, in a 63–48 victory over Texas A&M.[26] In his next game, he led all scorers with 32 points in an 81–75 loss to Florida.[27] On February 26, Edwards scored 36 points and collected seven rebounds, four assists and four steals, in a 94–90 overtime defeat to South Carolina.[28] As a freshman, he averaged 19.1 points, 5.2 rebounds and 2.8 assists per game.[29] Edwards was the top scorer on his team and among freshmen nationally. He earned second-team All-SEC and SEC Freshman of the Year honors.[30] Edwards collected SEC Freshman of the Week accolades four times during the season, the most in program history.[31] He was also one of five finalists for the Jerry West Award, which recognizes the top collegiate shooting guard.[32] On March 20, 2020, in the spring of his freshman year, Edwards declared for the 2020 NBA draft as one of the most touted prospects in his class. He signed with an agent, forgoing his remaining college basketball eligibility.[33] The 2020 NBA draft was delayed by five months due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In November 2020, the Minnesota Timberwolves selected Edwards as the No. 1 overall pick on draft night. On December 23, 2020, he made his NBA debut, putting up 15 points, 4 rebounds, and 4 assists in 25 minutes, in a 111–101 win against the Detroit Pistons.[34] On March 18, 2021, Edwards scored a then career-high 42 points, along with 7 rebounds and 3 assists, in a game against the Phoenix Suns, becoming the third-youngest player to score 40+ points in NBA history.[35] After the season, he finished second in Rookie of the Year voting and was named to the NBA All-Rookie First Team.[36][37] On November 10, 2021, Edwards scored a then career-high 48 points on 7 three-pointers in a 123–110 loss to the Golden State Warriors.[38] On January 25, 2022, in a 109–107 win over the Portland Trail Blazers, he became the first player in NBA history to record a stat line of at least 40 points, 9 rebounds, 3 blocks, 3 steals, and 5 three-pointers in a single game; he joined Carmelo Anthony as the only players to score 40 points without an assist at 20 years old or younger.[39][40] On April 7, 2022, Edwards scored a career-high 49 points in a 127–121 win over the San Antonio Spurs.[41] In his playoff debut on April 16, 2022, he logged 36 points and 6 assists in a 130–117 Game 1 win over the Memphis Grizzlies in the opening round of the 2022 NBA playoffs.[42] Minnesota lost to Memphis despite Edwards's 30-point, 5-rebound, 5-assist, 2-steal and 2-block outing in the 114–106 close-out loss in Game 6.[43] On January 21, 2023, Edwards scored a season-high 44 points, including a season-high 8 three-pointers, along with 6 rebounds, 4 assists, 3 steals, and 3 blocks in a 113–104 win over the Houston Rockets.[44] On February 10, 2023, he was named an All-Star for the first time in his career as a reserve. Edwards and De'Aaron Fox were announced as injury replacements for injured stars Stephen Curry and Zion Williamson.[45] On April 9, in the final game of the 2022–23 season, Edwards recorded 26 points, 13 rebounds, 4 assists, 4 steals, and 4 blocks to help lead the Timberwolves to a 113–108 win over the New Orleans Pelicans, earning the eight seed in the Western Conference play-in tournament.[46] In Game 2 of the Timberwolves' first-round playoff series against the Denver Nuggets, Edwards put up 41 points in a 122–113 loss. His 41 points also set a Timberwolves franchise record for the most points scored in a playoff game, surpassing Sam Cassell's previous record of 40.[47] On April 21, in Game 3 of the first round of the playoffs, Edwards scored 36 points in a 120–111 loss. He joined Kobe Bryant with the second-most 30-point NBA playoff games before turning 22 years old.[48] In Game 4, Edwards had 34 points, 6 rebounds, 5 assists, 2 steals, and 3 blocks and scored a crucial 3-pointer to lead the Timberwolves to a 114–108 overtime win.[49] In Game 5, the Timberwolves were eliminated from the playoffs by the eventual NBA champion Nuggets despite 29 points, 8 rebounds, 7 assists, and 2 blocks by Edwards. With the Nuggets leading 112–109 in the final seconds of the game, Edwards missed a game-tying three-pointer at the buzzer.[50] Edwards changed his jersey number from #1 to #5 before the 2023–24 season.[51] On November 13, 2023, he was named the NBA Western Conference Player of the Week for the first time in his career after leading Minnesota to an undefeated week (4–0) with averages of 31.3 points, 6.3 rebounds, 6.8 assists and 2.0 steals.[52] On January 27, 2024, Edwards recorded 32 points, 6 rebounds and a career-high 12 assists in a 113–112 loss against the San Antonio Spurs.[53] On February 1, Edwards was named to his second All-Star Game as a Western Conference reserve.[54] On April 9, Edwards put up a career-high 51 points in a 130–121 win over the Washington Wizards.[55] At the season's end, Edwards was named to the All-NBA Second Team for the first time in his career.[56] In Game 4 of the first round of the playoffs against Phoenix, Edwards scored 31 of his 40 points in the second half, along with nine rebounds and six assists in a 122–116 win to close out the series. It was the Timberwolves' first playoff series win in 20 years. He also surpassed Kevin Garnett for the most 30-point playoff games in Timberwolves franchise history, with eight.[57][58] In Game 1 of the Western Conference Semifinals, Edwards scored a then playoff career-high and franchise postseason-record 43 points in a 106–99 victory over the Nuggets. He joined Kobe Bryant as the only players with consecutive 40-point games at age 22 or younger in NBA postseason history.[59] In Game 4 of the Western Conference Semifinals, Edwards scored a playoff career-high and franchise postseason-record 44 points, along with five rebounds and five assists, in a 115–107 loss to the Nuggets.[60] In Game 4 of the Western Conference Finals, Edwards posted a near triple-double with 29 points, 10 rebounds and 9 assists in a 105–100 victory over the Dallas Mavericks.[61] Minnesota would go on to lose to Dallas in five games despite Edwards 28-point, 9-rebound and 6-assist outing in a 124–103 close-out loss in Game 5.[62] Edwards was a member of the United States national team that competed in the 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup. He started all eight games and was selected in the All-FIBA World Cup Team. He was the leading scorer for the U.S., averaging 18.9 points per game. The team finished in fourth place.[63] He was named to the 2024 Olympic team.[64] He helped Team USA win the gold medal, and in six games, he averaged 12.8 points, 2.8 rebounds, 1.2 assists and 1.3 steals per game while shooting 58% from the field.[65] Edwards plays primarily as a shooting guard. He’s listed at 6’4” (1.93 meters) and weighs 225lb (102 kilograms).[66] He’s known for his explosive athleticism, often going viral for his thunderous poster dunks, including one over John Collins that the NBA named the 2023-24 Dunk of the Year.[67] The Ringer called him \"a preposterous athlete with a nice jumper and better instincts\".[68] He’s drawn comparisons to a young Michael Jordan for his ability to finish around the rim. “They have a lot of the same mannerisms. The moves, the fadeaway, the athleticism, the poster dunks… that same kind of work ethic, that same kind of ‘I don’t sleep at all at night because I’m ready to play, I’m ready to hoop,” according to teammate Mike Conley.[69] Despite pre-draft concerns that he was a limited long-range scorer, Edwards has developed an efficient, high-volume three-point shot — shooting 36% on almost eight attempts per game.[66] In 2024, he became the youngest player in NBA history to make 800 threes.[70] His stout frame, lateral speed and competitiveness have helped transform his reputation on the defensive end — Team USA coach Steve Kerr called his on-ball defense “amazing” during the FIBA World Cup.[71] His ability to match up against both long wings and shifty guards has garnered praise from Timberwolves head coach Chris Finch. Edwards himself believes his defense is “overlooked” by the national media.[72] Edwards's daughter, Aislynn, was born March 2024.[74] Edwards left the Timberwolves’ March 1 game against the Sacramento Kings at halftime to be with Aislynn's mother, Shannon, as their child was born. Edwards's mother, Yvette, and grandmother, Shirley, both died of cancer during an eight-month span in 2015, when he was in eighth grade. He has worn the No. 5 basketball jersey since high school to honor them, as they both died on the fifth day of the month.[75] After their deaths, Edwards was raised by his sister, Antoinette, and brother, Antoine, who shared legal custody of him.[76] In high school, Edwards frequently worked as an instructor at youth camps.[77] He intended to major in marketing while attending the University of Georgia.[78] During his childhood, Edwards also starred in baseball, often acting as his team's fourth or fifth hitter in the batting order. He has jokingly said he was very skilled at a variety of sports when he was younger. He owns two dogs and has also expressed his affinity for lions, although he does not believe he has the requisite space to care for one.[79] Edwards made his acting debut in the 2022 sports drama film Hustle.[80] In September 2022, Edwards posted a video to Instagram story referring to a group of shirtless men standing on a sidewalk with a homophobic slur.[81] The NBA fined him $40,000 for using \"offensive and derogatory language.\"[82] In December 2023, Paige Jordae, an Instagram model, accused Edwards of impregnating her and then offering her $100,000 to get an abortion.[83] Jordae posted screenshots of text messages with Edwards.[84] The screenshots, which were initially posted to Jordae's Instagram story, also included a screenshot of a pending wire transfer of $100,000 on November 27, 2023.[85] Edwards responded, \"I am handling my personal matters privately and will not be commenting on them any further at this time.\"[86]",

                "content": "Anthony Charles Edwards (born July 19, 1962)[2] is an American actor, director, and producer.[3][4] He played Dr. Mark Greene on the first eight seasons of ER, for which he received a Golden Globe Award and six Screen Actors Guild Awards, and was nominated for four consecutive Primetime Emmy Awards. He has appeared in various films and television series, including Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Top Gun, Zodiac, Gotcha!, Miracle Mile, Revenge of the Nerds, Planes, Northern Exposure, and Designated Survivor. Edwards was born in Santa Barbara, California, the son of Erika Kem Edwards Plack (née Weber), an artist/landscape painter, and Peter Edwards, an architect to whom he was one of five children[5][6] His maternal grandfather was designer Kem Weber. He is partly of German and Irish descent. He received a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts in England and studied theatre at the University of Southern California.[7] Edward's early film appearances included roles in Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982), Revenge of the Nerds (1984), Gotcha! (1985) and The Sure Thing (1985). It was Edwards's role as LTJG Nick \"Goose\" Bradshaw alongside Tom Cruise in the 1986 film Top Gun that brought his first widespread public acknowledgement.[8] His character, who died in an aviation accident, was among the most prominent and popular in the film. Scenes with him and his film family (played by Meg Ryan and Aaron and Adam Weis) were later reprised as flashbacks in the 2022 sequel Top Gun: Maverick. Edwards's roles following Top Gun included Revenge of the Nerds II: Nerds in Paradise (1987), Miracle Mile (1988), Downtown (1990), Pet Sematary Two (1992) and The Client (1994). He also had a recurring role on the TV series Northern Exposure from 1992 to 1993. His best-known role is as Dr. Mark Greene on the long-running TV series ER, from the series premiere in 1994 to the end of the eighth season in 2002. The series also afforded Edwards his first opportunity to direct. Edwards's desire to pursue directing led to his request to be written out of the series. He reportedly earned $35 million for three seasons on ER, which made him one of television's highest-paid actors.[9] Edwards received four Primetime Emmy Award nominations for ER. He won a Golden Globe Award For Best Performance by an Actor-In a TV Series after being nominated four times and he has two Screen Actor's Guild Awards.[10] In 2008, Edwards returned to ER to reprise his role as Dr. Greene (in flashback scenes, where he treats the dying son of character Catherine Banfield) for one episode during its 15th and final season.[11] Following ER, he took some time to raise his children, appreciating the privilege that his ER salary provided.[12] His film appearances following ER included the science fiction film Thunderbirds (2004), the psychological thriller film The Forgotten (2004) and the crime thriller film Zodiac (2007). In 2010, Edwards appeared in the movie Motherhood, which set a record for the biggest bomb in British cinema history by garnering £88 on 11 tickets on opening weekend.[13] Motherhood did not fare much better in the United States, earning $93,388 in three weeks of release.[14] At the time, he said he took the role because \"it seemed like a very organic and real thing. It really kind of reminded me of what the dynamic in a family is like.\"[15] Edwards reunited with Val Kilmer, another actor from Top Gun, when he voiced one of the fighter jets in the Disneytoon Studios film Planes (2013).[16] In 2018, Edwards was cast in the recurring role in the third season of Netflix's Designated Survivor as Mars Harper, the President's Chief of Staff.[17] In 2020, he served as an executive producer of the film adaptation of Martin Moran's The Tricky Part.[4] In 2022, Edwards was cast as Alan Reed in Netflix's docu-series Inventing Anna.[1] Edwards received four Emmy nominations for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series for ER and won as an executive producer on Outstanding Television Movie winner Temple Grandin. He earned a People's Choice Award for Favorite Male Performer in a New Television Series (1995);[11] and won six Screen Actors Guild Awards for: Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Drama Series (1996 and 1998), and Best Ensemble Cast (1996, 1997, 1998 and 1999). He won the Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Drama in 1998).[11] Edwards also won a Daytime Emmy for the production of the underground rock documentary N.Y.H.C. (1999) and the telepic adaptation of Kimberly Willis Holt's 1998 coming of age novel My Louisiana Sky (2001),[18] and earned the Carnegie Medal Award for My Louisiana Sky (2003).[18] After a long career in television, Edwards made his Broadway debut as his second act in 2018 in the revival of Children of a Lesser God at Studio 54.[10][12][19] In 2015 he appeared in Classic Stage Company's A Month in the Country but his stage acting career began when he was growing up in Santa Barbara.[20][21] On May 13, 2022, Edwards made his unexpected Broadway musical debut when he appeared as Dr. Walker in the Broadway production of Girl from the North Country due to COVID-19 cases impacting the cast. The show also stars his wife, Mare Winningham.[22][23] Edwards is slated to appear in the 2024 Broadway production of Prayer for the French Republic by Joshua Harmon.[24] Edwards was married to Jeanine Lobell from 1994 to 2015. They have one son and three daughters.[1][20] At the end of 2021, Edwards and longtime friend and fellow actor Mare Winningham eloped.[1][25][26] On November 10, 2017, Edwards wrote an essay on Medium, in which he stated that producer and screenwriter Gary Goddard had befriended and for years sexually assaulted him and his friends, beginning when they were 12 years old.[27][28] Edwards has been a licensed private pilot since 2012.[29]",

        "FCC net neutrality rules": [
            {
                "title": "Net Neutrality | Federal Communications Commission",
                "content": "An official website of the United States government Here’s how you know Official websites use .govA .gov website belongs to an official government organization in the United States. Secure .gov websites use HTTPSA lock ( Lock Locked padlock icon ) or https:// means you’ve safely connected to the .gov website. Share sensitive information only on official, secure websites. What is Net Neutrality? Net Neutrality policies are a national standard by which we ensure that broadband internet service is treated as an essential service. It prohibits internet service providers from blocking, throttling, or engaging in paid prioritization of lawful content. By classifying broadband service as a “telecommunications” service under Title II of the law, the FCC restores its oversight of internet service outages, national security threats in broadband networks, and consumer protection and regains key tools to promote broadband deployment. The Way Forward FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel is working to restore Net Neutrality as the national standard for broadband reliability, security, and consumer protection. The Chairwoman’s proposal would ensure that broadband services are treated as an essential resource deserving of FCC oversight under Title II authority. BROADBAND IS AN ESSENTIAL SERVICE While internet access has long been important to daily life, the COVID-19 pandemic and the rapid shift of work, education, and health care online demonstrated how essential broadband internet connections are for consumers’ participation in our society and economy. But even as our society has reconfigured itself to do so much online, our institutions have fallen behind. When Net Neutrality protections are not in place, there is no expert agency ensuring that the internet is fast, open, and fair. Since the birth of the modern internet in the 1990s, the Commission had played that role. OVERSIGHT OF OUTAGES When households and businesses lose internet service, they logically expect that the FCC might be able to help the restoration or at least have information about the outage. By restoring the FCC’s Title II authority over internet service providers, the FCC bolsters its authority to require these companies to address internet outages. Without such authority, the FCC cannot require companies to even report broadband outages, cannot collect outage data, and lacks the authority to consider ways that it can help protect against and recover from internet service outages. NATIONAL STANDARD The FCC would once again prevent broadband providers from blocking, slowing down, or creating pay-to-play internet fast lanes. NATIONAL SECURITY OF BROADBAND NETWORKS In this digital age, there are digital threats. Without broadband oversight, the FCC is unable to monitor and respond to such national security issues. For example, without reclassification, the FCC is limited in its authority to direct foreign-owned companies deemed to be national security threats to discontinue any domestic or international broadband services under Sec. 214 – as they have done with telephone services. In addition, without reclassification, the FCC has limited authority to incorporate updated cybersecurity standards into network policies. CONSUMER PROTECTION Net Neutrality protections would increase the tools the FCC has available to protect consumer data and respond to evolving consumer threats. Broadband providers could not sell your location data, among other sensitive information. And the FCC will be empowered to protect consumers from other harmful practices. “In the wake of the pandemic and the generational investment in internet access, we have a window to update our policies to make sure that the internet is not only open, but fast and fair, safe and secure. I am committed to seizing this opportunity. Now is the time for our rules of the road for internet service providers to reflect the reality that internet access is a necessity for daily life. Let’s get to it.” – FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel What Is ‘Title II’ Authority Title II is the part of the Communications Act that gives the FCC clear authority to serve as a watchdog over the communications marketplace and look out for the public interest. Title II took on special importance in the Net Neutrality debate because the courts have ruled that the FCC has clear authority to enforce open internet policies if broadband internet is classified as a Title II “telecommunications” service.

                "title": "Net neutrality in the United States - Wikipedia",
                "content": "In the United States, net neutrality—the principle that Internet service providers (ISPs) should make no distinctions between different kinds of content on the Internet, and to not discriminate based on such distinctions—has been an issue of contention between end-users and ISPs since the 1990s.[1][2][3] With net neutrality, ISPs may not intentionally block, slow down, or charge different rates for specific online content.[4] Without net neutrality, ISPs may prioritize certain types of traffic, meter others, or potentially block specific types of content, while charging consumers different rates for that content.[5] A core issue to net neutrality is how ISPs should be classified under the Communications Act of 1934 as amended by the Telecommunications Act of 1996: as either Title I \"information services\" or Title II \"common carrier services\". The classification determines the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) authority over ISPs: the FCC would have significant ability to regulate ISPs if classified as common carriers, but would have little control over them if classified as information services. Because the Communications Act has not been amended by Congress to account for ISPs, the FCC had taken the authority to designate how ISPs are classified, as affirmed by the Supreme Court in the case National Cable & Telecommunications Ass'n v. Brand X Internet Services (2005), in addition to choosing what regulations to set on common carriers. The five member FCC commission changes with each new administration, and no more than three members may be of the same political party, thus the FCC's attitudes and rule-making regarding net neutrality shifts relatively frequently through the 2020's. Prior FCC decisions on net neutrality had been upheld due to the Chevron deference principle, where the courts gave preference to administrative agencies' interpretation of applicable law. The Supreme Court case Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo (2024) overturned the Chevron deference, and as a result, the Sixth Circuit ruled in 2025 that the FCC does not have the authority to classify ISPs as Title II services. As such, there is no current federal regulations requiring net neutrality, though some states are implementing their own versions of it. The ideas underlying net neutrality have a long pedigree in telecommunications practice and regulation. Services such as telegrams and the phone network (officially, the public switched telephone network or PSTN) have been considered common carriers under U.S. law since the Mann–Elkins Act of 1910, which means that they have been akin to public utilities and expressly forbidden to give preferential treatment. The Communications Act of 1934 created the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to regulate the industry and ensure fair pricing and access.[6] Different titles of the Act covered different modes of communication, but primary focus on the debate of net neutrality has been on Titles I and II. The Act distinguished between common carriers, who were bound under Title II of the Act, and other telecommunication systems of the time, covered broadly under Title I. Within Title II, common carriers such as the phone networks were to be regulated by the FCC as to assure reasonable pricing rates and non-discriminatory practices. Systems under Title I were left to be unregulated by the FCC. In the late 1980s the Internet became legally available for commercial use, and in the early years of public use of the Internet, this was its main use – public access was limited and largely reached through dial-up modems (as was the Bulletin board system dial-up culture that preceded it). The Internet was viewed more as a commercial service than a domestic and societal system. However, by the late 1990s and early 2000s, the Internet started to become common in households and wider society. Also in the 1980s, arguments about the public interest requirements of the telecommunications industry in the U.S. arose; whether companies involved in broadcasting were best viewed as community trustees, with obligations to society and consumers, or mere market participants with obligations only to their shareholders.[7] The legal debate about net neutrality regulations of the 2000s echoes this debate. By the 1990s, some U.S. politicians began to express concern over protecting the Internet: How can government ensure that the nascent Internet will permit everyone to be able to compete with everyone else for the opportunity to provide any service to all willing customers? Next, how can we ensure that this new marketplace reaches the entire nation? And then how can we ensure that it fulfills the enormous promise of education, economic growth, and job creation? The Communications Act of 1934 was amended with the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which besides other provisions, defined \"information services\" as \"the offering of a capability for generating, acquiring, storing, transforming, processing, retrieving, utilizing, or making available information via telecommunications\", and covered only under Title I unregulated by the FCC.[9] In the early 2000s, legal scholars such as Tim Wu and Lawrence Lessig raised the issue of neutrality in a series of academic papers addressing regulatory frameworks for packet networks. Wu is credited with introducing the term \"network neutrality\" in his 2003 paper \"Network Neutrality, Broadband Discrimination\".[10] Wu had found based on behaviors of broadband providers in the early 2000s that there could be potential for commercial interests to interfere with natural evolution of new innovations on the Internet, such as those using higher bandwidth like voice and video applications. Wu outlined the benefits and drawbacks of governmental regulation for net neutrality, writing \"Communications regulators over the next decade will spend increasing time on conflicts between the private interests of broadband providers and the public’s interest in a competitive innovation environment centered on the Internet.\"[11] Papers from Wu and others in the early 2000s sparked debate among academics in information technology and legal areas to device possible frameworks for net neutrality that could be applied within U.S. laws; these discussions paralleled similar concurrent ones in Europe, though due to its different governmental structure, took on different forms of implementation. Within the U.S., media and politicians learned of these regulatory suggestions, leading to the start of net neutrality principles within the government.[12][13] In the wake of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the introduction of \"information services\" under Title I prompted many cable-based Internet access providers to urge the FCC to classify their services as Title I information services, rather than as cable providers under the Act's Title III which required them to provide open access to other service provides. The FCC took in comments, and after providing its initial findings in 2002, issued \"Inquiry Concerning High-Speed Access to the Internet over Cable and Other Facilities\" in which it had determined that cable ISPs were neither a telecommunications provider (under Title II) nor a cable provider (under Title III) but were solely an information service that fell under Title I and thus could operate unregulated by the FCC.[14] Several non-cable ISPs and other industry groups sued the FCC, challenging this ruling in multiple courts. The cases were consolidated to the Ninth Circuit. In May 2003, the Ninth Circuit vacated the FCC's ruling, stating that cable ISPs had a telecommunications function and thus should be regulated under Title II. The National Cable & Telecommunications Association challenged the ruling, and while the Ninth Circuit refused to rehear the case en banc, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case. The Court announced its judgment in June 2005. The 6–3 decision reversed the Ninth Circuit's ruling, deeming that the FCC had properly defined cable ISPs as an information service. The majority opinion relied on the Chevron deference, a principle that the judicial body gives deference to an executive agency's interpretation of legislation outlining its granted powers as long as that interpretation is reasonable and consistent.[15] While the ruling was unfavorable for proponents of net neutrality, Brand X established that the FCC had powers to classify Internet services subject to their interpretation, which has played a key role in how net neutrality has since played out in the United States with changing administrations.[16] The majority opinion in Brand X was authored by Justice Clarence Thomas, who has subsequently stated that he regrets the decision, in his dissent to Baldwin v. United States.[17] In February 2004, then Federal Communications Commission Chairman Michael Powell announced a set of non-discrimination principles, which he called the principles of \"Preserving Network Freedom\", based on studies from Tim Wu and Phil Weiser and other academics from the previous years. Powell recognized that it was still early to have a clear picture of what government regulation should be for net neutrality, but agreed that based on practices of broadband operators of the past few years, it was necessary to establish what rights consumers should expect from broadband service. In a speech at the Silicon Flatirons Symposium, Powell encouraged ISPs to offer users these four freedoms:[18] In early 2005, in the Madison River case, the FCC for the first time showed the willingness to enforce its network neutrality principles by opening an investigation about Madison River Communications, a local telephone carrier that was blocking Vonage's voice over IP (VoIP) service in its digital subscriber line (DSL) offering to customers. At the time, while the FCC classified cable providers under Title I as an information provider (as per the Brand X case) and were unregulated, services such as DSL were still considered under Title II as a common carrier, and were bound by non-discriminatory regulation from the FCC.[19] Nevertheless, the FCC's investigation led to a settlement between the FCC and Madison River Communications before any further litigation occurred, with Madison River agreeing to stop blocking VoIP traffic and paying a $15,000 fine.[20] While the action did not set any precedent for the FCC's stance on net neutrality, the Madison River case was an indication the agency was willing to uphold Powell's principles.[21] Shortly after the case was settled, the FCC issued a new rule in 2005 to reclassified DSL as a Title I information service and allowing them to operate unregulated by the FCC.[22][19] In 2004, the court case USTA v. FCC voided the FCC's authority to enforce rules requiring telephone operators to unbundle certain parts of their networks at regulated prices. This caused the economic collapse of many competitive local exchange carriers (CLEC).[23] In the United States, broadband services were historically regulated differently according to the technology by which they were carried. While cable Internet has always been classified by the FCC as an information service free of most regulation, DSL was regulated as a telecommunications service. In 2005, the FCC reclassified Internet access across the phone network, including DSL, as \"information service\" relaxing the common carrier regulations and unbundling requirement.[24] During the FCC's hearing, the National Cable & Telecommunications Association urged the FCC to adopt the four criteria laid out in its 2005 Internet Policy Statement as the requisite openness. This made up a voluntary set of four net neutrality principles.[25] Implementation of the principles was not mandatory; that would require an FCC rule or federal law.[26] The modified principles were as follows:[27][28] In December 2006, the AT&T/Bell South merger agreement defined net neutrality as an agreement on the part of the broadband provider: \"not to provide or to sell to Internet content, application or service providers ... any service that privileges, degrades or prioritizes any (data) packet transmitted over AT&T/BellSouth's wireline broadband Internet access service based on its source, ownership or destination.\"[29] In 2007, Comcast, the largest cable company in the US, was found to be blocking or severely delaying BitTorrent uploads on their network using a technique which involved creating 'reset' packets (TCP RST) that appeared to come from the other party.[30] An August 2007 report by TorrentFreak (based on substantial nationwide research led by chief researcher Andrew Norton) noted that ISPs had been throttling BitTorrent traffic for almost two years, since 2005, but Comcast was completely blocking it in at least some cases.[31] This was later verified by both the EFF[32] and Associated Press.[33] On March 27, 2008, Comcast and BitTorrent reached an agreement to work together on network traffic where Comcast was to adopt a protocol-neutral stance \"as soon as the end of [2008]\", and explore ways to \"more effectively manage traffic on its network at peak times.\"[34] In December 2009, Comcast reached an out-of-court settlement of a class action lawsuit for US$16 million, admitting no wrongdoing[35] and amounting to no more than US$16 per affected account.[36] In August 2008, the FCC made its first Internet network management decision.[37] It voted 3-to-2 to uphold a complaint against Comcast ruling that it had illegally inhibited users of its high-speed Internet service from using file-sharing software because it throttled the bandwidth available to certain customers for video files to ensure that other customers had adequate bandwidth.[38][39] The FCC imposed no fine, but required Comcast to end such blocking in the year 2008, ordered Comcast to disclose the details of its network management practices within 30 days, submit a compliance plan for ending the offending practices by the end of the year, and disclose to the public the details of intended future practices. Then-FCC chairman Kevin J. Martin said the order was meant to set a precedent, that Internet providers and all communications companies could not prevent customers from using their networks the way they see fit, unless there is a good reason. In an interview Martin stated that \"We are preserving the open character of the Internet\" and \"We are saying that network operators can't block people from getting access to any content and any applications.\"[40] In two rulings, in April and June 2010 respectively, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled against the FCC; the April ruling denied to grant the FCC's request for a cease-and-desist order against Comcast related to BitTorrent transfers, while the June ruling vacated the FCC's order against Comcast. The U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that the FCC has no powers to regulate any Internet provider's network, or the management of its practices: \"[the FCC] 'has failed to tie its assertion' of regulatory authority to an actual law enacted by Congress\",[41][42] and that the FCC lacked the authority under Title I to force ISPs to keep their networks open, while employing reasonable network management practices, to all forms of legal content.[43] In wake of the rulings, the FCC stated it would continue its fight for net neutrality.[44] In February 2008, Kevin Martin, then Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, said that he is \"ready, willing and able,\" to prevent broadband ISPs from unreasonably interfering with their subscribers' access to content on the internet.[45] In 2008, when the FCC auctioned off the 700 MHz block of wireless spectrum in anticipation of the DTV transition, Google promised to enter a bid of $4.6 billion, if the FCC required the winning licensee to adhere to four conditions:[46] These conditions were broadly similar to the FCC's Internet Policy Statement; FCC's applications and content were combined into a single bullet, and an extra bullet requiring wholesale access for third party providers was included. The FCC adopted only two of these four criteria for the auction, viz., open devices and open applications, and only applied these conditions to the nationwide C block portion of the band.[47] President Barack Obama's American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 called for an investment of $7.2 billion in broadband infrastructure and included an openness stipulation.[48] Towards the end of 2009, the FCC began drafting new rules that would include a series of proposals that would prevent telecommunications, cable and wireless companies from blocking certain information on the Internet.[49] FCC Chair Julius Genachowski proposed to add two rules to the current FCC policy statement in 2005, viz., the nondiscrimination principle that ISPs must not discriminate against any content or applications, and the transparency principle, requiring that ISPs disclose all their policies to customers. He argued that wireless should be subject to the same network neutrality as wireline providers.[50] In October 2009, the FCC gave notice of proposed rule making on net neutrality.[51] Following the ruling in Comcast v. FCC in March 2010, the FCC amended these rules to account for the court's decision. The FCC voted in December 2010 to approve the FCC Open Internet Order banning cable television and telephone service providers from preventing access to competitors or certain web sites. The order established six net \"neutrality principles\" that would apply to ISPs: The 2010 orders did not reclassify ISPs under Title II common carriers, leaving them unregulated by the FCC under Title I information services as a cumulative result of past FCC orders.[52] The measure was denounced by net neutrality advocates as a capitulation to telecommunication companies such as allowing them to discriminate on transmission speed for their profit, especially on mobile devices like the iPad, while pro-business advocates complained about any regulation of the Internet at all.[53][54][55] While the 2010 Open Internet Order was generally favorable to ISPs, the issuing of the neutrality principles that would still apply to Title I information services was criticized by some ISPs. Verizon Communications challenged the order at the D.C. Circuit court in early 2011, asserting that the FCC had overstepped its authority by applying principles to Title I information services. The D.C. Circuit ruled in January 2014 to vacate the blocking and discrimination principles from the 2010 Open Internet Order while upholding other parts. The decision determined that the FCC improperly relied on Section 706 of the amended Communications Act, which gives the FCC authority to incentivize the deployment of telecommunications services to all Americans including those in rural and low-income areas. The FCC had relied on Section 706's language that they had authority to \"promulgate rules governing broadband providers’ treatment of Internet traffic\" to apply these rules to Title I information services. The Court ruled that ISPs were still specifically treated as Title I information services by the FCC, and for the FCC to be able to regulate aspects like blocking or discrimination, they would specifically have to be cataloged as telecommunication common carriers under Title II. The court agreed that FCC can regulate broadband in a general manner and may craft more specific rules that stop short of identifying service providers as common carriers.[56][57][58] As a response to the DC Circuit Court's decision, a dispute developed as to whether net neutrality could be guaranteed under existing law, or if reclassification of ISPs was needed to ensure net neutrality.[59] Wheeler stated that the FCC had the authority under Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 to regulate ISPs, while others, including President Obama,[60] supported reclassifying ISPs as common carriers under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934. Critics of Section 706 point out that the section has no clear mandate to guarantee equal access to content provided over the internet, while subsection 202(a) of the Communications Act states that common carriers cannot \"make any unjust or unreasonable discrimination in charges, practices, classifications, regulations, facilities, or services.\" Advocates of net neutrality have generally supported reclassifying ISPs under Title II, while FCC leadership and ISPs have generally opposed such reclassification. The FCC stated that if they reclassified ISPs as common carriers, the commission would selectively enforce Title II, so that only sections relating to broadband would apply to ISPs.[59] On February 19, 2014, the FCC announced plans to formulate new rules to resume enforcing net neutrality while complying with the court rulings.[62] However, in the event, on April 23, 2014, the FCC reported a new draft rule that would permit broadband ISPs such as Comcast and Verizon to offer content providers, such as Netflix, Disney, or Google, willing to pay a higher price, faster connection speeds, so their customers would have preferential access, thus reversing its earlier position and (so far as opinion outside the ISP sector generally agreed) would deny net neutrality.[63][64][65][66][67] Public response was heated, pointing out FCC chairman Tom Wheeler's past as a president and CEO of two major ISP-related organizations, and the suspicion of bias towards the profit-motives of ISPs as a result. Shortly afterwards, during late April 2014, the contours of a document leaked that indicated that the FCC under Wheeler would consider promulgating rules allowing Internet service providers (ISPs) to violate net neutrality principles by making it easier for Internet users to access certain content — whose owners paid fees to the ISPs (including cable companies and wireless ISPs) — and harder to access other content,[68] thus undermining the traditional open architecture of the Internet. These plans received substantial backlash from activists, the mainstream press, and some other FCC commissioners.[69][70] In May 2014, over 100 Internet companies — including Google, Microsoft, eBay, and Facebook — signed a letter to Wheeler voicing their disagreement with his plans, saying they represented a \"grave threat to the Internet\".[71] The FCC voted 3–2 on proposed rules to introduced tiered broadband allowances on May 15, 2014.[72] Besides opening these rules to public comment prior to issuing a final ruling, the FCC asked the public on their opinion in regards to classifying ISPs as Title II common carrier telecommunication services. The public commenting period ran through July 2014,[73][74] and garnering over one million responses, the most the FCC had ever received for rulemaking.[75] The FCC proposal for a tiered Internet received heavy criticism. Opponents argued that a user accessing content over the \"fast lane\" on the Internet would find the \"slow lane\" intolerable in comparison, greatly disadvantaging any content provider who is unable to pay for \"fast lane\" access. They argued that a tiered Internet would suppress new Internet innovations by increasing the barrier to entry. Video providers Netflix[76] and Vimeo[77] in their comments filed with the FCC used the research of S.S. Krishnan and Ramesh Sitaraman that provided quantitative evidence of the impact of Internet speed on online video users.[61] Their research studied the patience level of millions of Internet video users who waited for a slow-loading video to start playing. Users with faster Internet connectivity, such as fiber-to-the-home, demonstrated less patience and abandoned their videos sooner than similar users with slower Internet connectivity.[78][79][80] Opponents of the tiered broadband rules declared September 10, 2014, to be the \"Internet slowdown\". Participating websites were purposely slowed down to show what they felt would happen if the new rules took effect. Websites that participated in the Internet slowdown included Netflix,[81] Reddit, Tumblr, Twitter, Vimeo and Kickstarter.[82][83][84][85] The Economist described the \"Battle for the Net [...] now casting the upcoming FCC decision as an epic clash between \"Team Internet\" (a plucky band of high-tech multi-millionaires) and \"Team Cable\" (a dastardly bunch of Big-ISP billionaires).\"[86] On November 10, 2014, President Obama stepped in, and recommended the FCC reclassify broadband Internet service as a telecommunications service in order to preserve net neutrality.[87][88][89] Republicans presented legislation in January 2015 in the form of a U. S. Congress HR discussion draft bill that made concessions to net neutrality but prohibited the FCC from accomplishing that goal, or from enacting any further regulation affecting ISPs, though the bill failed to be enacted.[90][91] By January 2015, the FCC announced it had revised its prior rules and would be voting on a new preliminary ruling that defined ISPs as a Title II common carrier telecommunication service, with some necessary exemptions.[92][93][94][95][96] Adoption of this notion would reclassify Internet service from one of information to one of telecommunications,[97] treating it as a public good,[98][99] and ensure net neutrality, according to Wheeler.[100][101] Ahead of the FCC's vote on these new rules, social media platforms had a large role on engaging the public in the debate surrounding net neutrality. Popular websites such as Tumblr, Vimeo, and Reddit also participated in the Internet slowdown on September 10, 2014, which the organization said was the largest sustained (lasting more than a single day) online protest effort in history.[102] On January 26, 2015, popular blogging site Tumblr placed links to group Fight For The Future, a net neutrality advocacy group. The website displayed a countdown to the FCC vote on Title II on February 26, 2015. This was part of a widespread Internet campaign to sway congressional opinion and encourage users to call or submit comments to congressional representatives.[103] Net neutrality advocacy groups such as Save the Internet coalition[104] and Battle for the Net[105] responded to the 2015 FCC ruling by calling for defense of the new net neutrality rules.[104] The FCC voted 3–2 on February 25, 2015, to pass these new rules,[106][107][108][98][99] making exemptions for North Carolina and Tennessee where state laws had already established stronger net neutrality concepts, and would be willing to add exemptions for other states with similar laws.[109] In response to ISP and opponent views, Wheeler commented, \"This is no more a plan to regulate the Internet than the First Amendment is a plan to regulate free speech. They both stand for the same concept.\"[110] Full disclosure of the rules were released for public comment on March 12, 2015,[111][112][113] and the final rule was published on April 13, 2015.[114][115] Following the publication of the FCC's ruling in 2015, several internet providers filed suit to challenge the FCC's ruling. The cases were combined into a single case, United States Telecom Ass'n v. FCC 825 F.3d 674 (2016), heard by a three-judge panel on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in December 2015.[116] The court issued its decision in June 2016, with the panel split 2-1 in favor of maintaining the FCC's ruling, stating that the Internet should be treated as a utility and not as a luxury. Internet providers signaled their intent to continue to challenge this ruling to the Supreme Court.[117] Several of the telecom groups petitioned the Supreme Court for writ of certiorari following the Court of Appeals ruling, ultimately falling under the case name Berninger v. Federal Communications Commission (Docket 17-489). The petition argued that the FCC did not have the power to issue the Open Internet Order, which required a re-interpretation of the Communications Act of 1934, under the Chevron deference. On November 5, 2018, seven members of the Court denied the petition, leaving in place the Court of Appeals ruling, which established that the FCC had the ability to reclassify Internet under Title II. Chief Justice John Roberts abstained due to financial conflict, and Justice Brett Kavanaugh abstained due to his previous involvement with the case history. Three Justices, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Neil Gorsuch had recommended accepting the petition as to order a Munsingwear vacatur, in which the Appeals Court order would have been vacated, returned to that court, and have the case rendered moot due to the more recent 2018 FCC order that reversed the Open Internet Order.[118][119] Donald Trump had been positioning himself for running for presidency as the FCC considered net neutrality and categorizing ISPs as Title II common carriers. He said in 2014, \"Obama’s attack on the internet is another top down power grab. Net neutrality is the Fairness Doctrine. Will target conservative media.\"[120][121] Shortly after his inauguration in January 2017, President Trump appointed Ajit Pai as the new chairman of the FCC. Pai had previously been nominated to fill one of the required Republican seats on the commission by President Obama under the recommendation of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.[122] Pai, who objected to the 2015 Open Internet Order, quickly began to roll back some of the policies that had been implemented by the FCC during the Obama administration, and halted an investigation into the use of zero-rating by U.S. wireless providers. After his appointment, Pai stated that he planned to \"modernize\" FCC policies to \"match the reality of the modern marketplace\", but was unsure over whether the FCC would continue to enforce the net neutrality rules or Title II classification of broadband services established in the 2015 Open Internet Order.[123][124] Pai stated his opposition to the current net neutrality rules as they were \"regulating against hypothetical harms\", rather than trying to correct actual anti-competitive behavior, and that there was no need for such wide-spread government intervention when there were only a few companies that may be harming consumers or innovators.[125] Pai argued that net neutrality rules also would \"prohibit a number of pro-competitive business arrangements\" and \"would reduce investments\" into extending the Internet infrastructure.[125] By April 2017, Pai had indicated that the FCC would likely propose to roll back the 2015 Open Internet Order, reverting the classification of ISPs as Title II common carriers, and instead have ISPs to \"voluntarily\" commit to net neutrality principles, with violations to be covered by the Federal Trade Commission rather than the FCC.[126][127] On April 29, 2017, a clearer understanding of the latest net neutrality compromise proposal was described.[128][129] On May 18, 2017, the FCC voted 2–1 to move forward with Pai's Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) on \"Restoring Internet freedom\" rules[130] by rolling back net neutrality regulations.[131] The new rules were published for public viewing on July 17, 2017.[132] The FCC supported their rules by arguing that the classification of ISPs as Title II carriers had caused them to reduce their capital expenditures in new infrastructure, threatening the future of the nation's telecommunication systems. The FCC cited a drop of approximately $1 billion in capital spending by telecoms between 2014 and 2015, based on data from the United States Telecom Association and similar figures from industry consultant Hal Singer,[133] to demonstrate this. Analysts stated that the FCC had cherry picked this data, as about 75% of the annual changes in capital spending by telecoms between the period of 1996 to 2015 were decreases of at least $1 billion.[134][135] In her dissent to this NPRM, FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn wrote, \"I have yet to see a credible analysis that suggests that broadband provider capital expenditures have declined as a result of our 2015 Open Internet Order. ... Using the same logic that the NPRM uses, one could suggest that the FCC's classification of cable modem service as an information service in 2002 resulted in an even more precipitous drop in broadband provider investment.”[136] Ernesto Falcon, Legislative Council for the Electronic Frontier Foundation[137] claimed that no such claims of CapEx reductions have been made in official reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC),[138] He said that major companies can be sued by investors who assert that they lost money because of misleading information in an SEC filing, and no such penalties apply to potentially misleading statements to Congress or the public.[138] Falcon's claim is supported by an analysis by Turner of Free Press in a report that includes 26 figures and tables, 21 of which were extracted from SEC filings and three of the remaining five came from the U.S. Census Bureau's Annual Capital Expenditures Survey.[139] The change since the Title II Order was negative for only 5 of Turner's 24 tables, and the mean and median change over the 24 tables for which it seemed reasonable to extract a typical annualized percentage change were 8.1% and 5.2%, respectively.[140] As required for any NPRM, a period for public commenting on the FCC's new proposed rules ran from May 18 to August 16, 2017. During the public commenting period, efforts were made by pro-net neutrality groups to get people to submit comments to the FCC in opposition to the new rules. John Oliver, the host of Last Week Tonight, encouraged his viewers to comment against the proposed FCC rules.[141] In early June 2017, Battle for the Net, a coalition spearheaded by Fight for the Future, Free Press Action Fund, and Demand Progress, announced a \"massive day of action\" for July 12.[142] Over 50,000 websites, including multinational corporations, participated in what Fight for the Future called \"the largest online protest in history\".[143] The FCC's open comment period on the proposed language of \"Restoring Internet Freedom\" received about 21.9 million comments, the largest influx of public comments seen by the FCC at that time;[144][145][146] previously the FCC had gotten about 500,000 comments related to new media ownership rules in 2003 and 1.4 million comments from the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy in 2004.[147] As these comments were made available to the public, third-party groups began analyzing their contents, recognizing many comments that were against net neutrality shared the same language, and were considered to be duplicative. Analysis suggested that millions of these comments were fraudulent, using the same anti-net neutrality wording that had been proposed by the Center for Individual Freedom.[141][146] One of the first studies performed after the closure of the public commenting period, done on behalf of Broadband for America, which sought to repeal the Obama-era rules, found that 60% of the comments were in favor of retaining the current rules. However, the study also identified a large number of duplicate comments; if these were taken out, the unique comments favoring retaining the current rules far outweighed those seeking repeal, 1.52 million to 23,000.[147] During and after the public commenting period, analysts reviewed the public comments and observed that a significant proportion of those using boilerplate language in support of repealing the rules had used names and addresses off known spam databases, and of those who were willing and able to be contacts asserts they left no such comment for the FCC.[147] At least twenty-four people listed by the FCC as giving anti-net neutrality comments signed an open letter to the FCC in May 2017 requesting the comments they were asserted to have made to be removed from public record.[148] The FCC's system for public comments, the Electronic Comment Filing System (ECFS), came under scrutiny: it uses an open application programming interface (API), along keys to that provided by the FCC, to submit comments, making it exploitable for mass-messaging.[147] In December 2017, the Pew Research Center issued its report in reviewing the comments, affirming that most of them were boilerplate messages, but representative of a mass campaign attempting to sway public policy. The Pew report did recognize that several of the names were nonsensical, such as variations of \"John Smith\", or used \"The Internet\", and in other cases, thousands of messages were received at nearly the same time, potential evidence of a bot spamming in comments.[149] Another study evaluating all the comments submitted by the process was completed at Stanford University and published in October 2018. The Stanford study forced solely on unique comments, resulting in more than 800,000 comments that were called \"semantic outliers\" in contrast to boilerplate language, and in a detailed review of a sampling of one thousand of these, found that 99.7% favored retaining the Obama-era rules; these came from a geographically- and politically-diverse set of users.[150] Shortly after this study, New York State's Attorney General Barbara Underwood, one of the critics of the FCC's process, issued a subpoena to over a dozen advocacy groups on both sides of the net neutrality debate to determine if they had a role in the massive number of fraudulent comments left at the FCC's system.[151] Other states, as well as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, have issued similar subpoenas on the commenting period.[152] Both The New York Times and BuzzFeed had filed Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to the FCC to gain information on the IP addresses used in the public comment period. The FCC denied the requests in December 2018 citing that releasing this information would leave the US vulnerable to a cyberattack, and Pai wrote in an attached statement that at least 500,000 of the comments were tied to Russian addresses, interfering in the process and trying to swing the public opinion in favor of keeping the Obama-era net neutrality rules.[153] A separate FOIA request was made by The New York Times as well as the website Gizmodo for records pertaining to the API key logs from the ECFS, which were granted after journalists from the works filed suit against the FCC's initial denial.[154] Data analysis led by The New York Times and Gizmodo to review the logs against those of the duplicated comments. They concluded that the duplicated comments were coming from submissions through the API assigned to CQ Roll Call, which does offer advocacy software to clients for this purpose. Gizmodo found the comments tied to the name of those that had signed the May 2017 open letter to the FCC, matching this pattern. Separately, Gizmodo found the language of the duplicated comments shares many similarities with statements made by the Center for Individual Freedom (CFIF), which had been outspoken against net neutrality of the page. Due to these investigations, CQ Roll Call, CFIF, and several other advocacy groups with access to CQ Roll Call's had been called for questioning within the New York State case against the FCC.[148] In May 2020, Judge Lorna G. Schofield of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York ruled that the FCC must provide The New York Times the IP addresses of all the comments from this commenting period. Judge Schofield stated that despite the FCC's claims of privacy issues, the request by the newspaper was valid to examine if any fraudulent activity interfered during the public commenting period towards the issue if the FCC's decision to repeal was \"vulnerable to corruption\".[155] The New York state attorney general's office reported in May 2021 that after evaluating the comments, they determined that about 18 million of the 21.9 million submitted were bogus. About 8.5 million of those comments were tied to co-registration promotions put forth by the telecom industry, promising consumers gift cards or entry into sweepstakes but then using their names and information to submit the comments without their knowledge. For this, the office had already reached settlement deals with three telecom companies for a total of $4 million in fines. Another 9.3 million of the comments considered bogus were in favor of net neutrality, according to the report, filed under false identities and many submitted by a single person.[156][157] The attorney general also obtained a total of US$650,000 from three influencer companies paid by the telecom industry that participated in the millions of fake responses.[158] Despite the ongoing analysis into fraudulent activities related to the public commenting period, and that the public comments that were deemed legitimate that weighed in favor of maintaining the 2015 Open Internet Order, the FCC announced in November 2017 that it was planning to go ahead with a final vote on December 14, 2017, to vote in the Restore Internet Freedom order and repeal the net neutrality rules.[159] FCC commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel alleged on December 8 that the FCC was withholding evidence of fraud due to irregularities in its comment period and said the vote should be postponed until after an appropriate investigation.[160] Many organizations involved in the July 12 Day of Action planned an online protest for December 12.[161] A vote was held on December 14, 2017, with a 3–2 party-line vote approving the repeal.[162][163] On January 4, 2018, the current version of \"Restoring Internet freedom\" was made public,[164] and was officially codified in the Federal Register on February 22, 2018,[165] with the rules taking effect on June 11, 2018.[166] The FCC voted along party lines, 3–2, on December 14, 2017, to enact the Restoring Internet freedom rules and repeal the 2015 Open Internet Order.[167] Within minutes after the FCC vote on December 14, 2017, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman announced his intent to lead a multi-state lawsuit against the FCC to \"stop illegal rollback of net neutrality\".[168] Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson also stated his intent to sue.[168] Twenty-two states and the District of Columbia, led by New York's Schneiderman, filed a formal suit in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit against the FCC's ruling on January 16, 2018, calling it \"arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion\", and that the FCC mis-classified Internet access as a Title I service rather than Title II due to \"an erroneous and unreasonable interpretation\" of laws around communication services.[169] The initial filing was withdrawn in early February 2018 only due to the fact that the FCC's ruling had not yet been published within the Federal Register. Once the new FCC rules were published in February 2018, the states, District of Columbia, joined by the Mozilla Foundation and Vimeo, and several other state and local entities and advocacy groups, refiled the suit on February 22, 2018.[170] The cases were all consolidated under the title Mozilla v. FCC. The FCC issued its defense on October 12, 2018, requesting the Court to reject the lawsuit, as the lawsuit filed brings \"no substantial reason to second-guess the commission’s decision to eliminate rules that the agency has determined are both unlawful and unwise\".[171] Initial court hearings were held on February 1, 2019.[171] The FCC had requested a rescheduling of the hearings due to lack of resources created by the ongoing shutdown of the government,[172] but this request was denied by the D.C. District Court.[173] At the hearing before three judges, the states challenging the FCC not only discussed the issues related to net neutrality, but also charged the FCC with selectively reviewing the public comments to come to its decision, thus \"failed in its responsibility to engage in reasoned decision-making\".[174] ISPs argued the need to have an unregulated approach to providing high-quality services to their users, and that they would not be able to offer anything less than the full Internet to users given the competitive landscape.[174] The Court of Appeals issued its decision on October 1, 2019. In a multipart decision, the Court ruled that the FCC has the capability to reclassify Internet service under Title I based on the prior Brand X ruling from the Supreme Court, allowing its 2017 rule change to stand.[15] However, the opinion stated that the FCC had \"disregard of its duty\" in evaluating the impact of net neutrality on public safety, using the example of throttled communications that impacted the capabilities of first responders during the 2018 Camp Fire. The opinion also stated that the FCC had not addressed how these rules affected utility pole access or other programs like the low-income Lifeline program. The Court did rule against the FCC, vacating the rule's limitations against state-level actions to enforce net neutrality as Congress had not given the FCC any such authority via the Telecommunications Act.[175][176][177] While various parts in support of the plaintiffs requested an en banc hearing from the full Court of Appeals, the Court denied this in February 2020.[178] In January 2018, fifty United States senators endorsed legislative action under the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to reverse the repeal of Title II net neutrality.[179] While the effort was pushed by Democratic Senators, they had also gained support of three Republican Senators, Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, and John Kennedy.[180] The motion to restore net neutrality passed in the Senate on May 16, 2018.[181][182] However, efforts for the House of Representatives to pass similar legislative action through the CRA had stalled; Democratic Representatives had attempted to gain sufficient signatures for a discharge petition to force the vote on the matter, but by June 2018, were still 46 signatures short, principally along partisan lines.[183] While the revised FCC order repealing net neutrality has become official as of June 11, 2018, the House could have taken action to reverse the decision, but even with CRA passage, the action would have to be signed into law by the President.[184] However, the Congressional term ended before the House of Representatives could act, preventing the CRA challenge. While various states have enacted versions of net neutrality laws, these mostly have been working within the established parameters set by the FCC. In the FCC's rollback, the ruling includes language that asserts states do not have authority to override the FCC decision. Legal experts believe this clause to be flawed and would allow states to still override the FCC's decision on net neutrality, as the language divests the FCC from regulating broadband carriers, and thus would disallow them from preventing states from regulating them.[185] Following the FCC's revocation of all net neutrality protections, California State Senator Scott Wiener introduced SB822, which comprehensively restored all of the protections of the 2015 Open Internet Order. The bill passed with bi-partisan support in both the State Assembly and State Senate, and on September 30, 2018, Governor Jerry Brown signed it into law. On the same day as it was signed, the US Department of Justice sued the state of California to stop the law, arguing that Congress granted the FCC the sole authority to create rules for broadband internet providers.[186] A few days later, four lobbying groups that represent the major United States terrestrial and mobile communication carriers, United States Telecom Association, CTIA, NCTA and the American Cable Association, also sued the state of California for similar reasons as the Justice Department, claiming that the state does not have authority to regulate Internet providers.[187] The state and the FCC announced on October 26, 2018, that they have reached agreement for California to hold off the enforcement of the law until pending legal action over the FCC's decision. Despite not being enforced, the bill went into effect on January 1, 2019.[188] With the October 2019 decision in Mozilla v. FCC that overturned the 2017 Order's blanket ban on state net neutrality, the U.S. government and the ISP trade groups restarted their lawsuit in August 2020 and are seeking a preliminary injunction to block enforcement of California's law until the case is concluded.[189] However, following the election of Joe Biden as president in 2021, Biden's new Department of Justice withdrew from the challenge, leaving the ISP trade groups to continue the suit.[190] Subsequently, the judge denied the preliminary injunction in a ruling on February 23, 2021, allowing the California law to go into effect, on the basis that the ISP trade groups will be unlikely to prevail in the challenge.[191] The Ninth Circuit ruled unanimously in January 2022 that California's net neutrality law may continue to be enforced and cannot be overridden by the FCC as, current as of the decision, Internet services were classified as information services.[192] The trade groups abandoned the case against the law by May 2022.[193] Democratic Senators and Representatives presented the Save the Internet Act in both Houses of Congress in early March 2019. The Act, if passed, would rescind the 2017 FCC order to repeal the 2015 Open Internet Order, codify the 2015 Open Internet Order into law, and prevent the FCC from making any similar changes baring any further change in law. Republican lawmakers indicated they felt this was too extreme and were unlikely to give support to the bill.[194][195] The bill cleared the House on a 232–190 vote on April 10, 2019, but both leaders in the Republican-controlled Senate and then-president Trump indicated they would stop the bill's passage.[196] With Joe Biden becoming president in January 2021, Ajit Pai announced his departure from the FCC in the same month. Biden named Jessica Rosenworcel, an Obama-era appointee to the FCC, as acting chairperson. Rosenworcel was a vocal proponent for net neutrality in previous FCC rulings.[197] On July 9, 2021, Biden signed Executive Order 14036,[198] \"Promoting Competition in the American Economy\", a sweeping array of initiatives across the executive branch. Among them included instructions to the FCC to restore the net neutrality rules that had been undone during the Trump administration.[199] The resignation of Pai in January 2021 left the FCC at a two-two deadlock until September 2023, when Biden-nominated Anna M. Gomez was sworn in as the Commission's fifth member. Rosenworcel stated that month that the FCC plans to re-introduce net neutrality rules.[200] While it is expected for the FCC to rule to restore net neutrality, a white paper published by telecom legal experts in 2023 warned that the rule will likely face challenges in the Supreme Court under the major questions doctrine.[201] The FCC voted 3-2 on October 19, 2023, to approve issuing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) seeking comments about rolling back to the 2015 rules.[202] The commenting period was closed on January 18, 2024.[203] The FCC voted in these proposed guidelines on April 25, 2024, on a 3-2 vote, returning Internet services under Title II, enforcing net neutrality. [204] Providers under the NCTA filed suit to challenge the new rule in June 2024. Under the suit, the providers questioned whether the FCC has the authority to reclassify broadband services. While this had been settled by previous cases like Brand X[205] the Chevron deference central to these cases was overturned in June 2024 by Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, leaving in question the capability of the FCC to enforce its net neutrality decision[206] The Sixth Circuit granted a temporary injunction against the new net neutrality rules in July 2024, with a hearing to determine if a permanent injunction is necessary at an August hearing. [207] On extending the stay in August 2024, the majority of the Sixth Circuit stated that due to the flip-flopping on how the FCC has classified internet services, it will be highly unlikely for the FCC to prevail using the weaker Skidmore deference. [208] The Sixth issued its final decision in January 2025, ruling that, in the absence of Chevron the FCC's decision classifying internet service providers as a telecommunication service was inconsistent with the Telecommunications Act of 1998. The Sixth also ruled that under the statutory reading of Telecommunications Act of 1996, internet service provides should be treated as Title I information services, which would require an act of Congress to change. [209][210] With the election of Donald Trump for his second term as president starting in 2025, Rosenworcel will step down as chairperson of the FCC.[211] Trump plans to replace her with Brendan Carr, a sitting committee member, and is expected to name another Republican to fill Carr's position. Carr is a vocal opponent of net neutrality and supports aspects such as data caps, and believes that Internet service providers should be allowed to compete without regulation, differentiating their services to draw in customers.[212] Many broadband operators imposed various contractual limits on the activities of their subscribers. In the best known examples, Cox Cable disciplined users of virtual private networks (VPNs) and AT&T, as a cable operator, warned customers that using a Wi-Fi service for home networking constituted \"theft of service\" and a federal crime.[246] Comcast blocked ports of VPNs, forcing the state of Washington, for example, to contract with telecommunications providers to ensure that its employees had access to unimpeded broadband for remote work. Other broadband providers proposed to start charging service and content providers in return for higher levels of service (higher network priority, faster or more predictable), creating what is known as a tiered Internet.[247] In 2005, North Carolina ISP Madison River Communications blocked the voice-over-internet protocol (VOIP) service Vonage. The FCC issued a Letter of Inquiry to Madison River, initiating an investigation. To avoid litigation, Madison River agreed to make a voluntary payment of fifteen thousand dollars and agreed to not block ports used for VoIP applications or otherwise prevent customers from using VoIP applications.[248] According to the consent decree, \"The Parties agree that this Consent Decree does not constitute either an adjudication on the merits or a factual or legal finding regarding any compliance or noncompliance with the requirements of the Act and the Commission’s orders and rules. The Parties agree that this Consent Decree is for settlement purposes only.\" In September 2012, a group of public interest organizations such as Free Press, Public Knowledge and the New America Foundation's Open Technology Institute filed a complaint with the FCC that AT&T was violating net neutrality rules by restricting use of Apple's video-conferencing application FaceTime on cellular networks to those who have a shared data plan on AT&T, excluding those with older, unlimited or tiered data plans.[249] The FCC response noted that \"Although this report does not attempt to engage in any legal interpretations of the Open Internet Order, we do note that the Order treats these mobile broadband networks differently from traditional fixed networks. While both fixed and mobile broadband providers must disclose their management practices, mobile broadband providers have greater latitude for blocking devices and applications (as long as they do not compete with the provider's own voice or video telephony services) and discriminating in how they serve traffic, in accordance with reasonable network-management practices.\"[250] Arguments associated with net neutrality regulations came into prominence in mid-2002 with nine different bills introduced on this issue between 2006 and 2013. Industry officials say that these proposals would launch new rules and regulations for internet providers. On October 22, 2009, Sen. McCain (R-AZ) introduced the “Internet Freedom Act of 2009[251]” (S. 1836). The bill would prohibit the FCC from enacting rules that would regulate the Internet. In other words, the bill, if passed, would prevent the FCC from imposing network or “net” neutrality rules to the Internet. Specifically, the bill language states, “The FCC shall not propose, promulgate, or issue any regulations regarding the Internet or IP-enabled services. In other words, the bill, if passed, would prohibit the FCC from enacting rules that would regulate the Internet – or against net neutrality.[252] On January 5, 2011, two anti-net neutrality bills were introduced. The first bill was H.R. 96, The Internet Freedom Act,[253] introduced by Rep. Blackburn (R-TN), with more than sixty cosponsors (all of whom are Republican). H.R. 96 strikes down the FCC’s December 21 passage of its rule and order on net neutrality by asserting that regulation of the Internet is under the jurisdiction of Congress, not the FCC. The second bill, H.R. 166, The Internet Investment, Innovation, and Competition Preservation Act[254] – was introduced by Rep. Cliff Stearns (R-FL) and co-sponsored by Rep. Blackburn. The bill also seeks to prohibit the FCC from regulating the Internet or information services (i.e. imposing net neutrality rules) unless there is demonstrated market failure. On January 25, 2011, The pro-net neutrality bill – S. 74, The Internet Freedom, Broadband Promotion, and Consumer Protection Act of 2011 [255]– was introduced by Sen. Cantwell (D-WA) and co-sponsored by Sen. Franken (D-MN). The bill would codify the FCC's six net neutrality principles (which the ALA supported), outlined in a November 2009 FCC Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM), among other things. There has been extensive debate about whether net neutrality should be required by law in the United States. Debate over the issue predates the coining of the term. Advocates of net neutrality have raised concerns about the ability of broadband providers to use their last mile infrastructure to block Internet applications and content (e.g. websites, services, and protocols), and even to block out competitors.[256] While opponents claim net neutrality regulations would deter investment into improving broadband infrastructure and try to fix something that isn't broken.[257][258] In 2014 Professor Susan Crawford, a legal and technology expert at Harvard Law School suggested that municipal broadband might be a possible solution to net neutrality concerns.[259] Organizations that support net neutrality come from widely varied political backgrounds and include groups such as Consumer Reports,[260] MoveOn.org, Free Press, Consumer Federation of America, AARP, American Library Association, Public Knowledge, the Media Access Project, the Christian Coalition, TechNet,[261][262][263] the American Civil Liberties Union, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Greenpeace, Tumblr, Kickstarter, Vimeo, Wikia, Mozilla Foundation, NEA, and others.[264][265][266][267][268][269] Prominent supporters of net neutrality include Vinton Cerf, co-inventor of the Internet Protocol; Tim Berners-Lee, creator of the World Wide Web; law professor Tim Wu; Netflix CEO Reed Hastings; Tumblr founder David Karp; Free Press President Craig Aaron; and Last Week Tonight host John Oliver, who presented two full-length Last Week Tonight segments about the issue.[270][271][272][273][274] Other organizations that have voiced support for Net Neutrality are Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. In December 2017 public opinion poll, 83% of voters supported keeping the rules on net neutrality, including 75% of Republican voters, 89% of Democratic voters, and 86% of independent voters.[275][276] Outside of the US, several countries have removed net neutrality protocols and have started double charging for delivering content (once to consumer and again to content providers). This equates to a toll being required for certain internet access, essentially limiting what is available to all people, in particular low income households.[277] Large, already well-established companies may not be harmed by cost increase that providers such as Comcast may levy upon them, but it may stifle small businesses and start-ups.[278] Sites such as Facebook, Google, and Amazon may not have been able to thrive absent net neutrality.[279] Barbara Stripling, the president of the American Library Association states: \"School, public and college libraries rely upon the public availability of open, affordable Internet access for school homework assignments, distance learning classes, e-government services, licensed databases, job-training videos, medical and scientific research, and many other essential services, we must ensure the same quality access to online educational content as to entertainment and other commercial offerings.\"[269] Previously existing FCC rules do not prevent telecommunications companies from charging fees to certain content providers in exchange for preferential treatment (the so-called \"fast lanes\"). Neutrality advocates Tim Wu and Lawrence Lessig have argued that the FCC does have regulatory power over the matter, following from the must-carry precedent set in the Supreme Court case Turner Broadcasting v. Federal Communications Commission.[280] Net neutrality proponents argue that telecom companies seek to impose a tiered service model in order to control the pipeline and thereby remove competition, create artificial scarcity, and oblige subscribers to buy their otherwise noncompetitive services.[264] Many believe net neutrality to be primarily important for the preservation of current internet freedoms; a lack of net neutrality would allow Internet service providers, such as Comcast, to extract payment from content providers like Netflix, and these charges would ultimately be passed on to consumers.[281][282] Civil rights organizations, such as the Color of Change, the National Hispanic Media Coalition, and more[283] argue that net neutrality is also important for communities of color because it allows for them to tell their own stories and “organize for racial and social justice.\"[284] Much of the mainstream media does not showcase these minority people, so these organizations believe that it is important to open the Internet into giving these people some sort of broadcast station. By doing so, their voices can be heard, because beforehand ISPs could “block unpopular speech and prevent dissident voices from speaking freely online.\"[284] In May 2014, some websites admitted to inserting code that slowed user access to their site from known FCC IP addresses, as a protest on the FCC's position on net neutrality.[285] On his show Last Week Tonight, Oliver took on the issue of net neutrality for the first time in 2014, in the show's first season. The episode went viral with 13 million views on YouTube[286] and prompted 45,000 comments on the FCC website.[287] At the 2016 Consumer Electronics Show, former FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler cited Oliver's episode as a turning point in the issue of net neutrality. “John Oliver took the ultimate arcane issue, Title II, and made it something that got people interested. And that’s good.”[288] Oliver returned to the issue of net neutrality on his May 7, 2017, episode in response to Chairman Pai's promise to get rid of the regulation. He prompted viewers to once again comment on the FCC website by buying the domain gofccyourself.com, which garnered 1.6 million contributions.[289] Some have referenced[290] the advance of Elon Musk's Starlink as something that could undercut the lobbying power of cable companies by offering internet access via satellite as opposed to traditional wired or wireless technologies. Some rural areas would have much less or no connectivity without net neutrality, making the use of farm software impracticable or impossible.[291] Individuals against net neutrality include former FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai,[292] Daniel Berninger and Jeff Pulver,[293][294] Marc Andreessen, Robert Kahn, Peter Thiel, MIT Media Lab founder Nicholas Negroponte, Internet engineer and former Chief Technologist for the FCC David Farber, and Nobel Prize economist Gary Becker.[295][296][297][298][299] Nonprofit organizations opposed to net neutrality include FreedomWorks,[300] the Reason Foundation,[301] and Citizens Against Government Waste.[302][303][304] Organizations and companies that oppose net neutrality regulations include several major technology hardware companies, cable and telecommunications companies, hundreds of small internet service providers, various think tanks, several civil rights groups, and others.[257][305][306][294][293][307] Companies such as Verizon, AT&T, and Comcast are some of the biggest opponents to net neutrality. In fact, since 2005 these companies have lobbied three times as much in opposition to net neutrality as the likes of Google and Microsoft have lobbied for it.[308] The statistics show that from 2005 to 2013, anti-neutrality companies filed 427 reports to lobby against net-neutrality, compared to just 176 reports filed by those for it.[308] Opponents argue that net neutrality would benefit industry lobbyists, and not consumers due to the potential of regulatory capture with policies that protect incumbent interests.[309] Former hedge fund manager turned journalist Andy Kessler has argued, the threat of eminent domain against the telecommunication providers, instead of new legislation, is the best approach by forcing competition and better services.[310] One print ad frames the Hands Off the Internet message in pro-consumer terms. \"Net neutrality means consumers will be stuck paying more for their Internet access to cover the big online companies' share,\" the ad claims.[311] In November 2005, Edward Whitacre Jr., then chief executive officer of SBC Communications, stated \"there's going to have to be some mechanism for these [Internet upstarts] who use these pipes to pay for the portion they're using\", and that \"The Internet can't be free in that sense, because we and the cable companies have made an investment,\"[312] sparking a furious debate. SBC spokesman Michael Balmoris said that Whitacre was misinterpreted and his comments only referred to new tiered services.[313] Net neutrality laws are generally opposed by the cable television and telephone industries.[314][315] Net neutrality opponents such as IBM, Intel, Juniper, Qualcomm, and Cisco claim that net neutrality would deter investment into broadband infrastructure, saying that \"shifting to Title II means that instead of billions of broadband investment driving other sectors of the economy forward, any reduction in this spending will stifle growth across the entire economy. Title II is going to lead to a slowdown, if not a hold, in broadband build out, because if you don’t know that you can recover on your investment, you won’t make it.\"[257][316] Others argue that the regulation is \"a solution that won’t work to a problem that simply doesn’t exist\".[317] Critics of net neutrality argue that data discrimination is desirable for reasons like guaranteeing quality of service. Bob Kahn, co-inventor of the Internet Protocol, called the term net neutrality a slogan and opposes establishing it, but he admits that he is against the fragmentation of the net whenever this becomes excluding to other participants.[295] Vint Cerf, Kahn's co-founder of the Internet Protocol, explains the confusion over their positions on net neutrality, \"There’s also some argument that says, well you have to treat every packet the same. That’s not what any of us said. Or you can’t charge more for more usage. We didn’t say that either.\"[318] An alternate position was proposed in 2010 by then-FCC Commissioner Julius Genachowski, which would narrowly reclassify Internet access as a telecommunication service under Title Two of the Communications Act of 1934. It would apply only six[319] common carrier rules under the legal principle of forbearance that would sufficiently prevent unreasonable discrimination and mandate reasonable net neutrality policies under the concept of common carriage. Incumbent ISP AT&T opposed the idea, saying that common carrier regulations would \"cram today's broadband Internet access providers into an ill-fitting 20th century regulatory silo,\" while Google supported the FCC proposal: \"In particular, the Third Way will promote legal certainty and regulatory predictability to spur investment, ensure that the Commission can fulfill the tremendous promise of the National Broadband Plan, and make it possible for the Commission to protect and serve all broadband users, including through meaningful enforcement.\"[320] In October 2014, after the initial proposal was shot down, the FCC began drafting a new proposal that would take a hybrid regulatory approach to the issue. Although this alternative has not yet been circulated, it is said to propose that there be a divide between \"wholesale\" and \"retail\" transactions.[321] In order to illustrate clear rules that are grounded by law, reclassification of Title II of the Communications Act of 1934 will be involved as well as parts of Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Data being sent between content provider and ISPs will involve stricter regulations compared to transactions between ISP's and consumers, which will involve more lax parameters. Restrictions on offering a data fast lane will be enforced between content providers and ISPs to avoid unfair advantages. This hybrid proposal has become the most popular solution among the three options that FCC has reported. However, ISPs, such as AT&T who has already warned the public via tweet \"any use of Title II would be problematic\", are expected to dispute this solution.[321] The official proposal was rumored to become public by the end of 2014.[322] In 2006 Bram Cohen, the creator of BitTorrent, said \"I most definitely do not want the Internet to become like television where there's actual censorship... however it is very difficult to actually create network neutrality laws which don't result in an absurdity, like making it so that ISPs can't drop spam or stop... attacks.\"[323] In June 2007, the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) urged restraint with respect to new regulations proposed by net neutrality advocates, noting the \"broadband industry is a relatively young and evolving one,\" and given no \"significant market failure or demonstrated consumer harm from conduct by broadband providers\" such regulations \"may well have adverse effects on consumer welfare, despite the good intentions of their proponents.\"[324] The FTC conclusions were questioned in Congress in September 2007, when Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., chairman of the Senate interstate commerce, trade and tourism subcommittee, told FTC Chairwoman Deborah Platt Majoras that he feared new services as groundbreaking as Google could not get started in a system with price discrimination.[325] In 2011 Aparna Watal, a legal officer at an Internet company named Atomic Labs, has put forward three points for resisting any urge \"to react legislatively to the apparent regulatory crisis\".[326] Firstly, \"contrary to the general opinion, the Comcast decision does not uproot the Commission's authority to regulate ISPs. Section 201(b) of the Act, which was cited as an argument by the Commission but not addressed by the Court on procedural grounds, could grant the Commission authority to regulate broadband Internet services where they render \"charges, practices and regulations for, and in connection with\" common carrier services unjust and unreasonable.\"[326] Secondly, she suggests, it is \"undesirable and premature to legislatively mandate network neutrality or for the Commission to adopt a paternalistic approach on the issue ... [as] there have been few overt incidents to date, and the costs of those incidents to consumers have been limited.\"[326] She cites \"prompt media attention and public backlash\" as effective policing tools to prevent ISPs from throttling traffic. She suggests that it \"would be more prudent to consider introducing modest consumer protection rules, such as requiring ISPs to disclose their network management practices and to allow for consumers to switch ISPs inexpensively, rather than introducing network neutrality laws.\"[326] \"While by regulating broadband services the commission is not directly regulating content and applications on the Internet\", content will be affected by the reclassification. \"The different layers of the Internet work in tandem with each other such that there is no possibility of throttling or improving one layer's performance without impacting the other layers. ... To let the Commission regulate broadband pipelines connecting to the Internet and disregard that it indirectly involves regulating the data that runs through them will lead to a complex, overlapping, and fractured regulatory landscape in the years to come.\"[326] As of 2006 the debate over \"neutrality\" did not yet capture some dimensions of the topic; for example, whether voice packets should get higher priority than packets carrying email or whether emergency services, mission-critical, or life-saving applications, such as tele-medicine, should get priority over spam.[327] Cable companies have lobbied Congress for a federal preemption to ban states and municipalities from competing and thereby interfering with interstate commerce. However, there is current Supreme Court precedent for an exception to the Commerce Power of Congress for states as states going into business for their citizens.[328] In 2006 it was proposed that neither municipal wireless nor other technological solutions such as encryption, onion routing, or time-shifting DVR would be sufficient to render possible discrimination moot.[329] EPB, the municipal utility serving Chattanooga, Tennessee, petitioned the FCC to allow them to deliver internet to communities outside of the 600-square mile area that they service.[330] A similar petition was made by Wilson, North Carolina. According to FCC officials, some residents who lived just outside the service areas of the Chattanooga and Wilson utilities then had no broadband service available.[109] One of the two February 26, 2015, rulings set aside those states' restrictions on municipal broadband, although legal challenges to the FCC's authority to do so were seen as likely.[109] Individual states have taken action to generally uphold net neutrality either through proposed legislation or through by requiring state agencies to establish contracts with Internet providers that offer net neutral-services. The status as of February 26, 2018[update], of executive orders and pending action at state levels is summarized as follows:[331]",

Our classes focus on discussion, critical and collaborative thinking, and writing and analysis. Students have the opportunity to participate in the verbal worlds of other times and places, drawing on the full range of linguistic tools, historical knowl­edge, and interpretive experience at our disposal. In English classes, we work to deepen our understanding of the critical and creative imagination. The skills developed in our classes—writing, communication, collaboration, analysis, research, and interpretation— help prepare students for a range of different careers. The English Major allows for great flexibility, and students can choose to focus their studies according to their own interests. Since English majors always have a choice of which classes to take (there are no individual courses that are required), it is relatively easy to fit your English courses around other required courses. The English Major complements other disciplines well. In any given semester, you will find courses covering a wide range of topics. We offer classes focused on particular genres (fantasy, poetry, science fiction), classes based in historical periods (like Modernism or Medievalism), classes focused on particular kinds of writing (creative writing, technical writing, digital storytelling) and more. We also offer classes focused on the way literature interacts with various big ideas and topics, like Literature and Revolution, Literature and the Natural World, Literature and Philosophy, and Literature and Childhood. The majority of our courses are taught in a discussion format with great attention paid to the nuances of language and style. English classes are generally small, so students have the opportunity to get to know their professors.As an English major, you will hone your skills as a reader, writer and communicator. Every organization and company needs people who can read and write well. If you have ever gone to a museum’s website, or listened to a podcast, or clicked through an email advertising a sale at your favorite store, there was someone like you on the other end creating these examples of successful communication. Companies and organizations have stories to tell—to stakeholders, to other businesses, and to the public, and someone majoring or minoring in English has the necessary close reading skills, audience awareness skills, argument crafting skills, research skills, and rhetorical sensitivity to thrive in content producing and editing positions. Some (though certainly not all) possible career paths include: nonprofit organizations; marketing and public relations; publishing; web content production; and libraries.

                "content": "UGA The mission of the UGA Intensive English Program (IEP) is to offer engaging, supportive, and rigorous language instruction to help speakers of English as a foreign language improve their English proficiency, gain cultural knowledge and understanding, and obtain practical communication skills for a variety of social situations. Our student-centered courses are designed to help students develop the English proficiency and cultural competencies they need to participate in everyday, academic, and professional conversations, enter and succeed in American universities and colleges, effectively position themselves on the American job market, or take the next steps in their professional careers. In addition, the IEP hosts a variety of activities and social events throughout the course of each session. Here, IEP students and faculty, their families and friends, and other UGA students can socialize, eat good food, celebrate, and make new friends. Our goal is to foster a shared belonging among all members of the IEP and to create opportunities for students to practice their English outside of the classroom. We want to serve all English language learners, and we are proud to teach students that come from many different countries and a large variety of cultural and linguistic backgrounds. Our students include: Our students deserve highly qualified and experienced faculty who teach classes that are both challenging and enjoyable. All of our instructors are exceptionally qualified to deliver effective and engaging language instruction. They all have many years of teaching experience and are deeply committed to helping our students develop the English proficiency necessary to achieve their educational and professional goals. Our program is housed within UGA’s Office of Global Engagement. OGE’s mission is to: “… promote and support a broad array of interdisciplinary initiatives and experiential learning opportunities designed to improve the global understanding of students, faculty and staff. In keeping with UGA’s mission, OGE is committed to highlighting the critical importance of internationalized curricula and engagement in an increasingly diverse and interdependent global society.” As our program, which started in January 2014, continues to grow, we regularly offer new courses and programs that are designed to meet our students’ evolving needs, and we also strive to make the IEP an integral part of the University of Georgia. Finally, we understand that studying in a new culture, far away from home and family, can be stressful, so we strive to offer a supportive and welcoming environment. We want our students to know that we value not only their hard work and academic achievements but also their individuality, their cultural diversity, and their contributions to the global community at UGA. If you are interested in applying to our IEP program, we encourage you to review our Application & Program Information page and our Courses & Levels page. Once you have selected your program, check the Important Dates page before putting in your Application.

UGA Intensive English Program (@uga_iep) • Instagram photos and videos Thi Thu An Pham (Vietnam): “The thing I like the most in the IEP is learning about American culture and language. Previously, I didn’t know about Thanksgiving, Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Ground Hog Day, but during IEP classes, I learned what the days are. I love the instructors, too. I love Greg, Laura, Lavon, and Rachael so much. They are very knowledgeable and professional. My English improved during my studies at the UGA IEP. Last but not least, UGA has a really nice campus. I love the trees and flowers. When I walk from Lay Thomas Community Park to my class, I really enjoy the nature with flowers, squirrels, butterflies, and saying “Hello!” to pedestrians. It makes my day beautiful!” Loren Dong, Ph.D. (China): “I participated in the UGA IEP for about two years. The way I was taught English in China focused mainly on passing exams. When I came to the U.S., I could not even open my mouth. But here, the American English teachers are knowledgeable and skilled. My overall English ability has improved a lot. The IEP has been the best English program I’ve ever participated in.” Hwajeong Shin (South Korea): “The IEP was amazing! The instructors are exceptional English teachers, and the well-organized social events greatly facilitate adaptation and friendship building. I met lots of friends from different places, learned a lot, and loved the UGA campus. It was a great experience, and I totally recommend it.” Wezddy Del Toro Orozco (Mexico): “I like a lot that the IEP has a diverse body of international students, as well as a diverse body of instructors. During classes, I feel like I’m in an inclusive learning environment. My instructor always promoted a comfortable and safe space for students to ask questions and to share about our own culture. This way, while studying English, we learn not only about culture and traditions in the U.S. but also about those of the different countries where the students come from. The classes are fun and interactive! The IEP also organizes social events in which instructors and students from the various courses (as well as our families and friends) interact, and we have had a great time. I have made good friends in the program and have enjoyed being part of the IEP community a lot!” 1324 S Lumpkin St, Athens, GA 30605 Sign up to our newsletter",

        "Victims of New Orleans attack": [
            {
                "title": "Live updates: New Orleans truck attack, memorial on Bourbon Street for victims | CNN",
                "content": "Live Updates • The Army veteran from Texas who rammed a rented pickup truck into a crowd in New Orleans on New Year’s Day was “100% inspired by ISIS” but acted alone, the FBI said, describing the deadly attack as “an act of terrorism.” Here’s a timeline of the attack. • The attacker killed 14 people and wounded dozens more. Victims include a student, a former college football player, and parents of young children. Here’s what we know about them. • The attacker had planted two explosives in ice coolers in the French Quarter, both of which were rendered safe by bomb technicians. Investigators searching the attacker’s Houston home found chemicals typically used to construct explosives, a law enforcement source said. • The White House has seen no evidence of foreign direction or involvement in the attack, a source familiar with the matter told CNN. President Joe Biden is expected to visit New Orleans on Monday. After separate deadly New Year’s Day incidents in New Orleans and Las Vegas involving vehicles from Turo, the company’s CEO on Friday said there were no “red flags” about the drivers who used the peer-to-peer car-sharing service. In an interview with CNBC, CEO Andre Haddad reiterated the alleged attacker in New Orleans and the driver of a Cybertruck that exploded outside Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas were decorated members of the military. The company, which says it runs background checks on its customers, had previously confirmed before they rented the cars that both drivers had a valid driver’s license, and one was honorably discharged. The car rental platform ingests more than 50 data points into its algorithms, Haddad explained. That includes characteristics of Turo users from vehicle horsepower to details about renters and where the rental car is located and when the car was booked. The data is used to compile risk scores for Turo users, according to a Friday statement. “That has been the anchor of our very strong safety track record over the last four years,” Haddad said in the interview. He said the company’s focus has been on dealing with the aftermath of the attacks and cooperating with law enforcement to assist with the investigations. Keep reading. President Joe Biden told reporters Friday in the Oval Office that he has spoken to families of the victims of the deadly attack in New Orleans. “Yes I have,” Biden said when asked if he’s talked with family members. “I’ll talk about it later,” he added. Biden and first lady Jill Biden are expected to visit New Orleans on Monday, the White House previously announced. Federal security agencies advised law enforcement to be on the lookout for potential copycat attacks after 14 people were killed on Bourbon Street on New Year’s Day, according to a joint intelligence bulletin issued Thursday. “We advise federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial government and law enforcement officials and private sector security partners to remain vigilant of potential copycat or retaliatory attacks inspired by this attack and other recent, lethal vehicle-ramming incidents across the globe,” said the internal law enforcement bulletin obtained by CNN, which was released by the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI and the National Counterterrorism Center. The FBI and DHS routinely share potential threat indicators with law enforcement agencies across the country following significant security incidents in the US and abroad. “We remain concerned that a similar increase in vehicle-ramming attacks will follow the terrorist attack in New Orleans; along with other recent, deadly vehicle-ramming incidents around the world,” the bulletin said. The bulletin comes only weeks after the two federal agencies issued a warning of the threat of violence from lone offenders around the holidays and the potential use of vehicle ramming. In a statement to CNN, a Homeland Security spokesperson said the department is working closely with law enforcement partners to evaluate threats during this heightened threat level. “We urge the public to promptly report any suspicious activity to local authorities and remain vigilant of potential copycat or retaliatory attacks inspired by the New Orleans terrorist attack or other recent, vehicle-ramming incidents across the globe,” the spokesperson said. Tiger Bech’s high school football coach says he is heartbroken by his former student’s death in the New Orleans New Year’s terror attack, but he will remember their last visit together over the holiday. “I saw him right before Christmas when he came into town,” Marty Cannon, who is now principal of St. Thomas More Catholic High School in Lafayette, Louisiana, told CNN’s Pamela Brown Friday, “and right off the bat he wanted to know about my family, he wanted to know how our school was doing, he wanted to know how I was doing in my role as principal. He was that kind of guy.” After his high school graduation, Bech, 27, played three years at Princeton University, primarily as a kick returner. Princeton coach Bob Surace said in a statement that Bech was “a ferocious competitor with endless energy, a beloved teammate and a caring friend.” Cannon told CNN that Bech loved to return to his hometown, and he is grateful to have gotten a final opportunity to see his former player. “I can imagine that this is going to bring some healing long-term that he got to spend this Christmas season with his family,” said Cannon. Trevor Neill, who served with Shamsud-Din Jabbar while stationed in Fort Gordon in Georgia, said he was “absolutely floored” when he heard his old friend had killed 14 people while driving through a crowd in New Orleans Wednesday. “He was a normal individual, no red flags, great soldier, phenomenal friend,” Neill told CNN affiliate KHOU about the suspect. “I buckled and I couldn’t talk for like 20 or 30 seconds, was just like, ‘Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God’,” Neill told KHOU. “And it’s very unfortunate that he [Jabbar] took that path.” The Canal Street entry point to the New Orleans’ French Quarter was the only one wide enough for a vehicle to get onto Bourbon Street using the sidewalk, while subsequent corners “would be far too narrow,” according to Rep. Troy Carter, from Louisiana’s 2nd Congressional District. “So, the only place that they could have gained access on the sidewalk, would have been at Canal Street. Which lends me to wonder how long had this plot been being hatched? Had he cased the area to determine that this was a weak point?” Carter questioned. “In the coming days, weeks, and months, we’ll be able to answer those questions, but even faster than that, we’ll be sealing any possibility for a breach going forward,” Carter assured, noting commitments from President Joe Biden, Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry and New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell to do so. As President Joe Biden prepares to visit New Orleans early next week following the deadly Bourbon Street attack, the incoming president of the city council is hoping for more information on how the federal government will help in the aftermath. “What we need to hear from the president is, one, how many other resources will be made available?” at-large council member JP Morrell told CNN’s Jim Acosta. Morrell promised earlier Friday to devote city resources to a “deep-dive investigation” into the work to replace existing security barriers on Bourbon Street with new ones, leaving the tourist-heavy area particularly vulnerable on New Year’s. City leaders also want more information on why attacker Shamsud-Din Jabbar was not caught after leaving multiple videos starting about two hours prior to the attack, with a final video only minutes before he killed 14 people. “It is very troubling to many of us that during the FBI briefing yesterday, it was made public that this individual posted on social media — on places like Facebook — well before the attack that he intended to do something and that this was not flagged,” said Morrell. Some background: A report from security consultants commissioned by the French Quarter Management District five years ago said the city’s bollard system protecting Bourbon Street “should be improved,” but Morrell told CNN that was news to him. “This new council came in in 2022, so we were not aware that there was a 2019 report,” Morrell said. President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden are expected to visit New Orleans on Monday, a White House official tells CNN. The visit will come five days after a terror attack killed 14 people and wounded dozens more along the city’s famed Bourbon Street in the early hours of New Year’s Day. “The President and First Lady will grieve with the families and community members impacted by the tragic attack on January 1st and meet with officials on the ground,” the official said. The trip will mark one of the final displays of Biden as a consoler-in-chief, a role he’s stepped into several times during his four years in office. The president told reporters on Thursday that he was “gonna try” to visit the city in the aftermath of the attack. The president has pledged federal resources to assist the investigation into the attack and has expressed the country’s solidarity with the people of New Orleans and those mourning the loss of their loved ones. “Today, all of America stands with the people of New Orleans– we pray for those killed and injured in yesterday’s attack, and we’re grateful, we’re grateful to those brave first responders who raced to save lives,” Biden said in a message ahead of the Sugar Bowl, where the University of Notre Dame defeated the University of Georgia Thursday. “We’re glad the game is back on for today, but I’m not surprised, because the spirit of New Orleans can never be kept down, and that’s also true for the spirit of America.” A person’s absorption of “what ISIS is selling” is significantly more difficult to stop than organized efforts like those seen on 9/11, CNN senior national security analyst Juliette Kayyem and CNN counterterrorism analyst Philip Mudd explained. “Some of the most persistent challenges in terms of counter terrorism and counter insurgency over the decades, are people inspired by religion, because, of course, they believe that God is speaking to them, saying that there’s a divine need for you to go act – in this case, in Bourbon Street,” Mudd told CNN’s Sara Sidner. “Especially in the age of YouTube videos, where a preacher can speak to you for years, this persistence of a religious message that says, ‘If you don’t act, you’re not living according to the Word of God,’ that’s going to be with us for a long time.” “Religious insurgencies and religious terrorism are really hard to beat,” Mudd added. Shamsud-Din Jabbar’s radicalization “may have been very, very quick,” Kayyem said. “He’s dealing with a lot of issues: divorce, money, professional issues. He’s older than your average recruit. And what it appears now, is that (in) the military he may have been fine – it was getting out into the civilian world. He’s lost. He needs to find meaning … ISIS fills that vacuum for some of these people.” The New Orleans City Council is still trying to answer why Bourbon Street lacked permanent security bollards on the morning of the deadly New Year’s Day attack, Councilman JP Morrell says. “We have had some contradictory messages internally as far as when the work was awarded and when it should have started, and I know from my perspective as the incoming Council president, we are going to do our own deep-dive investigation over the coming weeks to go into that,” Morrell told CNN’s Christina Macfarlane Friday morning. City leaders have said existing barricades were being removed and replaced in preparation for hosting Super Bowl LIX on February 9, with a single police cruiser used to block the entrance to Bourbon Street for New Year’s Eve. Shamsud-Din Jabbar drove his truck onto the sidewalk, bypassing the police barrier, investigators said. “With the Super Bowl on the horizon, it was important to have those bollards installed, but no less important was the Sugar Bowl and New Year’s Eve,” said Morrell. “I mean, New Orleans is a destination for pretty much every holiday you can imagine, so having those bollards available – and even more importantly, not having hardened infrastructure even temporarily there instead of the bollards as they’re placed throughout the Quarter – is problematic.” Family members of the suspected terror attacker who killed 14 revelers in New Orleans said the man they knew is completely different from the one who drove a pickup truck into a crowd on Bourbon Street. “He was very well tempered, slow to anger, kind, soft spoken,” 24-year-old Abdur Jabbar said of his brother, Shamsud-Din Jabbar, 42. “That’s why it was so unbelievable that he would be capable of something like this.” Abdur and his 65-year-old father, Rahim, said they never saw any signs of someone who was radicalized and hatching a deadly plot. “Something screwed him up. He’s not this type of person,” Abdur said. “Someone or something fogged his mind.” “That’s what’s puzzling us,” Rahim told CNN. “He wasn’t going through something that we knew of,” later adding, “It’s all around bad for everybody.” Abdur said he got home Wednesday morning after working the night shift at a railroad company when he got a call from another relative saying Shamsud-Din Jabbar had been identified as the attacker. Abdur thought there must have been a mistake until he saw his brother’s face on the news. “I was shocked that somebody so close to me could cause all this destruction,” he said. “I feel for those people over there — and that had to witness it.” Abdul said his brother, who had three children and two ex-wives, never let on that anything was bothering him or that he was in any financial trouble. The pair were not close growing up because of their age gap but connected after their father suffered a stroke in August 2023 and then spoke almost daily. They became closer, with the older brother offering career guidance and life advice. They never spoke of ISIS, Abdur said. “He’s never shared anything like that or of that nature with me,” Abdur said, adding that they were raised Muslim and regularly attended a mosque on Friday nights growing up. “He understood what it meant to be a Muslim and that’s what I’ve seen from him in the time we got closer,” Abdur said. “How he carried himself and how he treated other people. It wasn’t anything of this nature. It wasn’t this tragedy. It was the complete opposite.” Shamsud-Din Jabbar’s father said he lamented not having a chance to talk his son out of the attack. “How do you know what to do if they don’t tell you,” Rahim said, adding that they were close. “We would have certainly tried, because we knew it wouldn’t have been a good ending.” Abdur says he still views Shamsud-Din Jabbar as kind and compassionate, despite the attack. “I’m in no way condoning what he did. What he did wasn’t right,” Abdur said. “But there’s still a line between what he did and him being the human being and the brother he was to me.” Trauma psychologists treating victims and witnesses of the attack are seeing “a lot of acute stress responses,” Erika Rajo, one of the team members, told CNN’s Sara Sidner. “Some people are having intrusive thoughts about what happened, a lot of grief and mourning,” Rajo said. “Some people are having physical symptoms. A lot of people are reminded of the trauma from TV or just being in New Orleans.” The team is helping people process the trauma, express emotions, and cope through techniques like deep breathing, Rajo said. In the early hours of New Year’s Day, an attacker rammed a pickup truck into a crowd of people on New Orleans’ famed Bourbon Street, killing 14 people and wounding dozens more. Here’s what we know about the victims killed in the attack. The FBI said the attack by Shamsud-Din Jabbar was an “act of terrorism.” The agency said he was “100% inspired by ISIS” and that they would investigate his “path to radicalization.” Jabbar, who was killed in a firefight with police, was an Army veteran from Texas. Here’s what we know about the investigation: The city of New Orleans appears to have had multiple methods on hand to protect pedestrians on Bourbon Street, but none of them were able to stop a man inspired by ISIS from using a pickup truck to ram into pedestrians celebrating the new year. “This particular terrorist drove around, onto the sidewalk, and got around the hard target,” New Orleans Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick said Wednesday. “We did have a car there, we had barriers there, we had officers there,” she said, “and they still got around.” “We did indeed have a plan,” Kirkpatrick added, “but the terrorist defeated it.” Residents and tourists who spoke with CNN and affiliates noted those barriers –– portable steel structures that can either lay flat or be raised depending on traffic –– were not raised while recounting the attack. Surveillance footage on Bourbon Street showed the pickup truck driving over one such barrier, which was not erect at the time of the incident. The city has been working on installing new, removable stainless-steel bollards along several blocks. Like the portable and mechanical barricades, the bollards could close the street to traffic when needed to protect pedestrians but be lowered when the street was open to vehicles. Construction on that project began in November and was expected to carry on through February. The bollards were the subject of a 2019 report from a private security consulting firm that noted the risk of terrorism in New Orleans’ French Quarter, specifically mass shootings and vehicular attacks, remained “highly possible while moderately probable.” The report by Interior International, reviewed by CNN, “strongly recommends” bollard mobilization to be fixed and improved “immediately.” Read the full story. Pittsburgh-area native Jeremi Selensky was visiting New Orleans during the New Year’s holiday and was on Bourbon Street when a driver plowed through crowd. CNN’s Anderson Cooper spoke to him at a hospital. The new year was just three hours old when a pickup truck sped down Bourbon Street – the heart of the French Quarter in New Orleans. Jimmy Cothran had just stepped into a New Orleans nightclub when a group of young women pushed their way in and hid beneath the tables. “We didn’t take any chances,” said Cothran, a 15-year resident of South Louisiana. They ran upstairs. The brazen car-ramming, which investigators say was an ISIS-inspired act of terrorism, was already over by the time Cothran looked over a balcony to the scene below. “The disfigurement, and the bodies strewn. Something you can’t unsee, you’ll never forget,” he told CNN. The revelers’ paradise had been transformed into a killing field at the hands of a US-born Army veteran from Texas. He killed 14 people and injured dozens more before police shot him dead. Before the attack: Hotels in the area were booked by as many as 75,000 people who’d descended on the city to ring in 2025, to attend concerts, or watch the Sugar Bowl. At 3:16 a.m., surveillance footage shows a pickup on Canal Street. The truck quickly turns onto Bourbon Street and around a patrol vehicle. It speeds out of frame, accelerating through a group of people on the corner. Zion Parsons, 18, hid in the gap between two bars as a “real-life horror movie” played out before him. “Everything the car is hitting, it’s getting thrown – it’s getting thrown up into the air and away and just under the car,” Parsons told CNN. He was with two friends, but when the truck passed, he realized only one of his friends had hidden with him. The other was lying in the street. The truck eventually crashed farther down Bourbon. Footage captured two blocks north of Canal Street shows bystanders rushing to a victim as uniformed officers confront the driver. Gunshots ring out. Bystanders flee. By sunrise: Law enforcement converged on the French Quarter. New Orleans officials urged tourists to continue enjoying the city but steer clear of Bourbon Street. But April and Paul McGee couldn’t stomach the thought of staying a moment longer. They ended their trip early. “Somebody else can have our room,” she said. “We don’t want it.” Read the full story. Cathy and Lou Tenedorio talk to CNN’s Erin Burnett about their son, Matthew, who died while running to help other victims of the New Year’s Day attack in New Orleans. Victims killed in the New Orleans attack include a student, a former college football player, and parents of young children. Authorities have yet to release their names, but some have been identified by their loved ones. Here’s what we know about them: Tiger Bech: The native of Lafayette, Louisiana, was a former Princeton football player and had been working as a junior trader in New York City. The 27-year-old was caught up in the attack while on his way back to a hotel with his best friend Ryan Quigley, his sister said. He died from internal injuries hours later. She said Quigley was in a stable condition as of Wednesday. Matthew Tenedorio: The 25-year-old was from Slidell, Louisiana. He worked on the video production team for ASM, which manages two major venues in New Orleans, including the Caesars Superdome. On New Year’s Eve, Tenedorio traveled to the city to celebrate. That night, he had dinner with his family, his cousin Christina Bounds said. “They begged Matthew not to go.” Reggie Hunter: The Baton Rouge native leaves behind an 11-year-old child and a one-year-old. The 37-year-old was on Bourbon Street with a cousin, Kevin Ball. After the attack, Hunter was taken to a hospital but later died from internal injuries. Ball, who was injured in the attack, was recovering in hospital as of Wednesday. Kareem Badawi had studied at the University of Alabama and, before that, the Episcopal School of Baton Rouge. Badawi and Parker Vidrine, another former student who was injured in the attack, graduated from the high school in 2024. Hubert Gauthreaux: The 21-year-old was an alumnus of Archbishop Shaw High School. New Orleans City Council member Helena N. Moreno told CNN she had spent time with Gauthreaux’s family as they were trying to find him after the attack. She learned about his death later that night. Drew Dauphin: The recent Auburn University graduate was 26 years old. “Drew lit up every room he entered. His smile was infectious,” his family said. Nicole Perez: The 27-year-old is the mother of a five-year-old son. Her sister, Jessica Carvajal, who is eight months pregnant, said she and her mother had to be hospitalized after they were shocked by Perez’s death. Billy DiMaio: The 25-year-old was a New York-based account executive at Audacy who had graduated from Chestnut Hill College. “Beyond his professional achievements, Billy will be fondly remembered for his unwavering work ethic, positive attitude, and kindness,” an Audacy spokesperson said.

                "title": "What we know about the victims of the New Orleans truck attack - The Washington Post",
                "content": "Among the 14 killed by a truck-driving assailant were parents of young children, a Superdome worker and a former Ivy League football player. Fourteen people were killed in the early hours of New Year’s Day when a man drove a pickup truck through a crowd of revelers on New Orleans’s Bourbon Street. The attack, which authorities said also injured dozens and is being investigated as an act of terrorism, turned a joyful scene on the famed nightlife corridor into one of terror and mayhem just hours after the new year began. The attacker, identified by the FBI as 42-year-old Shamsud-Din Jabbar, an Army veteran from Texas, died in a shootout with police. His victims included parents of young children, a Superdome worker and a former Ivy League football player, who were among the crowd that flocked the streets to celebrate the new year and an upcoming College Football Playoff game. Among those injured are two Israeli citizens, according to Israel’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and a University of Georgia student who is in critical condition, university president Jere Morehead said. Here is what we know about the slain victims who have been identified so far: Bill DiMaio hadn’t heard the news when one of his son’s friends called Wednesday morning to ask if he had heard about what happened. The friend told DiMaio that there’d been an attack while they had been celebrating New Year’s in New Orleans, and his 25-year-old son, Billy, was missing. DiMaio turned on the TV and along with millions of other Americans learned about a suspected terrorist attack that had killed or maimed dozens of revelers celebrating the chance to turn the page. He and his wife, Tracie, flew to New Orleans on Wednesday, went to University Medical Center and wished their son was among the injured who could not be identified because they were unconscious. “We still had hope,” DiMaio, 53, said. At 8 p.m., they got the news that their hopes would not be answered. Their son was among the 14 victims who had been killed. Billy was the eldest of the DiMaios’ three children. His father described the family as “very tight-knit,” and Billy as a “genuine, good-hearted person” who always looked out for his siblings. Billy grew up on Long Island until the ninth grade when the family moved just across from Manhattan to Holmdel, New Jersey, where he graduated high school. He attended Chestnut Hill College in Philadelphia where he was captain of the lacrosse team and earned a bachelor’s in business administration and then a master’s in organizational leadership, according to his father and his LinkedIn page. After college, Billy moved to New York, where he was working as an account executive at Audacy, a broadcasting company. He had earned a promotion within the past month, his father said. Billy went to New Orleans with friends to celebrate New Year’s with some of the group planning to attend the Sugar Bowl on Wednesday. DiMaio choked up when his attention was directed to a photo of Billy — one of him celebrating his 25th birthday with a chocolate frosted cake topped with candles and miniature beer cans. Above the cake, Billy smiled for the camera. “There’s no one like him,” his father said, crying. “He was one of a kind.” Baton Rouge resident Reggie Hunter, 37, only reluctantly agreed to head down to Bourbon Street to celebrate the New Year with his cousin, Shirell Jackson remembered Thursday. “His cousin called and just said, ‘Ride with me to the city, let’s ring in the new year,’” Jackson, also a cousin of Hunter’s, said. “He went on a whim. It was not in the plans.” That spur-of-the-moment decision placed Hunter and his cousin, Kevin Ball, directly in the pathway of the attacker who drove a truck down crowded Bourbon Street around 3:15 a.m. Wednesday, sending the New Year revelry into chaos and killing 14. Hunter died in the attack; Ball survived and is hospitalized. At first the family was hesitant to tell him that Hunter had died, Jackson said. “His whole concern was Reggie,” she said. “He kept saying, ‘y’all go check on Reggie because Reggie’s hurt bad.’” Jackson said that Hunter, the father of two sons, hailed from a close-knit Baton Rouge family of six siblings that has already known its share of tragedy: His mother, Youlanda, was murdered in a robbery at her workplace in 2016. He worked as a warehouse manager and had two sons, ages 11 and 2. He enjoyed attending school events surrounding his older son’s interest in STEM and robotics, Jackson said. “You’re going to remember him in the room because of a joke he told or his attire,” she said. “He was really, really funny. Like if you were to slip and fall he’s going to help you up but he’s laughing at you the whole time, like, ‘How did you do that?’ ” she said. Hunter loved fashion and always had to look just so, his clothes of bold colors always perfectly pressed and dry-cleaned, Jackson recalled. “We can’t say Reggie without saying fashion,” she said. “For him presentation was everything. Even if it’s hot he’s going to have the pink polo and the pink polo socks with white sneakers and a matching hat.” The family gathered on Christmas Day to play bingo and feast on the typical Baton Rouge holiday fare — turkey, ham and gumbo. Hunter was enjoying the event, she said, but he was sad too, missing his mom and other family members who had died. “He said, ‘I’m glad everybody is here but this [stuff] never gets any easier,’” she recalled. “He was missing his departed relatives, she said, “and now we’re going to be missing him too.” Matthew Tenedorio, 25, was killed not by being rammed by the pickup truck but when he was gunned down by its driver, his mother, Cathy Tenedorio, told The Post. Tenedorio, 64, said she last saw her youngest son the night of New Year’s Eve. They had gathered at his 27-year-old brother Jeremy’s house in Slidell for a paella dinner with part of the Tenedorio clan, including Tenedorio’s husband, Louis; Jeremy’s wife; and her baby daughter — Matthew’s new niece. They laughed, set off fireworks and wished each other a happy new year. Around 9 p.m., Matthew and his friend left to ring in the new year in the French Quarter despite his father’s objections. “​​They just had to go into New Orleans,” Tenedorio said. “It’s just the thing here — young people going into the Quarter.” Matthew hugged and kissed his mother as he left. “I’ll call you tomorrow,” she recalled him saying. “Don’t worry, I’ll be fine.” Then, he didn’t come home, and Tenedorio started calling the friends she knew Matthew had gone with. When she got one on the line, they told her “something terrible” had happened and said they’d gotten separated from Matthew during the ensuing chaos. When the attack started, his two friends had gotten shoved into different bars as they watched a pickup truck hit someone and then saw the truck driver get out and start shooting, the friends told Tenedorio. They hadn’t been able to reach Matthew since. Tenedorio called as many New Orleans area hospitals as she could find, none of which had her son as a patient. Then, she called the one she knew functioned as a morgue; employees there told her that her son was dead. Tenedorio described her son as full of life and the life of the party. He always tried to make other people feel comfortable. Matthew was an audiovisual technician at the Caesars Superdome, working on the production team that creates video packages for the New Orleans Saints football and Pelicans basketball teams, according to the Saints. “Matthew was young, talented, and had a bright future,” the Saints said in a statement. Tenedorio described it as her son’s “dream job.” When he wasn’t working, Matthew liked to skateboard and walk his German shepherd, Brutus — and sometimes do both at the same time, his mom said. “We’re just broken,” she said. “We’re — I just don’t even know how to go on.” Nicole Perez, 27, a doting mother who had just received a promotion at work and moved into a new apartment with her 4-year-old son, was one of the victims of the attack, said Kimberly Usher-Fall, Perez’s employer, who was close to her and her family. Perez had gone to Bourbon Street to celebrate the new year with friends and died after being struck by the truck that barreled down the street, Usher-Fall said. “I’m going to miss her,” Usher-Fall told said. “I really loved helping her. I wanted her to be successful. I really did.” Perez managed a deli owned by Usher-Fall in Metairie, near New Orleans, and brought her son Melvin to work when he was off from school, Usher-Fall said. In between work, Perez read to Melvin in a storage room in the deli, teaching him math and the alphabet. “She was a really good mom,” Usher-Fall said. Perez had worked her way up from being a server at the store and had dreams of owning her own business, Usher-Fall said. Her death devastated her family at the start of a year when they were looking forward to another new beginning. Perez’s older sister, who is eight months pregnant, and her mother were both admitted to a hospital Monday due to stress after learning of Perez’s death, Usher-Fall said. “She really was a good kid, man, she really was,” Usher-Fall said. “ … She was just getting her apartment. She was just getting everything going, and she’s gone, just gone.” Michelle Bech had dinner with her son Martin “Tiger” Bech in New Orleans on Tuesday night, before he went out with his best friend for New Year’s Eve. Hours later, she was telling him she loved him as he lay dying in a hospital bed after being hit by a truck. Describing the 27-year-old former Princeton football player turned junior bond trader as a “firework,” Bech started crying. “I guess his light just knew it was too much, too fast,” she said. “He was so bright, a really cool kid.” The oldest of her four children, Tiger lived for imparting his football knowledge — he was an All-Ivy League kick returner — on his younger brother Jack Bech, their mom said. Jack was a wide receiver for Texas Christian University before recently declaring for the draft. Bech said her family searched for Tiger on Wednesday morning after they could not reach him. When they found him listed as a John Doe at a hospital, his head was swollen and the internal bleeding too great. All Bech could do is tell him how proud she was of him. His best friend from Princeton is also in a hospital with injuries from the attack, Bech said, and is devastated to know Tiger is gone. The two had worked together at Seaport Global in New York City, a job that her son had loved, Bech said. The friends had stayed in Louisiana a little longer over the holidays so they could hunt and fish. They were supposed to be on an 11 a.m. flight back to New York on Wednesday morning. Tiger was originally from Lafayette, Louisiana, and had gone this summer to the running of the bulls in Pamplona, Spain. He also enjoyed traveling to Greece, the Spanish island of Ibiza and France. “He was on top of the world,” his mother said. “They were just in the wrong place at the wrong time.” Kareem Badawi was killed in the New Orleans attack, according to his family and schools. “It is with great sadness and sorrow, and with hearts satisfied with Allah’s decree and destiny, I mourn the news of the death of my son Kareem Bilal Badawi early this morning following the tragic incident in New Orleans,” Badawi’s father, Belal Badawi, posted on Facebook on Wednesday night. “We ask Allah Almighty to bestow his mercy on him, and grant us patience and strength to overcome this.” Badawi was a student at the University of Alabama; an earlier Facebook post by his father said he graduated from high school in May. “I grieve alongside family and friends of Kareem in their heartbreaking loss,” University of Alabama president Stuart Bell said in a statement. Badawi graduated from the Episcopal School of Baton Rouge in 2024, the school said, adding that another graduate, Parker Vidrine, was injured in the Bourbon Street attack. The Palestinian Youth Movement, a grassroots organization with chapters around the world, identified Badawi as a Palestinian American and described him as a “star athlete in high school” who “was beloved to all in his community in Baton Rouge.” Drew Dauphin, 26, a resident of Birmingham, was in New Orleans to attend a concert of the bluegrass musician Billy Strings and celebrate New Year’s Eve when he was killed, his family members said. “It’s unbelievable,” the Dauphin family said in a statement. “Who should have to come up with words for this? Our family is suffering more than anyone can imagine. “Our family is numb and in shock through this horrific and senseless tragedy,” the statement continued. Drew “lit up every room he entered” with his “infectious” smile and was happiest boating on Lake Martin with his little brother, Matthew, the family said. “We cherish the 26 years that we had with him and raising him will always be one of the greatest joys of our lives,” the family said. “We did not get to spend enough time with him and can’t believe we will never see him again this side of heaven.” Dauphin worked as a supplier process engineer for American Honda Motor Company, according to his LinkedIn profile, and was a 2023 graduate of Auburn University with a degree in industrial and systems engineering. “Words cannot convey the sorrow the Auburn Family feels for Drew’s family and friends during this unimaginably difficult time,’’ Auburn University President Christopher B. Roberts said in a statement. “Our thoughts are with the Dauphin family and the families of all the victims of this senseless tragedy.” Hubert Gauthreaux, 21, was also killed in the attack, his school said. He graduated in 2021 from Archbishop Shaw High School, just across the river from New Orleans, in Marrero, the school said. Friends and acquaintances remembered him on the school’s Facebook post as a “wonderful young man” and a “great kid.” A previous version of this article incorrectly said that Martin Bech was 28. He was 27. The article has been corrected.",

                "title": "\n    At least 14 killed, dozens hurt on Bourbon Street in New Orleans as driver intentionally slams truck into crowd; attacker dead - CBS News",
                "content": "Watch CBS News By Tucker Reals, Kerry Breen Updated on: January 2, 2025 / 8:02 PM EST / CBS News Update: The FBI said Thursday, Jan. 2, there does not appear to be evidence of any accomplices. Read the latest on the investigation here. A man intentionally drove a pickup truck into a crowd of revelers on Bourbon Street in New Orleans' French Quarter in a deadly rampage early on New Year's Day. At least 14 people were killed before the attacker died in a shootout with police, officials said. Dozens of others were injured in the attack. A black ISIS flag was flying from the truck's rear bumper, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation called the attack an act of terrorism. The man driving the vehicle has been identified as Shamsud-Din Jabbar, 42, a U.S. citizen from Texas, the FBI said. In televised remarks Wednesday evening, President Biden said the FBI has determined that just hours before the attack, Jabbar \"posted videos to social media indicating that he was inspired by ISIS, expressing a desire to kill.\" The vehicle was an electric Ford pickup truck that appears to have been rented, the FBI said. Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said on social media Jabbar rented the truck on Dec. 30, while living in the Houston area, before heading to New Orleans. FBI Deputy Assistant Director Christopher Raia said at a news conference Thursday that the attack was an act of terrorism. \"It was premeditated and an evil act,\" he said. While the FBI initially thought Jabbar may have had help carrying out the attack, Raia said that as of Thursday the bureau believes no one else was involved. A person familiar with the investigation told CBS News that at this point, neither ISIS nor any other foreign terror organization has claimed responsibility for the attack. The attacker drove around barricades and up onto the sidewalk of Bourbon Street, New Orleans Police Department Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick said, avoiding barriers that had been placed by police. Kirkpatrick said the man \"was trying to run over as many people as he could.\" \"We had a car there, we had barriers there, we had officers there, and he still got around,\" Kirkpatrick said. The man then exited the car and opened fire on officers, Raia said. He died after exchanging gunfire with three responding officers, the FBI said. He was struck by police fire and declared dead at the scene, the New Orleans Police Department said. Two police officers were hit by gunfire and treated at a hospital. Weapons and two potential improvised explosive devices, or IEDs, were located in the vehicle, FBI Special Agent Alethea Duncan said at a news conference Wednesday. On Thursday, Raia gave more details on the explosives, saying FBI bomb technicians found two functional IEDs in coolers in the area. Jabbar is seen placing the devices in surveillance video footage, Raia said. Both devices were rendered safe, and two other items were determined to not be IEDs, he said. Kirkpatrick said police walked the area as a grid, looking for any suspicious items. Anyone who sees anything suspicious should contact officials, Duncan said. Two law enforcement sources told CBS News that the suspect had an AR-15 style weapon and a handgun with him at the time of the truck attack. The long gun had a \"suppressive device\" on it that acted as a silencer, according to sources on the scene. Two sources familiar with the investigation told CBS News the man was wearing body armor. Investigators from the FBI, Homeland Security and bomb squad have all been on the scene at an Airbnb in the St. Roch area of New Orleans, where officials tell CBS News the suspect was staying while in New Orleans. That building caught fire on Wednesday and the investigation into that fire is ongoing. Duncan asked that anyone with information about the man contact the FBI. A U.S. official confirmed to CBS News that he had previously served in the U.S. military. Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry called it \"a horrific act of violence\" and said he and his wife were \"praying for all the victims and first responders on scene.\" He urged people to avoid the area. \"As of now, 15 people are deceased. It will take several days to perform all autopsies. Once we complete the autopsies and talk with the next of kin, we will release the identifications of the victims,\" New Orleans Coroner Dr. Dwight McKenna said in a statement. The coroner's office later clarified that the 15 dead included the attacker. The popular tourist district was full of New Year's Day revelers at the time of the attack. Witnesses told CBS News reporter Kati Weis that a white truck crashed into people on Bourbon Street at high speed, and the driver then started firing a weapon from inside the vehicle, with police returning fire. Weis saw multiple people on the ground being treated for injuries near the intersection of Bourbon and Canal Streets. The City of New Orleans said in a statement posted online that 30 people were transported to area hospitals with injuries and 10 people were confirmed dead. Kirkpatrick later said that at least 35 people were hospitalized. \"He was hellbent on creating the carnage and the damage that he did,\" Kirkpatrick said. Duncan said the FBI will be leading the investigation. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Justice Department's National Security Division and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Louisiana will work with the FBI and local officials to support the investigation, Attorney General Merrick Garland said. Mr. Biden was briefed about the attack, the White House said, and his administration has been in touch with Cantrell to offer support. Mr. Biden said in a statement he has directed his administration to \"ensure every resource is available as federal, state, and local law enforcement work assiduously to get to the bottom of what happened as quickly as possible and to ensure that there is no remaining threat of any kind.\" \"My heart goes out to the victims and their families who were simply trying to celebrate the holiday,\" Mr. Biden said. \"There is no justification for violence of any kind, and we will not tolerate any attack on any of our nation's communities.\" President-elect Donald Trump also acknowledged the attack in a post on TruthSocial. \"Our hearts are with all of the innocent victims and their loved ones, including the brave officers of the New Orleans Police Department,\" Trump said, in part. The Sugar Bowl college football playoff game was set to be played at the nearby Superdome later Wednesday, but has been rescheduled for Thursday. Kirkpatrick said bomb sweeps have been conducted at the Superdome, and said the stadium would be locked down until the game. Jeff Hundley, the chief executive officer of the Sugar Bowl, announced the delay at Thursday's news conference. More details about the rescheduled game will be available in the coming hours, he said. \"We live in the fun and games world, with what we do, but we certainly recognize the importance of this and we're going to support it 100%,\" Hundley said. A student from the University of Georgia, one of the teams playing in the game, was \"critically injured\" in the attack, according to a statement from the school on social media. The student was not identified. Jim and Nicole Mowrer were in New Orleans visiting from Iowa and witnessed the incident. The couple told CBS News they had watched the city's fireworks display and were enjoying the New Year's Day atmosphere in the French Quarter when they heard crashing noises coming from down the street. They said they then saw a white truck slam through a barricade \"at a high rate of speed,\" followed by gunfire and police. The couple said the truck hit people about a block away from where they had been walking. \"Once the gunfire stopped, we stayed in the alcove until the gunfire stopped, came out into the street, and came across a lot of — several people who had been hit, [we] wanted to see what we could do to help,\" Nicole Mowrer said. She said the couple found the victims had died. The Mowrers said the victims they saw had injuries from the truck impact, and they did not see any apparent gunshot wounds. They said they left the area once emergency responders started arriving. In a 2017 memo reviewed by CBS News, the city of New Orleans had acknowledged the risk of a mass casualty incident in the crowded, tourist-friendly French Quarter. The memo specifically referenced vehicle attacks in Nice, France, London, England and New York City. To minimize risk, the city said it planned to establish a camera and surveillance program, a centralized command center, more police patrols and infrastructure upgrades. The city had been in the process of upgrading the pedestrian bollard system in the French Quarter to modernize and bolster protections, with work ongoing through February.

                "title": "Notre Dame Fighting Irish football - Wikipedia",
                "content": "The Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team is the college football team representing the University of Notre Dame in Notre Dame, Indiana, north of the city of South Bend, Indiana. The team plays its home games at the campus's Notre Dame Stadium, which has a capacity of 77,622. Notre Dame is one of three schools that competes as an Independent at the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) level; however, they play five games a year against opponents from the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), of which Notre Dame is a member in all other sports except ice hockey.[5] The Fighting Irish are among the most prestigious college football teams of all time. Since their inaugural season in 1887, Notre Dame has claimed 11 national championships, including 8 from the major wire-service: AP Poll and/or Coaches' Poll.[6] Seven Notre Dame players have won the Heisman Trophy. Notre Dame has 948 official victories, with an additional 21 having been vacated by the NCAA in 2016 for self-reported academic misconduct.[7] Notre Dame has had 22 undefeated seasons including 12 perfect seasons.[8] Notre Dame home games have been televised by NBC since 1991.[9][10] Football did not have an auspicious beginning at the University of Notre Dame. In their inaugural game on November 23, 1887, the Irish lost to Michigan by a score of 8–0.[11] Their first win came in the final game of the 1888 season when the Irish defeated Harvard Prep School of Chicago by a score of 20–0.[12] At the end of the 1888 season, they had a record of 1–3 with all three losses being at the hands of Michigan. Between 1887 and 1899, Notre Dame compiled a record of 31 wins, 15 losses, and 4 ties against a diverse variety of opponents ranging from local high school teams to other universities.[13] In 1894, James L. Morrison was hired as Notre Dame's first head football coach.[14] Notre Dame took a significant step toward respectability, prominence, and stability when they hired Morrison.[15] He wrote an acquaintance after his first day on the job: \"I arrived here [Notre Dame] this morning and found about as green a set of football players that ever donned a uniform... They want to smoke, and when I told them that they would have to run and get up some wind, they thought I was rubbing it in on them. \"One big, strong cuss remarked that it was too much like work. Well, maybe you think I didn't give him hell! I bet you a hundred no one ever makes a remark like that again.\"[15] In 1908, the win over Franklin saw end Fay Wood catch the first touchdown pass in Notre Dame history.[16] Notre Dame continued its success near the turn of the century and achieved their first victory over Michigan in 1909 by the score of 11–3, after which Michigan refused to play Notre Dame again for 33 years. By the end of the 1912 season they had amassed a record of 108 wins, 31 losses, and 13 ties.[17] Jesse Harper became head coach in 1913, coaching for five years until retiring in 1917.[18] During his tenure, the Irish began playing only intercollegiate games and posted a record of 34 wins, five losses, and one tie.[19] This period would also mark the beginning of the rivalry with Army and the continuation of rivalry with Michigan State.[20][21] In an effort to gain respect for a regionally successful but small-time Midwestern football program, Harper scheduled games in his first season with national powerhouses Texas, Penn State, and Army.[22] That year, Notre Dame burst into the national consciousness and helped to transform the collegiate game in a single contest. On November 1, 1913, the Notre Dame squad stunned the Black Knights of the Hudson 35–13 in a game played at West Point.[23] Led by quarterback Gus Dorais and end Knute Rockne, the Notre Dame team attacked the Cadets with an offense that featured both the expected powerful running game but also long and accurate downfield forward passes from Dorais to Rockne. This game has been miscredited as the invention of the forward pass.[24] Prior to this contest, receivers would come to a full stop and wait on the ball to come to them, but in this contest, Dorais threw to Rockne in stride, changing the forward pass from a seldom-used play into the dominant ball-moving strategy that it is today.[24][23] Irish assistant Knute Rockne became head coach in 1918.[25] During his 13 years, the Irish won three national championships, had five undefeated seasons, won the Rose Bowl in 1925,[26] and produced players such as George Gipp and the \"Four Horsemen\".[27] Rockne's offenses employed the Notre Dame Box and his defenses ran a 7–2–2 scheme.[28][29] Rockne took over in the war-torn season of 1918[30] He made his coaching debut on September 28, 1918, against Case Tech in Cleveland, Ohio, and earned a 26–6 victory.[31] Leonard Bahan, George Gipp, and Curly Lambeau were in the backfield.[32][33] With Gipp, Rockne had an ideal handler of the forward pass.[34][35] The Irish posted a 3–1–2 record for the season, losing only to the Michigan Agricultural Aggies. The 1919 team had Rockne handle the line and Gus Dorais handle the backfield.[36] The Irish went undefeated and were one of four teams to be selected for the national championship, although Notre Dame does not claim it.[37][38] Gipp died at age 25 on December 14, 1920,[39] just two weeks after Walter Camp elected him as Notre Dame's first All-American.[40][39] Gipp likely contracted strep throat and pneumonia while giving punting lessons after his final game on November 20 against Northwestern.[40] Since antibiotics were not available in the 1920s, treatment options for such infections were limited and they could be fatal even to young, healthy individuals.[41] Rockne was speaking to Gipp on his hospital bed when he was purported to have delivered the famous \"Win one for the Gipper\" line.[42][39][43][44][45] John Mohardt led the 1921 Notre Dame team to a 10–1 record with 781 rushing yards, 995 passing yards, 12 rushing touchdowns, and nine passing touchdowns.[46] Grantland Rice wrote that \"Mohardt could throw the ball to within a foot or two of any given space\" and noted that the 1921 Notre Dame team \"was the first team we know of to build its attack around a forward passing game, rather than use a forward passing game as a mere aid to the running game.\"[47] Mohardt had both Eddie Anderson and Roger Kiley at end to receive his passes.[48][49] The national champion 1924 team included the \"Four Horsemen\" backfield of Harry Stuhldreher, Don Miller, Jim Crowley, and Elmer Layden.[50][51] The line was known as the \"Seven Mules\".[52] The Irish capped an undefeated, 10–0 season with a victory over Stanford in the Rose Bowl.[26] The 1926 team beat Army and was led by Christie Flanagan,[53][54] but was undone by a loss to Carnegie Tech in the penultimate game of the season. In this game, Rockne made what an Associated Press writer called \"one of the greatest coaching blunders in history\" by traveling to Chicago for the Army–Navy Game to \"write newspaper articles about it, as well as select an All-America football team.\" Carnegie Tech used the coach's absence as motivation for a 19–0 win; the upset likely cost the Irish a chance for a national title.[55] The 1928 team lost to national champion Georgia Tech.[56] \"I sat at Grant Field and saw a magnificent Notre Dame team suddenly recoil before the furious pounding of one man–Peter Pund,\" said Rockne. \"Nobody could stop him. I counted 20 scoring plays that this man ruined.\"[57] Among the events that occurred during Rockne's tenure none may be more famous than the Rockne's \"Win one for the Gipper\" speech.[58] Army came into the 1928 matchup undefeated and was the clear favorite.[59] Notre Dame, on the other hand, was having their worst season under Rockne's leadership and entered the game with a 4–2 record.[59] At the end of the half Army was leading and looked to be in command of the game. Rockne entered the locker room and gave his account of Gipp's final words: \"I've got to go, Rock. It's all right. I'm not afraid. Some time, Rock, when the team is up against it, when things are going wrong and the breaks are beating the boys, tell them to go in there with all they've got and win just one for the Gipper. I don't know where I'll be then, Rock. But I'll know about it, and I'll be happy.\"[60] The speech inspired the team and they went on to upset Army and win the game 12–6.[61] The 1929 and 1930 teams both went undefeated,[62][63] winning national championships,[64][65] and the 1930 team was led by the likes of Frank Carideo, Joe Savoldi, Marchy Schwartz and Marty Brill.[65] It featured the first and only example of all four members of a backfield being named to an All-American team during the same season. The 1929 team played all of its games on the road while the new Notre Dame Stadium was being built.[66] In 1930, \"Jumping Joe\" Savoldi scored the first Notre Dame touchdown in the new stadium on a 98-yard kickoff return.[67] Savoldi is also known as \"the first hero in the lore of Notre Dame's Stadium\" based on scoring three touchdowns in the official stadium dedication game against Navy the following week.[68] Rockne coached his last game on December 14, 1930, when he led a group of Notre Dame all-stars against the New York Giants in New York City.[69][70] The game raised funds for the Mayor's Relief Committee for the unemployed and needy of the city.[71] 50,000 fans turned out to see the reunited \"Four Horsemen\" along with players from Rockne's other championship teams take the field against the pros.[72] On March 31, 1931, Rockne died at age 43 in the crash of a Transcontinental & Western Air airliner in Kansas; he was on his way to help in the production of the film The Spirit of Notre Dame.[73][74][75] The crash site is located in a remote expanse of Kansas known as the Flint Hills and now features a Rockne Memorial.[76] As Notre Dame's head coach from 1918 to 1930, Rockne posted what has remained for decades the all-time highest winning percentage (.881) for a football coach in the NCAA's flagship FBS division.[77][78] During his 13-year tenure as head coach of the Fighting Irish, Rockne collected 105 victories, 12 losses, 5 ties and 3 national championships.[79][80] Rockne also coached Notre Dame to 5 undefeated and untied seasons.[79][80] Through game broadcasts during the Golden Age of Radio, Notre Dame football gained a nationwide following of \"subway alumni\", Catholics who became fans whether or not they attended the university.[81] Former Saint Louis head coach Heartley \"Hunk\" Anderson was promoted from assistant coach and took the helm of the Irish after Knute Rockne's death, leading them to a record of 16 wins, nine losses, and two ties.[82] Anderson was a former Irish player under Rockne and was serving as an assistant coach at the time of Rockne's death. Notre Dame finished 6–2–1 in 1931.[83] The Irish lost a heartbreaker by a score of 16–14 to USC on November 21 that snapped the program's 26-game unbeaten streak.[84] 1933 was a tough year for the Irish as they finished with a 3–5–2 record, the first losing season for the program since 1888. ND suffered a four-game losing streak, failing to score a point in all four losses to Carnegie Tech, Pittsburgh, Navy, and Purdue.[85] Anderson resigned as Irish head coach after the 1933 season to accept the position of head football coach at NC State.[86] Anderson was replaced by Elmer Layden, who was one of Rockne's \"Four Horsemen\" in the 1920s. After graduating, Layden played professional football for one year and then began a coaching career.[87] Layden's 1935 squad posted one of the greatest wins in school history by rallying to defeat Ohio State by a score of 18–13 in a game billed as the \"Game of the Century\".[88][89] His 1938 team finished 8–1, losing only to USC in the season finale.[90] This loss cost them a possible consensus national championship, but the team was named national champion by the Dickinson System.[91] Like Rockne before him, Layden was a goodwill ambassador for Notre Dame during his time as head coach.[92][93] He was able to schedule a home-and-home series with Michigan after meeting with Fielding H. Yost, healing a rift between the two schools.[94] The two teams had not met since 1909, when, after eight straight losses to the Wolverines, the Irish posted their first win.[95][96] They were scheduled to meet again in 1910, but Michigan canceled the game and refused to play the Irish again.[96] By the time they met again in 1943, Layden had left Notre Dame and Frank Leahy had taken his place.[96] The Irish posted a record of 47 wins, 13 losses, and three ties in seven years under Layden,[97] the most successful record of a Notre Dame coach not to win a national championship.[98] He left Notre Dame after the 1940 season to become Commissioner of the National Football League.[98][87] Boston College head coach Frank Leahy was hired by Notre Dame to take over for Layden in 1941 and was another former Irish player who played during the Rockne era. After graduating from Notre Dame, Leahy held several coaching positions, including line coach of the Seven Blocks of Granite of Fordham University that helped that team win all but two of their games between 1935 and 1937.[99] He then coached the Boston College Eagles to a win in the 1941 Sugar Bowl and a share of the national championship.[100][101] His move to Notre Dame began a new period of gridiron success for the Irish and ensured Leahy's place among the winningest coaches in the history of college football.[102] Leahy coached the team for 11 seasons from 1941 to 1943 and 1946 to 1953.[99] After finishing in the AP top 10 each of his first two seasons, Leahy's 1943 team went 9–1 and captured Notre Dame's fourth national championship (and first since the advent of the AP Poll). Quarterback Angelo Bertelli became Notre Dame's first Heisman Trophy winner. From 1944 to 1945, Leahy served in the U.S. Navy during World War II and was honorably discharged as a captain.[103] Edward McKeever, Leahy's assistant coach, became interim head coach when Leahy left for the Navy.[104] During 1944, his one year at the helm, the Irish managed 8 wins and 2 losses.[105] McKeever left Notre Dame in 1945 to take over as head coach of Cornell.[106] For the 1945 season, he was replaced by Hugh Devore, who led the Irish to a 7–2–1 record.[107] Upon Leahy's return in 1946 and due to his status as a veteran himself, the Irish heavily recruited returning veterans who were often much older than incoming freshmen. Largely thanks to this influx of talent, Notre Dame went four consecutive seasons after World War II without losing a game, winning the 1946, 1947, and 1949 national championships in the process.[108] The 1946 game against Army, ending in a 0–0 tie, pitted two of the greatest teams of all time against each other and included three consecutive Heisman Trophy winners (Army's Doc Blanchard and Glenn Davis and Notre Dame's Johnny Lujack, who quarterbacked the 1946 and 1947 Irish). The 1948 team missed out on a national championship due only to a 14–14 tie at USC in the final game of the season. In 1949, Notre Dame went unbeaten and untied for the second time in three seasons behind Heisman Trophy-winning end Leon Hart, who would later be selected first overall in the 1950 NFL Draft. A fifth national championship was lost because of a 1953 tie against Iowa, in a game that featured 1953 Heisman Trophy winner Johnny Lattner[109] that caused a minor scandal at the time, when it appeared that some Irish players had faked injuries to stop the clock, leading some to nickname those players the \"Fainting Irish\".[110][111][112] Leahy retired in 1954 reportedly due to health issues.[113] Perhaps the best example of this occurred during the Georgia Tech game in 1953. Leahy fell ill during the game, which led to him collapsing during halftime.[114][self-published source] The situation was so dire that a priest was called in to give Leahy Catholic last rites.[115] However, Leahy recovered, and the consequent diagnosis was that he was suffering from nervous tension and pancreatitis.[116] Leahy has the second highest winning percentage (.864) of any college coach in history. He led the Irish to a record of 87 wins, 11 losses, and nine ties including 39 consecutive games without a loss (37–0–2), four national championships, and six undefeated seasons.[102][117] The departure of Frank Leahy ushered in a downward slope in Notre Dame's performance.[118] 25-year old assistant coach Terry Brennan was hired as Frank Leahy's successor as the Notre Dame head coach in 1954 and would stay until 1958. Brennan was a former player under Leahy. Before joining the Irish, he had coached the Mount Carmel High School team in Chicago.[119] His first two seasons the Irish were ranked fourth and ninth respectively in the AP poll, with a loss to Purdue the only blemish on the 1954 team's schedule.[119][120] It was the 1956 season that began to darken Brennan's reputation, for it became one of the most dismal in the team's history and saw them finish the season with a mere two wins, including losses to Michigan State, Oklahoma, and Iowa.[121] One bright spot in the 1956 season was the awarding of the Heisman Trophy to Paul Hornung, who would go on to a legendary NFL career with the Green Bay Packers. Hornung is the only Heisman winner to win the award while playing for a team that had a losing record.[122] The Irish would recover the following season, posting a record of 7–3[123] and including in their wins a stunning upset of Oklahoma, in Norman, Oklahoma, that ended the Sooners' still-standing record of 47 consecutive wins.[124] In Brennan's final season, though, the Irish finished 6–4,[125] leading to Brennan's firing in mid-December.[126] Brennan's tenure can only be properly framed with the understanding that in a time of zero scholarship limitations in college football, Notre Dame's administration inexplicably began a process of de-emphasizing football, severely cutting scholarships and hindering Brennan from building a roster of any meaningful depth.[127] He departed with a total of 32 wins and 18 losses.[128] Former San Francisco, Chicago Cardinals and Washington Redskins head coach Joe Kuharich took the head coaching position at Notre Dame in 1959, realizing a longtime ambition to return to his alma mater.[129][130] He had earlier been courted by Notre Dame after the 1956 season, after the Irish finished 2–8, but before he had a chance to accept an offer, Terry Brennan was given a reprieve.[131] Kuharich brought a professional touch to Irish football, putting shamrocks on the players' helmets and shoulder stripes on their jerseys.[131][132] However, his tenure became one of the worst stretches in program history, including a school-record eight-game losing streak in 1960, a year in which the Irish finished 2–8.[133] The consensus opinion was that Kuharich never made the adjustment from pro football to college football, attempting to use complicated pro coaching techniques with collegiate players, and never adapted to the limited substitution rules in effect at the time, having big, immobile linemen playing both ways in an era where smaller, quicker players were preferred. He often said, \"You win some and you lose some\", and seemed perfectly content finishing 5–5 every year. This did not sit well with the Irish faithful, who expected Notre Dame to beat everybody.[134] When the pressure of winning became too much to bear, Kuharich resigned in the spring of 1963 and assumed the post of supervisor of NFL officials.[131] Because it was so late in the spring, the freshman team's coach Hugh Devore was named head coach for the 1963 season while the search for a permanent replacement was being conducted.[135] Kuharich compiled a 17–23 record over four non-winning seasons and remains to this day the only coach ever to have an overall losing record at Notre Dame. Despite his unsuccessful tenure, Kuharich remains the only Irish coach to post back-to-back shutouts over their greatest rival, the USC Trojans, in 1960 (17–0) and 1961 (30–0).[136] In 1964, Ara Parseghian left his job as the Northwestern head football coach when he was hired to take over the coaching duties at Notre Dame.[137] He immediately brought the team back to a level of success in Irish football history that was comparable only to Rockne and Leahy. These three coaches have an 80% or greater winning percentage while at Notre Dame – Rockne at .881, Leahy at .864, and Parseghian at .836. Parseghian's teams never won fewer than seven nor lost more than three games during the ten-game regular seasons of the era.[138] In his first year, the Irish improved their record to 9–1 behind Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback John Huarte, but they lost any hope for a national championship in the last game of the season at USC when Craig Fertig connected with a touchdown pass to Rod Sherman.[139] Parseghian earned coach of the year honors from the American Football Coaches Association, the Football Writers Association, and The Sporting News, as well as several others, and a cover story in Time magazine.[140][141] The 1966 team did finish unbeaten, finishing #1 in the AP Poll and winning the national championship in the process. The Irish had six shutout wins, each by 30 or more points. This includes a season-ending 51-0 win at #10 USC, the largest margin of victory by either side in the rivalry's history. This season is most remembered for a 10–10 tie at #2 Michigan State in the \"Game of the Century\" in which the injury-plagued Irish played for a tie rather than risking a loss.[142] It was under Parseghian as well that Notre Dame lifted its 40-plus year-old \"no bowl games\" policy,[143] beginning with the season of 1969, after which the Irish played the #1 Texas Longhorns in the Cotton Bowl Classic, losing in the final minutes in a closely contested game.[144] The following year, Parseghian's 9–1 squad[145] ended Texas' Southwest Conference record 30-game winning streak in the Cotton Bowl.[144] In 1971, Cliff Brown became the first African-American quarterback to start a game for the program.[146] The Irish returned to glory by winning Parseghian's second national championship in 1973, sweeping through their regular-season schedule 10–0 and defeating #1 Alabama 24-23 in the Sugar Bowl by taking advantage of a fourth-quarter missed extra point by the Crimson Tide. Due to health issues, Parseghian was forced to retire from coaching after another bowl win over Alabama to conclude the 1974 season.[147] During Parseghian's eleven-year career, the Irish amassed a record of 95–17–4 and captured two national championships. The Irish finished in the AP Top 10 nine times and never ranked lower than #14 at the end of a season. Parseghian was also named coach of the year by several selectors in his national championship years of 1966 and 1973 and was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1980.[148][149] Dan Devine was hired to take over as head coach upon Parseghian's retirement from Notre Dame in 1975.[150] Devine was already a highly successful coach and had led Arizona State, Missouri, and the NFL's Green Bay Packers.[150] Devine had been a leading candidate for the head coaching job at Notre Dame in 1964, when Ara Parseghian was hired.[151] When approached for the job following Parseghian's resignation, Devine accepted immediately, joking that it was probably the shortest job interview in history.[152] When he arrived at Notre Dame he already had a college coaching record of 120 wins, 40 losses, and eight ties and had led his teams to victory in four bowl games.[153] At Notre Dame he would lead the Irish to 53 wins, 16 losses, and a tie as well as three bowl victories.[153] His lasting achievement came midway through this run, when the 1977 Notre Dame team won the national championship, led by junior quarterback Joe Montana.[154] Before the game against USC, played at home on October 22, Devine changed the team's jerseys from navy blue & white to kelly green & gold, later known as the \"green jersey game\", resulting in a 49–19 victory over the Trojans.[155] The Irish continued to wear green for the rest of Devine's tenure at the school.[155] The championship season climaxed with a 38–10 win in the 1978 Cotton Bowl Classic over previously top-ranked Texas, led by Heisman Trophy winner Earl Campbell.[156] The win vaulted the Irish from fifth to first in the polls. The following season, the Irish lost their first two games including a shocking 3–0 loss to Missouri in South Bend, but would recover to finish the regular season 8–3 and earn a berth in the Cotton Bowl against Houston. The Irish used three Montana touchdowns (two passing, one rushing) to recover from a 22-point deficit in the fourth quarter and win 35–34, the largest fourth-quarter comeback in college football history at the time. The game became known as the \"Chicken Soup Game\" after Montana ate a bowl of chicken soup at halftime while battling the flu.[157] The 1979 and 1980 Irish did not live up to the standards set by earlier Devine teams, although the former season did see Vagas Ferguson set the single-season program rushing record (1,437 yards) that still stands today. Because he had the unenviable task of following a legend, Devine came under heavy scrutiny while at Notre Dame and it was felt that he was never fully embraced by the Notre Dame community, despite winning a national championship.[158] After a 5–2 start in his first season, rumors of incompetence were circulated and that Devine would be dismissed and replaced by Don Shula or even Ara Parseghian (who went so far as to say he would not return to Notre Dame under any circumstances).[159] Even on the day of the 1977 USC game, \"Dump Devine\" bumper stickers were being sold outside Notre Dame Stadium.[159] On August 15, 1980, Devine announced that he would be leaving Notre Dame at the end of season, saying he wanted to be able to spend more time with his wife.[158] Gerry Faust was a surprise choice when hired to replace Devine in 1981.[160] Prior to Notre Dame, Faust had been one of the more successful high school football coaches in the country. As coach of Moeller High School in Cincinnati he amassed a 174–17–2 record over 19 seasons.[161] Many of his players had gone on to play for Notre Dame; indeed, when he arrived in South Bend, he was reunited with nine of his former players from Moeller. Despite his success in the high school ranks, Faust's success at Notre Dame was mixed. In his first season, the Irish finished 5–6.[162] In Faust's second season, Notre Dame improved slightly to 6–4–1.[163] The most successful years under Faust were the 1983 and 1984 campaigns where the Irish finished 7–5 and made trips to the Liberty Bowl and Aloha Bowl respectively.[164][165] His final record at Notre Dame was 30–26–1.[166] To avoid being fired, Faust resigned at the end of the 1985 season.[167][168] He announced his resignation prior to the final game of the year, where Notre Dame suffered a humiliating 58–7 loss at Miami; Allen Pinkett scored the Irish TD. Faust proceeded to take over as head coach at Akron.[169] Lou Holtz had 17 years of head coaching experience by the time he was hired to lead the Irish.[170] He had previously been head coach of William & Mary, North Carolina State, the NFL's New York Jets, Arkansas, and Minnesota.[170] In contrast to Faust, Holtz was well known as a master motivator and a strict disciplinarian.[171][172] The tone was set with Holtz's first meeting with his team as Irish head coach in 1986, immediately demanding his players sit up straight in their chairs and look him in the eye as he spoke.[173] Holtz began in 1986 where his predecessor left off in 1985, finishing with an identical record of 5–6.[174] However, unlike the 1985 squad, which was generally outcoached and outplayed, Holtz's 1986 edition was competitive in nearly every game, losing five out of those six games by a combined total of 14 points. That would be his only losing season as he posted a record of 95–24–2 over the next ten seasons adding up to a 100–30–2 record overall.[175][176] In 1987, Holtz led the Irish to an 8–4 record.[177] Notre Dame's best player was star wide receiver Tim Brown, who would win the Heisman Trophy that season and is Notre Dame's seventh and most recent Heisman winner.[178][179] The 1988 campaign began with high hopes, as former Notre Dame coaches Rockne, Leahy, Parseghian, and Devine all won their first national championship in their third season with the program. The Irish defeated their first five opponents, ascending to the #4 ranking in the lead-up to a visit from the reigning national champion Miami Hurricanes. In a game which became known as Catholics vs. Convicts due to a popular T-shirt design on Notre Dame's campus, the Irish upset the Hurricanes 31–30 when Pat Terrell knocked down Steve Walsh's two-point conversion attempt with no time on the clock. When star players Ricky Watters and Tony Brooks showed up late for dinner right before the then top-ranked Irish played second-ranked USC in the final regular season game of 1988,[180] in a controversial move, Holtz took his 10–0 Irish squad to Los Angeles without them.[181] His move was vindicated when the Irish defeated USC anyway.[182] Holtz was named national coach of the year,[170] and a win over No. 3 West Virginia in the Fiesta Bowl captured the Irish's 11th-all time national championship.[183] 1988 remains Notre Dame's most recent undefeated season and national championship.[184][185] In 1989, Holtz led the Irish to a 12–1 record. The Irish began the season in the Kickoff Classic game in East Rutherford, New Jersey, against Virginia.[186] The Irish won by a score of 36–13 and ascended to the #1 spot in the AP Poll.[187] Next, top-ranked Notre Dame defeated #2 Michigan by a score of 24–19.[188] After nine more consecutive victories to begin the season 11–0, the Irish would lose to #7 Miami in the final week of the season, ending Notre Dame's 23-game winning streak.[189] Holtz would lead the Irish to a victory in the Orange Bowl over #1 Colorado to end the season, finishing #2 in the AP poll behind Miami.[190] After beginning the 1990 season with a #1 ranking and a victory over #4 Michigan by a score of 28–24 and two more wins for a 3–0 start, the Irish took their first loss of the season, losing to Stanford by a score of 36–31. The Irish would ascend back to #1 on the strength of a home win over #2 Miami, a game that saw the end of the series between the two until 2010.[191] However, late-season losses to Penn State and Colorado in the Orange Bowl would eliminate the Irish from national championship contention.[192] The 1991 Fighting Irish began the season 8-1, but lost back-to-back games for the first time since 1987 when they again lost to Penn State. The Irish would receive a berth in the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans, Louisiana, where they defeated Florida by a score of 39–28.[193][194] In 1992, Notre Dame finished 10–1–1. After defeating Northwestern to start the season,[195] the Fighting Irish tied #5 Michigan, their first tie of the Holtz era.[196] This season saw the Irish's largest win in history against Purdue, a 48–0 win at Notre Dame Stadium, and a 28–3 Cotton Bowl against previously unbeaten #4 Texas A&M.[197][198] The Irish enjoyed another successful season in 1993, finishing the season at 11–1. After scoring 27 points in wins over Northwestern and #2 Michigan to start the season, the Irish defeated their next six opponents to enter a matchup with undefeated #1 Florida State 8–0 and ranked just behind the Seminoles at #2. For the first time, ESPN's College GameDay decided to make a visit to campus to host the show live on Saturday morning.[199] In a classic, the Irish defeated the Seminoles 31–24, ascending to the #1 ranking a day later. However, a loss to #17 Boston College on a game-winning field goal as time expired by a score of 41–39 ended the Irish's national championship aspirations.[200] The Irish would face a rematch with #6 Texas A&M in the Cotton Bowl to finish the season, a game the Irish won by a score of 24–21.[201][202] Controversially, Notre Dame finished #2 in the AP poll behind a team in Florida State it had beaten. In 1994, Holtz led Notre Dame to a 6–5–1 record, the Irish's worst record since Holtz's first season in 1986.[203] The team lost three of four games midseason to drop out of the rankings for the first time since 1986. The Irish would improve to 9–3 in 1995, but lost to #8 Florida State in the Orange Bowl.[204][205] Lou Holtz's final season at Notre Dame in 1996 resulted in an 8–3 record. The season notably saw Notre Dame's first participation in the Emerald Isle Classic in Ireland, a 54–27 win over Navy, and an overtime loss to USC, snapping the Irish's 13-game non-losing streak against the Trojans.[206][207] Holtz's option offense, which helped catapult Notre Dame to many victories in the late 1980s and early 1990s, also helped rack up impressive recruiting classes. During the 1989 season, Holtz had the following future NFL players on offense: QB Rick Mirer, RB Ricky Watters, RB Anthony Johnson, RB Rodney Culver RB Dorsey Levens, and WR Raghib Ismail. In 1990, he added RB Jeff Burris (who would later move to safety), FB Jerome Bettis and TE Irv Smith. 1991 saw the additions of RB Reggie Brooks and FB Ray Zellars. 1992 saw the addition of WR Derrick Mayes. For 1993, he added FB Marc Edwards. In 1995, he added RB Autry Denson. From the 1987–1995 NFL Drafts, there were a total of 65 Notre Dame players selected.[208] Overall, Holtz took Notre Dame to one undefeated season, nine consecutive New Year's Day bowl games, and top 10 finishes in the AP poll in five seasons,[209] as well as overseeing the majority of the longest winning streak against USC in program history (11 games). Holtz retired from Notre Dame following the 1996 season,[210] but would unretire in 1999 to accept the head coaching position at South Carolina where he would serve until the completion of the 2004 season.[211][212] Bob Davie, who had been Holtz's defensive coordinator from 1994 to 1996, was promoted to head coach when Holtz retired.[213] Davie, who turned down a head coaching offer from Purdue to accept the Irish's head coaching position,[214] was a well-respected defensive mind who had also served as defensive coordinator at Tulane and Texas A&M.[215] Davie had also filled in as head coach for one game during the 1995 season when Lou Holtz was dealing with a health issue.[216] One of his first major decisions was to fire long-time offensive line coach Joe Moore, who then successfully sued the university for age discrimination.[217] On Davie's watch, the team suffered three bowl game losses (1997 Independence Bowl,[218] 1999 Gator Bowl,[219] and 2001 Fiesta Bowl),[220] and it failed to qualify for a bowl game in two others (1999 and 2001). The highlight of Davie's tenure was a 36–20 upset win in 1998 over #5 Michigan, the defending national champions.[221][222] On December 17, 1999, Notre Dame was placed on probation by the NCAA. The association's Committee on Infractions found two series of violations. The New York Times reported \"the main one involved the actions of a booster, Kimberly Dunbar, who lavished gifts on football players with money she later pleaded guilty to embezzling.\" In the second series of events, a football player was accused of trying to sell several complimentary game tickets and of using others as repayment of a loan. The player was also said \"to have been romantically involved with a woman (not Dunbar), a part-time tutor at the university, who wrote a term paper for another player for a small fee and provided players with meals, lodging and gifts.\"[223] The Dunbar violation began while Lou Holtz was head coach: \"According to the NCAA committee report, Dunbar, the woman at the center of the more serious violations, had become romantically involved with several Notre Dame football players from June 1995 to January 1998 and had a child with one, Jarvis Edison.\"[223] Notre Dame was placed on probation for two years and lost one of its 85 football scholarships each year in what the Times termed \"minor\" penalties.[223][224] Davie nearly defeated top-ranked Nebraska in 2000, with the Irish comeback bid falling short in overtime 27–24.[225] The aforementioned 2001 Fiesta Bowl was Notre Dame's first invitation to the Bowl Championship Series. The Irish lost by 32 points to Oregon State,[226] but would finish No. 15 in the AP Poll, Davie's highest ranking as head coach. Despite Davie's rocky tenure, new athletic director Kevin White gave the coach a contract extension following the 2000 season,[227] then saw the team start 0–3 in 2001 – the first such start in school history.[228] Disappointed by the on-field results, coupled with the Joe Moore and Kim Dunbar scandals, the administration decided to dismiss Davie after the 2001 season.[229] His final record at Notre Dame was 35–25.[230] On December 9, 2001, Notre Dame hired George O'Leary, the head coach at Georgia Tech, to replace Davie.[231] However, while researching a story on O'Leary, New Hampshire Union Leader reporter Jim Fennell uncovered misrepresentations in O'Leary's resume that had influenced the administration's decision to hire him.[232] The resulting media scandal embarrassed Notre Dame officials and tainted O'Leary; he resigned five days later, before coaching a single practice, recruiting a single player, or hiring a single assistant coach.[233] O'Leary's tenure is the shortest of any head coach in FBS history.[234] O'Leary would go on to become the head football coach at the University of Central Florida.[235] Once again in need of a new head coach, the school turned to Tyrone Willingham, the head coach at Stanford.[236] Willingham's hiring made him the first African American head coach in Notre Dame football history.[237] Bringing a feeling of change and excitement to campus, Willingham led the 2002 squad to a 10–2 regular season record, including an 8–0 start with wins over #7 Michigan and #11 Florida State, and a #4 ranking. This great early start, however, would be the lone highlight of Willingham's tenure, as Notre Dame finished the year with a loss to Boston College, then lopsided losses to USC and North Carolina State in the Gator Bowl.[238] The program faltered over the next two seasons under Willingham, compiling an 11–12 record.[239] During this time, Notre Dame lost a game by at least 30 points on five occasions. Furthermore, Willingham's 2004 recruiting class was judged by analysts to be the worst at Notre Dame in more than two decades.[240] Citing Notre Dame's third consecutive four-touchdown loss to arch-rival USC[241] compounded by another year of subpar recruiting efforts, the Willingham era ended on November 30, 2004 (after the conclusion of the 2004 season) when the university chose to terminate him and pay out the remainder of Willingham's six-year contract.[242] After Willingham's firing, Notre Dame initially pursued Utah head coach Urban Meyer, who had been an Irish assistant from 1996 to 2000 and had a clause in his Utah contract that stated he could take the Notre Dame head coaching job without paying a buyout.[243][244] After Meyer accepted the Florida head coaching position and turned down the Irish,[245] Charlie Weis left the NFL's New England Patriots, where he won three Super Bowls as offensive coordinator,[246] to become head football coach for the Irish beginning with the 2005 season.[247] A first-time head coach when he was hired by Notre Dame,[248] Weis was officially introduced on December 12, 2004.[249] Weis' hiring as the Irish's 30th head football coach made him the first Notre Dame graduate to hold the football head coaching position on a full-fledged basis since Joe Kuharich.[250] Weis signed a six-year contract worth about $2 million annually excluding incentives.[251][252][253] To kick off his inaugural season, Weis led the Irish to back-to-back road wins over ranked teams, the first time that had been done by a Notre Dame coach since Knute Rockne. On September 25, Weis and the Irish traveled to Seattle to face Washington and former head coach Tyrone Willingham, who was hired by the Huskies to be their head coach two weeks after getting fired at Notre Dame.[254] The Irish won by a score of 36–17.[255] Entering the rivalry game with USC, defending national champions and owners of a 27-game winning streak, the Irish had risen to #9 in the AP Poll. In one of the most famous games in the rivalry's history, USC defeated Notre Dame 34–31. The game is most remembered for Trojan running back and eventual Heisman winner Reggie Bush, who had already scored three touchdowns that day, illegally pushing quarterback Matt Leinart into the end zone on the final play of the game, in a play now known as the \"Bush Push\". The Irish won their remaining five games to earn an appearance in the Fiesta Bowl. There, they were defeated by the Ohio State Buckeyes 34–20[256] to finish the season 9–3 and #9 in the AP poll, their highest final ranking since 1993. Quarterback Brady Quinn broke numerous team passing records that season and became a top Heisman Trophy contender.[257] Wide receiver Jeff Samardzija was the team's leading receiver and also broke Notre Dame's single-season records for receiving yards and touchdowns.[258] During the 2005 season, Notre Dame signed Weis to a big raise and ten-year contract extension that was set to keep the coach in South Bend through the 2015 season.[259][260] Weis and the Irish went into the 2006 season with a No. 2 preseason ranking in the ESPN/Coaches Poll.[261] They finished the regular season with a 10–2 record, losing only to Michigan and USC. Notre Dame accepted a bid to the 2007 Sugar Bowl, losing to LSU 41–14. This marked their ninth consecutive postseason loss, the longest drought in NCAA history.[262] As a result, Notre Dame dropped to #17 in the final rankings.[263][264] In the wake of a graduating class that sent eleven players to the NFL,[265] the 2007 season included various negative milestones: the most losses in a single year (9);[266] two of the ten worst losses in program history (38–0 losses to both Michigan[267] and USC);[268] and the first 6-game losing streak for home games.[269] The Naval Academy recorded their first win over the Irish since 1963, breaking Notre Dame's NCAA-record 43-game win streak.[270] In 2008, the Irish started 4–1, but completed the regular season with a 6–6 record,[271] including a 24–23 home loss to Syracuse, the first time that Notre Dame had fallen to an eight-loss team.[272] Quarterback Jimmy Clausen was the team's star player, completing over 60% of his passes.[273][274] Despite speculation the university might fire Weis, it was announced he would remain head coach.[275] Weis's Notre Dame squad ended the season breaking the Irish's NCAA bowl losing streak by beating Hawaii, 49–21, in the Hawaii Bowl.[276] Weis entered the 2009 season with the expectation from the Notre Dame administration that his team would be in position to compete for a BCS Bowl berth.[277] Notre Dame started the first part of the season 4–2, with close losses to Michigan and USC. Sitting at 6–2, however, Notre Dame lost to Navy for the second time in three years,[278] which became the first loss in a four-game losing streak to finish the season. Quarterback Jimmy Clausen and wide receiver Golden Tate would forgo their senior seasons and enter the NFL Draft.[279] Weis was fired on November 30, 2009.[280] According to Weis' buyout, he was to be paid $6 million then $2.05 million annually until the contract ran out in December 2015 for a total of about $19 million.[281] During that time, Weis made more money annually not to coach the Irish than his successor, Brian Kelly, made to coach the team.[282] On December 10, 2009, Cincinnati head coach Brian Kelly became the 31st head coach of the Fighting Irish after leading the Bearcats to a 12–0 record and BCS bowl-game berth, but he left the team before the bowl game.[283][284] Kelly's hiring surprised very few as he was a northern Irish Catholic who was considered one of college football's rising stars.[285] In his first season, Kelly led the Fighting Irish to an 8–5 record.[286] Tragedy struck early in the season when Declan Sullivan, a junior working for the athletic department, died while filming a practice on a scissor lift in dangerously high winds.[287] Dayne Crist started the season at quarterback but was injured for a second consecutive year, this time in the Tulsa game, which the Irish lost.[288] Kelly turned to freshman quarterback Tommy Rees, who led the Irish to victories in the last three games against #15 Utah, Army in Yankee Stadium, and breaking an eight-year losing streak to USC in the LA Coliseum. Kelly guided the Irish to a 33–17 win over Miami (FL) in the 2010 Sun Bowl to finish 2010 with an 8–5 record.[289] With senior wideout Michael Floyd returning for his senior season and an outstanding recruiting class that included several highly touted defensive linemen,[290] Kelly and the Irish looked to improve on their 8–5 record from the prior year. However, an early season upset to a Skip Holtz-led South Florida team and a last-second loss to Michigan in Ann Arbor, games in which the Irish committed 10 total turnovers, left the Irish at 0–2 to start the season. The Irish bounced back to beat #15 Michigan State and had two 4-game winning streaks, with the only loss during that stretch coming at the hands of USC.[291] The Irish also broke Navy's 2-game winning streak over Notre Dame. Notre Dame lost 18–14 to Florida State in the 2011 Champs Sports Bowl, concluding the 2011 campaign with an 8–5 record overall, identical to the 2010 season.[292] In the team's losses, multiple turnovers from the quarterback position were often the culprit, and as a whole turnovers at critical times in the game often derailed potential Irish comebacks. On September 12, 2012, during the football program's 125th season, Notre Dame announced that it would leave the Big East Conference for the Atlantic Coast Conference, excluding the football and hockey programs.[293] This move became official on July 1, 2013. While the Fighting Irish football team remained an FBS independent, it agreed to play five games per season against ACC teams starting with the 2014 football season. In return, Notre Dame became eligible to participate in the ACC's sub-BCS level bowl arrangements.[294] The 2012 season was another entry in historic third seasons for Notre Dame head coaches. The Irish began the season 7–0, including wins over ranked rivals in Michigan State, Michigan, and Stanford. The game against the Cardinal required a goal-line stand against running back Stepfan Taylor in overtime to preserve the win for the Irish.[295] The season's signature win came at #8 Oklahoma with ESPN's College GameDay in town. On November 18, after a loss by #1 Oregon, Notre Dame became ranked #1 in the nation in both the AP and Coaches' polls after reaching 11–0 during the regular season for the first time since 1993, also ranking #1 in the BCS standings for the first time in the 14-year history of the selection system.[296] After defeating USC on November 24,[297] Notre Dame concluded its first 12–0 regular season, and the Irish were soon formally named to appear in the BCS National Championship Game for the first time. In that game, on January 7, 2013, the Irish lost to Alabama 42–14.[298] The strength of the 2012 Fighting Irish was its defense, captained by senior leader Manti Te'o, who broke the school record for interceptions by a linebacker with 7 and finished second to Johnny Manziel in Heisman Trophy voting. Coming off the previous year's national title game appearance, the Fighting Irish were dealt a blow when 2012 starting quarterback, Everett Golson, was suspended from the University due to an academic violation.[299] Senior Tommy Rees then took over. Notre Dame's 2013 season ended with a record of 9–4,[300] a victory over Rutgers in the Pinstripe Bowl, and a #20 AP poll ranking.[301][302] The 2014 season started off with 6 straight victories and a #5 national ranking heading into a showdown with #2 Florida State in Tallahassee, Florida. FSU won that game 31–27, on a controversial offensive pass interference call that brought back a last-second Notre Dame touchdown. The Fighting Irish bounced back with a win against Navy before dropping their final 4 games of the season. They did win the Music City Bowl by defeating the LSU Tigers and finished the season at an 8–5 record.[303] The 2015 Fighting Irish began its season with another new offensive coordinator, Mike Sanford Jr.[304] Led for most of the year by sophomore quarterback DeShone Kizer, the Irish had fourteen plays of over 50 yards during the season, which was a school record, including two touchdowns of over 90 yards (a 91-yard touchdown run by C. J. Prosise and a 98-yard touchdown run by Josh Adams). The Irish only had two in the previous 126 years of Notre Dame football. They finished the regular season averaging 34 points per game, including a 62-point effort against UMass, the most points in a game since 1996. The Irish began the season 10–1 and were in position for a College Football Playoff appearance, but lost a last-second game to Stanford to finish with a 10–2 record and a berth in the Fiesta Bowl.[305] Star linebacker Jaylon Smith was injured early in the game which became a loss to Ohio State.[306] The 2016 season ended with a 4–8 record, Brian Kelly's worst win–loss record at Notre Dame. The tone for the season was set early, with a heartbreaking double overtime loss to Texas in the season opener.[307] Just 4 games into the season, Brian Kelly fired defensive coordinator Brian VanGorder.[308] At the end of the season, starting quarterback DeShone Kizer declared for the NFL Draft[309] and backup quarterback Malik Zaire announced he would be transferring in the winter after graduation.[310][311] Amidst speculation that Kelly's job was in jeopardy and that Kelly was looking to leave Notre Dame, athletics director Jack Swarbrick announced that Kelly would return for the 2017 season.[312] The 2017 season was one of Kelly's strongest seasons at ND. An early one-point loss to #2 Georgia was the only blemish on an 8-1 start, keyed by a 49-14 blowout over rival USC. The tough running of running back Josh Adams behind an experienced and talented offensive line, which included future top-10 picks Quenton Nelson and Mike McGlinchey and won the Joe Moore Award as the best offensive line in that nation, allowed Notre Dame to string together 6 consecutive 20+ point victories. However, when #3 Notre Dame visited #7 Miami in South Florida on November 7, an embarrassing 41-8 loss effectively ended the Irish hopes of a playoff run. They ended the season with a win over LSU in the Music City Bowl.[313] The Irish opened the 2018 season at home against Michigan and won, 24–17.[314] After benching quarterback Brandon Wimbush in favor of Ian Book, the Irish then won the remainder of their regular season games, including victories over #7 Stanford, #24 Virginia Tech, #12 Syracuse, and Northwestern.[315] This led to Notre Dame's first undefeated regular season since 2012.[316] They were ranked #3 in the nation by the College Football Playoff committee and selected to play in the College Football Playoff semifinal at the Cotton Bowl against Clemson.[317] Notre Dame's undefeated streak came to an end after losing to the eventual national champions 30–3 to finish the season at 12–1.[318] Kelly was named AP Coach of the Year and Home Depot Coach of the Year for the 2018 season.[319][320] Kelly and the Fighting Irish started off the 2019 season with a #9 ranking in the AP Poll. Notre Dame won their first two games before dropping a 23–17 result to #3 Georgia. Notre Dame won their next three games before dropping a 45–14 game to #19 Michigan. Notre Dame closed out the regular season with victories in their last five games, followed by a win in the Camping World Bowl 33–9 over Iowa State.[321] In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the cancellation of regular season scheduled games, Notre Dame joined the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) in football for a single season in 2020 and played a full slate of conference matches.[322] The Irish won all ten of their games, including a mid-season contest against perennial conference power and top-ranked Clemson. The Fighting Irish defeated the Tigers 47–40 in double overtime. However, Clemson defeated the Irish in a rematch in the ACC Championship Game 34–10. Notre Dame qualified for the College Football Playoff as the #4 seed.[323] In the College Football Playoff Semifinals against Alabama at the Rose Bowl, Notre Dame lost 31–14 to finish with a 10–2 record.[324] In what would become Kelly's final season as head coach in 2021, the Fighting Irish were ranked #9 to begin the season, but struggled in their first two games, beating Florida State 41–38 and Toledo 32–29. Following a 24–13 loss to #7 Cincinnati, Kelly helped lead the Fighting Irish to a seven-game winning streak to finish the regular season 11–1 and earn a berth in the Fiesta Bowl.[325] On November 29, 2021, Kelly resigned as Notre Dame head coach to accept a ten-year, $95 million contract offer to become head coach at LSU.[326] In so doing, Kelly became the first Irish head coach since Thomas A. Barry in 1907 to leave Notre Dame for another coaching job.[327] Kelly left the Irish as the program's all-time winningest head coach.[328][329] On December 3, 2021, Notre Dame's defensive coordinator Marcus Freeman was promoted to the head coaching position to replace Brian Kelly, becoming the 32nd head coach in program history.[330][331] The second African American head coach in the history of the Irish football program, Freeman signed a five-year contract worth $4 million annually excluding incentives.[332][333][334] Freeman took control immediately, coaching the Irish in their Fiesta Bowl loss to Oklahoma State.[335][336] Freeman opened the 2022 season with losses to Ohio State (his alma mater) and Marshall, thus becoming first head coach in Notre Dame history to start his tenure with three losses.[337] He gained his first win the following week against the California.[338][339] Freeman's Irish would go on to finish the regular season ranked 19th with a record of 8-4, including an upset win over No. 5 Clemson.[340][341] They were awarded a berth in the Gator Bowl where they defeated South Carolina 45–38.[342][343] For the 2023 season, Freeman guided the Notre Dame program to a 10-win season. Safety Xavier Watts received the Bronko Nagurski Trophy for college football's best defensive player and the team earned victories over #17 Duke, #10 USC and #19 Oregon State in the Sun Bowl. Notre Dame finished the year ranked #14 in the final AP Top 25. Freeman and the Fighting Irish held their first home game of the 2024 season against the Northern Illinois Huskies as the #5 ranked team in the AP Top 25 and as a 28.5-point favorite to win. They fell to the Huskies 16-14, throwing two interceptions and giving up two blocked field goals. It was the second early-season home loss for the Irish against a heavy underdog in three years (following the 2022 loss to Marshall), was the first-ever win by a Mid-American Conference football program against a top 5 team, the first-ever Huskie win against a top 10 team, and one of the largest point-spread upsets in modern college football.[344] The Irish went on to complete the regular season 11-1 and hosted a home game in the first year of the expanded college football playoffs, in which they beat the Indiana Hoosiers 27-17. They then beat the Georgia Bulldogs on Jan 2, by a score of 23-10. Notre Dame's 11 claimed national championships are: Following its appearance in the 1925 Rose Bowl, Notre Dame did not play in a post-season game for 44 consecutive years (1925–1968), including after many of the team's most successful seasons from the Rockne era in the 1920s and the Leahy era in the 1940s. The university's stated reasons for its self-imposed hiatus were that bowl games were \"glorified exhibitions\" that played no part in national championship selections and that they extended the season too far to the detriment of players' academic progress.[351] Notre Dame has made 874 appearances in the Associated Press poll over 71 seasons. Notre Dame has spent 591 weeks in the Top 10, 318 weeks in the Top 5, and 98 weeks at No. 1.[352] Notre Dame has finished the year ranked in the final Associated Press poll of the season 56 times: Notre Dame has participated in eleven \"No. 1 vs No. 2\" matchups since the AP poll began in 1936.[369] They have a record of 5–3–2 in such games, with a 4–1–1 record as the No. 1 team in such matchups. Here's a list of such games: Notre Dame has played in many regular season games that have been widely regarded by both the media[370] and sports historians[371] as historic or famous games. Notre Dame has played in many games labeled \"Game of the Century\" as well as several No. 1 vs No. 2 matchups.[372] Notre Dame has also played in several bowl games considered by many sportswriters to be among the best bowl games played:[384][385] Notre Dame's all-time record after the 2023 season stands at 948 wins, 338 losses, and 42 ties. † George O'Leary did not coach a single practice or game, resigning five days after being hired for misrepresenting his academic credentials.‡ Kent Baer served as interim head coach for one game at the 2004 Insight Bowl after Tyrone Willingham was fired. Notre Dame has made 44 bowl game appearances, winning 22 and losing 21, with one game vacated.[387] After an initial appearance in a postseason contest in the 1925 Rose Bowl, the Fighting Irish refused to participate in bowl games for more than four decades;[388] Sports Illustrated's Dan Jenkins speculated that Notre Dame might have gone to as many as twenty bowl games during the self-imposed forty-five-year hiatus.[388] From 1994 to the 2006 football seasons, Notre Dame lost 9 consecutive bowl games, tied with Northwestern for the most in NCAA history. That streak ended with a 49–21 win over Hawaii in the 2008 Hawaii Bowl. In the process, Notre Dame scored its highest point total in postseason play. The record of 9 consecutive bowl losses was later tied by Northwestern in 2011, then that streak was snapped a year later. The Fighting Irish suffered in a multi-decade skid with an 0-8 record in BCS/Playoff games and an 0-10 record in major bowl games between 1994 and 2025. The losing streak would come to an end when Notre Dame beat Georgia in the 2025 Sugar Bowl. Between 2009 and 2016, and resuming again in 2018, Notre Dame has hosted an annual off-site home football game known as the Shamrock Series. The series promotes Notre Dame's athletic and academic brand, and has brought the Fighting Irish to San Antonio, New York, Greater Washington, D.C., Chicago, Indianapolis, Boston and the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex. Notre Dame has yet to lose a game in the Shamrock Series with a record of 11-0 (including the later-vacated win over Arizona State in the 2013 season). Prior to the 2012 season, Notre Dame Athletic Director Jack Swarbrick announced at a news conference of plans to continue the series through 2016. He confirmed after his news conference that New York is expected to fall in that rotation and then continue to be the one consistently repeating venue for Shamrock Series games. The Shamrock Series was not held in 2017, but resumed in 2018. One of the unique aspects of the Shamrock Series is its inclusion of academic and other non-football activities in the area of that year's host city the days and hours leading up to the game, which include pep rallies, drummers' circles, and academic lectures.[389][390][391] The Shamrock Series held in Las Vegas was the largest crowd for a college athletic event in Nevada history.[392] Seven Notre Dame football players have won the Heisman Trophy, which ties them with the University of Oklahoma for the second most by any university. (Ohio State also has seven trophies that were won by only six players, while USC has the most winners with eight). Heisman voting:[394] 50 former Notre Dame players and 6 coaches have been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame, located in Atlanta, Georgia.[364] Notre Dame leads all universities in players inducted. Notre Dame's home jersey is navy blue with white numerals, gold outlining, and a small interlocking \"ND\" logo on each sleeve. The away jersey is white with navy numerals, gold outlining, and the interlocking \"ND\" on the sleeves. These uniforms were introduced by Lou Holtz in 1986 and retained during the tenures of Bob Davie (1997-2001) and Tyrone Willingham (2002–04). In 2005, Charlie Weis removed the interlocking \"ND\" from the sleeves, replacing it with the player's number, the first time the Irish had worn \"TV numbers\" since 1986, when they were located on the shoulders. These jerseys remained throughout Weis' tenure. When Brian Kelly succeeded Weis in 2010, the interlocking \"ND\" returned to the sleeves, and it has remained since. The Irish traditionally have not worn player names on their jerseys during regular season games, but they were included during the coaching tenures of Dan Devine (1975–80) and Gerry Faust (1981-85). When Notre Dame appeared in the 1970 Cotton Bowl Classic, its first bowl game in 45 years, Ara Parseghian had player names placed on the backs of the jerseys, a tradition which was retained for four other bowl appearances under Parseghian. Holtz, Davie, Willingham and Weis (in the 2006 Fiesta Bowl and 2007 Sugar Bowl) did not adhere to this tradition for bowl games they coached, but it returned under Weis for the 2008 Hawaii Bowl and has been continued by Kelly and Marcus Freeman. Notre Dame's helmets are solid gold with gray facemasks, the gold being emblematic of the University's famed \"Golden Dome\". Notre Dame's tradition for the team's student managers to spray-paint the team's helmets prior to each game ended in 2011 when the football equipment staff, along with Notre Dame Athletics Director Jack Swarbrick and head coach Brian Kelly outsourced the painting process to Hydro Graphics Inc. During Gerry Faust's tenure (1981–85), Notre Dame's blue jerseys switched from the traditional navy (although Notre Dame wore green jerseys full-time between the 1977 game vs. USC and the end of the 1980 season) to royal blue with gold and white stripes on the sleeves (they also wore a green jersey with sleeve stripes for the 1983 game vs. USC). The navy blue jerseys returned for the 1984 season (the Irish wore a redesigned white jersey during the 1983 Liberty Bowl without sleeve stripes and navy blue names and numbers which was carried over to 1984). No uniform numbers have been retired by Notre Dame. Upon being issued a number, each player is given a card that lists some of the more famous players who have worn that particular number. Number 3 is perhaps the most famous number in Irish football history, having been worn by Ralph Guglielmi, George Izo, Daryle Lamonica, Coley O'Brien, Joe Montana, Michael Floyd, Rick Mirer and Ron Powlus, among others.[425] Number 5 is also notable, as it is the only number to be worn by one of the Four Horsemen (Elmer Layden) a Heisman Trophy Winner (Paul Hornung) and a National Title winning Quarterback (Terry Hanratty).[425] Number 7 has been worn by such Irish greats as 1964 Heisman Trophy winner John Huarte, 1970 Heisman runner-up Joe Theismann, Steve Beuerlein, Jimmy Clausen and Jarious Jackson.[425] In 2011, both Michigan and Notre Dame wore throwback uniforms in their game against each other. For each Shamrock Series game, Notre Dame wears specially-designed helmets, jerseys, and pants. Champion supplied football jerseys for Notre Dame for over 50 years until the Irish switched to Adidas in 2001. On July 1, 2014, the Notre Dame athletic department began wearing uniforms and footwear supplied by Under Armour. Over the years, Notre Dame has occasionally worn green instead of blue as its home jersey, sometimes adopting the jersey for an entire season – or more – at a time. Notre Dame is confirmed to have worn green as far back as 1926 against Penn State, and in 1942 they officially became an alternate color for the team.[426] Currently, Notre Dame reserves its green jerseys for special occasions. Sometimes on such occasions, the Irish will take the field for warmups dressed in blue, only to switch to green when they go back to the locker room before kickoff. This tradition was started by Dan Devine in 1977 before the USC game. Notre Dame has also been known to switch jerseys at halftime, as during the 1985 USC game and in the loss to Nile Kinnick-led Iowa in 1939, although this was to help avoid confusion between their navy uniforms and Iowa's black ones. The current design of the jersey is kelly green with gold numbers and white outlining. For the 2006 Army game, Coach Charlie Weis broke out the green jerseys as a reward to his senior players and in an attempt to end the string of losses by the Irish when wearing green. Notre Dame wore throwback green jerseys in 2007 against USC in honor of the 30th anniversary of the 1977 National Championship team but lost the game 38-0.[427] As of 2023, Notre Dame's record in green is 42-15-1, going back to 1975.[426] On at least one occasion (1992 Sugar Bowl) Notre Dame has worn an away variant of the jersey, a white jersey with green numbers. Notre Dame Stadium is the home football stadium for the University of Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team. Located on the southeast part of the university's campus in Notre Dame, Indiana and with a seating capacity of 77,622, Notre Dame Stadium is one of the most renowned venues in college football.[428] The Sporting News ranks Notre Dame Stadium as #2 on its list of \"College Football Cathedrals\".[429] and the stadium experience evokes a more traditional feel. Notre Dame Stadium is used for football-related activities and for Commencement (since 2010). Notre Dame Stadium had no permanent lighting until the expansion project in 1997. NBC paid for the lighting as they have televised all Notre Dame home football games since 1991. On April 12, 2014, it was announced during the annual Blue-Gold Spring Game that a FieldTurf synthetic surface would replace the grass field after the 2014 Commencement Weekend. In November 2014 the University of Notre Dame embarked on a $400 million stadium expansion called the Crossroads Campus Project, which was completed in time for the 2017 season. Cartier Field was the original playing field of the Fighting Irish. In 1930, it was replaced by Notre Dame Stadium, due to the growing popularity of ND football. Known by fans as \"The Gug\" (pronounced \"goog\"), The Guglielmino Athletics Complex is Notre Dame's football headquarters. The Gug houses the offices for all team staff members, an auditorium, a weight room, a training room, the equipment room, the practice locker room, a brand new napping room, and various other spaces for the football team to utilize. The complex was underwritten by Don F. Guglielmino and his family. The indoor practice facility has a synthetic turf field and a video board at midfield for replay and graphics. On the second level of the facility, there is a 1,600-square-foot recruiting lounge. In all, the facility totals 111,400 square feet, and the ceiling is 95 feet at its peak. Notre Dame has rivalries with several universities. Although the Fighting Irish competes as an Independent, they play a national schedule that includes annual or otherwise regularly scheduled rivalry games. Army, Boston College, Michigan, Michigan State, Navy, Northwestern, Pittsburgh, Purdue, Stanford, and USC are among Notre Dame's rivals. Notre Dame and the Miami Hurricanes first met during the 1955 college football season.[430] They met three times during the 1960s (1960, 1965, and 1967) and proceeded to play each other annually from 1971 to 1990 (except in 1986). Notre Dame consistently dominated the series in the 1970s, but in the 1980s, Miami began to dominate as the once docile rivalry intensified significantly. Both teams were national contenders in the later part of the decade, and both teams cost each other at least one national championship. Hostilities were fueled when the Hurricanes routed the Fighting Irish in the 1985 season finale 58–7, with Miami widely accused of running up the score in the second half. The rivalry gained national attention and both teams played their most famous games from 1988 to 1990. The game known as Catholics vs. Convicts in South Bend was won by the Fighting Irish 31–30. The following year, Miami ended Notre Dame's 23-game winning streak with a 27–10 victory. The rivalry ended after the Fighting Irish dashed #2 Miami's hopes for a repeat national championship with a 29–20 victory in South Bend. Notre Dame dropped Miami from its schedule due to the intensified rivalry. The two teams are next scheduled to meet during a yet to specified date during the 2025 season. They also will play each other in yet to be scheduled dates in the 2031, 2032, 2034, and 2037 seasons.[431] The first meeting between Notre Dame and Michigan was in 1887, the first official football game in Notre Dame's history.[432] The two schools have met 44 times in total, the latest matchup in 2019. Through the 2021 season, the two schools are both in the top five in all-time Division I winning percentage, with Notre Dame fourth and Michigan third Meeting for the first time in 1897, Notre Dame and Michigan State play for the Megaphone Trophy. The two schools played in 64 out of 70 seasons from 1948 to 2017, but have not met since. Their next scheduled game is in 2026.[433] Notable games in the series include the 1966 \"Game of the Century\". Through the 2023 season, Notre Dame leads the all-time series 48–28–1 and the trophy series 33–27–1.[434] Navy and Notre Dame played 93 games without interruption from 1927 to 2019. Notre Dame had a 43-game win streak during this time frame, the longest streak by one team over another in Division I-A football, which ended in 2007.[435] While the 2020 contest was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the series resumed in 2021. Through the 2024 season, Notre Dame leads the series 83–13–1.[436] USC is Notre Dame's primary rival, and the schools compete annually for the Jeweled Shillelagh. The rivalry has produced 39 national championships,[437]: 113–118 15 Heisman Trophy winners,[438] and 184 Consensus All-Americans through the 2021 season.[439] It is considered one of the most prominent rivalries in college football,[440][441][442][443] and has been called the greatest rivalry not dictated by conference affiliation or geography.[444] The teams have played each other annually since 1926, except from 1943 to 1945 and 2020. Notable games in the series include the 1977 \"Green Jersey\" game and the 2005 \"Bush Push\" game. Through the 2024 season, Notre Dame leads the all-time series 50–37–5 and the trophy series 35–30–3.[445] Due to its long and storied history, Notre Dame football boasts many traditions unique to Notre Dame. Some of these are: Since the NFL began drafting players in 1936, 495 Notre Dame football players have been selected by NFL teams. Additionally, Notre Dame has had 65 players selected in the first round of the NFL draft, including five overall number one picks. Of the 46 Super Bowls competed, as of 2012, only 14 teams have won the event without an Irish player on the roster.[457] Looking at both participating team rosters, there have only been five Super Bowls that did not feature at least one former Notre Dame player on either team's roster – Denver vs. Atlanta, 1999; Dallas vs. Buffalo, 1994; Washington vs. Denver, 1988; Dallas vs. Denver, 1978; and Baltimore vs. Dallas, 1971.[457] Eleven former players have won multiple Super Bowls: Mark Bavaro, Rocky Bleier, Nick Buoniconti, Eric Dorsey, Dave Duerson, David Givens, Terry Hanratty, Bob Kuechenberg, Joe Montana, Steve Sylvester and Justin Tuck.[457] 13 former Notre Dame players, plus 1 non-player alumnus, have been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, tying it for first with USC among all college football programs.[458][459] *McNally graduated from St. John's (MN), but started his career at Notre Dame and is listed as a hall of famer under both schools in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.[460] The Fighting Irish are the only team, professional or collegiate, to have all their games broadcast nationally on the radio and their home games on television.[462] Notre Dame famously left the College Football Association, a consortium that administered television broadcast rights on behalf of over 64 schools, in 1990, in order to establish its own broadcasting deal with NBC. From 1968 to 2007, Westwood One served as the official radio partner for the Irish, broadcasting their games for 40 consecutive years.[463] Until the 2006 Air Force game, Notre Dame had a record 169 consecutive games broadcast nationally on either NBC, ABC, ESPN, or CBS.[464] The 2006 ND vs. Air Force game was broadcast on CSTV, a college sports channel owned by CBS who had an exclusive contract with the Mountain West Conference, of which Air Force is a member. Radio rights to the Fighting Irish are held by Skyview Networks, who began distributing the broadcasts as part of a multi-sport arrangement in 2020.[465] NBC has been televising Notre Dame Home football games since the 1991 season.[9] In addition to TV broadcasts, NBC also maintains several dedicated websites to ND football and Notre Dame Central,[466] which provides complete coverage, full game replays and commentary of the Notre Dame team. NBC's television contract with Notre Dame was renewed in April 2013 and was set to continue through the 2025 football season,[467] before another contract renewal was made in 2023. NBC is now set to be the home of Notre Dame football through the 2029 season. It also aired football games on NBC's streaming service Peacock started in the 2021 season, with the home opener on September 11, 2021, against Toledo aired exclusively on the streaming service.[468][469] Internationally Sky Sports has been covering Notre Dame Football home games in the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, Italy and Germany since 2018 as a result of Comcast's takeover of Sky Although the Notre Dame football program is not a full member of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), it has an agreement to play an average of five ACC schools per season. In return Notre Dame has access to the non-College Football Playoff ACC bowl line-up.[470][471] Notre Dame utilizes a format of six home games in South Bend, five away games, and one major metropolitan area neutral site \"Shamrock Series\" home game for scheduling.[389] This includes preserving traditional yearly rivalries with USC, Stanford, and Navy,[472] five rotating ACC opponents (two away ACC games will coincide in even years with away games at Navy and three away ACC games will coincide in odd years with home games against Navy),[473] two home and home series (one home game and one away game), one one-time opponent home game, and the traveling \"Shamrock Series\" home game.[474][475] TBA: 1 additional ACC away game will be scheduled. TBA: 1 additional ACC home game and 1 additional non-ACC home game will be scheduled. TBA: 1 additional ACC game and 3 additional non-ACC games will be scheduled. TBA: 1 additional ACC game and 2 additional non-ACC games will be scheduled. TBA: 1 additional ACC game and 2 additional non-ACC games will be scheduled.

The Fighting Irish used a furious rally of 17 points in 54 seconds around the halftime break to take control of the game and never looked back. The Irish and Bulldogs were held scoreless in the first quarter, marking the first CFP game without first-quarter points since 2018. After Notre Dame kicker Mitch Jeter nailed a field goal to push the score to 6-3 Irish with 39 seconds remaining in the first half, the fireworks started. RJ Oben strip-sacked Georgia quarterback Gunner Stockton, setting up a 13-yard touchdown pass by Notre Dame quarterback Riley Leonard to Beaux Collins the next play. Then on the opening kickoff of the third quarter, Jayden Harrison took the kickoff 98 yards for a touchdown to push the lead to 20-3. Notre Dame only put together ield goal drives outside the stretch, but the defense held long enough to escape the Superdome with a historic victory. In relief of injured Carson Beck, Stockton was strong. The sophomore from Rabun County, Georgia, threw for 234 yards and a touchdown in his first career start. However, the Bulldogs' offensive line struggled mightily, giving up nine tackles for loss and four sacks as the Fighting Irish defense feasted. Notre Dame mustered only 213 yards of offense, but it didn't matter. Leonard rushed for 80 yards to lead the Irish. CBS Sports was here with updates, highlights and analysis from the Sugar Bowl. Read on below for takeaways from Notre Dame's win over Georgia. Notre Dame controlled two sequences of the game, and Georgia couldn't retaliate Thursday afternoon in the Superdome. The 17-point onslaught in a span of only 54 seconds and eight combined plays did the damage, with Riley Leonard's touchdown pass after a Georgia fumble late in the first half and Jayden Harrison's 98-yard touchdown return. Then, with the game on the line, Marcus Freeman dug deep into his bag of tricks and frustrated the heck out of Georgia's coaching staff. With fewer than eight minutes remaining, Freeman sent his punting unit on the field, but then subbed them for the offense on fourth down. The decision resulted in Georgia jumping offsides after it replaced its special teams with the defense. That first down extended Notre Dame's drive, and the Irish nearly never relinquished the ball, controlling it for an incredible 7:36. They burned the clock, driving to midfield before punting the ball away with 1:49 remaining in the game. That's all it took for the Irish to win. Their offensive line, shorthanded all season, simply leaned on Georgia's stout defensive front and won the battle. This isn't the same Notre Dame team you've seen in previous years. They're stout up front and they have the speed to match. Georgia had an identity problem in 2024, and for the first time in six years, the season ended with a loss. The Bulldogs don't have a quarterback problem. Gunner Stockton was an absolute gamer in the face of intense pressure — both because of the venue, circumstances and because of Notre Dame's furious pass rush. The offensive line, as it has this season, struggled to open holes for running backs and were leaky against another defensive front. Meanwhile, the defense was pushed around up front and gave up too many chunk plays in big situations. That's not necessarily a killer, especially in a game in which the defense only gave up 16 points. No, the biggest issue for Georgia is at receiver. The Bulldogs' receiving corps has dropped at least 36 passes during the 2024 season, including a massive drop on a would-be touchdown by Dillon Bell in the third quarter, according to ESPN's research. That is unacceptable for any championship-chasing team, and it's a big reason why the Bulldogs trailed at halftime in seven games this season — and lost three. Help is on the way with the 2025 recruiting class. Five signees rank in the top 75 at their position, including top-10 receiver Talyn Taylor. This isn't the Notre Dame you've grown to love — or love to hate. The Fighting Irish have built a program that can beat you with speed and lean on your with power. Its defense is relentless and the offense has enough explosiveness and physicality to put games to bed. This is nothing new this season. Notre Dame has done this to practically every opponent on the schedule. The Irish may not put up big yardage, but they are opportunistic. They entered the Sugar Bowl ranked third nationally in turnover margin, and two key fumbles led to points and frustrated Georgia, which seemed poise to score early in the first quarter before running back Trevor Etienne lost the first fumble of his career. Freeman calls this team a bunch of \"misfits,\" players who are obsessed with football and doing everything they can to push themselves — and opponents — to the limit. The stat sheet wasn't full of quarterback sacks, but the Irish were in Gunner Stockton's face all afternoon. Credit the Georgia quarterback for firing passes in just enough time to avoid the sack, but he couldn't do it all day, and that led to a trio of sacks and a fumble in the first half. 7-seed Notre Dame shocked 2-seed Georgia with a 23-10 victory in the Sugar Bowl to send the Fighting Irish to the national semifinals at the Orange Bowl against Penn State. The Fighting Irish used a furious rally of 17 points in 54 seconds around the halftime break to take control of the game and never looked back. The Irish and Bulldogs were held scoreless in the first quarter, marking the first CFP game without first-quarter points since 2018. After Notre Dame kicker Mitch Jeter nailed a field goal to push the score to 6-3 Irish with 39 seconds remaining in the first half, the fireworks started. RJ Oben strip-sacked Georgia quarterback Gunner Stockton, setting up a 13-yard touchdown pass by Notre Dame quarterback Riley Leonard to Beaux Collins the next play. Then on the opening kickoff of the third quarter, Jayden Harrison took the kickoff 98 yards for a touchdown to push the lead to 20-3. Notre Dame only put together ield goal drives outside the stretch, but the defense held long enough to escape the Superdome with a historic victory. In relief of injured Carson Beck, Stockton was strong. The sophomore from Rabun County, Georgia, threw for 234 yards and a touchdown in his first career start. However, the Bulldogs' offensive line struggled mightily, giving up nine tackles for loss and four sacks as the Fighting Irish defense feasted. Notre Dame mustered only 213 yards of offense, but it didn't matter. Leonard rushed for 80 yards to lead the Irish. Georgia was set to get the ball back with under 8 minutes remaining but then Marcus Freeman pulled out a trick from a sleeve: he subbed the entire punting unit for the offense, and after the Bulldogs made their substitutions, quarterback Riley Leonard's snap count managed to draw an offsides penalty. The play resulted in a first down and may have put the game away for the Irish as the clock now ticks below 5 minutes remaining in regulation. Notre Dame survived a scare in the red zone thanks to its tremendous defense coming up big again. Jack Kiser was flagged for pass interference on an incomplete pass that would have been a turnover on downs, but the 15-yard penalty on fourth-and-13 kept the Georgia drive alive — and it sent Notre Dame coach Marcus Freeman into a tizzy on the sideline as he ripped into the officials. Later, on fourth-and-5 at the 9, the Irish got pressure again and Gunner Stockton fired a pass over the head of his receiver in the end zone to turn the ball over on downs with 9:25 remaining. Georgia attacked the edges in the run game and had plenty of success before stalling in Georgia territory, where Mitch Jeter hit his third long field goal of the afternoon to push the Irish ahead 23-10 with 13:47 remaining. Jeter's field goal was good from 47 yards. He hit a 48-yarder earlier today. Georgia's defense stepped up with a stop on fourth down and Notre Dame followed suit. Al Golden called a blitz on fourth-and-2, leading to a chase for Gunner Stockton, who fired a pass short of the first-down markers to give the Irish the ball again with under four minutes remaining in the third quarter. Both defenses have been remarkable this afternoon, for the most part, but it's those two turnovers by the Irish D that has been the difference. Georgia's defense held strong in the trenches, stopping Riley Leonard short of a first down on fourth-and-1 near midfield. The turnover on downs with under 6 minutes remaining in the third quarter fives Georgia an opportunity to make this a one-score game again. Georgia appears to have the momentum here in the Superdome, where Bulldog fans have come to life again. Gunner Stockton is on a heater, and offensive coordinator Mike Bobo is dialing up some fantastic play calls. Georgia receivers ran free on three plays on this scoring drive, which ended with Cash Jones stumbling into the end zone for a 32-yard touchdown catch down the left sideline. The Bulldogs' receiving corps needed that play after a terrible drop by Dillon Bell, who was wide open coming across the middle of the field but dropped a perfectly-placed ball near the 20-yard line. It would have easily been a walk-in touchdown. It didn't matter in the end thanks to Bobo and Stockton hitting on all cylinders, from the coaches' box to the field at the Superdome. That drive chewed up 63 yards on only five plays. If you were wondering, Georgia receivers have dropped 36 passes this season. Notre Dame needed only 11 seconds to score 10 points in the final minute of the first half. They needed only 15 seconds to score another touchdown on a 98-yard kick return by Jayden Harrison at the start of the second half. Harrison pierced the middle, then leaked to the right sideline, dodging a would-be tackler before sprinting home for the 98-yard score to open the third quarter. Georgia fans might outnumber the Notre Dame faithful, but the Superdome is electric with Irish fans raising the decibel levels here in New Orleans. We expected a defensive battle and we've got it, but the big difference here is Notre Dame's tenacious defense forcing two turnovers. Notre Dame zoomed to a 10-0 run in the final minute of the first half thanks to a field goal and a strip-sack of Gunner Stockton, which led to Riley Leonard hitting Beaux Collins for a 13-yard touchdown pass. This game has been defined by taking advantage of opportunities. Georgia blew what could have been two touchdown drives with a fumble by Trevor Etienne deep in Notre Dame's territory (his first lost fumble ever (425 touches, per CBS Sports Research), and a sideline interference on a 67-yard catch at the 11-yard line. That penalty on walk-on Parker Jones pushed Georgia back to the 26-yard line, where the Bulldogs stalled and settled for a field goal. Notre Dame entered today ranked third nationally in turnover margin, and the Irish are again winning the turnover battle in their biggest game of the season. The quarterback run game has also frustrated Georgia. Leonard has rushed for 50 yards on six carries, picking up four first downs on those totes. He's also 10 of 15 passing for 60 yards and one touchdown. Stockton is 9 of 14 passing for 142 yards with the lost fumble. Georgia is averaging only 0.5 yards per carry thanks to three sacks for minus-32 yards by the Notre Dame defense. Notre Dame kicked a field goal and then forced a fumble on Gunner Stockton in the final minute to score 10 points in 11 seconds to grab a 13-3 at halftime. Here's how the coaches responded on the ESPN broadcast as they headed to the locker room at halftime: Kirby Smart, Georgia coach: \"We tried to be aggressive in 2-minute and probably regret it, right? Go to the half 6-3, we want to show confidence in our quarterback, let him go play, we didn't get the block we needed to get and they made a good play.\" Notre Dame coach Marcus Freeman: \"It's a great way to end the half. We gotta win the turnover margin and we capitalized off it on offense but this is going to be a 60-plus minute game. You watch this Georgia team all year and you know they're not going to quit. So we've got to be in attack mode and not feel comfortable. We've got to be in attack mode as soon as we come out of the locker room.\" Georgia opted to pass in the final 33 seconds of the first half, and that proved to be a terrible decision by coach Kirby Smart. Gunner Stockton was strip-sacked by RJ Oben on the Bulldogs' first play of the drive and, Junior Tuihalamaka recovered the loose ball at the 13-yard line. Riley Leonard hit receiver Beaux Collins in the middle of the end zone on the ensuing play to give Notre Dame a 13-3 lead going into halftime. It scored 10 points in 11 seconds. Georgia has had three costly mistakes — two turnovers — and a sideline interference penalty on walk-on Parker Jones. All three cost the Bulldogs points. Mitch Jeter drilled a 48-yard field goal to give Notre Dame its first lead of the game with 38 seconds remaining in the first half. Riley Leonard was the captain of that drive, which spanned 32 yards. He scrambled a couple of times, and managed to make up some ground on a 10-yard keeper after what could have been a momentum-changing sack by the Georgia defense. Georgia linebacker CJ Allen blew up running back Aneyas Williams, allowing Small Mondon, Jr. a clear path through the backfield on a twist to sack Riley Leonard for a huge 11-yard sack that pushed the Irish back to the 40-yard line. Notre Dame didn't need long to fire back at Georgia. Riley Leonard picked up 32 yards on a keeper to push the Irish into Georgia territory, but the offense stalled on a three-yard rush and back-to-back passes that went nowhere. Mitch Jeter converted a 44-yard field kick to tie the game and cap an eight-play, 49-yard drive with 8:20 remaining in the second quarter. Boy, Georgia walk-on Parker Jones hopes he won't be a name to remember. An official streaking down the sideline on a 67-yard catch by Arian Smith bumped into Jones and was flagged for sideline interference, a 15-yarder. The Bulldogs went from the 11-yard line to the 27, where the offense stalled and settled for a 41-yard field goal. There have been several haymakers already, and success seems as if it'll be found in the margins. To wit, that pass to Smith was a beauty down the right sideline from Stockton, and Smith blew past All-American safety Xavier Watts by at least a step. It hasn't been a clean game, but each team's had its moments. The Irish forced a fumble inside their own red zone, but not before Georgia's offense found some footing to pick up 71 yards on a 13-play drive. Meanwhile, Notre Dame's offense has mostly sputtered with a pair of penalties, including an illegal forward pass by Riley Leonard. The Irish enter the second quarter with a third-and-11 and only 16 yards of offense. Both teams had a combined -21 yards after their first possession. Georgia attacked the middle of the field on back-to-back pass plays on its second possession, picking up nine yards each time on throws to tight end Dillon Bell and receiver Dominic Lovett, who ran a drag route across the field. The plays helped push Georgia into Notre Dame territory. The Bulldogs were helped once again by undisciplined play by the Irish with an offsides on second-and-8, which should have been a minimal game on a keeper by quarterback Gunner Stockton. Trevor Etienne later picked up a first down on a 7-yard gainer over the left side, and Lovett picked up eight more yards to set up third-and-1 at the 16-yard line. The Bulldogs and Irish combined for six penalties totaling 43 yards. Notre Dame's has been one of the nation's most opportunistic teams, and it continues today early. Safety Adon Shuler cracked Georgia running back Trevor Etienne with a low hit, popping the ball out to the 10-yard line, where it was recovered by the Irish. Georgia was threatening to score with a nice 13-play drive, but it ended after chewing up 71 yards. Notre Dame entered today ranked No. 3 in turnover margin. We're still scoreless here at the Caesars Superdome. Neither team looked, well, good on their first possession. The first two drives included four penalties and a combined -21 yards. Notre Dame was charged with running into the kicker on back-to-back Georgia punts; quarterback Riley Leonard was then flagged for an illegal forward pass on a scramble. Georgia finally picked up positive yardage on Its second possession with a 12-yard pass by Gunner Stockton. It's clear both defenses have the advantage early, particularly on the edges. The Bulldogs attempted to run wide several times on their first possession, but Notre Dame was quick and ready for the stops. Georgia coach Kirby Smart spoke with ESPN before kickoff. He was asked about the last two days in New Orleans — and the game being postponed due to the terrorist attack. \"Things are bigger than football out there and sometimes we get caught up in our own selves, our own moment and you lose sight of how blessed we are every day to have the opportunity we have to play football and play in a CFP quarterfinal game against a historic program,\" Smart told ESPN's Marty Smith. \"A lot of times when you have gratitude, it takes away a lot of anxiety.\" Smart was also asked about Gunner Stockton making his first start in place of injured quarterback Carson Beck. Georgia is the slight favorite (-1.5), according to the SportsLine consensus, which gives me pause. The Bulldogs enter the playoffs 1-9 against the spread as the favorite this season. There's no doubt Georgia played a more difficult schedule than Notre Dame, and the grind was noticeable with two overtime wins to end the season, but one does wonder if the Bulldogs are allowing opponents to better dictate the tempo of those games, resulting in closer-than-expected results. Gunner Stockton appears to be a gamer at quarterback, even if he's not the most talented passer, but that plays into Notre Dame's hands with one of the nation's best pass defenses. Everything points to a Notre Dame win, even with Kirby Smart's knack in preparing his teams for playoff runs. Pick: Notre Dame SU The CBS Sports' staff's complete picks are available in the article below. A crew from the Big 12 conference will officiate the Sugar Bowl playoff quarterfinal today between Georgia and Notre Dame. Security at the Sugar Bowl inside and outside the Caesars Superdome is tight ahead of the 3 p.m. CT kickoff between Georgia and Notre Dame. Police K9 officers patrolled the perimeter of the massive facility, sniffing the undercarriage of incoming busses and shuttles, searching for explosive devices. The nearby parking garage attached the the Superdome had multiple security checkpoints, including a police K9. Inside, New Orleans police, hired private security and the FBI were spotted in the bowels of the stadium, patrolling the facility inside and out. On Wednesday, police scoured the Superdome searching for explosive devices and found none. The heightened security and safety sweeps come on the heels of the vehicular terrorist attack on Bourbon Street early on New Year's Day. Fourteen people were killed and dozens more were injured. The killer was shot and killed by police officers, who exchanged fire with the suspect when he exited his truck. Two makeshift explosive devices were found inside the vehicle and two more were discovered — and safely disposed by police — elsewhere near Bourbon Street. The Sugar Bowl was postponed from New Year's Day at 7:45 p.m. CT until today (Jan. 2), with a kickoff time of 3 p.m. CT on ESPN. The Georgia and Notre Dame football teams mostly remained at their respective hotels on Canal Street on New Year's Day as police swept nearby Bourbon Street following the vehicular terrorist attack earlier in the day. Georgia was able to secure practice space at the Superdome and scheduled and impromptu walkthrough practice Thursday evening, sources told CBS Sports. Georgia players and staffers were spotted leaving in team buses just before 6 p.m. Meanwhile, Notre Dame did not leave its team hotel. The Irish conducted a team-wide meeting at 3 p.m. before braking out into separate meetings for the offense, defense and special teams. Later, the team held a \"team run\" inside their hotel, the Hilton Riverside, near the French Quarter. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. 7-seed Notre Dame shocked 2-seed Georgia with a 23-10 victory in the Sugar Bowl to send the Fighting Irish to the national semifinals at the Orange Bowl against Penn State. The Fighting Irish used a furious rally of 17 points in 54 seconds around the halftime break to take control of the game and never looked back. The Irish and Bulldogs were held scoreless in the first quarter, marking the first CFP game without first-quarter points since 2018. After Notre Dame kicker Mitch Jeter nailed a field goal to push the score to 6-3 Irish with 39 seconds remaining in the first half, the fireworks started. RJ Oben strip-sacked Georgia quarterback Gunner Stockton, setting up a 13-yard touchdown pass by Notre Dame quarterback Riley Leonard to Beaux Collins the next play. Then on the opening kickoff of the third quarter, Jayden Harrison took the kickoff 98 yards for a touchdown to push the lead to 20-3. Notre Dame only put together ield goal drives outside the stretch, but the defense held long enough to escape the Superdome with a historic victory. In relief of injured Carson Beck, Stockton was strong. The sophomore from Rabun County, Georgia, threw for 234 yards and a touchdown in his first career start. However, the Bulldogs' offensive line struggled mightily, giving up nine tackles for loss and four sacks as the Fighting Irish defense feasted. Notre Dame mustered only 213 yards of offense, but it didn't matter. Leonard rushed for 80 yards to lead the Irish. CBS Sports was here with updates, highlights and analysis from the Sugar Bowl. Read on below for takeaways from Notre Dame's win over Georgia. Notre Dame controlled two sequences of the game, and Georgia couldn't retaliate Thursday afternoon in the Superdome. The 17-point onslaught in a span of only 54 seconds and eight combined plays did the damage, with Riley Leonard's touchdown pass after a Georgia fumble late in the first half and Jayden Harrison's 98-yard touchdown return. Then, with the game on the line, Marcus Freeman dug deep into his bag of tricks and frustrated the heck out of Georgia's coaching staff. With fewer than eight minutes remaining, Freeman sent his punting unit on the field, but then subbed them for the offense on fourth down. The decision resulted in Georgia jumping offsides after it replaced its special teams with the defense. That first down extended Notre Dame's drive, and the Irish nearly never relinquished the ball, controlling it for an incredible 7:36. They burned the clock, driving to midfield before punting the ball away with 1:49 remaining in the game. That's all it took for the Irish to win. Their offensive line, shorthanded all season, simply leaned on Georgia's stout defensive front and won the battle. This isn't the same Notre Dame team you've seen in previous years. They're stout up front and they have the speed to match. Georgia had an identity problem in 2024, and for the first time in six years, the season ended with a loss. The Bulldogs don't have a quarterback problem. Gunner Stockton was an absolute gamer in the face of intense pressure — both because of the venue, circumstances and because of Notre Dame's furious pass rush. The offensive line, as it has this season, struggled to open holes for running backs and were leaky against another defensive front. Meanwhile, the defense was pushed around up front and gave up too many chunk plays in big situations. That's not necessarily a killer, especially in a game in which the defense only gave up 16 points. No, the biggest issue for Georgia is at receiver. The Bulldogs' receiving corps has dropped at least 36 passes during the 2024 season, including a massive drop on a would-be touchdown by Dillon Bell in the third quarter, according to ESPN's research. That is unacceptable for any championship-chasing team, and it's a big reason why the Bulldogs trailed at halftime in seven games this season — and lost three. Help is on the way with the 2025 recruiting class. Five signees rank in the top 75 at their position, including top-10 receiver Talyn Taylor. This isn't the Notre Dame you've grown to love — or love to hate. The Fighting Irish have built a program that can beat you with speed and lean on your with power. Its defense is relentless and the offense has enough explosiveness and physicality to put games to bed. This is nothing new this season. Notre Dame has done this to practically every opponent on the schedule. The Irish may not put up big yardage, but they are opportunistic. They entered the Sugar Bowl ranked third nationally in turnover margin, and two key fumbles led to points and frustrated Georgia, which seemed poise to score early in the first quarter before running back Trevor Etienne lost the first fumble of his career. Freeman calls this team a bunch of \"misfits,\" players who are obsessed with football and doing everything they can to push themselves — and opponents — to the limit. The stat sheet wasn't full of quarterback sacks, but the Irish were in Gunner Stockton's face all afternoon. Credit the Georgia quarterback for firing passes in just enough time to avoid the sack, but he couldn't do it all day, and that led to a trio of sacks and a fumble in the first half. 7-seed Notre Dame shocked 2-seed Georgia with a 23-10 victory in the Sugar Bowl to send the Fighting Irish to the national semifinals at the Orange Bowl against Penn State. The Fighting Irish used a furious rally of 17 points in 54 seconds around the halftime break to take control of the game and never looked back. The Irish and Bulldogs were held scoreless in the first quarter, marking the first CFP game without first-quarter points since 2018. After Notre Dame kicker Mitch Jeter nailed a field goal to push the score to 6-3 Irish with 39 seconds remaining in the first half, the fireworks started. RJ Oben strip-sacked Georgia quarterback Gunner Stockton, setting up a 13-yard touchdown pass by Notre Dame quarterback Riley Leonard to Beaux Collins the next play. Then on the opening kickoff of the third quarter, Jayden Harrison took the kickoff 98 yards for a touchdown to push the lead to 20-3. Notre Dame only put together ield goal drives outside the stretch, but the defense held long enough to escape the Superdome with a historic victory. In relief of injured Carson Beck, Stockton was strong. The sophomore from Rabun County, Georgia, threw for 234 yards and a touchdown in his first career start. However, the Bulldogs' offensive line struggled mightily, giving up nine tackles for loss and four sacks as the Fighting Irish defense feasted. Notre Dame mustered only 213 yards of offense, but it didn't matter. Leonard rushed for 80 yards to lead the Irish. Georgia was set to get the ball back with under 8 minutes remaining but then Marcus Freeman pulled out a trick from a sleeve: he subbed the entire punting unit for the offense, and after the Bulldogs made their substitutions, quarterback Riley Leonard's snap count managed to draw an offsides penalty. The play resulted in a first down and may have put the game away for the Irish as the clock now ticks below 5 minutes remaining in regulation. Notre Dame survived a scare in the red zone thanks to its tremendous defense coming up big again. Jack Kiser was flagged for pass interference on an incomplete pass that would have been a turnover on downs, but the 15-yard penalty on fourth-and-13 kept the Georgia drive alive — and it sent Notre Dame coach Marcus Freeman into a tizzy on the sideline as he ripped into the officials. Later, on fourth-and-5 at the 9, the Irish got pressure again and Gunner Stockton fired a pass over the head of his receiver in the end zone to turn the ball over on downs with 9:25 remaining. Georgia attacked the edges in the run game and had plenty of success before stalling in Georgia territory, where Mitch Jeter hit his third long field goal of the afternoon to push the Irish ahead 23-10 with 13:47 remaining. Jeter's field goal was good from 47 yards. He hit a 48-yarder earlier today. Georgia's defense stepped up with a stop on fourth down and Notre Dame followed suit. Al Golden called a blitz on fourth-and-2, leading to a chase for Gunner Stockton, who fired a pass short of the first-down markers to give the Irish the ball again with under four minutes remaining in the third quarter. Both defenses have been remarkable this afternoon, for the most part, but it's those two turnovers by the Irish D that has been the difference. Georgia's defense held strong in the trenches, stopping Riley Leonard short of a first down on fourth-and-1 near midfield. The turnover on downs with under 6 minutes remaining in the third quarter fives Georgia an opportunity to make this a one-score game again. Georgia appears to have the momentum here in the Superdome, where Bulldog fans have come to life again. Gunner Stockton is on a heater, and offensive coordinator Mike Bobo is dialing up some fantastic play calls. Georgia receivers ran free on three plays on this scoring drive, which ended with Cash Jones stumbling into the end zone for a 32-yard touchdown catch down the left sideline. The Bulldogs' receiving corps needed that play after a terrible drop by Dillon Bell, who was wide open coming across the middle of the field but dropped a perfectly-placed ball near the 20-yard line. It would have easily been a walk-in touchdown. It didn't matter in the end thanks to Bobo and Stockton hitting on all cylinders, from the coaches' box to the field at the Superdome. That drive chewed up 63 yards on only five plays. If you were wondering, Georgia receivers have dropped 36 passes this season. Notre Dame needed only 11 seconds to score 10 points in the final minute of the first half. They needed only 15 seconds to score another touchdown on a 98-yard kick return by Jayden Harrison at the start of the second half. Harrison pierced the middle, then leaked to the right sideline, dodging a would-be tackler before sprinting home for the 98-yard score to open the third quarter. Georgia fans might outnumber the Notre Dame faithful, but the Superdome is electric with Irish fans raising the decibel levels here in New Orleans. We expected a defensive battle and we've got it, but the big difference here is Notre Dame's tenacious defense forcing two turnovers. Notre Dame zoomed to a 10-0 run in the final minute of the first half thanks to a field goal and a strip-sack of Gunner Stockton, which led to Riley Leonard hitting Beaux Collins for a 13-yard touchdown pass. This game has been defined by taking advantage of opportunities. Georgia blew what could have been two touchdown drives with a fumble by Trevor Etienne deep in Notre Dame's territory (his first lost fumble ever (425 touches, per CBS Sports Research), and a sideline interference on a 67-yard catch at the 11-yard line. That penalty on walk-on Parker Jones pushed Georgia back to the 26-yard line, where the Bulldogs stalled and settled for a field goal. Notre Dame entered today ranked third nationally in turnover margin, and the Irish are again winning the turnover battle in their biggest game of the season. The quarterback run game has also frustrated Georgia. Leonard has rushed for 50 yards on six carries, picking up four first downs on those totes. He's also 10 of 15 passing for 60 yards and one touchdown. Stockton is 9 of 14 passing for 142 yards with the lost fumble. Georgia is averaging only 0.5 yards per carry thanks to three sacks for minus-32 yards by the Notre Dame defense. Notre Dame kicked a field goal and then forced a fumble on Gunner Stockton in the final minute to score 10 points in 11 seconds to grab a 13-3 at halftime. Here's how the coaches responded on the ESPN broadcast as they headed to the locker room at halftime: Kirby Smart, Georgia coach: \"We tried to be aggressive in 2-minute and probably regret it, right? Go to the half 6-3, we want to show confidence in our quarterback, let him go play, we didn't get the block we needed to get and they made a good play.\" Notre Dame coach Marcus Freeman: \"It's a great way to end the half. We gotta win the turnover margin and we capitalized off it on offense but this is going to be a 60-plus minute game. You watch this Georgia team all year and you know they're not going to quit. So we've got to be in attack mode and not feel comfortable. We've got to be in attack mode as soon as we come out of the locker room.\" Georgia opted to pass in the final 33 seconds of the first half, and that proved to be a terrible decision by coach Kirby Smart. Gunner Stockton was strip-sacked by RJ Oben on the Bulldogs' first play of the drive and, Junior Tuihalamaka recovered the loose ball at the 13-yard line. Riley Leonard hit receiver Beaux Collins in the middle of the end zone on the ensuing play to give Notre Dame a 13-3 lead going into halftime. It scored 10 points in 11 seconds. Georgia has had three costly mistakes — two turnovers — and a sideline interference penalty on walk-on Parker Jones. All three cost the Bulldogs points. Mitch Jeter drilled a 48-yard field goal to give Notre Dame its first lead of the game with 38 seconds remaining in the first half. Riley Leonard was the captain of that drive, which spanned 32 yards. He scrambled a couple of times, and managed to make up some ground on a 10-yard keeper after what could have been a momentum-changing sack by the Georgia defense. Georgia linebacker CJ Allen blew up running back Aneyas Williams, allowing Small Mondon, Jr. a clear path through the backfield on a twist to sack Riley Leonard for a huge 11-yard sack that pushed the Irish back to the 40-yard line. Notre Dame didn't need long to fire back at Georgia. Riley Leonard picked up 32 yards on a keeper to push the Irish into Georgia territory, but the offense stalled on a three-yard rush and back-to-back passes that went nowhere. Mitch Jeter converted a 44-yard field kick to tie the game and cap an eight-play, 49-yard drive with 8:20 remaining in the second quarter. Boy, Georgia walk-on Parker Jones hopes he won't be a name to remember. An official streaking down the sideline on a 67-yard catch by Arian Smith bumped into Jones and was flagged for sideline interference, a 15-yarder. The Bulldogs went from the 11-yard line to the 27, where the offense stalled and settled for a 41-yard field goal. There have been several haymakers already, and success seems as if it'll be found in the margins. To wit, that pass to Smith was a beauty down the right sideline from Stockton, and Smith blew past All-American safety Xavier Watts by at least a step. It hasn't been a clean game, but each team's had its moments.

Meanwhile, Notre Dame's offense has mostly sputtered with a pair of penalties, including an illegal forward pass by Riley Leonard. The Irish enter the second quarter with a third-and-11 and only 16 yards of offense. Both teams had a combined -21 yards after their first possession. Georgia attacked the middle of the field on back-to-back pass plays on its second possession, picking up nine yards each time on throws to tight end Dillon Bell and receiver Dominic Lovett, who ran a drag route across the field. The plays helped push Georgia into Notre Dame territory. The Bulldogs were helped once again by undisciplined play by the Irish with an offsides on second-and-8, which should have been a minimal game on a keeper by quarterback Gunner Stockton.

                "content": "Notre Dame has secured the final spot in the College Football Playoff semifinals. It did so by knocking off No. 2 Georgia in the CFP Sugar Bowl quarterfinal Thursday at New Orleans’ Caesar Superdome by a score of 23-10. With the win, Notre Dame not only secured a statement win against one of the SEC’s top programs, but also picked up its first ever win against Georgia. The Irish entered Thursday’s game 0-3 against the Bulldogs, including a loss in the 1981 Sugar Bowl. The turning point for the Irish came in the final seconds of the first half, when Notre Dame scored 10 points in a span of 11 seconds. After Mitch Jeter converted a 48-yard field goal to give Notre Dame a 6-3 lead, RJ Oben strip-sacked Georgia's Gunner Stockton. Following a Notre Dame recovery, quarterback Riley Leonard found Beaux Collins in the end zone for a 13-yard touchdown. Jayden Harrison followed that up with a 98-yard kickoff return for a touchdown. Though it gave up a wide-open third quarter touchdown, Harrison's kickoff return would be all Notre Dame needed to pull out the win. This was due in part because of a stellar performance from Notre Dame's defense in the second half, as it caused two consecutive turnovers on downs. The Irish's CFP quarterfinals win vs. No. 2 Georgia was postponed following a terrorist attack that killed 15 and injured at least 30 more early Wednesday morning in New Orleans. Notre Dame will now have a quick turnaround to prepare for their next game, as they are set to take on No. 6 Penn State in the CFP Orange Bowl semifinals at Hard Rock Stadium on Thursday, Jan. 9 at 7:30 p.m. ET. With that, follow along for a recap of updates, scores and highlights from the Sugar Bowl between the Irish and the Bulldogs: REQUIRED READING:Will Notre Dame beat Georgia in CFP? Early bracket predictions for Sugar Bowl quarterfinal (This section has been updated with new information) Notre Dame is onto the College Football Playoff Orange Bowl semifinals with a 23-10 upset win over No. 2 Georgia in the 2025 Sugar Bowl. Donovan Hinish sealed the win for Notre Dame with a sack on fourth-and-6. Notre Dame is two minutes away from advancing to the CFP Orange Bowl semifinals against No. 6 Penn State, as the Irish lead Georgia 23-10 in the fourth quarter of the Sugar Bowl. Punt coming up for the Irish on fourth-and-8 at their 50-yard line. Georgia's defense still has no answer for Riley Leonard, as the Notre Dame quarterback picks up an impressive first down with a 9-yard carry on third-and-7. After the run, Leonard now has 74 rushing yards on 12 carries on the night.

Riley Leonard was the game's offensive MVP after completing 14 of 23 passes for 88 yards and a touchdown and 66 yards rushing. Notre Dame used a 17-0 burst in the final minute of the first half and the opening minute of the second half to take a 20-3 lead and protected that down the stretch. The game began as a defensive battle, as neither team scored in the first quarter. Then, Georgia scored a field goal first, but it could’ve been a touchdown if not for a crucial sidelines interference penalty on an Arian Smith 66-yard catch. Notre Dame added two field goals of its own to take a three-point lead, which appeared to be the case entering halftime.

Leonard immediately threw a touchdown pass to give the Fighting Irish a 10-point halftime lead. Then, as Notre Dame received the ball after halftime, Jayden Harrison took the kickoff 98 yards for a score to open up a 20-3 lead on Georgia. In total, Notre Dame scored 14 points in under one minute of game-time. That was all the offense Notre Dame needed, as their defense held Georgia to just 10 points in the game. Gunner Stockton got the start for Georgia in place of an injured Carson Beck, but the quarterback had an up-and-down game. He was 18 for 29 for 225 yards and a touchdown, but he was also sacked three times. The Sugar Bowl was delayed a day after an attack in New Orleans' French Quarter on New Year’s Day killed 14 people, and extra security was on hand. Ultimately, the game went off without a hitch, on Thursday. With the win, the Fighting Irish advance to the Orange Bowl, where they will play Penn State in the College Football Playoff semifinals.

The game was the 91st annual playing of the Sugar Bowl and one of the quarterfinals of the 2024–25 College Football Playoff (CFP) concluding the 2024 FBS football season. The game featured two of the twelve teams chosen by the selection committee to participate in the playoff: the No. 7 seed Notre Dame Fighting Irish, an FBS independent, and the No. 2 seed Georgia Bulldogs from the Southeastern Conference (SEC). The winner qualified for the Orange Bowl CFP semifinal to be played against the winner of the Fiesta Bowl. The game was originally scheduled to be played on January 1 but was postponed to the following day due to a terrorist attack in the nearby French Quarter early on the morning of New Year's Day. Notre Dame entered the game with a record of (12–1), while Georgia entered 11–2. The Bulldogs, by virtue of their victory in the SEC Championship and their place among the four highest-ranked conference champions, received a first-round bye in the CFP, making this game their first in the playoff. Notre Dame was ranked No. 5 by the playoff committee in their final rankings and received the No. 7 seed. They defeated No. 10 seed Indiana in the first round, earning them a berth in the quarterfinals. Georgia, playing without starting quarterback Carson Beck due to injury, entered the game as slight underdogs despite their higher seeding. Notre Dame defeated Georgia by a 23–10 score, winning their first major (New Year's Six) bowl game since the 1994 Cotton Bowl Classic, having lost their 10 most recent such appearances. They advance to the 2025 Orange Bowl, against Penn State, in the CFP semifinals. The Sugar Bowl was held at Tulane Stadium in New Orleans from its inception in 1935 until 1974; since 1975 it has been held in Caesars Superdome (formerly the Louisiana Superdome and the Mercedes-Benz Superdome).[3] The Sugar Bowl became part of the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) from its first year in 1998 and hosted the BCS National Championship Game in 2000 and 2004.[4][5][6] After the establishment of the College Football Playoff (CFP) beginning with the 2014 season, it hosted CFP semifinal games in 2015, 2018, 2021, and 2024 prior to the quarterfinal contest in 2025.[7] The twelve teams participating in the playoff were chosen by the CFP selection committee, whose final rankings were released on December 8, 2024.[8] This was the first edition of the CFP to feature twelve teams instead of four, and the Sugar Bowl was assigned to host a quarterfinal game. The Georgia Bulldogs, having just defeated Texas in the SEC Championship, were ranked No. 2 and received the No. 2 seed as they were the second-highest-ranked conference champion. By virtue of their top-four seed, they received a first-round bye and qualified directly for the Sugar Bowl quarterfinal. The game's other participant was decided by a first-round game between No. 7 seed Notre Dame and No. 10 seed Indiana, played at Notre Dame Stadium on December 20.[9] Notre Dame defeated Indiana, 27–17, qualifying them for the quarterfinal matchup with Georgia.[10] Georgia entered the game with a 11–2 record, while Notre Dame entered 12–1 following their first-round win.[11] The game was originally scheduled to be held at 7:45 p.m. local CST on January 1, 2025. In the early morning of January 1, a terrorist attack took place on Bourbon Street in New Orleans in which fifteen people were killed.[12] Sugar Bowl officials and law enforcement personnel initially announced that the game would go on as scheduled,[13][14] but another announcement was made later that afternoon that the game would be postponed to 3:00 p.m. on the following day.[15] Security for the event was tightened[16] and the game ultimately took place without incident.[17] This was the fourth meeting between the Bulldogs and the Fighting Irish,[18] following a 2017 and 2019 home-and-home series where Georgia won both games. The two teams had previously met in the postseason once, in the 1981 Sugar Bowl, a 17–10 Georgia win. Though Georgia has won all three previous meetings, each game was decided by seven points or less. The bowl game was the 12th Sugar Bowl appearance for the Bulldogs with a record of 5–6 in prior editions, with the program's latest appearance being the 2020 game.[19] Georgia entered the game as the SEC champions, with an 11–2 record (6–2 in conference).[20] Second-string quarterback Gunner Stockton started for the Bulldogs after regular starter Carson Beck injured his throwing elbow in the Bulldogs' overtime SEC Championship victory over Texas and underwent season-ending surgery.[21] Beck eventually declared for the 2025 NFL draft. The bowl game was the fifth Sugar Bowl appearance for the Fighting Irish with a record of 2–2 in prior editions, with the program's latest appearance being the 2007 game. Notre Dame entered the game with a 12–1 record. Their only loss was to Northern Illinois, on September 7. The game's first score came on its fifth drive; each team punted on their first drive, Georgia's second drive ended with a fumble at the Notre Dame 16-yard line, and Notre Dame punted for a second time before Georgia took a 3–0 lead on a 41-yard Peyton Woodring field goal. Notre Dame tied the game with a field goal of their own on their following possession. After one additional Fighting Irish punt and two more from the Bulldogs, Notre Dame took their first lead with 39 seconds until halftime on another successful field goal. On Georgia's next play, RJ Oben sacked Gunner Stockton as he was winding up to throw and Junior Tuihalamaka recovered for Notre Dame, leading to a touchdown pass from Riley Leonard to Beaux Collins and a 13–3 lead for the Fighting Irish at halftime.[22] Notre Dame extended its lead on the opening kickoff of the second half, which was returned 98 yards for a touchdown by Jayden Harrison, capping a 17-point Irish run in a span of 54 seconds of game time. Georgia punted on 4th & 3 on their next drive, and the Irish went three-and-out in response. The Bulldogs pulled within ten points on a 5-play drive that followed, ending in a 32-yard touchdown pass from Stockton to Cash Jones, but they were unable to score further. They turned the ball over on downs on each of their final two offensive possessions, while Notre Dame added a 47-yard Mitch Jeter field goal in addition to a turnover on downs. Ultimately, the Irish ran out the clock to earn a semifinal berth with a 23–10 victory.[22] at Caesars Superdome • New Orleans, Louisiana # denotes national championship game; † denotes College Football Playoff semifinal game, ‡ denotes College Football Playoff quarterfinal game # denotes national championship game; † denotes College Football Playoff semifinal game, ‡ denotes College Football Playoff quarterfinal game",

Sections Shows More Follow today More Brands Football took a back seat to tragedy on New Year's Day after a deadly truck attack in New Orleans ended with 15 people dead and dozens injured. A driver identified by authorities as a Texas-born man and Army veteran drove a truck with an ISIS flag into a crowd of New Year’s revelers on Bourbon Street at around 3:15 a.m., killing 15 and injuring at least 30, police said. The horrific attack came on a day when the University of Georgia and Notre Dame were scheduled to play a College Football Playoff quarterfinal at the Superdome in New Orleans. Here's what to know about the rescheduled game. The truck attack prompted Sugar Bowl officials to move the game to 4 p.m. ET on Jan. 2 from its originally scheduled time of 8:45 p.m. ET on New Year's Day. “Of course any time we have a major event in the city of New Orleans, public safety is paramount,” Sugar Bowl CEO Jeff Hundley said at a media briefing on Jan. 1, adding, “All parties all agree that it’s in the best interest of everybody and public safety that we postpone the game.” Hundley said organizers were in consultation with state and local officials, ESPN, which will broadcast the game, and the universities to reach the decision to move the game. \"We live in the fun-and-games world with what we do, but we certainly recognize the importance of this, and we're going to support it a hundred percent,\" Hundley said. Democratic congressman Troy Carter spoke about postponing the game. “It was done with one single thing in mind: public safety — making sure that the citizens and visitors of this great city, not only for this event, but for every event you come to in Louisiana, that you will be safe,” Carter said, according to The Associated Press. Notre Dame head coach Marcus Freeman also supported the decision. \"I have a lot of faith this country will rally around New Orleans and support all the victims of families that were affected today,\" Freeman told ESPN. The game is now scheduled for 4 p.m. ET on Jan. 2 at the 74,000-seat Superdome, the home of the NFL's New Orleans Saints. It will be broadcast live on ESPN and streamed on the ESPN app. New Orleans officials said extra security measures have been put in place for the game. \"We have bomb dogs out there sweeping the Superdome and all the exterior area that will be locked down through the game,\" New Orleans Police Department Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick said at a news conference. Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry said at a news conference on Jan. 1 that he will be in attendance at the game. \"I tell you one thing: Your governor’s going to be there,” Landry said. “That is proof, believe you me, that that facility and this city is safer today than it was yesterday.” The winner of the Georgia-Notre Dame game will advance to the CFP semifinals against Penn State, which beat Boise State 31-14 in the quarterfinals. The semifinal will be at the Orange Bowl, which is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. ET on Jan. 9 in Miami. The other semifinal is already set. Texas will play Ohio State in the Cotton Bowl at 7:30 p.m. ET on Jan. 10 in Arlington, Texas.

It is one of the oldest symbols in heraldry and is considered to be one of the most desirable to have on a coat of arms. The 'bordure' edge around the shield is a mark of difference used to identify separate families that hold similar coat of arms designs. It is one that became a distinctive mark of pride over time for those families that used one. The black color (known as Sable) symbolizes constancy and the enduring nature of the family. It is a symbol of family longevity through time. The red color (known as Gules) traditionally symbolized martyrdom and the historic military strength of family members when called upon in times of war. Skattebo is a surname of Norwegian origin, possibly derived from geographic features or historical references in Norway. The name may indicate a connection to specific locations or a heritage linked to farming or land ownership, reflecting the family’s roots in Scandinavian culture. Family crests and coats of arms emerged during the Middle Ages, mostly in wider Europe. They were used as a way to identify knights and nobles on the battlefield and in tournaments. The designs were unique to each family and were passed down from generation to generation. The earliest crests were simple designs, such as a single animal or symbol, but they became more elaborate over time. Coats of arms were also developed, which included a shield with the family crest, as well as other symbols and colors that represented the family's history and achievements. The use of family crests and coats of arms spread throughout Europe and became a symbol of social status and identity. They were often displayed on clothing, armor, and flags, and were used to mark the family's property and possessions. Today, family crests and coats of arms are still used as a way to honor and celebrate family heritage. Variations of the family name Skattebo can be intriguing, reflecting linguistic shifts and cultural adaptations across different countries. In the 17th century, the name saw variations like Skatteberg in Sweden, which emerged through the phonetic blending of regional dialects. As the 18th century progressed, migration patterns led to the variation Skattaboe in the Netherlands, where the double vowel was influenced by Dutch phonetics. Meanwhile, in the early 19th century, the name evolved into Skatibo in parts of Eastern Europe, showcasing Slavic suffixes that adapted the original structure. By the late 19th century, in America, the name transformed into Skattybo, often influenced by a desire for simplicity and ease of pronunciation among English speakers. Each variation tells a story of cultural exchange, phonetic evolution, and the adaptability of family identities through time and geography. Learn how to find your family crest.
