                "content": "Comedian Nikki Glaser hosted the ceremony. The 2025 Golden Globes kicked off awards season Sunday night as the best in film and television were honored. Brady Corbet's \"The Brutalist\" and Jacques Audiard's \"Emilia Pérez\" were big winners of the night on the film side, winning best motion picture (drama) and best motion picture (musical or comedy), respectively. \"Wicked\" took home the award for cinematic and box office achievement. On the television side, \"Shōgun,\" \"Hacks\" and \"Baby Reindeer\" won the top prizes. Comedian Nikki Glaser hosted the ceremony, which was held at Los Angeles' famed Beverly Hilton. Check out a recap of how the night unfolded below. \"Emilia Pérez\" won the Golden Globe for best motion picture (non-English language). Director Jacques Audiard accepted the award, saying through an interpreter that he doesn't have any sisters, but that it \"might be the reason why I made this film about sisterhood.\" He then thanked \"all the sisters at the Hollywood Foreign Press Association\" and \"all my sisters at Netflix,\" giving a special shoutout to \"Emilia Pérez\" star Karla Sofía Gascón. Audiard added, \"In these troubled times, I hope 'Emilia Pérez' will be a beacon of light.\" Other nominees in the category included \"All We Imagine as Light,\" \"The Girl with the Needle,\" \"I'm Still Here,\" \"The Seed of the Sacred Fig\" and \"Vermiglio.\" Colin Farrell won the Golden Globe for best performance by a male actor in a limited series, anthology series or a motion picture made for television for \"The Penguin.\" \"It takes a village, whether it's on the small screen or the big screen. I'm here on the backs of the talents of so many people through the years -- maybe this one more than others,\" he said, shouting out the team that transformed him into Oswald \"Oz\" Cobb on the series. This is Farrell's third Golden Globe win, having previously won for \"In Bruges\" and \"The Banshees of Inisherin.\" Other nominees in the category included Richard Gadd for \"Baby Reindeer,\" Kevin Kline for \"Disclaimer,\" Cooper Koch for \"Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story,\" Ewan McGregor for \"A Gentleman in Moscow\" and Andrew Scott for \"Ripley.\" Ali Wong won the Golden Globe for best performance in stand-up comedy on television for \"Ali Wong: Single Lady.\" Other nominees in the category included Jamie Foxx for \"Jamie Foxx: What Had Happened Was…\", Nikki Glaser for \"Nikki Glaser: Someday You'll Die,\" Seth Meyers for \"Seth Meyers: Dad Man Walking,\" Adam Sandler for \"Adam Sandler: Love You\" and Ramy Youssef for \"Ramy Youssef: More Feelings.\" Peter Straughan won the Golden Globe for best screenplay for \"Conclave.\" \"I am just one pure ball of gratitude squeezed into a tux,\" Straughan said, thanking those involved with the film. Other nominees in the category included Jacques Audiard for \"Emilia Pérez,\" Sean Baker for \"Anora,\" Brady Corbet and Mona Fastvold for \"The Brutalist,\" Jesse Eisenberg for \"A Real Pain” and Coralie Fargeat for \"The Substance.”",

Watch NBC News' four-minute video of biggest moments of the night. Saba Hamedy Demi Moore's family posted their excitement over her Golden Globe win. In a joint post on Instagram, Moore's daughters shared a video of them celebrating the moment she won at home, with the caption \"SHE DID IT.\" Angela Yang Karla Sofía Gascón, who plays the title character in “Emilia Pérez,” addressed viewers onstage after the musical won the final award of the night: best film (musical/comedy). Gascón, who made history as the first openly transgender woman to be nominated for a Globe for a leading film role, said she wore an orange gown to share a message to viewers. \"The light always wins over darkness,\" she said. “You can maybe put us in jail. You can beat us up. But you never can take away our soul, our resistance, our identity.\" Rebecca Cohen For film, the top two winners were \"Emilia Pérez\" with four wins and \"The Brutalist\" with three. On the TV side, \"Shōgun\" won four awards. \"Hacks\" and \"Baby Reindeer\" each took home two awards. Saba Hamedy And the show ran only about 10 minutes overtime. Daniel Arkin \"The Brutalist\" now appears to have the edge over \"Conclave\" in the race for best picture at the Oscars in March. The film, a three-and-a-half-hour epic about the postwar Jewish immigrant experience and the trauma of the Holocaust, earned three trophies tonight: best drama film, best director (for Brady Corbet, who co-wrote the project with his partner, Mona Fastvold) and best actor (Adrian Brody). In his acceptance speech, Corbet said he was told that \"The Brutalist\" was \"undistributable\" and that \"no one would come out and see it.\" He said the critical success of the film serves as a reminder that the industry should take chances on bold and unorthodox projects. \"Final cut tiebreak goes to the director,\" Corbet said. “Emilia Pérez” “The Brutalist” Daniel Arkin Adrien Brody, tonight's winner for best actor in a drama for his role as a war-scarred architect in \"The Brutalist,\" looks poised for a second Academy Award in March — more than 20 years after he triumphed for \"The Pianist,\" another searing drama about an artist who survives the Holocaust. Brody, in his acceptance speech, nodded to his fellow nominees and praised them for reaching \"such heights\" in their film work. He also paid tearful tribute to his parents and ancestors. \"I owe so much to my mother and grandparents for their sacrifice,\" Brody said. \"Although I do not know fully how to express fully all the challenges that you have faced and experienced, and the many people who have struggled immigrating to this country, I hope that this work stands to lift you up a bit and to give you a voice. I’m so grateful. I will cherish this moment forever.\" Daniel Arkin Fernanda Torres victory for her lead role in the Brazilian drama \"I'm Still Here\" is notable partly because the movie hasn't been released in theaters yet. It comes out in the United States later this month via Sony Pictures Classics. Rebecca Cohen Fernanda Torres dedicated her win for best actress (drama) to her mom. The “I’m Still Here\" actress said she didn't prepare anything for a speech tonight \"because I am glad already\" and called out the phenomenal performances of the other women nominated in the category, like Nicole Kidman, Angelina Jolie and Kate Winslet. Her mother, who was at the Globes 25 years ago, \"Art can endure through life,\" Torres said. \"This is a film that helps us think how to survive in tough times like this.\" Adrien Brody, “The Brutalist” Fernanda Torres, “I’m Still Here” Daniel Arkin Nearly all the big wins in the television categories have felt like replays of last year's Emmy Awards, where — you guessed it — \"Shōgun,\" \"Hacks\" and \"Baby Reindeer\" were dominant start to finish. It's a reminder that the overlap between awards shows like the Globes and the Emmys can inspire a feeling of déjà vu that's obviously great for the victors but perhaps creates a feeling of overfamiliarity for viewers at home. Daniel Arkin This year's race for best picture at the Academy Awards is unusually wide open — at least compared to last year, when \"Oppenheimer\" established itself as the clear favorite early and often. It's possible we're seeing the start of a big push for Netflix's \"Emilia Pérez,\" which went into tonight with a leading 10 nominations. It has won three so far, and it could win best musical/comedy film. If so, don't be surprised if Hollywood types start penciling in \"Emilia\" as a tentative Oscar front-runner. But there's reason for skepticism here. The voting body behind the Globes is international, made up of journalists who might have responded positively to a foreign-language film set in Mexico and other countries. I wonder whether the average Oscar voter might be more partial to projects such as \"Conclave,\" \"The Brutalist\" and/or \"Wicked.\" Angela Yang “Shōgun” star Anna Sawai, accepting her first-ever Golden Globes win for best actress in a TV drama, gave an emotional but brief speech of appreciation. “Thank you to our incredible writers. Without a good script, it’s impossible to give a performance to our fullest potential,” Sawai said. “Thank you. Everyone else, I’m going to thank you later.” “Shōgun” Anna Sawai, “Shōgun” Rebecca Cohen Deborah Vance’s winning streak continues. The HBO show \"Hacks,\" which follows the fictional stand-up comic played by Jean Smart, took home the Golden Globe for best TV series (comedy or musical) for its third season. Paul W. Downs, the show's creator, showrunner, executive producer, writer and director, joked that the cast and crew are back on set tomorrow bright and early. \"We do have to shoot tomorrow and we have a call time of 6 a.m. So if Jean Smart asks you for a shot, please do not give it to her,\" he joked. \"OK, Kate Winslet, I'm looking at you, wherever you are. Give her water, OK? Give her water if she wants it.\" He softened by the end: \"OK, just a little shot, maybe one.\" Mike Calia The categories left are: best actress, TV drama; best TV series, drama; best film actress, drama; best film actor, drama; best film, drama; and best film, musical or comedy. “Hacks” Angela Yang Accepting the award for best limited series, anthology series or TV movie, “Baby Reindeer” creator and star Richard Gadd said he believes audiences had been “crying out for something that spoke to the kind of painful inconsistencies of being human.” “I think right now, when the world’s in the state that it’s in and people are really struggling, we need stories that speak to the complicated and difficult nature of our times,” Gadd said. Chloe Melas Brady Corbet’s win for directing “The Brutalist” triggered chatter among celebs and industry insiders that they need to see the 3.5-hour historical epic. One attendee said most people at their table hadn’t seen the movie, which has been in only limited release for a couple weeks in New York and LA. Those who had seen the movie, though, raved about the visually stunning film, which stars Adrien Brody. The Oscar nominations, by the way, are scheduled to be announced Jan. 17. “Baby Reindeer” Daniel Arkin In an impassioned speech, \"Wicked\" director Jon M. Chu waxed poetic about the importance of uniting around inspiring stories. He also called on viewers to take a page from his movie's hero, Elphaba (played by Cynthia Erivo). \"Rise up and take the road off the Yellow Brick Road and maybe discover we can fly,\" he said. Daniel Arkin The hit musical grossed more than $432 million in North America, according to Box Office Mojo, a website that aggregates ticket sales data. It's a massive haul, though it came short of the money pulled in by \"Inside Out 2\" ($652 million) and \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" ($636 million). (\"Wicked\" was distributed by Universal Pictures, a unit of NBC News' parent company, NBCUniversal.) “Wicked” Sophia PargasSophia Pargas is a news associate for NBC News. Several long pauses and awkward intros have seemingly interrupted the flow of this year's ceremony. Presenters often appear flustered or confused. It's not helping viewers at home. “El Mal” from \"Emilia Pérez” Daniel Arkin Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross became two of the most revered, in-demand film composers in Hollywood with their jittery, synth-heavy soundtrack for David Fincher's \"The Social Network.\" They won an Oscar for that score, then another for Pixar's \"Soul,\" plus equivalent honors at the Golden Globes. Now they're taking home more gold for \"Challengers.\" The propulsive and dance-friendly synth score they wrote for \"Challengers\" is also up for a Grammy next month. Sophia PargasSophia Pargas is a news associate for NBC News. Host Glaser is showing off her personality through more than just her hilarious monologue and roasts — she's using fashion, too. In her many outfit changes, Glaser has adorned several colorful sequin gowns, including a a gold dress for the carpet, silver metallic dress for her monologue and a pink sequin gown for her \"Glicked\" bit. She continues to impress by diverting from the typical neutrals synonymous with \"Hollywood glam\" and instead offering her own personal flare. Angela Yang Before he presented the award for best film score, Elton John took a moment to joke about his vision. “It’s very special night for me to be here, because I don’t know if you know, but there’s been a lot of stories going on around about my regressive eyesight, and I just wanted to reassure everybody that it’s not as bad as it seems,” John said, standing next to Brandi Carlile. “So I’m so pleased to be here with my co-host, Rihanna.” Daniel Arkin In a heartfelt acceptance speech, \"The Brutalist\" director Brady Corbet paid tribute to fellow independent filmmaker Jeff Baena, who died over the weekend. Baena was married to actor Aubrey Plaza. Corbet, who won the best director prize, also recognized the deaths of three other people in his life: his grandfather, his grandfather's brother and a dear friend. The filmmaker's young daughter wept in the audience as her dad read his remarks off an iPhone. The win for Corbet, 36, cements him as a major contender heading into the Oscars. \"The Brutalist\" is his third feature-length work as a director and indisputably the most high-profile yet. The film, shot on 35mm celluloid, tells the story of a Hungarian Holocaust survivor who attempts to start a new life in the U.S. as an architect. Corbet got his start as a teen actor, appearing in edgy movies such as \"Thirteen,\" \"Mysterious Skin\" and \"Funny Games.\" Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross, “Challengers” Angela Yang Accepting the award for “Flow,” which just won best animated movie, director Gints Zilbalodis took the stage to note that the film “was made by a very small, young but very passionate team in a place where there isn’t a big film industry.” “This is the first time that a film from Latvia has been here,” Zilbalodis added, standing alongside producers Matīss Kaža and Ron Dyens. “So this is huge for us.” Daniel Arkin When it came to the best animated film category, \"Flow\" — an 85-minute tale about a cat in peril, with no dialogue — went up against blockbusters from major studios, including \"Inside Out 2\" (Disney) and \"The Wild Robot\" (Universal). \"Flow\" was distributed in the U.S. by a relatively small company — Janus Films, which typically handles small art-house releases such as \"Drive My Car\" and \"EO.\" Brady Corbet, “The Brutalist” Angela Yang During a midshow recap, Nikki Glaser noted that \"comebacks\" for female actors have become common in the last year. “If you’re a woman over 50 in a lead role, they call it a comeback,” Glaser said. “If you’re a guy over 50 in a lead role, congratulations — you’re about to play Sydney Sweeney’s boyfriend.” “Flow\" Chloe Melas At 82, Harrison Ford, known as Han Solo and Indiana Jones to generations of moviegoers, is having yet another big moment in a career full of them. The second season of Apple TV's \"Shrinking just wrapped last month, and now he's going to appear in \"1923\" season two next month — and make his first appearance in a Marvel movie, as Red Hulk in the new \"Captain America.\" Daniel Arkin Stan, accepting the award for best actor in a comedy film for \"A Different Man,\" a dark comedy about a man whose neurofibromatosis causes facial disfigurement, called for a new chapter in Hollywood. \"Our ignorance and our discomfort around disability and disfigurement has to end now,\" he said, adding that the industry should \"champion stories that are inclusive.\" In the movie, Stan plays a lonely man who undergoes an experimental treatment that cures his condition and starts a new life as a wealthy real estate agent. But then he meets a charismatic, successful man who also has neurofibromatosis, throwing his sense of self into disarray. Stan is also nominated tonight for his lead role in the drama film \"The Apprentice,\" a portrait of the early years of President-elect Donald Trump. Sophia PargasSophia Pargas is a news associate for NBC News. Several presenters have visibly and audibly struggled to open the winners' envelopes onstage tonight, causing minor delays but hilarious points of comedic relief and anticipation. \"Strong-a-- tape,\" Andrew Garfield said as he presented the award for best film actor. Saba Hamedy Moore gave an emotional speech for her win for \"The Substance,\" reflecting on her 40-plus years in the industry. \"This is the first time I’ve ever won anything as an actor. I’m just so humbled and so grateful,\" she said. \"Thirty years ago I had a producer tell me that I was a popcorn actress, and at that time, I made that mean that this wasn’t something I was allowed to have. That I could do movies that were successful but that I couldn’t be acknowledged. I bought in and I believed that. That corroded me over time to the point where I thought a few years ago that maybe this was it, maybe that this was complete, that I’ve done what I’m supposed to do.\" Then, \"The Substance\" came along, which she called a \"magical, bold, courageous, out of the box, absolutely bonkers script.\" She encouraged people to know their worth. Sebastian Stan, “A Different Man” Demi Moore, “The Substance” Rebecca Cohen Did the Globes decide to ditch lengthy acceptance speeches for these oddly long award intros? Halfway through the show and it certainly seems like that's the case. Rebecca Cohen Legendary actor Foster is taking home her fifth Golden Globe tonight, this time for her role in \"True Detective: Night Country.\" In her speech, she called out Icelanders and Indigenous people who shared their stories with those on the show, saying they \"changed my life.\" She also gave a shout out to her son, who is starting his acting career. \"Hopefully you understand the joy, such joy, of doing really hard, meaningful, good work,\" she said. Jodie Foster, “True Detective: Night Country” Daniel Arkin In the early 2000s, Hollywood positioned Colin Farrell as a conventional movie star in thrillers like \"Phone Booth,\" \"The Recruit\" and Marvel's \"Daredevil.\" But in recent years, as Farrell entered his late 40s, he has gravitated to more eccentric projects, including Yorgos Lanthimos' \"The Killing of a Sacred Deer\" and Kogonada's \"After Yang.\" \"The Penguin,\" a big-budget HBO miniseries that required Farrell to don elaborate prosthetics and makeup that rendered him all but unrecognizable, is the latest example of Farrell's mid-career swerve into the unexpected. It's a popular series based on a famous comic book character but very much not a part that traded on Farrell's leading man looks. Chloe Melas Insiders at the Globes are saying Zoe Saldaña has had the best speech of the night so far. One attendee said her speech was so good that she has the “Oscars on lock.” Nominations for the Academy Awards will be announced this month. It wasn’t just her speech that had people talking, but the admiration by her \"Emilia Pérez\" co-star Selena Gomez, who jumped up when Saldaña won. Gomez was also nominated in the same category. Angela Yang Colin Farrell kicked off his acceptance speech with a cheeky joke — “No one to thank on this one, I did it all by myself” — before going on to thank a slew of people who worked on “The Penguin.” “Oh, Golden Globes, thanks, as well. Yeah, whoever else I forgot, I do apologize,” Farrell concluded. “You know what you mean to me.” This is his third Golden Globe. Daniel Arkin The triumph of \"Emilia Pérez\" in the non-English-language film category illustrates that this genre-smashing musical is a formidable awards contender heading into the Oscars. \"Emilia\" beat out \"All We Imagine as Light\" and \"The Seed of the Sacred Fig,\" two of the most universally praised foreign-language films of the last year, underscoring the spell \"Emilia\" has evidently cast on industry insiders and voters. In his acceptance speech, one of the film's producers paid tribute to the global transgender community. The film's title character is a trans woman. Colin Farrell, “The Penguin” “Emilia Pérez” Angela Yang Actor and comedian Ali Wong is now a two-time Golden Globe winner. In her short but sweet acceptance speech, she gave a shoutout to the San Francisco comedy scene. \"That’s where I started doing stand-up, and I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for all the stage time that I got there and all the practice I got to become a stand-up comedian,\" she said. Ali Wong, “Single Lady” Rebecca Cohen Most of the award winners are keeping their acceptance speeches short and sweet tonight. Does that mean an awards show will actually end on schedule? Time will tell ... Chloe Melas The vibe at the Beverly Hilton this year? Insiders tell NBC News that Nikki Glaser is acing her debut as host of the Golden Globes. The comedian is the first woman to host the awards show solo. In interviews ahead of the big night, Glaser said she didn't plan to go too hard on the celebrities in the audience because she wanted to be asked to host again. But she didn’t hold back too much, making jokes about Timothée Chalamet’s name and poking fun at Nicole Kidman, Harrison Ford and the cast of \"Joker: Folie a Deux.\" Daniel Arkin \"Conclave\" writer Peter Straughan just won his first Golden Globe for his adaptation of the eponymous novel by Robert Harris, who specializes in mystery and thriller yarns. \"I am just one pure ball of gratitude squeezed into a borrowed tux,\" Straughan said. Peter Straughan, “Conclave” Rebecca Cohen It's the first win of the night for the popular FX show, which dominated at the Emmys. But Jeremy Allen White wasn't there to accept the award. Angela Yang Presenter Jennifer Coolidge drew no shortage of laughs from the audience before she presented the next award. “Tonight, I have the incredible honor of recognizing the men who had the daunting task of carrying the weight of an entire series on their shoulders,” Coolidge said. “And believe me, it’s not easy. I mean, I do know how hard it is for you guys to have to pretend to be nice to everybody.” Jeremy Allen White, “The Bear” Daniel Arkin The crowd of Hollywood A-listers and power players cheers as the stars of \"Shōgun,\" \"Hacks\" and \"Baby Reindeer\" head to the stage to accept their shiny statuettes. No, this isn't the Emmy Awards — though you'd be forgiven for getting the two ceremonies confused. The strong first-hour showings for \"Shōgun,\" \"Hacks\" and \"Reindeer\" are taking me back to the most recent Emmys in September, when all three shows were dominant. Saba Hamedy Accepting his award, “Shōgun” star Tadanobu Asano expressed his gratitude and glee. “So many of you don’t know me,\" he said. \"I’m an actor from Japan, and my name is Tadanobu Asano.\" He joked that the statuette was a \"very big present\" for him to take back home. \"Thank you everybody. I’m very happy. Thank you,\" he said before he exited the stage. Daniel Arkin \"Baby Reindeer\" co-star Jessica Gunning, who plays a woman who stalks a comedian, apparently drew inspiration from Kathy Bates' Oscar-winning performance as a novelist's deranged fan in \"Misery.\" In a nice coincidence, Bates (joined by Anthony Ramos) handed Gunning her Golden Globe. Rebecca Cohen Gunning is bringing home a statuette for her role as Martha in \"Baby Reindeer,\" a viral Netflix miniseries about a stalking relationship. \"I cannot believe any of this is happening to me,\" she said. \"So I just want to say thank you to everyone who let me come on this journey.\" She said the show has changed her life. Her role was somewhat marred in controversy when the woman claiming to be the real-life Martha sued Netflix and show creator Richard Gadd. Tadanobu Asano, “Shōgun” Daniel Arkin It's an awards show staple: Each slate of nominees is announced by a pair of performers. But for whatever reason, the banter on the teleprompter isn't really landing. Demi Moore and Margaret Qualley's stilted repartee was meant to be a nod to their adversarial dynamic in the body-horror satire \"The Substance\" — but from my seat on the living room couch, the chitchat just felt awkward. Hopefully the producers smooth things out as the show goes on. Jessica Gunning, “Baby Reindeer” Rebecca Cohen Combining two of this season's biggest film hits, Glaser, in a hot pink sequin gown, tried her own take of \"Popular\" from \"Wicked\" — \"Pope-ular,\" a nod to \"Conclave.\" After a few bars, the self-aware Glaser turned away from the audience and mimed taking a call. \"Wait this sucks? Wait this whole show sucks?\" she joked before cutting off. Sophia PargasSophia Pargas is a news associate for NBC News. Timothée Chalamet and rumored girlfriend Kylie Jenner laughed as host Nikki Glaser poked fun at Chalamet's upcoming film and called him \"a complete unknown\" during the monologue. “I actually read your singing voice was so accurate that even Bob Dylan himself admitted it was absolutely horrible. You nailed it,” Glaser said. Her monologue also featured a camera toss to Adam Sandler, in which he jokingly repeated \"Chalamet\" in his iconic voice. Angela Yang Hiroyuki Sanada seemed nearly speechless accepting the award for best actor in a drama series. After thanking his “Shōgun” cast and crew members, he closed his speech with a message for fellow creatives: “I’d like to say for the young actors and creators in the world: Please, be yourself,” he said. “Believe in yourself and never give up.” This is Sanada’s first Golden Globes nomination and win. Daniel Arkin Culkin, accepting the best supporting actor for his role in the dramedy \"A Real Pain,\" joked that he was feeling lightheaded after having done a tequila shot with his wife and TV personality Mario Lopez. He then struck a more earnest note, tipping his hat to \"A Real Pain\" director and co-star Jesse Eisenberg. \"I'm here because Jesse Eisenberg wrote an incredible script. He's a fantastic director and scene partner, so anybody who has an opportunity to work with him in any category, just leap at it.\" Culkin and Eisenberg play mismatched cousins who journey to Eastern Europe to visit the birthplace of their grandmother. Hiroyuki Sanada, “Shōgun” Kieran Culkin, “A Real Pain” Rebecca Cohen Smart, who won a Globe for her role as Deborah Vance, a Las Vegas stand-up legend in \"Hacks,\" appropriately kicked off her acceptance speech with a joke. \"I never thought I'd be so happy to be called a hack,\" she said, before taking a moment to shout out co-star Hannah Einbinder and the rest of the cast and crew. Smart is fresh off a win in the same category at the most recent Emmys. Mike Calia The Globes broadcast is featuring lists of factoids under presenters' and winners' names tonight. Kicking things off, \"Moana\" co-stars Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson (Guinness world record holder for most selfies in three minutes) and Auliʻi Cravalho (owns a cat despite being allergic to ... cats). Jean Smart, “Hacks” Daniel Arkin Zoe Saldaña, accepting the best supporting actress prize for her role as a morally conflicted lawyer in the film \"Emilia Pérez,\" paid tribute to her two co-stars: Selena Gomez and Karla Sofía Gascón, both nominated for their performances tonight. \"I'm sharing this with you,\" Saldaña said, breaking down in sobs. \"Emilia Pérez\" is a genre-bending musical about a Mexican cartel boss who undergoes gender reassignment surgery and attempts to forge a new path as a humanitarian, with help from an attorney played by Saldaña. Rebecca Cohen The host made fun of the fact that a woman never wins in the best director category, despite numerous nominees tonight. \"It could be a woman, you know, I think 100% of the time it’s a man, but it could be a woman,\" Glaser said. \"It won’t be. It never is, kind of like best director. All right.\" Zoe Saldaña, “Emilia Pérez” Rebecca Cohen Discussing Selena Gomez's success, Glaser pointed to her new fiancé, Benny Blanco, who she said is \"here because of the genie who granted him that wish. Man, lucky guy.\" Rebecca Cohen The host quickly pivoted to the viral \"Wicked\" press tour moment, asking Ariana Grande to \"hold my finger\" before saying she's \"holding space for television\" tonight. Rebecca Cohen Glaser wasted no time before taking shots at the audience, teasing that the Golden Globes is \"Ozempic's biggest night!\" Sophia PargasSophia Pargas is a news associate for NBC News. The 2025 Golden Globes have officially kicked off on CBS and Paramount+. Austin Mullen Jamie Foxx likened his daughter, Corinne, to Al Pacino's character Michael Corleone from 'The Godfather\" for helping to take care of him during his health scare in 2023. The health scare was a topic he broached in his Golden Globe-nominated standup special \"What Had Happened Was.\" \"I say 'Corinne, you turned into Michael Corleone,'\" Foxx said in an interview with Variety on the red carpet. \"Michael had seen that his dad was in trouble. He stepped up, and she did. There was a lot of pressure on her, but she delivered. She made sure I was good.\" Saba Hamedy It's a small Hollywood world. Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor, who starred in the 2001 jukebox musical \"Moulin Rouge,\" reunited on the carpet tonight when Kidman interrupted McGregor's interview with ET to say hello. Kidman, nominated for \"Babygirl,\" raved about working with McGregor's daughter on the film. Rebecca Cohen Elle Fanning, nominated for her role in \"A Complete Unknown,\" is nominated alongside her sister, Dakota, at tonight's show. \"Tonight is so special,\" Elle Fanning told E! News. \"Our grandmother is here tonight as Dakota’s date. ... We got ready together all in the same room.\" Elle Fanning is cheering on her sister most of all tonight: \"I hope she wins,\" she said. Sophia PargasSophia Pargas is a news associate for NBC News. Saba Hamedy Selena Gomez, who is nominated in both the television and film categories tonight, reunited with her \"Only Murders in the Building\" co-stars on the carpet. The three of them laughed together as they chatted about the show's being recognized by the Globes. Gomez is also nominated for her role as Jessi Del Monte in “Emilia Pérez” — her first Spanish-speaking role. \"How about this gal?\" Martin said on the carpet, gushing about her performance. Outside of her many professional successes, Gomez also recently announced her engagement to music producer Benny Blanco. Angela Yang Ariana Grande is channeling Oz in a Givenchy 1966 archive gown. “It’s yellow because follow the yellow brick road,” the singer and “Wicked” star told Variety on the Globes carpet. “And it’s one of Glinda’s favorite colors.” Grande is nominated for her first Golden Globe Award for her role in the record-breaking film adaptation of the “Wicked” Broadway musical. “I’m, like, such a fan of all of these artists, so to be here is just the most unexpected, delightful surprise of my life, and it’s so exciting,” Grande said. “And everyone’s been so kind.” Sophia PargasSophia Pargas is a news associate for NBC News. Karla Sofia Gascón, nominated for her role in \"Emilia Pérez,\" reflected on making history as the first trans actor to be nominated in the Golden Globes film category. \"It's meaning a lot of things for a lot of people in this world,\" Gascón told E! News on the carpet. \"They need representation, they need respect, they need love and peace in this world.\" \"I'm here tonight for all of you,\" she added. Gascón also became the first transgender actress following her joint best actress win at the 2024 Cannes Film Festival. Angela Yang Actor Viola Davis, one of tonight’s presenters, gave a heartfelt statement on social media this weekend ahead of the Golden Globes, where she will be honored with the Cecil B. DeMille Award recognizing “outstanding contributions to the world of entertainment.” “There are no words to describe this honor,” Davis wrote on Instagram. “Only little Viola can.....and she is squealing! She is basking in worthiness. And she feels deeply, deeply SEEN.” Davis, one of a handful artists who’ve achieved the coveted “EGOT” status (by winning an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar and a Tony), won a Golden Globe in 2017 and has been nominated for the award seven times throughout her career. “Being an actor has always been the cosmic carrot to a much higher, deeper journey. I’ve ALWAYS been in search of connection to people but also to.....myself. I found it through artistry,” she wrote in the post. “It’s a sacred, magical tool that has elevated my life in every way. It’s why I fight for elevated content for people of color. I fight for characters who otherwise wouldn’t be seen. I fight.” Angela Yang Glen Powell’s dates to the red carpet are “very” proud of him. Powell told ET on the red carpet that his parents, Cyndy Powell and Glen Powell Sr., are his dates tonight. His sister Leslie Powell will make an appearance at the after parties, he said. But sadly, his internet favorite pup, Brisket, didn’t join the festivities. Clips circulating on social media also appeared to show Powell, who is nominated for his performance in “Hit Man,” greeting his lookalike contest winner — who was also at the awards show — with a big hug. Austin Mullen Eddie Redmayne, nominated for his role in Peacock's “The Day of the Jackal,” said he's celebrating is birthday early tonight. \"Whatever happens, we will have a wonderful party,\" Redmayne, who turns 43 tomorrow, told Variety on the red carpet. \"And whatever happens, we will be hungover tomorrow.\" Rebecca Cohen After his role in “Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story,” Cooper Koch said on E! News, one major celeb slid into his DMs: Kim Kardashian. \"I love her,\" Koch said. Kardashian has been a vocal advocate for the Menendez Brothers, writing an essay in support of their release for NBC News. Rebecca Cohen Tonight's Golden Globes host has kept busy, practicing her monologue a whopping 93 times. When she does it for real, it will be her 94th run-through. She told E! News on the red carpet that she feels so comfortable with the act now that she \"can't wait to tell this to a room full of people.\" Because of that, she is preparing to even go off book if the moment calls for it. She added that she's feeling \"so ready\" and that \"the nerves aren't there yet.\" Her confidence is warranted, but she also said \"it's blowing my mind that Angelina Jolie has to listen to me talk for nine minutes.\" As for Glen Powell, Glaser needs him sitting in the back row with sunglasses on \"so he can't throw me. ... I need to stay dry.\" Alicia Victoria Lozano Saba Hamedy Twenty-eight years after Lyle and Erik Menendez were sentenced to life in prison for killing their parents, the brothers may be getting a second chance at freedom. On Friday, the family-led Justice for Erik and Lyle Coalition said over 20 relatives of the Menendez brothers are expected to sit down with Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman in a continued push for a reduced sentence for the siblings. Some legal experts say the Hollywood projects, as well as a public shift in attitude toward victims of sexual abuse, helped bring renewed attention to the Menendez brothers, paving the way for their potential release from prison. Among the buzzy Hollywood titles? “Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story,” a Ryan Murphy-led true crime series on Netflix that’s nominated for three Globes. Read the full story here. Ronda Racha Penrice “Nickel Boys,” director RaMell Ross’ first narrative feature, is set at the fictional Nickel Academy, based on the notoriously cruel Arthur G. Dozier School for Boys near Tallahassee, Florida, which operated for 111 years before the Justice Department shut it down in 2011. Ross and producer Joslyn Barnes adapted the film from Colson Whitehead’s Pulitzer Prize-winning 2019 novel, “The Nickel Boys.” The film is nominated in the drama category. Read the full story here. Rebecca Cohen One thing was obvious the minute “Nobody Wants This” dropped on Netflix: Adam Brody’s rizz — while playing a rabbi, no less — is off the charts. But for loyal millennial TV stans, that’s been obvious since at least 2003, when Brody first graced our screens (and our hearts) as teen heartthrob Seth Cohen — a nerd by all means whose biting sarcasm and frizzy hair somehow helps him score the hottest girl in his Southern California high school. For all of us who have been pining for Seth Cohen for, yes, decades, Brody’s Noah in “Nobody Wants This” was a welcome character in our streaming rotations, allowing us to revel in the memories of Chrismukkah (which conveniently made a resurgence in 2024) and all of the other glory brought by “The OC.” Clearly, those nominating for the Golden Globes agreed, offering Brody his first nomination at the coveted show. A long time coming for us longtime Brody stans. Rabbi Noah is reminiscent of the beloved Seth Cohen: charming, bright, quick and, of course, Jewish. This time, he plays opposite Kristen Bell, a non-Jew who stumbles into a situationship with her friend’s friend — a rabbi. The 10-episode miniseries catalogues Noah and Joanne’s attempt at love and how they make it work when everything seems to be stacked against them. In an appearance on the E! red carpet, Brody was asked how it feels to, again, be everyone's favorite internet boyfriend, 20 years after his stint on \"The OC.\" He joked that he hopes to be back again in 20 more years — as everyone's favorite \"grandpa boyfriend.\" Angela Yang Seating arrangements are ready for the year’s first star-studded party. The Golden Globes hinted at tonight’s seating charts in a video revealing “Wicked” stars Ariana Grande, Cynthia Erivo and Michelle Yeoh at one table and the likes of Kate Winslet, Angelina Jolie and Denzel Washington at another. Celebrity couples to be seated together include nominee Selena Gomez and her fiancé, Benny Blanco, as well as nominee Timothée Chalamet with Kylie Jenner. Rebecca Cohen Richard Gadd, who wrote and starred in the viral miniseries \"Baby Reindeer,\" said he can't believe he's at the Golden Globes. The nine months since the show came out, he added, have been crazy. Gadd said he's already working on his next project, a new BBC/HBO show. He revealed only scant details: It's about \"dysfunctional men and how they move through life.\" When asked who he would love to work with, Gadd shocked listeners with his answer: Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson. He said he has been a wrestling fan his whole life. One day, he added, he'd also love to write and direct a film. \"But I'm happy where I am at the moment this evening,\" Gadd said. Sophia PargasSophia Pargas is a news associate for NBC News. Broadway lovers are represented in a big way at this year’s Globes, with four nominations for the immensely “Popular” adaptation of “Wicked” — including best motion picture and the cinematic and box office achievement award. Starring duo Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande are also nominated for best lead and supporting actress, respectively. Though the movie adaptation faced much pressure to live up to the original 2003 Broadway musical, it has been met with praise from both loyal theater fans and “Wicked” newbies. The movie is credited with bringing film, music and theater fanatics together at the box office and beyond. “Wicked” has now surpassed “Mamma Mia” as the highest-grossing Broadway musical adaptation, with over $634 million in ticket sales. Fans continue to attend showings clad in their best pink and green, sing along at special showings and anticipate the release of “Wicked: For Good” in November. The musical would be the 11th Broadway-to-film adaptation to take home a Golden Globe — joining most recently a best motion picture win for “Les Misérables” in 2013. Angela Yang The winners of the Glen Powell and Timothée Chalamet lookalike contests, two events that drew attention last year amid a craze over competitions to honor various celebrities' doppelgängers, are on the red carpet together. A video posted by The Hollywood Reporter shows both attendees holding a sign that reads: “I won a lookalike contest and now I’m at the Golden Globes.” Saba Hamedy After three years, actress and activist Laverne Cox announced on Friday that she’s leaving her red carpet hosting gig with E! “With an incredible amount of gratitude I’ve decided not to return as host of #LiveFromE’s red carpet coverage,” Cox wrote in an Instagram post before the Golden Globes. The “Orange Is the New Black” alum became a red carpet favorite in 2022, when she took over E!’s red carpet coverage after longtime host Giuliana Rancic left. (NBCUniversal is the parent company of E! News and NBC News.) “These moments are a reminder to me of what an incredible privilege it has been to talk to some of the world’s greatest artists about their work, navigating the pressures of success, etc.,” Cox wrote in her social media post. “I’m so excited to keep growing, evolving and exploring great opportunities as an actress, artist, host and speaker. I hope you’ll all continue to go with me on my evolving journey.” Pilar Melendez Netflix’s “Nobody Wants This,” nominated in several TV categories, got mixed responses from viewers. The show stars Adam Brody as Noah, aka “hot rabbi,” who falls hard for Joanna, a “shiksa” podcaster played by Kristen Bell. Some have praised it for its positive portrayal of Judaism; others have criticized how it depicts Jewish women. NBC News spoke with four rabbis about the buzzy series to get their thoughts on the discourse. Read the full story here. Daniel Arkin “The Apprentice” charts Donald Trump’s rise to the top of Manhattan real estate under the tutelage of notorious fixer Roy Cohn. Trump’s campaign says the film is “garbage.” Both Jeremy Strong, who plays Cohn, and Sebastian Stan, who plays Trump, are nominated tonight. NBC News spoke with director Ali Abbasi when the film was released in October. Read the full story here. Kimmy Yam Lee Jung-jae, who reprised his role as game winner Seong Gi-hun in season two of “Squid Game,” said that this time around, his character is darker and more serious after a traumatic first season. The show, which debuted its second season on Dec. 26, is nominated in the TV category. Read the full story here. Sophia PargasSophia Pargas is a news associate for NBC News. Get ready for some nostalgia at tonight's Golden Globes. Zendaya, Ariana Grande, Selena Gomez and Miley Cyrus — all known for their beginnings as Disney and Nickelodeon child stars — snagged nominations in various categories tonight. The four former child actors will likely have a mini reunion at the event, which has prompted many social media users to express their excitement about seeing the faces they grew up watching on TV now thriving in Hollywood alongside one another. Through pop stardom, fashion exploration and various acting roles, the four nominees have expressed continued support for one another and gratitude for their unique shared experience growing up in the spotlight. “It’s incredibly special,” Grande told Entertainment Tonight when she was asked about being nominated alongside Cyrus and Gomez. “I love those girls and to grow up with the world watching, really, and then to have your work recognized in this way, it makes me so happy.” Angela Yang People at tonight’s show can buy champagne from a vending machine. The Golden Globes teased on social media this weekend that the venue is equipped with Moët & Chandon vending machines. Daniel Arkin Iranian director Mohammad Rasoulof learned he had been sentenced to eight years in prison while he was completing his latest film, the tense political thriller “The Seed of the Sacred Fig.” NBC News recently spoke with Rasoulof, a fierce critic of Iran’s theocratic regime who escaped the country on foot after he made the Golden Globe-nominated film. Read the full story here. Saba Hamedy Ready to critique red carpet looks from the comfort of your couch? Us too. Most red carpet coverage will kick off about two hours before the show, though many stars usually don’t trickle in that early. We’ll have our eyes on “Entertainment Tonight” and Variety’s digital red carpet preshow, which will air live on Variety.com, CBS and Paramount+ beginning at 6:30 p.m. ET/3:30 p.m. PT. We’ll also be watching E!’s coverage, which will be hosted by “Access Hollywood’s” Zuri Hall and comedian Heather McMahan. “Live From E!: Golden Globes” starts at 6 p.m. ET/3 p.m. PT. Daniel Arkin The group behind the Globes introduced a new category last year: cinematic and box office achievement. It’s a field that allows voters to recognize movies that have “garnered extensive global audience support” (read: ticket sales); last year, the prize went to “Barbie.” Eight hit movies are in the running this year: “Alien: Romulus,” “Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,” “Deadpool & Wolverine,” “Gladiator II,” “Inside Out 2,” “Twisters,” “Wicked” and “The Wild Robot.” “Inside Out 2” and “Deadpool & Wolverine” were the two highest-grossing titles of 2024, each raking in more than $600 million at the domestic box office. But don’t be surprised if the award goes to the third-highest-grossing release: “Wicked.” Saba Hamedy Zendaya served themed red carpet looks while promoting her tennis-centric film “Challengers” last spring. Her style inspired many fans to hop on the \"tenniscore\" trend, giving rise to attire inspired by the sport. (Read more in our full story here.) She is nominated for her role as Tashi Duncan, a tennis player-turned-coach, in the Luca Guadagnino-directed film, which also stars Mike Faist and Josh O’Connor. Will she bring back that “tenniscore” — a tennis-inspired aesthetic — tonight? We’ll see. Angela Yang After it swept the 2024 Emmy Awards with six wins out of 11 nominations, Netflix’s hit series “Baby Reindeer” is entering 2025 with three Golden Globe nominations, including best performance nods for Richard Gadd and Jessica Gunning. Despite its overwhelming popularity among audiences, the show was embroiled in legal controversy after Fiona Harvey — the women who claimed to be the real-life inspiration behind its stalker character, Martha (played by Gunning) — sued Netflix, claiming defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Gadd, the show’s creator, has maintained that its characters were not representations of real people. Ronda Racha Penrice Denzel Washington is nominated for his role in “Gladiator II” as Macrinus, a saboteur and opportunist in the Roman Empire epic. “His grand purpose,” Washington said in a recent interview, “is to take over the world.” Read the full story here. Daniel Arkin The Globes, unlike the Academy Awards, split the best film prize into two categories: drama and musical/comedy. It’s a model that allows voters to recognize a wider array of film projects, with six entrants in each race. The editors of Gold Derby, an awards prediction website, say the drama movies with the best odds are “The Brutalist,” an epic saga of the postwar immigrant experience, and “Conclave,” a thriller about the top-secret battle for the papacy. The other drama nominees are “A Complete Unknown,” “Dune: Part Two,” “Nickel Boys” and “September 5.” In the musical/comedy category, Gold Derby editors say the odds favor “Anora,” a madcap portrait of a Brooklyn sex worker, and “Wicked,” an adaptation of the popular Broadway musical. The other contenders are “Challengers,” “Emilia Pérez,” “A Real Pain” and “The Substance.” “Conclave” and “Wicked” were released by units of NBCUniversal, the parent company of NBC News. Rebecca Cohen Bob Dylan has nothing but praise for Timothée Chalamet, who is nominated for his portrayal of the famed singer-songwriter in the upcoming film “A Complete Unknown” about Dylan’s life. Dylan took to X to share his excitement for the biopic and his faith in Chalamet’s taking on the role. Read the full story here. Daniel Arkin Globes voters also recognize achievement in TV. In the drama series race, Gold Derby gives the best odds to “Shōgun,” a saga set in feudal Japan. (The acclaimed series won the equivalent prize at the most recent Emmys.) The other nominees in the drama series category are “The Day of the Jackal,” “The Diplomat,” “Mr. and Mrs. Smith,” “Slow Horses” and “Squid Game.” In the comedy series field, “Hacks” appears to have momentum after claiming the equivalent trophy at the most recent Emmys. The other contenders in the category are “Abbott Elementary,” “The Bear,” “The Gentlemen,” “Nobody Wants This” and “Only Murders in the Building.” Mike Calia It isn’t so rare for an actor to end up with multiple nominations at the Golden Globes in a single year. After all, the ceremony has 14 acting categories across TV and film. No surprise, either, that the list of past double nominees is an illustrious group. It includes: Meryl Streep, Jamie Foxx and Audrey Hepburn, among many others. This year, there are three double nominees: Selena Gomez (best actress in a TV comedy for “Only Murders in the Building” and supporting actress in a film for “Emilia Perez”), Sebastian Stan (best actor in a film drama for “The Apprentice” and film comedy for “A Different Man”) and Globes stalwart Kate Winslet (best actress in a film drama for “Lee” and best actress in a limited series, anthology series or TV movie for “The Regime.”) This is the third time Winslet has been up for multiple Globes in one year, and it could bode well for her chances to take home another statuette. The last time she was a double nominee, in 2012, she won for her title role in the HBO limited series “Mildred Pierce” but lost in the best actress, comedy/musical film, category. In 2009, she won both categories in which she was nominated: best actress in a drama film for “Revolutionary Road” and best supporting actress in a film for “The Reader.” Angela Yang Demi Moore received her first Golden Globes nod since 1997. This time, she is nominated for best performance by a female actor in a musical or comedy film for the body-horror satire “The Substance.” She posted her reaction to hearing the news of the nomination, throwing her fists up with an ecstatic cheer as she watched “The Substance,” and later her own name, appear on a TV screen as 2025 nominees. She described it as the “best news to wake up to” in her Instagram post, adding that she’s “Truly honored to be nominated and so proud of this film.” Rebecca Cohen It’s a year of many firsts: Twenty-six of tonight’s nominees are on the ballot for the first time. Some of those joining the nominations list for the first time might surprise you, like mega pop star Ariana Grande, who was nominated for her role as Glinda in “Wicked.” Joining Grande with inaugural Globes nominations are Adam Brody, Pamela Anderson, Zoe Saldaña, Mikey Madison, Glen Powell and Jesse Plemons, among others. Host Nikki Glaser also received her first nomination for her comedy special, “Nikki Glaser: Someday You’ll Die.” Angela Yang Hugh Grant got a nod this year for his role as a sadistic kidnapper who terrorizes two young Mormon missionaries in the horror-thriller film “Heretic.” He took to X in December to express his surprise at being nominated for best performance by a male actor in a musical or comedy. “Massive thanks to the Golden Globes for so warmly welcoming a blatant gate crasher,” Grant wrote. “Also to Scott Beck and Bryan Woods for spotting my need to kill, and to A24 for sponsoring it.” This is the seventh nomination for Grant, who won his first and only Golden Globe Award for “Four Weddings and a Funeral” in 1995. Saba Hamedy In a post to her Instagram story, nominee Ariana Grande shared her gratitude for her time working on \"Wicked.\" The singer has gained praise for her role as Galinda/Glinda, who is later known as “Glinda the Good.\" \"all i can think about this afternoon and all morning is how deeply grateful i am to have been able to do this work and to have spent these years with Galinda ...\" she wrote in the post, which she shared with a photo of what appears to be a copy of her \"Wicked\" script.\" She said she's excited to celebrate \"all of the beautiful art that was made this year\" with the rest of the cast, who she called her \"Ozian family,\" and \"our new friends,\" likely referring to the slew of other A-listers who will be there tonight. \"happy Golden Globes day\" she added. TODAY Watch \"The TODAY Show\" break down everything to know ahead of tonight's show. Mike Calia The Globes will carve out time to honor two longtime stars with awards outside the main slate. Viola Davis will receive the Cecil B. DeMille Award, which the Globes have given out since 1952, when the honor’s namesake was the first recipient. Davis, a Globe winner herself for “Fences” in 2017, is also one of a handful of EGOT winners — meaning she’s taken home what are traditionally known as the big four awards: Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony. Past DeMille Award honorees include Walt Disney, Sophia Loren and Davis’ “Fences” co-star and director, Denzel Washington. Ted Danson, meanwhile, will receive the comparatively new Carol Burnett Award, which the Globes started in 2019 to single out greats in television. Danson, a prominent presence on TV comedies and dramas across six decades, is a three-time Globe winner — including twice for his signature role as pitcher-turned-barkeep Sam Malone on long-running 1980s sitcom “Cheers.” Beyond Burnett herself, past winners include Ryan Murphy, Norman Lear and Ellen DeGeneres. The awards were given out Friday, two days before the full Globes ceremony, but Davis and Danson will also be honored during the main broadcast. Austin Mullen Per usual, the Globes has a long list of A-list stars set to present. On that list: Elton John, Viola Davis, Jeff Goldblum, Anya Taylor-Joy, Gal Gadot, Dwayne Johnson, Melissa McCarthy, Nicolas Cage, Salma Hayek Pinault, Colman Domingo, Sharon Stone, Kerry Washington, Colin Farrell, Michael Keaton, Mindy Kaling, Seth Rogen, Kate Hudson, Nate Bargatze, Sarah Paulson and Vin Diesel. Ariana DeBose, Anthony Mackie, Glenn Close, Rob McElhenney, Anthony Ramos, Kaley Cuoco, Awkwafina, Kathy Bates, Miles Teller, Rachel Brosnahan, Auliʻi Cravalho, Morris Chestnut, Zoë Kravitz, Édgar Ramírez, Catherine O’Hara and Brandi Carlile are also all slated to present awards. Daniel Arkin Emmy- and Grammy-nominated stand-up comedian Nikki Glaser will make her debut as Globes emcee. She is the first woman to host the ceremony solo. In recent years, Tina Fey and Amy Poehler hosted together four times, while Sandra Oh split hosting duties with Andy Samberg in 2019. In an interview with the Globes’ official website, Glaser said headlining the show was “scary,” but she was excited about the challenge. Glaser is coming off a high-profile year. “Nikki Glaser: Someday You’ll Die,” her second HBO stand-up special, debuted on the network in May. She also appeared in Netflix’s “The Roast of Tom Brady.” NBC News TV series (drama) TV series (comedy or musical) TV series (limited or TV movie) TV actor (drama) TV actor (comedy) TV actor (limited series or TV movie) TV actress (drama) TV actress (comedy) TV actress (limited series or TV movie) Supporting actor Supporting actress Stand-up comedy performance NBC News Motion picture (drama) Motion picture (comedy or musical) Actor (drama) Actress (drama) Actor (comedy or musical) Actress (comedy or musical) Supporting actor Supporting actress Director Screenplay Score Song Animated feature Non-English language film Cinematic box office achievement Daniel Arkin The Globes will take place at the Beverly Hilton Hotel on Sunday and air live on CBS starting at 8 p.m. ET.

                "title": "Bears beat Packers on walk-off field goal, 24-22",
                "content": "GREEN BAY – The Bears got a 51-yard walk-off field goal from K Cairo Santos to beat the Packers, 24-22, in the regular-season finale at Lambeau Field on Sunday. Chicago had 15 seconds left and got a completion to WR DJ Moore to the Green Bay 33-yard line and spiked the ball to stop the clock with 2 seconds left to set up the kick. With the win, the Bears broke their 10-game losing streak and finished the regular season 5-12. They also broke their 11-game losing streak to the Packers in the all-time series, and Green Bay lost to Chicago for the first time under Matt LaFleur as head coach. The Packers fell to 11-6 and will be the No. 7 seed in the NFC playoffs, traveling to No. 2 seed Philadelphia for a wild-card game, day and time TBA. In the first half, the Packers lost QB Jordan Love to a right elbow injury and WR Christian Watson to a knee injury. QB Malik Willis took over and brought Green Bay back from a 14-3 deficit in the second quarter to within 14-13 at halftime. Chicago got two TDs on a trick play on a punt return that went all the way for the score, and turning a Green Bay fumble into another score. The Packers squandered possessions in Green Bay territory in the second half, and the Bears eventually stretched their advantage to 21-13 before a deep ball from Willis to WR Malik Heath set up RB Emanuel Wilson's 21-yard TD run. But the Packers didn't get the two-point conversion and still trailed by two points. A turnover by Chicago with less than two minutes left set up a 55-yard field goal by Packers K Brandon McManus to give Green Bay its first lead of the game, 22-21, with 54 seconds left. But that was enough time for the Bears to drive for the winning points. For the Packers, Willis was 10-of-13 for 136 yards and a 109.8 passer rating. Before leaving the game, Love was 7-of-12 for 69 yards and a 74.7 rating. Wilson rushed 12 times for 73 yards and a TD, with RB Chris Brooks adding 59 yards on eight carries and RB Josh Jacobs getting 44 yards and a TD on six rushes before resting the remainder of the day. WR Malik Heath had three catches for 53 yards, and WR Dontayvion Wicks had five catches for 49 yards. For the Bears, QB Caleb Williams was 21-of-29 for 148 yards with one TD and a 95.2 rating. RB D'Andre Swift had 20 carries for 65 yards and a TD, and Moore had nine catches for 86 yards and a TD. Here's a recap of all the action: The Packers won the opening coin toss and elected to receive. A holding penalty on the kickoff pushed Green Bay back to its 15. The Packers gained the initial first down with a 6-yard pass to Dontayvion Wicks and a Josh Jacobs 11-yard run. The drive stalled there, though. Daniel Whelan got off a 35-yard punt after a high snap, as Chicago started from its own 30. Green Bay's defense gave up no ground on the Bears' first possession. A high snap led to a Caleb Williams fumble. While Williams corralled it, he was quickly sacked by Rashan Gary for a loss of seven yards. Javon Bullard and Kingsley Enagbare combined for a 4-yard tackle for a loss of Cole Kmet on second down and Chicago eventually punted after a 2-yard check down to Roschon Johnson. Green Bay started its second series from its 40. Again, it gained the initial first down with a 7-yard pass to Tucker Kraft and a 3-yard Emanuel Wilson run. Jordan Love and Christian Watson couldn't connect on a second-and-6 out and Green Bay was forced to punt after a Love incompletion. The Bears ran a misdirection punt return, resulting in Josh Blackwell returning Whelan's punt 94 yards for a touchdown to put Chicago ahead 7-0 with 6 minutes, 34 seconds left in the first quarter. The Packers gained 15 yards off a pass to Wicks to get their third drive moving. On first-and-5 after an encroachment penalty, backup quarterback Malik Willis entered the game and took a read-option run for three yards. Jacobs picked up six yards and Luke Musgrave caught a 19-yard pass to the Chicago 23. Referee Clay Martin initially ruled it incomplete, but Head Coach Matt LaFleur successfully challenged. A short pass to Kraft gained just three yards on third-and-9, leading to a Brandon McManus 37-yard field goal to cut the Bears' lead to 7-3 with 2:24 left in the first quarter. Chicago went three-and-out on its next possession after T.J. Slaton dropped Johnson for a 4-yard loss on first down. Jayden Reed came in motion on an end-around but fumbled, which Jonathan Owens at the Green Bay 21. The second quarter started with Caleb Williams finding D.J. Moore for a 15-yard catch and run. On first-and-goal, D'Andre Swift ran in a 4-yard touchdown to extend Chicago's lead to 14-3 with 14:17 left in the first half. The Packers opened with a 16-yard pass to Dontayvion Wicks, but Christian Watson went down with a knee injury while running his route. He was later carted to the locker room. Love caught Chicago with 12 men on the field but injured his right elbow on the play. Willis entered and connected with Kraft for 20 yards to set up first-and-goal at the Green Bay 9. Jacobs plowed in for the touchdown on the next play to cut the Bears' lead to 14-10 with 11:12 left in the first half. On the play, Jacobs established a new franchise record with his eight consecutive game with at least one rushing TD. Swift gained 25 yards on three caries before the Packers' defense locked in. On third-and-6, Keisean Nixon took down Moore for a 2-yard loss on a receiver screen to force the third Chicago punt. With Willis still at quarterback, Emanuel Wilson gained 13 yards on three straight carries. On third-and-8, Willis stood tall against the blitz and found Reed for 31 yards to the Bears' 36. The Packers cut Bears' lead to 14-13 with a 30-yard McManus field goal with 1:57 remaining. Tyler Scott returned the kickoff 37 yards to the Chicago 45. On third-and-7, Williams hit Rome Odunze for eight yards on a stop route. After a false start penalty, Williams threw the ball away on second and third down and Chicago punted with less than a minute left in the half. Watson was ruled out at the start of the second half. Chicago opened with a 13-yard pass to Keenan Allen on third-and-4 and converted a fourth-and-5 with a 6-yard pass to Johnson. The Bears tried a pass off a double-reverse to Allen, but Xavier McKinney recorded his team-leading eighth INT of the year and returned it 17 yards. Offensive lineman Darnell Wright forced a fumble of McKinney, but Edgerrin Cooper recovered it at the Green Bay 44. Wilson gained 24 yards on four straight carries before Green Bay opted to pass on first-and-10 at the Bears' 32. Kevin Byard arrived unabated to Willis on a blitz for a strip sack, which Chicago recovered at its 46. The Bears gained the initial first down with a 3-yard Williams draw but a holding penalty on the next play pinned them back. Chicago punted on fourth-and-9, with Reed calling for a fair catch at the Packers' 16. Chris Brooks gained 11 yards on back-to-back carries before Malik Heath picked up six yards on a quick pass. Brooks then busted a 23-yard run to the Chicago 44. The run moved the Packers up to 2,468 yards rushing on the season, the second most in franchise history behind only 2003. The Packers went for it on fourth-and-3 at the Chicago 37 to start the fourth quarter, but Jayden Reed was dropped for a loss of two yards by Tremaine Edmunds for the turnover on downs. Keisean Nixon tackled Swift for a loss of three on first down before Cole Kmet caught a 7-yard pass and Moore squeaked by the first down marker for a 7-yard pickup on third-and-6. Williams started to find his groove, connecting with Moore for nine yards on a third-and-5 slant to the Green Bay 36. Two plays later, Moore evaded a slew of Packers tacklers en route to a 32-yard touchdown. The Bears initially tried to go for two with a reverse to Allen again, but Cooper tackled him. Carrington Valentine was flagged for holding and Chicago opted to kick a 28-yard extra point to push its lead to 21-13 with 10:02 remaining. Starting at the Green Bay 17, Reed caught a 17-yard pass from Willis on first down. Wilson gained six yards on a run before Willis was sacked for a loss of six on second down. On third-and-10, Willis hit Kraft for seven yards before he was tackled. Whelan boomed a 59-yard punt for the touchback. The Packers' defense responded with another three-and-out, with Karl Brooks tackled Johnson for a loss of five yards on third-and-10. Tory Taylor's punt traveled 36 yards to the Green Bay 49. Willis missed Wicks on a deep out route on first down before Rasheed Walker was called for holding on Willis' second-down scramble. After a sack, Malik Heath pulled down a huge 41-yard catch on third-and-21. Wilson ran for a touchdown on the next play, but Green Bay still trailed 21-19 with 4:28 remaining after its attempt at the two-point conversation was no good following an incomplete pass. Chicago converted the initial first down with a 6-yard pass to Moore on third-and-3. A Swift carry to the 43 gained a first down and brought the game to the two-minute warning. Chicago was called for holding and then Carrington Valentine forced a fumble of D.J. Moore on a quick pass. Javon Bullard recovered it at the Chicago 43. Heath caught a 6-yard pass, but that's as much as Green Bay would get. McManus still made a 55-yard field goal to pull ahead 22-21 with 54 seconds left. Kingsley Enagbare was flagged for a horse-collar tackle on first down, moving the ball to the Chicago 35. Odunze caught a 15-yard pass to midfield with 34 seconds left. Williams scrambled for four to the Green Bay 46 and then threw the ball away on second down. An illegal shift on Moore when the play clock was stopped pushed Chicago back to its 49. Moore caught an 18-yard pass on third-and-11 and Williams clocked it with two seconds left. Santos made the 51-yard field goal to win it.

                "content": "Filed under: The Bears face the Packers in Green Bay on Sunday. We break down what the game means for the NFL playoff picture. Game updates: A late field goal from the Packers was answered by a last-second Bears field goal. The Packers will head to the two-seed Philadelphia Eagles while the Commanders will face the Rams or Buccaneers. The Green Bay Packers are headed to the 2025 NFL Playoffs, but Week 18 still provides a chance to improve their situation. The Packers host the Chicago Bears with a 1 p.m. kickoff on FOX. Green Bay theoretically could choose to rest some of their starters ahead of the Wild Card round, but they will likely play their normal starters until at least halftime. One other game could impact their decisions coming out of the halftime locker room. The Packers are 11-5 and currently hold the final wild card berth. They are tied with the Washington Commanders, but the Commanders hold the conference record tiebreaker. Washington travels to face the Dallas Cowboys and if both teams win or lose on Sunday, the Green Bay will be locked into the No. 7 seed. However, if the Packers beat the Bears and the Commanders lose to the Cowboys, Green Bay would move up to the No. 6 seed. That could be worthwhile given the potential matchups. As the No. 7 seed, the Packers would face the No. 2 Philadelphia Eagles. As the No. 6 seed, the Packers would face either the Los Angeles Rams or the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The Rams have won five straight coming into Sunday, including a home upset of the Buffalo Bills. There are no tiebreaker implications as they cannot move past the Commanders in the conference record tiebreaker. Check your inbox for a welcome email. Oops. Something went wrong.

Cairo Santos converted the extra point. The Packers responded with a 37-yard field goal made by Brandon McManus. Chicago led 7-3 after the first quarter. Chicago's lead grew when D'Andre Swift rushed for a 4-yard touchdown. Santos converted the extra point. To make matters worse for Green Bay, Love exited the game due to an elbow injury and was replaced by Malik Willis. However, the hosts fired back with a 9-yard touchdown run from Josh Jacobs and McManus converted the extra point. Green Bay then lessened the deficit further when McManus made a 30-yard field goal. At halftime, the Bears had a narrow 14-13 lead over the Packers. Both teams failed to create big chances in the third quarter, which ended scoreless. The Bears eventually resumed the scoring in the fourth quarter when Williams connected with DJ Moore for a 32-yard touchdown. Santos converted the extra point. The Packers then fought hard to get back into the game and were rewarded when Emanuel Wilson rushed for a 21-yard touchdown. They went for a successful 2-point conversion via Jayden Reed. The Packers thought completed the comeback when McManus made a 55-yard field goal. However, in the final play of the game, Santos made a 51-yard field goal to give the Bears a narrow 24-22 win.

                "content": "More on the Meaning of Patriot The word patriot signifies a person who loves their country and is ready to boldly support and defend it. That meaning has endured since the word's arrival in English in the 16th century, but it has not marched through the years unchallenged. Ultimately derived from Greek patrios, meaning \"of one’s father,\" patriot entered English via French patriote—meaning \"fellow countryman\" or \"compatriot\"—during a time of political unrest in western Europe that was characterized by infighting among fellow countrymen—especially among those of the Protestant and Catholic faiths. For much of the 17th century, words like good were attached to patriot to distinguish patriots who shared both a love of country and a common allegiance from those having opposing beliefs and loyalties: to be deemed a \"good patriot\" was to be a lover of country who agreed on political and/or religious matters with whoever was doing the deeming. The Catholiques were knowne good Patriots under our former Kings. — Henry Hammond, A view of some exceptions which have been made by a Romanist to the Lord Viscount Falkland's discourse…, 1646 Patriot was used to mean \"good patriot\" without modification more frequently by the end of the 17th century, but it tended to apply to a supporter of the ruling monarchy. A Patriot, both the King and Country serves; Prerogative, and Privilege preserves. — John Dryden, Fables, Ancient and Modern, 1700 Another effect of the tumultuous times was the development of a derogatory use of patriot to refer to hypocritical patriots: people who claimed devotion to one's country and government but whose actions or beliefs belied such devotion. This ultimately led to the discrediting of the loyalty and steadfastness associated with the word patriot. The years leading up to the American Revolutionary War further propagated the notion of patriot as a name for a seditious rebel against the monarchy. American writers of the 18th century, however, heartily embraced the word to define the colonists who took action against British control. As tensions continued to escalate, a new meaning of patriot came to the forefront, referring to a person who advocates or promotes the independence of their land or people from the country of which they are a colony. Benjamin Franklin provides an early record of this use. It should be no Wonder … if among so many Thousand true Patriots as New England contains there should be found even Twelve Judases. — Benjamin Franklin, letter, 7 July 1773 In the end, the patriots won the war and, centuries after America’s Declaration of Independence, patriot has held its place of honor in the English language as the meritorious name for the brave men and women of the armed forces who defend the rights and freedoms of their country. Stripped of all past disparagement, the word has returned to its original meaning: \"one who loves his or her country.\" Today, active fighting or resistance is not a requirement to being a patriot: a person only needs a strong sense of love for one’s country. Middle French patriote compatriot, from Late Latin patriota, from Greek patriōtēs, from patria lineage, from patr-, patēr father 1577, in the meaning defined above New England vs. Los Angeles: A Battle...

                "title": "Commander - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Commander (commonly abbreviated as Cmdr.) is a common naval officer rank as well as a job title in many armies. Commander is also used as a rank or title in other formal organizations, including several police forces. In several countries, this naval rank is termed as a frigate captain. Commander is also a generic term for an officer commanding any armed forces unit, for example \"platoon commander\", \"brigade commander\" and \"squadron commander\". In the police, terms such as \"borough commander\" and \"incident commander\" are used. Commander is a rank used in navies, but is very rarely used as a rank in armies. In most armies, the term \"commander\" is used as a job title. For example, in the US Army, an officer with the rank of captain (NATO rank code OF-2) may hold the title of \"company commander\", whereas an officer with the rank of lieutenant colonel (NATO rank code OF-4) typically holds the title of \"battalion commander\". The title, originally \"master and commander\", originated in the 18th century to describe naval officers who commanded ships of war too large to be commanded by a lieutenant but too small to warrant the assignment of a post-captain and (before about 1770) a sailing master; the commanding officer served as his own master. In practice, these were usually unrated sloops-of-war of no more than 20 guns. The Royal Navy shortened \"master and commander\" to \"commander\" in 1794; however, the term \"master and commander\" remained (unofficially) in common parlance for several years.[1] The equivalent American rank master commandant remained in use until changed to commander in 1838. A corresponding rank in some navies is frigate captain. In the 20th and 21st centuries, the rank has been assigned the NATO rank code of OF-4. Various functions of commanding officers were also styled commander. In the navy of the Dutch Republic, anyone who commanded a ship or a fleet without having an appropriate rank to do so could be called a Commandeur. This included ad hoc fleet commanders and acting captains (Luitenant-Commandeur). In the fleet of the Admiralty of Zeeland however, commandeur was a formal rank, the equivalent of Schout-bij-nacht (rear-admiral) in the other Dutch admiralties. The Dutch use of the title as a rank lives on in the Royal Netherlands Navy, as the equivalent of commodore. In the Royal Netherlands Air Force, however, this rank is known by the English spelling of commodore which is the Dutch equivalent of the British air commodore. The rank of commander in the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) is identical in description to that of a commander in the British Royal Navy. RAN chaplains who are in divisions 1, 2 or 3 (of five divisions) have the equivalent rank standing of commanders. This means that to officers and NCOs below the rank of commander, lieutenant colonel, or wing commander, the chaplain is a superior. To those officers ranked higher than commander, the chaplain is subordinate. Although this equivalency exists, RAN chaplains who are in divisions 1, 2 or 3 do not actually wear the rank of commander, and they hold no command privilege. The rank of commander (Comandor in Romanian) is used by both the Romanian Air Force and Romanian Naval Forces. It is equivalent to the army rank of Colonel (OF-5). In both cases, the rank is above Căpitan-comandor (lit. 'Captain-commander', OF-4). In the air force, Comandor is below the rank of General de flotilă aeriană (lit. 'Air flotilla general'), while in the navy it is below Contraamiral de flotilă (lit. 'Flotilla counter admiral').[2][3] The rank was also used in the Royal Romanian Air Force and Navy until the proclamation of the Republic.[4] Commander is a naval rank in Scandinavia (Kommandør in Danish and Norwegian, Kommendör in Swedish) equivalent to the Anglo-American naval rank of captain. The Scandinavian rank of commander is immediately above \"commander-captain\" (Norwegian: Kommandørkaptein, Swedish: Kommendörkapten, Danish: Kommandørkaptajn), which is equivalent to the Anglo-American naval rank of commander.[5] In Denmark, the rank of commander exists as kommandørkaptajn (commander captain or commanding captain), which is senior to orlogskaptajn (captain) and kommandør (commander), which is senior to kommandørkaptajn. Kommandørkaptajn is officially translated into English as \"Commander, Senior Grade\", while orlogskaptajn is officially translated as '\"Commander.\"[6] A commander in the Royal Navy is above the rank of lieutenant commander, below the rank of captain, and is equivalent in rank to a lieutenant colonel in the army. A commander may command a frigate, destroyer, submarine, aviation squadron or shore installation, or may serve on a staff. Since the British Royal Air Force's mid-rank officers' ranks are modelled on those of the Royal Navy, the term wing commander is used as a rank, and this is the equivalent of a lieutenant colonel in the army or a commander in the navy. The rank of wing commander is above that of squadron leader and below that of group captain. In the former Royal Naval Air Service, which was merged with the Royal Flying Corps to form the Royal Air Force in 1918, the pilots held appointments as well as their normal ranks in the Royal Navy, and they wore insignia appropriate to the appointment instead of the rank. A flight commander wore a star above a lieutenant's two rank stripes, squadron commander wore two stars above two rank stripes (less than eight years' seniority) or two-and-a-half rank stripes (over eight years seniority), and wing commander wore three rank stripes. The rank stripes had the usual Royal Navy curl, and they were surmounted by an eagle. In the United States Navy, United States Coast Guard, United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Officer Corps, commander (abbreviated \"CDR\") is a senior-grade officer rank, with the pay grade of O-5. Commander ranks above lieutenant commander (O-4) and below captain. (O-6). Commander is equivalent to the rank of lieutenant colonel in the United States Army, United States Air Force, United States Marine Corps, and United States Space Force. Notably, commander is the first rank at which the holder wears an embellished cap, whereas officers of the other military services are entitled to embellishment of similar headgear at O-4 rank. Promotion to commander in the U.S. Navy is governed by United States Department of Defense policies derived from the Defense Officer Personnel Management Act (DOPMA) of 1980 or its companion Reserve Officer Personnel Management Act (ROPMA). DOPMA/ROPMA guidelines suggest that 70% of lieutenant commanders should be promoted to commander after serving a minimum of three years at their present rank and after attaining 15 to 17 years of cumulative commissioned service, although this percentage may vary and be appreciably less for certain officer designators (i.e., primary \"specialties\") depending on defense budgets, force structure, and the needs of the service. For instance, as in various small colonial settlements (such as various Caribbean islands) commanding the garrison was the crux of the top job, the military title Commandeur could be used instead of a civilian gubernatorial style, not unlike the Portuguese captain-major. In the British Army, the term \"commander\" is officially applied to the non-commissioned officer in charge of a section (section commander), vehicle (vehicle commander) or gun (gun commander), to the subaltern or captain commanding a platoon (platoon commander), or to the brigadier commanding a brigade (brigade commander). Other officers commanding units are usually referred to as the officer commanding (OC), commanding officer (CO), general officer commanding (GOC), or general officer commanding-in-chief (GOC-C), depending on rank and position, although the term \"commander\" may be applied to them informally. In the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry commander is a rank equivalent to major. Commandeur as title of colonial office was the case on the island of Tobago in the Dutch colony of Nieuw Walcheren. The usage is similar/identical to the British Army, with the term \"commander\" having been applied to the colonel who was Commander, 2 Land Force Group, Linton Camp, and now to Commander, 1 Brigade. In the Spanish Army, the Spanish Air Force and the marine infantry, the term commander is the literal translation of comandante, the Spanish equivalent of a Commonwealth major. The Guardia Civil shares the army ranks, and the officer commanding a house-garrison (usually an NCO or a lieutenant, depending on the size) is addressed as the comandante de puesto (post commander). In the United States Army, the term \"commander\" is officially applied to the commanding officer of army units; hence, there are company commanders, battalion commanders, brigade commanders, and so forth. At the highest levels of U.S. military command structure, \"commander\" also refers to what used to be called commander-in-chief, or CINC, until October 24, 2002, although the term CINC is still used in casual speech. In the United States Air Force, the term \"commander\" (abbreviated \"CC\" in office symbols, i.e. \"OG/CC\" for \"operations group commander\") is applied officially to the commanding officer of an Air Force unit; hence, there are flight commanders, squadron commanders, group commanders, wing commanders, numbered air force commanders, and commanders of major commands. In rank, a flight commander is typically a lieutenant or captain, a squadron commander is typically a major or lieutenant colonel, a group commander is typically a colonel, a wing commander is typically a senior colonel or a brigadier general, a numbered air force commander is a major general or lieutenant general, and the commander of a major command is a general. In the United States Space Force, the term \"commander\" is applied officially to the commanding officer of a Space Force unit; hence, there are squadron commanders, delta commanders, and commanders of field commands. In rank, a squadron commander is a lieutenant colonel, a delta commander is a colonel, and the commander of a field command is a major general or lieutenant general. In NASA spacecraft missions since the beginning of Project Gemini, one crew member on each spacecraft is designated as mission commander. The commander is the captain of the ship, and makes all real-time critical decisions on behalf of the crew and in coordination with the Mission Control Center (MCC). The title of aircraft commander is used in civil aviation to refer to the pilot in command (commonly referred to as \"captain\", which is technically an airline rank and not related to the commander's role on board the aircraft). Within the British police, Commander is a chief officer rank in the two police forces responsible for law enforcement within London, the Metropolitan Police and City of London Police. In both forces, the rank is senior to chief superintendent; in the Metropolitan Police it is junior to deputy assistant commissioner and in the City of London Police it is junior to assistant commissioner. In forces outside London, the rank equates to assistant chief constable which bears the same insignia. The Metropolitan Police introduced the rank in 1946, after the rank of deputy assistant commissioner was split in two, with senior DACs keeping that rank and title and junior DACs being regraded as commanders. The Metropolitan Police also used the rank of deputy commander, ranking just below that of commander, between 1946 and 1968. Officers in charge of the twelve geographical Basic Command Units are referred to as \"BCU commander\". However, the officers do not hold the rank of commander but instead hold the rank of chief superintendent. Prior to organisational change merging boroughs in to BCUs, officers in charge of policing each of the London's boroughs were given the title \"borough commander\". A previous exception to this was the borough commander of Westminster, who held the rank of commander due to the size, complexity, and high-profile nature of the borough. The Metropolitan Police Service announced that by summer 2018 the rank would be phased out, along with that of chief inspector.[36] However, in August 2017 it was announced that the new Commissioner Cressida Dick had cancelled the plan to phase them out.[37] The rank badge worn by a commander or an assistant chief constable consists of crossed tipstaves within a wreath. Within the Metropolitan Police Service, the tips of the tipstaves are blue and not red, unlike other forces. Until the abolition of the rank of deputy commander in 1968, however, a commander wore the same badge of rank as a deputy assistant commissioner. In Australia, commander is a rank used by the Victorian,[38] Tasmanian, Western Australian,[39] South Australian, and Australian Federal police forces. The insignia consists of a crown over three bath stars in a triangular formation, equivalent to a brigadier in the army. In all four forces, it is junior to the rank of assistant commissioner, and senior to the rank of chief superintendent, with the exception of Western Australia and Victoria where it is senior to the rank of superintendent. In New South Wales the position of commander is instated to officers (usually superintendents) in charge of a command or unit. Some large police departments and sheriff's offices in the US have a commander rank. Most commonly, this is the next rank above captain. Examples of this include the Chicago Police Department, Los Angeles Police Department, San Francisco Police Department, Portland Police Bureau and Rochester Police Department. In others, such as the Phoenix Police Department and Saint Paul Police Department, a commander rank is the next rank above lieutenant, and is equivalent to captain. In the Northport, Florida's police department, however, commanders are below captains. A commander in the LAPD is equivalent to an inspector in other large US departments (such as the NYPD); the LAPD rank was originally called inspector as well, but was changed in 1974 to commander. The Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia also uses the rank of commander, which is a grade above inspector and two grades above captain. In the Montgomery County, MD police department a commander is a captain assigned to command a police district. The insignia worn is commonly every insignia between major and major general, depending on the police or sheriff's department. Albuquerque Police Department commanders are captain equivalents, however, with the brass version of the captain's insignia. In some other police or sheriff's departments where the captains have brass insignias instead of silver, such as Florida's Lee County Sheriff's Department, commanders are above captains, and below majors, with the insignia being brass captain's bars with wreathes around. Northport's police commanders have the insignia of second lieutenants. Commander is also used as a title in certain circumstances, such as the commander of a squad of detectives, who would usually be of the rank of lieutenant, and in some police or sheriff's departments where commanders are ranks, officers or deputies of separate ranks are also referred to as commander by title. The Montreal police force, Service de police de la Ville de Montréal, uses the rank of commander (Commandant).[40] In the Incident Command System the incident commander is in charge of the response to an emergency. The title may pass from person to person as the incident develops. The title of commander is used in chivalric orders such as the Sovereign Military Order of Malta for a member senior to a knight. The title of knight commander is often used to denote an even higher rank. These conventions are also used by most of the continental orders of chivalry. The United Kingdom uses different classifications. In most of the British orders of knighthood, the grade of knight (or dame) commander is the lowest grade of knighthood, but is above the grade of companion (which does not carry a knighthood). In the Royal Victorian Order and the Order of the British Empire, the grade of commander is senior to the grade of lieutenant or officer, but junior to that of knight or dame commander. In the British Venerable Order of Saint John, a commander ranks below a knight.",

                "content": "Jauan Jennings and Sean Murphy-Bunting get in a brawl in the end zone, leading to both of them getting ejected. GLENDALE, Ariz. -- — The Cardinals' final passing touchdown of the season was a perfectly placed ball from Kyler Murray to rookie Marvin Harrison Jr. — a 12-yard strike in the fourth quarter that sealed their 47-24 win over the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday. Arizona hopes that's just a preview of what's coming next season. “He's only going to get better,” Murray said of Harrison, the No. 4 overall pick. “We're only going to get better.” Murray threw for 242 yards and four touchdowns, two to Greg Dortch, and the Cardinals wrapped up an 8-9 season. Arizona won four more games than last year, but still missed the playoffs for a third straight season. San Francisco (6-11) lost seven of its final eight, missing the postseason one year after losing the Super Bowl to the Kansas City Chiefs. The Cardinals led throughout the second half and took a 33-24 lead with 14:16 left in the fourth quarter when Michael Carter sneaked into the end zone just inside the left pylon for a 2-yard touchdown. Arizona put the game away with 5:47 left on Murray's pass to Harrison that made it 40-24. Tony Jones Jr. ran for a 46-yard touchdown to conclude the scoring and give Arizona its highest point total since 2015. “We didn't accomplish what we wanted to accomplish this year and that stings,” Cardinals coach Jonathan Gannon said. “But I'm proud of them. I really am. They fought, they battled. ... To put that kind of effort against the 49ers, a well-coached, tough, physical team, I thought that was cool to see.” Harrison finished with eight TD catches, tying the franchise's rookie record held by Larry Fitzgerald and Anquan Boldin. Joshua Dobbs — starting for the 49ers in the place of injured Brock Purdy — threw for 326 yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions. He hit wide-open fullback Kyle Juszczyk for a 36-yard TD with 4:49 left in the third quarter to cut the Cardinals' advantage to 26-24. But Dobbs had a pair of costly mistakes in the fourth quarter, losing a fumble on one drive and throwing an interception on the next. The quarterback played for the Cardinals during the first half of last season, starting eight games while Murray was rehabbing a knee injury. “Through three quarters we battled,” Dobbs said. “But the turnovers kind of killed us. That was the difference in the game.” Chad Ryland made a 49-yard field goal as the first half ended to give the Cardinals a 20-17 lead. The drive took only 16 seconds. San Francisco had just tied the game at 17-all when Ricky Pearsall made a tough catch in traffic for a 6-yard touchdown. Tight end Trey McBride — who earned his first Pro Bowl nod earlier this week — caught a 2-yard touchdown pass from Murray with 1:51 left in the second quarter. McBride caught 111 passes this season, shattering his own franchise record for a tight end. Arizona took a 10-3 lead early in the second quarter when Murray hit Dortch for a 23-yard touchdown. Dortch caught a short pass and then weaved his way through the 49ers' defense, scoring his second touchdown of the year. His second touchdown of the game came in the third quarter on a 2-yard catch that made it 26-17. “They wore us down and got it going,” 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan said. “We couldn't get them off the field.” Jake Moody made a 51-yard field goal on the game's opening drive to give the 49ers a 3-0 advantage. That would be their only lead. Ejections Cardinals cornerback Sean Murphy-Bunting and 49ers receiver Jauan Jennings were ejected in the second quarter after getting into a scuffle. The ejections came one play after Jennings and Cardinals cornerback Starling Thomas V were called for a personal fouls after their tussle on the other side of the field. Jennings finished with 975 yards receiving in the most productive season of his four-year career. Murphy-Bunting had an interception earlier in the first half. Injuries 49ers: Purdy (elbow) and WR Deebo Samuel (ribs/wrist) were inactive. ... RB Issac Guerendo (knee/ankle) was carted off the field early in the first quarter. ... S Malik Mustapha (knee) was hurt in the second quarter. ... S Talanoa Hufanga (concussion) was ruled out early in the third quarter. Cardinals: WR Michael Wilson (hamstring) and LB Victor Dimukeje (eye) were inactive. ... CB Max Melton (wrist) left in the first half. ------ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",

                "title": "San Francisco 49ers 24, Arizona Cardinals 47: Grades",
                "content": "Glendale, AZ -- The San Francisco 49ers just lost 47-24 to the Arizona Cardinals. Here are the 49ers' grades for this performance. Joshua Dobbs turned the ball over three times and was one of the main reasons the 49ers lost. He's not a good backup quarterback and the 49ers should not re-sign him this offseason. And yet, he led the 49ers offense to 24 points on the road while playing with backups and against the Cardinals starters. As opposed to Brock Purdy, who led the 49ers' starters to just 23 points at home against Arizona in Week 5. If Brock Purdy truly is worth $60 million per season, the offense would perform much better with him on the field than with Dobbs on the field, but it doesn't. The 49ers need to keep their options open at quarterback. Extending Purdy to a big-money deal would be a huge mistake. This season exposed Purdy for what he is -- a liability in the second half of close games. Isaac Guerendo left the game early with an MCL injury -- he may not be durable enough to succeed as an NFL running back. To be determined. After he left the game, Patrick Taylor Jr. replaced him and gained 109 rushing yards on 17 carries. No matter who the running back was this season, the 49ers were able to rush the ball effectively, which makes this 6-11 season all the more baffling. Kyle Juszczyk caught a 36-yard touchdown pass when he was wide open in what hopefully was his final game with the 49ers. Jauan Jennings got ejected after committing personal fouls on back-to-back plays. After the game, instead of taking responsibility for his penalties, he said that the referees made a mistake. He seemed pleased with himself despite his team losing its seventh game in the past eight weeks. The 49ers are so undisciplined. Meanwhile, Ricky Pearsall had another good game -- 6 catches for 69 yards and a touchdown. If only the 49ers had gotten him involved earlier this season, they might have won more than six measly games. George Kittle played half the game and finished with 27 receiving yards. After the game, he said he's going to talk to Kyle Shanahan tomorrow about Shanahan's performance this season. When I asked Kittle how he thought Shanahan did this season, Kittle said he'd save his thoughts for Shanahan. Sounds like Kittle has something serious to say. The 49ers averaged 4.9 yards per carry and Joshua Dobbs got sacked only twice. Not a bad performance considering all the backups who are starting for this unit. Went through the motions and sacked Kyler Murray zero times. Went through the motions and gave up 5.6 yards per carry against an offense that was missing its starting running back. Went through the motions and gave up 4 touchdown passes and a 128.5 passer rating to one of the most inconsistent quarterbacks in the NFL. Played like they usually do, which means they got burned by a fake punt and Jake Moody missed his weekly field goal. How many games would the 49ers have won this season if their kicker were anyone else? The defense simply stopped playing for Nick Sorensen. Three weeks ago when the season was on the line, the defense gave up just 12 points in a loss to the Rams. Then the 49ers were eliminated from playoff contention. Since then, the defense has given up 116 points in the final three games. Shameful. The 49ers have no choice but to fire Sorensen now. Clearly, promoting Sorensen to defensive coordinator was one of Kyle Shanahan's biggest football sins of the year. But Shanahan's football sins were numerous. In today's game, his team committed a whopping 13 penalties while the Cardinals committed just one. That's because the Cardinals are well-coached and the 49ers are not. Shanahan can blame this humiliating season on injuries, but he should blame himself. His utter refusal to honestly assess himself and hold himself responsible for the Super Bowl collapse is precisely how the 49ers scapegoated Steve Wilks, replaced him with Sorensen and ended up 6-11. Now Shanahan has to figure out what went wrong, and his analysis must begin with a deep dive into himself. Will his ego allow him to look in the mirror, or will he continue to blame others for his failures? We'll find out. Grant Cohn has covered the San Francisco 49ers daily since 2011.

                "title": "49ers Fall to the Cardinals in Week 18; Five Takeaways from #SFvsAZ",
                "content": "Team Reporter The San Francisco 49ers concluded their 2024 season on the road against the Arizona Cardinals. Among the long list of of injured players not suiting up for the season finale was QB1 Brock Purdy, who suffered a right elbow contusion and nerve inflammation in the team's Week 17 \"Monday Night Football\" matchup. With Purdy out of the lineup, Joshua Dobbs led the 49ers offense in the last game of the year. Dobbs has history with Arizona - he spent the first portion of the 2023 season as the Cardinals starting quarterback while Kyler Murray recovered from an ACL injury. He finished the day connecting on 29-of-43 passes for 326 yards, two touchdown passes and two interceptions. Here are five takeaways from the 49ers-Cardinals game: Jennings Closes Out Career-Best Season Veteran wide receiver Jauan Jennings made an early exit from Sunday's matchup after picking up a disqualification penalty in the second quarter. He, along with Arizona cornerback Sean Murphy-Bunting, were ejected following a scuffle in the end zone on a rushing attempt by Dobbs. Because of the disqualification, Jennings finished the year with 975 receiving yards on the year, just shy of what would have been his first 1,000-yard season of his five-year career. He caught seven of ten passes thrown his way for 52 yards on the day. Rookie Renardo Green Continues to Impress The 49ers second round pick tied his season-high of two pass breakups for the third time this year. His first PBU came on Arizona's second offensive series on a third-down attempt to Cardinals receiver Zay Jones near the left sideline. Green played the hands of the receivers to knock away a well placed pass from Arizona quarterback Kyler Murray. His second breakup came in the second quarter and prevented a deep shot from Murray to wideout Xavier Weaver a few yards shy of the goal line. He also added three total tackles. AZ Homecoming for Rookie Wideouts Arizona natives Ricky Pearsall and Jacob Cowing enjoyed a homecoming game in Week 18 and were welcomed into State Farm Stadium by a large contingency of friends and family. Cowing shared he had roughly 15 family members in the stands while the broadcast revealed that Pearsall had over 100 loved ones in attendance. The AZ boys made important completions in their home state - Pearsall hauled in six passes for 69 yards and a touchdown while Cowing had two catches for 30 yards. The 49ers first-rounder opened up the game in a big way, connecting with Dobbs on his second pass attempt for a 30-yard gain. His second catch of the day came just before the half on San Francisco's third scoring drive of the day. Pearsall connected with Dobbs in the end zone to tie the game at 17 with less than a minute before halftime. Cowing's 14-yard catch came on that same drive and helped set up Pearsall's score from six yards out. Juice Does It All The 49ers nine-time Pro Bow fullback laid out for a 36-yard touchdown completion in the third quarter. Dobbs fired down the left side of the field for wide open Kyle Juszczyk to punch in touchdown No. 3 of Sunday's contest. The touchdown marked the 24th of Juszczyk's career and brought the 49ers within two points with 4:49 left in the third quarter. Injuries of the Game Rookie running back Isaac Guerendo was injured early in the first quarter on his second carry of the game. Guerendo suffered knee and ankle injuries after getting rolled up on during a run up the middle. The fourth-rounder had to be carted off the field and was ruled out shortly after. Head coach Kyle Shanahan said postgame Guerendo likely has an MCL sprain, but he will undergo more testing on Monday. With Guerendo out, running back Patrick Taylor Jr. was the \"next man up\" for the red and gold on Sunday, and he racked up 17 carries for 109 yards on the ground and punched in the 49ers first touchdown of the game. It marked Taylor Jr.'s first 100-plus rushing yard game of his career. In the second quarter, safety Malik Mustapha was listed as questionable to return with a knee injury. Safety Talanoa Hufanga was ruled out in the third quarter with a concussion. At the start of the fourth quarter, wide receiver Chris Conley was also listed as questionable to return with an elbow injury. He re-entered the game in the fourth quarter. The San Francisco 49ers fell 40-34 in Week 17 to the Detroit Lions on \"Monday Night Football.\" The San Francisco 49ers dropped their Week 16 matchup 29-17 to the Miami Dolphins.

                "content": "EPL Advertisement Premier League leaders Liverpool had to settle for a point, after Amad’s late goal earned struggling Manchester United an excellent 2-2 draw at Anfield. Lisandro Martinez (52) sprung the visitors ahead before Cody Gakpo (59) and Mohamed Salah (70 pen) turned the game on its head. But Amad (80) prodded home an equaliser, while Harry Maguire smashed an incredible chance over the bar in the final seconds. The defensive performance of Trent Alexander-Arnold, a January transfer target for Real Madrid, attracted criticism but his side remains six points clear at the summit — while United are 13th. GO FURTHER Liverpool 2 Manchester United 2 – Something for everyone in incredible rollercoaster game at Anfield Arne Slot has insisted speculation over Trent Alexander-Arnold’s Liverpool future did not impact his performance against Manchester United. The right-back endured a difficult afternoon in today’s 2-2 draw at Anfield. That came after Real Madrid ramped up their interest in Alexander-Arnold, who is out of contract at the end of the season and now able to sign a pre-contract agreement with foreign clubs. Last week, Liverpool rebuffed an approach from the Spanish giants to sign him in January. Slot said: 💬 “I don’t believe in those things. Nine out of 10 people will say it (the transfer speculation) affected him but I’m one of the 10 that tells you it didn’t affect him. “What affected him is he had to play against Bruno Fernandes and Diogo Dalot — two starters for Portugal who are great players. “We have a fantastic player here in Diogo Jota and he’s mostly not playing for Portugal, so that tells you how much quality United have. “If these players set themselves to a game, that is what United do once in a while, it is very difficult to play against them. “It is more difficult for Trent to play against Bruno Fernandes and Diogo Dalot than it is the rumours in the week. Probably everyone is going to tell you it had to do with the rumours but my opinion is different.” GO FURTHER Trent Alexander-Arnold not affected by Real Madrid speculation, says Liverpool coach Arne Slot Advertisement Getty Images Ruben Amorim and his Manchester United squad have the luxury of a full week to prepare for their next match, which is a lively trip to Arsenal in the FA Cup third round on Sunday. That match begins at 3pm GMT, 10am ET. Following that encounter United host the Premier League’s bottom side, Southampton, on Thursday week before hosting Brighton three days later. Getty Images It is Carabao Cup action up next for Liverpool on Wednesday, as they travel to Tottenham Hotspur for the first leg of their semi-final. That kicks off at 8pm GMT, 3pm ET. After that, they face nearby fourth-tier strugglers Accrington Stanley in the FA Cup third round three days later, before their return to Premier League duties on Tuesday week — and it is a tasty one, at high-flying Nottingham Forest. Getty Images Let’s continue the Discuss tab reaction, now from a Manchester United perspective — and it features the sort of positivity I can’t remember seeing from the fanbase in a long time: 💬 Brian M: “Ugarte my MOTM. After a disrupted start, he is fast becoming a rock that you can build a midfield around. No surprise we are better today with him back shielding the back 3.” 💬 Ashdon M: “Bruno’s played with so much more composure today, I hope he can keep it up as we’re going to need his best to get us firing again. There have been some real positives about our performance.” 💬 F A: “Can you all at least give the players some credit, regardless of result? We are so quick to slate them.” Let’s get reaction from our Discuss tab, starting with Liverpool supporters — although I’m pretty sure that first one isn’t Daniel Sturridge, the former Anfield striker, as he’s still arguing stuff on Sky Sports: 💬 Daniel S: “F*** me, good thing Maguire is s***. Trent lost us the points.” 💬 Max F: “Honestly, one of our worst performances this season. Macca (Mac Allister) the only one playing up to his level. We’re kind of lucky to get out with a draw.” 💬 Pritham M: “A wake-up call for us. Will help us refocus again on the job at hand. We can finally agree letting Trent go is in the best interests of the club. No one is bigger than the club, we need humble and honest players representing us.” Getty Images After his goal from the penalty spot today, Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah has 18 goals and 13 assists from his 19 Premier League games so far this season. That is the most goal involvements (31) by a player in the first half of a Premier League campaign, beating Luis Suarez’s total of 30 (23 goals, seven assists) back in 2013-14 for... Liverpool. Advertisement Speaking to Sky Sports post-match, Liverpool head coach Arne Slot has also defended Trent Alexander-Arnold’s performance against Manchester United. His defending proved a weakness against Diogo Dalot — but perhaps the bigger issue is the context, with Real Madrid having tried their luck in signing the England defender this month. A reminder, the former Liverpool academy player is out of contract in the summer. Slot said: 💬 “Trent has played mostly very good games for the club. Today was not his best game but that had to do with them as well. “Sometimes Ryan (Gravenberch) was not close enough to him, so it was a two-on-one situation. “I would put it more on the quality of (Diogo) Dalot and Bruno Fernandes.” The Athletic Good question. Take a look right here. Liverpool still sitting pretty at the top, and if they win their game in hand the margin could be nine points. Pole position for the Premier League title. As for Manchester United, they now sit 13th. The Athletic A draw felt like a fair result but Liverpool boss Arne Slot is confident he will feel differently to that come tomorrow morning. Here’s what he said to Sky Sports: 💬 “Over the course of the game we created much more chances. But being 1-0 down, then 2-1 up and conceding such a big chance just before the end, also feels maybe a point is something to take. “This was a chance for them, against us, to show themselves more than other games. Now they compete with the best players in the league and you can see how they also have very good players. “Mostly (United were in) a low block, and sometimes they pressed a bit higher than normally I’ve seen them. But they didn’t take the risk of build-up. We weren’t surprised with anything they did. “Bruno Fernandes is a very, very good player and he played a very good game today as well. So they did cause some problems.” Getty Images Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim has been in compelling form after the game — and at times, cutting an almost upset figure. Here is what he said to BBC Sport: 💬 “That should be a big issue for our players, that even one person thinks you have the ability but not the character. We have to fight that and change that. “It is really clear. When we are focused, when we fight for every ball, when we suffer and we are tired when the game is finished, we are a good team. “If we don’t do that all the time then we are going to lose games. That is clear to everybody. “We controlled very well the tempo. Every time Liverpool had a chance, we controlled and had the ball for a moment. That makes a difference. It was not like we are not suffering all the time. It was a good game.” Getty Images There have been a few post-match questions put to Liverpool figures about whether they took things a little lightly against Manchester United — an angle that seems mostly based on the fact everyone expected a hefty defeat for the visitors. The reaction to that question has mostly been to dismiss that idea as just pre-match talk, and it being a long way from Liverpool’s attitude to the game. You all either saw the game or will catch up on it if you didn’t. I’m sure you’re capable of making up your own mind. And in truth, it might be more a case of addressing the point to individuals — as well as the collective. Advertisement Getty Images Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk spoke to BBC Sport after the match, and he was pretty philosophical about what had just played out at Anfield: 💬 “It could have been a lot worse if we are absolutely honest. They had a big chance in the end. “I’m definitely disappointed with dropping points at home but it is what is. We have to move on and we will. “At 2-1 up, we lost the ball too easily at times and then were more open than we should have been. We’re not perfect, we're still learning and we have to learn from this as well.” Getty Images Frustration for Arne Slot's side that they are held at Anfield. They looked to have finally wrestled control after goals from Cody Gakpo and Mohamed Salah, following Lisandro Martinez's opener. But Amad salvaged a point for the visitors and that was probably about right. Liverpool were far from their best. Getty Images It was a huge chance for Harry Maguire to win it at the end. John O’Shea-type legend beckoned. But couldn’t get over the bouncing ball. Joshua Zirkzee was right to pick him out after a smart run. Manuel Ugarte’s pass to start that was magnificent. A thrilling game, a major boost for Ruben Amorim. So many good displays and a collective United unit. Really good day for Manchester United. They played with passion, aggression and overcame a setback within a game, and visibly found some belief as it went on. That’s enough for many fans to get behind. Getty Images Alexis Mac Allister has been speaking to Sky Sports after the final whistle, and there was clear disappointment from him on what Liverpool got from today. Here he is: 💬 “The result is not good enough. The performance wasn’t as good as we wanted, but it was fair. We conceded too many chances. We had our opportunities, but that’s football. “The effort was there, the mentality was there because we came back, but when you are winning after 70 minutes, you have to defend better and we didn’t do it. “Games where we are losing and after that, we react… That’s not what we want. These are the things we have to think about and improve.” Advertisement Manchester United remain winless in their last 10 away games against Liverpool in all competitions (five draws, five losses), their longest ever winless run at Anfield. However, United scored as many goals today as in their previous 10 away games at Anfield combined. Swings and roundabouts! Getty Images Some record. Only six players in history have more Premier League goals than these two. They're joint-seventh in the all-time list. The Athletic Manchester United had 54 per cent of their attacking touches in the left third of the pitch. That is a pretty stark statistic, illustrated beautifully above by our graphic from Mark Carey, demonstrating how much the visitors targeted Liverpool right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold and right-sided centre-back Ibrahima Konate.",

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. FOXBOROUGH, Mass. (AP) The New England Patriots concluded a bitter season on a high note. It wasn't enough to save their coach's job. Joe Milton III passed for a touchdown and ran for another in his professional debut, and the Patriots cost themselves the No. 1 overall pick in the NFL draft with a 23-16 win over the AFC East champion Buffalo Bills on Sunday. Shortly thereafter, owner Robert Kraft fired coach Jerod Mayo after one season. “After the game I informed Jerod Mayo that he will not be returning as the head coach of the New England Patriots in 2025. For me, personally, it was one of the hardest decisions I have ever made,” Kraft said in a statement. “Unfortunately, the trajectory of our team’s performances throughout the season did not ascend as I had hoped.” The Patriots (4-13) snapped a six-game skid when a loss would have guaranteed them the top draft pick. Instead, they fell to No. 4 behind Tennessee, Cleveland and the New York Giants. Mayo held his postgame news conference before his firing was announced. He said draft position was not a focal point in the locker room heading into Sunday. “I’ve said this over the last couple of weeks, as a player, as a coach, we always want to go out there and win,” Mayo said. Milton finished 22 of 29 for 241 yards in relief of rookie Drake Maye, who played only one series. Kayshon Boutte had seven catches for 117 yards and a TD, and Joey Slye kicked three field goals. New England had four healthy scratches and rested other key players, including running back Rhamondre Stevenson. Tight end Hunter Henry was inactive with a foot issue. Describing what he called “an emotional” postgame locker room, Mayo said questions about his future would be addressed in due time. He may have already known that his time had ended. “These guys have been turning the page, ignoring the noise, and just coming to work every day, and I’m very appreciative of that,” Mayo said. “Told them after the first win of the season, coaches are nothing without the players, and I just told them that again. ... Also told them, today it’s all about the game.” Mitchell Trubisky was 15 of 21 for 101 yards for the Bills (13-4), who had already wrapped up the No. 2 seed in the AFC playoffs and rested most of their starters. Quarterback and MVP candidate Josh Allen played one snap, handing off to James Cook to extend his streak of consecutive starts to 115 games, including the playoffs. Trubisky played until late in the third quarter, when he was replaced by Mike White. Cook rushed for his 16th TD of the season to tie O.J. Simpson's Bills franchise record. The Patriots extended their lead to 23-16 with 1:55 left in the fourth quarter on a 50-yard field goal by Slye. The Bills then turned it over on downs when White’s pass fell incomplete. Bills coach Sean McDermott quickly turned his focus to next week. “Everything is earned and there’s nothing given in the playoffs,” he said. “And you’re going against the best every week, so we start with one week and really one day at a time and get back in here and find out when we play and take it one day at a time.” Patriots: S Marte Mapu left in the first quarter with a neck injury and was ruled out in the second half. WR Kayshon Boutte left in the fourth quarter with a head injury. Trubisky’s 2-yard touchdown pass to Ray Davis in the first quarter was the Bills' 30th passing TD, making them the first team in NFL history with 30 or more TDs through the air and on the ground in a season. Milton’s teammates have lauded the rookie’s athletic ability, though he hadn’t gotten to showcase it beyond the preseason and in closed sessions as a member of the Patriots’ practice squad. That changed Sunday. Taking over for Maye to begin New England’s second series, Milton had passes of 12 and 11 yards to get the Patriots near the goal line. He then capped the 13-play, 55-yard drive with a 1-yard run and celebrated his first career NFL TD with a backflip. He added a 48-yard TD pass to Kayshon Boutte in the second quarter that put New England in front 14-7. Bills veteran linebacker Von Miller earned a $1.5 million bonus with his sixth sack of the season, taking down Maye on the third play of the game. Bills punter Sam Martin also cashed in a $100,000 bonus in the third quarter for his 25th punt inside an opponent’s 20-yard line. Cornerback Ja’Marcus Ingram kept Martin’s 29-yard punt from rolling into the end zone and it was downed on the 6. The Bills passed up a 53-yard field goal attempt for the punt.

                "content": "The Bills–Patriots rivalry is a National Football League (NFL) rivalry between the Buffalo Bills and New England Patriots. Both teams are members of the East division of the American Football Conference (AFC) and play two games against each other annually. The series debuted in 1960 when both were charter members of the American Football League (AFL). The two clubs have combined for seventeen AFL or AFC championships, the most of any two teams in the AFC East.[a] In addition, either the Patriots or Bills have won the AFC East division in 28 out of 35 seasons since 1988.[b] The rivalry has traditionally been a very competitive one (41–38–1 at the close of the 20th century, in favor of New England) with the Patriots holding slight edges in the 1960s and 1980s, and the Bills with similar edges in the 1970s and 1990s. The series then became notable for its extreme lopsidedness during the New England career of quarterback Tom Brady, whose Patriots compiled a record of 32–3[2][3][4] (3–2 in the five games he missed) against the Bills in his two decades with the franchise (the 2000s and 2010s). Until January 2021 (when Josh Allen passed him) Brady had won more games at Highmark Stadium than any quarterback for Buffalo since 2001,[5][6] and Brady beat the Bills more times in his New England career than any other team.[7] Buffalo is 8–2 against New England in the 2020s. The Bills dominated the Patriots, 47–17, in a wild card matchup of the 2021–22 NFL playoffs that was the first \"perfect offensive game\" (i.e., scoring touchdowns on every drive with no punts, kicks, or turnovers) by any team in NFL history.[8][9] This was the first playoff game in the series since the two franchises joined the NFL in 1970; in their AFL days, Gino Cappelletti kicked four field goals en route to a 26–8 Boston Patriots victory to break their tie of identical regular season records in 1963. The Patriots lead the overall series, 79–51–1. The two teams have met twice in the playoffs, winning one each.[1] On September 16, 1973, O. J. Simpson of the Bills broke the all-time professional football single-game rushing record in this rivalry game against the Patriots.[10] Simpson rushed for 250 yards, breaking the record set by Willie Ellison of the Rams in 1971.[10] In the same game, Simpson became the all-time leading rusher for the Bills franchise, and was described after the game as having \"more yardage than Secretariat\" by Patriots linebacker Edgar Chandler.[10] Chuck Fairbanks, coaching his first game for the Patriots, described Simpson looking \"like Grant going through Richmond.\"[10] Fullback Larry Watkins also rushed for over 100 yards for the Bills, as the team racked up 360 rushing yards for the game.[11] The Bills defeated the Patriots by a score of 31–13.[10] The Bills dominated the Patriots in this rivalry's first playoff game in over 58 years, their first as NFL teams, and their first after the Boston Patriots changed their location name to New England, by a score of 47–17 in the wild card round of the 2021–22 NFL playoffs. This went into record books as the first \"Perfect Offensive Game\" by any NFL team as the Bills, led by Josh Allen, scored touchdowns on every drive of the entire game without any punts, kicks, or turnovers.[12] Allen threw more touchdowns than incomplete passes as the Bills gained 480 yards on just 51 snaps.[13][14] USA Today remarked the game \"served as another reminder that the Bills own the AFC East in these post-Tom Brady years\", while Patriots linebacker Matthew Judon observed that \"it wasn’t one drive, one play or one single player. It was everything. It was the whole game.\"[14] Bills defensive tackle Harrison Phillips opined the game's statistics sounded \"like some Pop Warner stuff.\"[13] It was Patriots' second-worst loss of the 21st century, the three worst of which were all suffered in the Bills–Patriots rivalry.[15] The Bills and Patriots played for the first time in a preseason game during the first season of the American Football League on July 30, 1960. The game was played at War Memorial Stadium in Buffalo, and the Patriots won the game 28–7.[16] The teams met for their first regular season game during Week 3 of the inaugural season of the American Football League in 1960. The game was played at Nickerson Field at Boston University on Friday, September 23, 1960. The Bills scored a touchdown in each of the first two quarters and shut the Patriots out 13–0.[17] The two teams met for their first playoff match in the AFL divisional game in December 1963. The Patriots won 26–8. In this game, Jack Kemp played quarterback for the Bills and Gino Cappelletti made four field goals and two extra points to help lift the Patriots to victory.[18] Throughout the remainder of the decade, the teams would complete a 12–9 record in favor of the Patriots. The Bills won the AFL championship game in 1964 and 1965 and won the division in 1966. The Patriots lost to the San Diego Chargers in their only AFL championship appearance in 1963. Both teams were placed into the AFC East after the AFL–NFL merger. The Bills sustained a winning streak of 9 games from 1971 to 1975.[19] The two teams played a pair of highly competitive games in the 1974 season. The Bills withstood a late Patriots rally at Rich Stadium to win, 30–28. Two weeks later, the Bills edged the Patriots, 29–28, when a last-second field goal attempt by the Patriots was blocked. Two years after his NFL record rushing game in this rivalry against the Pats, Simpson again had one of the most dramatic games of his career on November 23, 1975, against the Patriots. Simpson scored four touchdowns (including two passes from Joe Ferguson) as the Bills won, 45–31. Patriots rookie Steve Grogan threw for 365 yards and two touchdowns but was intercepted three times. 1976 was Simpson's final year in Buffalo; on October 24 Simpson rushed for 110 yards and two touchdowns in a 26–22 Patriots win. Two weeks later, on November 7, Simpson was held to just eight rushing yards before being ejected following a scuffle at midfield; Patriots rookie Mike Haynes ran back a second quarter punt 89 yards for a touchdown, the first such touchdown in Patriots history. The Patriots won the game, 20–10, completing their first season sweep of the Bills since 1968.[20] The Bills would go on to win the decade, 12–8. The 1980s was a better decade for the Patriots, as they won the decade series 13–6. The Patriots also completed their own 11-game winning streak over the Bills from January 1983 to September 1988. The Bills began to rebuild their team in the late 1980s with the additions of Jim Kelly at quarterback, Thurman Thomas as running back, Andre Reed as a receiver, Bruce Smith on defense, and Marv Levy as coach. The Bills bested the Patriots to win the AFC East division four years in a row from 1988 to 1992. During the final stretch of the 1980s, the Bills took three out of four meetings with the Patriots.[19] The Bills would regain their edge in this decade, winning it 12–8. In the 1990 season, the Bills reached the Super Bowl for the first time, in Super Bowl XXV. The Bills continued to dominate the Patriots in the early 1990s, winning eight of the first nine games, including five straight. New England, however, made the rivalry more competitive with the addition of Drew Bledsoe as quarterback and the hiring of Parcells as head coach. The Bills also saw many of their Super Bowl players leave during this time period. By the end of the 1990s, the Bills led the decade with 12 wins to the Patriots' 8 wins.[19] Throughout the decade, the two teams combined to win the AFC East six times, with the Patriots reaching the Super Bowl in 1996 and the Bills reaching the Super Bowl in 1990, 1991, 1992, and 1993. The decade saw several memorable games between the two. On September 11, 1994, Buffalo led 28–14 at the half and 35–21 at the start of the fourth quarter after Mike Lodish grabbed a Patriots fumble at the New England goalline. The Patriots scored two touchdowns to tie the game, but Buffalo won 38–35 after Steve Christie booted a 32-yard field goal as time expired. Late that season the Bills hosted the Patriots. Buffalo was 7–7 while the Patriots were 8–6. The Patriots erased a 17–3 gap by scoring 38 unanswered points. Frank Reich, replacing Jim Kelly, was intercepted twice and the Bills fumbled three times; Ricky Reynolds ran back a Buffalo fumble for a touchdown. The 41–17 Patriots win eliminated Buffalo from the playoffs. 1996 was Jim Kelly's last season; his Bills won 17–10 on September 8 on a 63-yard touchdown throw to Quinn Early and then on a last-second goal line stand. On October 27, the Bills had an 18–15 lead at the two-minute warning; Curtis Martin ran in a ten-yard score, then Willie McGinest intercepted Kelly and ran in a 46-yard touchdown, but Kelly then completed a 48-yard touchdown off two Patriots defenders to Andre Reed; the onside kick failed and the Patriots won 28–25. The 1998 season saw the return of Doug Flutie, who'd been Patriots quarterback in 1988–89; he replaced Rob Johnson as Bills quarterback after Buffalo started 1–3. Flutie led the Bills to win four of his first five starts, including a 13–10 victory over the Patriots at Rich Stadium on November 15, but on November 29 in Flutie's return to Foxboro Stadium the Patriots, despite a broken index finger for Drew Bledsoe, rallied to a controversial last-second touchdown to Ben Coates and a 25–21 Patriots win that was aided by a pass interference penalty against the Bills as time expired. The 2000s was the most lopsided decade for the rivalry to date.[21][22][23] On November 5, 2000, Flutie and the Bills defeated the Patriots and new head coach Bill Belichick at Foxboro Stadium 16–13 in overtime. But after this the Patriots won 18 of the next 19 against the Bills. This decade also saw several notable personnel changes. Following New England's 2001 championship year, Drew Bledsoe was traded by New England to Buffalo in 2002. Lawyer Milloy was then cut after the 2003 preseason and was immediately signed by Buffalo.[24] Doug Flutie, released by the Bills after 2000, joined the Patriots by way of the San Diego Chargers in 2005. The Patriots assembled a five-game winning streak over the Bills in the beginning of the decade, which was snapped when Buffalo defeated the Patriots 31–0 in 2003. However, the Patriots then defeated the Bills by the same score later in the season. That win began a 15-game winning streak for the Patriots against the Bills stretching through 2010. The Bills did come close to winning on two occasions, but lost both times due to fourth quarter gaffes, surrendering a safety in 2006 to lose 19–17,[25] and fumbling a kickoff return to set up New England's game-winning touchdown in 2009.[26] On December 28, 2008, the 10–5 Patriots needed a win and help from other teams to win the AFC East, while the 7–8 Bills were wrapping up the ninth straight season without a playoff berth. Played with severe wind gusts that required stadium officials to use ropes to keep the goalposts from swaying, the game was a 13–0 Patriots win as Matt Cassel, subbing for injured Tom Brady, threw only eight passes. However, the Patriots fell short of the division title. The game on September 26, 2010, was noteworthy on several levels. The Patriots won 38–30, marking the 400th win in the history of the Patriots franchise (regular-season and playoffs). It was first start of the season for Buffalo's former backup quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick. Randy Moss caught two touchdowns; they turned out to be his last with the Patriots. On September 25, 2011, the Bills came back from a 21–0 deficit to defeat the Patriots 34–31 and snap the Patriots' 15-game winning streak.[27] Despite this win, the Patriots won the final meeting of the season, on January 1, 2012, erasing a 21–0 Bills lead to win 49–21[28] On September 30, 2012, the Patriots erased a 21–7 Bills lead in the third quarter by outscoring them, 45–7 on six straight touchdowns, winning 52–28.[29] On November 11, 2012, the Bills stayed toe-to-toe with the Patriots; down, 37–31, the Bills were driving until Devin McCourty intercepted a Fitzpatrick pass in the endzone.[30] Following the death of long time Bills owner Ralph Wilson, the Bills were sold to Buffalo Sabres owners Terry Pegula and his wife Kim.[31] In his first game as Bills owner the Bills team hosted the Patriots on October 12, 2014, a 37–22 Patriots win. Tom Brady threw for 361 yards - his 60th 300-yard game - and four touchdowns, including a 43-yard strike to Brian Tyms.[32] In Week 17, the Bills won their first matchup at Gillette Stadium since the facility's construction. It was Buffalo's first regulation win in New England in over 20 years. Having clinched home field advantage throughout the playoffs, the Patriots only played Brady during the first half of the game before replacing him with Jimmy Garoppolo in the second half. Neither quarterback found the endzone in the 17–9 Buffalo win.[33] After the 2014 season, Buffalo hired former New York Jets head coach Rex Ryan.[34] When asked if the Jets would be his focus during the 2015 season, Ryan admitted that the Patriots would still be his number one target.[35] 2016 saw the Patriots hosting the Bills in week 4. The Patriots faced a shortage at quarterback, as Tom Brady was suspended in the aftermath of the Deflategate scandal and primary backup Jimmy Garoppolo was sidelined with an injury. As a result, third-string quarterback Jacoby Brissett made the start for the Patriots.[36] Unable to overcome a strong defensive showing from the Bills and an efficient performance by quarterback Tyrod Taylor, Brissett and the Patriots lost 16–0. It was the first shutout loss at home for New England since 1993.[37] During the rematch later that season, in which the Patriots won 41–25 with Brady's return, a spectator notoriously tossed a sex toy onto the field in the middle of a play,[38] starting a trend that would carry on in subsequent seasons.[39][40] During a game with playoff implications on December 3, 2017, Patriots tight end and Buffalo native Rob Gronkowski hit Bills cornerback Tre'Davious White with a flying elbow after White intercepted Tom Brady in garbage-time. Though the game was already decided at that point with the Patriots going on to win 23–3, the play added tension between the teams.[41] During the rematch just three weeks later, Buffalo raced to a 16–13 lead in the third quarter, but ultimately lost 37–16 as Brady led three consecutive touchdown drives. Another controversial moment occurred when Bills receiver Kelvin Benjamin had a touchdown reception overturned during the second quarter.[42] In a game reminiscent of the first Bills–Patriots game of 2011, the two teams met at New Era Field in September 2019 with undefeated records and the division lead on the line. However, the game was a defensive struggle as opposed to an offensive shootout, with both Tom Brady and Bills quarterback Josh Allen being held to under 153 passing yards apiece. The Patriots emerged victorious after holding an early 13–0 lead, which proved too much for Buffalo to overcome due to numerous turnovers and Allen leaving the game in the fourth quarter due to injury. The final score was 16–10 in favor of New England.[43] The two teams again met later in the season on a Saturday NFL Network Special with the division title on the line; as with the first matchup, the final result was within one touchdown's score, with the Patriots prevailing 24–17 after the Patriots staged a successful goal-line stand in the closing minutes of the game. (Both teams had already clinched a wild-card bid at minimum.)[44] This would be Brady's final win as a Patriot, as the Patriots lost their final regular season game to the Miami Dolphins and were eliminated from the playoffs a week later in a Wild Card round loss to the Tennessee Titans; Brady, who was said by USA Today Sports to make Bills fans \"cringe when they hear his name\" and called the \"creator of Buffalo nightmares\" by Yahoo Sports, signed with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in free agency during the offseason.[45][3][4] His record of 32–3 against the Bills while with the Patriots was called simply \"ridiculous\" by Sports Illustrated.[2] The current decade has begun in favor of the Bills, who hold a 7–2 edge including a historic playoff domination of the Patriots in January 2022.[46] In the first game of this new decade, the two teams met at Bills Stadium on November 1, 2020. This game was yet another tightly contested game between the two opponents, with both teams opting to rely primarily on their run games. After a 28-yard field goal put the Bills up 24–21, the Patriots would drive down the field in the final minutes of the fourth quarter, reaching Buffalo's 19 yard line. However, the Bills recovered the football after the Patriots' new quarterback, Cam Newton, fumbled with 31 seconds left in the game, giving the Bills their first win over New England since 2016, breaking a 7-game winning streak for the Patriots in the series.[47] Buffalo would go on to claim the division title in week 15, ending New England's streak of division titles at 11 years, an NFL-record.[48] The two teams met again at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough later in the season. This game was dominated by the Bills, with Buffalo mostly relying on their passing game. Bills quarterback Josh Allen threw four touchdown passes as the Bills would go on to win 38–9, the worst loss of New England coach Bill Belichick's career up to that point. This marked the first time that the Bills swept the Patriots in the season series since the 1999 season.[49] It stands as the worst home loss for the Patriots in the 21st century and the worst loss anywhere since the Bills defeated them 31–0 at home in 2003.[50] The following year, Buffalo and New England would find each other battling for the division lead throughout the season. During their first meeting on December 6, which was impacted by winds greater than 40 miles per hour, the Patriots only threw the ball 3 times with rookie quarterback Mac Jones, running the ball 46 times, including a 64-yard touchdown run by Damien Harris, as Buffalo opted to pass more. The Bills scored a touchdown on just one of their four redzone possessions, failing to score on their final two attempts and allowing New England to win 14–10.[51] Buffalo won the week 16 rematch in New England 33–21, taking advantage of the normalized weather conditions as Allen passed for over 300 yards and 3 touchdowns. Jones, however, was held to less than 150 yards passing with two interceptions and 14 of 32 passes completed.[52] In 2022 came \"The Perfect Offensive Game\" by the Bills against the Patriots in the wild card round of the playoffs; the 47–17 loss was one of the three worst losses of the Patriots in the 21st century, all three of which were suffered at the hands of the Bills in this rivalry.[15] The 2022 season saw Buffalo easily defeat New England 24–10 in the game in Foxborough. In the second meeting in Buffalo, the Bills were playing their first game following the collapse of Damar Hamlin the previous game against the Bengals; because that game ended up being cancelled and the Kansas City Chiefs finished with a 14–3 record to clinch the AFC's #1 seed, Buffalo at 12–3 was no longer able to finish atop the conference, but did defeat New England 35–23, eliminating the Patriots from playoff contention after a series of close losses late in the season. The game was notable for Buffalo's Nyheim Hines returning two kickoffs for touchdowns, including on the opening kickoff the first play after Hamlin's hospitalization. After another sweep by Buffalo during the 2022 regular season, New England upset the Bills in Foxboro with a 29–25 win, as Mac Jones, who had one of the best performances in his career, led a game-winning touchdown drive.[53] The win was one of only a few for New England, which suffered its worst season since 1992. The Bills beat the Patriots 27–21 in the rematch in Buffalo thanks to several Patriots turnovers, clinching their fifth straight season with double-digit wins.[54] There have been several players who have played for the Bills and Patriots, including: In addition to players, the two teams have shared head coaches. Lou Saban was the first coach in Patriots history but was fired after five games of the 1961 season. He took over the Bills in 1962 and won two American Football League titles (1964–65). After a five-season period in Denver he returned to the Bills for the 1972–76 period.[71] Hank Bullough coached both teams: He was co-head coach (with Ron Erhardt) for the Patriots at the end of 1978 and coached the Bills for the final twelve games of 1985 and the first nine games of 1986.[72] Pepper Johnson joined the Bills coaching staff in 2014 after fourteen seasons on the Patriots staff.[73] Brian Daboll was hired as the Bills' offensive coordinator on January 14, 2018, having previously served as the Patriots' tight-end coach.[74] The Bills–Patriots rivalry was parodied in the 2014 Family Guy episode \"3 Acts of God\" in which the teams' levels of success at the time were reversed. In the first part of the episode, Peter Griffin—along with his family and friends—attends a game between his hometown Patriots and the Bills at Gillette Stadium, which the Patriots lose following a last-minute blunder, leading to their 10th straight loss. This convinces Peter and his friends that God hates the Patriots.[75] The episode also features former Bills players Mario Williams and C. J. Spiller guest starring as themselves.[76] Ryan Fitzpatrick was also slated to guest star, but his part was cut as he was no longer on the Bills' roster at the time of the episode's airing.[75]",

There's now a total of 12 consecutive losses, including their playoff defeat that ended Brian Daboll's first season as head coach, for the Giants here at Lincoln Financial Field. Will this game represent the last one of Daboll’s tenure, or that of general manager Joe Schoen? We won't know that until Daboll and Schoen meet with Giants co-owners John Mara and Steve Tisch, which is expected to happen at some point this week, likely later Monday or possibly even Tuesday - so there may not be an immediate answer on their fates. What we do know: one of the worst seasons in Giants history - in a year where they hoped to celebrate their 100th year anniversary - has mercifully come to an end, poetically in the stadium where they have endured some of their greatest heartache in recent memory. The Giants (3-14) dropped a 20-13 decision to the Eagles, who rested most of their starters, including Saquon Barkley, in preparation for the playoffs. In terms of the Giants' lineup, their mixing and matching resembled that of a preseason game for much of the afternoon. By virtue of the Giants' defeat, they will pick no lower than No. 4 in the 2025 NFL Draft. A Patriots victory over the Bills - they're leading 20-16 in the fourth quarter - would allow the Giants to jump to No. 3 overall. The Giants have not won at Lincoln Financial Field since 2013, and on that day when they last did, Josh Brown kicked five field goals, Peyton Hillis was the leading rusher and Victor Cruz was the leading receiver for Tom Coughlin's team. Chip Kelly's offense with the Eagles was all the NFL could talk about. Michael Vick and Matt Barkley were at quarterback in place of an injured Nick Foles. And Eli Manning passed Phil Simms as the franchise's all-time leader in yards passing in that game. On Sunday, Giants rookie Malik Nabers established a new team record for receptions in a season (109), breaking the mark set by Steve Smith in 2009. He finished with five catches for 64 yards and a touchdown, ending his first campaign with 109 receptions, 1,204 yards and seven touchdowns. Here's how the rest of the game played out: Malik Nabers is in the end zone again, and yet again, he has done it in pretty spectacular fashion. The Giants' rookie caught a 45-yard touchdown from Drew Lock, absorbing a hit at the 10-yard line, keeping his balance along the sideline before diving into the end zone near the front right pylon for the score. He now has 109 catches on the season. One quarter left in what has been a brutal season for the Giants. Tanner McKee tossed his second touchdown of the game and the Eagles extended their lead. At this point, the defensive lineup for the Giants resembles a preseason game. The Eagles have been there from the start. Malik Nabers now has the most catches in a single season in Giants history, surpassing Steve Smith's previous mark of 107 set in 2009. Nabers is at 108 with his fourth reception and the Giants got on the board with a Graham Gano field goal. A lot of nothing going on, other than Malik Nabers surpassing what was Puka Nacua's rookie record for receptions with three catches. The Giants have 84 yards of total offense and Nabers is at 106, so he'll hold the mark for wide receivers. Raiders rookie tight end Brock Bowers broke Nacua's record last week and sits at 108 heading into today's action. The Eagles backups ... and Dallas Goedert, who has four catches for 55 yards in the first quarter, including a grab on fourth and 2 to keep the chains moving. Well, that was quick. After the Giants went for it and failed on a fourth-and-8 at midfield, the Eagles marched right down the field and found the end zone with Tanner McKee hitting Ainias Smith for the touchdown. GIANTS EAGLES The pick: Eagles 17, Giants 14 Why: The Eagles won't be playing many of their starters, and that includes Saquon Barkley, whose run at the NFL record should take a backseat to Philly's chances in the NFC playoffs. It's hard to imagine the Giants duplicating their performance from the victory over the Colts, although Malik Nabers needs four catches to set the Giants' single season record for receptions currently held by Steve Smith (107, 2009).

                "content": "The Philadelphia Eagles and the New York Giants met in Week 18 of the regular season, in a game without a lot of meaning for both teams. The Eagles, already qualified for the playoffs, rested almost all of their key starters ahead of the Wild Card Round game. The Giants, on the other hand, would not complain about a loss, as they wanted to keep themselves with a high pick in the 2025 NFL draft. Although neither team had much of an incentive in this game, with Philadelphia locked in the second NFC seed, it was a good opportunity to assess some of their backups and get ready for the January run. Looking to predict NFL playoff Scenarios? Try our NFL Playoff Predictor for real-time simulations and stay ahead of the game! The Giants had no real incentive to win this game, and they lost indeed. They did put up a fight in the second half, but ultimately, the Eagles did just enough to keep themselves afloat, even if most of their starters did not step foot into the game. Apart from his interception, Lock mostly played a solid game, with a great throw to Malik Nabers in a touchdown but not much impressive after. He will remain a backup in the NFL in 2025, but there's no chance he'll start the season as a starter for any team. With another good performance, Nabers finished the season with 109 receptions, 1,204 yards and seven touchdowns, playing with below-average quarterbacks throughout the year. Even if this isn't the most exciting season for New York fans, at least they can be happy with the young star receiver. Jalen Hurts was never going to play in this game, but Philadelphia decided to give the starting nod to McKee with Kenny Pickett suffering from a problem in the ribs. And he impressed, with 269 passing yards, two touchdowns and no turnovers. Dallas Goedert was one of the few starters who saw game-time in this Week 18 game. The team wanted to give him a few plays to, as they defined, \"knock off the rust\". The tight end has been injured, but he's an important player in the Eagles' scheme. Giants Nation!

                "title": "Tampa Bay - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Tampa Bay is a large natural harbor and shallow estuary connected to the Gulf of Mexico on the west-central coast of Florida, comprising Hillsborough Bay, McKay Bay, Old Tampa Bay, Middle Tampa Bay, and Lower Tampa Bay. The largest freshwater inflow into the bay is the Hillsborough River, which flows into Hillsborough Bay in downtown Tampa. Many other smaller rivers and streams also flow into Tampa Bay, resulting in a large watershed area. The shores of Tampa Bay were home to the Weeden Island Culture and then the Safety Harbor culture for thousands of years. These cultures relied heavily on Tampa Bay for food, and the waters were rich enough that they were one of the few Native American cultures that did not have to farm. The Tocobaga was likely the dominant chiefdom in the area when Spanish explorers arrived in the early 1500s, but there were likely smaller chiefdoms on the eastern side of the bay which were not well documented. The indigenous population had been decimated by disease and warfare by the late 1600s, and there were no permanent human settlements in the area for over a century. The United States took possession of Florida in 1821 and established Fort Brooke at the mouth of the Hillsborough River in 1824. The communities surrounding Tampa Bay grew tremendously during the 20th century. Today, the area is home to about 4 million residents, making Tampa Bay a heavily used commercial and recreational waterway and subjecting it to increasing amounts of pollutants from industry, agriculture, sewage, and surface runoff. The bay's water quality was seriously degraded by the early 1980s, resulting in a sharp decline in sea life and decreased availability for recreational use. Greater care has been taken in recent decades to mitigate the effects of human habitation on Tampa Bay, most notably upgraded sewage treatment facilities and several sea grass restoration projects, resulting in improved water quality over time. However, occasional red tide and other algae blooms have caused concern about the ongoing health of the estuary.[1] The term \"Tampa Bay\" is often used as shorthand to refer to all or parts of the Tampa Bay area, which comprises many towns and cities in several counties surrounding the large body of water. Local marketing and branding efforts (including several professional sports teams, tourist boards, and chambers of commerce) commonly use the moniker \"Tampa Bay\", furthering the misconception that it is the name of a particular municipality when this is not the case.[2][3] Tampa Bay formed approximately 6,000 years ago as a brackish drowned river valley type[4] estuary with a wide mouth connecting it to the Gulf of Mexico. Prior to that time, it was a large fresh water lake, possibly fed by the Floridan Aquifer through natural springs.[5] Though the exact process of the lake-to-bay transformation is not completely understood, the leading theory is that rising sea levels following the last ice age coupled with the formation of a massive sink hole near the current mouth of the bay created a connection between the lake and the gulf.[6] Tampa Bay is Florida's largest open-water estuary, extending over 400 square miles (1,000 km2) and forming coastlines of Hillsborough, Manatee and Pinellas counties. The freshwater sources of the bay are distributed among over a hundred small tributaries, rather than a single river.[7] The Hillsborough River is the largest such freshwater source, with the Alafia, Manatee, and Little Manatee rivers the next largest sources. Because of these many flows into the bay, its large watershed covers portions of five Florida counties[8] and approximately 2,200 square miles (5,700 km2). The bottom of Tampa Bay is silty and sandy, with an average water depth of only about 12 feet (3.7 m).[9] The relatively shallow water and tidal mud flats allow for large sea grass beds, and along with the surrounding mangrove-dominated wetlands, the bay provides habitat for a wide variety of wildlife. More than 200 species of fish are found in the waters of the bay, along with bottlenose dolphins and manatees, plus many types of marine invertebrates including oysters, scallops, clams, shrimp and crab. More than two dozen species of birds, including brown pelicans, several types of heron and egret, Roseate spoonbills, cormorants, and laughing gulls make their year-round home along its shores and small islands, with several other migratory species joining them in the winter. The cooler months are also when warm-water outfalls from power plants bordering the bay draw one out of every six West Indian manatees, an endangered species, to the area.[10] Tampa Bay was designated as an \"estuary of national significance\" by the United States Environmental Protection Agency in 1990. Two National Wildlife Refuges are located in Tampa Bay: Pinellas National Wildlife Refuge and the refuge on Egmont Key. Most of the islands (including several man-made islands built from dredge spoil[9][11]) and sandbars are off-limits to the public, due to their fragile ecology and their use as nesting sites by many species of birds. The Tampa Bay Estuary Program keeps watch over the Bay's health.[9] Tampa Bay was once teeming with fish and wildlife. People of the Safety Harbor culture lived almost entirely from mullet, shellfish, sea turtles, manatees, crabs, and other bounties harvested from the sea. As late as the early 20th century, visitors still reported huge schools of mullet swimming across the bay in such numbers that they \"impeded the passage of boats\".[12] The establishment and rapid growth of surrounding communities during the 20th century caused serious damage to the bay's natural environment. Heavy harvesting of fish and other sea life, constant dredging of shipping channels, and the clearing of mangroves for shoreline development were important factors.[13] Most damaging was the discharge of waste water and other pollutants into the bay, which drastically degraded water quality.[14] The bay's health reached a low point in the 1970s. The water was so murky that sunlight could not reach the shallow bottom, reducing sea grass coverage by more than 80% compared to earlier in the century and severely impacting the marine ecosystem. Many previously common species became scarce, and bay beaches were regularly closed due to unsafe levels of bacteria and pollutants.[14][15] Beginning in the early 1980s after federal and state legislation to improve water quality, authorities installed improved water treatment plants and tightened regulation of industrial discharge, leading to slow but steady improvement in water quality and general ecological health.[16] By 2010, measures of sea grass coverage, water clarity, and biodiversity had improved to levels last seen in the 1950s.[17] However, industrial and agricultural runoff along with runoff from developed areas pose a continuing threat to marine ecosystems in the bay, particularly by clouding the water with sediments and algae blooms, and seagrass coverage declined slightly in the late 2010s.[15][18][1] Wastewater pollution from old phosphate plants near the shoreline has been a particular problem. For example, in 2004, a leak of 65 million gallons of acidic water from a Cargill phosphate plant on the bay's southern shore severely impacted wetlands in the vicinity of the spill.[19] And in April 2021, a breach of a wastewater reservoir at the long-closed Piney Point phosphate plant sent over 200 millions gallons of nutrient-rich mine tailings streaming into lower Tampa Bay.[20] The resulting growth of red tide algae led to an ecocide and killed over 1000 tons of fish in the bay and along the nearby gulf coast and may lead to further damage to seagrass beds.[1] The effects of Hurricane Milton in October 2024 caused polluted waste from the fertilizer industry including products from Mosaic, which were retained after the production of phosphate, to enter into Tampa Bay. Both Hurricane Milton and Hurricane Helene caused disruption in the production of phosphate fertilizers from Tampa Bay.[21][22][23][24][25][26][27] Tampa Bay, like other parts of Florida, is extremely vulnerable to sea level rise caused by climate change.[18] The sea level has risen 8 inches (200 mm) since 1946.[18] Tampa Bay is also one of the areas in the US most at risk when hurricanes arrive because of its location, growing population, and the geography of the bay.[28][further explanation needed] The Tampa Bay Regional Resiliency Coalition coordinates the region's response to climate change.[29] Communities throughout the Bay, including St. Petersburg and Tampa are adapting infrastructure and buildings to face changes in sea level.[18] Humans have lived in Florida for millennia, at least 14,000 years. Due to worldwide glaciation, sea levels were much lower at the time, and Florida's peninsula extended almost 60 miles west of today's coastline. Paleo-Indian sites have been found near rivers and lakes in northern Florida, leading to speculation that these first Floridians also lived on Tampa Bay when it was still a freshwater lake.[30] Evidence of human habitation from this early period has been found at the Harney Flats site, which is approximately 10 miles east of the current location of Tampa's downtown waterfront.[31] The earliest evidence of human habitation directly on the shores of Tampa Bay comes from the Manasota culture, a variant of the Weeden Island culture, who lived in the area beginning around 5,000–6,000 years ago, after sea levels had risen to near modern levels and the bay was connected to the Gulf of Mexico.[32] This culture, which relied almost exclusively on the bay for food and other resources, was in turn replaced by the similar Safety Harbor culture by approximately 800 AD. The pre-contact Indigenous nation most associated with the Tampa Bay are the historic Tocobaga nation,[33] who are known to be among the ancestors of the contemporary Seminole and Miccosukee Tribes of Florida. [34] The Safety Harbor culture was dominant in the area at the time of first contact with Europeans in the mid-1500s. The Tocobaga, who built their principal town near today's Safety Harbor in the northwest corner of Old Tampa Bay, are the most documented group from that era because they had the most interactions with Spanish explorers. However, there were many other coastal villages organized into various small chiefdoms all around the bay.[35] Not finding gold or silver in the vicinity and unable to convert the native inhabitants to Christianity, the Spanish did not remain in the Tampa Bay area for long. However, diseases they introduced decimated the native population over the ensuing decades,[36] leading to the near-total collapse of every established culture across peninsular Florida. Between this depopulation and the indifference of its colonial owners, the Tampa Bay region would be virtually uninhabited for almost 200 years. Tampa Bay was given different names by early mapmakers. Spanish maps dated from 1584 identifies Tampa Bay as Baya de Spirito Santo (\"Bay of the Holy Spirit\").[37] A map dated 1695 identifies the area as Bahia Tampa.[38] Later maps dated 1794[39] and 1800[40] show the bay divided with three different names, Tampa Bay west of the Interbay peninsula and Hillsboro Bay on the east with an overall name of Bay of Spiritu Santo. At other times, the entire bay was identified as The Bay of Tocobaga.[41] The United States acquired Florida from Spain in 1821. The name Spirito Santo seems to have disappeared from maps of the region in favor of \"Tampa Bay\" (sometimes divided into Tampa and Hillsboro Bays) soon after the US established Fort Brooke at the mouth of the Hillsborough River in 1824.[42] For the next several decades, during the Seminole Wars, the Tampa Bay would be a primary point of confrontation, detention, and forced expulsion of the Seminole & Miccosukee people of Florida. Fort Brooke,[43] Fort Dade, and the American military's miscellaneous Egmont Key facilities [44][45] were the primary sites associated with the removal of the Seminole in the Floridian leg of the Trail of Tears.[46][47] For the next 100 years, many new communities were founded around the bay. Fort Brooke begat Tampa on the northeast shore, Fort Harrison (a minor military outpost on Florida's west coast) begat Clearwater, the trading post of \"Braden's Town\" developed into Bradenton on the south, and St. Petersburg grew quickly after its founding in the late 19th century, on the western bay shore opposite Tampa. By 2010, the Tampa Bay Area was home to over 4 million residents. As Tampa began to grow in the mid-1800s, roads across central Florida were still just rough trails and rail lines did not yet extend down the Florida peninsula, so the most convenient means of traveling to and from the area was by sea. By the late 19th century, however, the shallow nature of Tampa Bay made it impossible for large modern vessels with deeper drafts to reach the city of Tampa's downtown wharves on Hillsboro Bay. Most ships would anchor well out from shore and transfer cargo and passengers to and from the city in smaller boats.[12] Henry B. Plant's railroad line reached the area in 1884 and ran across the Interbay Peninsula to Old Tampa Bay, where he built the town and shipping facility of Port Tampa at its terminus.[48] In 1898, Plant used his connections in the federal government to make Port Tampa a major embarkation point for the U.S. Army during the Spanish–American War, leading to the U.S. Congress appropriating funds for the United States Army Corps of Engineers to begin the first large dredging operation in Tampa Bay. A deep shipping channel was created which linked Port Tampa to the mouth of the bay, enabling Plant to greatly expand his steamship line.[49][50] In 1917, the Corps of Engineers dredged another channel from the mouth of Tampa Bay to the Port of Tampa, instantly making the city an important shipping center. The Corps of Engineers currently maintains more than 80 miles of deep-water channels in Tampa Bay up to a depth of 47 feet. These must be continuously re-dredged and deepened due to the sandy nature of the bay bottom. While dredging has enabled seaborne commerce to become an important part of the Tampa Bay area's economy, it has also damaged the bay's water quality and ecology. More care has been taken in recent decades to lessen the environmental impact of dredging.[51] Dredged material has also been used to create several spoil islands on the eastern side of Hillsboro Bay. These islands have become important nesting sites for many seabirds, including threatened species such as oystercatchers, and have been designated as \"sanctuary islands\" that are off-limits to boaters.[52][53] In the early 20th century, traveling overland between the growing communities around Tampa Bay was an arduous process. The trip between Tampa and St. Petersburg was almost 50 miles (80 km) around the north end of Old Tampa Bay and took up to 12 hours by train and over a full day over uncertain roads by car.[58][59] The trip between St. Petersburg and Bradenton was even longer – over 70 miles (110 km) all the way around Tampa Bay, a trip that still took about two hours into the 1950s.[60] In 1924, the Gandy Bridge over Old Tampa Bay reduced the driving distance between Tampa and St. Petersburg to 19 miles (31 km).[61] Ten years later, the Davis Causeway (later renamed the Courtney Campbell Causeway) was built between Clearwater and Tampa. More bridges criss-crossed Tampa Bay over the ensuing decades, making travel between the surrounding communities much faster and furthering the economic development of the Tampa Bay area. The difficulty of traveling between Tampa and St. Petersburg in the early 20th century inspired the world's first scheduled air service, the St. Petersburg-Tampa Airboat Line, which operated during the tourist season of 1914.[58][59] While the construction of bridges made air travel across Tampa Bay unnecessary, several airports have been built along the shoreline. Albert Whitted Airport on the St. Petersburg waterfront and Peter O. Knight Airport on Davis Island near downtown Tampa were both established in the 1930s. Later, Tampa International Airport and St. Pete–Clearwater International Airport were established on opposite sides of Old Tampa Bay, and MacDill Air Force Base opened on the southern tip of Tampa's Interbay Peninsula.",

                "title": "Tampa, Florida - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Tampa (/ˈtæmpə/ ⓘ TAM-pə) is a city on the Gulf Coast of the U.S. state of Florida. Tampa's borders include the north shore of Tampa Bay and the east shore of Old Tampa Bay. Tampa is the largest city in the Tampa Bay area and the county seat of Hillsborough County. With an estimated population of 403,364 in 2023, Tampa is the 49th-most populous city in the country and the third-most populous city in Florida after Jacksonville and Miami. Tampa was founded as a military center in the 19th century, with the establishment of Fort Brooke. The cigar industry was brought to Tampa by Vincente Martinez Ybor, after whom Ybor City is named. Tampa was reincorporated as a city in 1887 following the Civil War. Tampa's economy is driven by tourism, health care, finance, insurance, technology, construction, and the maritime industry.[12] The bay's port is the largest in the state, responsible for over $15 billion in economic impact.[13] Tampa is part of the Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is a four-county area composed of roughly 3.1 million residents,[14] making it the second-largest metropolitan statistical area (MSA) in the state and the sixth largest in the Southeastern United States, behind Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, Washington D.C., Atlanta, and Miami.[15] The Greater Tampa Bay area has over 4 million residents, and generally includes the Tampa and Sarasota metro areas. The earliest instance of the name \"Tampa\", in the form \"Tanpa\", appears in the memoirs of Hernando de Escalante Fontaneda, who spent 17 years as a captive of the Calusa and traveled through much of peninsular Florida. He described Tanpa as an important Calusa town to the north of the Calusa domain, possibly under another chief. Archaeologist Jerald Milanich places the town of Tanpa at the mouth of Charlotte Harbor. The entrances to Tampa Bay and Charlotte Harbor are obscured by barrier islands, and their locations, and the names applied to them, were a source of confusion to explorers, surveyors and map-makers from the 16th century to the 18th century. Bahía Tampa and Bahía de Espíritu Santo were each used, at one time or another, for the modern Tampa Bay and Charlotte Harbor.[16][17] Tampa Bay was labeled Bahía de Espíritu Santo (Bay of the Holy Spirit) in the earliest Spanish maps of Florida. It became known as B. Tampa (Bahía Tampa or Tampa Bay) as early as 1576.[18][19] In 1601, \"B. Tampa\", corresponding to Tampa Bay, appeared for the first time on a printed map in Antonio de Herrera y Tordesillas's Description del Destricto del Audiencia de la Espanola, from his book Descripcion de las Indias Ocidentales, printed in Madrid.[20] A 1705 British map also shows B. Tampa, with \"Carlos Bay\" for Charlotte Harbor to the south. A 1748 British map had \"B. del Spirito Santo\" for Tampa Bay and \"Carlos Bay\" to the south. A Spanish map of 1757 renamed Tampa Bay as \"San Fernando\". As late as 1774, Bernard Romans called Tampa Bay \"Bay of Espiritu Santo\", with \"Tampa Bay\" restricted to the Northwest arm, what is now Old Tampa Bay, and the northeast arm named \"Hillsborough Bay\". The name may have come from the Calusa language or possibly, the Timucua language. Some scholars have compared \"Tampa\" to \"itimpi\", which means \"close to\" or \"nearby\" in the Creek language, but its meaning is not known.[17] In 1849, when the pioneer community living near the U.S. Army outpost of Fort Brooke was incorporated, it was called \"Tampa Town\". In 1855, the name was shortened to simply \"Tampa\".[16][17] People from Tampa are generally known as \"Tampans\", \"Tampanians\", or \"Tampeños\".[21] In 2014, local authorities consulted by Michael Kruse of the Tampa Bay Times suggest that \"Tampan\" was historically more common, while \"Tampanian\" became popular when the former term came to be seen as a potential insult.[22] A mix of Cuban, Italian, and Spanish immigrants began arriving in the late 1800s to found and work in the new communities of Ybor City and West Tampa. By about 1900, these newcomers came to be known as \"Tampeños\", or \"Tampeñas\" for females, a term that is still sometimes used to refer to their descendants living in the area, and potentially, to all residents of Tampa regardless of their ethnic background.[22][23][24][7] The shores of Tampa Bay have been inhabited for thousands of years. A variant of the Weeden Island culture developed in the area by about 2,000 years ago. Archeological evidence suggests that these residents relied on the sea for most of their resources, as a vast majority of inhabited sites have been found on or near the shoreline, with little evidence of farming. At the time of European contact in the early 16th century, several chiefdoms of the Safety Harbor culture dominated the area.[25] Early Spanish explorers interacted most extensively with the Tocobaga, whose principal town was at the northern end of Old Tampa Bay near today's Safety Harbor in Pinellas County. While there is a substantial historical record of the Tocobaga, and the Calusa, who lived to the south, there is less surviving documentation describing the Pohoy, who lived near the mouth of the Hillsborough River near today's downtown Tampa. Evidence suggests that the language and culture of the Pohoy and other lesser-known groups around the bay were very similar to that of the Tocobaga.[26][27] Expeditions led by Pánfilo de Narváez and Hernando de Soto landed near Tampa, but neither conquistador stayed long. There is no natural gold or silver in Florida, and the native inhabitants repulsed Spanish attempts to establish a permanent settlement or convert them to Catholicism. The fighting resulted in a few deaths, but the many more deaths were caused by infectious diseases brought from Europe, which devastated the population of Native Americans across Florida and the entire Western Hemisphere. The indigenous cultures of the Tampa Bay area collapsed by around 1600, leaving the west coast of Spanish Florida largely depopulated and ignored for more than 200 years.[28] In the mid-18th century, events in the American colonies and the early United States drove the Seminole people into northern Florida. They did not move into central Florida until after the United States gained control of Florida in 1821.[29][30] Before the American period, the Tampa Bay area had a handful of residents: Cuban and Native American fishermen who established small seasonal camps called \"ranchos\" on the shores of Tampa Bay. The largest was at the mouth of Spanishtown Creek in today's Hyde Park neighborhood along Bayshore Boulevard.[31] After purchasing Florida from Spain in 1821, the United States built forts and trading posts in the new territory.[32] Fort Brooke was established in January 1824 at the mouth of the Hillsborough River on Tampa Bay, in Downtown Tampa.[33] Tampa was initially an isolated frontier outpost. The sparse civilian population practically abandoned the area during the Second Seminole War from 1835 to 1842, after which the Seminoles were forced out and many settlers returned.[34] Florida became the 27th state on March 3, 1845. On January 18, 1849, Tampa was officially incorporated as the \"Village of Tampa.\" It was home to 185 civilians, or 974 total residents including military personnel, in 1850.[35][36] Tampa was reincorporated as a town on December 15, 1855.[37] During the Civil War, Florida seceded along with most of the southern states to form the Confederate States of America, and Fort Brooke was defended by Confederate troops. Martial law was declared in Tampa in January 1862, and Tampa's city government ceased to operate for the duration of the war.[38] In 1861, the Union Navy set up a blockade around many southern ports to cut off the Confederacy. Several US Navy ships were stationed near the mouth of Tampa Bay, but small blockade running ships were often able to slip by the blockade to deliver cattle to Spanish Cuba, earning gold for the Confederate cause.[39][40][41] On June 30, 1862, the gunboat USS Sagamore sailed into Tampa Bay and opened fire on Fort Brooke, which returned fire. The Sagamore withdrew after a few hours, and the Battle of Tampa caused little damage. During the Battle of Fort Brooke on October 16 and the Battle of Ballast Point on October 18, 1863, Union forces inflicted serious damage to Tampa's economy when, under the cover of another bombardment of the fort, troops landed and destroyed two blockade running ships that had been hidden upstream along the Hillsborough River.[42] In May 1864, Union troops landed again and took Fort Brooke largely unopposed. They destroyed much of the fort's facilities and confiscated the remaining military supplies other than the cannons, which they tossed into the Hillsborough River, then left the \"desolate\" town after two days.[43] The Civil War ended in April 1865 with a Confederate defeat. In May 1865, federal troops arrived in Tampa to occupy the fort and the town as part of Reconstruction. They remained until August 1869.[citation needed] During the immediate post-war period, Tampa was a poor, isolated fishing village with about 1,000 residents and little industry. Yellow fever, borne by mosquitoes from nearby swamps, broke out several times during the 1860s and 1870s, causing more residents to leave.[44] In 1869, residents voted to abolish the city of Tampa government.[45] In 1870, the population of \"Tampa Town\" was about 800, and dropped to about 700 by 1880. Fort Brooke was decommissioned in 1883, further impacting the local economy in the short run, but opening up the waterfront for development. Except for two cannons displayed on the University of Tampa campus, all traces of the fort are gone.[43] In the mid-1880s, Tampa's fortunes took several sudden turns for the better. In 1883, phosphate was discovered in the Bone Valley region southeast of Tampa. The mineral, vital for the production of fertilizers and other products, was soon being shipped from the Port of Tampa in great volume. Tampa is still a major phosphate exporter. The discovery of phosphate, the arrival of Plant's railroad, and the founding of Ybor City and West Tampa—all in the mid-1880s—were crucial to Tampa's development. The once-struggling village of Tampa became a bustling boomtown almost overnight and had grown into one of the largest cities in Florida by 1900.[46] In late 1883, Henry B. Plant's narrow-gauge South Florida Railroad reached Tampa and its port, connecting the small town to the nation's railroad system after years of efforts by local leaders. Previously, Tampa's overland transportation links had consisted of sandy roads stretching across the Florida countryside. Plant's railroad made it much easier to get goods in and out of the Tampa Bay area. Phosphate and commercial fishing exports could be sent north by rail,[47] and many new products were brought into the Tampa market, along with the first tourists. The new railroad link enabled another important industry to come to Tampa. In 1885, the Tampa Board of Trade enticed Vicente Martinez Ybor to move his cigar manufacturing operations to Tampa from Key West. Proximity to Cuba made importation of \"clear Havana tobacco\" easy by sea, and Plant's railroad made shipment of finished cigars to the rest of the US market easy by land.[46] Since Tampa was still a small town at the time, with a population less than 5,000, Ybor built hundreds of small houses around his factory to accommodate the immediate influx of mainly Cuban and Spanish cigar workers. Ybor City's factories rolled their first cigars in 1886, and many different cigar manufacturers moved their operations to town in ensuing years. Many Italian and a few Eastern European Jewish immigrants arrived starting in the late 1880s, opening businesses and shops that catered to cigar workers.[48] By 1900, over 10,000 immigrants had moved to the neighborhood. Several thousand more Cuban immigrants built West Tampa, another cigar-centric suburb founded a few years later by Hugh MacFarlane. Between them, two \"Latin\" communities combined to exponentially expand Tampa's population, economic base, and tax revenues, as Tampa became the \"Cigar Capital of the World\".[48] During the first few decades of the 20th century, the cigar-making industry was the backbone of Tampa's economy. The factories in Ybor City and West Tampa made an enormous number of cigars—in the peak year of 1929, over 500 million cigars were hand rolled in Tampa.[49] In 1904, a civic association of local businessmen dubbed themselves Ye Mystic Krewe of Gasparilla, named after local mythical pirate José Gaspar, and staged an \"invasion\" of the city followed by a parade. With a few exceptions, the Gasparilla Pirate Festival has been held every year since.[50] Beginning in the late 19th century, illegal bolita lotteries were very popular among the Tampa working classes, especially in Ybor City. In the early 1920s, this small-time operation was taken over by Charlie Wall, the rebellious son of a prominent Tampa family, and went big-time. Bolita was able to openly thrive only because of kick-backs and bribes to key local politicians and law enforcement officials, and many were on the take.[51] Profits from the bolita lotteries and Prohibition-era bootlegging led to the development of several organized crime factions in Tampa. Charlie Wall was the first major boss, but various power struggles culminated in consolidation of control by Sicilian mafioso Santo Trafficante Sr. and his faction in the 1950s. After his death in 1954 from cancer, control passed to his son, Santo Trafficante Jr., who established alliances with families in New York City and extended his power throughout Florida and into Batista-era Cuba.[52][53] The era of rampant and open corruption ended in the 1950s, when Estes Kefauver's traveling organized crime hearings came to town and were followed by the sensational misconduct trials of several local officials. Although many of the worst offenders in government and the mob were not charged, the trials helped to end the sense of lawlessness which had prevailed in Tampa for decades.[51] Tampa grew considerably as a result of World War II. Prior to the United States' involvement in the conflict, construction began on MacDill Field, which served as a main base for Army Air Corps and later Army Air Forces operations just before and during World War II, with multiple auxiliary airfields around the Tampa Bay area and surrounding counties. At the end of the war, MacDill remained as an active military installation, while the auxiliary fields reverted to civilian control. Two of these auxiliary fields later became the present-day Tampa International Airport and St. Petersburg–Clearwater International Airport. With the establishment of an independent U.S. Air Force in 1947, MacDill Field became MacDill Air Force Base. In the 1950s and 1960s, Tampa had record-setting population growth that has not been seen since. This growth spurred expansion of Tampa's highways and bridges, bringing thousands into the city and creating opportunities for Tampa business owners, who welcomed the influx of tourists and new residents. It was during this time period in Tampa's history that two of the most popular tourist attractions in the area were developed – Busch Gardens and Lowry Park. Many of the well-known institutions that play an important role in the economic development of Tampa were established during this time period.[54] The University of South Florida was established in North Tampa in 1956 and opened for students in September 1960.[55] The school spurred the construction of several residential and commercial developments in the previously agriculture-dominated area around the new campus. Overall, Tampa continued to expand away from the city center during the 1960s as new hospitals, schools, churches and subdivisions all began appearing to accommodate the growth. Many business offices began moving away from the traditional downtown office building into more convenient neighborhood office plazas.[54] In 1970, the U.S. Census Bureau reported Tampa's population as being 80.0% white and 19.7% black.[56] Four attempts have been made to consolidate the municipal government of the city of Tampa with the county government of Hillsborough County, in 1967, 1970, 1971, and 1972, all of which failed at the ballot box. The greatest loss was the most recent attempt in 1972, with the final tally being 33,160 (31%) in favor and 73,568 (69%) against the proposed charter.[57] The biggest recent growth of Tampa was the development of New Tampa, which started in 1988 when the city annexed a mostly rural area of 24 sq mi (62 km2) between I-275 and I-75.[citation needed] East Tampa, historically a mostly black community, was the scene of several race riots during and for some time after the period of racial segregation, mainly due to problems between residents and the Tampa Police Department.[58][59] According to the United States Census Bureau, Tampa has a total area of 175.3 sq mi (453.9 km2), including 113.4 sq mi (293.7 km2) of land and 61.8 sq mi (160.1 km2) (35.3%) of water.[10] The highest point in Tampa is only 48 ft (15 m) above sea level. Tampa is bordered by two bodies of water, Old Tampa Bay and Hillsborough Bay, which flow together to form Tampa Bay, which flows into the Gulf of Mexico.[60] The Hillsborough River flows into Hillsborough Bay, passing directly in front of Downtown Tampa and supplying Tampa's main source of fresh water. The Palm River is a smaller river, flowing from just east of the city into McKay Bay, which is a smaller inlet, sited at the northeast end of Hillsborough Bay.[60] Tampa's geography is marked by the Interbay Peninsula, which divides Hillsborough Bay in the east, from Old Tampa Bay in the west. Tampa is divided into many neighborhoods, many of which were towns and unincorporated communities annexed by the growing city. Generally, Tampa is divided into the following areas: Downtown Tampa, New Tampa, West Tampa, East Tampa, North Tampa, and South Tampa. Well-known neighborhoods include Ybor City, Forest Hills, Ballast Point, Sulphur Springs, Seminole Heights, Tampa Heights, Palma Ceia, Hyde Park, Davis Islands, Harbour Island, Tampa Palms, College Hill, Water Street, Channelside and non-residential areas of Gary and the Westshore Business District. Tampa displays a wide variety of architectural designs and styles. Most of Tampa's high rises demonstrate post-modern architecture. The design for the renovated Tampa Museum of Art displays post-modern architecture, while the city hall and the Tampa Theatre belong to Art Deco architecture. The Tampa mayor Pam Iorio made the redevelopment of Tampa's downtown, especially residential development, a priority.[61] Several residential and mixed-development high-rises have been constructed. Another of Mayor Iorio's initiatives was the Tampa Riverwalk, a mixed-use path along the Hillsborough River in downtown. Channelside was approved to undergo major renovations by Tampa Bay Lightning owner Jeff Vinik along with Bill Gates and other investors.[62] Several museums have opened, including new homes for the Tampa Bay History Center, the Glazer Children's Museum, and the Tampa Museum of Art.[63] The breakdown of development for the rest of the plan is as follows: 39% residential units, 29% office space, 15% hotels, 8% retail, 7% other, and 2% cultural uses.[64] Mayor Bob Buckhorn continued these developments, which are bearing fruit during the term of Mayor Jane Castor. Tampa is the site of several skyscrapers. Overall, there are 30 completed buildings that rise over 250 ft (76 m) high. Tampa also has 147 high-rises,[65] second only to Miami in the state of Florida. The tallest building in the city is 100 North Tampa, formerly the AmSouth Building, which rises 42 floors and 579 ft (176 m) in Downtown Tampa.[66] The structure was completed in 1992, and is the tallest building in Florida outside of Miami and Jacksonville.[66] The Sulphur Springs Water Tower, a landmark in the Sulphur Springs section of the city, stands 214 feet tall and was built by Grover Poole in the late 1920s.[67] This 1920s boom period for Florida also saw the construction of an ornate movie palace, the Tampa Theatre, a Mediterranean revival on Davis Islands, and Bayshore Boulevard, which borders Hillsborough Bay from downtown Tampa to areas in South Tampa. The road has a 6 mi (10 km) continuous sidewalk on the eastern end, the longest in the world.[68][69] The Ybor City District is home to several buildings on the National Register of Historic Places and has been declared a National Historic Landmark. Notable structures include El Centro Español de Tampa, Centro Asturiano de Tampa and other social clubs built in the early 1900s. Including L'Unione Italiana or the Italian Club, at 1731 East 7th Avenue in Ybor City. The Italian Club mission \"is to preserve and honor the culture, traditions and heritage of the Italian Community and to maintain the historical facility as a functioning memorial to the working class immigrants.\"[70] Babe Zaharias Golf Course in the Forest Hills area of Tampa has been designated a Historical Landmark by the National Register of Historic Places. It was bought in 1949 by the famous \"Babe\" Didrikson Zaharias, who had a residence nearby, and closed upon her death. In 1974, the city of Tampa opened the golf course to the public.[71] The Story of Tampa, a public painting by Lynn Ash, is a 4 ft × 8 ft (1.2 m × 2.4 m) oil on masonite mural that weaves together many of the notable aspects of Tampa's unique character and identity. It was commissioned in 2003 by the city's Public Art Program and is in the lobby of the Tampa Municipal Office Building.[72] Park Tower, originally the First Financial Bank of Florida, is the first substantial skyscraper in downtown Tampa. Completed in 1973, it was the tallest skyscraper in Tampa until the completion of One Tampa City Center in 1981.[73] The Rivergate building, a cylindrical structure known as the \"Beer Can building\", was featured in the movie The Punisher. Spanning the southern part of Tampa Bay is the massive steel-span Sunshine Skyway Bridge. Tampa is home to the Bro Bowl, one of the last remaining skateparks built during skateboarding's \"Golden Era\" in the 1970s.[74] It opened in 1979 and was constructed by Tampa Parks and Recreation in 1978.[75] It was the first public skatepark to be constructed in Florida and the third on the East Coast.[76] Other Tampa landmarks include the Tampa Riverwalk, which is a 2.6-mile-long (4.2 km) open space and pedestrian trail development along the Hillsborough River, and Curtis Hixon Waterfront Park. The Tampa Bay area has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen Cfa), although due to its location on the Florida peninsula on Tampa Bay and the Gulf of Mexico, it shows some characteristics of a tropical climate. Tampa has hot and humid summers with frequent thunderstorms and dry and mild winters. Average highs range from 71 to 91 °F (22 to 33 °C) year round, and lows 53 to 77 °F (12 to 25 °C). The city of Tampa is split between two USDA climate zones. In the 2012 USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map, Tampa is listed as USDA zone 9b north of Kennedy Boulevard away from the bay and 10a near the shorelines and in the interbay peninsula south of Kennedy Boulevard. Zone 10a is about the northern limit of where coconut palms and royal palms can be grown, although some specimens do grow in northern Tampa. Recently, certain palm tree species in the area, along with the rest of the state, have been and continue to be severely affected by a plant disease called Texas phoenix palm decline, which has caused a considerable amount of damage to various local palm tree landscapes and threatens the native palm tree species in the region.[77] Though threatened by tropical systems almost every hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to November 30, Tampa has seldom felt major effects from tropical storms or hurricanes. No hurricane has made landfall in the immediate Tampa Bay area since the category 4 1921 Tampa Bay hurricane made landfall near Tarpon Springs and caused extensive damage throughout the region.[78][79] Over the past few decades, four major hurricanes were forecast to hit the Tampa Bay area from the south-southwest, which is a worse-case track that would result in a maximum storm surge event: Hurricane Donna (1960), Hurricane Charley (2004), Hurricane Irma (2017), and Hurricane Ian (2022).[80][81] All of these storms veered to the east or northeast before reaching Tampa Bay and instead made landfall down the coast, resulting in serious damage in southwest Florida. Irma had the greatest effect on Tampa. It made landfall near Marco Island on September 10, 2017, and moved due north, passing through eastern Hillsborough County as a Category 1 storm and causing widespread issues in the area, particularly disrupting the electrical grid for several days.[82] Because of tremendous population growth and coastal development in the century since the last hurricane landfall, combined with rising sea levels due to climate change, the Tampa Bay Area is considered one of the most vulnerable regions in the world to a direct hit from a major storm.[78] Summertime weather patterns predominate from late May to early October, which is the region's rainy season.[83] Daily weather is very consistent during this period, with daytime highs averaging about 91 °F (33 °C), lows usually in the mid- to upper 70s °F (23–25 °C), high humidity, and a regular chance of rain, especially in the afternoon. Mainly due to the proximity of large bodies of water, the official high temperature has never hit 100 °F (37.8 °C) – the all-time record high temperature is 99 °F (37 °C), first recorded on June 5, 1985, and tied on June 26, 2020.[84] Afternoon thunderstorms are regularly generated by the interaction of the Gulf and Atlantic sea breezes and are such a regular occurrence during the summer that the Tampa Bay area and nearby inland areas of Central Florida are recognized as the \"Lightning Capital of North America\". Afternoon thundershowers occasionally intensify into a severe thunderstorm, bringing heavy downpours, frequent lightning, strong straight-line winds, and sometimes hail.[85] Average temperatures gradually fall beginning in September, and average daily rainfall amounts decrease as autumn progresses. November is usually Tampa's driest month. However, rain totals in the fall can be augmented by passing tropical systems, which can dump several inches of rain. Winter in the area is generally dry and cooler. Average high temperatures range from the low to mid-70s °F (21–23 °C) during the day to the low to mid-50s °F (11–13 °C) at night. Occasional cold fronts push through the area during the season, usually bringing a brief period of rain followed by daytime highs in the 50s °F (10–13 °C) and nighttime lows near 40 °F (5 °C) for a day or two. Tampa experiences occasional frosts, with an annual mean minimum temperature of 32.8 °F (0.4 °C) Since the Tampa area is home to a diverse range of freeze-sensitive agriculture and aquaculture, hard freezes, although quite rare, are a major concern. Hard freezes, defined as a temperature of 28 °F (−2.2 °C) or below for several hours, occur rarely in the Tampa area, every five to twenty years depending on the exact location. The last widespread freeze occurred on the morning of January 18, 2018, when the official temperature at Tampa International Airport dropped to 29 °F (−2 °C).[86][87] The lowest temperature ever recorded in Tampa was 18 °F (−8 °C) on December 13, 1962.[85] The only snowfall officially recorded in Tampa occurred on January 19, 1977, with local accumulations ranging between a trace and 0.2 in (0.5 cm).[88] Tampa has a slow increase in average temperatures beginning in mid-February, and spring brings mostly warm and sunny weather to the area. While temperatures in late spring approach summertime values, the rainy season does not usually begin until June, leading to the threat of brush fires from approximately late March until May. Occasionally, a late-season cold front pushes through the area, potentially bringing a brief round of severe weather followed by a few days of unseasonably cool temperatures. Tampa first appeared in the 1850 U.S. Census with a total recorded population of 974, which included soldiers stationed at Fort Brooke.[96] Tampa did not report separately in 1860.[97] In the 2020 United States census, there were 384,959 people, 156,705 households, and 85,195 families living in Tampa.[101] The U.S. Census accounts for race by two methodologies: \"Race alone\" where Hispanics are allocated to the various racial categories and \"Race alone less Hispanics\" where Hispanics are excluded from the racial categories and delineated separately as if a separate race. In the 2020 U.S. Census, the racial makeup, including Hispanics in the racial counts, was 49.70% (191,309) White alone, 21.91% (84,340) Black alone, 0.41% (1,563) Native American alone, 5.43% (20,895) Asian alone, 0.08% (308) Pacific Islander alone, 7.63% (29,385) Other Race alone, and 14.85% (57,159) Multiracial or Mixed Race.[102] In the 2020 U.S. Census, the racial and ethnic makeup, where Hispanics are excluded from the racial counts and placed in their own category, was 43.32% (166,775) White alone (non-Hispanic), 20.93% (80,583) Black alone (non-Hispanic), 0.19% (741) Native American alone (non-Hispanic), 5.35% (20,587) Asian alone (non-Hispanic), 0.06% (246) Pacific Islander alone (non-Hispanic), 0.71% (2,746) Other Race alone (non-Hispanic), 3.81% (14,660) Multiracial or Mixed Race (non-Hispanic), and 25.62% (98,621) Hispanic or Latino.[100] In the 2010 United States census, there were 335,709 people, 133,277 households, and 75,562 families living in Tampa.[103] In 2006, the median income for a household in Tampa was $39,602, and the median income for a family was $45,823. Males had a median income of $40,461 versus $29,868 for females. The per capita income for Tampa was $26,522. 20.1% of the population and 16.4% of families were below the poverty line. 31.0% of those under the age of 18 and 13.6% of those 65 and older were living below the poverty level. In 2000, the racial makeup of Tampa was 64.22% White (51.0% White Non-Hispanic), 26.07% Black or African American, 0.38% American Indian and Alaska Native, 2.15% Asian, 0.09% Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander, 4.17% from other races, and 2.92% from two or more races. 19.29% of the population are Hispanic or Latino of any race. The largest European ancestries in the city as of 2000 were German (9.2%), Irish (8.4%), English (7.7%), Italian (5.6%), and French (2.4%).[104] In 2000, 27.6% households had children under the age of 18 living with them, 36.4% were married couples living together, 16.1% had a female householder with no husband present, and 42.9% were non-families. 33.7% of all households were made up of individuals, and 10.2% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.36 and the average family size was 3.07. In 2000, 24.6% of Tampa's population was under the age of 18, 10.0% aged from 18 to 24, 32.3% from 25 to 44, 20.5% from 45 to 64, and 12.5% were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 34.7 years old. For every 100 females, there were 95.3 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 92.1 males. In 2000, those who spoke only English at home accounted for 77.4% of all residents, while 22.6% spoke other languages in their homes. Spanish speakers were 17.8% of the population. Both French and Italian were each spoken by 0.6% of the population.[105] Communities of faith have organized in Tampa from 1846, when a Methodist congregation established the city's first church,[106] to 1939, when a 21-year-old Billy Graham began his career as a spiritual evangelist and preacher on downtown's Franklin Street,[107] and through to today. Among Tampa's noteworthy religious structures are Sacred Heart Catholic Church, a 1905 downtown landmark noted for its soaring, Romanesque revival construction in granite and marble with German-crafted stained glass windows,[108] the distinctive rock and mortar St. James Episcopal House of Prayer, listed with the National Register of Historic Places,[109] and the St. Paul AME church, which has seen the likes of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.[107] and President Bill Clinton speak from its pulpit.[110] The latter two have been designated by the city government as Local Landmark Structures.[111] Tampa's religious community includes a broad representation of Christian denominations, including those above, and Baptist, Presbyterian, Lutheran, Christian Science, Church of God, United Church of Christ, Philippine Independent Church, Metropolitan Community Church, Seventh-day Adventist, Eastern Orthodox (Greek, Coptic, Syrian, and OCA), various Pentecostal movements, Anglicans, the Quakers, Jehovah's Witnesses, and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. There is also at least one congregation of Messianic Jews in Tampa.[112] There is a Korean Baptist church,[113][114] a Mennonite church, several Haitian churches, and a Vietnamese Baptist Church.[115] Tampa has several Jewish synagogues practicing Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform.[116] There is a small Zoroastrian community present in Tampa.[117] as well as several Unitarian Universalist congregations Around the city are a handful of mosques for followers of Islam, as well as a Tibetan-style Buddhist temple, a Thai Buddhist Wat,[118] and local worship centers for the Sikh,[119] Hindu and Baháʼí Faiths. The Church of Scientology, based in nearby Clearwater, maintains a location for its members in Tampa.[120] In 2012, Tampa was 50th out of the largest 51 metropolitan areas in the percentage of the populace that attends religious services of any kind, with less than 35% of the population regularly attending services. Only the Portland, Oregon area is less observant.[121] Finance, retail, healthcare, insurance, shipping by air and sea, national defense, professional sports, tourism, and real estate all play vital roles in the area's economy.[122] Hillsborough County alone has an estimated 740,000 employees, a figure which is projected to increase to 922,000 by 2015.[122] Since the year 2000, Tampa has seen a notable upsurge in high-market demand from consumers, signaling more wealth concentrated in the area.[123] In 2021, the U.S. Department of Labor awarded a two-year grant of nearly US$3 million to a program called \"Connecting Talent to Careers\" led by the Advanced Robotics for Manufacturing Institute and Tooling U-SME to deliver a rapid re-employment program to address a shortage of skilled labor in manufacturing in the region exposed by the COVID-19 pandemic.[124] Several large corporations, such as banks and telecommunications companies, maintain regional offices in Tampa. The largest credit union in Florida, Suncoast Credit Union, is headquartered in Tampa. Several Fortune 1000 companies are headquartered in the metropolitan area,[125] including Bloomin' Brands, WellCare, Jabil, TECO Energy, and Raymond James Financial. Other companies headquartered in Tampa include Odyssey Marine Exploration, Greenway Health, College Hunks Hauling Junk, Arturo Fuente, J.C. Newman Cigar Company, Masonite International, Sykes Enterprises, Cott Corporation, Blue Rock Partners,[126] The Melting Pot, Checkers and Rally's and The Mosaic Company Downtown Tampa is undergoing significant development and redevelopment in line with a general national trend toward urban residential development. In April 2007, the Tampa Downtown Partnership noted development proceeding on 20 residential, hotel, and mixed-use projects.[128] Many of the new downtown developments were nearing completion in the midst of a housing market slump, which caused numerous projects to be delayed or revamped, and some of the 20 projects TDP lists have not broken ground and are being refinanced. Nonetheless, several developments were completed, making downtown into a 24-hour neighborhood instead of a 9 to 5 business district.[129] As of 2010[update], Tampa residents faced a decline in rent of 2%. Nationally rent had decreased 4%.[130] The Tampa Business Journal found Tampa to be the number two city for real estate investment in 2014.[131] Port Tampa Bay is now the seventh largest in the nation and Florida's largest tonnage port, handling nearly half of all seaborne commerce that passes through the state. Tampa ranks second in the state behind Miami in terms of cruise ship travel. Besides smaller regional cruise ships such as Yacht Starship and SunCruz Casino, Tampa also serves as a port of call for three cruise lines: Holland America's MS Ryndam, Royal Caribbean's Grandeur of the Seas and Radiance of the Seas, and Carnival's Inspiration and Legend.[132] MacDill Air Force Base remains a major employer as the parent installation for over 15,000 active uniformed military, Department of Defense (DoD) civil service and DoD contractor personnel in the Tampa Bay area. A significant majority of the civil service and contractor personnel are, in fact, themselves retired career military personnel. In addition to the 6th Air Mobility Wing, which is \"host wing\" for the base, MacDill is also home to Headquarters, United States Central Command (USCENTCOM), Headquarters, United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), the 927th Air Refueling Wing, Headquarters, United States Marine Forces Central Command (USMARCENT), Headquarters, United States Special Operations Command Central (USSOCCENT), and numerous other military activities of the active and reserve components of the armed forces. Tampa is home to a variety of stage and performing arts venues and theaters, including the David A.

The NFL's Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the NHL's Tampa Bay Lightning call Tampa home, while the Tampa Bay Rays of the MLB play across the bay in St. Petersburg (though they spent the 2025 season at George M. Steinbrenner Field following the damage to Tropicana Field by Hurricane Milton). As indicated by their names, these teams, plus several other sports teams, represent the entire Tampa metropolitan area. Tampa Bay's professional teams have won eight combined championships in their respective leagues. The Tampa Bay area has long been a site for Major League Baseball spring training facilities and minor league baseball teams. The New York Yankees conduct spring training in Tampa, and their Low-A affiliate Tampa Tarpons play there in the summer. On the collegiate level, the University of South Florida Bulls compete in 17 sports in NCAA Division I and the University of Tampa Spartans compete in 20 sports in NCAA Division II.[164][165] Between September 2020 and July 2021 all three of Tampa Bay's major teams, as well as the Tampa Bay Rowdies, qualified for their sport's championship series. The Lightning beat the Dallas Stars in the 2020 Stanley Cup Finals, the Rays lost to the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 2020 World Series, the Rowdies and Phoenix Rising FC were named co-league champions after the USL Championship game was canceled due to COVID-19, the Buccaneers beat the Kansas City Chiefs in the first home-game victory in Super Bowl history, and the Lightning beat the Montreal Canadiens in the 2021 Stanley Cup Finals. This dynasty earned the area the nickname \"Champa Bay\".[166][167] The Tampa Bay Buccaneers began in 1976 as an expansion team of the NFL. They struggled at first, losing their first 26 games in a row to set a league record for futility. After a brief taste of success in the late 1970s, the Bucs again returned to their losing ways, and at one point lost at least 10 games for 12 seasons in a row.[168] The hiring of Tony Dungy in 1996 started an improving trend that eventually led to the team's victory in Super Bowl XXXVII in 2003 under coach Jon Gruden. They won their second championship in Super Bowl LV with quarterback Tom Brady and became the first NFL team to ever win a Super Bowl at their home stadium. Originally the Pittsburgh Gladiators and a charter member of the Arena Football League (AFL), the Tampa Bay Storm relocated from Pittsburgh in 1991 and won ArenaBowl V that year. They later won 4 more ArenaBowls (VII, IX, X, and XVII, and also appeared in ArenaBowl I, III, XII, XXIII and XXX), and their five championships were the most in league history.[169] The AFL suffered through several years of decreasing revenue in the 2010s, leading to fewer active franchises. There were only five teams during the 2017 season, after which the Storm's ownership group suspended operations.[170] Tampa was also home to the Tampa Bay Bandits of the United States Football League. The Bandits made the playoffs twice in their three seasons under head coach Steve Spurrier and drew league-leading crowds to Tampa Stadium, but the team folded along with the rest of the USFL after the 1985 season.[171][172] They played at Tampa Stadium, which hosted the 1984 USFL Championship Game.[173] The Tampa Bay Vipers play in the second edition of the XFL. Their inaugural season was cut short after five weeks due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The team relocated to Las Vegas, Nevada, and now are the Las Vegas Vipers. The Tampa Bay Tornadoes were founded in 2020 and describe themselves as the successors to the defunct Tampa Bay Storm. They play in the American Arena League. The Tampa Bay area has long been home to nationally competitive amateur baseball and has hosted spring training and minor league teams for over a century. Tampa became the first city in Florida to host a major league team for spring training in 1913, when the Chicago Cubs trained at Plant Field. The Tampa Smokers were the city's first minor league team, beginning play as charter members of the new Florida State League in 1919. After decades of trying to lure an existing Major League Baseball franchise, the Tampa Bay area finally gained a team in 1998, when the expansion Tampa Bay Devil Rays began play at Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg. After a decade of futility on the field, the Devil Rays shortened their nickname to simply Rays in 2008 and promptly won the 2008 American League Pennant, finishing runner up in World Series. They also won American League East titles in 2008 and 2010 under manager Joe Maddon before slipping back in the standings. In 2007, the Rays began the process of searching for a stadium site closer to the center of the area's population, possibly in Tampa.[174][175] However, over a decade later, rivalry between Tampa and St. Petersburg and the challenges of financing a new ballpark have kept the Rays playing at Tropicana Field.[176] In 2020, the Rays won the AL East for the first time in a decade with the best record in the American League.[177] Due to the COVID-19 shortened season, 16 teams made the playoffs, so the Rays had to play a best of 3 series against the division rival Toronto Blue Jays in the first round of the Rays postseason, where they swept the visitors in two games at Tropicana Field.[178] then play a divisional series against the New York Yankees, which they won in 5 games at a neutral site in San Diego.[179] The Rays then faced the Astros, who had defeated them in the divisional round the previous year. Tampa Bay went out to a quick 3–0 series lead, but Houston came back to tie the series 3–3. The Rays avoided the reverse sweep in Game 7 and won their second American League Pennant, then lost the World Series in 6 games to the Los Angeles Dodgers.[180] Several Major League baseball teams conduct Spring Training in the area, and most also operate minor league teams in the Low-A Southeast. The major league New York Yankees and the affiliated minor league Tampa Tarpons use George M. Steinbrenner Field across Dale Mabry Highway from Raymond James Stadium. Across the bay in Pinellas County, the Philadelphia Phillies affiliate Clearwater Threshers and Toronto Blue Jays affiliate Dunedin Blue Jays also play in the Low-A Southeast. Other nearby Low-A Southeast teams include the Pittsburgh Pirates affiliate Bradenton Marauders and the Detroit Tigers affiliate Lakeland Flying Tigers. The Phillies, Blue Jays, Pirates, and Tigers all play their Spring Training games at their minor league teams' ballparks. The Tarpons have won five league titles, the Flying Tigers have won four, the Threshers have won two, and the Blue Jays and Marauders have each won one. The area was formerly home to many teams in the former Florida State League that no longer exist, most notably the Tampa Smokers, St. Petersburg Saints, and the original Tampa Tarpons. The NHL's Tampa Bay Lightning, named after the city's propensity for attracting lightning unlike any other on the continent, was established in 1992, and play their home games at Amalie Arena in downtown Tampa. In 2004, the team won their first Stanley Cup by defeating the Calgary Flames in 7 games. After this first championship and an ensuing season-wide lockout, the Lightning went 1–3 in four Conference Final appearances in 2011, 2015, 2016 and 2018, winning only in 2015 to lose to the Chicago Blackhawks in the ensuing Finals. Then the Lightning won back-to-back Stanley Cups in 2020 and 2021 with victories over the Dallas Stars and fellow Atlantic Division member Montreal Canadiens respectively. Tampa hosted the skills contests and 2018 NHL All-Star Game weekend on January 27–28, 2018. Former captain Steve Stamkos is the franchise's top scorer with 555 goals across sixteen seasons before signing a new contract with the Nashville Predators after the 2023–24 NHL season. The Tampa Bay Rowdies compete in the United Soccer League Championship after spending their first 6 seasons in the North American Soccer League. The team began play at Tampa's George M. Steinbrenner Field in 2010, then moved to St. Petersburg's Al Lang Field in 2011. The Rowdies won their first league championship in Soccer Bowl 2012. The Rowdies made the USL Championship Final for the first time in 2020, though it was cancelled due to COVID-19. The Rowdies and the other finalist, Phoenix Rising FC, were named co-champions by the league.[181][182] Previously, Tampa had hosted two top-level soccer teams. The Tampa Bay Rowdies of the original North American Soccer League was the area's first major sports franchise, beginning play in 1975 at Tampa Stadium. The Rowdies were an immediate success, drawing good crowds and winning Soccer Bowl '75 in their first season to bring Tampa its first professional sports championship. Though the NASL ceased operations in 1984, the Rowdies continued to compete in various soccer leagues until finally folding in 1993. The success of the Rowdies prompted Major League Soccer (MLS) to award Tampa a charter member of the new league in 1996. The Tampa Bay Mutiny were the first MLS Supporters' Shield winner and had much early success beginning in 1996. However, the club folded in 2001 when local ownership could not be secured mainly due to a financially poor lease agreement for Raymond James Stadium. The city has no representation in MLS, however, the Rowdies are seeking to join the league.[183] Tampa Bay Sun FC were founded in 2023, becoming a founding member of the USL Super League, a top-division women's soccer league. They will play at Riverfront Stadium, a newly renovated stadium on the campus of Blake High School.[184][185] The Tampa Bay area does not have a professional basketball team. The Orlando Magic are the closest NBA team to the area, 85 miles east. The Tampa Bay area had several teams in minor basketball leagues. The Tampa Bay Titans played in The Basketball League (TBL) from 2019 to 2022. Their home games were played at Pasco–Hernando State College. The St. Pete Tide and the Tampa Gunners played in the Florida Basketball Association (FBA). The Tide's home games were played at St. Petersburg Catholic High School, and the Gunners were a travel team. Amalie Arena was used as the home of the NBA's Toronto Raptors for the 2020–2021 season because of Canadian government regulations due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada.[186] It was the first time an NBA team played home games in Tampa, though some exhibition preseason games had been played in Tampa between the Orlando Magic and Miami Heat prior to this. The University of South Florida is the only NCAA Division I sports program in Tampa. USF began playing intercollegiate sports in 1965. The Bulls established a men's basketball team in 1971 and a football team in 1997 and sponsor 17 teams in total. The Bulls joined the Big East in 2005, and the football team rose to as high as #2 in the BCS rankings in 2007. They are now part of the American Athletic Conference.

                "title": "Body of water or regional identity? | Tampa Bay History Center",
                "content": "You are using an outdated browser. Please upgrade your browser to improve your experience. Tampa or Tampa Bay. The actual name of a city or an invented regional moniker? That has been a common topic for letter writers to the Tampa Tribune for the past several weeks and for the past several years throughout Tampa – or the Tampa Bay area, if you prefer. Which should we use? Which one is correct? Where did the names come from? Let’s answer the last question first. One of the most common questions asked by visitors to the History Center is, “what does the word Tampa mean?” We always have to give the unsatisfying answer, “we do not really know.” Some will say that it means “sticks of fire,” and there is an impressive sculpture in Plant Park at the University of Tampa with that name, but there is absolutely no evidence to back up this claim. The name Tampa, or Tanpa, was first officially mentioned by Europeans in 1575 when Hernando de Escalante Fontaneda wrote Memoir of Don d’Escalante Fontaneda, respecting Florida. Fontaneda was the lone survivor of a shipwreck in the late 1540s at the age of 13. He spent the next seventeen years of his life among the Calusa Indians in Southwest Florida, learning about the principal American Indian towns along Florida’s west coast, including a town called ‘Tanpa.’ No one is sure if Tanpa is geographically the same as Tampa because early map makers moved the locations of present-day Tampa Bay (the body of water) and Charlotte Harbor, eliminated one or both, or added one or more extra bays and inlets along Florida’s gulf coast. Fontaneda never documented why the village was called Tanpa, and the people who lived there have been gone for almost half a millennia. Another wrinkle in the story is that the name given to the bay by early European explorers and map makers was not Tampa Bay, but rather La Bahia de Espirito Santo, or Bay of the Holy Spirit. The bay retained that name, with a few exceptions, for over two hundred years. English map makers, beginning in the 1760s when Great Britain acquired Florida from Spain, began to Anglicize Florida place names. Espirito Santo became Tampa Bay – a name that had appeared on maps as early as 1601 (as Bahia de Tampa/Tanpa) – and a new name appeared to designate the northeast arm of the bay. Hillsborough Bay, and the river that feeds it, were named in honor of Lord Hillsborough, who at the time was Secretary of State for the British Colonies. At some point in the 19th century, another bit of fine tuning occurred to the naming of the bays. Tampa Bay (or the Bay of Tampa, as it was still sometimes referred to) was essentially split in two. The northwestern arm became known as Old Tampa Bay, perhaps a reference to the supposed location of the village of Tampa/Tanpa, with the implication being that that bay was the “original” or old Bay of Tampa. The main bay kept the name Tampa Bay, and Hillsborough Bay remained the name of the northeastern arm. Another event in the 19th century brought the name Tampa Bay to the attention of Americans. The Second Seminole War (1835-1842) was among the most costly Indian Wars fought by the US military, and Fort Brooke “at Tampa Bay” served as the headquarters for the army fighting in Florida. The fort, established in 1824, was actually located in present-day downtown Tampa on the north end of Hillsborough Bay, but even by the 1820s, Tampa Bay was being used as an identifying name for the whole area. A small village took hold on the northern edge of Fort Brooke, and on November 24, 1831, the government established a post office, effectively giving the new town a name – Tampa Bay. Three years later the post office, and town, dropped the ‘Bay’ and became known as Tampa. That same year, 1834, Tampa was named the county seat of the newly created Hillsborough County. Despite “Tampa” becoming the official name of the town (and later city), the area retained the name Tampa Bay. Numerous letters and maps from the 1840s through the 1880s referred to Tampa Bay in a general catch-all sort of way, in both a military context with the Second Seminole War and the Civil War and as a potential tourist destination. The explosive growth of Tampa in the mid-1880s coincided with the diminished use of Tampa Bay as a regional identifier. The name Tampa began to supplant other area place names, and the city even annexed two smaller cities in the 20th century (West Tampa in 1925 and Port Tampa City in 1961). The whole region experienced incredible growth following World War II, with most of that growth occurring outside of the official boundaries of the City of Tampa. While the city annexed a large amount of unincorporated territory on the Interbay Peninsula in 1956, expansive growth in eastern and northern Hillsborough County and throughout Pinellas County meant that Tampa was no longer the only important place in the area. The region needed a new identity, and an old name returned. Tampa Bay was reborn. Though Tampa Bay as a descriptor of the whole area came back in vogue in the 1950s, it wasn’t until the arrival of professional sports franchises that the name really began to stick. Interestingly, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers were not the first professional sports franchise in the area. That distinction goes to the Tampa Bay Rowdies, who played their first soccer game at Tampa Stadium in 1975. The Bucs took the field the following year, and the name Tampa Bay spread throughout sports pages across the country. That, more than anything else, has engrained the name Tampa Bay into the national lexicon. An interesting side effect of this area identity is that many people outside of the region think that the Tampa Bay Rays play in Tampa. Efforts to make this misconception a reality notwithstanding, St. Petersburg leaders are understandably irritated by the mistaken identity and have gone to great lengths to establish the Rays as St. Petersburg’s team. So where do we go from here? If you were born in Tampa, be proud to say so. If you moved to Tampa from someplace else, tell people you live in Tampa. However, do not be so quick to correct someone who talks about Tampa Bay as anything other than a body of water. Lots of people from our past would know exactly what and where they are talking about.

                "content": "38; see text. Falcons (/ˈfɒlkən, ˈfɔːl-, ˈfæl-/) are birds of prey in the genus Falco, which includes about 40 species. Some small species of falcons with long, narrow wings are called hobbies,[7] and some that hover while hunting are called kestrels.[7][8] Falcons are widely distributed on all continents of the world except Antarctica, though closely related raptors did occur there in the Eocene.[9] Adult falcons have thin, tapered wings, which enable them to fly at high speed and change direction rapidly. Fledgling falcons, in their first year of flying, have longer flight feathers, which make their configuration more like that of a general-purpose bird such as a broadwing. This makes flying easier while still learning the aerial skills required to be effective hunters like the adults. The falcons are the largest genus in the Falconinae subfamily of Falconidae, which also includes two other subfamilies comprising caracaras and a few other species of \"falcons\". All these birds kill prey with their beaks, using a tomial \"tooth\" on the side of their beaks — unlike the hawks, eagles and other larger birds of prey from the unrelated family Accipitridae, who use talons on their feet. The largest falcon is the gyrfalcon at up to 65 cm (26 in) in length. The smallest falcon species is the pygmy falcon, which measures just 20 cm (7.9 in). As with hawks and owls, falcons exhibit sexual dimorphism, with the females typically larger than the males, thus allowing a wider range of prey species.[10] As is the case with many birds of prey, falcons have exceptional powers of vision; the visual acuity of one species has been measured at 2.6 times that of human eyes.[11] They are incredibly fast fliers, with the Peregrine falcons having been recorded diving at speeds of 320 km/h (200 mph), making them the fastest-moving creatures on Earth; the fastest recorded dive attained a vertical speed of 390 km/h (240 mph).[12] The genus Falco was introduced in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his Systema Naturae.[13] The type species is the merlin (Falco columbarius).[14] The genus name Falco is Late Latin meaning a \"falcon\" from falx, falcis, meaning \"a sickle\", referring to the claws of the bird.[15][16] In Middle English and Old French, the title faucon refers generically to several captive raptor species.[17] The traditional term for a male falcon is tercel (British spelling) or tiercel (American spelling), from the Latin tertius (third) because of the belief that only one in three eggs hatched a male bird. Some sources give the etymology as deriving from the fact that a male falcon is about one-third smaller than a female[18][19][20] (Old French: tiercelet). A falcon chick, especially one reared for falconry, still in its downy stage, is known as an eyas[21][22] (sometimes spelled eyass). The word arose by mistaken division of Old French un niais, from Latin presumed nidiscus (nestling) from nidus (nest). The technique of hunting with trained captive birds of prey is known as falconry. Compared to other birds of prey, the fossil record of the falcons is not well distributed in time. For years, the oldest fossils tentatively assigned to this genus were from the Late Miocene, less than 10 million years ago.[23] This coincides with a period in which many modern genera of birds became recognizable in the fossil record. As of 2021, the oldest falconid fossil is estimated to be 55 million years old.[24][25] Given the distribution of fossil and living Falco taxa, falcons are probably of North American, African, or possibly Middle Eastern or European origin. Falcons are not closely related to other birds of prey, and their nearest relatives are parrots and songbirds.[26] Falcons are roughly divisible into three or four groups. The first contains the kestrels (probably excepting the American kestrel);[17] usually small and stocky falcons of mainly brown upperside colour and sometimes sexually dimorphic; three African species that are generally gray in colour stand apart from the typical members of this group. The fox and greater kestrels can be told apart at first glance by their tail colours, but not by much else; they might be very close relatives and are probably much closer to each other than the lesser and common kestrels. Kestrels feed chiefly on terrestrial vertebrates and invertebrates of appropriate size, such as rodents, reptiles, or insects. The second group contains slightly larger (on average) species, the hobbies and relatives. These birds are characterized by considerable amounts of dark slate-gray in their plumage; their malar areas are nearly always black. They feed mainly on smaller birds. Third are the peregrine falcon and its relatives, variably sized powerful birds that also have a black malar area (except some very light color morphs), and often a black cap, as well. They are very fast birds with a maximum speed of 390 kilometres per hour. Otherwise, they are somewhat intermediate between the other groups, being chiefly medium grey with some lighter or brownish colours on their upper sides. They are, on average, more delicately patterned than the hobbies and, if the hierofalcons are excluded (see below), this group typically contains species with horizontal barring on their undersides. As opposed to the other groups, where tail colour varies much in general but little according to evolutionary relatedness,[note 1] the tails of the large falcons are quite uniformly dark grey with inconspicuous black banding and small, white tips, though this is probably plesiomorphic. These large Falco species feed on mid-sized birds and terrestrial vertebrates. Very similar to these, and sometimes included therein, are the four or so species of hierofalcon (literally, \"hawk-falcons\"). They represent taxa with, usually, more phaeomelanins, which impart reddish or brown colors, and generally more strongly patterned plumage reminiscent of hawks. Their undersides have a lengthwise pattern of blotches, lines, or arrowhead marks. While these three or four groups, loosely circumscribed, are an informal arrangement, they probably contain several distinct clades in their entirety. A study of mtDNA cytochrome b sequence data of some kestrels[17] identified a clade containing the common kestrel and related \"malar-striped\" species, to the exclusion of such taxa as the greater kestrel (which lacks a malar stripe), the lesser kestrel (which is very similar to the common, but also has no malar stripe), and the American kestrel, which has a malar stripe, but its colour pattern – apart from the brownish back – and also the black feathers behind the ear, which never occur in the true kestrels, are more reminiscent of some hobbies. The malar-striped kestrels apparently split from their relatives in the Gelasian, roughly 2.0–2.5 million years ago (Mya), and are seemingly of tropical East African origin. The entire \"true kestrel\" group—excluding the American species—is probably a distinct and quite young clade, as also suggested by their numerous apomorphies. Other studies[27][28][29][30][31] have confirmed that the hierofalcon are a monophyletic group–and that hybridization is quite frequent at least in the larger falcon species. Initial studies of mtDNA cytochrome b sequence data suggested that the hierofalcon are basal among living falcons.[27][28] The discovery of a NUMT proved this earlier theory erroneous.[29] In reality, the hierofalcon are a rather young group, originating at the same time as the start of the main kestrel radiation, about 2 Mya. Very little fossil history exists for this lineage. However, the present diversity of very recent origin suggests that this lineage may have nearly gone extinct in the recent past.[31][32] The phylogeny and delimitations of the peregrine and hobby groups are more problematic. Molecular studies have only been conducted on a few species, and the morphologically ambiguous taxa have often been little researched. The morphology of the syrinx, which contributes well to resolving the overall phylogeny of the Falconidae,[33][34] is not very informative in the present genus. Nonetheless, a core group containing the peregrine and Barbary falcons, which, in turn, group with the hierofalcon and the more distant prairie falcon (which was sometimes placed with the hierofalcon, though it is entirely distinct biogeographically), as well as at least most of the \"typical\" hobbies, are confirmed to be monophyletic as suspected.[27][28] Given that the American Falco species of today belong to the peregrine group, or are apparently more basal species, the initially most successful evolutionary radiation seemingly was a Holarctic one that originated possibly around central Eurasia or in (northern) Africa. One or several lineages were present in North America by the Early Pliocene at latest. The origin of today's major Falco groups—the \"typical\" hobbies and kestrels, for example, or the peregrine-hierofalcon complex, or the aplomado falcon lineage—can be quite confidently placed from the Miocene-Pliocene boundary through the Zanclean and Piacenzian and just into the Gelasian, that is from 2.4 to 5.3 Mya, when the malar-striped kestrels diversified. Some groups of falcons, such as the hierofalcon complex and the peregrine-Barbary superspecies, have only evolved in more recent times; the species of the former seem to be 120,000 years old or so.[31] The sequence follows the taxonomic order of White et al. (1996),[35] except for adjustments in the kestrel sequence. Several more paleosubspecies of extant species also been described; see species accounts for these. \"Sushkinia\" pliocaena from the Early Pliocene of Pavlodar (Kazakhstan) appears to be a falcon of some sort. It might belong in this genus or a closely related one.[36] In any case, the genus name Sushkinia is invalid for this animal because it had already been allocated to a prehistoric dragonfly relative. In 2015 the bird genus was renamed Psushkinia.[44] The supposed \"Falco\" pisanus was actually a pigeon of the genus Columba, possibly the same as Columba omnisanctorum, which, in that case, would adopt the older species name of the \"falcon\".[37] The Eocene fossil \"Falco\" falconellus (or \"F.\" falconella) from Wyoming is a bird of uncertain affiliations, maybe a falconid, maybe not; it certainly does not belong in this genus. \"Falco\" readei is now considered a paleosubspecies of the yellow-headed caracara (Milvago chimachima).",

                "title": "Game Recap: Rams fall to Seattle Seahawks 30-25",
                "content": "Senior Staff Writer INGLEWOOD, Calif. – The Rams (10-7) fell to the Seahawks 30-25 on Sunday at SoFi Stadium. The loss means Los Angeles will be the No. 4 seed in the NFC and host the loser of Lions-Vikings next weekend in the Wild Card round of the playoffs. Down five with 3:19 remaining in the fourth quarter, Los Angeles marched to the Seattle 9-yard line to face a 4th-and-3 with 21 seconds left, but quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo's pass intended for wide receiver Jordan Whittington was incomplete. Kicker Joshua Karty set the franchise rookie kicker scoring record with his made extra point attempt and four made field goals. He also tied Frank Corral (29) for the most made field goals by a rookie kicker in franchise history. Starting for Matthew Stafford – who was one of several offensive starters resting – Garoppolo completed 27 of 41 pass attempts for 334 yards with two touchdowns against one interception in the loss. Here is the complete game recap, presented by Quidel: Seattle took an early lead on a 4-yard touchdown pass from Smith to wide receiver Jake Bobo with 5:21 left in the first quarter. The Rams added a 37-yard field goal by Karty to cut their deficit to four late in the first quarter. The Seahawks extended their lead to 14-3 on a 20-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Geno Smith to wide receiver DK Metcalf, but the Rams responded with a 6-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo to tight end Tyler Higbee to again cut their deficit to four midway through the second quarter. After kicker Jason Myers connected on a 56-yard field goal to put Seattle up 17-10 with 3:21 left in the first half, Los Angeles answered with a 43-yard kickoff return by Whittington. The prime field position went away three plays later after Garoppolo's pass intended for wide receiver Tyler Johnson was intercepted by Seahawks safety Julian Love, though the Seahawks didn't come away with points on the possession. Karty drilled a career-long 58-yard field goal at the end of the first half for a 17-13 halftime deficit. A 57-yarder midway through the third quarter reduced the Rams' deficit to just one. The Seahawks responded with a 4-yard touchdown pass from Smith to tight end A.J. Barner, then the Rams countered with a 4-yard touchdown pass from Garoppolo to wide receiver Tyler Johnson, but the ensuing 2-point attempt was unsuccessful, leaving the Rams trailing by two early in the fourth quarter. Karty's 38-yard field goal put the Rams ahead 25-24 for their first lead of the game with 7:29 to play, but Seattle regained the lead 30-25 on a 16-yard touchdown pass from Smith to tight end Noah Fant on the following drive. The ensuing 2-point attempt failed, leaving the Rams with a five-point deficit with 3:19 remaining. L.A.'s last-gasp drive was kept alive by a 7-yard fourth down completion from Garoppolo to Higbee and reached Seattle's 9-yard line, but the unsuccessful fourth-down attempt ended it.

The Los Angeles Rams have already won the NFC West and clinched a postseason berth, but they could improve their seeding in their Week 18 matchup with the Seattle Seahawks. The Rams (10-6) can clinch the No. 3 seed with a win, while a loss, plus results from other games, could push them to the 4-seed. As for the Seahawks (9-7), they were eliminated from postseason contention last week but could still achieve their first double-digit win season since 2020. Los Angeles prevailed on the road, 26-20, in Week 9, and the Rams have won the last three matchups. Matthew Stafford, Cooper Kupp, Puka Nacua and Kyren Williams are among the Los Angeles starters who will be held out (rest). Kickoff is set for 4:25 p.m. ET from SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, Calif. Seattle is favored by 7.5 points in the latest Seahawks vs. Rams odds, while the over/under is 38.5 points per SportsLine consensus. Before entering any Rams vs. Seahawks picks, you'll want to see the NFL predictions from the model at SportsLine. The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model enters Week 18 of the 2024 NFL season on an incredible 30-14 betting hot streak on top-rated NFL picks this year -- a stunning 68% success rate. Longer term, it is on a 210-142 roll on top-rated NFL picks that dates back to the 2017 season and a 64-35 roll on top-rated NFL picks since Week 7 of 2022. The model also ranked in the top 10 on NFLPickWatch four of the past six years on straight-up NFL picks and beat more than 94% of CBS Sports Football Pick'em players four times during that span. Anyone following at sportsbooks and on betting apps has seen strong returns. The model has set its sights on Seahawks vs. Rams. You can head to SportsLine to see its picks. Here are several NFL betting lines for Rams vs. Seahawks: The Rams have been playing as well as anyone over the last few months, going 9-2 over their last 11 games. Winning the turnover battle has been essential during this run, with Los Angeles boasting a plus-nine mark over this stretch. That strength should capitalize on a Seattle weakness as just five teams have more giveaways than the Seahawks' 24 this season. The Rams also don't hurt themselves as they've committed the fewest penalties of any team this season. Sean McVay's side also has a huge advantage with both recent history and with the spread. L.A. has outright won six of its last eight matchups with Seattle, while covering in seven of those eight meetings. Additionally, the Seahawks enter Sunday's game with three straight ATS defeats in the 2024 NFL season, while the Rams have covered in four of their last five. See which team to pick here. Seattle has played much better away from Lumen Field this season as its 6-1 road record is the second-best in the NFL. The team is also averaging 24 points on the road, compared to 19.3 at home, and its offensive potential may be too much for the Rams to contend with. Los Angeles has failed to reach 20 points in each of its last three games, averaging only 14.7 points over this stretch, despite all three opponents being teams currently under .500. Geno Smith ranks in the top five in both passing yards and completion percentage, and he has dangerous wideouts at his disposal. Jaxon Smith-Njigba is showing why he was a first-round pick as he's closing in on 100 catches and has over 1,100 receiving yards. Meanwhile, DK Metcalf is closing in on 1,000 yards himself and has a history of success versus the Rams, with seven touchdowns over his last seven games against them. Finally, veteran Tyler Lockett could be playing in his final game as a Seahawk and would want to put out an impressive showing, just as he did in Week 9 versus L.A. when he had 63 yards and a score. See which team to pick here. The model has simulated Seahawks vs. Rams 10,000 times and the results are in.

                "content": "Tyreek Hill (born March 1, 1994) is an American professional football wide receiver for the Miami Dolphins of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at Garden City, Oklahoma State, and West Alabama before being drafted by the Kansas City Chiefs in the fifth round of the 2016 NFL draft. A former track and field star, Hill played primarily as a return specialist as a rookie, but has transitioned to strictly playing wide receiver. Following his rookie year, he received the nickname \"Cheetah\" in reference to his speed.[1] He has been selected to the Pro Bowl in each of his eight seasons in the league, won Super Bowl LIV with the Chiefs, and was named to the NFL 2010s All-Decade Team as a punt returner. Hill was born on March 1, 1994, and is the son of Anesha Sanchez and Derrick Shaw.[2] A native of Douglas, Georgia, Hill attended Coffee High School, where he won both the 100 meters and 200 meters at the 2012 Georgia 5A state meet.[3][4] On May 26, 2012, at the 36th Golden South Classic in Orlando, Florida, Hill ran a new season-best in the 100 m (10.19 s) and a personal record in the 200 m (20.14 s).[5] His time in the 200 m missed Roy Martin's 1985 national high school record by only one hundredth of a second. Hill's mark was the fastest time by a junior athlete in the 2012 season and the fastest by a junior athlete since Ramil Guliyev's 20.04 s in 2009. His time in the 100 m ties Abraham Hall for second fastest by a junior in the 2012 season, behind only Adam Gemili. He was Track and Field News \"High School Athlete of the Year\" in 2012.[6] Hill ran a wind-assisted (+5.0 m/s) 9.98 s in the 100-meter dash at the 2013 Hutchinson NJCCA Championships.[7][8] Hill was a USA Today All-American track and field selection in 2012.[9] At Garden City Community College in Garden City, Kansas, Hill ran track and played football. As a sophomore in 2013, Hill ran for 659 rushing yards and five touchdowns while catching 67 passes for 532 receiving yards for the Broncbusters football team.[10] Coming out of Garden City Community College, Hill was a highly sought-after junior college recruit and chose to attend Oklahoma State University in Stillwater, Oklahoma.[11] On August 30, 2014, Hill made his debut for the Cowboys and caught a season-high six passes for 62 receiving yards in a loss to the Florida State Seminoles.[12] On September 25, 2014, he caught his first career touchdown against the Texas Tech Red Raiders and finished the victory with three receptions for 50 yards, six rushing attempts for 39-yards, and three kick returns for a total of 62 yards.[13] In the following game against the Iowa State Cyclones, Hill finished with a season-high 148 kick return yards on five attempts and returned his first kick return for a touchdown of the season.[14] On November 1, 2014, he gained a season-high 102 rushing yards on 18 attempts and scored his first rushing touchdown of the season against the Kansas State Wildcats.[15] On December 6, 2014, he appeared in his last game as a part of Oklahoma State's football team and helped them win a comeback victory over their rival Oklahoma Sooners after he returned a punt for a 92-yard touchdown.[16][17] On December 11, 2014, Oklahoma State dismissed Hill from their football and track teams following his arrest and guilty plea for domestic violence.[16] In his only season at Oklahoma State, Hill had a total of 102 rushing attempts for 534 rushing yards and a touchdown, 31 receptions for 381 receiving yards and a touchdown, 30 kick returns for 740 return yards and two touchdowns, and 27 punt returns for 256 punt return yards and a touchdown. As a running back, wide receiver, and returner, he accounted for 1,911 all-purpose yards and five touchdowns. His 996 combined return yards ranked second in the nation. He was ranked 11th nationally in all-purpose yards.[18][19] On September 1, 2015, the University of West Alabama in Livingston, Alabama, announced that Hill enrolled and would play football for the Tigers.[20] West Alabama head coach Brett Gilliland said he initially turned down Hill after he read the police report, alleging that Hill choked and hit his girlfriend. But after getting to know Hill personally, he spoke to people at Oklahoma State, Hill's former coaches at Garden City Community College, and a high school mentor, and was swayed to accept him after reading his plea agreement, which required that Hill either attend school full-time or be employed.[21] On the field, Hill was utilized widely as a running back (25 carries for 237 yards and one touchdown), wide receiver (27 receptions for 444 yards and a touchdown), punt returner (20 returns averaging 10.7 yards with two touchdowns), and kick returner (also 20 returns averaging 23.0 yards with two touchdowns). In his 11 games for the team, he never exceeded 100 yards rushing or receiving and averaged 135 all-purpose yards until a 307-all-purpose-yard game against Delta State in Game 8. After this, his production tapered off quickly to a season-ending −3 all-purpose-yards against the North Alabama Lions.[22] Hill was projected to go undrafted during the 2016 NFL draft, predominantly due to his domestic violence arrest. He was not invited to the NFL Combine, but was able to showcase his abilities at West Alabama's Pro Day. Scouts were impressed with his speed and his Pro Day workout.[23] His head coach at West Alabama said that at least 20 NFL teams were interested in Hill.[24] In the 2016 NFL Draft, Hill was selected by the Kansas City Chiefs in the fifth round (165th overall).[25] He was the first player from West Alabama to be drafted since 1974, when Ken Hutcherson was drafted 97th overall by the Dallas Cowboys.[21] The Chiefs were criticized by fans[26] for the selection due to his past issues with domestic violence and the Chiefs' history with former linebacker Jovan Belcher. General manager John Dorsey had to receive consent from Chiefs' owner Clark Hunt to make the selection and says they thoroughly vetted Hill, which included speaking to the prosecutor that charged him. After drafting him, the Chiefs held a press conference and addressed the issue to the media during the first day of rookie minicamp.[27] On May 17, 2016, the Chiefs signed Hill to a four-year, $2.58 million contract that included $100,000 guaranteed and a signing bonus of $70,000.[28] Hill began the 2016 season as the Chiefs' starting punt returner, kick returner, and fourth wide receiver on the depth chart behind veterans Jeremy Maclin, Chris Conley, and Albert Wilson.[29] In the Chiefs' season opener, he made his first NFL catch for a nine-yard touchdown pass from Alex Smith as the Chiefs came back from down 21–3 to defeat the San Diego Chargers 33–27 in overtime.[30] During Week 8, Hill caught five passes for a season-high 98 yards and a touchdown during a 30–14 road victory over the Indianapolis Colts.[31] Two weeks later, he had a season-high ten catches for 89 yards, helping the Chiefs come back from a 17–0 deficit and defeat the Carolina Panthers by a score of 20–17.[32] During a Week 12 30–27 overtime road victory against the Denver Broncos, Hill returned a kickoff for an 86-yard touchdown, ran for a three-yard touchdown, and caught a three-yard touchdown pass with less than five seconds left in the fourth quarter. He was the first player with a kick return for a touchdown, rushing touchdown, and receiving touchdown in a single game since Gale Sayers did so for the Chicago Bears in 1965.[33][34] During his return, he reached a speed of 22.77 miles per hour (36.64 km/h), the fastest speed any NFL player had reached that season.[35] His performance earned him American Football Conference (AFC) Offensive Player of the Week.[36] In Week 14, Hill returned a punt against the Oakland Raiders for a 78-yard touchdown and caught six receptions for 66 yards and scored on a 36-yard touchdown reception, helping the Chiefs win 21–13 on Thursday Night Football and move to first place in the AFC West.[37] He was named AFC Special Teams Player of the Week for his performance in Week 14.[38] Two weeks later against the Broncos, Hill had a season-high six carries for 95 rushing yards and scored a 70-yard rushing touchdown in a 33–10 victory. In the regular-season finale, he caught five passes for 46 receiving yards, had three carries for 15 rushing yards, and a 95-yard punt return for a touchdown in a 37–27 win over the Chargers. His performance against the Chargers earned him his second AFC Special Teams Player of the Week honor.[39][40] Hill finished his rookie season with 61 receptions for 593 receiving yards and six touchdowns, 24 carries for 267 rushing yards and three rushing touchdowns, 14 kick returns for a total of 384 yards and a touchdown, and 39 punt returns for 592 yards and two touchdowns.[41] His punt return yards, touchdowns, and 15.2 yards per return average all ranked first in the NFL. He also appeared in all 16 games, had one start, and made seven combined tackles.[32] He was named to the 2017 Pro Bowl as a return specialist.[42] On January 6, 2017, Hill was named First-team All-Pro as a punt returner.[43] He was named to the NFL All-Rookie Team for the 2016 season.[44] Hill was ranked 36th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2017.[45] On September 7, 2017, in the season opening game against the defending Super Bowl champion, the New England Patriots, Hill finished with a career-high 133 receiving yards on seven receptions, which included a 75-yard reception for a touchdown, as the Chiefs won on the road by a score of 42–27.[46] In Week 5, against the Houston Texans, he recorded an 82-yard punt return touchdown in the fourth quarter.[47] During Week 8 against the Broncos on Monday Night Football, Hill threw the first interception of the Chiefs' season on a failed trick play.[48] In the next game against the Cowboys, he scored a 56-yard touchdown pass from Alex Smith on an unconventional end-of-half play. The Chiefs lined up like they were going to try a Hail Mary and Smith threw an underneath check-down pass to Hill who had a convoy of blockers clear enough space for him to maneuvere to the end zone for the touchdown.[49][50] During Week 13 against the New York Jets, Hill had 185 receiving yards on six receptions and two touchdowns, which included a 79-yard touchdown, but the Chiefs lost on the road by a score of 31–38.[51] On December 19, 2017, Hill was named to his second Pro Bowl as a return specialist.[52] Hill finished his second professional season with 75 receptions for 1,183 yards and seven touchdowns. In addition, he had 25 punt returns for 204 net yards and a return touchdown.[53] The Chiefs finished the 2017 season atop the AFC West with a 10–6 record and made the playoffs.[54] In the narrow 22–21 loss to the Tennessee Titans in the Wild Card Round, Hill finished with seven receptions for 87 yards and a 14-yard rush.[55] He was selected to his second straight Pro Bowl as a return specialist for the AFC.[56] Hill was ranked 40th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2018.[57] During Week 1 against the Los Angeles Chargers, Hill returned his first touch, a punt return, 91 yards for a touchdown. He also had 7 receptions for 169 yards and two touchdowns as the Chiefs won 38–28. In the game, he hauled in a 58-yard touchdown pass, his 13th-career touchdown of over 50 yards and Patrick Mahomes's first career touchdown pass. For the second time in his NFL career, he recorded three touchdowns in a single game.[58][59] In the next game, he caught five passes for 90 yards and another touchdown against the Pittsburgh Steelers.[60] After three less-impressive games, Hill again recorded three receiving touchdowns on seven receptions for 142 yards against the Patriots during a Week 6 43–40 road loss.[61] Four weeks later, Hill had his third 100-yard receiving game, with seven receptions for 117 yards and two touchdowns, along with a 20-yard rush, in a Week 10 victory over the Arizona Cardinals.[62] In the next game on Monday Night Football, Hill recorded 10 catches for a career-high 215 yards (and the most by any NFL receiver at that point in the season) and two touchdowns in a 54–51 road loss to the Los Angeles Rams.[63] Hill finished the season with a career-high 87 receptions for 1,479 yards and 12 touchdowns.[64] He finished second on the team in receptions behind Travis Kelce and led the team in receiving yards and touchdowns.[65] He also finished fourth in the league in receiving yards and touchdowns, and led the league in 20+ and 40+ yard receptions. He was named to his third straight Pro Bowl and was named first-team All-Pro in the \"flex\" position and second-team All-Pro as a wide receiver.[66] In the Divisional Round against the Colts, he had eight receptions for 72 receiving yards to go along with a 36-yard rushing touchdown in the 31–13 victory.[67] In the AFC Championship, he had a single reception for 42 yards in the 37–31 overtime loss to the Patriots.[68] He was ranked 19th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2019.[69] On April 26, 2019, Chiefs general manager Brett Veach announced that Hill was suspended from team activities as a result of the ongoing child abuse investigation.[70] The NFL announced on July 19 that he will not be disciplined for the investigation because the league felt he did not violate the personal conduct policy.[71] On September 6, 2019, Hill signed a three-year, $54 million extension.[72] In the season opener against the Jacksonville Jaguars, Hill injured his shoulder. He was taken to the hospital as a precaution. Later in the day, it was revealed he had a posteriorly dislocated sternoclavicular joint and would \"miss some time\".[73][74] Hill made his return from injury during Week 6 against the Texans. In the game, he caught five passes for 80 yards and two touchdowns in the 31–24 loss.[75] In the next game against the Broncos, Hill finished with 74 receiving yards, including a 57-yard touchdown as the Chiefs won on the road by a score of 30–6.[76] Six days later, he was fined $10,527 for flashing his signature peace sign as he jogged in for the touchdown in the previous game.[77] During Week 9 against the Minnesota Vikings, Hill caught six passes for 140 yards and a touchdown in a narrow 26–23 victory. This was Hill's first game of the season with at least 100 receiving yards.[78] In the next game against the Titans, Hill finished with 11 catches for 157 yards and a touchdown as the Chiefs lost on the road by a score of 32–35.[79] Overall, Hill finished the 2019 season with 58 receptions for 860 receiving yards and seven receiving touchdowns.[80] He earned a fourth career nomination to the Pro Bowl following the 2019 season.[81] The Chiefs finished with a 12–4 record, won the AFC West, and earned a first-round bye.[82] In the Divisional Round against the Texans, he had three receptions for 41 receiving yards in the 51–31 victory.[83] In the AFC Championship against the Titans, Hill caught five passes for 67 yards and two touchdowns during the 35–24 win.[84] Two weeks later in Super Bowl LIV against the San Francisco 49ers, Hill caught nine passes for 105 yards, including a 44-yard catch on 3rd and 15 that sparked the Chiefs comeback en route to the 31–20 victory.[85] He was ranked 22nd by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2020.[86] Hill started the 2020 season with four consecutive games recording a receiving touchdown.[87] In Week 12 against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Hill finished the game with 13 catches for a career-high 269 yards and three touchdowns during the 27–24 victory.[88][89] He became the first player since Lee Evans in 2006 to record at least 200 receiving yards in a single quarter.[90] Hill was named the AFC Offensive Player of the Week for his performance in Week 12.[91] Hill finished the 2020 season with 87 receptions for 1,276 receiving yards and 15 receiving touchdowns to go along with two rushing touchdowns.[92] He earned a fifth career nomination to the Pro Bowl and was named as a First-team All-Pro for the third time.[93][94] He was ranked 15th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2021.[95] In the divisional round of the playoffs against the Cleveland Browns, Hill recorded eight catches for 110 yards, including a five-yard catch on 4th and 1 late in the fourth quarter to secure a 22–17 win for the Chiefs.[96] In the Chiefs 38–24 victory in the AFC Championship over the Buffalo Bills, Hill recorded nine catches for 172 yards, including a 71-yard reception.[97] He recorded seven catches for 73 yards in the Chiefs 31–9 loss in Super Bowl LV against the Buccaneers.[98] He was ranked 15th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2021.[99] Hill started the 2021 season strong with 11 receptions for 197 yards and a touchdown in the 33–29 victory over the Browns.[100] In Week 4, a 42–30 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles, he had 11 receptions for 186 receiving yards and three touchdowns.[101] He added a third-game with double-digit receptions with 12 for 94 yards and a touchdown against the New York Giants in Week 8.[102] In Week 15, against the Chargers, he had 12 receptions for 148 yards and a touchdown, his fourth game in the 2021 season with at least 11 receptions.[103] Hill was put on the Reserve/COVID-19 list on December 21, 2021.[104] He was activated on December 25, 2021.[105] In the Chiefs Week 17 game against the Cincinnati Bengals, he broke the Chiefs franchise record for receptions in a season, which was broken the previous year by his teammate Travis Kelce.[106] He finished the 2021 season with 111 receptions for 1,239 receiving yards and nine receiving touchdowns.[107] He earned a sixth consecutive nomination to the Pro Bowl.[108] In the Wild Card Round of the playoffs, Hill had 5 receptions for 57 yards and a touchdown in the 42–21 victory over the Steelers.[109] In the Divisional Round against the Bills, he had 11 receptions for 150 yards and a touchdown along with a 45-yard punt return in the 42–36 overtime win.

This would be the couple's first child together.[156] In March 2023, Hill's son with Camille Valmon was born.[157] On January 3, 2024, Hill's residence in Southwest Ranches, Florida caught fire. Firefighters took approximately 45 minutes to extinguish the blaze.[158] An investigation revealed that a child inside the estate was playing with a cigarette lighter, which triggered the blaze.[159] On December 12, 2014, Hill was arrested in Stillwater, Oklahoma on complaints of assault of his 20-year-old pregnant girlfriend, Crystal Espinal. The police report states that the two got into an argument and he threw her around \"like a ragdoll\", punched her in the face, sat on her and repeatedly punched her in the stomach, and choked her.[160] Oklahoma State dismissed him from the football team after the charges.[161] Hill eventually pleaded guilty to domestic assault and battery by strangulation and was sentenced to three years of probation, an anger-management course, a year-long batterer's program, and was required to undergo a domestic-abuse evaluation, a sentence that Espinal was consulted about and said she was comfortable with.[27][162] Espinal eventually gave birth to a boy.[24][163] In March 2019, Hill was investigated for alleged battery after an incident in which his 3-year-old son sustained a broken arm.[164] The following month, his son was placed into care of child services temporarily as a result of an emergency hearing conducted by the Kansas Department of Children and Families.[165] On April 24, Johnson County District Attorney Steve Howe released a statement, saying that his office believed a crime had been committed but the evidence did not allow them to determine the perpetrator, and that the Kansas Department of Children and Families continued to investigate.[165] The following day, an audio recording of Hill and Espinal discussing the injury to their son and the subsequent investigation was released.[165] In the recording that surfaced, Hill and his fiancée discuss their son's broken arm; she says that their son is scared of him, to which Hill responds, \"You should be afraid of me too, bitch.\"[166] As a result, the criminal investigation into Hill was re-opened.[167] On June 7, prosecutors announced the case against Hill was inactive.[168] On June 10, reports surfaced that medical investigations showed his son's arm was broken by accident and in a way that indicated it was broken bracing for a fall.[169] On July 9, 2019, the full unedited audio from the recording was released. In the full audio, Hill accuses Espinal of lying about the domestic violence accusations in 2014 and about Hill breaking their son's arm.[170] The NFL stated they have always had the full audio of the recording.[171] On July 19, 2019, the NFL released a statement saying that Hill will not be suspended and that they found no evidence that Hill violated the personal conduct policy, but the incident will be re-examined if new evidence emerges.[172] On June 18, 2023, the Miami-Dade Police Department announced they were investigating Hill for allegedly assaulting a male employee of the Haulover Marine Center following the two having a verbal disagreement.[173] Later that same month, representatives for both Hill and the Haulover Marine Center employee announced a settlement had been reached.[174] In August 2023, the NFL announced that they would not be punishing Hill for the assault incident.[175] In December 2023, it was announced that two separate paternity lawsuits for child support were filed against Hill by Brittany Lackner and Kimberly Kaylee Baker, both gave birth to Hill's alleged children in 2023.[176] In February 2024, Hill reached a confidential settlement with Lackner and confirmed he was the father of her son.[177] In July 2024, a Broward County judge ruled that Hill was in fact the father of Baker's daughter Trae Love Hill. It has been reported that Hill could possibly be the father of at least ten children with four different women.[178] On February 23, 2024, model and influencer Sophie Hall filed a civil lawsuit against Hill, alleging that he had broken her leg during a football lesson at his house the previous June when he invited her to run offensive line drills against him. The suit said she held her own on a couple of plays, frustrating him, before one hard play caused the fracture.[179][180] Hill's lawyer disputed her account and said her injury resulted from her falling over a dog that interrupted one of the plays.[181] On September 8, 2024, hours before the Miami Dolphins were set to begin their season opener against the Jacksonville Jaguars, Hill was pulled over by officers outside of the Dolphins stadium while he was on his way to the game. Video, which was filmed by fans, was uploaded to social media and instantly made national news. The video showed Hill being detained in handcuffs and forced to the ground by three officers who were on top of him holding him down. Following the game Hill said that he was accused of speeding and reckless driving and had no idea why the situation escalated like it did. \"I wasn't disrespectful because my mom didn't raise me that way. Didn't cuss. Didn't do none of that. So like I said, I'm still trying to figure it out, man.\" Steadman Stahl, president of the South Florida Police Benevolent Association, said Hill wasn't being cooperative and that he was \"redirected\" to the ground after refusing to sit when he was briefly detained. Julius B. Collins, Hill's attorney, said that the traffic stop escalated when Hill gave officers his license and rolled his window back up. \"One of the officers then knocked on Mr. Hill's driver side window and advised Mr. Hill to keep his window rolled down otherwise he was going to get him out of the car\" and that officers followed policy in handcuffing Hill. \"Mr. Hill was not immediately cooperative with the officers on the scene who, pursuant to policy and for their immediate safety, placed Mr. Hill in handcuffs. Mr. Hill, still uncooperative, refused to sit on the ground and was therefore redirected to the ground. Once the situation was sorted out within a few minutes, Mr. Hill was issued two traffic citations and was free to leave” Stahl said. Hill's teammate, Calais Campbell, who was also on his way to the game, stopped and got involved in an attempt to de-escalate the situation. Campbell got out of his car with his hands up above his head and approached the scene, informing officers that he was a friend of Hill's. He remained at the scene to \"support\" Hill after he said officers asked him to leave. Police later placed him in handcuffs for \"disobeying a direct order\" by being too close. \"They were trying to yank him down to the ground. I saw them kick him and pull him down ... I feel like one officer was pushing on his head\" Campbell said to ESPN. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis discussed the incident saying \"I was pleased to see he did well in the game and it was good for the team, what happened on the field. I have confidence in agencies throughout this state that they want to uphold the highest standards of professionalism and if for some reason that wasn't followed here I know they will make that clear. But I'll let that investigation take place.\" One of the officers involved was placed on administrative leave following the incident and pending an internal investigation. Miami-Dade Police director Stephanie Daniels told the Miami Herald that the decision to place the officer on leave came after a review of the body camera footage from the roadside incident. Despite the incident, Hill played in that afternoon's game against the Jacksonville Jaguars, where he finished with seven catches for 130 yards and one touchdown in a 20–17 win.[182] In the weeks following the incident, Hill announced an effort to combat police misconduct, hiring several attorneys including civil rights attorney Devon M. Jacob, to bring the issue to public attention. Jacob told the media that “Tyreek intends to continue the national movement for necessary police reform that George Floyd’s death started. Tyreek is demanding that Congress finally pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.\"[183][184]",

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. The Green Bay Packers survived Week 18 against the Chicago Bears, but they didn't exit the regular season fully intact. Quarterback Jordan Love, who left the win early due to an elbow injury, told reporters after Sunday's game he was still experiencing numbness in his throwing hand, though he expects to suit up for next week's wild-card playoff matchup with the Philadelphia Eagles. Love initially lost feeling in his right hand after falling on his arm and didn't feel 100% even after sitting out the entire second half of Sunday's 24-22 win. NBC Sports reported earlier that Love hit his funny bone, suffering an injury similar to what Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen overcame this winter, while coach Matt LaFleur said after the game Love was held out as a precaution. Asked specifically if he likes his chances of playing in Philadelphia, Love was blunt: \"Yes.\" In the event Love cannot go against the Eagles, Malik Willis would be in line to start. The former Tennessee Titans prospect saw extensive action Sunday, completing 76.9% of his pass attempts against the Bears. Willis also went 2-0 replacing an injured Love earlier this season. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. CBS Sports is a registered trademark of CBS Broadcasting Inc.

The Fox broadcast reported that Love has a brace over his elbow. Love was hurt when making a throw and the Packers trailing 14-3 in the second quarter. After leaving the game, the Fox cameras showed Love trying to grip a football as trainers surrounded him. Backup quarterback Malik Willis came into the game and the Packers finished the drive with a Josh Jacobs touchdown. Willis started the second half with Love still on the sidelines. Wide receiver Christian Watson has also left the game on the same drive with a knee injury and will not return. Here's when Love was injured against the Bears. Love hit his right elbow on an offensive lineman's helmet as he was attempting to make a throw. Love has not returned to the game after suffering the injury in the second quarter. Before leaving Sunday's game, Love was struggling with his accuracy. He was 7 of 12 passing for 69 yards. The injury is the latest for Love this season. He suffered an MCL sprain in the closing moments of the Packers' season opener against the Philadelphia Eagles. The injury forced him to miss the next two games. He then left the Packers' Week 8 game against the Jacksonville Jaguars with a groin injury. Willis relieved him in the Packers' 30-27 win. Love was back for the Packers' next game against Detroit but was still compromised. The new injury could be a setback with the playoffs just a week away. The Packers have secured a playoff berth but are still playing for seeding.",

It initially looked like he was getting his throwing hand checked out, but the team diagnosed him with a right elbow injury. Green Bay is playing for seeding in its regular seeding finale. The Packers have already locked up a playoff berth, but will be either the No. 6 or No. 7 seed in the NFC playoff picture. Green Bay knows it is going on the road in the Wild Card round, so it can be cautious with its players on Sunday. Malik Willis has taken over under center in relief of Love, and we may not see the starter the rest of the day if the Packers choose to exercise caution. Losing Love would be a gigantic hit to the team's playoff run that starts next week. Here are the latest injury updates for Love in Week 18 vs. Chicago.

Injury updates: WR Christian Watson is questionable to return with a knee injury. QB Jordan Love is questionable to return with a right elbow injury.#CHIvsGB Love was in the pocket when he got hurt. The defense was bearing down on him, and he attempted a pass. While throwing, his elbow and hand came in contract with either an offensive lineman's helmet or the defender. When he was first checked on the field a trainer was looking at his throwing hand and Love was flexing it. Could have been a funny bone situation and a tingling sensation, but it still forced the quarterback to the sideline. The good news is that Love is already throwing on the sideline. He may be trying to make sure he can get a good grip on the ball, and trying to shake that tingling sensation in his elbow or hand if he is dealing with those.

                "title": "Broncos vs. Chiefs score, takeaways: Bo Nix helps Denver earn AFC No. 7 seed, end eight-year playoff drought - CBSSports.com",
                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. The Denver Broncos are back in the playoffs. For the first time since winning Super Bowl 50, the Broncos (10-7) will be in the postseason after punching their playoff ticket thanks to a 38-0 thumping of the Chiefs, who rested several key starters Sunday, including quarterback Patrick Mahomes, tight end Travis Kelce and defensive stalwarts Chris Jones, George Karlaftis and Trent McDuffie. Denver's demolition of Kansas City (15-2) was led by rookie quarterback Bo Nix, who threw four touchdown passes while breaking one of Peyton Manning's franchise records (more on that later). Nix threw three touchdowns in the first half as Denver took a commanding 24-0 lead into intermission. The Broncos' defense recorded four sacks of Chiefs backup quarterback Carson Wentz, who threw for just 98 yards on 10 of 17 passing. Sunday marked the first time the Chiefs were shut out during Andy Reid's 12-year tenure as head coach. Denver's win eliminated the Dolphins and Bengals from postseason contention. Kansas City sewed up the AFC's No. 1 seed by virtue of its Christmas Day win over the Steelers. Here's a closer look at the Broncos' historic win. Nix finished with a season-high 321 yards on 26 of 29 passing. His 89.7 completion percentage broke Manning's 11-year-old, single-game franchise record. Manning completed 89.29% of his throws in Denver's regular season finale against the Raiders back in 2013. In addition to breaking Manning's record, Nix also made NFL history by ending the season with 19 home touchdown passes (the previous record was 17). Nix also led both teams in rushing with 47 yards on seven carries. Nix also became the first quarterback since Hall of Famer John Elway to lead the Broncos to the playoffs as a rookie. Elway did so back in 1983. Sean Payton's receivers came of age this season while consistently making big plays for Nix. One of those players, second-year wideout Marvin Mims Jr., really came on as the regular season came to a close. Mims had two touchdowns against the Bengals in Week 17 and had two more scores against the Chiefs. A 2023 second-round pick, Mims caught six touchdowns in the Broncos' last seven regular-season games. The Broncos made a concerted effort to get Courtland Sutton the 82 yards he needed to receive a $50,000 incentive bonus. Sutton eclipsed that tally before halftime after catching three passes for 89 yards that included a touchdown catch and a 47-yard grab. Sutton also eclipsed 1,000 receiving yards for the season. On a day where they wore their \"Orange Crush\" throwback, Denver's defense once again evoked memories of Denver's legendary 1977 unit that spearheaded the franchise's first trip to the Super Bowl. Nik Bonitto had two of the Broncos' four sacks on Sunday as Denver's defense finished the year with 62 sacks, a new franchise record. The previous mark was held by the 2015, Super Bowl-winning Broncos defense that tallied 52 sacks. It was clear pretty early on that this game wasn't going to be close. The Broncos outgained the Chiefs 187-13 in the first quarter. Denver scored touchdowns on each of its first three drives as Nix completed each of his first 18 pass attempts. The Chiefs did the right thing in ensuring that they kept several of their stars healthy going into the playoffs. But that won't matter to Bengals and Dolphins fans that needed the Chiefs to defeat the Broncos in order to have a chance at stealing the AFC's seventh and final playoff spot. Rookie seventh-round pick Devaughn Vele is another Broncos wideout who stepped up this season. Vele displayed his gift of grab with his impressive touchdown catch off a deflected pass that increased Denver's lead to 21-0. Denver will travel to Buffalo to face Josh Allen and the No. 2 seed Bills in the AFC wild-card round. Buffalo received an MVP-caliber season from Allen, who became the first quarterback in NFL history with multiple seasons with at least 25 touchdown passes and 12 touchdown runs. The Chiefs will wait and see who they will face in the AFC divisional round. Kansas City will play the lowest-seeded wild-card winner. Nix ends the game completing 89.7% of his passes, a Broncos single game record. Jarret Stidham replaces Nix. KC has replaced Wentz with Chris Oladokun, a 2022 seven-round pick with the Steelers. He had a short run on third down (leading to a punt) but had a chance to attempt his first career regular season pass. Denver's O-line just opened up an ocean for rookie RB Audric Estime. Broncos 9:40 away from the playoffs. Around the league, the Chargers have a double-digit lead over the Raiders, so looking like the Steelers will face Baltimore in the wild-card round. That's important bc the Chiefs will face the lowest-rated wild-card winner in the divisional. Nik Bonitto comes in and sacks Wentz on fourth-and-7, as Broncos defense continues to pitch shutout. Broncos defense now up to 64 sacks this year. Broncos lead 31-0 entering the fourth quarter. Nix throws his fourth TD in six drives and his second TD to Mims, who has really come on in his second season. Nix is challenging Peyton Manning's 11-year old franchise record for the highest completion percentage in a single game. Manning completed 89.29 percent of his passes against the Raiders. Nix is tied with Manning. After punting for the first time today, the Broncos are once again on the move on their second drive of the second half. Denver is back in KC territory after Javonte Williams took a short pass and turned it into a 25-yard gain. Denver's 61st sack of the year effectively ended the Chiefs' first drive of the second half. Denver's offense back on the field looking to score on its fifth drive in as many possessions. Harrison Butker misses a 51-yard FG attempt, so the score remains 21-0 Broncos with 1:04 left until halftime. KC had to settle for a long FG try after the Broncos recorded their 60th sack of the year, breaking a single season franchise record that had been held by the 2015 team. Devaughn Vele caught a deflected pass in the end zone to give the Broncos a three TD lead. Great effort by Vale, who caught Nix's 18th home TD pass of the year, an NFL record. Play sums up the type of day it's been so far for Denver. Nix sneaks for a first down on fourth and short that was set up by a nice 13-yard catch and run by Javonte Williams on third-and-14. Nix one TD pass away from setting a new NFL rookie record for home TD passes. Denver's third drive is looking a lot like its first two drives. Nix extends the drive by recording his 24th first down of the year via a run. Broncos lead 14-0 after first quarter This game looks like it's going to be a runaway. Chiefs punt on their second possession as Wentz overthrows Watson on the far sideline. Wentz also got hit pretty hard in the elbow on that throw, so that's something to monitor. Bengals and Dolphins fans can't like what they're seeing so far in Denver. Nix slung a low percentage pass that Sutton hauled in for a score, making it a 14-0 game with 4:53 left in the first quarter. Nix 8 of 8 for 125 yards and two touchdowns early. Courtland Sutton makes a 47-yard grab one play after Nix pick up a fourth-and-1 on a QB sneak. Sutton needed 82 yards today to reach a $500,000 bonus. Suton is also over 1,000 yards this season. Carson Wentz misfired on his first pass attempt of the day as the Chiefs went three and out. Carson Steele was the Chiefs' primary ballcarrier on that drive. Justin Watson was the primary receiver on Wentz's first pass attempt. Not the names you're used to seeing for KC's offense. Peyton Manning, the Broncos' QB the last time the team was in the playoffs, is in attendance hoping to see Denver clinch their first playoff berth since 2015. Marvin Mims Jr. scores his third TD in the last two games while giving Denver an early lead. Bo Nix was a perfect 4 of 4 for 56 yards on the drive. Pristine day weather-wise in Denver for the Broncos' regular season finale. KC has three wins this year by two points or less. One of them was their 16-14 win over Denver back in Week 10. The Chiefs won that game after blocking the Broncos' game-winning field goal attempt as time expired. Denver roared out to a 14-3 lead following two Bo Nix TD passes. But the Chiefs responded with 13 unanswered points that included a TD by TE Travis Kelce, who is inactive today. Nix went 22 of 30 for 215 yards with two TD's and no picks. Kelce had one of his best games of the season with 84 yards and a TD on 8 receptions. If the Chiefs win, they'll join the 2007 Patriots as the only teams in NFL history to win 16 regular season games. New England went 16-0 that year before losing to the Giants in that year's Super Bowl, falling just short of becoming the second perfect team. On Christmas Day, KC joined the '84 49ers, '85 Bears, '98 Vikings, '04 Steelers, '07 Patriots, '11 Packers and '15 Panthers are the only teams to win 15 regular season games. Of those teams, only the '84 49ers and '85 Bears went onto win the SB. Denver is wearing their Orange Crush jerseys for the franchise's biggest game since SB 50. Denver wore this uniforms during their first four Super Bowl seasons: 1977, 1986, 1987 and 1989. The Broncos won their first Super Bowl in 1997, their first year in their \"new\" jerseys that were replaced this past offseason. The playoffs truly start today for Denver No big surprises for the Broncos. About as healthy as a team can be this late in a season. If that holds up today and the Broncos win, that'll be a big advantage for them in the playoffs. As expected, several of the Chiefs stars are getting the day off. Among those who aren't: QB Carson Wentz, WR Xavier Worthy, RB Kareem Hunt, WR JuJu Smith-Schuster, TE Noah Gray, and the majority of KC's defense. So the Chiefs are still capable of winning this game, even if they're shorthanded. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. CBS Sports is a registered trademark of CBS Broadcasting Inc.

Nix throws his fourth TD in six drives and his second TD to Mims, who has really come on in his second season. Nix is challenging Peyton Manning's 11-year old franchise record for the highest completion percentage in a single game. Manning completed 89.29 percent of his passes against the Raiders. Nix is tied with Manning. After punting for the first time today, the Broncos are once again on the move on their second drive of the second half. Denver is back in KC territory after Javonte Williams took a short pass and turned it into a 25-yard gain. Denver's 61st sack of the year effectively ended the Chiefs' first drive of the second half. Denver's offense back on the field looking to score on its fifth drive in as many possessions. Harrison Butker misses a 51-yard FG attempt, so the score remains 21-0 Broncos with 1:04 left until halftime. KC had to settle for a long FG try after the Broncos recorded their 60th sack of the year, breaking a single season franchise record that had been held by the 2015 team. Devaughn Vele caught a deflected pass in the end zone to give the Broncos a three TD lead. Great effort by Vale, who caught Nix's 18th home TD pass of the year, an NFL record. Play sums up the type of day it's been so far for Denver. Nix sneaks for a first down on fourth and short that was set up by a nice 13-yard catch and run by Javonte Williams on third-and-14. Nix one TD pass away from setting a new NFL rookie record for home TD passes. Denver's third drive is looking a lot like its first two drives. Nix extends the drive by recording his 24th first down of the year via a run. Broncos lead 14-0 after first quarter This game looks like it's going to be a runaway. Chiefs punt on their second possession as Wentz overthrows Watson on the far sideline. Wentz also got hit pretty hard in the elbow on that throw, so that's something to monitor. Bengals and Dolphins fans can't like what they're seeing so far in Denver. Nix slung a low percentage pass that Sutton hauled in for a score, making it a 14-0 game with 4:53 left in the first quarter. Nix 8 of 8 for 125 yards and two touchdowns early. Courtland Sutton makes a 47-yard grab one play after Nix pick up a fourth-and-1 on a QB sneak. Sutton needed 82 yards today to reach a $500,000 bonus. Suton is also over 1,000 yards this season. Carson Wentz misfired on his first pass attempt of the day as the Chiefs went three and out. Carson Steele was the Chiefs' primary ballcarrier on that drive. Justin Watson was the primary receiver on Wentz's first pass attempt. Not the names you're used to seeing for KC's offense. Peyton Manning, the Broncos' QB the last time the team was in the playoffs, is in attendance hoping to see Denver clinch their first playoff berth since 2015. Marvin Mims Jr. scores his third TD in the last two games while giving Denver an early lead. Bo Nix was a perfect 4 of 4 for 56 yards on the drive. Pristine day weather-wise in Denver for the Broncos' regular season finale. KC has three wins this year by two points or less. One of them was their 16-14 win over Denver back in Week 10. The Chiefs won that game after blocking the Broncos' game-winning field goal attempt as time expired. Denver roared out to a 14-3 lead following two Bo Nix TD passes. But the Chiefs responded with 13 unanswered points that included a TD by TE Travis Kelce, who is inactive today. Nix went 22 of 30 for 215 yards with two TD's and no picks. Kelce had one of his best games of the season with 84 yards and a TD on 8 receptions. If the Chiefs win, they'll join the 2007 Patriots as the only teams in NFL history to win 16 regular season games. New England went 16-0 that year before losing to the Giants in that year's Super Bowl, falling just short of becoming the second perfect team. On Christmas Day, KC joined the '84 49ers, '85 Bears, '98 Vikings, '04 Steelers, '07 Patriots, '11 Packers and '15 Panthers are the only teams to win 15 regular season games. Of those teams, only the '84 49ers and '85 Bears went onto win the SB. Denver is wearing their Orange Crush jerseys for the franchise's biggest game since SB 50. Denver wore this uniforms during their first four Super Bowl seasons: 1977, 1986, 1987 and 1989. The Broncos won their first Super Bowl in 1997, their first year in their \"new\" jerseys that were replaced this past offseason. The playoffs truly start today for Denver No big surprises for the Broncos. About as healthy as a team can be this late in a season. If that holds up today and the Broncos win, that'll be a big advantage for them in the playoffs. As expected, several of the Chiefs stars are getting the day off. Among those who aren't: QB Carson Wentz, WR Xavier Worthy, RB Kareem Hunt, WR JuJu Smith-Schuster, TE Noah Gray, and the majority of KC's defense. So the Chiefs are still capable of winning this game, even if they're shorthanded. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. CBS Sports is a registered trademark of CBS Broadcasting Inc.

                "title": "Atlanta Falcons - Wikipedia",
                "content": "The Atlanta Falcons are a professional American football team based in Atlanta. The Falcons compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the National Football Conference (NFC) South division. The Falcons were founded on June 30, 1965, and joined the NFL in 1966[6] as an expansion team, after the NFL offered then-owner Rankin Smith a franchise to keep him from joining the rival American Football League (AFL). In their 57 years of existence, the Falcons have compiled a record of 390–503–6 (380–489–6 in the regular season and 10–14 in the playoffs), winning division championships in 1980, 1998, 2004, 2010, 2012, and 2016. The Falcons have appeared in two Super Bowls, the first during the 1998 season in Super Bowl XXXIII, where they lost to the Denver Broncos 34–19,[7] and the second 18 years later, a 34–28 overtime loss to the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LI. They are the oldest major professional sports team in America with no championships.[8] The Falcons' current home field is Mercedes-Benz Stadium, which opened for the 2017 season; the team's headquarters and practice facilities are located at a 50-acre (20 ha) site in Flowery Branch,[9] northeast of Atlanta in Hall County. Professional football first came to Atlanta in 1962, when the American Football League (AFL) staged two preseason contests, with one featuring the Denver Broncos vs. the Houston Oilers and the second pitting the Dallas Texans against the Oakland Raiders. Two years later, the AFL held another exhibition, this time with the New York Jets taking on the San Diego Chargers. In 1965, after the Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium (then known simply as Atlanta Stadium) was built, the city of Atlanta felt the time was right to start pursuing professional football.[10] One independent group which had been active in NFL exhibition promotions in Atlanta applied for franchises in both the AFL and NFL, acting entirely on its own with no guarantee of stadium rights. Another group reported it had deposited earnest money for a team in the AFL.[11] With everyone running in different directions, some local businessmen (Cox Broadcasting) worked out a deal and were awarded an AFL franchise on June 8, contingent upon acquiring exclusive stadium rights from city officials.[12][13] NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle, who had been moving slowly in Atlanta matters, was spurred by the AFL interest and headed on the next plane down to Atlanta to block the rival league's claim on the city of Atlanta.[6][10][13] He forced the city to make a choice between the two leagues;[14] by June 30, the city picked Rankin Smith and the NFL.[10][15] The AFL's original expansion plans in June 1965 were for two new teams in 1966,[16][17] in Atlanta and Philadelphia.[18] It later evolved into the Miami Dolphins in 1966 and the Cincinnati Bengals in 1968. The NFL had planned to add two teams in 1967; the competition with the AFL for Atlanta forced the first to be added a year early in 1966. The odd number of teams (15) resulted in one idle team (bye) each week, with each team playing 14 games over 15 weeks (similar to 1960: 12 games over 13 weeks). The second expansion team, the New Orleans Saints, joined the NFL as planned in 1967 as its sixteenth franchise. The Atlanta Falcons franchise began when it was approved to begin play in 1966 by a unanimous vote of the NFL club owners on June 21, 1965.[19] Rozelle granted ownership nine days later on June 30 to 40-year-old Rankin Smith Sr., an executive vice president of Life Insurance Company of Georgia. He paid $8.5 million, the highest price in NFL history at the time for a franchise.[6] Rozelle and Smith made the deal in about five minutes and the Atlanta Falcons brought the largest and most popular sport to the city of Atlanta. The Atlanta expansion team became the 15th NFL franchise, and they were awarded the first overall pick in the 1966 NFL draft as well as the final pick in each of the first five rounds.[20] They selected consensus All-American linebacker Tommy Nobis from the University of Texas, making him the first-ever Falcon. The league also held the expansion draft six weeks later in which Atlanta selected unprotected players from the 14 existing franchises. Although the Falcons selected many good players in those drafts, they still were not able to win right away.[6] The Atlanta team received its nickname on August 29, 1965. Miss Julia Elliott, a school teacher from Griffin, was singled out from many people who suggested \"Falcons\" as the nickname for the new franchise.[21] She wrote: \"the Falcon is proud and dignified, with great courage and fight. It never drops its prey. It is deadly and has a great sporting tradition.\"[22][23] The Falcons' inaugural season was in 1966, and their first preseason game was on August 1, a loss to the Philadelphia Eagles. Under head coach Norb Hecker, Atlanta lost their first nine regular-season games in 1966; their first victory came on the road against the struggling New York Giants on November 20 in Yankee Stadium. Two weeks later, Atlanta won at Minnesota, and beat St. Louis in Atlanta the next week for their first home win.[24] The team finished with a 1–12–1 record the next year, with the only win coming in Week 7 in a 21–20 win over the Minnesota Vikings in 1967.[25] After a 0–3 start to the 1968 season, Hecker was dismissed.[26] Norm Van Brocklin finished out the season as head coach with a 2–9 record.[27] Van Brocklin continued to coach the team the next season. The team improved to a 6–8 record in 1969.[28] The Falcons had their first Monday Night Football game in Atlanta during the 1970 season, a 20–7 loss to the Miami Dolphins. The team went 4–8–2 in 1970.[29] The only two winning seasons in their first 12 years were 1971 (7–6–1) and 1973 (9–5). In the 1978 season, the 9–7 Falcons qualified for the playoffs for the first time and won the Wild Card game against the Eagles 14–13.[30][31] The following week, they lost to the Dallas Cowboys 27–20 in the Divisional Playoffs.[32] The 1979 team regressed to a 6–10 record.[33] In the 1980 season, after a nine-game winning streak, the Falcons posted a franchise then-best record of 12–4 and captured their first NFC West division title. The next week, their dream season ended at home with a loss to the Cowboys 30–27 in the divisional playoffs. In the strike-shortened 1982 season, the 5–4 Falcons made the playoffs but lost to the Minnesota Vikings, 30–24.[34] Falcons coach Leeman Bennett was fired after the loss.[35] The team then had losing seasons for the next eight years. Dan Henning was hired prior to the 1983 season.[36] In the 1989 NFL draft, the Falcons selected cornerback Deion Sanders in the first round, who helped them for the next four years, setting many records for the franchise.[37] \"Neon Deion\" (a.k.a. \"Prime Time\") had a flashy appeal and helped bring media attention to one of the league's most anonymous franchises. Sanders was also famous for playing on major league baseball teams (New York Yankees and the Atlanta Braves) while simultaneously playing in the NFL. After defeating the New Orleans Saints in the NFC Wild Card game, the Falcons' 1991 season ended in a divisional playoff loss to the Washington Redskins. In the 1991 NFL draft, the Falcons selected quarterback Brett Favre as the 33rd overall pick. During his rookie season, he played in two games where he amassed a record of four passing attempts with no receptions and two interceptions. The following February, Favre was traded to the Green Bay Packers.[38] In 1992, the Atlanta Falcons opened a new chapter in their history moving into the newly constructed Georgia Dome, where the team has defeated all 31 other NFL teams at least once during its time there.[39] In 1998, under recently acquired head coach Dan Reeves, quarterback Chris Chandler and running back Jamal Anderson the \"Dirty Bird\" Falcons had their greatest season to date.[40][41] On November 8, they beat the New England Patriots 41–10, ending a streak of 22 losses at cold-weather sites. The team finished with a franchise-best 14–2 regular-season record and the NFC West division championship.[42] On January 17, 1999, the Falcons upset the top-seeded Vikings at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome in the NFC Championship Game 30–27, in an exciting overtime victory. However, in their first-ever Super Bowl appearance, they lost 34–19 to the defending champion Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XXXIII. In the second game of the Falcons 1999 season, running back Jamal Anderson, who had been a key player in the Falcons' 1998 success, suffered a season-ending knee injury. The Falcons finished the season with a very disappointing 5–11 regular-season record.[43] In 2000, the Falcons suffered through another horrendous season finishing 4–12 and once again missing the playoffs.[44] In the 2001 NFL draft, the Falcons orchestrated a trade with the San Diego Chargers, acquiring the first overall pick (which was used on quarterback Michael Vick) in exchange for wide receiver-return specialist Tim Dwight and the fifth overall pick (used on running back LaDainian Tomlinson).[45] The Falcons finished the 2001 season with a record of 7–9 and missed the playoffs.[46] Jessie Tuggle retired following 14 seasons in Atlanta.[47] On December 6, 2001, billionaire Home Depot co-founder Arthur M. Blank reached a preliminary agreement with the Falcons' Taylor Smith to purchase the team for a reported $545 million.[48] In a special meeting prior to Super Bowl XXXVI in New Orleans on February 2, 2002, NFL owners voted unanimously to approve the deal.[49] The 2002 season saw the Falcons return to the playoffs with a regular-season record of 9–6–1, tying the Pittsburgh Steelers.[50] It was Vick's first year as the starter, and the team, with newly acquired running back Warrick Dunn, delivered the Green Bay Packers their first home playoff loss ever with a 27–7 result in the Wild Card Round.[51] A 20–6 loss to the Donovan McNabb-led Philadelphia Eagles the following week, however, ended the Falcons' season.[52] On March 19, 2003, the Falcons presented their new logo.[53][6] During the 2003 preseason Vick broke his leg and missed the first 12 games of the season. After losing 7 straight games, the decision was made to fire head coach Dan Reeves.[54] Wade Phillips acted as interim coach for the final three games.[55] Although the Falcons won 3 of their last 4 games after the return of Vick, they ended up with a 5–11 record that year.[56] In 2004, a new head coach, Jim L. Mora, was hired and Vick returned for the full season. The Falcons went 11–5, winning their third division title and earning a first-round bye into the playoffs. In the divisional playoffs, the Falcons defeated the St. Louis Rams, 47–17, in the Georgia Dome, advancing to the NFC Championship Game, which they lost to the Eagles, 27–10.[57][58][59] The Falcons again fell short of achieving back-to-back winning seasons in 2005, going 8–8.[60] In 2006, Michael Vick became the first quarterback in league history to rush for more than 1,000 yards in a season, with 1,039.[61] After finishing the season 7–9, however, coach Jim Mora was dismissed.[62] Bobby Petrino, the University of Louisville's football coach, replaced Mora.[63] Before the 2007 season began, Vick was suspended indefinitely by the NFL after pleading guilty to charges involving dog fighting in the state of Virginia.[64] On December 10, 2007, Vick received a 23-month prison sentence and was officially cut from the Atlanta roster.[65] For the 2007 season, the Falcons were forced to start Joey Harrington at quarterback.[66] On December 11, 13 games into his first NFL season as head coach, Bobby Petrino resigned without notice to coach at the University of Arkansas, leaving the beleaguered players only a note in the locker room.[67] Secondary Coach Emmitt Thomas was named interim coach for the final three games of the season on December 12. The Falcons ended the year with a dismal 4–12 record.[68] After the tumultuous and disappointing 2007 season, the Falcons made a number of moves, hiring a new general manager and head coach, drafting a new starting quarterback, and signing a starting running back. On January 13, 2008, the Falcons named former Patriots director of college football scouting Thomas Dimitroff General Manager.[69] On January 23, Jacksonville Jaguars defensive coach and former linebackers coach for the 2000 Super Bowl champion Baltimore Ravens Mike Smith was named the Falcons' new head coach.[70] Chargers back-up running back Michael Turner agreed to a 6-year, $30 million deal on March 2.[71] On April 26, Matt Ryan (quarterback from Boston College) was drafted third overall in the 2008 NFL draft by the Falcons.[72] The Falcons finished the 2008 regular season with a record of 11–5, and the #5 seed in the playoffs.[73] On December 21, 2008, Atlanta beat the Minnesota Vikings 24–17 to clinch a wild card spot, earning a trip to the playoffs for the first time since 2004. The Falcons would go on to lose in the wild-card round of the 2008 NFL playoffs to the eventual NFC champion Arizona Cardinals, 30–24.[74] Matt Ryan started all 16 games in his rookie season and was named the Associated Press Offensive Rookie of the Year.[75] First-year head coach Mike Smith was named 2008 NFL Coach of the Year.[76] Although they failed to make the playoffs in 2009 the team rallied to win their final three regular-season games to record back-to-back winning seasons for the first time in franchise history. The Falcons defeated the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 20–10 in the final game of the season to improve their record to 9–7.[77] In 2010, with a regular-season record of 13–3, the Falcons secured a third straight winning season, their fourth overall divisional title, and the top overall seed in the NFC playoffs; however, the Falcons were overpowered by the eventual Super Bowl XLV champion Green Bay Packers in the NFC Divisional Playoffs 48–21.[78][79] The Falcons scored 414 points – the fifth-most in franchise history.[7] The team sent an NFL-high and franchise-best nine players to the 2011 Pro Bowl.[80] The Falcons made a surprise trade up with the Cleveland Browns in the 2011 NFL draft to select Alabama wide receiver Julio Jones sixth overall. In exchange, the Falcons gave up their first-, second- and fourth-round draft picks in 2011, and their first and fourth draft picks in 2012.[81] Jones, along with teammates Tony Gonzalez and Roddy White, have since been dubbed Atlanta's \"Big Three\" (based on their total number of reception yards).[82] On August 30, 2011, Sports Illustrated senior writer Peter King, who correctly predicted the 2011 Super Bowl, made his predictions for the 2011 season and picked the Falcons to defeat the San Diego Chargers in the 2012 Super Bowl.[83] The Falcons finished the season at 10–6, securing the fifth seed after a Week 17 beatdown of Tampa Bay in which the Falcons pulled their starters after leading 42–0 just 23 minutes into the game.[84] The Falcons then went on to play the New York Giants in a 2011 NFC Wild Card Game at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. The first half was a defensive struggle, with the first points coming off of a safety by the Falcons, giving Atlanta a 2–0 lead. In the second quarter, though, Eli Manning connected with Hakeem Nicks for a short touchdown pass to make it 7–2 Giants heading into the second half. Then the Giants took control, as Manning threw for two more touchdown passes to Mario Manningham and Nicks and the defense completed its shutout of the Falcons to give the New York Giants the win, 24–2, and the Falcons their third straight playoff loss with Matt Ryan and Mike Smith.[85] After the season, defensive coordinator Brian VanGorder accepted a coaching job at Auburn University, and the offensive coordinator Mike Mularkey took the head coaching job in Jacksonville.[86] Atlanta exploded out of the gate, going a franchise-best 8–0 and remaining the last unbeaten team in the NFL that year.[87] Their hopes to get an undefeated season came to an end with a 27–31 loss to the division rival Saints. Julio Jones had a remarkable second year, grabbing 10 touchdowns and 1,198 yards. The Falcons finished the season 13–3, and clinched the number one seed in the NFC playoffs.[88][89] The Falcons played the Seattle Seahawks in their first playoff game. Although they went down 28–27 with only 31 seconds left on the clock, Matt Ryan led the team to their first playoff victory, 30–28.[90] It was the only playoff victory in the Mike Smith era. The Atlanta Falcons then advanced to face the San Francisco 49ers. The Falcons seized control of the game early with a Matt Bryant field goal, a trio of Matt Ryan touchdown passes caught by Julio Jones and Tony Gonzalez coupled with outstanding defensive play. By the end of the half, the score was 24–14. The tides of the game began to shift in the second half as the 49ers rallied back with a pair of Frank Gore touchdown runs. Atlanta's offense attempted to reply but were ultimately shut down by the 49er defense. A few series later, late in the 4th quarter with little time remaining, Atlanta found themselves in a 4th and 4 situation at the 10-yard line. The Falcons needed just 10 more yards to secure victory and advance to their first Super Bowl berth in 14 years. Matt Ryan fired a pass to Roddy White which was ultimately broken up by inside linebacker NaVorro Bowman, resulting in a 28–24 defeat.[91] Following the success of the previous season, the Falcons were an expected Super Bowl contender. However, injuries hampered the team's performance and the team finished the season 4–12.[92] With that, the streak of consecutive winning seasons came to an end and Mike Smith had his first losing season as a head coach. Tony Gonzalez, in his final season in the NFL, was selected to the 2014 Pro Bowl as a starter representing Team Rice. Following the conclusion of the 2012 season, director of player personnel Les Snead departed the team to join the St. Louis Rams and Dave Caldwell, assistant to general manager Thomas Dimitroff, left the team to join the Jacksonville Jaguars. Scott Pioli, former GM of the Kansas City Chiefs, was announced as the Falcons' new assistant GM. Mike Smith was given a one-year extension on his contract as head coach. The Falcons had the 6th overall pick in the 2014 NFL draft with which they selected Jake Matthews, who played as offensive tackle for Texas A&M.[93] Despite having another rough season, the Falcons still had an opportunity to qualify for the playoffs at the end of the regular season. The Falcons hosted the Carolina Panthers in their regular season finale, with the winners clinching the NFC South division. Unfortunately, the Falcons lost in a 34–3 blowout as Matt Ryan threw two interceptions that were returned for touchdowns and got sacked six times. The Falcons finished the season 6–10, marking the second consecutive losing season for the team.[94] The following day, Mike Smith was fired after seven seasons as head coach.[95] The Falcons would soon hire Seattle Seahawks defensive coordinator Dan Quinn as the team's 16th head coach.[96] The Falcons had the 8th overall pick in the 2015 NFL draft with which they selected Vic Beasley, a defensive end from Clemson University.[97] In February 2015, the team was investigated by the NFL for alleged use of artificial crowd noise in the Georgia Dome.[98] The Falcons lost a 2016 NFL draft selection as a result of the league's investigation.[99] Dan Quinn's first season saw a 5–0 start, the team's best start in four years. They would then struggle throughout the rest of the season by losing 8 of their last 11 games, resulting in an 8–8 record in the 2015 season.[100] They did, however, give the Panthers their only regular-season loss. The Falcons used their first-round pick in the 2016 NFL draft on safety Keanu Neal from the University of Florida.[101] In the Falcons' 25th and final season in the Georgia Dome, Atlanta lost their week 1 game to the Buccaneers 24–31. The Falcons would then win their next four including one over the Panthers, when the franchise set new records: Matt Ryan threw for 503 yards, and Julio Jones caught 12 passes for 300 yards.[102] Beating the San Francisco 49ers 41–13 in Week 15, the Falcons improved to 9–5 and secured their first winning season since 2012. One week later, the Falcons defeated the Panthers in Charlotte, North Carolina, and clinched their first NFC South division title since 2012. In their last regular-season game at the Georgia Dome, the Falcons defeated the New Orleans Saints, and secured an 11–5 record and a first-round bye.[103] In the divisional round of the playoffs, Atlanta defeated the Seahawks 36–20 in the Georgia Dome, and hosted their last game at the Georgia Dome against the Green Bay Packers in the NFC Championship Game on January 22, 2017.[104] The Falcons defeated the Packers 44–21 to advance to Super Bowl LI as the NFC champions.[105] Atlanta was up 28–3 late in the third quarter, and the New England Patriots scored 31 unanswered points, with the last 6 in the first-ever overtime in the Super Bowl. The Patriots' 25-point comeback was the largest in Super Bowl history.[106] In 2016, the Falcons scored 540 points in the regular season, the seventh-most in NFL history, tied with the Greatest Show on Turf (the 2000 St. Louis Rams).[107] However, the Falcons defense gave up 406 points, 27th in the league.[108] The Falcons moved into their new home, the Mercedes-Benz Stadium, this season.[109] Their first game ever played at the new stadium was a preseason loss to the Arizona Cardinals. The first regular-season game at the new stadium was a rematch of the 2016–17 NFC Championship, with Atlanta defeating Green Bay 34–23.[110] Their first loss of the season was a 23–17 home defeat to the Buffalo Bills in week 4.[111] The team returned to the playoffs with a 10–6 record (albeit with a third-place finish in the NFC South). The Falcons defeated the Los Angeles Rams 26–13 in the Wild Card round, but their 2017 season came to an end a week later in the Divisional Playoff round at the hands of the eventual Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles 15–10.[112][113] The 2018 and 2019 seasons saw the Falcons go 7–9 and miss the postseason both years.[114][115] In their first game with new uniforms, the Falcons lost to the Seattle Seahawks at home 38–25.[116] The Falcons then suffered comebacks made by both the Cowboys on the road (39–40) and then back in Atlanta against the Bears (26–30).[117][118] On October 11, after the team suffered a 23–16 loss at home against the Carolina Panthers and fell to 0–5, the Falcons announced the firings of Quinn and Dimitroff.[119] Defensive coordinator Raheem Morris took over for the rest of the season, leading the team to a 4–12 record.[120] Morris was not retained after the season, and soon joined the Los Angeles Rams as their defensive coordinator.[121] On January 15, 2021, the Falcons announced that Tennessee Titans offensive coordinator Arthur Smith had been named the 18th head coach in franchise history.[122] Four days later, New Orleans Saints executive Terry Fontenot was named the Falcons' new general manager.[123] Tight end Kyle Pitts was selected with the 4th pick of the 2021 draft, and longtime star receiver Julio Jones was traded to the Titans, after publicly requesting a trade from Atlanta.[124][125] The Falcons improved on their record from the prior year, finishing the season with a 7–10 record.[126] On March 21, 2022, the Falcons traded longtime star quarterback Matt Ryan to the Indianapolis Colts.[127] During the 2022 season, the team finished last place in the NFC South with a 7–10 record.[128] The Falcons entered the 2023 seasons with heightened expectations after drafting Texas running back Bijan Robinson with the eighth overall pick of the 2023 draft and making significant improvements in free agency, including signing Jessie Bates and Calais Campbell to improve their defense.[129] However, the team finished with a 7–10 record for the third consecutive season, although they had been in contention for a playoff spot until the final day of the season before a 48–17 loss to the New Orleans Saints on January 7, 2024.[130] The following day, Smith was fired after three years as head coach.[131] On January 25, 2024, the Falcons announced Raheem Morris's return to the organization, this time as the 19th head coach in Falcons history.[132] During the early months of his tenure, Morris faced scrutiny and criticism for his questionable player selection decisions.[133] The Falcons have called three stadiums home in their 51 years of existence, and its third home in their history opened in the late summer of 2017. The first was the Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium, sharing with the Atlanta Braves Major League Baseball team until 1991. In 1992, the Georgia Dome was built, and the Falcons played there from its opening to the 2016 season. The Dome has been frequently used for college football, including Georgia State football and college bowl games such as the Peach Bowl. In an effort to replace the aging Georgia Dome and potentially host a future Super Bowl, team owner Arthur Blank proposed a deal with the city of Atlanta to build a new state-of-the-art stadium not far from where the Georgia Dome is located. Blank will contribute $800 million and the city of Atlanta will contribute an additional $200 million via bonds backed by the city's hotel/motel tax towards the construction of a retractable roof stadium. Blank will contribute additional money for cost overruns if it is needed. The team will provide up to $50 million towards infrastructure costs that weren't included in the construction budget and to retire the remaining debt on the Georgia Dome. In addition, Blank's foundation and the city will each provide $15 million for development in surrounding neighborhoods. Though the total cost of the stadium was initially estimated to be around $1 billion,[134] the total cost was revised to $1.5 billion according to Blank.[135] In March 2013, the Atlanta City Council voted 11–4 in favor of building the stadium.[136] The retractable roof Mercedes-Benz Stadium broke ground in May 2014, and became the third home stadium for the Falcons and the first for the new Atlanta United FC Major League Soccer club upon opening in 2017.[137] The Atlanta Falcons' colors are black, red, silver and white.[138] When the team began play in 1966, the Falcons wore red helmets with a black falcon crest logo. In the center of the helmet was a center black stripe surrounded by two gold stripes and two white stripes. These colors represented the two college rival schools in the state of Georgia; rival schools Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets (white and gold) and the Georgia Bulldogs (red and black). Although the gold was removed after several seasons, the white remains to this day. They wore white pants and either black or white jerseys. At first, the falcon crest logo was also put on the jersey sleeves, but it was replaced by a red and white stripe pattern four years later. They switched from black to red jerseys in 1971, and the club began to wear silver pants in 1978. The facemasks on the helmets were initially gray, becoming white in 1978, and then black in 1984; the team wore black face masks until its 2020 redesign. A prototype white helmet was developed for the team prior to the 1974 season, but was never worn. In 1990, the uniform design changed to black helmets, silver pants, and either black or white jerseys.[139] The numbers on the white jerseys were black, but were changed to red in 1997. (The red numerals could be seen on the away jerseys briefly in 1990.) Both the logo and uniforms changed in 2003. The logo was redesigned with red and silver accents to depict a more powerful, aggressive falcon, which now more closely resembles the capital letter F.[53][140] Although the Falcons still wore black helmets, the new uniforms featured jerseys and pants with red trim down the sides. The uniform design consisted of either black or white jerseys, and either black or white pants. During that same year, a red alternate jersey with black trim was also introduced. The Falcons also started wearing black cleats with these uniforms.[141] In 2004, the red jerseys became the primary jerseys, and the black ones became the alternate, both worn with white pants. In select road games, the Falcons wear black pants with white jerseys. The Falcons wore an all-black combination for home games against their archrivals, the New Orleans Saints, winning the first two contests (24–21 in 2004 and 36–17 in 2005), but losing 31–13 in 2006. The Falcons wore the all-black combination against the New Orleans Saints for four straight seasons starting in 2004, With the last time being in 2007, losing 34–14. They wore the combination again in 2006, against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Week 2. The Falcons won that game, 14–3. The Falcons also wore their all-black uniform in 2007 against the New York Giants, and in 2008 against the Carolina Panthers and against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (for the second time). After that, the black pants and uniforms were retired and the white pants were now used full-time with the regular uniforms. In the 1980s, the Falcons wore their white uniforms at home most of the time because of the heat. When the Falcons started playing in a dome, the team switched to their dark uniforms for home games but have worn their white uniforms at home a few times since switching to the dome. It was announced at the 2009 state of the franchise meeting that the Falcons would wear 1966 throwback uniforms for a couple games during the 2009 season. The Atlanta Falcons wore 1966 throwback jerseys for two home games in 2009 – against the Carolina Panthers on September 20 and against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on November 29. The Falcons won both of those games. They donned the throwbacks again for 2 games in 2010, against Baltimore and San Francisco, winning both of those games as well. The throwbacks were used twice in 2011 and 2012; both times were against the Panthers and Saints. However, the throwbacks were retired following a 2013 NFL rule requiring only one helmet shell per team. The Falcons unveiled an all-red Color Rush uniform on September 13, 2016; however, due to the fact that the Falcons and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers had similar all-red Color Rush uniforms, the Falcons were unable to wear their Color Rush uniform until the 2017 season.[142][143] Also in 2016, the Falcons unveiled a mixed throwback uniform set. The uniform tops, pants and socks closely resembled their 1960s kits. From 2016 to 2021, due to the NFL's one-shell rule, the Falcons wore the black helmets with the original logo decal similar to the design they wore in the 1990s. However, starting in 2022, with the NFL now reinstating the use of alternate helmets, the Falcons brought back the original red helmets to pair with their throwback uniforms.[144] It was revealed in January 2020 that the Falcons will change uniforms for the 2020 NFL season.[145] The ensuing design featured the return to black as the primary home uniform color for the first time since 2003. Both the primary home and road uniforms featured the \"ATL\" abbreviation in red above either white or black numbers with red drop shadows. The white and black tops are usually paired with either white or black pants. The alternate uniform featured a red/black gradient design and also featured the \"ATL\" abbreviation in white above white numbers with black drop shadows. Black pants are only used with this uniform. All three uniforms feature red side stripes. The current throwback uniform was also retained. In addition, the Falcons switched to matte helmets with the enlarged falcon logo and gray facemasks.[146] The red/black gradient alternates only lasted three seasons before it was removed from the uniform rotation in 2023.[147] The Falcons have shared a heated divisional rivalry with the New Orleans Saints (first the NFC West, and now the NFC South). The two teams were often basement-dwellers in the division; but the rivalry grew as a means of pride between the two cities, as they were the only two NFL teams in the Deep South for multiple decades. The series is the oldest and most iconic rivalry in the NFC South as the two teams have long harbored bad blood against one another.[148] The series is currently tied at 55–55, including the most recent loss to the Saints on January 7, 2024, when the Falcons lost 48–17.[149] In addition, the Falcons share a similar, rivalry with the Carolina Panthers, with both teams having been in the NFC West from the Panthers' founding in 1995 to the NFL realignment in 2002. Similar to their rivalry with the Saints, the Falcons have often endured several competitive divisional battles with the Panthers for lead of the NFC South, though the two have yet to meet in the postseason. The series is also known as the \"I-85 Rivalry\"[150] due to Atlanta and Charlotte being only four hours apart on Interstate 85.[151][152] The Falcons lead the series 36–22.[153] The Falcons share a less-intense divisional rivalry with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers since the NFL realignment in 2002. The two had been regional opponents but very little had linked any further animosity towards the two as the Buccaneers played in the former NFC Central before the realignment.[154][155][156] The two teams would find themselves competing over staff and players alike, particularly during the 2000s after the Falcons had lured general manager Rich McKay after winning Super Bowl XXXVII the season prior.[157] McKay's ties with Tampa extend into his family as his father John McKay was head coach of the Buccaneers for nine seasons.[158][159][160][161] The Eagles lead the Falcons 21–15–1, with a 3–1 lead in playoff games.[162] The rivalry first emerged after the Falcons upset the Eagles 14–13 in the 1978 Wild Card Round,[163] and only intensified further in the 2000s thanks to the rivalry between prominent dual-threat quarterbacks Donovan McNabb, and Michael Vick. Recently, the Falcons lost to the Eagles in the 2017 divisional round.[164][165][166] The Falcons have also shared a playoff rivalry with the Green Bay Packers as much of the connections between the two teams stems from Atlanta trading future hall-of-fame quarterback Brett Favre to the Green Bay on February 11, 1992, in exchange for a first-round pick.[167][168] The two teams have met four times in the postseason, most recently during the 2016–17 NFC Championship as it would also be the final game played at the Georgia Dome.[169][170][171] The Packers lead the all-time series 19–16, while both teams are tied in the postseason 2–2.[172] Includes postseason records[173] Source:[174] Note: W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties Running backs (RB) Wide receivers (WR) Tight ends (TE) Defensive linemen (DL) Defensive backs (DB) Special teams Reserve 53 active, 12 reserve, 15 practice squad (+1 exempt) Humphrey is the only person in the Hall of Fame who spent the majority of his career with the Falcons. Fourteen members are included in the Atlanta Falcons Ring of Honor.[200][201][202][203] In the team's history, the Falcons have had the number one overall pick four times.[205] In their history, the Atlanta Falcons have had 18 head coaches. Five coaches have served in interim roles[206][207] → Coaching staff → Front office → More NFL staffs The Falcons' flagship radio station is WZGC 92.9 The Game.[208] Wes Durham, son of longtime North Carolina Tar Heels voice Woody Durham, is the Falcons' play-by-play announcer, with former Atlanta Falcons quarterback and pro football veteran, Dave Archer serving as color commentator.[209][210] In 2014, The CW affiliate WUPA became the official television station of the Falcons, gaining rights to its preseason games, which are produced by CBS Sports.[211] In the regular season, the team's games are seen on Fox's O&O affiliate WAGA. When the Falcons challenge an AFC team, CBS affiliate WANF will air those games while Sunday night games are televised on WXIA, the local NBC affiliate. Source:[212]",

                "content": "National Football League (1970–present) The Cincinnati Bengals are a professional American football team based in Cincinnati. The Bengals compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the American Football Conference (AFC) North division. The team plays its home games at Paycor Stadium in downtown Cincinnati.[7] Former Cleveland Browns head coach Paul Brown began planning for the creation of the Bengals franchise in 1965, and Cincinnati's city council approved the construction of Riverfront Stadium in 1966. Finally, in 1967, the Bengals were founded when a group headed by Brown received franchise approval by the American Football League (AFL) on May 23, 1967, and they began play in the 1968 season.[8] Brown was the Bengals' head coach from their inception to 1975. After being dismissed as the Browns' head coach by Art Modell (who had purchased a majority interest in the team in 1961) in January 1963, Brown had shown interest in establishing another NFL franchise in Ohio and looked at both Cincinnati and Columbus. He ultimately chose the former when a deal between the city, Hamilton County, and Major League Baseball's Cincinnati Reds (who were seeking a replacement for the obsolete Crosley Field) was struck that resulted in an agreement to build a multipurpose stadium which could host both baseball and football games. Due to the impending merger of the AFL and the NFL, which was scheduled to take full effect in the 1970 season, Brown agreed to join the AFL as its 10th and final franchise. The Bengals, like the other former AFL teams, were assigned to the AFC following the merger. Cincinnati was also selected because, like their neighbors the Reds, they could draw from several large neighboring cities (Louisville and Lexington, Kentucky; Columbus, Dayton, and Springfield, Ohio) that are all no more than 110 miles (180 km) away from downtown Cincinnati, along with Indianapolis, until the Baltimore Colts relocated there prior to the 1984 NFL season.[9] After Paul Brown's death in 1991, controlling interest in the team was inherited by his son, Mike Brown. In 2011, Brown purchased shares of the team owned by the estate of co-founder Austin Knowlton and is now the majority owner of the Bengals franchise.[7] The Bengals won the AFC championship in 1981, 1988, and in 2021. After each of the 1981 and 1988 conference championships, they went on to lose to the San Francisco 49ers, in Super Bowls XVI and XXIII. The team struggled greatly in the 1990s and the early 2000s, during which time they were sometimes referred to disparagingly as \"The Bungles,\" a term coined by Steelers broadcaster Myron Cope.[10] [11][12][13][14] Following the 1990 season, the team went 14 years without making the NFL playoffs or posting a winning record. The Bengals went through several head coaches in that period, and many of their top draft picks did not pan out. The team's fortunes improved in the mid-2000s and into the mid-2010s, which saw them become more consistent postseason contenders, but they continued to struggle in the playoffs.[15][16][17][18] The turning point for the Bengals was during the 2021 season, when they won their first playoff game in 31 years and advanced to the first of two consecutive AFC Championship games. In 2021, they defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 27–24 in overtime and advanced to Super Bowl LVI, their first appearance in the Super Bowl in 33 years, where they lost to the Los Angeles Rams 23–20.[19] They advanced to the AFC Championship game again in 2022 but lost to the eventual Super Bowl champions, the Chiefs, by a score of 23–20 (the same exact score as in Super Bowl LVI).[20] The team does not have an official general manager. However, Duke Tobin is the Bengals’ “de facto general manager” because he handles most personnel decisions.[21] In a 2011 survey, Brown was rated as among the worst team owners in American professional sports.[22] In a Forbes article on the value of NFL teams as of August 2022, the Cincinnati Bengals were ranked last with a value of $3 billion.[23] In 1967, an ownership group led by Paul Brown was granted a franchise in the American Football League. Brown named the team the Bengals in order \"to give it a link with past professional football in Cincinnati\".[24] Another Cincinnati Bengals team had existed in the city and played in three previous American Football Leagues[25] from 1937 to 1942. The city's world-renowned zoo was also home to a rare white Bengal tiger. In a possible insult to Art Modell – or possibly as a homage to the Massillon Tigers – Brown chose the exact shade of orange used by his former team. He added black as the secondary color. Brown chose a very simple logo: the word \"BENGALS\" in black lettering. One of the potential helmet designs Brown rejected was a striped motif that was similar to the helmets adopted by the team in 1981 still in use today; however, that design featured stripes which were more uniform in width.[26] The Bengals began play in the 1968 season. In 1966, the American Football League agreed to a merger with its older and more established rival, the National Football League.[27] Among the terms of the merger was that the AFL was permitted to add one additional franchise; the NFL wanted an even number of clubs in the merged league, so a team needed to be added to bring the number of clubs in the merged league to 26 teams. For the AFL, a key motive behind their agreement to accept a new team was that the guarantee of an eventual place in the NFL meant the league could charge a steep expansion fee of $10 million – 400 times the $25,000 the original eight owners paid when they founded the league in 1960. The cash from the new team provided the American Football League with the funds needed to pay the indemnities required to be paid by the AFL to the NFL, as stipulated by the merger agreement. Prior to the merger's announcement, Brown had not seriously considered joining the American Football League and was not a supporter of what he openly regarded to be an inferior competition, once famously stating that \"I didn't pay ten million dollars to be in the AFL.\"[28] However, with the announcement of the merger, Brown realized that the AFL expansion franchise would likely be his only realistic path back into the NFL in the short to medium term, and ultimately acquiesced to joining the AFL after learning that the team was guaranteed to become an NFL franchise after the merger was completed in 1970. There was also a major problem: Major League Baseball's Cincinnati Reds were in need of a facility to replace Crosley Field, which they had used since 1912. By this time, the small park was antiquated and rundown, and parking issues had plagued the city since the early 1950s, while the park also lacked modern amenities – issues that were exacerbated by the Mill Creek Expressway (I-75) project that ran alongside the park. While New York City – which had lost both its National League teams in 1957 after the Dodgers relocated to Los Angeles, and the Giants relocated to San Francisco – had actively courted Reds owner Powel Crosley to relocate his team there, Crosley was adamant that the Reds remain in Cincinnati and tolerated the worsening problems with the Crosley Field location. With assistance from Ohio governor Jim Rhodes, Hamilton County and the Cincinnati city council agreed to build a single multi-purpose facility on the dilapidated riverfront section of the city: the new facility had to be ready by the opening of the 1970 NFL season, and was officially named Riverfront Stadium. With the completion of the merger in 1970, the Cleveland Browns were one of three NFL teams that agreed to move to the AFL-based American Football Conference to give both conferences an equal number of teams and were placed in the AFC Central, the same division as the Bengals. An instant rivalry was born, fueled initially by Paul Brown's rivalry with Art Modell.[29][30] For their first two seasons, the Bengals played at Nippert Stadium, the current home of the University of Cincinnati Bearcats.[31] The team held training camp at Wilmington College in Wilmington, through the 1968 preseason. The team finished its first season with a 3–11 record[32] and running back Paul Robinson, who rushed for 1,023 yards, and was named the AFL Rookie of the Year.[33] Founder Paul Brown coached the team for its first eight seasons.[34] One of Brown's college draft strategies was to draft players from non-traditional football schools. Punter/wide receiver Pat McInally attended Harvard University, and linebacker Reggie Williams attended Dartmouth College and served on Cincinnati city council while on the Bengals' roster. Because of this policy, many former players went on to have successful careers in commentary and broadcasting as well as the arts. In addition, Brown had a knack for locating and recognizing pro football talent in unusual places.[35] In 1970, the Bengals moved to play at Riverfront Stadium, a home they shared with the Cincinnati Reds until the team moved to Paul Brown Stadium in 2000. Notable players of the 1970 team included Virgil Carter, Chip Meyers, Jack Meckstroth, Bob Trumpy, and Lemar Parrish. Virgil Carter threw for 1,647 yards. Chip Myers paced all receivers, catching 32 passes for 542 yards. Bob Trumpy contributed to the receiving game, too.[36] The team reached the playoffs three times during that decade, but could not win any of those postseason games. In 1975, the team posted an 11–3 record, giving them what remains the highest winning percentage (.786) in franchise history. But it only earned them a wild card spot in the playoffs, behind the 12–2 Pittsburgh Steelers, who went on to win the Super Bowl; the Bengals lost to the Oakland Raiders 31–28 in the divisional playoffs.[37] The Bengals reached the Super Bowl twice during the 1980s – in Super Bowl XVI and Super Bowl XXIII – and lost against the San Francisco 49ers both times.[38][39] The team appeared in the playoffs in 1990, making it to the second round before losing to the Los Angeles Raiders.[40] Before the following season got underway, Paul Brown died at age 82.[41] Due to declining health, he had already transferred control to his son, Mike Brown, but was reported to still influence the daily operations of the team.[42] The Bengals' fortunes changed for the worse as the team posted 14 consecutive non-winning seasons and were saddled with numerous draft busts. The Bengals began to emerge from that dismal period into a new era of increased consistency, however, after the team finished with its worst record in team history, 2–14, which led to the hiring of Marvin Lewis as head coach in 2003.[43] Carson Palmer, the future star quarterback, was drafted in 2003, but did not play a snap that whole season, as Jon Kitna had a comeback year (voted NFL Comeback Player of the Year).[44][45] Despite Kitna's success, Palmer was promoted to starting quarterback the following season.[46] The team finished with an 8–8 record and missed the postseason in 2004.[47] Under Palmer, the team advanced to the playoffs for the first time since 1990 losing in the Wild Card Roundto the Pittsburgh Steelers 31–17 in the 2005 season, which also was the first time the team had a winning percentage above .500 since 1990.[48][49][50] The Bengals returned to the playoffs again in 2009 in a season that included the franchise's first-ever division sweep. This was especially impressive since two of the teams swept by the Bengals – the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Baltimore Ravens – had made it to the AFC Championship Game the previous season. Marvin Lewis was rewarded for the accomplishment with the NFL Coach of the Year Award.[51] In the 2010 season, the Bengals posted a 4–12 record.[52] Following the disappointing 2010 season, quarterback Carson Palmer demanded to be traded. When the Bengals refused to do so, Palmer announced his retirement from the NFL.[53] He later was moved at the NFL trade deadline to the Oakland Raiders.[54] In the 2011 NFL draft, the Bengals selected wide receiver A. J. Green in the first round and quarterback Andy Dalton in the second round.[55] The Bengals improved to 9–7 in the 2011 season, and clinched a playoff spot.[56] Dalton and Green became the most prolific rookie WR-QB duo in history, connecting 65 times for 1,057 yards. However, they lost to the Houston Texans, 31–10, in the Wild Card round.[57] In the 2012 season, the Bengals clinched a playoff spot once more with a win over the Pittsburgh Steelers, going to the playoffs in back-to-back years for the first time since 1982.[58] However, the Bengals faced the Texans in the first round yet again and took another early exit, losing 19–13.[59] In the 2013 season, for the third straight year, the Bengals clinched a playoff berth and also won the AFC North, finishing with an 11–5 record.[60] But once again, the Bengals were defeated in the wild card round, this time by the San Diego Chargers, 27–10.[61] Most of the blame was put on Andy Dalton, who threw two interceptions and fumbled on a forward dive. This made the Bengals 0–5 in playoff games since Mike Brown took over as owner. The 2014 season started well, with the Bengals winning their first three contests against the Baltimore Ravens, Atlanta Falcons, and Tennessee Titans. However, they lost their Week 5 road matchup with the New England Patriots, 43–17. An overtime tie with the Carolina Panthers and a shutout loss to the Indianapolis Colts followed the primetime loss to the Patriots. Finishing the season 10–5–1 as the fifth seed, they lost to the Colts, 26–10, in the first round of the playoffs.[62][63] This was the first time the franchise made the playoffs four straight seasons. In 2015, the Bengals got out to a franchise-best 8–0 start with a 31–10 win over the Cleveland Browns.[64] Unfortunately, in Week 14 they would lose starting quarterback Andy Dalton to injury. He would not return that season, leaving A. J. McCarron to start under center. The Bengals finished with a franchise record-tying 12–4 mark.[65] Additionally, they lost to the division rival Pittsburgh Steelers, 18–16, in the Wild Card round in the final minute, making them the first franchise in NFL history to lose five straight opening-round playoff games.[66] This frustration continued in 2016 for the Bengals: they finished the 2016 campaign with a 6–9–1 record, losing several key players to injury, including A. J. Green, Giovani Bernard, and Jeremy Hill.[67][68] They missed the playoffs for the first time since 2010, marking the first time Andy Dalton missed the playoffs as the Bengals' starting quarterback. One notable game was a 27–27 tie against the Washington Redskins which was played in London in 2016.[69] Following a rough 2016 season, the Bengals looked forward into 2017. However, after starting 0–3, the Bengals never found their footing. At one point in the season, the Bengals were 5–9. There were rumors that Marvin Lewis would not return for the next season as the Bengals' head coach. However, after two come-from-behind victories over the Lions and Ravens that eliminated both teams from the playoffs, the Bengals finished 7–9.[70] The final two games were convincing enough for owner Mike Brown to give Lewis a new two-year contract.[71] The 2018 campaign began with promise for the Bengals under Lewis. Cincinnati began the season with a 4–1 record with impressive wins over the Colts, Ravens, Falcons, and Dolphins. However, the Bengals suffered many setbacks after the hot start: defensive coordinator Teryl Austin was fired mid-season because of defensive woes,[72] A. J. Green was injured and officially out for the last four games, and Andy Dalton injured his thumb in the Bengals' first game against the Browns and replaced by Jeff Driskel for the rest of the season.[73][74] The Bengals ended 2018 with a final record of 6–10 and finished last place in the AFC North.[75] On December 31, 2018, with one year to go on his contract, Lewis and the Bengals mutually parted ways after three straight losing seasons under his watch.[76] In 2019, they hired head coach Zac Taylor.[77] The 2019 campaign started off with reasonable success, with the Bengals barely losing to Seattle 21–20 at CenturyLink Field; but what started with promise ended in disaster.[78] The Bengals then lost 10 more games and were 0–11 heading into December 2019. To open the month of December, they got their first win of the season against the Jets, 22–6, in Cincinnati.[79] They eventually lost to the Patriots and then to the Dolphins, 38–35, in overtime after Dalton led the team back from 23 points down in the fourth quarter. With the loss to the Dolphins, the Bengals officially clinched the No. 1 overall pick in the 2020 NFL draft.[80] They capped off the season with a win against the Cleveland Browns, finishing 2–14, equaling the 2002 season as the team's worst record in history.[81][82] In 2020, the Bengals improved under rookies Joe Burrow and Tee Higgins.[83] Starting the season with a 2–5–1 record going into the bye week, including an overtime tie to the Philadelphia Eagles. Going into Week 11 facing the Washington Football Team, they lost Joe Burrow to a season-ending knee injury that all but ended their season, only winning two more contests against the Pittsburgh Steelers and Houston Texans.[84] Finishing the season 4–11–1.[85] In 2021, the Bengals won the AFC North with a 10–7 record, which included dominant sweeps of the rival Pittsburgh Steelers and Baltimore Ravens.[86] Led by Joe Burrow, who was playing in his first full season after recovering from his devastating knee injury in Week 11 of his rookie season and rookie receiver, and Burrow's college teammate at LSU, Ja'Marr Chase, Cincinnati would win the AFC North for the first time since 2015. They beat the Kansas City Chiefs, 34–31, in a Week 17 thriller to clinch the division. They then won their first playoff game since the 1990 season, beating the Las Vegas Raiders, 26–19, in the Wild Card round.[87] After that, they upset the top-seeded Tennessee Titans, 19–16, when Evan McPherson kicked a game-winning 52-yard field goal. A week later, they advanced to their first Super Bowl since 1989 when McPherson kicked a 33-yard field goal in overtime to cap off a comeback from being down 21–3 and shock the No. 2 seed Chiefs, 27–24. They lost a close Super Bowl to the Los Angeles Rams in Super Bowl LVI, 23–20.[88] In Week 1 of the 2022 NFL season, the Bengals lost, 23–20, to the Pittsburgh Steelers in overtime, breaking a three-game winning streak the Bengals had against Pittsburgh. After falling to a 4–4 record in Week 8, the Bengals proceeded to win 8 straight games to tie a franchise-record for single-season wins and earn a 3 seed in the AFC playoffs.[89][90] They defeated divisional rival Baltimore in the first round 24–17, behind a 98-yard fumble recovery returned for a touchdown by Sam Hubbard.[91][92] Despite missing three starting offensive linemen, the Bengals followed that up with a decisive 27–10 road win over the favored Buffalo Bills to reach a second straight AFC Championship appearance for the first time in franchise history.[93] Once again, they faced the Kansas City Chiefs in the Championship Game, but this time they lost 23–20, in another thrilling game.[94] In the 2023 season, during their Week 11 matchup against the Baltimore Ravens, Joe Burrow would suffer a wrist injury that would rule him out the rest of the season.[95] The consistent play of backup quarterback Jake Browning kept the Bengals alive in the postseason hunt after Burrow's injury.[96] The Bengals finished the season 9–8 and missed the playoffs.[97] When the team debuted in 1968, the Bengals' uniforms were modeled after the Cleveland Browns. When Paul Brown was fired by Art Modell, Brown still owned the equipment used by Cleveland, so after the firing, Paul Brown packed up all his equipment, which he then used for his new team in Cincinnati. The Cleveland Browns' team colors were brown, orange, and white, and their helmets were solid orange with a white dorsal stripe over the crest. The Bengals' team colors were orange, black, and white, and their helmets were a similar shade of orange, with the only variations being the word \"Bengals\" in black block letters (with a white outline) on either side of the helmet and no stripe on the helmet. The Cincinnati Bengals were unique in the NFL, as they did not have secondary uniform numbers on the jerseys (called \"TV numbers\") until they appeared on the sleeves in the 1980 season; they were the only NFL team that didn't have them prior to that point. That same year, the team changed their helmet face mask color from gray to black. The team did not discard their Cleveland-like uniforms until 1981. During that year, a then-unique uniform design was introduced: Although the team kept black jerseys, white jerseys, and white pants, they were now trimmed with orange and black tiger stripes. The team also introduced the orange helmets with black tiger stripes that are still in use today. Sports Illustrated likened the Bengals' new helmets to \"varicose pumpkins.\"[98] In 1997, the Bengals designed a logo consisting of a leaping tiger, and it was added to the uniform sleeves (with this, the TV numbers moved to the shoulder). Another alternate logo consisted of a Bengal's head facing to the left. However, the orange helmet with black tiger stripes continued to be the trademark. In 2004, a new tiger stripe pattern and more accents were added to the uniforms. The black jerseys now featured orange tiger-striped sleeves and white side panels, while the white jerseys began to use black tiger-striped sleeves and orange shoulders.[99] A new logo consisting of an orange \"B\" covered with black tiger stripes was introduced.[100] The team also started rotating black pants and debuted an alternate orange jersey, with white side panels and black tiger-striped sleeves. The Bengals have worn their black uniforms at home throughout their history, with some exceptions, such as the 1970 season, when the Bengals wore white at home for the entire season as well as most of the 1971 season (the Bengals were the first AFL team to wear white at home, as its rules required the home team to wear their dark jerseys, unlike the NFL, which allowed the home team choice of jersey color starting in 1964). Since 2005, the Bengals have worn white for September home games where the heat could become a factor. In 2016, the Bengals unveiled their all-white Color Rush alternate uniform, featuring black tiger stripes along the sleeves and pants. Orange was only used on the Nike mark, on the team logo, and as an outline color on the player's name.[101] The club announced a new uniform design on January 21, 2021. The new uniform design would be worn beginning with the 2021 NFL season.[102] The set retains the signature striped helmet, while simplifying the look by removing the side and shoulder panels, creating a new stripe pattern for the sleeves, getting rid of the number block shadow, and removing the stroke on the player's name. This set also puts the team's wordmark on the chest and lacks TV numbers on the sleeves. The shade of orange was changed, as well. The Bengals wore three different pants with this set: black pants with orange stripes, white pants with black stripes, and white pants with orange stripes. The white pants with black stripes were worn with the white jersey in 2021 playoff games at Tennessee and Kansas City. The white pants with orange stripes were worn with the black jersey in Super Bowl LVI against the Rams.[103] In 2022, after the NFL rescinded the \"one-helmet rule,\" the Bengals unveiled an alternate black-striped white helmet. In addition, the team brought back the all-white Color Rush uniform to be paired with the white helmets.[104][105] This would last one season, however, as the team decided to pair the white helmet with the primary white uniform for two games in 2023, effectively retiring the Color Rush uniform for the time being.[106] In 2024, the Bengals added orange pants to the uniform rotation after Madden NFL 25 leaked the option to the public.[107] The Bengals then unveiled a new all-orange uniform combination to be worn September 8 against the Patriots.[108] The team's official mascot is a Bengal tiger named Who Dey.[109] Its jersey number is 1.[110] Aside from Who Dey, the team also has the Ben-Gals, the team's cheerleading squad,[111] which included Laura Vikmanis, the oldest cheerleader in league history.[112] Carol Motsinger in 2015 said, \"In 2012, Cincinnati welcomed another tiger named Who Dey. This time, one that walks on four legs. More than 1,000 Bengals season ticket holders named a Malayan tiger Who Dey at Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Garden. He was recently traded to a zoo in Kansas.\"[113] The Ohio History Central notes: \"In 1940, a third American Football League formed, and the Cincinnati Bengals joined it. Unfortunately, World War II began the following year, causing manpower shortages as men joined the armed forces. This prompted this newer AFL to cease playing after the 1941 season. Paul Brown, former coach of the Cleveland Browns, received authorization from a modern American Football League to create a team in Cincinnati. Brown chose the name Bengals to memorialize the teams of the same name that had represented Cincinnati in the past.\"[114] The Bengals' historic rivalry with the Cleveland Browns is often referred to as the \"Battle of Ohio\", started as the result of former Browns head coach and team founder Paul Brown starting the Bengals franchise after leaving the Browns.[115] The colors of each team are similar since Paul Brown chose the exact shade of orange used by the Browns for the Bengals, and the Bengals' original uniforms were identical to the Browns' uniforms, excluding the word \"Bengals\" on the helmet. The rivalry reached its peak during the 1980s when both teams were vying viciously for a spot in the playoffs. During the 1990s the rivalry also butted heads when Brown's sons were in charge of the day-to-day operations of the Bengals.[116] The Bengals lead the series 53–48 as of the end of the 2023 season.[117] The Bengals and Pittsburgh Steelers have played each other twice a year since becoming division rivals in 1970. This rivalry has gained intensity since the 2000s, as the teams have met twice in the playoffs, with both games being marked by hard hits and injuries with the most infamous example occurring in the 2005 playoffs.[118][119][120] The Steelers lead the overall series 70–39 and the postseason series 2–0.[121] However, the Steelers have been more dominant recently, posting a record of 28–7 since 2004, when they drafted Roethlisberger. There were two times that the rivalry has met during the playoffs: the Wild Card rounds of 2005 and 2015, with the Steelers winning both meetings at Cincinnati. The 2005 game is marked as a special time in the rivalry because this is when Steelers defensive tackle Kimo Von Oelhoffen injured Bengals quarterback Carson Palmer,[122] while the 2015 game is also special because Bengals running back Jeremy Hill fumbled the ball in the waning minutes when the Bengals had a 16–15 lead over the Steelers to give the latter one last chance. They used that chance wisely as they drove down the field (with the help of two costly personal fouls by the Bengals) and kicked a game-winning field goal.[123] The Bengals' rivalry with the Baltimore Ravens began when the original Browns franchise relocated to Baltimore to become the Ravens. Since then, the rivalry heated up when longtime Ravens defensive coordinator Marvin Lewis was hired as the head coach of the Bengals. The Ravens lead the all-time series 30–27 as of the 2023 season.[124] The Bengals won the only playoff meeting in the 2022 AFC Wild Card round.[125] The Joe Burrow-led Bengals have developed a recent rivalry with the Kansas City Chiefs, with Burrow being the only AFC quarterback to date to hold a winning record against Mahomes.[126] As of the 2023 season, the Bengals lead the all-time series 18–16.[127] The Bengals have played the Titans more than any non-divisional opponent by a significant margin. The Titans lead the all-time series 41–37–1.[128] A no-huddle offense was commonly used by all teams when time in the game was running low. However, Sam Wyche, the head coach of the Bengals in 1988, along with offensive coordinator Bruce Coslet, made the high-paced offense the standard modality for the ball club regardless of time remaining. By quickly substituting and setting up for the next play—often within 5–10 seconds after the last play despite being afforded 45 seconds—the Bengals hindered the other team's defense from substituting situational players, regrouping for tactics, and resting. In response, the NFL instituted rules allowing the defense ample time for substitutions when offensive substitutions were made. The hurry-up tactic was used by the franchise during the late 1980s while Sam Wyche was the coach. A rival for AFC supremacy during this time was the Buffalo Bills, coached by Marv Levy, who also used a version of the no-huddle offense starting with the 1989 season. The Bengals had beaten the Bills three times in 1988 (pre-season, regular season, and the AFC Championship Game). Marv Levy threatened to fake injuries if the Bengals used the \"no-huddle\" in the AFC Championship. Wyche was notified that the commissioner had ordered the \"no-huddle\" illegal for the game. The official notified Wyche and the Bengals' team just two hours before the game kickoff.[129] Wyche asked to talk directly to the commissioner and word immediately came back that the \"no-huddle\" would not be penalized. Levy did not have his players' fake injuries in the game but installed his version the next year, 1989. The Bengals first used the \"no-huddle\" in 1984.[130] Most of the high-profile games (the various games for AFC titles and regular-season games) between the two led to these changes in NFL rules. Wyche also first used the timeout periods as an opportunity to bring his entire team to the sideline to talk to all eleven players, plus substitutes, at one time. This allowed trainers time to treat a cut or bruise and equipment managers time to repair an equipment defect. The West Coast offense is the popular name for the high-percentage passing scheme designed by former Bengals assistant Bill Walsh.[131] Walsh formulated what has become popularly known as the West Coast offense during his tenure as assistant coach for the Cincinnati Bengals from 1968 to 1975, while working under the tutelage of Brown (and before embarking on his legendary coaching tenure with the San Francisco 49ers in the 1980s). Bengals quarterback Virgil Carter was the first player to successfully implement Walsh's system, leading the NFL in pass completion percentage in 1971.[132] Ken Anderson replaced Carter as Cincinnati's starting quarterback in 1972 and was even more successful. In 1975 he would bring widespread recognition to the West Coast offense as well as to the Cincinnati team and its quarterback in a nationally televised Monday night contest between the Bengals and a Buffalo Bills team built around the running game of star player O. J. Simpson. Anderson's 447 passing yards were enough to overcome Simpson's 197 yards on the ground in a game that proved a milestone, providing a striking contrast between the \"old\" game of defense-minded football and the new game of higher scores and more action through a sophisticated aerial attack.[133] The game, in effect, offered its viewers a glimpse of the future of professional football. Anderson, who was drafted by Paul Brown in 1971 and installed as starting quarterback in 1972, made four trips to the Pro Bowl, won four passing titles, was named NFL MVP in 1981, and set the record for completion percentage in a single season in 1982 with 70.66%. Defeated frequently during the 1970s by the Pittsburgh Steelers, a team that won four Super Bowls with 9 future Hall of Fame players, the Bengals under Anderson and head coach Forrest Gregg would finally break through the Steel Curtain, defeating the Steelers during both of their meetings in 1980 and again in 1981. Anderson, who had been named the \"team franchise\" by Bengal tight end Bob Trumpy, would ultimately prove his worth with a career record of 91 wins and 81 losses.[134] The defense created to combat the West Coast offense also came from Cincinnati. Then-Bengals defensive coordinator Dick LeBeau (who later served as the team's head coach from 2000 to 2002) created the zone blitz in the 1980s in response to the West Coast offense.[135] Running backs (RB) Wide receivers (WR) Tight ends (TE) Defensive linemen (DL) Defensive backs (DB) Special teams Reserve 53 active, 14 reserve, 15 practice squad In addition, Despite not being formally retired, the Bengals have certain numbers that are in limited circulation: There are four members of the Hall of Fame that have spent some portion of their career with the Bengals, but only Anthony Muñoz and Ken Riley spent their entire playing careers with the Bengals. Listed below are only Hall of Famers whose induction includes their tenure with the Bengals. Bengals founder and first coach Paul Brown is in the Hall of Fame, but was inducted before founding the team and is not credited as a Bengals Hall of Famer. Additionally, the Bengals have had two head coaches, Forrest Gregg and Dick LeBeau inducted for their playing career. In 2007, in celebration of their 40th anniversary the Bengals named an all-time team voted on by the fans.[148] Source:[149] The Bengals announced they would begin a Ring of Honor in 2021.[150] The inaugural class included Pro Football Hall of Fame tackle Anthony Muñoz and Paul Brown, who was the franchise's founder and first coach,[151] with Ken Anderson and Ken Riley added after a season ticket holder vote.[152] *Posthumous induction → Coaching staff → Front office → More NFL staffs The Bengals contract with iHeartMedia as their radio partner,[153] with their flagship radio stations being WCKY (1530) and WEBN (102.7 FM), along with WLW (700) if not in conflict with the Reds.

It was written by Bengals entertainment director George \"Red\" Bird upon the team's founding in 1968. Bird had been friends with Paul Brown for over 30 years. The two had met at Massillon Washington High School when Brown was head football coach and Bird was director of the famed Massillon Tiger Swing Band. Bird had served as the Browns' music and entertainment director in 1946, and kept that role until Brown convinced him to come to Cincinnati in 1968. His first task was to pen a fight song along the lines of the Browns' fight song, \"Hi! O-Hi-O for Cleveland!\" The song remains very popular among Bengals fans, who are known to belt out the song at \"Bengals backer\" bars all over the country. In 2021, Elizabeth Blackburn, now the team's head of strategy and fan engagement, told The Athletic recalled stopping at one such bar in San Francisco during the 2015 playoffs, and was surprised to hear the viewers break out into the song. As a measure of how popular the song remains among the Bengals fan base, when Blackburn wrote an editorial on her efforts to overhaul the team's image for the Bengals Web site, Blackburn specifically mentioned that the song was not going anywhere.[156] \"Welcome to the Jungle\" is also a fight song for the Bengals.[157][158] The song is mainly played before kick-offs to intimidate visiting teams. \"Who Dey?!\" is the name of a chant of support by fans of the Cincinnati Bengals, in use since the 1980s. The entire chant is: \"Who dey, who dey, who dey think gonna beat dem Bengals?\"[159] The answer screamed in unison, \"Nobody.\" Sometimes fans will instead shout \"Who Dey?\" to represent the entire cheer. \"Who Dey\" is also the name of the team's mascot, a Bengal tiger.[110] Saying \"Who Dey\" at Bengals games is steeped in local beer lore. Hudy, a leading product of Hudepohl Brewing Company 1978 through the late 1980s, bears a phonetic similarity to the \"Who Dey\" chant. Beer vendors who carried full cases of bottled local beer up and down the steep upper stairs of what was then Riverfront Stadium would call out \"If Hudy\", \"Burger\" and other local beer names. Raucous fans would often chant back and forth with them as the vendors called out. During the 1980 season, the banter with the Hudepohl vendors grew organically into the now famous (Hu-Dey) -Who They?- chant.[160] The full Who Dey chant was first known to be used by fans of the 1980 Cincinnati Bengals.[161] While the origin of the chant is disputed, one possible source for the chant is a 1980 commercial for (the now-defunct) Red Frazier Ford of Cincinnati, which used this tagline: \"Who's going to give you a better deal than Red Frazier?...Nobody!\" Cincinnati fans who had seen the commercial many times may have just copied it when cheering.[162] The chant bears some similarities to the phrase \"Who Dat?\", which was officially adopted by the New Orleans Saints in 1983 but had been used by Louisiana's high school team fans for some time. The saying \"Who Dat?\" originated in minstrel shows and vaudeville acts in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, then it was taken up by New Orleans Jazz and various Big band folks in the 1920s and 1930s. In the late 1960s, local Louisiana High Schools, St. Augustine High School and Patterson High School reportedly have been using the cheer and Gulf Coast fans of Alcorn State University and Louisiana State University picked up the cheer in the 1970s. Southern University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana claims to have originated the cheer in the late 1960s in their version: \"Who dat talking 'bout beating dem Jags?\"[163]",
