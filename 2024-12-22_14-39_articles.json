                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) Patrick Mahomes knew he could run on the ankle he sprained last week. The bigger concern for the Chiefs quarterback was how he would stop, when all the weight and pressure and momentum would land squarely upon it. The solution against Houston was simple: Mahomes didn't stop. The two-time MVP kept chugging forward until he plowed into the end zone on a 15-yard scramble to cap the Chiefs' opening drive on Saturday. Mahomes proceeded to throw for 260 yards and another score, never once looking troubled by his ailing ankle, and led Kansas City to a 27-19 victory that put the Chiefs on the brink of the No. 1 seed in the AFC playoffs. The Chiefs (14-1) can clinch the postseason bye and home-field advantage if Buffalo loses to or ties New England on Sunday. If the Bills win, Kansas City can wrap it up by beating Pittsburgh on Christmas Day - its third game in an 11-day span. “I ask a lot from the guys around me. I feel like if I'm going to ask them to play through pain and nicks and bruises, I've got to do it as well,” Mahomes said. “That's something that I pride myself on is being out there with my guys.” Xavier Worthy had seven catches for 65 yards and a touchdown, Kareem Hunt ran for 55 yards and another score, and Marquise Brown had five catches for 45 yards for Kansas City in his first game this season after recovering from a shoulder injury. The result was what Chiefs coach Andy Reid called his team's most comprehensive performance of the season. As for Mahomes? “He spoils the dog out of us, he's so tough,” Reid said. “You get used to it. But most guys don't come back from that like he did.” C.J. Stroud threw for 244 yards and two touchdowns with two interceptions for Houston (9-6), and one of those TD throws came at a great expense. Tank Dell, who had six catches for 98 yards, sustained a devastating knee injury on the play and was taken to the University of Kansas Medical Center, where Texans coach DeMeco Ryans said he would remain overnight. “All our thoughts and prayers are with Tank right now. You see what he means to our entire team,” Ryans said. “It hurts to see him go down like that. He was having a fantastic game, playing really well for us.” Stroud was visibly shaken by the injury and had to be consoled by teammates on the sideline. “I mean, all you can really do is pray,” he said. There were questions early in the week about whether Mahomes, who has a history of ankle injuries, would play at all after he sustained a high ankle sprain late in last week's win over Cleveland. But he was off the injury report by Friday, and he was on the field and leading the Chiefs to a touchdown on their opening possession. His scramble for a score was merely the start of a back-and-forth first half. The Texans answered with a 33-yard field goal, then went on a 13-play, 82-yard drive that ended with Stroud's touchdown toss to Dalton Schutlz. But the Chiefs quickly regained the lead when Hunt barreled into the end zone, and they tacked on a field goal a few minutes later after Stroud's second interception to lead 17-10 at the break. Dell was hurt on the Texans' opening drive of the third quarter. He was coming across the back of the end zone and made a spectacular catch but collided with teammate Jared Wayne on his way to the ground. He immediately grabbed his left knee, and players from both teams surrounded him as he was loaded onto a cart and driven from the field. Ka'imi Fairbairn promptly missed the extra point, and any momentum Houston might've had disappeared. Kansas City marched the other way, relying heavily on Worthy, who touched the ball four times on the drive. The first-round pick finished it off with an 8-yard reception, giving him a season high for receiving yards and his eighth touchdown of the year. The teams matched fourth-quarter field goals, and the Texans took over trailing 27-19 with just over five minutes to go. But the Chiefs forced a three-and-out, getting a sack from Josh Williams on a cornerback blitz, and ran out the clock from there. “This was a great test versus a really good playoff team,” Ryans said. “This was a playoff atmosphere here today. I thought our guys battled the right way. We just have to finish.” Pop star Taylor Swift was on hand for the Chiefs' regular-season finale. She has been spending more time with her boyfriend, Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, in Kansas City since she wrapped up her Eras Tour on Dec. 8 in Vancouver, British Columbia, including making a surprise visit to Children's Mercy Hospital. Houston: OG Shaq Mason (left knee) left on the fourth play of the game. FS Jimmie Ward (foot) was hurt late in the first half. Kansas City: LB Jack Cochrane fractured his ankle on special teams in the first quarter. RT Jawaan Taylor (knee) left in the third quarter and DT Chris Jones sustained a minor calf strain in the fourth.

                "title": "Chiefs vs. Texans score, takeaways: Patrick Mahomes looks like himself as Kansas City wins another close game - CBSSports.com",
                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. The Kansas City Chiefs maintained their hold on the AFC's top seed by securing yet another one-score victory, extending their NFL record to 16 games by defeating the visiting Houston Texans by a score of 27-19. The Chiefs got things started early by picking off C.J. Stroud on Houston's opening drive. Just in case anyone thought Patrick Mahomes would be limited by the high ankle sprain he suffered last week, he quickly quieted those concerns with a pair of scrambles on the Chiefs' first possession, with the second of those runs starting the scoring as he scored a touchdown from 15 yards out. The Texans would eventually answer back and actually take a 10-7 lead after Stroud found Dalton Schultz for a touchdown early in the second quarter, but Kansas City immediately answered with a Kareem Hunt touchdown run, another interception on Stroud and then a late-half field goal to take a seven-point lead into halftime. The Texans forced a punt on the opening drive of the second half and actually looked like they were about to tie the game when Stroud lofted a beautiful pass to Tank Dell in the back of the end zone, but Dell suffered a gruesome injury on the play and, after a long delay, Ka'imi Fairbairn missed the extra point. That one-point deficit was the closest Houston would get the rest of the afternoon. Even after Kansas City turned it over on downs near midfield, the Texans were unable to take advantage; and the Chiefs drove down the field for an Xavier Worthy touchdown on their next drive. After the two teams traded field goals, the Texans had a chance to drive for a game-tying score late in the fourth quarter, but went nowhere after Stroud got dropped for a sack on third-and-long. All Kansas City had to do after that was run out the clock, which it did with a series of runs and short passes. Standard Chiefs stuff in another standard Chiefs win in what is looking a lot like a standard Chiefs season in the Mahomes-Andy Reid era. Strong game-planning, Mahomes magic and timely turnovers. Kansas City's offensive line has struggled all season, and Andy Reid devised a game plan to account for that. Mahomes repeatedly fired quick passes to Xavier Worthy and DeAndre Hopkins, and Travis Kelce repeatedly sat himself down in underneath zones. Mahomes was under pressure often, but only sacked once. The defense, meanwhile, came up with a pair of interceptions to bookend the first half, setting up the offense to score 10 free points. Major miscues in big moments, and a defense that just couldn't get the big stop. Houston ended its first drive of the game and its last drive of the first half with interceptions. Ka'imi Fairbairn missed an extra point. C.J. Stroud took not one but two delay-of-game penalties in the second half. Dalton Schultz dropped what should have been a third-down conversion late in the third quarter. Offensive coordinator Bobby Slowik kept calling wide receiver screens that went nowhere. Meanwhile, the Chiefs converted 7 of 13 third downs and 3 of their 4 red zone opportunities into touchdowns, while Houston went just 1 of 3 in the red zone. Late in the second quarter, the Texans had a chance to take the lead -- or at least cut into Kansas City's advantage. They quickly got into Chiefs territory before things started going awry. Tank Dell was called for offensive pass interference on a swing pass on first down, setting the Texans back behind the chains. Two incomplete passes later and it was third-and-20 from Kansas City's 40-yard line. The Texans were in Ka'imi Fairbairn's range, so when C.J. Stroud saw quick pressure, he tried to throw the ball away to preserve a shot at a field goal. But his throwaway didn't actually go away. Instead, it landed in the waiting arms of Trent McDuffie. Instead of having a chance to take a lead for themselves, the Texans were left defending against the Chiefs extending theirs. They buckled down once Kansas City got just outside the red zone, but the Chiefs took a 17-10 lead into halftime and never trailed again. The best play of the day was Tank Dell's 30-yard touchdown grab in the third quarter, but Dell unfortunately suffered a gruesome knee injury on the play. (If you really want to watch it, you can do so right here.) So instead, we'll go with the game's first touchdown, where we saw pretty early on that Patrick Mahomes' ankle was just fine. Mere days after suffering a high ankle sprain, Mahomes had two big scrambles on Kansas City's opening drive, including the one above. He ended the afternoon with three carries for 35 yards and the score, helping move the chains for the Chiefs several times. Kansas City is 14-1 and remains the No. 1 seed in the AFC. The Chiefs have long since clinched the AFC West and have the inside track for home-field advantage throughout the AFC playoffs. Next up for K.C. is a Christmas Day game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, followed by a trip to Denver to take on the Broncos in Week 18. The Texans are now 9-6 and looking like they will be the No. 4 seed in the AFC. They're already AFC South champions, but they've likely fallen too far behind the AFC North winner to move up to No. 3 in the conference. They close out their season by hosting the Baltimore Ravens on Christmas, then traveling to Tennessee to take on the Titans in Week 18. That'll do it, folks. The Chiefs can now kneel on the ball and run out the clock. ANOTHER one-score win for the Chiefs, who will move to 14-1. A first-down run for negative yards set the Texans back on their game-tying drive attempt. (What else is new?) And then Stroud fired a ball out of bounds under heavy pressure, then took a third-down sack with Joshua Williams coming unblocked blitzing off the edge. K.C. has a chance to potentially run the clock out here. No Chris Jones out there for the Chiefs defense on this drive. He's questionable to return with a calf injury. Mahomes tried to fire the ball back across his body to Kelce in the back of the end zone, but Worthy didn't see Kelce behind him and tried to catch it himself. The ball bounced off his hands and fell incomplete, so Harrison Butker knocked a field goal through the uprights to make it an 8-point game once again. Houston has just over 5 minutes to drive for a potential game-tying score. Houston again drove into Kansas City territory, but again had issues with negative plays. A first-down run was tackled behind the line of scrimmage. A C.J. Stroud scramble turned into a sack. And Stroud took his second delay-of-game penalty of the half. The Texans ended up settling for a field goal to make it a 5-point game. Yet another one-possession game for both the Chiefs and Texans, who have each been great in close contests this year. Fourth quarter coming up. This is Worthy's best game of the year, in terms of his overall level of involvement in the offense. He just picked up his seventh catch of the game, and this one goes for a touchdown. (He also has three carries.) Chiefs up by 8 after the extra point. Perfect ball from Stroud to Schultz on third down but Schultz just straight dropped it. Worth nothing, Stroud and Dell connected on the exact same throw in the exact same situation earlier in the game. Kansas City had excellent field position after a great kick return following the Dell touchdown, but Isaiah Pacheco's three carries totaled -1 yard and he was stuffed for no gain on fourth-and-1. Texans take over in Chiefs territory now with a chance to re-take the lead. Dell's fractured leg came on Dec. 3 of last year. He also suffered a gunshot wound this offseason after a stray bullet went through his leg when he was an innocent bystander. And now this knee injury. So horrible for such a talented, electrifying player. You can see how bad it is by looking at Stroud and Collins, who are absolutely distraught. What an awful, awful scene. The cart is out for Dell and he's being taken to the locker room. Ugh. Oh no. Tank Dell just made a fantastic touchdown catch in the back of the end zone, for arguably his best catch of the year. More than likely ties the game for Houston after the extra point. But in the process, he took a hit to the outside of his knee, which bent in the wrong direction. He knew immediately after he went down that it was a problem. Remember, he fractured his leg at the end of last season as well. Y-I-K-E-S. The Texans just burned a timeout on their second play of the half, after an incomplete pass. That is really, really bad -- especially when you're in a one-score game against the Chiefs, on the road. Kamari Lassiter ALMOST picked off Patrick Mahomes. Great play to dive and get his hands on the ball on the crossing route intended for Worthy, who had a step of separation. Both Worthy and Dell are on the sideline with their teams to start the second half and look like they're ready to go. The Chiefs took advantage of Stroud's second turnover of the game by scoring for a second time. 10 points off turnovers for the Chiefs. And they get the ball to start the second half with a chance to make this a two-score game. Not ideal for the Chiefs. Worthy has been extremely involved so far today, with 4 catches and 2 rushing attempts. It looked like he fell while running his route before limping to the sideline. KC's wide receiver corps has been banged up all season. Update: Worthy is QUESTIONABLE to return with an ankle injury. Whoo boy. Really bad decision and throw from Stroud on this third-and-20. He was under heavy pressure and tried to jump and just get rid of the ball to avoid a sack, but instead threw it right into Trent McDuffie's arms. Big time missed opportunity for Houston. And now Dell just got called for a seemingly phantom offensive pass interference, then went to the bench to get checked out with some sort of injury. He threw his helmet towards a trainer, which doesn't seem great. Update: Dell is back after missing one snap. Tank Dell already has 5 catches. He only had four entire games with 5 catches coming into today. And his 68 yards are already his third-most of the season. After a 13-play, 82-yard drive, Kansas City has the lead back. The Chiefs converted four third-down opportunities on the drive, which Kareem Hunt polished off with a 3-yard touchdown run. KC gets the ball coming out in the third quarter, so the Texans will want to put some points on the board here to prevent a double-up opportunity. VERY bad injury news for the Texans. Ward has been a key player in the secondary all season, moving between safety and the slot. He got his ankle rolled up while trying to shake a block from Travis Kelce. Wow, a HUGE swing right there. Not only does a review overturn the Mahomes fumble that resulted in a scoop-and-score; because the play was ruled a pass, Tim Settle got called for roughing the passer and gave Kansas City a free 15 yards. Hollywood Brown has now played five snaps (all passing plays) and has two catches for 32 yards. Really nice job by C.J. Stroud to buy some time in the pocket here by rolling out to his right and drafting just a little bit backward. Dalton Schultz kind of tossed Trent McDuffie aside and freed himself up in the middle of the end zone for the touchdown. Nice bounceback by the Texans after the early interception and subsequent touchdown drive. They're now up 10-7. (Schultz probably could've been called for OPI, and there was probably a hold that prevented George Karlaftis from getting to Stroud, too.) Stroud is bailing the Texans out of some tough third downs. Three conversions already on this drive. Things looked really discombobulated for a minute on third-and-medium for the Texans, but Stroud and Collins bailed them out. Stroud was under heavy pressure and just floated the ball into open space before Collins even made his break, and Collins made a great adjustment to get to the ball and then create some yards after the catch. Really well-designed blitz from DeMeco Ryans to get a Christian Harris sack on second down. He came totally unblocked through the middle of the line. That sent KC's drive back and Mahomes just checked it down to Travis Kelce for a short gain on third down. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

                "content": "Editions: En/nfl Even injured, the Chiefs QB contributed a touchdown on the ground in his team's victory. Patrick Mahomes doesn't let anything stop him. With an injury slowing him down, the Kansas City Chiefs quarterback led his team to a 27-19 victory over the Houston Texans, getting closer to securing home-field advantage for the entire NFL playoffs. Much was said during the week about the injury that Mahomes suffered last week in the game against the Cleveland Browns. While his detractors claimed that he was faking the injury, some analysts considered that head coach Andy Reid should not risk him in the game against the Texans. When the day came, Mahomes jumped onto the field and not only that, he even had the luxury of a personal 15-yard touchdown run in the first quarter. Mahomes finished the game with 28 completions on 41 attempts, 260 yards, and a touchdown pass. After his run to the end zone in the first quarter, Mahomes completed an eight-yard touchdown pass to Xavier Worthy in the third quarter. Running back Kareem Hunt added another score with a three-yard run in the second quarter and Harrison Butker hit field goals of 44 and 27 yards. The Texans fought for most of the game. C.J. Stroud completed two end zone passes, the first of 10 yards to Dalton Schultz in the second quarter and the second of 30 to Tank Dell in the third. Ka'imi Fairbairn hit field goals of 33 and 18 yards, and missed the extra point on the second touchdown. Stroud completed 23 of 38 for 244 yards, two touchdown passes and two interceptions. The Chiefs improved to 14-1 and are better than ever in the AFC West, while the Texans fell to 9-6, still locked into first place in the AFC South. Kansas City has a tough season finale on the road, facing the Pittsburgh Steelers in Week 17 and the Denver Broncos in Week 18. Houston, meanwhile, hosts the Baltimore Ravens and visits the Tennessee Titans, in that order, to close out its regular season. Both teams have secured their respective division titles and, with them, their tickets to the postseason; however, we can still expect a thrilling end to the regular season, with the Chiefs and Texans fine-tuning the details for a deep playoff run. © Unidad Editorial Información Deportiva, S.L.U.

He is best known for portraying Rafael Solano on the CW satirical telenovela Jane the Virgin (2014–2019) as well as directing the romance drama films Five Feet Apart (2019), Clouds (2020) and It Ends with Us (2024).[2] Baldoni was born in Los Angeles, California, and was raised in Medford, Oregon, the son of Sharon and Sam Baldoni.[3] His mother is from a Jewish family,[4] and his father is of Italian ancestry. His paternal grandfather is Louis Baldoni, an Indiana senator and Italian immigrant.[5] Baldoni's parents joined the Baháʼí Faith, which Baldoni practices devoutly.[6][7] Baldoni played soccer and ran track in high school, and was a radio disc jockey at a local top-40 radio station. While moving into a new apartment building, Baldoni met a manager who advised him to pursue a career in acting.[8] He attended college on a partial athletic scholarship, but later dropped out.[9] Baldoni made his acting debut in the soap opera The Young and the Restless in 2004. In 2008, Baldoni wrote, produced, and directed his first music video that was selected and won him his first \"Audience Choice Award\" at Dawn Breakers International Film Festival.[10] In 2012, Baldoni created a digital documentary series, My Last Days, a show about living—as told by the dying.[11][12] The show eventually became one of the most-watched YouTube documentary series streamed online.[13] The second season of My Last Days aired on CW and third season was released in the winter of 2018. On the heels of that success Baldoni founded Wayfarer Entertainment, a digital media studio focused on disruptive inspiration.[14] In December 2018, Baldoni spoke at the annual End Well Symposium about why he believes that thinking about our death can help us live better.[15] From 2014 to 2019, Baldoni played Rafael Solano in the CW satirical telenovela Jane the Virgin starring opposite Gina Rodriguez.[16] In May 2016 he launched a time-lapse video app for pregnant women and new moms called Belly Bump.[17] In 2018 he played a young Barry Minkow in the crime drama Con Man, directed by Bruce Caulk. Baldoni directed and produced CBS Films' Five Feet Apart, starring Cole Sprouse and Haley Lu Richardson, and based on an original script by Mikki Daughtry and Tobias Iaconis. The film was released on March 15, 2019, and chronicles the lives of two teenagers living with cystic fibrosis.[18] The film was a financial success but received mixed reviews.[19][20] The following year he directed and produced Clouds, a film depicting the life of musician Zach Sobiech with Warner Bros.[21][22] On May 14, 2020, it was announced Disney+ had acquired distribution rights to the film from Warner Bros., in light of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the film industry. It was released on October 16, 2020.[23] In 2024 Baldoni directed, produced, and starred in the romantic drama It Ends with Us, based on Colleen Hoover's novel of the same name.[24] In the film, in which he acted opposite Blake Lively, Baldoni portrays a neurosurgeon who is a domestic abuser. The film bacame a box office hit, earning over $350 million, but it received mixed reviews from critics.[25][26] Baldoni and Lively had a combative working relationship on the set, with Lively accusing him of sexually harassing her and creating a toxic workplace environment. When The New York Times investigated the incident, it revealed private messages from Baldoni that suggested a smear campaign against her. Baldoni hired a PR crisis firm in order to \"bury her\" through social media platforms such as Tiktok, reddit, and X after Lively accused him of misconduct.[27] In July 2017, Variety announced that Baldoni was developing a male talk show through his media company Wayfarer Entertainment. The show, entitled Man Enough, is described as a disruptive panel series that explores what it means to be a man today.[28] In an interview, Baldoni described the reason he created the show. \"Man Enough really came about because I wanted to take a dive into what it really means to be a man, and this question of 'do we have it right?'\"[29] The show includes men like Matt McGorry and Javier Muñoz.[30] In August 2017, TED announced Baldoni would be a speaker at the annual TEDWomen Conference.[31] In 2021, Baldoni released a book under the same premise as his previous talk show and TED Talk titled Man Enough: Undefining My Masculinity.[32] He began a podcast series under the same name with co-hosts Liz Plank and Jamey Heath. A children's version of the book Boys Will Be Human was released in October 2022.[33] Baldoni co-founded a production company called Wayfarer Entertainment that produces television, films, and digital content. In 2019, Wayfarer sold a majority stake in the company to investment fund 4S Bay Partners, setting up a $25 million content fund,[34][35] and was renamed Wayfarer Studios in 2020.[36] The philanthropic branch of the company, called the Wayfarer Foundation, benefits homeless residents of Los Angeles.[37] They host an annual Skid Row Carnival of Love, which provides resources for employment, education, non-emergency medical care, food, clothing, hygiene, and other festivities such as face-painting, live concerts, and children's activities, serving over 4,000 homeless guests each year.[38] After almost two years of dating, Baldoni married Swedish actress Emily Fuxler, now known as Emily Baldoni, in July 2013 in Corona, California.[39] They have a daughter[40] and a son.[41] Baldoni has stated that he has ADHD.[42][43] In December 2024, Blake Lively sued Baldoni, with whom she co-starred in It Ends with Us (2024), for sexual harassment and for causing her family \"severe emotional distress\". According to the suit, Lively claimed she was in a hostile work environment. Lively and her husband, Ryan Reynolds, had sit-down meetings with Wayfarer Studios to address their demands of Baldoni, which were reported to include \"not showing nude videos or images of women to Lively; no more mentions of Baldoni's alleged previous 'pornography addiction'; no more discussions about sexual experiences in front of Lively and others; no further mentions of cast and crew's genitalia; and no more inquiries about Lively's weight.\"[44][45] Baldoni has denied the accusations.[46] In response to the allegations the talent agency WME dropped Baldoni as a client.[47]",

                "content": "Nathaniel Jasper \"Tank\" Dell Jr. (born October 29, 1999) is an American professional football wide receiver for the Houston Texans of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at Alabama A&M, Independence Community College, and Houston. Dell attended Mainland High School in Daytona Beach, Florida.[1] He had originally committed to Florida International University (FIU) to play college football but attended Alabama A&M University instead.[2][3] After one year at Alabama A&M in which he had 12 receptions for 364 yards and three touchdowns, he transferred to Independence Community College.[4] In his lone year at Independence, he had 52 receptions for 766 yards and eight touchdowns.[5][1] Dell transferred to the University of Houston in 2020.[6] In his first year at Houston, he led the team with 29 receptions for 428 yards and three touchdowns over eight games.[7] In 2021, he again led the team with 90 receptions for 1,329 yards with 12 touchdowns.[8][9] He returned to Houston as the number one receiver in 2022, during which he made 100 receptions for 1,398 receiving yards and 17 receiving touchdowns in only 13 games played. Dell was drafted by the Houston Texans in the third round, 69th overall, of the 2023 NFL draft.[12] In Week 11 against the Arizona Cardinals, Dell caught a career-high eight passes for a career-high 149 yards, and one touchdown.[13] In Week 13 against the Denver Broncos, Dell suffered a fractured fibula and was ruled out for the rest of the season. He went under surgery to repair the fibula the next day.[14][15] He finished the season with 47 catches for 709 yards and seven touchdowns, which was among the rookie leaders at the time of the injury.[16] In Week 9 of the 2024 season, against the New York Jets, Dell had six receptions for 126 yards in the 21–13 loss.[17] In Week 15 of the 2024 season against the Kansas City Chiefs, Tank suffered a season ending knee injury after catching a touchdown pass from C.J. Stroud after being fallen on by Jared Wayne. On April 27, 2024, Dell sustained minor injuries from a shooting in Sanford, Florida. He was released from the hospital the next day.[18]",

                "content": "Estimated read time: 4-5 minutes KANSAS CITY, Mo. — Texans wide receiver Tank Dell was taken to the University of Kansas Medical Center and the team said he would remain overnight after sustaining a severe left knee injury while making a 30-yard touchdown catch in a 27-19 loss to the Chiefs on Saturday. Dell was coming across the back of the end zone and made a spectacular catch on a pass from C.J. Stroud before colliding with Houston teammate Jared Wayne on the way to the ground. Dell immediately grabbed at his knee and Wayne signaled for team trainers, who spent several minutes working on the wide receiver while teammates waited anxiously. Dell was eventually placed on a stretcher and driven in a covered medical cart off the field, and then he was taken to the hospital. \"We'll get an update (Monday) on him,\" Texans coach DeMeco Ryans said. \"All of our thoughts and prayers are with Tank right now. You see what he means to our entire team. It hurts to see him go down like that. He was having a fantastic game.\" Dell had six catches for 98 yards and the touchdown when he was hurt with 11:40 left in the third quarter. Stroud, who is one of Dell's closest friends, was visibly shaken. He had tears in his eyes as he watched Dell get loaded onto the cart, and Stroud was still getting consoled by teammates when he walked back to the Houston sideline. \"It's not easy to just let it go, especially (because) that's my best friend. It's not easy to move on and keep playing,\" Stroud said. \"I tried to do the best I could. My teammates helped me up. I appreciate the guys talking to me as I was going through it.\" The touchdown should have tied the game, but Ka'imi Fairbairn missed the ensuing extra point. The Chiefs took advantage of the momentum swing and marched 80 yards for a touchdown and a 24-16 lead, and they put away the game from there. \"You see your brother go down and get hurt that way, it's hard to bounce back,\" Ryans said. \"You see him and how distraught he was, it's hard to bounce back. It's hard to rebound, because we care about each other. It's not just about getting back to football. We truly care about each other, and in that moment, the most important thing was making sure that Tank was OK.\" It's the second straight year Dell has sustained what is certain to be a season-ending injury. He fractured his fibula in Week 13 against the Broncos last season, just as the rookie was breaking out, and had surgery on it the following day. Then in April, the 25-year-old wide receiver was an innocent bystander at a private event in Sanford, Florida, when he sustained a minor gunshot wound. Dell spent a brief amount of time in the hospital but was able to return to Houston soon afterward. \"He loves this game so much. I don't think that's much of a question,\" Texans receiver Xavier Hutchinson said. \"He's going to fight back. He's going to come back even stronger, like he did this year. It's only a matter of time.\" Dell was the second Texans player carted off Saturday. Free safety Jimmie Ward hurt his foot late in the first half. Earlier in the game, the Texans' banged-up offensive line lost starting guard Shaq Mason to a knee injury on the fourth play, and backup lineman Blake Fisher had to be helped off with an undisclosed injury later in the first half. Their injuries came after Juice Scruggs, another starter on the offensive line, was declared inactive because of a foot injury. Kansas City also sustained some significant injuries on a chilly, wind-swept Saturday. The biggest was to defensive tackle Chris Jones, who was unable to finish after straining a calf. Chiefs coach Andy Reid would not say whether he thought the two-time All-Pro would be able to play against Pittsburgh on Christmas Day. Chiefs right tackle Jawaan Taylor did not return after straining his knee, while backup linebacker Jack Cochrane is likely done for the season after he fractured his ankle while blocking on a special teams early in the game. ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",

Take a look at the best stats from an epic bout as Oleksandr Usyk retained his heavyweight championship with a unanimous decision win over Tyson Fury. (1:17) For a second consecutive time, Oleksandr Usyk defeated Tyson Fury, this time by unanimous decision (116-112, 116-112, 116-112), to retain his WBC, WBO and WBA heavyweight world titles on Saturday in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The fight was a rematch of Usyk's split decision victory over Fury in May. Fury was ahead on two scorecards after eight rounds (77-75, 77-75 and 76-76) in that fight, but Usyk knocked down Fury in Round 9 and won the next two rounds to move ahead on two scorecards and win 115-112, 114-113 and 113-114. That victory crowned Usyk the first undisputed heavyweight champion in the four-belt era. Usyk (23-0, 14 KOs), 37, of Crimea, Ukraine, is a former undisputed cruiserweight champion. He moved up to the heavyweight division in 2019, and he has amassed seven consecutive victories, including a unanimous decision against Anthony Joshua to capture the WBO, WBA and IBF titles in 2021. He then defeated Joshua again in the rematch 11 months later to retain the belts. Fury (34-2-1, 24 KOs), 36, of Manchester, England, last won in a lackluster performance against former UFC champion Francis Ngannou in a boxing match in October 2023.

Pedri scored for Barcelona. In an emotional clash, Atlético de Madrid stunned FC Barcelona with a last-minute comeback (1-2) in Matchday 18 of LaLiga. The winning goal came in the 96th minute from Alexander Sorloth, who capitalized on a counterattack to give the Colchoneros their twelfth consecutive win, while also snatching the top spot in the league from Barça, who now sit in second place. Barcelona's Dominance and Football’s Justice From the start, FC Barcelona dominated the game, with Pedri pulling the strings in midfield and a fluid style of play creating several clear chances. The pressure from Raphinha and his crosses for Lewandowski continuously troubled the Atlético defense, who struggled to maintain possession. In the 30th minute, Barcelona's dominance paid off when Pedri combined with Gavi and scored the opening goal with a precise cross-shot. Despite Barcelona’s control, Atlético stayed afloat thanks to Jan Oblak's key interventions and Barcelona’s inability to capitalize on important moments. The team led by Xabi Flick failed to make the most of their superiority, missing clear chances such as Raphinha's crossbar or Fermín’s missed one-on-one opportunity. Atlético's Comeback The second half began with more opportunities for Barça, but it was Atlético who took their first clear chance in the 61st minute. A pass from Julián Álvarez to Rodrigo De Paul, who curled in a stunning goal from outside the box, equalized the score. Although Barcelona tried to regain control with the introduction of Dani Olmo, their chances continued to be squandered. In the final minutes, Oblak kept his team alive with key saves against Olmo, Raphinha, and Pedri. However, football had one last surprise in store: in the 96th minute, Raphinha lost possession of the ball, and Atlético launched a deadly counterattack, which Sorloth finished off to score the winner, sending the Atlético bench into a frenzy. A Bitter End for Barcelona Atlético de Madrid took the three points and now leads LaLiga with 41 points, while FC Barcelona drops to second place with 38 points. The Blaugrana end the year on a sour note, having earned only five points from their last seven matches after having a substantial lead at the top of the table. With this result, Atlético Madrid climbs to the top of La Liga, taking the first spot from Barcelona with 41 points, while Barcelona drops to second with 38 points. DOWNLOAD OUR APPS",

The seismic moment in the Spanish title race was also a historic one, representing the first-ever league win for Diego Simeone at Barcelona and marking the first time since 2006 that Atletico Madrid secured a La Liga victory on the road against the Catalan giants. Barcelona dominated nearly the entire match from an attacking perspective and, as Pedri scored with half an hour played, it seemed a harbinger of yet another painful reminder of Atleti's woes in their City of Horrors. Simeone's side were under siege the entire first 45 minutes, failing to produce a single shot before the break. MORE: A closer look at the insane streaks that ended when Barcelona fell to Atletico Madrid As the second half began, little changed, and it seemed the visitors were helpless to stop history repeating itself yet again. Even after Rodrigo de Paul equalized against the run of play in the 60th minute, it felt only a matter of time that Barcelona would re-establish their earlier lead. Yet when Robert Lewandowski inexplicably missed a sitter with 15 minutes to go, hope began to creep in for Atletico Madrid. Then, in the 97th minute, super-sub Alexander Sorloth completed a venomous counter-attack and plunged a dagger into Barcelona hearts. It sent Atletico Madrid top of the Spanish top flight table on 12 consecutive wins across all competitions, while Barcelona have now won just one of their past seven in La Liga play, including back-to-back defeats.

But as the Brazilian latched on, he ended up at too tight of an angle, and his shot is parried by Jan Oblak.

Anything Atleti have right now has come purely on the counter, they have no buildup to speak of. 54th min: Robert Lewandowski is bundled over at the top of the penalty area by Axel Witsel, just inches outside the 18-yard box. Witsel, who only just came on, gets a yellow card for the poor challenge. It gives the hosts a very dangerous free-kick shaded just left of the middle, and Lewandowski takes it but smashes the ball straight into the wall. Moments later, Pedri goes for the top corner from a dangerous position on the right but sails it just high. Barcelona remain in firm control of this match, nothing notable has changed since halftime. 52nd min: Atletico Madrid are forced into a change as Jose Gimenez, their most experienced player and captain, is brought off. He looks to be in some pain, with frustration on his face, as he's replaced by Axel Witsel. 48th min: Chance, Barcelona! Fermin Lopez is clean through on goal thanks to a truly fantastic vertical through-ball from Pedri, but he's denied by Jan Oblak! A wonderful, top-class save to keep the deficit at one! From an Atletico Madrid perspective, though, that's an ugly chance to give up as it looked very similar to the one which opened the scoring! It came off a horrible giveaway by Jose Gimenez who attempted a switch but passed it right to Raphinha in the central attacking area. 2nd half kickoff: They're back under way at the Olympic Stadium in Barcelona. No changes for either side for now, which is maybe a bit of a surprise from an Atletico Madrid perspective. HALFTIME: Barcelona 1-0 Atletico Madrid Complete and utter domination by Barcelona for the first 40 minutes of the game, with Pedri's goal the exclamation mark. Atletico Madrid looked as if they had something to say in the final five minutes before halftime, but they have been far and away second-best in this game. With just the one goal for Barcelona at the end of all that attacking pressure, it will be interesting to see how Diego Simeone puts together any tactical or personnel changes at the break. Atletico Madrid are once again being humbled on the road at Barcelona, something that's become a regular occurrence over the past two decades. 23 - Teams from Europe's top five leagues with the most goals scored during the first half of their matches this season.23 - #BARCELONA 🔵🔴22 - Bayer Leverkusen21 - PSG21 - Inter20 - Bayern MunichTuned. pic.twitter.com/kCobdIhTHF 40th min: Atletico Madrid look to be on the breakaway as Conor Gallagher does well to spring Julian Alvarez up front, but the famed Barcelona offside trap works to perfection and Alvarez is caught leaning just a fraction too soon. 37th min: Raphinha is absolutely cooking today, as he nutmegs Conor Gallagher to get free on the right touchline. He's dispossessed shortly thereafter as he tries to get by another defender in similar fashion, but he's giving Atletico Madrid players nightmares so far. 30th min: GOAL! BARCELONA! AN ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS OPENING GOAL BY PEDRI!!!!! Truly sensational combo work with Gavi, and it's been coming!! The Barcelona midfielder carves through the Atletico Madrid midfield and touches to Gavi, who produces an utterly brilliant turn to free himself from a defender and release the one-two with Pedri. Through on goal, all Pedri has to do is beat Jan Oblak which he does low into the far corner! What a gorgeous combination! VIDEO: Watch Pedri goal in USA | Watch in UK Come celebrate with Pedri! 🔥#BarçaAtleti | #LaLigaHighlights pic.twitter.com/LBfBGs7YRT 25th min: Chance, Barcelona! The pressure continues for Barcelona and Gavi puts a thumping header wide! Raphinha, who's been brilliant thus far, was the one to deliver the cross on a platter to the near post, but Gavi can't hit the target, getting good power on the effort but blazing it past the woodwork. 21st min: Chance, Barcelona! The match is paused for VAR to take a closer look at an incident where a Barcelona cross evades two attackers and clips Giuliano Simeone on the elbow. The replay officials are not convinced, however, as there was no advantage gained from the incident as two forwards whiffed with attempts on goal as the ball sailed through. Credit to the officials for use of common sense! On the eventual corner, Inigo Martinez attempts a powerful hit from about 10 yards out shaded right, but Jan Oblak has his near post covered and palms the ball away with two hands! 18th min: Atletico Madrid have managed to get a lid on Barcelona's attack, but they haven't had much of their own either. Finally, the visitors get forward and secure a speculative set-piece chance from out near the right corner flag but the fizzed delivery is hoofed away and cleared. 9th min: Barcelona continue to hold all the attacking possession, pressing Atletico Madrid back into their defensive third. Raphinha has been an absolute menace down the left, forcing Atleti into a few moments of emergency last-ditch defending. They are clearly in control of the early proceedings. 4th min: Chance, Barcelona! The hosts are on the front foot early as Atletico Madrid have blocked two clear chances right on the goal mouth! Raphinha's effort is the best of the two as he rifles one from the top-right corner of the six-yard box only to see it turned away! Raphinha with a solid chance!#BarçaAtleti ⏐ #LaLigaHighlights pic.twitter.com/dxdLzn58EF Kickoff: The top two teams in the La Liga table are under way in Barcelona! 15 mins to kickoff: We've spoken already about Atletico Madrid's horrible recent record against Barcelona, but here's one number to really put it into perspective: Atleti have not won a league game at Barcelona since February of 2006. That's over a year before Lamine Yamal was born! Can their recent form this season push them to a reversal of that dismal road fortune against the Catalan giants today? 💡: Atlético Madrid’s coach Diego Simeone has never won a match away at Barcelona in 17 attempts in all competitions. He has recorded 7 draws and 10 defeats while visiting Barça. pic.twitter.com/8DewZKMhKr 30 mins to kickoff: The all-time top goal scorer in this league fixture is none other than Lionel Messi, with his 26 La Liga goals for Barcelona against Atletico Madrid — and 32 if you count all competitions. For the visitors today, their all-time top goal scorer is Paco Campos with 12, not even half Messi's career total. 🗃️ From The Vault:The 🐐 🆚 Atleti#BarçaAtleti pic.twitter.com/9aSuPqVWH1 45 mins to kickoff: Both teams have gone with a relatively consistent starting lineup given their available squad, but both made changes in midfield. Both Conor Gallagher for Atletico Madrid and Gavi for Barcelona bring a high work rate to the middle of the park. The more interesting aspect of this is a focus on who was sent to the bench. Frenkie de Jong and Dani Olmo both miss out for Barcelona, with the latter not having grabbed a goal contribution since early November. For Atletico Madrid, Samuel Lino was hooked at halftime of their win over Getafe last time out, and is replaced by a pure midfielder in Gallagher. Could that mean a move away from the 4-4-2 and instead put Antoine Griezmann at the 10 with Simeone and Alvarez up front? We'll see how it shakes out. 1 hour to kickoff: The Barcelona lineup was also released a bit early, and there are also no quirks from Hansi Flick's XI. Lamine Yamal remains out with an ankle injury, with Fermin Lopez replacing him on the wing instead of the red-hot Ferran Torres. Gavi enters in midfield for just his third start of the league season since coming back from an ACL tear. The head man Flick will not be on the touchline today as he serves the second of his two-match ban. 1 hour 15 mins to kick: Atletico Madrid have released their starting lineup 15 minutes early. There are no surprises in Diego Simeone's XI, with only one change as England international Conor Gallagher enters the lineup in place of Samuel Lino. 1 hour 30 mins to kick: Atletico Madrid are wearing their slick gray tops today. A gorgeous away kit indeed! 😁 pic.twitter.com/SzCTAWJhUN 1 hour 45 mins to kick: Ferran Torres has been a man in form off the bench for Barcelona of late, often coming in for the aging Robert Lewandowski to finish off games. The former Man City forward says he's been a better player recently thanks to Lewandowski, saying before this match he's tried to be \"like a sponge\" to learn from the famed Polish striker. 2 hours to kickoff: The juxtaposition of Atletico Madrid's recent league form against their recent history against Barcelona could not be more in contrast. Atleti have won 11 straight games across all competitions, including their last six in league play. Yet they have lost five in a row against Barcelona in league play and just one in their last 16, failing to score in any of their latest four. Even crazier, the electric Antoine Griezmann has never scored for Atletico Madrid against Barcelona in a league game, with just one goal contribution in his 15 appearances, an assist in a 1-1 draw back in 2018. Could that change today? Both Griezmann and Atletico Madrid's recent form indicate now's their best chance in quite a while to turn that awful streak around. ❗️Antoine Griezmann has scored against 29 of the 30 teams he has faced with Atletico Madrid in La Liga.He just has not scored against Barcelona. @mundodeportivo pic.twitter.com/EQd7AibZ5F This top-of-the-table La Liga match kicks off from the Lluis Companys Olympic Stadium on Saturday, December 21 at 9 p.m. local time in Barcelona, Spain. Here's how that time translates across some of the major territories around the globe: Barcelona will be without teenage superstar Lamine Yamal with an ankle injury keeping him sidelined until the start of 2025. Hansi Flick's side has failed to win any of the four league games already missed by the 17-year-old in 2024/25 with Fermin Lopez potentially replacing him in the starting XI. Also missing is none other than the aforementioned head man himself, as Flick serves the second of a two-match suspention. Andreas Christensen, Marc Bernal and Marc-Andre ter Stegen all remain out injured as well with the Blaugrana looking thin, something fans have become accustomed to in recent years, although they do get Ansu Fati back on the bench today while Ronaldo Araujo is also amongst the substitutes while he works back from a long-term hamstring issue. Barcelona starting lineup (4-3-3): Pena (GK) — Kounde, Cubarsi, Martinez, Balde — Gavi, Casado, Pedri — Lopez, Lewandowski, Raphinha. Barcelona subs (12): Szczesny (GK), Astralaga (GK), Araujo, E. Garcia, S. Dominguez, G. Martin, De Jong, Olmo, Torre, Fati, F. Torres, Victor. Diego Simeone has not confirmed any fresh injury concerns in his camp and he could stick with an unchanged team from last weekend's 1-0 over Getafe. Only Angel Correa was expected to be absent thanks to a muscle injury, but even he is available off the bench. Despite scoring a winner off the bench last time out, Alexander Sorloth could remain amongst the substitutes, with Julian Alvarez and Antoine Griezmann in sparkling form up front. Atletico Madrid starting lineup (4-4-2): Oblak (GK) — Llorente, Gimenez, Lenglet, Galan — Simeone, De Paul, Barrios, Gallagher — Alvarez, Griezmann. Atletico Madrid subs (12): Musso (GK), Azpilicueta, Le Normand, Witsel, Riquelme, Reinildo, Lino, Molina, Lemar, Koke, Correa, Sorloth.

Jhon Duran and Morgan Rogers struck in each half for the home side at a lively Villa Park, with Phil Foden's strike in second-half added time proving scant consolation for City and their commendable away support. Pep Guardiola's side, beaten by Manchester United in last weekend's derby by the same scoreline, are now on a run of nine defeats in 12 games in all competitions and are without an away victory since October 20. They could find themselves 12 points adrift of league leaders Liverpool by Christmas depending on results later this weekend. Full commentary and highlights | Team news and lineups Venue: Villa Park, BirminghamReferee: Peter Bankes Keep track of every game and every goal via SN's live Premier League scoreboard Starting lineups: Aston Villa (4-3-3, right to left): 23. Emiliano Martinez (GK) — 2. Matty Cash, 4. Ezri Konsa, 14. Pau Torres, 12. Lucas Digne — 8. Youri Tielemans, 44. Boubacar Kamara, 24. Amadou Onana — 7. John McGinn, 9. Jhon Duran (11.

Josko Gvardiol — 19. Ilkay Gundogan (26. Savinho), 8. Mateo Kovacic (11. Jeremy Doku) — 20. Bernardo Silva, 47. Phil Foden, 10. Jack Grealish — 9. Erling Haaland MORE: All the latest Man City news | Premier League schedule for 2024/25 | Latest Premier League top scorer rankings Villa had three golden chances to score inside the opening three minutes, Duran forcing a save from Stefan Ortega — in for the absent Ederson — before the City keeper produced a remarkable reflex save to stop the ball being glanced in from the resulting corner. Amadou Onana then headed over the bar from close range. Duran made the most of his next opportunity, though, side-footing past Ortega after being set up by Rogers following a quite wonderful through ball from the outstanding Youri Tielemans. City dominated possession in the first half but found little joy against Villa's organised defence, with a misdirected Josko Gvardiol header from Jack Grealish's cross the closest they game to an equaliser. Villa took a more front-foot approach after halftime and should have doubled their lead before the hour. Matty Cash fired into the side netting instead of crossing for Boubacar Kamara for a tap-in, and Rogers drilled a shot off the outside of the left-hand post. Rogers made no mistake with his next chance. Having started the move with a strong midfield run that left Mateo Kovacic for dead, he received a pass from John McGinn and fired a left-foot strike into the bottom-right corner, with Ortega motionless in his goal. City heads seemed to drop and Villa looked the more likely to get the game's third goal, with substitute Ollie Watkins shooting straight at Ortega with a presentable opportunity. At the other end, Erling Haaland threw himself despairingly at a looping cross, having spent the whole game on the fringes. Foden ended his long wait for a Premier League goal when he slotted past Emiliano Martinez after Lucas Digne had slipped on the loose ball in the Villa box, but by that stage, a comeback felt implausible. City are now on a worse run of form than Erik ten Hag's Manchester United were before the Dutchman was sacked in late October. Guardiola will almost certainly not face the same fate, but quite how he turns things around this season is hard to fathom. That's that! City don't have time for a comeback. It's yet another defeat for Guardiola's team. 90+2 mins: GOAL! FODEN GETS ONE BACK! Savinho runs well with the ball and finds his teammate, who has a shot blocked but gets the ball back thanks to Lucas Digne's slip. Foden then has a simple finish into the bottom-right corner. Can they rescue a result?

The champions are running out of time here. 82 mins: Rogers races away from Walker and plays a reverse pass to substitute Ollie Watkins, who shots straight at Ortega on his weaker foot. Guardiola throws his hands up and turns away in disgust. 79 mins: Villa are on the hunt for a third goal. City are very passive without the ball right now. It's not a good watch for any fans. 72 mins: Savinho is on for Ilkay Gundogan as Guardiola rolls the dice to try to get back into this game. 65 mins: GOAL! NO MISTAKE FROM ROGERS THIS TIME! The outstanding Tielemans combines well with McGinn, who sets up Rogers to drill a low shot past the motionless Ortega. Villa are in complete control now!

Gvardiol isn't strong enough with a challenge in his own box and the ball falls kindly the Rogers, whose low shot crashes off the outside of the left-hand post. He should really have hit the target. 57 mins: Akanji is going to continue, although he doesn't look entirely comfortable. 56 mins: Akanji makes a good sliding challenge on Duran, and both men stay down. Akanji looks to have landed awkwardly on his shoulder. This is the last thing City need right now. Duran is back up and looks okay. 53 mins: Onana, who has looked a bit of a passenger in the Villa midfield at times today, accidentally stands on the back of Foden's ankle. That looked a painful one for the City man, although he's back up on his feet. 51 mins: Duran smashes a finish past Ortega after being played through by Tielemans, but the flag goes up, and the striker seemed to be expecting it. He was indeed offside, although not by a lot. 49 mins: BIG CHANCE WASTED BY CASH! More brilliant Tielemans work in midfield sets up another swift attack. McGinn plays it to the overlapping Cash, who blasts the ball into the side-netting of Ortega's goal when Kamara was waiting in the middle for a tap-in! 47 mins: Rico Lewis is booked for stopping Tielemans on the counter. The City man has moved to left-back, with Walker on the right of the defence and Gvardiol partnering Akanji in the centre. City have made a change at the break: Kyle Walker is on for John Stones. The half ends as Grealish is halted by Cash again, and the City man then gets into a heated argument with Villa goalkeeper Emi Martinez, who has gone into the book. 43 mins: BIG CHANCE FOR GVARDIOL! The defender leads a City break, finds Grealish and continues his run into the box. Grealish's cross lands right on the full-back's head, but he's stretching for the ball and can't keep his attempt on target. 41 mins: The game has entered a bit of a lull. City are still struggling to pick their way through Villa, and the hosts have had a couple of chances to break quickly without making the most of them. 35 mins: City offer a glimpse of what they can do at their best, with Foden and Lewis combining well with some slick passes, but Martinez is equal to the former's shot. Duran clears the first corner, and the second is rather wasted. 27 mins: Gvardiol plays a teasing cross towards Haaland, but Pau Torres is able to clear. City are focusing all their attacks down the left at the moment. 23 mins: We're back into City possession and deep Villa defending, but so far, the home side are quite comfortable. City haven't got the ball to Haaland in any dangerous positions yet. 16 mins: GOAL! DURAN PUTS VILLA AHEAD! The No. 9 has a simple side-footed finish from the middle of the box after Morgan Rogers had squared it. But that all came from a simply wonderful throughball from Youri Tielemans, who came to receive a pass from his goalkeeper, turned away from pressure, and threaded the ball quite magnificently through City's defence and into Rogers' path.

The visitors have settled now, but the hosts are defending their box well. 9 mins: Grealish has had a lively start against his old club. Villa fans cheer as he is felled by Matty Cash, but this is a free-kick in a decent position for City. Villa just about clear their lines in the end. 3 mins: Amadou Onana has a near free header and sends it over the bar. That's another chance gone for Villa, and we've only had three minutes! 2 mins: HOW HAS THAT STAYED OUT? The corner is glanced on and Ortega gets fingertips to the ball to claw it away at the near post, and Erling Haaland clears. The referee signals that the ball did not cross the line — but boy, that was close. That's how close Aston Villa came to opening the scoring inside 2 minutes against Man City 👀📺 @tntsports & @discoveryplusUK pic.twitter.com/jGQVWA9L93 1 min: VILLA SHOULD BE AHEAD! Josko Gvardiol is caught on the ball by John McGinn, and Jhon Duran has a clear run at goal. He tries a low shot from 25 yards out, and Stefan Ortega makes a good save to tip it behind. The Villa striker could have taken the ball closer to goal, there. Here we go! 5 mins before kickoff: Villa Park's traditional pyrotechnics are ongoing as the teams begin to make their way onto the pitch. 35 mins before kickoff: Guardiola told TNT Sports in the UK that Ederson \"is not here, he doesn't feel good\". He was happy to welcome back Stones and Akanji, though, despite a relative lack of preparation. \"They trained two or three times,\" he said. \"Of course, they are important players.\" Arrived at Villa Park! 👊#ManCity | #AsahiSuperDry pic.twitter.com/CMFNIXNKLr 1 hour before kickoff: Interesting team news for today: Jack Grealish starts against his old club, with Kevin De Bruyne on the bench. City are also able to welcome back Manuel Akanji to the defence, which actually looks solid on paper this time, although Ederson is not in the squad at all. Villa look to be going 4-3-3, with Amadou Onana starting in an imposing-looking midfield. Jhon Duran leads the attack. 1 hour 30 mins before kickoff: Guardiola is hoping for at least one return from injury today in the form of Manuel Akanji, but the news of Ruben Dias’ weeks-long layoff was another blow in what is proving a hugely difficult season for the reigning champions. 2 hours before kickoff: City and Villa get us underway for this latest Premier League weekend — the first of the busy holiday season. Pep Guardiola may be used to the packed December schedule by now, but he is certainly not accustomed to reaching this point of the season with his team in such disarray: they have lost five of their most recent seven Premier League games, as many as they had in their previous 67 matches combined. Manchester City were leading 1-0 at 87:10, but less than two minutes later (89:06) Manchester United lead 2-1 in the derby.Astonishing. pic.twitter.com/hTIBQ0b1Dx This Premier League match kicks off in Birmingham, UK at 12:30 p.m. local time. Here's how that time translates across some of the major territories: Villa look to be going with a 4-3-3 set-up, with Amadou Onana coming into midfield to partner Boubacar Kamara and Youri Tielemans. Matty Cash reverts to right-back, the Poland international having played on the wing during the defeat to Forest. Emery does not expect Jacob Ramsey to be back from a muscle issue until early January, but Leon Bailey is back on the bench after recovering from a \"small\" thigh injury. Tyrone Mings has sat out Villa's past three games in all competitions but is fit enough to make the matchday squad, having overcome an illness. Aston Villa starting lineup (4-3-3, right to left): Martinez (GK) — Cash, Konsa, Torres, Digne — Tielemans, Kamara, Onana — McGinn, Duran, Rogers Aston Villa subs: Mings, Barkley, Buendia, Watkins, Nedeljkovic, Maatsen, Olsen, Bogarde, Bailey MORE: All the latest EPL club news | Team-by-team Premier League schedule for 2024/25 | Latest Premier League top scorer rankings News that Ruben Dias is facing four weeks on the sidelines represents another body blow to Guardiola, although Manuel Akanji and John Stones returning to the lineup means City's defence looks much more robust than it has recently. Rico Lewis is available after a one-match suspension and comes straight back into the lineup in place of the under-fire Kyle Walker at right-back. Jack Grealish starts against his former club, with Phil Foden the No. 10 in place of the benched Kevin De Bruyne. Goalkeeper Ederson \"does not feel good\", according to Guardiola, and is not in the matchdays squad. Erling Haaland has scored just three times in 11 league matches, but despite speculation of a falling out with Guardiola, he leads the line. Man City starting lineup (4-2-3-1, right to left): Ortega (GK) — Lewis, Stones, Akanji, Gvardiol — Gundogan, Kovacic — Silva, Foden, Grealish — Haaland Man City subs: Walker, Ake, Doku, De Bruyne, Savinho, Carson, Simpson-Pusey, O'Reilly, McAtee Here's how to watch this Premier League match across selected areas of the world's major regions: If you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.

                "content": "On November 12, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Social Security Fairness Act (H.R. 82). The legislation passed by a vote of 327-75, with one member voting “Present.” The bill would increase the Social Security benefit for many career fire and EMS personnel and their spouses. H.R 82 would repeal the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO). The Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) is a modified benefit formula that reduces the Social Security benefits of certain retired or disabled workers, who also are entitled to pension benefits based on earnings from jobs that are not subject to the Social Security payroll tax. The Government Pension Offset (GPO) reduces the Social Security’s spouses’ or widows/ers’ benefits of most people who also receive a pension based on federal, state, or local government employment not covered by Social Security. The Senate still must vote on H.R. 82. The Senate companion bill (S. 597) was introduced by Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH) and has 62 cosponsors. \"The IAFC community of firefighters is pleased that the House has restored full Social Security benefits for us and other public service people. The two provisions of current law – the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO) significantly impact the income and quality of life for retired firefighters.

                "content": "The UConn Huskies women's basketball team is the college basketball program representing the University of Connecticut in Storrs, Connecticut, in NCAA Division I women's basketball competition. They currently play in the Big East Conference. The UConn Huskies are the most successful women's basketball program in the nation, having won a record 11 NCAA Division I National Championships and a women's record four in a row, from 2013 through 2016,[2] plus over 50 conference regular season and tournament championships. They have taken part in every NCAA tournament since 1989; as of the end of the 2018–19 season, this is the third-longest active streak in Division I.[3] From 2008 to 2022, they appeared in a record 14 consecutive Final Fours.[4] UConn owns the two longest winning streaks (men's or women's) in college basketball history. The longest streak, 111 straight wins, started with a win against Creighton University on November 23, 2014, and ended on March 31, 2017, when a buzzer-beater at the end of overtime caused a 66–64 loss in the 2017 NCAA Final Four to Mississippi State.[5] The second streak counts 90 consecutive wins, including two undefeated seasons (2008–09 and 2009–10), and was delimited by two losses against Stanford, the first on April 6, 2008, in the National Semifinals of the NCAA Tournament, and the second – three seasons later – on December 19, 2010.[6] The Huskies also own the longest winning streak in regular-season games in college history; after an overtime loss to Stanford on November 17, 2014, they won their next 126 regular-season games until a 68–57 loss to Baylor on January 3, 2019.[7] UConn's current head coach is Luigi \"Geno\" Auriemma, who joined the team in 1985. Auriemma is one of the most successful coaches in college basketball: his 1149–150 (.885) record as of April 2022[update] represents the highest winning percentage among NCAA basketball coaches (minimum 10 seasons), any level, men's or women's,[8] while ranking him second in all-time women's wins behind retired Stanford coach Tara VanDerveer. UConn has also been one of the leaders in women's basketball attendance; the team plays its home games at both the Harry A. Gampel Pavilion in Storrs and the XL Center in Hartford. The UConn Huskies' first ever game was played on December 5, 1974, and was a 40–27 win over visiting Eastern Connecticut State University.[9] After winning their first two games, the team lost the other eight in a 10-game season. The team had a losing record during its first six seasons under coaches Sandra Hamm (1974–75) and Wanda Flora (1975–80), and only one winning season (in 1980–81) in five seasons under Jean Balthaser (1980–85). Prior to the 1985–86 season, UConn hired Geno Auriemma as their new head coach, who had served as assistant coach at Virginia, with the goal of revitalizing the program. Auriemma's training skills had an immediate impact and the team showed steady signs of progress: after going 12–15 in his first season in 1985–86, Auriemma led UConn to winning seasons in 1986–87 and 1987–88.[10] Auriemma pulled off one of his biggest and most important early recruiting successes in 1987 when he convinced an All American from New Hampshire, Kerry Bascom, to come to UConn. Bascom had an immediate impact on the UConn program: in 1989 she won the Big East Player of the Year award as a sophomore (she also won the award in her junior and senior years) and led UConn to its first Big East regular season and tournament title, along with its first-ever NCAA tournament appearance at a #8 seed; the tournament ended in a first round loss to #9 seed La Salle, 72–63. With Bascom and teammates Laura Lishness, Megan Pattyson, Wendy Davis and Debbie Baer, UConn reached the NCAA Tournament again in 1990 as a #4 seed, losing 61–59 to Clemson in the second round after a first-round bye.[11] In Auriemma's 6th season (1990–91) the Huskies broke through on the national scene, again capturing the Big East regular season and tournament titles, and earning a #3 seed in the East Regional of the NCAA Tournament, its highest seed up to then. UConn beat Toledo 81–80 at Gampel Pavilion in the opening round, with Bascom scoring an NCAA tournament single-game record 39 points. The Huskies then moved on to the regionals at The Palestra in Auriemma's hometown of Philadelphia. Here, the team upset heavily favored ACC power North Carolina State in the Sweet 16 by 11 points, and then defeated Clemson 60–57 in the Elite Eight to advance to their first-ever Final Four (also a first for any Big East school). UConn's season ended with a 61–55 loss to top-seeded Virginia in the national semifinals at Lakefront Arena in New Orleans. Bascom was hit with early foul trouble and Virginia held off a late UConn rally. Including all tournament games, Bascom had set a new UConn scoring record with 2,177 points during her years at the school.[12] The 1990–91 season is widely credited with bringing UConn's women's basketball program into the national spotlight for the first time. It also followed the men's 1989–90 \"Dream Season,\" which brought that program into the national spotlight as well. UConn followed up its surprise run to the Final Four in 1991 by landing All-American Rebecca Lobo from Southwick, Massachusetts. UConn had modest success in Lobo's first 2 seasons, losing early in the NCAA Tournament in both seasons. In 1993–94, UConn had its most successful season up to that point;[13] led by Lobo and teammates Jamelle Elliott, Jennifer Rizzotti, Pam Webber, Kara Wolters and Carla Berube, UConn won 30 games for the first time in program history, winning the Big East tournament and regular-season titles. In the NCAA tournament, UConn reached the Elite Eight but came up short in its hopes to make it back to the Final Four, losing to eventual champion North Carolina. With every major player back from 1994, and the addition of Auriemma's most highly ranked recruit to date (Connecticut Player of the Year Nykesha Sales), UConn was in for a season to remember in 1994–95.[14] The season started with an 80-point win over Morgan State; two weeks later, UConn defeated powerhouse North Carolina State by 23 points on the road. This season also saw the birth of one of the greatest rivalries in college sports, the UConn-Tennessee rivalry, that began when the two teams met for the first time on Martin Luther King Day at Gampel Pavilion. UConn defeated Tennessee 77–66 in front of a sold-out crowd in a game televised on ESPN and soon afterwards became ranked No. 1 in the polls for the first time in program history. UConn went unbeaten through the Conference regular season and Tournament and easily advanced into the NCAA tournament. In the Elite Eight against Virginia, a 4-point win (their closest game of the year) secured the team's place in the Final Four at the Target Center in Minneapolis.[15] UConn blew out Stanford in the National semifinals 87–60, reaching the championship for a rematch against Tennessee. In the championship game, UConn found itself in early trouble when Lobo was called for three personal fouls in 94 seconds in the first half. However, in the second half the team was able to rally from a 9-point deficit, and a key Rizzotti layup gave UConn the lead with less than 2 minutes to go. UConn won the game with a final score of 70–64 and claimed their first ever national title. Rebecca Lobo was named the Final Four's Most Outstanding Player. With a perfect 35–0 record, UConn became only the fifth Division I women's basketball team to go undefeated en route to a national championship, and only the second since the NCAA era began in 1982. The Huskies also became the first unbeaten team in NCAA history, all divisions, men or women, to win 35 games in a season.[16] The 1994–95 UConn team was widely credited with increasing interest in women's basketball.[17] The team was honored with a parade in Hartford, CT, that drew over 100,000 spectators. The team won the Team of the Year Award at the ESPN ESPY awards that year, and Lobo became a popular symbol of the sport. UConn also signed a landmark deal during the season with Connecticut Public Television to broadcast their games.[18] Lobo graduated in 1995, receiving countless accolades: the Naismith College Player of the Year award, the Wade Trophy, the Associated Press Women's College Basketball Player of the Year award, the USBWA Women's National Player of the Year award, the Honda-Broderick Cup, the Best Female Athlete ESPY Award (first basketball player ever), the Associated Press Athlete of the Year (second basketball player after Sheryl Swoopes), the NCAA Woman of the Year Award, the Academic All-America of the Year, and made the All-sports Academic All-America of the Year. In 2010 Lobo became the first Connecticut player inducted into the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame, among a class of six inductees,[19] followed by teammate Jennifer Rizzotti in the class of 2013.[20] After the 1995 Championship title, UConn rose to national prominence as one of the powerhouses in women's college basketball, giving coach Auriemma the chance to recruit star talents from high school like Shea Ralph in 1996 and Svetlana Abrosimova in 1997. Starting with their two meetings in 1995, the rivalry between the Tennessee Lady Vols and UConn escalated through the late 1990s and into the 2000s, becoming the marquee matchup in all women's sports, and taking on parallels to the Red Sox-Yankees rivalry in Major League Baseball. Geno Auriemma jokingly once referred to Pat Summitt and Tennessee as the \"evil empire\", like Red Sox president and CEO Larry Lucchino said of the Yankees.[21] In the 1995–96 season, UConn ended Tennessee's home court winning streak at Thompson–Boling Arena in Knoxville. Tennessee avenged itself in the Final Four that year in Charlotte, defeating UConn 88–83 in overtime; the game is often thought to be one of the more memorable tournament games in tournament history with many back and forth swings of momentum.[22] UConn defeated Tennessee during the 1996–97 regular season; after a season-ending injury for Shea Ralph in the first round of the NCAA tournament, UConn reached the Regional Final where the two teams met again, with Tennessee prevailing and ending Connecticut's unbeaten season by winning 91–81.[23] Tennessee defeated Connecticut again in the 1997–98 regular season. A mini controversy erupted in the days after the game when Tennessee's Chamique Holdsclaw was quoted in the papers as saying UConn looked scared during the game; Auriemma denounced that quote.[24] With Shea Ralph and senior Nykesha Sales out for the entire season, freshman Svetlana Abrosimova led a young UConn team to the NCAA Tournament Regional Final, where they eventually lost to North Carolina State 60–52. Auriemma found himself in a national debate following a decision he made during the 1997–98 season. Senior Nykesha Sales suffered a season-ending injury in one of the final games of the regular season. At the time of her injury, she was only one point shy of Kerry Bascom's school scoring record. The next game, with Bascom's blessing, and assistance from friend and Villanova head coach Harry Perretta, Auriemma arranged to have Sales, who was on crutches, score a basket and then allow Villanova to score a basket to start the game at 2–2. Sales then held the school scoring record.[25] Many people weighed in on the decision on both national and local levels. Auriemma felt guilty that he put Sales through the ordeal and was angry that some columnists chose to fault her and not him. Auriemma was criticized for compromising the integrity of the game, but defended the decision saying it was a school record and he would never have done it without Bascom's blessing.[26] Auriemma signed his best recruiting class to date in 1998 when he signed five top-15 nationally ranked players. High school All-Americans Swin Cash, Tamika Williams, Sue Bird, Asjha Jones, and Keirsten Walters were dubbed \"TASSK Force\" by Connecticut fans, using the players' initials. The class renewed hope of bringing more championships to UConn after watching archrival Tennessee win three in a row. The first season for the highly ranked class in 1998–99 featured mixed results and featured many injuries: Sue Bird tore her ACL and went out for the season after only 10 games. In their 1999 meeting at Gampel Pavilion, Tennessee prevailed over the Huskies again. During the game there was a scuffle involving Tennessee's Semeka Randall and Connecticut's Svetlana Abrosimova where Randall threw the ball down, hitting Abrosimova's head. UConn fans booed Randall the rest of the game and Tennessee fans later gave her the nickname \"Boo.\"[27] The 1998–99 season ended in the Sweet Sixteen round of the NCAA Tournament, where UConn lost 64–58 to Iowa State, falling short of reaching the Final Four for the third consecutive year. Motivated by their previous disappointing season, UConn returned in 1999–2000 with the clear goal of reaching championship level again. Led by upperclassmen Shea Ralph, Kelly Schumacher, Svetlana Abrosimova and the TASS Force (the K was dropped when Keirsten Walters had to give up basketball due to knee problems), UConn went through the regular season with a 27–1 record, with their only loss being a single-point defeat to Tennessee at home. The Huskies advanced to their first Final Four since 1996 and defeated Penn State in the semifinals. The team then met the Lady Vols for the championship game in Auriemma's hometown of Philadelphia. Despite the two regular season meetings being close battles, UConn used tenacious defense and backdoor cuts to overwhelm Tennessee 71–52 for their second national championship. Connecticut's final season record was 36–1 and Shea Ralph was named the Final Four's MVP.[28] Auriemma pulled off another huge recruiting coup when he convinced All-American guard Diana Taurasi to travel across country to attend Connecticut. Taurasi hailed from Chino, California, and attended Don Lugo High School where she was the recipient of the 2000 Cheryl Miller Award, presented by the Los Angeles Times to the best player in southern California. She was also named the 2000 Naismith and Parade Magazine National High School Player of the Year. Taurasi finished her high school career ranked second to Cheryl Miller in state history with 3,047 points.[29] With Taurasi joining the core of the 2000 Championship team, Auriemma confidently predicted another championship in 2001, but the season turned out to be more difficult than expected. UConn won the Big East tournament over Notre Dame in a game remembered for the Bird at the Buzzer shot, but lost key players Abrosimova and Ralph to season-ending injuries.[30] As a consequence, Taurasi had to play a much larger role than anticipated in the NCAA Tournament. She led UConn to the Final Four, but in the National semifinals against Notre Dame in St. Louis, Taurasi had a poor shooting game, and despite UConn having attained a 16-point lead at one point, the team lost 90–75. Notre Dame went on to win its first national championship. As with the 2000 champions, who had also come off a disappointing loss the year before, UConn returned hungrier than ever in 2001–02. With the TASS force in their senior season and Taurasi emerging as a star in her sophomore year, UConn rolled through all its opponents throughout the year and maintained an undefeated record going into the NCAA Tournament. The team easily won the Big East regular season and tournament trophies, defeating Boston College 96–54 in the Big East championship game. In the NCAA Tournament, the Huskies were once again awarded the #1 overall seed and demolished their opponents to advance to their 3rd consecutive Final Four. In the semifinals, UConn used tenacious offensive play to defeat rival Tennessee by a whopping 23 points. In front of a record-breaking crowd at the Alamodome in San Antonio, UConn defeated Oklahoma in the championship game, 82–70, to complete a perfect 39–0 season. The starting five of Bird, Taurasi, Cash, Jones, and Williams is widely regarded as the best starting five in women's college basketball history.[31] The championship game that year shattered ratings for ESPN and at the time was the highest rated college basketball game to air on the network, men's or women's.[32] With the TASS force graduated, Diana Taurasi had to carry most of the load in her junior season, with help from returning teammates Maria Conlon, Jessica Moore and Ashley Battle and a top-ranked recruiting class that included Ann Strother, Barbara Turner, Willnet Crockett and Nicole Wolff. With no seniors on the roster, 2003 was supposed to be a rebuilding year for UConn, but as the year progressed it became clear that Taurasi was up to the challenge of carrying a group of young players to the championship game. UConn finished the regular season undefeated and established a 70-game winning streak, shattering the previous mark of 54 set by Louisiana Tech; the streak ended in the Big East championship game with a 52–48 loss to Villanova.[33] In the NCAA Tournament, UConn easily advanced to the Final Four at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta. UConn rallied from a 9-point deficit to beat Texas 71–69 in the semifinals and, aided by Taurasi's 28 points in the finals, defeated rival Tennessee 73–68 to claim the program's fourth national championship. The Huskies became the first team ever to win a championship without a senior on their roster.[34][35] Although the entire team returned and expectations were sky high for a \"three-peat\" in Taurasi's senior year, UConn had an uneven season. The team gave up large leads against Duke and suffered losses to Notre Dame and Villanova, also losing to Boston College in the semifinals of the Big East tournament. The Huskies found their rhythm during the NCAA Tournament, in which they were a #2 seed; in the Elite Eight they beat top-seeded Penn State 66–49 to advance to their 5th straight Final Four at the New Orleans Arena. After beating Minnesota in the national semifinals, UConn again defeated Tennessee to win their 3rd consecutive national championship, winning 70–61. The win was even more special as the UConn men's basketball team won the men's national championship the previous night, marking the first time one University won both the men's and women's basketball championships in one season, a feat UConn repeated in 2014. In her career at UConn, Taurasi led the team to four consecutive Final Fours and three straight national titles. Prior to that final championship, her coach, Geno Auriemma, predicted his team's likelihood of winning with the statement, \"We have Diana, and you don't.\"[36] Taurasi received many personal accolades at UConn including the 2003 and 2004 Naismith College Player of the Year awards, the 2003 Wade Trophy, the 2003 Associated Press Women's College Basketball Player of the Year award, the 2003 USBWA Women's National Player of the Year award and the 2004 Best Female Athlete ESPY Award. Taurasi was the third basketball player to receive this final honor, after former UConn star Rebecca Lobo and Tennessee star Chamique Holdsclaw. She achieved legendary status among UConn fans, and is widely considered one of the greatest players of all time.[37] Relative to their high standards, UConn struggled during the first two years following Taurasi's graduation in 2004. Some of its highly touted recruits did not play up to expectations while others suffered injuries. Taken together during the three years 2005–2007, UConn never made a Final Four, something that had become almost routine (7 final fours in 10 years from 1995 to 2004). The 2004–05 season was marked with sloppy play and ragged offense; UConn lost 8 games and failed to win the Big East regular season crown for the first time since 1993. In the NCAA tournament, UConn lost to Stanford in the Sweet Sixteen.[38] In the 2005–06 season, UConn showed some signs of improvement, winning the Big East tournament and beating Georgia in the Sweet Sixteen thanks to a fadeaway 3-pointer with 1.8 seconds left by senior Barbara Turner.[39] Behind a home state crowd, UConn almost upset #1 ranked Duke in the regional final, before falling in overtime by 2 points.[40] In the 2006–07 season, the team improved their record with the additions of Renee Montgomery, Mel Thomas, Ketia Swanier, and the #1 ranked high school player Tina Charles, helping UConn emerge as a national contender again. UConn was a #1 seed in the NCAA tournament, but eventually lost to LSU in the regional final to end the season with a 32–4 record.[41] After three down years by UConn standards, the team emerged as a heavy contender for the championship in the 2007–08 season. In addition to all of the star players returning from the 2006–07 team, #1 ranked high school player Maya Moore joined the Huskies after a bitter recruitment battle between UConn and Tennessee. Shortly after Moore's commitment to UConn, Tennessee announced they were cancelling the annual series with UConn, thus ending one of the biggest rivalries in the sport. Even if both coaches remained vague and unspecific about the reasons of the cancellation, Tennessee filed a complaint to the NCAA about UConn's recruitment of Moore. UConn was found to have committed a secondary violation (involving a tour of the ESPN campus) and no punishment was handed out.[42][43] Despite losing Mel Thomas and Kalana Greene to season-ending knee injuries, UConn went through the 2007–08 regular season with only a single loss at Rutgers, by two points, winning both the Big East regular season and tournament titles. Rallying from a 14-point deficit in the NCAA regional final, they beat conference rival Rutgers 66–56 and advanced to their first Final Four since Taurasi graduated in 2004. These tournament victories were largely credited to senior Charde Houston, a top-ranked recruit out of San Diego viewed as not living up to expectations from Geno Auriemma and the UConn fans up to that point, who came up with key rebounds and clutch points in those games.[44] In the National semifinals, played at the St. Pete Times Forum in Tampa, UConn lost to Stanford 82–73, ending its season with a 36–2 record. For the third consecutive year, UConn successfully recruited the top ranked high school player in Elena Delle Donne, but shortly before enrolling at UConn Delle Donne requested a release from her scholarship, giving up basketball in order to stay closer to home and play volleyball at the University of Delaware; Delle Donne would eventually play basketball at Delaware, having a great college career that culminated in the #2 pick in the 2013 WNBA draft.[45] Despite losing Delle Donne, the Huskies were ranked No. 1 in the preseason polls, having returned 10 players from their 2008 Final Four team (including All-Americans Maya Moore, Renee Montgomery and Tina Charles), in addition to Kalana Greene (who had recovered from her knee injury by this point). UConn finished the regular season undefeated for the 5th time in school history with a 30–0 record. They won their 17th Big East Regular Season title and their 15th Big East tournament title, beating the Louisville Cardinals in the championship game. The Huskies advanced to their 10th Final Four with an 83–64 victory over Arizona State, and then to their 6th NCAA Championship Game in program history by defeating Stanford, also by a score of 83–64. In the Championship Game, UConn defeated Louisville 76–54 with help from Charles' 25 points and 19 boards, ending the season with a perfect 39–0 record (with every victory by at least 10 points, a record of its own) and sixth national title.[46] For the second consecutive year (and the sixth time in school history), UConn finished their regular season undefeated, with an average margin of victory of 35.9 points. During the regular season, UConn played 11 games against ranked opponents (including 6 in the top ten), winning by an average margin of 24 points per game. They dominated the Big East tournament yet again, winning the championship game 60–32. Throughout the regular season and the Big East tournament, UConn's closest win was against Stanford, by 12 points. Leading up to the Final Four in San Antonio, UConn dominated teams from Southern, Temple, Iowa State and Florida State. Maya Moore and Tina Charles played little more than half the minutes of every game, with Moore averaging one point per minute played, and the team outscoring its opponents by an average of 47 points. In the Final Four UConn was finally challenged by Baylor and the 6-foot-8 freshman Brittney Griner;[47] Baylor trailed 39–26 at halftime, cut the deficit to 41–38 with 15 minutes remaining in the game, but UConn finally pulled away for a final score of 70–50. The national championship game against Stanford was a different story. UConn started the game with its worst first half in school history by scoring only 12 points; only 11 teams in tournament history have been held to 12 points or less in the first half: three of them were against UConn teams, and two of them (Southern and Temple) just days earlier in the 2010 Tournament. Stanford itself only managed to score 20 points in the first half. Maya Moore gave UConn the lead (23–22) in the second half with a three-pointer and led the team on a scoring run of 30–6 that eventually secured the national championship with a final score of 53–47.[48] It was the only game in the Huskies' 78-game winning streak that was won by fewer than 10 points. Moore was named the Tournament Most Outstanding Player, to go along with her second straight Wade Trophy award and Academic All-America of the Year award. Charles, who won the John R. Wooden Award and Naismith College Player of the Year awards,[49] was chosen first overall in the WNBA draft days later.[50] The 2010–11 season began with high hopes but much uncertainty for the Huskies. Maya Moore returned for her senior season after a summer with the U.S. National team, but UConn lost major contributors in Tina Charles and Kalana Greene, who graduated in 2010. Additionally, junior guard Caroline Doty would be out the entire season due to a third knee injury. In an early test, UConn squeaked by #2 Baylor in their second game of the season. They powered their way through 8 more consecutive wins for their 88th straight victory, beating #10 Ohio State at Madison Square Garden. Their 89th win came at home against #20 Florida State to set the college basketball record for most consecutive wins, previously held by the UCLA men's team. After a break in the schedule for the holidays, UConn traveled out west and beat the Pacific Tigers to stretch the streak to 90 games.[51] That game, however, was largely a warm-up match for their biggest test of the season, a December 30 matchup at the powerhouse Stanford Cardinals. UConn trailed for the entire game and lost for the first time since their April 6, 2008, Final Four appearance (also against the Cardinals). The loss ended the highly publicized winning streak, as well as their long-held spot as the top ranked team in women's basketball which was taken over by Baylor. Connecticut recovered focus after the loss and got through the rest of the regular season undefeated, regaining the #1 ranking along the way after Baylor's loss to Texas Tech in February. They marched through and won the Big East tournament, including their 3rd victory of the year over Notre Dame in the Big East tournament Championship Game. In the NCAA tournament Final Four, UConn met Notre Dame for the fourth time of the season, with the underdog Fighting Irish prevailing 72–63 and ending UConn's bid for a third straight national championship. The keys to Notre Dame's success were the stellar performance of sophomore Skylar Diggins and the hot shooting (over 50 percent from the field, a first against UConn in its last 262 games), while UConn had a lack of support for Moore's 36 points.[52] Notre Dame went on to the National Championship Game, but were ultimately defeated by the Texas A&M Aggies. During the 2010–11 season, Maya Moore posted career highs in scoring (22.3 ppg), assists (4.1 apg) and steals (2.2 spg), sweeping all possible individual honors: she won her 2nd Naismith College Player of the Year award, her 3rd straight Wade Trophy (only player in history - freshmen are not eligible for this award), her 2nd Associated Press Women's College Basketball Player of the Year award, her 2nd USBWA Women's National Player of the Year award and her 2nd John R. Wooden Award; she was also voted Big East Player of The Year (3rd time) and a fourth straight unanimous First-Team All-American in WBCA, USBWA and AP polls (second player ever after Oklahoma's Courtney Paris). In her astounding college career, Maya Moore won 150 games and only lost 4, amassing a total 3036 points (1st Husky ever and 4th all-time in NCAA division I women's basketball), 1276 rebounds (2nd Husky ever), 310 steals (3rd Husky ever), 544 assists (6th Husky ever) and 204 blocks (4th Husky ever); she is the only women's basketball player in Division I history to record 2500 points, 1000 rebounds, 500 assists, 250 steals and 150 blocked shots. On February 28, she was enshrined in the Huskies of Honor (3rd time ever for an active player). Maya Moore was also a brilliant college student: she graduated with a 3.7 GPA, earning the Elite 88 Award, and was named Cosida Academic All-America First-Team in 2009, 2010 and 2011, Cosida Academic All-America of the Year in 2010 and 2011 (1st player to ever repeat) and All-sports Academic All-America of the Year in 2011.[53] After graduation, Maya Moore was selected by the Minnesota Lynx as the 1st overall pick in the 2011 WNBA draft (4th time for a Husky), also becoming the first female basketball player signed to the Jordan Brand.[54] The 2011–12 season would inevitably be a new era after Maya Moore's graduation. Her absence and the loss of 6th-man Lorin Dixon left significant holes to fill in the roster. Geno Auriemma seemed to find the right pieces with a freshman class that included Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis, Brianna Banks and Kiah Stokes. Mosqueda-Lewis was another State Farm/WBCA High School Player of the Year for UConn,[55] Banks was a highly rated point guard,[56] and Stokes, a 6'3 post player, was highly ranked as well. Other key players included sophomores Stefanie Dolson and Bria Hartley, junior Kelly Faris and senior Tiffany Hayes, who would be all selected in the WNBA draft after graduation. Even if the Huskies were still a strong national contender, they were no longer viewed as a favorite to win it all. Two key rivals were the usual conference foe Notre Dame and the new rival Baylor, who had the nation's top player in Brittney Griner. In December Griner led #1 ranked Baylor against #2 UConn, scoring 25 points to go along with nine blocks. The 66–61 loss was UConn's first of the season, but not its last. Notre Dame, led by junior star Skylar Diggins, beat the Huskies twice in the regular season, but UConn was able to reverse the roles in the Big East tournament Championship Game; the win was the school's 15th conference title, as well as the 800th career win for coach Geno Auriemma. Ultimately Notre Dame found its revenge with an upset win in the NCAA Tournament Final Four, winning in overtime 83–75. The Fighting Irish finished the season with a 3–1 record against the Huskies, a record that would be repeated the following year. The 2012–13 season began with high hopes for UConn. The team landed three highly ranked recruits: #1 overall Breanna Stewart from Cicero – North Syracuse High School, forward Morgan Tuck and guard Moriah Jefferson. Their play was uneven during the regular season, where the team went 27–3 with a loss to Baylor and a pair of losses to Notre Dame (including a three-overtime game in South Bend); in the Big East tournament, UConn lost for a third straight time to Notre Dame, who delivered a last-minute comeback to win 61–59. However, in the NCAA tournament, key-players Stewart, Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis, Stefanie Dolson and senior Kelly Faris raised their level of play significantly, and UConn easily advanced to the Final Four. In the National Semifinals, the team handily beat Notre Dame 83–65, a rematch of the 2012 Final Four. Two days later, the Huskies obtained a 93–60 win over Louisville in the championship game to garner a record tying eighth national championship. UConn finished the season with a 35–4 overall record, with 3 of their losses to Notre Dame. The end of the 2012–13 season saw the breakup of the Big East Conference. First Pittsburgh, Syracuse, and Notre Dame defected to the Atlantic Coast Conference, with Louisville announcing that they would follow in 2014. Then, the non-FBS football playing members of the Big East (Georgetown, Villanova, Providence, DePaul, Marquette, Seton Hall, St. John's), known colloquially as the \"Catholic 7\", left to form their own conference, taking the conference name with them. The remaining teams of the former Big East (Connecticut and Cincinnati) joined the new American Athletic Conference (The American or AAC), thus ending the UConn–Notre Dame rivalry in conference tournaments.[57] With Faris and Doty graduated, sophomore Breanna Stewart became the undisputed leader of the 2013–14 UConn team, starting in all 40 games and leading the team with 19.4 points and 2.8 blocks per game; her 291 field goals made was the third-highest single-season total in UConn history. The Huskies beat every opponent by at least 10 points, with their average margin being 34 points, and easily reached the NCAA tournament finals. In the Final Four, the Huskies routed No. 3 Stanford with a 75–56 victory to advance to the championship game. There, they met unbeaten Notre Dame, making it the first matchup of two undefeated teams in the championship game. UConn defeated Notre Dame 79–58 (hindered by the loss of one of their stars, Natalie Achonwa, who had torn her ACL in the Elite Eight) to finish the season 40–0, tying Baylor for the most wins in a season and setting a new record for national championships with nine.[58] Breanna Stewart was named the AP Player of the year, only the third time in history a sophomore has won the honor. With the UConn men's basketball team winning the championship in 2014 as well, UConn became the only school in NCAA history to have both their men's and women's teams win a national championship in the same year, and do it twice (first time was 2004). The 2014–15 regular season started with an overtime loss to Stanford in the team's second game of the season, ending a 47-game winning streak for UConn. Led by juniors Stewart and Jefferson, as well as senior Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis, UConn quickly recovered and won every remaining regular season game, including a 76–58 win against rival Notre Dame. In the NCAA Tournament, both Connecticut and Notre Dame were seeded first in their respective playoff brackets; each advanced to the Final Four as well. Connecticut handily defeated Maryland 81–58, while Notre Dame narrowly beat South Carolina, 66–65, in the National Semifinals. The two teams met on April 7, 2015, in the national championship game. UConn won by a score of 63–53 to achieve their third straight national championship and tenth total, with coach Auriemma tying a record set by John Wooden in college basketball.[59] The Huskies 10-point margin of victory in the championship game was their smallest since 2010. Their margins of victory in the 2013, 2014, and 2016 championship games were all above 20 points. UConn finished the season with a 38–1 overall record (18–0 in AAC play). In 2015 UConn landed another top recruit in #1 High School prospect Katie Lou Samuelson; she quickly earned a spot in the starting five alongside sophomore Kia Nurse and seniors Breanna Stewart, Moriah Jefferson and Morgan Tuck. The team was unstoppable all season long, beating every opponent by an average of 39.7 points, and easily winning the conference regular season and tournament. While other #1 seeds Notre Dame, South Carolina and Baylor suffered early upsets in the NCAA Tournament, UConn easily advanced to the Final Four, where they defeated Oregon State 80–51. In the championship game, the Huskies defeated old Big East rival Syracuse 82–51 to complete their sixth undefeated season, while also winning their 11th overall championship and 4th consecutive one. Geno Auriemma became the only coach in college basketball history to have won 11 titles, surpassing UCLA legend John Wooden (who has 10).[60] UConn finished the season with a perfect 38–0 record. Senior Breanna Stewart was named the Final Four Most Outstanding Player for a record 4th straight time; she also performed a back-to-back sweep of all individual honors, winning her 2nd straight Wade Trophy, a record 3rd Associated Press Women's College Basketball Player of the Year award, a record 3rd USBWA Women's National Player of the Year award, a record 3rd Naismith College Player of the Year award and her 2nd straight John R. Wooden Award. Stewart finished with 2,676 points (2nd Husky ever), 1,179 rebounds (4th Husky ever), 426 assists and 414 blocked shots (1st Husky ever). She was also the #1 overall pick in the 2016 WNBA draft.[61] Moriah Jefferson finished with a program-record 659 assists and a back-to-back Nancy Lieberman Award as best point guard in the nation. The trio of Stewart-Jefferson-Tuck ended their college career with a 151–5 record, the most victories for any group of college basketball players; they are the only 4-time winners in college basketball history (freshmen were not eligible to play during the UCLA men's streak). With their eleventh championship win in 2016, the UConn Huskies tied the UCLA Bruins men's team for most college basketball championships, and became the first Division I women's basketball team to win four straight national championships. After losing the stellar trio of Stewart, Jefferson and Tuck, many predicted a sub-par season for UConn standards; the AP Poll ranked the team third in the nation, and coach Auriemma had designed a very tough non-conference calendar to test the strength of his young team. The first regular season game, a 2-point win against #12 Florida State, seemed to confirm the expectations, with coach Auriemma predicting \"a good beat\" ahead.[62] As the season progressed, however, the team quickly found its rhythm, beating ranked teams like Baylor, Notre Dame and Maryland, and showcasing a talented core of young players. With sophomore Katie Lou Samuelson and junior Kia Nurse, the only returning starters, the duo of sophomore Napheesa Collier and junior Gabby Williams quickly rose to national attention; even senior Saniya Chong, who had played only few minutes in her first three seasons, showed great improvements, leading the nation in assists-to-turnovers ratio.[63] Coming from a 75-win streak in the previous season, UConn tied its own previous 90-win record with a 102–37 win against South Florida on January 10, 2017;[64] the 100th straight win mark was reached on February 13, 2017, with a 66–55 win against South Carolina.[65] After easy wins in both the conference regular season and conference tournament, UConn entered the NCAA tournament unbeaten, #1 overall, and once again a heavy favorite to win it all. However, the season came to an unexpected end when Mississippi State's Morgan William hit a buzzer-beater to give its team a 66–64 overtime victory in the NCAA Final Four.[66] The loss ended the streak at 111 consecutive wins, an all-time record not only for college basketball, but also for any team sport played at the college level.[67] UConn's overall record for the season was 36–1. UConn entered the 2017–18 season with high energy. The team gained a 5-star recruiting class that included future All-American player Megan Walker. On December 19, 2017, a win over Oklahoma gave coach Geno Auriemma his 1000th victory in just 1135 games, making him only the fourth women's coach to reach that plateau — preceded by Pat Summitt, Tara VanDerveer and Sylvia Hatchell — and the fastest one.[68] UConn finished the regular season 16–0 in AAC play to win the AAC regular season championship. The Huskies ultimately defeated Tulane, Cincinnati, and South Florida to win the AAC women's tournament title. As a result, they received the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA women's tournament. As the overall No. 1 seed again, they defeated Saint Francis (PA) and Quinnipiac to advance to the Sweet Sixteen. They then defeated Duke in the Sweet Sixteen and South Carolina in the Elite Eight to reach their 19th Final Four. In the National semifinals, they lost in overtime on a last-second shot for the second consecutive year, this time to Notre Dame, ending an undefeated season yet again. Notre Dame would go onto win the national championship with a buzzer-beater against Mississippi State. The Huskies ended their season with a 36–1 overall record for the second straight year. UConn entered the 2018–19 season with another 5-star recruiting class that included Christyn Williams, a highly decorated high-school guard and future 2-time All-Big East First Team player. The team started the year with an 11–0 run, which included an 89–71 win at No. 1 Notre Dame on December 2. The Huskies were ranked #1 in the nation for the next 5 weeks until they lost their first game at No. 8 Baylor on January 3, 2019. Baylor would go on to win the title later in the year against Notre Dame. UConn again finished their regular season with a record of 16–0 in AAC play to win the AAC regular season championship. Ranked #2 in the nation at the start of their conference tournament, the Huskies defeated East Carolina, South Florida, and UCF to win the AAC women's tournament title for the 6th straight year. As a result, they received the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA women's tournament. As a No. 2 seed, UConn defeated Towson and Buffalo to advance to the Sweet Sixteen. Then, they defeated UCLA in the Sweet Sixteen and Louisville in the Elite Eight to reach their 20th Final Four. In the National semifinals, they lost in the rematch of last year's game to Notre Dame, 81–76. UConn ended the season with a 35–3 overall record, their worst since 2013. UConn began the 2019–20 season with a 12–0 run and reached #1 in the AP poll by New Year's Day. Their first loss was against No. 8 Baylor on January 9, 2020, at the XL Center. The Huskies lost twice more against No. 3 Oregon and at No. 1 South Carolina during the regular season. At the conclusion of the 2019–20 regular season, UConn had a record of 26–3. They went 16–0 in the AAC and were the conference regular season champions. Then, they won the AAC tournament for the 7th year in a row, defeating Cincinnati in the title game 87–53 on March 9, 2020. UConn received an automatic bid to the 2020 NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament, but the tournament was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The team finished the season ranked number 5 in the AP poll, and with a 29–3 overall record. This was the last year that the Huskies played in the American Athletic Conference, as they left to join several of their former conference mates in the Big East Conference in July 2020. UConn dominated women's basketball during their time in the American, going undefeated in all seven of their regular seasons in AAC play and winning every conference tournament during their membership. The Huskies entered the 2020–2021 season with extremely high hopes. They gained two ESPN five-star recruits with the addition of point guard Paige Bueckers and forward Aaliyah Edwards, as well as future 2-time Big East Defensive Player of the Year Nika Mühl. This season also marked the teams return to the Big East Conference, which they had previously left in 2013 to join the AAC. UConn was ranked no. 3 in both the AP and Coaches pre-season polls. During the regular season, they had a record of 21–1, including 18–0 in the Big East to win the conference regular season championship. UConn won the Big East tournament, winning all three of their games by over 30 points. As a no. 1 seed in the NCAA tournament, they won their region with a narrow victory over no. 5 ranked Baylor in the Elite Eight, 69–67. UConn then lost to Arizona in the Final Four, 69–59, and finished their campaign with a record of 28–2. Bueckers, the team's leading scorer, won several awards at the end of the season, including the Naismith College Player of the Year. The season was heavily affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with numerous game cancellations and no spectators allowed at any sporting events. Returning from a 28–2 season with no graduations, UConn went into the 2021–22 season highly regarded, starting the season ranked 2nd in the AP poll. The Huskies returned three seniors and sophomore consensus 2020–21 NCAA player of the year Paige Bueckers, while adding a 2nd ranked recruiting class that included number-one ranked high school recruit Azzi Fudd. Several athletes transferred during the offseason and early season, leaving the team with 12 players. Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic continued to cause game postponements and cancellations. Injuries plagued the team; only two athletes played every game. In December, Bueckers suffered a knee fracture which kept her sidelined until late in the season. With Bueckers out, UConn's offense struggled against several teams, with losses against unranked Georgia Tech and no. 6 Louisville before semester break, no. 9 Oregon in January, and unranked Big East Conference opponent Villanova in February. Coach Auriemma had the team focus on defense, keeping the Huskies in games when their offense was struggling. Nine different players started, and Auriemma tried eleven different starting lineups during the season. By the time Bueckers returned to the lineup for limited minutes, the Huskies were dominating without her. After winning the Big East regular season championship, the team won the 2022 Big East tournament and accepted an automatic bid to the 2022 NCAA Division I tournament, where they were awarded a No. 2 seed. In the NCAA tournament, in the Bridgeport Region, UConn beat 15th seed Mercer, 7th seed UCF, 3rd seed Indiana and 1st seed NC State in double overtime to reach the Final Four for a record 14th consecutive year. They then beat long-time rival and defending national champions Stanford 63–58 to reach the national championship game for the first time since 2016.[69] However, they ultimately lost to the number one overall seed South Carolina, 64–49. UConn entered the 2022–23 season with six returning starters, including the backcourt of Paige Bueckers, Azzi Fudd, and Nika Mühl, as well as forwards Dorka Juhász, Aaliyah Edwards, and Caroline Ducharme. With this line-up, UConn was expected to win the much-improved Big East again and be highly competitive in the NCAA tournament. However, the team became plagued by injuries before the season even began. Bueckers tore an ACL in a pickup game before fall workouts, and five-star recruit Ice Brady suffered a tendon dislocation during an early practice; both players underwent season ending surgeries and sat on the bench all season.[70][71] UConn ultimately finished their regular season with an overall record of 26–5 and a conference record of 18–2. They won the Big East regular season championship and were the top seed in the Big East tournament. Azzi Fudd and Caroline Ducharme, who both missed a significant part of the regular season due to injury, returned in time for the conference tournament. With the UConn squad healthy for the first time since its first games, the Huskies methodically notched three consecutive wins to emerge as the Big East champions, getting the automatic bid to the 2023 NCAA women's basketball tournament, where they were awarded a No. 2 seed. The team advanced to the Sweet 16, where they lost to No. 3-seeded Ohio State, 73–61.[72] This was the first time the team failed to make the Final Four since 2007, and was also the first time they had failed to make the Elite Eight since 2005. After gaining a high school recruiting class ranked #4 in the nation, UConn entered the 2023–24 season ranked second in pre-season polls. However, they lost three early non-conference games and several key players to injury by midseason. On February 7, 2024, Geno Auriemma became just the third college basketball coach to reach 1,200 wins when the Huskies defeated Seton Hall.[73] Later that season, UConn won the 2024 Big East Tournament and was awarded a No. 3 seed in the Portland 3 regional of the 2024 NCAA tournament. Despite being plagued by injuries yet again, the Huskies defeated No. 1-seeded USC 80–73 in the Elite Eight to advance to the Final Four in what Geno Auriemma described as the teams most surprising run since their first Final Four appearance in 1991.[74] However, the team narrowly lost to No. 1-seeded Iowa in the National semifinals, 71–69.[75] National champion Postseason invitational champion Conference regular season champion Conference regular season and conference tournament champion Division regular season champion Division regular season and conference tournament champion Conference tournament champion UConn played in the Big East Conference from the 1982–83 season, the first in which the league sponsored women's basketball and held a tournament, until the conference split in 2013. The Huskies won 18 tournaments in 31 years.[77] From 2013–14 to 2019–20, UConn played in the American Athletic Conference, where they went unbeaten both in regular season and conference tournament games, with a perfect 139–0 record and 7 conference tournaments. In 2020–21, UConn rejoined several of its former conference mates in the current Big East Conference.[57] The Huskies have appeared in the NCAA tournament 34 times, every year since their first appearance in 1989. Their combined record is 128–24 .842; they have been to 23 Final Fours and are 11-time National Champions (1995, 2000, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2009, 2010, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016).[78] The following lists where the Huskies have been seeded in the NCAA tournament. Sandra Hamm, a Terryville native, was employed part-time as the interim women's coach in the 1974–1975 season, when the team was 2–8. When she wasn't coaching, she taught physical education at a junior high school in Manchester.[79] After graduating from college in California, Wanda Flora went to graduate school at Indiana University, where she was an assistant coach for the women's basketball team and coached the junior varsity team. After a brief stint at a small college in Pennsylvania, she applied for the job at UConn, starting in 1975 and leading the team to a 38–66 record in five seasons. During her tenure, shooting guard Karen Mullins was the first UConn woman to receive a basketball scholarship; that number had increased to 12 by 1980. In 1980 the university hired Jean Balthaser, who had coached at the University of Pittsburgh. Ms. Balthaser continued to expand the program, leading UConn to its first winning season in her first year as coach, and finishing with a 52–88 record over five seasons. In his 38 years as head coach of the University of Connecticut women's basketball team, the Italian-born Luigi \"Geno\" Auriemma has inextricably linked his name with that of the team. Inheriting a program that had only had one winning season in its entire history, Auriemma has overseen one of the most successful rebuilding projects in college sports history. Under his watch, UConn has become the winningest team in women's college basketball, and he has made a strong case as one of the best coaches ever.[80][81][82] In his astonishing career Auriemma has won more than 25 different national Coach of the Year awards and was inducted into both the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame and the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame. He was head coach of the United States women's national basketball team from 2009 until stepping down from that role after the 2016 Summer Olympics. During his tenure with Team USA, they won the 2010 and 2014 World Cups, plus Olympic gold medals in 2012 and 2016. UConn has featured a great number of star players, All-Americans, Hall of Famers and recipients of individual trophies. The following table shows the UConn players recipients of the major individual awards in women's college basketball. After the end of the NCAA tournament, the Associated Press selects a Most Outstanding Player. Seven UConn players received this award since its induction in 1982: Rebecca Lobo (1995), Sue Bird (2002), Swin Cash (2002), Diana Taurasi (2003 and 2004), Tina Charles (2009), Maya Moore (2010), and Breanna Stewart who won 4 times (2013, 2014, 2015, 2016). Statistics correct through December 17, 2024.[83][84][85][86][87] Players active in 2024-2025 are in bold. Most points (1000-point club) Most rebounds (top-15) Most assists (top-15) Most steals (top-15) Most blocks (top-15) Most 3-Point Field Goals Made (top-15) The Huskies of Honor is a program recognizing the most significant figures in UConn history, with plaques in Gampel Pavilion commemorating the inductees. The women's basketball players list includes guards Sue Bird, Bria Hartley, Moriah Jefferson, Renee Montgomery, Shea Ralph, Jennifer Rizzotti, Nykesha Sales, and Diana Taurasi; forwards Svetlana Abrosimova, Swin Cash, Napheesa Collier, Maya Moore, Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis, Katie Lou Samuelson, Breanna Stewart, Morgan Tuck, and Gabby Williams; centers Kerry Bascom, Tina Charles, Stefanie Dolson, Rebecca Lobo, and Kara Wolters. On December 7, 2018, UConn announced that the #50 worn by Rebecca Lobo would be permanently retired, effective with ceremonies to be held during the Huskies' final 2018–19 home game on March 2, 2019. In its announcement, UConn stated that going forward, number retirement would be reserved for former Huskies players inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, as Lobo was in 2017. At the same time, the Huskies announced that the #34 worn by Ray Allen, a 2018 Naismith Hall inductee, would be retired by UConn men's basketball, with ceremonies held during the season's final men's home game on March 3, 2019.[88] UConn's announcement did not make it clear whether both numbers would be retired across both men's and women's programs, but a university spokesperson clarified that the retirements applied only to the teams that Lobo and Allen competed for, meaning that #50 remains available in men's basketball and #34 in women's.[89] Additionally, on November 14, 2022, UConn retired the #32 worn by Swin Cash, as she was a 2022 Naismith Hall inductee, with ceremonies held during the women's team game against Texas.[90] Twenty UConn players have been selected in the first round of WNBA drafts. Five of them have been first overall picks: Sue Bird (2002), Diana Taurasi (2004), Tina Charles (2010), Maya Moore (2011), and Breanna Stewart (2016). Rebecca Lobo was part of the 1997 inaugural draft, with the top players allocated to founding teams without any particular order; similarly Nykesha Sales was part of the 1998 WNBA expansion players allocation. In the 2002 WNBA draft, the four UConn players tabbed \"TASS Force\" (Tamika Williams, Asjha Jones, Sue Bird, Swin Cash) were all first round selections, each having immediate impact with their WNBA team.[91] In the 2016 WNBA draft UConn performed even better, with the three seniors Breanna Stewart, Moriah Jefferson and Morgan Tuck sweeping the first three picks for the first time in the history of any major sport.[92] Roster Last update: April 28, 2024 Team of the Decade 2000–2009 In 2010 Sports Illustrated selected the top 25 sports franchises of the decade 2000–2009. The sports under consideration were the four major professional sports (NFL, MLB, NBA and NHL) along with the three most prominent college sports: football, men's basketball and women's basketball. The Connecticut Huskies were the #3 selection on the list, behind only the professional basketball Lakers and the professional football Patriots, making the Connecticut women's basketball team the highest ranked of the collegiate teams for the three sports under consideration.[93] During this period, UConn won five national titles, while making the Final Four seven of the ten years. Two of the seasons (2001–02 and 2008–09) resulted in perfect 39–0 records. Active streaks in bold",

                "content": "Patrick Lavon Mahomes II[5] (/məˈhoʊmz/;[6] born September 17, 1995) is an American professional football quarterback for the Kansas City Chiefs of the National Football League (NFL). Mahomes has led the Chiefs to six consecutive AFC Championship Game appearances and four Super Bowl appearances since becoming the team's starting quarterback in 2018. He is one of five quarterbacks in NFL history to win three or more Super Bowls as a starter.[7][8] Mahomes's career accolades through seven seasons in the NFL have earned him widespread praise from sports journalists, and he is considered to be one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time.[9][10][11] Mahomes played college football and baseball for the Texas Tech Red Raiders. Following his sophomore year, he quit baseball to focus solely on football.[12] In his junior year, he led all NCAA Division I FBS players in multiple categories including passing yards (5,052) and total touchdowns (53). He was selected 10th overall by the Kansas City Chiefs in the 2017 NFL draft. Mahomes spent his rookie season as the backup to Alex Smith. He was named the starter in 2018 after the Chiefs traded Smith to the Washington Redskins. That season, Mahomes threw for 5,097 yards, 50 touchdowns, and 12 interceptions. He became the only quarterback in history to throw for more than 5,000 yards in a single season in both college and in the NFL. He joined Peyton Manning as the only players in NFL history to throw for 5,000 yards and 50 passing touchdowns in the same season.[13] For his performance in his first season as starter, he was named to the Pro Bowl, named first-team All-Pro, and won the NFL Offensive Player of the Year and NFL Most Valuable Player awards. Mahomes is one of four black quarterbacks to win the AP MVP award.[b][14] In the 2019 season, Mahomes led the Chiefs to Super Bowl LIV, their first Super Bowl appearance in 50 years, where they defeated the San Francisco 49ers.[15] Mahomes was awarded the Super Bowl MVP for his performance, the second black quarterback and youngest overall to do so.[c][16] He is also the third African American quarterback to win a Super Bowl.[d] In 2020, Mahomes signed a 10-year contract extension worth $477 million with another $26 million in potential bonuses, for a total of $503 million, making it the fourth-largest known contract in sporting history.[18][19] The year after signing his contract, he led the Chiefs to their second consecutive Super Bowl appearance, but they lost to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Super Bowl LV. In the 2022 season, Mahomes won his second career NFL MVP and his second Super Bowl MVP in Super Bowl LVII after the Chiefs defeated the Philadelphia Eagles, becoming the first player to win NFL MVP and Super Bowl MVP in the same year since Kurt Warner in 1999, and joined Tom Brady and Joe Montana as the only quarterbacks to win multiple regular season and Super Bowl MVPs.[20][21] In the 2023 season, he won his third Super Bowl MVP after the Chiefs defeated the 49ers in Super Bowl LVIII. Mahomes was born on September 17, 1995, in Tyler, Texas.[22] His father is Pat Mahomes, a former Major League Baseball (MLB) pitcher,[23] and his mother is Randi Martin.[24] Mahomes has a younger brother, Jackson, who is a social media influencer.[25][26][27] Mahomes's parents divorced in 2006.[24] His half-brother through his father, Graham Walker, plays football at Brown.[28] He is also the godson of former MLB pitcher LaTroy Hawkins, who was his father's teammate on the Minnesota Twins.[29] Mahomes is biracial,[30] as his father is black[31] and his mother is white.[30] Mahomes attended Whitehouse High School in Whitehouse, Texas.[32] He played football, baseball, and basketball.[33] Mahomes believes that training in pitching and playing basketball improved his quarterback skills.[34] In football, he had 4,619 passing yards, 50 passing touchdowns, 948 rushing yards, and 15 rushing touchdowns as a senior in high school. In baseball, he threw a no-hitter with 16 strikeouts in a game his senior year.[35] He was named the Maxpreps Male Athlete of the Year for 2013–2014.[36] Mahomes was rated by Rivals.com as a three-star football recruit and was ranked as the 12th best dual-threat quarterback in his class. He received offers from Texas Tech, Rice, and Houston.[37] He committed to Texas Tech University.[38] Mahomes was also a top prospect for the 2014 Major League Baseball draft, but was not expected to be selected high due to his commitment to Texas Tech.[39][40][41] He was selected by the Detroit Tigers in the 37th round of the 2014 MLB draft, but did not sign a contract.[42] Mahomes entered his freshman season at Texas Tech as a backup to Davis Webb.[43] He saw his first career action against the Oklahoma State Cowboys after Webb left the game with an injury, completing two of five passes for 20 yards for one touchdown and an interception.[44] After Webb was again injured, Mahomes started his first career game against the Texas Longhorns.[45] He completed 13 of 21 passes for 109 yards in the 34–13 loss.[46][47] Mahomes remained the starter for the season's final three games.

The shoe was called the Mahomes 1 Impact FLX and was released on August 23.[275] In 2022, Mahomes appeared in a commercial for Coors Light. NFL rules prohibit players from endorsing alcohol products, so the product in the commercial was a Coors flashlight instead of beer.[276] In 2023, he appeared in commercials for cellphone provider T-Mobile.[277] Also in 2023, he signed an endorsement deal with the beverage manufacturer Prime.[278] In April 2019, Mahomes announced the establishment of a nonprofit organization called the 15 and the Mahomies Foundation.[279] The nonprofit's website states that it is \"dedicated to improving the lives of children\".[280] Following the murder of George Floyd by police officer Derek Chauvin, Mahomes, along with teammate Tyrann Mathieu and several other NFL players, made a video encouraging the NFL to condemn police brutality and violence against black people and to admit it was wrong to silence Colin Kaepernick and Eric Reid for their protests during the playing of the National Anthem.[281] Mahomes and Mathieu started a voter registration project in Kansas City. The project encouraged residents to register to vote in the 2020 presidential election. He worked with the Chiefs to encourage players to vote. He joined LeBron James' Rock the Vote initiative to encourage people to register and vote.[282] Mahomes was named to the Time 100 list of most influential people of 2020,[283] 2023,[284] and 2024.[285] In 2024, Mahomes donated $5 million to his alma mater, Texas Tech, to assist with stadium and football center projects.[286] In 2020, Mahomes joined the Kansas City Royals ownership group as a minority stakeholder.[287] In 2021, he joined Sporting Club, the ownership group of the Major League Soccer franchise Sporting Kansas City.[288] Mahomes is a member of an ownership group of an upcoming professional pickleball team based in Miami, Florida. The ownership group also includes Naomi Osaka, Nick Kyrgios, and Rich Paul.[289] Mahomes joined the ownership group of the NWSL's Kansas City Current in 2023. His wife has been a member of the ownership group since the team was established.[290] In 2023, Mahomes (as well as Travis Kelce) became an investor in the Alpine racing team of Formula One.[291] In 2021, Mahomes became an investor in a group to expand the Whataburger fast food restaurant franchise to Missouri and Kansas. The locations will primarily be in the Kansas City metropolitan area and the Wichita, Kansas metropolitan area, and multiple locations in between the cities.[292] In 2024, Mahomes, along with the rest of the ownership group of the Current, expressed interest in bringing a WNBA expansion franchise to Kansas City. They cited the success of the Current, the WNBA expanding to add teams in San Francisco, Portland, and Toronto by 2026, and the WNBA hoping to have 16 teams by 2028. The bid is likely to have competition from other cities like St. Louis and Philadelphia.[293][294]",

                "content": "Editions: En/nfl/kansas-city-chiefs Mahomes was a multi-talented athlete before settling on football Patrick Mahomes is known for being one of the most talented quarterbacks to take the field in the NFL. However, the Chiefs star wasn't limited to just playing football when he was younger. During high school he was a talented basketball player, averaging more than 19 points and eight rebounds a game. He also showed his skills on the diamond, with his father having played in the MLB. As a result he spent countless hours playing with his dad, and could have perhaps pursued a career in baseball had things gone differently. Related: While taking part in a \"Would You Rather?\" promotion video with Jake from State Farm, Mahomes was asked whether he preferred basketball or baseball as his 'other sport' aside from football. Despite baseball being in the family, Mahomes went the other way and picked the hard court: \"100 percent basketball.\" Mahomes' basketball career was profiled by ESPN earlier this year. The piece included Golden State Warriors star Stephen Curry complimenting Mahomes for his creativity on the court, though he noted that his jump shot needed some work. \"It goes in...in doesn't always have to be pretty. I'm not gonna shoot like Steph,\" was Mahomes' response. Known for his playmaking skills on the field and his ability to get away from defenders, Mahomes believes he developed those skills while playing basketball. \"The skills of playing the point guard position specifically really helped me... if you watch me scrambling around, it's the same thing,\" said Mahomes. \"I look like I'm moving slow, but I'm getting where I need to get to. And I feel like in basketball, I was the same way.\" © Unidad Editorial Información Deportiva, S.L.U. All rights reserved. Follow us",

                "title": "Kirk Cousins - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Kirk Daniel Cousins (born August 19, 1988) is an American professional football quarterback for the Atlanta Falcons of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Michigan State Spartans and was selected by the Washington Redskins in the fourth round of the 2012 NFL draft. Cousins ranks sixth all-time in completion percentage with at least 1,500 pass attempts[2] and is 11th in the NFL's all-time regular season career passer rating. Cousins spent his first three seasons with the Redskins as a backup to Robert Griffin III before replacing an injured Griffin in 2015 and leading the team to a division title. With Washington, Cousins set several franchise records and was named to the 2017 Pro Bowl. After two years of signing franchise tags and being unable to agree with the team on a long-term deal, Cousins signed a fully guaranteed three-year US$84 million contract with the Minnesota Vikings as a free agent in 2018. In six seasons with the Vikings, he earned three Pro Bowl selections and ranks third in the Vikings' all-time passing yards list. Cousins signed a four-year deal with the Falcons in 2024. Kirk Cousins was born to Don Cousins[3] and Maryann Cousins, the second oldest of their three children. Born in Barrington, Illinois[4][5] on August 19, 1988,[4] Cousins attended Holland Christian High School in Holland, Michigan, where he starred in football, baseball (as a third baseman and a pitcher), and basketball for the Maroons athletic teams. He broke his ankle in his junior year and was forced to attend camps in order to make an impression with recruiting colleges.[6] Cousins finished his high school football career with 3,204 passing yards, 40 touchdowns, and 18 interceptions.[7] After high school, Cousins was set to sign with Toledo or Western Michigan, until Mark Dantonio became the head coach at Michigan State in 2007. After Dantonio failed to sign his top targets at quarterback, he offered a scholarship to Cousins, which he accepted. He also participated in the Athletes in Action sports ministry.[citation needed] Sources: Cousins redshirted for the 2007 season.[8] In 2008, he spent the season as the backup quarterback to Brian Hoyer. He played in five games passing for a total of 310 yards and two touchdowns and one interception.[9][10] In 2009, he competed for and won the starting quarterback job against teammate Keith Nichol. He led Michigan State to a 6–7 (4–4) season with 19 touchdowns, nine interceptions and 2,680 passing yards in 12 games.[11] In 2010, he led Michigan State to an 11–2 (7–1) record and a share of the Big Ten Conference Championship.[12][13][14] In 2011, the Spartans went 11–3 (7–2) and played in the first-ever Big Ten Football Championship Game.[15][16] He led the Big Ten Conference in pass completions, pass attempts, and passing yards in 2011.[17] Cousins was named second-team All-Big Ten by the coaches, and played his final game as a Michigan State Spartan on January 2, 2012, defeating the Georgia Bulldogs in the Outback Bowl.[18] His teams posted an undefeated 4–0 record against the in-state rival Michigan Wolverines.[19] Cousins won the 2011 Lowes's Senior CLASS Award.[20] Cousins majored in kinesiology.[21] Cousins was selected by the Washington Redskins as the seventh choice in the fourth round of the 2012 NFL draft, making him the 102nd draft pick overall.[25] The pick surprised many analysts, as the Redskins had drafted 2011 Heisman Trophy winner Robert Griffin III with the second overall pick to be their franchise quarterback. The Redskins acquired the Griffin pick by giving the St. Louis Rams four high-value draft picks over three years.[26] Cousins was viewed as an insurance policy in case Griffin was injured, with Redskins head coach Mike Shanahan saying \"You're one or two plays away from being the starter...And if I see that value out there on the third day of the draft, I'm going to take that.\"[27] The Redskins drafting Griffin and Cousins in the same draft echoed the team's strategy in the 1994 NFL draft, when the team drafted Heath Shuler with the third overall pick and later drafted Gus Frerotte in the seventh round.[28] On May 31, 2012, Cousins signed a four-year contract with the Redskins.[29] In the second game of the preseason against the Chicago Bears, Cousins threw three touchdowns in the fourth quarter, though the Redskins would go on to lose 33–31.[30] In the fourth and final game of preseason, against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Cousins completed 15 of 27 passes for 222 yards as the Redskins won 30–3. He was named the backup quarterback over incumbent starter Rex Grossman. Cousins made his NFL debut in the third quarter of a Week 5 loss to the Atlanta Falcons after Griffin suffered a concussion. Cousins threw his first NFL touchdown pass on a 77-yard pass to Santana Moss but threw two interceptions in the last two series of the game while trying to tie the game.[31] Cousins' second NFL appearance came in Week 14 against the Baltimore Ravens. On the final drive of the game, with the Redskins down 8, Griffin suffered a knee injury. Cousins went 2–2 and finished the drive with an 11-yard touchdown pass to Pierre Garçon with 29 seconds remaining, to bring the Redskins within 2 points of the Ravens. On the two-point conversion, Shanahan called for a run-pass option, and Cousins scored on a quarterback draw to tie the game at 28. The Redskins would win in overtime 31–28.[32] The following week, on December 15, 2012, Cousins was announced as the Redskins starter for the Week 15 game against the Cleveland Browns, marking his first NFL start.[33] After a slow first half, Cousins rallied the offense to a 28-point second half. Cousins finished the day 26-of-37 for 329 yards with 2 touchdown passes, bringing the Redskins a 38–21 win.[34][35] Later that week, Cousins was voted the Pepsi NFL Rookie of the Week, becoming the third Redskins rookie to receive the honor that season (after Griffin and Alfred Morris).[36] Cousins finished his rookie year with 466 passing yards, four touchdowns, and three interceptions in three games and one start.[37] The Redskins finished atop the NFC East with a 10–6 record.[38] In the Wild Card Round, they faced the Seattle Seahawks. In the 24–14 loss, Cousins came into the game late in the fourth quarter in relief of an injured Griffin. He finished the game 3-of-10 for 31 yards and was unable to rally the team to victory.[39] On December 11, 2013, Cousins was named starting quarterback for the rest of the year after Shanahan deactivated Robert Griffin III for the remainder of the season in order to protect him for the following year, with Rex Grossman as Cousins's backup.[40][41] In Week 15, in a narrow 27–26 loss to the Falcons, he finished 29-of-45 for 381 yards, three touchdowns, and two interceptions.[42] Cousins finished his second professional season with 854 passing yards, four touchdowns, and seven interceptions in five games and three starts.[43] On February 2, 2014, it was reported that Cousins had stated that he was open to a trade from the Redskins.[44] In March, Cousins announced that he would be giving the #12 jersey to incoming new wide receiver Andre Roberts for the price of a $12,000 donation to the Kirk Cousins Football Camp. Cousins then switched over to the #8 jersey, a number he wore throughout his high school and college career.[45] During Week 2 against the Jacksonville Jaguars, Cousins came in relief of Griffin who left the game with a dislocated ankle. Cousins finished the game with 250 passing yards and two touchdowns in a 41–10 victory.[46] In the next game against the Philadelphia Eagles, Cousins threw for 427 yards, the first game he had over 400 passing yards. Washington still lost an ensuing slugfest to the Eagles 37–34.[47] The following week against the New York Giants, Cousins had a poor showing, throwing for a touchdown with four interceptions and a lost fumble.[48] The Redskins were blown out 45–14 with a total of 6 turnovers. In Week 5, against the defending Super Bowl champion Seahawks, Cousins showed progress from the embarrassing loss to the Giants by throwing for two touchdowns without an interception, including a 68-yard touchdown pass to DeSean Jackson. Despite the solid performance from Cousins, the Redskins lost by a score of 27–17.[49] Following a poor performance in the first half in the Week 7 game against the Tennessee Titans, he was benched at halftime in favor of backup quarterback Colt McCoy, and did not play in any more games for the remainder of the season.[50] On August 31, 2015, Cousins was named the starter for the season over Robert Griffin III.[51] On October 4, Cousins led a 90-yard game-winning drive against the Eagles, his first since 2012, when he threw a touchdown pass to Pierre Garçon with under a minute left in the fourth quarter, winning the game 23–20.[52] On October 25, Cousins helped lead the Redskins to their largest comeback win in franchise history. After being down 24–0 in the second quarter against the Buccaneers at home, Cousins finished with 317 yards and four total touchdowns, three passing and one rushing, throwing the final touchdown pass to Jordan Reed in the final seconds of the game.[53] Cousins also tied a franchise record for completions in a game with 33, tying Jason Campbell who did the same in 2007. When heading into the locker room after the game, Cousins was caught on camera shouting, \"You like that?!\" to reporters, which later become a catchphrase used by Cousins, his teammates, and Redskins fans throughout the rest of the season.[54] Cousins and his brother Kyle applied to trademark the catchphrase later in the season and began to sell T-shirts with the phrase to raise money for the International Justice Mission charitable organization.[55][56][57][58] He was named National Football Conference (NFC) Offensive Player of the Week for his game against Tampa Bay.[59] Against the New Orleans Saints on November 15, Cousins threw for a career-high four touchdowns, as well as posting a perfect passer rating of 158.3, making him the first Redskins quarterback since 1950 to do that with at least 20 attempts.[a][60][61] He was named NFC Offensive Player of the Week for this game against the Saints.[62] Against the Buffalo Bills on December 20, Cousins passed for four touchdowns, and ran for another in a Redskins victory, marking his second four-touchdown passing game of the season.[63] The following week against the Eagles, Cousins took an ill-advised quarterback kneel inside the Eagles' redzone with six seconds left before halftime, running out the clock and forgoing any chance of adding upon Washington's lead.[64] Despite that, Cousins eventually passed for four touchdowns in the game, his second consecutive four-touchdown performance and third overall on the season. The performance led to the Redskins' victory over the Eagles with a score of 38–24, which allowed the team to win the NFC East division title for the first time since Griffin III did it in 2012.[65][66] Cousins was named NFC Offensive Player of the Month for December.[67] Cousins finished the 2015 season posting the highest completion percentage (74.7) in home games in NFL history, with a minimum of 100 attempts, leading the Redskins to a 6–2 record at home.[68] He also became the first Redskins quarterback since Sonny Jurgensen in 1970 to have at least four passing touchdowns in three or more games in one season.[69] Against the Dallas Cowboys on January 3, 2016, he set the Redskins single-season passing yardage record with 4,166, passing Jay Schroeder who had 4,109 in 1986.[70] He also finished the season with 29 passing touchdowns, second in Redskins history behind Jurgensen who had 31 in 1967, while posting a league-leading completion percentage of 69.8%, second in team history behind Sammy Baugh who completed 70.3% of his passes in 1945.[70] Against the Green Bay Packers in the Wild Card Round on January 10, 2016, Cousins completed 29-of-46 passes for 329 yards and scored two touchdowns (one passing, one rushing), but was sacked six times and lost one fumble. The Redskins lost 35–18, ending their season.[71] He was named the PFWA Most Improved Player.[72] He was ranked 85th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2016.[73] Cousins was set to become an unrestricted free agent in the 2016 offseason, but the Redskins used the non-exclusive franchise tag on him on March 1, 2016. The tag acted as a one-year, $20 million contract, which prevented other teams in the league from signing him without giving up two first round draft picks to the Redskins.[74][75] During the Week 8 International Series game against the Cincinnati Bengals at Wembley Stadium in London, Cousins threw for a career-high 458 passing yards, as the game ended in a 27–27 tie.[76] As the game ended in a tie, it also marked the first time a game held in London went into overtime. Three weeks later against the Packers, Cousins threw for 375 yards along with three touchdowns in a 42–24 victory, earning him his third NFC Offensive Player of the Week award.[77] After the game, Cousins was caught on camera asking Redskins general manager Scot McCloughan \"How you like me now?\" which many in the media believed Cousins was addressing concerns about his potentially lucrative long-term contract with the team next season.[78] In a Thanksgiving Day 31–26 road loss against the Cowboys, Cousins completed 41 of 53 passes for 449 yards with three touchdowns and no interceptions, putting him second on the list of most passing yards in a Thanksgiving Day game in NFL history.[79] For his accomplishments in the month of November, Cousins won the NFC Offensive Player Of The Month award, his second time winning the award.[80][81] In Week 16, on Christmas Eve, against the Bears, Cousins had a career-high two rushing touchdowns in the 41–21 road victory.[82] Despite missing the playoffs, Cousins led the team to a winning record of 8–7–1 and finished the season with a career-high 4,917 passing yards, which was third in the NFL behind Drew Brees and Matt Ryan, breaking various personal and team records he had set the previous year.[83][84] Cousins' 67% completion percentage ranked No. 7 and his 45.7% deep-ball completion percentage ranked No. 5 among NFL quarterbacks in 2016.[85] Due to his performance in the season, Cousins was named to his first Pro Bowl, replacing Atlanta Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan, who could not take part in the game due to the Falcons' appearance in Super Bowl LI.[86] During the game, Cousins played throughout most of the second half, and notably forced a fumble on Denver Broncos cornerback Aqib Talib after chasing him down the field after throwing an interception late in the fourth quarter.[87] Cousins was also ranked 70th by his peers on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2017.[88] Again set to become an unrestricted free agent in the offseason, Cousins and the Redskins attempted to work out a long-term deal before the start of free agency, but could only come to an agreement on the exclusive franchise tag on February 28, 2017, becoming the first quarterback in NFL history to be franchise-tagged in consecutive years.[89] During a Week 3 27–10 victory over the Oakland Raiders on NBC Sunday Night Football, Cousins went 25-for-30 for a season-high 365 yards and three touchdowns, earning him his fourth NFC Offensive Player of the Week award of his career.[90][91][92] During Week 10 against the Minnesota Vikings, Cousins tied his single-game career-high with two rushing touchdowns in the 38–30 loss.[93] The Redskins finished the 2017 season with a 7–9 record and missed the playoffs.[94] Cousins finished the season 347-of-540 for 4,093 yards, 27 touchdowns, and 13 interceptions.[95] The 2017 season marked his third consecutive season of passing for at least 4,000 yards. In addition to his passing totals, he rushed 49 times for 179 yards and four rushing touchdowns. Cousins was ranked 94th by his peers on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2018.[96] On March 15, 2018, Cousins signed with the Vikings on a fully guaranteed three-year contract worth $84 million.[97] This was the first fully guaranteed and, as of signing, highest paying contract in NFL history.[98] In his Vikings debut in the season opener against the San Francisco 49ers, Cousins passed for 244 yards and two touchdowns in the 24–16 victory.[99] In the next game against the Packers, he finished with 425 passing yards, four touchdowns, and an interception as the game ended in a 29–29 tie.[100] Two weeks later against the Los Angeles Rams on Thursday Night Football, Cousins threw for 422 yards and three touchdowns in the 38–31 road loss.[101] Despite Cousins's strong statistical start to the season, inconsistency within the offense and coaching staff ended up impacting the Vikings' season. With the Vikings at 6–5–1 going into Week 14 against the Seahawks, the Vikings were still in the playoff hunt, but a 21–7 road loss on Monday Night Football resulted in the firing of offensive coordinator John DeFilippo.[102] The Vikings won their next two games, against the Miami Dolphins and Detroit Lions, with Cousins passing for five touchdowns and an interception combined.[103][104] In the regular-season finale against the Bears, the Vikings would have made the playoffs with a win, but they fell 24–10, with Cousins passing for 132 yards and a touchdown.[105] Cousins finished his first season with the Vikings with 4,298 passing yards, 30 touchdowns, and 10 interceptions to go along with 123 rushing yards and a touchdown.[106] He was ranked 78th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2019.[107] During the season-opener against the Falcons, Cousins completed 8 of 10 passes for 98 yards and a touchdown in the 28–12 win.[108] In the next game against the Packers, he completed 14 passes for 230 yards with a touchdown and two interceptions in the 21–16 road loss.[109] The following week against the Raiders, Cousins completed 15 passes for 174 yards, including a 35-yard touchdown pass, in the 34–14 win.[110] In Week 4, against the Bears, he had two fumbles and no passing touchdowns but still passed 27 times for 233 yards in the 16–6 road loss.[citation needed] In the next game, against the Giants, Cousins completed 22 passes for 306 yards and two touchdowns in the 28–10 road victory.[111] The following week against the Eagles, he threw for 333 yards, four touchdowns, and an interception in the 38–20 win.[112] During Week 7 against the Lions, Cousins passed for 337 yards and four touchdowns in the 42–30 road victory.[113] He was named NFC Offensive Player of the Month for October.[114] During Week 11 against the Broncos, Cousins threw for 319 yards and three touchdowns as the Vikings overcame a 20-point first half deficit and won 27–23.[115] Two weeks later against the Seahawks on Monday Night Football, he threw for 276 yards, two touchdowns, and an interception in the 37–30 road loss, extending Cousins' record on Mondays to an 0–8 record.[116] During Week 16 against the Packers once again on Monday Night Football, Cousins threw for 122 yards, a touchdown, and an interception in the 23–10 loss.[117] The Packers clinched the NFC North division title with the win. It also extended Cousins' record on Monday Night Football to 0–9.[118] With the Vikings' playoff position set, Cousins did not play in the regular-season finale against the Bears.[119] He finished the 2019 season with 3,603 passing yards, 26 passing touchdowns, and six interceptions to go along with 63 rushing yards and a touchdown.[120] Cousins was also named to his second career Pro Bowl.[121] In the NFC Wild Card Round against the Saints, Cousins threw for 242 yards and the game winning touchdown to tight end Kyle Rudolph in overtime during the 26–20 road victory.[122] In the Divisional Round against the 49ers, Cousins threw for 172 yards, a touchdown, and an interception in the 27–10 road loss.[123] He was ranked 58th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2020.[124] On March 18, 2020, Cousins signed a two-year, $66 million contract extension with the Vikings.[125] During Week 2 against the Indianapolis Colts, Cousins threw for 113 yards and three interceptions during the 28–11 road loss. He finished the game with a total quarterback rating of 15.9, the third-lowest mark in Vikings franchise history.[126] In Week 3 against the Titans, Cousins had a much better outing, throwing for 251 yards, three touchdowns, and two interceptions during the narrow 31–30 loss.[127] The following week against the Houston Texans, Cousins threw for 260 yards and a touchdown during the 31–23 road victory, the Vikings' first win of the season.[128] Two weeks later against the Falcons, Cousins threw for 343 yards, three touchdowns, and three interceptions during the 40–23 loss.

In response to his comments, which drew from a personal decision, Holland Hospital, with whom Cousins had served as spokesperson, announced they were discontinuing Cousins' role indefinitely.[143] Prior to Week 17, Cousins was placed on the COVID-19 reserve list and ruled out for the game against the Packers,[144] which they lost 37–10, eliminating them from playoff contention.[145] Cousins finished the season with 4,221 passing yards, 33 touchdowns, and seven interceptions to go along with 115 rushing yards and a touchdown.[146] He was nominated to his third Pro Bowl of his career.[147] He was ranked 99th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2022.[148] On March 13, 2022, Cousins signed a one-year, $35 million fully guaranteed contract extension through the 2023 season.[149] In the season opener against the Packers, Cousins threw 23-of-32 passes for 277 yards with two touchdowns, and a 118.9 passer rating in 23–7 victory.[150] In the following week against the Eagles on Monday Night Football, Cousins passed 27 completions of 46 attempts for 221 yards with one touchdown and three interceptions in a 7–24 blowout loss.[151] In Week 5 against the Bears, Cousins completed a one–yard touchdown pass to Jalen Reagor for his 19th consecutive completion (17 to open to game, and 2 from Week 4 against the Saints.

Playing at home, Cousins had a solid individual game, completing 31-of-39 passes for 273 yards, two touchdowns and no interceptions, alongside a rushing touchdown. His two passing touchdowns were to K. J.

The Falcons did not notify Cousins or his agent of the decision until they were on the clock with their pick.[189][190] Cousins made his Falcons debut on September 8 against the Pittsburgh Steelers, completing 16-of-26 passes for 155 yards with one touchdown and two interceptions, including a costly interception late in the fourth quarter as the Falcons were shutout in the second half, losing 18–10.[191] The following week against the Eagles on Monday Night Football, Cousins went 20-of-29 for 241 yards and two touchdowns.

                "content": "Derrick Lamar Henry Jr.[1][2] (born January 4, 1994)[1] is an American professional football running back for the Baltimore Ravens of the National Football League (NFL). Nicknamed \"King Henry\",[3][4] he is known for his imposing style of play and larger build than the average running back. Born and raised in Yulee, Florida, Henry set the national high school football record for career rushing yards with the Yulee Hornets. He played college football for the Alabama Crimson Tide, where during his junior season, he broke Herschel Walker's single-season college rushing yards record in the Southeastern Conference (SEC), won the 2015 Heisman Trophy, the Doak Walker Award, the Maxwell Award, and the Walter Camp Award, and was a key part of the 2015 Alabama Crimson Tide football team that won the 2016 College Football Playoff National Championship. Henry was selected by the Tennessee Titans in the second round of the 2016 NFL draft, where he was a four-time Pro Bowl selection. A backup for most of his first two seasons in the league, Henry emerged as the Titans' feature back near the end of the 2018 season. He led the NFL in rushing yards for the 2019 season, as well as rushing touchdowns (tied with Green Bay Packers running back Aaron Jones). In 2020, Henry again led the league in rushing yards and touchdowns and became the eighth player in NFL history to rush for over 2,000 yards in a single season, and the second Tennessee Titan to do so, after Chris Johnson achieved it in 2009. Henry won the 2020 Associated Press NFL Offensive Player of the Year Award. After missing more than half of the 2021 season to injury, he made his third and fourth Pro Bowl appearances in the subsequent two seasons. After eight seasons with Tennessee, Henry signed with the Ravens in 2024. Derrick Lamar Henry Jr. was born in Yulee, Florida, to Stacy Veal and Derrick Henry Sr., aged 15 and 16 respectively.[5] Henry's father was absent for much of his childhood, having been arrested 20 times for various crimes including drug and prostitution-related offenses, and was consequently in and out of prison and had trouble maintaining employment. His mother became a hemodialysis technician. Henry was raised primarily by his grandmother, Gladys, who nicknamed him \"Shocka\", as his birth shocked the whole family, given his parents' young ages. He developed a close relationship to his grandmother, whom he cites as very influential in his upbringing.[6][7] Henry attended Yulee High School, where he was a three-sport star in football, basketball, and track. He played as a running back for the Yulee Hornets football team.[8] He ran for 2,465 yards and 26 touchdowns as a freshman in 2009. He was named a first-team All-Coast selection at running back in 2010 after rushing for 2,788 yards and 38 touchdowns while averaging 8.9 yards per attempt. He rushed for 2,610 yards and 34 scores as a junior in 2011 to earn first-team All-Coast honors from the Florida Times-Union. He set the Florida high school record with a 510-yard performance against Jacksonville Jackson (a record he held until 2021[9]) and averaged 9.2 yards per carry and 327.8 yards per game as a senior, finishing the season with a state-record 4,261 yards and 55 touchdowns.[10] He finished his high school football career with 12,124 career rushing yards, which broke Ken Hall's career record.[11][12] During this time, Henry began receiving the nickname \"King Henry\" by stadium crowds and local television news reports as he began aiming to break the national high school rushing title.[13] He also rushed for 153 career touchdowns. His career touchdown totals rank fifth all-time. In four years at Yulee he averaged more than 250 yards a game and never rushed for fewer than 100 yards in a game.[14] He played for the East squad in the 2013 U.S. Army All-American Bowl, where he rushed for 53 yards with a touchdown and a two-point conversion.[15][16] As a track & field athlete, Henry competed as a sprinter at Yulee from 2010 to 2011. He posted a personal-best time of 11.11 seconds in the 100-meter dash at the 2011 FHSAA 2A District 3 Championships, where he placed seventh.[17] He was also a member of the 4×100 and 4×400 squads.[18] Considered a five-star recruit by ESPN.com, Henry was listed as the No. 1 athlete (player with no designated position) in the nation in 2013.[19] After originally committing to the University of Georgia, Henry committed to the University of Alabama on September 28, 2012.[20] He held offers from many of the top college football programs in the country, including USC, Notre Dame, Tennessee, Florida, and Clemson.[21] His number was eventually retired by Yulee.[22] Henry attended and played college football for the University of Alabama from 2013 to 2015 under head coach Nick Saban.[23][24] He majored in communication. He graduated on May 4, 2018.[25] That same day, he published an article in The Players' Tribune thanking his late grandmother for the inspiration to continue pursuing his degree.[25][26] As a true freshman in 2013, Henry rushed for 382 yards on 36 carries with three touchdowns in a backfield largely dominated by T. J. Yeldon and Kenyan Drake.[27][28] On October 19, against Arkansas, he had 111 rushing yards and his first collegiate rushing touchdown in the 52–0 victory.[29] During the 2014 Sugar Bowl, he rushed for 100 yards and a touchdown on eight carries and had a 61-yard touchdown reception in the 45–31 loss to the Oklahoma Sooners.[30][31] In that game, Spanish-language broadcaster Pablo Viruega on ESPN Deportes nicknamed him \"El Tractorcito\" (The Little Tractor) due to his long stride and powerful gait. The nickname became a popular internet meme.[32] In the 2014 season, Henry and Yeldon split a majority of the work in the backfield.[33] In the season opener against West Virginia, he had 113 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown in the 33–23 victory in the Chick-fil-A Kickoff Game.[34] On September 20, against Florida, he had 111 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown in the 42–21 victory.[35] On October 18 against Texas A&M, he had 70 rushing yards, one rushing touchdown, and a 41-yard receiving touchdown in the 59–0 victory.[36] On November 22, against Western Carolina, he had 92 rushing yards, two rushing touchdowns, and a nine-yard receiving touchdown in the 48–14 victory.[37] In the annual rivalry game against Auburn, he had 72 rushing yards and a touchdown in the high-scoring 55–44 installment of the rivalry.[38] In the SEC Championship against Missouri, he had 141 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns in the 42–13 victory.[39] Alabama qualified for the College Football Playoff and faced off against Ohio State in the National Semifinals in the Sugar Bowl.[40] Henry had 95 rushing yards, one rushing touchdown, and two receptions for 54 yards as Alabama fell 42–35 to the Buckeyes.[41] In his sophomore year, Henry rushed for 990 yards on 172 carries with 11 touchdowns.[42] After Yeldon left for the NFL, Henry took over as the starting running back as a junior in 2015. In the season opener against Wisconsin, he had 147 rushing yards and three rushing touchdowns in the 35–17 victory.[43] In the next game, against Middle Tennessee State, he had 96 rushing yards and another game with three rushing touchdowns in the 37–10 victory.[44] In the next game against Ole Miss, he had 127 rushing yards, one rushing touchdown, and five receptions for 39 yards in Alabama's only loss of the season, a 43–37 decision.[45] After rushing for 52 yards against Louisiana–Monroe, he had 148 rushing yards and a touchdown in a 38–10 victory over previously undefeated Georgia.[46][47] On October 10, he rushed for 95 yards and a touchdown against Arkansas in a 27–14 victory.[48] After the victory over the Razorbacks, he went on an impressive stretch of performances. On October 17, against Texas A&M, he had 236 rushing yards, two rushing touchdowns, and an 18-yard reception in a 41–23 victory.[49] In the next game, a narrow 19–14 victory over Tennessee, he had 143 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns.[50] In the following game, a much-anticipated matchup with fellow Heisman contender Leonard Fournette of LSU, he had 210 rushing yards and three rushing touchdowns in the 30–16 victory over the previously undefeated team.[51][52] In the next game, against Mississippi State, he had 204 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns in the 31–6 victory.[53] In the next game, against Charleston Southern, he had 68 rushing yards and two more rushing touchdowns in a limited role in the 56–6 victory.[54] In the Iron Bowl against Auburn, he had 271 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown on 46 carries in the 29–13 victory.[55] In the SEC Championship against Florida, he had 44 carries for 189 yards and a touchdown in the 29–15 victory.[56] Alabama qualified for the College Football Playoff and faced off against Michigan State in the National Semifinals.[57] In the 38–0 victory over the Spartans in the Cotton Bowl, he had 75 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns.[58] During Alabama's 45–40 victory over Clemson in the 2016 College Football Playoff National Championship, he rushed for 158 yards on 36 carries with three touchdowns.[59] During the game, he also broke Shaun Alexander's record for most career rushing yards in Alabama history.[60] Playing in all 15 games, he rushed for SEC records 2,219 yards and 28 touchdowns on 395 carries. In addition, he scored at least one touchdown in each game.[61][62][63] He led the NCAA in rushing attempts, rushing yards, rushing touchdowns, and points scored.[64] Henry won the Heisman Trophy, beating out finalists Christian McCaffrey and Deshaun Watson.[65] He won numerous other awards including the Doak Walker Award, Walter Camp Award, and Maxwell Award.[66] Henry declared for the 2016 NFL Draft after his junior season.[25] Coming out of Alabama, Henry was projected by the majority of analysts to be either drafted in the late first or second round. Scouts regarded his main assets to be his large frame, violent running, ability to break tackles with ease, speed, long strides, superior conditioning, and consistent play. The main concerns were about the wear and tear his body took as a workhorse at Alabama, his slow acceleration, average foot quickness, below-average catching ability, narrow based running style, sluggish cutbacks, and running tall.[67] Henry was drafted by the Tennessee Titans in the second round (45th overall) of the 2016 NFL draft.[70] He was the second running back taken that year, after #4 Ezekiel Elliott.[71] He was reunited with his former fullback at Alabama Jalston Fowler.[72] On May 9, 2016, the Titans signed Henry to a four-year, $5.40 million contract with $3.30 million guaranteed and a signing bonus of $2.13 million.[73] Henry began his rookie season as the backup running back to veteran DeMarco Murray. He wore the No. 2 jersey throughout training camp and preseason and donned the No. 22 once running back Dexter McCluster was cut on September 2, 2016.[74] Henry made his NFL debut and earned his first NFL start in the Titans' season-opening loss to the Minnesota Vikings. He finished the game with five carries for three yards and two receptions for 41 yards.[75] During Week 8, Henry scored his first NFL touchdown on a 6-yard rush in a 36–22 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars. He finished the game with 16 carries for a then career-high 60 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown and four catches for 37 yards.[76] On December 18, 2016, he had nine rushing attempts for 58 rushing yards and a season-high two rushing touchdowns in a 19–17 road victory over the Kansas City Chiefs.[77] During the season finale against the Houston Texans, he ran for a then-career-high 65 rushing yards on 15 carries and scored a touchdown in the 24–17 victory.[78] Henry finished his rookie season with 110 carries for 490 yards (both sixth among NFL rookies in 2016) and five touchdowns in 15 games and two starts.[79] He also caught 13 passes for 137 yards.[80] For most of the 2017 season, Henry split carries with DeMarco Murray and run-oriented quarterback Marcus Mariota. During Week 2, Henry ran for 92 yards and a touchdown on 14 carries in a 37–16 road victory against the Jaguars.[81] On October 16, 2017, on Monday Night Football, Henry ran for a then career-best 131 yards on 19 carries, including a 72-yard touchdown late in the fourth quarter of the 36–22 victory over the Indianapolis Colts. In addition, he had a 14-yard reception in the victory.[82] During Week 13, Henry ran for 109 yards on 11 carries and beat his longest rush of the year with a 75-yard rushing touchdown late in the fourth quarter of the 24–13 victory over the Texans.[83] In the regular season finale against the Jaguars, Henry caught his first receiving touchdown on a 66-yard reception from Marcus Mariota in the 15–10 victory.[84] The Titans finished second in the AFC South with a 9–7 record and made the playoffs as a Wild Card team.[85][86] In the Wild Card Round, the Titans played the Chiefs. Because DeMarco Murray was out with a knee injury, Henry got the start.[87] In a 22–21 road victory, Henry had the best performance of his career up to that point, rushing for 156 yards and a touchdown on 23 carries and catching two passes for 35 yards.[88] His 191 yards-from-scrimmage was a franchise record. In the Divisional Round against the New England Patriots, Henry had 28 rushing yards and 21 receiving yards in the 35–14 road loss.[89] Henry finished the regular season with 176 carries for 744 rushing yards and five touchdowns in 15 games and two starts. He also caught 11 passes for 136 yards and a touchdown. In the postseason, Henry ran for 184 yards and a touchdown on 35 carries and caught five passes for 56 yards.[90] During the 2018 offseason, Matt LaFleur was hired as the Titans' new offensive coordinator and the team also acquired running back Dion Lewis.[91] Lewis's pass-catching ability was seen as a fit for LaFleur's offensive scheme, which often employed running backs to catch passes out of the backfield, and leading to success with Todd Gurley in the previous season as offensive coordinator with the Rams.[92] This led to speculation that LaFleur would favor Lewis over Henry.[93] Henry ended up splitting carries with Lewis and run-oriented quarterback Marcus Mariota for most of the 2018 season. During Week 2, Henry recorded an eight-yard pass completion, the first of his career, to wide receiver Taywan Taylor in the Titans' 20–17 victory over the Texans.[94] He also had 18 carries in that game and the next against the Jaguars, but was used much less frequently through the middle of the season. From Weeks 4–13, Henry averaged nine carries for only 37 yards per game, and never rushed for over 60 yards.[80] This all changed in Week 14 against the Jaguars. In the second quarter, Henry had a 99-yard touchdown run, fending off three tacklers, tying him with Tony Dorsett for the longest NFL touchdown run. He finished the game with four rushing touchdowns and 238 rushing yards on 17 carries, breaking Chris Johnson's franchise record of 228 yards in 2009.[95][96][97] He also became the ninth player in NFL history to record a 200+ yard and 4+ touchdown game, and the first to do so on fewer than 22 carries.[98] His 238 rushing yards were the most by any player for a single game for the 2018 season.[99] Henry was named the AFC Offensive Player of the Week due to his spectacular performance.[100] During Week 15, the Titans went on the road to face the New York Giants. In a cold and rainy game, Henry led the NFL in rushing for the second consecutive week with 170 yards and two touchdowns on a career-high 33 carries, along with a one-yard reception and six-yard pass completion in the 17–0 shutout.[101] In Weeks 16 and 17, he combined for 177 rushing yards and a touchdown in the two games against the Washington Redskins and Colts.[102][103] He was later named the AFC Offensive Player of the Month for December.[104] Henry finished the 2018 season with 1,059 rushing yards and 12 touchdowns along with 15 receptions for 99 yards.[105] After the season, he was ranked 99th on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2019.[106] In the 2019 season opener against the Cleveland Browns, Henry rushed 19 times for 84 yards and a touchdown. He also caught one pass for a 75-yard touchdown as the Titans won on the road 43–13.[107] During Week 2 against the Colts, he rushed 15 times for 81 yards and a touchdown as the Titans narrowly lost 19–17.[108] Two weeks later against the Atlanta Falcons, Henry had his first 100-yard game of the season when he rushed for 100 yards on 27 carries in a 24–10 road victory.[109] In the next game against the Buffalo Bills, he rushed for 78 yards and a touchdown as the Titans lost by a score of 14–7.[110] After a season-low 28 yards in a Week 6 shutout loss to the Denver Broncos, Henry sank to 12th in the league in rushing, over 200 yards behind the league leaders he would eventually catch.[111] Henry responded with 90 rushing yards and a touchdown in a 23–20 victory against the Los Angeles Chargers in Week 7.[112] During Week 9 against the Carolina Panthers, Henry rushed 13 times for 63 yards and a touchdown and caught three passes for 36 yards and a touchdown in the 30–20 road loss.[113] In the next game against the Chiefs, he finished with 188 rushing yards and two touchdowns as the Titans narrowly won 35–32.[114] Henry won the FedEx Ground Player of the Week for his efforts.[115] During a Jaguars rematch in Week 12 after a Week 11 bye, Henry had a 74-yard rushing touchdown in the third quarter. Overall, he finished the 42–20 victory with 159 rushing yards and two touchdowns along with one reception for 16 yards.[116] In the next game, a rematch against the Colts, he rushed 26 times for 149 yards and a touchdown in the 31–17 road victory.[117] During Week 14 against the Oakland Raiders, Henry ran for 103 yards and two touchdowns in the 42–21 road victory.[118] During the regular-season finale against the Texans, Henry finished with 211 rushing yards and three touchdowns as the Titans won 35–14 and made it to the playoffs as a Wild Card team. During the game, Henry narrowly won the 2019 rushing title over Nick Chubb of the Cleveland Browns, with the winning rush being a 53-yard touchdown run.[119] This was Henry's first career rushing crown and the first Titan to win it since Chris Johnson in 2009.[120] Henry finished the regular season setting career-highs in carries with 303, rushing yards with 1,540, and rushing touchdowns with 16, which all led the league, despite only playing in 15 games, missing the Week 16 game against the New Orleans Saints due to a hamstring injury.[121] He also set career-highs in receptions with 16, receiving yards with 206, and receiving touchdowns with two.[122] On December 17, 2019, he was selected to his first Pro Bowl.[123] On January 3, 2020, he was named to the second-team All-Pro at both the running back and flex position, both behind Christian McCaffrey.[124] He was ranked 10th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2020.[125] With the Titans finishing the season 9–7, the team narrowly clinched a wild card spot for the #6 seed. In the Wild Card Round against the defending Super Bowl champion Patriots, which was played on his 26th birthday, Henry rushed for over 100 yards and a touchdown in the first half, finishing with 182 yards (the most ever against a Bill Belichick-led team, and the third most ever in a postseason road game) and a 22-yard reception in the 20–13 road victory. Henry became the first rushing champion with a 100-yard playoff game since Terrell Davis in 1998, the first to win a playoff game since LaDainian Tomlinson in 2007, and the second Titan with multiple post-season 100+ rushing games.[126] He also broke his own franchise record for most yards-from-scrimmage with 204.[127] During the Divisional Round against the Baltimore Ravens, Henry rushed 30 times for 195 yards and threw a three-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Corey Davis in the 28–12 road victory.[128] He became the second player in NFL history with three postseason games with at least 150 rushing yards, joining Terrell Davis, who had four. In addition, he became the only player with at least 175 rushing yards in consecutive games. Davis is the only other with two such games in a career.[129] In the AFC Championship against the Chiefs, Henry was mostly held in check. During the game, he rushed 19 times for 69 yards and a touchdown in the 35–24 road loss.[130] On March 16, 2020, the Titans placed the franchise tag on Henry.[131] He signed the tag on April 2, 2020.[132] Henry signed a new four-year $50 million contract with the team on July 15, 2020.[133] Despite leading the league in rushing yards for most of the first four weeks of the 2020 season, Henry was limited to no more than 3.7 yards per carry for all but one of them. These struggles ended in the week 6 game against the Texans, Henry finished with 212 rushing yards, 52 receiving yards, and two touchdowns (including a 94-yard rushing touchdown). In overtime, he finished the game with a five-yard touchdown to end the game as the Titans won 42–36.[134] Henry was named the AFC Offensive Player of the Week for his performance in Week 6.[135] He was also named AFC Offensive Player of the Month for October after racking up 399 scrimmage yards with 344 yards rushing and five touchdowns.[136] During a Week 8 31–20 road loss to the Cincinnati Bengals, he ran for 112 yards and a touchdown.[137] In Week 11 against the Ravens, Henry had 133 rushing yards and the game-winning touchdown in overtime to defeat the Ravens on the road 30–24.[138][139] In a 45–26 road victory against the Colts in Week 12, Henry had 27 carries for 178 rushing yards and three touchdowns.[140] In Week 14 against the Jaguars, Henry rushed 26 times for 215 yards and two touchdowns during the 31–10 victory.[141] In Week 15 against the Detroit Lions, Henry rushed for 147 yards and a touchdown during the 46–25 win.[142] In Week 17 against the Houston Texans, Henry rushed for a career-high 250 rushing yards and two touchdowns during the 41–38 road victory.[143] Henry was named the AFC Offensive Player of the Week for his performance.[144] During the game, Henry became the eighth running back in NFL history to surpass 2,000 rushing yards.[145] This also made him the only player to have 2,000 yard rushing seasons in high school, college, and the NFL.[146] In addition to his 2,027 rushing yards, Henry established career highs in carries (378), yards-per-carry (5.4) and rushing touchdowns (17). He was named the 2020 Offensive Player of the Year at the 10th Annual NFL Honors.[147] He was ranked fourth by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2021.[148] In the Wild Card Round of the playoffs against the Ravens, Henry was held without a single first down. He was limited to 40 yards on 18 carries (2.2 yards-per-carry) and three receptions for 11 yards during the 20–13 loss.[149] Henry began the season slow, held to only 58 rushing yards as the Titans lost to the Arizona Cardinals 38–13.[150] During Week 2 against the Seattle Seahawks, Henry finished with 182 rushing yards, 55 receiving yards, and three rushing touchdowns as the Titans won 33–30 in overtime. He earned AFC Offensive Player of the Week for Week 2.[151] In Week 6, Henry ran for 143 yards and three touchdowns in a 34–31 win over the Bills, earning his second AFC Offensive Player of the Week honor of the year.[152] During a Week 8 win against the Colts, Henry suffered a Jones fracture that would end up sidelining him for the remainder of the regular season.[153] He was placed on injured reserve on November 1. Prior to his injury, Henry was leading the league in carries, rushing yards and rushing touchdowns, and was on pace to break the NFL rushing record.[154] Henry was named the Titans' nominee for the 2021 Walter Payton Man of the Year Award.[155] Henry was activated off injured reserve on January 21, 2022, for the team's Divisional Round game against the Bengals.[156] In his return, Henry had 20 carries for 62 yards along with a rushing touchdown in the Titans' 19–16 loss.[157] He was ranked 12th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2022.[158] Prior to the 2022 season on September 1, 2022, Henry was given a raise by the Titans, receiving a $2 million bump for the year.[159] In Week 3, against the Las Vegas Raiders, Henry had 143 scrimmage yards and a rushing touchdown in the 24–22 victory.[160] In the following game, against the Colts, Henry had 22 carries for 114 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown in the 24–17 victory.[161] One week later, he had 28 carries for 102 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns in a 21–17 victory over the Washington Commanders.[162] In Week 7, Henry had 30 carries for 128 rushing yards in a 19–10 victory over the Colts.[163] In Week 8, Henry had 32 carries for 219 yards and two touchdowns in a 17–10 win over the Texans, earning AFC Offensive Player of the Week.[164] He was named AFC Offensive Player of the Month for October.[165] In Week 9, against the Chiefs, Henry had 17 carries for 115 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns in the 20–17 overtime loss.[166] In Week 11, against the Green Bay Packers, Henry had 132 scrimmage yards and one rushing touchdown. In addition, he threw a three-yard touchdown pass to Austin Hooper in the 27–17 victory.[167] In Week 14, against the Jaguars, he had 155 scrimmage yards in the 36–22 loss.[168] In the following week against the Chargers, Henry had 163 scrimmage yards and a rushing touchdown in the 17–14 loss.[169] In Week 16, Henry had 23 carries for 126 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown in the 19–14 loss to the Houston Texans.[170] With Week 17 having no bearing on the Titans' playoff hopes, Henry was rested for the Dallas Cowboys game.[171] In the Week 18 winner-take-all game for the AFC South, Henry had 30 carries for 109 rushing yards in the 20–16 elimination loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars.[172][173] In the 2022 season, Henry finished with 349 carries for 1,538 rushing yards and 13 rushing touchdowns to go along with 33 receptions for 398 receiving yards.[174] He led the league in rushing attempts and finished second in rushing yards and rushing touchdowns.[175] He was named to the Pro Bowl.[176] Henry was ranked 25th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2023.[177] In Week 1, a loss to the Saints, Henry had 119 scrimmage yards.[178] In a Week 4 victory over the Bengals, he had 22 carries for 122 rushing yards and a touchdown.[179] In Weeks 12–14, Henry had two rushing touchdowns in three consecutive games.[180][181][182] In Week 15 against the Texans, Henry had a poor performance, becoming the first player in NFL history to have at least 20 touches and generate less than 15 yards from scrimmage.[183] In Week 16, he had a rushing and passing touchdown.[184] In the 2023 season, Henry finished with 280 carries for 1,167 rushing yards, the most in the AFC, and 12 rushing touchdowns. He also had 28 receptions for 214 receiving yards.[185] On March 12, 2024, Henry signed with the Baltimore Ravens on a two-year, $16 million deal worth up to $20 million which also included $9 million fully guaranteed in the first year.[186] In Week 3, Henry had 151 rushing yards on 25 attempts and two touchdowns in a 28–25 win against the Cowboys.[187] In Week 4 against the Bills, Henry had 199 rushing yards and a touchdown on 24 carries with an 87-yard rushing score on the Ravens’ first offensive play, which was the longest run in franchise history. He also had 10 receiving yards and a touchdown on three receptions. The Ravens won 35–10.[188] For his performance in Week 4, Henry was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week.[189] In Week 5 against the Bengals, Henry scored his 100th overall career touchdown, while also reaching the mark of 10,000 career rushing yards later in the game, becoming the fifth player in NFL history to achieve the feat. The Ravens won in overtime, 41–38.[190] In Week 6, Henry rushed for 132 yards and two touchdowns in a 30-23 win over the Washington Commanders, earning AFC Offensive Player of the Week.[191] Standing at 6 feet 2 inches (1.88 m) tall and weighing 247 pounds (112 kg), Henry is much larger than most running backs and has a frame comparable to that of a linebacker.[192] Henry is a \"power back\", using his large size and strength to overpower defenders, stiff arm and break tackles. In 2020, he accumulated 1,073 yards after contact, over 300 yards more than any running back in the league, and led the league in broken tackles with 34.[193] He couples that strength and size with surprising speed relative to his size.[194] Henry is adept at using the stiff-arm to repel defenders, with it being described as his \"signature\".[195][196] As a power back, his playing style contrasts with those of smaller, so-called \"scat backs\", who have greater elusiveness due to their faster ability to change directions. Henry is not usually used as a pass catcher, but he makes up for his lack of productiveness as a pass-catcher using his dominance as a pure runner.[193] Observers have also noted that Henry has a tendency to get better, particularly in yards per carry, in the later stages of a game, as his strength and toughness wears down opponents.[197] Henry's successful running game has also permitted the offense success with play-action.[198] In 2018, Henry fulfilled a promise to his grandmother by graduating from Alabama with a bachelor's degree in communications.[209] In November 2019, Henry's hometown of Yulee, Florida, celebrated him with a welcome sign in his honor. Fundraising for the sign came from local residents and businesses.[210] Henry has been in a relationship with Adrianna Rivas since 2016. They have two daughters.[211][212] Italics denotes active player",

                "title": "FC Barcelona - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Futbol Club Barcelona (Catalan pronunciation: [fubˈbɔl ˈklub bəɾsəˈlonə] ⓘ), commonly known as FC Barcelona and colloquially as Barça ([ˈbaɾsə]), is a professional football club based in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain, that competes in La Liga, the top flight of Spanish football. Founded in 1899 by a group of Swiss, Catalan, German, and English footballers led by Joan Gamper, the club has become a symbol of Catalan culture and Catalanism, hence the motto \"Més que un club\" (\"More than a club\").[2] Unlike many other football clubs, the supporters own and operate Barcelona. It is the third-most valuable football club in the world, worth $5.6 billion, and the world's fourth richest football club in terms of revenue, with an annual turnover of €800.1 million.[3][4] The official Barcelona anthem is the \"Cant del Barça\", written by Jaume Picas and Josep Maria Espinàs.[5] Barcelona traditionally play in dark shades of blue and garnet stripes, hence nicknamed Blaugrana. Barcelona are one of the the world's most decorated clubs. Domestically, Barcelona has won a record 77 trophies: 27 La Liga, 31 Copa del Rey, 14 Supercopa de España, three Copa Eva Duarte, and two Copa de la Liga titles, as well as being the record holder for the latter four competitions. In international club football, the club has won 22 European and worldwide titles: five UEFA Champions League titles, a record four UEFA Cup Winners' Cups, five UEFA Super Cups, a record three Inter-Cities Fairs Cups, a joint record two Latin Cups, and three FIFA Club World Cups.[6][7][8] Barcelona was ranked first in the International Federation of Football History & Statistics Club World Ranking for 1997, 2009, 2011, 2012, and 2015, and occupies the ninth position on the UEFA club rankings as of May 2023[update].[9][10][11] The club has a long-standing rivalry with Real Madrid, and matches between the two teams are referred to as El Clásico. Barcelona is one of the most widely supported teams in the world, and the club has one of the largest social media following in the world among sports teams.[12][13] Barcelona players have won a joint record twelve Ballon d'Or awards, with recipients including Johan Cruyff, as well as a record six FIFA World Player of the Year awards, with winners including Romário, Ronaldo, Rivaldo, Ronaldinho and Lionel Messi. In 2010, three players who came through the club's youth academy—Lionel Messi, Andrés Iniesta and Xavi—were chosen as the three best players in the world in the Ballon d'Or ranking, an unprecedented feat for players from the same football academy.[14][15] Additionally, players representing the club have won a record eight European Golden Shoe awards.[16] Barcelona is one of three founding members of the Primera División that have never been relegated from the top division since its inception in 1929, along with Athletic Bilbao and Real Madrid.[17][18] In 2009, Barcelona became the first Spanish club to win the continental treble consisting of La Liga, Copa del Rey and the UEFA Champions League, and also became the first European football club to win six out of six competitions in a single year, by also winning the Spanish Super Cup, UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup.[19] In 2011, the club became European champions again, winning five trophies.[20] This Barcelona team, which won fourteen trophies in just four years under Pep Guardiola, is considered by some in the sport to be the greatest team of all time.[21][22][23] By winning their fifth Champions League trophy in 2015 under Luis Enrique, Barcelona became the first European football club in history to achieve the continental treble twice.[24] On 22 October 1899, Swiss Hans Gamper placed an advertisement in Los Deportes declaring his wish to form a football club; a positive response resulted in a meeting at the Gimnasio Solé on 29 November. Eleven players attended – Walter Wild (the first president of the club), Luis de Ossó, Bartomeu Terradas, Otto Kunzle, Otto Maier, Enric Ducal, Pere Cabot, Carles Pujol, Josep Llobet, John Parsons, and William Parsons – and Foot-Ball Club Barcelona was born.[26][27] FC Barcelona had a successful start in regional and national cups, competing in the Campionat de Catalunya and the Copa del Rey. In 1901, the club participated in the first football competition played on the Iberian Peninsula, the Copa Macaya, narrowly losing to Hispania AC, but in the following year, Barça won the tournament, the club's first-ever piece of silverware,[28] and then participated in the first Copa del Rey, losing 1–2 to Bizcaya (a combination of players from Athletic Club and Bilbao FC) in the final.[29] In 1908, Hans Gamper – now known as Joan Gamper – became club president in a desperate attempt to save Barcelona from extinction, finding the club struggling not just on the pitch, but also financially and socially, after not winning a competition since the Campionat de Catalunya in 1905. He said in a meeting, \"Barcelona cannot die and must not die. If there is nobody who is going to try, then I will assume the responsibility of running the club from now on.\"[30] Club president on five separate occasions between 1908 and 1925, he spent 25 years in total at the helm. One of his main achievements was ensuring Barça acquire its own stadium and thus generate a stable income.[31] On 14 March 1909, the team moved into the Camp de la Indústria, a stadium with a capacity of 8,000. To celebrate their new surroundings, the club conducted a logo contest the following year. Carles Comamala won the contest, and his suggestion became the crest that the club still wears – with some minor changes – as of the present day.[32] The stadium is regarded as the main element that helped the club grow in the 1910s and become a dominant team,[33] winning three successive Campionats de Catalunya between 1909 and 1911, three Copa del del Rey in four years between 1910 and 1913, and four successive Pyrenees Cup between the inaugural year in 1910 and 1913, which was one of the earliest international club cups in Europe since it consisted of the best teams of Languedoc, Midi and Aquitaine (Southern France), the Basque Country and Catalonia; all were former members of the Marca Hispanica region. The contest was the most prestigious in that era.[34] Notable figures of Barça's first great team include Carles Comamala, Alfredo Massana, Amechazurra, Paco Bru, and Jack Greenwell.[35] The latter became the club's first full-time coach in 1917.[36] During the same period, the club changed its official language from Castilian to Catalan and gradually evolved into an important symbol of Catalan identity. For many fans, participating in the club had less to do with the game itself and more with being a part of the club's collective identity.[37] On 4 February 1917, the club held its first tribute match to honour Ramón Torralba, who played from 1913 to 1928. The match was against local side Terrassa where Barcelona won the match 6–2.[38] Gamper simultaneously launched a campaign to recruit more club members, and by 1922, the club had more than 20,000, who helped finance a new stadium. The club then moved to the new Les Cortes, which they inaugurated the same year.[39] Les Cortes had an initial capacity of 30,000, and in the 1940s it was expanded to 60,000.[40] In 1912, Gamper recruited Paulino Alcántara, the club's seventh all-time top-scorer, and in 1917, Gamper also recruited Jack Greenwell as the first full-time manager in Barcelona's history. After this hiring, the club's fortunes began to improve on the field and soon enjoyed its first \"golden age\". Along with Alcántara, the Barça team under Greenwell also included Sagibarba, Ricardo Zamora, Josep Samitier, Félix Sesúmaga, and Franz Platko.[41] This team won 9 out of 10 Campionats de Catalunya between 1919 and 1928 and two Copa del Rey titles in 1920 and 1922. In total, during the Gamper-led era, Barcelona won eleven Campionats de Catalunya, six Copa del Rey and four Pyrenees Cups.[42][31] On 14 June 1925, in a spontaneous reaction against Primo de Rivera's dictatorship, the crowd in the stadium jeered the Royal March. As a reprisal, the ground was closed for six months and Gamper was forced to relinquish the presidency of the club.[43] This coincided with the transition to professional football, and, in 1926, the directors of Barcelona publicly claimed, for the first time, to operate a professional football club.[39] On 3 July 1927, the club held a second testimonial match for Paulino Alcántara, against the Spanish national team. To kick off the match, local journalist and pilot Josep Canudas dropped the ball onto the pitch from his aeroplane.[44] In 1928, victory in the Spanish Cup was celebrated with a poem titled \"Oda a Platko\", which was written by a member of the Generation of '27, Rafael Alberti, inspired by the heroic performance of the Barcelona goalkeeper, Franz Platko.[45] On 23 June 1929, Barcelona won the inaugural Spanish League. A year after winning the championship, on 30 July 1930, Gamper committed suicide after a period of depression brought on by personal and financial problems.[31] Although they continued to have players of the standing of Josep Escolà, the club now entered a period of decline, in which political conflict overshadowed sports throughout society. Attendance at matches dropped as the citizens of Barcelona were occupied with discussing political matters.[46] Although the team won the Campionat de Catalunya in 1930, 1931, 1932, 1934, 1936, and 1938,[42] success at a national level (with the exception of the 1937 disputed title) evaded them. A month after the entire Spanish Civil War began in 1936, several players from Barcelona enlisted in the ranks of those who fought against the military uprising, along with players from Athletic Bilbao.[47] On 6 August, Falangist soldiers near Guadarrama murdered club president Josep Sunyol, a representative of the pro-independence political party.[48] He was dubbed the martyr of barcelonisme, and his murder was a defining moment in the history of FC Barcelona and Catalan identity.[49] In the summer of 1937, the squad was on tour in Mexico and the United States, where it was received as an ambassador of the Second Spanish Republic. The tour led to the financial security of the club but also resulted in half of the team seeking asylum in Mexico and France, making it harder for the remaining team to contest for trophies.[50][51] On 16 March 1938, Barcelona came under aerial bombardment from the Italian Air Force, causing more than 3,000 deaths, with one of the bombs hitting the club's offices.[52][53] A few months later, Catalonia came under occupation and as a symbol of the \"undisciplined\" Catalanism, the club, now down to just 3,486 members, faced a number of restrictions. All signs of regional nationalism, including language, flag and other signs of separatism were banned throughout Spain. The Catalan flag was banned and the club were prohibited from using non-Spanish names. These measures forced the club to change its name to Club de Fútbol Barcelona and to remove the Catalan flag from its crest.[54] In 1943, Barcelona faced rivals Real Madrid in the semi-finals of Copa del Generalísimo (now the Copa del Rey). The first match at Les Corts was won by Barcelona 3–0. Real Madrid comfortably won the second leg, beating Barcelona 11–1.[55] According to football writer Sid Lowe, \"There have been relatively few mentions of the game [since] and it is not a result that has been particularly celebrated in Madrid. Indeed, the 11–1 occupies a far more prominent place in Barcelona's history. This was the game that first formed the identification of Madrid as the team of the dictatorship and Barcelona as its victims.\"[56] It has been alleged by local journalist Paco Aguilar that Barcelona's players were threatened by police in the changing room, though nothing was ever proven.[57] Despite the difficult political situation, CF Barcelona enjoyed considerable success during the 1940s and 1950s. In 1945, with Josep Samitier as coach and players like César, Ramallets and Velasco, they won La Liga for the first time since 1929. They added two more titles in 1948 and 1949.[58] In 1949, they also won the first Copa Latina.[59] In June 1950, Barcelona signed László Kubala, who was to be an important figure at the club.[60] On a rainy Sunday of 1951, the crowd left Les Corts stadium after a 2–1 win against Santander by foot, refusing to catch any trams, and surprising the Francoist authorities. The reason was simple: at the same time, a tram strike was taking place in Barcelona, receiving the support of blaugrana fans. Events like this made CF Barcelona represent much more than just Catalonia and many progressive Spaniards saw the club as a staunch defender of rights and freedoms.[61][62] Coach Ferdinand Daučík and László Kubala led the team to five different trophies including La Liga, the Copa del Generalísimo, the Copa Latina, the Copa Eva Duarte, and the Copa Martini & Rossi in 1952. In 1953, the club won La Liga and the Copa del Generalísimo again.[40] With Helenio Herrera as coach, a young Luis Suárez, the European Footballer of the Year in 1960, and two influential Hungarians recommended by Kubala, Sándor Kocsis and Zoltán Czibor, the team won another national double in 1959 and a La Liga and Fairs Cup double in 1960. In 1961, they became the first club to beat Real Madrid in a European Cup play-off. However, they lost 2–3 to Benfica in the final.[63][64] The 1960s were less successful for the club, with Real Madrid monopolising La Liga. The completion of Camp Nou, finished in 1957, meant the club had little money to spend on new players.[64] The 1960s saw the emergence of Josep Maria Fusté and Carles Rexach, and the club won the Copa del Generalísimo in 1963 and the Fairs Cup in 1966. Barcelona restored some pride by beating Real Madrid 1–0 in the 1968 Copa del Generalísimo final at the Santiago Bernabéu in front of dictator Francisco Franco, with coach Salvador Artigas, a former republican pilot in the Civil War. With the end of Franco's dictatorship in 1974, the club changed its official name back to Futbol Club Barcelona and reverted the crest to its original design, including the original letters once again.[65][66] The 1973–74 season saw the arrival of Johan Cruyff, who was bought for a world record £920,000 from Ajax.[67] Already an established player with Ajax, Cruyff quickly won over the Barcelona fans when he told the European press that he chose Barcelona over Real Madrid because he could not play for a club associated with Francisco Franco. He further endeared himself when he named his son \"Jordi\", after the local Catalan Saint George.[68] Next to champions like Juan Manuel Asensi, Carles Rexach and Hugo Sotil, he helped the club win the 1973–74 season for the first time since 1960,[42] defeating Real Madrid 5–0 at the Santiago Bernabéu en route. He was crowned European Footballer of the Year in 1973 during his first season with Barcelona (his second Ballon d'Or win; he won his first while playing for Ajax in 1971). Cruyff received this prestigious award a third time (the first player to do so) in 1974, while he was still with Barcelona.[69] In 1978, Josep Lluís Núñez became the first elected president of FC Barcelona, and, since then, the members of Barcelona have elected the club president. The process of electing a president of FC Barcelona was closely tied to Spain's transition to democracy in 1974 and the end of Franco's dictatorship. The new president's main objective was to develop Barcelona into a world-class club by giving it stability both on and off the pitch. His presidency was to last for 22 years, and it deeply affected the image of Barcelona, as Núñez held to a strict policy regarding wages and discipline, letting go of such players as Diego Maradona, Romário and Ronaldo rather than meeting their demands.[72][73] On 16 May 1979, the club won its first European Cup Winners' Cup by beating Fortuna Düsseldorf 4–3 in Basel in a final watched by more than 30,000 travelling blaugrana fans. The same year, Núñez began to invest in the club's youth programme by converting La Masia into a dormitory for young academy players from abroad. The name of the dormitory would later become synonymous with the youth programme of Barcelona.[74] In June 1982, Diego Maradona was signed for a world record fee of £5 million from Boca Juniors.[75] In the following season, under coach César Luis Menotti, Barcelona won the Copa del Rey, beating Real Madrid. Maradona's time with Barcelona, however, was short-lived and he soon left for Napoli. At the start of the 1984–85 season, Terry Venables was hired as manager and he won La Liga with noteworthy displays by German midfielder Bernd Schuster. The next season, he took the team to their second European Cup final, only to lose on penalties to Steaua București during a dramatic evening in Seville.[72] Around this time, tensions began to arise between what was perceived as president Núñez's dictatorial rule and the nationalistic support group, Boixos Nois. The group, identified with a left-wing separatism, repeatedly demanded the resignation of Núñez and openly defied him through chants and banners at matches. At the same time, Barcelona experienced an eruption in skinheads, who often identified with a right-wing separatism. The skinheads slowly transferred the Boixos Nois' ideology from liberalism to fascism, which caused division within the group and a sudden support for Núñez's presidency.[76] Inspired by British hooligans, the remaining Boixos Nois became violent, causing havoc leading to large-scale arrests.[77] After the 1986 FIFA World Cup, Barcelona signed the English top scorer Gary Lineker, along with goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta, but the team could not achieve success, as Schuster was excluded from the team. Terry Venables was subsequently fired at the beginning of the 1987–88 season and replaced with Luis Aragonés. The season finished with the players rebelling against president Núñez, in an event known as the Hesperia mutiny, and a 1–0 victory in the Copa del Rey final against Real Sociedad.[72] In 1988, Johan Cruyff returned to the club, this time as manager and he assembled what would later be dubbed the \"Dream Team\".[78] He used a mix of Spanish players like Pep Guardiola, José Mari Bakero, Jon Andoni Goikoetxea, Miguel Angel Nadal, and Txiki Begiristain while signing international players such as Ronald Koeman, Michael Laudrup, Romário, and Hristo Stoichkov.[79] It was ten years after the inception of the youth programme, La Masia, when the young players began to graduate and play for their first team. Pep Guardiola, the future coach of Barcelona, was one of the first graduates and would go on to receive international recognition.[80] Under Cruyff's guidance, Barcelona won four consecutive La Liga titles from 1991 to 1994. They beat Sampdoria in both the 1989 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup final and the 1992 European Cup final at Wembley, with a free kick goal from Dutch international Ronald Koeman. They also won a Copa del Rey in 1990, the European Super Cup in 1992 and three Supercopa de España trophies.[81] With 11 trophies, Cruyff became the club's most successful manager at that point. He also became the club's longest consecutive serving manager, serving eight years.[82] Cruyff's fortune was to change, and, in his final two seasons, he failed to win any trophies and fell out with president Josep Lluís Núñez, resulting in his departure.[72] Reacting to Cruyff's departure, an independent protest group was organised by Armand Caraben, Joan Laporta and Alfons Godall.[83] The objective of the group, called L'Elefant Blau, was to oppose the presidency of Núñez, which they regarded as a corruption of the club's traditional values.[83][84] Laporta would later take over the presidency of Barcelona in 2003.[85] Cruyff was briefly replaced by Bobby Robson, who took charge of the club for a single season in 1996–97. He recruited Ronaldo for a world record transfer fee from his previous club, PSV and delivered a cup treble, winning the Copa del Rey, UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and the Supercopa de España, with Ronaldo registering 47 goals in 49 games.[86] Despite his success, Robson was only ever seen as a short-term solution while the club waited for Louis van Gaal to become available.[87] Like Maradona, Ronaldo only stayed a short time before he left for Inter Milan in another world record transfer.[86] However, new heroes emerged, such as Luís Figo, Patrick Kluivert, Luis Enrique and Rivaldo, and the team won a Copa del Rey and La Liga double in 1998. In 1999, the club celebrated its centenari, winning the Primera División title, and Rivaldo became the fourth Barcelona player to be awarded European Footballer of the Year. Despite this domestic success, the failure to emulate Real Madrid in the Champions League led to van Gaal and Núñez resigning in 2000.[87] The departures of Núñez and Van Gaal were hardly noticed by the fans when compared to that of Luís Figo, then club vice-captain. Figo had become a cult hero and was considered by Catalans to be one of their own. Barcelona fans, however, were distraught by Figo's decision to join arch-rivals Real Madrid, and, during subsequent visits to Camp Nou, Figo was given an extremely hostile reception. Upon his first return, a piglet's head and a full bottle of whiskey were thrown at him from the crowd.[90] The next three years saw the club in decline, and managers came and went. Van Gaal was replaced by Lorenzo Serra Ferrer who, despite an extensive investment in players in the summer of 2000, presided over a mediocre league campaign and a first-round Champions League exit, and was dismissed late in the season. Long-serving Barcelona deputy coach Carles Rexach was appointed as his replacement, initially on a temporary basis, and managed to at least steer the club to the last Champions League spot on the final day of the season against Valencia via an exceptional performance from Rivaldo, who completed arguably the greatest hat-trick in history with an overhead bicycle kick winner in the final minute to secure qualification.[91][92][93] Despite better form in La Liga and a good run to the semi-finals of the Champions League, Rexach was never viewed as a long-term solution and that summer Van Gaal returned to the club for a second spell as manager. What followed, despite another decent Champions League performance, was one of the worst La Liga campaigns in the club's history, with the team as low as 15th in February 2003. This led to Van Gaal's resignation and replacement for the rest of the campaign by Radomir Antić, though a sixth-place finish was the best that he could manage. At the end of the season, Antić's short-term contract was not renewed, and club president Joan Gaspart resigned, his position having been made completely untenable by such a disastrous season on top of the club's overall decline in fortunes since he became president three years prior.[94] After the disappointment of the Gaspart era, the combination of a new young president, Joan Laporta, and a young new manager, former Dutch and AC Milan star Frank Rijkaard, saw the club bounce back. On the field, an influx of international players, including Ronaldinho, Deco, Henrik Larsson, Ludovic Giuly, Samuel Eto'o, Rafael Márquez and Edgar Davids, combined with home grown Spanish players, such as Carles Puyol, Andrés Iniesta, Xavi and Víctor Valdés, led to the club's return to success. Barcelona won La Liga and the Supercopa de España in 2004–05, and Ronaldinho and Eto'o were voted first and third, respectively, in the FIFA World Player of the Year awards.[95] In the 2005–06 season, Barcelona repeated their league and Supercopa successes. The pinnacle of the league season arrived at the Santiago Bernabéu in a 3–0 win over Real Madrid. It was Rijkaard's second victory at the Bernabéu, making him the first Barcelona manager to win there twice. Ronaldinho's performance was so impressive that after his second goal, which was Barcelona's third, some Real Madrid fans gave him a standing ovation.[96] In the Champions League, Barcelona beat English club Arsenal in the final. Trailing 1–0 to a ten-man Arsenal and with less than 15 minutes remaining, they came back to win 2–1, with substitute Henrik Larsson, in his final appearance for the club, setting up goals for Samuel Eto'o and fellow substitute Juliano Belletti, for the club's first European Cup victory in 14 years.[97] Despite being the favourites and starting strongly, Barcelona finished the 2006–07 season without trophies. A pre-season US tour was later blamed for a string of injuries to key players, including leading scorer Eto'o and rising star Lionel Messi. There was open feuding as Eto'o publicly criticised coach Rijkaard and Ronaldinho.[98] Ronaldinho also admitted that a lack of fitness affected his form.[99] In La Liga, Barcelona were in first place for much of the season, but inconsistency in the New Year saw Real Madrid overtake them to become champions. Barcelona advanced to the semi-finals of the Copa del Rey, winning the first leg against Getafe 5–2, with a goal from Messi bringing comparison to Diego Maradona's goal of the century, but then lost the second leg 4–0. They took part in the 2006 FIFA Club World Cup, but were beaten by a late goal in the final against Brazilian side Internacional.[100] In the Champions League, Barcelona were knocked out of the competition in the last 16 by eventual runners-up Liverpool on away goals.[101] Barcelona finished the 2007–08 season third in La Liga and reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League and Copa del Rey, both times losing to the eventual champions, Manchester United and Valencia, respectively. The day after a 4–1 defeat to Real Madrid, Joan Laporta announced that Barcelona B coach Pep Guardiola would take over Frank Rijkaard's duties on 30 June 2008.[102] Barcelona B youth manager Pep Guardiola took over Frank Rijkaard's duties at the conclusion of the season.[102] Guardiola brought with him the now famous tiki-taka style of play he had been taught during his time in the Barcelona youth teams. In the process, Guardiola sold Ronaldinho and Deco and started building the Barcelona team around Xavi, Andrés Iniesta and Lionel Messi.[104] Barça beat Athletic Bilbao 4–1 in the 2009 Copa del Rey final, winning the competition for a record-breaking 25th time.[105] A historic 2–6 victory against Real Madrid followed three days later and ensured that Barcelona became 2008–09 La Liga champions.[106] Barça finished the season by beating Manchester United 2–0 at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome, with goals from Eto'o and Messi, to win their third Champions League title, and complete the first ever treble won by a Spanish team.[107][108][109] The team went on to win the 2009 Supercopa de España against Athletic Bilbao[110] and the 2009 UEFA Super Cup against Shakhtar Donetsk,[111] becoming the first European club to win both domestic and European Super Cups following a treble. In December 2009, Barcelona won the 2009 Club World Cup.[112] Barcelona accomplished two new records in Spanish football in 2010 as they retained the La Liga trophy with 99 points and won the Supercopa de España for a ninth time.[113][114] After Laporta's departure from the club in June 2010, Sandro Rosell was soon elected as the new president. The elections were held on 13 June, where he received 61.35% (57,088 votes, a record) of total votes.[115] Rosell signed David Villa from Valencia for €40 million[116] and Javier Mascherano from Liverpool for €19 million.[117] At the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, Barcelona players that had graduated from the club's La Masia youth system would play a major role in Spain becoming world champions. On 11 July, seven players who came through the academy participated in the final, six of whom were Barcelona players who started the match, with Iniesta scoring the winning goal against the Netherlands.[118] In November 2010, Barcelona defeated their main rival Real Madrid 5–0 in El Clásico.[119] At the ceremony for the 2010 FIFA Ballon d'Or in December, Barcelona's La Masia became the first youth academy ever to have all three finalists for the Ballon d'Or, with Messi, Iniesta and Xavi being named the three best players in the world for 2010.[120] In the 2010–11 season, Barcelona retained the La Liga trophy, their third title in succession, finishing with 96 points.[121] In April 2011, the club reached the Copa del Rey final, losing 1–0 to Real Madrid at the Mestalla Stadium in Valencia.[122] In May, Barcelona defeated Manchester United in the 2011 Champions League Final 3–1 held at Wembley Stadium, a repeat of the 2009 final, winning their fourth European Cup.[123] In August 2011, La Masia graduate Cesc Fàbregas was bought from Arsenal and he would help Barcelona defend the Spanish Supercup against Real Madrid. The Supercup victory brought the total number of official trophies to 73, matching the number of titles won by Real Madrid.[124] Later the same month, Barcelona won the UEFA Super Cup defeating Porto 2–0 with goals from Messi and Fàbregas. This extended the club's overall number of official trophies to 74, surpassing Real Madrid's total amount of official trophies.[125] The Super Cup victory also saw Guardiola win his 12th trophy out of a possible 15 in his three years at the helm of the club, becoming the all-time record holder of most titles won as a coach at Barcelona.[126] In December, Barcelona won the Club World Cup for a record second time since its establishment, after defeating 2011 Copa Libertadores holders Santos 4–0 in the final thanks to two goals from Messi and goals from Xavi and Fàbregas.[127] As a result, the overall trophy haul during the reign of Guardiola was further extended and saw Barcelona win their 13th trophy out of a possible 16.[128][129] Considered by some in the sport to be the greatest team of all time, with Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson stating, ”They mesmerise you with their passing”,[22] their five trophies in 2011 saw them receive the Laureus World Sports Award for Team of the Year.[130] In the 2011–12 season, Barcelona lost the semi-finals of the Champions League against Chelsea. Guardiola, who had been on a rolling contract and had faced criticism over his recent tactics and squad selections,[131][132] announced that he would step down as manager on 30 June and be succeeded by assistant Tito Vilanova.[133][134] Guardiola finished his tenure with Barça winning the Copa del Rey final 3–0, bringing the tally to 14 trophies that Barça had won under his coaching.[135] It was announced in summer of 2012 that Tito Vilanova, assistant manager at Barcelona, would take over from Pep Guardiola as manager.[136] Following his appointment, Barcelona went on an incredible run that saw them hold the top spot on the league table for the entire season, recording only two losses and amassing 100 points. Their top scorer once again was Lionel Messi, who scored 46 goals in La Liga, including two hat-tricks. On 11 May 2013, Barcelona were crowned as the Spanish football champions for the 22nd time, still with four games left to play. Ultimately, Barcelona ended the season 15 points clear of rivals Real Madrid, despite losing 2–1 to them at the beginning of March.[137] They reached the semi-final stage of both the Copa del Rey and the Champions League, going out to Real Madrid and Bayern Munich respectively. On 19 July, it was announced that Vilanova was resigning as Barcelona manager because his throat cancer had returned, and he would be receiving treatment for the second time after a three-month medical leave in December 2012.[138] On 22 July 2013, Gerardo \"Tata\" Martino was confirmed as manager of Barcelona for the 2013–14 season.[139] Barcelona won the 2013 Supercopa de España 1–1 on away goals.[140] On 23 January 2014, Sandro Rosell resigned as president by the admissibility of a complaint for alleged misappropriation following the transfer of Neymar.[141] Josep Maria Bartomeu replaced him to finish the term.[142] Barcelona won the treble in the 2014–15 season, winning La Liga, Copa del Rey and Champions League titles, and became the first European team to have won the treble twice.[143] On 17 May, the club clinched their 23rd La Liga title after defeating Atlético Madrid.[144] This was Barcelona's seventh La Liga title in the last ten years.[145] On 30 May, the club defeated Athletic Bilbao in the Copa del Rey final at Camp Nou.[146] On 6 June, Barcelona won the 2015 Champions League Final with a 3–1 win against Juventus, which completed the treble, the club's second in six years.[147] Barcelona's attacking trio of Messi, Suárez and Neymar, dubbed \"MSN\", scored 122 goals in all competitions, the most in a season for an attacking trio in Spanish football history.[148] On 11 August, Barcelona started the 2015–16 season winning a joint record fifth European Super Cup by beating Sevilla 5–4 in the 2015 UEFA Super Cup. They ended the year with a 3–0 win over Argentine club River Plate in the 2015 Club World Cup final on 20 December to win the trophy for a record third time, with Suárez, Messi and Iniesta the top three players of the tournament.[149] The Club World Cup was Barcelona's 20th international title, a record only matched by Egyptian club Al Ahly.[150][151] By scoring 180 goals in 2015 in all competitions, Barcelona set the record for most goals scored in a calendar year, breaking Real Madrid's record of 178 goals scored in 2014.[152] On 10 February 2016, qualifying for the sixth Copa del Rey final in the last eight seasons, Luis Enrique's Barcelona broke the club's record of 28 consecutive games unbeaten in all competitions set by Guardiola's team in the 2010–11 season, with a 1–1 draw with Valencia in the second leg of the 2015–16 Copa del Rey.[153][154] With a 5–1 win at Rayo Vallecano on 3 March, Barcelona's 35th match unbeaten, the club broke Real Madrid's Spanish record of 34 games unbeaten in all competitions from the 1988–1989 season.[155][156] After Barça reached 39 matches unbeaten, their run ended on 2 April 2016 with a 2–1 defeat to Real Madrid at Camp Nou.[157] On 14 May 2016, Barcelona won their sixth La Liga title in eight seasons.[158] The front three of Messi, Suárez and Neymar finished the season with 131 goals, breaking the record they had set the previous year for most goals by an attacking trio in a single season.[159] On 8 March 2017, Barcelona made the largest comeback in Champions League history in the 2016–17 UEFA Champions League Round of 16 second Leg, defeating Paris Saint-Germain 6–1 (aggregate score 6–5), despite losing the first leg in France by a score of 4–0.[160] On 29 May 2017, former player Ernesto Valverde was named as Luis Enrique's successor.[161] On 20 September 2017, Barcelona issued a statement exercising their stance on the 2017 Catalan referendum saying, \"FC Barcelona, in holding the utmost respect for its diverse body of members, will continue to support the will of the majority of Catalan people, and will do so in a civil, peaceful, and exemplary way\".[162] The match against UD Las Palmas on the referendum day was requested to be postponed by the Barcelona board due to heavy violence in Catalonia, but it (the request) was declined by La Liga, therefore being held behind closed doors.[163] Two directors, Jordi Monés and Carles Vilarrubí, handed in their resignations in protest at the game's being played.[164] Winning La Liga for the 2017–18 season, on 9 May 2018, Barcelona defeated Villarreal 5–1 to set the longest unbeaten streak (43 games) in La Liga history.[165] On 27 April 2019, Barcelona won their 26th La Liga title.[166] However, the La Liga title was overshadowed by an improbable Champions League exit to Liverpool in the semi-finals, with Barça losing the second leg 0–4 after being up 3–0 after a home victory.[167] On 13 January 2020, following the loss to Atlético Madrid in the Spanish Supercup, former Real Betis coach Quique Setién replaced Ernesto Valverde as the new head coach of Barcelona.[168] Ultimately Barcelona finished the season trophyless for first time in 12 years. On 17 August, the club confirmed that Setién had been removed from his position as manager with director of football Eric Abidal also dismissed from his position.[169] Two days later, Ronald Koeman was appointed as the new head coach of Barcelona.[170] Rising dissatisfaction among supporters due to worsening finances and decline on the pitch in the previous season led to Josep Maria Bartomeu announcing his resignation as president on 27 October 2020, to avoid facing a vote of no confidence from the club members.[171][172] On 7 March 2021, Joan Laporta was elected president of Barcelona with 54.28% of the vote.[173] Barcelona won their 31st Copa del Rey, their only trophy under Ronald Koeman, after defeating Athletic Bilbao 4–0 in the final.[174] In August 2021 Barcelona found themselves unable to comply with La Liga's Financial Fair Play requirements, and revealed a club debt of €1.35bn and a wage bill accounting for 103% of total income. Negotiations with Lionel Messi, now in the final year of his contract, had been ongoing for some time. However, on 5 August 2021, Barcelona announced that they would be unable to re-sign Messi to an extension due to La Liga regulations. This was despite the fact that the club and Messi had reached an agreement over the details of a new contract. Messi departed the club after 21 years as a Barça player, and the club's all-time leading goalscorer, and signed on a free transfer with French club Paris Saint-Germain.[175][176] The financial implications also restricted Barcelona in the transfer market and as a result most of the incoming players were either free transfers or loans and they had to reduce players' wages to register the incoming players.[177] Poor performances in La Liga and the Champions League led to the sacking of Ronald Koeman on 28 October, with a club legend Xavi replacing him.[178][179] Xavi could not reverse the fortunes in the Champions League, and Barcelona dropped down to the Europa League for the first time since 2003–04, subsequently exiting in the quarter-finals.[180] In the domestic league, Xavi improved Barça's form and guided them from ninth to second, guaranteeing a Champions League spot next season. However, this also meant Barcelona finished trophyless after earlier Supercopa and Copa del Rey exits.[181] On 15 January 2023, Xavi guided Barcelona to their first trophy since the 2021 Copa del Rey, as the Catalans defeated Real Madrid 3–1 in the Supercopa de España final.[182] The nickname culer for a Barcelona supporter is derived from the Catalan cul (English: arse), as the spectators at the first stadium, Camp de la Indústria, sat with their culs over the stand.[183][184] In Spain, about 25% of the population is said to be Barça sympathisers, second behind Real Madrid, supported by 32% of the population.[185] Throughout Europe, Barcelona is the favourite second-choice club.[186] The club's membership figures have seen a significant increase from 100,000 in the 2003–04 season to 170,000 in September 2009,[187] the sharp rise being attributed to the influence of Ronaldinho and then-president Joan Laporta's media strategy that focused on Spanish and English online media.[188][189] As of 31 May 2023[update], the club has 150,317 memberships, called socis.[190] In addition to membership, as of March 2022[update] there are 1,264 officially registered fan clubs, called penyes, around the world.[191] The fan clubs promote Barcelona in their locality and receive beneficial offers when visiting Barcelona.[192] Among the best supported teams globally, Barcelona has the second highest social media following in the world among sports teams, with over 103 million Facebook fans as of December 2021[update], only behind Real Madrid with 111 million.[12][193] The club has had many prominent people among its supporters, including Pope John Paul II, who was an honorary member, and former prime minister of Spain José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero.[194][195] There is often a fierce rivalry between the two strongest teams in a national league, and this is particularly the case in La Liga, where the game between Barcelona and Real Madrid is known as \"The Classic\" (El Clásico). From the start of national competitions the clubs were seen as representatives of two rival regions in Spain: Catalonia and Castile, as well as of the two cities. The rivalry reflects what many regard as the political and cultural tensions felt between Catalans and the Castilians, seen by one author as a re-enactment of the Spanish Civil War.[196] Over the years, the head-to-head record between the two clubs is 102 victories for Madrid, 100 victories for Barcelona, and 52 draws.[197] As early as the 1930s, Barcelona \"had developed a reputation as a symbol of Catalan identity, opposed to the centralising tendencies of Madrid\".[198][199] In 1936, when Francisco Franco started the Coup d'état against the democratic Second Spanish Republic, the president of Barcelona, Josep Sunyol, member of the Republican Left of Catalonia and Deputy to The Cortes, was arrested and executed without trial by Franco's troops[200] (Sunyol was exercising his political activities, visiting Republican troops north of Madrid).[198] During the dictatorships of Miguel Primo de Rivera and especially Francisco Franco, all regional languages and identities in Spain were frowned upon and restrained. As such, most citizens of Barcelona were in strong opposition to the fascist-like regime. In this period, Barcelona gained their motto Més que un club (English: More than a club) because of its alleged connection to Catalan nationalist as well as to progressive beliefs.[201] There's an ongoing controversy as to what extent Franco's rule (1939–75) influenced the activities and on-pitch results of both Barcelona and Real Madrid. Fans of both clubs tend to exaggerate the myths favouring their narratives. Most historians agree than Franco did not have a preferred football team, but his Spanish nationalist beliefs led him to associate himself with the establishment teams, such as Atlético Aviación and Madrid FC (that recovered its royal name after the fall of the Republic). On the other hand, he also wanted the renamed CF Barcelona succeed as \"Spanish team\" rather than a Catalan one. During the early years of Franco's rule, Real Madrid weren't particularly successful, winning two Copa del Generalísimo titles and a Copa Eva Duarte; Barcelona claimed three league titles, one Copa del Generalísimo and one Copa Eva Duarte. During that period, Atlético Aviación were believed to be the preferred team over Real Madrid. The most contested stories of the period include Real Madrid's 11–1 home win against Barcelona in the Copa del Generalísimo, where the Catalan team alleged intimidation, and the controversial transfer of Alfredo Di Stéfano to Real Madrid despite his agreement with Barcelona. The latter transfer was part of Real Madrid chairman Santiago Bernabéu's \"revolution\" that ushered in the era of unprecedented dominance. Bernabéu, himself a veteran of the Civil War who fought for Franco's forces, saw Real Madrid on top not only of Spanish but also European football, helping create the European Cup, the first true competition for Europe's best club sides. His vision was fulfilled when Real Madrid not only started winning consecutive league titles but also swept the first five editions of the European Cup in the 1950s.[202] These events had a profound impact on Spanish football and influenced Franco's attitude. According to historians, during this time he realized the importance of Real Madrid for his regime's international image, and the club became his preferred team until his death. Fernando Maria Castiella, who served as Minister of Foreign Affairs under Franco from 1957 until 1969, noted that \"[Real Madrid] is the best embassy we have ever had.\" Franco died in 1975, and the Spanish transition to democracy soon followed. Under his rule, Real Madrid had won 14 league titles, 6 Copa del Generalísimo titles, 1 Copa Eva Duarte, 6 European Cups, 2 Latin Cups, and 1 Intercontinental Cup. In the same period, Barcelona had won 8 league titles, 9 Copa del Generalísimo titles, 3 Copa Eva Duarte titles, 3 Inter-Cities Fairs Cups, and 2 Latin Cups.[203][204] The rivalry was intensified during the 1950s when the clubs disputed the signing of Alfredo Di Stéfano. Di Stéfano had impressed both Barcelona and Real Madrid while playing for Los Millionarios in Bogotá, Colombia, during a players' strike in his native Argentina. Soon after Millonarios' return to Colombia, Barcelona directors visited Buenos Aires and agreed with River Plate, the last FIFA-affiliated team to have held Di Stéfano's rights, for his transfer in 1954 for the equivalent of 150 million Italian lira (according to other sources 200,000 dollars). This started a battle between the two Spanish rivals for his rights. FIFA appointed Armando Muñoz Calero, former president of the Spanish Football Federation as mediator. Calero decided to let Di Stéfano play the 1953–54 and 1955–56 seasons in Madrid, and the 1954–55 and 1956–57 seasons in Barcelona. The agreement was approved by the Football Association and their respective clubs. Although the Catalans agreed, the decision created various discontent among the Blaugrana members and the president was forced to resign in September 1953. Barcelona sold Madrid their half-share, and Di Stéfano moved to Los Blancos, signing a four-year contract. Real paid 5.5 million Spanish pesetas for the transfer, plus a 1.3 million bonus for the purchase, an annual fee to be paid to the Millonarios, and a 16,000 salary for Di Stéfano with a bonus double that of his teammates, for a total of 40% of the annual revenue of the Madrid club.[205] Di Stéfano became integral in the subsequent success achieved by Real Madrid, scoring twice in his first game against Barcelona. With him, Madrid won the first five editions of the European Cup.[206] The 1960s saw the rivalry reach the European stage when Real Madrid and Barcelona met twice in the European Cup, with Madrid triumphing en route to their fifth consecutive title in 1959–60 and Barcelona prevailing en route to losing the final in 1960–61. In 2002, the European encounter between the clubs was dubbed the \"Match of The Century\" by Spanish media, and Madrid's win was watched by more than 500 million people.[207] An intense fixture which is marked by its indiscipline in addition to memorable goal celebrations from both teams – often involving mocking the opposition – such notable celebrations occurred in 2009 when Barcelona captain Carles Puyol kissed his Catalan armband in front of incensed Madrid fans at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium and in 2017 when Lionel Messi celebrated his 93rd-minute winner for Barcelona against Real Madrid at the Bernabéu by taking off his Barcelona shirt and holding it up to incensed Real Madrid fans – with his name and number facing them.[208] Barça's local rival has always been Espanyol. Blanc-i-blaus, being one of the clubs granted royal patronage, was founded exclusively by Spanish football fans, unlike the multinational nature of Barça's primary board. The founding message of the club was clearly anti-Barcelona, and they disapprovingly saw FC Barcelona as a team of foreigners.[209] The rivalry was strengthened by what Catalonians saw as a provocative representative of Madrid.[210] Their original ground was in the affluent district of Sarrià.[211][212] Traditionally, Espanyol was seen by the vast majority of Barcelona's citizens as a club which cultivated a kind of compliance to the central authority, in stark contrast to Barça's revolutionary spirit.[213] Also in the 1960s and 1970s, while FC Barcelona acted as an integrating force for Catalonia's new arrivals from poorer regions of Spain expecting to find a better life, Espanyol drew their support mainly from sectors close to the regime such as policemen, military officers, civil servants and career fascists.[214] In 1918, Espanyol started a counter-petition against autonomy, which at that time had become a pertinent issue.[209] Later on, an Espanyol supporter group would join the Falangists in the Spanish Civil War, siding with the fascists. Despite these differences in ideology, the derbi has always been more relevant to Espanyol supporters than Barcelona ones due to the difference in objectives. In recent years the rivalry has become less political, as Espanyol translated its official name and anthem from Spanish to Catalan.[209] Though it is the most played local derby in the history of La Liga, it is also the most unbalanced, with Barcelona overwhelmingly dominant. In the primera división league table, Espanyol has only managed to end above Barça on three occasions from 87 seasons (1928–2022) and the only all-Catalan Copa del Rey final was won by Barça in 1957. Espanyol has the consolation of achieving the largest margin win with a 6–0 in 1951, while Barcelona's biggest win was 5–0 on seven occasions (in 1933, 1947, 1964, 1975, 1992, 2016 and 2017). Espanyol achieved a 2–1 win against Barça during the 2008–09 season, becoming the first team to defeat Barcelona at Camp Nou in their treble-winning season.[215] One of Barcelona's rivals in European football is Italian club AC Milan.[216][217][218][219] The team against which Barcelona has played the most matches (19), it is also the third most played match in European club competitions, behind Real Madrid–Juventus (21) and Real Madrid–Bayern Munich (26).[220][221][222] Two of the most successful clubs in Europe, Milan has won seven European Cups to Barça's five, while both clubs have won a record five European Super Cups.[223] Barcelona and Milan have won other continental titles, which make them the second and third most decorated teams in world football, with 19 and 14 titles respectively, both behind Real Madrid's 23.[224] Barcelona leads the head-to-head record with eight wins and five defeats. The first encounter between the two clubs was in the 1959–60 European Cup. They faced off in the round of 16 and Barça won the tie on a 7–1 aggregate score (0–2 in Milan and 5–1 in Barcelona).[225] While Milan had never knocked Barcelona out of the European Cup, they beat Johan Cruyff's Dream Team 4–0 in the 1994 Champions League final, despite being the underdogs.[226][227] In 2013, however, Barcelona made a \"historic\" comeback from a 0–2 first leg defeat in the round of 16 of the 2012–13 Champions League, winning 4–0 at Camp Nou.[228][229] Along with Real Madrid, Athletic Bilbao, and Osasuna, Barcelona is organised as a registered association.[230][231] Unlike a limited company, it is not possible to purchase shares in the club, but only membership.[232] The members of Barcelona, called socis, form an assembly of delegates which is the highest governing body of the club.[233] As of 31 May 2023[update], the club has 150,317 socis.[190] In 2010, Forbes evaluated Barcelona's worth to be around €752 million (US$1 billion), ranking them fourth after Manchester United, Real Madrid and Arsenal, based on figures from the 2008–09 season.[234][235] According to Deloitte, Barcelona had a recorded revenue of €366 million in the same period, ranking second to Real Madrid, who generated €401 million in revenue.[236] In 2013, Forbes magazine ranked Barcelona the third most valuable sports team in the world, behind Real Madrid and Manchester United, with a value of $2.6 billion.[237] In 2014, Forbes ranked them the second most valuable sports team in the world, worth $3.2 billion, and Deloitte ranked them the world's fourth richest football club in terms of revenue, with an annual turnover of €484.6 million.[238][239] In 2017, Forbes ranked them the fourth most valuable sports team in the world with a team value of $3.64 billion.[240] In 2018, Barcelona became the first sports team to surpass $1bn in annual revenues.[241] In November 2018 Barcelona became the first sports team with average first-team pay in excess of £10m ($13.8m) per year.[242][243] However, years of profligate spending under the leadership of Josep Maria Bartomeu (president between 2014 and 2020) and other factors, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, saw the club's gross debt rise to about $1.4 billion in 2021, much of it short-term.[241] On November 9, 2024, Barcelona announced its new sponsership deal with Nike. It is said that it is the highest deal in football history.[244] Since its origins, Barcelona has had a close relationship with the world of culture, especially, with Catalan culture.[245][246][247] The club's statutes from 1932 already said that Barça \"is an association of a cultural and sporting nature\".[248] The club and its players have been a source of inspiration for writers, musicians, visual artists, journalists, cartoonists, theater, and film people.[249][250] In literature, some great Catalan writers they were inspired by the club. In 1957, on the occasion of the inauguration of the Camp Nou, Josep Maria de Sagarra dedicated a poem titled Blau i grana.[251] Poet Manuel Vázquez Montalbán wrote regularly about his vision of the team. Some expressions emerged that caught on in the popular imagination, such as identifying Barça with \"The unarmed army of Catalonia.\" He also wrote that \"Barça is the only legal institution that unites the man on the street with the Catalonia that could have been and was not.\"[252][253] The great anniversaries have been favorable occasions for the club to involve great Catalan figures from the cultural world in its activities. Names such as Josep Segrelles, Joan Miró and Antoni Tàpies have signed commemorative posters, just as Jaume Picas and the writer Josep Maria Espinàs, on the occasion of the club's 75th anniversary, wrote the lyrics for Cant del Barça, the current anthem, with music by Manuel Valls.[254][255] The Blaugrana world has also been a source of inspiration in the plastic arts, with names such as Jordi Alumà, Josep Maria Subirachs, Antoni Tàpies or Josep Viladomat, who made the 'Avi del Barça' sculpture in the La Masia.[256] Salvador Dalí paid tribute to the club's 75th anniversary with an etching.[257] In performing arts, music has also been present, from the tango that Gardel dedicated to Samitier to the songs of Joan Manuel Serrat, La Trinca and many others. Theater has also been a good way to express the feelings of Barça fans, from the El Paralelo cuplés from before the Civil War or skits like 'El Partido del Domingo', by Castaños, to more recent texts, like El culékulé, by Xavier Bosch.[258] In times of political difficulty or lack of freedoms, Barça has been a refuge and means of expression for cultural and artistic activities. In 2013, the club highlighted the 'Barça Cultura' plan, an initiative that promotes the area of institutional relations and protocol with the aim of offering Barcelona as a platform to promote culture in Catalonia.[259] In 2022, Barcelona and Òmnium sign an agreement to promote the Catalan language, culture and the country.[260] There are many documentaries and films that have been created throughout history to capture the successes and journey of the club over the years. More recently, in December 2022, Amazon Prime Video released a five-episode docuseries called FC Barcelona: A New Era.[261] It documented the club by spending time with the coaching staff and players behind the scenes both on and off the field throughout their 2021–22 season. In September 2023, Amazon Prime Video launched the second season with a five-episode docuseries. It focuses on their 2022-23 behind the scenes season.[262] In March 2021, Lionel Messi overtook Xavi's record of 767 games played for the club, and presently has made 778 official appearances in all competitions, while also holding the record for the most appearances in La Liga matches for Barcelona, with 520.[263] Barcelona's all-time highest goalscorer in official competitions is Lionel Messi with 672 goals, surpassing César Rodríguez's 232 goals in March 2012, a record which stood for 60 years.[264] In December 2020, Messi also overtook Pelé's 643 goals for Santos to become the highest official scorer for a single club.[265] Messi is the record goalscorer for Barcelona in European and international club competitions,[266] and the record league scorer with 474 goals in La Liga.[267] Four other players have managed to score over 100 league goals for Barcelona: César Rodríguez (190), Luis Suárez (147), László Kubala (131) and Samuel Eto'o (108).[268] Josep Samitier is the club's highest goalscorer in the Copa del Rey, with 64 goals.[269] László Kubala holds the La Liga record for most goals scored in one match, with seven goals against Sporting Gijón in 1952.[270] Lionel Messi co-holds the Champions League record with five goals against Bayer Leverkusen in 2012.[271] Eulogio Martínez became Barça's top goalscorer in a cup game, when he scored seven goals against Atlético Madrid in 1957.[266] Barcelona goalkeepers have won a record number of Zamora trophies (20), with Antoni Ramallets and Víctor Valdés winning a record five each. Valdés had a ratio of 0.832 goals-conceded-per-game, a La Liga record,[272] and he also holds the record for longest period without conceding a goal (896 minutes) in all competitions for Barcelona.[273] Claudio Bravo has the record of best unbeaten start in a season in La Liga history, at 754 minutes.[274][275] Barcelona's longest serving manager is Jack Greenwell, with nine years in two spells (1917–1924) and (1931–1933), and Pep Guardiola is the club's most successful manager (14 trophies in 4 years). The most successful Barcelona player is Lionel Messi with 35 trophies, surpassing Andrés Iniesta, with 32 trophies.[276] Barcelona's Camp Nou is the largest stadium in Europe. The club's highest home attendance was 120,000 in a European Cup quarter-final against Juventus on 3 March 1986.[277] The modernisation of Camp Nou during the 1990s and the introduction of all-seater stands means the record will not be broken for the foreseeable future as the current capacity of the stadium is 99,354.[278] El Barça de les Cinc Copes is the first team in Spanish football to have won five trophies in a single season (1951–1952).[279][280][281] Barcelona is the only club to have played in every season of European competitions since they started in 1955 counting non-UEFA competition Inter-Cities Fairs Cup.[282][283] On 18 December 2009, alongside being the only Spanish club to achieve a continental treble, Barcelona became the first ever European football team to win six trophies in a calendar year (Sextuple).[284][285] In January 2018, Barcelona signed Philippe Coutinho from Liverpool for €120 million, the highest transfer fee in club's history.[286][287] In August 2017, Barcelona player Neymar transferred to Paris Saint-Germain for a world record transfer fee of €222 million.[288][289] In 2016, Barcelona's La Masia was ranked second by the International Centre for Sports Studies (CIES) as the most top-level players producing academy in the world.[290] The club's original crest was a quartered diamond-shaped crest topped by the Crown of Aragon and the bat of King James, and surrounded by two branches, one of a laurel tree and the other a palm.[32] The club shared Barcelona's coat of arms, as a demonstration of its identification with the city and a desire to be recognised as one.[291] In 1910, the club held a competition among its members to design a new crest. The winner was Carles Comamala, who at the time played for the club. Comamala's suggestion became the crest that the club wears today, with some minor variations. The crest consists of the St George Cross in the upper-left corner with the Catalan flag beside it, and the team colours at the bottom.[292] The blue and garnet colours of the shirt were first worn in a match against Hispania in 1900.[293] Several competing theories have been put forth for the blue and garnet design of the Barcelona shirt. The son of the first president, Arthur Witty, claimed it was the idea of his father as the colours were the same as the Merchant Taylor's School team. Another explanation, according to author Toni Strubell, is that the colours are from Robespierre's First Republic. In Catalonia the common perception is that the colours were chosen by Joan Gamper and are those of his home team, FC Basel.[294][295] Since 1998, the club has had a kit deal with Nike. In 2016, the deal was renewed until 2028 for a record €155 million per year. The contract includes a clause sanctioning penalty or agreement termination anytime if Barcelona fail to qualify for the European competitions or is relegated from La Liga.[302][303] In 2023, Barcelona became the revenue leader from the sale of kits and merchandising in Europe with a turnover of €179 million.[304][305] Although Spanish clubs first began displaying sponsor names on their shirts in 1981,[306] Barcelona held off having a name across the front of the shirt until 2006, when the club signed an agreement to have UNICEF's name on their front.[307][308] Unlike traditional deals, this was not to have paying money to the club, but instead to have the club raise money for UNICEF. In 2011, the club signed its first commercial shirt sponsorship deal, when it reached an agreement with Qatar Foundation.[309] Throughout its history, the club has had various official songs. The anthem in use today is \"Cant del Barça\" (The Song of Barça), composed in 1974 on the occasion of the club's 75th anniversary. Authors Josep Maria Espinàs and Jaume Picas composed the lyrics in Catalan, while the music was composed by Manuel Valls.[316][317] The song was first performed on 27 November 1974 at Camp Nou before the match between FC Barcelona and the East Germany national team by a 3,500-man choir led by Oriol Martorell. On November 28, 1988, in celebration of the club's centenary, the song was performed by Catalan singer-songwriter Joan Manuel Serrat at the end of the festival at Camp Nou. Since the 2008–09 season, el Cant del Barça has been featured on the official Barcelona jerseys. On the occasion of the club's 124th anniversary and with the start of preparations for the 125th anniversary, the club presented a new anthem version recording faithful to the essence of the original score and lyrics composed in 1974, with a better quality and enhanced orchestration and vocals. Composed by the Vallès Symphony Orchestra, the Orfeó Català choral society and the Cor Jove youth choir, it is the current official version.[318][319] El Cant del Barça is turned on before Barcelona games take place at Camp Nou, especially during matches against Real Madrid and just before the start of the meeting. The song is also often played for supporters and fans to cheer, chant and celebrate the victory. Barcelona initially played on different fields, one of the first to represent a fixed venue was the Camp de la Indústria. The capacity was about 6,000, and club officials deemed the facilities inadequate for a club with growing membership.[320] In 1922, the number of supporters had surpassed 20,000 and by lending money to the club, Barça was able to build the larger Camp de Les Corts, which had an initial capacity of 20,000 spectators. After the Spanish Civil War the club started attracting more members and a larger number of spectators at matches. This led to several expansion projects: the grandstand in 1944, the southern stand in 1946, and finally the northern stand in 1950. After the last expansion, Les Corts could hold 60,000 spectators.[321] After the construction was complete there was no further room for expansion at Les Corts. Back-to-back La Liga titles in 1948 and 1949 and the signing of László Kubala in June 1950, who would later go on to score 196 goals in 256 matches, drew larger crowds to the games.[321][322][323] The club began to make plans for a new stadium.[321] The building of Camp Nou commenced on 28 March 1954, before a crowd of 60,000 Barça fans. The first stone of the future stadium was laid in place under the auspices of Governor Felipe Acedo Colunga and with the blessing of Archbishop of Barcelona Gregorio Modrego. Construction took three years and ended on 24 September 1957 with a final cost of 288 million pesetas, 336% over budget.[321] In 1980, when the stadium was in need of redesign to meet UEFA criteria, the club raised money by offering supporters the opportunity to inscribe their name on the bricks for a small fee. The idea was popular with supporters, and thousands of people paid the fee. Later this became the centre of controversy when media in Madrid picked up reports that one of the stones was inscribed with the name of long-time Real Madrid chairman and Franco supporter Santiago Bernabéu.[324][325][326] In preparation for the 1992 Summer Olympics two tiers of seating were installed above the previous roofline.[327] It has a current capacity of 99,354 making it the largest stadium in Europe.[328] In December 2021, a record 88% of the club members voted in favor of the Espai Barça project to revamp the club's sporting facilities, being the first online referendum in FC Barcelona history.[329] Originally projected to have been completed in 2021, renovation work on Camp Nou began on 1 June 2023 and it is now aimed to finish by the end of 2026, with an estimated €1.5 billion net funding.[330][331][332] During the renovation period, Barcelona will move for the entire 2023–24 season to Estadi Olímpic Lluís Companys in Montjuïc, expecting to return in November 2024, with the stadium still under construction.[333] There are also other facilities, which include:[334] Spanish teams are limited to three players without EU citizenship. The squad list includes only the principal nationality of each player; several non-European players on the squad have dual citizenship with an EU country. Also, players from the ACP countries that are signatories to the Cotonou Agreement are not counted against non-EU quotas due to the Kolpak ruling.[336] Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules; some limited exceptions apply. Players may hold more than one non-FIFA nationality. Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules; some limited exceptions apply. Players may hold more than one non-FIFA nationality. Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules; some limited exceptions apply.

                "content": "The Boise State Broncos football program represents Boise State University in college football and competes in the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) as a member of the Mountain West Conference. The Broncos play their home games on campus at Albertsons Stadium in Boise, Idaho, and their head coach is Spencer Danielson. Established in 1933, The Broncos have achieved numerous on-field successes, including 22 conference championships, 6 division titles in the Mountain West Mountain Division, and 2 national championships, one in junior college in 1958 and the other in Div 1 FCS in 1980. They have had 7 undefeated seasons (1947, 1948, 1949, 1950, 1958, 2006, and 2009), and 9 playoff appearances, including a first round bye as the #3 seed in the College Football Playoff in 2024. The program has the longest current streak of winning seasons in college football (FBS Level) with 27 and is 3–0 in the Fiesta Bowl with wins in 2007, 2010, and 2014. As of the end of the 2023 season, the Broncos' all-time winning percentage of .725 is the sixth highest among NCAA FBS football teams, while their 491 total wins ranks 105th.[3] Originally a junior college, Boise State first fielded a football team in 1933 under head coach Dusty Kline.[4] That team compiled a record of 1–2–1 (.375).[4][5] Kline was succeeded by Max Eiden.[5] Under Eiden, the Broncos posted a record of 11–17–1 (.397) from 1934 to 1937.[5] Eiden was succeeded by Harry Jacoby, who coached the team from 1938 to the middle of the 1941 season before being called into Army service. The remainder of the 1941 season was coached by George \"Stub\" Allison, who posted a record of 2–1 (.667).[5] The Broncos did not compete in intramural football from 1942 to 1945 due to having a reduced male student population during World War II.[5] Following the war, Jacoby would return to coach the Broncos for one more season in 1946, posting a final record of 14–15–2 (.484). After a year as an assistant, Lyle Smith was promoted to head football coach of Boise Junior College in 1947. Smith saw incredible success as head coach, winning his first 31 games in a row as head coach. In 1950, the team moved into a new 10,000-seat stadium. With the outbreak of the Korean War, Smith, still undefeated as a head coach, was recalled to the Navy and was only able to coach in the first three games of the 1950 season.[6][7] George Blankley assumed the head coaching duties for the remainder of 1950 and the entire 1951 season in Smith's absence and compiled a 16–2 (.889) record. Smith returned as head coach in 1952 and stretched his winning streak all the way to 37 games before suffering his first defeat. In 1954, Smith was a leading candidate for the vacant job at his alma mater Idaho, but withdrew his name from consideration, content at Boise.[8][9] Boise won thirteen conference titles in football under Smith and the NJCAA National Football Championship in 1958.[10] Smith's final record is 150–25–6 (.845).[5] Coach Smith never had a losing season as the head coach. Boise State's football program moved up to four-year status in 1968 under new head coach Tony Knap and competed as an NAIA independent for two seasons.[11][12] The Broncos were accepted into the NCAA in October 1969,[13] and a month later into the Big Sky Conference, effective the following July.[14] The Broncos began NCAA competition in 1970 in Division II (\"College Division\" prior to 1973) in a brand new Bronco Stadium.[15] Knap and the Broncos won three consecutive Big Sky titles from 1973 to 1975 and compiled a record of 71–19–1.[5] Knap was succeeded by Jim Criner in 1976, a defensive assistant the previous season under Dick Vermeil at UCLA, the Rose Bowl champions. BSU won the Big Sky again in 1977, and in 1978, the Broncos and the Big Sky moved up to the new Division I-AA (renamed FCS in 2006). A scouting violation late that season at NAU resulted in probation and compromised an excellent 10–1 season in 1979, undefeated in conference at 7–0;[16] the Broncos were ineligible for the Big Sky title and I-AA playoffs.[17][18][19] Off probation in 1980, BSU won its first national title, taking the I-AA national championship over defending champion Eastern Kentucky in Sacramento. A runner-up to Idaho State in the Big Sky in 1981, BSU hosted Eastern Kentucky in the I-AA semifinals, but lost, 17–23. Criner departed after the 1982 season to accept the head football coach position at Iowa State;[20] his overall record at BSU was 59–21–1 (.735).[5] Lyle Setencich was promoted from defensive coordinator to head coach of Boise State following Criner's departure. Under Setencich, Boise State posted a 24–20 record in four seasons.[21] Setencich's final season in 1986, the first season of blue turf, saw the first losing campaign (5–6) for the Broncos football program in four decades, winning just one road game and losing the final two home games. He lost all four rivalry games against Idaho and resigned following the season.[21] Skip Hall, previously an assistant coach under Don James at Washington, was hired after Setencich's resignation.[22] In Hall's second season in 1988, the Broncos returned to the Division I-AA playoffs, their first appearance since 1981. Hall's best season was in 1990, when Boise State advanced to the national semifinals, falling in a high scoring game against Big Sky rival Nevada, the conference champion whom the Broncos had defeated a month earlier in Boise. Hall lost all six against Idaho; he resigned after six seasons, with a 42–28 (.600) record.[5][22] The Broncos turned to Portland State head coach Pokey Allen to lead the Boise State football team after Hall resigned. In Allen's second season, the Broncos returned to the championship game in 1994.[23] After 26 years in the Big Sky, BSU joined the Big West Conference in 1996 and moved up to Division I-A (now FBS). The Broncos had an interim head coach for part of 1996 as Allen battled cancer.[24] Allen died due to the cancer in December 1996.[24] Head coach Houston Nutt made the step up to NCAA Division I-A the next year when Boise State hired him away from Murray State to take over the program.[25] Two years after making the Division I-AA finals in 1994, Boise State's first year in Division I-A had been difficult and was looking for a recruiter and motivator to jump start their program following Allen's death. Nutt's team posted a 5–6 record in 1997,[26] playing at the Division I-A level with its Division I-AA players. Nutt's team beat rival Idaho on the road in overtime for the first BSU win in Moscow since 1981. Additionally, Boise State almost pulled off an upset against Wisconsin of the Big Ten. Nutt resigned as head coach after just one season to accept the head football coach position at Arkansas.[27] In three seasons under head coach Dirk Koetter, who previously served as Oregon's offensive coordinator,[28] the Broncos were 26–10, won two Big West championships and moved to the Western Athletic Conference effective in 2001. In his three winning seasons at Boise State, Koetter won ten or more games twice, with two bowl wins. Koetter departed the Broncos after the 2000 season for Arizona State in the Pac-10.[29] Dan Hawkins was promoted from offensive coordinator to head coach on December 2, 2000.[30] In 2004, Hawkins was honored with his second Western Athletic Conference (WAC) Coach of the Year title in three years. Through the 2005 season, he compiled a 53–11 record as Boise State's head coach, including a 37–3 record in WAC competition with four straight WAC titles. Only Walter Camp, George Washington Woodruff and Bob Pruett had more total wins in their first five years of head coaching. He holds a 31–game WAC winning streak, the longest in conference history.[31] One of his first hires at Boise State was Chris Petersen as his offensive coordinator; Petersen was a quarterback at UC Davis while Hawkins was an assistant coach, and was the wide receivers coach at Oregon under head coach Mike Bellotti. After five seasons at the helm of the Broncos football program, Hawkins left for Colorado of the Big 12 Conference.[32] He had three top 25 finishes, won ten or more games three times, and won two bowl games. Following Hawkins' departure, offensive coordinator Chris Petersen was promoted to head coach.[33] At Boise State, Petersen won two Paul \"Bear\" Bryant National Coach of the Year Awards, voted on by the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association.[34] He is the first coach to receive this award twice, which debuted in 1986 (it has since been awarded twice to Nick Saban and three times to Dabo Swinney). Under Petersen, Boise State recorded two undefeated seasons, three undefeated regular seasons, and reached the Bowl Championship Series twice. The 2006 season was capped with a memorable upset of Oklahoma in the Fiesta Bowl, while the 2009 team defeated TCU in the Fiesta Bowl to finish at 14–0 and were fourth in both major polls. They were just the second team ever to go 14–0 in the history of major college football. Petersen brought Boise State football its highest ranking during the 2010 season. The team rose to second in the Associated Press poll during weeks 7, 8, and 9, and No. 2 in the Coaches' Poll, as well as earning the No. 3 slot in the first BCS ranking.[35] After 2010, Boise State joined the Mountain West Conference.[36] In May 2011, Boise State Athletics was cited by the NCAA for \"lack of institutional control,\" for one major violation in women's tennis and several minor violations in four sports, including football. While the football program's violations were minor (student athletes provided fellow recruits with meals and beds while visiting campus), the football program suffered serious penalties nonetheless.[37] The Boise State football program was given three years' probation, lost three scholarships a year, and had its number of Fall practices reduced.[38] As a result of the NCAA violations, Gene Bleymaier, the athletic director who brought blue turf to Boise State in 1986 and promoted Petersen 20 years later, was asked to resign, and ultimately fired when he refused.[39] Despite President Bob Kustra's firing of Bleymaier, boosters continued to support him. Just two years later, the new football facility was named in his honor.[40] Between 2008 and 2011, the Broncos went 50–3 to become the first FBS team to win 50 games over a four-year span. With the 50–3 record, quarterback Kellen Moore became the winningest quarterback in FBS history, passing former Texas quarterback Colt McCoy (45 wins). On December 7, 2011, it was announced that the Broncos would join the Big East Conference as football-only members in July 2013, in a division with Memphis, SMU, Houston, San Diego State, and Temple.[41] However, the following year Boise State announced they had decided to stay in the Mountain West Conference, leaving the Big East without ever playing a game in the conference. Petersen accepted the head coaching position at the University of Washington of the Pac-12 Conference on December 6, 2013.[42] The vacancy was created when the Huskies' Steve Sarkisian left to take the head coaching position at USC.[43][44] Petersen finished his eight seasons as head coach of Boise State with a record of 92–12 (.885), with three top 10 finishes, seven seasons with ten or more wins, six top 25 finishes, two Fiesta Bowl titles, five bowl wins, and five conference titles. He was at BSU for a total of 13 years, the first five as offensive coordinator under Hawkins.[45] Assistant head coach Bob Gregory was named interim head coach for Boise State's bowl game.[46] On December 11, 2013, Arkansas State head coach Bryan Harsin returned to his alma mater as Petersen's replacement.[47] Harsin had been an assistant for the Broncos under Petersen and was co-offensive coordinator at Texas under Mack Brown.[47] In his first season in 2014, they went 10–2 in the regular season and won the Mountain West Championship Game, defeating Fresno State 28–14. This was Boise State's first outright Mountain West Conference championship. The Broncos faced the Arizona Wildcats in the Fiesta Bowl and won 38–30 for a 12–2 record and were ranked 15th in both major polls. Boise State shared the Mountain division title in 2016, going 10–3 with wins over Washington State and Oregon State. BSU was 11–3 in 2017 and won their second Mountain west conference championship under Harsin with a 17–14 win over Fresno State in the Mountain West Championship Game. Boise State capped the season with a Las Vegas Bowl win over Oregon and climbed to 22nd in both final polls. In 2018, Boise State was 10–3 overall; they won the Mountain Division championship and beat three teams that won ten or more games (Troy, Utah State, and Fresno State) and were ranked in both final polls. In 2019 Boise State went 12–2 won the opener at Florida State went 8–0 in the Mountain West conference play for the first time in the regular season, won the Mountain Division and won the conference championship 31–10 vs Hawaii and finished ranked in both final polls. Under Harsin, Boise State is 69–19 (.784) through 2020, with at least nine wins per year, a 3–2 record in bowl games, 1 Fiesta Bowl title, Have been ranked in the top 25 in the polls at some point in every season, won three conference titles, five division titles, and have been in the AP final poll four times. On December 22, 2020, Harsin resigned to become the head coach at Auburn.[48] He finished at Boise State with a seven-year record of 69–19. On January 8, 2021, Boise State hired Oregon defensive coordinator Andy Avalos as their new head coach.[49] Avalos, a former player and assistant coach for the Broncos, signed a five-year contract worth $7.75 million.[50] Being on the verge of the team's first losing season since 1997, it was announced on November 12, 2023 that Avalos was being let go.[51] The remainder of his contract would be bought out, an amount near $3 million.[52] He led the Broncos to a 2022 Mountain West Championship Game (L 28–16 to Fresno State) and the 2022 Frisco Bowl, where the Broncos defeated North Texas 35-32. Avalos ended his career as head coach with a record of 22–14 in three seasons. On December 11, 2023, Avalos was hired as defensive coordinator by Texas Christian. [53] After Andy Avalos was let go with two games remaining in the 2023 regular season, Defensive Coordinator Spencer Danielson was announced as the interim head coach for the remainder of the season. Danielson was elevated to full-time head coach after winning the next three games, including the MWC Championship Game at UNLV. Danielson's first game as full-time head coach was against UCLA in the LA Bowl. The Broncos lost 22-35 and finished the season 8-6, with Danielson finishing with a record of 3-1. Head coaching records since Boise State became a four-year school in 1968. NAIA (1968–69), NCAA Division II (1970–77), Division I-AA (1978–95), Division I-A/FBS (1996–present) In 1980, The Big Sky Conference introduced overtime for all their games. This eventually set a precedent which lead to the elimination of all tied contests across the league by 1996. Boise State claims two national titles in the Junior College Division and at the NCAA Division I FCS. § – Conference co–champions † – Division co–champions, did not play in MW Championship Game. Prior to the 2023 season, the Mountain West did away with divisions and established the two top teams with the best in-conference record would play each other for the conference championship. Since joining the Mountain West, Boise State has won five conference championships, which started with the 2012 team, who went 7–1 to tie with Fresno State and San Diego State. The Mountain West held their first Championship Game the following year; Boise State has reached the Championship Game eight times and won five, with each the most among all schools in the conference. The Broncos have appeared in 22 official D-I-A bowl games with a record of 13–8, including two wins in BCS bowl games and one win in a New Year's Six bowl. They also appears in the Division II 1973 Pioneer Bowl, 1971 Camellia Bowl and 1980 Camellia Bowl. Their appearance in the 2018 First Responder Bowl was ruled a no contest after being canceled due to inclement weather. On December 5, 2021, Boise State received a bid to play Central Michigan in the Arizona Bowl. However, On December 27, 2021, Barstool Sports (the title sponsor of the bowl) founder David Portnoy announced the withdrawal of the Broncos from the bowl due to COVID-19 issues within the program. Through the 2024 season, Boise State has a streak of 27 straight seasons of bowl eligibility, which is the longest active streak in the country.[54] † CFP/New Year's Six/BCS game The Broncos were members of Division I-AA for eighteen seasons, from its inception in 1978 through 1995. They appeared in the I-AA playoffs five times with a record of 8–4, and were I-AA national champions in 1980. The Broncos appeared in the Division II playoffs three times, with an overall record of 1–3; all three losses were to the eventual national champions. In 1977, Boise State (9–2) was undefeated in the Big Sky (6–0) and won another title. Due their regular season not ending until November 26 at Idaho, the same day as the first round of the Division II playoffs, BSU was replaced by runner-up Northern Arizona, who lost 35–0 at home. The Broncos had one appearance in the NCAA College Division postseason, with a victory in the West regional final in the Camellia Bowl in 1971.[55] No semifinals or finals were played in the College Division from 1964 through 1972, a poll followed the four quarterfinals. Since 1970, Boise State has played its home games in Albertsons Stadium (known as Bronco Stadium until May 2014), which enjoys a reputation as one of the most difficult places in the country for opposing teams to play. The stadium is well known for its blue artificial surface, first installed in 1986, making it the first college stadium field to be any color other than traditional green, as well as the only college to have a non-green field for 22 years (1986–2008). \"The Blue,\" as it is called by fans, is one of the most distinguishing and enduring symbols of Boise State football. Boise State holds a trademark on any non-green field, not just blue. Therefore, anyone (high school, college, or otherwise) must apply for a license from Boise State before installing a football field any color other than green. Boise State is one of 7 college football programs in the United States to have a non-green playing surface. Other schools with non-green fields are as follows: (FBS) Eastern Michigan University (gray), Coastal Carolina University (teal), (FCS) Eastern Washington University (red), the University of Central Arkansas (grey and purple), (Division II) the University of New Haven (blue), (NAIA) Lindenwood University (red and grey). Hosei University in Tokyo, Japan also has a blue football field. Boise State recently approved the proposal for a blue field at Luther College (Division III). As of December 7, 2019, the Broncos are 128–9 (.934) at home since the 1999 season. The Broncos won 47 straight home conference games from 1999 to 2011 and were undefeated at home in conference play during their 10 years in the WAC (40–0). The Broncos are 122–7 (.946) in regular season home games since 1999, and had a winning streak of 65 regular season games from 2001 to 2011. Their current home winning streak stands at 0. In 2011, citing a \"competitive advantage,\" the Mountain West Conference banned Boise State from wearing their all-blue uniforms for home conference games as a condition of joining the conference.[56] When questioned about the ban, Mountain West Commissioner Craig Thompson confirmed that either the jerseys or pants could be blue, provided that the other be white or orange.[57] After Boise State decided to not join the Big East Conference and remain in the Mountain West the uniform restrictions were lifted beginning in the 2013 season. The NCAA considered a rule that would have required a team's uniform, either jersey or pants, to contrast the playing surface. The rule would have banned Boise State's all blue uniforms at home and most other teams from wearing all green uniforms as well. The NCAA eventually decided against instituting the rule. In 2012, Boise State granted special permission and an international trademark to Hosei University in Tokyo, Japan, for use of the blue field turf for their football field, Tomahawks Field.[58][59] BSU has had a rivalry with Fresno State University since joining the WAC. The series is 17–9 all time in favor of Boise State. In 2001, the series became a WAC match-up, christened with Boise State's upset over No. 8 Fresno State 35–30. In 2005, the series became the Battle for the Milk Can, and No. 20 Fresno State ended Boise State's 31-game winning streak against WAC opponents with their 27–7 victory. After being played as a non-conference game in 2011, the series continued as a conference game in 2012. The winner of the game receives the Milk Can. Although Fresno State has five all-time wins over Boise State, only two wins have come since they have played each other every year since 2001. In the 2014 season, Boise State played Fresno State twice, winning both times, the second one coming in the Mountain West Championship, which Boise State won for the first time. Fresno State was looking to repeat as champions. They met twice in 2017 in back-to-back weeks as they ended the regular season with a game in Fresno, which Fresno won, before meeting the next week in the Mountain West Championship in Boise, which Boise won. In 2018, Boise State upset No. 16 Fresno State 24–17 to end Fresno's seven game winning streak. Three weeks later, the Bulldogs avenged their regular season loss by defeating Boise State 19–16 in overtime in a snow covered Mountain West Championship Game. The rivalry is no longer an annual affair following the expansion of the MW to 12 football members in 2013. At that time, Boise State and Fresno State were placed in separate football divisions (respectively, Mountain and West). As part of the new scheduling arrangement, all cross-divisional games rotate in a four-year cycle, with two years of play followed by two years off. This in turn means that the game was not played in 2015 or 2016. Boise State had a 40-year in-state rivalry with the University of Idaho, which began with a Bronco victory in the first meeting in 1971. They met every year through 2010, and with the exception of four years (2001–2004), the matchup was a conference game. The rivalry was dominated by streaks as Idaho won 12 straight years from 1982 to 1993, while Boise State won the most recent 12 games between 1999 and 2010, mostly by large margins. BSU leads the rivalry with a series record of 22–17–1 (.563). After Boise State's move to the Mountain West Conference in 2011, Boise State has refused to play Idaho home and home in football. As a response, Idaho has refused to play Boise State at ExtraMile Arena for men's basketball. As of 2021, no future games for football or men's basketball have been scheduled; with Idaho having returned to FCS football in 2018, the football rivalry is unlikely to resume in the foreseeable future. 2024 Boise State has a long-standing rivalry with Nevada. Boise State leads the series 30–13. Boise State and Nevada have been conference rivals in the Big Sky Conference, the Big West Conference, the WAC, and the Mountain West. However, the series is no longer an annual affair after the 2013 expansion, as Nevada was placed in the opposite division from Boise State. They play each other only twice every four years. The last game was in 2018 with the next game coming in 2021. The series was played as a non-conference game in 2011 as the teams met in Boise during Nevada's last year in the WAC. Nevada split the WAC championship with Boise State in 2005 as both teams finished 7–1 in conference play. Boise State beat Nevada in the last game of the season in 2006, giving Boise State a berth into their first BCS bowl. In 2007, in one of the highest scoring games in NCAA Division I football history, Boise State defeated Nevada 69–67 in four overtimes. Recently, the conference championship has been decided by the Wolf Pack and Broncos' late-season games. In 2010, Nevada defeated No. 3 Boise State 34–31 in overtime, ending the Broncos' BCS National Championship hopes. The rivalry between the two schools felt as if it had been rekindled after Nevada's win, since Boise State had won the past 10 games dating back to 1998. Boise State and Nevada have played one time in the postseason in the 1990 I-AA semifinal. Nevada won the game in triple overtime 59–52, and would go on to lose in the final. Announced schedules as of September 10, 2024.[60][61] Previously called the Quarterback of the Year Award, this accolade differs from Sammy Baugh Trophy in that it goes to top quarterback, rather than the top passer. Its name was changed to its current identity in 2012, honoring two-time winner Kellen Moore, who became the FBS all-time leader in wins by a quarterback after going 50–3 as the starter at Boise State.",

The Hall of Fame is not only home to the history of Boise State’s successful athletes and teams, it is the only public entrance to view the home of Boise State football and the famous blue turf.* Boise State Football has a long history of success starting with the Junior College days and the National Championship team of 1958, coached by the father of Bronco Football, Lyle Smith. Now named Lyle Smith Field in Albertsons Stadium, the turf field was actually the typical, non-interesting green before getting its proud moniker after the 1985 season. Installed in the summer of 1986, THE BLUE was the idea of Athletic Director Gene Bleymaeir and was the first non-green, artificial football field in the country. What outsiders initially considered a gimmick, calling it “Smurf Turf’ after the popular, amiable and blue cartoon characters, THE BLUE soon became nationally associated with Boise State as a symbol for the football program’s blue-collar work ethic. Opponents don’t find it so friendly either. With the closing of the 2018 season, Boise State football holds a home record of 182-39 (14 Conference Championships) since THE BLUE was installed prior to the 1986 season. The program has lost only nine times on its home field since the start of the 1999 season. You can view the turf by entering through the Allen Noble Hall of Fame in Southwest corner of Albertsons Stadium. Visit THE BLUE, one of the most visited sites in Idaho, and take a photo from the view of our Hall of Fame patio, one of the most popular selfie spots in the state, while learning more about the history of Boise State Athletics. You can see THE BLUE Monday through Friday from 10 am – 4 pm.* Metered Parking available in the west lot in front of the Bronco Shop.

                "content": "Travis Michael Kelce (/ˈkɛlsi/ ⓘ KEL-see;[a] born October 5, 1989) is an American professional football tight end for the Kansas City Chiefs of the National Football League (NFL). He was selected by the Chiefs in the third round of the 2013 NFL draft and later won Super Bowls LIV, LVII, and LVIII with the team. He played college football for the University of Cincinnati Bearcats football program. Considered one of the greatest tight ends of all time,[11][12] Kelce is a nine-time Pro Bowler and a seven-time All-Pro, with four first-team and three second-team selections.

                "content": "Editions: En/nfl/kansas-city-chiefs Missed last two Chiefs road games Despite Taylor Swift's absence from Travis Kelce's last two NFL games, the couple is reportedly doing just fine. Kelce has never expected Swift to be present for every game, and an old interview from 2016 has resurfaced to support this, revealing that he's comfortable with his partner not attending all his matches. In the interview, Kelce was promoting his reality show \"Catching Kelce,\" where he eventually met his ex, Maya Benberry. During the conversation, he shared that while having a supportive partner is important to him, he doesn't expect them to attend every single game, as long as they cheer him on when they do make it to the stands. \"If you're dating a professional athlete, I do not believe, at least for me, that you have to go to all the games,\" Kelce said. \"I mean, there's 8 home games, 8 away games, plus playoffs. I don't even expect my parents and my friends to make every single game.\" This was back when the NFL played a 16-game schedule. Now, there's an added game. \"I need her to cheer when we're doing awesome, just to make sure that that look is being presented to everyone.\" Swift attended Kelce's first two home games of the season in Kansas City but was not present for the Chiefs' recent away games in Atlanta and Los Angeles. Despite her absence, TMZ sources close to the couple confirm that their relationship is still going strong, with no signs of tension over her decision to miss a few matchups. \"If she is going to a place that isn't Arrowhead, there are security concerns,\" a Page Six source said. \"She has worked with Arrowhead so many times, they feel at ease and comfortable. Going to all kinds of different stadiums, you need to send a team in advance.\" © Unidad Editorial Información Deportiva, S.L.U. All rights reserved. Follow us",

                "content": "Russell Carrington Wilson (born November 29, 1988) is an American professional football quarterback for the Pittsburgh Steelers of the National Football League (NFL). He previously played 10 seasons for the Seattle Seahawks and two seasons for the Denver Broncos. With the Seahawks, Wilson was named to the Pro Bowl nine times and helped Seattle win their first Super Bowl championship in Super Bowl XLVIII. He is regarded as one of the greatest dual-threat quarterbacks of all time.[1] Wilson played college football and baseball for the NC State Wolfpack from 2008 to 2010 before transferring to the Wisconsin Badgers in 2011, where he set the single-season FBS record for passer rating and led them to a Big Ten title and the 2012 Rose Bowl. He also played minor league baseball for the Tri-City Dust Devils in 2010 and the Asheville Tourists in 2011 as a second baseman. The Seattle Seahawks selected Wilson in the third round (75th overall) of the 2012 NFL draft. He tied the rookie record for most passing touchdowns and was named Pepsi NFL Rookie of the Year.[2] Wilson then led the Seahawks to consecutive Super Bowl appearances, winning Super Bowl XLVIII and losing Super Bowl XLIX after Wilson was intercepted at the goal line by Malcolm Butler. Wilson holds the record for most wins by an NFL quarterback through nine seasons and is one of five quarterbacks with a career passer rating over 100.[3] In 2019, he signed a four-year, $140 million contract extension with the Seahawks, becoming the highest-paid NFL player at the time. In 2020, he became the third quarterback in NFL history to throw 30 touchdowns in four consecutive seasons.[4] Wilson was traded to the Broncos in 2022 and later signed a five-year, $245 million extension. His time with the Broncos was marred with disappointment, with the Broncos having the league's worst scoring offense in 2022. Wilson was benched near the end of the 2023 season and was released in the offseason, later signing a one-year deal with the Steelers. Noted for his philanthropy, Wilson was named the Walter Payton Man of the Year in 2020 and was the recipient of the Bart Starr Award in 2022. Wilson is also part owner of the Seattle Sounders FC of Major League Soccer (MLS). After he purchased his minority stake, the Sounders won the 2019 MLS Cup. Wilson was born at The Christ Hospital in Cincinnati,[5] and grew up in Richmond, Virginia. His parents are Harrison Benjamin Wilson III, a lawyer, and Tammy Wilson (née Turner), a nurse director.[6][7][8] He has an older brother, Harrison IV, and a younger sister, Anna.[9] Wilson started playing football with his father and brother at the age of four, and played his first organized game for the Tuckahoe Tomahawks youth football team in sixth grade.[6][10] Wilson's great-great-grandfather was enslaved to a Confederate colonel and was freed after the American Civil War.[11] Wilson's paternal grandfather, Harrison B. Wilson Jr., was a former president of Norfolk State University who played football and basketball at Kentucky State University, and his paternal grandmother, Anna W. Wilson, was on the faculty at Jackson State University.[12] Wilson's maternal grandfather was noted painter A. B. Jackson.[13] According to genetic admixture analysis, Wilson is 62% African, 36% European, 1% West Asian, and 1% Central Asian.[14][15][16] His European family lineage has been traced back to 524 A.D. to Saint Arnulf of Metz via Charlemagne.[17][18][19][20][21] Wilson has also said he has some Native American ancestry, although he did not explicitly say which tribe he came from.[22][23] Wilson's father played football and baseball at Dartmouth and was a wide receiver for the San Diego Chargers preseason squad in 1980. Wilson's brother, Harry, played football and baseball at the University of Richmond, and his sister Anna played basketball at Stanford.[24][25][26][27][28] Wilson's father died of complications from diabetes on June 9, 2010, at age 55,[24] the day after Wilson was drafted by the Rockies.[29] Wilson attended Collegiate School, a preparatory school in Richmond, Virginia.[30] As a junior in 2005, he threw for 3,287 passing yards and 40 passing touchdowns and rushed for 634 rushing yards and 15 rushing touchdowns.[31] He was named an all-district, all-region, and all-state player. Wilson was twice named the Richmond Times-Dispatch Player of the Year.[32] As a senior, he threw for 3,009 passing yards, 34 passing touchdowns, and seven interceptions. In addition, he rushed for 1,132 yards and 18 touchdowns.[33] That year, he was named an all-conference and all-state player as well as conference player of the year. He was featured in Sports Illustrated for his performance in the state championship game win. Wilson also served as his senior class president.[34] During his time in high school, Wilson attended the Manning Passing Academy, a summer football clinic run by multiple NFL MVP winner and eventual Hall of Fame quarterback Peyton Manning. Due to this encounter, Manning recognized Wilson many years later when the latter had flown to Denver to discuss the prospect of getting drafted by the Denver Broncos, where Manning had recently signed.[35] Wilson was also a member of the Collegiate School basketball and baseball teams.[36] Sources: Wilson committed to North Carolina State University on July 23, 2006.[37] He also received a football scholarship offer from Duke University.[38] Wilson redshirted during the 2007 season at NC State.[39] In 2008, Wilson initially split time at quarterback with senior Daniel Evans and junior Harrison Beck.[40] However, Evans and Beck saw no regular season action after Week 2 and Week 5, respectively. Thereafter, Wilson led the team to a 4–3 record in the regular season which NC State finished out on a four-game winning streak.[41] During a 30–24 win over East Carolina, Wilson threw for 201 yards and three touchdowns.[42] He threw for two touchdowns in each of the last six games in the regular season.[43] In the 2008 PapaJohns.com Bowl against Rutgers, Wilson threw for 186 yards and a touchdown and rushed for 46 yards before halftime. Late in the first half, he scrambled to the Rutgers' four-yard line, where he was tackled and suffered a knee sprain. With Wilson sitting out the remainder of the game, his replacements threw a combined total of three interceptions with NC State, eventually losing 29–23.[44][40] Over the course of the season, he completed 150 of 275 attempts for 1,955 yards and 17 touchdowns with just one interception. He also recorded 116 carries for 394 yards and four touchdowns.[43] The Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) named him the first-team All-ACC quarterback. It was the first time in conference history that a freshman quarterback was named to the first team.[45] Prior to the 2009 season, Wilson was named quarterback of the pre-season all-ACC football team on July 12. On September 19, Wilson broke Andre Woodson's all-time NCAA record of 325 consecutive pass attempts without an interception against Gardner–Webb.[46] The 379-pass streak ended in a game against Wake Forest on October 3.[47] Wilson held the record until November 10, 2012, when it was broken by Louisiana Tech quarterback Colby Cameron.[48] Wilson was named honorable mention All-ACC in 2009.[49] Wilson finished the 2009 regular season with 3,027 passing yards, 31 touchdowns, and 11 interceptions as the team finished with a 5–7 record.[50][51] Wilson led the 2010 Wolfpack to a 9–4 season that included a 23–7 win over West Virginia in the 2010 Champs Sports Bowl.[52][53] He led the ACC in passing yards per game (274.1) and total offensive yards per game (307.5).[54] He was named second-team All-ACC and runner-up for ACC Football Player of the Year.[49] In May 2010, Wilson graduated from NC State in three years with a BA in communication, and took graduate-level business courses in the fall semester during the 2010 football season.[55][56][57][58][59] In January 2011, Wilson announced that he would report to spring training with the Colorado Rockies organization.[60] NC State head coach Tom O'Brien expressed reservations with Wilson's decision, saying \"Russell and I have had very open conversations about his responsibilities respective to baseball and football. While I am certainly respectful of Russell's dedication to baseball these last several years, within those discussions I also communicated to him the importance of his time commitment to NC State football.\"[61] O'Brien and his staff reached out to NFL coaches and general managers on Wilson's behalf, but he failed to receive an invitation to the 2011 NFL Scouting Combine.[62] On April 29, 2011, O'Brien announced that Wilson was granted a release from his football scholarship with one year of eligibility left.[63] On June 27, 2011, Wisconsin head coach Bret Bielema said that Wilson committed to Wisconsin for the 2011 season.[64] In the season opener against UNLV, Wilson passed for 255 yards and two touchdowns in a 51–17 victory. He also rushed for 62 yards, including a 46-yard touchdown run.[65] In the next three games, Wilson threw for three passing touchdowns in each game, victories over Oregon State, Northern Illinois, and South Dakota.[66][67][68] Following a 48–17 victory over previously undefeated #8 Nebraska, Wilson recorded a receiving touchdown in the 59–7 victory over Indiana.[69][70] Wilson helped lead the Badgers to a 6–0 start and a #4 ranking in the AP Poll.[71] The Badgers dropped their next two games, road losses to Michigan State and Ohio State.[72][73] Wilson and the Badgers reeled off four consecutive wins to end the regular season. Wilson was efficient during the winning streak, passing for nine touchdowns to no interceptions while rushing for two touchdowns.[74] At the end of the regular season, Wilson was named first team All-Big Ten by both the coaches and media. He also won the Griese-Brees Big Ten Quarterback of the Year award.[75] In the inaugural Big Ten Championship Game on December 3, Wilson threw for three touchdowns and led the Badgers to a 42–39 win over the Michigan State Spartans. Wilson was named the game's Grange-Griffin MVP.[76] In December 2011, Wilson was named a third team All-American by Yahoo!

That might be the reason he's not picked in the first couple rounds.\"[87] Wilson was selected by the Seattle Seahawks in the third round (75th overall) of the 2012 NFL Draft,[91] the sixth quarterback selected.[92] The Seahawks received significant criticism for their selections in the draft, and Wilson in particular, as they had just signed free agent Matt Flynn.[93] Two weeks later, Wilson signed a four-year, $2.99 million contract with the Seahawks on May 7, 2012.[94] Wilson made his preseason debut against the Tennessee Titans on August 11, 2012, and had his first preseason start on August 24 against the Kansas City Chiefs.[95][96] Two days later on August 26, 2012, Wilson was named the starting quarterback for the first regular season game after competing with Matt Flynn and Tarvaris Jackson for the position.[97] On September 9, 2012, Wilson made his regular season debut in a 20–16 road loss to the Arizona Cardinals.

Wilson's scrambling mobility and ability to extend plays outside the pocket with his legs earned numerous comparisons to Hall of Fame quarterback Fran Tarkenton.[108][109][110] Wilson led the Seahawks to the postseason in his rookie year, with both games on the road in January. He made his postseason debut in the NFC Wild Card Round against the Washington Redskins, passing for 187 yards and rushing for 67 yards as the Seahawks rallied for a 24–14 comeback victory.[111] In the Divisional Round against the Atlanta Falcons, Wilson threw for 385 yards and rushed for 60 yards, and his team had a 28–27 lead with 31 seconds to go, but the Falcons managed to kick the winning field goal.[112] Wilson was selected as an alternate for the 2013 Pro Bowl, filling in for Matt Ryan of Atlanta.[113] At the Pro Bowl in Hawaii on January 27, Wilson completed eight of ten passes for 98 yards, three touchdowns, and no interceptions for a 147.1 rating.[114] At the end of the season, Wilson earned a bonus of $222,000 through the NFL's Performance-Based Pay program.[115][116] He was ranked 51st by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2013.[117] The Seahawks began the 2013 season with the first 4–0 start in franchise history, before losing to the Indianapolis Colts in Week 5.[118] The Seahawks then went on a 7-game winning streak, including a 41–20 victory over the Minnesota Vikings where he posted a career-high 151.4 passer rating and culminating in a 34–7 victory over the New Orleans Saints in Week 13 in which Wilson threw three touchdown passes and earned his second NFC Offensive Player of the Week award.[119][120][121] Over the next three weeks, the Seahawks suffered divisional losses to the San Francisco 49ers and Arizona Cardinals (the loss to the Cardinals was Wilson's first home loss), but defeated the St. Louis Rams in Week 17 to finish the season with a 13–3 record, the NFC West title, and the No. 1 seed in the playoffs.[122] Wilson finished the season with 26 touchdown passes, nine interceptions, and a 101.2 passer rating, becoming the first quarterback in the Super Bowl era to post a 100+ passer rating in each of his first two seasons.[123] Wilson was named to his second Pro Bowl on December 27, 2013.[124] In the Divisional Round, the Seahawks defeated the New Orleans Saints by a score of 23–15.

The Cardinals had the third-best scoring defense heading into Week 16. The Seahawks won 35–6 as they snapped the Cardinals' seven-game home winning streak and regained first place in the NFC West as well as the NFC's #1 seed. The Seahawks defeated the St. Louis Rams 20–6 in Week 17 to clinch the NFC West and the #1 seed for the second consecutive season, securing homefield advantage for the entirety of the NFC playoffs.[136][137] Wilson led the Seahawks to a 31–17 home win over the Carolina Panthers in the Divisional Round, making the Seahawks the first defending Super Bowl Champion to win a playoff game since the 2005 Patriots.[138] The Seahawks hosted the Green Bay Packers in their second consecutive NFC Championship. Wilson threw three first-half interceptions while completing only two passes to his own team as the Seahawks fell behind 16–0 at halftime. With the Packers leading 19–7 and five minutes remaining in the fourth quarter, Wilson threw his fourth interception. Then Wilson led the Seahawks on an improbable comeback. On the Seahawks' next drive, Wilson ran the ball in for a touchdown to cut the deficit to 19–14. After a successful onside kick recovery, Wilson led the Seahawks down the field, and Lynch scored to give the Seahawks a 20–19 lead.

The Seahawks won the coin toss, and the offense took the field. Wilson led the Seahawks on an 80-yard drive that was capped by a 35-yard game-winning touchdown pass to Kearse.[139] The Seahawks completed their largest postseason comeback in franchise history and clinched a Super Bowl berth.[140] Wilson would have been selected as an alternate to the Pro Bowl, but did not play because the Seahawks advanced to the Super Bowl; as Wilson did not have a chance to decline the invitation, the NFL recognizes this as a Pro Bowl berth for him.[141] Wilson became the first quarterback in NFL history to start two Super Bowls in his first three professional seasons.[142] The Seahawks became the first defending champion to return to the Super Bowl since the 2004 Patriots.[143] They faced the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLIX, where they were defeated by a final score of 28–24. Although the Seahawks led 24–14 heading into the fourth quarter, the Patriots scored two consecutive touchdowns to take a four-point lead with 2:02 remaining.

Over the next five games, Wilson threw 19 touchdowns and no interceptions, becoming the only quarterback in NFL history to throw 3+ touchdown passes and no interceptions in five consecutive games.[148] After a 2–4 start to the season, Wilson led the Seahawks to win seven of their next eight games and clinch a fourth consecutive playoff appearance in their Week 15 win over the Cleveland Browns.[149][150] His strong performance over the second half of the season, even after losing star running back Marshawn Lynch and tight end Jimmy Graham, led many analysts to consider Wilson an MVP candidate.[151] Wilson broke numerous Seahawks single season passing records in 2015, including most passing yards (4,024), most passing touchdowns (34), and highest passer rating (110.1).[152] He became the first Seahawks quarterback to throw for over 4,000 yards in a season, and finished the year with the highest passer rating in the NFL.[153][154] Wilson's 51.7% deep ball completion percentage was the highest among NFL quarterbacks.[155] On December 22, 2015, Wilson was named to his third Pro Bowl.[156] He was ranked 17th on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2016.[157] The Seahawks traveled to Minnesota to face the Minnesota Vikings in the Wild Card Round. The temperature at kickoff was −6 °F (−25 °F wind chill), making it the third coldest game in NFL history.[158] Wilson struggled in the sub-zero temperatures, throwing for 142 yards, one touchdown, and one interception. The Vikings missed a short field goal in the last minute, allowing the Seahawks to advance to the Divisional Round to face the 15–1 Carolina Panthers.[159] Down 31–0 at the half, Wilson helped lead a furious comeback attempt, but the Panthers won 31–24, denying Wilson and the Seahawks their third consecutive in the NFC Championship and a shot at a third consecutive Super Bowl appearance. In that game, Wilson threw for 366 yards, three touchdowns, and two interceptions.[160] Wilson was drafted first overall by Team Irvin in the 2016 Pro Bowl draft,[161] and in the game threw eight completions on 12 attempts for 164 yards, three touchdowns, and no interceptions for a 149.3 rating.[162] He was named the Pro Bowl offensive MVP.[163] The Seahawks had a solid 2016 season with Wilson at the helm. However, Wilson drew two minor injuries: his ankle during Week 1 against the Miami Dolphins after getting stepped on by defensive lineman Ndamukong Suh,[164] and his left knee against the 49ers during Week 3 after a takedown by linebacker Eli Harold.[165] The injuries hampered Wilson's trademark mobility, and many speculated that he would be rested in order to properly recover.[166] Regardless, Wilson started all 16 games in the season. On November 20, against the Philadelphia Eagles, he had a 15-yard touchdown reception on a pass from Doug Baldwin on a trick play.[167] Wilson also played the worst game of his career in 2016, throwing 5 interceptions in a 38–10 loss to the Green Bay Packers during Week 14. The team finished with a 10–5–1 record and won the NFC West.[168] Wilson put together a season where he recorded a career-high 4,219 passing yards, 21 passing touchdowns, 259 rushing yards, and one rushing touchdown.[169] The Seahawks made the playoffs, where they defeated the Detroit Lions in the Wild Card Round.[170] The win gave Wilson his eighth playoff victory.[171] However, they fell 20–36 to the eventual NFC champion Atlanta Falcons in the Divisional Round at the Georgia Dome.[172] He was ranked 24th by his peers on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2017.[173] On September 5, 2017, Wilson was voted Seahawks offensive captain for the fifth consecutive season.[174] In Week 3, in a 33–27 loss to the Tennessee Titans, he was 29 of 49 for 373 passing yards and four passing touchdowns.[175] In Week 8 against the Houston Texans, Wilson posted an astounding performance, going 26 of 41 for a career-high 452 passing yards and four touchdowns in a matchup where both he and Deshaun Watson each threw over 400 yards.

D. McKissic, the third of his game, Wilson tied Eli Manning in 2011 for the most fourth quarter touchdowns in a single season with 15.[180] He went 20 for 31 for 227 yards and three touchdowns in that game, earning him NFC Offensive Player of the Week.[181] On December 19, 2017, Wilson was named to his fourth Pro Bowl.[182] The Seahawks ended the season with a 9–7 record, ending Wilson's streak of five consecutive seasons with double-digit wins and a playoff appearance.

Wilson out-dueled the season's eventual MVP Patrick Mahomes to lead the team to a 38–31 victory.

Although they have already secured their spot in the playoffs, a win would grant them the AFC North title. However, after the latest loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, experts don’t believe in Mike Tomlin’s team, and they are considered heavy underdogs. The Ravens are currently six-point favorites. Therefore, if the Steelers want to prove they are true Super Bowl contenders, it’s time to show it with a victory against their most hated rival. Wilson sent a message to all his teammates to make that happen. The Steelers have already clinched a playoff spot, but their next goal is the divisional title to secure at least one home game in the Wild Card round. Russell Wilson knows his team can bounce back after the setback in Philadelphia. “I think the most important is we got to focus on now. We don’t have time to even think about last week. I think the most important thing coming out of it though is that we’ve got to get ourselves the best chance to win. When we put ourselves in good situations, go and capitalize on them. We’re going to have to play our best football. It’s going to be a great game.” see also NFL News: Lamar Jackson sends clear message to Mike Tomlin and Steelers about struggles against Pittsburgh The last Super Bowl the Pittsburgh Steelers won was on February 1, 2009, when they defeated Kurt Warner and the Arizona Cardinals with a score of 27-23 in Tampa. The first step to boost their chances this season is to get that victory at Baltimore. With all his experience, Russell Wilson knows this type of games need a different approach. A big warning of what’s ahead. see also NFL News: Mike Tomlin makes something clear to referees after many controversial calls against Steelers “First of all, we got to be able to calm the nerves early and the excitement. We have to be able to play and think clearly, efficiently and effectively. But yet play with an edge. I think that’s really important. We’ve got to do the fundamental things. This is a playoff a matchup. There’s going to be highs and there’s going to be lows. We just have to stay neutral. It’s a four quarter game for a reason. We’re going to battle our way through it.” Miguel Angel Fernandez Castro is a sports writer and analyst at Bolavip US, specializing in NFL, MLB, NBA, College Football, Soccer, Tennis, and Golf.

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. The Kansas City Chiefs find themselves AFC West champions and atop the AFC at 12-1 on the season entering Week 15. As they gear up for the final four weeks of the regular season, they could soon get a boost on offense. On Friday, the team is opening the practice window for wide receiver Marquise \"Hollywood\" Brown, according to the MMQB. This comes after NFL Media reported that Brown had received final clearance to begin practicing, which paves the way for the wideout to play before the end of the regular season. With the practice window open, the Chiefs will have 21 days to move Brown onto the active roster, or he'll revert to injured reserve for the remainder of the season. Brown has been on injured reserve throughout the regular season after dislocating the sternoclavicular joint in his shoulder. The injury occurred on the opening drive of Kansas City's preseason opener this summer as Brown hauled in an 11-yard reception on the play he was injured. As the NFL Media report noted, Brown was in Colorado on Thursday, meeting with his surgeon, and received positive news. These latest updates jive with what CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan Jones reported in late November. At the time, Jones relayed that it's possible Brown could be back on the field in time for Kansas City's Christmas Day matchup against the Pittsburgh Steelers. \"He's getting close,\" Chiefs coach Andy Reid told reporters of Brown's status on Wednesday, via Chiefs Wire. \"He's chomping at the bit to get back out there, but he's got to visit with the doctor to make sure he gets clearance there.\" Brown, a 2019 first-round pick of the Baltimore Ravens, signed a one-year deal with the Chiefs back in March after spending the previous two seasons with the Arizona Cardinals. At the time he signed on, the 27-year-old was expected to give the defending Super Bowl champions a speedy deep threat to help stretch the offense. While they didn't get that for most of the regular season, Brown could help jolt the offense as they look to make another deep run this postseason. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

                "content": "Editions: En/nfl/kansas-city-chiefs The team's doctors have cleared the star receiver to return to practice. Marquise \"Hollywood\" Brown is poised for a dramatic comeback. After nearly four months recovering from a shoulder injury, the star receiver is reportedly ready to return just as Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs prepare for a crucial stretch in the season. The Chiefs, while maintaining an impressive record, have faced challenges this season, particularly with injuries to key players like Brown, running back Isiah Pacheco, and receiver Rashee Rice. Their absence has tested the depth of Kansas City's offense. Fortunately, the tides are turning. Pacheco has already returned to action, and now all eyes are on Brown, whose imminent comeback could reinvigorate the Chiefs' aerial attack and bolster their confidence ahead of the playoffs. Related: The Chiefs announced that their medical staff cleared Brown to return to practice on Monday. He has been designated to come off injured reserve and was listed as a limited participant in Friday's session. NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported that Brown is expected to complete his recovery by Saturday. While this timeline ruled him out for Week 15 against the Cleveland Browns, Rapoport confirmed that Brown should make his on-field return in Week 16 against the Houston Texans. Brown signed a one-year, $7 million deal in the offseason to strengthen the Chiefs' receiving corps, which had leaned heavily on veteran tight end Travis Kelce in 2023. His return comes at a pivotal moment as Kansas City eyes postseason dominance. The Chiefs face a challenging close to their regular season. In Week 16, they host the Texans, leaders of the AFC South. Week 17 takes them to Pittsburgh to battle the AFC North-leading Steelers, and they close the season against divisional rivals, the Denver Broncos. While Kansas City has already clinched the AFC West, securing the top seed in the AFC-and home-field advantage in the playoffs-is still at stake. Hollywood Brown's return could be the early Christmas miracle the Chiefs need to solidify their path to the Super Bowl. © Unidad Editorial Información Deportiva, S.L.U. All rights reserved.
