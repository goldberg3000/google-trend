                "content": "The UEFA Champions League (abbreviated as UCL) is an annual club association football competition organised by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) that is contested by top-division European clubs. The competition begins with a round robin league phase to qualify for the double-legged knockout rounds, and a single-leg final. It is the most-watched club competition in the world and the third most-watched football competition overall, behind only the UEFA European Championship and the FIFA World Cup. It is one of the most prestigious football tournaments in the world and the most prestigious club competition in European football, played by the national league champions (and, for some nations, one or more runners-up) of their national associations. Introduced in 1955 as the Coupe des Clubs Champions Européens (French for European Champion Clubs' Cup), and commonly known as the European Cup, it was initially a straight knockout tournament open only to the champions of Europe's domestic leagues, with its winner reckoned as the European club champion. The competition took on its current name in 1992, adding a round-robin group stage in 1991 and allowing multiple entrants from certain countries since the 1997–98 season.[1] While only the winners of many of Europe's national leagues can enter the competition, the top 5 leagues by coefficient provide four teams each by default,[2] with a possibility for additional spots based on performance during the previous season.[3][4] Clubs that finish below the qualifying spots are eligible for the second-tier UEFA Europa League competition, and since 2021, for the third-tier UEFA Conference League.[5] In its present format, the Champions League begins in early July with three qualifying rounds and a play-off round, all played over two legs. The seven surviving teams enter the league phase, joining 29 teams qualified in advance. The 36 teams each play eight opponents, four home and four away. The 24 highest-ranked teams proceed to the knockout phase that culminates with the final match in late May or early June.[6] The winner of the Champions League automatically qualifies for the following year's Champions League, the UEFA Super Cup, the FIFA Intercontinental Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup.[7][8] Spanish clubs have the most victories (20 wins), followed by England (15 wins) and Italy (12 wins). England has the most winning teams, with six clubs having won the title. The competition has been won by 23 clubs and 13 of them have won it more than once.[9] Real Madrid is the most successful club in the tournament's history, having won it 15 times. Madrid is the only club to have won it five times in a row (the first five editions).[10] Only one club has won all of their matches in a single tournament en route to the tournament victory: Bayern Munich in the 2019–20 season.[11] Real Madrid is the current European champion, having beaten Borussia Dortmund 2–0 in the 2024 final for their fifteenth title. The first time the champions of two European leagues met was in what was nicknamed the 1895 World Championship, when English champions Sunderland beat Scottish champions Heart of Midlothian 5–3.[12] The first pan-European tournament was the Challenge Cup, a competition between clubs in the Austro-Hungarian Empire.[13] Three years later, in 1900, the champions of Belgium, Netherlands and Switzerland, which were the only existing leagues in continental Europe at the time, participated in the Coupe Van der Straeten Ponthoz, thus being dubbed as the \"club championship of the continent\" by the local newspapers.[14][15] The Mitropa Cup, a competition modelled after the Challenge Cup, was created in 1927, an idea of Austrian Hugo Meisl, and played between Central European clubs.[16] In 1930, the Coupe des Nations (French: Nations Cup), the first attempt to create a cup for national champion clubs of Europe, was played and organised by Swiss club Servette.[17] Held in Geneva, it brought together ten champions from across the continent. The tournament was won by Újpest of Hungary.[17] Latin European nations came together to form the Latin Cup in 1949.[18] After receiving reports from his journalists over the highly successful South American Championship of Champions of 1948, Gabriel Hanot, editor of L'Équipe, began proposing the creation of a continent-wide tournament.[19] In interviews, Jacques Ferran (one of the founders of the European Champions Cup, together with Gabriel Hanot),[20] said that the South American Championship of Champions was the inspiration for the European Champions Cup.[21] After Stan Cullis declared Wolverhampton Wanderers \"Champions of the World\" following a successful run of friendlies in the 1950s, in particular a 3–2 friendly victory against Budapest Honvéd, Hanot finally managed to convince UEFA to put into practice such a tournament.[1] It was conceived in Paris in 1955 as the European Champion Clubs' Cup.[1] The first European Cup took place during the 1955–56 season.[22][23] Sixteen teams participated (some by invitation): AC Milan (Italy), AGF Aarhus (Denmark), Anderlecht (Belgium), Djurgården (Sweden), Gwardia Warszawa (Poland), Hibernian (Scotland), Partizan (Yugoslavia), PSV Eindhoven (Netherlands), Rapid Wien (Austria), Real Madrid (Spain), Rot-Weiss Essen (West Germany), Saarbrücken (Saar), Servette (Switzerland), Sporting CP (Portugal), Reims (France) and Vörös Lobogó (Hungary).[22][23] The first European Cup match took place on 4 September 1955, and ended in a 3–3 draw between Sporting CP and Partizan.[22][23] The first goal in European Cup history was scored by João Baptista Martins of Sporting CP.[22][23] The inaugural final took place at the Parc des Princes between Stade de Reims and Real Madrid on 13 June 1956.[22][23][24] The Spanish squad came back from behind to win 4–3 thanks to goals from Alfredo Di Stéfano and Marquitos, as well as two goals from Héctor Rial.[22][23][24] Real Madrid successfully defended the trophy next season in their home stadium, the Santiago Bernabéu, against Fiorentina.[25][26] After a scoreless first half, Real Madrid scored twice in six minutes to defeat the Italians.[24][25][26] In 1958, Milan failed to capitalise after going ahead on the scoreline twice, only for Real Madrid to equalise.[27][28] The final, held in Heysel Stadium, went to extra time where Francisco Gento scored the game-winning goal to allow Real Madrid to retain the title for the third consecutive season.[24][27][28] In a rematch of the first final, Real Madrid faced Stade Reims at the Neckarstadion for the 1959 final, and won 2–0.[24][29][30] West German side Eintracht Frankfurt became the first team not to compete in the Latin cup to reach the European Cup final.[18][31][32] The 1960 final holds the record for the most goals scored, with Real Madrid beating Eintracht Frankfurt 7–3 at Hampden Park, courtesy of four goals by Ferenc Puskás and a hat-trick by Alfredo Di Stéfano.[24][31][32] This was Real Madrid's fifth consecutive title, a record that still stands today.[9] Real Madrid's reign ended in the 1960–61 season when bitter rivals Barcelona dethroned them in the first round.[33][34] Barcelona were defeated in the final by Portuguese side Benfica 3–2 at the Wankdorf Stadium.[33][34][35] Reinforced by Eusébio, Benfica defeated Real Madrid 5–3 at the Olympic Stadium in Amsterdam and kept the title for a second consecutive season.[35][36][37] Benfica wanted to repeat Real Madrid's successful run of the 1950s after reaching the showpiece event of the 1962–63 European Cup, but a brace from Brazilian-Italian José Altafini at Wembley gave the spoils to Milan, making the trophy leave the Iberian Peninsula for the first time ever.[38][39][40] Inter Milan beat an ageing Real Madrid 3–1 at the Ernst-Happel-Stadion to win the 1963–64 season and replicate their local-rival's success.[41][42][43] The title stayed in Milan for the third year in a row after Inter beat Benfica 1–0 at their home ground, the San Siro.[44][45][46] Under the leadership of Jock Stein, Scottish club Celtic beat Inter Milan 2–1 in the 1967 final to become the first British club to win the European Cup.[47][48] The Celtic players that day, all of whom were born within 30 miles (48 km) of Glasgow, subsequently became known as the \"Lisbon Lions\".[49] The 1967–68 season saw Manchester United become the first English team to win the European Cup, beating two-times winners Benfica 4–1 in the final.[50] This final came ten years after the Munich air disaster, which had claimed the lives of eight United players and left their manager, Matt Busby, fighting for his life.[51] In the 1968–69 season, Ajax became the first Dutch team to reach the European Cup final, but they were beaten 4–1 by Milan, who claimed their second European Cup, with Pierino Prati scoring a hat-trick.[52] The 1969–70 season saw the first Dutch winners of the competition. Feyenoord knocked out the defending champions, Milan in the second round,[53] before beating Celtic in the final.[54] In the 1970–71 season, Ajax won the title, beating Greek side Panathinaikos in the final.[55] the season saw a number of changes, with penalty shoot-outs being introduced, and the away goals rule being changed so that it would be used in all rounds except the final.[56] It was also the first time a Greek team reached the final, as well as the first season that Real Madrid failed to qualify, having finished sixth in La Liga the previous season.[57] Ajax went on to win the competition three years in row (1971 to 1973), which Bayern Munich emulated from 1974 to 1976, before Liverpool won their first two titles in 1977 and 1978.[58] The following seasons saw victories in 1978–79 and 1979–80 for Brian Clough's Nottingham Forest. The following year Liverpool won their third title before Aston Villa continued the sense of English dominance in 1982. In 1982–83, Hamburger SV broke the English dominance. Liverpool regained it in 1983–84 before losing to Juventus (1984–85); Steaua București then won in 1985–86, Porto in 1986–87, PSV Eindhoven in 1987–88; Milan (2), Red Star Belgrade and Barcelona became champions before the competition was re-formulated as the UEFA Champions League. All English clubs were banned for five years (Liverpool for six years) following the 1985 European Cup final due to the Heysel Stadium disaster. \"Magic...it's magic above all else. When you hear the anthem it captivates you straight away.\" The UEFA Champions League anthem, officially titled simply as \"Champions League\", was written by Tony Britten, and is an adaptation of George Frideric Handel's 1727 anthem Zadok the Priest (one of his Coronation Anthems).[60][61] UEFA commissioned Britten in 1992 to arrange an anthem, and the piece was performed by London's Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and sung by the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields.[60] Stating that \"the anthem is now almost as iconic as the trophy\", UEFA's official website adds it is \"known to set the hearts of many of the world's top footballers aflutter\".[60] The chorus contains the three official languages used by UEFA: English, German, and French.[62] The climactic moment is set to the exclamations 'Die Meister! Die Besten! Les Grandes Équipes! The Champions!'.[63] The anthem's chorus is played before each UEFA Champions League game as the two teams are lined up, as well as at the beginning and end of television broadcasts of the matches. In addition to the anthem, there is also entrance music, which contains parts of the anthem itself, which is played as teams enter the field.[64] The complete anthem is about three minutes long, and has two short verses and the chorus.[62] Special vocal versions have been performed live at the Champions League final with lyrics in other languages, changing over to the host nation's language for the chorus. These versions were performed by Andrea Bocelli (Italian; Rome 2009, Milan 2016 and Cardiff 2017), Juan Diego Flores (Spanish; Madrid 2010), All Angels (Wembley 2011), Jonas Kaufmann and David Garrett (Munich 2012) and Mariza (Lisbon 2014). In the 2013 final at Wembley, the chorus was played twice. In the 2018 and 2019 finals, held in Kyiv and Madrid respectively, the instrumental version of the chorus was played, by 2Cellos (2018) and Asturia Girls (2019).[65][66] In the 2023 final, held in Istanbul, Hungarian pianist Ádám György performed the piano version of the anthem.[67] The anthem has been released commercially in its original version on iTunes and Spotify with the title of Champions League Theme. In 2018, composer Hans Zimmer remixed the anthem with rapper Vince Staples for EA Sports' video game FIFA 19, with it also featuring in the game's reveal trailer.[68] In 1991, UEFA asked its commercial partner, Television Event and Media Marketing (TEAM), to help brand the Champions League. This resulted in the anthem, \"house colours\" of black and white or silver and a logo, and the \"starball\". The starball was created by Design Bridge, a London-based firm selected by TEAM after a competition.[69] TEAM gives particular attention to detail in how the colours and starball are depicted at matches. According to TEAM, \"Irrespective of whether you are a spectator in Moscow or Milan, you will always see the same stadium dressing materials, the same opening ceremony featuring the 'starball' centre circle ceremony, and hear the same UEFA Champions League Anthem\". Based on research it conducted, TEAM concluded that by 1999, \"the starball logo had achieved a recognition rate of 94 percent among fans\".[70] The UEFA Champions League used to begin with a double round-robin group stage of 32 teams until it evolved into a league phase of 36 teams, which is preceded by two qualification 'streams' for teams that do not receive direct entry to the tournament proper. The two streams are divided between teams qualified by virtue of being league champions, and those qualified by virtue of finishing second, third or fourth in their national championship. The number of teams that each association enters into the UEFA Champions League is based upon the UEFA coefficients of the member associations. These coefficients are generated by the results of clubs representing each association during the previous five Champions League, Europa League and Conference League seasons. The higher an association's coefficient, the more teams represent the association in the Champions League, and the fewer qualification rounds the association's teams must compete in. Five of the remaining seven qualifying places are granted to the winners of a four-round qualifying tournament between the remaining 43 or 44 national champions, within which those champions from associations with higher coefficients receive byes to later rounds. The other two are granted to the winners of a three-round qualifying tournament between ten and eleven clubs from the associations ranked 5–6 through 15, which have qualified based upon finishing second, third or fourth in their respective national league. In addition to sporting criteria, any club must be licensed by its national association to participate in the Champions League. To obtain a license, the club must meet certain stadium, infrastructure and finance requirements. In 2005–06, Liverpool and Artmedia Bratislava became the first teams to reach the Champions League group stage after playing in all three qualifying rounds. Real Madrid and Barcelona hold the record for the most appearances in the group stage, having qualified 25 times, followed by Porto and Bayern Munich on 24.[71] Between 1999 and 2008, no differentiation was made between champions and non-champions in qualification. The 16 top-ranked teams spread across the biggest domestic leagues qualified directly for the tournament group stage. Prior to this, three preliminary knockout qualifying rounds whittled down the remaining teams, with teams starting in different rounds. An exception to the usual European qualification system happened in 2005, after Liverpool won the Champions League the year before, but did not finish in a Champions League qualification place in the Premier League that season. UEFA gave special dispensation for Liverpool to enter the Champions League, giving England five qualifiers.[72] UEFA subsequently ruled that the defending champions qualify for the competition the following year regardless of their domestic league placing. However, for those leagues with four entrants in the Champions League, this meant that, if the Champions League winner fell outside of its domestic league's top four, it would qualify at the expense of the fourth-placed team in the league. Until 2015–16, no association could have more than four entrants in the Champions League.[73] In May 2012, Tottenham Hotspur finished fourth in the 2011–12 Premier League, two places ahead of Chelsea, but failed to qualify for the 2012–13 Champions League, after Chelsea won the 2012 final.[74] Tottenham were demoted to the 2012–13 UEFA Europa League.[74] In May 2013,[75] it was decided that, starting from the 2015–16 season (and continuing at least for the three-year cycle until the 2017–18 season), the winners of the previous season's UEFA Europa League would qualify for the UEFA Champions League, entering at least the play-off round, and entering the group stage if the berth reserved for the Champions League title holders was not used. The previous limit of a maximum of four teams per association was increased to five, meaning that a fourth-placed team from one of the top three ranked associations would only have to be moved to the Europa League if both the Champions League and Europa League winners came from that association and both finished outside the top four of their domestic league.[76] In 2007, Michel Platini, the UEFA president, had proposed taking one place from the three leagues with four entrants and allocating it to that nation's cup winners. This proposal was rejected in a vote at a UEFA Strategy Council meeting.[77] In the same meeting, however, it was agreed that the third-placed team in the top three leagues would receive automatic qualification for the group stage, rather than entry into the third qualifying round, while the fourth-placed team would enter the play-off round for non-champions, guaranteeing an opponent from one of the top 15 leagues in Europe. This was part of Platini's plan to increase the number of teams qualifying directly into the group stage, while simultaneously increasing the number of teams from lower-ranked nations in the group stage.[78] In 2012, Arsène Wenger referred to qualifying for the Champions League by finishing in the top four places in the Premier League as the \"4th Place Trophy\". The phrase was coined after a pre-match conference when he was questioned about Arsenal's lack of a trophy after exiting the FA Cup. He said \"The first trophy is to finish in the top four\".[79] At Arsenal's 2012 AGM, Wenger was also quoted as saying: \"For me there are five trophies every season: Premier League, Champions League, the third is to qualify for the Champions League...\"[80] Beginning with the 2024–25 season, UEFA changed the format of their three club competitions, abandoning the group stage in favour of an expanded league phase.[81] The number of participating teams was increased from 32 to 36 teams. Teams are no longer divided into groups of four teams each but are ranked in a single table. Each team plays eight matches against eight different opponents. For the draw of the league phase, teams are divided into four seeding pots according to their UEFA coefficient. Each team will play against two teams from each pot, one home and one away. The league phase is played from September to January, while the knockout phase begins in February, with matches predominantly played on Tuesday and Wednesday nights. After the league phase, a two-legged knockout play-off round is played between teams finishing 9–16 (seeded) and 17–24 (unseeded) in the league phase. Teams finishing in the top eight of the league phase receive a bye to the round of 16 as seeded teams, while the eight winning teams from the knockout play-off round will enter the round of 16 draw as unseeded teams. Teams finishing 25th–36th place in the league phase and the eight losers of the knockout play-offs are eliminated from the competition and from European football since it is no longer possible to enter the Europa League from the league phase onwards. After the round of 16 the competition follows the traditional knockout format with quarter-finals, semi-finals (both two legged and without association draw protection) and then the final at a venue chosen prior to the season. The final is typically held in late May or early June. Prior to the 2024–25 season, the tournament proper began with a group stage of 32 teams, divided into eight groups of four.[82] The draw to determine which teams entered each group was seeded based on each team's UEFA coefficient, and no group could contain more than one club from each association. Each team played six group stage games, meeting the other three teams in its group home and away in a round-robin format.[82] The first place team and the runners-up from each group then progressed to the next round. The third-placed teams entered the Europa League's knockout round and the fourth-placed teams were eliminated from the competition. For the next stage – the last 16 – the winning team from one group played against the runners-up from another group, but teams from the same association could not be drawn against each other (see random two-sided matching). From the quarter-finals onwards, the draw was entirely random, without association protection.[83] The group stage was played from September to December, whilst the knockout stage began in February, with matches usually played on Tuesday and Wednesday nights. The knockout ties were played in a two-legged format, with the exception of the final. In the 2019–20 season, due to the COVID-19 pandemic the tournament was suspended for five months. The format of the remainder of the tournament was temporarily amended as a result, with the quarter-finals and semi-finals being played as single match knockout ties at neutral venues in Lisbon, Portugal in the summer with the final taking place on 23 August 2020.[84] The following is the default access list. Changes will be made to the access list above if the Champions League or Europa League title holders qualify for the tournament via their domestic leagues. Each year, the winning team is presented with the European Champion Clubs' Cup, the current version of which has been awarded since 1967. From the 1968–69 season and prior to the 2008–09 season any team that won the Champions League three years in a row or five times overall was awarded the official trophy permanently.[86] Each time a club achieved this, a new official trophy had to be forged for the following season.[87] Five clubs own a version of the official trophy: Real Madrid, Ajax, Bayern Munich, Milan and Liverpool.[86] Since 2008, the official trophy has remained with UEFA and the clubs are awarded a replica.[86] The current trophy is 74 cm (29 in) tall and made of silver, weighing 11 kg (24 lb). It was designed by Jürg Stadelmann, a jeweller from Bern, Switzerland, after the original was given to Real Madrid in 1966 in recognition of their six titles to date, and cost 10,000 Swiss francs. As of the 2012–13 season, 40 gold medals are presented to the Champions League winners, and 40 silver medals to the runners-up.[88] Starting with the 2024–25 season, the distribution of the prize money is as follows.[89] A large part of the distributed revenue from the UEFA Champions League is linked to the \"market pool\", the distribution of which is determined by the value of the television market in each nation. For the 2019–20 season, Paris Saint-Germain, who were the runners-up, earned nearly €126.8 million in total, of which €101.3 million was prize money, compared with the €125.46 million earned by Bayern Munich, who won the tournament and were awarded €112.96 million in prize money.[90] Like the FIFA World Cup, the UEFA Champions League is sponsored by a group of multinational corporations, in contrast to the single main sponsor typically found in national top-flight leagues. When the Champions League was created in 1992, it was decided that a maximum of eight companies should be allowed to sponsor the event, with each corporation being allocated four advertising boards around the perimeter of the pitch, as well as logo placement at pre- and post-match interviews and a certain number of tickets to each match. This, combined with a deal to ensure tournament sponsors were given priority on television advertisements during matches, ensured that each of the tournament's main sponsors was given maximum exposure.[91] From the 2012–13 knockout phase, UEFA used LED advertising hoardings installed in knockout participant stadiums, including the final. From the 2015–16 season onwards, UEFA has used such hoardings from the play-off round until the final.[92] Since 2021, the UEFA also used Virtual Board Replacement (VBR) technology to offer region-based advertising; regional sponsors are inserted into the hoardings as shown on the broadcast feed in specific regions along with the global sponsors.[93][94] Individual clubs may wear jerseys with advertising. However, only two sponsorships are permitted per jersey in addition to that of the kit manufacturer, at the chest and the left sleeve.[95] Exceptions are made for non-profit organisations, which can feature on the front of the shirt, incorporated with the main sponsor or in place of it; or on the back, either below the squad number or on the collar area.[96] If a club plays a match in a nation where the relevant sponsorship category is restricted (such as France's alcohol advertising restriction), then they must remove that logo from their jerseys. For example, when Rangers played French side Auxerre in the 1996–97 Champions League, they wore the logo of the holiday chain Center Parcs instead of their primary sponsor, McEwan's Lager (both companies at the time were subsidiaries of Scottish & Newcastle).[97] The tournament's main sponsors for the 2024–27 cycle are: Adidas is a secondary sponsor and supplies the official match ball, while Macron supplies the referee kits.[107] The competition attracts an extensive television audience, not just in Europe, but throughout the world. The final of the tournament has been, in recent years, the most-watched annual sporting event in the world.[108] The final of the 2012–13 tournament had the competition's highest TV ratings to date, drawing approximately 360 million television viewers.[109] Notes Players that are still active in Europe are highlighted in boldface. The table below does not include appearances made in the qualification stage of the competition. Starting from the 2021–22 edition, UEFA introduced the UEFA Champions League Player of the Season award. The jury is composed of the coaches of the clubs that participated in the group stage of the competition, as well as 55 journalists selected by the European Sports Media (ESM) group, one from each UEFA member association. In the same season, UEFA also introduced the UEFA Champions League Young Player of the Season award.",

                "title": "Luigi Mangione: Who is the suspect in the shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson?",
                "content": "A profile is emerging of the 26-year-old man charged with murder over last week's fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare's chief executive, Brian Thompson, in New York City. Police announced on Monday they had arrested Luigi Mangione after he was recognised at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania. The Baltimore, Maryland, native was found in possession of a so-called ghost gun, a largely untraceable firearm, and a three-page handwritten document that indicated \"motivation and mindset\", officials said. Mr Mangione was born and raised in Maryland and has ties to San Francisco, California, according to New York Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny. He has no prior arrests in New York and his last previous address was in Honolulu, Hawaii, police said. He is from a prominent Baltimore family, and attended a private, all-boys high school in Baltimore, called the Gilman School, according to school officials. Mr Mangione was named as the valedictorian, which is usually the student with the highest academic achievements in a class. In a statement, the school called the situation \"deeply distressing\". A former classmate, Freddie Leatherbury, told the Associated Press news agency that Mr Mangione came from a wealthy family, even by that private school's standards. \"Quite honestly, he had everything going for him,\" Mr Leatherbury said. Speaking to the BBC's US partner, CBS News, another classmate described themselves anonymously as a close friend of Mr Mangione - saying the shooting suspect \"didn't have any enemies\" and was a \"valedictorian for a reason\". Mr Mangione went on to graduate from the University of Pennsylvania, where he received a bachelor's and master's degree in computer science, according to the school, and founded a video game development club. A friend who attended the Ivy League college at the same time as Mr Mangione described him as a \"super normal\" and \"smart person\". Mr Mangione was employed as a data engineer for TrueCar, a digital retailing website for new and used cars, according to his social media profiles. A company spokesman told the BBC he had not worked there since 2023. According to his LinkedIn profile, Mr Mangione previously worked as a programming intern for Firaxis, a video game developer. He also spent time in a co-living surfing community in Hawaii called Surfbreak. Sarah Nehemiah, who knew him then, told CBS he left due to his back injury which had worsened from surfing and hiking. The three-page, handwritten document found on him suggested a motive, according to investigators. The pages expressed \"ill will\" towards corporate America, they said. A senior law enforcement official told the New York Times it said: \"These parasites had it coming\" and \"I do apologise for any strife and trauma, but it had to be done\". Investigators say the words \"deny\", \"defend\" and \"depose\" were written on shell casings found at the scene of Mr Thompson's murder. Critics of healthcare insurers call these the \"three Ds of insurance\" - tactics used by companies to reject payment claims by patients. Friends have told US media he had surgery on his back. The background image on an X account believed to belong to Mangione shows an x-ray of a spine with hardware in it. However, it is unclear how much his own experience of the healthcare system shaped his views. A person matching his name and photo had an account on Goodreads, a user-generated book review site, where he read two books about back pain in 2022, one of them called Crooked: Outwitting the Back Pain Industry. He also gave four stars to a text called Industrial Society and Its Future by Theodore Kaczynski – also known as the Unabomber manifesto. Starting in 1978, Kaczynski carried out a bombing campaign that killed three people and injured dozens of others, until he was arrested in 1996. In his review, Mr Mangione acknowledged Kaczynski was a violent individual who killed innocent people but the book should not be dismissed as the manifesto of a lunatic, rather the work of an extreme political revolutionary. His social media profiles also suggest that he had fallen out of touch with family and friends in recent months. In a post on X from October, someone tagged an account believed to be Mr Mangione's and wrote: \"Hey, are you ok? Nobody has heard from you in months, and apparently your family is looking for you.\" Mr Mangione comes from a prominent family in the Baltimore area who are known for businesses including country clubs, nursing homes and a radio station according to local media. The suspect's paternal grandparents, Nicholas and Mary Mangione, were real estate developers who purchased the Turf Valley Country Club in 1978 and Hayfields Country Club in Hunt Valley in 1986. Shortly after the suspect was charged, Republican state lawmaker Nino Mangione - believed to be Mr Mangione's cousin - released a statement saying the family was \"shocked and devastated\". \"We offer our prayers to the family of Brian Thompson and we ask people to pray for all involved\", the statement read, signing off as \"The Mangione Family\". The blaze has burned more than 300 acres with a \"rapid rate of spread\", say authorities. The Franklin brush fire has burned about 100 acres in an upmarket area of the US state of California. The 26-year-old was taken into custody at a McDonald's in Pennsylvania, in connection to the killing of United Health CEO Brian Thompson. The court says Murdoch acted in \"bad faith\" by trying to give control of his empire to his eldest son. A prosecutor says Luigi Mangione, 26, who was denied bail at an initial court appearance, is likely to be charged with homicide. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

Police have charged a 26-year-old man in connection to the killing of UnitedHealthcare's CEO Bryan Thompson last week. On Monday, police announced they charged 26-year-old Luigi Mangione in connection to the murder of United Healthcare CEO Bryan Thompson in New York last week. Mangione, who was recognised in a McDonalds in Pennsylvania, was in possession of a ghost gun and a three-page handwritten document that the police said showed \"motivation and mindset\" for Thompson's killing. Shortly after first being detained, Mangione was charged with murder and four other counts. This is all we have learned so far about the suspect, who is set to be extradited to New York to face charges connected with Thompson's death. Mangione was born and raised in Maryland and comes from a wealthy family, having attended an elite, all-boys high school in Baltimore where he was valedictorian. His father, Nick Mangione, was a successful real estate developer known for Turf Valley Resort, a sprawling luxury retreat and conference centre outside Baltimore that he purchased in 1978. One of his cousins is Republican Maryland state legislator Nino Mangione. Since his arrest, his family have released a statement saying they \"only know what we have read in the media. Our family is shocked and devastated by Luigi’s arrest. We offer our prayers to the family of Brian Thompson and we ask people to pray for all involved\". In his valedictory speech, Luigi Mangione described his classmates’ “incredible courage to explore the unknown and try new things,” according to a post on the school website. He praised their collective inventiveness and pioneering mindset. A classmate of his at highschool, Freddie Leatherbury, told Associated Press about Mangione: \"Quite honestly, he had everything going for him\". Mangione earned undergraduate and graduate degrees in computer science at the Ivy League University of Pennsylvania, where he learned to code and helped to start a club for people interested in gaming. Since graduating, Mangione was employed as a data engineer for digital retailing website TrueCar and as an intern for video game developer Firaxis. Mangione's social media account provide some clues about his possible thinking. An active Goodreads account shows he wrote sympathetically about the so-called \"Unabomber manifesto\", a book written by Theodore Kaczynski who carried out a bombing campaign that killed three people starting in 1978. \"While these actions tend to be characterized as those of a crazy luddite, however, they are more accurately seen as those of an extreme political revolutionary\" Mangione said of Kaczynski. Elsewhere, his profiles suggest he had recently lost contact with his family and friends, having not posted in several months. In October, a post on X showed someone tagging Mangione and writing: \"Hey, are you ok? Nobody has heard from you in months, and apparently your family is looking for you\". Mangione was taken into custody after being recognised at McDonald's, where a customer informed an employee who tipped off authorities. The suspect was in possession of a ghost gun, a silencer and a loaded magazine with six rounds of ammunition. Police said he was also carrying several fake IDs, including one used to check into the New York City hostel where Thompson's shooter was seen. Mangione reportedly lied about his name when arrested, telling officers he \"clearly shouldn't have\" when asked. A criminal complaint filed in Pennsylvania says that he became quiet and started to shake when asked if he had recently visited New York. He has been charged with the murder of Bryan Thompson who was the CEO of United Healthcare, the US's largest health insurer. Bullet castings with the words \"deny\" and \"delay\" were left at the scene. The phrases are commonly used to describe insurer tactics to avoid paying claims, leading the public to speculate if the shooting was motivated by hatred for healthcare insurers paying claims. Police said they found three pages of documents when they arrested Mangione that showed \"ill will towards corporate America\" including a sentence that read: \"I do apologise for any strife and trauma, but it had to be done\".

                "content": "A 26-year-old man has been arrested in connection with last week's fatal shooting in New York City of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. Luigi Mangione was taken into custody at a McDonald's in the town of Altoona, Pennsylvania, about 280 miles (450km) west of New York City on Monday after a customer at the fast-food outlet recognised him. He was found in possession of a handwritten document that indicated \"motivation and mindset\", according to police. Mr Mangione appeared later in a Pennsylvania court to be arraigned on five initial counts and was denied bail. A prosecutor said he expected a homicide charge to be filed soon. Mr Mangione was formally charged on Monday evening with forgery, carrying firearms without a licence, tampering with records or identification, possessing instruments of crime and providing a false identification to police. Pete Weeks, a district attorney in Pennsylvania's Blair County, said that homicide charges from New York would be filed \"tonight or tomorrow\" or in the \"near future\". Mr Mangione stopped co-operating after he was detained, officials said. Handcuffed at the wrists and ankles, he appeared in court on Monday wearing jeans and a dark blue jersey. He appeared calm during the hearing, occasionally looking around at those present, including the media. Mr Thompson, 50, was fatally shot in the back last Wednesday morning outside the Hilton hotel in Midtown Manhattan where UnitedHealthcare, the medical insurance giant he led, was holding an investors' meeting. Police say he was targeted in a pre-planned killing. The words \"deny\", \"defend\" and \"depose\" were written on shell casings found at the scene. Investigators believe they could be a reference to what critics call the \"three Ds of insurance\" - tactics used by insurance companies to reject payment claims by patients in America's complicated and mostly privately run healthcare system. New York City investigators used one of the world's largest digital surveillance systems, police dogs, drones and divers in a Central Park lake in the search for clues before the manhunt spread to neighbouring states. But it was ultimately a McDonald's customer that recognised the suspect from media coverage and alerted an employee, who tipped off the police. When police arrived, Mr Mangione showed them a fake New Jersey driver's licence with the name Mark Rosario, said court papers. He \"became quiet and started to shake\" when an officer asked if he had been to New York recently, the criminal complaint adds. When he was told he would be arrested if he lied about his name, he gave his real name, according to the court papers. Asked why he lied, he told officers that \"I clearly shouldn't have\". A search of his backpack uncovered a 3D-printed pistol, a 3D-printed silencer and a loaded magazine with six rounds of 9mm ammunition. Prosecutors said he was also carrying a US passport and $10,000 cash, $2,000 of it in foreign currency, though Mr Mangione disputed the amount in court. Investigators revealed that finding him was a complete surprise, as they did not have his name on a list of suspects before Monday. Earlier in the day, New York Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said the weapon and suppressor seized by investigators from the suspect were \"both consistent with the weapon used in the murder\". If charges in New York are filed, Mr Mangione will be presented with the option of waiving his extradition to the state or contesting it. If he waives it, he will immediately be made available to New York authorities. If he contests it, the process could take between 30 and 45 days. A three-page handwritten document found on Mr Mangione's possession suggested he harboured \"ill will towards corporate America\", said New York Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny. Mr Kenny said that Mr Mangione was born and raised in Maryland and has ties to San Francisco, California. His last known address was in Honolulu, Hawaii. TrueCar, a website for car buyers, confirmed that he had been employed there but left in 2023. As a teenager, Mr Mangione attended a private all-boys school in Maryland, where he was class valedictorian, a title usually awarded to students with the best grades. A LinkedIn account that appears to belong to him says he worked as a data engineer in California, and graduated from the University of Pennsylvania, where he was a teaching assistant and founded a video game development club. Several posts to an account on X, formerly Twitter, that appeared to belong to him suggested that friends had been trying to reach him, with one person posting in October that \"nobody has heard from you in months\".

                "content": "Man, 26, arrested at McDonald’s outlet with gun and fraudulent IDs on his person, according to police. UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was shot dead by a masked gunman outside a New York City hotel last week in an apparent assassination that has gripped the public’s imagination. Security camera footage of the incident in the early hours of December 4 shows the suspect drawing his weapon and firing at least three times at close range. The 50-year-old CEO drops to the pavement in the video, later dying from his wounds. After days of speculation as to the motivation and identity of the gunman, police in the US state of Pennsylvania on Monday arrested 26-year-old Luigi Nicholas Mangione. Here’s what we know about the man named as a “strong person of interest” in the fatal shooting. New York Police Department (NYPD) Commissioner Jessica Tisch said Mangione was arrested at a McDonald’s restaurant in Altoona, Pennsylvania after a worker recognised the suspect from police photos and alerted authorities. Mangione was found sitting at a table looking at a silver laptop and wearing a blue medical mask, according to authorities. When asked if he had been to New York recently, Mangione “became quiet and started to shake”, according to a criminal complaint. Mangione was carrying a United States passport and multiple fake IDs at the time of his arrest, including one with the name Mark Rosario, which was used to check into a hostel in New York City before the shooting, according to Tisch. Mangione also had a silencer and a gun “both consistent with the weapon used in the murder”, according to police. Police suspect the weapon to be a “ghost gun” – one assembled at home without a serial number, possibly made using a 3D printer. Tisch said Mangione was carrying a “handwritten document” which outlines “both his motivation and mindset” for Thompson’s murder. Authorities late on Monday charged Mangione with murder, possession of an unlicensed firearm, forgery and providing false identification to police. Police have not publicly released that handwritten note, nor offered details about its contents. US media, quoting unnamed law enforcement sources, reported that the note contained the lines, “These parasites had it coming” and “I do apologise for any strife and trauma, but it had to be done”. Investigators said last week the words “defend”, “deny” and “depose” were written on the casings of bullets found at the scene of the murder. Many have interpreted the words as a nod to tactics allegedly used by US health insurance companies to avoid paying claims to patients, speculating that Mangione may have acted in anger against the industry. Insight into Mangione’s possible motivation can also be found in a sympathetic review of Industrial Society and Its Future, aka the Unabomber Manifesto, posted from what appears to be his account on the website Goodreads. The review describes Ted Kaczynski – who was responsible for a decades-long bombing campaign across the US that killed three people and injured 23 others – as an “extreme political revolutionary”. “It’s easy to quickly and thoughtlessly write this off as the manifesto of a lunatic, in order to avoid facing some of the uncomfortable problems it identifies. But it’s simply impossible to ignore how prescient many of his predictions about modern society turned out,” the review reads. The review also states that “violence is necessary to survive” when all other forms of communication fail, calling those who reject this notion “cowards and predators”. The same Goodreads account also liked a quote by author Kurt Vonnegut reading: “America is the wealthiest nation on Earth, but its people are mainly poor, and poor Americans are urged to hate themselves”. a liked quote from (what seems to be) Luigi Mangione's Goodreads account pic.twitter.com/vUjGgWsFsa — Jessica (Ka) Burbank (@JessicaLBurbank) December 9, 2024 Mangione was born into a wealthy family in the US state of Maryland, where he graduated from an elite all-boys private institution, the Gilman School, as high school valedictorian in 2016. Mangione then attended the University of Pennsylvania, graduating from the Ivy League school in 2020 with a bachelor’s and master’s degree in computer science and a minor in mathematics. Stanford University has confirmed that a person by the same name was employed at the school between May and September of 2019, working as a head counsellor under the Stanford Pre-Collegiate Studies programme. Mangione, who developed a game app as a teenager, worked as a “data engineer” at a vehicle shopping firm called TrueCar from November 2020, according to his LinkedIn profile. A TrueCar spokesperson said that he had not worked there since 2023. Mangione lived in Hawaii according to his X account, where he regularly posted about technological advances like artificial intelligence, fitness and healthy living. Among Mangione’s recent interactions on the site are reposts of author Jonathan Haidt promoting his new book, The Anxious Generation, and American neuroscientist Andrew Huberman promoting a podcast episode covering anxiety and depression. Another repost laments the vacuum left by the decline of religion in the West, and the growth of progressive ideologies – including diversity, equity and inclusion – in its place. The banner on his profile included an X-ray image of a person’s lower back with what appear to be screws and plates inserted into it. Other reviews found on Mangione’s Goodreads account were related to health and healing back pain, including, Crooked: Outwitting the Back Pain Industry and Getting on the Road to Recovery.

The reasons for such a distinction didn't have much to do with the game's postseason implications — Cincinnati's playoff hopes are on their last legs, while Dallas' have already evaporated. Rather, this was a spectacle, just the sort that Jerry Jones envisioned when drawing up the plans for AT&T Stadium, the booming metropolis he hoped would house championship-caliber teams. So, how is that plan going along thus far? Well, on Monday, the Cowboys added a new low to a season increasingly filled with them, falling to the Bengals 27-20 under the MNF banner. MORE BENGALS-COWBOYS NEWS: A defeat to Cincinnati and its talismanic battery of Joe Burrow and Ja'Marr Chase wouldn't be a cause of much concern in normal circumstances. The pairing was as lively as ever on Monday, with Burrow completing 75 percent of his pass attempts and accounting for 369 yards and three touchdowns worth of passing offense. Chase collected 14 catches for 177 yards and two scores on the night, further cementing his place as a legitimate Offensive Player of the Year contender. For all of Burrow and Chase's heroics, it was Dallas that looked the likelier victors with two minutes left. Nick Vigil burst through the mire, got his harrowing mitts to Ryan Rehkow's attempted punt, and batted it down to a mere trickle off Rehkow's foot. The ball sidled back and forth like a tumbleweed as it bounded harmlessly toward midfield, seemingly foreshadowing some sort of Cowboys win. Right? Not exactly. Gunner Amani Oruwariye attempted to field the bouncing ball, only to mishandle the wild feather. It bounced into Cincinnati's hands afterward. League rules insist that in such a circumstance, the kicking team receives the ball with a full set of downs. Burrow and Chase went to work, chopped down Dallas' secondary in one fell swoop, and walked out fortunate victors. The Cowboys, meanwhile, were left rueing another seemingly incomprehensible defeat.

The Cowboys are going to get the ball back as we sink below two minutes. 10:59 p.m.: Burrow's return to the field coincided with a new fashion choice: after being swept away in Dallas' pass rush last possession, he's sporting a bulky sleeve across his left knee — the same one he injured as a rookie. 10:55 p.m.: Dallas returns the favor, recording a three-and-out of its own. The Bengals will take control with about 5:40 left in the fourth. 10:48 p.m.: Cincinnati is forced to boot the ball away. However, it's fairly apparent that a rusher grab a fistful of Burrow's facemark prior to him getting wrapped in a sack. Nevertheless, the call wasn't made. As such, the Bengals are forced to kick it away. 10:45 p.m.: Tanner Hudson is the latest name to get involved in the offensive action, gobbling up 19 yards after absorbing a Burrow bolt. 10:41 p.m.: Cincinnati's defense bursts into life, stacking the deck to force a Dallas three-and-out.

Aubrey's line drive finds its target, pushing Dallas back out in front. Cowboys 20, Bengals 17 10:09 p.m.: INTERCEPTION!

Rush will look to lead his offense back to its early game best after seeing three straight drives end in three-and-outs. 9:33 p.m.: FIELD GOAL!

Looks to be getting whatever he wants on offense, even when matched up against notable corners Bland and Diggs. 9:22 p.m.: Dallas falls flat on the ensuing drive, with the Bengals forcing a punt following a swift three-and-out. Cincinnati will have a chance to add to its advantage as the first half draws to a close. 9:14 p.m.: TOUCHDOWN! Brown fields Burrow's throw, races down the sidelines and dashes beyond a gaggle of Cowboys mercenaries, using Iosivas' timely block to take his place in the end zone.

Miscommunication between Rush and Lamb ends in heartbreak. Anticipating the slant pattern, Rush fired a ball towards Lamb's general vicinity. Unfortunately for the Dallas signal-caller, Lamb was displaced, caught under the weight of an incidental collision with his marker. The result?

                "content": "The Cincinnati Bengals have snapped their three-game skid. Cincinnati defeated the Dallas Cowboys on the road in the Week 14 edition of “Monday Night Football,” 27-20. Wide receiver Ja’Marr Chase continued his incredible run with two more touchdowns, including a 40-yard catch-and-run that ended up being the game winner. That score made it eight touchdowns for the wideout in his last four games and extended his league lead to 15 receiving touchdowns this year. Chase might not have had a chance to score that touchdown if not for a wild sequence a few plays earlier. Bengals punter Ryan Rehkow’s punt was blocked by a Cowboys defender on fourth down coming out of the two-minute warning. But the tipped ball ended up bouncing off of the arms of cornerback/special teamer Amani Oruwariye, and Cincinnati recovered the fumble just shy of midfield. NFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more. Three plays later, Chase took the game-winner to the house. Here’s the full story of how the Bengals finally won a one-score game after dropping three straight entering this week: DO YOU LIKE FOOTBALL? Then you'll enjoy getting our NFL newsletter delivered to your inbox A Bart Simpson-to-Lisa Simpson touchdown play won the game for the Bengals during \"The Simpsons\" alt-cast. Cooper Rush's pass attempt to Jake Ferguson on fourth-and-7 from the Cowboys' 48-yard line and 31 seconds remaining in the game fell incomplete. The Bengals prevailed, 27-20, thanks to that wild muffed blocked punt-to-long touchdown sequence. The Cowboys' Amani Oruwariye attempted to field a blocked punt, and it turned out to be quite costly for Dallas. Oruwariye couldn't field the blocked kick cleanly and turned it over the Bengals, who immediately took advantage of their great fortune. Instead of getting the ball back with two minutes remaining, the Cowboys got burned by Bengals receiver Ja'Marr Chase for a 40-yard touchdown pass from Joe Burrow. Chase finished the game with 14 catches for 177 yards and two touchdowns. The 14 receptions ties a record for the most in a \"Monday Night Football\" game. It was a stunning turn over events at AT&T Stadium. And for Cowboys fans, Oruwariye's muff might live in infamy alongside Leon Lett's gaffe on Thanksgiving Day 1993. Cade York knocked through his second field goal attempt of the night, this one from 29 yards out, to draw the game back even. Early in the fourth quarter, DeMarvion Overshown was in on a tackle of Bengals running back Chase Brown. After the play, the Cowboys' linebacker remained on the ground and needed the help of two Cowboys trainers to walk off of the field. Overshown has been declared out with a knee injury. Overshown, a member of the 2023 NFL draft class, missed the entirety of his rookie season after tearing his ACL in a preseason game. He had played in all 12 games for the Cowboys entering Monday night's game. Former MLS first-round draft pick Brandon Aubrey nailed his second field goal attempt of the night to give the Cowboys another lead. Dallas leads, 20-17, five seconds into the fourth quarter. Dallas has the ball on Cincinnati's 29-yard line on fourth-and-10 and will attempt a field goal to begin the fourth quarter. Joe Burrow overthrew Ja'Marr Chase deep downfield, and his pass ended in the hands of the Cowboys' safety instead. Dallas will take over possession on its own 17-yard line with 6:50 to play in the third quarter. Over on \"The Simpsons\" alt-cast, it was Cowboys safety Homer Simpson who intercepted Bengals quarterback Bart Simpson on the play. The Cowboys scored on their first possession of the second half thanks to Brandin Cooks' efforts in the end zone. The receiver ripped through a defensive hold by cornerback Josh Newton, and Cooper Rush found him in the back of the end zone for the score. It's 17-17 with 10:32 left in the third quarter. The Cowboys went three-and-out on their final possession of the first half, and this \"Monday Night Football\" matchup goes to halftime with the Bengals holding a seven-point lead. Dallas will receive the second half kickoff. The Bengals drove down to the red zone before they were stopped by Dallas' defense at the 19. Cade York hit a 37-yard field goal to give Cincinnati a 17-10 lead with 30 seconds left in the second quarter. Dallas will have one last possession before it receives the second half kickoff. Did you know York is dating a Cowboys cheerleader? Chase Brown took a swing pass from Joe Burrow to the house and celebrated his score by jumping into the Salvation Army kettle behind the end zone. Though the running back was initially declared out of bounds at the 3-yard line, the call was overturned after a review. The touchdown gave Cincinnati its first lead of the game. The Bengals lead, 13-10, with 3:30 left in the first half. Over on \"The Simpsons\" alt-cast, Lisa Simpson — who displayed her athletic abilities as a hockey goalie in the episode \"Lisa on Ice\" — came into the game for the Bengals as the running back and took Joe Burrow's pass to the end zone. Dallas is unable to take full advantage of the good field position when its drive stalls at the Bengals' 17-yard line. Brandon Aubrey knocks through a 35-yard field goal to make it 10-7 Cowboys with 6:23 left in the second quarter. The Bengals opted to go for it facing a fourth-and-3 in Dallas territory. DeMarvion Overshown managed to break forward to defend Joe Burrow's touch pass attempt to running back Chase Brown, which fell to the ground incomplete. The Cowboys will take over near midfield with just under 10 minutes to go in the first half. On the first play of the second quarter, Cooper Rush's pass attempt was tipped by cornerback Cam Taylor-Britt and intercepted by Geno Stone inside the Bengals' 5-yard line. Cincinnati takes over on its own 4 five seconds into the period. Dallas and Cincinnati are knotted at one score apiece after 15 minutes, but the Cowboys will have second-and-10 from the Bengals' 12-yard line to start the second quarter. After CeeDee Lamb caught a screen pass behind the line of scrimmage, Bengals linebacker Germaine Pratt got his hands on the receiver almost immediately. The veteran wideout was able to escape the tackle and ran across the width of the field before turning upfield for a massive gain. The play brought the Cowboys from their own 33-yard line to just outside of the red zone with less than two minutes left in the first quarter. Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow marched his team down the field on an 11-play, 70-yard drive that concluded with Ja'Marr Chase hauling in a contested catch in the end zone. It's the wideout's seventh touchdown in his last four games. This game is tied, 7-7, with 2:45 remaining in the first quarter. Over on \"The Simpsons\" alt-cast, Bart Simpson enters the game to play quarterback for the Bengals and throws a touchdown pass to Ralph Wiggum, who somehow got position for the reception against the Cowboys' Pro Bowl cornerback DaRon Bland. Bart Simpson has shown significant improvement at the position ever since his infamous tenure as a quarterback in the episode \"Bart Star.\" After a three-and-out by the Bengals' offense, Cowboys quarterback Cooper Rush led a nine-play, 60-yard touchdown drive to open the scoring. Rush found Lamb in the back-right corner of the end zone on a fourth-and-1 play from the Cincinnati 11-yard line. Over on \"The Simpsons\" alt-cast, quarterback Homer Simpson came in to connect with Lamb for the touchdown play. The Bengals head south to AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, to take on the Cowboys in prime time on Monday night. ESPN again is the broadcast home of \"Monday Night Football.\" The longtime team of Joe Buck (play-by-play) and Troy Aikman (color) will be on the call, with Lisa Salters adding reports from the sideline.

Welcome to 2024 and this battle of the streaming wars, as Disney and ESPN unveil its most alternative alt-cast for \"Monday Night Football\" as the Cowboys host the Bengals. “We were just so lucky also that the Cowboys are sort of like a Homer Simpson-type team, American team, and Mike McCarthy might be a Homer-type guy, one might imagine,” “The Simpsons” showrunner Matt Selman said on a conference call last week. “And then you have Joe Burrow on the other side who is a cool young, spiky-haired, blonde bad boy – he's like Bart. And that fits our character archetypes so perfectly.” — Chris Bumbaca Here's how the USA TODAY Sports staff feels the Cowboys vs. Bengals \"MNF\" matchup will sway: The Bengals are favorites to defeat the Cowboys, according to the BetMGM NFL odds.

Dak Prescott suffered a partial hamstring avulsion – a tear during which part of the tendon rips off the bone – during Dallas' 27-21 loss to the Falcons in Week 9. He told reporters after the contest that he wasn't sure if the injury occurred while he was running or being tackled. \"It's something I’ve never felt,\" Prescott said while describing the injury. \"I saw the medical team and asked could I make it worse. At that point they said I wouldn’t be able to protect myself and made the call to hold me out.\" According to BetMGM Sportsbook, the Cowboys have +3000 odds to to make the playoffs entering Week 14. That implied probability gives Dallas a 3.23% chance of qualifying for the postseason. That's greater than the estimated 1% chance that the New York Times gives the Cowboys to win their way into the postseason. That speaks to the fact that Dallas would likely need to win out and receive plenty of help to claw its way back into the NFC playoff race after a 3-7 start to the season. The Cowboys' five remaining opponents have a combined winning percentage of .508, per Tankathon. That makes Dallas' remaining schedule the 17th toughest of the NFL's 32 teams entering Week 14. The said, the Cowboys will face a test on \"Monday Night Football\" in Week 14 against a high-flying Cincinnati Bengals offense. Dallas will also end the season with two divisional games, so that will make it difficult to win out. That makes it easy to understand why oddsmakers aren't bullish the Cowboys' chances of making a playoff push, especially considering that they would need a team in front of them, like the Commanders, to falter. Below is a full look at Dallas' schedule: In the hunt: x – clinched playoff berth Should the Cowboys opt to move on from Mike McCarthy following the 2024 season, there are several options who could be targeted as next Dallas head coach: The Bengals travel to Jerry World on Monday night.

                "content": "ARLINGTON, Texas -- Bengals wide receiver Ja'Marr Chase re-gained the NFL receiving lead with a season-high 14 catches, the last one a spectacular 40-yard-catch-and-run touchdown with 1:01 left that gave the Bengals a 27-20 win over the Cowboys Monday night. Former Bengals linebacker Nick Vigil blocked rookie punter Ryan Rehkow's punt on the first play after two-minute warning, but a Cowboy touched it, and Bengals rookie linebacker Maema Njongmeta recovered to give Cincinnati a new set of downs. Quarterback Joe Burrow had his fifth straight game of at least three touchdown passes and his fourth straight 300-yard day with 369 yards, 177 to Chase. Ja’Marr Chase caught a swing pass from Joe Burrow on the game's first play from scrimmage, marking his 80th reception of the season. He became the first player in NFL history to record 80+ catches, 1,000+ receiving yards and 7+ receiving touchdowns in each of his first four career seasons. On his game-winning touchdown catch late in the fourth period, Chase surpassed 5,000 career receiving yards. Playing in his 58th regular-season game, he tied former Saints receiver Michael Thomas as the fifth-fastest player in league history to reach 5K receiving yards. Chase's final tally was 14 receptions for 177 yards and two scores. His 14 grabs were the second-most in his career, and tied for the second-most in any game in Bengals history.

The record for most such consecutive games belongs to Steve Young, who hit those numbers in five straight contests in 1998. Drew Brees (2011-12), Peyton Manning (2012), Aaron Rodgers (2012-13) and Patrick Mahomes (2018) are the other quarterbacks who did it in four straight. Burrow found Chase in the end zone on a second-and-goal play to give Cincinnati its first points of the game with 2:45 left in the first quarter. It was Chase's 14th receiving touchdown of the season, which extended his league-leading total and set a new career high. His previous career high of 13 touchdowns came in his 2021 rookie campaign. Chase's 14 receiving scores also stand alone as the second-most in a season in Bengals history, three shy of Carl Pickens' record 17 touchdowns in 1995. The touchdown additionally was the 43rd of Chase's career, which surpassed former Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski (42) for the fourth-most within a player's first four seasons in NFL history. Only Hall of Famers Randy Moss (53), Randy Moss (49) and Bob Hayes (45) caught more touchdowns in their first four years. Chase eclipsed 100 yards on the night with his ninth catch early in the third quarter. It marked his 18th career game with 100+ receiving yards (fourth this season), which tied former receiver Cris Collinsworth for the fifth-most in Bengals history. Chase finished the night with 14 catches for 177 yards and two touchdowns. Second-year halfback Chase Brown finished the night with 58 rushing yards on 14 attempts and 65 receiving yards on six catches, good for 123 total yards from scrimmage.

It was Brown's third scoring reception of the season, and his 10th career touchdown overall (six rushing, four receiving). Brown now has nine touchdowns over his last 10 games played, dating back to Week 4 at Carolina. Geno Stone came up with his second interception of the season midway through the second quarter, when he secured a pass that was deflected by Cam Taylor-Britt to end a Cowboys drive that reached Cincinnati's 12-yard line.

                "content": "Watch CBS News By Alice Gainer, Dick Brennan, Tim McNicholas Updated on: December 10, 2024 / 8:17 AM EST / CBS New York NEW YORK -- Daniel Penny was found not guilty of criminally negligent homicide in the chokehold death of Jordan Neely on a New York City subway car in 2023. Penny, a 26-year-old Marine veteran, had pleaded not guilty to charges of second-degree manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide. The judge dismissed the manslaughter charge on Friday after jurors said they could not come to a unanimous decision. The jury could only consider the negligent homicide charge if Penny was cleared of manslaughter. Word of the verdict came after jurors deliberated for more than 20 hours. Penny appeared to smile, as his attorneys hugged each other. \"We couldn't be more pleased that a jury of Danny's peers acquitted him of any wrongdoing. And now New Yorkers can take some comfort in knowing that we can continue to stand up for one another without sacrificing our rights or our freedoms,\" his lawyers said in a statement. His attorneys later shared a photo on social media showing them raise a glass at a bar after the verdict. CBS News New York's Alice Gainer was inside the courtroom when the decision came down. She reported it was chaos, as some cheered in support of Penny, and Neely's father, Andre Zachery, had to leave the room because he stood up and was heard swearing. Zachery told CBS News New York, \"My son didn't have to go through this. I didn't have to go through this, either. It hurts. It really, really hurts,\" adding, \"What's going to happen to us now? Had enough of this. System is rigged. Come on, people. Let's do something about this.\" Penny faced a maximum possible sentence of 15 years in prison on the manslaughter charge, or four years on the negligent homicide charge. There was no minimum sentence. Protesters lined up outside the courthouse Monday, chanting \"Justice for Jordan Neely!\" Inside, Penny's defense team asked for a mistrial and once again was denied. The defense also raised concerns that jurors could potentially hear some of what the demonstrators were saying. They said the demonstrators were using megaphones and bullhorns, chanting things like, \"Murdered!\" and \"Subway strangler!\" The judge agreed he also heard the commotion and reminded the jury to ignore things they may hear or read about the case. One activist who had been outside demonstrating every morning was inside and yelled something at Penny along the lines of \"It's a small world, buddy.\" \"Our call to action is to take care of each other. We can't rely on outside people. If we see someone asking for food, we have to take the responsibility to give it to them. If we see someone cold, to give them a coat. If we see someone going through something, to ask them if they're OK,\" Donte Mills, attorney for the Neely family, said during a news conference outside the courthouse. \"That's how we help each other, because we can't rely on the system to do it for us.\" Eric Garner's mother, Gwen Carr, also spoke outside the courthouse, saying, \"No one deserves to be choked to death,\" adding, \"I tell this family, do not give up, because that's what they want you to do. They want to discourage you, just like they tried to discourage me. Ten years later, I'm still fighting.\" The Rev. Al Sharpton, who spoke at Neely's funeral, put out a statement, which read, in part, \"This verdict represents the blatant legalization of civilian vigilantism, sending a dangerous message that citizens can now take matters into their own hands, even if it leads to someone's death.\" \"It was foolish of us to think that a Black man would get justice in a system that is designed to keep him oppressed,\" added Chivona Newsome, co-founder of Black Lives Matter Greater New York. The verdict drew praise from Vice President-elect JD Vance and New York Congressman Mike Lawler, who both criticized Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg for prosecuting Penny. Bragg released a statement following the verdict, saying: \"As with every case, we followed the facts and the evidence from beginning to end. A Grand Jury voted to indict, and the Office carefully presented this case to a trial jury. \"Over the course of the trial, we introduced medical records, videos, bodycam footage, and testimony from over 30 witnesses, including from the City's Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. \"The jury carefully deliberated for four days. They requested readbacks of testimony and asked for video footage to re-watch, as well as written definitions of the law. Their lengthy deliberation - and the totality of the facts and the evidence -- underscored why this case was put in front of a jury of Mr. Penny's peers. \"The jury has now spoken. At the Manhattan D.A.'s Office we deeply respect the jury process and we respect their verdict. \"Unfortunately, over the duration of this trial, talented career prosecutors and their family members were besieged with hate and threats -- on social media, by phone and over email. Simply put, this is unacceptable, and everyone, no matter your opinion on this case, should condemn it. These are prosecutors who have dedicated decades of their lives to public service and to the safety of Manhattan. I am grateful to them, as well as to the NYPD for their hard work and commitment on not only this matter, but for all they do on behalf of New Yorkers. I also want to thank Judge Wiley for presiding over this case. Finally, I want to thank the members of the jury who took time out of their lives to diligently evaluate the evidence.\" Mayor Eric Adams was asked by reporters if he thinks the verdict says anything about the mood of the city, and if he feels like it could open the door for more of these interactions of people exacting their own justice. \"Good question. And I'll answer the latter first. Of what you see, of what people often do, a lot of people make interpretations, you know, about trials, but juries are in the courtroom. They're hearing every piece of evidence, they are hearing the testimonies. They have to make the decision. And that's the system that we have,\" he replied. \"And actually, it is probably one of the best systems on the globe. And I think the jury's heard the evidence and made a determination based on the evidence that they heard. And the ... does it impact what's going to happen throughout the city that people are not going to take action or going to take action? I don't think it does. \"I think that oftentimes people make these decisions when they are in the midst of it. And there's a desire of New Yorkers to help out those who are in need. There's a desire of New Yorkers is to always respond when they believe it's necessary. And I don't think that is going to change in any way. This is not the first time, and I'm sure it's not going to be the last time that individuals take actions and people are going to question about those actions that happened. \"But at the cornerstone and at the heart of this is that, of this young man, like so many others that are on our subway systems, I made it clear that's not a place to sleep, to live. That's not a place to be. And when they need help, we need to give them the help of that they have.\" In order to be convicted of manslaughter, prosecutors had to prove: In order to be convicted of criminally negligent homicide, prosecutors had to prove: Police and witnesses said Neely, 30, boarded an F train in SoHo on May 1, 2023 and began shouting, throwing things and making threats. Penny, a passenger on the train, approached Neely from behind and tried to restrain him. Video shows Penny holding Neely in a chokehold on the floor of the train for several minutes until Neely stopped moving. After police arrived, officers administered Narcan to Neely, performed CPR and used an AED, but were unable to revive him. Neely was pronounced dead at the scene. Police said Neely did not have any weapons on him. A medical examiner ruled Neely's death a homicide three days later, with the cause as compression of the neck. Toxicology reports showed Neely had synthetic marijuana in his system when he died. Neely was a street performer and Michael Jackson impersonator who was experiencing homelessness and had struggled with mental illness after his mother was murdered in 2007. Video of Penny holding Neely in the chokehold was widely circulated online. Neely's death sparked protests across New York City, with many raising concerns about the need for better mental health care in the city, and Neely's family called for Penny's arrest. Penny turned himself in on May 12, 2023, and was initially charged with second-degree manslaughter and released on $100,000 bail. He was arraigned in June and pleaded not guilty to criminally negligent homicide and second-degree manslaughter. Penny defended his actions, saying he was trying to protect other passengers on the train by restraining Neely. In late October 2024, a 12-person jury and four alternates were selected and sworn in. They included seven women and five men, with at least seven White people, one Hispanic person, one Filipino person, one Black person and one person of Middle Eastern descent. The trial began Nov. 1. The prosecution argued in their opening statements that Penny, though he had good intentions, recklessly used excessive force without trying any other means of deescalating the situation. The defense, meanwhile, argued Penny was protecting other passengers and there was no other way to deescalate due to Neely's behavior. Jurors heard testimony from multiple witnesses, including police officers, MTA employees, passengers on the train and a bystander who helped Penny restrain Neely. Penny's Marine Corps martial arts instructor and the medical examiner who performed Neely's autopsy also took the stand. The defense called Penny's mother and platoon sergeants as character witnesses, along with a forensic pathologist who said he disagreed with the medical examiner's cause of death. Jurors began their deliberations last Tuesday. They sent two notes back to the judge. The first requested a readback of part of the judge's instructions. The second note asked the judge if they could return for deliberations Wednesday, which is a day they would normally have had off. The judge approved that request. Wednesday morning, jurors sent another note, asking to see a video compilation of police bodycams from the incident, as well as footage of Penny's police station interview. Jurors also asked for readback of the medical examiner's cross-examination. Friday morning, on the fourth day of deliberations, they sent a note to the judge indicating they couldn't reach a unanimous verdict on his manslaughter charge.

                "title": "Daniel Penny found not guilty in chokehold death of Jordan Neely",
                "content": "Morning Rundown: CEO murder suspect charged, why Assad's ouster is devastating for Iran, and how the Mets justify Juan Soto's $765M deal Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Daniel Penny was acquitted Monday of criminally negligent homicide in the chokehold death of Jordan Neely, a 30-year-old homeless man with a history of mental illness whose final moments on a New York City subway train were captured on bystander video that set off weeks of protests and drew national attention. The decision, on the fifth day of deliberations, came after the jury deadlocked Friday on the more serious charge of manslaughter, leading the judge to dismiss it. Penny faced up to four years in prison. As the jury foreperson read the “not guilty” verdict, some observers in the courtroom applauded. Others began to audibly sob and yell, including Neely’s father, Andre Zachery, who was escorted out. “This is America. That is the sound of Black pain,” one person said outside of the courtroom in Lower Manhattan to the reaction. Chants of “no justice, no peace,” could be heard echoing from outside. The case divided people in New York — and beyond — in some cases along political and racial lines. Neely was Black. Penny is white. Some people viewed Penny as callous and his actions as criminal on the day he encountered Neely, who had been shouting and acting erratically when he boarded a subway train in Manhattan on May 1, 2023. Others contend Penny was selfless in his attempt to protect fellow passengers. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said he respected the jury's verdict. The jury deliberated for about an hour on the criminally negligent homicide charge after about four days spent considering the manslaughter charge. “Their lengthy deliberation — and the totality of the facts and the evidence — underscored why this case was put in front of a jury of Mr. Penny's peers,” Bragg said in a statement. The anonymous jury, made up of seven women and five men, were told before they began deliberating that they had to come to a unanimous decision on the top charge of manslaughter in the second degree before moving on to consider criminally negligent homicide. But Judge Maxwell Wiley changed that order Friday after jurors twice sent a note saying they could not reach an agreement. The judge had also instructed jurors to decide whether Penny’s actions caused Neely’s death and, if so, whether he had acted recklessly and in an unjustified manner. Before he encountered Penny, Neely, a former Michael Jackson impersonator, ranted about being hungry and thirsty and said that he wanted to return to jail and didn’t care if he lived or died, witnesses testified. Penny, 26, a former Marine and Long Island native, placed Neely in a chokehold that prosecutors said lasted almost six minutes. A New York City medical examiner ruled that Neely died from compression to his neck as a result of the chokehold. Neely’s uncle, Christopher Neely, said he was “taken aback” as the verdict was announced because he thought the jury would at least convict him on the lesser charge. “At least give him a charge because it should be some type of penalty that should have been been handed down to Danny Penny period. They gave him no penalty, and I feel like the jury gave up on us,” Neely said. Donte Mills, a lawyer representing Neely's family, said at a news conference that he was disheartened by the verdict Monday, as supporters held up a picture of Neely dressed as Jackson. Mills asked that Neely's death have meaning, and urged that others, instead of becoming physical with someone who may be hungry, offer them food. “He had a muffin in his pocket,” Mills said of what police later discovered in Neely's jacket. “Jordan just wanted someone to acknowledge him on the train, but instead, he was choked to death.” Lawyers for Penny could not immediately be reached for comment about the verdict, but had earlier expressed concern Monday to the judge that the jury could be influenced by the demonstrators' chanting coming from outside the courthouse. During the trial, Penny’s attorneys told jurors that he stepped in because he believed Neely might attack other passengers and he intended only to restrain him until police arrived, which Penny also told police. They also argued that Neely was not killed by the chokehold and that it was impossible to measure how much pressure Penny had applied. A forensic pathologist hired by the defense testified that Neely died from a combination of his schizophrenia, synthetic marijuana, sickle cell trait and the struggle from being in Penny’s restraint. But the medical examiner who performed the autopsy on Neely, Dr. Cynthia Harris, told jurors it was her medical opinion “that there are no alternative reasonable explanations” for his death and that those proposed by the defense were “so improbable — that it stands shoulder to shoulder with impossibility.” During cross-examination, one of Penny’s attorneys, Steven Raiser sought to cast doubt on Harris’ testimony about how she and her colleagues had come to a unanimous decision as to Neely’s cause of death. Raiser suggested that they had failed to consider all the facts before making that determination. He revisited that claim in his closing argument last week. “I submit to you there was a rush to judgment, based on something other than medical science,” he told jurors. The case also spurred debates about safety within the city’s subway system and failures in addressing homelessness and mental illness, both of which Neely had struggled with. Jumaane Williams, a Black Democrat who is New York City’s public advocate, was among those who questioned why police let Penny go after questioning him at a precinct hours after Neely’s killing. New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, also a Democrat, said Neely had been “murdered.” Prominent Republicans like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Matt Gaetz praised Penny and promoted a fundraiser for his legal fund, which has raised more than $3 million. His defense team includes Thomas Kenniff, a Republican who ran unsuccessfully for Manhattan District Attorney in 2021. Vice President-elect JD Vance said on X in response to the verdict that “justice was done in this case. It was a scandal Penny was ever prosecuted in the first place.” Prosecutors did not dispute that Neely’s actions on the train scared many of the passengers or that he was on synthetic cannabinoids, which were found in his system. In her opening statement, Dafna Yoran, an assistant prosecutor with the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office, said that Neely had “demanded to be seen” and that despite his not having touched anyone and not having displayed a weapon or threatened to use one, many people in the subway car were frightened of what he might do. She has said Penny’s “initial intent was even laudable,” but that he was reckless when he continued to choke Neely even after he posed no threat, including after the train doors had opened at the next station and passengers could exit. For some of that time, she said and video showed, two other men helped restrain Neely. One of those men testified that he believed Penny had held the chokehold for too long. At times, Yoran said, he even ignored the pleas of bystanders to let Neely go. In her closing argument, Yoran said that “no one had to die” and that Penny was not justified in his use of physical deadly force. “You obviously cannot kill someone because they are crazy and ranting and looking menacing,” Yoran told jurors in her closing argument. “No matter what it is that they are saying.” She also said that Penny “could have easily restrained” Neely “without choking him to death.” In his closing argument, Raiser prompted jurors to imagine that they were on the train the day Neely boarded “filled with rage and not afraid of any consequences.” “With you sitting much as you are now in this tightly confined space, looking up at Mr. Neely,” he said. “You have very little room to move and nowhere to run.” “Danny,” as the defense attorneys referred to Penny throughout the trial, “put his life on the line” and stepped up in the absence of police, Raiser said. But Yoran challenged the portrayal of Penny as a self-sacrificing and benevolent subway rider. In her opening statement she said that Penny failed to acknowledge Neely’s humanity. She continued that thread in her closing argument, playing video of Penny twice referring to Neely as a “crackhead” in an interview with police and telling jurors that he never asked about Neely’s condition. “There is something else that is glaringly missing from his statement. Any regret. Any remorse. Any self reflection,” she said. She added: “He never expresses any sorrow about the man’s death.” During deliberations, jurors asked to rewatch bystander videos of Penny restraining Neely, responding officers’ body camera videos and video of Penny’s subsequent interview with two police detectives at a precinct. They also asked to rehear the medical examiner’s testimony about issuing a death certificate before Neely’s full toxicology reports were completed. They also asked for the judge to read back the definitions of recklessness and criminal negligence and to have the definitions in writing. Penny chose not to testify. During the trial, jurors heard from more than 40 witnesses — subway passengers who witnessed Penny restrain Neely, police officers who responded to the scene, a Marine Corps instructor who taught Penny various chokeholds, the two pathologists, a psychiatric expert and six character witnesses, who included two Marines, Penny’s mother and one of his sisters. On Wednesday, Neely’s father sued Penny accusing him of negligent contact, assault and battery that caused Neely’s death. The civil suit was filed in New York state’s Supreme Court, a trial-level court in New York state. Janelle Griffith is a national reporter for NBC News focusing on issues of race and policing.

                "title": "Daniel Penny found not guilty in Jordan Neely's death",
                "content": "Marine veteran Daniel Penny was acquitted by a Manhattan jury Monday in the chokehold death of Jordan Neely — a lightning-rod case that cast a light on the mayhem plaguing Big Apple subways. Jurors cleared Penny, a 26-year-old Long Islander, of criminally negligent homicide after the caught-on-camera fatal encounter on an uptown F train last year sparked fierce debate about mental illness, public safety and vigilantism. A suited-up Penny, who remained stone-faced for much of the four-week trial, broke out a huge smile as his not guilty verdict was read out — prompting both applause and anger inside the courtroom as the high-profile case came to an end. Penny “finally got the justice he deserved,” one of his lawyers, Thomas Kenniff, said while celebrating with him at a bar in downtown Manhattan just hours after the verdict. “I’m not surprised in the sense that Day 1 we knew that we believed he would be exonerated because the evidence overwhelmingly supported that.” The verdict, which followed more than 20 hours of jury deliberations, came after the more serious manslaughter charge was dismissed by prosecutors last week after the 12 jurors — seven women and five men — deadlocked on that rap. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg — who quickly faced calls to resign for bringing the case against Penny in the first place — said he respected the jury’s ruling and insisted that prosecutors “followed the facts and the evidence from beginning to end.” “It really, really hurts,” Neely’s father, Andre Zachary, said after the verdict. “I had enough of this. The system is rigged.” Follow The Post’s live blog for the latest updates on Daniel Penny’s not guilty verdict Over the course of the four-week trial, defense attorneys painted Penny as a hero who was “fully justified” when he took down Neely — a 30-year-old, troubled homeless man who witnesses said was menacing others and making threats — on an uptown F train on May 1, 2023. They questioned, too, whether there was sufficient evidence that the chokehold caused Neely’s death — arguing he died from a mix of schizophrenia, drug use, a genetic condition and the struggle with the Marine vet. Prosecutors tried to convince jurors that Penny was “criminally reckless” and went “way too far” while holding Neely in the chokehold for roughly six minutes — even after he appeared to stop moving on his own. After watching footage of the fatal encounter more than a dozen times and hearing testimony from 40 witnesses, including terrified straphangers, jurors ultimately found there wasn’t proof beyond a reasonable doubt that Penny wasn’t justified in his actions. Penny could have faced up to four years behind bars if convicted of the lesser charge, and up to 15 on second-degree manslaughter. “I think the jurors all put themselves in that subway car, heard the fear of the passengers and identified with it — and rejected the criminalization of the actions Mr. Penny took in the face of clear danger,” Thomas J. Curran, a former assistant DA in Manhattan, told The Post. “This entire incident was a tragedy all around. The social infrastructure our city maintains to support and aid troubled persons like Jordan Neely clearly failed him. Mr. Penny will forever have the tragic death of Mr. Neely as part of him and his life. But the tragedy that was the death of Mr. Neely does not mean that a crime occurred. Trying to make it a crime was a mistake from the start.” Arthur Aidala, a former Brooklyn prosecutor-turned-criminal lawyer, speculated that the verdict boiled down to the term “reasonableness.” “Was it reasonable for Penny to act the way he did to have the fear that he did, for himself or a third party, regarding self-defense,” Aidala said. “And I guess once they took manslaughter in the second degree off the table, they pretty swiftly reached a verdict regarding criminally negligent homicide.” News of the verdict, meanwhile, sparked an immediate reaction across the Big Apple — and the rest of the country — as some lawmakers claimed the DA’s office politicized the case and tried to turn Penny into a villain as crime spirals on the streets and underground. “There are people in the [DA’s] office who are quietly relieved that he was found not guilty,” a source inside Bragg’s office told The Post. “You can’t say they are happy because someone did die, but they don’t think he was tried because he committed a crime, but rather because of politics, which should never happen.” Others, including Mayor Eric Adams, argued that the case highlighted a broken system that failed Neely and others suffering from mental health issues or drug dependency. “Jordan should not have had to die, and, I strongly believe as I’ve stated from day one, that we have a mental health system that is broken,” Hizzoner said when asked if the verdict was a reflection of New Yorkers being fed up with the system. “New Yorkers have always been tired of things that allow people who commit violent acts to be part of a revolving-door system,” he said.

                "title": "Daniel Penny Verdict: Not Guilty in Jordan Neely Killing",
                "content": "By Jon Blistein Daniel Penny, the Marine veteran who killed Jordan Neely, a homeless man known as a Michael Jackson impersonator around New York City, was found not guilty on a charge of criminally negligent homicide. The verdict was reached after four days of deliberations, during which the more serious charge against Penny, second-degree manslaughter, was dismissed. Last Friday morning, Dec. 6, after three days of deliberations, the jury sent Judge Maxwell Wiley a note saying they were deadlocked on the manslaughter charge. While Wiley encouraged the jury to keep deliberating, that afternoon they sent a second note saying they still could not reach an unanimous decision. Penny’s lawyers argued the impasse called for a mistrial. But Wiley instead granted a motion from the prosecution to dismiss the manslaughter charge and allow deliberations to continue on the criminally negligent homicide charge. The verdict delivered Monday, Dec. 9, found that Penny’s actions were not criminal when he held Neely in a chokehold for several minutes on the floor of a subway car on May 1, 2023. After the verdict was read, per The New York Times, Penny’s lawyer, Thomas A. Kenniff, reportedly hugged Penny. Neely’s father, Andre Zachery, reportedly started yelling at Penny’s supporters, and the judge had to ask him to leave the room. Penny was accused of killing Neely, who was unhoused and had a history of mental health issues, on May 1, 2023. Neely boarded an uptown F train in Manhattan and reportedly started yelling and acting erratically. Some witnesses said he screamed that he was hungry, that he wanted to go back to jail, and that he did not care if he lived or died. Some on the subway car claimed Neely threatened to hurt others on the train. Others said they didn’t hear Neely make any threats. Penny came up behind Neely and put him in a chokehold that lasted about six minutes. According to reports, Neely stopped moving about five minutes into Penny’s restraint. When police arrived on the scene at the next subway station, Neely reportedly had a faint pulse but was not breathing. Police tried CPR but were unsuccessful. Neely was pronounced dead at a hospital about an hour later. Editor’s picks The 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time The 250 Greatest Guitarists of All Time The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time The 200 Greatest Singers of All Time While Penny was taken into custody and questioned, he was ultimately released. On May 4, the medical examiner ruled Neely’s death a homicide, saying he died of compression to his neck caused by the chokehold. Prosecutors finally brought charges against Penny on May 12, 11 days after Neely’s death. Neely pleaded not guilty to charges of second-degree manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide. For their case, prosecutors did not try to argue that Penny intentionally killed Neely. In fact, during opening arguments, Assistant District Attorney Dana Yoran said Penny’s initial efforts to restrain Neely may have been “even laudable” (via The New York Times). But prosecutors said Penny acted carelessly and should’ve known his actions could have resulted in Neely’s death. They pointed to his Marine training, that he continued to hold Neely in a chokehold even after Neely had stopped moving, and even cited others on the train who warned Penny that he might kill Neely if he did not let go. “Under the law, deadly physical force such as a chokehold is permitted only when it is absolutely necessary, and only for as long as it is absolutely necessary,” Yoran said in her opening statement. “And here, the defendant went way too far.” For his defense, Penny’s lawyers claimed their client’s actions were a justified use of force to defend himself or others on the train. They also tried to contend that despite the medical examiner’s ruling, it was not Penny’s chokehold that killed Neely, but rather Neely’s schizophrenia, marijuana use, and sickle cell trait that led to his death.

                "title": "Cincinnati Bengals - Wikipedia",
                "content": "National Football League (1970–present) The Cincinnati Bengals are a professional American football team based in Cincinnati. The Bengals compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the American Football Conference (AFC) North division. The team plays its home games at Paycor Stadium in downtown Cincinnati.[7] Former Cleveland Browns head coach Paul Brown began planning for the creation of the Bengals franchise in 1965, and Cincinnati's city council approved the construction of Riverfront Stadium in 1966. Finally, in 1967, the Bengals were founded when a group headed by Brown received franchise approval by the American Football League (AFL) on May 23, 1967, and they began play in the 1968 season.[8] Brown was the Bengals' head coach from their inception to 1975. After being dismissed as the Browns' head coach by Art Modell (who had purchased a majority interest in the team in 1961) in January 1963, Brown had shown interest in establishing another NFL franchise in Ohio and looked at both Cincinnati and Columbus. He ultimately chose the former when a deal between the city, Hamilton County, and Major League Baseball's Cincinnati Reds (who were seeking a replacement for the obsolete Crosley Field) was struck that resulted in an agreement to build a multipurpose stadium which could host both baseball and football games. Due to the impending merger of the AFL and the NFL, which was scheduled to take full effect in the 1970 season, Brown agreed to join the AFL as its 10th and final franchise. The Bengals, like the other former AFL teams, were assigned to the AFC following the merger. Cincinnati was also selected because, like their neighbors the Reds, they could draw from several large neighboring cities (Louisville and Lexington, Kentucky; Columbus, Dayton, and Springfield, Ohio) that are all no more than 110 miles (180 km) away from downtown Cincinnati, along with Indianapolis, until the Baltimore Colts relocated there prior to the 1984 NFL season.[9] After Paul Brown's death in 1991, controlling interest in the team was inherited by his son, Mike Brown. In 2011, Brown purchased shares of the team owned by the estate of co-founder Austin Knowlton and is now the majority owner of the Bengals franchise.[7] The Bengals won the AFC championship in 1981, 1988, and in 2021. After each of the 1981 and 1988 conference championships, they went on to lose to the San Francisco 49ers, in Super Bowls XVI and XXIII. The team struggled greatly in the 1990s and the early 2000s, during which time they were sometimes referred to disparagingly as \"The Bungles,\" a term coined by Steelers broadcaster Myron Cope.[10] [11][12][13][14] Following the 1990 season, the team went 14 years without making the NFL playoffs or posting a winning record. The Bengals went through several head coaches in that period, and many of their top draft picks did not pan out. The team's fortunes improved in the mid-2000s and into the mid-2010s, which saw them become more consistent postseason contenders, but they continued to struggle in the playoffs.[15][16][17][18] The turning point for the Bengals was during the 2021 season, when they won their first playoff game in 31 years and advanced to the first of two consecutive AFC Championship games. In 2021, they defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 27–24 in overtime and advanced to Super Bowl LVI, their first appearance in the Super Bowl in 33 years, where they lost to the Los Angeles Rams 23–20.[19] They advanced to the AFC Championship game again in 2022 but lost to the eventual Super Bowl champions, the Chiefs, by a score of 23-20 (the same exact score as in Super Bowl LVI).[20] The team does not have an official general manager. However, Duke Tobin is often, though incorrectly, referred to as the Bengals' general manager because he handles most personnel decisions.[21] In a 2011 survey, Brown was rated as among the worst team owners in American professional sports.[22] In a Forbes article on the value of NFL teams as of August 2022, the Cincinnati Bengals were ranked last with a value of $3 billion.[23] In 1967, an ownership group led by Paul Brown was granted a franchise in the American Football League. Brown named the team the Bengals in order \"to give it a link with past professional football in Cincinnati\".[24] Another Cincinnati Bengals team had existed in the city and played in three previous American Football Leagues[25] from 1937 to 1942. The city's world-renowned zoo was also home to a rare white Bengal tiger. In a possible insult to Art Modell – or possibly as a homage to the Massillon Tigers – Brown chose the exact shade of orange used by his former team. He added black as the secondary color. Brown chose a very simple logo: the word \"BENGALS\" in black lettering. One of the potential helmet designs Brown rejected was a striped motif that was similar to the helmets adopted by the team in 1981 still in use today; however, that design featured yellow stripes on a turquoise helmet which were more uniform in width.[26] The Bengals began play in the 1968 season. In 1966, the American Football League agreed to a merger with its older and more established rival, the National Football League.[27] Among the terms of the merger was that the AFL was permitted to add one additional franchise; the NFL wanted an even number of clubs in the merged league, so a team needed to be added to bring the number of clubs in the merged league to 26 teams. For the AFL, a key motive behind their agreement to accept a new team was that the guarantee of an eventual place in the NFL meant the league could charge a steep expansion fee of $10 million – 400 times the $25,000 the original eight owners paid when they founded the league in 1960. The cash from the new team provided the American Football League with the funds needed to pay the indemnities required to be paid by the AFL to the NFL, as stipulated by the merger agreement. Prior to the merger's announcement, Brown had not seriously considered joining the American Football League and was not a supporter of what he openly regarded to be an inferior competition, once famously stating that \"I didn't pay ten million dollars to be in the AFL.\"[28] However, with the announcement of the merger, Brown realized that the AFL expansion franchise would likely be his only realistic path back into the NFL in the short to medium term, and ultimately acquiesced to joining the AFL after learning that the team was guaranteed to become an NFL franchise after the merger was completed in 1970. There was also a major problem: Major League Baseball's Cincinnati Reds were in need of a facility to replace Crosley Field, which they had used since 1912. By this time, the small park was antiquated and rundown, and parking issues had plagued the city since the early 1950s, while the park also lacked modern amenities – issues that were exacerbated by the Mill Creek Expressway (I-75) project that ran alongside the park. While New York City – which had lost both its National League teams in 1957 after the Dodgers relocated to Los Angeles, and the Giants relocated to San Francisco – had actively courted Reds owner Powel Crosley to relocate his team there, Crosley was adamant that the Reds remain in Cincinnati and tolerated the worsening problems with the Crosley Field location. With assistance from Ohio governor Jim Rhodes, Hamilton County and the Cincinnati city council agreed to build a single multi-purpose facility on the dilapidated riverfront section of the city: the new facility had to be ready by the opening of the 1970 NFL season, and was officially named Riverfront Stadium. With the completion of the merger in 1970, the Cleveland Browns were one of three NFL teams that agreed to move to the AFL-based American Football Conference to give both conferences an equal number of teams and were placed in the AFC Central, the same division as the Bengals. An instant rivalry was born, fueled initially by Paul Brown's rivalry with Art Modell.[29][30] For their first two seasons, the Bengals played at Nippert Stadium, the current home of the University of Cincinnati Bearcats.[31] The team held training camp at Wilmington College in Wilmington, through the 1968 preseason. The team finished its first season with a 3–11 record[32] and running back Paul Robinson, who rushed for 1,023 yards, and was named the AFL Rookie of the Year.[33] Founder Paul Brown coached the team for its first eight seasons.[34] One of Brown's college draft strategies was to draft players from non-traditional football schools. Punter/wide receiver Pat McInally attended Harvard University, and linebacker Reggie Williams attended Dartmouth College and served on Cincinnati city council while on the Bengals' roster. Because of this policy, many former players went on to have successful careers in commentary and broadcasting as well as the arts. In addition, Brown had a knack for locating and recognizing pro football talent in unusual places.[35] In 1970, the Bengals moved to play at Riverfront Stadium, a home they shared with the Cincinnati Reds until the team moved to Paul Brown Stadium in 2000. Notable players of the 1970 team included Virgil Carter, Chip Meyers, Jack Meckstroth, Bob Trumpy, and Lemar Parrish. Virgil Carter threw for 1,647 yards. Chip Myers paced all receivers, catching 32 passes for 542 yards. Bob Trumpy contributed to the receiving game, too.[36] The team reached the playoffs three times during that decade, but could not win any of those postseason games. In 1975, the team posted an 11–3 record, giving them what remains the highest winning percentage (.786) in franchise history. But it only earned them a wild card spot in the playoffs, behind the 12–2 Pittsburgh Steelers, who went on to win the Super Bowl; the Bengals lost to the Oakland Raiders 31–28 in the divisional playoffs.[37] The Bengals reached the Super Bowl twice during the 1980s – in Super Bowl XVI and Super Bowl XXIII – and lost against the San Francisco 49ers both times.[38][39] The team appeared in the playoffs in 1990, making it to the second round before losing to the Los Angeles Raiders.[40] Before the following season got underway, Paul Brown died at age 82.[41] Due to declining health, he had already transferred control to his son, Mike Brown, but was reported to still influence the daily operations of the team.[42] The Bengals' fortunes changed for the worse as the team posted 14 consecutive non-winning seasons and were saddled with numerous draft busts. The Bengals began to emerge from that dismal period into a new era of increased consistency, however, after the team finished with its worst record in team history, 2–14, which led to the hiring of Marvin Lewis as head coach in 2003.[43] Carson Palmer, the future star quarterback, was drafted in 2003, but did not play a snap that whole season, as Jon Kitna had a comeback year (voted NFL Comeback Player of the Year).[44][45] Despite Kitna's success, Palmer was promoted to starting quarterback the following season.[46] The team finished with an 8–8 record and missed the postseason in 2004.[47] Under Palmer, the team advanced to the playoffs for the first time since 1990 losing in the Wild Card Roundto the Pittsburgh Steelers 31–17 in the 2005 season, which also was the first time the team had a winning percentage above .500 since 1990.[48][49][50] The Bengals returned to the playoffs again in 2009 in a season that included the franchise's first-ever division sweep. This was especially impressive since two of the teams swept by the Bengals – the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Baltimore Ravens – had made it to the AFC Championship Game the previous season. Marvin Lewis was rewarded for the accomplishment with the NFL Coach of the Year Award.[51] In the 2010 season, the Bengals posted a 4–12 record.[52] Following the disappointing 2010 season, quarterback Carson Palmer demanded to be traded. When the Bengals refused to do so, Palmer announced his retirement from the NFL.[53] He later was moved at the NFL trade deadline to the Oakland Raiders.[54] In the 2011 NFL draft, the Bengals selected wide receiver A. J. Green in the first round and quarterback Andy Dalton in the second round.[55] The Bengals improved to 9–7 in the 2011 season, and clinched a playoff spot.[56] Dalton and Green became the most prolific rookie WR-QB duo in history, connecting 65 times for 1,057 yards. However, they lost to the Houston Texans, 31–10, in the Wild Card round.[57] In the 2012 season, the Bengals clinched a playoff spot once more with a win over the Pittsburgh Steelers, going to the playoffs in back-to-back years for the first time since 1982.[58] However, the Bengals faced the Texans in the first round yet again and took another early exit, losing 19–13.[59] In the 2013 season, for the third straight year, the Bengals clinched a playoff berth and also won the AFC North, finishing with an 11–5 record.[60] But once again, the Bengals were defeated in the wild card round, this time by the San Diego Chargers, 27–10.[61] Most of the blame was put on Andy Dalton, who threw two interceptions and fumbled on a forward dive. This made the Bengals 0–5 in playoff games since Mike Brown took over as owner. The 2014 season started well, with the Bengals winning their first three contests against the Baltimore Ravens, Atlanta Falcons, and Tennessee Titans. However, they lost their Week 5 road matchup with the New England Patriots, 43–17. An overtime tie with the Carolina Panthers and a shutout loss to the Indianapolis Colts followed the primetime loss to the Patriots. Finishing the season 10–5–1 as the fifth seed, they lost to the Colts, 26–10, in the first round of the playoffs.[62][63] This was the first time the franchise made the playoffs four straight seasons. In 2015, the Bengals got out to a franchise-best 8–0 start with a 31–10 win over the Cleveland Browns.[64] Unfortunately, in Week 14 they would lose starting quarterback Andy Dalton to injury. He would not return that season, leaving A. J. McCarron to start under center. The Bengals finished with a franchise record-tying 12–4 mark.[65] Additionally, they lost to the division rival Pittsburgh Steelers, 18–16, in the Wild Card round in the final minute, making them the first franchise in NFL history to lose five straight opening-round playoff games.[66] This frustration continued in 2016 for the Bengals: they finished the 2016 campaign with a 6–9–1 record, losing several key players to injury, including A. J. Green, Giovani Bernard, and Jeremy Hill.[67][68] They missed the playoffs for the first time since 2010, marking the first time Andy Dalton missed the playoffs as the Bengals' starting quarterback. One notable game was a 27–27 tie against the Washington Redskins which was played in London in 2016.[69] Following a rough 2016 season, the Bengals looked forward into 2017. However, after starting 0–3, the Bengals never found their footing. At one point in the season, the Bengals were 5–9. There were rumors that Marvin Lewis would not return for the next season as the Bengals' head coach. However, after two come-from-behind victories over the Lions and Ravens that eliminated both teams from the playoffs, the Bengals finished 7–9.[70] The final two games were convincing enough for owner Mike Brown to give Lewis a new two-year contract.[71] The 2018 campaign began with promise for the Bengals under Lewis. Cincinnati began the season with a 4–1 record with impressive wins over the Colts, Ravens, Falcons, and Dolphins. However, the Bengals suffered many setbacks after the hot start: defensive coordinator Teryl Austin was fired mid-season because of defensive woes,[72] A. J. Green was injured and officially out for the last four games, and Andy Dalton injured his thumb in the Bengals' first game against the Browns and replaced by Jeff Driskel for the rest of the season.[73][74] The Bengals ended 2018 with a final record of 6–10 and finished last place in the AFC North.[75] On December 31, 2018, with one year to go on his contract, Lewis and the Bengals mutually parted ways after three straight losing seasons under his watch.[76] In 2019, they hired head coach Zac Taylor.[77] The 2019 campaign started off with reasonable success, with the Bengals barely losing to Seattle 21–20 at CenturyLink Field; but what started with promise ended in disaster.[78] The Bengals then lost 10 more games and were 0–11 heading into December 2019. To open the month of December, they got their first win of the season against the Jets, 22–6, in Cincinnati.[79] They eventually lost to the Patriots and then to the Dolphins, 38–35, in overtime after Dalton led the team back from 23 points down in the fourth quarter. With the loss to the Dolphins, the Bengals officially clinched the No. 1 overall pick in the 2020 NFL draft.[80] They capped off the season with a win against the Cleveland Browns, finishing 2–14, equaling the 2002 season as the team's worst record in history.[81][82] In 2020, the Bengals improved under rookies Joe Burrow and Tee Higgins.[83] Starting the season with a 2–5–1 record going into the bye week, including an overtime tie to the Philadelphia Eagles. Going into Week 11 facing the Washington Football Team, they lost Joe Burrow to a season-ending knee injury that all but ended their season, only winning two more contests against the Pittsburgh Steelers and Houston Texans.[84] Finishing the season 4–11–1.[85] In 2021, the Bengals won the AFC North with a 10–7 record, which included dominant sweeps of the rival Pittsburgh Steelers and Baltimore Ravens.[86] Led by Joe Burrow, who was playing in his first full season after recovering from his devastating knee injury in Week 11 of his rookie season and rookie receiver, and Burrow's college teammate at LSU, Ja'Marr Chase, Cincinnati would win the AFC North for the first time since 2015. They beat the Kansas City Chiefs, 34–31, in a Week 17 thriller to clinch the division. They then won their first playoff game since the 1990 season, beating the Las Vegas Raiders, 26–19, in the Wild Card round.[87] After that, they upset the top-seeded Tennessee Titans, 19–16, when Evan McPherson kicked a game-winning 52-yard field goal. A week later, they advanced to their first Super Bowl since 1989 when McPherson kicked a 33-yard field goal in overtime to cap off a comeback from being down 21–3 and shock the No. 2 seed Chiefs, 27–24. They lost a close Super Bowl to the Los Angeles Rams in Super Bowl LVI, 23–20.[88] In Week 1 of the 2022 NFL season, the Bengals lost, 23–20, to the Pittsburgh Steelers in overtime, breaking a three-game winning streak the Bengals had against Pittsburgh. After falling to a 4–4 record in Week 8, the Bengals proceeded to win 8 straight games to tie a franchise-record for single-season wins and earn a 3 seed in the AFC playoffs.[89][90] They defeated divisional rival Baltimore in the first round 24–17, behind a 98-yard fumble recovery returned for a touchdown by Sam Hubbard.[91][92] Despite missing three starting offensive linemen, the Bengals followed that up with a decisive 27–10 road win over the favored Buffalo Bills to reach a second straight AFC Championship appearance for the first time in franchise history.[93] Once again, they faced the Kansas City Chiefs in the Championship Game, but this time they lost 23–20, in another thrilling game.[94] In the 2023 season, during their Week 11 matchup against the Baltimore Ravens, Joe Burrow would suffer a wrist injury that would rule him out the rest of the season.[95] The consistent play of backup quarterback Jake Browning kept the Bengals alive in the postseason hunt after Burrow's injury.[96] The Bengals finished the season 9–8 and missed the playoffs.[97] When the team debuted in 1968, the Bengals' uniforms were modeled after the Cleveland Browns. When Paul Brown was fired by Art Modell, Brown still owned the equipment used by Cleveland, so after the firing, Paul Brown packed up all his equipment, which he then used for his new team in Cincinnati. The Cleveland Browns' team colors were brown, orange, and white, and their helmets were solid orange with a white dorsal stripe over the crest. The Bengals' team colors were orange, black, and white, and their helmets were a similar shade of orange, with the only variations being the word \"Bengals\" in black block letters (with a white outline) on either side of the helmet and no stripe on the helmet. The Cincinnati Bengals were unique in the NFL, as they did not have secondary uniform numbers on the jerseys (called \"TV numbers\") until they appeared on the sleeves in the 1980 season; they were the only NFL team that didn't have them prior to that point. That same year, the team changed their helmet face mask color from gray to black. The team did not discard their Cleveland-like uniforms until 1981. During that year, a then-unique uniform design was introduced: Although the team kept black jerseys, white jerseys, and white pants, they were now trimmed with orange and black tiger stripes. The team also introduced the orange helmets with black tiger stripes that are still in use today. Sports Illustrated likened the Bengals' new helmets to \"varicose pumpkins.\"[98] In 1997, the Bengals designed a logo consisting of a leaping tiger, and it was added to the uniform sleeves (with this, the TV numbers moved to the shoulder). Another alternate logo consisted of a Bengal's head facing to the left. However, the orange helmet with black tiger stripes continued to be the trademark. In 2004, a new tiger stripe pattern and more accents were added to the uniforms. The black jerseys now featured orange tiger-striped sleeves and white side panels, while the white jerseys began to use black tiger-striped sleeves and orange shoulders.[99] A new logo consisting of an orange \"B\" covered with black tiger stripes was introduced.[100] The team also started rotating black pants and debuted an alternate orange jersey, with white side panels and black tiger-striped sleeves. The Bengals have worn their black uniforms at home throughout their history, with some exceptions, such as the 1970 season, when the Bengals wore white at home for the entire season as well as most of the 1971 season (the Bengals were the first AFL team to wear white at home, as its rules required the home team to wear their dark jerseys, unlike the NFL, which allowed the home team choice of jersey color starting in 1964). Since 2005, the Bengals have worn white for September home games where the heat could become a factor. In 2016, the Bengals unveiled their all-white Color Rush alternate uniform, featuring black tiger stripes along the sleeves and pants. Orange was only used on the Nike mark, on the team logo, and as an outline color on the player's name.[101] The club announced a new uniform design on January 21, 2021. The new uniform design would be worn beginning with the 2021 NFL season.[102] The set retains the signature striped helmet, while simplifying the look by removing the side and shoulder panels, creating a new stripe pattern for the sleeves, getting rid of the number block shadow, and removing the stroke on the player's name. This set also puts the team's wordmark on the chest and lacks TV numbers on the sleeves. The shade of orange was changed, as well. The Bengals wore three different pants with this set: black pants with orange stripes, white pants with black stripes, and white pants with orange stripes. The white pants with black stripes were worn with the white jersey in 2021 playoff games at Tennessee and Kansas City. The white pants with orange stripes were worn with the black jersey in Super Bowl LVI against the Rams.[103] In 2022, after the NFL rescinded the \"one-helmet rule,\" the Bengals unveiled an alternate black-striped white helmet. In addition, the team brought back the all-white Color Rush uniform to be paired with the white helmets.[104][105] This would last one season, however, as the team decided to pair the white helmet with the primary white uniform for two games in 2023, effectively retiring the Color Rush uniform for the time being.[106] In 2024, the Bengals added orange pants to the uniform rotation after Madden NFL 25 leaked the option to the public.[107] The Bengals then unveiled a new all-orange uniform combination to be worn September 8 against the Patriots.[108] The team's official mascot is a Bengal tiger named Who Dey.[109] Its jersey number is 1.[110] Aside from Who Dey, the team also has the Ben-Gals, the team's cheerleading squad,[111] which included Laura Vikmanis, the oldest cheerleader in league history.[112] Carol Motsinger in 2015 said, \"In 2012, Cincinnati welcomed another tiger named Who Dey. This time, one that walks on four legs. More than 1,000 Bengals season ticket holders named a Malayan tiger Who Dey at Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Garden. He was recently traded to a zoo in Kansas.\"[113] The Ohio History Central notes: \"In 1940, a third American Football League formed, and the Cincinnati Bengals joined it. Unfortunately, World War II began the following year, causing manpower shortages as men joined the armed forces. This prompted this newer AFL to cease playing after the 1941 season. Paul Brown, former coach of the Cleveland Browns, received authorization from a modern American Football League to create a team in Cincinnati. Brown chose the name Bengals to memorialize the teams of the same name that had represented Cincinnati in the past.\"[114] The Bengals' historic rivalry with the Cleveland Browns is often referred to as the \"Battle of Ohio\", started as the result of former Browns head coach and team founder Paul Brown starting the Bengals franchise after leaving the Browns.[115] The colors of each team are similar since Paul Brown chose the exact shade of orange used by the Browns for the Bengals, and the Bengals' original uniforms were identical to the Browns' uniforms, excluding the word \"Bengals\" on the helmet. The rivalry reached its peak during the 1980s when both teams were vying viciously for a spot in the playoffs. During the 1990s the rivalry also butted heads when Brown's sons were in charge of the day-to-day operations of the Bengals.[116] The Bengals lead the series 53–48 as of the end of the 2023 season.[117] The Bengals and Pittsburgh Steelers have played each other twice a year since becoming division rivals in 1970. This rivalry has gained intensity since the 2000s, as the teams have met twice in the playoffs, with both games being marked by hard hits and injuries with the most infamous example occurring in the 2005 playoffs.[118][119][120] The Steelers lead the overall series 70–39 and the postseason series 2–0.[121] However, the Steelers have been more dominant recently, posting a record of 28–7 since 2004, when they drafted Roethlisberger. There were two times that the rivalry has met during the playoffs: the Wild Card rounds of 2005 and 2015, with the Steelers winning both meetings at Cincinnati. The 2005 game is marked as a special time in the rivalry because this is when Steelers defensive tackle Kimo Von Oelhoffen injured Bengals quarterback Carson Palmer,[122] while the 2015 game is also special because Bengals running back Jeremy Hill fumbled the ball in the waning minutes when the Bengals had a 16–15 lead over the Steelers to give the latter one last chance. They used that chance wisely as they drove down the field (with the help of two costly personal fouls by the Bengals) and kicked a game-winning field goal.[123] The Bengals' rivalry with the Baltimore Ravens began when the original Browns franchise relocated to Baltimore to become the Ravens. Since then, the rivalry heated up when longtime Ravens defensive coordinator Marvin Lewis was hired as the head coach of the Bengals. The Ravens lead the all-time series 30–27 as of the 2023 season.[124] The Bengals won the only playoff meeting in the 2022 AFC Wild Card round.[125] The Joe Burrow-led Bengals have developed a recent rivalry with the Kansas City Chiefs, with Burrow being the only AFC quarterback to date to hold a winning record against Mahomes.[126] As of the 2023 season, the Bengals lead the all-time series 18–16.[127] The Bengals have played the Titans more than any non-divisional opponent by a significant margin. The Titans lead the all-time series 41–37–1.[128] A no-huddle offense was commonly used by all teams when time in the game was running low. However, Sam Wyche, the head coach of the Bengals in 1988, along with offensive coordinator Bruce Coslet, made the high-paced offense the standard modality for the ball club regardless of time remaining. By quickly substituting and setting up for the next play—often within 5–10 seconds after the last play despite being afforded 45 seconds—the Bengals hindered the other team's defense from substituting situational players, regrouping for tactics, and resting. In response, the NFL instituted rules allowing the defense ample time for substitutions when offensive substitutions were made. The hurry-up tactic was used by the franchise during the late 1980s while Sam Wyche was the coach. A rival for AFC supremacy during this time was the Buffalo Bills, coached by Marv Levy, who also used a version of the no-huddle offense starting with the 1989 season. The Bengals had beaten the Bills three times in 1988 (pre-season, regular season, and the AFC Championship Game). Marv Levy threatened to fake injuries if the Bengals used the \"no-huddle\" in the AFC Championship. Wyche was notified that the commissioner had ordered the \"no-huddle\" illegal for the game. The official notified Wyche and the Bengals' team just two hours before the game kickoff.[129] Wyche asked to talk directly to the commissioner and word immediately came back that the \"no-huddle\" would not be penalized. Levy did not have his players' fake injuries in the game but installed his version the next year, 1989. The Bengals first used the \"no-huddle\" in 1984.[130] Most of the high-profile games (the various games for AFC titles and regular-season games) between the two led to these changes in NFL rules. Wyche also first used the timeout periods as an opportunity to bring his entire team to the sideline to talk to all eleven players, plus substitutes, at one time. This allowed trainers time to treat a cut or bruise and equipment managers time to repair an equipment defect. The West Coast offense is the popular name for the high-percentage passing scheme designed by former Bengals assistant Bill Walsh.[131] Walsh formulated what has become popularly known as the West Coast offense during his tenure as assistant coach for the Cincinnati Bengals from 1968 to 1975, while working under the tutelage of Brown (and before embarking on his legendary coaching tenure with the San Francisco 49ers in the 1980s). Bengals quarterback Virgil Carter was the first player to successfully implement Walsh's system, leading the NFL in pass completion percentage in 1971.[132] Ken Anderson replaced Carter as Cincinnati's starting quarterback in 1972 and was even more successful. In 1975 he would bring widespread recognition to the West Coast offense as well as to the Cincinnati team and its quarterback in a nationally televised Monday night contest between the Bengals and a Buffalo Bills team built around the running game of star player O. J. Simpson. Anderson's 447 passing yards were enough to overcome Simpson's 197 yards on the ground in a game that proved a milestone, providing a striking contrast between the \"old\" game of defense-minded football and the new game of higher scores and more action through a sophisticated aerial attack.[133] The game, in effect, offered its viewers a glimpse of the future of professional football. Anderson, who was drafted by Paul Brown in 1971 and installed as starting quarterback in 1972, made four trips to the Pro Bowl, won four passing titles, was named NFL MVP in 1981, and set the record for completion percentage in a single season in 1982 with 70.66%. Defeated frequently during the 1970s by the Pittsburgh Steelers, a team that won four Super Bowls with 9 future Hall of Fame players, the Bengals under Anderson and head coach Forrest Gregg would finally break through the Steel Curtain, defeating the Steelers during both of their meetings in 1980 and again in 1981. Anderson, who had been named the \"team franchise\" by Bengal tight end Bob Trumpy, would ultimately prove his worth with a career record of 91 wins and 81 losses.[134] The defense created to combat the West Coast offense also came from Cincinnati. Then-Bengals defensive coordinator Dick LeBeau (who later served as the team's head coach from 2000 to 2002) created the zone blitz in the 1980s in response to the West Coast offense.[135] Running backs (RB) Wide receivers (WR) Tight ends (TE) Defensive linemen (DL) Defensive backs (DB) Special teams Reserve 52 active, 12 reserve, 15 practice squad In addition, Despite not being formally retired, the Bengals have certain numbers that are in limited circulation: There are four members of the Hall of Fame that have spent some portion of their career with the Bengals, but only Anthony Muñoz and Ken Riley spent their entire playing careers with the Bengals. Listed below are only Hall of Famers whose induction includes their tenure with the Bengals. Bengals founder and first coach Paul Brown is in the Hall of Fame, but was inducted before founding the team and is not credited as a Bengals Hall of Famer. Additionally, the Bengals have had two head coaches, Forrest Gregg and Dick LeBeau inducted for their playing career. In 2007, in celebration of their 40th anniversary the Bengals named an all-time team voted on by the fans.[148] Source:[149] The Bengals announced they would begin a Ring of Honor in 2021.[150] The inaugural class included Pro Football Hall of Fame tackle Anthony Muñoz and Paul Brown, who was the franchise's founder and first coach,[151] with Ken Anderson and Ken Riley added after a season ticket holder vote.[152] *Posthumous induction → Coaching staff → Front office → More NFL staffs The Bengals contract with iHeartMedia as their radio partner,[153] with their flagship radio stations being WCKY (1530) and WEBN (102.7 FM), along with WLW (700) if not in conflict with the Reds. Most preseason and regular season games, are telecast on WKRC-TV, channel 12, the CBS affiliate. Mike Watts and Anthony Muñoz are the TV announcers for preseason games, with Mike Valpredo as the sideline reporter.[154] Games that feature an NFC opponent playing at Paycor Stadium will be televised on WXIX, channel 19, the local Fox affiliate. WLWT-TV airs games when the Bengals are featured on Sunday Night Football. The radio broadcasting crew consists of Dan Hoard (play-by-play), and Dave Lapham (analyst).[155] \"The Bengal Growl\" is the Bengals fight song. It was written by Bengals entertainment director George \"Red\" Bird upon the team's founding in 1968. Bird had been friends with Paul Brown for over 30 years. The two had met at Massillon Washington High School when Brown was head football coach and Bird was director of the famed Massillon Tiger Swing Band. Bird had served as the Browns' music and entertainment director in 1946, and kept that role until Brown convinced him to come to Cincinnati in 1968. His first task was to pen a fight song along the lines of the Browns' fight song, \"Hi! O-Hi-O for Cleveland!\" The song remains very popular among Bengals fans, who are known to belt out the song at \"Bengals backer\" bars all over the country. In 2021, Elizabeth Blackburn, now the team's head of strategy and fan engagement, told The Athletic recalled stopping at one such bar in San Francisco during the 2015 playoffs, and was surprised to hear the viewers break out into the song. As a measure of how popular the song remains among the Bengals fan base, when Blackburn wrote an editorial on her efforts to overhaul the team's image for the Bengals Web site, Blackburn specifically mentioned that the song was not going anywhere.[156] \"Welcome to the Jungle\" is also a fight song for the Bengals.[157][158] The song is mainly played before kick-offs to intimidate visiting teams. \"Who Dey?!\" is the name of a chant of support by fans of the Cincinnati Bengals, in use since the 1980s. The entire chant is: \"Who dey, who dey, who dey think gonna beat dem Bengals?\"[159] The answer screamed in unison, \"Nobody.\" Sometimes fans will instead shout \"Who Dey?\" to represent the entire cheer. \"Who Dey\" is also the name of the team's mascot, a Bengal tiger.[110] Saying \"Who Dey\" at Bengals games is steeped in local beer lore. Hudy, a leading product of Hudepohl Brewing Company 1978 through the late 1980s, bears a phonetic similarity to the \"Who Dey\" chant. Beer vendors who carried full cases of bottled local beer up and down the steep upper stairs of what was then Riverfront Stadium would call out \"If Hudy\", \"Burger\" and other local beer names. Raucous fans would often chant back and forth with them as the vendors called out. During the 1980 season, the banter with the Hudepohl vendors grew organically into the now famous (Hu-Dey) -Who They?- chant.[160] The full Who Dey chant was first known to be used by fans of the 1980 Cincinnati Bengals.[161] While the origin of the chant is disputed, one possible source for the chant is a 1980 commercial for (the now-defunct) Red Frazier Ford of Cincinnati, which used this tagline: \"Who's going to give you a better deal than Red Frazier?...Nobody!\" Cincinnati fans who had seen the commercial many times may have just copied it when cheering.[162] The chant bears some similarities to the phrase \"Who Dat?\", which was officially adopted by the New Orleans Saints in 1983 but had been used by Louisiana's high school team fans for some time. The saying \"Who Dat?\" originated in minstrel shows and vaudeville acts in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, then it was taken up by New Orleans Jazz and various Big band folks in the 1920s and 1930s. In the late 1960s, local Louisiana High Schools, St. Augustine High School and Patterson High School reportedly have been using the cheer and Gulf Coast fans of Alcorn State University and Louisiana State University picked up the cheer in the 1970s. Southern University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana claims to have originated the cheer in the late 1960s in their version: \"Who dat talking 'bout beating dem Jags?\"[163]",

Or sign in with one of these services By Junglelove4 September 29, 2005 in Cincinnati Bengals Alright, I lived in Northern Kentucky my whole life, but then moved to Louisville, ky and it has been pointed out to me that I pronounce Bengals like \"Bangals\". Now I know this is how my family and friends pronounce it and realize that it isnt grammatically correct. So I was wondering if its a Cincinnati thing, a Northern Kentucky thing, or just something weird that I do? Either way, I'll be at the houston game sunday! WHO-DEY! It's BENgals, it's not a Cincinnati thing, it must be a N KY thing or a retard thing It's your Kentucky accent ..... which is noticeable as soon as you cross the Ohio river. People living in \" Loo a vull \" aren't as likely to have as much of a distinct accent ... because most of them are from somwhere else originally. BENgals ..Bangals ... Bengals ..... they're all good as long as it's not bungles anymore ... hate that !!! Just noticed this is post #1 ....... Welcome to the board. Here have a cold one & enjoy. Thanks RedsFan2. I think I just might have a cold one.. . or two. . . or three. .. . Ben·gal Pronunciation: ben-'gol, be[ng]-, -'gäl Usage: geographical name region E India (subcontinent) including delta of the Ganges & the Brahmaputra; formerly a presidency & (1937-47) a province of British India; divided 1947 between Pakistan & India (republic) Bengal Tiger : a Tiger (Panthera tigris tigris) occurring in India and especially at THE JUNGLE in Cincinnati Ohio !!!

Especially THE JUNGLE in Cincinnati Good one. Here you have one too You guys ARE 21 right ???????????? I pronounce it like \"Bang-les\", but I don't have any accent other than that. I've lived in Columbus all my life. I hate it when the sports guys say \"Bing-les\", don't you hate that? The black, fatter guy from NFL Tonight (I think..) says it that way, and he says Cincy is his home town. I think the guys on Sportscenter say it that way too, it's so annoying! Well it may be physically difficult for some people to pronounce it correctly. Yes, Lita, you are speaking of Tom Jackson, and that is ironic for him to do speak it in such a manner when he lives here, but oh well. It is a hard word to say correctly, just by it's spelling, so I don't mind. I'm glad their actually being talked about on TV, even with the mispronunciation. I hate it when the sports guys say \"Bing-les\", don't you hate that? The black, fatter guy from NFL Tonight (I think..) says it that way, and he says Cincy is his home town. I think the guys on Sportscenter say it that way too, it's so annoying! Not 100% sure, but I think that \" black fatter \" guy you're referring to is Tom Jackson ...... former player... pro bowler ... Cincinnati native ... and pretty darned astute analyst. No beer for you .... 4 years ! I'm the Beer Nazi First of all Junglelove4, welcome to Bengalszone. I too was born and raised in Northern Kentucky, (Erlanger) Spent a year after high school at Northern Kentucky University, served in the Marine Corps after that with Col. Oliver North, and now living in Northern Arizona and still rooting for the Bengals to win the AFC... ...North. Sorry got on a roll there. Anyway they pronounce it weird all over. Just thank God it ain't \"The Bungles\" anymore! BANGals, seems to me to be just a regionalism. As for the BINGles...I think it's just pure laziness, and I don't tolerate it. I always say \"It's BENGals, not BINGles...\" Which, in turn is usually met with massive rolling of the eyes. I hate it the most when people call them the Bangles, well because it just isn't right and it reminds me too much of.................................................................. I pronounce it ( Bengulls)... and we are sorry for that Alright, I lived in Northern Kentucky my whole life and we are sorry for that As for the BINGles...I think it's just pure laziness, and I don't tolerate it. I always say \"It's BENGals, not BINGles...\" Which, in turn is usually met with massive rolling of the eyes. agreed 100% BW Tom Jakcson says it that ways probably cause he was told to. Bangals...is a Northern Kentucky, Norwood and Hamiltucky pronunciation of our beloved team. Alright, I lived in Northern Kentucky my whole life and we are sorry for that I'm damn proud about being from Kentucky! It's sad to hear Ohioians seemingly looking down their nose at their betters to the south. What's even sadder is that the State of Ohio doesn't even own the River it's freaking named after! Talk about sloppy seconds from the south. Sort of off topic warning: I once met a client who stated she was a linquist. Sadly, she wasn't very cunning. That said, while we talked about her chosen profession she informed me that within 5 minutes she could tell I wasn't from Southern California. I didn't doubt her, but I did ask her how she knew. She said I pronounced the word similar incorrectly....as if it were spelled simular. Then she blew what's left of my mind by claiming she could guess within a couple hundred miles where I was from. First she said the southern Ohio area, then narrowed it down by guessing I was from somewhere near Dayton. Boom. My mind was blown. Years later I was watching a news story about a massive fireworks explosion in the Cincy area. As a witness was being interviewed I was struck by the way he pronounced the word similar. Yup, he said the word as if it were spelled simular. But wait, there's more to this story than that. As the witness was shown walking away from the camera, and I noticed he wasn't wearing any shoes. Thus, I concluded that he wasn't one of my kind. Instead, I believe he was a lowly Hill-tuckian. BTW, when I say the word Bengal I pronounce it.....undefeated.

I call the Dayton area home, and I must say that I've never heard the word \"similar\" pronounced with a \"u\" sound. I'm not calling you a liar, of course, but that is interesting. I believe she was a linguist, but I bet she's been here before. Nobody from the southern California area has even heard of Dayton, much less knows the dialect. Then again, that's her job, and what would I know about that? Not too much. My Sister calls them the Bing-gals. She was also the one that came up with such gems as: 'why does everyone have to tackle him, why doesn't just one guy tackle him'. And 'How come everyone doesn't get to throw the ball'. You have to love Thanksgiving... 'why does everyone have to tackle him, why doesn't just one guy tackle him'. And 'How come everyone doesn't get to throw the ball'. You have to love Thanksgiving... I'm familiar with this humor. My mother: \"Why does he keep running right into all those big guys???\" \"Why do all the penalties go on MY team???\" My brother: \"I would just form a human pyramid over the lineman after the hike, and have the ball carrier on top so he can jump over the whole defense\" \"I would give the lightest guy on the team the ball, and have the strongest guy throw him downfield\" \"I would form a circular barrier of huge guys around the ballcarrier, and have a battering ram of people all the way to the endzone.\" It's \"Simuhliar\" not \"Simooliar\", silly. I think I say it \"Simliar\". hehe 'why does everyone have to tackle him, why doesn't just one guy tackle him'. And 'How come everyone doesn't get to throw the ball'. You have to love Thanksgiving... That is so funny JET. I bout fell out of my chair...You got to love em though... I've never heard the sim-u-lar pronouciation before, but I've never listened for it. My grandparents live in the Dayton area and I had an uncle who lived there as well. The one pronounciation that drives me insane is when people say \"Cincinnata\" instead of \"Cincinnati.\" There are times that I just want to scream \"The world doesn't end in a freakin A\" You can post now and register later.

                "content": "Model Bella Hadid made an unexpected appearance on the Dec. 8 episode of Yellowstone alongside her boyfriend Adan Banuelos. Here's whose girlfriend she plays on the show. This week on Bella-stone... Bella Hadid stunned Yellowstone viewers by making an unexpected cameo on the Dec. 8 episode of the Paramount+ series' final season alongside her professional cowboy boyfriend Adan Banuelos. The model played the role of Sadie, the girlfriend of horse trainer Travis Wheatley, who is played by series creator Taylor Sheridan. The 28-year-old first appeared in the episode answering the door in a cowboy hat and tank top at Travis' Texas ranch after Kelly Reilly's character Beth Dutton shows up for a horse auction and instead finds the group—which includes Adan—playing strip poker. In a subsequent scene, Beth questions why Sadie is dating Travis, who she deems \"misogynistic,\" \"condescending\" and \"the most arrogant man\" she's ever met. She also notes that he's 25 years older than Bella's character. After Sadie asks her if she's \"ever seen him ride before,\" the duo watches him get on a horse, which prompts Beth to admit, \"OK, yeah, I get it.\" Bella—who used to compete in equestrian competitions—put her own skills on display later in the episode when her character rides around during a horse auction at the Yellowstone ranch. Yellowstone viewers were stunned by the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills alum's cameo, with one person saying that it \"definitely wasn't on my 2024 bingo card.\" Another person joked that \"bella hadid takes that cowboy s--t for real serious cause why is she playing strip poker with taylor sheridan on yellowstone right now.\" A third user called it \"objectively hilarious\" that Yellowstone's creator cast a model as his character's girlfriend on the show. Bella's cowgirl cameo comes over a year into her relationship with Adan, who she was first linked to when they were spotted making out with one another in October 2023. The Victoria's Secret model made thie relationship Instagram official back in February. Just a couple months later, she revealed that she'd moved to Texas—where Adan lives—after becoming disillusioned with modeling. \"After 10 years of modeling,\" Bella told Allure in April, \"I realized I was putting so much energy and love and effort into something that, in the long run, wasn't necessarily giving it back to me.\" The couple did return to New York for an appearance together, though, when they rode horses alongside one another outside of the Horse Sense premiere in Manhattan. \"My love brought Texas to NYC,\" Bella captioned an Instagram carousel post from the event Sept. 17. \"Lucky me.\" Keep reading for the fate of other fan-favorite shows amid Yellowstone's final season.

Following a flurry of deaths on the show in recent weeks, the supermodel played the girlfriend of Travis Wheatley, a horse trainer portrayed by series creator Taylor Sheridan, who has appeared in nearly a dozen episodes during the show’s run. The pair’s interaction in the series’ penultimate episode before the finale definitely raised viewers’ eyebrows. So, what exactly happened? Hadid first appeared on the episode when Beth Dutton, played by Kelly Reilly, pays Travis a visit. She was taken aback, though, by Hadid’s character, Sadie, who opens the door. “You the masseuse?” Sadie asks, to which Beth fires back, “Do I look like a f------ masseuse?” “A very expensive one,” Sadie replies. Beth walks into the house and sees Travis engaged in a game of strip poker with a bunch of people, including one person played by Hadid’s real-life boyfriend, Adan Banuelos. Beth yells at Travis to go to a horse auction he is hosting where buyers are waiting, which is what brought her to Texas. Beth and Sadie interact again at the auction when Beth, who calls him “the most arrogant I’ve ever met in my life,” asks why Sadie is interested in Travis in the first place. “You ever seen him ride before?” Sadie asks. “OK, yeah, I get it,” Beth responds after watching him in the ring. Hadid appears again in the episode when she’s seen riding a horse. Hadid's role certainly had people talking on X, where the reactions ran the gamut. “Taylor Sheridan making Bella Hadid his girlfriend in ‘Yellowstone’ is objectively hilarious” one person wrote. “Taylor Sheridan writing in Bella Hadid as his girlfriend on Yellowstone is hilarious by the way (realest thing he’s ever done)” another person joked. “Bella Hadid on Yellowstone is the greatest addition to the show,” someone else commented. “I didn’t think Yellowstone could get any better … then I saw Bella Hadid,” another user raved. Other fans commented on Sheridan's appearance. Sheridan began his career as an actor, so stepping in front of the camera isn’t exactly new fare for him. In fact, he has made three appearances as Army Delta Force operator Cody Spears on “Lionness,” another Paramount+ series he created. But \"Yellowstone\" viewers used his appearance to comment on the direction the show is going in under his leadership. “I’ve got to believe that Taylor Sheridan is just as arrogant and obnoxious in real life as is his character on #Yellowstone. I’m not sure he’s acting,” someone chided. “All the abandoned plot-lines and people are still praising Taylor Sheridan like this isn’t the worst last season ever possible for Yellowstone. The show is garbage now,” another person criticized. “The Taylor Sheridan Midlife Crisis Episodes. I know it’s his show but this?? We’ve seen him numerous times on the show work with his horses and now we see his half naked juiced self? Very selfish of him to hog time from the real cast we care about,” a different viewer wrote. In May 2023, Paramount announced \"Yellowstone\" would end after its fifth and final season, although Sheridan is helming other ongoing spinoffs like \"1923.\" Drew Weisholtz is a reporter for TODAY Digital, focusing on pop culture, nostalgia and trending stories.

Earthquakes can range in intensity, from those so weak they cannot be felt, to those violent enough to propel objects and people into the air, damage critical infrastructure, and wreak destruction across entire cities. The seismic activity of an area is the frequency, type, and size of earthquakes experienced over a particular time. The seismicity at a particular location in the Earth is the average rate of seismic energy release per unit volume. In its most general sense, the word earthquake is used to describe any seismic event that generates seismic waves. Earthquakes can occur naturally or be induced by human activities, such as mining, fracking, and nuclear tests. The initial point of rupture is called the hypocenter or focus, while the ground level directly above it is the epicenter. Earthquakes are primarily caused by geological faults, but also by volcanic activity, landslides, and other seismic events. The frequency, type, and size of earthquakes in an area define its seismic activity, reflecting the average rate of seismic energy release. Significant historical earthquakes include the 1556 Shaanxi earthquake in China, with over 830,000 fatalities, and the 1960 Valdivia earthquake in Chile, the largest ever recorded at 9.5 magnitude. Earthquakes result in various effects, such as ground shaking and soil liquefaction, leading to significant damage and loss of life. When the epicenter of a large earthquake is located offshore, the seabed may be displaced sufficiently to cause a tsunami. Earthquakes can trigger landslides. Earthquakes' occurrence is influenced by tectonic movements along faults, including normal, reverse (thrust), and strike-slip faults, with energy release and rupture dynamics governed by the elastic-rebound theory. Efforts to manage earthquake risks involve prediction, forecasting, and preparedness, including seismic retrofitting and earthquake engineering to design structures that withstand shaking. The cultural impact of earthquakes spans myths, religious beliefs, and modern media, reflecting their profound influence on human societies. Similar seismic phenomena, known as marsquakes and moonquakes, have been observed on other celestial bodies, indicating the universality of such events beyond Earth. An earthquake is the shaking of the surface of Earth resulting from a sudden release of energy in the lithosphere that creates seismic waves. Earthquakes may also be referred to as quakes, tremors, or temblors. The word tremor is also used for non-earthquake seismic rumbling. In its most general sense, an earthquake is any seismic event—whether natural or caused by humans—that generates seismic waves. Earthquakes are caused mostly by the rupture of geological faults but also by other events such as volcanic activity, landslides, mine blasts, fracking and nuclear tests. An earthquake's point of initial rupture is called its hypocenter or focus. The epicenter is the point at ground level directly above the hypocenter. The seismic activity of an area is the frequency, type, and size of earthquakes experienced over a particular time. The seismicity at a particular location in the Earth is the average rate of seismic energy release per unit volume. One of the most devastating earthquakes in recorded history was the 1556 Shaanxi earthquake, which occurred on 23 January 1556 in Shaanxi, China. More than 830,000 people died.[2] Most houses in the area were yaodongs—dwellings carved out of loess hillsides—and many victims were killed when these structures collapsed. The 1976 Tangshan earthquake, which killed between 240,000 and 655,000 people, was the deadliest of the 20th century.[3] The 1960 Chilean earthquake is the largest earthquake that has been measured on a seismograph, reaching 9.5 magnitude on 22 May 1960.[4][5] Its epicenter was near Cañete, Chile. The energy released was approximately twice that of the next most powerful earthquake, the Good Friday earthquake (27 March 1964), which was centered in Prince William Sound, Alaska.[6][7] The ten largest recorded earthquakes have all been megathrust earthquakes; however, of these ten, only the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake is simultaneously one of the deadliest earthquakes in history. Earthquakes that caused the greatest loss of life, while powerful, were deadly because of their proximity to either heavily populated areas or the ocean, where earthquakes often create tsunamis that can devastate communities thousands of kilometers away. Regions most at risk for great loss of life include those where earthquakes are relatively rare but powerful, and poor regions with lax, unenforced, or nonexistent seismic building codes. Tectonic earthquakes occur anywhere on the earth where there is sufficient stored elastic strain energy to drive fracture propagation along a fault plane. The sides of a fault move past each other smoothly and aseismically only if there are no irregularities or asperities along the fault surface that increases the frictional resistance. Most fault surfaces do have such asperities, which leads to a form of stick-slip behavior. Once the fault has locked, continued relative motion between the plates leads to increasing stress and, therefore, stored strain energy in the volume around the fault surface. This continues until the stress has risen sufficiently to break through the asperity, suddenly allowing sliding over the locked portion of the fault, releasing the stored energy.[8] This energy is released as a combination of radiated elastic strain seismic waves,[9] frictional heating of the fault surface, and cracking of the rock, thus causing an earthquake. This process of gradual build-up of strain and stress punctuated by occasional sudden earthquake failure is referred to as the elastic-rebound theory. It is estimated that only 10 percent or less of an earthquake's total energy is radiated as seismic energy. Most of the earthquake's energy is used to power the earthquake fracture growth or is converted into heat generated by friction. Therefore, earthquakes lower the Earth's available elastic potential energy and raise its temperature, though these changes are negligible compared to the conductive and convective flow of heat out from the Earth's deep interior.[10] There are three main types of fault, all of which may cause an interplate earthquake: normal, reverse (thrust), and strike-slip. Normal and reverse faulting are examples of dip-slip, where the displacement along the fault is in the direction of dip and where movement on them involves a vertical component. Many earthquakes are caused by movement on faults that have components of both dip-slip and strike-slip; this is known as oblique slip. The topmost, brittle part of the Earth's crust, and the cool slabs of the tectonic plates that are descending into the hot mantle, are the only parts of our planet that can store elastic energy and release it in fault ruptures. Rocks hotter than about 300 °C (572 °F) flow in response to stress; they do not rupture in earthquakes.[11][12] The maximum observed lengths of ruptures and mapped faults (which may break in a single rupture) are approximately 1,000 km (620 mi). Examples are the earthquakes in Alaska (1957), Chile (1960), and Sumatra (2004), all in subduction zones. The longest earthquake ruptures on strike-slip faults, like the San Andreas Fault (1857, 1906), the North Anatolian Fault in Turkey (1939), and the Denali Fault in Alaska (2002), are about half to one third as long as the lengths along subducting plate margins, and those along normal faults are even shorter. Normal faults occur mainly in areas where the crust is being extended such as a divergent boundary. Earthquakes associated with normal faults are generally less than magnitude 7. Maximum magnitudes along many normal faults are even more limited because many of them are located along spreading centers, as in Iceland, where the thickness of the brittle layer is only about six kilometres (3.7 mi).[13][14] Reverse faults occur in areas where the crust is being shortened such as at a convergent boundary. Reverse faults, particularly those along convergent boundaries, are associated with the most powerful earthquakes (called megathrust earthquakes) including almost all of those of magnitude 8 or more. Megathrust earthquakes are responsible for about 90% of the total seismic moment released worldwide.[15] Strike-slip faults are steep structures where the two sides of the fault slip horizontally past each other; transform boundaries are a particular type of strike-slip fault. Strike-slip faults, particularly continental transforms, can produce major earthquakes up to about magnitude 8. Strike-slip faults tend to be oriented near vertically, resulting in an approximate width of 10 km (6.2 mi) within the brittle crust.[16] Thus, earthquakes with magnitudes much larger than 8 are not possible. In addition, there exists a hierarchy of stress levels in the three fault types. Thrust faults are generated by the highest, strike-slip by intermediate, and normal faults by the lowest stress levels.[17] This can easily be understood by considering the direction of the greatest principal stress, the direction of the force that \"pushes\" the rock mass during the faulting. In the case of normal faults, the rock mass is pushed down in a vertical direction, thus the pushing force (greatest principal stress) equals the weight of the rock mass itself. In the case of thrusting, the rock mass \"escapes\" in the direction of the least principal stress, namely upward, lifting the rock mass, and thus, the overburden equals the least principal stress. Strike-slip faulting is intermediate between the other two types described above. This difference in stress regime in the three faulting environments can contribute to differences in stress drop during faulting, which contributes to differences in the radiated energy, regardless of fault dimensions. For every unit increase in magnitude, there is a roughly thirty-fold increase in the energy released. For instance, an earthquake of magnitude 6.0 releases approximately 32 times more energy than a 5.0 magnitude earthquake and a 7.0 magnitude earthquake releases 1,000 times more energy than a 5.0 magnitude earthquake. An 8.6-magnitude earthquake releases the same amount of energy as 10,000 atomic bombs of the size used in World War II.[18] This is so because the energy released in an earthquake, and thus its magnitude, is proportional to the area of the fault that ruptures[19] and the stress drop. Therefore, the longer the length and the wider the width of the faulted area, the larger the resulting magnitude. The most important parameter controlling the maximum earthquake magnitude on a fault, however, is not the maximum available length, but the available width because the latter varies by a factor of 20. Along converging plate margins, the dip angle of the rupture plane is very shallow, typically about 10 degrees.[20] Thus, the width of the plane within the top brittle crust of the Earth can reach 50–100 km (31–62 mi) (such as in Japan, 2011, or in Alaska, 1964), making the most powerful earthquakes possible. The majority of tectonic earthquakes originate in the Ring of Fire at depths not exceeding tens of kilometers. Earthquakes occurring at a depth of less than 70 km (43 mi) are classified as \"shallow-focus\" earthquakes, while those with a focal depth between 70 and 300 km (43 and 186 mi) are commonly termed \"mid-focus\" or \"intermediate-depth\" earthquakes. In subduction zones, where older and colder oceanic crust descends beneath another tectonic plate, deep-focus earthquakes may occur at much greater depths (ranging from 300 to 700 km (190 to 430 mi)).[21] These seismically active areas of subduction are known as Wadati–Benioff zones. Deep-focus earthquakes occur at a depth where the subducted lithosphere should no longer be brittle, due to the high temperature and pressure. A possible mechanism for the generation of deep-focus earthquakes is faulting caused by olivine undergoing a phase transition into a spinel structure.[22] Earthquakes often occur in volcanic regions and are caused there, both by tectonic faults and the movement of magma in volcanoes. Such earthquakes can serve as an early warning of volcanic eruptions, as during the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens.[23] Earthquake swarms can serve as markers for the location of the flowing magma throughout the volcanoes. These swarms can be recorded by seismometers and tiltmeters (a device that measures ground slope) and used as sensors to predict imminent or upcoming eruptions.[24] A tectonic earthquake begins as an area of initial slip on the fault surface that forms the focus. Once the rupture has been initiated, it begins to propagate away from the focus, spreading out along the fault surface. Lateral propagation will continue until either the rupture reaches a barrier, such as the end of a fault segment, or a region on the fault where there is insufficient stress to allow continued rupture. For larger earthquakes, the depth extent of rupture will be constrained downwards by the brittle-ductile transition zone and upwards by the ground surface. The mechanics of this process are poorly understood because it is difficult either to recreate such rapid movements in a laboratory or to record seismic waves close to a nucleation zone due to strong ground motion.[25] In most cases, the rupture speed approaches, but does not exceed, the shear wave (S wave) velocity of the surrounding rock. There are a few exceptions to this: Supershear earthquake ruptures are known to have propagated at speeds greater than the S wave velocity. These have so far all been observed during large strike-slip events. The unusually wide zone of damage caused by the 2001 Kunlun earthquake has been attributed to the effects of the sonic boom developed in such earthquakes. Slow earthquake ruptures travel at unusually low velocities. A particularly dangerous form of slow earthquake is the tsunami earthquake, observed where the relatively low felt intensities, caused by the slow propagation speed of some great earthquakes, fail to alert the population of the neighboring coast, as in the 1896 Sanriku earthquake.[25] During an earthquake, high temperatures can develop at the fault plane, increasing pore pressure and consequently vaporization of the groundwater already contained within the rock.[27][28][29] In the coseismic phase, such an increase can significantly affect slip evolution and speed, in the post-seismic phase it can control the Aftershock sequence because, after the main event, pore pressure increase slowly propagates into the surrounding fracture network.[30][29] From the point of view of the Mohr-Coulomb strength theory, an increase in fluid pressure reduces the normal stress acting on the fault plane that holds it in place, and fluids can exert a lubricating effect. As thermal overpressurization may provide positive feedback between slip and strength fall at the fault plane, a common opinion is that it may enhance the faulting process instability. After the mainshock, the pressure gradient between the fault plane and the neighboring rock causes a fluid flow that increases pore pressure in the surrounding fracture networks; such an increase may trigger new faulting processes by reactivating adjacent faults, giving rise to aftershocks.[30][29] Analogously, artificial pore pressure increase, by fluid injection in Earth's crust, may induce seismicity. Tides may trigger some seismicity. Most earthquakes form part of a sequence, related to each other in terms of location and time.[31] Most earthquake clusters consist of small tremors that cause little to no damage, but there is a theory that earthquakes can recur in a regular pattern.[32] Earthquake clustering has been observed, for example, in Parkfield, California where a long-term research study is being conducted around the Parkfield earthquake cluster.[33] An aftershock is an earthquake that occurs after a previous earthquake, the mainshock. Rapid changes of stress between rocks, and the stress from the original earthquake are the main causes of these aftershocks,[34] along with the crust around the ruptured fault plane as it adjusts to the effects of the mainshock.[31] An aftershock is in the same region as the main shock but always of a smaller magnitude, however, they can still be powerful enough to cause even more damage to buildings that were already previously damaged from the mainshock.[34] If an aftershock is larger than the mainshock, the aftershock is redesignated as the mainshock and the original main shock is redesignated as a foreshock. Aftershocks are formed as the crust around the displaced fault plane adjusts to the effects of the mainshock.[31] Earthquake swarms are sequences of earthquakes striking in a specific area within a short period. They are different from earthquakes followed by a series of aftershocks by the fact that no single earthquake in the sequence is the main shock, so none has a notably higher magnitude than another. An example of an earthquake swarm is the 2004 activity at Yellowstone National Park.[35] In August 2012, a swarm of earthquakes shook Southern California's Imperial Valley, showing the most recorded activity in the area since the 1970s.[36] Sometimes a series of earthquakes occur in what has been called an earthquake storm, where the earthquakes strike a fault in clusters, each triggered by the shaking or stress redistribution of the previous earthquakes. Similar to aftershocks but on adjacent segments of fault, these storms occur over the course of years, with some of the later earthquakes as damaging as the early ones. Such a pattern was observed in the sequence of about a dozen earthquakes that struck the North Anatolian Fault in Turkey in the 20th century and has been inferred for older anomalous clusters of large earthquakes in the Middle East.[37][38] It is estimated that around 500,000 earthquakes occur each year, detectable with current instrumentation. About 100,000 of these can be felt.[4][5] Minor earthquakes occur very frequently around the world in places like California and Alaska in the U.S., as well as in El Salvador, Mexico, Guatemala, Chile, Peru, Indonesia, the Philippines, Iran, Pakistan, the Azores in Portugal, Turkey, New Zealand, Greece, Italy, India, Nepal, and Japan.[40] Larger earthquakes occur less frequently, the relationship being exponential; for example, roughly ten times as many earthquakes larger than magnitude 4 occur than earthquakes larger than magnitude 5.[41] In the (low seismicity) United Kingdom, for example, it has been calculated that the average recurrences are: an earthquake of 3.7–4.6 every year, an earthquake of 4.7–5.5 every 10 years, and an earthquake of 5.6 or larger every 100 years.[42] This is an example of the Gutenberg–Richter law. The number of seismic stations has increased from about 350 in 1931 to many thousands today. As a result, many more earthquakes are reported than in the past, but this is because of the vast improvement in instrumentation, rather than an increase in the number of earthquakes. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) estimates that, since 1900, there have been an average of 18 major earthquakes (magnitude 7.0–7.9) and one great earthquake (magnitude 8.0 or greater) per year, and that this average has been relatively stable.[43] In recent years, the number of major earthquakes per year has decreased, though this is probably a statistical fluctuation rather than a systematic trend.[44] More detailed statistics on the size and frequency of earthquakes is available from the United States Geological Survey.[45] A recent increase in the number of major earthquakes has been noted, which could be explained by a cyclical pattern of periods of intense tectonic activity, interspersed with longer periods of low intensity. However, accurate recordings of earthquakes only began in the early 1900s, so it is too early to categorically state that this is the case.[46] Most of the world's earthquakes (90%, and 81% of the largest) take place in the 40,000-kilometre-long (25,000 mi), horseshoe-shaped zone called the circum-Pacific seismic belt, known as the Pacific Ring of Fire, which for the most part bounds the Pacific plate.[47][48] Massive earthquakes tend to occur along other plate boundaries too, such as along the Himalayan Mountains.[49] With the rapid growth of mega-cities such as Mexico City, Tokyo, and Tehran in areas of high seismic risk, some seismologists are warning that a single earthquake may claim the lives of up to three million people.[50] While most earthquakes are caused by the movement of the Earth's tectonic plates, human activity can also produce earthquakes. Activities both above ground and below may change the stresses and strains on the crust, including building reservoirs, extracting resources such as coal or oil, and injecting fluids underground for waste disposal or fracking.[51] Most of these earthquakes have small magnitudes. The 5.7 magnitude 2011 Oklahoma earthquake is thought to have been caused by disposing wastewater from oil production into injection wells,[52] and studies point to the state's oil industry as the cause of other earthquakes in the past century.[53] A Columbia University paper suggested that the 8.0 magnitude 2008 Sichuan earthquake was induced by loading from the Zipingpu Dam,[54] though the link has not been conclusively proved.[55] The instrumental scales used to describe the size of an earthquake began with the Richter scale in the 1930s. It is a relatively simple measurement of an event's amplitude, and its use has become minimal in the 21st century. Seismic waves travel through the Earth's interior and can be recorded by seismometers at great distances. The surface-wave magnitude was developed in the 1950s as a means to measure remote earthquakes and to improve the accuracy for larger events. The moment magnitude scale not only measures the amplitude of the shock but also takes into account the seismic moment (total rupture area, average slip of the fault, and rigidity of the rock). The Japan Meteorological Agency seismic intensity scale, the Medvedev–Sponheuer–Karnik scale, and the Mercalli intensity scale are based on the observed effects and are related to the intensity of shaking. The shaking of the earth is a common phenomenon that has been experienced by humans from the earliest of times. Before the development of strong-motion accelerometers, the intensity of a seismic event was estimated based on the observed effects. Magnitude and intensity are not directly related and calculated using different methods. The magnitude of an earthquake is a single value that describes the size of the earthquake at its source. Intensity is the measure of shaking at different locations around the earthquake. Intensity values vary from place to place, depending on the distance from the earthquake and the underlying rock or soil makeup.[56] The first scale for measuring earthquake magnitudes was developed by Charles Francis Richter in 1935. Subsequent scales (seismic magnitude scales) have retained a key feature, where each unit represents a ten-fold difference in the amplitude of the ground shaking and a 32-fold difference in energy. Subsequent scales are also adjusted to have approximately the same numeric value within the limits of the scale.[57] Although the mass media commonly reports earthquake magnitudes as \"Richter magnitude\" or \"Richter scale\", standard practice by most seismological authorities is to express an earthquake's strength on the moment magnitude scale, which is based on the actual energy released by an earthquake, the static seismic moment.[58][59] Every earthquake produces different types of seismic waves, which travel through rock with different velocities: Propagation velocity of the seismic waves through solid rock ranges from approx. 3 km/s (1.9 mi/s) up to 13 km/s (8.1 mi/s), depending on the density and elasticity of the medium. In the Earth's interior, the shock- or P waves travel much faster than the S waves (approx. relation 1.7:1). The differences in travel time from the epicenter to the observatory are a measure of the distance and can be used to image both sources of earthquakes and structures within the Earth. Also, the depth of the hypocenter can be computed roughly. P wave speed S waves speed As a consequence, the first waves of a distant earthquake arrive at an observatory via the Earth's mantle. On average, the kilometer distance to the earthquake is the number of seconds between the P- and S wave times 8.[60] Slight deviations are caused by inhomogeneities of subsurface structure. By such analysis of seismograms, the Earth's core was located in 1913 by Beno Gutenberg. S waves and later arriving surface waves do most of the damage compared to P waves. P waves squeeze and expand the material in the same direction they are traveling, whereas S waves shake the ground up and down and back and forth.[61] Earthquakes are not only categorized by their magnitude but also by the place where they occur. The world is divided into 754 Flinn–Engdahl regions (F-E regions), which are based on political and geographical boundaries as well as seismic activity. More active zones are divided into smaller F-E regions whereas less active zones belong to larger F-E regions. Standard reporting of earthquakes includes its magnitude, date and time of occurrence, geographic coordinates of its epicenter, depth of the epicenter, geographical region, distances to population centers, location uncertainty, several parameters that are included in USGS earthquake reports (number of stations reporting, number of observations, etc.), and a unique event ID.[62] Although relatively slow seismic waves have traditionally been used to detect earthquakes, scientists realized in 2016 that gravitational measurement could provide instantaneous detection of earthquakes, and confirmed this by analyzing gravitational records associated with the 2011 Tohoku-Oki (\"Fukushima\") earthquake.[63][64] The effects of earthquakes include, but are not limited to, the following: Shaking and ground rupture are the main effects created by earthquakes, principally resulting in more or less severe damage to buildings and other rigid structures. The severity of the local effects depends on the complex combination of the earthquake magnitude, the distance from the epicenter, and the local geological and geomorphological conditions, which may amplify or reduce wave propagation.[65] The ground-shaking is measured by ground acceleration. Specific local geological, geomorphological, and geostructural features can induce high levels of shaking on the ground surface even from low-intensity earthquakes. This effect is called site or local amplification. It is principally due to the transfer of the seismic motion from hard deep soils to soft superficial soils and the effects of seismic energy focalization owing to the typical geometrical setting of such deposits. Ground rupture is a visible breaking and displacement of the Earth's surface along the trace of the fault, which may be of the order of several meters in the case of major earthquakes. Ground rupture is a major risk for large engineering structures such as dams, bridges, and nuclear power stations and requires careful mapping of existing faults to identify any that are likely to break the ground surface within the life of the structure.[66] Soil liquefaction occurs when, because of the shaking, water-saturated granular material (such as sand) temporarily loses its strength and transforms from a solid to a liquid. Soil liquefaction may cause rigid structures, like buildings and bridges, to tilt or sink into the liquefied deposits. For example, in the 1964 Alaska earthquake, soil liquefaction caused many buildings to sink into the ground, eventually collapsing upon themselves.[67] Physical damage from an earthquake will vary depending on the intensity of shaking in a given area and the type of population. Underserved and developing communities frequently experience more severe impacts (and longer lasting) from a seismic event compared to well-developed communities.[68] Impacts may include: With these impacts and others, the aftermath may bring disease, a lack of basic necessities, mental consequences such as panic attacks and depression to survivors,[69] and higher insurance premiums. Recovery times will vary based on the level of damage and the socioeconomic status of the impacted community. Earthquakes can produce slope instability leading to landslides, a major geological hazard. Landslide danger may persist while emergency personnel is attempting rescue work.[70] Earthquakes can cause fires by damaging electrical power or gas lines. In the event of water mains rupturing and a loss of pressure, it may also become difficult to stop the spread of a fire once it has started. For example, more deaths in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake were caused by fire than by the earthquake itself.[71] Tsunamis are long-wavelength, long-period sea waves produced by the sudden or abrupt movement of large volumes of water—including when an earthquake occurs at sea. In the open ocean, the distance between wave crests can surpass 100 kilometres (62 mi), and the wave periods can vary from five minutes to one hour. Such tsunamis travel 600–800 kilometers per hour (373–497 miles per hour), depending on water depth. Large waves produced by an earthquake or a submarine landslide can overrun nearby coastal areas in a matter of minutes. Tsunamis can also travel thousands of kilometers across open ocean and wreak destruction on far shores hours after the earthquake that generated them.[72] Ordinarily, subduction earthquakes under magnitude 7.5 do not cause tsunamis, although some instances of this have been recorded. Most destructive tsunamis are caused by earthquakes of magnitude 7.5 or more.[72] Floods may be secondary effects of earthquakes if dams are damaged. Earthquakes may cause landslips to dam rivers, which collapse and cause floods.[73] The terrain below the Sarez Lake in Tajikistan is in danger of catastrophic flooding if the landslide dam formed by the earthquake, known as the Usoi Dam, were to fail during a future earthquake. Impact projections suggest the flood could affect roughly five million people.[74] Earthquake prediction is a branch of the science of seismology concerned with the specification of the time, location, and magnitude of future earthquakes within stated limits.[75] Many methods have been developed for predicting the time and place in which earthquakes will occur. Despite considerable research efforts by seismologists, scientifically reproducible predictions cannot yet be made to a specific day or month.[76] Popular belief holds earthquakes are preceded by earthquake weather, in the early morning.[77][78] While forecasting is usually considered to be a type of prediction, earthquake forecasting is often differentiated from earthquake prediction. Earthquake forecasting is concerned with the probabilistic assessment of general earthquake hazards, including the frequency and magnitude of damaging earthquakes in a given area over years or decades.[79] For well-understood faults the probability that a segment may rupture during the next few decades can be estimated.[80][81] Earthquake warning systems have been developed that can provide regional notification of an earthquake in progress, but before the ground surface has begun to move, potentially allowing people within the system's range to seek shelter before the earthquake's impact is felt. The objective of earthquake engineering is to foresee the impact of earthquakes on buildings, bridges, tunnels, roadways, and other structures, and to design such structures to minimize the risk of damage. Existing structures can be modified by seismic retrofitting to improve their resistance to earthquakes. Earthquake insurance can provide building owners with financial protection against losses resulting from earthquakes. Emergency management strategies can be employed by a government or organization to mitigate risks and prepare for consequences. Artificial intelligence may help to assess buildings and plan precautionary operations. The Igor expert system is part of a mobile laboratory that supports the procedures leading to the seismic assessment of masonry buildings and the planning of retrofitting operations on them. It has been applied to assess buildings in Lisbon, Rhodes, and Naples.[82] Individuals can also take preparedness steps like securing water heaters and heavy items that could injure someone, locating shutoffs for utilities, and being educated about what to do when the shaking starts. For areas near large bodies of water, earthquake preparedness encompasses the possibility of a tsunami caused by a large earthquake. From the lifetime of the Greek philosopher Anaxagoras in the 5th century BCE to the 14th century CE, earthquakes were usually attributed to \"air (vapors) in the cavities of the Earth.\"[83] Thales of Miletus (625–547 BCE) was the only documented person who believed that earthquakes were caused by tension between the earth and water.[83] Other theories existed, including the Greek philosopher Anaxamines' (585–526 BCE) beliefs that short incline episodes of dryness and wetness caused seismic activity. The Greek philosopher Democritus (460–371 BCE) blamed water in general for earthquakes.[83] Pliny the Elder called earthquakes \"underground thunderstorms\".[83] In Norse mythology, earthquakes were explained as the violent struggle of the god Loki. When Loki, god of mischief and strife, murdered Baldr, god of beauty and light, he was punished by being bound in a cave with a poisonous serpent placed above his head dripping venom. Loki's wife Sigyn stood by him with a bowl to catch the poison, but whenever she had to empty the bowl, the poison dripped on Loki's face, forcing him to jerk his head away and thrash against his bonds, which caused the earth to tremble.[84] In Greek mythology, Poseidon was the cause and god of earthquakes. When he was in a bad mood, he struck the ground with a trident, causing earthquakes and other calamities. He also used earthquakes to punish and inflict fear upon people as revenge.[85] In Japanese mythology, Namazu (鯰) is a giant catfish who causes earthquakes. Namazu lives in the mud beneath the earth and is guarded by the god Kashima, who restrains the fish with a stone. When Kashima lets his guard fall, Namazu thrashes about, causing violent earthquakes.[86] In the New Testament, Matthew's Gospel refers to earthquakes occurring both after the death of Jesus (Matthew 27:51, 54) and at his resurrection (Matthew 28:2).[87] Earthquakes form part of the picture through which Jesus portrays the beginning of the end of time.[88] In modern popular culture, the portrayal of earthquakes is shaped by the memory of great cities laid waste, such as Kobe in 1995 or San Francisco in 1906.[89] Fictional earthquakes tend to strike suddenly and without warning.[89] For this reason, stories about earthquakes generally begin with the disaster and focus on its immediate aftermath, as in Short Walk to Daylight (1972), The Ragged Edge (1968) or Aftershock: Earthquake in New York (1999).[89] A notable example is Heinrich von Kleist's classic novella, The Earthquake in Chile, which describes the destruction of Santiago in 1647. Haruki Murakami's short fiction collection After the Quake depicts the consequences of the Kobe earthquake of 1995. The most popular single earthquake in fiction is the hypothetical \"Big One\" expected of California's San Andreas Fault someday, as depicted in the novels Richter 10 (1996), Goodbye California (1977), 2012 (2009), and San Andreas (2015), among other works.[89] Jacob M. Appel's widely anthologized short story, A Comparative Seismology, features a con artist who convinces an elderly woman that an apocalyptic earthquake is imminent.[90] Contemporary depictions of earthquakes in film are variable in the manner in which they reflect human psychological reactions to the actual trauma that can be caused to directly afflicted families and their loved ones.[91] Disaster mental health response research emphasizes the need to be aware of the different roles of loss of family and key community members, loss of home and familiar surroundings, and loss of essential supplies and services to maintain survival.[92][93] Particularly for children, the clear availability of caregiving adults who can protect, nourish, and clothe them in the aftermath of the earthquake and help them make sense of what has befallen them is more important to their emotional and physical health than the simple giving of provisions.[94] As was observed after other disasters involving destruction and loss of life and their media depictions, recently observed in the 2010 Haiti earthquake, it is also believed to be important not to pathologize the reactions to loss and displacement or disruption of governmental administration and services, but rather to validate the reactions to support constructive problem-solving and reflection.[95] Phenomena similar to earthquakes have been observed on other planets (e.g., marsquakes on Mars) and on the Moon (e.g., moonquakes).",

                "content": "Our editors will review what you’ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article. Over the centuries, earthquakes have been responsible for millions of deaths and an incalculable amount of damage to property. Depending on their intensity, earthquakes (specifically, the degree to which they cause the ground’s surface to shake) can topple buildings and bridges, rupture gas pipelines and other infrastructure, and trigger landslides, tsunamis, and volcanoes. These phenomena are primarily responsible for deaths and injuries. Very great earthquakes occur on average about once per year. Earthquake waves, more commonly known as seismic waves, are vibrations generated by an earthquake and propagated within Earth or along its surface. There are four principal types of elastic waves: two, primary and secondary waves, travel within Earth, whereas the other two, Rayleigh and Love waves, called surface waves, travel along its surface. In addition, seismic waves can be produced artificially by explosions. Magnitude is a measure of the amplitude (height) of the seismic waves an earthquake’s source produces as recorded by seismographs. Seismologist Charles F. Richter created an earthquake magnitude scale using the logarithm of the largest seismic wave’s amplitude to base 10. Richter’s scale was originally for measuring the magnitude of earthquakes from magnitudes 3 to 7, limiting its usefulness. Today the moment magnitude scale, a closer measure of an earthquake’s total energy release, is preferred. Earthquakes can occur anywhere, but they occur mainly along fault lines (planar or curved fractures in the rocks of Earth’s crust), where compressional or tensional forces move rocks on opposite sides of a fracture. Faults extend from a few centimetres to many hundreds of kilometres. In addition, most of the world’s earthquakes occur within the Ring of Fire, a long horseshoe-shaped belt of earthquake epicentres, volcanoes, and tectonic plate boundaries fringing the Pacific basin. earthquake, any sudden shaking of the ground caused by the passage of seismic waves through Earth’s rocks. Seismic waves are produced when some form of energy stored in Earth’s crust is suddenly released, usually when masses of rock straining against one another suddenly fracture and “slip.” Earthquakes occur most often along geologic faults, narrow zones where rock masses move in relation to one another. The major fault lines of the world are located at the fringes of the huge tectonic plates that make up Earth’s crust. (See the table of major earthquakes.) Little was understood about earthquakes until the emergence of seismology at the beginning of the 20th century. Seismology, which involves the scientific study of all aspects of earthquakes, has yielded answers to such long-standing questions as why and how earthquakes occur. About 50,000 earthquakes large enough to be noticed without the aid of instruments occur annually over the entire Earth. Of these, approximately 100 are of sufficient size to produce substantial damage if their centres are near areas of habitation. Very great earthquakes occur on average about once per year. Over the centuries they have been responsible for millions of deaths and an incalculable amount of damage to property. Earth’s major earthquakes occur mainly in belts coinciding with the margins of tectonic plates. This has long been apparent from early catalogs of felt earthquakes and is even more readily discernible in modern seismicity maps, which show instrumentally determined epicentres. The most important earthquake belt is the Circum-Pacific Belt, which affects many populated coastal regions around the Pacific Ocean—for example, those of New Zealand, New Guinea, Japan, the Aleutian Islands, Alaska, and the western coasts of North and South America. It is estimated that 80 percent of the energy presently released in earthquakes comes from those whose epicentres are in this belt. The seismic activity is by no means uniform throughout the belt, and there are a number of branches at various points. Because at many places the Circum-Pacific Belt is associated with volcanic activity, it has been popularly dubbed the “Pacific Ring of Fire.” A second belt, known as the Alpide Belt, passes through the Mediterranean region eastward through Asia and joins the Circum-Pacific Belt in the East Indies. The energy released in earthquakes from this belt is about 15 percent of the world total. There also are striking connected belts of seismic activity, mainly along oceanic ridges—including those in the Arctic Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, and the western Indian Ocean—and along the rift valleys of East Africa. This global seismicity distribution is best understood in terms of its plate tectonic setting. Earthquakes are caused by the sudden release of energy within some limited region of the rocks of the Earth. The energy can be released by elastic strain, gravity, chemical reactions, or even the motion of massive bodies. Of all these the release of elastic strain is the most important cause, because this form of energy is the only kind that can be stored in sufficient quantity in the Earth to produce major disturbances. Earthquakes associated with this type of energy release are called tectonic earthquakes.",

                "content": "An earthquake is when Earth's tectonic plates shake and move Earth's surface. Strong earthquakes damage buildings. Disturbances in the Earth cause earthquakes. Different tectonic plates are slowly moving. When they get stuck, tension builds up in them. Earthquakes occur when tectonic plates suddenly break free, so they start moving quickly. The first point of an earthquake's rupture is called its hypocenter or focus. The epicenter is the point at ground level directly above the hypocenter. People who study earthquakes are called seismologists. Many earthquakes can occur in a small area in a short period of time. The sudden release of stress in the tectonic plates sends waves of energy that travel through the Earth. Seismology studies the cause, recurrence, type and magnitude of earthquakes. The effect of an earthquake can be measured with a seismometer. A seismometer detects the tremors of the earth and plots the tremors on a seismograph. The strength or magnitude of an earthquake can be measured using the Richter scale. The Richter scale was invented by Charles Francis Richter in 1935. The scale is numbered 0-10. A 2 on this scale is a tremor that is not easily recorded. And damage of size 5 (or more) in a wide area. The largest earthquake ever measured had a magnitude of 9.5. No one can tell when an earthquake will happen. But we know where earthquakes are likely to occur in the future, such as near fault lines. An earthquake under the ocean can create a huge wave called a tsunami. Tsunamis can also cause a lot of destruction. Earthquake zones are concentrated in some parts of the world. The first is the Pacific belt, which circles the Pacific Ocean. This part is the biggest seismic belt: it has the most active earthquakes and the most volcanoes.[1] The second part is the Alpide belt. It includes the seismic activities from Sumatra, to the Himalayas, to south Europe and north Africa, to the Atlantic Ocean. These belts are along the edges of tectonic plates. The tectonic plates push on each other and make great amounts of tension. Earthquakes sometimes hit cities and kill hundreds or thousands of people. Most earthquakes happen along the Pacific Ring of Fire but the biggest ones mostly happen in other places. Tectonically active places are places where earthquakes or volcanic eruptions are regularly repeated. Earthquakes are caused by tectonic movements in the Earth's crust. The main cause is when tectonic plates ride one over the other, causing orogeny (mountain building), and severe earthquakes.[2] The boundaries between moving plates form the largest fault surfaces on Earth. When they stick, motion between the plates leads to increasing stress. This continues until the stress rises and breaks, suddenly allowing sliding over the locked portion of the fault. This releases the stored energy as shock waves. The San Andreas fault in San Francisco, and Rift valley fault in Africa are faults like this. Earthquakes caused by volcanic eruptions can be quite devastating. However, these earthquakes are confined to areas around active volcanoes. Often the causes are not known, except in the most general terms. An example is the largest earthquake in the history of the United States: the 1811–1812 New Madrid earthquakes. These are described as caused by very deep shifts in ancient rock formations. In other words, the cause is not known in detail. In areas of intense mining activity, often the roofs of underground mines collapse and minor tremors take place. These are called collapse earthquakes. There are three main types of geological fault that may cause an earthquake: normal, reverse (thrust) and strike-slip. Normal faults occur mainly in areas where the crust is being extended. Reverse faults occur in areas where the crust is being shortened. Strike-slip faults are steep structures where the two sides of the fault slip horizontally past each other. Most earthquakes form part of a sequence, related to each other in terms of location and time.[3] Most earthquake clusters consist of small tremors which cause little to no damage, but there is a theory that earthquakes can recur in a regular pattern.[4] A foreshock is an earthquake that happens before a larger earthquake, called the mainshock. An aftershock is an earthquake that happens after a previous earthquake, the mainshock. An aftershock is in the same place of the main shock but always of a smaller magnitude. Aftershocks are formed as the crust adjusts to the effects of the main shock.[3] Earthquake swarms are sequences of earthquakes striking in a specific area within a short period of time. They are different from earthquakes followed by a series of aftershocks by the fact that no single earthquake in the sequence is obviously the main shock, therefore none have notably higher magnitudes than the other. An example of an earthquake swarm is the 2004 activity at Yellowstone National Park.[5] Sometimes a series of earthquakes happen in a sort of earthquake storm, where the earthquakes strike a fault in clusters, each triggered by the shaking or stress redistribution of the previous earthquakes. Similar to aftershocks but on adjacent segments of fault, these storms happen over the course of years, and with some of the later earthquakes as damaging as the early ones. Such a pattern happened in the North Anatolian fault in Turkey in the 20th century.[6][7] A tsunami is a chain of fast moving waves in the ocean caused by powerful earthquakes. They are very serious challenges for people's safety and for earthquake engineering. Those waves can flood coastal areas, destroy houses and even swipe away whole towns.[8] This is a danger for the whole mankind. Unfortunately, tsunamis cannot be prevented. However, there are warning systems[9] which may warn the population before the big waves reach the land to let them enough time to rush to safety. Earthquake-proof buildings are constructed to withstand the destructive force of an earthquake. This depends upon its type of construction, shape, mass distribution, and rigidity. Different combinations are used. Square, rectangular, and shell-shaped buildings can withstand earthquakes better than skyscrapers. To reduce stress, a building's ground floor can be supported by extremely rigid, empty columns, while the rest of the building is supported by flexible columns inside the empty columns. Another method is to use rollers or rubber pads to separate the base columns from the ground, allowing the columns to shake parallel to each other during an earthquake. To help prevent a roof from collapsing, builders make the roof out of light-weight materials. Outdoor walls are made with stronger and more reinforced materials such as steel or reinforced concrete. During an earthquake, flexible windows may help hold the windows together so they don't break.",

                "content": "Peter Morgan Alonso (born December 7, 1994), nicknamed \"Polar Bear\", is an American professional baseball first baseman who is a free agent. He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Mets. He made his MLB debut in 2019. Alonso played college baseball for the Florida Gators before the Mets selected him in the 2016 MLB draft. He made his MLB debut on Opening Day in 2019 and won the National League's Rookie of the Year award that year, setting a major league record for rookies with 53 home runs. Alonso is a four-time MLB All-Star that led the league in homers in 2019 and in RBI in 2022. He has also won the MLB Home Run Derby twice, in 2019 and 2021. Peter Morgan Alonso was born on December 7, 1994, in Tampa, Florida. His father, Peter Matthew Alonso, is the son of Spanish refugees who fled Barcelona during the Spanish Civil War and moved to Queens, a borough of New York City, but later settled in Lancaster, Ohio. His mother, Michelle Lynn Alonso (née Morgan), played college softball at Ohio Wesleyan University.[1][2] Alonso attended Jesuit High School in Tampa for his first two years of high school, and transferred to Henry B. Plant High School in Tampa to finish high school.[3][4] He played lacrosse and football as a freshman before deciding to focus solely on baseball.[5] For the baseball team, he was a third baseman.[6] Alonso enrolled at the University of Florida, where he played college baseball for the Florida Gators as a first baseman. He was named All-Southeastern Conference in his freshman year.[4] In 2014, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Madison Mallards of the Northwoods League,[7] and he was inducted into their Hall of Fame in 2024.[8][9] In the summer of 2015, he played for the Bourne Braves of the Cape Cod Baseball League.[10] In 2016, his junior year, he hit .374/.469/.659 with 14 home runs and 60 RBIs in 58 games.[11] He competed for Florida in the 2015 and 2016 College World Series.[12] The New York Mets selected Alonso in the second round, with the 64th pick overall, of the 2016 Major League Baseball draft.[6][13] He signed with the Mets for a $909,200 signing bonus,[14] and made his professional debut in 2016 with the Brooklyn Cyclones of the Class A-Short Season New York-Penn League. He posted a .322 batting average with five home runs and 21 RBIs in thirty games and was chosen to participate in the league's all-star game.[15] He began the 2017 season with the St. Lucie Mets of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League, and after batting .286 with 16 home runs and 58 RBIs in 82 games, was promoted to the Binghamton Rumble Ponies of the Class AA Eastern League in August,[16] where he batted .311 with two home runs and five RBIs in 11 games.[17] MLB.com ranked Alonso as New York's fourth-best prospect going into the 2018 season.[18] He began the 2018 season in Binghamton,[19] and received a midseason promotion to the Las Vegas 51s of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League. He represented the Mets in the 2018 All-Star Futures Game.[20] In 132 games between Binghamton and Las Vegas, he slashed .285/.395/.579 with 36 home runs and 119 RBIs.[21] He won the Joe Bauman Home Run Award.[22] That season, Alonso was the final batter in Cashman Field history, as he hit a walk-off home run in the bottom of the 9th inning during the last baseball game played at the facility.[23] Alonso made the Mets Opening Day roster in 2019 as the starting first baseman.[24] He was in the team's starting lineup on Opening Day on March 28, and recorded his first major league hit against Washington Nationals pitcher Justin Miller in the eighth inning.[25] First publicized on March 30, third-base coach Gary DiSarcina gave Alonso the endearing nickname \"Polar Bear\" for his power.[26] He hit his first major league home run on April 1 off of Drew Steckenrider of the Miami Marlins.[27] On April 9, Alonso had his first career multi-home run game against the Minnesota Twins.[28] Alonso became the first player in MLB history since 1900 with 11 extra-base hits in his first 10 career games. No other player ever had more than nine.[29] In April, Alonso batted .292 with nine home runs, eight doubles, one triple and 26 RBIs in his first games in the big leagues. He won the National League Rookie of the Month Award for April.[30] Alonso's nine home runs led all MLB rookies and are tied for the most by a Mets player before May 1 with Neil Walker (2016), John Buck (2013), Carlos Delgado (2006) and Dave Kingman (1976).[31] On June 22, Alonso hit his 26th home run, breaking the National League record for most home runs by a rookie before the All-Star break, passing Cody Bellinger. The next day, with his 27th home run, he broke the Mets rookie home run record, previously set by Darryl Strawberry in 1983.[32][33] Alonso was selected as a reserve to the 2019 All-Star Game.[34] He also won the National League Rookie of the Month Award for the month of June.[35] On July 7, Alonso became the second player in Mets history to hit the most home runs (30) before the All-Star break, after Dave Kingman (1976).[36] On July 8, Alonso won the 2019 MLB Home Run Derby, defeating Toronto Blue Jays third baseman Vladimir Guerrero Jr. 23–22 in the final round, becoming only the second rookie, after Aaron Judge, to win the Derby outright. On the way to the final round, Alonso also beat Carlos Santana and Ronald Acuña Jr., hitting 57 total home runs during the entire Derby.[37] On August 15, Alonso hit his 39th home run, tying Bellinger for the most home runs by a rookie in National League history. Alonso finished the game with a career-high five hits and six RBIs.[38] He broke Bellinger's record on August 18 with his 40th home run in an 11–5 win against the Kansas City Royals.[39] On August 27, Alonso hit his 42nd home run to become the Mets all-time single-season home run leader, surpassing Carlos Beltrán and Todd Hundley. He is the first rookie to set his franchise's single-season home run record since Johnny Rizzo did it for the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1938.[40] On September 27, Alonso hit his 52nd home run of the season, tying Aaron Judge for the most home runs by a rookie in MLB history.[41] He hit his 53rd the next day to break Judge's record.[42] His 53 home runs led all of Major League Baseball for the 2019 season. On November 11, Alonso was awarded the National League Rookie of the Year, receiving 29 of 30 first-place votes.[43][44] On December 10, Alonso was named to the first team of the inaugural All-MLB Team.[45] In the 2020 season shortened by COVID-19, Alonso played in 57 of the 60 games and batted .231/.326/.490 with 16 home runs and 35 RBIs.[46] On September 3, 2020, Alonso hit his first career walk-off home run.[47] Alonso's sophomore season was a step back from his breakout rookie year; Danny Abriano of Yahoo Sports called it \"a season to forget.\"[48] However, he had the highest maximum exit velocity of all major league hitters, at 118.4 miles per hour (190.5 km/h).[49] Alonso's sophomore slump coupled with a second consecutive breakout season from Dominic Smith led some talent evaluators to favor the latter as the team's starting first baseman heading into the 2021 season.[50] On July 12, Alonso won his second straight Home Run Derby after defeating Baltimore Orioles first baseman Trey Mancini 23–22 in the final round.[51] He became the third player ever to win back-to-back Home Run Derbys, as well as the fourth player to win two Home Run Derbys (after Ken Griffey Jr., Prince Fielder, and Yoenis Céspedes). Newsday Mets beat writer Tim Healey noted Alonso has earned $2 million from winning the Home Run Derby twice while making $1.47 million from 2019–2021 in base salary while playing for the Mets.[52] On September 7, Alonso hit his 100th career home run, off of Miami Marlins pitcher Edward Cabrera. He accomplished the feat in 347 games, becoming the second-fastest player to reach 100 career home runs behind Ryan Howard, who did it in 325 games.[53] Alonso played in 152 games for the Mets in 2021, batting .262/.344/.519 with 37 home runs and 94 RBIs. On March 22, 2022, Alonso signed a $7.4 million contract with the Mets, avoiding salary arbitration.[54] He hit his first career grand slam on April 9 against the Washington Nationals, off of pitcher Joan Adon.[55] On July 10, Alonso was named to the 2022 MLB All-Star Game, the second selection of his career,[56] He participated in the Home Run Derby, making it to the semifinals.[57] In a September 25 game against the Oakland Athletics, Alonso drove in five runs, setting a new Mets' single-season RBI record with 125.[58] He broke the record on a 451-foot (137 m) two-run home run in the fourth inning off of pitcher Norge Ruiz. The Mets previous RBI record was held by Mike Piazza (1999) and David Wright (2008).[59] On September 27 against the Miami Marlins, Alonso hit his 40th home run of the season, becoming the first Mets player to accomplish the feat twice.[60] In 2022, Alonso batted .271/.352/.518 with 40 home runs and 131 RBIs, breaking the franchise record and tying Aaron Judge for the most RBI in the major leagues.[61] Alonso and the Mets agreed to a $14.5 million salary for the 2023 season during the arbitration period.[62] On April 7, during a game against the Miami Marlins, Alonso hit his 150th career home run, passing Carlos Beltrán for sixth place on the Mets all-time home run list. He also became the second fastest player to 150 home runs (in 538 games) since Ryan Howard (495 games).[63] On June 7, Alonso was placed on the injured list when he suffered a bone bruise and left wrist sprain after being hit by a pitch.[64] He was expected to miss three to four weeks due to the injury, but recovered in just eleven days and was activated from the injured list on June 18.[65] On September 3, during a game against the Seattle Mariners, Alonso homered twice and drove in four runs, reaching 40-plus home runs and 100 RBIs for the second consecutive season. Alonso's two-run shot made him the fifth player in Major League history with at least three 40-home run seasons in his first five seasons of their career, joining Ralph Kiner (four seasons), Eddie Mathews, Ryan Howard, and Albert Pujols (each with 3 seasons).[66] On September 27, Alonso hit his 46th home run of the season in an 11–2 win over the Miami Marlins. His 192nd career homer made him tie Howard Johnson for 4th place on the Mets all-time home run list.[67][68] Alonso finished the 2023 season batting .217/.318/.504 with 46 home runs and 118 RBI.[69] The Mets and Alonso agreed on a one-year, $20.5 million contract to avoid salary arbitration on January 11, 2024.[70] On April 4, during a game against the Detroit Tigers, Alonso recorded his 500th career RBI on a game-tying home run off of pitcher Alex Faedo, becoming the 10th and fastest player in Mets history to achieve the milestone.[71][72] He then won NL Player of the Week honors on April 15.[73] On April 27 against the St. Louis Cardinals, Alonso hit his 200th career home run, off of pitcher Sonny Gray. He became the fourth-fastest player in MLB history to hit 200 home runs and the 4th Met to hit 200 career home runs.[74][75] On May 13, it was reported online that the Mets made an attempt to extend Alonso the previous season but they were unsuccessful, as he turned down a seven-year, $158 million contract extension from the team.[76] Alonso hit his 220th career home run on August 27 against the Arizona Diamondbacks, tying Mike Piazza for 3rd-place on the Mets all-time home run list.[77] Two days later, he would hit his 221st career homer, passing Piazza.[78][79] In 2024, Alonso appeared in 162 games for the Mets, making him the second player in Mets history to appear in every game in a single-season. He finished the season batting .240/.329/.459 with 34 home runs and 88 RBI.[80] On October 3, in Game 3 the 2024 National League Wild Card Series against the Milwaukee Brewers, with the Mets down 2–0 in the top of the 9th inning, Alonso hit a go-ahead, three-run home run to give the Mets a 3–2 lead. They would then go on to win 4–2 and eliminate the Brewers from the playoffs.[81] With that home run, Alonso became the first major league player in history to hit a go-ahead homer while trailing in the ninth inning or later of a winner-take-all postseason game.[82] In the 2024 MLB postseason, Alonso played in 13 games for the Mets, batting .273/.431/.568 with 4 home runs and 10 RBI.[83] After the 2024 season, Alonso's contract with the Mets expired and became a free agent for the first time in his career.[84] The Mets offered him a qualifying offer on November 2, which he declined on November 19.[85] On August 17, 2022, Alonso announced that he would also join the United States national baseball team in the 2023 World Baseball Classic.[86] Alonso went 2-for-14 across five games, most notably starting an eighth inning rally with a base hit against Venezuela in the quarterfinals, and later hitting an RBI single against Cuba in the semifinals.[87][88] Alonso first got his \"Polar Bear\" nickname when he was a top prospect. He made such a big impression during spring training in 2019 that Mets third baseman Todd Frazier, who was known for giving players nicknames, is the one who first coined it. Frazier said to Alonso, \"You look like a big, damn polar bear.\" \"And then it just kind of stuck,\" Alonso said during his rookie season.[89][90] Alonso married Haley Walsh on November 12, 2021, at Sacred Heart Catholic Church in downtown Tampa. She is originally from Boston; they met in the summer of 2015 while he was playing in the Cape Cod collegiate summer league. They carried on a long-distance relationship while he continued at the University of Florida and she attended Michigan State University. They were engaged in November 2018.[91][92] In 2020, the couple formed The Alonso Foundation, a charitable organization that supports youth, veteran, and animal causes.[93] On March 13, 2022, Alonso was involved in a car accident in Tampa, Florida, which he described as a \"really close experience to death.\" A driver ran a red light and struck Alonso's vehicle, which flipped over three times. Neither Alonso nor anyone else involved in the incident was injured.[94] An avid outdoorsman, he enjoys hunting and fishing. He was also featured in a season 9 episode of MeatEater in which he hunted mule deer in Colorado with Steven Rinella.[95]",

                "title": "Pete Alonso learning Spanish for Mets teammates",
                "content": "Anthony DiComo PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. -- A month after the Mets drafted him, in his debut for what was then Class A Short-Season Brooklyn, Pete Alonso experienced a bit of Minor League culture shock. Starting pitcher Harol González, a 21-year-old Spanish-speaking prospect, was in a jam. As the infield gathered around for a mound visit, Spanish-speaking catcher Ali Sánchez and English-speaking pitching coach Bill Bryk began trying to communicate with González. No one could follow the conversation. In what would become a regular occurrence in his life as a big leaguer, Alonso did his best to translate -- relatively unsuccessfully that day, but far more adequately in the months and years to come. Over his career, Alonso, who homered in the Mets' 8-4 win over the Marlins on Wednesday, has endeavored to achieve a level of fluency in Spanish, seeing it not only as an on-field skill but as a way to bond with teammates. He uses it regularly on first base and in the clubhouse, in situations both serious and casual. As Alonso puts it, “I don’t know if I can talk my way out of an arrest, but I’m pretty decent.” “I appreciate that he’s trying to find a way to interact with us,” said bilingual teammate Francisco Lindor. Alonso’s education began in childhood, during visits with his grandfather and great-aunt who emigrated from Spain in the 1930s. As they grew elderly, those two began losing the English skills they had picked up after coming to America, which forced Alonso to use more of his primitive Spanish to communicate with them. By the fourth grade, Alonso was learning formally at his Florida school, where students were not given the choice to learn French, Italian or Latin. Spanish, for its prominence in the general population, was a requirement. But it was not until Alonso’s years in the Minor Leagues that he “really started to get pretty decent.” Immersed in a clubhouse with players from the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Venezuela and beyond, Alonso saw Spanish as a tool to learn about his teammates. Prospects from those countries typically take classes in English, but their American counterparts are not expected to reciprocate. As a result, cliques tend to form in the lower Minors. “The majority of these guys don’t know Spanish,” Alonso said, gesturing from one end of the room to the other, “and the majority of these guys don’t know English. How do you make that work?” Practice helps. Alonso hasn’t tried any language learning software in his free time, but his daily work environment features plenty of conversation partners -- more than one-third of those on the Mets’ spring roster are fluent in Spanish. He has used it to conduct interviews with Latino media outlets. On a recent vacation to Italy, Alonso tried communicating with both the Italian he learned in college as well as some Spanish, which is more widely understood than English in parts of that country. “When someone is trying to learn another language, it starts selfishly -- like you want to learn the other language, you want to expand your vocabulary,” Lindor said. “But it turns into a form of trying to bond with your teammates, trying to understand them.\" Other North American players have endeavored to learn Spanish over the years -- Cincinnati’s Joey Votto is one prominent example -- but such cases are relatively few and far between. Lindor could recall only one other Minor League teammate who took the time to do it with any level of thoroughness. Alonso is the exception. Even when talking to truly bilingual teammates such as Lindor, he doesn’t shy away from Spanish, despite the fact that he still struggles with complex sentences and conjugation. He credits some of the friendships he’s made in pro ball to his ability to speak the language or even just to his willingness to try. Younger players see it and appreciate the effort.

I think [speaking their language] helps a lot.” These days, however, English and Spanish are no longer the only tongues one can hear in the clubhouse. The Mets have a new player in Kodai Senga, who isn’t fluent in either. Challenge accepted, says Alonso: “Now, I’ve got to brush up on my Japanese.\"",

                "content": "North Korea,[d] officially the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK),[e] is a country in East Asia. It constitutes the northern half of the Korean Peninsula and borders China and Russia to the north at the Yalu (Amnok) and Tumen rivers, and South Korea to the south at the Korean Demilitarized Zone.[f] The country's western border is formed by the Yellow Sea, while its eastern border is defined by the Sea of Japan. North Korea, like its southern counterpart, claims to be the sole legitimate government of the entire peninsula and adjacent islands. Pyongyang is the capital and largest city. The Korean Peninsula was first inhabited as early as the Lower Paleolithic period. Its first kingdom was noted in Chinese records in the early 7th century BCE. Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea into Silla and Balhae in the late 7th century, Korea was ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) and the Joseon dynasty (1392–1897). The succeeding Korean Empire (1897–1910) was annexed in 1910 into the Empire of Japan. In 1945, after the Japanese surrender at the end of World War II, Korea was divided into two zones along the 38th parallel, with the north occupied by the Soviet Union and the south occupied by the United States. In 1948, separate governments were formed in Korea: the socialist and Soviet-aligned Democratic People's Republic of Korea in the north, and the capitalist, Western-aligned Republic of Korea in the south. North Korean invasion of South Korea in 1950 started the Korean War. In 1953, the Korean Armistice Agreement brought about a ceasefire and established a demilitarized zone (DMZ), but no formal peace treaty has ever been signed. Post-war North Korea benefited greatly from economic aid and expertise provided by other Eastern Bloc countries. However, Kim Il Sung, North Korea's first leader, promoted his personal philosophy of Juche as the state ideology. Pyongyang's international isolation sharply accelerated from the 1980s onwards as the Cold War came to an end. The fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 then brought about a sharp decline to the North Korean economy. From 1994 to 1998, North Korea suffered a famine with the population continuing to suffer from malnutrition. In 2024, the DPRK formally abandoned efforts to peacefully reunify Korea.[11] North Korea is a totalitarian dictatorship with a comprehensive cult of personality around the Kim family. Amnesty International considers the country to have the worst human rights record in the world. Officially, North Korea is an \"independent socialist state\"[g] which holds democratic elections; however, outside observers have described the elections as unfair, uncompetitive, and pre-determined, in a manner similar to elections in the Soviet Union. The Workers' Party of Korea is the ruling party of North Korea. According to Article 3 of the constitution, Kimilsungism–Kimjongilism is the official ideology of North Korea. The means of production are owned by the state through state-run enterprises and collectivized farms. Most services—such as healthcare, education, housing, and food production—are subsidized or state-funded. North Korea follows Songun, a \"military first\" policy which prioritizes the Korean People's Army in state affairs and the allocation of resources. It possesses nuclear weapons. Its active-duty army of 1.28 million soldiers is the fourth-largest in the world. In addition to being a member of the United Nations since 1991, North Korea is also a member of the Non-Aligned Movement, G77, and the ASEAN Regional Forum. The modern spelling of Korea first appeared in 1671 in the travel writings of the Dutch East India Company's Hendrick Hamel.[13] After the division of the country into North and South Korea, the two sides used different terms to refer to Korea: Chosun or Joseon (조선) in North Korea, and Hanguk (한국) in South Korea. In 1948, North Korea adopted Democratic People's Republic of Korea (Korean: 조선민주주의인민공화국, Chosŏn Minjujuŭi Inmin Konghwaguk; listenⓘ) as its official name. In the wider world, because its government controls the northern part of the Korean Peninsula, it is commonly called North Korea to distinguish it from South Korea, which is officially called the Republic of Korea in English. Both governments consider themselves to be the legitimate government of the whole of Korea.[14][15] For this reason, the people do not consider themselves as 'North Koreans' but as Koreans in the same divided country as their compatriots in the South, and foreign visitors are discouraged from using the former term.[16] According to Korean mythology in 2333 BCE, the Gojoseon Kingdom was established by the god-king Dangun. Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea under the name Unified Silla in 668 AD, Korea was subsequently ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) and the Joseon dynasty (1392–1897). In 1897, King Gojong proclaimed the Korean Empire, which was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910.[19] From 1910 to the end of World War II in 1945, Korea was under Japanese rule. Most Koreans were peasants engaged in subsistence farming.[20] In the 1930s, Japan developed mines, hydro-electric dams, steel mills, and manufacturing plants in northern Korea and neighboring Manchuria.[21] The Korean industrial working class expanded rapidly, and many Koreans went to work in Manchuria.[22] As a result, 65% of Korea's heavy industry was located in the north, but, due to the rugged terrain, only 37% of its agriculture.[23] Northern Korea had little exposure to modern, Western ideas.[24] One partial exception was the penetration of religion. Since the arrival of missionaries in the late nineteenth century, the northwest of Korea, and Pyongyang in particular, had been a stronghold of Christianity.[25] As a result, Pyongyang was called the \"Jerusalem of the East\".[26] A Korean guerrilla movement emerged in the mountainous interior and in Manchuria, harassing the Japanese imperial authorities. One of the most prominent guerrilla leaders was the Communist Kim Il Sung.[27] After the Japanese surrender at the end of World War II in 1945, the Korean Peninsula was divided into two zones along the 38th parallel, with the northern half of the peninsula occupied by the Soviet Union and the southern half by the United States. Negotiations on reunification failed. Soviet general Terenty Shtykov recommended the establishment of the Soviet Civil Administration in October 1945, and supported Kim Il Sung as chairman of the Provisional People's Committee of North Korea, established in February 1946. In September 1946, South Korean citizens rose up against the Allied Military Government. In April 1948, an uprising of the Jeju islanders was violently crushed. The South declared its statehood in May 1948 and two months later the ardent anti-communist Syngman Rhee[28] became its ruler. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea was established in the North on 9 September 1948. Shtykov served as the first Soviet ambassador, while Kim Il Sung became premier. Soviet forces withdrew from the North in 1948, and most American forces withdrew from the South in 1949. Ambassador Shtykov suspected Rhee was planning to invade the North and was sympathetic to Kim's goal of Korean unification under socialism. The two successfully lobbied Soviet leader Joseph Stalin to support a quick war against the South, which culminated in the outbreak of the Korean War.[29][30][31][32] The military of North Korea invaded the South on 25 June 1950, and swiftly overran most of the country. The United Nations Command (UNC) was subsequently established following the UN Security Council's recognition of North Korean aggression against South Korea. The motion passed because the Soviet Union, a close ally of North Korea and a member of the UN Security Council, was boycotting the UN over its recognition of the Republic of China rather than the People's Republic of China.[33] The UNC, led by the United States, intervened to defend the South, and rapidly advanced into North Korea. As they neared the border with China, Chinese forces intervened on behalf of North Korea, shifting the balance of the war again. Fighting ended on 27 July 1953, with an armistice that approximately restored the original boundaries between North and South Korea, but no peace treaty was signed.[34] Approximately 3 million people died in the Korean War, with a higher proportional civilian death toll than World War II or the Vietnam War.[35][36][37][38][39] In both per capita and absolute terms, North Korea was the country most devastated by the war, which resulted in the death of an estimated 12–15% of the North Korean population (c. 10 million), \"a figure close to or surpassing the proportion of Soviet citizens killed in World War II,\" according to Charles K. Armstrong.[40] As a result of the war, almost every substantial building in North Korea was destroyed.[41][42] Some have referred to the conflict as a civil war, with other factors involved.[43] A heavily guarded demilitarized zone (DMZ) still divides the peninsula, and an anti-communist and anti-North Korea sentiment remains in South Korea. Since the war, the United States has maintained a strong military presence in the South which is depicted by the North Korean government as an imperialist occupation force.[44] It claims that the Korean War was caused by the United States and South Korea.[45] In October 2024, North Korea claims that 1.4 million people have joined its military after accusing South Korea of a drone intrusion. In response, South Korea is restricting leaflet launches near the border to prevent potential conflict, while both sides engage in psychological warfare, including disturbing broadcasts at the border.[46][47] The post-war 1950s and 1960s saw an ideological shift in North Korea, as Kim Il Sung sought to consolidate his power. Kim Il Sung was highly critical of Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev and his de-Stalinization policies and critiqued Khrushchev as revisionist.[48] During the 1956 August Faction Incident, Kim Il Sung successfully resisted efforts by the Soviet Union and China to depose him in favor of Soviet Koreans or the pro-Chinese Yan'an faction.[49][50] Some scholars believe that the 1956 August incident was an example of North Korea demonstrating political independence.[49][50][51] However, most scholars consider the final withdrawal of Chinese troops from North Korea in October 1958 to be the latest date when North Korea became effectively independent. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, North Korea sought to distinguish itself internationally by becoming a leader of the Non-Aligned Movement and promoting the ideology of Juche.[52] In United States policymaking, North Korea was considered among the Captive Nations.[53] Despite its efforts to break out of the Soviet and Chinese spheres of influence, North Korea remained closely aligned with both countries throughout the Cold War.[54] Industry was the favored sector in North Korea. Industrial production returned to pre-war levels by 1957. In 1959, relations with Japan had improved somewhat, and North Korea began allowing the repatriation of Japanese citizens in the country. The same year, North Korea revalued the North Korean won, which held greater value than its South Korean counterpart. Until the 1960s, economic growth was higher than in South Korea, and North Korean GDP per capita was equal to that of its southern neighbor as late as 1976.[55] However, by the 1980s, the economy had begun to stagnate; it started its long decline in 1987 and almost completely collapsed after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, when all Soviet aid was suddenly halted.[56] An internal CIA study acknowledged various achievements of the North Korean government post-war: compassionate care for war orphans and children in general, a radical improvement in the status of women, free housing, free healthcare, and health statistics particularly in life expectancy and infant mortality that were comparable to even the most advanced nations up until the North Korean famine.[57] Life expectancy in the North was 72 before the famine which was only marginally lower than in the South.[58] The country once boasted a comparatively developed healthcare system; pre-famine North Korea had a network of nearly 45,000 family practitioners with some 800 hospitals and 1,000 clinics.[59] The relative peace between the North and South following the armistice was interrupted by border skirmishes, celebrity abductions, and assassination attempts. The North failed in several assassination attempts on South Korean leaders, such as in 1968, 1974, and the Rangoon bombing in 1983; tunnels were found under the DMZ and tensions flared over the axe murder incident at Panmunjom in 1976.[60] For almost two decades after the war, the two states did not seek to negotiate with one another. In 1971, secret, high-level contacts began to be conducted culminating in the 1972 July 4 South–North Joint Statement that established principles of working toward peaceful reunification. The talks ultimately failed because in 1973, South Korea declared its preference that the two Koreas should seek separate memberships in international organizations.[61] The Soviet Union was dissolved on 26 December 1991, ending its aid and support to North Korea. In 1992, as Kim Il Sung's health began deteriorating, his son Kim Jong Il slowly began taking over various state tasks. Kim Il Sung died of a heart attack in 1994; Kim Jong Il declared a three-year period of national mourning, afterward officially announcing his position as the new leader.[62] North Korea promised to halt its development of nuclear weapons under the Agreed Framework, negotiated with U.S. president Bill Clinton and signed in 1994. Building on Nordpolitik, South Korea began to engage with the North as part of its Sunshine Policy.[63][64] Kim Jong Il instituted a policy called Songun, or \"military first\".[65] Flooding in the mid-1990s exacerbated the economic crisis, severely damaging crops and infrastructure and leading to widespread famine that the government proved incapable of curtailing, resulting in the deaths of between 240,000 and 420,000 people. Which led many North Koreans to flee into China, South Korea and neighboring countries. In China, these illegal North Korea child immigrants are called the Kotjebi. In 1996, the government accepted UN food aid.[66] The international environment changed once George W. Bush became U.S. President in 2001. His administration rejected South Korea's Sunshine Policy and the Agreed Framework. Bush included North Korea in his axis of evil in his 2002 State of the Union Address. The U.S. government accordingly treated North Korea as a rogue state, while North Korea redoubled its efforts to acquire nuclear weapons.[67][68][69] On 9 October 2006, North Korea announced it had conducted its first nuclear weapons test.[70][71] U.S. President Barack Obama adopted a policy of \"strategic patience\", resisting making deals with North Korea.[72] Tensions with South Korea and the United States increased in 2010 with the sinking of the South Korean warship Cheonan[73] and North Korea's shelling of Yeonpyeong Island.[74][75] On 17 December 2011, Kim Jong Il died from a heart attack. His youngest son Kim Jong Un was announced as his successor.[76] In the face of international condemnation, North Korea continued to develop its nuclear arsenal, possibly including a hydrogen bomb and a missile capable of reaching the United States.[77] Throughout 2017, following Donald Trump's ascension to the US presidency, tensions between the United States and North Korea increased, and there was heightened rhetoric between the two, with Trump threatening \"fire and fury\" if North Korea ever attacked U.S. territory[78] amid North Korean threats to test missiles that would land near Guam.[79] The tensions substantially decreased in 2018, and a détente developed.[80] A series of summits took place between Kim Jong Un of North Korea, President Moon Jae-in of South Korea, and President Trump.[81] On 10 January 2021, Kim Jong Un was formally elected as the General Secretary in 8th Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea, a title previously held by Kim Jong Il.[82] On 24 March 2022, North Korea conducted a successful ICBM test launch for the first time since the 2017 crisis.[83] In September 2022, North Korea passed a law that declared itself a nuclear state.[84] On December 30, 2023, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un provocatively declared South Korea a \"colonial vassal state\",[85] marking a significant departure from the longstanding position of mutual claims over the entire Korean Peninsula by both North and South Korea. This statement was followed by a call on January 15, 2024, for a constitutional amendment to redefine the boundary with South Korea as the 'Southern National Borderline,' further intensifying the rhetoric against South Korea. Kim Jong-un also stated that in the event of a war, North Korea would seek to annex the entirety of South Korea.[86] North Korea occupies the northern portion of the Korean Peninsula, lying between latitudes 37° and 43°N, and longitudes 124° and 131°E. It covers an area of 120,540 square kilometers (46,541 sq mi).[2] To its west are the Yellow Sea and Korea Bay, and to its east lies Japan across the Sea of Japan. Early European visitors to Korea remarked that the country resembled \"a sea in a heavy gale\" because of the many successive mountain ranges that crisscross the peninsula.[87] Some 80 percent of North Korea is composed of mountains and uplands, separated by deep and narrow valleys. All of the Korean Peninsula's mountains with elevations of 2,000 meters (6,600 ft) or more are located in North Korea. The highest point in North Korea is Paektu Mountain, a volcanic mountain with an elevation of 2,744 meters (9,003 ft) above sea level.[87] Considered a sacred place by North Koreans, Mount Paektu holds significance in Korean culture and has been incorporated in the elaborate folklore and personality cult around the Kim family.[88] For example, the song, \"We Will Go To Mount Paektu\" sings in praise of Kim Jong Un and describes a symbolic trek to the mountain. Other prominent ranges are the Hamgyong Range in the extreme northeast and the Rangrim Mountains, which are located in the north-central part of North Korea. Mount Kumgang in the Taebaek Range, which extends into South Korea, is famous for its scenic beauty.[87] The coastal plains are wide in the west and discontinuous in the east. A great majority of the population lives in the plains and lowlands. According to a United Nations Environmental Programme report in 2003, forest covers over 70 percent of the country, mostly on steep slopes.[89] North Korea had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 8.02/10, ranking it 28th globally out of 172 countries.[90] The longest river is the Amnok (Yalu) River which flows for 790 kilometers (491 mi).[91] The country contains three terrestrial ecoregions: Central Korean deciduous forests, Changbai Mountains mixed forests, and Manchurian mixed forests.[92] North Korea experiences a humid continental climate within the Köppen climate classification scheme. Winters bring clear weather interspersed with snow storms as a result of northern and northwestern winds that blow from Siberia.[93] Summer tends to be by far the hottest, most humid, and rainiest time of year because of the southern and southeastern monsoon winds that carry moist air from the Pacific Ocean. Approximately 60 percent of all precipitation occurs from June to September.[93] Spring and autumn are transitional seasons between summer and winter. The daily average high and low temperatures for Pyongyang are −3 and −13 °C (27 and 9 °F) in January and 29 and 20 °C (84 and 68 °F) in August.[93] North Korea functions as a highly centralized, one-party totalitarian dictatorship.[94][95][96][97] According to its constitution, it is a self-described revolutionary and socialist state \"guided in its building and activities only by great Kimilsungism–Kimjongilism\".[98] In addition to the constitution, North Korea is governed by the Ten Principles for the Establishment of a Monolithic Ideological System (also known as the \"Ten Principles of the One-Ideology System\") which establishes standards for governance and a guide for the behaviors of North Koreans.[99] The Workers' Party of Korea (WPK), a communist party led by a member of the Kim family,[100][101] has an estimated 6.5 million members[102] and is in control of North Korean politics. It has two satellite parties, the Korean Social Democratic Party and the Chondoist Chongu Party.[103] Kim Jong Un of the Kim family is the current Supreme Leader or Suryeong of North Korea.[104] He heads all major governing structures: he is the general secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea and president of the State Affairs.[105][106] His grandfather Kim Il Sung, the founder and leader of North Korea until his death in 1994, is the country's \"eternal President\",[107] while his father Kim Jong Il who succeeded Kim Il Sung as the leader was announced \"Eternal General Secretary\" and \"Eternal Chairman of the National Defence Commission\" after his death in 2011.[105] According to the constitution, there are officially three main branches of government. The first of these is the State Affairs Commission (SAC), which acts as \"the supreme national guidance organ of state sovereignty\".[108][109] Its role is to deliberate and decide the work on defense building of the State, including major policies of the State, and to carry out the directions of the president of the commission, Kim Jong Un.[110] The SAC also directly supervises the Ministry of Defence, Ministry of State Security and the Ministry of Social Security.[110] Legislative power is held by the unicameral Supreme People's Assembly (SPA).[111] Its 687 members are elected every five years by universal suffrage,[112] though the elections have been described by outside observers as similar to elections in the Soviet Union.[113][114] Elections in North Korea have also been described as a form of government census, due to the near 100% turnout. Although the elections are not pluralistic, North Korean state media describes the elections as \"an expression of the absolute support and trust of all voters in the DPRK government\".[115][116] Supreme People's Assembly sessions are convened by the SPA Standing Committee, whose Chairman (Choe Ryong-hae since 2019) is the third-ranking official in North Korea.[117] Deputies formally elect the chairman, the vice chairpersons and members of the Standing Committee and take part in the constitutionally appointed activities of the legislature: pass laws, establish domestic and foreign policies, appoint members of the cabinet, review and approve the state economic plan, among others.[118] The SPA itself cannot initiate any legislation independently of party or state organs. It is unknown whether it has ever criticized or amended bills placed before it, and the elections are based around a single list of WPK-approved candidates who stand without opposition.[119] Executive power is vested in the Cabinet of North Korea, which has been headed by Premier Kim Tok Hun since 14 August 2020,[120] who's officially the second-ranking official after Kim Jong Un.[117] The Premier represents the government and functions independently. His authority extends over two vice premiers, 30 ministers, two cabinet commission chairmen, the cabinet chief secretary, the president of the Central Bank, the director of the Central Bureau of Statistics and the president of the Academy of Sciences.[121] North Korea, like its southern counterpart, claims to be the legitimate government of the entire Korean Peninsula and adjacent islands.[122] Despite its official title as the \"Democratic People's Republic of Korea\", some observers have described North Korea's political system as a \"hereditary dictatorship\".[123][124][125] It has also been described as a Stalinist dictatorship.[126][127][128][129] Kimilsungism–Kimjongilism is the official ideology of North Korea and the WPK, and is the cornerstone of party works and government operations.[98] Juche, part of the larger Kimilsungism–Kimjongilism along with Songun under Kim Jong Un,[130] is viewed by the official North Korean line as an embodiment of Kim Il Sung's wisdom, an expression of his leadership, and an idea which provides \"a complete answer to any question that arises in the struggle for national liberation\".[131] Juche was pronounced in December 1955 in a speech called On Eliminating Dogmatism and Formalism and Establishing Juche in Ideological Work in order to emphasize a Korea-centered revolution.[131] Its core tenets are economic self-sufficiency, military self-reliance and an independent foreign policy. The roots of Juche were made up of a complex mixture of factors, including the popularity of Kim Il Sung, the conflict with pro-Soviet and pro-Chinese dissenters, and Korea's centuries-long struggle for independence.[132] Juche was introduced into the constitution in 1972.[133][134] Juche was initially promoted as a \"creative application\" of Marxism–Leninism, but in the mid-1970s, it was described by state propaganda as \"the only scientific thought... and most effective revolutionary theoretical structure that leads to the future of communist society\".[135] Juche eventually replaced Marxism–Leninism entirely by the 1980s,[136] and in 1992 references to the latter were omitted from the constitution.[137] The 2009 constitution dropped references to communism and elevated the Songun military first policy while explicitly confirming the position of Kim Jong Il.[138] However, the constitution retains references to socialism.[139] The WPK reasserted its commitment to communism in 2021.[140] Juche's concepts of self-reliance have evolved with time and circumstances, but still provide the groundwork for the spartan austerity, sacrifice, and discipline demanded by the party.[141] Since the founding of the nation, North Korea's supreme leadership has stayed within the Kim family, which in North Korea is referred to as the Mount Paektu Bloodline. It is a three-generation lineage descending from the country's first leader, Kim Il Sung, who developed North Korea around the Juche ideology, and stayed in power until his death.[142] Kim developed a cult of personality closely tied to the state philosophy of Juche, which was later passed on to his successors: his son Kim Jong Il in 1994 and grandson Kim Jong Un in 2011. In 2013, Clause 2 of Article 10 of the newly edited Ten Fundamental Principles of the Workers' Party of Korea stated that the party and revolution must be carried \"eternally\" by the \"Mount Paektu Bloodline\".[143] According to New Focus International, the cult of personality, particularly surrounding Kim Il Sung, has been crucial for legitimizing the family's hereditary succession.[144] The control the North Korean government exercises over many aspects of the nation's culture is used to perpetuate the cult of personality surrounding Kim Il Sung,[145] and Kim Jong Il.[146] While visiting North Korea in 1979, journalist Bradley Martin wrote that nearly all music, art, and sculpture that he observed glorified \"Great Leader\" Kim Il Sung, whose personality cult was then being extended to his son, \"Dear Leader\" Kim Jong Il.[147] Claims that the family has been deified are contested by B. R. Myers: \"Divine powers have never been attributed to either of the two Kims. In fact, the propaganda apparatus in Pyongyang has generally been careful not to make claims that run directly counter to citizens' experience or common sense.\"[148] He further explains that the state propaganda painted Kim Jong Il as someone whose expertise lay in military matters and that the famine of the 1990s was partially caused by natural disasters out of Kim Jong Il's control.[149] The song \"No Motherland Without You\", sung by the North Korean army choir, was created especially for Kim Jong Il and is one of the most popular tunes in the country. Kim Il Sung is still officially revered as the nation's \"Eternal President\". Several landmarks in North Korea are named for Kim Il Sung, including Kim Il Sung University, Kim Il Sung Stadium, and Kim Il Sung Square. Defectors have been quoted as saying that North Korean schools deify both father and son.[150] Kim Il Sung rejected the notion that he had created a cult around himself and accused those who suggested this of \"factionalism\".[151] Following the death of Kim Il Sung, North Koreans were prostrating and weeping to a bronze statue of him in an organized event;[152] similar scenes were broadcast by state television following the death of Kim Jong Il.[153] Critics maintain that Kim Jong Il's personality cult was inherited from his father. Kim Jong Il was often the center of attention throughout ordinary life. His birthday is one of the most important public holidays in the country. On his 60th birthday (based on his official date of birth), mass celebrations occurred throughout the country.[154] Kim Jong Il's personality cult, although significant, was not as extensive as his father's. One point of view is that Kim Jong Il's cult of personality was solely out of respect for Kim Il Sung or out of fear of punishment for failure to pay homage,[155] while North Korean government sources consider it genuine hero worship.[156] As a result of its isolation, North Korea is sometimes known as the \"hermit kingdom\", a term that originally referred to the isolationism in the latter part of the Joseon Dynasty.[157] Initially, North Korea had diplomatic ties only with other communist countries, and even today, most of the foreign embassies accredited to North Korea are located in Beijing rather than in Pyongyang.[158] In the 1960s and 1970s, it pursued an independent foreign policy, established relations with many developing countries, and joined the Non-Aligned Movement. In the late 1980s and the 1990s its foreign policy was thrown into turmoil with the collapse of the Soviet Bloc. Suffering an economic crisis, it closed a number of its embassies. At the same time, North Korea sought to build relations with developed free market countries.[159] North Korea joined the United Nations in 1991 together with South Korea. North Korea is also a member of the Non-Aligned Movement, G77 and the ASEAN Regional Forum.[160] As of 2015[update], North Korea had diplomatic relations with 166 countries and embassies in 47 countries.[159] North Korea does not have diplomatic relations with Argentina, Botswana,[161] Estonia, France,[162] Iraq, Israel, Japan, Taiwan,[163] the United States,[h] and Ukraine.[164][165][166] Germany is unusual in maintaining a North Korean embassy. German Ambassador Friedrich Lohr says most of his time in North Korea involved facilitating the delivery of humanitarian aid and agricultural assistance to a population plagued by food shortages.[167] North Korea enjoys a close relationship with China which is often called North Korea's closest ally.[168][169] Relations were strained beginning in 2006 because of China's concerns about North Korea's nuclear program.[170] Relations improved after Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party and Chinese President visited North Korea in June 2019.[171] North Korea continues to have strong ties with several Southeast Asian countries such as Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia,[172] and Indonesia. Relations with Malaysia were strained in 2017 by the assassination of Kim Jong-nam. North Korea has a close relationship with Russia and has voiced support for the Russian invasion of Ukraine.[173][174] North Korea was previously designated a state sponsor of terrorism by the U.S.[175] because of its alleged involvement in the 1983 Rangoon bombing and the 1987 bombing of a South Korean airliner.[176] On 11 October 2008, the United States removed North Korea from its list of states that sponsor terrorism after Pyongyang agreed to cooperate on issues related to its nuclear program.[177] North Korea was re-designated a state sponsor of terrorism by the U.S. under the administration of Donald Trump on 20 November 2017 after continued nuclear tests.[178] The kidnapping of at least 13 Japanese citizens by North Korean agents in the 1970s and the 1980s has had a detrimental effect on North Korea's relationship with Japan.[179] US President Trump met with Kim in Singapore on 12 June 2018. An agreement was signed between the two countries endorsing the 2017 Panmunjom Declaration signed by North and South Korea, pledging to work towards denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula.[180] They met in Hanoi from 27 to 28 February 2019, but failed to achieve an agreement.[181] On 30 June 2019, Trump met with Kim along with South Korean president Moon Jae-in at the Korean DMZ.[182] The Korean Demilitarized Zone with South Korea remains the most heavily fortified border in the world.[183][184] Inter-Korean relations are at the core of North Korean diplomacy and have seen numerous shifts in the last few decades. North Korea's policy is to seek reunification without what it sees as outside interference, through a federal structure retaining each side's leadership and systems. In 1972, the two Koreas agreed in principle to achieve reunification through peaceful means and without foreign interference.[185] On 10 October 1980, the then North Korean leader Kim Il Sung proposed a federation between North and South Korea named the Democratic Federal Republic of Korea in which the respective political systems would initially remain.[186] However, relations remained cool well until the early 1990s, with a brief period in the early 1980s when North Korea offered to provide flood relief to its southern neighbor.[187] Although the offer was initially welcomed, talks over how to deliver the relief goods broke down and none of the promised aid ever crossed the border.[188] The two countries also organized a reunion of 92 separated families.[189] The Sunshine Policy instituted by South Korean president Kim Dae-jung in 1998 was a watershed in inter-Korean relations. It encouraged other countries to engage with the North, which allowed Pyongyang to normalize relations with a number of European Union states and contributed to the establishment of joint North-South economic projects. The culmination of the Sunshine Policy was the 2000 inter-Korean summit, when Kim Dae-jung visited Kim Jong Il in Pyongyang.[190] Both North and South Korea signed the June 15th North–South Joint Declaration, in which both sides promised to seek peaceful reunification.[191] On 4 October 2007, South Korean president Roh Moo-hyun and Kim Jong Il signed an eight-point peace agreement.[192] However, relations worsened when South Korean president Lee Myung-bak adopted a more hard-line approach and suspended aid deliveries pending the de-nuclearization of the North. In 2009, North Korea responded by ending all of its previous agreements with the South.[193] It deployed additional ballistic missiles[194] and placed its military on full combat alert after South Korea, Japan and the United States threatened to intercept a Unha-2 space launch vehicle.[195] The next few years witnessed a string of hostilities, including the alleged North Korean involvement in the sinking of South Korean warship Cheonan,[73] mutual ending of diplomatic ties,[196] a North Korean artillery attack on Yeonpyeong Island,[197] and growing international concern over North Korea's nuclear program.[198] In May 2017, Moon Jae-in was elected president of South Korea with a promise to return to the Sunshine Policy.[199] In February 2018, a détente developed at the Winter Olympics held in South Korea.[80] In April, South Korean president Moon Jae-in and Kim Jong Un met at the DMZ, and, in the Panmunjom Declaration, pledged to work for peace and nuclear disarmament.[200] In September, at a joint news conference in Pyongyang, Moon and Kim agreed upon turning the Korean Peninsula into a \"land of peace without nuclear weapons and nuclear threats\".[201] In January 2024, North Korea officially announced through its leader Kim Jong Un that it would no longer seek reunification with South Korea. Kim instead called for \"completely occupying, subjugating and reclaiming\" South Korea if war breaks out.[202] Kim Jong Un also announced to the Supreme People's Assembly that the constitution should be changed such that South Korea would be considered the \"primary foe and invariable principal enemy\" of North Korea.[203] Additionally, government agencies tasked with promoting reunification were closed.[204] The North Korean armed forces, or the Korean People's Army (KPA), is estimated to comprise 1,280,000 active and 6,300,000 reserve and paramilitary troops, making it one of the largest military institutions in the world.[205] With an active duty army consisting of 4.9% of its population, North Korea maintains the fourth largest active military force in the world behind China, India and the United States.[206] About 20 percent of men aged 17–54 serve in the regular armed forces,[206] and approximately one in every 25 citizens is an enlisted soldier.[207][208] The KPA is divided into five branches: Ground Force, Navy, Air and Anti-Air Force, Special Operations Force, and Rocket Force. Command of the KPA lies in both the Central Military Commission of the Workers' Party of Korea and the independent State Affairs Commission, which controls the Ministry of Defence.[209] Of all the KPA's branches, the Ground Force is the largest, comprising approximately one million personnel divided into 80 infantry divisions, 30 artillery brigades, 25 special warfare brigades, 20 mechanized brigades, 10 tank brigades and seven tank regiments.[210] It is equipped with 3,700 tanks, 2,100 armored personnel carriers and infantry fighting vehicles,[211] 17,900 artillery pieces, 11,000 anti-aircraft guns[212] and some 10,000 MANPADS and anti-tank guided missiles.[213] The Air Force is estimated to possess around 1,600 aircraft (with between 545 – 810 serving combat roles), while the Navy operates approximately 800 vessels, including the largest submarine fleet in the world.[205][214] The KPA's Special Operation Force is also the world's largest special forces unit.[214] North Korea is a nuclear-armed state,[207][215] though the nature and strength of the country's arsenal is uncertain. As of September 2023[update], estimates of its size ranged between 40 and 116 assembled nuclear warheads.[216] Delivery capabilities[217] are provided by the Rocket Force, which has some 1,000 ballistic missiles with a range of up to 11,900 km (7,400 mi).[218] According to a 2004 South Korean assessment, North Korea also possesses a stockpile of chemical weapons estimated to amount to between 2,500 and 5,000 tons, including nerve, blister, blood, and vomiting agents, as well as the ability to cultivate and produce biological weapons including anthrax, smallpox, and cholera.[219][220] As a result of its nuclear and missile tests, North Korea has been sanctioned under United Nations Security Council resolutions 1695 of July 2006, 1718 of October 2006, 1874 of June 2009, 2087 of January 2013,[221] and 2397 in December 2017. The sale of weapons to North Korea by other states is prohibited by UN sanctions, and the KPA's conventional capabilities are limited by a number of factors including obsolete equipment, insufficient fuel supplies and a shortage of digital command and control assets. To compensate for these deficiencies, the KPA has deployed a wide range of asymmetric warfare technologies including anti-personnel blinding lasers,[222] GPS jammers,[223] midget submarines and human torpedoes,[224] stealth paint,[225] and cyberwarfare units.[226] In 2015, North Korea was reported to employ 6,000 sophisticated computer security personnel in a cyberwarfare unit operating out of China.[227] KPA units were blamed for the 2014 Sony Pictures hack[227] and have allegedly attempted to jam South Korean military satellites.[228] Much of the equipment in use by the KPA is engineered and manufactured by the domestic defense industry. Weapons are manufactured in roughly 1,800 underground defense industry plants scattered throughout the country, most of them located in Chagang Province.[229] The defense industry is capable of producing a full range of individual and crew-operated weapons, artillery, armored vehicles, tanks, missiles, helicopters, submarines, landing and infiltration craft and Yak-18 trainers, and may even have limited jet aircraft manufacturing capacity.[230] According to North Korean state media, military expenditure amounted to 15.8 percent of the state budget in 2010.[231] The U.S. State Department has estimated that North Korea's military spending averaged 23% of its GDP from 2004 to 2014, the highest level in the world.[232] North Korea successfully tested a new type of submarine-launched ballistic missile on 19 October 2021.[233] North Korea has a civil law system based on the Prussian model and influenced by Japanese traditions and communist legal theory.[234] Judiciary procedures are handled by the Central Court (the highest court of appeal), provincial or special city-level courts, people's courts, and special courts. People's courts are at the lowest level of the system and operate in cities, counties and urban districts, while different kinds of special courts handle cases related to military, railroad, or maritime matters.[235] Judges are elected by their respective local people's assemblies, but this vote tends to be overruled by the Workers' Party of Korea. The penal code is based on the principle of nullum crimen sine lege (no crime without a law), but remains a tool for political control despite several amendments reducing ideological influence.[235] Courts carry out legal procedures related to not only criminal and civil matters, but also political cases as well.[236] Political prisoners are sent to labor camps, while criminal offenders are incarcerated in a separate system.[237] The Ministry of Social Security maintains most law enforcement activities. It is one of the most powerful state institutions in North Korea and oversees the national police force, investigates criminal cases and manages non-political correctional facilities.[238] It handles other aspects of domestic security like civil registration, traffic control, fire departments and railroad security.[239] The Ministry of State Security was separated from the Ministry of Public Security in 1973 to conduct domestic and foreign intelligence, counterintelligence and manage the political prison system. Political camps can be short-term reeducation zones or \"kwalliso\" (total control zones) for lifetime detention.[240] Camp 15 in Yodok[241] and Camp 18 in Pukchang[242] have been described in detailed testimonies.[243] The security apparatus is extensive,[230] exerting strict control over residence, travel, employment, clothing, food and family life.[244] Security forces employ mass surveillance. It is believed they tightly monitor cellular and digital communications.[245] North Korea has updated its constitution, labeling South Korea as a \"hostile state\" and abandoning its previous goal of peaceful reunification. This shift coincides with the destruction of inter-Korean connections and increased border defenses.[246] The state of human rights in North Korea has been widely condemned. A 2014 UN inquiry into the DPRK's human rights record found evidence for \"systematic, widespread and gross human rights violations\" and stated that \"the gravity, scale and nature of these violations reveal a state that does not have any parallel in the contemporary world\",[248] with Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch holding similar views.[249][250][251] North Koreans have been referred to as \"some of the world's most brutalized people\" by Human Rights Watch, because of the severe restrictions placed on their political and economic freedoms.[250][251] The North Korean population is strictly managed by the state and all aspects of daily life are subordinated to party and state planning. According to US government reports, employment is managed by the party on the basis of political reliability, and travel is tightly controlled by the Ministry of People's Security.[252] The US State Department says that North Koreans do not have a choice in the jobs they work and are not free to change jobs at will.[253] There are restrictions on the freedom of association, expression and movement; arbitrary detention, torture and other ill-treatment result in death and execution.[254] Citizens in North Korea are generally not permitted to leave the country[255] at will and its government denies access to UN human rights observers.[256] The Ministry of State Security extrajudicially apprehends and imprisons those accused of political crimes without due process.[257] People perceived as hostile to the government, such as Christians or critics of the leadership,[258] are deported to labor camps without trial,[259] often with their whole family and mostly without any chance of being released.[260] Forced labor is part of an established system of political repression.[253] Based on satellite images and defector testimonies, an estimated 200,000 prisoners are held in six large prison camps,[258][261] where they are made to work to right their wrongdoings.[262] Supporters of the government who deviate from the government line are subject to reeducation in sections of labor camps set aside for that purpose. Those who are deemed politically rehabilitated may reassume responsible government positions on their release.[263] The United Nations Commission of Inquiry has accused North Korea of crimes against humanity.[264][265][266] The International Coalition to Stop Crimes Against Humanity in North Korea (ICNK) estimates that over 10,000 people die in North Korean prison camps every year.[267] With 1,100,000 people in modern slavery (via forced labor), North Korea is ranked highest in the world in terms of the percentage of population in modern slavery, with 10.4 percent enslaved according to the Walk Free's 2018 Global Slavery Index.[268][269] North Korea is the only country in the world that has not explicitly criminalized any form of modern slavery.[270] A United Nations report listed slavery among the crimes against humanity occurring in North Korea.[271] According to the US State Department, the North Korean government does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of human trafficking and is not making significant efforts to do so.[253] North Korea has trafficked thousands of its own citizens allegedly as forced laborers to Russia,[272] Poland,[273] Malaysia,[274] various parts of Africa[275] and the Persian Gulf[276] where most of the laborers' earnings are pocketed by Pyongyang.[277] The North Korean government rejects the human rights abuse claims,[278][279][280] calling them a smear campaign and a human rights racket made to topple the government.[281][282][283] In a 2014 report to the UN, North Korea dismissed accusations of atrocities as wild rumors.[278] The official state media, KCNA, responded with an article that included homophobic insults against the author of the human rights report, Michael Kirby, calling him \"a disgusting old lecher with a 40-odd-year-long career of homosexuality ... This practice can never be found in the DPRK boasting of the sound mentality and good morals ... In fact, it is ridiculous for such gay [sic] to sponsor dealing with others' human rights issue.\"[279][280] The government, however, admitted some human rights issues related to living conditions and stated that it is working to improve them.[283] North Korea has maintained one of the most closed and centralized economies in the world since the 1940s.[284] For several decades, it followed the Soviet pattern of five-year plans with the ultimate goal of achieving self-sufficiency. Extensive Soviet and Chinese support allowed North Korea to rapidly recover from the Korean War and register very high growth rates. Systematic inefficiency began to arise around 1960, when the economy shifted from the extensive to the intensive development stage. The shortage of skilled labor, energy, arable land and transportation significantly impeded long-term growth and resulted in consistent failure to meet planning objectives.[285] The major slowdown of the economy contrasted with South Korea, which surpassed the North in terms of absolute GDP and per capita income by the 1980s.[286] North Korea declared the last seven-year plan unsuccessful in December 1993 and thereafter stopped announcing plans.[287] The loss of Eastern Bloc trading partners and a series of natural disasters throughout the 1990s caused severe hardships, including widespread famine. By 2000, the situation improved owing to a massive international food assistance effort, but the economy continues to suffer from food shortages, dilapidated infrastructure and a critically low energy supply.[288] In an attempt to recover from the collapse, the government began structural reforms in 1998 that formally legalized private ownership of assets and decentralized control over production.[289] A second round of reforms in 2002 led to an expansion of market activities, partial monetization, flexible prices and salaries, and the introduction of incentives and accountability techniques.[290] Despite these changes, North Korea remains a command economy where the state owns almost all means of production and development priorities are defined by the government.[288] North Korea has the structural profile of a relatively industrialized country[291] where nearly half of the gross domestic product is generated by industry[292] and human development is at medium levels.[293] Purchasing power parity (PPP) GDP is estimated at $40 billion,[5] with a very low per capita value of $1,800.[6] In 2012, gross national income per capita was $1,523, compared to $28,430 in South Korea.[294] The North Korean won is the national currency, issued by the Central Bank of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.[295] The economy has been developing dramatically in recent years despite sanctions. The Sejong Institute describes these changes as \"astonishing\".[296] The economy is heavily nationalized.[297] Food and housing are extensively subsidized by the state; education and healthcare are free;[298] and the payment of taxes was officially abolished in 1974.[299] A variety of goods are available in department stores and supermarkets in Pyongyang,[300] though most of the population relies on small-scale jangmadang markets.[301][302] In 2009, the government attempted to stem the expanding free market by banning jangmadang and the use of foreign currency,[288] heavily devaluing the won and restricting the convertibility of savings in the old currency,[303] but the resulting inflation spike and rare public protests caused a reversal of these policies.[304] Private trade is dominated by women because most men are required to be present at their workplace, even though many state-owned enterprises are non-operational.[305] Industry and services employ 65%[306] of North Korea's 12.6 million labor force.[307] Major industries include machine building, military equipment, chemicals, mining, metallurgy, textiles, food processing and tourism.[308] Iron ore and coal production are among the few sectors where North Korea performs significantly better than its southern neighbor—it produces about 10 times more of each resource.[309] Using ex-Romanian drilling rigs, several oil exploration companies have confirmed significant oil reserves in the North Korean shelf of the Sea of Japan, and in areas south of Pyongyang.[310] The agricultural sector was shattered by the natural disasters of the 1990s.[311] Its 3,500 cooperatives and state farms[312] were moderately successful until the mid-1990s[313] but now experience chronic fertilizer and equipment shortages. Rice, corn, soybeans and potatoes are some of the primary crops.[288] A significant contribution to the food supply comes from commercial fishing and aquaculture.[288] Smaller specialized farms, managed by the state, also produce high-value crops, including ginseng, honey, matsutake and herbs for traditional Korean and Chinese medicine.[314] Tourism has been a growing sector for the past decade.[315] North Korea has been aiming to increase the number of foreign visitors through projects like the Masikryong Ski Resort.[316] On 22 January 2020, North Korea closed its borders to foreign tourists in response to the threat of the COVID-19 pandemic in North Korea.[317] Foreign trade surpassed pre-crisis levels in 2005 and continues to expand.[318][319] North Korea has a number of special economic zones (SEZs) and Special Administrative Regions where foreign companies can operate with tax and tariff incentives while North Korean establishments gain access to improved technology.[320] Initially four such zones existed, but they yielded little overall success.[321] The SEZ system was overhauled in 2013 when 14 new zones were opened and the Rason Special Economic Zone was reformed as a joint Chinese-North Korean project.[322] The Kaesong Industrial Region is a special economic zone where more than 100 South Korean companies employ some 52,000 North Korean workers.[323] As of August 2017[update], China is the biggest trading partner of North Korea outside inter-Korean trade, accounting for more than 84% of the total external trade ($5.3 billion) followed by India at 3.3% share ($205 million).[324] In 2014, Russia wrote off 90% of North Korea's debt and the two countries agreed to conduct all transactions in rubles.[325] Overall, external trade in 2013 reached a total of $7.3 billion (the highest amount since 1990[326]), while inter-Korean trade dropped to an eight-year low of $1.1 billion.[327] Transport infrastructure in North Korea includes railways, highways, water and air routes, but rail transport is by far the most widespread. North Korea has some 5,200 kilometers (3,200 mi) of railways mostly in standard gauge which carry 80% of annual passenger traffic and 86% of freight, but electricity shortages undermine their efficiency.[328] Construction of a high-speed railway connecting Kaesong, Pyongyang and Sinuiju with speeds exceeding 200 kilometers per hour (120 mph) was approved in 2013.[329][needs update] North Korea connects with the Trans-Siberian Railway through Rajin. Road transport is very limited—only 724 kilometers (450 mi) of the 25,554 kilometers (15,879 mi) road network are paved,[330] and maintenance on most roads is poor.[331] Only 2% of the freight capacity is supported by river and sea transport, and air traffic is negligible.[328] All port facilities are ice-free and host a merchant fleet of 158 vessels.[332] Eighty-two airports[333] and 23 helipads[334] are operational and the largest serve the state-run airline, Air Koryo.[328] Cars are relatively rare,[335] but bicycles are common.[336][337] There is only one international airport—Pyongyang International Airport—serviced by Russia and China (see List of public airports in North Korea) North Korea's energy infrastructure is obsolete and in disrepair. Power shortages are chronic and would not be alleviated even by electricity imports because the poorly maintained grid causes significant losses during transmission.[339][340] Coal accounts for 70% of primary energy production, followed by hydroelectric power with 17%.[328] The government under Kim Jong Un has increased emphasis on renewable energy projects like wind farms, solar parks, solar heating and biomass.[341] A set of legal regulations adopted in 2014 stressed the development of geothermal, wind and solar energy along with recycling and environmental conservation.[341][342] North Korea's long-term objective is to curb fossil fuel usage and reach an output of 5 million kilowatts from renewable sources by 2044, up from its current total of 430,000 kilowatts from all sources. Wind power is projected to satisfy 15% of the country's total energy demand under this strategy.[343] North Korea also strives to develop its own civilian nuclear program. These efforts are under much international dispute due to their military applications and concerns about safety.[344] R&D efforts are concentrated at the State Academy of Sciences, which runs 40 research institutes, 200 smaller research centers, a scientific equipment factory and six publishing houses.[345] The government considers science and technology to be directly linked to economic development.[346][347] A five-year scientific plan emphasizing IT, biotechnology, nanotechnology, marine technology, and laser and plasma research was carried out in the early 2000s.[346] A 2010 report by the South Korean Science and Technology Policy Institute identified polymer chemistry, single carbon materials, nanoscience, mathematics, software, nuclear technology and rocketry as potential areas of inter-Korean scientific cooperation. North Korean institutes are strong in these fields of research, although their engineers require additional training, and laboratories need equipment upgrades.[348] Under its \"constructing a powerful knowledge economy\" slogan, the state has launched a project to concentrate education, scientific research and production into a number of \"high-tech development zones\". International sanctions remain a significant obstacle to their development.[349] The Miraewon network of electronic libraries was established in 2014 under similar slogans.[350] Significant resources have been allocated to the national space program, which is managed by the National Aerospace Technology Administration (formerly managed by the Korean Committee of Space Technology until April 2013).[351][352] Domestically produced launch vehicles and the Kwangmyŏngsŏng satellite class are launched from two spaceports, the Tonghae Satellite Launching Ground and the Sohae Satellite Launching Station. After four failed attempts, North Korea became the tenth spacefaring nation with the launch of Kwangmyŏngsŏng-3 Unit 2 in December 2012, which successfully reached orbit but was believed to be crippled and non-operational.[353][354] It joined the Outer Space Treaty in 2009[355] and has stated its intentions to undertake crewed and Moon missions.[352] The government insisted the space program is for peaceful purposes, but the United States, Japan, South Korea and other countries maintained that it serves to advance North Korea's ballistic missile program.[356] On 7 February 2016, a statement broadcast on Korean Central Television said that a new Earth observation satellite, Kwangmyongsong-4, had successfully been put into orbit.[357] Usage of communication technology is controlled by the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications. An adequate nationwide fiber-optic telephone system with 1.18 million fixed lines[358] and expanding mobile coverage is in place.[9] Most phones are installed for senior government officials and installation requires written explanation why the user needs a telephone and how it will be paid for.[359] Cellular coverage is available with a 3G network operated by Koryolink, a joint venture with Orascom Telecom Holding.[360] The number of subscribers has increased from 3,000 in 2002[361] to almost two million in 2013.[360] International calls through either fixed or cellular service are restricted, and mobile Internet is not available.[360] Internet access itself is limited to a handful of elite users and scientists. Instead, North Korea has a walled garden intranet system called Kwangmyong,[362] which is maintained and monitored by the Korea Computer Center.[363] Its content is limited to state media, chat services, message boards,[362] an e-mail service and an estimated 1,000–5,500 websites.[364] Computers employ the Red Star OS, an operating system derived from Linux, with a user shell visually similar to that of OS X.[364] On 19 September 2016, a TLDR project noticed the North Korean Internet DNS data and top-level domain was left open which allowed global DNS zone transfers. A dump of the data discovered was shared on GitHub.[10][365] North Korea's population was 10.9 million in 1961.[366] With the exception of a small Chinese community and a few ethnic Japanese, North Korea's 25,971,909[367][368] people are ethnically homogeneous.[369] Demographic experts in the 20th century estimated that the population would grow to 25.5 million by 2000 and 28 million by 2010, but this increase never occurred due to the North Korean famine.[370] The famine began in 1995, lasted for three years, and resulted in the deaths of between 240,000 and 420,000 North Koreans.[66] International donors led by the United States initiated shipments of food through the World Food Program in 1997 to combat the famine.[371] Despite a drastic reduction of aid under the George W. Bush administration,[372] the situation gradually improved: the number of malnourished children declined from 60% in 1998[373] to 37% in 2006[374] and 28% in 2013.[375] Domestic food production almost recovered to the recommended annual level of 5.37 million tons of cereal equivalent in 2013,[376] but the World Food Program reported a continuing lack of dietary diversity and access to fats and proteins.[377] By the mid-2010s national levels of severe wasting, an indication of famine-like conditions, were lower than in other low-income countries and about on par with developing nations in the Pacific and East Asia. Children's health and nutrition is significantly better on a number of indicators than in many other Asian countries.[378] The famine had a significant impact on the population growth rate, which declined to 0.9% annually in 2002.[370] It was 0.5% in 2014.[379] Late marriages after military service, limited housing space and long hours of work or political studies further exhaust the population and reduce growth.[370] The national birth rate is 14.5 births per year per 1,000 population.[380] Two-thirds of households consist of extended families mostly living in two-room units. Marriage is virtually universal and divorce is extremely rare.[381] North Korea shares the Korean language with South Korea, although some dialectal differences exist within both Koreas.[373] North Koreans refer to their Pyongan dialect as munhwaŏ (\"cultured language\") as opposed to the dialects of South Korea, especially the Seoul dialect or p'yojun'ŏ (\"standard language\"), which are viewed as decadent because of its use of loanwords from Chinese and European languages (particularly English).[382][383] Words of Chinese, Manchu or Western origin have been eliminated from munhwa along with the usage of Chinese hancha characters.[382] Written language uses only the Chosŏn'gŭl (Hangul) phonetic alphabet, developed under Sejong the Great (1418–1450).[384][385] North Korea is officially an atheist state.[386][387] Its constitution guarantees freedom of religion under Article 68, but this principle is limited by the requirement that religion may not be used as a pretext to harm the state, introduce foreign forces, or harm the existing social order.[98][388] Religious practice is therefore restricted,[389][390] despite nominal constitutional protections.[391] Proselytizing is also prohibited due to concerns about foreign influence. The number of Christian churchgoers nonetheless more than doubled between the 1980s and the early 2000s due to the recruitment of Christians who previously worshipped privately or in small house churches.[392] The Open Doors mission, a Protestant group based in the United States and founded during the Cold War era, claims the most severe persecution of Christians in the world occurs in North Korea.[393] There are no known official statistics of religions in North Korea. According to a 2020 study published by the Centre for the Study of World Christianity, 73% of the population are irreligious (58% agnostic, 15% atheist), 13% practice Chondoism, 12% practice Korean shamanism, 1.5% are Buddhist, and less than 0.5% practice another religion such as Christianity, Islam, or Chinese folk religion.[394] Amnesty International has expressed concerns about religious persecution in North Korea.[255] Pro-North groups such as the Paektu Solidarity Alliance deny these claims, saying that multiple religious facilities exist across the nation.[395] Some religious places of worship are located in foreign embassies in the capital city of Pyongyang.[396] Five Christian churches built with state funds stand in Pyongyang: three Protestant, one Roman Catholic, and one Russian Orthodox.[392] Critics claim these are showcases for foreigners.[397][398] Buddhism and Confucianism still influence spirituality.[399] Chondoism (\"Heavenly Way\") is an indigenous syncretic belief combining elements of Korean shamanism, Buddhism, Taoism and Catholicism that is officially represented by the WPK-controlled Chondoist Chongu Party.[400] Chondoism is recognized and favored by the government, being seen as an indigenous form of \"revolutionary religion\".[388] The 2008 census listed the entire population as literate.[381] An 11-year free, compulsory cycle of primary and secondary education is provided in more than 27,000 nursery schools, 14,000 kindergartens, 4,800 four-year primary and 4,700 six-year secondary schools.[373] 77% of males and 79% of females aged 30–34 have finished secondary school.[381] An additional 300 universities and colleges offer higher education.[373] Most graduates from the compulsory program do not attend university but begin their obligatory military service or proceed to work in farms or factories instead. The main deficiencies of higher education are the heavy presence of ideological subjects, which comprise 50% of courses in social studies and 20% in sciences,[401] and the imbalances in curriculum. The study of natural sciences is greatly emphasized while social sciences are neglected.[402] Heuristics is actively applied to develop the independence and creativity of students throughout the system.[403] The study of Russian and English was made compulsory in upper middle schools in 1978.[404] North Korea has a life expectancy of 72.3 years in 2019, according to HDR 2020.[405] While North Korea is classified as a low-income country, the structure of North Korea's causes of death (2013) is unlike that of other low-income countries.[406] Instead, it is closer to worldwide averages, with non-communicable diseases—such as cardiovascular disease and cancers—accounting for 84 percent of the total deaths in 2016.[407] According to the World Bank report of 2016 (based on WHO's estimate), only 9.5% of the total deaths recorded in North Korea are attributed to communicable diseases and maternal, prenatal and nutrition conditions, a figure which is slightly lower than that of South Korea (10.1%) and one fifth of other low-income countries (50.1%) but higher than that of high income countries (6.7%).[408] Only one out of ten leading causes of overall deaths in North Korea is attributed to communicable diseases (lower respiratory infection), a disease which is reported to have declined by six percent since 2007.[409] In 2013, cardiovascular disease as a single disease group was reported as the largest cause of death in North Korea.[406] The three major causes of death in North Korea are stroke, COPD and ischaemic heart disease.[409] Non-communicable diseases risk factors in North Korea include high rates of urbanization, an aging society, and high rates of smoking and alcohol consumption amongst men.[406] Maternal mortality is lower than other low-income countries, but significantly higher than South Korea and other high income countries, at 89 per 100,000 live births.[410] In 2008 child mortality was estimated to be 45 per 1,000, which is much better than other economically comparable countries. Chad for example had a child mortality rate of 120 per 1,000, despite the fact that Chad was most likely wealthier than North Korea at the time.[58] Healthcare Access and Quality Index, as calculated by IHME, was reported to stand at 62.3, much lower than that of South Korea.[411] According to a 2003 report by the United States Department of State, almost 100% of the population has access to water and sanitation.[412] Further, 80% of the population had access to improved sanitation facilities in 2015.[413] North Korea has the highest number of doctors per capita amongst low-income countries, with 3.7 physicians per 1,000 people, a figure which is also significantly higher than that of South Korea, according to WHO's data.[414] Conflicting reports between Amnesty and WHO have emerged, where the Amnesty report claimed that North Korea had an inadequate health care system, while the Director of the World Health Organization claimed that North Korea's healthcare system was considered the envy of the developing world and had \"no lack of doctors and nurses\".[415] A free universal insurance system is in place.[298] Quality of medical care varies significantly by region[416] and is often low, with severe shortages of equipment, drugs and anesthetics.[303] According to WHO, expenditure on health per capita is one of the lowest in the world.[303] Preventive medicine is emphasized through physical exercise and sports, nationwide monthly checkups and routine spraying of public places against disease. Every individual has a lifetime health card which contains a full medical record.[417] According to North Korean documents and refugee testimonies,[418] all North Koreans are sorted into groups according to their Songbun, an ascribed status system based on a citizen's assessed loyalty to the government. Based on their own behavior and the political, social, and economic background of their family for three generations as well as behavior by relatives within that range, Songbun is allegedly used to determine whether an individual is trusted with responsibility or given certain opportunities.[419] Songbun allegedly affects access to educational and employment opportunities and particularly whether a person is eligible to join North Korea's ruling party.[419] There are 3 main classifications and about 50 sub-classifications. According to Kim Il Sung, speaking in 1958, the loyal \"core class\" constituted 25% of the North Korean population, the \"wavering class\" 55%, and the \"hostile class\" 20%.[418] The highest status is accorded to individuals descended from those who participated with Kim Il Sung in the resistance against Japanese occupation before and during World War II and to those who were factory workers, laborers, or peasants in 1950.[420] While some analysts believe private commerce recently changed the Songbun system to some extent,[421] most North Korean refugees say it remains a commanding presence in everyday life.[418] The North Korean government claims all citizens are equal and denies any discrimination on the basis of family background.[422] Despite a historically strong Chinese influence, Korean culture has shaped its own unique identity.[423] It came under attack during the Japanese rule from 1910 to 1945, when Japan enforced a cultural assimilation policy. Koreans were forced to learn and speak Japanese, adopt the Japanese family name system and Shinto religion, and were forbidden to write or speak the Korean language in schools, businesses, or public places.[424] After the peninsula was divided in 1945, two distinct cultures formed out of the common Korean heritage. North Koreans have little exposure to foreign influence.[425] The revolutionary struggle and the brilliance of the leadership are some of the main themes in art. \"Reactionary\" elements from traditional culture have been discarded and cultural forms with a \"folk\" spirit have been reintroduced.[425] Korean heritage is protected and maintained by the state.[426] Over 190 historical sites and objects of national significance are cataloged as National Treasures of North Korea, while some 1,800 less valuable artifacts are included in a list of Cultural Assets. The Historic Monuments and Sites in Kaesong and the Complex of Koguryo Tombs are UNESCO World Heritage Sites.[427] The Goguryeo tombs are registered on UNESCO's list of World Heritage Sites. These remains were registered as the first World Heritage property of North Korea in the UNESCO World Heritage Committee (WHC) in July 2004. There are 63 burial mounds on the site, with clear murals preserved. The burial customs of the Goguryeo culture have influenced Asian civilizations beyond Korea, including Japan.[428] Visual arts are generally produced in the aesthetic of socialist realism.[429] North Korean painting combines the influence of Soviet and Japanese visual expression to instill a sentimental loyalty to the system.[430] All artists in North Korea are required to join the Artists' Union, and the best among them can receive an official license to portray the leaders. Portraits and sculptures depicting Kim Il Sung, Kim Jong Il and Kim Jong Un are classed as \"Number One works\".[429] Most aspects of art have been dominated by Mansudae Art Studio since its establishment in 1959. It employs around 1,000 artists in what is likely the biggest art factory in the world where paintings, murals, posters and monuments are designed and produced.[431] The studio has commercialized its activity and sells its works to collectors in a variety of countries including China, where it is in high demand.[430] Mansudae Overseas Projects is a subdivision of Mansudae Art Studio that carries out construction of large-scale monuments for international customers.[431] Some of the projects include the African Renaissance Monument in Senegal,[432] and the Heroes' Acre in Namibia.[433] All publishing houses are owned by the government or the WPK because they are considered an important tool for agitprop.[434] The Workers' Party of Korea Publishing House is the most authoritative among them and publishes all works of Kim Il Sung, ideological education materials and party policy documents.[435] The availability of foreign literature is limited, examples being North Korean editions of Indian, German, Chinese and Russian fairy tales, Tales from Shakespeare, some works of Bertolt Brecht and Erich Kästner,[430] and the Harry Potter series.[436] Kim Il Sung's personal works are considered \"classical masterpieces\" while the ones created under his instruction are labeled \"models of Juche literature\". These include The Fate of a Self-Defense Corps Man, The Song of Korea and Immortal History, a series of historical novels depicting the suffering of Koreans under Japanese occupation.[425][437] More than four million literary works were published between the 1980s and the early 2000s, but almost all of them belong to a narrow variety of political genres like \"army-first revolutionary literature\".[438] Science fiction is considered a secondary genre because it somewhat departs from the traditional standards of detailed descriptions and metaphors of the leader. The exotic settings of the stories give authors more freedom to depict cyberwarfare, violence, sexual abuse, and crime, which are absent in other genres. Sci-fi works glorify technology and promote the Juche concept of anthropocentric existence through depictions of robotics, space exploration, and immortality.[439] The government emphasized optimistic folk-based tunes and revolutionary music throughout most of the 20th century.[425] Ideological messages are conveyed through massive orchestral pieces like the \"Five Great Revolutionary Operas\" based on traditional Korean ch'angguk.[437] Revolutionary operas differ from their Western counterparts by adding traditional instruments to the orchestra and avoiding recitative segments.[440] Sea of Blood is the most widely performed of the Five Great Operas: since its premiere in 1971, it has been played over 1,500 times,[441] and its 2010 tour in China was a major success.[440] Western classical music by Brahms, Tchaikovsky, Stravinsky and other composers is performed both by the State Symphony Orchestra and student orchestras.[442] Pop music appeared in the 1980s with the Pochonbo Electronic Ensemble and Wangjaesan Light Music Band.[443] Improved relations with South Korea following the 2000 inter-Korean summit caused a decline in direct ideological messages in pop songs, but themes like comradeship, nostalgia and the construction of a powerful country remained.[444] In 2014, the all-girl Moranbong Band was described as the most popular group in the country.[445] North Koreans also listen to K-pop which spreads through illegal markets.[446][447] Government policies towards film are no different from those applied to other arts—motion pictures serve to fulfill the targets of \"social education\". Some of the most influential films are based on historic events (An Jung-geun shoots Itō Hirobumi) or folk tales (Hong Gildong).[437] Most movies have predictable propaganda story lines which make cinema an unpopular entertainment; viewers only see films that feature their favorite actors.[448] Western productions are only available at private showings to high-ranking Party members,[449] although the 1997 film Titanic is frequently shown to university students as an example of Western culture.[450] Access to foreign media products is available through smuggled DVDs and television or radio broadcasts in border areas.[451] Western films like The Interview, Charlie's Angels, and the aforementioned Titanic are just a few films that have been smuggled across the borders of North Korea, allowing for access to the North Korean citizens.[452][453] North Korean media are under some of the strictest government control in the world. The censorship in North Korea encompasses all the information produced by the media. Monitored heavily by government officials, the media is strictly used to reinforce ideals approved by the government.[454] There is no freedom of press in North Korea as all the media is controlled and filtered through governmental censors.[454] Freedom of the press in 2017 was 180th out of 180 countries in Reporters Without Borders' annual Press Freedom Index.[455] According to Freedom House, all media outlets serve as government mouthpieces, all journalists are party members and listening to foreign broadcasts carries the threat of the death penalty.[456] The main news provider is the Korean Central News Agency. All 12 major newspapers and 20 periodicals, including Rodong Sinmun, are published in the capital.[457] There are three state-owned TV stations. Two of them broadcast only on weekends and the Korean Central Television is on air every day in the evenings.[458] Uriminzokkiri and its associated YouTube and Twitter accounts distribute imagery, news and video issued by government media.[459] The Associated Press opened the first Western all-format, full-time bureau in Pyongyang in 2012.[460] Media coverage of North Korea has often been inadequate as a result of the country's isolation. Stories like Kim Jong Un executing his ex-girlfriend or feeding his uncle to a pack of hungry dogs have been circulated by foreign media as truth despite the lack of a credible source.[461] Many of the claims originate from the South Korean right-wing newspaper The Chosun Ilbo.[462] Max Fisher of The Washington Post has written that \"almost any story [on North Korea] is treated as broadly credible, no matter how outlandish or thinly sourced\".[463] Occasional deliberate disinformation on the part of North Korean establishments further complicates the issue.[461] Korean cuisine has evolved through centuries of social and political change. Originating from ancient agricultural and nomadic traditions in southern Manchuria and the Korean Peninsula, it has gone through a complex interaction of the natural environment and different cultural trends.[464] Rice dishes and kimchi are staple Korean food. In a traditional meal, they accompany both side dishes (panch'an) and main courses like juk, pulgogi or noodles. Soju liquor is the best-known traditional Korean spirit.[465] North Korea's most famous restaurant, Okryu-gwan, located in Pyongyang, is known for its raengmyeon cold noodles.[466] Other dishes served there include gray mullet soup with boiled rice, beef rib soup, green bean pancake, sinsollo and dishes made from terrapin.[467][468] Okryu-gwan sends research teams into the countryside to collect data on Korean cuisine and introduce new recipes.[466] Some Asian cities host branches of the Pyongyang restaurant chain where waitresses perform music and dance.[469] Most schools have daily practice in association football, basketball, table tennis, gymnastics, boxing and others. The DPR Korea League is popular inside the country and its games are often televised.[448] The national football team, Chollima, competed in the FIFA World Cup in 2010, when it lost all three matches against Brazil, Portugal and Ivory Coast.[470] Its 1966 appearance was much more successful, seeing a surprise 1–0 victory over Italy and a quarter final loss to Portugal by 3–5.[471] A national team represents the nation in international basketball competitions as well. In December 2013, former American basketball professional Dennis Rodman visited North Korea to help train the national team after he developed a friendship with Kim Jong Un.[472] North Korea's first appearance in the Olympics came in 1964. The 1972 Olympics saw its summer games debut and five medals, including one gold. With the exception of the boycotted Los Angeles and Seoul Olympics, North Korean athletes have won medals in all summer games since then.[473] Weightlifter Kim Un-guk broke the world record of the Men's 62 kg category at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London.[474] Successful Olympians receive luxury apartments from the state in recognition for their achievements.[475] The Arirang Mass Games has been recognized by the Guinness World Records as the biggest choreographic event in the world.[476] Some 100,000 athletes perform rhythmic gymnastics and dances while another 40,000 participants create a vast animated screen in the background. The event is an artistic representation of the country's history and pays homage to Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il.[476][477] Rungrado 1st of May Stadium, the largest stadium in the world with its capacity of 150,000, hosts the Festival.[477][478] The Pyongyang Marathon is another notable sports event. It is an IAAF Bronze Label Race where amateur runners from around the world can participate.[479] 40°N 127°E﻿ / ﻿40°N 127°E﻿ / 40; 127",

In 2011 Kim Jong-Un was named as the new \"Supreme Leader of the party, state and army\"[9] North Korea (officially called the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)) is a country in the northern part of the Korean peninsula. North Korea is next to China, Russia, and South Korea. The capital city of North Korea is Pyŏngyang, which is also the largest city. The country was founded in 1948 after it had been freed from Japanese occupation, and a socialist state backed by the Soviet Union was established. The Republic of Korea is the southern half of the Korean Peninsula, and was occupied by the United States, and the U.S. set up a democracy in the south. At first, there was a war between the north and south which is called the Korean War, but while the fighting stopped in 1953, the war never officially ended. North Korea had ties with China and Russia but never was formally allied with either and became more isolated over time. Soon afterwards, the North's main trading partners the Soviet Union, collapsed. This left North Korea stranded and isolated. Throughout the 1990s, North Korea suffered from famines and natural disasters. As South Korea got richer, North Korea got poorer and life became worse there. Afterwards, things stabilized but continued to lag behind the South. Worldwide economic sanctions and embargoes are thought to have significantly impacted the quality of life in North Korea. North Korea is described as a totalitarian Stalinist dictatorship by western media, while North Korea describes itself as a democratic worker's state.[source?] The country's leader Kim Il-sung said that the government was following his own ideology of \"Juche\", which means \"self-reliance\". Later on, the country's leaders began to remove \"communism\" from North Korean laws and philosophy, although Juche can be described as a variant of communism. After Kim Il-sung died during the disasters of the 1990s, his son Kim Jong-il took his place and was promoted by the government as the leader who led North Korea out of the disasters. North Korea was the only communist country in history where leadership was directly given to the former leader's son after his death. This is called hereditary rule. Kim Jong-il enacted a new policy of \"Songun\", or \"military-first\", which turned the country into a military state. When he died in 2011, his youngest son Kim Jong-un took his place and continues to rule the country today. Historians believe that the Korean people have lived in the area for thousands of years. Before 1910, Korea was one country. It had a king and people were mostly farmers. The country was peaceful and was not communist. In 1910, that changed. Japan and Russia went to war. Since Japan and Russia were both very close to Korea, Japan took Korea for themselves as part of Japan. Japan then had control. Between 1910 and the end of World War II in 1945, Korea was considered a part of Japan due to Japan's colonization of Korea. In 1945, the USSR declared war on Japan and the United States bombed it (Nagasaki and Hiroshima); severely weakening its empire and forcing Japan to surrender. Japan's weak status allowed the Soviets to enter Korea fairly, freely and occupy the northern half whilst the United States took the southern half. The line that splits North Korea and South Korea is called the 38th parallel. Each created governments supporting their own ideologies, Marxist–Leninist Single Party State (North) and Democratic Capitalist State (South).[source?] In 1950, North Korea sent soldiers to South Korea. North Korea wanted to bring together North and South Korea to form a single Korean country, and Korean families that had been split by the division of North and South to be together again. The North Korean leaders wanted South Korea to be communist, like North Korea and the Soviet Union were. The United Nations sent soldiers to Korea. These soldiers came from many countries. These countries did not like Communism (to learn more, see the article about the Cold War). If South Korea became Communist, then maybe other countries would too. General Douglas MacArthur led the soldiers. North Korea had taken over much of South Korea by force. With the help of the other countries, South Korea took back their land, and even much of North Korea, up to the Yalu River, which forms the border between North Korea and China. China, which was also communist, helped the North Koreans to get the land back that the South Korean soldiers had taken. After three years, in 1953, North Korea and South Korea both decided that no one would win the war and both countries signed an armistice, which is an agreement that made both countries stop fighting. North Korea and South Korea were divided by a demilitarized zone, or DMZ, which is a special place that surrounds the border between North and South Korea where both countries can not place lots of soldiers, so that fighting does not start again. Even though the Korean Demilitarized Zone is meant to stop problems between the two countries, sometimes soldiers on both sides of the border fire their guns at each other. A special town in the zone, Panmunjom, is called the Joint Security Area, or JSA, and sometimes the leaders of both countries meet there to talk about possibly coming back together. North Korea is one of the few countries in the world that has made nuclear missiles, which can kill many people if they are exploded. North Korea will not say how many nukes it has, but other countries think that the North Korean government probably has built ten missiles so far out of a deadly element called plutonium. In October 2006, North Korea said that it tested one of its nuclear bombs. Although the North Korean government said that the test was not dangerous, many other countries and the United Nations were nonetheless enraged. Three years later in 2009, North Korea did another test, which broke a United Nations law called Resolution 1718, which said North Korea could not keep building and testing nuclear bombs. In 2010, a South Korean warship sank, killing over 40 soldiers. An international investigation concluded that North Korea had sunk a South Korean warship with a torpedo. North Korea strongly said that it did not have anything to do with the sinking. When the United States and South Korea planned to set up defenses in case North Korea tried to attack again, North Korea's National Defense Commission threatened on to start a war with its nuclear weapons. In April 2012, North Korea launched a rocket called Bright Star 3. The reasons for the launch were science and the 100th anniversary of the birth of the country's founder, Kim Il-Sung. The government said the rocket carried a weather satellite so the government could find out what the weather would be. However, other countries said that the weather satellite was a story made up by the government so the real purpose of the rocket would not the known—which most countries thought was to test a nuclear missile that could be launched at the United States or South Korea. South Korean leaders said it would shoot the rocket down when it came over South Korea. Because of this rocket, other countries stopped helping North Korea, even though the government invited other countries to see the rocket launch to make it seem like the North Koreans had nothing to hide from other countries. The rocket was eventually launched, but it did not work and crashed just a minute and thirty seconds after it was launched. In December 2012, the government tried to launch the rocket again. It worked this time and went into orbit circling the Earth, though the United States said that it was very unstable and might fall back to Earth. Experts in Europe noticed the satellite's reflection was fluctuating (getting brighter then dimmer); indicating that the satellite is tumbling in its orbit. In February 2013, North Korea tested a nuclear bomb for the 3rd time, causing much outrage from other countries. The government also released many videos that depicted possible missile targets in the United States. North Korea however does not posses missiles that could reach US mainland but some say Hawaii is a possibility. It is highly unlikely that North Korea would ever fire against the US, Japan or South Korea. Many missiles depicted in DPRK parades are fakes used to exaggerate North Korea's military strength.[source?] Most of its inventory dates from the Soviet years. People often think that North Korea is a communist country. It is actually a socialist-military dictatorship. In its most recent constitutional change, the word 'communism' was removed. Large pictures of Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin were removed from Kim Il-Sung square in 2012. The government has a similar structure to the former Soviet Union (USSR), once a close ally, but it is very different from the USSR. Leaders of the USSR were elected by a group of government officials. In North Korea, the new leader is the current leader's male heir. For this reason, North Korea is often referred to as a hereditary dictatorship. North Korea's official state ideology is Juche. That is a form of socialism developed by the country's founder, Kim Il-Sung. Juche means self-reliance. It teaches that to achieve true socialism and become self-sufficient, the state must become fully isolated from the rest of society. The first head of state and Chairman of the Workers Party of North Korea was Kim Tu-bong.[11] In the late 1950s, the second head of state and party leader was Kim Il-Sung. In July 1994, Kim died. His son, Kim Jŏng-Il, took over. He became the third supreme leader and party general secretary. In December 2011, Kim died. His son, Kim Jŏng-Un became the head of the government. Songun is a North Korean idea. It means \"army first.\" The job of every North Korean person is to feed the Army. Kim Jŏng-Un is the \"General Secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea\". That is one of many jobs he has. He is like a king, and can do what he wants. The average North Korean citizen makes around $900 a year. Kim Jŏng-Un makes around $800,000 a year.[source?] He lives in a palace. He has lots of soldiers who go wherever he goes to protect him. North Korea is technically a multi-party state since other parties do exist besides the Korean Workers' Party (KWP). However, the KWP also controls the other parties so it can stay in power. The constitution claims that North Korea's citizens have freedom of speech, religion and press. In real life, these citizens do not have these rights. People can be jailed if they criticise the party, government, or leaders. North Koreans are encouraged to report family members to the police if they think they are doing something illegal. In return they get more privileges. If someone is caught doing a crime, their whole family will be sent along with them to a labour camp. Most die there, but a few escape. North Korean people have very little freedom of speech. They get their news from the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA). The KCNA makes sure all the country's television, radio, and newspaper news makes the government look good. This is called propaganda. The government blocks access to the Internet. Only a few trusted military officials and party members can access the world Internet. It has been reported that almost all North Koreans do not know that men have landed on the moon. The government runs an intranet service that is available on all North Korean computers. It is nothing like the real Internet but is filled with propaganda that makes the government, party, and leaders look good. The government also tries to keep ideas from other countries out of North Korea. Capital punishment is a common type of punishment in North Korea. Stealing, murder, rape, drug smuggling, attempted murder, spying, slaughtering cattle for food, trying to challenge the laws of North Korea, traveling without permission, looking at media unapproved by North Korea (which includes South Korean dramas, pornography, and Western movies), possessing a USB drive, and practicing religions that are against worshipping Kim Jong-un and his family can all result in the death penalty. In parts of the country, there is not enough food. Currently, other countries give food to some people in North Korea. This is called foreign aid. The aid sometimes stops coming if North Korea is thought to be testing nuclear bombs. Very recently, North Korea's food aid stopped after the government launched a satellite in April 2012. Other countries said North Korea had broken their side of an agreement. The North Korean government said that it was the United States that had broken the agreement. It is hard for people from other countries to visit North Korea. Visitors must be guided by two army members called \"minders\". The minders try and make sure the people do not find out about anything that might make the government look bad. North Korea is one of the poorest countries in the world. This is due to the government not wanting to allow North Koreans to earn their own money outside of their government-given jobs, to allow people to work the jobs they want, and to trade with other countries. Although Pyongyang (which is the one of the few areas foreign travelers are allowed to visit) makes the country look like it is richer and more prosperous than it truly is, life looks extremely different throughout the rest of the country. Only the highest-ranking North Koreans are allowed to live in Pyongyang, and they must have permission from the government to do so. Unlike the rest of the country, people often own cars and bicycles, there is a subway system, and power exists throughout the city. Meanwhile, very few people in the countryside own a car, or even a bicycle, and animal-drawn carts are very common. Electricity in rural areas is rare, if it even exists at all. Proof(?) of this is that when seen from space, there are almost no lights that can be seen outside of Pyongyang. Even in Pyongyang, power cuts are common. As said earlier, starvation is very common way to die throughout the country. The soil in most of the country is not good enough to grow enough crops to feed people without any kind of fertilizer. As a result, people often steal human poop to fertilize the soil. People also go out into nature to look for anything to eat such as grass, bark, frogs, worms, etc. Since the government does not provide the average North Korean person enough resources to survive, most North Koreans get what they need from the black market. Even though buying and selling on the black market is illegal, people are able to avoid punishment by bribing officials. They might give things such as money, gifts, or sexual favors. Most people buying and selling at the black market are women. This is because all adult men are required by law to go to work during workhours, even when their workplace cannot or will not pay them for their work. Since electricity is rare throughout North Korea, tasks such as cooking and washing clothes take much longer and are more tiring. People often wash clothes in a river or creek and must start fires before they can cook. Although healthcare is free in North Korea, most hospitals and doctor's offices do not have the medicines or supplies needed to correctly treat patients. As a result, many patients die or become crippled for the rest of their lives in the hospital. On one occasion, North Korea hired an eye surgeon from Nepal to because there was not a single eye surgeon in the country. In order to raise money for the country, the government sometimes sends North Korean citizens to its allies, like China and Russia, to do work there. These jobs include food service in North Korean restaurants and logging. Even outside of North Korea, these North Koreans are often not allowed to interact with the local people outside of work, are forced to live in North Korean communities, and must obey North Korean laws. Other ways North Korea makes money is through selling illegal drugs to other countries, making fake money of other countries, and stealing money online. Historically, both South Korea and North Korea have had the same set of values. In 1945, the peninsula was divided. Since then, the government of both North and South Korea were different. This has led to different developments in both North and South Korea. Human Rights Watch says that free religious activities do not exist in North Korea. The culture in Korea has been influenced by that of China. Despite this, Korea has developed a cultural identity that is different from that of Mainland China.[12] Literature and arts in North Korea are state-controlled. Specialized committees of the KWP are responsible for this.[13] Film is also a significant artistic medium in North Korea and Kim Jong Il's manifesto The Cinema and Directing (1987) is the basis for the nation's filmmakers.[14] Korean culture came under attack during the Japanese rule from 1910 to 1945. Japan enforced a cultural assimilation policy. During the Japanese rule, Koreans were forced to learn and speak Japanese, adopt the Japanese family name system and Shinto religion, and were forbidden to write or speak the Korean language in schools, businesses, or public places.[15] In addition, the Japanese altered or destroyed various Korean monuments including Gyeongbok Palace and documents which portrayed the Japanese in a negative light were revised. Both Koreas share a Buddhist and Confucian heritage and a recent history of Christian and Cheondoism (\"religion of the Heavenly Way\") movements. The North Korean constitution states that freedom of religion is permitted.[16] According to the Western standards of religion, the majority of the North Korean population could be characterized as non-religious.[source?] However, the cultural influence of such traditional religions as Buddhism and Confucianism still have an effect on North Korean spiritual life.[17][18][19] It seems that Buddhists are accepted more than other religious groups. Christians are said to be severely persecuted by the authorities, often by throwing them in prison or executing them publicly. Buddhists are given limited funding by the government to promote the religion, because Buddhism played an integral role in traditional Korean culture.[20] In May 2014, an American tourist was arrested at Pyongyang Sunan Airport after it was discovered he left a Bible in a nightclub on the DPRK's east coast. He was convicted of attempting to overthrow the government but was eventually released several months later. At the time of his imprisonment, there were two other American citizens held by North Korea awaiting transfer to political prison camps. Both have since been released. Even though the country has fewer than 25 million people, the country still has the world's fourth largest standing military, at 1.29 million soldiers.[21] This is because North Korea has a law that requires all men to join the military for at least ten years after they graduate high school. The government says it keeps a large military to protect the country from its enemies, particularly the United States and Japan. However, it is more likely that it exists to keep the government in power and to stop people from speaking out against it. The land of North Korea is divided into nine areas called provinces and two cities. The nine provinces are: The main cities are:",

                "content": "Our editors will review what you’ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article. North Korea has a generally cool continental climate. The winter season is from December to March; mean temperatures range between 20 °F (−7 °C) in the south and −10 °F (−23 °C) in the north. The summer is warm from June to September, with mean July temperatures in the upper 60s F (about 20 °C). North Korea has a command economy. The state controls all means of production, and the government sets priorities and goals in economic development. The North Korean population, which has been largely isolated since 1945, is almost entirely Korean, with a small number of Chinese constituting the only other significant ethnic group. On October 9, 2006, North Korea conducted its first underground nuclear test, detonating a device with an estimated yield of one kiloton. The test was carried out in Kilju, North Hamgyŏng province, North Korea. North Korea, country in East Asia. It occupies the northern portion of the Korean peninsula, which juts out from the Asian mainland between the East Sea (Sea of Japan) and the Yellow Sea; North Korea covers about 55 percent of the peninsula’s land area. The country is bordered by China and Russia to the north and by the Republic of Korea (South Korea) to the south. The national capital, P’yŏngyang, is a major industrial and transport centre near the west coast. North Korea faces South Korea across a demilitarized zone (DMZ) 2.5 miles (4 km) wide that was established by the terms of the 1953 armistice that ended fighting in the Korean War (1950–53). The DMZ, which runs for about 150 miles (240 km), constitutes the 1953 military cease-fire line and roughly follows latitude 38° N (the 38th parallel) from the mouth of the Han River on the west coast of the Korean peninsula to a little south of the North Korean town of Kosŏng on the east coast. Mountains and valleys characterize most of North Korea. The Kaema Highlands in the northeast have an average elevation of 3,300 feet (1,000 metres) above sea level and form the topographic roof of the entire Korean peninsula. Mount Paektu (9,022 feet [2,750 metres]), the highest mountain in North Korea and on the peninsula, rises at the northern edge of this plateau in the Changbaek (Changbai) Mountains along the Sino-Korean border; it is an extinct volcano topped by a large crater lake. The Nangnim Mountains run from north to south through the middle of the country, forming a divide between the eastern and western slopes of the peninsula. The Kangnam and Myohyang ranges and Mounts Ŏnjin and Myŏrak, all structural extensions of the Nangnim Mountains, extend parallel to each other toward the southwest. Large river-valley plains have developed between the western mountains; they merge along the narrow, irregular coastal plain on the west coast. The Hamgyŏng Mountains, extending from the Nangnim Mountains to the northeast, form a steep slope between the Kaema Highlands and the East Sea. The T’aebaek Mountains extend from southeastern North Korea into South Korea along the eastern coast; one peak, Mount Kŭmgang (5,374 feet [1,638 metres]), is renowned for its scenic beauty. The longest river of North Korea is the Yalu, in Korean called the Amnok. It rises on the southern slope of Mount Paektu and flows southwestward for some 500 miles (800 km) to its mouth on Korea Bay. The Tumen (Tuman) River also begins at Mount Paektu but runs northeastward for about 325 miles (520 km) to the East Sea. There are no large streams along the east coast except for the Tumen River, and all the significant rivers, such as the Yalu, Ch’ŏngch’ŏn, Taedong, Chaeryŏng, and Yesŏng, drain to the Yellow Sea. The relatively large valley plains of the western rivers are major agricultural regions. More than three-fifths of the soils are locally derived from the weathering of granitic rocks or various kinds of schists (crystalline rocks). The soils are generally brownish, abundant in sandy materials, and low in fertility. Well-developed reddish brown soils derived from limestone are found in North Hwanghae province and the southern part of South P’yŏngan province. Podzols (ash-gray forest soil) have developed in the Kaema Highlands as a result of the cold climate and coniferous forest cover there. Although most of the soils are infertile and lack organic content, the valleys and coastal plains have relatively rich alluvial soils. North Korea has a generally cool continental climate. The winter season, from December to March, is long and cold; mean temperatures in January range between about 20 °F (−7 °C) in the south and −10 °F (−23 °C) in the northern interior. The summer, from June to September, is warm, with mean July temperatures above the upper 60s F (about 20 °C) in most places. Accordingly, the annual range of temperatures is large—about 54 °F (30 °C) at P’yŏngyang and about 77 °F (43 °C) at Chunggang (Chunggangjin), where the lowest temperature in the Korean peninsula, −46.5 °F (−43.6 °C), has been recorded. Because of ocean currents and the mountain ranges bordering the narrow coastal lowlands, winter temperatures on the east coast are some 5 to 7 °F (3 to 4 °C) higher than those of the west coast. Most of the country receives about 40 inches (1,000 mm) of precipitation annually. The northern inland plateau, however, receives only about 24 inches (610 mm) and the lower reaches of the Taedong River valley 32 inches (810 mm), while the upper Ch’ŏngch’ŏn River area averages between about 48 and 52 inches (1,220 and 1,320 mm) yearly. Some three-fifths of the annual precipitation falls in the four months from June to September; this heavy concentration of rainfall is related to the humid summer monsoon from the Pacific Ocean, which also produces occasional typhoons (tropical cyclones). Only a small portion of the total precipitation occurs in winter, generally as snow; snowfall can be locally heavy, as in the T’aebaek Mountains. There are about 200 frost-free days along the coast but fewer than 120 in the northern Kaema Highlands. Vegetation on the highlands, especially around Mount Paektu, consists of coniferous trees such as the Siberian fir, spruce, pine, and Korean pine (Pinus koraiensis). The western lowlands were originally covered by temperate mixed forests with many types of plants, but continuous deforestation has left only remote patches of the original forests. Most of the lowlands are now cultivated, except for some of the hills that are covered with small pine groves mixed with oaks, lindens, maples, and birches. Along streams that are subject to flooding or where the ground is too stony for cultivation, reeds, sedges, wild mulberry trees, and Italian poplars are found. Common river fish include carp and eels. Because of deforestation, the populations of deer, mountain antelope, goats, tigers, and leopards have greatly decreased and are restricted to the remote forests. In the plains, however, it is still possible to see wild pigeons, herons, cranes (which nest near areas of human habitation), and many migratory waterfowl, which alight in the rice fields. The DMZ between North and South Korea has become a de facto nature preserve. Once farmland and subsequently a devastated battleground, the DMZ has lain almost untouched since the end of hostilities in 1953 and has reverted to nature to a large extent, making it one of the most pristine undeveloped areas in Asia. The zone contains many ecosystems including forests, estuaries, and wetlands frequented by migratory birds. It serves as a sanctuary for hundreds of bird species, among them the endangered white-naped and red-crowned cranes, and is home to dozens of fish species and Asiatic black bears, lynxes, and other mammals.",

                "content": "The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has started distributing refunds totaling more than $72 million to players impacted by Fortnite's billing practices. This refund follows a $245-million settlement with Fortnite developer Epic Games, announced in December 2022, over allegations that the game maker used \"dark patterns\" to trick players into unwanted purchases. The FTC alleged that Fortnite's design caused players to incur unwanted charges through misleading and confusing button configurations. These included charges occurring during sleep mode, on loading screens, or while previewing items. FTC chair Lina Khan wrote on X, formerly Twitter, Monday that the company had been \"tricking players.\" \"The @FTC previously ordered Epic Games to pay $245 million for tricking players into making unwanted purchases & letting kids rack up unauthorized charges,\" she wrote. \"We are now sending the first round of refunds totaling more than $72 million to those harmed.\" Epic Games acknowledged the settlement in a 2022 statement, saying, \"No developer creates a game with the intention of ending up here,\" but denied it had broken the law. \"Statutes written decades ago don't specify how gaming ecosystems should operate,\" the company said in the statement. \"The laws have not changed, but their application has evolved and long-standing industry practices are no longer enough. We accepted this agreement because we want Epic to be at the forefront of consumer protection and provide the best experience for our players.\" Newsweek has contacted Epic Games via social media, and the FTC via email for comment. Refunds are being sent to 629,344 claimants in the form of PayPal payments or checks, with the average payout approximately $114. Eligible consumers who missed the October 2024 filing deadline can still file claims until January 10, 2025. Players eligible for a refund must meet specific criteria and file a claim online. You may qualify for a refund if you were charged for unwanted items between January 2017 and September 2022, your child made unauthorized charges between January 2017 and November 2018, or your Fortnite account was locked after disputing wrongful charges. Claims can be filed at www.ftc.gov/fortnite or www.fortniterefund.com/file-a-claim. Claimants need either a claim number or their Epic Account ID. If you are under 18, a parent or guardian must submit the claim on your behalf. No fees are required to apply, and the FTC has warned against scams asking for payments to process refunds. Refund payments will be delivered through the payment method selected when filing the claim. PayPal payments must be redeemed within 30 days, while checks must be cashed within 90 days. Consumers with questions can contact Rust Consulting, the refund administrator, at 1-833-915-0880 or email admin@fortniterefund.com.

Tags: The Federal Trade Commission is sending refunds totaling more than $72 million to consumers who were tricked by Epic Games, maker of the popular video game Fortnite, into making unwanted purchases. As part of a settlement first announced in December 2022, the FTC obtained an order requiring Epic Games to pay $245 million to resolve allegations that the game maker used design tactics known as dark patterns to trick players into making unwanted purchases, let children rack up unauthorized charges without any parental involvement, and blocked some users who disputed unauthorized charges from accessing their purchased content. The FTC alleged that Fortnite’s counterintuitive, inconsistent, and confusing button configuration led players of all ages to incur unwanted charges based on the press of a single button. For example, players could be charged while attempting to wake the game from sleep mode, while the game was in a loading screen, or by pressing an adjacent button while attempting simply to preview an item. The FTC is sending its first round of payments in this matter and will distribute additional money at a later date. Today, the FTC is sending 629,344 total payments, about half of which are PayPal payments and the other half are checks. Consumers selected their payment method when they completed their claim form. Recipients should redeem their PayPal payment within 30 days and cash their checks within 90 days, as indicated on the check. The average payment is about $114. Consumers who have questions about their payment should contact the refund administrator, Rust Consulting, Inc., at 1-833-915-0880 or by email at admin@fortniterefund.com, or visit the FTC website to view frequently asked questions about the refund process. The Commission never requires people to pay money or provide account information to get a refund. Eligible consumers can still submit a claim online. The claim form is available at www.ftc.gov/fortnite. The Commission’s interactive dashboards for refund data provide a state-by-state breakdown of refunds in FTC cases. In 2023, FTC actions led to $330 million in refunds to consumers across the country. The Federal Trade Commission works to promote competition and protect and educate consumers. The FTC will never demand money, make threats, tell you to transfer money, or promise you a prize.

                "content": "Tamaurice William \"Tee\" Higgins (born January 18, 1999) is an American professional football wide receiver for the Cincinnati Bengals of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at Clemson, where he won the 2019 College Football Playoff National Championship as a sophomore, and was selected by the Bengals with the first pick in the second round of the 2020 NFL draft. Higgins attended Oak Ridge High School in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.[1] As a senior, he had 68 receptions for 1,044 yards and 18 touchdowns.[2] A five star recruit, Higgins originally committed to the University of Tennessee to play college football before changing to Clemson University.[3] Higgins also played basketball in high school and was offered scholarships to play college basketball by numerous schools.[4] As a freshman at Clemson in 2017, Higgins played in 13 games and had 17 receptions for 345 yards and two touchdowns.[5][6][7] Higgins entered his sophomore season in 2018 as a starter.[8] In the College Football Playoff National Championship, he had three receptions for 81 yards in the 44–16 victory over Alabama.[9] He finished with 59 receptions for 936 receiving yards and 12 receiving touchdowns.[10] In his junior season, Higgins had 1,167 receiving yards and 13 touchdowns as his team finished with a 14–1 record, making it all the way to the National Championship, which Clemson lost to LSU by a score of 42–25. Higgins had a 36-yard rushing touchdown and caught 3 passes for 52 yards in the game.[11][12] Higgins decided to forgo his final year of eligibility and declare for the 2020 NFL draft.[13] In the 2020 NFL draft, Higgins was selected by the Cincinnati Bengals in the second round with the 33rd overall pick.[17] On July 28, 2020, Higgins signed his rookie deal, a four-year contract worth $8.6 million.[18] Higgins made his NFL debut in Week 1 of the 2020 season against the Los Angeles Chargers.[19] In Week 2, he recorded his first three professional receptions for 35 yards against the Cleveland Browns on Thursday Night Football.[20] In Week 3, against the Philadelphia Eagles, Higgins had five receptions for 40 yards and his first two professional receiving touchdowns in the 23–23 tie.[21] In Week 6 against the Indianapolis Colts, he had six receptions for 125 receiving yards in the 31–27 loss.[22] In Week 10 against the Pittsburgh Steelers, he had seven receptions for 115 receiving yards and one receiving touchdown during the 36–10 loss.[23] Higgins finished his rookie season with 67 receptions for 908 yards and six receiving touchdowns.[24] His 67 catches tied a Bengals rookie record set by Cris Collinsworth in 1981.[25] The record was broken the following year by rookie wide receiver Ja'Marr Chase, with 81 receptions.[26] His 908 receiving yards ranked him third among all rookie receivers in 2020.[27] In Week 12, against the Steelers, Higgins had six receptions for 114 receiving yards and a touchdown in the 41–10 victory.[28] In the following game, he had nine receptions for 138 yards and a touchdown in the 41–22 loss to the Chargers.[29] In Week 16, against the Baltimore Ravens, he had 12 receptions for 194 receiving yards and two receiving touchdowns in the 41–21 victory.[30] Higgins finished the 2021 regular season with 74 receptions for 1,091 yards and six receiving touchdowns in 14 games played, improving upon his rookie season.[31] In the Divisional Round against the Tennessee Titans, Higgins recorded 7 receptions for 96 yards in the 19–16 win.[32] In the AFC Championship Game against the Kansas City Chiefs, Higgins caught six passes for 103 yards, leading the Bengals in receiving yards in the 27–24 overtime win to advance to Super Bowl LVI.[33] In Super Bowl LVI, Higgins scored the Bengals' first touchdown of the game, a 6-yard pass from Joe Mixon.[34] On the first play from scrimmage of the second half, Higgins scored a 75-yard touchdown pass, his second touchdown of the game.[35] Higgins finished the game catching four passes for 100 yards, the most receiving yards by a player on either team in the 23–20 loss.[36] In Week 1 against the Steelers, Higgins left the game in the second quarter with a concussion.[37] In Week 4 against the Miami Dolphins, Higgins had seven receptions for 124 yards, including a touchdown.[38] In Week 11, against the Pittsburgh Steelers, he had nine receptions for 148 receiving yards in the 37–30 victory.[39] In the following game against the Titans, he had seven receptions for 114 yards and a touchdown in the 20–16 victory.[40] In Week 16 against the New England Patriots, he had eight receptions for 128 receiving yards and one receiving touchdown in the 22–18 victory.[41] In a Week 17 game against the Buffalo Bills, after making a catch near midfield, Higgins was tackled by Damar Hamlin. After the play, Hamlin stood up but immediately collapsed; it was later determined that the impact of the play caused commotio cordis. First responders initiated CPR and administered defibrillation on the field. The game was ultimately postponed and cancelled.[42][43][44] Higgins, distraught and guilt-ridden by his involvement in the play that caused Hamlin to collapse, kept in touch with Hamlin and his family as he recovered and exchanged prayers with them.[45] Following the incident, donations to a charity Higgins supported increased rapidly in support of Hamlin.[46][47][48] Hamlin ultimately made a full recovery and returned to the Bills for the 2023 season. Higgins finished the 2022 season with 74 receptions for 1,029 receiving yards and seven receiving touchdowns.[49] He had six receptions for 83 yards and a touchdown in the 23–20 loss to the Chiefs in the AFC Championship.[50] Higgins announced in September 2021 that he planned on switching his jersey number from No. 85 back to No. 5, his old college number.[51] Higgins stated that he often saw on social media that many users were nicknaming him \"Ochocinco 2.0\" (in reference to former Bengals receiver Chad Johnson), with Higgins stating \"I don't want to be a 2.0. [I want] to be Tee Higgins 1.0 and make a name for myself [in] this organization\". However, he was unable to change his number in time for the 2022 season, instead with the change taking effect in 2023.[52] In Week 2 against the Ravens, Higgins had a two-touchdown game, with 8 receptions for 89 yards in the 27–24 loss. During the Bengals' Week 4 game against the Titans, Higgins suffered a rib injury and was ruled out for the remainder of that game, as well as the following week against the Arizona Cardinals.[53] He had his first 100-yard game of the season in Week 9 against the Bills, making eight catches for 110 yards.[54] On November 8, 2023, Higgins injured his hamstring during practice, and was ruled inactive for the following three games. He returned in Week 13 against the Jacksonville Jaguars.[55] During the Bengals' Week 17 loss against the Kansas City Chiefs, Higgins re-aggravated his previous hamstring injury, leading to him being ruled inactive for the final game of the season against the Cleveland Browns.[56] He finished the season with career lows in all major statistical categories, with 656 yards on 42 receptions and five touchdowns.[57] On February 26, 2024, the Bengals placed the franchise tag on Higgins.[58] On June 17, 2024, Higgins re-signed with the Bengals on a one-year contract.[59] He sat out the first two games of the Bengals' season with a hamstring injury.[60] He made his season debut against the Washington Commanders in Week 3. Higgins had two touchdowns and 83 yards on nine catches in the Bengals Week 5 loss to the Baltimore Ravens.[61]",

Spin: Higgins was overshadowed by superstar Ja'Marr Chase's standout performance (14-177-2), resulting in paltry fantasy numbers for Higgins managers Monday and his lowest catch total of the season. This isn't the first time this has happened, and it likely won't be the last, but fantasy GMs must keep faith in the talented No. 2 option for Cincinnati. Higgins could be in store for a bounce-back performance against the lowly Titans on Sunday. ESPN Fantasy Projection: Higgins is back -- on the franchise tag -- for his fifth pro season with the Bengals. In 12 games played last season, Higgins averaged 11.5 fantasy PPG, but was inconsistent, scoring 22 or more points three times but below 10 points on seven occasions. Higgins will remain unpredictable at times as the secondary target behind Ja'Marr Chase, but he has ability to win on the boundary or as a seam stretcher from the slot. Having a healthy Joe Burrow back on the field for this high-powered offense puts Higgins in the mid-tier flex range, with WR2 upside.",

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. The future is quickly looking brighter for the Cincinnati Bengals, who have been mired in a disappointing season so far. Cincinnati kept its playoff hopes alive after defeating the Cowboys on Monday night. After the game, Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow gave an optimistic response when asked about receiver Tee Higgins' future with the team. Higgins is playing this season under the franchise tag after he and the Bengals were unable to come to terms on an extension this past offseason. Burrow, though, feels that things will be different this time around. \"We don't know, but those discussions are ongoing,\" Burrow said. \"I'm confident that I think we're gonna be able to do what it takes to bring Tee back. I know that I'm gonna do what it takes to get him back, and so is he. We've had those talks. Those are gonna be off-season discussions, but I think we're excited about that opportunity.\" Burrow's comments made their way back to Higgins, who said he never ruled out returning to Cincinnati. Higgins did reportedly request a trade after the Bengals initially franchise tagged him last offseason. \"That's cool. That would be exciting to return here and what not,\" Higgins said. \"Shout out Joe.\" When asked if it's feasible for the Bengals to keep Burrow, Higgins and fellow wideout Ja'Marr Chase, Higgins said that is \"a question for upstairs. I've got no clue.\" Chase, who leads the NFL this season with 15 touchdown receptions, is also due for a new deal and is expected to be compensated as one of (if not the) highest-paid players at his position. Higgins' projected market value is $18.8 million per year over five years, according to Spotrac. That's a bargain for a player of Higgins' caliber. A two-time 1,000-yard receiver, Higgins was part of Burrow's 2020 draft class. The two have played an integral role in the franchise's rise from a last-place team to a perennial AFC contender. Burrow, who is enjoying his best season to date, knows what Higgins' presence means for him and his teammates. \"You feel his presence when he's out there,\" Burrow said. \"You feel how it affects a defense. You feel how it affects the defensive coordinator's calls. Even if he's not super productive on a night, teams have to worry about him. ... A defense is worried about him, and you feel that.\" While they're not out of the woods, Bengals fans who were worried about losing Higgins can breathe a little sigh of relief. Higgins wants to stay, and the team's franchise quarterback is going to do his part to make that happen. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

                "content": "Manage your account Residents in New Jersey have reported dozens of sightings of large drones consistently flying in night skies throughout much of the state over the last few weeks. Similar sightings are being claimed on social media in Pennsylvania and New York's Staten Island. The FBI is in charge of a multi-agency investigation and has asked the public to report sightings directly to that agency. No sightings have been reported in Delaware as of Monday, Dec. 10, according to the Delaware State Police. More: NJ drone sightings have residents watching the skies. Should you believe social media? Although New Jersey law enforcement officials have said there is no known threat to public safety, the sightings have the public spooked, and many residents, as well as some elected officials, are demanding answers. Here’s what to know. For the past few weeks, residents in New Jersey have reported consistent sightings of large drones, estimated to be around six feet long, flying over various parts of the state, including over rivers, reservoirs and at least one military research facility, on a near nightly basis. The sightings began just before Thanksgiving in Morris County, New Jersey, located in the northwest portion of the state. According to the Asbury Park Press, some eyewitnesses have described the objects as “car-sized” and say that they appear as the sun begins to set. Since the original sightings, the drones reportedly spread to Sussex, Somerset and Warren counties as well as other areas in North Jersey. More recently, the drones have been anecdotally spotted from Delaware County, Pennsylvania, Philadelphia's Mayfair area, as well as across South Jersey and the Jersey Shore. As of now, it is unknown where the drones are coming from or what they are being used for. Law enforcement and government officials in New Jersey have remained steadfast that there is no threat to public safety, but investigation efforts have ramped up as community pages on social media light up with new alleged sightings. It was announced on Wednesday, Nov. 27 that the FBI had joined the New Jersey State Police and the New Jersey Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness in investigations. On Thursday, Dec. 5, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said that he had a briefing about the sightings with U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. “We are actively monitoring the situation and are in close coordination with our federal and law enforcement partners on this matter,” Murphy said in a statement on X, adding that there is currently no indication of any threat to public safety. https://x.com/JerzyBets/status/1858725239837884911?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1858725239837884911%7Ctwgr%5E07960330c68e460818be669c04222aa7cfacdc6f%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.northjersey.com%2Fstory%2Fnews%2Fmorris%2Fmorris-county%2F2024%2F11%2F19%2Fdrones-in-nj-reported-in-morris-county-officials-investigate%2F76428784007%2F The FBI reported that it was investigating reports of a possible “fixed-wing aircraft” seen flying along New Jersey’s Raritan River, a near 70-mile river that flows past president-elect Trump’s Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster. More: North Jersey mayors demand action from NJ, feds on flurry of drone sightings Amy Thoreson, a spokesperson for the FBI’s office in Newark, New Jersey, said on Monday, Dec. 6 that there was no new information about drone sightings over New Jersey. The Federal Aviation Administration also issued temporary flight restrictions over the Trump-owned golf course, as well as the Picatinny Arsenal military research and manufacturing facility. \"We look into all reports of unauthorized drone operations and investigate when appropriate,\" an FAA statement reads. \"Drone operators who conduct unsafe operations that endanger other aircraft or people on the ground could face fines up to $75,000. In addition, we can suspend or revoke drone operators’ pilot certificates.\" Following a bill signing in Princeton on the morning of Monday, Dec. 9, Murphy spoke to reporters from nj.com, Fox and other outlets about the understandable frustration from residents regarding the drones. \"Most importantly ... we don't see any concern to public safety,\" Murphy said to the reporters. \"Having said that, it's really frustrating that we don't have more answers as to where they're coming form and why they're doing what they're doing. We had last night 49 sightings.\" Delaware State Police stated that no similar sightings have been reported in the state as of Monday. For those in or around New Jersey, there are a few ways to report alleged drone activity. Call the FBI at 800-CALL-FBI or submit information online at tips.fbi.gov.

                "content": "The large drones have been repeatedly spotted in New Jersey in recent weeks. The mayors of 21 towns in New Jersey are demanding action in a letter sent to Gov. Phil Murphy over the mysterious drones that have been spotted flying overhead in recent weeks. Since mid-November, large drones of uncertain origin have been repeatedly spotted in the sky at night over central and northern New Jersey. The drones, which are larger than the type typically used by hobbyists, have raised concerns due to their proximity to both a military installation and President-elect Donald Trump's Bedminster golf course. In the letter, the mayors in Morris County called for a full investigation into the drones \"to determine the origin, purpose and compliance with applicable regulations.\" They also demanded the \"implementation of measures to prevent unauthorized or unsafe drone operations\" in Morris County going forward, and \"clear communication to local officials, law enforcement and residents regarding the findings of this investigation.\" \"While the benefits of drone technology are widely recognized when used responsibly and transparently, the lack of information and clarity regarding these operations has caused fear and frustration among our constituents,\" the mayors wrote. \"Despite inquiries made to relevant authorities, we have yet to receive satisfactory answers about the purpose, operators, or safety protocols governing these flights.\" The Federal Aviation Administration has imposed drone flight restrictions while authorities investigate. Local police previously said there is no known threat to public safety. \"Morris County Sheriff James M. Gannon would like to inform everyone that the recent drone activity observed by many in our communities is being actively investigated. There is no advisable immediate danger to the public at this time,\" the Morris County Sheriff's Office said in a statement. Last week, multiple Morris and Somerset county officials said in a joint statement they would continue to monitor the drone activity. \"County and local law enforcement agencies are aware of the recurring reports of drone activity around Morris and Somerset counties, and acknowledge the public's concern about these repeated sightings,\" they said. On Monday, a spokesperson for the FBI said the agency is \"doing all we can figure out what's going on.\" \"The public can continue to call our 800 line, or submit a tip online, we are acting on every substantive lead that we get,\" the FBI spokesperson said. In an interview on Fox News Monday, New York Rep. Nicole Malliotakis said members of the public \"deserve and demand answers\" about the drones. \"I've also reached out to FAA, to the Department of Homeland Security and to the FBI asking for answers, and they are aware of these aircrafts. They are either unmanned aircrafts or drones and they are still trying to figure out where they are coming from and who's behind them. But following what happened with the Chinese spy balloon, that simply is not enough.\" ABC News' Alex Faul contributed to this report. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",

                "content": "Tottenham Hotspur Football Club, commonly referred to as simply Tottenham (/ˈtɒtənəm/,[2][3] TOT-ən-əm, /tɒtnəm/, tot-nəm) or Spurs, is a professional football club based in Tottenham, North London, England. It competes in the Premier League, the top tier of English football. The team has played its home matches in the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium since 2019, replacing their former home of White Hart Lane, which had been demolished to make way for the new stadium on the same site. Founded in 1882, Tottenham Hotspur's emblem is a cockerel standing upon a football, with the Latin motto Audere est Facere (\"to dare is to do\"). The club has traditionally worn white shirts and navy blue shorts as their home kit since the 1898–99 season. Their training ground is on Hotspur Way in Bulls Cross, Enfield. After its inception, Tottenham won the FA Cup for the first time in 1901, the only non-League club to do so since the formation of the Football League in 1888. Tottenham were the first club in the 20th century to achieve the League and FA Cup Double, winning both competitions in the 1960–61 season. After successfully defending the FA Cup in 1962, in 1963 they became the first British club to win a UEFA club competition – the European Cup Winners' Cup.[4] They were also the inaugural winners of the UEFA Cup in 1972, becoming the first British club to win two different major European trophies. They collected at least one major trophy in each of the six decades from the 1950s to 2000s, an achievement only matched by Manchester United.[5][6] In domestic football, Spurs have won two league titles, eight FA Cups, four League Cups, and seven FA Community Shields. In European football, they have won one European Cup Winners' Cup and two UEFA Cups. Tottenham were also runners-up in the 2018–19 UEFA Champions League. They have a long-standing rivalry with nearby club Arsenal, with whom they contest the North London derby. Tottenham is owned by ENIC Group, which purchased the club in 2001. The club was estimated to be worth £2.6 billion ($3.2 billion) in 2024, and it was the eighth-highest-earning football club in the world, with an annual revenue of £549.2 million in 2023.[7][8] Originally named Hotspur Football Club, the club was formed on 5 September 1882 by a group of schoolboys led by Bobby Buckle. They were members of the Hotspur Cricket Club and the football club was formed to play sports during the winter months.[9] A year later the boys sought help with the club from John Ripsher, the Bible class teacher at All Hallows Church, who became the first president of the club and its treasurer. Ripsher helped and supported the boys through the club's formative years, reorganised and found premises for the club.[10][11][12] In April 1884 the club was renamed \"Tottenham Hotspur Football Club\" to avoid confusion with another London club named Hotspur, whose post had been mistakenly delivered to North London.[13][14] Nicknames for the club include \"Spurs\" and \"the Lilywhites\".[15] Initially, the north London side played games between themselves and friendly matches against other local clubs. The first recorded match took place on 30 September 1882 against a local team named the Radicals, which Hotspur lost 2–0.[16] The team entered their first cup competition in the London Association Cup, and won 5–2 in their first competitive match on 17 October 1885 against a company's works team called St Albans.[17] The club's fixtures began to attract the interest of the local community and attendances at its home matches increased. In 1892, they played for the first time in a league, the short-lived Southern Alliance.[18] The club turned professional on 20 December 1895 and, in the summer of 1896, was admitted to Division One of the Southern League (the third tier at the time). On 2 March 1898, the club also became a limited company, the Tottenham Hotspur Football and Athletic Company.[18] Soon after, Frank Brettell became the first ever manager of Spurs, and he signed John Cameron, who took over as player-manager when Brettell left a year later. Cameron would have a significant impact on Spurs, helping the club win its first trophy, the Southern League title in the 1899–1900 season.[19] The following year Spurs won the 1901 FA Cup by beating Sheffield United 3–1 in a replay of the final, after the first game ended in a 2–2 draw. In doing so they became the only non-League club to achieve the feat since the formation of The Football League in 1888.[20] In 1908, the club was elected into the Football League Second Division and won promotion to the First Division in their first season, finishing runners-up. In 1912, Peter McWilliam became manager; Tottenham finished bottom of the league at the end of the 1914–15 season when football was suspended due to the First World War. Spurs were relegated to the Second Division on the resumption of league football after the war, but quickly returned to the First Division as Second Division champions of the 1919–20 season.[21] On 23 April 1921, McWilliam guided Spurs to their second FA Cup win, beating Wolverhampton Wanderers 1–0 in the Cup Final. Spurs finished second to Liverpool in the league in 1922, but would finish mid-table in the next five seasons. Spurs were relegated in the 1927–28 season after McWilliam left. For most of the 1930s and 40s, Spurs languished in the Second Division, apart from a brief return to the top flight in the 1933–34 and 1934–35 seasons.[22] Former Spurs player Arthur Rowe became manager in 1949. Rowe developed a style of play, known as \"push and run\", that proved to be successful in his early years as manager. He took the team back to the First Division after finishing top of the Second Division in the 1949–50 season.[23] In his second season in charge, Tottenham won their first ever top-tier league championship title when they finished top of the First Division for the 1950–51 season.[24][25] Rowe resigned in April 1955 due to a stress-induced illness from managing the club.[26][27] Before he left, he signed one of Spurs' most celebrated players, Danny Blanchflower, who won the FWA Footballer of the Year twice while at Tottenham.[28] Bill Nicholson took over as manager in October 1958. He became the club's most successful manager, guiding the team to major trophy success three seasons in a row in the early 1960s: the Double in 1961, the FA Cup in 1962 and the Cup Winners' Cup in 1963.[29] Nicholson signed Dave Mackay and John White in 1959, two influential players of the Double-winning team, and Jimmy Greaves in 1961, the most prolific goal-scorer in the history of the top tier of English football.[30][31] The 1960–61 season started with a run of 11 wins, followed by a draw and another four wins, at that time the best ever start by any club in the top flight of English football.[32] The title was won on 17 April 1961 when they beat the eventual runner-up Sheffield Wednesday at home 2–1, with three more games still to play.[33] The Double was achieved when Spurs won 2–0 against Leicester City in the final of the 1960–61 FA Cup. It was the first Double of the 20th century, and the first since Aston Villa achieved the feat in 1897.[34] The next year Spurs won their consecutive FA Cup after beating Burnley in the 1962 FA Cup Final.[35] On 15 May 1963, Tottenham became the first British team to win a European trophy by winning the 1962–63 European Cup Winners' Cup when they beat Atlético Madrid 5–1 in the final.[36] Spurs also became the first British team to win two different European trophies when they won the 1971–72 UEFA Cup with a rebuilt team that included Martin Chivers, Pat Jennings, and Steve Perryman.[37] They had also won the FA Cup in 1967,[38] two League Cups (in 1971 and 1973), as well as a second place league finish (1962–63) and runners-up to the 1973–74 UEFA Cup. In total, Nicholson won eight major trophies in his 16 years at the club as manager.[29] Spurs went into a period of decline after the successes of the early 1970s, and Nicholson resigned after a poor start to the 1974–75 season.[39] The team was then relegated at the end of the 1976–77 season with Keith Burkinshaw as manager. Burkinshaw quickly returned the club to the top flight, building a team that included Glenn Hoddle, as well as two Argentinians, Osvaldo Ardiles and Ricardo Villa, which was unusual as players from outside the British Isles were rare at that time.[40] The team that Burkinshaw rebuilt went on to win the FA Cup in 1981 and 1982[41] and the UEFA Cup in 1984.[42] The 1980s was a period of change that began with a new phase of redevelopment at White Hart Lane, as well as a change of directors. Irving Scholar took over the club and moved it in a more commercial direction, the beginning of the transformation of English football clubs into commercial enterprises.[43][44] Debt at the club would again lead to a change in the boardroom, and Terry Venables teamed up with businessman Alan Sugar in June 1991 to take control of Tottenham Hotspur plc.[45][46][47] Venables, who had become manager in 1987, signed players such as Paul Gascoigne and Gary Lineker. Under Venables, Spurs won the 1990–91 FA Cup, making them the first club to win eight FA Cups.[48] Tottenham was one of the five clubs that pushed for the founding of the Premier League, created with the approval of The Football Association, replacing the Football League First Division as the highest division of English football.[49] Despite a succession of managers and players such as Teddy Sheringham, Jürgen Klinsmann and David Ginola, for a long period in the Premier League until the late 2000s, Spurs finished mid-table most seasons with few trophies won. They won the League Cup in 1999 under George Graham, and again in 2008 under Juande Ramos. Performance improved under Harry Redknapp with players such as Gareth Bale and Luka Modrić, and the club finished in the top five in the early 2010s.[50][51] In February 2001, Sugar sold his shareholding in Spurs to ENIC Sports plc, run by Joe Lewis and Daniel Levy, and stepped down as chairman.[52] Lewis and Levy would eventually own 85% of the club, with Levy responsible for the running of the club.[53][54] They appointed Mauricio Pochettino as head coach, who was in the role between 2014 and 2019.[55] Under Pochettino, Spurs finished second in the 2016–17 season, their highest league finish since the 1962–63 season, and advanced to the UEFA Champions League final in 2019, the club's first, where they ultimately lost to Liverpool 2–0.[56][57][58] Pochettino was subsequently sacked after a poor start to the 2019–20 season, in November 2019, and was replaced by José Mourinho.[59] Mourinho was sacked in April 2021,[60] while Nuno Espírito Santo lasted just four months as his successor.[61] The next manager, Antonio Conte, guided Spurs to fourth during the 2021–22 season and back to a Champions League place.[62] Following a poor run of form, Conte criticised the players and management of the club in press conferences; after exiting both the Champions League and FA Cup, he departed the club by mutual agreement in March 2023.[63][64] Ange Postecoglou took over as head coach on 1 July 2023[65] and the club qualified for the 2024–25 UEFA Europa League after a fifth-place finish in the Premier League. Spurs played their early matches on public land at the Park Lane end of Tottenham Marshes, where they had to mark out and prepare their own pitch.[9] Occasionally fights broke out on the marshes in disputes with other teams over the use of the ground.[66] The first Spurs game reported by the local press took place on Tottenham Marshes on 6 October 1883 against Brownlow Rovers, which Spurs won 9–0.[67] It was at this ground that, in 1887, Spurs first played the team that would later become their arch rivals, Arsenal (then known as Royal Arsenal), leading 2–1 until the match was called off due to poor light after the away team arrived late.[68] As they played on public parkland, the club could not charge admission fees and, while the number of spectators grew to a few thousand, it yielded no gate receipts. In 1888, the club rented a pitch between numbers 69 and 75 Northumberland Park[69] at a cost of £17 per annum, where spectators were charged 3d a game, raised to 6d for cup ties.[70] The first game at the Park was played on 13 October 1888, a reserve match that yielded gate receipts of 17 shillings. The first stand with just over 100 seats and changing rooms underneath was built at the ground for the 1894–95 season at a cost of £60. However, the stand was blown down a few weeks later and had to be repaired.[71] In April 1898, 14,000 fans turned up to watch Spurs play Woolwich Arsenal. Spectators climbed on the roof of the refreshment stand for a better view of the match. The stand collapsed, causing a few injuries. As Northumberland Park could no longer cope with the larger crowds, Spurs looked for a larger ground and moved to the White Hart Lane site in 1899.[72] The White Hart Lane ground was built on an unused plant nursery owned by the Charrington Brewery and located behind a public house named the White Hart on Tottenham High Road (the road White Hart Lane actually lies a few hundred yards north of the main entrance). The ground was initially leased from Charringtons, and the stands they used at Northumberland Park were moved here, giving shelter for 2,500 spectators.[73] Notts County were the first visitors to 'the Lane' in a friendly watched by 5,000 people and yielding £115 in receipts; Spurs won 4–1.[74] Queens Park Rangers became the first competitive visitors to the ground and 11,000 people saw them lose 1–0 to Tottenham. In 1905, Tottenham raised enough money to buy the freehold to the land, as well as land at the northern (Paxton Road) end.[73] After Spurs were admitted to the Football League, the club started to build a new stadium, with stands designed by Archibald Leitch being constructed over the next two and a half decades. The West Stand was added in 1909, the East Stand was also covered this year and extended further two years later. The profits from the 1921 FA Cup win were used to build a covered terrace at the Paxton Road end and the Park Lane end was built at a cost of over £3,000 some two years later. This increased the stadium's capacity to around 58,000, with room for 40,000 under cover. The East Stand (Worcester Avenue) was finished in 1934 and this increased capacity to around 80,000 spectators and cost £60,000.[73] Starting in the early 1980s, the stadium underwent another major phase of redevelopment. The West Stand was replaced by an expensive new structure in 1982, and the East Stand was renovated in 1988. In 1992, following the Taylor Report's recommendation that Premier League clubs eliminate standing areas, the lower terraces of the south and east stand were converted to seating, with the North Stand becoming all-seater the following season. The South Stand redevelopment was completed in March 1995 and included the first giant Sony Jumbotron TV screen for live game coverage and away match screenings.[75] In the 1997–98 season the Paxton Road stand received a new upper tier and a second Jumbotron screen.[75] Minor amendments to the seating configuration were made in 2006, bringing the capacity of the stadium to 36,310.[73] By the turn of the millennium, the capacity of White Hart Lane had become lower than other major Premier League clubs. Talks began over the future of the ground with a number of schemes considered, such as increasing the stadium capacity through redevelopment of the current site, or using of the 2012 London Olympic Stadium in Stratford.[76][77] Eventually the club settled on the Northumberland Development Project, whereby a new stadium would be built on a larger piece of land that incorporated the existing site. In 2016, the northeast corner of the stadium was removed to facilitate the construction of the new stadium. As this reduced the stadium capacity below that required for European games, Tottenham Hotspur played every European home game in 2016–17 at Wembley Stadium.[78] Domestic fixtures of the 2016–17 season continued to be played at the Lane, but demolition of the rest of the stadium started the day after the last game of the season,[79] and White Hart Lane was completely demolished by the end of July 2017.[80] In October 2008, the club announced a plan to build a new stadium immediately to the north of the existing White Hart Lane stadium, with the southern half of the new stadium's pitch overlapping the northern part of the Lane.[81] This proposal would become the Northumberland Development Project. The club submitted a planning application in October 2009 but, following critical reactions to the plan, it was withdrawn in favour of a substantially revised planning application for the stadium and other associated developments. The new plan was resubmitted and approved by Haringey Council in September 2010,[82] and an agreement for the Northumberland Development Project was signed on 20 September 2011.[83] After a long delay over the compulsory purchase order of local businesses located on land to the north of the stadium and a legal challenge against the order,[84][85] resolved in early 2015,[86] planning application for another new design was approved by Haringey Council on 17 December 2015.[87] Construction started in 2016,[88] and the new stadium was scheduled to open during the 2018–19 season.[89][90] While it was under construction, all Tottenham home games in the 2017–18 season as well as all but five in 2018–19 were played at Wembley Stadium.[91] After two successful test events, Tottenham Hotspur officially moved into the new ground on 3 April 2019[92] with a Premier League match against Crystal Palace which Spurs won 2–0.[93] The new stadium is called Tottenham Hotspur Stadium while a naming-rights agreement is reached.[94] An early training ground used by Tottenham was located at Brookfield Lane in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire. The club bought the 11-acre ground used by Cheshunt F.C. in 1952 for £35,000.[95][96] It had three pitches, including a small stadium with a small stand used for matches by the junior team.[97] The ground was later sold for over £4 million,[98] and the club moved the training ground to the Spurs Lodge on Luxborough Lane, Chigwell in Essex, opened in September 1996 by Tony Blair.[99] The training ground and press centre in Chigwell were used until 2014.[100] In 2007, Tottenham bought a site at Bulls Cross in Enfield, a few miles south of their former ground in Cheshunt. A new training ground was constructed at the site for £45 million, which opened in 2012.[101] The 77-acre site has 15 grass pitches and one-and-a-half artificial pitches, as well as a covered artificial pitch in the main building.[102][103] The main building on Hotspur Way also has hydrotherapy and swimming pools, gyms, medical facilities, dining and rest areas for players as well as classrooms for academy and schoolboy players. A 45-bedroom players lodge with catering, treatment, rest and rehabilitation facilities was later added at Myddleton Farm next to the training site in 2018.[104][105] The lodge is mainly used by Tottenham's first team and Academy players, but it has also been used by national football teams – the first visitors to use the facilities at the site were the Brazilian team in preparation for the 2018 FIFA World Cup.[106] Since the 1921 FA Cup Final the Tottenham Hotspur crest has featured a cockerel. Harry Hotspur, after whom the club is named, was said to have been given the nickname Hotspur as he dug in his spurs to make his horse go faster as he charged in battles,[107] and spurs are also associated with fighting cocks.[108] The club used spurs as a symbol in 1900, which then evolved into a fighting cock.[107] A former player named William James Scott made a bronze cast of a cockerel standing on a football at a cost of £35 (equivalent to £4,610 in 2023), and this 9-foot-6-inch (2.90 m) figure was then placed on top of the West Stand at the end of the 1909–10 season.[107] Since then the cockerel and ball emblem has become a part of the club's identity.[109] The club badge on the shirt used in 1921 featured a cockerel within a shield, but it was changed to a cockerel sitting on a ball in the late 1960s.[108] Between 1956 and 2006 Spurs used a faux heraldic shield featuring a number of local landmarks and associations. The castle is Bruce Castle, 400 yards from the ground and the trees are the Seven Sisters. The arms featured the Latin motto Audere Est Facere (to dare is to do).[66] In 1983, to overcome unauthorised \"pirate\" merchandising, the club's badge was altered by adding the two red heraldic lions to flank the shield (which came from the arms of the Northumberland family, of which Harry Hotspur was a member), as well as the motto scroll. This device appeared on Spurs' playing kits for three seasons 1996–99. In 2006, in order to rebrand and modernise the club's image, the club badge and coat of arms were replaced by a professionally designed logo/emblem.[110] This revamp displayed a sleeker and more elegant cockerel standing on an old-time football. The club claimed that they dropped their club name and would be using the rebranded logo only on playing kits.[111] In November 2013, Tottenham forced non-league club Fleet Spurs to change their badge because its new design was \"too similar\" to the Tottenham crest.[112] In 2017, Spurs added a shield around the cockerel logo on the shirts similar to the 1950s badge, but with the cockerel of modern design.[113] The shield was however removed the following season. The first Tottenham kit recorded in 1883 included a navy blue shirt with a letter H on a scarlet shield on the left breast, and white breeches.[114] In 1884 or 1885, the club changed to a \"quartered\" kit similar to Blackburn Rovers after watching them win in the 1884 FA Cup Final.[115] After they moved to Northumberland Park in 1888, they returned to the navy blue shirts for the 1889–90 season. Their kit changed again to red shirt and blue shorts in 1890, and for a time the team were known as 'the Tottenham Reds'.[116] Five years later in 1895, the year they became a professional club, they switched to a chocolate and gold striped kit.[66] In the 1898–99 season, their final year at Northumberland Park, the club switched colours to white shirts and blue shorts, same colour choice as that for Preston North End.[117] White and navy blue have remained as the club's basic colours ever since, with the white shirts giving the team the nickname \"The Lilywhites\".[118] In 1921, the year they won the FA Cup, the cockerel badge was added to the shirt for the final. A club crest has featured on the shirt since, and Spurs became the first major club to have its club crest on the players shirt on every match apart from the war years.[119] In 1939 numbers first appeared on shirt backs.[66] In the early days, the team played in kits sold by local outfitters. An early supplier of Spurs' jerseys recorded was a firm on Seven Sisters Road, HR Brookes.[70] In the 1920s, Bukta produced the jerseys for the club. From the mid-1930s onwards, Umbro was the supplier for forty years. In 1959, the V-neck shirt replaced the collared shirts of the past, and then in 1963, the crew neck shirt appeared (the style has fluctuated since).[120] In 1961, Bill Nicholson sent Spurs players out to play in white instead of navy shorts for their European campaign, starting a tradition which continues to this day in European competitions.[121] In 1977, a deal was signed with Admiral to supply the team their kits. Although Umbro kits in generic colours had been sold to football fans since 1959, it was with the Admiral deal that the market for replica shirts started to take off.[122] Admiral changed the plain colours of earlier strips to shirts with more elaborate designs, which included manufacturer's logos, stripes down the arms and trims on the edges.[122] Admiral was replaced by Le Coq Sportif in the summer of 1980.[123] In 1985, Spurs entered into a business partnership with Hummel, who then supplied the strips.[124] However, the attempt by Tottenham to expand the business side of the club failed, and in 1991, they returned to Umbro.[125] In 1991, the club was the first to wear long-cut shorts, an innovation at a time when football kits all featured shorts cut well above the knee.[66] Umbro was followed by Pony in 1995, Adidas in 1999, Kappa in 2002,[66][126] and a five-year deal with Puma in 2006.[127] In March 2011, Under Armour announced a five-year deal to supply Spurs with shirts and other apparel from the start of 2012–13,[128][129] with the home, away and the third kits revealed in July and August 2012.[130][131] The shirts incorporate technology that can monitor the players' heart rate and temperature and send the biometric data to the coaching staff.[132] In June 2017, it was announced that Nike would be their new kits supplier, with the 2017–18 kit released on 30 June, featuring the Spurs' crest encased in a shield, paying homage to Spurs' 1960–61 season, where they became the first post-war-club to win both the Football League First Division and the FA Cup.[133] In October 2018, Nike agreed a 15-year deal reportedly worth £30 million a year with the club to supply their kits until 2033.[134] Shirt sponsorship in English football was first adopted by the non-league club Kettering Town F.C. in 1976 despite it being banned by the FA.[135] FA soon lifted the ban, and this practice spread to the major clubs when sponsored shirts were allowed on non-televised games in 1979, and then on televised games as well in 1983.[132][136] In December 1983, after the club was floated on the London Stock Exchange, Holsten became the first commercial sponsor logo to appear on a Spurs shirt.[137] When Thomson was chosen as kit sponsor in 2002 some Tottenham fans were unhappy as the shirt-front logo was red, the colour of their closest rivals, Arsenal.[138] In 2006, Tottenham secured a £34 million sponsorship deal with internet casino group Mansion.com.[139] In July 2010, Spurs announced a two-year shirt sponsorship contract with software infrastructure company Autonomy said to be worth £20 million.[140] A month later they unveiled a £5 million deal with leading specialist bank and asset management firm Investec as shirt sponsor for the Champions League and domestic cup competitions for the next two years.[141][142] Since 2014, AIA has been the main shirt sponsor, initially in a deal worth over £16 million annually,[143][144] increased to a reported £40 to £45 million per year in 2019 in an eight-year deal that lasts until 2027.[145][146] In 2023, Tottenham provisionally agreed a three-year shirt sponsorship deal with South Africa Tourism (SAT) starting in 2023/24 and ending in the 2026/27 season.[147] Tottenham Hotspur F.C. became a limited company, the Tottenham Hotspur Football and Athletic Company Ltd, on 2 March 1898 so as to raise funds for the club and limit the personal liability of its members. 8,000 shares were issued at £1 each, although only 1,558 shares were taken up in the first year.[155] 4,892 shares were sold in total by 1905.[156] A few families held significant shares; they included the Wale family, who had association with the club since the 1930s,[157] as well as the Richardson and the Bearman families. From 1943 to 1984, members of these families were chairmen of Tottenham Hotspur F.C. after Charles Robert who had been chairman since 1898 died.[158] In the early 1980s, cost overruns in the construction of a new West Stand together with the cost of rebuilding the team in previous years led to accumulating debts. In November 1982, a fan of the club Irving Scholar bought 25% of Tottenham for £600,000, and together with Paul Bobroff gained control of the club.[47] In order to bring in funds, Scholar floated Tottenham Hotspur plc, which wholly owns the football club, on the London Stock Exchange in 1983, the first European sports club to be listed in a stock market, and became the first sports company to go public.[43][156] Fans and institutions alike can now freely buy and trade shares in the company; a court ruling in 1935 involving the club (Berry and Stewart v Tottenham Hotspur FC Ltd) had previously established a precedent in company law that the directors of a company can refuse the transfer of shares from a shareholder to another person.[159] The share issue was successful with 3.8 million shares quickly sold.[160] However, ill-judged business decisions under Scholar led to financial difficulties,[155] and in June 1991 Terry Venables teamed up with businessman Alan Sugar to buy the club, initially as equal partner with each investing £3.25 million. Sugar increased his stake to £8 million by December 1991 and became the dominant partner with effective control of the club. In May 1993, Venables was sacked from the board after a dispute.[161] By 2000, Sugar began to consider selling the club,[162] and in February 2001, he sold the major part of his shareholding to ENIC International Ltd.[163] The majority shareholder, ENIC International Ltd, is an investment company established by the British billionaire Joe Lewis. Daniel Levy, Lewis's partner at ENIC, is Executive Chairman of the club. They first acquired 29.9% share of the club in 1991, of which 27% was bought from Sugar for £22 million.[163] Shareholding by ENIC increased over the decade through the purchase of the remaining 12% holding of Alan Sugar in 2007 for £25m,[164][165] and the 9.9% stake belonging to Stelios Haji-Ioannou through Hodram Inc. in 2009. On 21 August 2009 the club reported that they had issued a further 30 million shares to fund the initial development costs of the new stadium project, and that 27.8 million of these new shares had been purchased by ENIC.[166] The Annual Report for 2010 indicated that ENIC had acquired 76% of all Ordinary Shares and also held 97% of all convertible redeemable preference shares, equivalent to a holding of 85% of share capital.[167] The remaining shares are held by over 30,000 individuals.[168] Between 2001 and 2011 shares in Tottenham Hotspur F.C. were listed on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM index). Following an announcement at the 2011 AGM, in January 2012 Tottenham Hotspur confirmed that the club had delisted its shares from the stock market, taking it into private ownership.[169] Lewis' shares are owned by the Lewis Family Trusts. In October 2022, Lewis ceased to be a person with significant control of the club, following a reorganisation of the Trusts. The club continues to be owned by Levy and the Lewis trusts and, in the summer of 2022, ENIC intended to inject up to £150 million into the club by the issuing of new shares.[170][171] Only £100 million of shares were subscribed for and this took ENIC's shareholding up to 86.58%.[172] Tottenham has a large fan base in the United Kingdom, drawn largely from North London and the Home counties. The attendance figures for its home matches, however, have fluctuated over the years. Five times between 1950 and 1962, Tottenham had the highest average attendance in England.[173][174] Tottenham was 9th in average attendances for the 2008–09 Premier League season, and 11th for all Premier League seasons.[175] In the 2017–18 season when Tottenham used Wembley as its home ground, it had the second-highest attendance in the Premier League.[176][177] It also holds the record for attendance in the Premier League, with 83,222 attending the North London derby on 10 February 2018.[178] Historical supporters of the club have included such figures as philosopher A. J. Ayer.[179][180] There are many official supporters' clubs located around the world,[181] while an independent supporters club, the Tottenham Hotspur Supporters' Trust, is officially recognised by the club as the representative body for Spurs supporters.[182][183] Historically, the club had a significant Jewish following from the Jewish communities in east and north London, with around a third of its supporters estimated to be Jewish in the 1930s.[184] Due to this early support, all three chairmen of the club since 1984 have been Jewish businessmen with prior history of supporting the club.[184] The club no longer has a greater Jewish contingent among its fans than other major London clubs (Jewish supporters are estimated to form at most 5% of its fanbase), though it is nevertheless still identified as a Jewish club by rival fans.[185] Antisemitic chants directed at the club and its supporters by rival fans have been heard since the 1960s, with words such as \"Yids\" or \"Yiddos\" used against Tottenham supporters.[184][186][187] In response to the abusive chants, Tottenham supporters, Jewish and non-Jewish alike, began to chant back the insults and adopt the \"Yids\" or \"Yid Army\" identity starting from around the late 1970s or early 1980s.[188] Some fans view adopting \"Yid\" as a badge of pride, helping defuse its power as an insult.[189] The use of \"Yid\" as a self-identification, however, has been controversial; some argued that the word is offensive and its use by Spurs fans \"legitimis[es] references to Jews in football\",[190] and that such racist abuse should be stamped out in football.[191] Both the World Jewish Congress and the Board of Deputies of British Jews have denounced the use of the word by fans.[192] Others, such as former Prime Minister David Cameron, argued that its use by the Spurs fans is not motivated by hate as it is not used pejoratively, and therefore cannot be considered hate speech.[193] Attempts to prosecute Tottenham fans who chanted the words have failed, as the Crown Prosecution Service considered that the words as used by Tottenham fans could not be judged legally \"threatening, abusive or insulting\".[194] There are a number of songs associated with the club and frequently sung by Spurs fans, such as \"Glory Glory Tottenham Hotspur\". The song originated in 1961 after Spurs completed the Double in 1960–61, and the club entered the European Cup for the first time. Their first opponents were Górnik Zabrze, the Polish champions, and after a hard-fought match Spurs suffered a 4–2 reverse. Tottenham's tough tackling prompted the Polish press to write that \"they were no angels\". These comments incensed a group of three fans and for the return match at White Hart Lane they dressed as angels wearing white sheets fashioned into togas, sandals, false beards and carrying placards bearing biblical-type slogans. The angels were allowed on the perimeter of the pitch and their fervour whipped up the home fans who responded with a rendition of \"Glory Glory Hallelujah\", which is still sung on terraces at White Hart Lane and other football grounds.[195] The Lilywhites also responded to the atmosphere to win the tie 8–1. Then manager of Spurs, Bill Nicholson, wrote in his autobiography: A new sound was heard in English football in the 1961–62 season. It was the hymn Glory, Glory Hallelujah being sung by 60,000 fans at White Hart Lane in our European Cup matches. I don't know how it started or who started it, but it took over the ground like a religious feeling. There had been a number of incidents of hooliganism involving Spurs fans, particularly in the 1970s and 1980s. Significant events include the rioting by Spurs fans in Rotterdam at the 1974 UEFA Cup Final against Feyenoord, and again during the 1983–84 UEFA Cup matches against Feyenoord in Rotterdam and Anderlecht in Brussels.[197] Although fan violence has since abated, the occasional incidence of hooliganism continues to be reported.[198][199] Tottenham supporters have rivalries with several clubs, mainly within the London area. The fiercest of these is with north London rivals Arsenal. The rivalry began in 1913 when Arsenal moved from the Manor Ground, Plumstead to Arsenal Stadium, Highbury, and this rivalry intensified in 1919 when Arsenal were unexpectedly promoted to the First Division, taking a place that Tottenham believed should have been theirs.[200] Tottenham also share notable rivalries with fellow London clubs Chelsea and West Ham United.[201] The rivalry with Chelsea is secondary in importance to the one with Arsenal[201] and began when Tottenham beat Chelsea in the 1967 FA Cup Final, the first ever all-London final.[202] West Ham fans view Tottenham as a bitter rival, although the animosity is not reciprocated to the same extent by Tottenham fans.[203] The club through its Community Programme has, since 2006, been working with Haringey Council and the Metropolitan Housing Trust and the local community on developing sports facilities and social programmes which have also been financially supported by Barclays Spaces for Sport and the Football Foundation.[204][205] The Tottenham Hotspur Foundation received high-level political support from the prime minister when it was launched at 10 Downing Street in February 2007.[206] In March 2007 the club announced a partnership with the charity SOS Children's Villages UK, whereby player fines would go towards this charity's children's village in Rustenburg, South Africa to support of a variety of community development projects in and around Rustenburg.[207] In the financial year 2006–07, Tottenham topped a league of Premier League charitable donations when viewed both in overall terms[208] and as a percentage of turnover by giving £4,545,889, including a one-off contribution of £4.5 million over four years, to set up the Tottenham Hotspur Foundation.[209] In contrast, they have successfully sought the reduction of section 106 planning obligations connected to the redevelopment of the stadium in the Northumberland Development Project. Initially the development would incorporate 50% affordable housing, but this requirement was later waived, and a payment of £16m for community infrastructure was reduced to £0.5m.[210] This is controversial in an area which has suffered high levels of deprivation as Spurs had bought up properties for redevelopment, removing existing jobs and businesses for property development but not creating enough new jobs for the area.[211] The club however argued that the project, when completed, would support 3,500 jobs and inject an estimated £293 million into the local economy annually,[212] and that it would serve as the catalyst for a wider 20-year regeneration programme for the Tottenham area.[213][214] In other developments in Tottenham, the club has built 256 affordable homes and a 400-pupil primary school.[215][216] As part of the development of Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, the club built an elite educational facility to sit alongside its club offices.[217] The London Academy of Excellence Tottenham (LAET) is a state-funded Sixth Form, sponsored by the Club and Highgate School - the principle academic sponsors who deliver expert teaching.[218] LAET was named the Sunday Times Sixth Form College of the Year, 2020 by Parent Power, The Sunday Times School Guide.[219] In 2022, LAET achieved an 'Outstanding' Ofsted rating across all areas.[220] Spurs are one of the high-profile participants in the 10:10 project, which they joined in 2009. In a year, the carbon emissions were reduced by 14%, an estimated 400 tonnes of carbon.[221] The club further said it is dedicated to minimising the environmental impact of its activities across all operations, setting targets to reduce its carbon emissions by 50% by 2030 and become net-zero by 2040.[222][223][224] In September 2021, the club partnered with Sky Sports to host the world's first net-zero carbon top-level football game.[225][226] The initiative won in the Sustainability category at the 2022 Football Business Awards.[227][228] In 2023, the club was ranked top in Premier League's Sustainability Rankings for fourth year running.[229] Sources: Tottenham Hotspur – History[230] Steve Perryman holds the appearance record for Spurs, having played 854 games for the club between 1969 and 1986, of which 655 were league matches.[232][233] Harry Kane holds the club goal scoring record with 280 goals scored. Tottenham's record league win is 9–0 against Bristol Rovers in the Second Division on 22 October 1977.[234][235] The club's record cup victory came on 3 February 1960 with a 13–2 win over Crewe Alexandra in the FA Cup.[236] Spurs' biggest top-flight victory came against Wigan Athletic on 22 November 2009, when they won 9–1 with Jermain Defoe scoring five goals.[235][237] The club's record defeat is an 8–0 loss to 1. FC Köln in the Intertoto Cup on 22 July 1995.[238] The record home attendance at White Hart Lane was 75,038 on 5 March 1938 in a cup tie against Sunderland.[239] The highest recorded home attendances were at their temporary home, Wembley Stadium, due to its higher capacity – 85,512 spectators were present on 2 November 2016 for the 2016–17 UEFA Champions League game against Bayer Leverkusen,[240] while 83,222 attended the North London derby against Arsenal on 10 February 2018 which is the highest attendance recorded for any Premier League game.[241] The club is ranked No. 21 by UEFA with a club coefficient of 80.0 points as of June 2023[update].[242] Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules. Players may hold more than one non-FIFA nationality. Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules. Players may hold more than one non-FIFA nationality. The following players are noted as \"greats\" for their contributions to the club or have been inducted into the club's Hall of Fame:[255][256][257] The most recent additions to the club's Hall of Fame are Steve Perryman and Jimmy Greaves on 20 April 2016.[258] Tottenham's women's team was founded in 1985 as Broxbourne Ladies. They started using the Tottenham Hotspur name for the 1991–92 season and played in the London and South East Women's Regional Football League (then fourth tier of the game). They won promotion after topping the league in 2007–08. In the 2016–17 season they won the FA Women's Premier League Southern Division and a subsequent playoff, gaining promotion to the FA Women's Super League 2.[260] On 1 May 2019 Tottenham Hotspur Ladies won promotion to the FA Women's Super League with a 1–1 draw at Aston Villa, which confirmed they would finish second in the Championship.[261] Tottenham Hotspur Ladies changed their name to Tottenham Hotspur Women in the 2019–20 season.[262] Tottenham Hotspur Women announced the signing of Cho So-hyun on 29 January 2021. With her Korean men's counterpart Son Heung-min already at the club it gave Spurs the rare distinction of having both the men's and women's Korean National Team captains at one club.[263] Tottenham Hotspur competed in Superleague Formula for three seasons from 2008 to 2010. Duncan Tappy was the main driver in the first season racing 10 times with 3 podium finishes. In 2010 Tottenham won the trophy with driver Craig Dolby.[264] Through its partnership with F1, the club has also introduced Go Karting.[265] Three track layouts are available, suiting everyone from beginners to elite karters.[266]",

                "content": "Tottenham (/ˈtɒtənəm/,[2][3] TOT-ən-əm, /tɒtnəm/, tot-nəm) is a town in north London, England, within the London Borough of Haringey. It is located in the ceremonial county of Greater London. Tottenham is centred 6 mi (10 km) north-northeast of Charing Cross,[4] bordering Edmonton to the north, Walthamstow, across the River Lea, to the east, and Stamford Hill to the south, with Wood Green and Harringay to the west. The area rapidly expanded in the late-19th century, becoming a working-class suburb of London following the advent of the railway and mass development of housing for the lower-middle and working classes. It has been home to the Premier League football club Tottenham Hotspur since 1882. The parish of Tottenham was granted urban district status in 1894 and municipal borough status in 1934. Following the Second World War, the area saw large-scale development of council housing, including tower blocks. Until 1965 Tottenham was in the historic county of Middlesex. In 1965, the borough of Tottenham merged with the municipal boroughs of Hornsey and Wood Green to form the London Borough of Haringey. Tottenham is renowned for its multicultural, ethnically diverse population. Following an influx of an Afro-Caribbean population during the Windrush era in the mid-20th century, it became one of the most ethnically diverse areas in Britain. It has more recently become home to an increased population from Africa, Asia, South America and Eastern Europe. At the 2011 census, the population of Tottenham was 129,237. Tottenham is believed to have been named after Tota, a farmer, whose hamlet was mentioned in the Domesday Book. 'Tota's hamlet', it is thought, developed into 'Tottenham'. The settlement was recorded in the Domesday Book as Toteham, in the ancient hundred of Edmonton.[5][6] It is not related to Tottenham Court Road in Central London, though the two names share a similar-sounding root.[7] There has been a settlement at Tottenham for over a thousand years. It grew up along the old Roman road, Ermine Street (some of which is part of the present A10 road), and between High Cross and Tottenham Hale, the present Monument Way. When the Domesday Book was compiled in 1086, about 70 families lived within the area of the manor, mostly labourers working for the Lord of the Manor. A humorous poem entitled the Tournament of Tottenham, written around 1400, describes a mock-battle between peasants vying for the reeve's daughter. The River Lea (or Lee) was the eastern boundary between the Municipal Boroughs of Tottenham and Walthamstow. It is the ancient boundary between Middlesex and Essex and also formed the western boundary of the Viking controlled Danelaw. Today it is the boundary between the London Boroughs of Haringey and Waltham Forest. A major tributary of the Lea, the River Moselle, also crosses the borough from west to east, and often caused serious flooding until it was mostly covered in the 19th century. From the Tudor period onwards, Tottenham became a popular recreation and leisure destination for wealthy Londoners. Henry VIII is known to have visited Bruce Castle[8] and also hunted in Tottenham Wood. A rural Tottenham also featured in Izaak Walton's book The Compleat Angler, published in 1653.[9] The area became noted for its large Quaker population[10] and its schools (including Rowland Hill[11] at Bruce Castle[12]). Tottenham remained a semi-rural and upper middle class area until the 1870s. In late 1870s, the Great Eastern Railway introduced special workman's trains and fares on its newly opened Enfield and Walthamstow branch lines. Tottenham's low-lying fields and market gardens were then rapidly transformed into cheap housing for the lower middle and working classes, who were able to commute cheaply to inner London. The workman's fare policy stimulated the relatively early development of the area into a London suburb. In 1894, Tottenham was made an urban district and on 27 September 1934 it became a municipal borough. As from 1 April 1965, the municipal borough formed part of the London Borough of Haringey together with Hornsey and Wood Green. An incident occurred on 23 January 1909, which was at the time known as the Tottenham Outrage.[13] Two armed robbers, Latvian Jews of Russian extraction, held up the wages clerk of rubber works in Chestnut Road. They made their getaway via Tottenham Marshes and fled across the Lea. On the opposite bank of the river, they hijacked a Walthamstow Corporation tramcar, hotly pursued by the police on another tram. The hijacked tram was stopped but the robbers continued their flight on foot. After firing their weapons and killing two people, Ralph Joscelyne, aged 10, and PC William Tyler, they were eventually cornered by the police and shot themselves rather than be captured. Fourteen other people were wounded during the chase. The incident later became the subject of a silent film.[14] During the Second World War Tottenham was one of the many targets of the German air offensive against Britain. Bombs fell in the borough (Elmar Road) during the first air raid on London on 24 August 1940. The borough also received V-1 (four incidents) and V-2 hits, the last of which occurred on 15 March 1945. Wartime shortages led to the creation of Tottenham Pudding, a mixture of household waste food which was converted into feeding stuff for pigs and poultry.[15] The \"pudding\" was named by Queen Mary on a visit to Tottenham Refuse Works. Production continued into the post-war period, its demise coinciding with the merging of the borough into the new London Borough of Haringey. The Broadwater Farm riot occurred around the Broadwater Farm Estate on 6 October 1985 following the death of Cynthia Jarrett. Jarrett was a resident of Tottenham who lived about one mile (two kilometres) from the estate, who died of heart failure during a police search of her home. The tension between local black youths and the largely white Metropolitan Police had been high due to a combination of local issues and the aftermath of riots in Brixton which had occurred in the previous week. The response of some of the black community in Tottenham and surrounding areas culminated in a riot beginning on Tottenham High Road and ending in Broadwater Farm Estate. One police officer, Keith Blakelock, was murdered; 58 policemen and 24 other people were injured in the fighting. Two of the policemen were injured by gunshots during the riot, the first time that firearms had been used in that type of confrontation.[16] The 2011 Tottenham riots were a series of riots precipitated by the fatal shooting of Mark Duggan, a 29-year-old man in Tottenham, by police officers on 4 August 2011.[17][18][19][clarification needed] Attacks were carried out on two police cars, a bus, a Post Office and several local shops from 8:00 pm onwards on 6 August 2011. Riot police vans attended the scene of disturbances on Tottenham High Road. Later in the evening, the riot spread, with an Aldi supermarket and a branch of Allied Carpets also destroyed by fire, and widespread looting in nearby Wood Green shopping centre and the retail park at Tottenham Hale. Several flats above shops on Tottenham High Road collapsed due to the fires. 26 shared ownership flats in the Union Point development above the Carpetright store – built in the landmark Cooperative department store building – were also destroyed by fire. The triggering event was when a group of over one hundred local Tottenham residents set out to undertake a protest march against the killing of Mark Duggan, who was shot by police officers assigned to Operation Trident earlier in the week. The crowd made up of Duggan's family and local community leaders, gathered outside Tottenham police station on 6 August 2011 to protest the failure of the police to provide family members with a formal notice of the killing.[20] The circumstances surrounding Duggan's death were not entirely clear at the time of the riot. On 17 August 2011, the Prince of Wales and his wife Duchess of Cornwall visited an emergency center to meet victims of the riots.[21] Tottenham is the biggest part of the parliamentary constituency of Tottenham. The constituency was created in 1885 when the first MP was Joseph Howard of the Conservative Party. The boundaries were redrawn in 1918, and Tottenham was divided into two separate constituencies: Tottenham North and Tottenham South. Since being reinstated in 1950, it has been predominantly represented by MPs from the Labour Party, with the exception of Alan Brown who defected to the Conservatives due to disagreement with the Labour Party's defence policy at the time. The current MP is David Lammy who won a by-election in 2000 following the death of Bernie Grant. Tottenham was at the center of a local administrative area from the medieval period until 1965. The administrative area developed from a parish in Middlesex into an Urban sanitary district in 1875, after a local board of health had been established in 1850. It was then divided in 1888 and Wood Green became a separate authority.[22] In 1894, Tottenham was reconstituted first as an urban district, based at Tottenham Town Hall, then as a municipal borough in 1934.[23] Under the Local Government Act 1963, it became part of the larger London Borough of Haringey. The Tottenham neighbourhood is now one of twenty neighbourhoods in Haringey. Its elevation is approximately 33 ft (10 m) above sea level. Because of Tottenham's long history as a borough, the Tottenham name is used by some to this day to describe the whole of the area formerly covered by the old borough, incorporating the N17 postcode area and part of N15.[24] However, there are differing views as to what constitutes the Tottenham neighbourhood in the present day. Many think of Tottenham today as most of the area covered by the N17 post code, sometimes using the phrase 'Tottenham Proper' to describe it and to distinguish it from the other parts of the old borough.[25] A claim made by MP David Lammy in 2011, indicated that at that time Tottenham had the highest unemployment rate in London and the eighth highest in the United Kingdom, and it had some of the highest poverty rates within the country.[26] Tottenham has a multicultural population, with many ethnic groups inhabiting the area. It contains one of the largest and most significant populations of Afro-Caribbean people. These were among the earliest groups of immigrants to settle in the area, starting from the UK's Windrush era. The Seven Sisters ward has the largest proportion of Jewish residents among Haringey wards, at 18.1%.[27] In the 2011 UK Census, the ethnic composition of the Tottenham constituency, of which Tottenham is a large part, was as follows:[28] Tottenham has been one of the main hotspots for gangs and gun crime in the United Kingdom during the past three decades. This followed the rise of gangs and drug wars throughout the area, notably those involving the Tottenham Mandem gang and various gangs from Hackney and all of the areas surrounding Tottenham, and the emergence of an organised crime ring known as the Turkish mafia fought other London gangs to allegedly control more than 90% of the UK's heroin market.[29] In 1999, Tottenham was identified as one of the yardies' strongholds in London, along with Hackney, Harlesden, Peckham and Brixton.[30] The Victoria line passes through Tottenham, calling at Seven Sisters and Tottenham Hale. This connects Tottenham directly to Walthamstow, the West End and Brixton.[36] The line has its operating depot in the area at Northumberland Park.[36] The area is served by two train operating companies: Tottenham is well served by many London Bus routes, including: 41, 76, 123, 149, 192, 230, 243, 259, 279, 318, 341, 349, 476, W3 and W4[39] The area is connected to both London and National cycle networks, with provisions for recreational and commuter cycling across Tottenham. The River Lea towpath is a shared-use path maintained by the Canal and River Trust.[45] Cycling infrastructure in maintained primarily by Transport for London (TfL) and the London Borough of Haringey. Tottenham is the home of Premier League football club Tottenham Hotspur. From 1899 until 2017, the club's home ground was White Hart Lane. In 2017, White Hart Lane ground closed and demolition commenced to make way for a new stadium on the same site, known as the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, as part of a wider project for the redevelopment of the area. The new stadium was due to open in September 2018, but was delayed until later in the 2018–19 season. The stadium was opened on 3 April 2019. For the 2017–18 season and most of the 2018–19 season, the club played their home games at Wembley. Tottenham also has two non-League football clubs, Haringey Borough F.C. who currently play at Coles Park Stadium and Park View who play at the White Hart Lane Community Sports Centre. The Tottenham & Wood Green Independent is a local newspaper published by Newsquest.[46] Tottenham cake is a sponge cake baked in large metal trays, covered either in pink icing or jam (and occasionally decorated with shredded desiccated coconut). Tottenham cake's origins are unclear. There is reference to \"tottenham cakes\" as early as 1891 when the Far Famed Cake Company are credited as the originators of the confection. Singer Adele was born in Tottenham. [47] Another source states the cake \"was originally sold by the baker Henry Chalkley from 1901, who was a Friend (or Quaker), at the price of one old penny, with smaller mis-shaped pieces sold for half an old penny\". The pink colouring was derived from mulberries found growing at the Tottenham Friends burial ground.[48] Originally \"a peculiar local invention\"[49] of north London, the cake was later mass-produced by bakery chains such as Percy Ingle and Greggs.[50][51] The cake featured on The Great British Bake Off TV programme broadcast Tuesday 17 September 2013 on BBC2.[52]",

Meet the official four remaining candidates to bring home this season's illustrious college football award, the Heisman Trophy. MORE: A look at the full 12-team College Football Playoff bracket If there's a football player who's directly comparable to three-time MLB MVP Shohei Ohtani, it's Travis Hunter. The sport — at least in its current age — hasn't seen many players quite like him. A true two-way star, Hunter is simultaneously a top-tier wide receiver and elite-level cornerback, but no matter what side of the ball Hunter was playing on throughout 2024, he made his dominance look effortless. In each of Colorado's 12 games, fans watched him consistently make highlight-reel snags on passes from Shedeur Sanders, then take the field as a defensive player immediately after and shut down wideouts with unreal footwork and ball skills. Hunter is the real-life version of something you'd attempt to create in a video game: a player capable of wrecking a matchup on both sides of the ball. He helped lead Deion Sanders' Buffaloes to a 9-3 record this season, ranking sixth in college football in receiving yards while also finishing tied for eighth in passes defended. Ultimately, Colorado couldn't quite reach the College Football Playoff, but that was no fault of Hunter's. He blossomed into a superstar this season, putting on a show on a weekly basis. Soon, an NFL team will select the once-in-a-lifetime player with a high first-round pick. The question will be: Can Hunter bring his two-way talents with him to the next level? Heisman Moment Hunter knew his candidacy for the award was legit all season, hitting the Heisman pose whenever given the opportunity to do so. But the performance that locked in his status as a potential favorite for the award came in the final game of Colorado's regular season. Hunter put on a show against Oklahoma State, racking up 116 receiving yards and three touchdowns offensively and adding an interception and two passes defended defensively. The Buffaloes rolled to a 52-0 victory. TRAVIS HUNTER'S SECOND TD OF THE DAY 🔥 pic.twitter.com/imdU1l21aU After yet another dominant performance from Hunter to conclude the regular season, Coach Prime said he thought his two-way star clinched the Heisman Trophy. \"I think Travis clinched the Heisman with his performance. I think he made a lot of people aware of how ignorant they was with the Thorpe.\"Deion Sanders after Travis Hunter's big game today vs Oklahoma State ⬇️ pic.twitter.com/1AfrY8MCBk MORE: Which college football stars are skipping the 2024 bowl games? This season, Ashton Jeanty redefined what a dominant college running back looks like. He was virtually a walking automatic first down, averaging a staggering 7.3 yards per carry. Time and time again, Jeanty broke free into an opposing defense's secondary and sprinted to the end zone. Going back to the video game comparison with Hunter, Jeanty's what a 99 overall running back looks like in real life. His 2,497 rushing yards currently rank fourth all-time for a single season. All year, Jeanty was the centerpiece of a 12-1 Boise State squad, and he'll soon have an opportunity to shine on the bright stage of the College Football Playoffs. As soon as you laid eyes on the bright blue Boise State field in a highlight reel in 2024, it was sure to include another massive Jeanty run. Jeanty's combination of speed, power, agility, and vision made it look like defenders weren't even trying to tackle him at times, racking up touchdown after touchdown as the Broncos coasted to blowout victories. Simply put, Jeanty had one of the best individual seasons by a collegiate running back in history, and he has a chance to eclipse Barry Sanders' legendary single-season rushing record in Boise State's first playoff game. Heisman Moment Let's go all the way back to the start of the season. Jeanty totaled at least 127 — yes, 127 — rushing yards in all 13 of Boise State's matchups, but his season high came in the opener. Against Georgia Southern, Jeanty made his presence felt on a national level by racking up 267 rushing yards and six touchdowns on 13.4 yards per carry. The Broncos won the matchup 56-45.

But his explosion in production began with Game No. 1 of the Broncos' new campaign. MORE COLLEGE FOOTBALL PLAYOFF NEWS: After transferring from Oklahoma following the 2023 season, the lefty Gabriel entered a talented Oregon offense set to make some noise in the program's first season in the Big Ten. Just how much noise the Ducks wound up making, though, was surprising. Gabriel led Oregon to an unscathed 13-0 record, the only remaining undefeated team in FBS. Oregon most recently defeated Penn State for the Big Ten title, and the Ducks' quarterback, through his standout efficiency, arm talent, and mobility, has elevated his squad to a National Championship contender status. Oregon will soon enter the playoffs as the bracket's No. 1 seed. The Ducks' offense is full of game-changing speed, and all season, Gabriel maximized it through his standout passing and scrambling ability. As a sixth-year quarterback, he recently broke Case Keenum's record for the most total touchdowns (passing plus rushing) in NCAA history, now with 187. Heisman Moment Gabriel was consistently efficient and productive throughout 2024, but one of his best performances came last week when Oregon needed him most. In the Big Ten Championship, Gabriel racked up 283 yards and four touchdowns in the air, adding 17 rushing yards on the ground. Dillon Gabriel ➡️ Tez Johnson = Touchdown@Oregonfootball's offense just keeps on scoring ⚡️📺 CBS pic.twitter.com/OdzvW8Fk0Q His four passing touchdowns were a season high, and the Ducks' championship victory solidified their new dominance over the Big Ten. Cam Ward, who also entered 2024 as a transfer quarterback, joined Miami after two years at Washington State. Immediately, he became one of college football's star quarterbacks, eventually finishing second in passing yards, first in passing touchdowns, and tied for fourth in yards per attempt (9.5). The Hurricanes accumulated a 10-2 record this season, falling just short of the CFP after two late losses to Georgia Tech and Syracuse. However, Ward was putting up 300-plus-yard passing games left and right. Whether in the pocket or on the run, he consistently made long throws look easy. Like some of the other Heisman finalists, Ward will soon be a centerpiece addition for an NFL squad. His presence at quarterback made long plays an immediate threat, with the capability to change a game with one flick of his wrist. Ward will soon lead Miami to a matchup against Iowa State in the Pop-Tarts Bowl, another opportunity for him to put on a show. Heisman Moment One of the best representations of Ward's passing skills came in mid-October when Miami took on Louisville on the road. Ward led the Hurricanes to a 52-45 victory in a shootout, totaling 319 yards and four touchdown passes. Arguably his most impressive throw of the season came in the first quarter, as Ward scrambled to his left, then fired a deep pass right on target into the back of the end zone for a 27-yard score. CAM. WARD. 🤯🎯📺 ABC x @CanesFootball pic.twitter.com/JWNoshaORa Ward became one of the most talented quarterbacks across college football in 2024, and it's sure to make him one of the top selections in April's NFL Draft. Daniel Mader joined Sporting News as an editorial intern in 2024 following his graduation from Penn State University. Previously, he covered Penn State, high school and local sports beats for NBC Sports, the Centre Daily Times, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, The Daily Collegian and LancasterOnline.

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. The 2024 Heisman Trophy finalists were announced on Monday, and the list features some of the best and brightest players from what was a dramatic college football season. Colorado's Travis Hunter, Boise State's Ashton Jeanty, Oregon's Dillon Gabriel and Miami's Cameron Ward head to New York, where one will be crowned as the 79th Heisman Trophy winner at 8 p.m. ET on Saturday. Colorado two-way sensation Hunter and Boise State star running back Jeanty are considered the overwhelming favorites to win the award -- and have been over the course of the last few weeks -- after historic seasons for their respective teams. Either Hunter or Jeanty winning the most coveted individual award in college football would buck some recent trends. Jeanty would become the first running back to win the award since Derrick Henry in 2015, while Hunter is aiming to become the first full-time defender since Charles Woodson (1998) to win. Let's have a look now at the talented players who were announced as the 2024 Heisman Trophy finalists on Monday. Hunter is the heavy favorite to win the Heisman Trophy (-2500) and heads to New York after putting up perhaps the most successful all-purpose season since Jim Thorpe. The Colorado star played full time at both wide receiver and cornerback, and he finished top five nationally in receptions, receiving yards, receiving touchdowns, passes defended and No. 1 in PFF coverage grade. Hunter cleared 90 catches, 1,000 yards, 14 touchdowns and four interceptions and is a finalist for several other postseason awards on both offense and defense. Jeanty held +50000 Heisman odds heading into the season as a Group of Five running back, but he managed to burst his way onto the national stage thanks to a truly historic season. The junior from Frisco, Texas, has rushed for 2,497 yards and 29 touchdowns and is on track to break Barry Sanders' all-time rushing record. More importantly, his efforts helped Boise State earn a first-round bye in the College Football Playoff. He posted six 200-yard rushing games and clears every other running back in the nation by more than 800 yards. Ward is one of the great stories in college football. He earned a single offer from FCS Incarnate Word out of high school but played his way up to being perhaps the best quarterback in college football. He finished No. 1 in passing touchdowns (36), No. 2 in passing yards (4,123) and total offense (4,319) and No. 3 in yards per attempt (9.5). He captained a Miami offense that led the nation and finished only two spots out of the College Football Playoff. Gabriel transferred from Oklahoma to Oregon over the offseason and helped power the Ducks to the overwhelming No. 1 seed in the CFP bracket and Big Ten championship. The Mililani, Hawaii, native threw for 3,558 yards and scored 35 total touchdowns for the Ducks as Oregon reached a perfect 13-0 record. In a historic win over then-No.2 Ohio State, Gabriel exploded for 341 yards passing and three total touchdowns in a game that ultimately shaped the Big Ten race. He has been a consummate field general for the best team in the country. = © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. CBS Sports is a registered trademark of CBS Broadcasting Inc.

                "content": "(AP) - Oregon’s Dillon Gabriel, Colorado’s Travis Hunter, Boise State’s Ashton Jeanty and Miami’s Cam Ward were announced as the Heisman Trophy finalists on Monday night. The Heisman has been given to the nation’s most outstanding college football player since 1935. This year’s winner will be announced Saturday in New York. The top four vote-getters determined by more than 900 voters are selected as finalists. The voting panel includes members of the media and former Heisman winners. A look, in alphabetical order, at each of the finalist’s road to Manhattan. Gabriel, who transferred from Oklahoma in the offseason, led unbeaten and top-ranked Oregon to the Big Ten championship in its first year in the league and the No. 1 seed in the College Football Playoff. Gabriel averages 274 yards passing per game and has thrown for 28 touchdowns with six interceptions. His 73.2% completion rate is second in the nation. His 35 total touchdowns are tied for seventh nationally, and his career total of 187 is the highest in NCAA history. He set the all-time Football Bowl Subdivision record for career quarterback starts with his 62nd in the Big Ten title game. Hunter, will go down as one of the great two-way players in history. His accomplishments harken those of Charles Woodson, the Michigan cornerback who in 1997 became the first Heisman winner who primarily played defense. Woodson also spent time at receiver, but Hunter’s offensive production dwarfs his. Hunter was named All-Big 12 first-team receiver and earned honorable mention for offensive player of the year. He leads the Big 12 with 92 receptions and 14 receiving touchdowns and is second with 1,152 yards. His 21 receiving plays of 20-plus yards lead the nation. He also is Big 12 defensive player of the year and a unanimous first-team defensive back after recording 31 tackles, tying for the Big 12 lead with 11 pass breakups and tying for second with four interceptions. The junior running back has had one of the most productive seasons in college football history. His 2,497 yards rushing are the fourth-highest single-season total in the FBS, and his 192.1 yards per game lead the nation and are 58 more than the next highest average. Jeanty has rushed for at least 125 yards in 13 straight games. Jeanty has gone over 200 yards in his last two games and a total of six times this season. He averages 7.26 yards per cary, and his 344 attempts are the most in the FBS in two seasons. He and Army’s Bryson Daily share the national lead with 29 rushing touchdowns. The Miami quarterback was named Associated Press offensive player of the year and newcomer of the year in the Atlantic Coast Conference on Monday. He leads the nation with a school-record 36 passing touchdowns and his 4,123 passing yards, 4,319 total yards, 343.6 passing yards per game and 41 total touchdowns rank second. Ward leads the nation’s highest-scoring offense (44.2 ypg). He became the first Miami quarterback to post seven straight 300-yard games, and he has 10 games with 300-plus yards and three or more TD passes. ___ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

                "content": "The 2024 Heisman Trophy race is down to four finalists. Oregon Ducks quarterback Dillon Gabriel, Colorado Buffaloes cornerback/wide receiver Travis Hunter, Boise State Broncos running back Ashton Jeanty and Miami Hurricanes quarterback Cam Ward were announced on Monday as the finalists for the Heisman, college football's most prestigious honor. This season's Heisman winner will be revealed at a ceremony in New York City on Saturday, Dec. 14. And it's widely expected that the award for the nation's most outstanding player will be given to Hunter, who was a two-way force for the Buffaloes. The junior tallied the fifth-most receptions in the nation (92), the sixth-most receiving yards (1,152) and the second-most receiving touchdowns (14). Hunter even made his presence felt when Colorado's offense wasn't on the field, with opposing offenses rarely testing him at the cornerback spot. He made four interceptions, 11 pass breakups and 32 tackles, along with a game-sealing forced fumble at the goal line in overtime of a September comeback win against Baylor. Hunter and the No. 23 Buffaloes went 9-3 for the program's first winning record in a full season since 2016. Jeanty was the nation's leading rusher by a sizable margin with 2,497 yards on 344 carries, good for a whopping 7.3-yard average. He also led all FBS running backs with 29 rushing touchdowns, adding 20 receptions for 116 yards and a score. The junior back powered the No. 9-ranked Broncos to a Mountain West championship and the No. 3 seed in the College Football Playoff, giving him a chance to break Barry Sanders' single-reason FBS rushing record of 2,628 yards that was set in 1988. Jeanty is looking to become the first Boise State player to ever win the Heisman and the first running back to do so since Derrick Henry in 2015. The last three Heisman Trophies have gone to quarterbacks, and there are two signal-callers up for this year's award. Following stints at Incarnate Word and Washington State, Ward racked up the second-most passing yards in the nation (4,123) and threw for the most touchdowns (36) in his first season with Miami. The senior, who also rushed for 196 yards and four scores, competed 67.7% of his 435 pass attempts and was picked off seven times as the No. 13 Hurricanes went 10-2. Gabriel, meanwhile, quarterbacked Oregon to a special debut season in the Big Ten after taking over the starting gig from 2023 Heisman finalist and NFL first-round pick Bo Nix. Similar to Ward, Gabriel spent time at UCF and Oklahoma before breaking out in his first season with Ducks, who captured the conference championship and No. 1 seed in the CFP with a perfect 13-0 record. Gabriel's 73.2 completion percentage on 406 passes ranked second in the FBS among quarterbacks with at least 200 attempts, trailing only Colorado's Shedeur Sanders. He threw for 3,558 yards, 28 touchdowns and six picks, adding 192 yards and seven scores on the ground.",

On Monday, the 2024 Heisman Trophy finalists were revealed, narrowing the race to four electrifying athletes: Oregon Ducksquarterback Dillon Gabriel, Colorado Buffaloes two-way standout Travis Hunter,Boise State Broncos running backAshton Jeanty, and Miami Hurricanes quarterback Cam Ward. These four players delivered unforgettable performances this season, cementing themselves as the best in the game. The prestigious Heisman Trophy, awarded annually to the most outstanding player in college football, will be presented on Saturday, Dec. 14, and all eyes are on Hunter, who many believe is the frontrunner. Colorado's Travis Hunter has captured the nation's imagination with his historic two-way play. As a receiver, Hunter ranked fifth in the nation with 92 receptions, piling up 1,152 yards and 14 touchdowns. On defense, opposing quarterbacks rarely dared to test him, but he still managed four interceptions, 11 pass breakups, and a game-changing forced fumble in overtime against Baylor. His impact helped lift the Buffaloes to a 9-3 record, their first winning season since 2016. Boise State's Ashton Jeanty was a revelation this season, leading the FBS in rushing with 2,497 yards and 29 touchdowns. His 7.3 yards-per-carry average speaks to his ability to break defenses wide open, and his 344 carries powered the Broncos to a Mountain West title and a spot in the College Football Playoff as the No. 3 seed. With a chance to break Barry Sanders' single-season rushing record, Jeanty could make history as the first Boise State player to win the Heisman. Dillon Gabriel led Oregon to a perfect 13-0 record, a Big Ten title, and the top seed in the playoff. His pinpoint accuracy (73.2% completion rate) and dual-threat ability (3,558 passing yards, 28 touchdowns, and seven rushing scores) made him the leader of the nation's most complete team. Miami's Cam Ward, meanwhile, lit up the stat sheet with 4,123 passing yards and 36 touchdowns, ranking second and first in the nation, respectively. After leading the Hurricanes to a 10-2 record, Ward's dynamic play put him firmly in the Heisman conversation. With four deserving finalists, the 2024 Heisman race promises to be one of the most competitive in years. While Hunter may be the favorite, Jeanty, Gabriel, and Ward have each carved their own legendary paths. © Unidad Editorial Información Deportiva, S.L.U. All rights reserved. Follow us",

                "content": "David Gene Parker (born June 9, 1951), nicknamed \"the Cobra\",[1] is an American former professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball as a right fielder from 1973 to 1991. A seven-time All-Star, Parker won two National League batting titles and was the 1978 National League Most Valuable Player. He was a member of two World Series championship teams, winning with the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1979 and the Oakland Athletics in 1989. Parker was the second professional athlete to earn an average of $1 million per year, having signed a five-year, $5 million contract in January 1979. Parker's career achievements include 2,712 hits, 339 home runs, 1,493 runs batted in and a lifetime batting average of .290. Parker was also known as a solid defensive outfielder during the first half of his career with a powerful arm, winning three straight Gold Gloves during his prime. From 1975 to 1979, he threw out 72 runners, including 26 in 1977. In 2025, Parker will be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.[2] Parker grew up in Cincinnati near Crosley Field, where he learned to play baseball on the stadium's parking lots. His father, Dick Parker, was a shipping clerk in a foundry.[3] Dave Parker attended Courter Tech High School. He has said his favorite sport was football, and he starred at tailback but injured a knee in a game during his senior year and gave up the game. Also a baseball star, one of his fondest memories is playing at Western Hills High School (alma mater of Pete Rose), where he hit a home run that landed on the roof of a Frisch's restaurant.[4] In 1973, as a member of the Pirates Triple–A minor league affiliate, the Charleston Charlies, legend has it that Parker hit a home run that landed on a coal car on a passing train and the ball was later picked up in Columbus, Ohio.[5] However, in a 1975 interview, Parker stated, \"When I played for Charleston I always had the ambition to hit a home run onto a moving train. I really used to shoot for that. I hit a few on the tracks, but never as a train was going by.\"[6] He began his major league career on July 12, 1973, with the Pittsburgh Pirates, for whom he played from 1973 to 1983. His first full season came in 1975, when he led the National League in slugging percentage (.541) and finished third in NL MVP voting. In 1977, he was National League batting champion, a feat he repeated in 1978 when he was named the National League MVP. This was in spite of a collision at home plate with John Stearns during a game against the Mets on June 30, 1978, in which Parker fractured his jaw and cheekbone; he wore a specially constructed facemask in order to minimize his time away from the lineup.[7] The Pirates rewarded him with baseball's first million-dollar-per-year contract.[8][9] The following year, he was an instrumental part of the Pirates' World Series championship team.[10] During a game in 1979, a powerful hit he made to right field was very difficult to throw into the infield, because he had \"knocked the cover off the ball.\" One of the seams on the ball ruptured, making nearly half of the cover come loose.[11] Pirate fans angered by his million-dollar contract threw \"nuts and bolts and bullets and batteries\" at him, as pitcher Kent Tekulve stated. A typo in a news story made it appear they threw car batteries.[12] In 1981 at a point in his career when it looked as if he would one day rank among the game's all-time greats, Lawrence Ritter and Donald Honig included him in their book The 100 Greatest Baseball Players of All Time.[13] The authors, noting that Parker had succeeded Roberto Clemente at the position, wrote, \"Someone must have a fondness for right field in Pittsburgh.\" Parker took after his Pirates teammate Willie Stargell in warming up in the on-deck circle with a sledgehammer (when most batters would use a simple lead-weighted bat).[14] In the early 1980s, however, Parker's hitting suffered due to injuries, weight problems and his increasing cocaine use.[15] He became one of the central figures in a drug scandal that spread through the major leagues. At the end of the 1983 season, Parker became a free agent and signed with the Cincinnati Reds. In Cincinnati, his hometown, he returned to the form that made him an All-Star in Pittsburgh.[12] In 1985, he enjoyed his best season since he won the 1978 MVP with a .312 batting average and 34 home runs; he also led the National League with 125 RBIs, 42 doubles, 80 extra-base hits and 350 total bases. Parker finished second in 1985 MVP voting to Willie McGee. Parker was also the winner of the league's first-ever Home Run Derby in 1985. Following the season, Parker was among several players who testified against a dealer in the Pittsburgh drug trials. Named as \"regular users\", Parker and six other players were suspended for the following season. The sentences were commuted, however, in exchange for donating ten percent of their base salaries to drug-related community service, submitting to random drug testing, and contributing 100 hours of drug-related community service.[16][17] After the 1987 season, Cincinnati traded Parker to the Oakland Athletics for José Rijo and Tim Birtsas. In Oakland, Parker was able to extend his career by spending most of his time as a designated hitter. Although injuries and age caught up to him to a degree – he hit just .257 with 12 homers in 377 at-bats in 1988 and .264 with 22 homers in 553 at-bats in 1989 – his veteran leadership was a significant factor in the A's consecutive World Series appearances which included another World Series title for Parker 1989, exactly 10 years after his first one with the Pirates in '79. Parker signed with the Milwaukee Brewers for the 1990 season and had a solid year as the Brewers' DH with a .289 average and 21 home runs in 610 at-bats. He was even selected as a reserve for the 1990 All-Star Game. Milwaukee opted for youth however, at the end of the year and traded the aging Parker to the Angels for Dante Bichette. Parker's last season was 1991. He played for the California Angels until late in the season before being released. The Toronto Blue Jays then signed him as insurance for the pennant race, and Parker hit .333 in limited action. Since he was acquired too late in the season, he did not qualify for inclusion on the post-season roster and was unable to play in the American League Championship Series against the Minnesota Twins, which the Blue Jays lost in five games. Parker retired at end of the season. Source:[1][2] In 30 postseason games, Parker batted .234 (26-for-111) with 11 runs, 5 doubles, 3 home runs, 11 RBI and 7 walks. Parker has served as a first-base coach for the Anaheim Angels, a batting coach for the St. Louis Cardinals in 1998, and a special hitting instructor for Pittsburgh. He owned several Popeyes Chicken franchises in Cincinnati[18] until selling his interest in them in 2012 after 25 years.[19] Parker never got more than 24% of votes on Baseball Hall of Fame ballots, and his 15-year Baseball Writers' Association of America eligibility was exhausted on the 2011 ballot. Supporters of Parker's candidacy argue that his involvement with the Pittsburgh drug trials has contributed to his not being voted into the Hall of Fame, which may have also harmed the candidacies of Keith Hernandez (who never received more than 10.8% and fell off the writers' ballot on his ninth try) and Tim Raines (debuted at 24.3%, but was elected on his tenth year on the ballot), serving as a precursor to those listed on the Mitchell Report not being voted into the Hall of Fame due to steroid abuse.[20][21] Parker appeared on the Classic Baseball Era Committee's 2025 ballot and was elected with 87.5% of the vote on December 8, 2024. He will be formally inducted on July 27, 2025.[22][2] Parker has had both of his knees replaced due to injuries from his playing career.[23] In 2013, he confirmed to the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review that he had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease.[24] He is involved in raising money to find a cure for Parkinson's disease through the Dave Parker 39 Foundation.[25] Parker has six children. He currently resides in Loveland, Ohio, near Cincinnati, with his wife, Kellye.[4][19] Parker was elected to the Reds Hall of Fame Class of 2014, which also included fellow Cincinnati natives Ron Oester and Ken Griffey Jr.[26] In 2012, he was inducted into the Cincinnati Public Schools Athletic Hall of Fame.[4] On September 3, 2022, he was inducted into the Pittsburgh Pirates Hall of Fame as part of its inaugural class.",

He played college basketball for the Florida State Seminoles, earning third-team all-conference honors in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) as a freshman in 2021 and was selected with the fourth overall pick by the Raptors in the 2021 NBA draft. Barnes was named the NBA Rookie of the Year in 2022. In 2024, Barnes was named to the 2024 NBA All-Star Game, which was his first All-Star appearance.
