                "content": "The Army Black Knights football team, historically known as the Army Cadets, represents the United States Military Academy in college football. The Black Knights team competes in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) as a member of the American Athletic Conference. The Black Knights play home games in Michie Stadium with a capacity of 36,000 at West Point, New York. The Black Knights are coached by Jeff Monken, who has held the position since 2014. Army claims five national championships, including two AP Trophies in 1944 and 1945.[1] Army has produced 24 players and four coaches in the College Football Hall of Fame, 37 consensus All-Americans, and three Heisman Trophy winners: Doc Blanchard (1945), Glenn Davis (1946), and Pete Dawkins (1958).[3] With the exception of seven seasons (1998–2004) when the team was a member of Conference USA, Army competed as an independent, meaning that they had no affiliation with any conference. They started to compete in the American Athletic Conference as a football-only member in 2024. For all other sports Army is primarily a member of the Patriot League. Army competes with their historic rivals Navy in the Army–Navy Game, traditionally the final game of the college football regular season. The three major service academies—Army, Navy, and Air Force—compete for the Commander-in-Chief's Trophy; Army has won the award ten times, most recently in 2023. Army's football program began on November 29, 1890, when Navy challenged the cadets to a game of the relatively new sport. Navy defeated Army at West Point that year, but Army avenged the loss in Annapolis the following year.[4] The academies still clash every December in what is traditionally the last regular-season Division I college-football game. Army's football team reached its pinnacle of success during the Second World War under coach Earl Blaik when Army won three consecutive national championships in 1944, 1945 and 1946, and produced two Heisman trophy winners: Doc Blanchard (1945), Glenn Davis (1946). From 1944 to 1950, the Cadets had 57 wins, 3 losses and 4 ties. During this time span, Army won three national championships.[5] Army produced a third Heisman trophy winner in 1958 when Pete Dawkins took the honors.[6] Past NFL coaches Vince Lombardi[7] and Bill Parcells[8] were Army assistant coaches early in their careers. The football team plays its home games at Michie Stadium, where the playing field is named after Earl Blaik. Cadets' attendance is mandatory at football games and the Corps stands for the duration of the game. At all home games, one of the four regiments marches onto the field in formation before the team takes the field and leads the crowd in traditional Army cheers. Two of the regiments are tasked with performing the morning parade while the last regiment is tasked with ancillary stadium duties.[9] For many years, Army teams were known as the \"Cadets.\" In the 1940s, several papers called the football team \"the Black Knights of the Hudson.\" From then on, \"Cadets\" and \"Black Knights\" were used interchangeably until 1999, when the team was officially nicknamed the Black Knights. Individual cadets as well as groups of cadets to include the entire team are still often referred to as \"Cadet\" or \"The Cadets\" with regard to athletic events. Between the 1998 and 2004 seasons, Army's football program was a member of Conference USA, but starting with the 2005 season Army reverted to its former independent status.[10] Army competes with Navy and Air Force for the Commander-in-Chief's Trophy. In 2024, Army began competing in the American Athletic Conference. While Air Force competes in a separate conference, Navy also competes in the AAC. The regular season matchup between Army and Navy is competed as a non-conference matchup after the conference championship game and therefore does not affect conference standings. Army has won five national championships from NCAA-designated major selectors, including twice (1944, 1945) from the AP Poll.[11]: 108–115 [1] The Lambert-Meadowlands Trophy (known as the Lambert Trophy), established in 1936, is an annual award given to the best team in the East in Division I FBS (formerly I-A) college football and is presented by the Metropolitan New York Football Writers. Army has won the Lambert Trophy nine times; seven times under head coach Earl \"Red\" Blaik in the 1940s and 1950s, and twice under head coach Jeff Monken in 2018 and 2020.[12][13] Army has played in ten bowl games. They have a record of 7–3. [[2024 The NCAA's football oversight committee determined the number of primary bowl tie-ins for each FBS conference and FBS independent for the 2020–2025 bowl cycle using eligibility data from the 2014–2017 seasons.[14] The Black Knights received one guaranteed tie-in per year. On October 24, 2019, the West Point Athletic Department announced that they had agreed to a contract that placed their team, if eligible, in the Independence Bowl for three of the six years, with the remaining years being contracted to an ESPN Events-owned bowl.[15][16] The contract includes a clause that allows Army the ability to accept a bid from a different bowl game once during the three-year agreement with the Independence Bowl and once during the three-year agreement with ESPN Events. Aligning with this, on November 5 Army announced that it had agreed to a secondary contractual tie-in with the Duke's Mayo Bowl.[17] It agreed that it would serve as the primary backup for the bowl and would have the opportunity to accept an invitation to the game twice during the six-year cycle. The Duke's Mayo Bowl's primary tie-ins for the 2020–2025 cycle are the ACC (all years), the SEC (odd years), and the Big Ten (even years); if any of those conferences were unable to place a team into the bowl during any of those years, Army would be extended an invitation to fill their place. The opponent conferences for the Independence Bowl were announced to be the Pac-12 and the American on January 30, 2020.[18][19] The Duke's Mayo Bowl can extend an invitation to Army once during the even years (2020, 2022, 2026) and once during the odd years (2021, 2023, 2025) to fill a vacancy as part of a secondary tie-in. ESPN Events operates the following 16 bowls that Army could be invited to during odd years of the cycle: † Dennis Michie coached 1 game in 1890, and then coached a full season in 1892. Air Force, Army, and Navy have played each other every year since 1972 for the Commander-in Chief's Trophy. Air Force leads the FBS service academies with 21 victories, Navy has 16 victories, and Army has 10 victories, with the trophy being shared 5 times. Army is the current holder of the trophy. Air Force and Army meet annually and vie for the Commander-in-Chief's Trophy. Air Force leads Army 38–19–1 through the 2023 season.[20] In a shocking upset Army defeated Air Force on November 4, 2023, in Denver at Empower Field. Air Force was nationally ranked and undefeated going into the game. Army prevailed 23–3.[21] After the Navy–Notre Dame game was canceled in 2020, the Army–Air Force game became the longest uninterrupted intersectional rivalry in college football. Army and Navy play each other annually in the Army–Navy game, which is also a part of the Commander-in-Chief's Trophy. This series is one of the oldest and traditional rivalries in the NCAA. They first met in 1890, and have played each other annually since 1930. The games are generally played at a neutral site. Navy leads the series 62–55–7 through the 2023 season.[22] Notre Dame is a rivalry which some feel [according to whom?] has fallen into obscurity. In much of the early 20th century, Army and Notre Dame were considered football powerhouses, and met 34 times between 1913 and 1947. Though the rivalry has slowed down, they last met in 2024, with Notre Dame winning 49-14. Many media members considered the 1946 contest to be the \"Game of the Century\".[23] Notre Dame leads the series 39–8–4 through the 2018 season.[24] Michie Stadium, which opened in 1924, is the home stadium of the Army Black Knights in West Point, New York. The stadium is named after the first Army football head coach, Dennis Michie. In 1999, the field was renamed Blaik Field at Michie Stadium in honor of former coach Earl Blaik. In 1999, Sports Illustrated ranked Michie Stadium the third-best sports venue of the 20th century.[25] Songs Alma Mater is the Army's school song. Army's fight song is \"On, Brave Old Army Team\". Army also plays other organized cheers; Army Rocket Yell, Black, Gold, and Gray, and USMA Cheer.[26] Mascot Army's mascots are the Army Mules. While dating back to 1899, they were officially adopted as mascots by USMA in 1936.[27] The following 4 individuals have been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as coaches. The following 24 individuals have been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as players. Daly and McEwan also served as Army's head coach. President of the United States and General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower and General of the Army Omar Bradley were on the 1912 Army football team. Eisenhower was injured and his football career was over by 1913, when the two future generals were juniors. Bradley, a star of the Army baseball team for four years, was on the field in 1913 when Notre Dame upset Army in a historic college football game in which the forward pass was used for the first time. Bradley played end opposite the legendary Knute Rockne, the Notre Dame end who later coached the Irish to national championships before dying in a plane crash near Bazaar, Kansas, on Easter Friday in 1931. Schedules as of December 14, 2024.[39] Radio rights are held by Learfield through Army West Point Sports Properties, a joint venture with the USMA, and are branded on-air as the \"Army Sports Network from Learfield\".

                "content": "Colby Ray Covington[4] (born February 22, 1988)[5] is an American professional mixed martial artist. He currently competes in the Welterweight division of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), where he is a former Interim UFC Welterweight Champion.[6] As of October 8, 2024, he is #6 in the UFC welterweight rankings.[7] Covington was born in Clovis, California on February 22, 1988. The family moved from California to Oregon when he was eight years old.[8] His father was a wrestler during his time at the Oregon Institute of Technology and Southern Oregon University.[9] As a wrestler at Thurston High School in Springfield, Oregon, Covington lettered all four years and won the 171 lb state championship as a senior in 2006. He committed to Arizona State University but his test scores were not up to par, so he went to Iowa Central Community College, where he won the 2007 165 lb national junior college wrestling title as a true freshman with a 34–0 record.[10] His roommate at the time was future UFC champion Jon Jones.[11] Following his championship season at Iowa Central, Covington transferred to the wrestling program at the University of Iowa. On August 10, 2007, he was arrested for eluding police and driving under the influence, having registered a BAC of 0.255, over three times the legal limit of 0.08.[12] He later said, \"That was a real all-time low in my life, something I really wish I could take back.\" Due to his arrest, Covington was suspended from the Hawkeyes for a year and saw limited time the next season.[10] He looked for a fresh start, and former Hawkeyes coach Jim Zalesky convinced Covington to transfer to Oregon State University.[10][8] During his time at OSU, Covington qualified for the NCAA tournament as a junior and as a senior, placing fifth as a senior and earning All-American honors.[13] He also was a two-time Pac-10 Conference champion at 174-pounds. He was cited for fourth-degree assault stemming from an incident on May 23, 2010, in which he was accused of punching two men after a verbal altercation.[12] The Benton County District Attorney's Office did not pursue charges against Covington over the incident.[14] Covington graduated with a bachelor's degree in sociology in 2011.[15] After graduation, he continued to compete in wrestling and grappling, winning a gold medal at the 2013 FILA Grappling no-gi world championships.[16] After completing his collegiate wrestling career in 2011, Covington was one of a number of athletes recruited by Dan Lambert to American Top Team to improve the gym's wrestling talent.[17] Covington soon began his professional career and compiled a record of 5–0 before signing with the UFC in the summer of 2014.[18] Covington made his promotional debut against Anying Wang on August 23, 2014, at UFC Fight Night 48.[18] He won the fight by TKO via punches in the closing seconds of the first round.[19] Covington fought Wagner Silva on November 8, 2014, at UFC Fight Night 56.[20] He won the fight via submission in the third round.[21] Covington next faced Mike Pyle on May 23, 2015, at UFC 187, replacing an injured Sean Spencer.[22] He won the fight via unanimous decision.[23] Covington faced Warlley Alves on December 12, 2015, at UFC 194.[24] He lost the fight via submission in the first round.[25][26] Covington was expected to compete against Alex Garcia on June 18, 2016, at UFC Fight Night 89.[27] However, Garcia was pulled from the fight on June 10 for undisclosed reasons and replaced by promotional newcomer Jonathan Meunier.[28] Covington won the fight via submission in the third round.[29] Covington next faced promotional newcomer Max Griffin on August 20, 2016, at UFC 202.[30] He won the fight via TKO in the third round.[31] Covington's next bout was against Bryan Barberena on December 17, 2016, at UFC on Fox 22.[32] He won the fight via unanimous decision.[33] Covington faced Dong Hyun Kim on June 17, 2017, at UFC Fight Night 111.[34] He won the fight via unanimous decision.[35] As the final fight of his prevailing contract, Covington fought Demian Maia on October 28, 2017, at UFC Fight Night 119.[36][37] He won the fight via unanimous decision.[38] Covington fought Rafael dos Anjos on June 9, 2018, at UFC 225 for the Interim UFC Welterweight Championship.[39] He won the fight via unanimous decision.[40] Covington was briefly linked to a title unification bout with the then champion Tyron Woodley on September 8, 2018, at UFC 228.[41] However, Covington was unable to compete on that date due to recent nasal surgery. As a result, UFC officials turned their attention to arranging a bout between Woodley and Darren Till to fill the headlining spot. In turn, promotional officials indicated on July 24 that Covington would be stripped of the Interim UFC Welterweight Championship, once the bout between Woodley and Till took place.[42][43] Covington returned to face Robbie Lawler in the main event of UFC on ESPN 5 on August 3, 2019.[44] He won the fight via a lopsided unanimous decision, setting a record for the most strikes thrown in a UFC bout, with 541 strikes.[45][46] Covington faced Kamaru Usman for the UFC Welterweight Championship on December 14, 2019, at UFC 245.[47] Covington broke his jaw in the third round, and would be finished by technical knockout in the fifth round.[48][49] This fight earned him his first post–fight bonus in the UFC for Fight of the Night.[50] Going into the final round, one judge had Covington winning 39–37, another had it tied at 38–38, and the other had it 39–37 in favor of Usman.[51] After a long-lasting, public feud and trash talking between Covington and other American Top Team members – most notably Dustin Poirier, Jorge Masvidal and Joanna Jędrzejczyk – Covington eventually parted ways with his first mixed martial arts gym in May 2020.[2] Covington headlined UFC Fight Night 178 against his long-time rival Tyron Woodley on September 19, 2020.[52][53] After dominating his opponent for four rounds, the bout was called as a technical knockout when Woodley suffered a rib injury.[54][55] Covington rematched Kamaru Usman for the UFC Welterweight Championship on November 6, 2021, at UFC 268.[56] Despite a close bout, Covington lost via unanimous decision.[57] Covington faced Jorge Masvidal on March 5, 2022, at UFC 272.[58] He won the fight via unanimous decision in dominant fashion.[59] This fight earned him the Fight of the Night award.[60] After sitting out for nearly two years, Covington returned to face Leon Edwards for the UFC Welterweight Championship on December 16, 2023 in the main event at UFC 296.[61] Covington broke his foot in the first minute of the bout, and eventually lost via unanimous decision.[62] Covington stepped in as a replacement for Ian Machado Garry, to face Joaquin Buckley on December 14, 2024, at UFC on ESPN 63.[63] Covington lost the fight by technical knockout as a result of a doctor stoppage due to a cut above his eye in the third round.[64] As an NCAA Division I All-American[13] and a two-time Pac-10 champion as a collegiate wrestler, Covington heavily utilizes wrestling and grappling in mixed martial arts. He aims to take his opponents down and control them on the ground, where he looks for ground-and-pound as well as submissions. If unsuccessful on his initial take down attempt, he will chain it into further take down attempts, forcing his opponent to defend and tiring them out in the process. Covington is renowned for his cardio and is capable of maintaining an intense pace over five rounds.[65] While standing, Covington primarily fights out of a southpaw stance, and his striking arsenal features a variety of punches and kicks. He often purposely overextends on his punches to transition from striking to a takedown attempt. His stand-up game focuses on volume and forward pressure.[65] In his win over Robbie Lawler in 2019, Covington threw 541 strikes, which was a UFC record until surpassed by Max Holloway's 746 attempted strikes in his fight against Calvin Kattar in 2021.[66] Kano Jigoro → Tomita Tsunejiro → Mitsuyo Maeda → Carlos Gracie → Reyson Gracie → Osvaldo Alves → Daniel Valverde → Colby Covington[67][68][69] In August 2017, Covington began making appearances in Impact Wrestling (known at the time as Global Force Wrestling), representing American Top Team, where he got involved in the storyline with Lashley.[70] Throughout the month, Lashley was conflicted on whether he should combine his two careers together, or quit wrestling and focus on his MMA career; he would eventually side with ATT.[71][72][73] On August 17, at Destination X, some members of ATT were ringside to support Lashley for his match against Matt Sydal. Post-match, Covington attacked referee Brian Hebner with a rear-naked choke, which Lashley had to call off, before he and ATT left the arena.[74][75] On the August 24 episode of Impact! (taped August 17), they were again at ringside to support Lashley in a twenty-man gauntlet match for the GFW Impact World Heavyweight Championship, which was eventually won by Eli Drake.[76] On 5 November, at Bound for Glory, Covington appeared as a cornerman, as Lashley and King Mo defeated Moose and Stephan Bonnar in a six sides of steel match.[77] In the build-up to the event, he hired Stevie Richards to be his strength and conditioning coach.[78] The event marked Covington's final appearance with the stable. In February 2018 and in the midst of his feud with Tyron Woodley, Covington appeared at a WrestlePro event, in conjunction with Impact. His only professional wrestling match to date saw him squash an unidentified wrestler portraying a parody of Woodley, under the ring name TyQuill Woodley.[79] Covington is an outspoken supporter of the Republican Party and President-elect Donald Trump. After winning the Interim UFC Welterweight Championship, he stated he wanted to visit Trump at the White House to present him with the title,[80] which he did on August 2, 2018.[81] Trump phoned to congratulate Covington during his post-fight interview following his win over Tyron Woodley.[82] Covington dedicated his win over Woodley to first responders and the military and criticized Black Lives Matter and LeBron James.[83][84] Woodley had spoken about his support for the Black Lives Matter movement leading up to the fight.[85] He has described himself as the \"super villain\" of the UFC and will often try to upset people with brazen trash talking. Following his 2017 bout with Demian Maia at São Paulo, Brazil, he called the country a \"dump\" and referred to the Brazilian crowd as \"filthy animals\" in the post-fight interview.[86] In an interview with Candace Owens, Covington said that his \"act\" was a response to the UFC threatening to cut him before the Maia fight and stated the \"filthy animals\" speech \"saved his career.\"[87] Covington further embraced his villain status before his 2019 main event encounter with Robbie Lawler at UFC on ESPN 5. He used the WWE entrance theme of professional wrestler Kurt Angle—which is regularly punctuated with crowd chants of \"You suck!\"—as his entrance music; Angle had given Covington permission to use the theme. With two of Trump's sons, Donald Jr. and Eric cage-side for the fight,[88] the crowd performed the \"You suck!\" chants during Covington's entrance.[89] After his win over Lawler, Covington stated; \"Let's talk about the lesson we learned tonight that Robbie should have learned from his good buddy Matt Hughes. You stay off the tracks when the train is coming through, junior, doesn't matter if it's the Trump train or the Colby train, get out the way!\" during his post-fight interview. This was in reference to a near-fatal accident Hughes suffered in 2017, where he was permanently damaged when his truck was struck by a train at a rail crossing.[90][91] Despite being criticized by the media, Covington refused to apologize, explaining that \"the guy's done some pretty crappy stuff, he's got lawsuits against his family, against his brother, I just said the truth, I'm honest. I'm a little bit brutally honest sometimes and people can't handle it.\"[92] Covington continued his trash-talking in the lead up to the Kamaru Usman fight at UFC 245. During a press conference, he said that Usman gave Glenn Robinson, Usman's long-time coach who died in 2018, \"a heart attack from all those years you were ducking me,\" and that Robinson would be \"watching from hell on Dec. 14.\"[93] In March 2021, Covington created controversy by insinuating that he had a sexual relationship with fellow UFC fighter Polyana Viana and that this was part of the reason why he turned down a fight with Leon Edwards at UFC Fight Night: Edwards vs. Muhammad.[94] Viana herself had earlier claimed that she and Colby were \"just friends\" and that she already had a boyfriend when addressing rumors that the two of them were in a relationship.[95] After Covington's comments, Viana gave the following statement through her social media: \"I have never given room for any kind of comment or judgment about my personal life, but it is not for me to judge the person's attitude. I feel sorry for those who act so low to try to promote themselves. It is revolting.\"[96] In the pre-fight press conference for UFC 296, Covington stated in a heated back-and-forth with Leon Edwards: \"I'm gonna take you to the seventh layer of hell ... We'll say 'what's up' to your dad while we're there.\"[97] Edwards' father was murdered when he was 13.[98] He responded by throwing a bottle at Covington. Covington drew further backlash when he stated that he did not feel apologetic about his remarks towards Edwards' late father.[99] Dana White said during the post-fight press conference: \"It bothered everybody I think ... We're in the fight game, mean things are said, one of the things that I really don't like is family ... It's just such a nasty thing to do.\"[100] Covington's performance at UFC 296 also garnered additional criticism, with Dana White commenting that he looked \"old and slow.\"[100] Covington came under fire in September 2024 for putting rapper Lil Pump in a rear-naked chokehold for a live-streamed video, but not letting go for over 10 seconds after the rapper tapped out.[101] Lil Pump eventually passed out and went limp, only after which did Covington let go.[102] On March 22, 2022, it was reported that Covington was assaulted outside of a Miami Beach Papi Steak restaurant by UFC rival Jorge Masvidal, whom Covington had defeated in a lopsided decision previously at UFC 272 a few weeks prior. Covington allegedly suffered a broken tooth from two punches to the face. Masvidal was arrested and charged with aggravated battery, and criminal mischief.[103][104][105] On November 6, 2023, Masvidal pleaded no contest to misdemeanor battery in a plea deal that saw felony charges for aggravated battery and criminal mischief against him dropped.[106] [115] {{ |url= https://www.si.com/fannation/mma/ufc/ufc-news-colby-covington-x-rays-injury-leon-edwards-fight}}",

                "content": "It wasn’t that long ago that Colby Covington was wondering if he was going to wake up the day after a fight and be unemployed. Actually, it was a long time ago – over eight years – since the welterweight contender was winning, but not moving the needle, and thinking about his next move. Fast forward to December of 2024, and “Chaos” is the guy the UFC called to step in on short notice to meet Joaquin Buckley in Saturday’s UFC Fight Night main event in Tampa. If you’re keeping score at home, it’s his seventh consecutive headlining appearance. Saturday's Full Fight Card Preview You’ve come a long way, Mr. Covington. “It's very satisfying,” he said. “In this company, you eat what you kill. So they've given me this opportunity to headline this event and I'm the one that did the work. All these other fighters, they love to complain. ‘Oh, I feel bad for me, the UFC's not doing nothing to promote me.’ Dude, go out there and promote yourself. That's what I was able to do. I promoted myself, I marketed myself and I wasn't afraid to take the road less traveled. And I always tell everybody, it's not about making friends, it's about making money. And December 14th, I'm going to put on a great show for the fans. I'm going to sell out that arena. I'm going to show the company my worth, that I'm the ultimate company man, and that they can rely on me at any time. It doesn't matter if it's short notice or not.” RELATED: Tampa Main Event Spotlight The fight is short notice, but it’s been a long time since the 36-year-old has been in the Octagon. A year ago, almost to the day, Covington dropped a five-round decision to then-champion Leon Edwards in Las Vegas. It was a bitter defeat thanks to an early foot injury that kept him from testing the Brit, and instead of jumping right back into the fray, Covington dialed everything back, healed up and focused on life outside the Octagon. That included some campaign work for U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. “I was on the campaign trail as much as possible to just be a small little fraction of a help to the campaign in any way I could,” said Covington. “I wanted to volunteer my services because President Trump has done so much for me in my career that I could never repay him even if I worked the rest of my life for him.” He also got to eat a little bit while not having to worry about making the cut to 170 pounds. RELATED: Covington vs Buckley | UFC Journey “That's always nice, too, to eat and not have to cut weight,” Covington laughs. “That's always fun. It was a little bit more lax schedule and I got to enjoy life again. The biggest thing is when you're in training camps and you're just preparing fight to fight, you don't get to really enjoy the fruits of the labor and get to enjoy life. So it was fun to enjoy some downtime, but now I'm ready to get back to work. I'm ready to put this division on my back and I'm ready to come up and step up and save the day for the UFC.” For all the bluster, Covington is a fighter at heart, and you can hear it in his voice that he’s been waiting to punch somebody in the face for a while. Still, the call to step in and face Buckley came as a surprise when the St. Louis native saw his original foe – Ian Machado Garry – get moved to last weekend’s title eliminator with Shavkat Rakhmonov. “I was enjoying life,” said Covington. “I was literally in Dallas at an event, and they called and they needed a hero, someone to save the day, and I'm just that guy. I'm a guy that prides myself on staying ready at all times. I don't have to get ready, so they could call me on a day's notice. I'm coming out to fight for this company, the company that gave me everything that I have today. So I'm always prepared. I wasn't preparing strategically in a fight camp, but I am prepared and they're going to see the best Colby “Chaos” Covington on December 14th.” RELATED: Joaquin Buckley Interview Always be selling. Whether he says it or not, it’s been Covington’s way of life since his 2017 win over Demian Maia in Brazil. That approach – not to mention what he’s done inside the Octagon – has changed his life and career. Not surprisingly, it’s turned some folks off, but it’s also garnered him a legion that tunes in to watch him fight – whether it’s to see him win…or lose. Any regrets? “No regrets,” Covington said. “Because if I had regrets then I wouldn't be who I am. So, no regrets. Everything that's happened has happened for a reason and I truly believe this is God's plan for me.” It is funny how things have turned out, though. And after recently celebrating his 10th anniversary on the roster, Covington has already achieved the longevity in the promotion he didn’t know was a probability early in his UFC run. “Man, I think I'd be a liar if I truly said I'd be picturing that I'd be living this American dream,” he admits. “That was always my dream and I believed in myself, but I don't think I could ever imagine that I'd be this far and be with such a prestigious company, the number one fight organization on planet Earth. And just to be a part of this company for 10 years, it's been the greatest honor of my life and I’ve had such a fun ride. It's taken me all over the world as a kid. I just wanted to travel the world and compete, and that's what UFC's allowed me to do. I've been to every country, almost every continent. So it's been a dream come true and I'm so thankful. It's been the funnest ride of my life.” It’s not over yet. This weekend, it’s a short ride from Miami to Tampa for another fight, another main event. And if there are those wondering if Covington is still relevant after three title fight losses and a year away, consider that during the last 12 months, the big names in the welterweight division are still talking about him. Relevant? Oh yeah. “My last fight was a complete disappointment, breaking my foot in three places in the first 30 seconds,” said Covington. “So I want to show that I'm still the best welterweight on planet Earth.

                "title": "Tornado hits northern California town after San Francisco warning",
                "content": "At least four people were injured after a tornado struck northern California on Saturday afternoon, according to local authorities. The twister flipped over several cars and brought down power lines in Scotts Valley, located around 55 miles (89km) south of San Francisco, police said. The National Weather Service (NWS) said the tornado was categorised as an EF1, one of the weakest classifications, and that it lasted around five minutes. Earlier on Saturday, residents of San Francisco had been issued a tornado warning for the first time ever as thunderstorms swept through the region. In Scotts Valley, the tornado touched down at 13:39 local time (21:39 GMT) on Saturday, police said. The local fire service said at least four people had been injured and at least two of them had been taken to hospital, BBC's US partner CBS News reported. Police closed a road overnight to allow for repair work to be done and debris cleared. Wind speeds were estimated to have peaked at around 90mph (145km/h), the NWS said. The weather agency also said the twister had been around 30 yards (27m) wide and travelled for a quarter of a mile (400m) before subsiding. Earlier on Saturday, a tornado warning was issued to residents of San Francisco just before 06:00 local time (14:00 GMT). The warning was for parts of downtown San Francisco and northern San Mateo County. More than one million residents were woken in San Francisco and its suburbs to alerts on their mobile phones, warning them to \"take shelter now\". Winds of up to 60mph (96km/h) ripped through the area, the NWS said. But a few minutes later, NWS Bay Area said the warning was over and the storm had moved out of the city's downtown. The city last saw a tornado in 2005, though that struck without any clear radar signature, so no warning was issued in that case, NWS meteorologist Roger Glass told AP news agency. Nearby San Mateo County was last issued a tornado warning in 2011. The warning came after a powerful storm passed through overnight - trees were toppled and there were major power cuts. As of Sunday, more than 50,000 customers were still without power along the northern and central California coast, according to the PowerOutage website. NWS Bay Area warned that residents should steer clear of the seaside over the weekend, with a coastal flood advisory in place until Monday. San Francisco's tornado alert came just a week after the city saw its first ever tsunami warning. The brief advisory was issued for northern California and southern Oregon following a magnitude 7.0 earthquake that hit off the northern coast of the state. It was later rescinded, and no injuries were reported. There are reports of severe damage on the French Indian Ocean territory after it was struck by Cyclone Chido. Homeowners contact the BBC after insurers refuse storm claims because it was \"not windy enough\". The US government says the flying objects pose no threat to national security, but their origin and intentions remain unclear. The network will also publish a statement expressing \"regret\" for statements by George Stephanopoulos.

The National Weather Service in the San Francisco Bay Area did not find evidence of a tornado after a survey. The damage instead was consistent with straight line winds up to 80 mph “across the Richmond District and Golden Gate Park areas.” Although there was rotation on radar at the time to trigger the warning, the damage does not suggest a tornado touchdown. National Weather Service meteorologists document the severity and direction in which damage falls to make this determination. The San Francisco Department of Emergency Management had confirmed the tornado threat ended around 6:14 a.m. PST after the storm moved northeast of downtown. The National Weather Service had also issued a flood advisory and high wind warning, with sustained winds of up to 40 mph expected in areas along the coast. San Francisco Airport reported a wind gust of 72 knots (83 mph) at the time the storm passed by. Videos show extreme winds shaking palm trees in San Francisco and downed trees and power lines. The threat continued as more severe storms fired up through the afternoon. A tornado occurred just before 2 p.m. in Scotts Valley, California, roughly 67 miles south of San Francisco, according to the National Weather Service. “Based on video, photos, firsthand accounts, and radar signatures a tornado occurred ~1:40 PM,” the agency said. The Scotts Valley Police Department posted on its Facebook page asking drivers to avoid Mount Hermon Drive because multiple cars were thrown off the road near the Target store after the tornado passed through the area. “At this time, several individuals have been transported to nearby trauma centers for evaluation and treatment,” the Scotts Valley Police Department said in a release. “While injuries have been reported, there have been no fatalities at this time. Emergency medical teams are prioritizing those most in need of care, and we continue to monitor the situation closely,” the agency added.

One week prior, a tsunami warning was issued for the San Francisco Bay area and nearly 5 million people along parts of the Northern California and Oregon coastlines after a 7.0-magnitude earthquake struck off the California coast on December 5. A quake that strong is relatively rare, with officials reporting only about 15 around the world each year.

        "Saturday Night Main Event": [
            {
                "title": "Saturday Night's Main Event - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Saturday Night's Main Event is a series of American professional wrestling television specials produced by WWE (originally the World Wrestling Federation or WWF). It was originally broadcast by NBC from 1985 to 1992, replacing Saturday Night Live in its late night timeslot on an occasional basis throughout the year. At a time when weekly wrestling programs typically consisted primarily of squash matches featuring established stars dominating enhancement talent, Saturday Night's Main Event consisted almost entirely of star vs. star matches rarely seen on television, including title defenses and specialty matches. It coincided with and contributed to the apogee of the \"second golden age\" of professional wrestling in the United States; bolstered by regular in-ring appearances by WWF stars such as Hulk Hogan, Saturday Night's Main Event drew large audiences for much of its run, while a spin-off simply titled The Main Event aired annually on a Friday night in February beginning in 1988. Ratings began to fall in the 1990s, leading to NBC dropping the specials in 1991. In 1992, the WWF moved Saturday Night's Main Event to Fox, which aired two editions of the special on the network before being discontinued. In 2006, Saturday Night's Main Event was briefly revived as a series of prime time specials on NBC, as part of WWE's agreement with NBC Universal to air its weekly program Raw on USA Network. Five episodes aired as part of the revived run before it was discontinued in 2008. In April 2022, WWE repurposed the Saturday Night's Main Event title for house shows held on Saturday nights.[1] In September 2024, as part of an agreement moving WWE SmackDown from Fox to USA, WWE announced that it would revive Saturday Night's Main Event, airing on NBC and streaming on Peacock. Saturday Night's Main Event debuted on May 11, 1985, in the late-night time slot normally assigned to reruns of the NBC sketch comedy Saturday Night Live. Then-SNL executive producer Dick Ebersol had made a deal with WWF owner Vince McMahon to produce the show, after Ebersol had seen the high ratings that two WWF specials drew on MTV in 1984–85: The Brawl to End It All and The War to Settle the Score.[2] Although the show aired infrequently, it did, starting in 1986, settle into a predictable pattern of airdates: New Year's weekend, an episode in late February/early March, an episode in late April/early May, an episode in late September/early October, and Thanksgiving weekend. 1989 and 1990 both offered episodes in July promoted as \"Summertime Bonus Editions\", some of the Superstars would come on The Arsenio Hall Show interviewed by Arsenio Hall himself to build up/hype of the event. Saturday Night's Main Event was a tremendous rating success for NBC during its heyday, most notably on the March 14, 1987, show, which drew an 11.6 rating, which to this day remains the highest rating any show has ever done in that time slot. That show was headlined by a battle royal involving Hulk Hogan and André the Giant, who were slated to face each other at WrestleMania III. As Hogan rarely wrestled on the WWF syndicated and cable television shows, Saturday Night's Main Event was the program on free television where most viewers were able to see him in action. The success of Saturday Night's Main Event led to several Friday night prime time specials, known as The Main Event. The first of these, on February 5, 1988, included a WrestleMania III rematch between Hogan and André and drew 33 million viewers and a 15.2 rating, which is still the highest-rated television show in American professional wrestling history. While ratings remained strong through 1990, they began to fall shortly thereafter. NBC, who had just acquired the rights to broadcast NBA games nationwide, now started to lose interest in wrestling, and Saturday Night's Main Event was dropped. Its final NBC airing occurred on April 27, 1991. Fox picked up the show in 1992, but it was only shown twice on Fox; on February 8, 1992, and the final Saturday Night's Main Event of the original run was broadcast on November 14, 1992. For much of its history, Saturday Night's Main Event was hosted by McMahon and Jesse \"The Body\" Ventura with the occasional use of Bobby Heenan in 1986 and 1987. In 1990, Roddy Piper replaced Ventura as McMahon's broadcast partner when Ventura left the WWF. On the two episodes that aired on Fox, Heenan served as McMahon's partner. From 1985 to 1988, the opening theme song for the NBC version was \"Obsession\" by Animotion with the closing theme being \"Take Me Home\" by Phil Collins, and also the beginning of \"Take On Me\" by a-ha was used for show bumpers. Steve Winwood's \"Higher Love\" was also used as a closing theme. Starting on the October 4, 1986 edition, each show featured a cold open of short wrestler promos set to a loop of the beginning of Lee Ritenour's \"Traveling Music\" from the American Flyers soundtrack.[3] In February 1988, the songs were replaced with an original WWF-created instrumental theme. The new instrumental theme was originally used as the theme of the 1987 WWF Slammy Awards. A different opening theme song was used for the February 1992 episode. Selected episodes were also shown in the UK on ITV in its weekly Saturday lunchtime World Of Sport slot, mainly thanks to the popularity of The British Bulldogs. When WWE's flagship show, Raw, returned to the USA Network in 2005, Saturday Night's Main Event was revived in 2006 as a \"special series\" to air on occasion on NBC as part of a deal between WWE and NBC Universal. The Raw, SmackDown, and ECW brand rosters appeared on the show. Saturday Night's Main Event returned to NBC on March 18, 2006, in a prime-time slot. The first episode aired on a 1-hour time delay, the second episode aired live, with the three remaining episodes airing at a later date. The series was discontinued after July 2008;[4] in lieu of Saturday Night's Main Event, WWE began to instead produce hour-long WrestleMania highlights specials for NBC, beginning with The 25th Anniversary of WrestleMania: The World Television Premiere in August 2009.[5][6] In 2024, after originally moving to Fox in 2019, WWE SmackDown moved to USA Network as part of a five-year agreement with NBCUniversal. As part of the agreement, it was stated that WWE would produce four prime time specials for NBC per-year for the length of the agreement. On September 17, 2024, WWE announced that it would premiere a second revival of Saturday Night's Main Event, with the first episode to air on December 14 from Nassau Coliseum.[7] The new revival features homages to the original run of Saturday Night's Main Event, including the reinstatement of \"Obsession\" by Animotion as its theme music.[8] The following table lists the dates and locations of televised events; they do not include the 2022 house shows.

Following the match, Andre the Giant sneak-attacked Hogan and choked him to the brink of unconsciousness, fighting off several wrestlers who came to aid Hogan; this served as one of the build-ups to the Hogan-Andre match on The Main Event, which aired February 5, 1988. Saturday Night's Main Event XV took place on March 7, 1988, from Nashville, Tennessee, at the Nashville Municipal Auditorium, and aired on March 12, 1988.[50] Although there were 10,000 in attendance, it was reportedly a heavily papered event.[12] The event aired on NBC and drew a 10.0 rating.[51] During the tapings, Don Muraco vs Butch Reed was taped but aired on Prime Time Wrestling on April 11, 1988. The match between Hulk Hogan and Harley Race saw Race lay Hogan across a table outside the ring and attempted to hit a diving headbutt from the ring apron, but Hogan moved out of the way and Race crashed through the table, suffering a legitimate injury that would eventually force him into retirement in 1991.[52] After the Ted DiBiase and André the Giant match, Hogan appeared at ringside to clear the ring of DiBiase and Virgil after they began a post-match beatdown of Randy \"Macho Man\" Savage. The match between The Islanders (Haku and Tama) and The Killer Bees (Jim Brunzell and B. Brian Blair) was a two-out-of-three-falls match, however only the first fall was televised. Saturday Night's Main Event XVI took place on April 22, 1988, from Springfield, Massachusetts, at the Springfield Civic Center, and aired April 30, 1988[23][53] on NBC.

George Steinbrenner was shown in the front row during this event, and Bobby \"The Brain\" Heenan at one point remarked about the guy he managed in the ring at the time to Steinbrenner \"I've got a ring full of Winfields\".

The set includes more than 30 full matches and several non-wrestling segments. Among these are highlights of Uncle Elmer's wedding, Hulk Hogan's \"Real American\" music video, and Mr. Perfect smashing Hogan's WWF World Heavyweight Championship belt. The first match in the program's history, a six-man tag team match pitting the U.S. Express (Mike Rotundo and Barry Windham) teaming with Ricky Steamboat defeating the team of WWF Tag Team Champions Nikolai Volkoff and The Iron Sheik and their partner George \"The Animal\" Steele, is included as an extra. Also, two other notable matches are included, both from the program's spinoff The Main Event. The first is a February 1988 rematch from WrestleMania III pitting Hogan against André the Giant, the second a Mega Powers' (Hogan and Randy Savage) bout against the Twin Towers (The Big Boss Man and Akeem) from February 1989. Both had direct implications on each year's WrestleMania: the Hogan-Andre match led to the WWF title being vacated until WrestleMania IV while the Mega Powers-Twin Towers match led to the breakup of the Mega Powers and Hogan eventually defeating Randy Savage to win the WWF title at WrestleMania V.[104] In the WrestleMania 22 DVD, the XXXII edition was included in the 2nd disc in its entirety.",

            {
                "title": "Tennessee Volunteers basketball - Wikipedia",
                "content": "The Tennessee Volunteers men's basketball team is the collegiate men's basketball program for the University of Tennessee–Knoxville. The Volunteers (commonly referred to as the \"Vols\") compete in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and the Southeastern Conference (SEC). The Volunteers play their home games in Thompson–Boling Arena, on a court nicknamed \"the Summitt\", after former Tennessee Lady Vols basketball coach Pat Summitt. With a current capacity of 21,678 (formerly 24,535), Tennessee has consistently ranked in the top 15 in the nation in terms of volume of attendance, averaging 14,817 (60.39% capacity) attendance from 1988 through 2006, and averaging 17,194 (79.34% capacity) attendance from 2007 through 2018 after reducing seating capacity prior to the 2007 season.[2][3] Historically, Tennessee ranks third in the SEC in all-time wins.[4] Many notable players have played collegiately at Tennessee—players such as Bernard King, Dale Ellis, Allan Houston, Tobias Harris, and Grant Williams who all play(ed) in the NBA. Chris Lofton, Ron Slay, Tyler Smith, and John Fulkerson are also notable players who later played professionally in other leagues. The Volunteers are currently coached by Rick Barnes, who was hired on March 31, 2015, to replace Donnie Tyndall. In 1963, the University of Tennessee hired Ray Mears to become the head coach of the men's basketball program. The hiring of Mears, who was coming off an NCAA small college championship at Wittenberg University, ushered in the most sustained period of success in Tennessee men's basketball history. In his first year, Mears's Volunteers improved from a 4–19 record in 1962 to 13–11, highlighted by two wins over the Kentucky Wildcats. Before Mears, Tennessee had only beaten the Wildcats twice in 39 meetings. Throughout his career, Mears gained notoriety throughout the SEC for frequently being a thorn in the powerhouse Kentucky's side.[citation needed] In an era where Kentucky was coached by future College Basketball Hall of Fame members Adolph Rupp and Joe B. Hall, winning 75% of their games, Mears recorded a 15–15 record against the Wildcats. Led by A. W. Davis, the Volunteers finished second in the SEC in each of the next two seasons and recorded 20 wins in 1965, reaching that mark for the first time in 17 years. This success and the resultant growing fan support led to the university's decision to expand the 7,500-seat Amory-Fieldhouse to 12,700 seats. It was renamed Stokely Athletic Center to honor William B. Stokely, whose donation funded the renovation. In the expanded Stokely Center's inaugural season, the Volunteers captured the 1967 SEC championship and made the program's first-ever NCAA tournament appearance. Dubbed the \"Fearless Five,\" the 1967 team won road games against top conference teams Florida, Kentucky, and Mississippi State. The win over Mississippi State, coming in double-overtime on a pair of Bill Justus free throws, secured Tennessee's first SEC championship in 24 years and is referred to by some as the greatest basketball game in Tennessee history.[citation needed] From 1968 to 1973, Mears kept Tennessee among the top teams of the SEC, winning a second SEC championship in 1972 and finishing second in every year except 1970. In 1974, Mears and his trusted assistant Stu Aberdeen were able to recruit New York City standout forward Ernie Grunfeld to Knoxville. In his freshman season, Grunfeld led the team in scoring, averaging 17.4 points per game, and received first-team All-SEC honors. The following season, Grunfeld was joined by fellow New Yorker Bernard King. Known as \"The Ernie and Bernie Show,\" King and Grunfeld led the Volunteers to a 61–20 record over three years and an SEC championship in 1977. During their three years together, Tennessee posted a 5–1 record against Kentucky. The Volunteers reached the National Invitation Tournament in 1975 and the NCAA tournament in 1976 and 1977. King was named first-team All-American and SEC Player of the Year in 1975 and 1976, and then shared the honor with Grunfeld in 1977, with both being named SEC Co-Player of the Year. Grunfeld graduated from Tennessee in 1977 and King chose to forgo his senior year to enter the NBA draft. King was drafted 7th overall to the New Jersey Nets and Grunfeld went 11th overall to the Milwaukee Bucks. Both enjoyed long and illustrious NBA careers. Perhaps the biggest impact of the \"Ernie and Bernie\" show was how it changed the national perception of the Tennessee basketball program.[citation needed] This \"Double Trouble from Tennessee\" was featured in the February 1976 edition of Sports Illustrated.[5] In 2013, ESPN premiered a 30 for 30 documentary called \"Bernie and Ernie\" about the all-time great Volunteer basketball players. Following the exit of his two biggest stars, Mears, who long struggled with depression,[6] was not able to coach the team in 1978. Under the watch of interim coach Cliff Wettig, the Volunteers struggled to an 11–16 record, and Mears officially retired for health reasons after the season.[7] Mears is remembered not only as the greatest coach in Tennessee men's basketball history, but also as a great entertainer and marketer.[citation needed] From the beginning of his time at Tennessee, Mears employed marketing tactics to get fans to games—from his patented and provocative orange blazer, to his introduction of the Pride of the Southland Band to basketball games, to his entertaining pre-game warmups that compared to the Harlem Globetrotters for creativity.[8] At the beginning of his tenure, Mears declared, \"This is Big Orange Country,\" and this slogan has lived on long past his coaching years.[9] Don DeVoe was named Mears's successor and took over as head coach for the 1979 season. Despite the losing record in 1978, DeVoe inherited a roster centered on All-American center Reggie Johnson. DeVoe's 1979 Volunteers finished the regular season with a 21–12 record, beating Kentucky twice and earning a second-place finish in the SEC. The 1979 SEC tournament was the first held in 27 years, and the Volunteers reached the tournament finals, where they once again defeated Kentucky by a score of 75–69 to win their first SEC Tournament championship since 1943. With the tournament championship win, the Volunteers were invited back to the NCAA tournament, where they recorded the program's first NCAA tournament win with a defeat of Eastern Kentucky. Tennessee was eliminated in the second round with a loss to Notre Dame. DeVoe led Tennessee to the NCAA tournament each of the next five years, but none of his teams advanced past the second round. Through his first seven years at UT, DeVoe compiled an overall record of 143–79 (.644). The program's momentum under his direction eventually weakened, however, and the Volunteers were not invited to the NCAA tournament or the NIT in 1986 or 1987. Entering the 1989 season, DeVoe's 11th year at Tennessee, his teams had not reached the NCAA tournament or finished above 6th in the SEC since 1983. DeVoe led the Volunteers to a 19–11 record and a berth in the NCAA tournament. After an 84–68 loss to West Virginia in the first round, DeVoe resigned. The growth of UT basketball under DeVoe is still seen today in the Vols' current home arena, Thompson–Boling Arena, which was built during his tenure. By the mid-1980s, the overflow crowds had grown too large for the 12,700-seat Stokley Athletic Center. In 1988, the Volunteers moved to the new $30 million Thompson–Boling Arena, which seated over 24,500 people—at the time, the largest facility ever built specifically for basketball in the United States. Sitting on the banks of the Tennessee River nearby historic Neyland Stadium, the arena has accommodated 21,678 people since a 2007 renovation. In 1990, Wade Houston, an Alcoa, Tennessee native and former assistant coach at Louisville, became the first African-American head coach in Tennessee and SEC history. Houston's son, Allan Houston, came to UT to play for his father and would become one of the most accomplished players in Tennessee history. With 2801 points, Allan Houston finished his career as Tennessee's all-time leading scorer and was named All-American in 1992 and 1993. Houston was fired after a 5–22 campaign in 1994, finishing the worst season in Tennessee history. None of his teams reached the NCAA tournament, and only two of his teams received invitations to the NIT, the two of which were also his only teams to finish with winning records. Houston finished with an overall record of 65–90 at Tennessee. Houston was replaced by Kevin O'Neill in 1995. O'Neill—an intense and somewhat high-strung sideline coach, but also a skilled recruiter[citation needed]—took over a program depleted in talent. He was able to sign talented players such as Brandon Wharton, Tony Harris, and Isiah Victor. O'Neill left Tennessee to become the head coach at Northwestern after the 1997 season. O'Neill was replaced by Oregon Ducks head coach Jerry Green. Green inherited a roster with significant young talent and was able to an immediate improvement in on-court success. His first Tennessee team produced a 20–9 overall record—a nine-win improvement over the 11–16 record of O'Neill's third and final UT team—and advanced to the 1998 NCAA tournament. In his second year, Green's Volunteers won the 1999 SEC East Division championship and defeated Kentucky twice in the same season for the first time since 1979, in what is generally regarded to be the best overall year in school athletics history. (The 1998 Tennessee Football team finished 13–0 and won the first-ever BCS National Championship. In women's basketball, Pat Summitt led the Lady Volunteers to a 39–0 NCAA championship season, the program's third consecutive national title.) The 2000 Tennessee men's basketball team finished 26–7, repeating as SEC East champions, winning the Volunteers' first SEC championship since 1982, and setting a program record for most wins in a single season. In the NCAA tournament, the Volunteers advanced to the first Sweet Sixteen in school history, where they lost a close contest to North Carolina. Green's Volunteers began the 2001 season with a 16–1 record, rising to No. 4 in the AP Poll. Beginning with a ten-point loss at Kentucky in mid-January, Tennessee then struggled to a 22–11 finish. Green's team advanced to the NCAA tournament—the fourth appearance in Green's four seasons—losing in the first round. Coupled with his multiple incidents with local media and Tennessee fans,[10] this disappointing finish to the season led to Green's resignation. He was replaced by Buzz Peterson, who failed to lead the program to an NCAA tournament berth in his four years as head coach. He was fired after the 2005 season, in which his team finished 14–17. After taking Wisconsin–Milwaukee to a Sweet Sixteen in 2005, Bruce Pearl was hired as the new Tennessee men's basketball coach. Pearl's assistants Tony Jones, Steve Forbes, Jacob Nichols, Jason Shay, and Ken Johnson were part of a staff that would help to lead the Volunteers to the NCAA tournament six years in a row. Pearl inherited a roster that had not experienced much winning, but showed promise with future NBA senior point guard C. J. Watson and All-SEC freshman team shooting guard Chris Lofton. Pearl's coaching, which included playing an up-tempo style and pressing defense, led to immediate gains for Tennessee. In his first season, Pearl led the Volunteers to a 22–8 record, an SEC East Division championship, and a no. 2 seed in the NCAA Tournament. Pearl's first team achieved some of the more memorable wins in program history, including two wins against the eventual national champion Florida Gators. Another memorable win came when Chris Lofton, who is a Kentucky native, led the Volunteers over Kentucky in Rupp Arena for the program's first win there since 1999. Pearl's 2006 recruiting class was ranked among the top ten in college basketball.[11] Despite the influx of freshmen and their inexperience, the Volunteers were able to open with a 13–2 start to the season. All-American guard Chris Lofton was injured and missed a good portion of January and early February, during which time the Volunteers opened 3–5 in SEC play. After Lofton returned, Tennessee won 7 out of their last 8 regular season games. Given a no. 5 seed, the Volunteers returned to the Sweet Sixteen where they faced no. 1 seed Ohio State. Tennessee led 49–32 at halftime, but the eventual NCAA runner-up Buckeyes mounted a comeback to defeat the Volunteers by a score of 85–84. During the 2006–07 season, the Volunteers were ranked 4th nationally in attendance, with an average of 19,661 fans in Thompson–Boling Arena, which has a capacity of 21,758. This marked an increase in attendance of an average of 7,436 per game since Pearl arrived in March 2005.[citation needed] Preseason expectations for the Volunteers were high entering the 2008 season.[12] Chris Lofton was a preseason pick by some to win National Player of the Year, and he was joined by Tyler Smith, an All-Big Ten freshman transfer from Iowa. Senior guards JaJuan Smith and Jordan Howell, along with rising sophomores Wayne Chism and Ramar Smith, propelled the Volunteers to a preseason no. 7 ranking. The team posted a record of 28–3 in the regular season. The season was highlighted by the rivalry matchup between Tennessee and Memphis. John Calipari's Tigers were undefeated and ranked no. 1 and the Volunteers were no. 2. In front the largest TV audience to date to ever watch a game on ESPN, the two teams remained evenly matched for thirty-nine minutes. The Volunteers trailed 61–60 with 30 seconds left before Tyler Smith made a jump-shot to give UT the lead. The Volunteers added three free throws and took the contest by a score of 66–62. The following Monday, Tennessee was ranked no. 1 in polls for the first time in school history. The Volunteers finished the regular season as the outright SEC champions and the no. 1 seed for the SEC Tournament in Atlanta. The Volunteers won their first game to set up a semifinal matchup against Arkansas in the Georgia Dome. The night before the game, an EF2 tornado hit Downtown Atlanta, damaging the Georgia Dome and much of the surrounding area. Because of this, the tournament was nearly canceled but was ultimately moved to Georgia Tech's Alexander Memorial Coliseum. The Razorbacks were able to upset the Volunteers, denying them a place in the final and a shot at their first SEC Tournament championship in 30 years. The Volunteers received a no. 2 seed in the NCAA tournament. They advanced to the Sweet Sixteen, where they lost to the Louisville Cardinals men's basketball. Despite the disappointing ending, the 2008 season is remembered as one of the best in program history. Replacing Chris Lofton proved a difficult task in the 2009 season. Now led by Tyler Smith, the Volunteers finished with a 21–13 record. However, Tennessee claimed another SEC division championship. The Volunteers advanced to the SEC Tournament Championship in Tampa before losing to Mississippi State 64–61. The Volunteers lost their NCAA tournament first-round game to Oklahoma State. Entering the regular season ranked in the top 10, the Volunteers started the season 10–2. On New Year's Day, players Melvin Goins, Cam Tatum, Brian Williams, and leading scorer Tyler Smith were arrested after a traffic stop when police found marijuana and an illegal firearm.[13] The players were all suspended for multiple games and Tyler Smith was eventually dismissed from the team.[14] After the suspensions, the Volunteers were left with only six scholarship players. The Volunteers defeated Charlotte and then hosted no. 1 Kansas the next game. In front of a sellout crowd, the undermanned Volunteers defeated the Jayhawks 76–68. Tennessee cemented its lead with a shot clock-beating three-point shot with under a minute left by local freshman walk-on Skylar McBee, who entered the rotation due to the suspensions. Tennessee rode the momentum of the Kansas upset to a 23–7 regular season record. This included another upset of second-ranked Kentucky, which featured future NBA All-Stars John Wall and DeMarcus Cousins, as well as four other eventual NBA players. The Volunteers won 74–65 at home in front of a raucous crowd. The Wildcats were able to avenge the loss a week and half later in the SEC Tournament. As a no. 6 seed in a bracket featuring overall top seed Kansas, the Volunteers defeated a Steve Fisher-coached San Diego State team with Kawhi Leonard in the first round. No. 14 seed Ohio upset the no. 3 seed Georgetown Hoyas, setting up a matchup between the Volunteers and the Bobcats in the following round. After winning 83–68, Tennessee advanced to Bruce Pearl's third Sweet Sixteen in five years. In a rematch of the 2007 Sweet Sixteen, the Volunteers faced the Ohio State Buckeyes at the Edward Jones Dome in St. Louis. In a back and forth battle with the Evan Turner-led Buckeyes, Tennessee held a 76–73 lead with 13 seconds left. Turner missed a three-point shot, rebounded his own missed shot, and attempted a final three-point shot that was blocked by J. P. Prince, securing the Volunteers an appearance in the Elite Eight for the first time in program history. Tennessee faced Michigan State in the Elite Eight. After a fast start, the Vols sputtered in the second half and Michigan State was able to keep the game close. Down by one point with 11 seconds left, Tennessee's Scotty Hopson was set to attempt two free throws. He made the first but missed the second. With the score tied, Michigan State advanced the ball and was fouled on a fast break. Raymar Morgan made one of two free throws, and Michigan State was able to defeat Tennessee one game short of the Final Four. Tennessee opened the 2010–11 season with success, winning the Preseason NIT and rising as high as no. 7 in the national polls. In mid-December, the NCAA announced an investigation into Bruce Pearl for his role in a possible recruiting violation.[citation needed] SEC Commissioner Mike Slive suspended Pearl for the first half of the SEC season.[15] Tennessee faltered throughout the rest of the season to a 19–15 record. Tennessee appeared in the NCAA tournament for the sixth consecutive year under Pearl and faced Michigan in the opening round. The Volunteers were defeated 75–45 in what proved to be Pearl's last game. On March 21, 2011, the week after the loss, the university announced the firing of Pearl, based on Pearl's misconduct of lying to the NCAA in the ongoing investigation.[16] Pearl was eventually given a three-year show-cause penalty. On March 27, 2011, the University of Tennessee announced the hiring of Cuonzo Martin as the Volunteers' 18th head coach. Martin had spent the prior three seasons at Missouri State, where he compiled a record of 61–41. Martin was able to lead the Missouri State team from an 11–20 record and a last-place finish in the Missouri Valley Conference to a 26–9 record and a first-place conference finish. Martin took over a depleted roster with low expectations. After the departure of Tobias Harris following his freshman season, the Volunteers were picked to finish near the bottom of the SEC in 2011–12.[citation needed] With the emergence of Jordan McRae and Jeronne Maymon, and the mid-season addition of Jarnell Stokes, Martin took a team that had lost their top three—and seven of their top ten—contributors from the previous season to a second-place finish in the SEC, largely because of their tough defense and lack of turnovers. With an outside chance at the NCAA tournament, the Volunteers lost their first SEC tournament game to Ole Miss, ending their NCAA chances. They played in the NIT before losing in the second round. In 2012–13, the Volunteers started off slowly, posting an 11–10 record before finishing the regular season 8–1. UT was eliminated in the second round of the SEC Tournament and was left out of the NCAA tournament for the second straight year, finishing as one of the last teams out.[citation needed] Expectations were high heading into 2013–14 with a roster many felt could compete for a Sweet Sixteen appearance.[citation needed] However, the fans quickly grew vocally upset after another slow start of 16–11. A petition with thousands of signatures surfaced online for the firing of Cuonzo Martin and the re-hiring of Bruce Pearl, whose show-cause order was ending the next year.[citation needed] Whether the petition motivated the team or not, the Volunteers finished the season 5–1 and earned a place in the \"First Four\" round of the NCAA tournament. They defeated Iowa in the play-in game in Dayton, Ohio to move on to face the UMass Minutemen. Martin's Volunteers, who were the lower seed, were favored by many and easily defeated UMass. In one of the biggest upsets in tournament history, Mercer upset Duke, and the Volunteers went on to defeat Mercer to advance to the Sweet Sixteen. Tennessee then played Michigan in Indianapolis. In front of one of the largest crowds to witness a Sweet Sixteen game, the Volunteers' comeback fell short and UT lost to Michigan by a score of 73–71. Martin resigned from Tennessee and accepted the coaching job at California on April 15, 2014.[17] After a brief coaching search, Tennessee athletics director Dave Hart announced on April 21, 2014 that former Morehead State and Southern Mississippi head coach Donnie Tyndall would become the next head coach of the Tennessee Volunteers.[18] Tyndall inherited a roster that returned one contributing player from the previous year. Also, due to Jarnell Stokes's decision to enter the NBA draft and two other players transferring, Tyndall had to recruit and sign nearly one-third of the 2015 team's roster in less than a month. Under these circumstances, he led the 2015 team to a 16–16 record. After the season was over, Tennessee announced it was firing Tyndall with cause after it learned that he had lied to both UT and the NCAA about the severity of major NCAA violations that had occurred at Southern Miss.[19] Hart said that he would have never hired Tyndall had the true extent of the violations been known. By this time, it was clear that Tyndall would face severe penalties for his role in the violations, including a suspension for part of the season. According to ESPN, Hart and other officials were still smarting from Pearl having to sit out the first half of conference play three years earlier, and were not willing to face the prospect of an equally lengthy suspension for Tyndall.[20] While searching for its third basketball coach in four years, Tennessee sought to make a hire that would bring much-needed stability to the program.[citation needed] During the search process, news broke that Texas had fired their head coach of 17 years, Rick Barnes. Barnes, who had a prior connection to Tennessee athletics director Dave Hart, quickly surfaced as the frontrunner for the job.[citation needed] On March 31, 2015, Barnes was named the new Tennessee men's basketball coach. Barnes boasts the best record of any coach in school history, with an overall record of 604–314 from his previous tenures at Texas, Clemson, and Providence. Barnes is originally from nearby Hickory, North Carolina, and his wife, Candy, graduated from Tennessee in 1975.[21] The Rick Barnes era began on a winning note as Tennessee defeated UNC Asheville, 82–78 in Barnes' debut game at UT. In Barnes' third year as Tennessee's coach he completed quite the turnaround from the previous year's 16–16 (8–10) team, as his team would finish the regular season 26–9 (13–5) and capture a share of the SEC regular season title. This would be Tennessee's first regular season title since 2008 and tenth overall.[22] Tennessee also reached the SEC men's basketball championship final where they were defeated by Kentucky 77–72. In 2019, Tennessee experienced their best season record wise under Barnes. The Volunteers would earn a record of 31–6 (15–3) including an 18-game win streak and a no.1 ranking in the polls for the first time since the 2007–08 season. The Volunteers again reached the SEC men's basketball championship final where they were defeated by Auburn 84–64. The Volunteers proceeded to earn a #2 seed in the 2019 NCAA tournament, where they defeated Colgate 77–70 in the first round.[23] Tennessee overcame a resurgent Iowa Hawkeyes team in the second round by a score of 83–77 in an overtime thriller. The Volunteers fell to Purdue in the Sweet Sixteen in overtime after a thrilling come-from-behind run led by Volunteer guard Admiral Schofield. Purdue's Ryan Cline kept the Boilermakers in the game late and after a controversial call on Lamonte Turner, the Vols lost. Junior forward Grant Williams captured the 2018–19 SEC player of the year award, his second consecutive year obtaining the honor.[24] Source[25][26][27] National champion Postseason invitational champion Conference regular season champion Conference regular season and conference tournament champion Division regular season champion Division regular season and conference tournament champion Conference tournament champion Tennessee plays its home games in Thompson–Boling Arena, which was at one time the largest facility ever built specifically for basketball in the United States, with a seating capacity of 24,678 until its 2007 renovation. Named for the late B. Ray Thompson and former UT President Dr. Edward J. Boling, the arena regularly hosts women's volleyball matches, concerts, camps, conferences, and other special events throughout the year. Thompson–Boling Arena opened during the 1987–88 season, with Tennessee defeating Marquette 82–56 before a crowd of 25,272. In its opening season, the Volunteers finished third nationally in attendance, with an average attendance of more than 20,000 fans per game. Much of the facility's storied history has centered on men's and women's basketball. In the last two decades, the Volunteers and Lady Volunteers have hosted record college basketball crowds, as well as WNBA and NCAA tournament basketball games. The Volunteers have ranked fourth in the nation in average home attendance for each of the past three seasons, including an average of 20,483 fans per game in 2008–09. Tennessee's 1989 men's game against Kentucky set the SEC regular-season record with a crowd of 25,610. The Lady Volunteers drew 24,597 fans for their 1998 game with Connecticut to establish a women's NCAA record, while a Celtics-Bullets game in 1988 attracted a then-NBA-record exhibition crowd of 23,611. The arena's largest basketball crowd since its capacity was reduced to 21,678 prior to the 2007–08 season came on January 7, 2009, when the Vols hosted Gonzaga in front of a sellout crowd of 22,326. UT hosted the NCAA tournament's South Regional Finals in 1994 and 1999 in the spacious facility, as well as the 1990 NCAA Southeast Region's first- and second-round games and the NCAA women's 1990 Final Four. The 1989 SEC Tournament was the first of what promised to be many postseason tournaments to be held in Thompson–Boling Arena. The riverfront arena has drawn rave reviews from teams, administrators, and media for its modern facilities needed for hosting major tournaments. The Volunteers have appeared in the NCAA tournament 26 times. Their combined record is 28–27. The Volunteers have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) 13 times. Their combined record is 13–13. †: First Team All-American Tennessee has retired five jersey numbers.[30][31][32][33][34]",

                "content": "A rocket (from Italian: rocchetto, lit. ''bobbin/spool'', and so named for its shape)[nb 1][1] is a vehicle that uses jet propulsion to accelerate without using any surrounding air. A rocket engine produces thrust by reaction to exhaust expelled at high speed.[2] Rocket engines work entirely from propellant carried within the vehicle; therefore a rocket can fly in the vacuum of space. Rockets work more efficiently in a vacuum and incur a loss of thrust due to the opposing pressure of the atmosphere. Multistage rockets are capable of attaining escape velocity from Earth and therefore can achieve unlimited maximum altitude. Compared with airbreathing engines, rockets are lightweight and powerful and capable of generating large accelerations. To control their flight, rockets rely on momentum, airfoils, auxiliary reaction engines, gimballed thrust, momentum wheels, deflection of the exhaust stream, propellant flow, spin, or gravity. Rockets for military and recreational uses date back to at least 13th-century China.[3] Significant scientific, interplanetary and industrial use did not occur until the 20th century, when rocketry was the enabling technology for the Space Age, including setting foot on the Moon. Rockets are now used for fireworks, missiles and other weaponry, ejection seats, launch vehicles for artificial satellites, human spaceflight, and space exploration. Chemical rockets are the most common type of high power rocket, typically creating a high speed exhaust by the combustion of fuel with an oxidizer. The stored propellant can be a simple pressurized gas or a single liquid fuel that disassociates in the presence of a catalyst (monopropellant), two liquids that spontaneously react on contact (hypergolic propellants), two liquids that must be ignited to react (like kerosene (RP1) and liquid oxygen, used in most liquid-propellant rockets), a solid combination of fuel with oxidizer (solid fuel), or solid fuel with liquid or gaseous oxidizer (hybrid propellant system). Chemical rockets store a large amount of energy in an easily released form, and can be very dangerous. However, careful design, testing, construction and use minimizes risks.[citation needed] In China, gunpowder-powered rockets evolved in medieval China under the Song dynasty by the 13th century. They also developed an early form of multiple rocket launcher during this time. The Mongols adopted Chinese rocket technology and the invention spread via the Mongol invasions to the Middle East and to Europe in the mid-13th century.[4] According to Joseph Needham, the Song navy used rockets in a military exercise dated to 1245. Internal-combustion rocket propulsion is mentioned in a reference to 1264, recording that the \"ground-rat\", a type of firework, had frightened the Empress-Mother Gongsheng at a feast held in her honor by her son the Emperor Lizong.[5] Subsequently, rockets are included in the military treatise Huolongjing, also known as the Fire Drake Manual, written by the Chinese artillery officer Jiao Yu in the mid-14th century. This text mentions the first known multistage rocket, the 'fire-dragon issuing from the water' (Huo long chu shui), thought to have been used by the Chinese navy.[6] Medieval and early modern rockets were used militarily as incendiary weapons in sieges. Between 1270 and 1280, Hasan al-Rammah wrote al-furusiyyah wa al-manasib al-harbiyya (The Book of Military Horsemanship and Ingenious War Devices), which included 107 gunpowder recipes, 22 of them for rockets.[7][8] In Europe, Roger Bacon mentioned firecrackers made in various parts of the world in the Opus Majus of 1267. Between 1280 and 1300, the Liber Ignium gave instructions for constructing devices that are similar to firecrackers based on second hand accounts.[9] Konrad Kyeser described rockets in his military treatise Bellifortis around 1405.[10] Giovanni Fontana, a Paduan engineer in 1420, created rocket-propelled animal figures.[11][12] The name \"rocket\" comes from the Italian rocchetta, meaning \"bobbin\" or \"little spindle\", given due to the similarity in shape to the bobbin or spool used to hold the thread from a spinning wheel. Leonhard Fronsperger and Conrad Haas adopted the Italian term into German in the mid-16th century; \"rocket\" appears in English by the early 17th century.[1] Artis Magnae Artilleriae pars prima, an important early modern work on rocket artillery, by Casimir Siemienowicz, was first printed in Amsterdam in 1650. The Mysorean rockets were the first successful iron-cased rockets, developed in the late 18th century in the Kingdom of Mysore (part of present-day India) under the rule of Hyder Ali.[13] The Congreve rocket was a British weapon designed and developed by Sir William Congreve in 1804. This rocket was based directly on the Mysorean rockets, used compressed powder and was fielded in the Napoleonic Wars. It was Congreve rockets to which Francis Scott Key was referring, when he wrote of the \"rockets' red glare\" while held captive on a British ship that was laying siege to Fort McHenry in 1814.[14] Together, the Mysorean and British innovations increased the effective range of military rockets from 100 to 2,000 yards (91 to 1,829 m). The first mathematical treatment of the dynamics of rocket propulsion is due to William Moore (1813). In 1814, Congreve published a book in which he discussed the use of multiple rocket launching apparatus.[15][16] In 1815 Alexander Dmitrievich Zasyadko constructed rocket-launching platforms, which allowed rockets to be fired in salvos (6 rockets at a time), and gun-laying devices. William Hale in 1844 greatly increased the accuracy of rocket artillery. Edward Mounier Boxer further improved the Congreve rocket in 1865. William Leitch first proposed the concept of using rockets to enable human spaceflight in 1861. Leitch's rocket spaceflight description was first provided in his 1861 essay \"A Journey Through Space\", which was later published in his book God's Glory in the Heavens (1862).[17] Konstantin Tsiolkovsky later (in 1903) also conceived this idea, and extensively developed a body of theory that has provided the foundation for subsequent spaceflight development. The British Royal Flying Corps designed a guided rocket during World War I. Archibald Low stated \"...in 1917 the Experimental Works designed an electrically steered rocket… Rocket experiments were conducted under my own patents with the help of Cdr. Brock.\"[18] The patent \"Improvements in Rockets\" was raised in July 1918 but not published until February 1923 for security reasons. Firing and guidance controls could be either wire or wireless. The propulsion and guidance rocket eflux emerged from the deflecting cowl at the nose. In 1920, Professor Robert Goddard of Clark University published proposed improvements to rocket technology in A Method of Reaching Extreme Altitudes.[19] In 1923, Hermann Oberth (1894–1989) published Die Rakete zu den Planetenräumen (The Rocket into Planetary Space). Modern rockets originated in 1926 when Goddard attached a supersonic (de Laval) nozzle to a high pressure combustion chamber. These nozzles turn the hot gas from the combustion chamber into a cooler, hypersonic, highly directed jet of gas, more than doubling the thrust and raising the engine efficiency from 2% to 64%.[19] His use of liquid propellants instead of gunpowder greatly lowered the weight and increased the effectiveness of rockets. In 1921, the Soviet research and development laboratory Gas Dynamics Laboratory began developing solid-propellant rockets, which resulted in the first launch in 1928, which flew for approximately 1,300 metres.[20] These rockets were used in 1931 for the world's first successful use of rockets for jet-assisted takeoff of aircraft[21] and became the prototypes for the Katyusha rocket launcher,[22] which were used during World War II. In 1929, Fritz Lang's German science fiction film Woman in the Moon was released. It showcased the use of a multi-stage rocket, and also pioneered the concept of a rocket launch pad (a rocket standing upright against a tall building before launch having been slowly rolled into place) and the rocket-launch countdown clock.[23][24] The Guardian film critic Stephen Armstrong states Lang \"created the rocket industry\".[23] Lang was inspired by the 1923 book The Rocket into Interplanetary Space by Hermann Oberth, who became the film's scientific adviser and later an important figure in the team that developed the V-2 rocket.[25] The film was thought to be so realistic that it was banned by the Nazis when they came to power for fear it would reveal secrets about the V-2 rockets.[26] In 1943 production of the V-2 rocket began in Germany. It was designed by the Peenemünde Army Research Center with Wernher von Braun serving as the technical director.[27] The V-2 became the first artificial object to travel into space by crossing the Kármán line with the vertical launch of MW 18014 on 20 June 1944.[28] Doug Millard, space historian and curator of space technology at the Science Museum, London, where a V-2 is exhibited in the main exhibition hall, states: \"The V-2 was a quantum leap of technological change. We got to the Moon using V-2 technology but this was technology that was developed with massive resources, including some particularly grim ones. The V-2 programme was hugely expensive in terms of lives, with the Nazis using slave labour to manufacture these rockets\".[29] In parallel with the German guided-missile programme, rockets were also used on aircraft, either for assisting horizontal take-off (RATO), vertical take-off (Bachem Ba 349 \"Natter\") or for powering them (Me 163, see list of World War II guided missiles of Germany). The Allies' rocket programs were less technological, relying mostly on unguided missiles like the Soviet Katyusha rocket in the artillery role, and the American anti tank bazooka projectile. These used solid chemical propellants. The Americans captured a large number of German rocket scientists, including Wernher von Braun, in 1945, and brought them to the United States as part of Operation Paperclip. After World War II scientists used rockets to study high-altitude conditions, by radio telemetry of temperature and pressure of the atmosphere, detection of cosmic rays, and further techniques; note too the Bell X-1, the first crewed vehicle to break the sound barrier (1947). Independently, in the Soviet Union's space program research continued under the leadership of the chief designer Sergei Korolev (1907–1966). During the Cold War rockets became extremely important militarily with the development of modern intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). The 1960s saw rapid development of rocket technology, particularly in the Soviet Union (Vostok, Soyuz, Proton) and in the United States (e.g. the X-15). Rockets came into use for space exploration. American crewed programs (Project Mercury, Project Gemini and later the Apollo programme) culminated in 1969 with the first crewed landing on the Moon – using equipment launched by the Saturn V rocket. Rocket vehicles are often constructed in the archetypal tall thin \"rocket\" shape that takes off vertically, but there are actually many different types of rockets including:[30] A rocket design can be as simple as a cardboard tube filled with black powder, but to make an efficient, accurate rocket or missile involves overcoming a number of difficult problems. The main difficulties include cooling the combustion chamber, pumping the fuel (in the case of a liquid fuel), and controlling and correcting the direction of motion.[35] Rockets consist of a propellant, a place to put propellant (such as a propellant tank), and a nozzle. They may also have one or more rocket engines, directional stabilization device(s) (such as fins, vernier engines or engine gimbals for thrust vectoring, gyroscopes) and a structure (typically monocoque) to hold these components together. Rockets intended for high speed atmospheric use also have an aerodynamic fairing such as a nose cone, which usually holds the payload.[36] As well as these components, rockets can have any number of other components, such as wings (rocketplanes), parachutes, wheels (rocket cars), even, in a sense, a person (rocket belt). Vehicles frequently possess navigation systems and guidance systems that typically use satellite navigation and inertial navigation systems. Rocket engines employ the principle of jet propulsion.[2] The rocket engines powering rockets come in a great variety of different types; a comprehensive list can be found in the main article, Rocket engine. Most current rockets are chemically powered rockets (usually internal combustion engines,[37] but some employ a decomposing monopropellant) that emit a hot exhaust gas. A rocket engine can use gas propellants, solid propellant, liquid propellant, or a hybrid mixture of both solid and liquid. Some rockets use heat or pressure that is supplied from a source other than the chemical reaction of propellant(s), such as steam rockets, solar thermal rockets, nuclear thermal rocket engines or simple pressurized rockets such as water rocket or cold gas thrusters. With combustive propellants a chemical reaction is initiated between the fuel and the oxidizer in the combustion chamber, and the resultant hot gases accelerate out of a rocket engine nozzle (or nozzles) at the rearward-facing end of the rocket. The acceleration of these gases through the engine exerts force (\"thrust\") on the combustion chamber and nozzle, propelling the vehicle (according to Newton's Third Law). This actually happens because the force (pressure times area) on the combustion chamber wall is unbalanced by the nozzle opening; this is not the case in any other direction. The shape of the nozzle also generates force by directing the exhaust gas along the axis of the rocket.[2] Rocket propellant is mass that is stored, usually in some form of propellant tank or casing, prior to being used as the propulsive mass that is ejected from a rocket engine in the form of a fluid jet to produce thrust.[2] For chemical rockets often the propellants are a fuel such as liquid hydrogen or kerosene burned with an oxidizer such as liquid oxygen or nitric acid to produce large volumes of very hot gas. The oxidiser is either kept separate and mixed in the combustion chamber, or comes premixed, as with solid rockets. Sometimes the propellant is not burned but still undergoes a chemical reaction, and can be a 'monopropellant' such as hydrazine, nitrous oxide or hydrogen peroxide that can be catalytically decomposed to hot gas. Alternatively, an inert propellant can be used that can be externally heated, such as in steam rocket, solar thermal rocket or nuclear thermal rockets.[2] For smaller, low performance rockets such as attitude control thrusters where high performance is less necessary, a pressurised fluid is used as propellant that simply escapes the spacecraft through a propelling nozzle.[2] The first liquid-fuel rocket, constructed by Robert H. Goddard, differed significantly from modern rockets. The rocket engine was at the top and the fuel tank at the bottom of the rocket,[38] based on Goddard's belief that the rocket would achieve stability by \"hanging\" from the engine like a pendulum in flight.[39] However, the rocket veered off course and crashed 184 feet (56 m) away from the launch site,[40] indicating that the rocket was no more stable than one with the rocket engine at the base.[41] Rockets or other similar reaction devices carrying their own propellant must be used when there is no other substance (land, water, or air) or force (gravity, magnetism, light) that a vehicle may usefully employ for propulsion, such as in space. In these circumstances, it is necessary to carry all the propellant to be used. However, they are also useful in other situations: Some military weapons use rockets to propel warheads to their targets. A rocket and its payload together are generally referred to as a missile when the weapon has a guidance system (not all missiles use rocket engines, some use other engines such as jets) or as a rocket if it is unguided. Anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles use rocket engines to engage targets at high speed at a range of several miles, while intercontinental ballistic missiles can be used to deliver multiple nuclear warheads from thousands of miles, and anti-ballistic missiles try to stop them. Rockets have also been tested for reconnaissance, such as the Ping-Pong rocket, which was launched to surveil enemy targets, however, recon rockets have never come into wide use in the military. Sounding rockets are commonly used to carry instruments that take readings from 50 kilometers (31 mi) to 1,500 kilometers (930 mi) above the surface of the Earth.[42] The first images of Earth from space were obtained from a V-2 rocket in 1946 (flight #13).[43] Rocket engines are also used to propel rocket sleds along a rail at extremely high speed. The world record for this is Mach 8.5.[44] Larger rockets are normally launched from a launch pad that provides stable support until a few seconds after ignition. Due to their high exhaust velocity—2,500 to 4,500 m/s (9,000 to 16,200 km/h; 5,600 to 10,100 mph)—rockets are particularly useful when very high speeds are required, such as orbital speed at approximately 7,800 m/s (28,000 km/h; 17,000 mph). Spacecraft delivered into orbital trajectories become artificial satellites, which are used for many commercial purposes. Indeed, rockets remain the only way to launch spacecraft into orbit and beyond.[45] They are also used to rapidly accelerate spacecraft when they change orbits or de-orbit for landing. Also, a rocket may be used to soften a hard parachute landing immediately before touchdown (see retrorocket). Rockets were used to propel a line to a stricken ship so that a Breeches buoy can be used to rescue those on board. Rockets are also used to launch emergency flares. Some crewed rockets, notably the Saturn V[46] and Soyuz,[47] have launch escape systems. This is a small, usually solid rocket that is capable of pulling the crewed capsule away from the main vehicle towards safety at a moments notice. These types of systems have been operated several times, both in testing and in flight, and operated correctly each time. This was the case when the Safety Assurance System (Soviet nomenclature) successfully pulled away the L3 capsule during three of the four failed launches of the Soviet Moon rocket, N1 vehicles 3L, 5L and 7L. In all three cases the capsule, albeit uncrewed, was saved from destruction. Only the three aforementioned N1 rockets had functional Safety Assurance Systems. The outstanding vehicle, 6L, had dummy upper stages and therefore no escape system giving the N1 booster a 100% success rate for egress from a failed launch.[48][49][50][51] A successful escape of a crewed capsule occurred when Soyuz T-10, on a mission to the Salyut 7 space station, exploded on the pad.[52] Solid rocket propelled ejection seats are used in many military aircraft to propel crew away to safety from a vehicle when flight control is lost.[53] A model rocket is a small rocket designed to reach low altitudes (e.g., 100–500 m (330–1,640 ft) for 30 g (1.1 oz) model) and be recovered by a variety of means. According to the United States National Association of Rocketry (nar) Safety Code,[54] model rockets are constructed of paper, wood, plastic and other lightweight materials. The code also provides guidelines for motor use, launch site selection, launch methods, launcher placement, recovery system design and deployment and more. Since the early 1960s, a copy of the Model Rocket Safety Code has been provided with most model rocket kits and motors. Despite its inherent association with extremely flammable substances and objects with a pointed tip traveling at high speeds, model rocketry historically has proven[55][56] to be a very safe hobby and has been credited as a significant source of inspiration for children who eventually become scientists and engineers.[57] Hobbyists build and fly a wide variety of model rockets. Many companies produce model rocket kits and parts but due to their inherent simplicity some hobbyists have been known to make rockets out of almost anything. Rockets are also used in some types of consumer and professional fireworks. A water rocket is a type of model rocket using water as its reaction mass. The pressure vessel (the engine of the rocket) is usually a used plastic soft drink bottle. The water is forced out by a pressurized gas, typically compressed air. It is an example of Newton's third law of motion. The scale of amateur rocketry can range from a small rocket launched in one's own backyard to a rocket that reached space.[58] Amateur rocketry is split into three categories according to total engine impulse: low-power, mid-power, and high-power. Hydrogen peroxide rockets are used to power jet packs,[59] and have been used to power cars and a rocket car holds the all time (albeit unofficial) drag racing record.[60] Corpulent Stump is the most powerful non-commercial rocket ever launched on an Aerotech engine in the United Kingdom.[61][62][63] Launches for orbital spaceflights, or into interplanetary space, are usually from a fixed location on the ground, but would also be possible from an aircraft or ship. Rocket launch technologies include the entire set of systems needed to successfully launch a vehicle, not just the vehicle itself, but also the firing control systems, mission control center, launch pad, ground stations, and tracking stations needed for a successful launch or recovery or both. These are often collectively referred to as the \"ground segment\". Orbital launch vehicles commonly take off vertically, and then begin to progressively lean over, usually following a gravity turn trajectory. Once above the majority of the atmosphere, the vehicle then angles the rocket jet, pointing it largely horizontally but somewhat downwards, which permits the vehicle to gain and then maintain altitude while increasing horizontal speed. As the speed grows, the vehicle will become more and more horizontal until at orbital speed, the engine will cut off. All current vehicles stage, that is, jettison hardware on the way to orbit. Although vehicles have been proposed which would be able to reach orbit without staging, none have ever been constructed, and, if powered only by rockets, the exponentially increasing fuel requirements of such a vehicle would make its useful payload tiny or nonexistent. Most current and historical launch vehicles \"expend\" their jettisoned hardware, typically by allowing it to crash into the ocean, but some have recovered and reused jettisoned hardware, either by parachute or by propulsive landing. When launching a spacecraft to orbit, a \"dogleg\" is a guided, powered turn during ascent phase that causes a rocket's flight path to deviate from a \"straight\" path. A dogleg is necessary if the desired launch azimuth, to reach a desired orbital inclination, would take the ground track over land (or over a populated area, e.g. Russia usually does launch over land, but over unpopulated areas), or if the rocket is trying to reach an orbital plane that does not reach the latitude of the launch site. Doglegs are undesirable due to extra onboard fuel required, causing heavier load, and a reduction of vehicle performance.[64][65] Rocket exhaust generates a significant amount of acoustic energy. As the supersonic exhaust collides with the ambient air, shock waves are formed. The sound intensity from these shock waves depends on the size of the rocket as well as the exhaust velocity. The sound intensity of large, high performance rockets could potentially kill at close range.[66] The Space Shuttle generated 180 dB of noise around its base.[67] To combat this, NASA developed a sound suppression system which can flow water at rates up to 900,000 gallons per minute (57 m3/s) onto the launch pad. The water reduces the noise level from 180 dB down to 142 dB (the design requirement is 145 dB).[68] Without the sound suppression system, acoustic waves would reflect off of the launch pad towards the rocket, vibrating the sensitive payload and crew. These acoustic waves can be so severe as to damage or destroy the rocket. Noise is generally most intense when a rocket is close to the ground, since the noise from the engines radiates up away from the jet, as well as reflecting off the ground. This noise can be reduced somewhat by flame trenches with roofs, by water injection around the jet and by deflecting the jet at an angle.[66] For crewed rockets various methods are used to reduce the sound intensity for the passengers, and typically the placement of the astronauts far away from the rocket engines helps significantly. For the passengers and crew, when a vehicle goes supersonic the sound cuts off as the sound waves are no longer able to keep up with the vehicle.[66] The effect of the combustion of propellant in the rocket engine is to increase the internal energy of the resulting gases, utilizing the stored chemical energy in the fuel.[citation needed] As the internal energy increases, pressure increases, and a nozzle is used to convert this energy into a directed kinetic energy. This produces thrust against the ambient environment to which these gases are released.[citation needed] The ideal direction of motion of the exhaust is in the direction so as to cause thrust. At the top end of the combustion chamber the hot, energetic gas fluid cannot move forward, and so, it pushes upward against the top of the rocket engine's combustion chamber. As the combustion gases approach the exit of the combustion chamber, they increase in speed. The effect of the convergent part of the rocket engine nozzle on the high pressure fluid of combustion gases, is to cause the gases to accelerate to high speed. The higher the speed of the gases, the lower the pressure of the gas (Bernoulli's principle or conservation of energy) acting on that part of the combustion chamber. In a properly designed engine, the flow will reach Mach 1 at the throat of the nozzle. At which point the speed of the flow increases. Beyond the throat of the nozzle, a bell shaped expansion part of the engine allows the gases that are expanding to push against that part of the rocket engine. Thus, the bell part of the nozzle gives additional thrust. Simply expressed, for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction, according to Newton's third law with the result that the exiting gases produce the reaction of a force on the rocket causing it to accelerate the rocket.[69][nb 2] In a closed chamber, the pressures are equal in each direction and no acceleration occurs. If an opening is provided in the bottom of the chamber then the pressure is no longer acting on the missing section. This opening permits the exhaust to escape. The remaining pressures give a resultant thrust on the side opposite the opening, and these pressures are what push the rocket along. The shape of the nozzle is important. Consider a balloon propelled by air coming out of a tapering nozzle. In such a case the combination of air pressure and viscous friction is such that the nozzle does not push the balloon but is pulled by it.[71] Using a convergent/divergent nozzle gives more force since the exhaust also presses on it as it expands outwards, roughly doubling the total force. If propellant gas is continuously added to the chamber then these pressures can be maintained for as long as propellant remains. Note that in the case of liquid propellant engines, the pumps moving the propellant into the combustion chamber must maintain a pressure larger than the combustion chamber—typically on the order of 100 atmospheres.[2] As a side effect, these pressures on the rocket also act on the exhaust in the opposite direction and accelerate this exhaust to very high speeds (according to Newton's Third Law).[2] From the principle of conservation of momentum the speed of the exhaust of a rocket determines how much momentum increase is created for a given amount of propellant. This is called the rocket's specific impulse.[2] Because a rocket, propellant and exhaust in flight, without any external perturbations, may be considered as a closed system, the total momentum is always constant. Therefore, the faster the net speed of the exhaust in one direction, the greater the speed of the rocket can achieve in the opposite direction. This is especially true since the rocket body's mass is typically far lower than the final total exhaust mass. The general study of the forces on a rocket is part of the field of ballistics. Spacecraft are further studied in the subfield of astrodynamics. Flying rockets are primarily affected by the following:[72] In addition, the inertia and centrifugal pseudo-force can be significant due to the path of the rocket around the center of a celestial body; when high enough speeds in the right direction and altitude are achieved a stable orbit or escape velocity is obtained. These forces, with a stabilizing tail (the empennage) present will, unless deliberate control efforts are made, naturally cause the vehicle to follow a roughly parabolic trajectory termed a gravity turn, and this trajectory is often used at least during the initial part of a launch. (This is true even if the rocket engine is mounted at the nose.) Vehicles can thus maintain low or even zero angle of attack, which minimizes transverse stress on the launch vehicle, permitting a weaker, and hence lighter, launch vehicle.[73][74] Drag is a force opposite to the direction of the rocket's motion relative to any air it is moving through. This slows the speed of the vehicle and produces structural loads. The deceleration forces for fast-moving rockets are calculated using the drag equation. Drag can be minimised by an aerodynamic nose cone and by using a shape with a high ballistic coefficient (the \"classic\" rocket shape—long and thin), and by keeping the rocket's angle of attack as low as possible. During a launch, as the vehicle speed increases, and the atmosphere thins, there is a point of maximum aerodynamic drag called max Q. This determines the minimum aerodynamic strength of the vehicle, as the rocket must avoid buckling under these forces.[75] A typical rocket engine can handle a significant fraction of its own mass in propellant each second, with the propellant leaving the nozzle at several kilometres per second. This means that the thrust-to-weight ratio of a rocket engine, and often the entire vehicle can be very high, in extreme cases over 100. This compares with other jet propulsion engines that can exceed 5 for some of the better[76] engines.[77] The net thrust of a rocket is where The effective exhaust velocity v e {\\displaystyle v_{e}} is more or less the speed the exhaust leaves the vehicle, and in the vacuum of space, the effective exhaust velocity is often equal to the actual average exhaust speed along the thrust axis. However, the effective exhaust velocity allows for various losses, and notably, is reduced when operated within an atmosphere. The rate of propellant flow through a rocket engine is often deliberately varied over a flight, to provide a way to control the thrust and thus the airspeed of the vehicle. This, for example, allows minimization of aerodynamic losses[75] and can limit the increase of g-forces due to the reduction in propellant load. Impulse is defined as a force acting on an object over time, which in the absence of opposing forces (gravity and aerodynamic drag), changes the momentum (integral of mass and velocity) of the object. As such, it is the best performance class (payload mass and terminal velocity capability) indicator of a rocket, rather than takeoff thrust, mass, or \"power\". The total impulse of a rocket (stage) burning its propellant is:[2]: 27 When there is fixed thrust, this is simply: The total impulse of a multi-stage rocket is the sum of the impulses of the individual stages. As can be seen from the thrust equation, the effective speed of the exhaust controls the amount of thrust produced from a particular quantity of fuel burnt per second. An equivalent measure, the net impulse per weight unit of propellant expelled, is called specific Impulse, I s p {\\displaystyle I_{sp}} , and this is one of the most important figures that describes a rocket's performance. It is defined such that it is related to the effective exhaust velocity by: where: Thus, the greater the specific impulse, the greater the net thrust and performance of the engine. I s p {\\displaystyle I_{sp}} is determined by measurement while testing the engine. In practice the effective exhaust velocities of rockets varies but can be extremely high, ~4500 m/s, about 15 times the sea level speed of sound in air. The delta-v capacity of a rocket is the theoretical total change in velocity that a rocket can achieve without any external interference (without air drag or gravity or other forces). When v e {\\displaystyle v_{e}} is constant, the delta-v that a rocket vehicle can provide can be calculated from the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation:[81] where: When launched from the Earth practical delta-vs for a single rockets carrying payloads can be a few km/s. Some theoretical designs have rockets with delta-vs over 9 km/s. The required delta-v can also be calculated for a particular manoeuvre; for example the delta-v to launch from the surface of the Earth to low Earth orbit is about 9.7 km/s, which leaves the vehicle with a sideways speed of about 7.8 km/s at an altitude of around 200 km. In this manoeuvre about 1.9 km/s is lost in air drag, gravity drag and gaining altitude. The ratio m 0 m 1 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {m_{0}}{m_{1}}}} is sometimes called the mass ratio. Almost all of a launch vehicle's mass consists of propellant.[82] Mass ratio is, for any 'burn', the ratio between the rocket's initial mass and its final mass.[83] Everything else being equal, a high mass ratio is desirable for good performance, since it indicates that the rocket is lightweight and hence performs better, for essentially the same reasons that low weight is desirable in sports cars. Rockets as a group have the highest thrust-to-weight ratio of any type of engine; and this helps vehicles achieve high mass ratios, which improves the performance of flights. The higher the ratio, the less engine mass is needed to be carried. This permits the carrying of even more propellant, enormously improving the delta-v. Alternatively, some rockets such as for rescue scenarios or racing carry relatively little propellant and payload and thus need only a lightweight structure and instead achieve high accelerations. For example, the Soyuz escape system can produce 20 g.[47] Achievable mass ratios are highly dependent on many factors such as propellant type, the design of engine the vehicle uses, structural safety margins and construction techniques. The highest mass ratios are generally achieved with liquid rockets, and these types are usually used for orbital launch vehicles, a situation which calls for a high delta-v. Liquid propellants generally have densities similar to water (with the notable exceptions of liquid hydrogen and liquid methane), and these types are able to use lightweight, low pressure tanks and typically run high-performance turbopumps to force the propellant into the combustion chamber. Some notable mass fractions are found in the following table (some aircraft are included for comparison purposes): Thus far, the required velocity (delta-v) to achieve orbit has been unattained by any single rocket because the propellant, tankage, structure, guidance, valves and engines and so on, take a particular minimum percentage of take-off mass that is too great for the propellant it carries to achieve that delta-v carrying reasonable payloads. Since Single-stage-to-orbit has so far not been achievable, orbital rockets always have more than one stage. For example, the first stage of the Saturn V, carrying the weight of the upper stages, was able to achieve a mass ratio of about 10, and achieved a specific impulse of 263 seconds. This gives a delta-v of around 5.9 km/s whereas around 9.4 km/s delta-v is needed to achieve orbit with all losses allowed for. This problem is frequently solved by staging—the rocket sheds excess weight (usually empty tankage and associated engines) during launch. Staging is either serial where the rockets light after the previous stage has fallen away, or parallel, where rockets are burning together and then detach when they burn out.[89] The maximum speeds that can be achieved with staging is theoretically limited only by the speed of light. However the payload that can be carried goes down geometrically with each extra stage needed, while the additional delta-v for each stage is simply additive. From Newton's second law, the acceleration, a {\\displaystyle a} , of a vehicle is simply: where m is the instantaneous mass of the vehicle and F n {\\displaystyle F_{n}} is the net force acting on the rocket (mostly thrust, but air drag and other forces can play a part). As the remaining propellant decreases, rocket vehicles become lighter and their acceleration tends to increase until the propellant is exhausted. This means that much of the speed change occurs towards the end of the burn when the vehicle is much lighter.[2] However, the thrust can be throttled to offset or vary this if needed. Discontinuities in acceleration also occur when stages burn out, often starting at a lower acceleration with each new stage firing. Peak accelerations can be increased by designing the vehicle with a reduced mass, usually achieved by a reduction in the fuel load and tankage and associated structures, but obviously this reduces range, delta-v and burn time. Still, for some applications that rockets are used for, a high peak acceleration applied for just a short time is highly desirable. The minimal mass of vehicle consists of a rocket engine with minimal fuel and structure to carry it. In that case the thrust-to-weight ratio[nb 3] of the rocket engine limits the maximum acceleration that can be designed. It turns out that rocket engines generally have truly excellent thrust to weight ratios (137 for the NK-33 engine;[90] some solid rockets are over 1000[2]: 442 ), and nearly all really high-g vehicles employ or have employed rockets. The high accelerations that rockets naturally possess means that rocket vehicles are often capable of vertical takeoff, and in some cases, with suitable guidance and control of the engines, also vertical landing. For these operations to be done it is necessary for a vehicle's engines to provide more than the local gravitational acceleration. The energy density of a typical rocket propellant is often around one-third that of conventional hydrocarbon fuels; the bulk of the mass is (often relatively inexpensive) oxidizer. Nevertheless, at take-off the rocket has a great deal of energy in the fuel and oxidizer stored within the vehicle. It is of course desirable that as much of the energy of the propellant end up as kinetic or potential energy of the body of the rocket as possible. Energy from the fuel is lost in air drag and gravity drag and is used for the rocket to gain altitude and speed. However, much of the lost energy ends up in the exhaust.[2]: 37–38 In a chemical propulsion device, the engine efficiency is simply the ratio of the kinetic power of the exhaust gases and the power available from the chemical reaction:[2]: 37–38 100% efficiency within the engine (engine efficiency η c = 100 % {\\displaystyle \\eta _{c}=100\\%} ) would mean that all the heat energy of the combustion products is converted into kinetic energy of the jet. This is not possible, but the near-adiabatic high expansion ratio nozzles that can be used with rockets come surprisingly close: when the nozzle expands the gas, the gas is cooled and accelerated, and an energy efficiency of up to 70% can be achieved. Most of the rest is heat energy in the exhaust that is not recovered.[2]: 37–38 The high efficiency is a consequence of the fact that rocket combustion can be performed at very high temperatures and the gas is finally released at much lower temperatures, and so giving good Carnot efficiency. However, engine efficiency is not the whole story. In common with the other jet-based engines, but particularly in rockets due to their high and typically fixed exhaust speeds, rocket vehicles are extremely inefficient at low speeds irrespective of the engine efficiency. The problem is that at low speeds, the exhaust carries away a huge amount of kinetic energy rearward. This phenomenon is termed propulsive efficiency ( η p {\\displaystyle \\eta _{p}} ).[2]: 37–38 However, as speeds rise, the resultant exhaust speed goes down, and the overall vehicle energetic efficiency rises, reaching a peak of around 100% of the engine efficiency when the vehicle is travelling exactly at the same speed that the exhaust is emitted. In this case the exhaust would ideally stop dead in space behind the moving vehicle, taking away zero energy, and from conservation of energy, all the energy would end up in the vehicle. The efficiency then drops off again at even higher speeds as the exhaust ends up traveling forwards – trailing behind the vehicle. From these principles it can be shown that the propulsive efficiency η p {\\displaystyle \\eta _{p}} for a rocket moving at speed u {\\displaystyle u} with an exhaust velocity c {\\displaystyle c} is: And the overall (instantaneous) energy efficiency η {\\displaystyle \\eta } is: For example, from the equation, with an η c {\\displaystyle \\eta _{c}} of 0.7, a rocket flying at Mach 0.85 (which most aircraft cruise at) with an exhaust velocity of Mach 10, would have a predicted overall energy efficiency of 5.9%, whereas a conventional, modern, air-breathing jet engine achieves closer to 35% efficiency. Thus a rocket would need about 6x more energy; and allowing for the specific energy of rocket propellant being around one third that of conventional air fuel, roughly 18x more mass of propellant would need to be carried for the same journey. This is why rockets are rarely if ever used for general aviation. Since the energy ultimately comes from fuel, these considerations mean that rockets are mainly useful when a very high speed is required, such as ICBMs or orbital launch. For example, NASA's Space Shuttle fired its engines for around 8.5 minutes, consuming 1,000 tonnes of solid propellant (containing 16% aluminium) and an additional 2,000,000 litres of liquid propellant (106,261 kg of liquid hydrogen fuel) to lift the 100,000 kg vehicle (including the 25,000 kg payload) to an altitude of 111 km and an orbital velocity of 30,000 km/h. At this altitude and velocity, the vehicle had a kinetic energy of about 3 TJ and a potential energy of roughly 200 GJ. Given the initial energy of 20 TJ,[nb 4] the Space Shuttle was about 16% energy efficient at launching the orbiter. Thus jet engines, with a better match between speed and jet exhaust speed (such as turbofans—in spite of their worse η c {\\displaystyle \\eta _{c}} )—dominate for subsonic and supersonic atmospheric use, while rockets work best at hypersonic speeds. On the other hand, rockets serve in many short-range relatively low speed military applications where their low-speed inefficiency is outweighed by their extremely high thrust and hence high accelerations. One subtle feature of rockets relates to energy. A rocket stage, while carrying a given load, is capable of giving a particular delta-v. This delta-v means that the speed increases (or decreases) by a particular amount, independent of the initial speed. However, because kinetic energy is a square law on speed, this means that the faster the rocket is travelling before the burn the more orbital energy it gains or loses. This fact is used in interplanetary travel. It means that the amount of delta-v to reach other planets, over and above that to reach escape velocity can be much less if the delta-v is applied when the rocket is travelling at high speeds, close to the Earth or other planetary surface; whereas waiting until the rocket has slowed at altitude multiplies up the effort required to achieve the desired trajectory. The reliability of rockets, as for all physical systems, is dependent on the quality of engineering design and construction. Because of the enormous chemical energy in rocket propellants (greater energy by weight than explosives, but lower than gasoline), consequences of accidents can be severe. Most space missions have some problems.[91] In 1986, following the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, American physicist Richard Feynman, having served on the Rogers Commission, estimated that the chance of an unsafe condition for a launch of the Shuttle was very roughly 1%;[92] more recently the historical per person-flight risk in orbital spaceflight has been calculated to be around 2%[93] or 4%.[94] In May 2003 the astronaut office made clear its position on the need and feasibility of improving crew safety for future NASA crewed missions indicating their \"consensus that an order of magnitude reduction in the risk of human life during ascent, compared to the Space Shuttle, is both achievable with current technology and consistent with NASA's focus on steadily improving rocket reliability\".[95] The costs of rockets can be roughly divided into propellant costs, the costs of obtaining and/or producing the 'dry mass' of the rocket, and the costs of any required support equipment and facilities.[96] Most of the takeoff mass of a rocket is normally propellant. However propellant is seldom more than a few times more expensive than gasoline per kilogram (as of 2009 gasoline was about $1/kg [$0.45/lb] or less), and although substantial amounts are needed, for all but the very cheapest rockets, it turns out that the propellant costs are usually comparatively small, although not completely negligible.[96] With liquid oxygen costing $0.15 per kilogram ($0.068/lb) and liquid hydrogen $2.20/kg ($1.00/lb), the Space Shuttle in 2009 had a liquid propellant expense of approximately $1.4 million for each launch that cost $450 million from other expenses (with 40% of the mass of propellants used by it being liquids in the external fuel tank, 60% solids in the SRBs).[97][98][99] Even though a rocket's non-propellant, dry mass is often only between 5–20% of total mass,[100] nevertheless this cost dominates. For hardware with the performance used in orbital launch vehicles, expenses of $2000–$10,000+ per kilogram of dry weight are common, primarily from engineering, fabrication, and testing; raw materials amount to typically around 2% of total expense.[101][102] For most rockets except reusable ones (shuttle engines) the engines need not function more than a few minutes, which simplifies design. Extreme performance requirements for rockets reaching orbit correlate with high cost, including intensive quality control to ensure reliability despite the limited safety factors allowable for weight reasons.[102] Components produced in small numbers if not individually machined can prevent amortization of R&D and facility costs over mass production to the degree seen in more pedestrian manufacturing.[102] Amongst liquid-fueled rockets, complexity can be influenced by how much hardware must be lightweight, like pressure-fed engines can have two orders of magnitude lesser part count than pump-fed engines but lead to more weight by needing greater tank pressure, most often used in just small maneuvering thrusters as a consequence.[102] To change the preceding factors for orbital launch vehicles, proposed methods have included mass-producing simple rockets in large quantities or on large scale,[96] or developing reusable rockets meant to fly very frequently to amortize their up-front expense over many payloads, or reducing rocket performance requirements by constructing a non-rocket spacelaunch system for part of the velocity to orbit (or all of it but with most methods involving some rocket use). The costs of support equipment, range costs and launch pads generally scale up with the size of the rocket, but vary less with launch rate, and so may be considered to be approximately a fixed cost.[96] Rockets in applications other than launch to orbit (such as military rockets and rocket-assisted take off), commonly not needing comparable performance and sometimes mass-produced, are often relatively inexpensive. Since the early 2010s, new private options for obtaining spaceflight services emerged, bringing substantial price pressure into the existing market.[103][104][105][106] Lists General rocketry Rocket propulsion Recreational rocketry Weaponry Rockets for research Miscellaneous Governing agencies Information sites",

                "content": "Dennis Schröder (German pronunciation: [ˈdɛnɪs ˈʃʁøːdɐ]; born 15 September 1993)[1] is a German professional basketball player for the Brooklyn Nets of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He previously played for SG Braunschweig and Phantoms Braunschweig in Germany, before joining the Atlanta Hawks for his first five seasons in the NBA. He is the sole owner of his German hometown team, Basketball Loewen Braunschweig of the Basketball Bundesliga, and had been the majority shareholder of the team since 2018.[2][3] Debuting for the German national team in 2014, Schröder helped the team to its first major medal in 17 years when Germany won bronze at the 2022 EuroBasket. In 2023, he led the national team to their first World Cup title at the 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup while being named the FIBA World Cup MVP. The following year, Schröder was the flag bearer for Germany along with judoka Anna-Maria Wagner at 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris.[4] He helped Germany to a fourth place finish and was named to the FIBA Olympics All-Star Five team. Schröder is the son of a German father and a Gambian mother, and has a brother and a younger sister. He and his brother were both heavily involved with skateboarding until he found basketball at age 11.[5][6] He started focusing on the latter career after his father died in 2009,[7] choosing to wear the jersey number 17 in his honor, as it was his favorite number.[1] His agent was former German basketball national player Ademola Okulaja.[8][9] Schröder started playing professional basketball in 2010 for SG Braunschweig, farm team of Phantoms Braunschweig. In his first season with SUM Baskets Braunschweig, he averaged 7.8 points, 2.1 assists and 1.6 rebounds per game in a second-tier German league. In the 2011–12 season he made a breakthrough, averaging 17.8 points and 6.7 assists over 23 regular-season games. His team went in the playoffs where he averaged 18.8 points and 5.1 assists over four games. In the same season, he also played 30 games for Phantoms Braunschweig of the German league, averaging 2.3 points, 0.7 assists and 0.8 rebounds in about 8 minutes per game.[10] In the 2012–13 season he played 32 games for Phantoms Braunschweig, averaging 12 points, 3.2 assists and 2.5 rebounds in 25 minutes per game.[11] For the season, he was named the League's Most Improved Player as well as Best Young German Player.[12] In 2013, Schröder was announced to play at the 2013 Nike Hoop Summit for the World Select Team. Before officially playing at the Nike Hoop Summit, Schröder decided to declare for the 2013 NBA draft.[citation needed] On 20 April 2013, Schröder led his team to a 112–98 win. He finished with 18 points, 6 assists and 2 rebounds in 29 minutes.[13] On 27 June 2013, Schröder was selected by the Atlanta Hawks with the 17th overall pick in the 2013 NBA draft. On 11 July 2013, he signed with the Hawks.[14] Schröder's minutes were cut due to frequent turnovers early in the season,[15] with Shelvin Mack taking over the second-string point guard.[16] He spent time in the NBA Development League in December, with the Bakersfield Jam,[17][18] and finished his rookie season playing in just 49 games for the Hawks, with 3.7 points in 13.1 minutes per game.[19] On 22 December 2014, Schröder scored a career-high 22 points in a 105–102 win over the Dallas Mavericks.[20] Schröder participated in the Rising Stars Challenge on 13 February 2015, recording 13 points, a game-high nine assists and three steals in Team World's 121–112 win over Team USA.[21][22] His performance was lauded by ESPN analysts as looking like a \"young Tony Parker\".[23] On 15 March 2015, he had 24 points and 10 assists in a 91–86 win over the Los Angeles Lakers.[24] Schröder had a \"breakout year\" in 2014–15,[25] increasing his averages to 10.0 points and 4.1 assists in 19.7 minutes per game, appearing in 77 regular season games with 10 starts.[26] Schröder continued to play behind All-Star Teague in 2015–16, making just six starts in 80 games. He averaged 11.0 points and 4.4 assists in 20.3 minutes per game,[27] shooting 42% from the field and 32% from 3-point range, leading to defenders often daring him to shoot the three.[25] On 20 February 2016, he recorded 25 points and 10 assists in a 117–109 overtime loss to the Milwaukee Bucks.[28] In Game 1 of the Hawks' second round playoff series against the Cleveland Cavaliers, Schröder scored a playoff career-high 27 points in a 104–93 loss.[29] On 26 October 2016, Schröder signed a four-year, $70 million contract extension with the Hawks.[30][31] He took the reins as the Hawks' lead guard in 2016–17 following Teague's trade to the Indiana Pacers.[32] On 8 November 2016, Schröder scored a then career-high 28 points in a 110–106 win over the Cleveland Cavaliers.[33] On 30 November 2016, he scored 14 of his career-high 31 points in the fourth quarter of the Hawks' 109–107 loss to the Phoenix Suns.[34] On 9 December 2016, he set a new career high with 33 points in a 114–110 win over the Milwaukee Bucks.[35] In Game 5 of the Hawks' first-round playoff series against the Washington Wizards, Schröder led the Hawks with 29 points, making a career-high-tying five 3s, and 11 assists in a 103–99 loss.[36] On 23 December 2017, Schröder matched his career high with 33 points, including 27 in the second half, to help the Hawks beat the Dallas Mavericks 112–107.[37] On 12 January 2018, he scored a career-high 34 points in a 110–105 loss to the Brooklyn Nets.[38] On 20 March 2018, he set a new career high with 41 points in a 99–94 win over the Utah Jazz.[39] On 25 July 2018, Schröder was traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder in a three-team deal involving the Hawks and the Philadelphia 76ers.[40] In his first season in Oklahoma, he was positioned as the team's sixth man, coming off the bench behind superstar point guard Russell Westbrook. In his debut for the Thunder in their season opener on 16 October, Schröder recorded 21 points, eight rebounds, six assists and three steals in a 108–100 loss to the Golden State Warriors.[41] On 7 November, he scored a then season-high 28 points in a 95–86 win over the Cleveland Cavaliers.[42] On 21 November, he scored a season-high 32 points off the bench in a 123–95 win over the Warriors.[43][44] On 1 February 2019, he scored 24 of his 28 points in the second quarter of the Thunder's 118–102 win over the Miami Heat.[45] On 3 March, he recorded 17 points and a career-high 11 rebounds in a 99–95 win over the Memphis Grizzlies.[46] His second season with the team saw him in the role of the sixth man yet again, this time behind veteran All-Star point guard Chris Paul and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. Schröder led the league in scoring off the bench with 18.9 points per game, while shooting a career-high 46.9% from the field, including 38.5% on 3-point field goals. He finished as the runner-up to Montrezl Harrell in voting for the NBA Sixth Man of the Year.[47] On 18 November 2020, Schröder was traded to the Los Angeles Lakers in exchange for Danny Green and the draft rights to first-round pick Jaden McDaniels.[48] On 22 December 2020, Schröder made his Lakers debut, putting up 14 points, 12 rebounds, and eight assists, in a 116–109 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers.[49] At the end of March 2021, there were rumors that he rejected the Lakers' contract extension offer of four years, $84 million to pursue a larger deal in the off-season as an unrestricted free agent which he later clarified that it was not true.[50][51][52] He was sidelined twice during the season due to the league's COVID-19 health protocols, including missing seven games late in the season.[51][53] Schröder started 61 games during the regular season, averaging 15.4 points and 5.8 assists per games and shooting 43.7% shooting from the field and 33.5% on 3-pointers. His numbers dropped in the playoffs to 14.3 points and 2.8 assists while shooting 40.3% from the field and 31.9% from three-point range, and the Lakers were eliminated in six games by Phoenix.[50][51] During the off-season, the Lakers traded for point guard Russell Westbrook, signaling that the Lakers would inevitably be moving on from Schröder.[54] On 13 August 2021, Schröder signed with the Boston Celtics, on a one-year, $5.9 million taxpayer mid-level exception contract.[51][55] The Celtics, who had recently moved on from starting point guard Kemba Walker via trade earlier in the off-season, were in search of backcourt depth and Schröder fit the bill at a much-discounted price than his rumored $84 million contract extension with the Lakers during the 2020–21 season.[56] Schröder chose to wear number 71 with the Celtics as his usual number 17 had been retired by the Celtics in honor of John Havlicek.[57] He became only the fourth-known player in the history of the league to wear the number 71 and the first since McCoy McLemore in 1965.[58] On 10 February 2022, Schröder was traded, along with Enes Freedom and Bruno Fernando, to the Houston Rockets in exchange for Daniel Theis.[59] On 29 March, Schröder was ruled out for the remainder of the season with a shoulder injury.[60] On 16 September 2022, the Los Angeles Lakers signed Schröder to a one-year, $2.64 million deal for his return to the team. Schröder chose the Lakers over the Toronto Raptors and Phoenix Suns citing \"unfinished business\" with the Lakers.[61][62][63] After completing his first practice on his second stint with the team, he claimed during the media interviews that the Lakers never offered him a four-year, $84 million contract extension that he was eligible to sign during the previous free agency before the start of the 2021–22 NBA season.[52] Schröder scored 14 of his season-high 32 points in the fourth quarter to lead the Lakers to a 112–109 win over the Miami Heat during their regular season game on 4 January 2023.[64] and on 20 January 2023, he put up 19 points, eight rebounds, eight assists, and made a game-winning layup in a 122–121 win over the Memphis Grizzlies.[65] Schröder was also a big factor in the Lakers struggling return to the playoffs after missing last year's playoffs. During their hard-fought play-in game on 11 April 2023 against the Minnesota Timberwolves, Dennis scored 21 points on 41.7% field goal shooting, along with 75% three-point shooting, making three out of four three-pointers which includes a clutch tiebreaking corner three-point shot off a kick out pass from superstar teammate LeBron James, following a drive on the opposite side with 1.4 seconds remaining in the regulation. He almost had a game-winner and the Lakers were up by three. However, his other superstar teammate Anthony Davis fouled Minnesota's veteran point guard Mike Conley Jr. on a catch-and-shoot, corner three-point, game-tying attempt with 0.1 seconds remaining. Conley Jr. made all of the free throws to tie the game and send it to overtime. But eventually, the Lakers still won the game as Schröder iced the win with two free throws with 8.4 seconds left in overtime, clinching the 7th seed in the Western Conference and successfully securing a spot in the 2023 NBA playoffs.[66] On 30 June 2023, Schröder signed a two-year, $26 million contract with the Toronto Raptors.[67] The deal took up Toronto's entire mid-level exception allowing the organization about $8.7 million below the luxury tax threshold.[68] It was Dennis' sixth team as he entered his tenth season in the NBA.[69] On 25 October 2023, Schröder made his Raptors debut, putting up 22 points and seven assists in a 97–94 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves.[70] On 13 December 2023, after a 135-128 win against the Atlanta Hawks, in which he had recorded 17 points, seven assists, and 3 rebounds, along with a block and a steal, Schröder achieved 10,000 career points.[71] On 8 February 2024, Schröder was traded alongside Thaddeus Young to the Brooklyn Nets in exchange for Spencer Dinwiddie.[72] On 10 February, Schröder made his Nets debut, putting up 15 points and 12 assists in a 123–103 win over the San Antonio Spurs.[73] Schröder has been a member of the German national under-18 and German national under-20 teams. He played in the 2012 FIBA Europe Under-20 Championship and helped the German team to fifth place, averaging 6.1 points, 2 assists and 1.8 rebounds in 14.6 minutes on the court. On 27 July 2014, he made his debut for the senior Germany national basketball team in a game against Finland.[74] Schröder played at EuroBasket 2015, in the group stage that was hosted in Berlin. Germany did not qualify for the knock-out stage and finished on the 18th place in the final rankings. He returned for EuroBasket 2017, leading Germany to the quarterfinals and averaging a team-high 23.7 points and 5.6 assists per game.[75] Schröder had expressed a desire to play for Germany at the 2020 Summer Olympics; however, the German Basketball Federation was unable to meet the financial insurance requirements.[76] He returned to EuroBasket 2022 and led Germany to third place,[77] being named to the EuroBasket All-Tournament Team in the process.[78] The run included a famous win over Greece in the quarterfinals, which had Giannis Antetokounmpo on the roster. Schröder averaged team highs of 22.1 points and 7.1 assists per game.[79] Schröder led the German national team to their first World Cup title at the 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup. The team went undefeated, defeating top-ranked teams such as Australia and the United States. After the final between Germany and Serbia, he was named FIBA World Cup MVP and to the FIBA Basketball World Cup All-Tournament Team, averaging 17.9 points and 6.7 assists per game.[80] At 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, Schröder was the flag bearer for Germany along with judoka Anna-Maria Wagner.[4] After going unbeaten in Group B and winning Greece in the quarterfinals, Germany lost to France, 69–73, in the semifinals. In the bronze medal game, Germany lost to Serbia 83–93. For his play, Schröder was named to the FIBA Olympics All-Star Five team.[81] Schröder is married and has three children.[82] Schröder became known earlier in his career for his \"signature\" patch of bleached blonde hair which he adopted upon leaving Germany for the United States.[83][84][85] It came at the suggestion of his mother who thought it would help people to recognize him in public.[86] Schröder is a devout Muslim.[1][87] He prays before games and before going to sleep.[1] Schröder is a teetotaler and has never consumed alcohol in his life.[1] Schröder missed games on two different occasions due to COVID-19 protocols in place. In May 2021, he said that he was the only Lakers player who had not been vaccinated against the disease.[88] After the Nets were eliminated from the 2024 playoffs, Schröder joined FC Germania Bleckenstedt soccer team of the German Landesliga Braunschweig.[89]",

                "title": "Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball - Wikipedia",
                "content": "The Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball program is the men's college basketball team of the University of Kentucky. It has eight NCAA championships, the best all-time winning percentage, and the most all-time victories.[2] The Wildcats compete in the Southeastern Conference and are coached by Mark Pope.[3] Adolph Rupp first brought Kentucky to national prominence, winning four NCAA titles. Since then, Joe B. Hall, Rick Pitino, Tubby Smith, and John Calipari each won a national championship, making Kentucky the only school with five coaches to win NCAA championships and placing it second only to UCLA for most titles. Kentucky has finished as the NCAA runner-up four times, making it tied with UCLA and North Carolina for all-time title game appearances at 12. The program has played in 17 NCAA Final Fours, tying Duke for third-all time behind North Carolina and UCLA. Kentucky leads all schools in several NCAA tournament stats: Elite Eight appearances at 38, Sweet Sixteen appearances at 45, total NCAA tournament appearances at 60, and tournament games played at 184. The program is behind only North Carolina with 131 NCAA tournament wins, North Carolina has 132. Kentucky has also won the National Invitation Tournament twice, making it the only school to win multiple NCAA and NIT championships, and it leads all schools in total postseason appearances at 68. Additionally, the Helms Athletic Foundation declared Kentucky the 1933 and 1954 national champions, the latter being Kentucky's only undefeated team in the modern era (post-1930). The 1948 NCAA champion team, coached by Rupp, represented the United States in the Olympics and won a gold medal. Kentucky was the first program to 1000 wins in 1968 and the first to 2000 wins in 2009. The program leads all schools with sixty-three 20-win seasons, sixteen 30-win seasons, and six 35-win seasons. Additionally, Kentucky is second among all teams in conference regular season championships with 53. Throughout its history, the Kentucky basketball program has featured many notable and successful players, both on the collegiate level and the professional level. Five players have been named national player of the year, with Anthony Davis in 2012 and Oscar Tshiebwe in 2022 being consensus selections. Three players have been named national freshman of the year: John Wall in 2010, Davis in 2012, and Reed Sheppard in 2024. Thirty-nine players have been selected as All-Americans a total of 51 times. Kentucky holds the record for the most overall NBA Draft selections (128) and three Wildcats have been selected as the first overall pick (Wall, Davis, and Karl-Anthony Towns). Thirty-nine players have been honored with jersey retirements, as well as Rupp, Hall, Pitino, Smith, equipment manager Bill Keightly, and broadcaster Cawood Ledford. Seven players have been enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Hall of Fame, as well as Rupp, Pitino, Calipari, Eddie Sutton, and Ledford. During Kentucky's earliest seasons the program went through multiple coaches, with the majority staying only one or two seasons. Records indicate that the first head coach of the Wildcats was W. W. H. Mustaine, who in 1903 called together some students, took up a collection totaling $3 for a ball, and told the students to start playing.[4] The first recorded intercollegiate game at the college was a 15–6 defeat to nearby Georgetown College. The team went 1–2 for their first \"season\", also losing to Kentucky University (later Transylvania University) but defeating the Lexington YMCA.[5] Through 1908, the team did not manage a winning season, and had an all-time record of 15–29. In the fall of that year a full-time head coach was hired, Edwin Sweetland. This made him the first paid coach in Kentucky's basketball history.[6] That year, the team went 5–4, and only three years later, boasted their first undefeated season with nine victories and no losses.[7] The 1914 team under Alpha Brummage, led by brothers Karl and Tom Zerfoss, went 12–2 and defeated all its Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association opponents. In 1919, George Buchheit became the new head coach of the Wildcats. An alumnus of the University of Illinois, he brought with him a new system of basketball. The \"Buchheit system\" or \"Illinois system\", focused on defense and featured one player standing under each basket, while three roamed the court. Bucheit varied the system he learned in Illinois in one important way. While the Illinois system employed a zone defense, Buchheit's system used an aggressive man-to-man scheme. On offense, he used a complicated system of passing called the \"zig-zag\" or \"figure eight\" offense.[8] Although the team had a losing season in Buchheit's first year, they won the first-ever Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association tournament the next year, defeating the heavily favored Georgia Bulldogs. Both of these teams were composed entirely of native Kentuckians, anchored by All-American Basil Hayden. The tournament victory was considered Kentucky's first major success, and the 1921 team became known as the \"Wonder Team.\"[9] In 1922, the team was unable to build on the success of the \"Wonder Team.\" Although every player was eligible in 1922, two key players, Hayden and Sam Ridgeway, were injured before the start of the season. Hayden returned from his knee injury during the season, but was never able to play at the level he had the previous year. Ridgeway fought a year-long battle with diphtheria, and although he recovered, never played for the Wildcats again. The remaining three members of the \"Wonder Team\" went 9–5 for the season, and bowed out of the SIAA tournament in the second round.[10] Buchheit remained as coach through the 1924 season before moving on to coach Trinity College (later Duke University). A different coach would guide the team for each of the next four years. C.O. Applegran immediately followed Buchheit, and his 1925 team posted a respectable 13–8 record. Applegran in college had played for the University of Illinois, where he became an All-American. The next year, Ray Eklund led the team to a 15–3 record, and produced UK's second All-American, Burgess Carey.[11] The record was enough for Kentucky to win their first regular season conference championship in the Southern Conference. Seeing the cupboard largely bare for the upcoming year, Eklund resigned shortly before the start of the 1927 season. The team scrambled to find a new coach, and former player Basil Hayden left his coaching job at Kentucky Wesleyan College to answer the call. An inexperienced coach and a roster largely depleted of talent left the Wildcats with a 3–13 record that year. The disappointment convinced Hayden that he wasn't the \"coaching type\", and he resigned after the season. Fortunately for the Wildcats, 1927 would be their last losing season for six decades.[12] The Wildcats' new coach for the 1927–28 season was John Mauer. Although he had a talented group of players moving up from the junior varsity team, Mauer quickly discovered that his players did not know the fundamentals of the game. He began a regimen of three-hour practices five days a week during the preseason. The practice began with half an hour of shooting drills and usually ended with a full-court scrimmage. Between the two, Mauer worked on skill drills and scenarios. Mauer's teams were nicknamed the \"Mauermen.\"[13] Teamwork was the hallmark of Mauer's system. Every player worked on every aspect of the game; there were no specialists. Like Buchheit, Mauer employed a strong man-to-man defense. He utilized a slow-break offense that relied on a complicated system of short passes to get a good shot. Two elements of Mauer's system were new to basketball in the south – the offensive screen and the bounce pass. The latter was so new to most of UK's opponents that it was referred to as the \"submarine attack.\"[14] Over his three-year tenure, Mauer led the Wildcats to an overall record of 40–14. One major prize eluded him, however. Despite having teams that were almost universally acknowledged as the \"class of the South\", Mauer never led a team to the Southern Conference title. Despite his innate ability for coaching, Mauer lacked the ability to heighten his team's emotions for a big game, a fault that was cited as the reason for his lack of tournament success. Mauer left the Wildcats to coach the Miami University Redskins following the 1930 season.[15] In 1930, the university hired Adolph Rupp, who had played as a reserve for the University of Kansas 1922 and 1923 Helms National Championship teams,[16] under coach Forest C. \"Phog\" Allen. At the time of his hiring, Rupp was a high school coach in Freeport, Illinois.[4] Rupp coached the University of Kentucky men's basketball team from 1930 to 1972. There, he gained the nicknames, \"Baron of the Bluegrass\", and \"The Man in the Brown Suit\". Rupp, who was an early innovator of the fast break and set offense, gained a reputation as an intense competitor, a strict motivator, and strategist. Rupp's Wildcat teams won 4 NCAA championships (1948, 1949, 1951, 1958), one NIT title in 1946, appeared in 20 NCAA tournaments, had 6 NCAA Final Four appearances, captured 27 Southeastern Conference (SEC) regular season titles, and won 13 SEC tournaments. Rupp's Kentucky teams also finished ranked No. 1 on 6 occasions in the final Associated Press college basketball poll and 4 times in the United Press International (Coaches) poll. In addition, Rupp's 1966 Kentucky squad (nicknamed \"Rupp's Runts\", as no starting player on the squad was taller than 6'5\") finished runner-up in the NCAA tournament, and his 1947 Wildcats finished runner-up in the NIT. Rupp's 1933 and 1954 Kentucky squads were also awarded the Helms National Championship, and his 1934 and 1947 teams were retroactively recognized as the national champion by the Premo-Porretta Power Poll.[17][18][19][20] Rupp gave the '44 team the nickname \"the Beardless Wonders\" and \"Wildkittens\" because according to Rupp, \"It was like running a Kindergarten\".[citation needed] Of the young players, Kentucky's best player was freshman Chad Anderson who, at the age of 17, was named consensus All-American, making him the youngest player to ever earn the title. The Beardless Wonders won 19 of their 21 games, enough to be invited into the NIT. There they were matched up with a Utah team nicknamed the \"Blitz Kids\".[citation needed] Both teams went into the half tied at 24, but with the help of Brannum Kentucky pulled away to win 46–38. Kentucky lost the next game to home town Saint John's.[citation needed] On the way to its first NCAA title, Kentucky went on to a record of 36–3. Of these three losses, all were either away or at neutral sites, keeping Kentucky undefeated at home throughout the entire season. Kentucky started off the beginning of the season with a 7–0 record heading into their away game at Temple. However, Temple was able to give the Cats their first loss by one point, 60–59. But the Wildcats rolled off an 11-win streak before playing at Notre Dame, where they lost 55–64. They did not lose a game for the rest of the regular season. Kentucky continued through the NCAA tournament to the finals, where they faced the Baylor Bears. Kentucky won its first NCAA title in a decisive 58–42 victory. The season did not end after the NCAA tournament, as Kentucky who would play in the Olympic Trials, where they went 2–1, only losing to the Phillips Oilers once. This was performance enough to represent the United States in the 1948 Olympic Games. Despite only being a college team, the starting 5 of Kentucky defeated all of its competition in London, making Kentucky the only team to win both an NCAA title and an Olympic gold medal.[citation needed] Adolph Rupp soon gave this team the nickname \"The Fabulous Five\", in honor of their accomplishments.[citation needed][21] For the 1949 season Kentucky had high expectations with most of the Fabulous Five returning. Big Blue Nation's expectations were met as the 1949 team won one more game than the previous year including both a SEC regular season and SEC tournament championship, while also getting back to the Final Four that March. In the finals Kentucky faced the Oklahoma A&M Cowboys, a team that had previously seen success in the tournament with back-to-back championships in 1945 and 1946. The Fab Five would succeed again winning 46–36 and Kentucky's only back-to-back NCAA championship. Kentucky was the second program in NCAA history to win back-to-back championships (there have been six other schools since). With a returning star player like Bill Spivey, Kentucky hoped to carry their success into the new decade. The Wildcats lost their first game by 11 to Saint John's at home, but they would pull it together for the Sugar Bowl Tournament, which they won, beating NCAA runner-up Bradley. After losing to Tennessee, Kentucky struggled to chain two wins together, losing every other game. They defeated their next 14 opponents, including getting revenge in SEC tournament championship over Tennessee. Heading into the post-season, No. 3 Kentucky played CCNY in the NIT, missing the NCAA tournament. The Wildcats were no match and were thrashed by the CCNY Beavers, 50–83. Over the season Kentucky defeated four top 10 teams, and were ranked in the top 5 the entire season. Vanderbilt, however, knocked off the top ranked Wildcats in the SEC tournament finals denying them an eighth straight SEC tournament title. Kentucky then defeated fourth ranked Kansas State 68–58 in the NCAA finals, . Adolph Rupp was the head coach at Kentucky during the year of the point-shaving scandal of 1951. In 1945 former Kentucky football player Nick Englisis met Kentucky player Ralph Beard while the two played football at Kentucky. Englisis entered the gambling business when he left the football team in 1946, then approached three Kentucky basketball players Ralph Beard, Alex Groza, and Dale Barnstable with his associates in late 1948 about potentially point shaving (fixing the score of games) during the upcoming season in exchange for money. The three players agreed to point shave and successfully shaved points in several games during the 1948–1949 season until an effort to point shave caused the Wildcats to lose to the Loyola Ramblers in the National Invitation Tournament. Groza, Beard, and Barnstable attempted to win the game under the point spread but kept the score too close, allowing the Ramblers to win the game with an impressive performance at the end of the second half. Kentucky faced Villanova in their first game of the NCAA tournament following the loss to Loyola and the three players attempted to win over the point spread. When Groza, Beard, and Barnstable failed to win over the point spread, it caused Englisis to lose all of his money and ended the point shaving deals between Englisis and these three players.[22] On October 20, 1951, Alex Groza, Ralph Beard, and Dale Barnstable were arrested for taking bribes from gamblers to shave points during several games including the National Invitation Tournament game against the Loyola Ramblers in the 1948–49 season.[23][24] At the conclusion of this scandal, a subsequent NCAA investigation found that Kentucky had committed several rule violations, including giving illegal spending money to players on several occasions, and also allowing some ineligible athletes to compete.[24] As a result, the Southeastern Conference voted to ban Kentucky from competing for a year and the NCAA requested all other basketball-playing members not to schedule Kentucky, with eventually none doing so.[25] As a result of these actions, Kentucky was forced to cancel the entire 1952–53 basketball season. Years later, Walter Byers, the first executive director of the NCAA, unofficially referred to this punishment as the first de facto NCAA death penalty, despite the current rule first coming into effect in 1985, thus the NCAA having no such enforcement power previous to that.[26][27] Echoing Mr. Byers' view, the NCAA's official stance is very much the same, and they now state in hindsight, \"In effect, it was the Association's first death penalty, though its enforcement was binding only through constitutional language that required members to compete against only those schools that were compliant with NCAA rules. Despite fears that it would resist, Kentucky accepts the penalty and, in turn, gives the NCAA credibility to enforce its rules.\" [28] The team posted a perfect 25–0 record in the next year (Rupp's only undefeated season), for which it was awarded the 1954 Helms National Championship. In addition, Kentucky also finished ranked No. 1 in the final Associated Press poll. On the team were three players who had graduated at the conclusion of the previous academic year. When, at the last minute, the NCAA ruled these players ineligible from post-season play, Rupp decided to skip the 1954 NCAA Tournament in protest.[citation needed] The \"Fiddlin' Five\" team earned their name though playing around and mistakes, which Rupp described as fiddling. The Fiddlin' Five still has the most losses out of any Kentucky's championships, with six, three of those were in four games.[citation needed] Unlike the Fab Five or the 1951 teams, the Fiddling Five would yoyo in the rankings with their lowest a No. 13 coming after 56–57 loss to unranked Loyola Chicago. Kentucky improved through the tournament though, and won their fourth title over No. 18 Seattle in the confines of Louisville's Freedom Hall. Rupp's last Final Four team and one of his last chances at a 5th NCAA title occurred in the 1965–66 season, with Kentucky going all the way to the NCAA title game. The 1966 NCAA championship game against Texas Western (now University of Texas-El Paso or UTEP) marked the first occurrence that an all-white starting five (Kentucky) played an all-black starting five (Texas Western) in the NCAA championship game.[citation needed] Texas Western won the game 72–65, on the night of March 19, 1966. Kentucky entered the tournament with only one loss and ranked No. 1, Texas Western also had only one loss and entered the tournament ranked second. Kentucky was a 6.5 point favorite in the game[29] The game was depicted in the film Glory Road.[citation needed] This game, and the result of it, were especially significant as the game came at a time when the civil rights movement was coming into full swing around the country. In 1969, after actively recruiting black players for over six years (his first formal scholarship offer was to Wes Unseld in 1964), despite most of the other SEC teams threatening to boycott if a black player took the court), Rupp finally signed his first black player, Tom Payne, an athletic 7'-1\" center out of Louisville. This ended the aspect of all-white Kentucky teams forever, and marked a new era with many notable black Kentucky basketball legends, including Jack Givens, Sam Bowie, Kenny Walker, Jamal Mashburn, Tayshaun Prince, Rajon Rondo, John Wall, Anthony Davis, and Karl Anthony Towns.[30] The late Rupp years looked promising with Dan Issel's commitment to the Wildcats in 1966. Over the next four years Issel scored an average of 25.7 per game, adding up to 2,137 points in his college career. This made Issel the player with the most points to ever play at Kentucky, a feat that has not been matched to this day. This included his 53 points scored against Mississippi State in 1970, the most by a Kentucky player in a single game until Jodie Meeks made 54 against rival Tennessee on January 13, 2009. Issel did not capture the national championship in his college years, but would go on to make a name for himself in the ABA.[citation needed] After 1966 Rupp saw continued success, but the Final Four eluded him. The Wildcats ended with a 13–13 season and missed the tournament altogether in 1967, then reach the Elite Eight and Sweet Sixteen in the next two years. Ranked #1 in the nation with a 26–1 record overall, Kentucky nearly missed a Final Four berth in a 106–100 shootout against Jacksonville. [citation needed] Rupp was forced into retirement in March 1972, after reaching age 70. At the time, this was the mandatory retirement age for all University of Kentucky employees. He was a 5-time National Coach-of-the-Year award winner, a 7-time Conference Coach-of-the-Year award winner, and was elected a member of both the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame and College Basketball Hall of Fame. Further, since 1972, the Adolph Rupp Trophy, considered one of the nation's premier basketball awards, has been given by Commonwealth Athletic Club to the nation's top men's college basketball player. In addition, the University of Kentucky retired a jersey in his honor in the rafters of Rupp Arena, a 23,500-seat arena named after him, dedicated in 1976.[17][18] Joe B. Hall was the head basketball coach at Kentucky from 1972 to 1985. Although he had been an assistant at Kentucky since 1965, Coach Hall was given a difficult task: to follow in the footsteps of his predecessor, Adolph Rupp. In the 1978 NCAA tournament, he coached the Wildcats to their fifth NCAA championship. He was named National Coach of the Year in 1978 and SEC Coach of the Year on four occasions. His record at UK was 297–100, and 373–156 over his career. Coach Hall won the title once in 1978, as well as making the final four in 1975 and 1984, and the elite eight in 1972, 1973, 1977, 1983.[citation needed] Coach Hall is one of only three men to both play on an NCAA championship team (1949– Kentucky) and coach an NCAA championship team (1978– Kentucky), and the only one to do so for the same school.[citation needed] The only others to achieve this feat are: After a year of playing in the freshman league and a disappointing sophomore season, Hall's Super Kittens returned with hopes of finally bringing Kentucky its fifth title. They nearly did just that, guiding Kentucky to a runner-up finish to UCLA in the 1975 NCAA tournament but not before avenging their 20-point defeat to an undefeated Indiana team. Despite losing in the championship game, it would give freshman Jack Givens a taste for success that would help propel Kentucky to the title three years later. It had been 20 years without a championship in Lexington, and along with pressure of following a hall of fame coach, Hall would nickname the 1978 season the \"Season Without Celebration.\" The pressure to win was immense on both players and coach to bring home the title, especially with a senior laden team that had gone to the finals as freshmen. Kentucky would hardly lose its composure all season or break under pressure, winning 30 of 32 games and defeating eight ranked teams along the way. By the time Kentucky reached the tournament finals they seemed bound to win the title, though Duke would give Kentucky their all. With the help of senior Jack \"Goose\" Givens' 41 points, Kentucky defeated the Blue Devils 94–88, and finally won their fifth title and first in 20 years. In 1985, Eddie Sutton succeeded Joe B. Hall. He coached the Wildcats for four years, leading them to the Elite Eight of the 1986 NCAA tournament. Two seasons later, Sutton and the 25–5 Wildcats captured their 37th SEC title and were ranked as the 6th college basketball team in the nation by the Associated Press and UPI[31][32] before losing to Villanova in the Tournament. Kentucky entered the 1988–89 season with a gutted roster. Ed Davender, Robert Lock and Winston Bennett had all graduated from school, while All-SEC sophomore Rex Chapman left school early to enter the 1988 NBA draft. Additionally, sophomore standout Eric Manuel was suspected of cheating on his college entrance exam and voluntarily agreed to sit out until the investigation was finished. Potential franchise recruit Shawn Kemp transferred out of Kentucky after signing with the school early that year.[33] Unfortunately, Manuel was forced to sit out the entire season as the investigation dragged on, essentially leaving the Wildcats in the hands of inexperienced sophomore LeRon Ellis and true freshman Chris Mills. The two underclassmen struggled to fill the talent vacuum on the court and the Wildcats finished with a losing record of 13–19, the team's first losing full-season record since 1927.[32] To add insult to injury, the NCAA announced at the end of the season that its investigation into the basketball program had found the school guilty of violating numerous NCAA policies.[34] The scandal broke when Emery Worldwide employees claimed to have discovered $1,000 in cash in an envelope Kentucky assistant coach Dwane Casey sent to Mills' father.[35] Later Emery settled a libel lawsuit filed by Casey for a substantial amount of money. Casey was not in Lexington when the envelope was supposedly mailed and the father of Mills said they received no money. The NCAA rescinded its show cause order immediately after the settlement of the lawsuit, and Casey's career has flourished as an NBA coach.[36] Another player, Eric Manuel, was alleged to have received improper assistance on his college entrance exams and was banned from NCAA competition. Whether Manuel was directly involved has been questioned.[37] Kentucky was already on probation stemming from allegations of an extensive scheme of payments to recruits, and the NCAA seriously considered hitting the Wildcats with the \"death penalty\", which would have shut down the entire basketball program (as opposed to simply being banned from postseason play) for up to two years. However, school president David Roselle forced Sutton and athletic director Cliff Hagan to resign. The Wildcats were slapped with three years' probation, a two-year ban from postseason play, the vacating of their two NCAA tournament wins in the 1988 season, and a ban from live television in 1989–90.[38][39] In 1989, Rick Pitino left the NBA's New York Knicks and became the coach at a Kentucky program reeling from the aforementioned scandal. Kentucky would be banned from the 1990 and 1991 post season, with the 1990 season suffering a 14–14 record. Kentucky would improve in 1991 with a beavy of home-grown upperclassmen such as Sean Woods, John Pelphrey, Richie Farmer, Deron Feldhaus, and Reggie Hanson along with the talented freshman Jamal Mashburn. Despite their record of 22–6, Kentucky was still banned from the post season and would have to wait another year to see the Unforgettables succeed in the tournament. Beginning with the 1992 season, Kentucky was free of post season bans. Though they lost one more game than last season, this team was most memorable for going to the Elite Eight (for the first time since Sutton's 1986 team) with many returning upperclassmen from Kentucky. The team is also known for playing in what could be considered one of the greatest games in NCAA tournament history against Duke. In this game defending champion Duke were looking to return to the Final Four once again, Kentucky for the first time in almost a decade. The game was hard-fought and physical on both sides all game including Laettner's infamous stomp on Aminu Timberlake, which resulted in a technical. The teams took the lead back and forth until the final minute of the game which resulted in a first buzzer beater shot by Kentucky's Sean Woods to take the lead 103–102, and then Laettner's shot to win the game for the Blue Devils in the final seconds 104–103. This team came to be known as the \"Unforgettables\" for helping put Kentucky back on the path to success in the 1990s and because the team was made up of home grown Kentucky kids. Kentucky returned a junior Mashburn, along with Travis Ford and Tony Delk. They were expected to reach the Final Four for the first time since Joe B. Hall's 1984 team. The expectations were right, as Kentucky would head into the post-season with only 2 losses and a No. 5 ranking. After winning the SEC Tournament once again, Kentucky stormed to the NCAA Final Four to meet up with Michigan's \"Fab Five\" a team of young and highly talented recruits that brought Michigan to the championship game the year before. As talented as Kentucky was they would fail to reach the championship game with a 78–81 overtime loss to the Wolverines. But this would be the just a glimpse of a run Kentucky would have later in the decade. Kentucky started the next season ranked #1 but would underachieve, falling short of the Elite Eight for the only time under Pitino. The highlight of the season was the \"Mardi Gras Miracle\", a game where Kentucky trailed LSU 68–37 with 15:34 left, but outscored them 62–27 over the remainder of regulation to win 99–95.[40] Starting in 1996, Kentucky would put together a string of Final Fours with help from 9 future NBA players. The \"Untouchables\" as they were nicknamed, would only lose twice, to Final Four bound UMass Minutemen (coached by former Kentucky coach John Calipari) and Mississippi State. It was with their overwhelming talent and chemistry that would win Kentucky their sixth national title in the 1996 NCAA tournament, Kentucky's first NCAA championship in 18 years. The following year, Pitino's Kentucky team made it back to the national title game, losing to Arizona in overtime in the finals of the 1997 NCAA tournament. Pitino's fast-paced teams at Kentucky were favorites of the school's fans. It was primarily at Kentucky where he implemented his signature style of full-court pressure defense. By the end of the Pitino era, Kentucky went from banned from the post season to going to three of the last five Final Fours and five of the last six Elite Eights. For this the 1997 team was dubbed the \"Unbelievables\" for taking a team that was not expected much of to return the Wildcats back to the championship game for a second time. Pitino left Kentucky in 1997 to coach the NBA's Boston Celtics, he then went on to coach Kentucky's in-state rival, the University of Louisville. Orlando \"Tubby\" Smith was introduced by UK Athletic Director C.M. Newton as the Wildcats' 20th head coach on May 12, 1997, charged with the unenviable task of replacing popular coach Rick Pitino. The Wildcats were at the top of the basketball world at the time, having won a national title in 1996 and, according to many, missing a second straight title in 1997 by the torn ACL of shooting guard Derek Anderson.[41] (Anderson tore his ACL in January against SEC foe Auburn; Kentucky lost the 1997 title game in overtime to the Arizona Wildcats.) The team Smith inherited sported seven players from the Arizona loss, and five from the 1996 championship team. However, since most of the players who had left after the 1996 and 1997 seasons were high NBA draft picks, his team had the lowest pre-season ranking since Kentucky came off probation in 1991.[42] In his first season at UK, he coached the Wildcats to their seventh NCAA championship, including a come-from-behind victory against Duke in the Elite Eight, and another comeback win against Stanford, then Utah in the Finals. His 1998 National Championship is unique in modern times, as being along with 1985 Villanova the 2nd team in over 20 years to win without a First Team All American or future NBA Lottery Pick (see 1998 NCAA tournament). The 1998 team was also unlike Kentucky's past two championship teams, often falling behind in games before roaring back to win rather than dominating their competition. Smith's teams, known primarily for a ball line defense-oriented slower style of play coined \"Tubbyball\", received mixed reviews among Kentucky fans who have historically enjoyed a faster, higher-scoring style of play under previous coaches. Smith was also under pressure from Kentucky fans to recruit better players. After leading Kentucky to one National Championship in 1998, Kentucky would complete a perfect 16–0 regular season conference record in 2003, win five SEC regular season championships (1998, 2000, 2001, 2003, 2005) and five SEC Tournament titles (1998, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2004). Smith led the Wildcats to six Sweet Sixteen appearances (1998, 1999, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2005) and four Elite Eight appearances (1998, 1999, 2003, 2005) in his ten seasons. He totaled 100 wins quicker than any other Wildcat coach before him except Hall of Famer Adolph Rupp, reaching the plateau in 130 games (John Calipari subsequently broke this record in 114 games). In 2003, he was named AP College Coach of the Year. In 1998, the reserve guard J.P. Blevins scored 9 points, all on 3-pointers sparking the Wildcats to come back from a 15-point deficit in the first half to upset the number 5 seed, Michigan State 60–58. Averaging only 2.2 points a game all season, Blevins was the unlikely hero for the Wildcats who were 6–4, to give the Spartans who were 8-3 an unlikely upset. Especially since they fell behind 26–11 in the first half.[43] Although Smith compiled an impressive resume during his UK career, he came under considerable pressure from many UK fans, who believed that his failure to achieve even a single Final Four appearance in his last nine seasons was inadequate by UK standards. He was infamously dubbed \"Ten Loss Tubby\" by several disgruntled UK fans. Smith's Final Four drought is the longest of any coach in UK history,[44] although Smith did come just a double-overtime loss short of another Final Four appearance in 2005. On March 22, 2007, Smith resigned his position of UK Head Coach to accept the head coach position at the University of Minnesota.[45] On April 6, 2007, Billy Gillispie was formally announced as the new head coach of the University of Kentucky by UK athletic director Mitch Barnhart. He fielded questions from the media during the press conference held at UK's new practice facility, the Joe Craft Center. He expressed his excitement and joy to be not only considered for the position but to have been given the honor and the opportunity to coach what former UK coach Rick Pitino referred to as the \"Roman Empire\" of college basketball. \"I'm very, very grateful and honored to be here, but we have a lot of work to do.\"[46] Gillispie became only the sixth head coach in the last 76 years at the school.[47] Gillispie's second season again started out rocky in 2008 as the 'Cats fell to Virginia Military Institute in their season opener. The second game of the season saw the Wildcats fall to North Carolina by 19 points. UK rebounded to win 11 of their next 12 games, improving their record to 11–3. On January 4, the Wildcats lost a heart breaker to archrival Louisville 74–71 after a 25 ft. shot by Edgar Sosa with 2.3 seconds remaining in the game. Prior to the shot, UK was down 7 with 38.5 seconds left, and Jodie Meeks was fouled shooting a three, proceeded to make all three free throw shots, Patrick Patterson stole an inbound and passed it to Meeks who laid it in to bring the game to 71–69 with 29.6 left, and then an inbound pass went long and Meeks snatched the pass, drove to the hoop and was fouled, and then made both free throws to tie the game at 71 with 22.9 left. So all in all, UK and Meeks got seven points in about 15 seconds to tie the game.[48] Kentucky disposed of Vanderbilt to win their SEC opener on January 10, 70–60. On January 13, in a road game against Tennessee, Jodie Meeks set a new Kentucky scoring record by dropping 54 points on the Volunteers. This total bested Dan Issel's 39-year-old scoring record by 1 point, and propelled UK to a 90–72 win and 2–0 start in conference play.[49] Kentucky followed up this effort with a 68–45 victory at Georgia, improving to 14–4 on the season. With wins over Auburn and Alabama, Kentucky moved to 5–0 in the SEC. On January 26, UK was ranked in the AP Poll (24th) for the first time since week 1 of the 2007–08 season.[50] UK promptly dropped 3 in a row (to Ole Miss, South Carolina, and Mississippi State) before rebounding at home with a thrilling 68–65 win over Florida. Jodie Meeks scored 23 points in the contest, including the fade-away contested 3-point basket with less than 5 seconds remaining to seal the win for UK. On Valentine's Day Kentucky handily defeated Arkansas at Bud Walton Arena 79–63 behind another strong performance from Meeks. Meeks contributed 45 points and helped UK win despite the absence of Patrick Patterson (sprained ankle). With the win, UK remained tied with South Carolina and Tennessee for 1st in the SEC East at 7–3.[51] Following the win UK completely collapsed, losing 5 of its last 6 games to finish the regular season 19–12 with an 8–8 SEC record. Entering the SEC tournament many felt UK would need to win the championship game to get into the NCAA tournament, but UK was defeated in the second game vs. LSU. With an unimpressive regular season and quick elimination in the SEC tournament, UK did indeed miss the NCAA tournament for the first time in 18 years and instead received an invitation to the NIT tournament where the team was defeated in the quarterfinal round against Notre Dame.[52][53] On March 27, 2009, an 18-minute-long meeting occurred between Billy Gillispie, President Dr. Lee Todd, Jr. and Athletic Director Mitch Barnhart, after which it was announced that Gillispie would not be returning as the head coach the next season. Barnhart stressed the firing was due to more than wins and losses, citing \"philosophical differences\" and \"a clear gap in how the rules and responsibilities overseeing the program are viewed\".[54] On April 1, 2009, John Calipari replaced former head coach Billy Gillispie as the Wildcats head coach. To begin his tenure at the University of Kentucky, John Calipari signed one of the best all time recruiting classes.[55] The class was headlined by four five-star recruits: John Wall, DeMarcus Cousins, Daniel Orton, and Eric Bledsoe.[56] On December 19, 2009, the Wildcats defeated Austin Peay 90–69 extending their record to 11–0, and John Calipari broke Adolph Rupp's record for the most consecutive wins to start a season for a first-year head coach at Kentucky. Kentucky defeated the Drexel Dragons 88–44 on December 21, 2009, to become the first program in college basketball history to claim their 2000th victory.[57] By January 25, 2010, Coach \"Cal\" had the Kentucky Wildcats ranked No. 1 in both the ESPN/Coaches poll and AP poll with a record of 19–0.[58] Calipari helped raise in excess of $1.5 million to aid the country of Haiti during the aftermath of the 2010 Haiti earthquake. President Barack Obama called the Wildcats to thank them for their relief efforts and wish them luck in their future endeavors. To finish off the 2009–10 regular season, Kentucky won its 44th SEC regular season championship (with a final 14–2 SEC record), and won its 26th SEC tournament championship, beating Mississippi State in the finals. The Wildcats then received a No. 1 seed (their 10th No. 1 seed in history) in the East Regional of the NCAA tournament, where they eventually lost to West Virginia in the Elite Eight. This also marked Kentucky's record 50th NCAA Tournament appearance. In 2011 the Wildcats got off to a good start in the regular season with a record of 12–2, with their only losses being North Carolina away and UConn in the Maui Invitational Finals. Conference play was a different matter, and Kentucky would struggle in the SEC losing 6 out of their 8 away games, all of one were against unranked opponents. To close out the season with a three-game defeat No. 13 Florida, No. 23 Vanderbilt and Tennessee at home for a 22–8 record. The hot streak would continue and Kentucky would win their 27th SEC Tournament Title. This was enough for No. 4 seed on the East regional where they played Princeton in a very close first-round game that ended in a 59–57 victory for the Cats. Knight, Jones and company would exact their revenge in the second round against West Virginia, who knocked off Kentucky in the 2010 tourney. In the Sweet Sixteen and Elite Eight they would upset the No. 1 seed Ohio State Buckeyes and No. 2 seed North Carolina Tar Heels on their way to the school's 14th Final Four. They lost in the Final Four to eventual National Champion No. 3 seed UConn 56–55. In the 2011–12 season, Calipari led Kentucky to being 16–0 in SEC regular season play, clinching its 45th SEC regular season championship. The last team to do so in the SEC was the 2002–03 Kentucky Wildcats, and before that, the 1995–96 Kentucky Wildcats. Kentucky's regular season record was 30–1, with its only loss being by one point coming from a 3-pointer buzzer-beater by the Indiana Hoosiers' Christian Watford at Assembly Hall on December 10, 2011. In the SEC Tournament, Kentucky fell to Vanderbilt in the championship game, making its overall record 32–2 going into the NCAA tournament. Kentucky was both selected as the No. 1 seed in the South Region and also the No. 1 seed overall of the entire NCAA Tournament. The Sweet 16 match-up on March 23, 2012, was a rematch against Indiana, in which this time the Wildcats prevailed over the Hoosiers 102–90. On March 25, 2012, Kentucky won the South Regional, setting up a Final Four semifinal with the Louisville Cardinals. Calipari's Wildcats defeated the Cardinals (coached by former Kentucky coach Rick Pitino) by a score of 69–61. This sent Kentucky to the National Championship game against the Kansas Jayhawks, where they defeated Kansas 67–59, winning UK's 8th NCAA championship, along with John Calipari's first NCAA Championship as a head coach. This Kentucky team had a record six players drafted in the 2012 NBA draft, including the first time two teammates have been chosen with the first two picks: Anthony Davis (1st overall), Michael Kidd-Gilchrist (2nd), Terrence Jones (18th), Marquis Teague (29th), Doron Lamb (42nd) and Darius Miller (46th). The 2012–13 season's recruiting class ranked either first or second by various recruiting experts led by top center Nerlens Noel, guard Archie Goodwin, forward Alex Poythress, and four-star center Willie Cauley-Stein. Kentucky also brought in transfer guard Julius Mays, a graduate student who had previously played at Wright State University and North Carolina State. Mays was eligible to play immediately, because UK offered a master's degree program that Wright State did not. However, the only returner that saw significant minutes from the championship squad was back-up power forward Kyle Wiltjer, who averaged 11 minutes per game (Ryan Harrow sat out the previous season after transferring from NC State before the 2011–12 season). Although the team saw the rise of Jarrod Polson in the first game of the season against Maryland, they struggled to close out closer games and play with the will to win that Calipari demands. On February 12, Noel tore his ACL in a loss against Florida. UK was 17–7 including that game, and went 4–5 the remainder of the season, losing all 5 games away from Rupp Arena. The fourth of those losses was against Vanderbilt in the first round of the SEC tournament, and UK missed the NCAA tournament altogether, being the overall No. 1 seed of the NIT. UK was upset by Robert Morris in the first round of the NIT, ending their season with a 21–12 record. In the press conference following the loss to Robert Morris, Calipari stated that his 2013–14 team would be a \"tough, hard-nosed, fighting team.\" Noel and Goodwin both entered the NBA draft and were both taken in the first round at 6th and 29th, respectively. Ryan Harrow transferred to Georgia State to be closer to his father that had suffered from a stroke, and Kyle Wiltjer transferred to Gonzaga. Kentucky brought in the No. 1 recruiting class, featuring a record six McDonald's All-Americans in Julius Randle, Andrew Harrison, Aaron Harrison, James Young, Dakari Johnson, and Marcus Lee, as well as Kentucky natives Derek Willis and Dominique Hawkins, and walk-on E. J. Floreal (son of Edrick Floréal, head coach of UK's track and field team). Alex Poythress and Willie Cauley-Stein did not declare for the 2013 NBA draft, and decided to return for their sophomore seasons. In 2013–14, Kentucky looked to make up for its struggles in the previous season. Despite making the NIT, there were high expectations for this team. The team, however, would be without some of its top players from the 2012–13 team including Nerlens Noel[59] and starting shooting guard Archie Goodwin,[60] who were first-round draft choices in the 2013 NBA draft. Starting power forward Kyle Wiltjer transferred to Gonzaga[61] and starting point guard Ryan Harrow transferred to Georgia State.[62] Returning was former McDonald's All-American Alex Poythress and starting center Willie Cauley-Stein.[60] The poor success of the 2012–13 team did not stop John Calipari from again producing another number one recruiting class. The entering class included a record six McDonald's All-Americans[63] highlighted by Julius Randle and the Harrison Twins from Texas, Aaron and Andrew. Many recruiting analysts and experts proclaimed that the 2013 signing class was the greatest recruiting class since the infamous Fab Five in the 1990s.[64] The team began the season ranked number one in both the AP and Coaches polls.[65][66] The season was full of ups and downs. Early in the season the team experienced close losses to Baylor, Michigan State, and North Carolina. Despite those losses the team was able to defeat in-state rival Louisville. Nothing changed in SEC play for them either. The team ended the regular season losing three of their last four games including once to South Carolina, who finished the season 14–20 overall. The team limped into the SEC tournament unranked, and desperately looking for any answer to their disappointing season. Calipari during his weekly radio call-in show mentioned the team was given a \"tweak\".[67] The \"tweak\" sparked speculation and curiosity among the fans and the media to what it could be. The \"tweak\" was never fully revealed. However, the \"tweak\" caused the team to go on an historic run through both the SEC and NCAA tournaments. UK was the runner-up to number one Florida in the SEC Tournament. During the NCAA tournament UK became the first team in history to eliminate three teams from the previous Final Four (Wichita State, Louisville, Michigan). UK was the National Runner-up after losing to Connecticut in the national championship game. After the 2014 season, Kentucky only lost Julius Randle and James Young to the NBA draft.[68][69] The returning players consisted of a record-tying nine McDonald's All-Americans. Juniors Cauley-Stein and Poythress returned with sophomores Aaron and Andrew Harrison, Johnson, and Lee to join the No. 2 ranked 2015 recruiting class which was highlighted of Gatorade Player of the Year Karl-Anthony Towns for the 2015 season.[70] The team began its season in the Bahamas on a six-game tour against international clubs and teams.[71] While in the Bahamas the team established a \"platoon system\" which featured two groups of five players that would rotate every four minutes within the game.[72] The \"platoon system\" was put on display nationally in a 72–40 victory over No. 5 Kansas in the Champions Classic in November.[73] In December, the team defeated UCLA 83–44. Kentucky led 41–7 at halftime, the lowest UCLA point total for a half in its storied history.[74] The SEC regular season began with two overtime victories over Ole Miss and Texas A&M, the closest games Kentucky would play all season. Kentucky finished the regular season with a perfect 31–0 record, the best start in school history.[75] In the SEC tournament, the team won each game by double digits, including a 78–63 victory over Arkansas in the finals. Cauley-Stein was named the MVP of the Tournament. In the NCAA tournament Kentucky played its first two games at the KFC Yum! Center in Louisville. Prior to the regional semifinal against West Virginia, Mountaineers guard Daxter Miles proclaimed that Kentucky would be 36–1 after the game. The comment fueled the team as they defeated West Virginia 78–39, tying the largest margin of victory in the Sweet 16 in NCAA Tournament history.[76] In the regional final Kentucky narrowly defeated Notre Dame 68–66. The only loss of the season was in the Final Four to Wisconsin, who Kentucky defeated the previous season in the Final Four. The 2014–15 team tied the NCAA record for most wins in a season (38).[77] After the season Cauley-Stein and Towns were named consensus All-Americans among other awards received. The Kentucky Wildcats represented USA Basketball, at Globl Jam 2023, and defeated Canada to win the gold medal. Following a first round upset as a 2 seed in the 2024 NCAA Tournament, John Calipari resigned his position of Head Coach to accept the same role at the University of Arkansas. He was officially announced as the Razorbacks Head Coach on April 10, 2024, marking the end of his storied tenure at Kentucky. On April 12, 2024, Kentucky hired BYU head coach Mark Pope for the same position in Lexington,[78] days after Calipari left for the vacant head coaching post at Arkansas.[79] Pope was a member of the Wildcats' 1995-1996 team that won the NCAA Tournament. The Wildcats have had 23 coaches in their 112-year history. Mark Pope is the current head coach. Six Wildcats coaches have won the National Coach-of-the-Year award: Adolph Rupp in 1950, 1954, 1959, 1966, and 1970, Joe B. Hall in 1978, Eddie Sutton in 1986, Rick Pitino in 1990 and 1992, Tubby Smith in 1998, 2003, and 2005, and John Calipari in 2012 and 2015. Additionally, seven Wildcats coaches have been named Southeastern Conference Coach-of-the-Year: Adolph Rupp in 1964, 1966, 1968, 1969, 1970, 1971 and 1972, Joe B. Hall in 1973, 1975, 1978 and 1983, Eddie Sutton in 1986, Rick Pitino in 1990, 1991 and 1996, Tubby Smith in 1998, 2003, and 2005, Billy Gillispie in 2008, and John Calipari in 2010, 2012, and 2015.[80] The following is a list of Kentucky's 8 National Championships: The NCAA began seeding the tournament with the 1979 edition. The * represents overall number one seed which began with the 2004 Tournament. Kentucky has 42 men's basketball players, coaches, and contributors honored in Rupp Arena with banners representing their numbers hung from the rafters. Due to the number of players honored, the fact that several of them have shared numbers, the numbers are not officially retired. Some of the jersey numbers were before the NCAA rule change before the 1957–58 season that outlawed teams wearing jerseys with a number higher than 5 on it that was not changed until 2023.[81] To have a banner hung, the individual must be elected to the UK Athletics Hall of Fame.[82] The following Kentucky players, coaches, and contributors have been enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. The following Kentucky players and coaches have represented their country in basketball in the Summer Olympic Games: The Kentucky Wildcats presently play their home games in 20,545-seat Rupp Arena. When it opened in 1976, it was the largest arena in the United States built specifically for basketball, and retained that status for much of the following 40-plus years. It was opened in 1976 and is named after legendary Kentucky head coach Adolph Rupp. Located off-campus, in downtown Lexington, the facility's official capacity was 23,500+[89] until a renovation project in the 2019 offseason reduced the capacity to 20,545.[90] The Wildcats have consistently led the country in home attendance since the 1976–77 season (when Rupp Arena first opened), winning the National Attendance Title a record 25 times, including 17 of the past 20 seasons, and 8 of the last 10 seasons. Kentucky also has an impressive 529–64 (.892) all-time record in Rupp Arena.[91] In 2007, the university unveiled the Joe Craft Center, a state-of-the-art basketball practice facility and athletics office building attached to the north side of Memorial Coliseum on the \"Avenue of Champions\" at the University of Kentucky campus in Lexington, Kentucky.[91] The 102,000 ft2 structure contains separate practice courts for the men's and women's basketball programs, separate men's and women's locker rooms, state-of-the-art video rooms for game film viewing, new coaches offices, a ticket office, and athletic administration offices.[92] As a result, Memorial Coliseum has more ample space for volleyball and gymnastics practice and games. The facility is named after businessman and philanthropist Joe Craft, a Hazard, Kentucky native, who pledged $6 million towards the completion of the $30 million project.[92][93] Coming off back-to-back national championships, the team moved to Memorial Coliseum in 1950. Nicknamed \"The House That Rupp Built\", the multipurpose facility cost $4 million and seated 12,000 people. It also housed a swimming pool, physical education equipment, and offices for the athletics staff. The team occupied Memorial Coliseum for twenty-six seasons, and sold out all 345 home games they played there during that period. Kentucky also played a 2009 NIT game at Memorial Coliseum due to Rupp Arena being booked. The Wildcats are 307–38 (.890) all-time at Memorial Coliseum.[89][91][94] Today, Memorial Coliseum is home to three UK women's teams—basketball, gymnastics, and volleyball. In 1924, Alumni Gymnasium was completed. It included seating for 2,800 people and cost $92,000 to construct.[95] Kentucky played 271 games at Alumni Gymnasium from 1924 to 1950, going 247–24 (.911).[91][96] After a major renovation completed in 2018, it is now a student recreation facility known as Alumni Gym Fitness Center.[97] Woodland Park Auditorium, opened in 1906 and closed in 1941, was located on the corner of East High Street and Kentucky Avenue in Lexington, Kentucky. Kentucky used this facility for home games during World War I between 1914 and 1916 going 15–7 there all-time.[91][98] The Wildcats played 84 home games at Buell Armory Gymnasium from 1910 to 1924. It was named for Union Civil War General Don Carlos Buell who was a member of the first board of trustees at Kentucky.[99] The armory was also used during World War I to teach truck maintenance and repair among other skills.[100] Kentucky was 59–25 all-time at Buell Armory Gymnasium.[101] The first home court for the Wildcats was simply called \"The Gymnasium\" or State College Gymnasium until 1910. It was located in the north wing of Barker Hall on the university campus. Constructed in 1902, it also housed the university's physical education classes until 1909. The facility had a capacity of 650 people, and with no bleachers or seats, fans had to stand to watch the games that were played there.[95] By the 1920s, it had become clear that \"The Gymnasium\" (by then renamed \"The Ladies' Gym\") was inadequate to house the university's basketball team. Records show Kentucky was 17–14 at State College Gymnasium.[91][100][102] (Of the 71 major categories listed above, Kentucky is No. 1 in 50 of them, No. 2 in 16 of them, No. No. 3 in 3 of them, No. 4 in 1 of them, and No. 8 in 1 of them.) Kentucky can also lay claim to several individual achievements for both players and coaches: Kentucky also holds several other NCAA records and various additional accomplishments:",

                "content": "Pachuca (Spanish pronunciation: [paˈtʃuka] ⓘ; Mezquital Otomi: Nju̱nthe), formally known as Pachuca de Soto, is the capital and largest city of the east-central Mexican state of Hidalgo, located in the south-central part of the state. Pachuca de Soto is also the name of the municipality for which the city serves as municipal seat. Pachuca is located about 90 kilometres (56 mi) north of Mexico City via Mexican Federal Highway 85.[1] There is no agreed upon consensus regarding the origins of the word pachuca. It has been loosely traced to pachoa ('strait', 'opening'), pachoacan ('place of government', 'place of silver and gold') and patlachuican ('place of factories', 'place of tears').[2] The official name of Pachuca is Pachuca de Soto in honor of congressman Manuel Fernando Soto, who is credited with the founding of Hidalgo state.[3] Its nickname of La Bella Airosa (\"the airy, beautiful\") comes from the strong winds that blow through the canyons to the north of the city.[2] In the indigenous Otomi language, Pachuca is known as Nju̱nthe.[4] The area had been long-inhabited; apart from some green obsidian, the mining that Pachuca is most famous for began in the mid-16th century, during Spanish colonial rule. Pachuca remained a major mining center until the mid-20th century, with the city's fortunes fluctuating with the health of the mining sector. In the mid-20th century, a major downturn in mining pushed the city to shift focus from mining to industry, resulting in the revamping of the Universidad Autónoma de Hidalgo. Today, mining forms only a fraction of the municipality's economy.[2][5] One cultural aspect that makes Pachuca unique is the influence of the Cornish miners who immigrated in the 19th century from Great Britain, as many of their descendants remain in Pachuca, and nearby Real del Monte. Furthermore, the Cornish populace helped to shape two local traditions that define the city—fútbol and a dish called \"pastes.\"[6] Evidence of early human habitation in this area is found in Cerro de las Navajas and Zacualtipán, in the Sierra de Pachuca. Here primitive mines to extract green obsidian, arrow heads, scraping tools, and mammoth remains can be traced back as far as 12,000 BCE. An ancient pre-Hispanic obsidian tool-making center has also been found in the small town of San Bartolo near the city. Around 2,000 BCE nomadic groups here began to be replaced by sedentary peoples who formed farming villages in an area then known as Itzcuincuitlapilco, of which the municipality of Pachuca is a part. Later artifacts from between 200 CE and 850 CE show Teotihuacan influence with platforms and figurines found in San Bartolo and in Tlapacoya. Development of this area as a city, however, would lag behind other places in the region such as Tulancingo, Tula and Atotonilco El Grande,[2] but the archeological sites here were on the trade routes among these larger cities.[5] After the Teotihuacan era, the area was dominated by the Chichimecas with their capital in Xaltocan, who called the area around Pachuca Njunthé. Later, the Chichimecas would found the dominion of Cuauhtitlán pushing the native Otomis to the Mezquital Valley. These conquests coalesced into a zone called Cuautlalpan, of which Pachuca was a part. Fortifications in the area of Pachuca city and other areas were built between 1174 and 1181.[2][5] This dominion would eventually be overrun by the Aztec Triple Alliance between 1427 and 1430, with rule in Pachuca then coming from the city of Tenochtitlan. According to tradition, it was after this conquest that mineral exploitation began here and in neighboring Real del Monte, at a site known as Jacal or San Nicolás.[2] The Aztec governing center was where Plaza Juárez in Pachuca city is now.[3] The Spanish arrived here in 1528, killing the local Aztec governor, Ixcóatl.[3] Credit for the Spanish conquest of the Pachuca area has been given Francisco Téllez, an artilleryman who came to Mexico with Hernán Cortés in 1519.[2] He and Gonzalo Rodriguez were the first Spaniards here, constructing two feudal estates, and calling the area Real de Minas de Pachuca.[3] Téllez was also given credit for laying out the colonial city of Pachuca on the European model but this story has been proven false, with no alternative version.[2] Mining resources were not discovered here until 1552,[7] and there are several versions of this story. The most probable comes from a work called \"Descripción Anónima de la Minas de Pachuca\" (Anonymous Description of the Mines of Pachuca) written between the end of the 16th century and the beginning of the 17th. This work claims that the first mineral deposits were found by Alonso Rodríguez de Salgado on his ranch on the outskirts of Pachuca in two large hills called Magdalena and Cristóbal.[2] This discovery would quickly change the area's economy from agriculture to one dependent almost completely on mining.[5] As early as 1560 the population of the city had tripled to 2,200, with most people employed in mining in some way. Because of this rapid growth and the ruggedness of the terrain, it was impossible to lay out an orderly set of streets. The first main plaza was placed next to the Asunción Parish, which is now the Garden of the Constitution. Next to the Cajas Reales (Royal Safe) was constructed to guard the fifth that belonged to the king.[2] In 1554, on the Purísima Concepción Hacienda, now the site of a tennis club, Bartolomé de Medina found the largest mineral deposits here as well as developed new ways of extracting minerals from ore using the patio process. This caused Pachuca to grow even more with the discovery of new deposits and accelerated extraction processes. Mining operations spread to nearby areas such as Atotonilco, Actopan, and Tizayuca. The population of the town continued to grow, leading Pachuca to be declared a city in 1813.[2][8] Mining output had waned by the 18th century due to flooding, but was revived in 1741 by the first Count of Regla, Pedro Romero de Terreros, and his business partner Jose Alejandro Bustamante, who invested in new drainage works.[8] He also discovered new veins of ore, mostly in nearby Real del Monte.[5] By 1746, Pachuca had a population of 900 Spanish, mestizo, and mulatto households, plus 120 Indian ones.[8] During the Mexican War of Independence, the city was taken by Miguel Serrano and Vicente Beristain de Souza in 1812, which caused the mines here to be abandoned by owners loyal to Spain.[5] The war left the Pachuca area in a state of chaos, both politically and economically. The third Count of Regla brought the first Cornish miners and technology around 1824.[2] The Cornish took over mines abandoned by the Spanish, bringing 1,500 tonnes of more modern equipment from Cornwall.[9] Cornish companies eventually dominated mining here until 1848, when the Mexican–American War forced them to sell out to a Mexican company by the name of Mackintosh, Escondón, Beistegui and John Rule. Mining operations resumed in 1850, especially in the Rosario mine.[2][5][9][10][11][12] Mining operations were disrupted again by the Mexican Revolution in the early 20th century. The city was first taken by forces loyal to Francisco I. Madero in 1911. Roberto Martinez y Martinez, a general under Pancho Villa, entered the city in 1915. Both incursions were due to the economic importance of the mines here.[5] During this time American investors came to Pachuca, again updating the mining technology used here. From 1906 to 1947 the United States Smelting, Refining and Mining Company was the primary producer here, with output reaching its peak in the 1930s. However, by 1947, mining here had become too costly, because of political instability, labor disputes and low prices for silver on the world market. The company sold its interests to the Mexican government in 1965.[2][9] The decline in mining here in the mid-20th century had disastrous effects on the city. Many of the abandoned houses and other buildings were in danger of collapse. Under ownership of the Mexican government, mining came to a near standstill. During this time Pachuca's economy began to shift from mining to industry. The old Instituto Científico Literario Autónomo de Hidalgo was converted to the Universidad Autónoma del Estado in 1961, which would become one of the impetuses to the growth of the city in the following years, turning out as it did a better-educated and more technical workforce in areas such as law, engineering, business and medicine. In the late 1950s and through the 1960s, some growth was seen in the way of suburban developments for workers in newly built factories.[2] Population growth returned in the 1970s and continued through the 1990s because of the growth of non-mining industries as well as a development of a large student population for the state university as well as other educational institutions. Another impetus was the movement of many government offices to Pachuca with new government facilities such as the State Government Palace and the State Supreme Court built in the 1970s. Much of the city's growth during this time was due to new housing projects, but infrastructure projects such as the new Municipal Market, the remodeling of the Plaza Benito Juárez and the main bus station also took place.[2] Pachuca has a semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification BSk). The climate is cool with high rainfall and occasional hail during the summer months and dry conditions during the winter. The coldest month is January, with an average high of 20 °C (68 °F) and an average low of 3 °C (37 °F). Winter nights are cold and the temperature can drop below 0 °C (32 °F). The warmest month is May, with an average high of 24 °C (75 °F) and a low of 9 °C (48 °F). Due to its high altitude, nighttime temperatures remain cool throughout the year. The average annual precipitation is 412 millimetres (16.2 in), mostly concentrated in the months May through September. In terms of extremes, the record high was 34.5 °C (94 °F) and the record low was −9 °C (16 °F). The city occupies a small valley and is almost completely surrounded by large hills, which are also covered in colorful housing.[2] The city centre has maintained most of its colonial-era structures, with narrow winding streets. Away from this centre is the more modern Pachuca, with warehouses, factories, supermarkets and a large football stadium called El Huracán (The Hurricane). The local team has won eight national and international titles here since it was built.[15] The city proper has a population (2005) of 267,751 which is 97% of the population of the municipality.[16] The Pachuca zona metropolitana (ZM) is one of the 56 officially defined areas for the 2005 Census (2010 not released) consisting of the municipalities of Pachuca de Soto, Real del Monte, and Mineral de la Reforma making a total of 7 municipios, with a combined population of 438,692 inhabitants as of 2005[update], up from 375,022 in 2000, covering 1202 km2.[16] Pachuca was declared the capital of Hidalgo by Benito Juárez in 1869.[15] Pachuca is center of one of the most important mining areas in Mexico, and for this reason, most of the city's attractions are based on the mining industry.[17] Many of these are located near Hidalgo Street, which is one of the oldest in Pachuca and runs alongside the arcade of the main plaza (Plaza de la Constitución) to Hidalgo Park. The oldest markets and houses are also located on this street, many of which are well-preserved.[18] The Monumental Clock of Pachuca is the icon of the city. Donated by Cornishman, Francis Rule,[12] it was built to commemorate the Centennial of Mexico's Independence, and was inaugurated on 15 September 1910 (Noche de Grito).[2] The base of the Reloj was made originally for a kiosk but it was decided to put the clock here instead.[17] A group from the city had the idea for the clock, and they, along with Mexican ambassador Jesús Zenil arranged to have the same company that built Big Ben, construct the inner workings. The outer monument portion is Mexican-made and was supervised by engineers Francisco Hernández and Luis Carreón. It is a tower with four parts in Neoclassic style, constructed of white \"cantera\" stone with a height of 40 meters. In the middle there are four sculpted faces of women done in marble by Carrara, which symbolise the Reform, Liberty, Independence and Constitution.[2] The Church and ex monastery of San Francisco were begun in 1596, and the church was completed c. 1660. The façade is in the colonial Spanish Baroque style. The interior conserves aspects of its 16th-century origins, including the groin vault. The church contains oil paintings by regionally well-known artists of the 18th century.[17] The sacristy has a beautiful ritual sinks in sculpted stone, one of which is decorated with Talavera tile from Puebla. It also has paintings depicting the genealogy and life of Francis of Assisi.[2][19] The adjoining cloister was completed in 1604. It has not been a monastery for many years, and had a number of subsequent uses. It had greatly deteriorated, until recently restored to house the Centro Cultural Hidalgo.[2] Behind the church is the Chapel of Nuestra Señora de la Luz. Built between the 17th and 18th century, it contains the only Churrigueresque altar in the city. This altar also contains the remains of the Count of Regla, Pedro Romero de Terreros.[1][17][19] The Museum of Photography and Photographic Library of INAH, and the Regional Museum, occupy much of the complex now.[17][19] The photography museum contains antique photography equipment as well as works by known photographers such as Guillermo Kahlo and Tina Modotti. To the east of the monastery complex is the Bartolomé de Medina Park. The City Theater and the School of Arts face the park.[19] The Asunción Church is the oldest in the city, constructed in 1553, and remodeled several times, with major reconstruction in 1719.[17][19] The Asunción Chapel has an entrance with two levels. The lower one contains the door and has a round arch, flanked by two pilasters and a Baroque architrave. The upper level has a choir window, with a niche above and topped by a pediment. The bell tower also has two levels, both with round arches.[2] The Bancomer Building is located at the front of the main plaza. It was designed in the Neoclassical style, and built in 1902. It was first occupied by the Mercantil Bank, then by the Hidalgo Bank and then was converted into the Niágara Hotel. Today it has returned to being a bank. It has a notable façade of brown cantera stone, lightly sculpted, with a keystone in the form of a parchment, cornice, Ionic columns and geometric designed in the upper parts. It is topped by a pediment which contains the figure of a lion.[2] The Cajas Reales was where miners paid a 20% share of their extractions to the Spanish Crown.[2] It not only collected the taxes, it was the only place that sold the mercury needed to extract silver from ore as a monopoly of the state.[19] It was constructed in the 17th century by viceroy Sebastián de Toledo Márquez Mancera. It is a two-story building with a central patio. The façade contains two towers that flank the main entrance and the north side to serve as guard stations for the building. It has housed the offices of the Compañía Real del Monte y Pachuca since 1850.[2][19] Emperor Maximillian I stayed here when he visited the city in 1865.[19] The Methodist Church building was built in the early 20th century, and is distinguished by its locally rare Romanesque Revival style. It is considered an important building of the Cornish period in the state. It remains a Protestant church and contains the Julián Villagrán School.[2] The Casa Colorado, part of the hacienda of the Conde de Regla, was built in the 18th century. It has an austere façade of a reddish colour, which gives the house its name. The building formerly had an interior courtyard with a Gothic style cloister arcade, but was demolished when enclosed. In 1886 Governor Francisco Cravioto acquired this building to house state judicial offices. The building served the judiciary through the mid-20th century. Many of the streets connecting from here to nearby Hidalgo Street are named after former notable lawyers and judges.[18] The Archivo Historico y Museo de Minería—Historic Archive and Museum of Mining is located on Mina Street in a manor that dates from the 19th century, called the Cajas de San Rafael.[9] The mansion is constructed of cantera stone and occupies a space of 950m2.[9] It contains documents that trace the history of mining here from 1556 to 1967, and the more than a billion ounces of silver and the five million ounces of gold that have been extracted from the state of Hidalgo during that time. The museum has three exhibition halls, a covered courtyard and a garden which contains mining machinery.[2] such as a steam shovel, a winch and a truck used for transport of ore.[19] The exhibition halls contain displays relating to how minerals are found in nature and the tools and processes used to extract them. It also houses a large collection of documents, a library and a photography laboratory. The documentation contained here was rescued starting in 1987. In 1993 the current site was renovated to house the collection. The collection also includes miners' personal effects, as well as artworks relating to mining.[9] The Museo de Mineralogía—Museum of Mineralogy belongs to the Universidad Autónoma del Estado de Hidalgo. The mineralogy museum is housed in the old Hospital de San Juan de Dios. It was built and operated by monks until 1869, when the state converted the building into the Instituto Literario y Escuela de Artes y Oficios. The museum exhibits a large collection of mineral specimens from the region.[2][19] The Municipal Palace or Conde Rule House is located on Leandro Valle and Morelos streets. It is a two-story building constructed at the end of the 19th century. The main entrance is flanked by two pilasters and topped with a pediment decorated with reliefs made of shells. It belonged to a rich Cornish miner by the name of Francis Rule, and later became the Municipal Palace.[2][19] The macromural of Pachuta is located in the Palmitas suburb. It consists of an entire quarter on a hillside painted in colourful murals. Formerly there was an English/Cornish neighborhood in the central part of Pachuca. The British Consulate is all that remains there, located in an \"English style\" residence built at the beginning of the 20th century. The Mercado de Barreteros is on the Central Plaza, and considered one of the most valuable architectural elements in the city. The lower level is dedicated to services such as cafés, and the upper floor is dedicated to arts and crafts shops.[19] The Monument of Christ the King is located on the Santa Apolonia Mountain and is one of the largest in Mexico.[17] The Archivo del Estado de Hidalgo—Museum of the State of Hidalgo is located in the Civic Centre of the State Congress. Its collection focuses on the history of the state of Hidalgo, through archival photographs and documents. Its collection also includes national history items. The Museo El Rehilete is an interactive museum for children with exhibits on archeology, botany, other sciences and the arts.[2] The Sede del Salón de la Fama del Fútbol—Hall of Fame of Football is in the shape of a football, and located in Parque David Ben Gurion of the Zona Plateada district. The Universidad de Fútbol—Football University is the only training facility of its kind in the Americas, and one of only a few in the world.[3] The Universidad Autónoma del Estado de Hidalgo was constructed over the old Hospital de San Juan de Dios.[1] It is the oldest educational institution in Hidalgo, brought into being at the same time as the state. The school was originally established as the Instituto Literario y Escuela de Artes y Oficios (Literary Institute and School of Arts and Letters) in 1869. The school was initially in a rented house but was moved to the former Hospital of San Juan de Dios in 1875. This building is now the Central Building. The school was based on positivist philosophy and the University motto of \"Amor, orden y progreso\" (\"love, order and progress\") remains to this day. The school was renamed the Universidad de Hidalgo in 1925 and again to the Universidad Autónoma de Hidalgo in 1948. The university was reorganized and expanded in 1961.[20] A more recently established school opened in 2003 is the Universidad Politécnica de Pachuca (Polytechnic University of Pachuca), which is mostly an engineering school. It was temporarily housed in the old Universidad Pedagógica Nacional buildings, but in 2004 the state of Hidalgo ceded the university the old Santa Barbara Hacienda, with 231 students studying classes in Mechatronics, Information technology and Biotechnology at the new facility. New programs of study in Physical Therapy, Software engineering, Optomechatronics, Information security, Information technologies and communications.[21] Beginning in 1824, Cornish miners and English investors came to Pachuca and the neighboring town of Real del Monte to invest and work in the mines here. Some founded the Compañía Real de Monte y Pachuca.[15][22] Mexico's remaining Cornish community represents a largely forgotten immigrant story. In the early 19th century, miners in Cornwall were enduring economic hardships. Ships carrying 125 passengers and some 1,500 tons of equipment sailed out of Falmouth, Cornwall, landing in Veracruz three months later. The treacherous 500-kilometre (300 mi) trek inland killed about half of the miners and their family members, many succumbing to malaria and yellow fever. Those who made it settled in Pachuca and Real del Monte. The immigrants brought technology, notably the famous high-pressure steam pumping engines designed by Cornish engineer Richard Trevithick, which turned many of the area's water-logged mines into huge silver producers.[22] The majority of the immigrants to this region came from Cornish mining areas of Camborne, Redruth and Gwennap.[23] Cornish/English workers and their technology revitalized the silver industry here and miners' remittances sent back home helped to build the Wesleyan Chapel in Redruth in the 1820s. Today the Pachuca – Real del Monte District retains much from its period of association with Cornwall and home of one of Mexico's most enduring cross cultural pollinations.[6][22] The miners' influence is obvious in architecture. Up in the hills around Pachuca, many houses feature distinctly British characteristics: thicker walls, square windows and pitched roofs.[22] Some of Pachuca's landmarks have English/Cornish influences. The Spanish Baroque style Reloj Monumental (Monumental Clock) chimes to the tune of Big Ben, and was financed by Francis Rule. The city's main Methodist church was built by Cornish miners. The English mining company's main office as well as the residence of Francis Rule of Camborne, the last Cornish manager of the Real del Monte mine, still bears his initials. The archives of the company are part of the \"Historic Archive and Museum of Mining in Pachuca\" (Museo de Minería) collections, and contain detailed records of Cornish employees, especially between 1824 and 1849.[6] The Cornish immigrants married into Mexican families, and even today Cornish surnames are not uncommon in this area with hundreds of Cornish descendants present. One example is Umberto Skewes, who speaks little English but whose grandfather came to Mexico from Cornwall. Skewes is custodian of the English Cemetery, which contains approximately 600 graves, predominantly of Cornish miners and their families.[6][22] The Cornish-Mexican Cultural Society works to build educational links between Mexico and the United Kingdom.[22] The group has marketed Pachuca and Real del Monte as \"Mexico's Little Cornwall\" through the Mexican embassy in London.[24] Cornish and English miners introduced to Mexico such things as tennis, golf, rugby, cricket, and chess.[6][24][25] However the two introductions which have had the greatest influence on Pachuca's identity are football and pastes.[6] In 1900 Cornish miners established the Pachuca Athletic Club, which was primarily dedicated to football. Their first game was played in the same year, a fact that is celebrated annually. The first team from Pachuca consisted of Charles Dawe, John Dawe, James Bennetts, John Bennetts, William Blamey, Richard Sobey, William Bragg, William Thomas, Percy Bunt, Lionel Bunt, Albert Pengelly and William Pengelly. The Pachuca club encouraged the formation of teams in Mexico City and Orizaba, the first championship of the new Liga Mexicana de Fútbol Asociación was played in 1902. Other clubs, such as the Reform Athletic Club, El British Club, F. C. and El México Cricket Club were also formed by miners. The first Mexican player appears in the ranks of the Pachuca club in 1908 and by 1915, most of the team was Mexican. Pachuca won the Copa Tower in 1908 and 1912, the precedent of the modern Mexican Cup. The team disbanded in the 1920s but was re-instituted in 1951.[6][26] Pachuca calls itself the \"Cradle of Mexican Football.\"[27] The Mexican Spanish word \"paste\" (pronounced PAH-steh) come from the Cornish word pasties, which is basically a semi-circular turnover made with a pastry crust with sweet or savory fillings. Cornish miners brought the recipe with them as they made a good way to bring their midday meal with them to the mines. One feature of both pasties and pastes is that they have a thick braided edge. Originally, this was done to provide the miners a way to hold the turnover without getting the filled portion dirty, as there was no way to wash their hands before eating. The shape and pastry portion of the turnover have remained the same but today, the fillings are decidedly Mexican: mole verde, beans, mole rojo, chicken \"tinga,\" pineapple, rice pudding and one seasonal specialty is a lamb paste with poblano chili peppers. Pastes are a local delicacy strongly identified with both Pachuca and Real del Monte.[6][28] The Feria de Pachuca is known colloquially by several names such as the Feria Tradicional/Internacional de San Francisco, the Feria de Hidalgo and the Feria de Caballo. It is the most important annual event in the state of Hidalgo, taking place every October in facilities located in the south of Pachuca. The festival began as a liturgical event sponsored by monks at the monastery of San Francisco in the 16th century, which eventually drew dignitaries from surrounding communities. The festival sponsors a number of events such as bullfights, cockfights, charreadas, horse shows, rodeos, crafts and folk dance shows, livestock exhibitions and features regional cuisine. It also host concerts by well-known Mexican musical artists.[2][28][29] Other notable events in the city include the Ramón Noble Guitar Festival and the Feria Hidaltur. The first presents concerts by guitarists of various genres from countries such as Brazil, Spain, the U.S., Israel, England and Mexico. There are classes and workshops by renowned artists as well as a national level competition for classical guitar.[30] The Feria Hidaltur is held in March and April with the purpose of promoting the arts and crafts of Hidalgo state. The festival also has equestrian events, hot-air balloons and other attractions.[29] Despite its decline in the 20th century, mining still continues to be an important element of Pachuca's economy. Pachuca still produces more than 60% of the state's gold and more than 50% of its silver. The Mexican Geological Survey is headquartered in the city. The manufacturing sector was established in the 1950s and has been steadily growing, changing the city's traditional mining image. Some of the major industrial employers are Applied Power de México (automotive parts), BARROMEX (machinery), Herramientas Cleveland (machinery and tools) and Embotelladora la Minera (soft drinks). The city also contains over 800 smaller manufacturing enterprises. The municipality's economy also has a large commercial sector, with numerous stores and thirteen public markets. It is also the wholesale center for foodstuffs for most of the state. Despite all the changes in the 20th century, the center of Pachuca has maintained its provincial feel. This has led the city to promote it as a tourist attraction.[2][5] The Pachuca Municipality is increasingly co-extensive with the city, as the city's metro area development grows to cover over 60% of the available open space. The municipality contains fifteen other communities, with all but two having less than 1500 people according to the 2005 INEGI census. Only three percent of the municipality population of 275,578 lives outside the city boundaries.[31] All of Pachuca’s mines worked silver ore which was dressed using the patio process, similar to at Real Del Monte. The last mine to close was El Álamo in 1993 .[34]",

                "title": "Who Is Karen Friedman Agnifilo? Luigi Mangione Hires New Lawyer - Newsweek",
                "content": "The suspect in the shooting death of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson, Luigi Mangione, has hired Karen Friedman Agnifilo, a former chief prosecutor at the Manhattan district attorney's office, to represent him when he's extradited back to New York. In an emailed statement to Newsweek on Saturday afternoon, Friedman Agnifilo's current law firm, Agnifilo Intrater LLP, confirmed that the Manhattan lawyer will represent the suspected shooter, adding that she will not be making any other statement at this time. \"Karen Friedman Agnifilo of Agnifilo Intrater LLP has been officially retained to represent Luigi Mangione in New York,\" her law firm stated. Mangione, 26, had retained the high-profile lawyer hours after Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg Jr. said Mangione might stop resisting his extradition to New York where he currently faces a second-degree murder charge in Thompson's death that occurred outside a Hilton Hotel in Midtown Manhattan on December 4. He was arrested at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania, on Monday where he faces forgery and weapons charges. \"Indications are that the defendant may waive,\" Bragg said at a news conference Friday afternoon. \"But that waiver is not complete until a court proceeding, which my understanding from court officials in Pennsylvania cannot happen until Tuesday.\" Friedman Agnifilo's tenure as a public servant—specifically at the Manhattan district attorney's office—will likely aid in her defense of Mangione. According to her online biography, Friedman Agnifilo, a graduate of the University of California and a 1992 graduate of Georgetown University Law Center, worked at the New York City office for seven years under then-District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. While there, she played \"a critical leadership role in prosecuting high-profile violent crime cases, including complex cases involving a mental health component, as well as cold case homicides.\" According to the Institution for Innovation in Prosecution (IIP), during her time as a chief assistant district attorney of the Manhattan district attorney's office, Friedman Agnifilo oversaw an office of approximately 500 lawyers, 700 support staff and roughly 80,000 cases per year. Before working for Vance Jr., she worked for former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg as general counsel to the criminal justice coordinator. She has also worked as chief legal analyst for CNN, which first reported the news that Mangione had hired her. In addition, Friedman Agnifilo is also the co-host of a weekly podcast on the Meidas Touch Network named Legal AF (Legal Analysis Friends) where she discusses emerging legal issues and litigation strategy. She is also the legal adviser for NBC's Law & Order. According to CNN analyst Jennifer Rodgers, who spoke on Friday's edition of The Source, Friedman Agnifilo is qualified to handle such a high-profile case, citing her many years a trial lawyer. \"So, really, what you want is a lawyer who can take you through the real case, right? The pretrial and, of course, the trial. And Karen is the sort of person with all of her many years of experience as a trial lawyer and in this actual courthouse and in this actual office. That's the sort of person you want,\" she said. Pennsylvania attorney Thomas Dickey had been hired to lead the defense of Mangione, who is currently being held without bail in Pennsylvania. Mangione has pleaded not guilty to the charges that he faces in the Keystone State and has been fighting extradition to New York since being detained. Dickey appeared alongside Mangione on Tuesday during an extradition hearing at Pennsylvania's Blair County Courthouse. An experienced trial lawyer in his 41st year of private practice, Dickey graduated from Altoona High School and Saint Francis University before obtaining his law degree from Ohio Northern University. Dickey has worked in private practice and with the Blair County Public Defenders Office. He is representing Mangione as private counsel. In addition to his courtroom work, Dickey has also acted as a legal analyst for CNN and other media outlets. Earlier this week, the New York City Police Department (NYPD) said Mangione's fingerprints appear to match those found near the site of Thompson's shooting. NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said at a news conference Wednesday that police were \"able to match the person of interest fingerprints\" with prints found on a water bottle and protein bar wrapper near the crime scene. She added that shell casings recovered at the site matched the 3D-printed gun that Mangione possessed when he was detained in Altoona. While Mangione has contested his extradition to New York, when he was arrested in Pennsylvania, a handwritten manifesto was also found in which he claims that he was acting alone and that he apologized \"for any strife of traumas\" that his actions had caused. The manifesto also said the United States has the most expensive health care system in the world and the profits of large corporations continue to rise while \"our life expectancy\" does not. It condemned corporations that \"continue to abuse our country for immense profit because the American public has allowed them to get away with it,\" adding, \"It is not an issue of awareness at this point, but clearly power games at play. Evidently, I am the first to face it with such brutal honesty.\" Update 12/14/24, 1:41 p.m. ET: This article has been updated with additional information.

                "title": "Purdue Boilermakers men's basketball - Wikipedia",
                "content": "The Purdue Boilermakers basketball team is a men's college basketball program that competes in NCAA Division I and is a founding member of the Big Ten Conference. Purdue basketball has the most Big Ten regular season championships with 26 conference titles, and in 2024 became the first Big Ten program to be ranked as the #1 team in America for three consecutive seasons.[2][3] As of April 2024, Purdue also holds a winning record against all other Big Ten schools in head-to-head match ups.[4][5][6] The Boilermakers have reached three NCAA Tournament Final Fours and two NCAA championship games, but have not won an NCAA Championship. The 1931–32 team was retroactively named a national champion by the Helms Athletic Foundation and the Premo-Porretta Power Poll.[7][8] Purdue has sent more than 30 players to the NBA, including two overall No. 1 picks in the NBA draft. Purdue's main rival is the Indiana Hoosiers. The history of Purdue basketball dates back to 1896 with their first game against the Lafayette YMCA, which they won 34-19.[3] In the 1902–03 season, head coach C.I. Freeman, in his only season, led them to an undefeated 8–0 record. Upon conclusion of the season, the university recognized the popularity of the sport and made it part of the Purdue University Athletic Association. The Boilermakers began play in the Big Ten Conference three years later, with its first championship coming in 1911 under the direction of Ralph Jones. In 1917, Ward \"Piggy\" Lambert, a former basketball player at Wabash College, was named head coach of the Boilermakers. What followed was one of the most dominant eras of Purdue Basketball on the conference and national level. Under Lambert, Purdue became a front-runner in the development of the fast-paced game as it is today. In 28 seasons, Lambert mentored 16 All-Americans and 31 First Team All-Big Ten selections, which included the 1932 National Player of the Year John Wooden. Wooden was the first college player to be named a Consensus All-American three times. Lambert compiled a career record of 371–152, a .709 winning percentage. His 228 wins in Big Ten play have been bested by only Indiana's Bob Knight, Michigan State's Tom Izzo, and former Purdue head coach Gene Keady.[3] Lambert won an unprecedented 11 Big Ten Championships, which Bobby Knight later tied for most in conference history. In 1943, the Helms Athletic Foundation retroactively recognized Purdue as its national champion for 1932. The Premo-Porretta Power Poll later recognized the Boilermakers as the 1932 national champion as well. Ward Lambert announced his resignation on January 23, 1946. That same year and the year following, under new head coach Mel Taube, Purdue won both meetings against coach John Wooden's Indiana State team. On February 24, 1947, three students were killed (one of whom died the next day) and 166 people were taken to hospitals after the 3,400-student section of the Purdue Fieldhouse collapsed during a game against Wisconsin. Center Paul Hoffman became the only Boiler to be named a First Team-All Big Ten selection four times in 1947. With third overall-picked teammate Ed \"Bulbs\" Ehlers (who played for John Wooden at South Bend Central High School), the two were the first players in the program's history to be selected in the NBA draft, while Paul Hoffman became the BAA's (original title of the NBA) first player named Rookie of the Year in 1948. After Mel Taube's four-and-a-half seasons, Ray Eddy, a former player and teammate of Wooden's under Lambert, took over as head coach. During his 15-year tenure, he coached Terry Dischinger and Dave Schellhase, both Consensus All-Americans, and Ernie Hall, the first Purdue junior college transfer and African-American player to wear a Boilermaker uniform. In 1955, his team played one of the longest games in college basketball history, lasting six overtimes in a loss to Minnesota. Over the next few decades the Boilermakers enjoyed moderate success, culminating in 1969 when they won their first conference title in 29 years and advanced to the 1969 NCAA Finals game under head coach George King and led by All-American Rick Mount, where they fell to former Purdue great John Wooden and his UCLA Bruins squad. Former Los Angeles Lakers coach/general manager, Fred Schaus, who also spent time as West Virginia's head coach, took over the program after George King stepped down to become solely the school's athletic director. Schaus led the Boilermakers to the 1974 NIT Championship, becoming the first Big Ten team to capture the NIT title. In the 1978–79 season, new head coach Lee Rose introduced Purdue basketball to a new approach with a slowed-down, controlled style of play. With All-American center Joe Barry Carroll, he led them to the 1979 NIT Finals and to a 1980 NCAA Final Four appearance. In 1980, Gene Keady, the head coach of Western Kentucky and former assistant to Eddie Sutton with the Arkansas Razorbacks, was named the new head coach of the Boilermakers. Over the next 25 years, Keady led the Boilermakers to six Big Ten Championships, 17 NCAA Tournament appearances with two Elite Eights and no Final Fours. Purdue received their highest Associated Press and Coaches Poll ranking in its program's history during the 1987–88 season, where they were ranked as high as 2nd in the nation. They were ranked 1st in the nation during the 2021–2022 season. In 1991, Keady and assistant coach Frank Kendrick recruited Glenn Robinson, who ultimately became an All-American and Purdue's second-named National Player of the Year. A few years later, Purdue managed to recruit the program's first of several foreign players when they picked up Matt ten Dam from the Netherlands. In December 1997, Keady became Purdue's all-time winningest head coach, surpassing Lambert with his 372nd win. He also became the second-winningest coach in Big Ten history behind Indiana's Bobby Knight, against whom Keady went 21–20 in head-to-head meetings. Soon afterward, the playing surface at Mackey Arena was named Keady Court in his honor. Many of Keady's former assistant coaches and players throughout the years have gone on to enjoy success as head coaches. Included in the Gene Keady coaching tree is current Purdue head coach Matt Painter, former St. John's head coach Steve Lavin, former Pittsburgh head coach Kevin Stallings, former Kansas State head coach Bruce Weber, former Wisconsin–Green Bay head coach Linc Darner, former UNC Charlotte head coach Alan Major, former Missouri and current Missouri State head coach Cuonzo Martin, former Missouri State head coach and current Purdue assistant coach Paul Lusk, and former Illinois State head coach Dan Muller. Following the 1998–99 season, the NCAA placed Purdue on two years' probation due to minor violations over recruiting, benefits, and ethics. Purdue also lost one scholarship per season for the 2000–01 and 2001–02 seasons. Most severely, Purdue assistant Frank Kendrick was found to have provided an illegal benefit to Purdue player Luther Clay, who transferred to Rhode Island after his freshman year, namely a $4,000 bank loan.[9] Clay was found to be ineligible due to his extra benefit, so Purdue forfeited all 19 victories in which Clay played, including one win in the 1996 NCAA tournament.[10] As the Keady era came to a close in 2005, the Matt Painter era began. Painter played for Keady during the early 1990s, with Keady naming him captain in his senior year in 1993. After one season at Southern Illinois as the head coach after Bruce Weber left north for Illinois, Painter was hired as a planned replacement for Coach Keady for the 2004–05 season as Keady's associate head coach. After a disappointing first season marred with injuries and suspensions from off-court altercations, Painter re-energized Purdue basketball in the summer of 2006 by signing the top recruiting class in the conference and made one of the biggest turnarounds in the program's history. His \"Baby Boilers\" developed into three eventual All-Americans, including 2011 consensus selection JaJuan Johnson, that led Purdue to four consecutive NCAA Tournaments and back-to-back Sweet Sixteen appearances, a Big Ten title, and a conference tournament championship. During the 2010 season, Matt Painter led the Boilermakers to a school record-tying 14–0 start, as well with the most wins in a season with a 29–6 record and a Big Ten title. The season ended in relative disappointment, however, as Junior Robbie Hummel was sidelined with an ACL injury in February of that season. The following year, and with the anticipated return of Hummel, E'Twaun Moore, and Johnson, Purdue looked poised to have one of its program's finest seasons. This excitement was quickly tempered when Hummel re-tore his ACL on the first practice of the season, sidelining him for its duration once again. Despite Hummel's absence, Purdue remained in the top ten most of the season, being ranked as high as 6th and finished the regular season with a 26–8 record. At the conclusion of the 2010–2011 season, Johnson and Moore declared for the NBA draft. On June 23, 2011, both Johnson and Moore were drafted to the Boston Celtics in the first and second rounds, respectively. Purdue began the 2012 season with a 12–3 record, holding the fifth best home winning streak in the nation with 27, before leading the nation with the fewest turnover average per game. The home winning streak was lost during the 2012 season to Alabama. They finished with a 10–8 conference record, giving Purdue its sixth consecutive 22+ win season, the best in the program's history. In the 2012 NBA draft, Robbie Hummel was the 58th overall pick by the Minnesota Timberwolves. The following two seasons brought slim success, missing out on both the NCAA Tournament and the NIT. They accepted a bid in the 2013 CBI, where they lost in the second round to Santa Clara. After a moderate 8–5 preseason campaign during the 2015 season, Purdue got back on track, finishing 3rd in the conference after finishing last the season prior. The 2015 season ended after losing to Cincinnati in overtime. It was the first time the program lost its opener in the NCAA Tournament since 1993, breaking a 14-game win streak. After making it back to the NCAA tourney, the program landed its biggest recruit in nearly a quarter century when Fort Wayne native Caleb Swanigan, a top ten recruit, de-committed from Michigan State. They opened the 2016 season with an 11–0 record, while setting a program record with consecutive double-digit victories and were ranked as high as 9th in the nation. That season ended with an NCAA First Round loss to Little Rock with a 26–9 record. In May 2016, it was announced that the 2017–18 Purdue team would represent the U.S. at the 2017 World University Games in Taipei.[11] The team went on to win the silver medal at the Games, winning every game until losing to Lithuania in the gold medal game. Purdue won the outright 2017 Big Ten Conference title, along with Caleb Swanigan being named unanimous B1G Player of the Year. In the 2017 NCAA Tournament, Purdue reached the Sweet Sixteen, losing to #1 seed Kansas. In the 2017–2018 season, Purdue, led by seniors Vince Edwards, Isaac Haas, PJ Thompson, Dakota Mathias and sophomore Carsen Edwards, spent several weeks at #3 while being on a program record and nation-leading 19-game winning streak. During that time, the Boilers led the nation in scoring margin, points per game, three-point shooting, and was one of only two teams with a top 3 ranking in both offensive and defensive efficiency. Purdue missed out on a consecutive B1G title after losing to Wisconsin, finishing 2nd in the conference at 15–3. The Boilers were seeded 4th in the Big Ten tournament, where they beat Rutgers and Penn State to reach the Big Ten tournament Championship for the second time in three years. They faced a familiar opponent in Michigan, whom they had already faced two other times throughout that season, Purdue winning both meetings. However, Michigan beat Purdue 75–66 to become Big Ten tournament Champions for the second straight season. Purdue was seeded 2nd in the East Region of the 2018 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, their highest seed in recent history. In the first round, they faced Cal State Fullerton Titans, winning 74–48. However, many Purdue fan's hearts broke in the second half of the game, as senior Center Isaac Haas fell on his elbow as he fought for a rebound, and broke his elbow as he hit the ground, ending his Purdue Basketball career. Purdue's second-round game was against Butler Bulldogs, whom Purdue had already played earlier in the season. The Boilers won the game on a last second shot by Dakota Mathias, winning 76–73 to advance to the Sweet Sixteen for the second straight season. In the Sweet Sixteen, Purdue faced the third seeded Texas Tech Red Raiders. The Boilers went on to lose in disappointing fashion 65–78, ending their season with 30 wins. In 2019, Purdue was seeded 3rd in the South Region of the 2019 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, after another strong season. In the first round, they eliminated a 26–8 Old Dominion team that was coming off a Conference USA championship, winning 61–48. In the second round, they handily defeated #6 seed Villanova, sending the defending champs home early after an 87–61 victory, and advancing to their third straight Sweet Sixteen under Matt Painter. The Boilermakers ran into their first real test with the #2 Tennessee Volunteers. After a back and forth contest that included 17 lead changes and needed overtime to be decided, Purdue came out victorious, barely beating the Vols 99–94 to reach their first Elite Eight in nearly 20 years. In the Elite Eight, Purdue faced the #1 seeded Virginia Cavaliers in what was another back and forth thriller. After several lead changes throughout the game, and a 40-point effort from Carsen Edwards including 10 made 3s, Purdue led 70–67 with 5.9 seconds left and looked to be headed to their first Final Four since 1980. Virginia's Ty Jerome was fouled intentionally, and missed the second free throw of two after making the first. Virginia was able to come up with the offensive rebound, and after chasing down the loose ball that had gone into the Virginia back court, toss the ball to Mamadi Diakite who hit a free-throw line floater at the buzzer to send the game to overtime tied at 70. The Boilermakers once again looked to be en route to the Final Four, leading 75–74 with 43 seconds to go. However Virginia was able to hold Purdue scoreless over the final minute and prevailed 80–75, ending the Boilermakers season with 26 wins and their first Elite Eight appearance since 2000. After the cancellation of the 2020 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, Purdue picked up where they had left off in 2019, only this time they were the 4th seed in the South region of the 2021 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. Their first-round matchup was against 13th-seeded North Texas, where they came back from behind 32–24 at the half to send the game to OT. Ultimately, once there, Purdue couldn't score until the last 30 seconds of overtime, and North Texas pulled off the 78–69 upset. The 2022 season saw the Boilermakers reach #1 in the AP Poll for the first time in program history, led by senior Trevion Williams, and All-American sophomore guard Jaden Ivey. In the 2022 tournament, Purdue reached the Sweet Sixteen after a second round win over Texas, only to lose to the Cinderella story of that year's tournament, the 15-seeded Saint Peter's Peacocks. The following year, Purdue put together a 29–5 season that again had them reach #1 in the AP poll at various points in the season, and saw them win the Big 10 regular-season championship for a record extending 25th time, and postseason tournament championship for the first time since 2009, leading to a #1 seed in the East Region of the 2023 NCAA Tournament. Center Zach Edey was also voted the third player in Purdue history to win National Player of the Year honors. Purdue would then became the second team in NCAA Tournament history to be upset by a 16-seed, falling 63–58 to Fairleigh Dickinson in the First Round, suffering the biggest upset in NCAA tournament history with Purdue being 23+1⁄2-point favorites heading into the game. The 2024 season was more of the same in West Lafayette, with the Boilermakers winning their second consecutive outright Big Ten regular season championship, extending their Big Ten record to 26 titles. Zach Edey was named National Player of the Year unanimously for the second straight season, becoming the first men's college basketball player to win the award in back-to-back years since Ralph Sampson in 1983. Purdue was awarded a #1 seed for the second consecutive year in the 2024 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, this time in the Midwest Region. They cruised into the Sweet Sixteen with routs against 16 seed Grambling State, 78–50, and 8 seed Utah State, 106–67. With the victory against Utah State, they achieved their 31st win of the season, breaking the program record of most wins in a season. They then defeated 5 seed Gonzaga in Detroit 80–68, following a second-half surge, and moved on to the Elite Eight for the first time since 2019. There the Boilermakers met a familiar foe in the tournament on Easter Sunday, the 2 seeded Tennessee Volunteers, led by in many around the nation's opinion the second best player in the country, Dalton Knecht. Zach Edey scored 40 points to go along with 16 rebounds, leading the Boilermakers to a thrilling 72–66 victory and a trip to the Final Four in Phoenix, the first under Matt Painter's tenure and the first since 1980. The victory was a monumental day in the history of Purdue Men's basketball, with many in and around the team signifying the win as a watershed moment for the program by getting back to the Final Four after years of underachieving in the NCAA tournament. Former All-American Robbie Hummel was on the sideline for the radio broadcast of the game, and was moved to tears when embracing members of the Purdue coaching staff post game, including his former head coach Matt Painter. Following the long awaited trip to the Final Four in Phoenix, the Boilermakers faced off against surprise tournament Cinderella NC State led in part by tournament darling big man D. J. Burns. The Boilermakers controlled the game throughout and pulled away in the second half to win their first Final Four game since 1969 by a score of 63-50, advancing to the National Championship game for the first time in 55 years. There Purdue would eventually find the defending national champion UConn Huskies after their victory over Alabama in the later of the 2 Final Four games. The 2024 NCAA Tournament would come down to a match up of two All-American level 7 footers, as UConn came into the championship game led in part by 7 foot 2 Donovan Clingan, leading to the game being billed as a matchup of 2 twin towers at the center position. Purdue kept the game close for most of the first half after entering the game a 6 point underdog, but was unable to rely on their usual three point shooting prowess (Going 1 for 7 from three point range) as UConn's elite perimeter defense made it difficult to convert their usual amount of three point shots. Zach Edey scored 37 points to go along with 10 rebounds in his final game at Purdue, but UConn pulled away in the second half to win their second consecutive national title 75-60. Following the conclusion of the season, Zach Edey would declare for the 2024 NBA Draft, leaving the program as Purdue's all-time leader in points, rebounds, and field goal percentage.

                "title": "Blue Bloods (TV series) - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Blue Bloods was an American police procedural drama television series that aired on CBS from September 24, 2010 until December 13, 2024, across 14 seasons and 293 episodes. Its main characters were members of the fictional Reagan family, an American, Irish Catholic family in New York City with a history of work in law enforcement. Blue Bloods starred Tom Selleck as New York City Police Commissioner Frank Reagan; other main cast members include Donnie Wahlberg, Bridget Moynahan, Will Estes and Len Cariou for all 14 seasons, plus Amy Carlson (seasons 1–7), Sami Gayle (seasons 1–10) as well as Marisa Ramirez (regular since season 4) and Vanessa Ray (regular since season 5). The show was filmed on location in New York City with references to suburban areas as well.[1][2] Selleck has called the New York City setting \"another character\" on the show.[3][4][5] The series debuted on September 24, 2010,[6] with episodes airing on Fridays following CSI: NY before being moved to Wednesdays at 10:00 p.m. Eastern and Pacific time and 9:00 p.m. Central and Mountain time for a four-week tryout. After four weeks, it returned to its original Friday 10:00 p.m. Eastern time slot, where it has remained since. On March 29, 2023, CBS announced the show had been renewed for a fourteenth season, with the cast and producers reportedly taking a pay cut to secure the renewal.[7][8] On July 21, 2023, CBS announced the renewed fourteenth season would be delayed and on hold due to the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike.[9] On November 20, 2023, it was announced that the fourteenth season would be its last.[10] The first ten episodes of the season began airing on February 16, 2024,[11] while the rest of the season, consisting of eight episodes,[10] premiered on October 18, 2024.[12] The series finale aired on December 13, 2024.[13] The series follows the Reagan family, with a long history of policing in New York. Frank Reagan (Tom Selleck) is the New York Police Department Police Commissioner, a post his father also held. Frank's eldest surviving son, Danny (Donnie Wahlberg), is an NYPD detective and his youngest son, Jamie (Will Estes), is an NYPD sergeant who graduated from Harvard University; his daughter, Erin (Bridget Moynahan), works as a New York city assistant district attorney. Frank's second birth son, Joe (the series mistakenly refers to him as the eldest in later episodes), was murdered by a corrupt cop in the line of duty in events that predate the series, when he was involved with an FBI investigation of a group of corrupt NYPD cops known as the Blue Templar. Frank's father, Henry (Len Cariou), is a former NYPD beat cop who rose through the ranks to become police commissioner. The show's title references both the \"blue-blooded\" concept of nobility as it relates to the Reagan family's powerful roles within New York's criminal justice system as well as an entire family who dedicate their lives to law enforcement, one that \"bleeds blue\" to match the blue color of NYPD uniforms. Each member of the family represents a different aspect of police work or the legal process: Frank as the commissioner, Danny as the detective, Jamie as the beat cop, and Erin as the prosecutor. Additionally, while each person's story might occasionally interweave with another's, the show also follows the professional and, at times, personal relationships with their respective partners and colleagues: Frank with Garrett Moore (Gregory Jbara), the NYPD Deputy Commissioner of Public Information and de facto Chief of Staff, Detective 1st Grade Abigail Baker (Abigail Hawk), the primary aide to the commissioner, and later, Lieutenant Sidney Gormley (Robert Clohessy), the Special Assistant to the Commissioner and de facto Chief of department; Danny with Detective Jackie Curatola (Jennifer Esposito) and later, Detective Maria Baez (Marisa Ramirez); Jamie with Officer Edit \"Eddie\" Janko (Vanessa Ray); and Erin with Detective Anthony Abetemarco (Steven Schirripa), who is an investigator for the DA's office. Both Henry's and Frank's respective wives, Betty and Mary, are deceased, as is Frank's second son, Joe. Erin is divorced and has one daughter, college graduate Nicky (Sami Gayle), who lived with her mother until accepting a job in San Francisco in season 10. Danny is a widower with two sons, Jack and Sean. He was married to Linda (Amy Carlson), a nurse who was killed off-screen in a helicopter crash between seasons 7 and 8. Jamie married his partner, Edit \"Eddie\" Janko, in the season 9 finale. They acknowledged their mutual attraction during season 7 and became engaged at the end of season 8. The season 10 finale reveals a son of Joe's, a fact unknown to himself and the family until the revelation. He's a 24-year-old detective in the firearms unit named Joe Hill (played by Will Hochman).[14][15] The Reagans are an Irish-American Catholic family that gathers for Sunday dinner each week. According to People, \"the Sunday supper is the heart of each show.\"[16] The dinner scene was the first scene filmed as part of the pilot episode.[17][18] Original series executive producer Leonard Goldberg has said he was inspired by the Norman Rockwell Freedom from Want painting to combine the themes of a police drama and family.[19][20] \"The show is about the moments between these people...you'll remember the small moments between characters,” he said at the time of the show's premiere at the Paley Center.[21] As an Episcopalian, Selleck said he got instruction from Moynahan on how to properly cross himself when playing Catholic character Frank Reagan.[22] Selleck valued that the show was character-driven[23] and not a \"pure procedural\" and recalled former CBS executive Nina Tassler saying that \"We don't use the ‘P’ word around your show.” [24] He has said that the experience of former NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton has influenced his performance.[25][26] Wahlberg said an interview that he was drawn to the Blue Bloods role after his experience playing an NYPD detective in a 2005 NBC TV pilot NY70 set in the 1970s that was not picked up.[27][28] In the pilot episode stage, the series was originally called \"Reagan's Law,\" and some of the characters originally had different first names.[29][30][31] According to Deadline Hollywood, the Blue Bloods pilot was a \"dark horse\" that made it on to the CBS schedule due to a strong audience response during test screenings.[32][33][34][35] Both Selleck and Wahlberg said they saw benefits in low expectations for the Friday night timeslot, as Wahlberg told the New York Post: \"We don't have the pressure other shows have. On Friday night, we have time to build an audience. And we did that.\"[36][37] Selleck played a key role in bringing together and encouraging the three cast members who came to form his character's core inner circle at 1 Police Plaza by season 5.[38][39] In a 2024 feature for Emmy Magazine, Wahlberg recalled helping to convince Moynahan to take the role as his sister after previously working with her on an unsuccessful TV pilot called Bunker Hill.[40] He also encouraged Ramirez to stay on beyond the initial season 3 episode she came on to in a guest role.[41] Selleck mentioned that he was drawn to the project because of the strong pilot script and that he was concerned about becoming involved in an ongoing series because he did not want to compromise his commitment to the Jesse Stone television movies.[55] Beginning January 19, 2011, Blue Bloods was moved to Wednesdays at 10 p.m. for a four-week tryout.[56] In February 2011, the series returned to its Friday night time slot due to the series premiere of Criminal Minds: Suspect Behavior. Kevin Wade became showrunner of the series after the initial creators and a previous showrunner exited the series in 2011 over creative differences with Selleck, and supported by other main cast members, over balancing the character-driven and procedural aspects of the show.[57][58][59][60][35] Series music composer Mark Snow said there was tension between him and the show's original creators over the use of music to underscore dialogue since they did not have experience incorporating music in that way from their previous work on The Sopranos.[61] Director David Barrett explained how he developed a framework for filming the character in different ways to emphasize their character traits that he conveyed to other directors. \"This show is a painting, and each storyline is a color to this painting, so let's approach it from a cinematic rhythm, if you will.\"[62] Showrunner Kevin Wade emphasized that the show didn't seek to be a \"soap box\" to promote one point of view, but aimed to give equal airing to opposing views on law enforcement issues.[63][64][65][23] Both writer producers Brian Burns and Siobhan Byrne O'Connor have family ties to law enforcement.[66][67] Former NYPD officer James Nuciforo has been the technical advisor for the series since the first season, and also has a recurring on-screen role as part of Frank Reagan's security detail.[68][69][70] In 2012, a scene with Tom Selleck was the first production permitted to film at the 9/11 Memorial after it opened in 2011.[71][72] In the United Kingdom, the show helped launch Sky Atlantic by premiering on Tuesday, February 1, 2011, at 10:30 p.m.[73] In Australia, the show premiered in February 2011 in a primetime Wednesday slot on Network Ten, then from February 2013 for season two was moved from the network's primary SD channel to its HD channel One alongside White Collar, then on August 26, 2013, the show moved back to the primary SD channel on Mondays for season three. In New Zealand, the show premieres on July 13, 2013, on TV3 replacing CSI: NY in a primetime Saturday slot after Law & Order: Special Victims Unit. On October 20, 2012, CBS announced that Jennifer Esposito was being dropped from the series, with her character, Detective Curatola, being placed on indefinite leave of absence.[74] Esposito and CBS had been at odds over her limited availability for work after the actress was diagnosed with celiac disease. She had missed a week after collapsing on set earlier in the season. According to Esposito, CBS challenged her request for a reduced work schedule, and further, kept her from finding work elsewhere.[74] In a press release from CBS, the network said that Esposito had \"informed us that she is only available to work on a very limited part-time schedule. As a result, she's unable to perform the demands of her role and we regretfully had to put her character on a leave of absence.\"[74] Esposito's last appearance in a \"starring role\" as Curatola was in the season three episode \"Nightmares,\" though she did later reprise her role as a guest star in the final episode of season thirteen, \"Forgive Us Our Trespasses\", and appeared again in season fourteen. Amy Carlson was written out of the show after she opted not to renew her contract after season 7.[75][76] Tony Terraciano departed from his weekly recurring role[77] in season 9 to focus on his college studies, while still making occasional guest appearances.[78] Regarding Sami Gayle's character of Nicky, Showrunner Kevin Wade said that in later seasons the show didn't \"have the real estate to tell Nicky stories\" once the character \"aged out\" after graduating from college and moving to San Francisco, also aside from occasional guest appearances.[79] Wahlberg said that after they watched the pilot episode together, Selleck told him: \"I'm really good at making scripts better, I notice that you are too, and I'm going to count on you to keep running through walls and do what you do for the run of this show.\"[80][81] Particularly in the first season, Wahlberg said he snuck references to song titles from his band New Kids on the Block into his dialogue, while band member Jordan Knight appeared as a background extra in a later episode.[82] Both Wahlberg and Moynahan have directed episodes of the series.[83][84][85][86] Co-star Gregory Jbara said in an interview that Selleck tended to focus on efficiently getting through the day's scenes, which he contrasted with a looser atmosphere in other scenes, such as with Wahlberg.[87] Co-star Steve Schirripa said that while he just focused on his performance, Moynahan, Wahlberg and Selleck were also interested in production aspects of the show.[88] Wahlberg has contrasted his acting approach with Selleck's, saying \"We both approach the show with the same level of commitment, but Tom is very focused and reserved and uses his years of experience in the craft, while I use instinct and feeling, and emotion a lot.\"[89] He also said of working with Selleck: \"It can never be overstated how much he's committed to the show. He stays behind and works on the show in post-production. He works on the scripts before they're even brought to the cast.\"[90] Co-star Amy Carlson said of working with Wahlberg in 2011: \"When he works on this show, he is Emmy material. He lives this character in such a visceral way, it really resonates on the screen.\"[91] Moynahan added that \"Tom is the face of the show, but Donnie is the engine that keeps everything going.\"[91] The show marked its 150th episode in 2017 with a cast panel discussion at the 92nd Street Y.[92] When filming of the end of the 10th season was disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, Wahlberg hosted cast members for a \"virtual\" family dinner that was streamed online.[93][94] Core cast members were featured on the cover of TV Guide magazine in March 2022 to mark the show's 250th episode.[95][96] The show has been featured on the cover of TV Guide Magazine twelve times, most frequently featuring Tom Selleck by himself or with other cast members, and Donnie Wahlberg by himself in 2023.[97] An October 2024 edition of the magazine featured four separate covers of Blue Bloods cast members to mark the second half of the 14th season, including Selleck with Len Cariou, Donnie Wahlberg with Marisa Ramirez, Will Estes with Vanessa Ray and Bridget Moynahan by herself,[98] in addition to a special farewell edition.[99] In a video about the two 2024 TV Guide covers, Wahlberg in particular praised Ramirez for making her own mark on the show in taking over the role as his character's partner, remarking that \"now everyone wants these two to be a couple, because she's so awesome.\"[100][101] The cast participated in a panel discussion at the Paley Center to mark the premiere of the 14th Season,[102] after previously participating in Paley panels for the series premiere in 2010 and participating in subsequent panels in 2014 and 2017.[103][104][105] According to TV by the Numbers, by committing itself to a third season of Blue Bloods, CBS all but guaranteed a fourth season,[106] because, as a CBS Television Studios production, CBS had a financial incentive to produce at least the minimum number of episodes needed for stripped syndication.[106] On March 27, 2013, CBS made it official by renewing Blue Bloods for a fourth season to begin in the fall of 2013.[107] As of 2023, the show has been renewed through season 14, with the cast and producers taking a pay cut to help secure a 14th season.[108][109][110][111][112][113][114][115][8] On November 20, 2023, it was reported that the fourteenth season is going to be the series's final season, with the first 10 episodes begin airing February 16, 2024, and the remaining eight in the fall of 2024, with producers including Selleck having pushed the network for the extension beyond the spring for the additional episodes in the fall.[10][116][117][35] The second half of the final season premiered on October 18, 2024[12] and the series finale aired on December 13, 2024.[13] In a February 2024 podcast interview, Gregory Jbara said it was possible the show could be extended to the spring 2025 season and beyond 300 episodes depending on viewership and initiative by Tom Selleck.[118] Fans started an initiative to save the show with a social media hashtag, a petition, a letter writing campaign and in person signs on location, and cited Wahlberg's comments in a February 2024 Entertainment Tonight interview: \"Cancel the Cancellation! The fans want us to keep going. The cast want to keep going. Cancel the Cancel!\"[119][better source needed][120][121][122][123][124] Wahlberg paid tribute to the fans' efforts during his regular live-tweeting during the airing of the show and in an Instagram video featuring other cast members.[125][better source needed][126][better source needed] In interviews with CBS News in May 2024 during production of the second half of season 14, Selleck said \"I will continue to think that CBS will come to their senses\" and that \"all the cast wants to come back,\" comments he repeated at the end of May.[127][128][better source needed] He also said that \"when they choose to end it, I think is debatable.\"[129] He also told Entertainment Tonight \"I'm gonna stay optimistic because everybody on the show wants to do it.\"[130] On June 4, 2024, Paramount Global co-CEO Brian Robbins said at a shareholder presentation that there were plans for a \"franchise extension\" of Blue Bloods.[131] In a February 2024 appearance on the Kelly Clarkson Show, Wahlberg had stated that \"maybe there's some way it will still end up surviving and carrying on in a different way.\"[132][133] Also in February 2024, showrunner Kevin Wade had suggested in an interview that \"I think there is some idea on the part of the current CBS to maybe [explore] a 'Blue Bloods 2.0.'''[134] After negotiations over a merger between Paramount Global with Skydance Media initially collapsed in June 2024, a Deadline Hollywood column evaluating the company's possible future plans noted that the show's \"Tom Selleck-led cast is kicking and screaming to stop the show from fading away at season's end. Blue Bloods might not be a sexy Emmy magnet like Succession, but it has made a lot more money.\"[135] In reviewing TV ratings for the 2024 season, Deadline called the cancellation \"one of the bigger head scratchers\" given the show's average audience of over 8 million viewers in 7-day ratings, noting that it \"still does better than The Equalizer (7.7 million) and Fire Country (7.1 million),\" both of which were renewed.[136] In comments livestreamed and recorded after production completed on season 14 in June 2024, Wahlberg recalled the disruption during the COVID-19 pandemic and stated that \"God willing, we'll get some more time together to do something magical again ... I pray that that can happen in one way or another, I won't give up trying.\"[137][138] He wrote on Instagram in the days after filming that the show was one \"that I know so many of us, and so many of you, wish could continue.\"[139][better source needed] In July 2024, Wahlberg hinted to fans of his band New Kids on the Block that he might be involved in some sort of follow-up to the series after its \"apparent\" final season.[140] In an interview before the airing of the second half of season 14, Wahlberg confirmed he would be interested in spin-off ideas.[141] He also said the week of the fall Season 14 premiere on Watch What Happens Live that \"there could be some spin-off or off-shoot\",[142] a possibility he hinted at again in social media posts ahead of the end of Season 14.[143] He told US Weekly in a video interview that he hasn't \"closed the door on the character or on somehow if there is something for Danny, somehow incorporating some of the Reagans into that too and some of the other characters from Blue Bloods.\"[144][145] For Entertainment Weekly, he outlined an \"alternative ending\" for his character that could involve another cast member and some appearances from other family members, and suggested it could be a \"tease for a spin-off.\"[146] In other interviews the week of the Season 14 finale, Wahlberg said a spin-off was \"under discussion\" and that he would be \"open to carrying on the character\" under the right circumstances.[147][148] Marisa Ramirez told Latin American news outlets that filming the end of season 14 was sad and emotional and that the cast and crew \"want to continue, we want more,\" and that she \"would love to continue giving life to Maria [Baez] for another 15 years.\"[149][150][151] She said she would be open to a spin-off involving her character. \"I would never turn down something like that. It would be a blessing, which I would accept with open arms.\"[152] Abigail Hawk, who was a cast member since the first season,[153] said in October 2024 that \"none of us wanted the show to end. Every single one of us, regardless of whatever rumors were flying around, was very ready, willing, and able to continue working. Most especially Tom and Len [Cariou].\"[154] She added that \"we all wanted to continue, this is not something any of us wanted. We felt that there was so much more we could continue telling and sharing and creating.\"[155] In a separate October 2024 interview Hawk said that \"I think there's always hope that once ... these final episodes start airing CBS may go you know even though like the set's gone, the props are gone but like that those things can be rebuilt and if you have the entire cast and crew totally ready and willing to continue I think it's possible that the conversation may happen. I'm not saying it's probable but I think it's possible.\"[156][157] She also told Hello Magazine: \"Now I think once these episodes start airing, CBS executives may realize that they have made a colossal error and perhaps rethink down the line so I think [continuation] remains possible,\" adding that \"hope floats, and I think it's necessary to have something to hang on to and we would all certainly drop everything and make that happen\" and that \"there are more stories to be told.\"[158] She acknowledged that \"yes the set is gone, but with the professionals we have in our industry it would take two seconds to rebuild a set like that if it came to that\" and that \"there's still a little teeny bit of a silver needle somewhere in the hope haystack and I'll hang on to it,\" and cited the title of Selleck's recent memoir being You Never Know.\"There's a void left by our show. And I think that, in time, the higher-ups will come to regret it ... I would say that every single one of us as far as the cast is concerned, we are all ready and willing and able to work, to continue.\"[159] Moynahan said following the filming of season 14 that cast and crew still felt \"disappointed\" by the cancellation decision and recalled Selleck returning to set for the season's final filming day of scenes with her and Wahlberg after completing his own season 14 filming days earlier.[160][161] Selleck, who flew back to New York from California to be on set for the final season 14 filming day, said at the end of season 14 that he was \"frustrated\" about the cancellation decision, noting the show's continued ratings success that he felt was taken for granted, and reiterated that \"there isn't a single one of [the actors] who didn't want to come back.\"[162] Selleck told Variety in December 2024 that \"I can’t figure out why they didn’t start streaming it, do 10 episodes a year ... Everybody wanted to come back. And I think with this cast, it would have been a gift for the audience.\"[35] Selleck told Entertainment Weekly that \"somebody may be able to tell me someday why CBS wanted to end it, but I haven't had a good answer yet.\"[163] Asked about participation in a possible spin-off, Selleck said he was \"open to suggestions because I love Frank Reagan,\" but added that he did not see the character retiring and going off to a small town.[164] Wahlberg said in December 2024 he and other cast members still have the feeling of \"hoping someone from ‘Blue Bloods’ is chasing me down the street saying, ‘Wait, we’re going to do one more season'\" and added that \"“until we know that there’s absolutely no way this show can be resurrected somehow, I think we’re all walking forward… but taking a peek back.”[35] The TV Ratings Guide wrote in November 2024 that it was \"surprising\" that CBS hadn't yet officially announced development of some sort of Blue Bloods continuation given the show's continued ratings success, and noted the possibility of some sort of a follow-up similar to Criminal Minds: Evolution, which had previously been suggested by a writer for Precinct TV.[165][166] A house in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, is used for exterior shots of the Reagan home,[167] with interior scenes filmed at soundstages in Greenpoint, Brooklyn.[168] Visitors to the set have included President Bill Clinton[169][170][better source needed][171][better source needed] and Mayor Eric Adams[172][173][better source needed] and Congressmember Peter King.[174][175][176] Then-New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman made a guest appearance as himself in a 2016 episode.,[177][178][179] while former New York City Mayor David Dinkins appeared as himself in a 2018 episode.[180] President Kennedy's grandson Jack Schlossberg acted in a brief cameo role as a police officer in the 2018 season 8 finale.[181] The series received $79 million in tax breaks from the state of New York for its seasons four through seven.[182] The series received a citation on behalf of New York Governor Kathy Hochul for its contribution to the state's economy over 14 seasons.[183][better source needed][184][better source needed] The Empire State Building was lit blue by the cast to mark the premiere of the second half of season 14 on October 18, 2024, in partnership with CBS and the Detective Endowments Association Widows' and Children's Fund.[185][186] In Australia, the series premiered on Network Ten's primary channel on February 2, 2011.[187] Due to poor ratings of the first season, Ten moved the series to its HD channel One, which premiered the second season on October 31, 2011.[188] Due to decreased viewership of Ten's primary channel, season three moved back from August 26, 2013,[189] and season four returned on March 17, 2014.[190] Foxtel channel TV HITS (styled TV H!TS) have started airing the series from episode 1, weeknights at 8:30 pm AEST as of March 20.

NewsNation previously aired the show daily with a marathon of episodes beginning July 4, 2022, after the show had aired on predecessor channel WGN America.[202] Up TV began airing the program with episodes every weeknight. Blue Bloods has also reaired on Sundance TV and We TV.[203][204] CBS Media Ventures currently distributes the series to local outlets on weekends, with two episodes being offered.

The show airs twice a day on TV 2 Charlie in Denmark. One early review of the pilot from Hitfix praised the show's commitment to filming in New York City and suggested it could flourish if allowed to develop like The Good Wife and to be more character-driven than procedural.[207] For the first season, the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 84% approval rating, with an average rating of 7.3/10 and based on 31 reviews. The website's consensus reads: \"Blue Bloods features charismatic performances from Donnie Wahlberg and Tom Selleck, intriguing plotlines, and compelling doses of family drama within its police procedural trappings.\"[208] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 70 out of 100 based on 25 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[209] Reviewers have praised the series' on-location shooting.[210] The New York Daily News praised Selleck's performance as Frank Reagan[210] while also praising the family dinner scenes for discussion of morally complex issues.[210] The Daily News drew comparisons between Selleck's characters Jesse Stone and Frank Reagan, saying that both Reagan and Stone are moral, principled men of few words.[210] In Entertainment Weekly's annual Fall TV Preview, Ken Tucker named Blue Bloods one of the \"5 Best New Shows\" of 2010.[211][failed verification] In late 2014, the magazine Slate's Laura Hudson criticized the show downplaying or apologizing for systemic racism in law enforcement.[212] Similarly, in a 2022 episode of Last Week Tonight, John Oliver compared the show to an \"adult Paw Patrol\" and criticized it for perpetuating the myth that police officers could overdose on fentanyl after merely touching it, using clips from a 2017 episode of the show.[213][214] In 2017, Selleck was nominated for a People's Choice Award for Favorite TV Crime Drama Actor for his work on the show.[215] In 2011, Michael Hann, writing for The Guardian, panned the show by calling it \"predictable\", \"trite\" and \"pisspoor\".[216] As part of its Performer of the Week series, TV Line praised Donnie Wahlberg's performance in the premiere of season eight[217] the performances of Tom Selleck and Will Hochman in the season 13 episode \"Nothing Sacred\"[218] and Marisa Ramirez's performance in the season 11 premiere.[219] Some critics called on CBS to rethink its 14th season cancellation decision. Verne Gay of Newsday wrote that \"CBS has made a blunder because network TV – approaching mortality itself, and that veritable glue factory – needs shows that are beloved, needs shows about faith, needs shows about New York City, and cops, and the messy political-judicial-socioeconomic ties that bind them. Fourteen years in, Blue Bloods is still that show.\"[220] In an opinion piece published in the Washington Examiner, Jesse Adams wrote that, \"In this atomized age, with more and more viewers lonely and isolated, the Reagans and company feel more like a lot of people's real family than their actual relations... As a sign of respect, and a lucrative opportunity to syndicate some more episodes, let's hope CBS sees reason and greenlights season 15 for a proper farewell.\"[221] Jack Ori wrote for Screen Rant that Tom Selleck was right to be frustrated about CBS' decision to end the show given the ratings and its close-knit cast.[222] The pilot episode garnered 15.258 million viewers because of the Live + 7 days after with viewings from DVRs. Without the DVR adding to the live viewing the show's debut episode garnered a total of 13.02 million viewers.[223] Overall, the ratings have been steady for the series, after the pilot episode. The lowest viewer total through the first seven seasons was 8.88 million in episode eight of season seven (which ran against Game 3 of the 2016 World Series); it was one of the few episodes through the first seven seasons that had fewer than 9 million initial-broadcast viewers.[224] The second-season finale on May 11, 2012, was watched by 10.73 million viewers and received a 1.2/4 ratings/share among adults ages 18–49.[225] The highest (non-pilot) live viewership of 12.93 million occurred in episode 14 of season four (\"Manhattan Queens\"), which was the series' 81st episode.[226] In January 2013, CBS announced via press release that Blue Bloods was the first scripted Friday series in 10 years to average at least 13 million viewers (live + 7), gaining eight percent more viewers than the previous year. The second season of CSI in 2001 had 14.78 million viewers, while the fourth season of Law & Order: SVU in 2003 had 14.92 million.[227] From season eight onward, ratings have declined. Season nine was the first season with no episodes reaching 10 million first-run viewers, although Blue Bloods still ranked as the eighth most watched program in 2018–19 Live + 7 viewership. Season nine also saw the lowest first-run viewership for any episode to date (7.62 million for episode 14, \"My Brother's Keeper\").[228] For the first half of season 14, it ranked at number six for scripted series in all viewers in Live + 7 ratings with an average of 8.4 million viewers and was one of the shows to average more than 10 million viewers after 35 days of viewing including on streaming platforms.[229][230][231] According to TVLine, the show was among the top ten scripted entertainment programs at the start of the 2024 fall season with delayed viewing included.[232][233] Fall 2024 ratings generally increased around 50 percent in Live+7 delayed Nielsen ratings.[234][235][236] The show had the eighth highest average viewership in delayed viewing without sports or news broadcasts, according to TV Guide.[237] According to CBS, the fall season 14 premiere was one of eight CBS shows to reach ten million viewers after seven days with multiplatform streaming and delayed viewing included, [238] and the show reached an average of 9.8 million viewers after 35 days including delayed and multi-platform viewing. [239] The series has performed well on streaming platform Paramount Plus, regularly among the top ten shows on the platform.[240][241] Analysts from entertainment analytics company Parrot Analytics have pointed to Blue Bloods as an example of long-running procedurals that still see strong audience demand.[242][243] In 2012, producer Brian Burns was a finalist for the Humanitas Prize for the Season 2 episode \"The Job.\"[283] In 2021, the show was awarded the TV Faith & Freedom Award for season 10, episode 19, \"Family Secrets\" at the MovieGuide Awards.[284] Writer producer Siobhan Byrne O'Connor was nominated for an Edgar Award in 2012[285] for the episode \"Innocence,\" in 2015 for the episode \"Unfinished Business\" [286] and in 2023 for the episode \"The Reagan Way.\"[287] Kevin Wade was nominated for an Edgar Award in 2019 for the episode \"My Aim is True.\"[285]",

The Huskies also have one American Athletic Conference tournament championship and two ECAC New England regional tournament championships. From the Huskies' first game in 1900–01 season to the end of the 2023–24 season, the program has amassed 1,805 wins and compiled a .648 winning percentage, both top 25 in NCAA Division I history.[5] Initially a New England regional powerhouse, UConn won multiple conference championships in the 1920s, 1940s, 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, including a run of 10-straight Yankee Conference championships from 1951 to 1960.[6] The Huskies appeared in the NCAA tournament 11 times between 1939 and 1970—second most of any school in the tournament's early era—reaching their first Sweet Sixteen in 1956 and first Elite Eight in 1964.[7] The program began its emergence as a national powerhouse after becoming a charter member of the newly formed Big East Conference in 1979, building steadily from its first national postseason championship in the NIT in 1988 to its first NCAA championship in 1999.[8][9] Since 1999, the Huskies have won six national championships in a span of 25 years, a run only rivaled by UCLA under John Wooden.[10] In 2024, UConn became the eighth school in NCAA Division I history to win back-to-back national championships, and the first to do so in 17 years.[11] After the 2023–24 season, Fox Sports dubbed the Huskies' sustained success \"the greatest run of the 21st century\" and recognized UConn as \"one of the greatest programs in the history of college basketball.\"[12] Connecticut Agricultural College played its first organized men's basketball game on February 8, 1901, a 17–12 win against Willimantic High School.[13] The victory led the school to add men's basketball as a varsity sport the following year.[14] The program's first intercollegiate game came in the 1904–05 season, a 66–22 loss to UMass. Connecticut did not have a home court during these early years and eventually ceased competition in 1908 as a result.[6] An independent team was given permission to compete under the school's name from 1910 to 1914. Connecticut resumed sponsorship of men's basketball as a varsity sport in the 1914–15 season following the construction of Hawley Armory, the school's first on-campus basketball court. The Aggies, as they were called at the time, had no coach from 1901 to 1915 and posted a 1–4 record on the 1914-15 season. Looking to improve on its performance in the previous seasons, Connecticut named John F. Donahue as the program's first head coach in 1915. However, he led the team to four losing seasons and an 11–23 overall record during his tenure as head coach. Connecticut named M. Ross Swartz as Donahue's replacement in 1919. He posted a 7–5 record in his first year—the school's first winning season since returning basketball as a varsity sport—but finished 7–9 in his second.[15] With losing records in five out of the previous six years, Connecticut finally turned the corner when it named J. Wilder Tasker as head coach for the 1921–22 season. The Aggies played their most aggressive schedule to date, and opened the season with a 38–33 win against Harvard in Cambridge.[16] In its second game, the team notched the program's first major upset, a 33–31 win over Army at West Point on December 21, 1921.[17] Army was ranked #3 in the nation that season by the retrospective Premo-Porretta Power Poll.[18] Connecticut finished the year 15–4 overall, the program's best season to date. Tasker returned for the 1922–23 season but abruptly resigned after the team's first game, a 52–19 loss to Army. He left Connecticut with a 15–5 overall record. Roy J. Guyer coached the remainder of the season, finishing 8–6 as interim head coach.[15] Connecticut named Sumner Dole as head coach ahead of the 1923–24 season. After posting a losing record in his first season, Dole led Connecticut to back-to-back New England Conference championships in 1925 and 1926. Hugh Greer was captain of the 1925–26 team.[19] That season included a 30–26 win over UMass, a team ranked #25 in the country that season by the retrospective Premo-Porretta Power Poll.[18] After the 1926–27 season, Dole stepped down as men's basketball head coach, but continued to coach the school's football team. He finished with a 34–22 record over four seasons as head coach.[15] With Dole shifting his focus to the school's football team, Louis A. Alexander was named Connecticut's first men's basketball-only head coach in 1927. In his first season, Alexander won the school's third New England Conference championship. That season included a 39–36 win over Springfield College, a team ranked #11 in the nation that year by the retrospective Premo-Porretta Power Poll.[18] Alexander led the team to winning records again in the next two seasons before stepping down halfway through the 1930–31 season. He left Connecticut with a 35–19 overall record. Dole, who was still head coach of Connecticut's football team, coached the remainder of the men's basketball season, posting a 5–3 record as interim head coach and bringing his overall record to 39–25.[15] Connecticut named John Heldman Jr. head coach ahead of the 1931–32 season. Harrison \"Honey\" Fitch, the program's first African American player, joined the team in the 1932–33 season. Heldman made the controversial decision to bench Fitch in a game against the US Coast Guard Academy in 1934 after Coast Guard refused to play if Fitch was on the floor.[20] Heldman coached the following year, but resigned after the first game of the 1935–36 season, a loss to the school's alumni. Heldman finished with a 19–42 overall record. J. O. Christian coached the remainder of the 1935–36 season, finishing with a 3–10 record as interim head coach.[15] After five straight losing seasons, Don White was named head coach of the Huskies for the 1936–37 season. Prior to arriving at UConn, White spent 12 seasons as the head coach at Washington University. He led Connecticut to an 11–7 record in his first year.[21] In the 1940–41 season, the team went 14–2 and won the school's fourth New England Conference championship. One of the first true stars from Connecticut was Hartford's Bernie Fisher, who played under White. He was captain of the 1944–45 team, which was the first Huskies team to play a game in Madison Square Garden.[22] That season also included a 67–59 win over Rhode Island, a team ranked #19 in the country that year by the retrospective Premo-Porretta Power Poll.[18] White left the Huskies after eight seasons to become the head coach at Rutgers. He compiled an overall record of 94–59 during his time with Connecticut.[23] Connecticut hired Blair Gullion as White's replacement for the 1945–46 season. Gullion spent three seasons as head coach at Tennessee prior to World War II and took over as Connecticut's head coach after returning from his service in the war. He coached the Huskies to an 12–6 record in his first season. At the start of the 1946–47 season, Connecticut joined the newly formed Yankee Conference. Gullion left the team six games into the season to accept a position as Washington University's athletic director, finishing with a 15–8 overall record as head coach.[24][15] Hugh Greer became UConn's head coach after Gullion's midseason departure. Greer, a former player at the school in the 1920s, was in his second season as UConn's freshman team coach when Gullion resigned. Prior to that, Greer had coached at South Windsor's Ellsworth High School, winning five state championships between 1939 and 1945.[19] Led by senior Walt Dropo, a three-sport star at the school, the Huskies started the 1946–47 season 4–2 under Gullion, with road losses to rival Rhode Island and an NYU team that appeared in the NCAA tournament the previous year.[25] Gullion resigned after the loss to NYU. The school then asked Greer to helm the team. He led UConn to a perfect 12–0 mark to finish the year, giving the team an overall record of 16–2 on the season. This was the best single season finish in school history to that point.[26] In the 1947–48 season, UConn moved into a new home arena, the Storrs Cage, replacing Hawley Armory. The structure was built by salvaging parts from a World War II airplane hangar, leading to the nickname \"the Hangar.\" This facility had a capacity of 4,000 seats, allowing general admission attendance for the first time.[6] The team's first game in the Storrs Cage was a 63–29 win over Maine in January 1948.[27] The Huskies won their first Yankee Conference title at the end of that season. UConn made its first NCAA tournament appearance in the 1950–51 season, where they lost to St. John's 63–52 at Madison Square Garden. The Huskies finished the season with a 22–4 overall record.[28] In 1953–54 season, Greer famously led UConn to a 78–77 victory against undefeated Holy Cross, breaking the Crusaders' 47-game home winning streak and keeping them out of the NCAA tournament.[29] Holy Cross won the NIT title a few weeks later. UConn made its second NCAA tournament appearance and finished the year with a 23–3 overall record.[30] The UConn Field House replaced the Cage as the team's home court at the start of the 1954–55 season. UConn defeated rival Rhode Island in resounding fashion, 116–77, in the field house's inaugural game on December 1, 1954.[31] The Huskies ended the season with their first National Invitation Tournament appearance and a 20–5 overall record.[32] In the 1955–56 season, Greer led UConn to its third NCAA tournament appearance and its first trip to the Sweet Sixteen following an 84–75 win over Manhattan in the first round. The Huskies narrowly lost to Temple 65–59 in the East Regional semifinal game played at Madison Square Garden.[33] UConn made five consecutive trips to the NCAA tournament between 1956 and 1960. In 1960–61, UConn unexpectedly posted the program's first losing season in 17 years. It was the only losing season of Greer's tenure. The reason for the Huskies' struggles became apparent in March 1961, when two players were questioned as part of the 1961 NCAA men's basketball gambling scandal that resulted in the arrest of 37 players from 22 schools.[34][35] Team captain Pete Kelly and center Glenn Cross were ultimately found to have accepted bribes to shave points throughout the season. Greer was devastated and never recovered from the scandal.[36] The Huskies improved to winning form in the 1961–62 season, but finished one game behind UMass in the race for the Yankee Conference title. Greer died of a heart attack 10 games into the 1962–63 season. His final game was a 92–64 win over Maine, played at the UConn Field House on January 12, 1963. He died two days after and was replaced by assistant coach George Wigton.[37] Wigton and the Huskies posted an 11–3 record through their final 14 regular season games to win the Yankee Conference title and advance to the NCAA tournament for the eighth time in program history. Under Greer, UConn won 12 Yankee Conference titles in 16 seasons, including 10 consecutive titles from 1951 to 1960. Greer also led UConn to its first seven NCAA berths and one NIT appearance while compiling an overall head coaching record of 286–112. UConn named Fred Shabel as Greer's permanent replacement at head coach on April 1, 1963.[38] Shabel previously spent six seasons as an assistant coach at Duke, four of which were under College Basketball Hall of Fame coach Vic Bubas.[39] He played a role in Duke's first Final Four run in 1963 and initially accepted an offer to coach at Rutgers the following season, but withdrew after feeling unprepared to lead their program to success. Instead, he chose to accept an offer from Connecticut, which he believed had a clear path to the NCAA tournament in the Yankee Conference.[40] Shabel implemented a number of changes that had a significant impact on UConn's program and its culture. He introduced multiple defensive schemes for the first time, began calling offensive sets from the bench and pushed for the creation of the UConn pep band. Unlike Greer, who remained seated during most games, Shabel often stood and walked along the sideline.[40] Shabel's first year at the helm was an uneven one, with an 6–8 record in non-conference play in the 1963–64 season. However, the Huskies went 8–2 in Yankee Conference regular season play, tying with Rhode Island atop the conference standings to claim the program's 14th Yankee Conference title. In a one-game playoff, UConn defeated Rhode Island 61–60 on the road to break the tie, clinching the program's ninth appearance in the NCAA tournament.[41] In the first round, UConn avenged a regular season loss to Temple, beating the heavily favored Owls 53–48 in the Philadelphia.[42] They faced even more difficult matchup with Princeton in the Sweet Sixteen. Before the game, Princeton coach Butch van Breda Kolff said he was so confident in his team's ability to win that he did not watch the Huskies' game against Temple.[43] A tightly contested game throughout, UConn's Dom Perno stole the ball from future Hall of Famer Bill Bradley in the final seconds to seal a 52–50 win, sending the Huskies to the Elite Eight for the first time ever.[44] The run ended there, however, as UConn lost to Shabel's former team, Duke, by a score of 101–55 in Raleigh, North Carolina.[45] Under Shabel, the Huskies won four Yankee Conference championships in four years, leading to three NCAA tournament berths. By the mid-1960s, UConn had appeared in the NCAA tournament 11 times, second most in the country.[46] After the 1966–67 season, Shabel stepped down as head coach to become the athletic director at Penn.[47] He later attributed the move to the school's ambivalence about committing greater financial resources to athletics, including the administration's decision to decline an invitation to the NIT in 1966 without consulting him.[40] After Shabel's departure, UConn offered the head coaching job to Larry Brown, then a young assistant coach at North Carolina. Brown declined, saying he felt he was too \"young\" to take a head coaching position. The job ultimately went to Burr Carlson, a former player and an assistant under Shabel. Carlson led UConn to back-to-back losing seasons for the first time in over 30 years and was fired.[48] UConn named Dee Rowe head coach ahead of the 1969–70 season. Under Rowe, the Huskies returned to form, winning the Yankee Conference title in his first year. Rowe posted six winning seasons in eight years, with two NCAA berths and two NIT appearances. On Feb. 19, 1974, UConn became the first school in New England—and one of the first in the country—to start five Black players in an intercollegiate basketball game.[49][50] In 1976, UConn won the ECAC New England regional championship to earn an NCAA berth and then beat Hofstra in the first round of the 1976 NCAA tournament to reach the Sweet Sixteen for the fourth time ever. At the end of the 1975–76 season, the Yankee Conference dropped basketball, which left UConn as an independent. Rowe coached the Huskies' first season as an independent before retiring from coaching at 48 years old, citing heath issues at the time. He later would cite \"burn out\" as the reason for his decision.[51] Former UConn star Dom Perno was tapped as Rowe's successor for the 1977–78 season. Perno oversaw UConn's transition from an independent program to a member of the newly formed Big East Conference in 1979, where UConn was one of the seven founding schools.[52] Under Perno, the Huskies had some early success, winning an ECAC New England regional championship in 1979 and earning one NCAA berth and three NIT appearances over his first five years. However, after four consecutive losing seasons, Perno resigned on April 14, 1986.[53] UConn hired Northeastern head coach Jim Calhoun to take over the program in the 1986–87 season.[54] Before coming to Connecticut, Calhoun spent 14 seasons at Northeastern, leading the team to the NCAA tournament five times in his last six years with the school.[55] In his final season, Calhoun's Northeastern team defeated UConn 90–73 in a game at the Hartford Civic Center.[56] Calhoun inherited a team that included future NBA player Clifford Robinson. However, Robinson and fellow starter Phil Gamble were declared academically ineligible halfway through the year.[57] Calhoun finished his first year with a record of 9–19, his only losing season as UConn's head coach.[15] Heading into the 1987–88 season, Robinson and Gamble regained their academic eligibility and the team showed significant improvement.[57] The Huskies won a game in the Big East tournament for the first time since 1980 and gained a berth in the National Invitation Tournament. UConn went on a run in the tournament and defeated Ohio State 72–67 at Madison Square Garden to win the NIT, the school's first national basketball title.[58] UConn finished the season with a 20–14 record, its first winning season since 1982. The Huskies would ultimately achieve winning records in every season from 1988 through 2016. The 1990 \"Dream Season\" brought UConn basketball back to the national stage. Led by Chris Smith, Nadav Henefeld, Scott Burrell, Tate George, and Rod Sellers, UConn went from unranked in the preseason to winning the Big East regular season and tournament championships, both for the first time.[59] January 1990 in particular marked several major milestones for the team. After an already historic 13–3 start to the season, the Huskies were able to defeat No. 5 Syracuse and No. 2 Georgetown in back-to-back games played at the Hartford Civic Center. After their 70–65 victory over the Hoyas on January 20, 1990, the Huskies entered the AP ranking for the first time ever at #20. 1990 also marked the opening of Gampel Pavilion, the program's new on-campus home, which opened on January 21.[60] UConn entered the Big East tournament ranked No. 8 in the nation and with a 12–4 record in conference play. As the #2 seed in the tournament, the Huskies handily defeated Seton Hall in the quarterfinals before capturing a 65–60 victory over No. 5 Georgetown the following day. On March 11, UConn defeated No. 4 Syracuse 78–75 in the championship game to capture their first ever Big East title, thus assuring their place in the NCAA tournament for the first time since 1979. In the NCAA tournament, the Huskies garnered a #1 seed in the East Region for the first time ever. They easily won their first two matches, winning both games by 20 points or more. In the Sweet Sixteen, UConn trailed No. 17 Clemson 70–69 with 1 second remaining. Scott Burrell's full-court pass found Tate George on the far baseline. George spun, fired, and hit a buzzer-beater that is known in Connecticut simply as \"The Shot\".[61] However, they would be eliminated on a buzzer-beater two days later by No. 15 Duke in the Elite Eight, losing in overtime 79–78.[62] UConn finished the season with a 31–6 overall record.[63] The 1989–90 season ultimately marked the beginning of UConn's' sustained success in men's basketball on the national level, and the program began making regular appearances in the NCAA tournament going forward. During the 1994–95 season, the Huskies hosted Syracuse on ESPN. During an exciting stretch of the second half of that game, ESPN color commentator Dick Vitale declared that Storrs was the \"basketball capital of the world\" as both the men's and women's teams were having undefeated seasons so far.[64] The Huskies beat Syracuse but later lost to Kansas to end their undefeated season. UConn ultimately continued to rise as a national program throughout the 1990s, winning five more Big East regular season and three more Big East tournament championships, as well as making the Elite Eight twice (1995, 1998), prior to their 1998–99 national championship season. One of the most notable players of the era was future NBA legend Ray Allen, who played for the Huskies from 1993 until he was selected as the #5 overall pick in the 1996 NBA draft. In his junior season, Allen averaged 23.4 points, 6.5 rebounds, 3.3 assists and 1.7 steals in 34.7 minutes per game. In the 1996 Big East Championship against Georgetown, Allen made the winning shot with only 14 seconds remaining to achieve a 75–74 victory over the Hoyas. This game is widely considered one of the greatest in Big East tournament history, as UConn was able to end the game with a 12–0 run with under 5 minutes to play. Following the championship, Allen was named the Big East Player of the Year and earned first-team All-Big East for the second year in a row. UConn entered the 1998–99 season ranked #2 in the AP Top 25 poll, returning its entire starting five from the previous year's Elite Eight team. Calhoun convinced leading scorer Richard \"Rip\" Hamilton to return for his junior season instead of departing for the NBA, putting the Huskies in position to make a historic run.[65] UConn started the season 19–0, with wins over five ranked teams. By early December, the Huskies were ranked #1 in the AP poll, where they stayed for a program-record 10 weeks.[66] The team's first loss came to No. 16 Syracuse on February 1, 1999, a 59–42 defeat in front of a sold-out crowd at the Hartford Civic Center. Both Hamilton and starting center Jake Voskuhl were out with injuries.[67] UConn quickly rebounded, however, beating #4 Stanford 70–59 on the road.[68] The Huskies finished the year ranked 1st in the Big East, winning their fifth conference regular season title in six years.[69] On March 3, 1999, UConn defeated #3 seed St. John's 82–63 to win their fourth Big East tournament championship. Kevin Freeman was named the tournament's MVP.[70] The Huskies received a #1 seed in the NCAA tournament for the third time in program history. On March 20, 1999, UConn defeated #10 seed Gonzaga 67–62 in the Elite Eight to advance to the program's first-ever Final Four. In the National Semifinals, the Huskies defeated #4 seed Ohio State 64–58 to advance to the championship game.[71] Facing the #1 overall seed Duke, UConn was a 9.5-point underdog heading into the matchup. However, the Huskies prevailed by a score of 77–74 to claim the program's first-ever national championship.[72] As time expired, Khalid El-Amin ran over to a television camera on the court and shouted, \"We shocked the world!\"[73] Richard Hamilton was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player, contributing 27 points, 7 rebounds, and 3 assists in the championship game. UConn finished with a 34–2 overall record to achieve its best seasonal winning percentage in the program's history (as of 2024).[74] After the season, Hamilton was selected in the 1999 NBA draft as the #7 overall pick.[75] Expectations were high at UConn heading into the 2003–04 season. Returning their entire starting lineup from the previous year's Sweet Sixteen team, the Huskies were selected as the preseason #1 team in the AP Top 25 poll.[76][77] UConn faced its first setback in the fourth game of the season, losing to Georgia Tech 77–61 in the Preseason NIT semifinals.[78] However, the team responded with 11 consecutive wins, including an 86–59 victory over #7 Oklahoma at Gampel Pavilion on January 11, 2004.[79] The streak ended with an 86–83 loss at #11 North Carolina on January 17, 2004.[80] UConn ultimately finished the year second in the Big East, obtaining a 12–4 record in conference play during the regular season. In the Big East tournament, the team defeated #7 seed Notre Dame in the quarterfinals and #11 seed Villanova in the semifinals with relative ease. On March 13, 2004, the Huskies defeated #1 seed Pittsburgh 61–58 in the championship game to win the program's sixth Big East tournament championship. Ben Gordon scored a tournament-record 84 points over three games and was named tournament's MVP.[81] The Huskies were awarded a #2 seed in the NCAA tournament and advanced to the program's second Final Four with an 87–71 win over #8 seed Alabama in the Elite Eight on March 27, 2004.[82] In the National Semifinals, UConn came back from an 8-point deficit with three minutes remaining to defeat #1 seed Duke 79–78 on April 3, 2004.[83] The Huskies won their second NCAA championship on April 5, 2004, defeating #3 seed Georgia Tech 82–73 in a rematch of their regular season contest.[84] Emeka Okafor was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player, and UConn finished the season with a 33–6 overall record.[85] After the season, Okafor and Gordon were selected in the 2004 NBA draft as the #2 and #3 overall picks, respectively.[86] Calhoun said he considers the 2003–04 team to be the best he ever coached.[87] Calhoun was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2005.[88] After steadily rebuilding over the prior two years, UConn entered the 2008–09 season ranked #2 in the preseason AP Top 25 poll.[89] The Huskies returned their entire starting lineup from the previous season and added 2008 McDonald's All-American Kemba Walker to the roster.[90] The team started the year 11–0, including double-digit wins over #17 Miami and #25 Wisconsin en route to the US Virgin Islands Paradise Jam championship. With an 88–83 win over #8 Gonzaga in Seattle on December 20, 2008, UConn earned its third ranked victory of the year ahead of conference play. The Huskies' first stumble came in their Big East opener, a 74–63 loss at home to #11 Georgetown. The team responded with 12 straight conference wins that propelled UConn to a #1 ranking in the AP poll by February. In mid-February, the team lost key starter Jerome Dyson to a season-ending knee injury in a 63–49 win against #23 Syracuse.[91][92] UConn finished the regular season 4–2 without Dyson—with the two losses coming against Pittsburgh, ranked top-five in both matchups.[15] The Huskies finished the year tied for second in the Big East and received the #3 seed in the conference tournament. In the Big East tournament quarterfinals, UConn lost to #6 seed Syracuse in a six-overtime game remembered as one of the greatest college basketball games of all time.[93][94] The Orange appeared to a hit a game-winning shot at the end of regulation, but the basket was waived off after review. Syracuse never led in the first five overtimes, but UConn was unable to put the game away. The Huskies went scoreless in the first two and a half minutes of the sixth overtime and fell to the Orange 127–117.[95] Despite the loss, UConn was awarded a #1 seed in the NCAA tournament and advanced to the program's third Final Four with a 82–75 win over #3 seed Missouri.[96] The Huskies' run ended in the Final Four with an 82–73 loss to #2 seed Michigan State.[97] UConn finished the season with a 31–5 overall record. After the season, Hasheem Thabeet and A. J. Price were selected in the 2009 NBA draft as the #2 and #52 overall picks, respectively.[98] UConn entered the 2010–11 season unranked and picked to finish tenth in the Big East. But after a 10–0 start that included wins over #2 Michigan State and #8 Kentucky en route to the Maui Invitational Tournament championship, the Huskies catapulted to #7 in the AP Top 25 poll.[99] The team reached #4 in the poll by the start of conference play.[100] However, the Huskies struggled against their Big East opponents, finishing the regular season in a tie for ninth place after losing four of their last five games.[101] The team finished the regular season with a 9–9 record in conference play and ranked No. 21 in the AP Poll. In the first two rounds of the Big East tournament, UConn defeated #16 seed DePaul and #8 seed Georgetown. In the quarterfinals, Kemba Walker hit a step-back, game-winning shot as time expired to defeat #1 seed Pittsburgh 76–74. Dave Pasch immortalized the shot with his call on the ESPN broadcast: \"Cardiac Kemba does it again!\"[102] The Huskies defeated #4 seed Syracuse in overtime in the semifinals and then defeated #3 seed Louisville in the championship game to claim the program's seventh Big East tournament title. UConn became the first school to win five conference tournament games in five days, and Kemba Walker scored a tournament-record 130 points.[103] The Huskies were awarded a #3 seed in the NCAA tournament and ultimately advanced to their fourth Final Four after a 65–63 victory over #5 seed Arizona in the Elite Eight. They defeated #4 seed Kentucky 56–55 in the Final Four and #8 seed Butler 53–41 in the national championship game to capture the schools third NCAA title. Walker was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player, averaging 23.5 points, 5.4 rebounds, and 4.5 assists per game throughout the season. UConn finished the season with a 32–9 overall record, becoming the first and (as of 2024) only men's or women's basketball team to play 41 games in one season.[104] After the season, Walker was selected in the 2011 NBA draft as the #9 overall pick. Calhoun officially announced his retirement on September 13, 2012.[105] Kevin Ollie was named UConn's next head coach at Jim Calhoun's retirement press conference in Gampel Pavilion.[106] Ollie played for Calhoun from 1991 to 1995 before spending 13 seasons as a journeyman in the NBA. He returned to UConn in 2010 to serve as one of Calhoun's assistant coaches during the 2010–11 and 2011–12 seasons. UConn came into the 2012–13 season facing a ban from postseason play by the NCAA because of a low APR score in 2010.[107] In Ollie's first game, UConn upset #14 Michigan State 66–62 at Ramstein Air Base in Germany.[108] The Huskies entered the AP Top 25 at #23 and reached #21 the following week.[109] After a 4–0 start, they fell out of the poll for the remainder of the year following a 66–60 loss to New Mexico in the Paradise Jam championship game.[110] The season featured wins at #17 Notre Dame and against #6 Syracuse at the XL Center, as well as a double-overtime loss to #7 Georgetown at Gampel Pavilion.[111][112][113] UConn finished the season with a 20–10 overall record. Due to their postseason ban, the Huskies were unable to participate in the Big East Tournament, nor were they able to qualify for the NCAA Tournament. Conference realignment resulted in the breakup of the old Big East at the end of the 2012–13 season. Instead of leaving with the so-called Catholic 7 schools, UConn chose to remain a member of the original Big East's legal successor, later named the American Athletic Conference.[114] Until leaving the American in 2020 to join the new Big East, UConn was the only charter member of the original Big East still playing in the conference.[115] The Huskies came into Ollie's second season ranked #18 in the AP Top 25 poll.[116] They started the year 9–0, which included a 59–58 win over Indiana in the 2K Sports Classic championship game and a 65–64 win over #15 Florida on a buzzer-beater from Shabazz Napier.[117][118] UConn climbed to #10 in the AP poll before losing its first game to Stanford on December 18, 2013.[119] The team finished the year tied for third in the inaugural season of the American Athletic Conference and advanced to the AAC tournament championship game, where they lost by 10 points to No. 5 Louisville. UConn was selected to the NCAA tournament as a #7 seed and then defeated #10 seed St Joseph's in overtime, #2 seed Villanova, and #3 seed Iowa State in the Sweet 16 to advance to the regional final. On March 30, 2014, Kevin Ollie became the first UConn coach other than Jim Calhoun to lead the Huskies to a Final Four after defeating #4 seed Michigan State 60–54 in the Elite Eight.[120] The Huskies beat the #1 overall seed Florida 63–53 in the Final Four and then won the national championship on April 7, 2014, defeating #8 seed Kentucky, 60–54.[121] Shabazz Napier was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player and in his postgame remarks called out the NCAA for the previous year's postseason ban: \"You're looking at the hungry Huskies. This is what happens when you ban us.\"[122] Other major contributions to the team's unexpected tournament run came from point guard Ryan Boatright, who averaged over 12 points and 3.5 rebounds per game throughout the season, and small forward DeAndre Daniels. Ollie's team was the first #7 seed to ever win the NCAA tournament. UConn finished the season with a 32–8 overall record.[123] After the season, Napier and Daniels were selected in the 2014 NBA draft as the #24 and #37 overall picks, respectively.[124] Despite losing four of its top five scorers from the previous year, UConn entered the 2014–15 season ranked #17 in the AP Top 25 poll.[125] The Huskies started the year 3–0, but fell out of the top 25 amid a three-game losing streak to West Virginia, #7 Texas and Yale—the last two of which were 1-point losses on last-second shots by the opponent.[126][127] UConn was eventually able to gain some momentum near the end of conference play, defeating No. 21 SMU at the XL Center on March 1, 2015. However, the team then went on to lose their final two games of the regular season. UConn finished the regular season tied for fifth in the American. In the AAC tournament quarterfinals, Ryan Boatright hit a game-winning 3-point shot against #3 seed Cincinnati as time expired. The team advanced to the conference championship game for the second straight year after a win over #2 seed Tulsa in the semifinals. However, UConn lost to #1 seed SMU 62–54 in the championship and missed the NCAA tournament as a result.[128] The season ended with a first-round exit in the NIT, losing to Arizona State 68–61 in a game played at Gampel Pavilion.[129] UConn ultimately finished the season with a 20–15 overall record. UConn entered the 2015–16 season ranked #20 in the AP Top 25 poll.[130] The Huskies started 4–0 and climbed to #18 in the poll. However, they dropped three of their next four, losing to Syracuse, #10 Gonzaga and #6 Maryland, and fell out the top 25.[131][132][133] The team bounced back and briefly re-entered the top 25 in mid-December. They would again re-enter the top 25 in January before falling out for the remainder of the year.[134] UConn posted an 11–7 record in conference play, narrowly missing a three-way tie for third place at 12–6 in the American. Instead, the Huskies finished sixth, but received the #5 seed in the tournament because SMU was ineligible for postseason play.[135] In one of the program's most memorable postseason games, UConn defeated #4 seed Cincinnati 104–97 in quadruple overtime the AAC tournament quarterfinals. Down by 3 with 0.6 seconds left on the clock in the third overtime, Jalen Adams hit a three-quarter court shot to force the fourth and final overtime.[136] UConn then defeated #1 seed Temple in the semifinals and #6 seed Memphis in the championship game to win the American Athletic Conference tournament championship.[137] Daniel Hamilton was named the conference tournament's MVP. UConn returned to the NCAA tournament at a #9 seed and defeated #8 seed Colorado 74–67 in the Round of 64. However, the Huskies were eliminated by the #1 overall seed Kansas Jayhawks 73–61 in the Round of 32.[138] UConn finished their season with a 25–11 overall record. After the season, Hamilton was selected as the #56 overall pick in the 2016 NBA draft.[139] Despite losing their MVP in Daniel Hamilton, UConn entered the 2016–17 season ranked #18 in the AP Top 25 poll. However, they fell out of the rankings after opening the year with upset losses at home to Wagner and Northeastern.[140] On December 5, 2016, the Huskies defeated Syracuse 52–50 in the Tire Pro Classic at Madison Square Garden.[141] This win gave the team some confidence after a disappointing 3–4 start to the season. However, without their previous season's MVP in Daniel Hamilton, UConn would continue to struggle against their AAC opponents going forward, losing four out of their last five games in AAC play. The team finished the regular season tied for fifth place in the American with a 9–9 record in conference play, and were given the #6 seed in the conference tournament. The Huskies managed to pull off an upset win over #3 seed Houston in the AAC tournament quarterfinals, but lost in the semifinals to #2 seed Cincinnati the following day.[142][143] UConn finished with a 16–17 overall record, the program's first losing season in 30 years.[144] The Huskies were unranked for the entire 2017–18 season and had 11 double-digit losses. On January 26, 2018, the school announced the NCAA was investigating UConn for possible recruiting violations related to three players.[145] The team finished the regular season tied for eighth place in the American (7–11 record in AAC play) and lost to #9 seed SMU 80–73 in the first round of the conference tournament on March 8, 2018.[146] UConn finished with a 14–18 overall record in what is widely considered to be the teams worst-performing season since the Jim Calhoun era began in 1986. Two days after the loss to SMU, Kevin Ollie was fired for just cause related to the NCAA investigation.[147] In Ollie's final season, UConn men's basketball game attendance reached its lowest level in nearly 30 years, illustrating the severe decline in its prominence and performance since the program's 2014 national championship. On July 2, 2019, the NCAA announced UConn's wins for the 2017–18 season would be vacated because of the school's recruiting violations, giving the school a 0–18 official record for the year.[148] UConn hired Rhode Island head coach Dan Hurley as Ollie's replacement for the 2018–19 season. He was introduced on March 23, 2018.[149] Prior to his six seasons at Rhode Island, Hurley spent nine years coaching at St. Benedict's Preparatory School in New Jersey and two years at Wagner College. His father is Bob Hurley Sr., a longtime New Jersey high school basketball coach and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame inductee, and his brother is Bobby Hurley, two-time national champion as a player and current head coach at Arizona State.[150] Hurley's first season at UConn was an up-and-down affair. The first marquee win under Hurley came in his third game when the Huskies defeated #15 Syracuse 83–76 in the 2K Sports Classic semifinals at Madison Square Garden.[151] However, UConn lost to Iowa the following day in the tournament championship game.[152] The team ultimately garnered a 6–12 record in the American Athletic Conference, its worst record in conference play in over three decades.[123] The Huskies were given a #9 seed in the AAC tournament, and their season ended with an 84–45 loss to #1 seed Houston in the quarterfinals.[153] While UConn's 16–17 record was an improvement from the previous year, it marked the third-straight losing season for the program. On June 27, 2019, UConn and the Big East announced that the school would return to the conference for the 2020–21 season.[154] With UConn's return to the Big East imminent, the Huskies had one season left to play in the American Athletic Conference. The team gained a 4-star recruiting class that included future First-team All-Big East guard James Bouknight, as well as transfer point guard R. J. Cole. UConn started the year 9–3, including an upset win over #15 Florida at Gampel Pavilion.[155] On January 18, 2020, after a 61–55 loss at #14 Villanova—a non-conference game that would become a conference game the next year—Hurley remarked that other teams \"better get us now. That's all, you better get us now. Because it's coming,\" foreshadowing the program's return to national relevance in the years ahead.[156] In the penultimate game of the regular season, UConn defeated #21 Houston 77–71 at Gampel Pavilion on senior night and finished the year tied for fifth place in the American.[157][158] UConn was set to face Tulane in the first round of the AAC tournament on March 12, 2020. However, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the AAC tournament being canceled mere hours before it was set to tip off.[159] The team finished the season with a 19–12 overall record, its first winning season since 2016. UConn's return to the Big East was overshadowed by the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Huskies played all of their home games in Gampel Pavilion with no fans in attendance.[160] Five games were cancelled, and four others were rescheduled as players, coaches and staff tested positive for the virus. The team gained several players this season that would play key roles in the years ahead, including future NCAA tournament MOP Adama Sanogo. Other recruits of note were future NBA draftees Andre Jackson Jr. and junior Tyrese Martin, who transferred from Rhode Island. UConn finished third in the conference and lost in the Big East tournament semifinals to #2 seed Creighton.[161] The Huskies returned to the NCAA tournament for the first time in five years and were awarded a #7 seed. The season ended with a first-round loss to #10 seed Maryland.[162] UConn finished the season with a 15–8 overall record, playing its least number of games since the pre-Calhoun era. After the season, James Bouknight was selected as the #11 overall pick in the 2021 NBA draft.[163] During Bouknight's sophomore season at UConn, he was considered to be the team's top scorer, averaging 18.7 points and 5.7 rebounds per game throughout the season. Despite losing its leading scorer in Bouknight, UConn returned four out of five starters and came into the year ranked #24 in the preseason AP Top 25 poll.[164] The team also gained another 4-star recruiting class that included several key players in the following championship season, such as Jordan Hawkins, Samson Johnson, and redshirt Alex Karaban. The Huskies started off 5–0, including a 115–109 double-overtime win against #19 Auburn in the Battle 4 Atlantis quarterfinals.[165] The team lost to Michigan State in the semifinals the following day.[166] On February 22, 2022, UConn defeated #8 Villanova 71–69 at the XL Center—securing the program's first 20-win season in six years and its first top-10 win in eight years.[167] UConn again finished third in the Big East, entering the postseason with its highest regular-season win total since 2013–14. However, the Huskies lost in the Big East tournament semifinals for the second year in a row, this time to #2 seed Villanova.[168] UConn was awarded a #5 seed in the NCAA tournament, but the season ended with another first-round exit—an upset loss to 12-seed New Mexico State.[169] The team finished the season with a 23–10 overall record. Major contributions to the teams success came from shooting guard Tyrese Martin and point guard R. J. Cole, who averaged 15.8 points, 4.1 assists, and 3.4 rebounds per game throughout the season. Martin was a major rebounder for the team, averaging 7.5 rebounds and 13.6 points per game throughout the season. After the season, Martin was selected as the #51 overall pick in the 2022 NBA draft.[170] The Huskies entered the 2022–23 season unranked after losing eight scholarship players to transfer, graduation, and the draft.[171] Despite this, UConn jumped out to a 14–0 start, winning the Phil Knight Invitational championship and climbing to #2 in the AP Top 25 poll by mid-December.[172] The team cooled off in January, losing six of their next eight games, but returned to form and went 8–1 to close out the regular season.[173] The Huskies finished fourth in the Big East and, for the third straight year, lost in the Big East tournament semifinals with a 68–70 loss to #1 seed Marquette.[174] UConn was awarded a #4 seed in the NCAA tournament and then won six straight games by an average of 20.0 points to claim the program's fifth national championship, with a 76–59 victory over San Diego State in the title game.[175] Adama Sanogo was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player, averaging over 20 points and 9.8 rebounds per game in the tournament. Shooting guard Jordan Hawkins was named the Most Outstanding Player of the tournament's West Regional after averaging 22 points and four rebounds in the Huskies' Sweet Sixteen and Elite Eight games. He also scored 16 points against San Diego State in the 2023 national championship game. Other major contributions to the team's success came from shooting guard Andre Jackson Jr., as well as transfers Tristen Newton, Joey Calcaterra, and Hassan Diarra. Two freshmen, forward Alex Karaban and backup center Donovan Clingan, also made their mark on one of the most dominant teams in the history of March Madness. The Huskies were the first team since the tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1985 to win every game by at least 13 points. Their smallest margin of victory was against Miami (FL) in the Final Four, 72–59.[176] UConn finished the season with a 31–8 overall record. After the season, Hawkins and Jackson Jr. were selected in the 2023 NBA draft as the #14 and #36 overall picks, respectively.[177] Sanogo signed as an undrafted free agent with the Chicago Bulls.[178] Following the NCAA tournament, numerous analysts and commentators declared that UConn had earned \"blue blood\" status in college basketball—placing the Huskies among the highest performing programs in the history of the sport.[179][180] Despite losing two of its top scorers in Hawkins and Sanogo to the NBA, UConn entered the 2023–24 season ranked #6 in the preseason AP Top 25 poll. The team gained a 5-star recruit in point guard Stephon Castle as well as future First-Team All-Big East transfer Cam Spencer. Donovan Clingan became the starting center for the team and averaged 13 points per game throughout the season. The Huskies reached #4 in the AP after starting 7–0 and winning the Empire Classic championship at Madison Square Garden.[181] On November 28, 2023, UConn won its 24th straight non-conference game by double digits, setting a new NCAA record.[182] The team lost its first non-conference game in 624 days at #5 Kansas on December 1, 2023, falling 65–69.[183] The Huskies rebounded from the loss four days later with an 87–76 win over #9 North Carolina in the Jimmy V Classic.[184] Coach Dan Hurley led UConn to a program-best 18 wins in Big East conference play, earning the Huskies their first Big East regular season title since 2006 and their 11th overall, a conference record.[185] As the #1 seed in the Big East tournament, UConn defeated #9 seed Xavier in the quarterfinals and then defeated #5 seed St. Johns in the semifinals to advance to their first conference championship game since 2016 (first in Big East since 2011). The following day, the Huskies defeated #3 seed Marquette 73–57 in the championship game to win their first Big East championship since 2011 and eighth overall (tied for most in conference history).[186] UConn received the #1 overall seed for the first time ever in the 2024 NCAA tournament and ultimately won its second consecutive NCAA title, with a 75–60 win over Purdue in the national championship game.[187][188] The Huskies' scoring margin of +140 for their six games (23.3 points per game) is an NCAA Division I record. The team also set a record by winning every NCAA tournament game by at least 14 points, beating their own record from the previous season by 1 point. Their smallest margin of victory was against Alabama in the Final Four, 86–72.[189] Tristen Newton was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player, and Dan Hurley was named Naismith College Coach of the Year as well as Sporting News Men's College Basketball Coach of the Year.[190][191] UConn finished the season with a 37–3 overall record, setting a program record with the most wins in a single season and achieving one of the best winning percentages for a men's basketball national championship team in Division I history. With a sixth NCAA championship, UConn moved into a tie for third most all time.[192] ESPN's Jay Bilas said UConn's six national championships in 25 tournaments is the best run college basketball has seen since the John Wooden-era at UCLA in the 1960s and 1970s.[193] After the season, Clingan, Castle, Karaban, Newton and Spencer declared for the 2024 NBA draft and were all invited to the NBA draft combine. Karaban, projected as an early second-round pick, opted to return to UConn for a third season.[194] Castle and Clingan were selected in the first round of the draft as the #4 and #7 picks, respectively. Newton and Spencer were selected in the second round with picks #49 and #53.[195] Source[196] UConn has won 34 conference regular season championships over the past century. The program currently holds the record for the most Big East regular season titles (11) as well as the most Yankee Conference regular season titles (18).[197][198][199][200] New England Conference (5) Yankee Conference (18) Big East Conference (11) For much of the 20th century, UConn was a member of conferences that did not hold a postseason tournament (New England and Yankee). The advent of the ECAC men's basketball tournaments in the 1974–75 season provided UConn with its first opportunity to win a postseason conference championship. Over the past half century, UConn has won 11 conference tournament titles. The program is currently tied with Georgetown for the most Big East tournament championships (8) all time.[201] ECAC New England Tournament (2) Big East Conference Tournament (8) American Athletic Conference Tournament (1) The NCAA began seeding the tournament with the 1979 edition. Indicates NCAA championship * Indicates overall number one seed † Indicates vacated by the NCAA The Huskies were the top seed in the West region, and a win over Gonzaga in the regional final sent UConn to Tropicana Field for the program's first Final Four appearance. They defeated Ohio State 64–58 in the National Semifinals to advance to play against Duke in the National Championship. Despite having been ranked #1 for half of the year, the Huskies entered the national championship game as 9-point underdogs. UConn won their first national title with a 77–74 victory. Richard Hamilton was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player. In 2004, the Huskies returned to the Final Four. Once again they faced Duke, this time in the National Semifinal, and used a late run to beat the Blue Devils 79–78. Two nights later, led by Emeka Okafor and Ben Gordon, Connecticut won their second national title with an 82–73 victory over Georgia Tech. Okafor was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player. One day later the UConn women's basketball team also won a national title, making UConn the first and only school in NCAA Division I history to have its men's and women's basketball programs win a national championship in the same season. The 2011 Huskies won 11 straight games in postseason play, the final six of which resulted in the program's third national championship. On April 4, 2011, they defeated the Butler Bulldogs, 53–41. UConn junior Kemba Walker was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player. Many consider UConn's win in the Championship Game to be a great defensive performance, as the Huskies held Butler to only 18.8% shooting from the field (a record for field goal percentage defense in a championship game) and tied a title game record with ten blocked shots.[202] An analysis by Sports Illustrated columnist Luke Winn credited the Huskies' defense by demonstrating, for instance, that they blocked or altered a staggering 26.6% of Butler's shots – compared to just 3.8% by Pittsburgh and 12.1% by VCU in earlier rounds.[203] The 53 points scored by Connecticut were, in turn, the lowest point total by a winning team in a championship game since 1949. In 2014, led by American Athletic Conference Player of the Year Shabazz Napier, UConn became the first #7 seed to win the NCAA Championship, getting past No. 1 seed Florida, No. 2 seed Villanova, No. 3 seed Iowa State, and No. 4 seed Michigan State, before defeating the Kentucky Wildcats 60–54 in the championship game in Arlington, Texas. UConn is undefeated in the state of Texas in the Final Four (6–0). As in 2004, the UConn women's basketball team also won a national title, making UConn the first and only school in NCAA Division I history to have its men's and women's basketball programs win a national championship in the same season twice. In 2023, the UConn Huskies won all of their tournament games by more than 10 points. Their path to the championship began against #13 seed Iona in the first round, in which they would trail at the half but eventually pull away in the end. The Huskies would then beat #5 Saint Mary's, #8 Arkansas, and #3 Gonzaga. The national semifinal would be a 13-point defeat of #5 Miami, their smallest margin of victory in the tournament. The national championship would be a 17-point defeat of #5 San Diego State University as UConn won their fifth national title, moving the program into a tie for fourth-most NCAA championships all time. In 2024, the UConn Huskies became the first team to repeat as NCAA tournament champions since the Florida Gators in 2007. They won their sixth title, putting them at a tie with North Carolina for the third-most championships of all time. Once again, they won every tournament game by double digits; their smallest margin of victory in the entire tournament was 14 points against Alabama in the Final Four. The Huskies also set the record for the largest combined margin of victory in all their games with 140 points; and largest-average margin of victory of 23.3 points per game.[204] Because of that, the 2024 Huskies are considered one of the most dominant teams in the history of March Madness, following up 2023's strong performance. The Huskies have appeared in the NCAA tournament 36 times. Their combined record is 69–31. They have been to seven Final Fours and are six-time National Champions (1999, 2004, 2011, 2014, 2023, 2024). *NCAA vacated all of UConn's games in 1996 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. Totals above do not include vacated games. The Huskies have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) 13 times. Their combined record is 15–12. They were NIT champions in 1988. The following is a list of Connecticut Huskies men's basketball head coaches. The team is currently coached by Dan Hurley, alongside associate head coach Kimani Young and assistant coaches Luke Murray and Tom Moore. Two men's basketball players have had their numbers retired at UConn. For more than a century, UConn's basketball programs did not have any retired numbers. On December 7, 2018, UConn announced that the #34 worn by Ray Allen—along with the #50 worn by UConn women's basketball star Rebecca Lobo—would be the first-ever to be permanently retired for each respective team.[206] Allen and Lobo were the first players in school history inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. Allen's number retirement ceremony was held at Gampel Pavilion on March 3, 2019.[207] On January 30, 2024, UConn announced that the #32 worn by Richard Hamilton would be the second number retired by the program. Hamilton's number retirement ceremony was held at Gampel Pavilion on February 24, 2024.[208] The Huskies of Honor program recognizes the top players, coaches and administrators in the history of UConn men's and women's basketball. On December 26, 2006, the university announced the inaugural class, which included 13 players and 3 coaches from the men's basketball program. The men's basketball inaugural class was formally inducted in a ceremony on February 5, 2007.[209] Former athletic director John Toner was inducted on February 28, 2009.[210] On April 5, 2011, Kemba Walker was the first men's basketball player to be added to the program since the inaugural inductees, an honor he was bestowed after leading the team to a national championship.[211] The Huskies of Honor are each recognized by a four by five foot panel which displays his name, jersey number and years of service, and a plaque which summarizes each's career accomplishments;[209] Both the panels and the plaques are on permanent display at Gampel Pavilion on the main campus of the University of Connecticut in Storrs.[212] Since the creation of the National Basketball Association in 1946, more than 40 former UConn stars have played in the league. Thirteen of them have received NBA honors and awards, and five have won an NBA championship.[15] While the league has shown an interest in UConn's top players since the first NBA draft in 1947, the Huskies emerged as a consistent talent pipeline to the professional level in the 1990s.[213][214] UConn has produced some of the greatest players in NBA history, nearly all in the past three decades.[215][216][217] The list of former UConn players in the NBA includes: In 2011, SLAM Magazine included Allen, Hamilton, Robinson, Butler, Gordon and Okafor on its list of the 500 Greatest NBA Players of All Time.[215] There have been 56 former UConn players selected in the NBA draft, including 24 first-round picks and 17 lottery picks.[246] Walt Dropo was the first UConn player to be drafted—selected with the fourth overall pick in the inaugural draft in 1947—but ultimately chose to play professional baseball instead.[247] In the 2006 NBA draft, the Huskies tied the record for most first-round picks from one school (4) and tied the second-highest number of picks from one school in a single NBA draft (5).[248] # NBA Lottery Pick There are 41 former UConn players who have played in the NBA.[249][250] The program's first NBA player was Worthy Patterson, who played for the St. Louis Hawks for three months during the 1957–58 NBA season.[251] Nine Huskies were considered active during the 2023–24 season.[252] Bold indicates players considered active in the 2023–24 NBA season. All stats updated through end of 2023–24 season. Two former UConn players—Wes Bialosuknia and Jimmy Foster—were drafted in the NBA but elected to play in the American Basketball Association instead. Bialosuknia was selected by the Oakland Oaks in the first round of the inaugural ABA draft in 1967.[253] While he only played one season in the ABA, he finished with the league's second-highest 3-point field goal percentage and the league record for most consecutive 3-point field goals (9).[254] Foster was selected by the Carolina Cougars in the seventh round of the ABA draft in 1974.[255] He spent two seasons in the ABA and played in the ABA All-Star game as a member of the Denver Nuggets in 1976.[256] After the 1975–76 season concluded, the ABA merged with the NBA. Foster then faced a contract dispute with Nuggets and left the team. He briefly played in Europe before retiring from professional basketball.[49] Since 1980, USA Basketball has selected 23 players and three coaches with UConn ties to represent the United States in international competition. UConn players and coaches have combined to win 18 gold medals at various levels of competition, including at the 2000 Summer Olympic Games and the 2010 and 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cups.[257] Three Huskies have represented the United States in men's basketball during the Olympics Games: In addition, four Huskies have represented the United States in the FIBA Basketball World Cup: Gay is one of only three players in USA Basketball history to win two FIBA Basketball World Cups. UConn players have also won gold medals at the FIBA AmeriCup (1999, 2003), the Goodwill Games (1998) and the World University Games (1995, 1999).

                "content": "Jackson State University (Jackson State or JSU) is a public historically black research university in Jackson, Mississippi. It is one of the largest HBCUs in the United States and the fourth largest university in Mississippi in terms of student enrollment. The university is a member of the Thurgood Marshall College Fund and classified among \"R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity\". Jackson State University's athletic teams, the Tigers, participate in NCAA Division I athletics as a member of the Southwestern Athletic Conference (SWAC). Jackson State is also the home of the Sonic Boom of the South, a marching band founded in the 1940s. Their accompanying danceline, the Prancing J-Settes, are well known for their unique style of dance, known as J-Setting. Jackson State University developed from Natchez Seminary, founded October 23, 1877, in Natchez, Mississippi. The seminary was affiliated with the American Baptist Home Mission Society of New York, who established it \"for the moral, religious, and intellectual improvement of Christian leaders of the colored people of Mississippi and the neighboring states\".[11][12] In 1883, the school changed its name to Jackson College and moved from Natchez to a site in Jackson, the capital.[13] The college moved to its current location early in the 20th century, where it developed into a full state university.[13] Its original site in Jackson is now the location of Millsaps College. In 1934, during the Great Depression, the Baptist Society withdrew financial support. The school became a state-supported public institution in 1940 as the Mississippi Negro Training School. The name has changed over time: Jackson College for Negro Teachers in 1944;. Jackson State College in 1967, after desegregation; and with the addition of graduate programs and expanded curriculum, Jackson State University in 1974.[14] Many students at Jackson State College became active in the civil rights movement. Work to gain integrated practice and social justice continued after civil rights legislation was passed in the mid-1960s. During an on-campus protest on May 14, 1970, two students were killed by police gunfire,[15] and an additional 12 students injured by gunfire.[16] A dormitory still bears the bullet marks fired on that day. The university drew national attention in 2023 when the faculty senate voted \"no confidence\" in university president Thomas Hudson. They alleged that he \"repeatedly failed to respect shared governance, transparency, and accountability\".[17] Shortly thereafter, the university's board of trustees placed Hudson on administrative leave and appointed Elayne Hayes-Anthony the acting president.[18] The main campus contains over 50 academic and administrative buildings on 245 acres (0.99 km2). It is located at 1400 John R. Lynch Street between Prentiss and Dalton Streets. Ayer Hall was constructed in 1903 and is the oldest structure on the main campus. It was named in honor of the first president of the institution, Charles Ayer. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. Gibbs-Green Pedestrian Walkway was named in honor of the two young men who died in the Jackson State shooting in 1970. As a result of the landmark \"Ayers Settlement\" in 2002, the university, along with the other two public HBCUs in the state, has completed extensive renovations and upgrades to campus.[19] Jackson State has satellite campuses throughout the Jackson Metropolitan area: The board of trustees is the constitutional governing body of the Mississippi State Institutions of Higher Learning.[20] This body appoints the president of the university. There are 575 faculty and 1,431 staff; 54% of the faculty are tenured, teaching approximately 7,000 undergraduate and graduate students.[21] JSU colleges and schools include: In 2015, JSU became the first university in Mississippi approved by the legislature to establish a School of Public Health which is housed under the College of Health Sciences.[29][30] JSU is the only university in Mississippi to earn two consecutive \"Apple Distinguished School\" distinctions from Apple Inc.[31] Since 2012, Jackson State University has provided all first-time, full-time freshmen brand new iPads.[32] JSU is the first and only HBCU in Mississippi to support a bachelor's and master's level engineering program.[33] The W.E.B. Du Bois – Maria Luisa Alvarez Harvey Honors College is a selective interdisciplinary college at the university for the most high-achieving undergraduate students.[34] Tiger Battalion, the university's Army ROTC program is the host US Army ROTC program for Belhaven University, Delta State University, Hinds Community College, Millsaps College, Mississippi College, Mississippi College School of Law, Mississippi Valley State University, Tougaloo College, and University of Mississippi Medical Center's School of Nursing. Air Force Detachment 006 is the Air Force ROTC Component for the Jackson metropolitan area. Hosted at Jackson State, it also serves students from Belhaven University, Millsaps College, Mississippi College and Tougaloo College. Jackson State is a member of the Division I Football Championship Subdivision (FCS) and the Southwestern Athletic Conference. JSU fields teams in basketball, track and field, cross country, baseball, softball, golf, tennis, soccer, bowling, volleyball, and football. The university's mascot is the Tiger, and the teams are sometimes referred to as the \"Blue Bengals\". JSU athletics is historically most well-known for its football program. JSU consistently leads the nation in Division I FCS football average home attendance.[35][36] JSU Tigers football alumni includes Pro Football Hall of Famers Lem Barney, Jackie Slater, Walter Payton, Robert Brazile, and Jimmy Smith. JSU participates in a number of notable football games with rival colleges. These include: As of 2024, JSU men's basketball has won five SWAC titles and made three NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament appearances. The marching band began in the 1940s at what was then Jackson State College, under the directorship of Frederick D. Hall, who had directed a band at the college as early as the 1920s, in addition to the chorus and orchestra. It was initially made up of students from Jackson College and Lanier High School.[40] Founded as the Jackson State University Marching Band, the name \"Sonic Boom of the South\" was adopted by the school in 1971, after having been suggested by band members.[40] The first full-time band director, William W. Davis, was appointed in 1948, replacing Charles Saulsburg, who had been director since 1947.[40] Davis had previously played trumpet in Cab Calloway's band, and Calloway's musical style and showmanship influenced Davis's conceptualization of the marching band.[40] The band at this time had around 20 members, increasing to 88 in 1963.[41] Davis retired as director in 1971, but remained the chief arranger for the band.[40] He was replaced by Harold J. Haughton.[40] Haughton was instrumental in the creation of the Prancing J-Settes, the band's accompanying danceline. In fall 2022, Jackson State's total enrollment was 6,906, of which 4,927 were undergraduate students and 1,979 were graduate.[42] As of fall 2020, 67% of Jackson State's student community were Mississippi residents, with the majority from Hinds County and Madison County. The top three feeder states were Illinois (409 students), Louisiana (269), and Georgia (220). Nigeria accounted for the highest number of international students on campus. 91% of students identified as Black, 6% identified as white, and 4% identified with various race categories. 31% of students were male, and 69% of students were female.[43] Jackson State University offers over 60 registered student organizations. There are academic, residential, religious, Greek, and special interest groups.[44] All student organizations are governed under the Student Affairs division. Jackson State is home to radio station WJSU-88.5 FM which plays jazz, gospel, news, and public affairs programming. The television station W23BC is known as JSUTV and aired on Comcast. The independent weekly student newspaper is called Blue and White Flash[45] and the Jacksonian magazine features news and highlights about the university.",

                "title": "Alabama Crimson Tide men's basketball - Wikipedia",
                "content": "The Alabama Crimson Tide men's basketball team represents the University of Alabama in NCAA Division I men's basketball. The program plays in the Southeastern Conference (SEC). Among SEC teams it trails only long-time basketball powerhouse Kentucky in SEC tournament titles, is third behind Kentucky and Tennessee in SEC regular season conference titles, and is fourth behind Kentucky, Texas, and Arkansas in total wins. Alabama was retroactively recognized as the pre-NCAA tournament national champion for the 1929–30 season by the Premo-Porretta Power Poll.[3] The team has appeared in the NCAA tournament 24 times, most recently in 2024, and has made ten Sweet Sixteens, two Elite Eights, and one Final Four in the tournament. Alabama's current head coach is Nate Oats. The men's basketball program has spent most of its history in the shadow of Alabama's football team, but has risen in stature over the past several decades. The program was notable as a regular conference basketball contender in the 1980s and early 1990s under the direction of coach Wimp Sanderson and in the 1970s under coach C. M. Newton. Under former coach Mark Gottfried, the team achieved a No. 1 national ranking briefly in 2003. In the 2003–04 season, the team defeated #1-seeded Stanford in the NCAA tournament, and reached the Elite Eight round for the first time where they lost to the eventual national champion, Connecticut. Under Nate Oats, the team earned SEC titles in 2021 and 2023. In the latter year, the Crimson Tide achieved their best-ever season in program history to that point, earning the No. 1 overall seed in the NCAA tournament. They fell to the eventual runner-up, San Diego State, in the Sweet Sixteen. In the 2024 NCAA tournament, they defeated #1-seeded North Carolina in the Sweet Sixteen, and defeated #6-seeded Clemson in the Elite Eight to advance to their first Final Four appearance in the school's history where they lost to the eventual national champion, UConn. Former coaches with at least five years with the Crimson Tide include the following: Hank Crisp (1923–1942, 1945–1946), Hayden Riley (1960–1968), C. M. Newton (1968–1980), Wimp Sanderson (1980–1992) – Alabama's winningest coach (.692), David Hobbs (1992–1998), Mark Gottfried (1998–2009), and Anthony Grant (2009–2015).[4][5] Other coaches include John Dee, D.V. Graves, Floyd Burdette, and Charles A. Bernier.[5] In 1968, legendary Alabama football coach Paul \"Bear\" Bryant, who was also Alabama's athletic director, called Kentucky men's basketball coach Adolph Rupp looking for someone to turn around Alabama's basketball program. Rupp recommended C. M. Newton, a former backup player at Kentucky who had been at Transylvania University for 12 years.[6] In 12 seasons at Alabama, Newton led the Tide to a record of 211–123. The Crimson Tide won three straight SEC titles under Newton (1974, 1975, and 1976), the only program besides Kentucky to accomplish this feat.[6] Newton also guided Alabama to four NIT and two NCAA Men's Division I Championship tournament berths, prompting the school to name a recruiting suite in his honor in 2006.[7] Just as he did at Transylvania, Newton recruited Alabama's first black player, Wendell Hudson, in 1969, integrating his second team in as many coaching stops.[8] Newton resigned as head coach after the 1980–81 season to become assistant commissioner of the SEC. He was succeeded by his top assistant, Wimp Sanderson. He had been at Alabama since 1960 as a graduate assistant to Newton's predecessor, Hayden Riley; he was named a full-fledged assistant in 1961. In 12 years as head coach his teams averaged 21.8 wins a year, with a 267–119 record, and they won 4 SEC tournaments. They played in one NIT and eight NCAA tournaments making the \"Sweet 16\" five times. Sanderson is the only coach in Alabama history to win 200 or more games in his first 10 years. He was the SEC Coach of the Year in 1987, 1989 and 1990, and was the National Coach of the Year in 1987.[9] Sanderson was best known for wearing garish plaid sports jackets on the sidelines. At one point, Coleman Coliseum was known as the \"Plaid Palace\", and the mid-court logo was painted in a crimson-and-white plaid pattern. Hobbs was hired at Alabama as an assistant coach for Wimp Sanderson in 1985 and spent seven years as an assistant in Tuscaloosa helping the Crimson Tide win one SEC Championship and four SEC Tournament crowns while the Tide made four appearances in the NCAA tournament's Sweet 16. As an assistant, he had the opportunity to coach such All-SEC performers as Robert Horry, James \"Hollywood\" Robinson and Latrell Sprewell. When Sanderson left Alabama following the 1992 season, Hobbs was named head coach. In his first season, the Tide finished 16–13 and advanced to the NIT. In 1994 and 1995, Alabama recorded 20-win seasons and advanced to the NCAA tournament behind the play of future NBA All-Star Antonio McDyess. In 1996, Hobbs led UA to a 19–13 mark and a berth in the NIT Final Four. He resigned his post following the 1998 season after compiling a 110–76 (.594) career record and producing nine All-SEC players. Mark Gottfried served as the Crimson Tide's head coach from the 1998–99 season until midway through the 2008–09 season.[4] Gottfried played 3 seasons of basketball at Alabama under Wimp Sanderson, and the Crimson Tide advanced to the Sweet Sixteen in each of those seasons. He was hired by Alabama in March 1998 after coaching at Murray State for three seasons. The Crimson Tide achieved the highest pinnacle ever for the school in both the NCAA Championship tournament and the Associated Press Poll reaching the Elite Eight in the tournament in 2004 and reaching the No. 1 spot in the nation in the AP poll in 2002, both under Mark Gottfried's command. Gottfried led the Tide to its only SEC Championship under his watch during the 2001–02 season, although the team never won a conference tournament championship during his tenure. For his efforts in 2002, Gottfried was named SEC Coach of the Year by both the Associated Press and his fellow Southeastern Conference coaches. Perhaps his biggest accomplishment as coach at Alabama was leading the Crimson Tide to five consecutive NCAA tournaments from 2002 to 2006, another first for the school that occurred under his watch. Gottfried resigned on January 26, 2009, with 11 regular season games still remaining on the team's schedule. Then Athletic Director Mal Moore named long-time Alabama assistant and former player, Philip Pearson as interim head coach for the remainder of the 2008–09 season. On March 27, 2009 Anthony Grant agreed in principle to become the 20th Crimson Tide head men's basketball coach.[11] Grant came to Alabama after serving as the head coach at VCU from 2006 to 2009. After a mediocre first season, Grant led the veteran 2010–11 team to a SEC West title and a 2nd-place finish in the 2011 NIT. The 2011–12 team endured the suspensions of several star players to finish with a 21–12 record and a berth in the 2012 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, where they lost in the round of 64 to Creighton. This was the Crimson Tide's first trip to the NCAA tournament since 2006. In March 2015, Grant was fired by Alabama after six seasons. Assistant coach John Brannen served as interim head coach for the 2015 NIT tournament.[12] On April 5, 2015, Avery Johnson agreed to become Alabama's next head coach.[13] The former NBA coach said he was attracted to the position because he perceived it as \"a big challenge\" in that Alabama is not a \"perennial favorite\" and has never won a championship before.[14] Johnson's 2017–18 team finished with a 20–16 (8–10) record and was invited to the NCAA tournament. The next season, the Tide finished 18–16 (8–10) and Johnson was let go at the end of the campaign.[15] On March 27, 2019, Nate Oats was named Alabama's next head coach.[16] Oats was previously the coach for the Buffalo Bulls, and had led them to three NCAA tournament appearances in the past four years. After a 16–15 record in his first season in 2019–20, Oats' second season brought Alabama the first SEC regular-season title since 2002 and the first SEC tournament title since 1991. The Tide were a No. 2 seed in the 2021 tournament, where they fell to UCLA in overtime in the Sweet Sixteen. Then in 2023, Oats coached Alabama to their second SEC regular season and tournament championship in three years. Alabama returned as the No. 1 overall seed in the 2023 NCAA tournament where they advanced to the Sweet Sixteen for the second time under Oats tenure before falling to San Diego State who advanced to the National Championship game. In 2024, Alabama once again made the NCAA tournament and advanced to their second Elite Eight in program history after defeating North Carolina in the Sweet Sixteen. Bama beat Clemson in the West Region finals to advance to the Final Four for the first time in program history. Oats also holds the best record against AP top 10 teams in Alabama history.[citation needed] Roster The Crimson Tide basketball team practices and plays in Coleman Coliseum, a multi-purpose arena on the UA campus in Tuscaloosa. The arena was built for $4.2 million and opened in 1968 as a replacement for the aging Foster Auditorium. In 2005, the building underwent a renovation in which more seats were added. The arena officially seats 15,314 people. Coleman Coliseum was named for Jefferson Jackson Coleman, a prominent alumnus and longtime supporter of the University of Alabama. Until his death in 1995, he was the only person that had attended every Alabama football bowl game, starting with the Rose Bowl Game on January 1, 1926. Prior to 1990, the building was known as Memorial Coliseum. \"Mark's Madness\" was a student organization named after former Crimson Tide coach Mark Gottfried, which is also a play on the nickname for the NCAA basketball tournament, \"March Madness\".[17] It was created by a group of Alabama students in January 2000 in an attempt to create a more exciting atmosphere in Coleman Coliseum.[18] During the Gottfried era, the Crimson Tide was an impressive 137-27 (.835) in Coleman Coliseum.[17] Mark's Madness was the largest student organization on campus during its time.[17] The end of Mark Gottfried's tenure in early 2009 also meant the end of the Mark's Madness name. After Coach Anthony Grant was hired, a group of senior students approached the UA Marketing Department in the summer 2009 about resurrecting the student section organization. During the first exhibition game of the 2009 season, it was announced that the new name of the student organization for supporting Alabama basketball would be \"Crimson Chaos\". As Crimson Chaos entered its second year, it officially registered as a University of Alabama student group and adopted a new format. In addition to supporting men's basketball, Crimson Chaos expanded to support all University of Alabama sports, becoming the official student group of athletics at the university.[19] The group also tried new things to make the atmosphere in Coleman Coliseum as intimidating as it was in previous years, including adding the \"Roll Tide Roller Coaster\".[20] The newly energized environment Crimson Chaos created in Coleman Coliseum helped the Tide complete an undefeated season at home (for the 2010–11 season) with a 19–0 record, including wins over then #12 Kentucky, Georgia, Mississippi State. The group's popularity garnered even more attention and praise thanks to the late superfan Luke “Fluff” Ratliff. He became the Crimson Chaos president and wore a plaid jacket to almost every game. He was loved by many for his light hearted humor and happy-go-lucky attitude. He inspired many people to follow and share in his passion for the tide hoops program and also other athletic teams around campus. He sparked the basketball program under Coach Nate Oats and continues to be an inspiration to so many. There is a plaque engraved to honor Fluff in the dedicated chair for all Crimson Chaos Presidents who come after him.[21][citation needed] Alabama has appeared in the NCAA tournament 24 times.
