                "content": "Corbin Brian Burnes (born October 22, 1994) is an American professional baseball pitcher who is a free agent. He has previously played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Milwaukee Brewers and Baltimore Orioles. The Brewers selected Burnes in the fourth round of the 2016 MLB draft, and he made his MLB debut in 2018. Burnes is a four-time All-Star. He won the National League Cy Young Award in 2021, when he led the National League (NL) in earned run average. He led the NL in strikeouts in 2022. Burnes attended Centennial High School in Bakersfield, California. In 2013, his senior year, he had a 9–4 win–loss record with a 2.23 earned run average (ERA) in 22 appearances.[1] After high school, he enrolled and played college baseball at Saint Mary's College of California.[2][3] In 2015, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Orleans Firebirds of the Cape Cod Baseball League.[4] In 2016, his junior year, he posted a 9–2 record with a 2.48 ERA in 16 starts. After the season, he was drafted by the Milwaukee Brewers in the fourth round of the 2016 Major League Baseball draft.[5] Burnes made his professional debut with the Arizona League Brewers and was later promoted to the Wisconsin Timber Rattlers.[6] In 35+2⁄3 innings pitched between Arizona and Wisconsin, Burnes posted a 3–0 record with a 2.02 ERA. He started the 2017 season with the Carolina Mudcats and was later promoted to the Biloxi Shuckers after recording a 1.05 ERA after ten starts.[7][8] Burnes finished 2017 with a combined 8–3 record and 1.67 ERA between both teams.[9] The Brewers named him their minor league pitcher of the year after the season.[10] MLB.com ranked Burnes as Milwaukee's second-best prospect going into the 2018 season.[11] He began the season with the Colorado Springs Sky Sox.[12] The Brewers promoted Burnes to the majors for the first time on July 8, 2018.[13] He made his major league debut on July 10, pitching two scoreless innings, striking out one, and recording his first major league save.[14] In the 2018 NLDS against the Colorado Rockies, he pitched four scoreless innings in relief across two appearances, earning the win in the clinching 6–0 Game 3 victory. In the 2018 NLCS, Burnes got the last six outs of their game six win against the Dodgers.[citation needed] To start 2019, Burnes began the year in the starting rotation. However, he struggled in that role, allowing 11 home runs across his first 3 starts. It was announced he would move back to the bullpen. He continued to struggle in the bullpen, compiling a 9.00 ERA through 26 appearances. He was placed on the injured list on July 15 with shoulder discomfort. He finished the season with a 1–5 record and an 8.82 ERA in 49 innings. In the shortened 2020 season, Burnes pitched to a 4–1 record and recorded an ERA of 2.11 while striking out 88 batters in 59+2⁄3 innings. He finished 6th in the NL Cy Young voting.[15] Burnes struck out 40 batters without issuing a walk in his first four starts of 2021, an unprecedented four game stretch for an MLB starting pitcher.[16] On May 13, Burnes set the MLB record for the most strikeouts to begin a season before issuing a walk, with 58, surpassing the previous record held by Kenley Jansen.[17] Burnes was named to the 2021 MLB All-Star Game.[18] On August 12, Burnes tied an MLB record after striking out 10 consecutive batters in a game against the Chicago Cubs.[19] On September 11, Burnes pitched the first eight innings of a combined no-hitter with Josh Hader against the Cleveland Indians, in which he struck out 14 batters. He held a perfect game until a seventh-inning walk to Myles Straw.[20] Burnes finished the 2021 season with an 11–5 record and led the major leagues in ERA (2.43), strikeouts per nine innings (12.6), home runs per nine innings (0.4), and strikeout-to-walk ratio (6.88).[21] He won the National League Cy Young Award, becoming the third Brewers pitcher to win the award.[22] He was also named to the first 2021 All-MLB Team as a starting pitcher.[23] Burnes was selected as the starter for Game 1 of the 2021 NLDS against the Atlanta Braves. Burnes pitched six shutout innings, striking out six. He was not credited with the win, however, as he battled in a tight pitchers' duel with Atlanta's Charlie Morton. Milwaukee won the game, 2–1.[citation needed] On March 22, 2022, Burnes signed a $6.5 million contract with the Brewers, avoiding salary arbitration.[24] The Brewers named Burnes their Opening Day starting pitcher.[25] He was named to the 2022 MLB All-Star Game.[26] In 2022, Burnes was 12–8 with a 2.94 ERA in 202 innings, and struck out a league-high 243 batters.[27] On defense, he had a .961 fielding percentage.[27] He was a finalist for the NL Gold Glove Award at pitcher, but it was won for the third straight season by Max Fried.[28] Burnes went to salary arbitration with the Brewers, with the arbiter choosing the $10.01 million salary requested by the Brewers, rather than the $10.75 million requested by Burnes. He said that the process \"definitely hurt\" his relationship with the franchise.[29] Burnes started for the Brewers on Opening Day.[30] In 32 starts for Milwaukee, he posted a 10–8 record and 3.39 ERA with 200 strikeouts, and was named an All–Star for the third straight season.[31] On February 1, 2024, the Brewers traded Burnes to the Baltimore Orioles in exchange for DL Hall, Joey Ortiz, and a compensatory draft pick.[32] He made 32 appearances (32 starts) for the Orioles in 2024, pitching to a 2.92 ERA and a 15-9 record with 181 strikeouts across 194.1 innings pitched.[33] After the 2024 season, Burnes became a free agent.[34] Burnes is a power pitcher who has thrown six different pitches: a four-seam fastball between 94 and 97 MPH, a sinker between 95 and 97 MPH, a changeup between 88 and 91 MPH, a slider between 86 and 89 MPH, a curveball between 80 and 83 MPH, and a cut fastball between 93 and 96 MPH. He virtually abandoned his four-seamer after 2020 after finding far more success exclusively using his cutter.[35] In 2024, Burnes will debut a second curveball, about 5 MPH faster than his first, in strikeout situations.[36] Burnes is the son of Rick and Kandi Burnes.[37] Burnes and his wife Brooke were married in 2020;[38][39] they have two children.[40][41]",

                "title": "Corbin Burnes Free Agency Statcast Analysis",
                "content": "Mike Petriello Corbin Burnes is maybe the most interesting free-agent starting pitcher available (non-Roki Sasaki division), and it’s not hard to see why. Over the past four seasons, the four-time All-Star and 2021 Cy Young Award winner is second only to Zack Wheeler in Wins Above Replacement. That stretch culminated with an All-MLB First Team selection in his first -- and maybe only -- year with Baltimore. He’s also a perfect example of modern pitching enlightenment, which is to say “he had an 8.82 ERA in 2019 and then completely changed his pitch shapes and usage to become an ace.” We saw that ability to change within the context of 2024, as well, as his strikeout rate plummeted in-season -- raising some questions about what that would do to his market -- before he fixed his cutter, restored his sweeper and ended up finishing with one of the best months of his career. For all of his obvious skill, he can also be a pitcher of extremes, and that is what interests us today. As Burnes heads off to the market to make some team quite happy to have him, there’s something you might not have realized he led the Majors in -- and something he was dead last in, too. As we said: extremes. The good: No one makes batters look foolish more often For years, this was simply an eye test thing. But no more; along with the introduction of Statcast’s bat tracking metrics in 2024 came “swords,” which is a way to actually quantify the most awkward, uncomfortable swinging strikes. There’s plenty more on that here, including how they’re defined, but the short version is: If the bat crosses the front face of the plate, doesn’t come all the way back around, and is in the slowest 10% of swings for that player, it’s a sword. It’s putting a number to a stomachache, really. There are bad swings and then there are bad swings. It’s not what you want, if you’re a hitter. It’s perhaps more of an entertainment stat than an analytical one, except for the fact that when you look at the pitchers who got the most swords in 2024, you start to realize something. These are really good pitchers, and maybe there’s some value in identifying the pitchers who don’t just miss bats, but manage to do it in a way that makes the best hitters on the planet look that bad, that often. Most swords, 2024 That’s a list you want to be on, right? Put another way: 12% of Burnes’ swinging strikes were of the ‘sword’ variety, the most in the Majors, ahead of many of the same names but also top relievers like Griffin Jax (the only other pitcher north of 10%). So while Burnes didn’t have the most strikeouts or the most swinging strikes, what he did have was the most that made a batter look, well, awful. For all of the metrics that don’t match the eye test, this is one that’s very much intended to. In Burnes' case, he managed to do it on five different pitch types – and since you’re dying to see what it looks like to make hitters look that foolish, enjoy this compilation of our dozen favorites. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Or, perhaps, spare a thought for poor Zach DeLoach, who did it three times (on three different pitch types) in an 0-for-4 showing on Sept. 2. Does it matter, to make batters look bad, as opposed to just piling up whiffs? Maybe, maybe not. But it’s hard not to notice that after collecting 15 swords in July and August combined, Burnes captured 14 in September alone after fixing his repertoire. It was the second-most in a month of any pitcher all year. So that’s the great news. What’s the flip side here? The bad: He’s the absolute weakest at preventing runners from going wild. Burnes allowed 41 stolen bases last year, the most in the Majors, and the most in Baltimore history. There’s obvious necessary context in any historic numbers like that, given the 2023 rule changes that made stealing bases easier, but “allowed the most steals in the Majors in 2024” requires no such explanation. No one was easier to advance against. But there’s so much context required in evaluating steal attempts, like if the runner was fast, or the leads were good, or the catcher can or can’t throw. Thankfully, we can go beyond just “most steals allowed” and into some advanced Statcast metrics, which show, perhaps unsurprisingly, that Burnes allowed the most advances on the bases of anyone. Fewest base advances prevented vs. avg, pitchers, 2024 “Holding a runner on” means preventing them from advancing, and that’s what this is saying -- being minus-21 here means he allowed 24 more advances than the average pitcher, given his situations, and in return only got three more outs than the average pitcher would have. On the other hand, someone who was very good at this -- like Shota Imanaga of the Cubs -- was plus-8, meaning that Burnes was nearly 30 base advances weaker than the best of the best. That’s steals, sure. But it’s not all steals, either. To start with, on three different occasions, Burnes allowed a free base by trying a third pickoff throw and failing to get the runner, tied for the most in baseball. Those aren’t steals, but they are free bases given, which all count. So what’s behind all of this? There’s a lot of moving parts, so let’s break it down. Is it his catchers?Probably not. Baltimore catchers had a 20% caught stealing percentage, which is essentially average (the Majors had a 21% caught stealing rate) -- and that would have been nearly 24% with Burnes removed. Both Adley Rutschman (+1 CS above avg) and James McCann (+0) rated as average in the advanced Statcast metrics, which account for a runner’s speed and distance, and Burnes threw to them about evenly anyway. Were the other O’s pitchers poor at this?Not really. If all Baltimore pitchers were bad across the board, it might point to something beyond Burnes, but it’s not this, either. While Craig Kimbrel (-7 base advances prevented) was as poor at this as he usually is, the rest of the O’s pitchers rated from roughly average to actually pretty good, in Grayson Rodriguez’s case. It’s a Burnes-specific issue. Why was he poor?It’s mostly about big leads, and the willingness of runners to try. Consider this: When runners at first (in steal opportunities) take a lead off of Burnes, they get off to a 10.4 foot lead, which is relatively average. By the time he releases the pitch, they’re up to 15.5 feet off first, which is a fraction of a foot off of being the largest lead allowed in baseball. Take the difference -- 5.1 feet of distance gained while the pitcher is in motion -- and it’s essentially tied for the largest amount of lead distance gained. That’s a lot of ground covered, and bad situations for his catchers. You can really see it in action here, when Seiya Suzuki -- an outfielder with good but hardly elite speed -- stole in July. McCann had a good throw from his knees, with a strong 1.94 second pop time, but because Suzuki was 26 feet off of first when the ball was released, there was hardly anything the catcher could do about it. It was the same thing earlier in the year when William Contreras gained 19 feet during Burnes’s motion, and is 33 feet off first base by the time the ball comes out, giving Rutschman no prayer of throwing him out. (In the catcher version of this metric, Rutschman was given a mere 3% chance of catching the runner, meaning that while he had to eat the one stolen base allowed, he was barely dinged in Statcast’s metrics, because of the opportunity he was given.) The broadcast video, however, is not sufficient to show you what really happened. If we look at the Statcast 3D version, look at Contreras dancing behind Burnes. Look how far he gets without Burnes even looking -- and then stops, because you assume the pitcher must have noticed -- before taking off when he realized he was in the clear. It’s because of that knowledge -- that you can get big leads here -- that runners were simply more aggressive on Burnes compared to most pitchers. While it may not seem like a lot that potential base stealers made an attempt on 6% of the pitches they had an opportunity to do so, it was actually third-highest in baseball behind Nick Nastrini and Adam Ottavino, long known for his weakness here. Why did he get worse?It wasn’t always like this for Burnes. This is the key for any team looking to sign Burnes for next year, because he wasn’t that bad at this with Milwaukee. He was, at times, even good. In all of 2022 -- again, under the old rules -- he allowed only five stolen bases, and it wasn’t because Brewer catchers Omar Narváez and Victor Caratini were elite throwers; they rated as average, similar to Burnes’s 2024 Orioles backstops. It’s partially because runners were far more willing to test him; note that the attempt rate nearly tripled from 2023. It’s also because he was allowing more distance during his motion, an entire foot more than he was giving up in his last year with Milwaukee, and in a sport where inches means everything, that could be the difference. Of course, this might not matter as much as it seems, anyway; it's not like Burnes wasn't successful, and -21 bases prevented comes out to all of three runs of value lost, which is minimal. The question, then, remains open: Did the Orioles instruct him not to even worry about it, and focus on the batter at the plate? Or did Burnes suddenly get worse at a skill he seemed to possess previously? Whether this keeps up in 2025 will go a long way towards providing an answer.",

                "title": "Orioles ace Corbin Burnes aims for World Series, eyes free-agency - The Athletic",
                "content": "MLB NEW YORK — As Baltimore Orioles ace Corbin Burnes reconnected with a couple of former teammates during batting practice Tuesday at Citi Field, a New York Mets staffer he had never met approached him. “Hey,” Burnes recalled a Mets development coach telling him, “we handed your mental-work stuff off to some of our draftees that just came in to help them with their mental process. We just want you to know you’re impacting the game outside of just your organization.” Advertisement A day later, the encounter stuck with Burnes. “I thought that was really cool,” Burnes said during a wide-ranging conversation Wednesday. “For me, that’s how I think I turned the corner in ’19. It was pretty cool to know that something that helped me is probably going to help some other guys over there.” Burnes, 29, emerged as one of the game’s preeminent starters by dedicating himself to mental strength, refining his routine and changing his pitching repertoire years ago. He has stayed at that level. Among pitchers since 2020, only Philadelphia Phillies right-hander Zack Wheeler (23.0) has a higher fWAR than Burnes (21.0), who won the National League Cy Young Award in 2021. Once the World Series ends, Burnes will become a first-time free agent, likely as the market’s top pitcher. This season, he’s making $15.6 million. There’s little doubt Burnes, a client of Scott Boras, will see multiple lucrative offers. When it comes to making a choice, expect Burnes to take a methodical, meticulous approach indicative of his personality; he’s the kind of guy who thoroughly grades himself after every start. He believes in planning and preparation. He will do the homework, he said. Wherever he ends up, Burnes wants to win. An organization’s reputation for how it treats families — Burnes is married with three young children — will unquestionably play a major role, too, he said. Though Burnes grew up in California and lives in Arizona during the offseason, geography isn’t expected to be a key component in his decision. There may be other factors, but family and winning stand out as the important ones. Burnes played in the postseason five times during his six-year tenure with the Milwaukee Brewers, the club that drafted him in 2016. There’s a strong chance he returns to the playoffs this year with the Baltimore Orioles. In the offseason, he wants to choose a team that he thinks can win each year during his tenure. Advertisement “I am going to have to do a lot of research this offseason of farm systems, young guys coming up, groups of core guys that are on a team,” Burnes said. “Where does it look like teams are going to be competitive? Where are teams just looking to spend some money to make the fan base happy? Whatever it might be. “I think I can provide value in helping to elevate some young guys on the staff. Is it a group of young pitchers where maybe they missed the postseason this year but they have the pieces to do it now and for the long term? But you never know what’s going to happen each year in baseball. So you just want to provide yourself the best chance to win, hopefully for your entire tenure, hopefully for most of your tenure, whatever it is. “That’s important, knowing that you can provide more value to a team that’s going to be in the postseason and maybe elevate some young guys.” Like many great pitchers, Burnes walks the line between cockiness and confidence. For example, on game planning on a new club, Burnes said his approach was, “Here’s what I’m going to do, kind of whether you guys like it or not, this is how I game plan and how I get prepared … they accepted it, ran with it and some other guys started to take from it as well.” These days, Burnes said, he also likes the role of mentor. Orioles starters Grayson Rodriguez, 24, and Kyle Bradish, 27, have asked Burnes questions ranging from how to bounce back from poor outings to how to game plan and more. He mostly enjoys talking about the mental side of the game, which was why the words from the Mets’ development coach meant so much to him. As Burnes becomes more of a veteran, all the other adjectives he’s long been synonymous with still apply: ace, stalwart, competitive. He doesn’t mind teaching, he said, but he’s also still learning, and it shows. For the first time in his career — and in a platform year, no less — Burnes has pitched for a different club yet consistent success continues. He has fulfilled the role the Orioles envisioned for him when they acquired him in a trade last winter. Advertisement Through 26 starts with Baltimore, Burnes has a 3.28 ERA with 146 strikeouts in 154 1/3 innings. He eyes more. And he’d be quick to say he is capable of better, especially coming off consecutive subpar starts against the Boston Red Sox and Houston Astros — his ERA stood at 2.76 before his those outings. Burnes, who went as far as the league championship series as a rookie in 2018, hopes to help lead the Orioles to the World Series. “I looked at it as, hey, arbitration, you’re pitching in a platform year to maximize your money each year,” Burnes said regarding how he handles the pressure of the season before free agency. “The way I look at it, I’ve been pitching in a platform year for the last three years. “Pitching in a Cy Young race in 2021 kind of was the first experience of, hey, you’re really pitching for something here. You have a chance to do something cool. … It’s been the best thing for me to do to avoid the outside noise and the social media pull to get you away from what you do. … The minute you start digging too much into that, is when you start to lose focus.” The idea of finding out his worth on the open market appeals to Burnes. With the Brewers, he experienced a contentious hearing during arbitration, ahead of the 2023 season. He understood the process but didn’t appreciate everything that was said about him. At the time, he was the rare player who didn’t shy away from voicing his displeasure. He was disappointed that the club didn’t make an effort, in his view, to avoid arbitration and that at the time the relationship with the organization was damaged. A couple of months before the hearing, David Stearns, now the Mets’ president of baseball operations, had already stepped down from the same role with the Brewers and transitioned into an advisory one with Matt Arnold taking over in Milwaukee. Still, Burnes said, he holds no grudges. Burnes said he had a great relationship with Stearns and added he wouldn’t hold anything against Milwaukee, either. The phone will be open to anyone. Not every player embraces the idea of free agency. Burnes does. Advertisement And he makes it easy to understand why. “Early on in my career when I was with Milwaukee, I was always open to staying there my entire career,” Burnes said. “It gets to the point where it either doesn’t look like they want you there long term or don’t feel like they can match your value, whatever it might be. The closer you get to free agency, the closer you get to realizing what the true market value is going to be essentially. “That still holds true being three or four months away from free agency. It’s one of those things that not many guys are able to get to. Some guys sign great extensions and it’s great for them and it works out well. I’m not saying an extension for me years ago would’ve been bad but it’s one of those things where once you get this close, you start to see what other guys have done in the past and what your possible value can be. You get the chance to pick where you want to go. Not many guys get to do that. “So it gets more and more enticing the closer and closer you get to that day.” (Top photo of Corbin Burnes: G Fiume / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

                "content": "Andrés Alfonso Giménez Osorio (born September 4, 1998) is a Venezuelan professional baseball second baseman for the Toronto Blue Jays of Major League Baseball (MLB). He has previously played in MLB for the New York Mets and Cleveland Guardians. He made his MLB debut with the Mets in 2020. Giménez signed with the New York Mets of Major League Baseball (MLB) as an international free agent in July 2015.[1] He made his professional debut in 2016 with the Dominican Summer League Mets and spent the whole season there, batting a combined .350 with three home runs, 38 runs batted in (RBIs), and a .992 on-base plus slugging (OPS). In 2017, he played for the Columbia Fireflies where he slashed .265/.346/.349 with four home runs and 31 RBIs in 92 games.[2][3] After the 2017 season, Baseball America rated Giménez as the Mets' best prospect.[4] He spent the 2018 season with both the St. Lucie Mets and the Binghamton Rumble Ponies, batting .281/.347/.409 with six home runs, 46 RBIs, and 38 stolen bases in 122 total games between the two clubs.[5] That summer, he played in the 2018 All-Star Futures Game.[6] He returned to Binghamton for the 2019 season,[7] hitting .250/.309/.387 with nine home runs, 37 RBIs, and 28 stolen bases over 117 games. The Mets added Giménez to their 40-man roster following the 2019 season.[8] Giménez made the Mets' Opening Day roster in 2020,[9] and made his Major League debut on July 24, 2020, at Citi Field as an eighth inning defensive replacement for Robinson Canó at second base.[10] On July 29, Giménez made his first start, and recorded his first career hit off of Boston Red Sox pitcher Nathan Eovaldi, a single, in the second inning. In the sixth inning of the same game, Giménez tripled off Marcus Walden to record his first career RBI.[11] Giménez received a single vote in National League Rookie of the Year voting, tying him for seventh place with Ian Anderson and Sixto Sánchez.[12] According to Statcast, his sprint speed was tied for fourth-fastest among Major League shortstops on the season.[13] On January 7, 2021, the Mets traded Giménez, Amed Rosario, Josh Wolf, and Isaiah Greene to the Cleveland Indians for Francisco Lindor and Carlos Carrasco.[14][15] Giménez was the team's Opening Day starter at shortstop.[16] Giménez struggled at the start of the season and was demoted to Triple-A on May 18.[17] In 2022 with the renamed Guardians, Giménez experienced a breakout season, batting .297 with 17 home runs and 69 RBI. He was elected to the All Star Game at 2nd base and started as a replacement for the injured Jose Altuve. His reputation as a clutch hitter developed in 2022, as he had a 281 WRC+ in high leverage situations, meaning he nearly tripled the average hitter's production in that position.[18] Giménez won a Gold Glove Award for his performance at second base.[19] He was also selected for the second team on the 2022 All-MLB Team.[20] Prior to the 2023 season, Giménez represented the Venezuelan national baseball team in the 2023 World Baseball Classic.[21] On March 30, Giménez signed a seven-year major league contract with the Guardians worth $106.5 million. The deal includes a club option for the 2030 season.[22] On April 12, 2023, a relay throw to home plate by Giménez struck the head of umpire Larry Vanover, who was hospitalized with non-life threatening injuries.[23] In 2023 he batted .251/.314/.399, had the lowest average exit velocity of all AL batters (84.8 mph), and led the AL in percentage of balls that were softly hit (21.7%).[24][25] On December 10, 2024, Giménez, alongside Nick Sandlin, was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays in exchange for Spencer Horwitz and Nick Mitchell.[26]",

                "content": "CLEVELAND, OH - AUGUST 26: Andrés Giménez #0 of the Cleveland Guardians reacts after scoring in ... [+] the first inning during the game between the Kansas City Royals and the Cleveland Guardians at Progressive Field on Monday, August 26, 2024 in Cleveland, Ohio. (Photo by Lauren Leigh Bacho/MLB Photos via Getty Images) Published reports indicate the Cleveland Guardians have traded three-time Gold Glove second baseman, Andres Gimenez, to the Toronto Blue Jays. It is also being reported that Cleveland pitcher Nick Sandlin is also heading to Toronto in the deal. Kiley McDaniel of ESPN wrote on “X” that infielder Spencer Horwitz is coming to Cleveland in the trade. Horwitz will be joined by prospect outfielder Nick Mitchell, a left-handed hitting outfielder. As of this writing, the teams have not officially announced the deal, which would come as a surprise to Cleveland Guardians fans. The trade is a shock to both teams fan bases. Clearly, the two principals in the trade are Gimenez and Horwitz. CLEVELAND, OHIO - AUGUST 13: Second baseman Andrés Giménez #0 of the Cleveland Guardians dives for ... [+] the throw as Dansby Swanson #7 of the Chicago Cubs steals second base in the seventh inning at Progressive Field on August 13, 2024 in Cleveland, Ohio. (Photo by Jason Miller/Getty Images) A left-handed hitter, Gimenez, 26, was acquired by the (then) Cleveland Indians from the New York Mets in January 2021. Gimenez, infielder Amed Rosario, and outfielder Isaiah Greene were traded to Cleveland by the Mets for shortstop Francisco Lindor, and pitcher Carlos Carrasco. While playing outstanding, acrobatic defensive second base with Cleveland, Gimenez won Gold Gloves in 2022, 2023, and 2024. Gimenez won an American League Platinum Glove in 2023, which is given to the best overall defender in each league. Gimenez was an American League All Star in 2022. Gimenez signed a seven-year, $106.5 million contract with Cleveland in 2023. The length and value of Gimenez’ contract may have contributed to Gimenez being made available in the trade market. Spencer Horwitz will not be eligible for salary arbitration until 2027. He won’t be eligible for free agency until 2030. The Guardians are very careful about the length and value of player contracts, so the team control and annual salary of Horwitz was likely attractive to the Cleveland front office. In addition to being a superb defensive infielder with incredibly quick hands and feet, Gimenez has outstanding speed. A threat to steal at any time, Gimenez has stolen 99 bases, while being caught stealing only 15 times in parts of five big league seasons with Cleveland. There is no question that Gimenez’ offense has declined in the past two seasons. In his All Star 2022 campaign, Gimenez hit .297 in 557 plate appearances. He also stroked 17 home runs. Last year, Gimenez hit .252, with nine home runs in 633 plate appearances. Cleveland fans have grown to expect jaw-dropping defensive plays from Gimenez, as he glides to balls hit to his right, to his left, in front of him, and behind himself. TORONTO, ON - SEPTEMBER 09: Spencer Horwitz #48 of the Toronto Blue Jays runs to the dugout during ... [+] a game against the New York Mets at Rogers Centre on September 09, 2024 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. (Photo by Vaughn Ridley/Getty Images) Left-handed hitting Spencer Horwitz, 27, was a 24th round selection of the Blue Jays in the 2019 Major League Baseball draft. Selected from Radford University (Virginia), Horwitz won’t become eligible for arbitration until 2027. Horwitz received a $100,000 signing bonus by the Blue Jays. Horwitz made his debut with Toronto in June 2023, at the age of 25. This old scout observed and evaluated Horwitz in the 2021 Arizona Fall League. Horwitz hit .375 that fall, and he opened eyes with a good hit tool, and the ability to spray the ball from foul pole to foul pole. Horwitz played first base, and left field that fall, but he profiles best as a second baseman, which is his likely initial position with Cleveland. Horwitz showed some pop in his bat, and made good contact that fall. Last year with Toronto, Horwitz hit .265/357/.433/790 with 19 doubles, 12 homers, and 40 RBIs in 381 plate appearances, covering 97 games. TORONTO, CANADA - AUGUST 9: Spencer Horwitz #48 of the Toronto Blue Jays celebrates hitting a home ... [+] run against the Oakland Athletics during the eighth inning at Rogers Centre on August 9, 2024 in Toronto, Canada. (Photo by Kevin Sousa/Getty Images) Horwitz became a regular with the Blue Jays, playing 41 games at first base, 39 games at second, and serving as the designated hitter 17 times. Scouts like the remaining upside of Spencer Horwitz, with many believing he is just beginning to find his hitting stroke against big league pitching. The Blue Jays are getting one of, if not the best defensive infielders in the game in Andres Gimenez. They are also getting a guy that can steal bases and make things happen. The Guardians are getting a player just beginning to feel his way around a big league diamond, with excellent team control for years to come. Horwitz has some power, some speed, and the same hustle and commitment to excellence as Gimenez. Update: Late Tuesday December 10, the Guardians sent newly acquired Spencer Horwitz to the Pittsburgh Pirates for left-handed pitchers Josh Hartle, and Michael Kennedy, and right-hander Luis Ortiz. Only Ortiz pitched for the parent Pirates last season, going 7-6, with a 3.32 ERA in 32 games. Ortiz will likely be a candidate for the Guardians starting rotation. One Community. Many Voices.

                "content": "Keegan Matheson DALLAS -- The Blue Jays have made their first big splash of the offseason, agreeing to a trade with the Guardians for Andrés Giménez, one of the best defensive infielders in baseball, the team announced on Tuesday. Still just 26, Giménez is only two seasons into a seven-year, $106.5 million extension, meaning he has five years of club control remaining along with a team option for 2030. The Blue Jays, who also acquired right-handed reliever Nick Sandlin in the deal, sent first baseman Spencer Horwitz and Minor League outfielder Nick Mitchell to the Guardians. “Everything about him was attractive,” general manager Ross Atkins said of Giménez on Tuesday. “The work that we did on his bat and the offensive upside that can be there, the teammate -- you know I talk about being a teammate all the time -- we just heard incredible things about the person. As a baserunner, adding that level of speed and that level of athleticism, plus him being here for a long time, all of that was very attractive to us.” TRADE DETAILS:Blue Jays receive: 2B Andrés Giménez, RHP Nick SandlinGuardians receive: 1B Spencer Horwitz, OF Nick Mitchell While Giménez’s offensive profile has changed over the past few seasons, he’s already established himself as one of the premiere defenders in baseball, which fits how the Blue Jays have built this roster. Giménez has primarily played second base for the Guardians, where he’s won Gold Glove Awards in three consecutive seasons. In 2024, Giménez was tied for 7th among all players with a Fielding Run Value of +14. It’s his bat, however, that determines the line between him being a very good player and a star in this league. There are some similarities here to Daulton Varsho, an elite outfield defender by every metric who has worked to do more with the bat. “The elite defense speaks for itself and we have acquired him to play second base for us,” Atkins said, but it’s clear that Giménez could be an excellent option to slide across to shortstop in 2026 and beyond if Bo Bichette departs via free agency. Giménez broke out in 2022, batting .297 with an .837 OPS on top of his defense, all of which came together to produce a player worth 6.1 WAR (FanGraphs). That made Giménez the 12th-most valuable hitter in baseball that season, but his OPS has dropped to .712 and .638 in the two seasons since. He can make an impact with his glove alone at second base, proving to be solid on routine plays and capable of the spectacular, but Giménez will immediately be one of the most important projects for new hitting coach David Popkins and his staff.

So he’s another guy that we spent a lot of time with, our coaching staff’s spent time with during the season and even in the offseason, trying to help him find a little bit more consistency and establish what his best movements look like in the box, having an understanding of his identity as a hitter, what he needs to do to be successful.” The Blue Jays are also excited about the acquisition of Sandlin, who is an uncomfortable look for hitters from the right side and coming off a 3.75 ERA with 68 strikeouts in 57 2/3 innings last season for the Guardians. Given the blatant need in Toronto’s bullpen, even after the club agreed to a two-year, $15 million reunion with Yimi García on Tuesday, Sandlin should be looking at a major opportunity to pitch meaningful innings. The inclusion of Horwitz in the deal could change the way the Blue Jays look at the rest of their offseason, too, given that he was in line to take the majority of the club’s DH at-bats. Will Wagner and potentially even top hitting prospect Orelvis Martinez were projected to see time at second base in 2025, each bringing some offensive upside, but now that the club has steered heavily in the direction of defense at that spot, the now-vacant DH position feels like the perfect opportunity to balance out the move.",

                "content": "Colson Baker (born April 22, 1990), known professionally as Machine Gun Kelly (MGK, stylized in all lowercase), is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, and actor. MGK released four mixtapes between 2007 and 2010 before signing with Puff Daddy's Bad Boy Records, an imprint of Interscope Records the following year. His debut studio album, Lace Up (2012) peaked at number four on the US Billboard 200 and was led by the single \"Wild Boy\" (featuring Waka Flocka Flame), which marked his first entry on the Billboard Hot 100 and received triple platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). His second and third albums, General Admission (2015) and Bloom (2017) were both met with critical praise and similar commercial success; the latter was supported by the single \"Bad Things\" (with Camila Cabello), which peaked at number four on the Billboard Hot 100. His fourth album, Hotel Diablo (2019) further experimented with rap rock. MGK's fifth album, Tickets to My Downfall (2020) saw a complete departure from hip-hop in favor of a pop-punk sound and aesthetic, with its production entirely helmed by Blink-182 drummer Travis Barker. It debuted atop the Billboard 200—becoming the only rock album to do so that year—and was supported by the single \"My Ex's Best Friend\" (featuring blackbear), which peaked within the top 20 of the Billboard Hot 100. Its sequel, Mainstream Sellout (2022) served as his sixth album and matched its commercial success, although critical reception was mixed. MGK had his first starring role in the romantic drama Beyond the Lights (2014), and since appeared in the techno-thriller Nerve (2016), the horror Bird Box (2018), the comedy Big Time Adolescence and portrayed Tommy Lee in the Mötley Crüe biopic The Dirt (both 2019). Colson Baker was born on April 22, 1990, in Houston, Texas.[2][3][4] Baker's parents were both Christian missionaries and moved all around the world during Baker's childhood.[5] He lived in Egypt for the first four years of his life and learned to speak Arabic before he learned English.[6] He later lived in Kenya and Germany, as well as throughout the United States in Texas, Los Angeles, California, and Chicago, Illinois.[7][8] Baker's mother left home when he was nine years old and he and his father moved to Denver, Colorado to live with Baker's aunt. Baker's father fought depression and unemployment. Baker says he had just two school outfits and that he endured bullying from children in his neighborhood.[9] He began listening to rap in the sixth grade, when he attended Hamilton Middle School, a school with an ethnically diverse student body in Denver.[10] While he lived in Cleveland, Baker attended Shaker Heights High School.[10] The first three rappers that got him into the genre of hip hop as a child were Ludacris, Eminem and DMX, with Baker gaining interest in the genre after listening to DMX's \"We Right Here\" from the album The Great Depression (2001).[11] After high school, Baker was kicked out by his father.[12] In March 2009, while he was on the verge of getting evicted, Baker traveled to Harlem's Apollo Theater, where he had consecutive victories, making him the first ever rapper to win at the Apollo Theater.[12][13][clarification needed] He recorded music in his home studio, which he refers to as the \"Rage Cage\",[10] and started to gain exposure when he was featured on MTV2's Sucker Free Freestyle, where he freestyled numerous verses from his \"Chip off the Block\" single. In February 2010, he released his second mixtape 100 Words and Running, where he derived his catchphrase, \"Lace Up\", which started as a mixtape interlude, before making it a prominent reference in his music. Despite his rising popularity, Baker still worked at Chipotle to afford rent. Baker soon also became a father.[12] In May 2010, he made his national debut with the single \"Alice in Wonderland\", which was released on iTunes and accompanied a music video along with the song. It was released via Block Starz Music.[14][15][16] The single earned Baker the \"Best Midwest Artist\" at the 2010 Underground Music Awards and his \"Alice in Wonderland\" clip won Best Music Video at the 2010 Ohio Hip-Hop Awards.[12] He released his second mixtape in November 2010 titled Lace Up which featured the hometown anthem \"Cleveland\", which was then played at Cleveland Cavaliers home games and went on rotation on Z107.9 in Cleveland. The mixtape was recorded in three months in 2010 during a creative burst.[10] Following the release of the mixtape, he was featured in the magazine XXL in 2011.[17] He then appeared on the Juicy J track \"Inhale\", which also featured Steve-O from the television series Jackass, in the music video.[12] In March 2011, Baker participated in his first SXSW show in Austin, Texas, and at the show, he was approached by Sean Combs, who had offered Baker a recording contract with Bad Boy Records, which ran as an imprint of Interscope Records. After Bad Boy parted ways with the label in favor of Epic Records as its distributor in 2015, Baker remained signed with Interscope in a joint venture with Bad Boy.[18] Prior to the contract, he was featured on the XV song \"Finally Home\".[19] Baker announced that his debut album would be titled Lace Up and would have an intended release on October 9, 2012. \"Wild Boy\" served as the lead single for the album and the song peaked on the US Billboard Hot 100 at number 98. It was soon certified gold by the RIAA.[20][21] The song \"Invincible\" was released on iTunes on December 16, 2011, featuring co-writer and singer Ester Dean as the second single of the album.[22] The song is featured in a commercial for the HTC ReZound[23] as well as the official theme song of WrestleMania XXVIII. WWE also used the song to highlight John Cena in his match at the event, with Baker also performing at WrestleMania prior to the main event between Cena and The Rock. \"Invincible\" was also used as the theme for Thursday Night Football when it was on the NFL Network. WWE also used the song \"All We Have\" to again highlight Cena on his rematch with The Rock at next year's event. On December 14, 2011, Baker was named the Hottest Breakthrough MC of 2011 by MTV.[24] On March 18, 2012, Baker won the MTVu Breaking Woodie award[25] before being featured on the cover of XXL as part of their annual \"Top 10 Freshmen list\" along with fellow rappers Macklemore, French Montana, Hopsin, Danny Brown, Iggy Azalea, Roscoe Dash, Future, Don Trip and Kid Ink.[26] On August 13, 2012, Baker self-released a mixtape titled EST 4 Life, which contained both old and recently recorded material.[27] Lace Up was released on October 9, 2012. The album featured guest appearances from Bun B, Cassie, DMX, Ester Dean, Lil Jon, Tech N9ne, Twista, Waka Flocka Flame, Young Jeezy and Dub-O. The album debuted at number 4 on the US Billboard 200, with first-week sales of 57,000 copies.[28] It slid down to No. 22 in its second week, giving it a total of 65,000 copies sold.[29] As of September 2015, the album has sold 263,000 copies.[30] In early 2012, Baker announced that he would be releasing a new mixtape. Pusha T and Meek Mill were the first artists to be featured on the mixtape, both appearing on the track \"Pe$o\". Baker also announced that Wiz Khalifa will be featured on the mixtape.[31] On February 18, 2013, Baker announced the name of the mixtape as Black Flag and revealed the cover. He also released a music video for \"Champions\" which features Diddy and samples The Diplomats song \"We Are the Champions\", as the music video release served as a promotional video for Black Flag.[32] On June 26, Baker released Black Flag without prior announcement.[33] The mixtape also featured guest appearances from French Montana, Kellin Quinn, Dub-O, Sean McGee and Tezo.[34] On June 4, 2013, Baker posted a picture of a letter on his social media accounts which read: This project is dedicated to love, because for my entire life it has been taken from me. Granted, when it was given, I pushed it right back. I couldn't handle it. This was until I experienced the loss of love for what I love doing most: music. That was the one thing worth fighting for, even more-so then[sic] the love of my father. I've found that love again. And I plan on never surrendering it. Find what you love and fight!! Black Flag.[35] Following the release of Black Flag, rumors surfaced that Baker had begun working on his second studio album. In January 2014, he confirmed that he was in the early stages of working on the album, with 2015 being the scheduled year of release.[36] On January 5, 2015, Baker released the song \"Till I Die\", which was accompanied with a music video on his VEVO account. Months later, a remix of \"Till I Die\" with hometown fellow hip-hop group Bone Thugs-n-Harmony was confirmed and released on June 5, 2015. The song aired via WorldStarHipHop and featured French Montana, Yo Gotti and Ray Cash. On May 18, 2015, the music video for another song titled \"A Little More\" was released, with the single featuring vocals from Victoria Monet. Baker soon had an interview with MTV, describing the reason as to why he wrote \"A Little More\". Stating in the interview: \"People always came up to me after the first album and a lot of my friends back home said 'we need something for the streets' and then I did 'Till I Die'. Months later, when I look back at the video [for Till I Die] I [was] like 'Okay, he's in jail, he's shot, he's dead, he snitched' and just to the point where it's sad and I wrote the song to describe how I see the world as a much mature person.\" He also updated the status on his second studio album, noting that the album is finished, and stating that the album would contain \"more lyricism and [would be more] stylistically [influenced by] hip-hop but musically, sonically [would contain] more live instrumentation.\"[37] On June 25, Baker released the title of his second album as General Admission, due to be released in late September 2015.[38] In February, Baker appeared at Fastlane, which was hosted at the Quicken Loans Arena in downtown Cleveland. Baker released \"Bad Things\" in late 2016,[39] a joint single with Camila Cabello, which has reached a peak of number four on the US Billboard Hot 100.[40] Baker was going to be the opening act on the North American leg of Linkin Park's One More Light Tour before the tour was cancelled due to Linkin Park frontman Chester Bennington's suicide.[41] Baker would subsequently pay tribute to Bennington by releasing an acoustic cover of the Linkin Park song \"Numb\".[42] On September 3, 2018, Baker released the song \"Rap Devil\". The track was a response to Eminem's diss track \"Not Alike\" off of his album Kamikaze. Playing on Eminem's own \"Rap God\" single, the track accuses Eminem of trying to sideline Baker's career after a comment Baker made in 2012 about Eminem's teenage daughter, Hailie. Baker publicly stated on his Twitter account that on the response track he was \"standing up for not just myself, but my generation. [I'm] doing the same shit you did back in your day.\"[43] \"Rap Devil\" topped the iTunes Chart on September 10, 2018.[44] On September 14, Eminem responded to \"Rap Devil\" with his diss track, \"Killshot\".[45] On September 21, 2018, Baker released his second extended play (EP), Binge, which had first week sales of 21,519 units and debuted at 24 on the Billboard 200. It was preceded by the singles \"Loco\" and \"Rap Devil\", and coincided with the release of his Ronny J-produced single, \"Lately\" that same day. The EP saw largely unfavorable critical response.[46][47][48][49] In April 2019, Billboard reported that Baker's upcoming album would be titled Hotel Diablo. The first single, \"Hollywood Whore\", was released on May 17, 2019. The second single, \"El Diablo\", was released on May 31, 2019. On June 7, 2019, Baker released the third single, \"I Think I'm Okay\", with Yungblud and Travis Barker, a pop punk song.

On September 29, 2020, a music video was released for the Tickets to my Downfall song \"Drunk Face\", directed by Mod Sun,[62] which was followed on October 22, 2020, by a music video for \"Forget Me Too\".[63] Throughout October 2020, the four episodes of Halloween in Hell, a fictionalised musical horror podcast that Baker created and starred in, were released. The series also starred Iann Dior, 24kGoldn, Dana Dentata, Phem and Tommy Lee.[64] The podcast was accompanied by the album Audio Up presents: Original Music from Halloween In Hell a soundtrack performed collaboratively by all the actors involved, and written and composed by Jared Gutstadt.[65] Baker directed the music video for Mod Sun's song \"Karma\", which was released on November 12, 2020.[66] On November 22, 2020, after his performance at the AMAs, Baker announced his album Tickets to My Downfall was going to be turned into a \"first of its kind musical film experience\" titled Downfalls High which will air in January 2021.[67] On November 30, 2020, Yungblud announced on Twitter he'll be releasing a new collaboration featuring Baker and Travis Barker titled \"Acting Like That\".[68] On January 15, 2021, Baker released Downfalls High on his Facebook page followed by a release to YouTube on January 18.[69][70] Directed by Baker and Mod Sun and narrated by Baker and Barker, the film stars Chase Hudson and Sydney Sweeney as teenage lovers in what Baker described as a \"pop-punk [version of] Grease\".[70][71] Iann Dior, Phem, Jxdn, and Trippie Redd, also make appearances.[70] On March 12, 2021, he released the single \"DayWalker\" featuring Corpse Husband.[72] On April 29, he released the single \"Love Race\" featuring Kellin Quinn, the pair's third collaboration.[73] On August 9, 2021, he announced that his next album would be titled Born with Horns and would be another collaborative project with Barker.[74] The first single, \"Papercuts\", was released on August 11.[75] On January 30, 2022, he posted a preview of a collaboration with singer Willow titled \"Emo Girl\".[76] On August 26, 2021, it was announced that he would star in and co-direct the film Good Mourning, alongside Mod Sun, Dove Cameron, Megan Fox and Becky G.[77] On February 5, 2022, MGK performed during the 2022 NHL All-Star Game halftime show in Las Vegas.[78] On January 31, 2022, he announced that the album had been retitled to Mainstream Sellout.[79][80] Critical reception was mixed.[81] Baker's musical style has been mainly described as hip hop,[82] pop-rap,[83] and rap rock.[82] His fifth album, Tickets to My Downfall, marked a change in sound and has been described as pop-punk[82][84] and alternative rock.[85][86] Baker cites DMX and Eminem as music influences, as well as listening to rock bands Guns N' Roses and Blink-182 during his youth. Baker cites these rap and rock artists as major musical influences.[87] In an interview discussing his collaboration with DMX, Baker called the rapper his idol. He also stated that DMX's music helped him through his troubles while growing up, especially bullying.[88] Baker made his film debut in the 2014 romantic drama Beyond the Lights, where he played a \"shallow, self-important\" rapper named Kid Culprit.[89] In 2016, he co-starred and co-executive produced the drama film The Land, a Cleveland-set drama produced by fellow rapper Nas.[90] The same year, he had a minor role in the techno-thriller adventure film Nerve with Emma Roberts and Dave Franco; and had a recurring role on the Showtime comedy-drama series Roadies as Wes, a former Pearl Jam roadie.[91][92] He played Felix in the 2018 Netflix post-apocalyptic horror thriller film Bird Box with Sandra Bullock, and portrayed drummer Tommy Lee in The Dirt, a 2019 Netflix biographical comedy-drama about Mötley Crüe.[93] He played the role of Newt in the 2020 superhero film Project Power opposite Jamie Foxx,[94] and the following year, he co-starred with Bruce Willis and Megan Fox in the crime thriller film Midnight in the Switchgrass; and starred in the action western film The Last Son with Sam Worthington.[95] Baker played the role of \"London Clash\" in the self-directed film Good Mourning, released in 2022.[96] In his teens, Baker was in a relationship with Emma Cannon, with whom he has a daughter,[8] who was born in July 2009.[97] He is open about his use of cannabis and has claimed in interviews that he smokes daily, describing it as a \"source of happiness and a way people can feel a little more love [in their own right]\". He has frequently mentioned cannabis references within sources of his music and rap persona, making it a forefront of both his rap and personal character.[98] Before the release of Lace Up, he had an addiction to heroin.[5] He was also a heavy user of cocaine and alcohol before 2020,[99] when he revealed that he had become addicted to Adderall and was seeking treatment.[100] In a 2012 interview, he stated that he identifies politically as an anarchist.[101] In 2022, when he was asked on whether he plans to vote in the midterm elections, he replied: \"I have anarchy tattooed on my stomach. I'm not a political person\".[102] In May 2020, he began a relationship with actress Megan Fox after the two met while filming Midnight in the Switchgrass.[103][104] On January 12, 2022, Fox announced that the two were engaged.[105] In March 2024, Fox revealed that the couple had called their engagement off.[106] In November 2024, Fox revealed on Instagram that she was pregnant with his child, following a miscarriage earlier in their relationship.[107][108] In 2021, Baker reverted back to his birth name, Colson Baker.[95] Baker's feud with Eminem began on May 7, 2012, when he wrote a tweet saying that Eminem's daughter Hailie was \"hot as fuck\", despite her being 16 at the time. In an interview with WQHT on October 19, 2015, Baker alleged this led to Eminem blacklisting him from a number of radio stations.[109] On May 16, 2017, Baker performed a freestyle for KPWR, which featured a line referencing Eminem's supposed banning of him from Shade 45.[110] On March 1, 2018, Baker featured on a verse of Tech N9ne's song, \"No Reason\". Shortly after, on August 31, 2018, Eminem released his diss track \"Not Alike,\" where he claimed that Baker's verse on the song was about him. On September 3, 2018, Baker responded to this with his own diss track \"Rap Devil\". On September 12, 2018, Eminem released an interview with Sway Calloway through his YouTube channel where he discussed his reason behind the feud. On September 14, 2018, Eminem released \"Killshot,\" in response to \"Rap Devil\". On January 17, 2020, Eminem released the song \"Unaccommodating,\" which featured a verse directed at Baker.[109] On March 17, 2020, Baker released the song \"Bullets with Names,\" featuring Young Thug, RJMrLA and Lil Duke, which featured a verse directed at Eminem.[57] On December 18, 2020, Eminem released the song \"Gnat\". In this song, Eminem dissed Baker in the chorus.[111] On December 15, 2021, Dr. Dre released a song titled \"Gospel\" off his new EP The Contract featuring Eminem. In this song, Eminem dissed Baker again.[112] In January 2022, fans speculated the feud would reignite after TikToker Hannah Neuman (@unluckyp1ckle) resurfaced a 2013 interview with Fuse.tv, wherein a then 23 year old Baker said he had a crush on an underage Kendall Jenner and wouldn't wait until she was 18 to pursue her.[113][114] Baker continued the interview by praising other celebrities like Robert Plant and Axl Rose for their relationships with a 14 and 16 year old girl, respectively, prompting commenters to spotlight Baker's past comments about Hailie once again.[115] In response to the backlash, Baker tweeted a quote from Eminem's song, \"The Way I Am,\" furthering the speculation about the controversy rekindling their feud.[116] Eminem declined to comment on either situation, however. Baker's feud with G-Eazy began after the end of G-Eazy's relationship with Halsey, when photographs of Baker and Halsey together surfaced. On July 18, 2018, G-Eazy revealed that he had bleached his hair blond, which Baker alleged on Twitter was in an attempt to look like him. On August 30, 2018, G-Eazy released the diss track \"Bad Boy\" against Baker, who responded the next day in a freestyle performed for Hot 97. The same day, Baker tweeted side-by-side photos of the two, with the caption \"I fucked his girl now he looks like me this shit overbearing\".[117] In the track \"Killshot\", Eminem defended G-Eazy and the two ended the feud in April 2019, through what NME described as an \"intervention by Eminem\".[118] In October 2019, G-Eazy stated that Kid Cudi is the reason why the feud ended.[119] In 2021, Baker engaged in a feud with Slipknot frontman Corey Taylor after being alluded to in an interview where Taylor stated: \"I hate all new rock for the most part – well, the artists who failed in one genre and decided to go rock. And I think he knows who he is, but that's another story.\"[120] At Riot Fest in September 2021, Baker and Slipknot were scheduled to play on the same day and time, albeit on different stages. Baker took the opportunity to respond to Taylor's comments, beginning his set by asking the crew to light the crowd so he could \"see who chose to be here instead of with all the old weird dudes with masks.\" He later insulted the band again by stating, \"You wanna know what I'm really happy that I'm not doing? Being 50 years old, wearing a fuckin' weird mask on a fuckin' stage, talking shit.\"[121][122] Later on, Baker revealed on Twitter that Taylor was originally meant to feature on \"Can't Look Back\", a song for the deluxe edition of Tickets to My Downfall, but the collaboration did not come to fruition because Baker thought the verse was \"fucking terrible\" and accused Taylor of being bitter about not being featured on the album.[123] Taylor responded to the tweet by sharing screenshots of emails between himself and Travis Barker, producer of Tickets to My Downfall, that showed he was the one who respectfully declined to appear on the track due to creative differences. In response, Baker stated that he had simply wanted Taylor to rewrite his verse, reiterating his previous assertion that it was \"really bad.\"[124] Taylor later addressed the feud during a fan Q&A in January 2022 where he claimed that Baker had started it. He went on to insult Baker's change in musical direction and told him to \"suck every inch of my dick.\"[125][126] In July 2022, Baker admitted in his Life in Pink documentary that he regretted his feud with Taylor and wished that both of them handled the situation better instead of acting \"ridiculous\".[127] In 2023, Taylor also expressed remorse regarding the feud they had, even clarifying that the two singers have a lot in common, saying: \"He and I are very similar in certain ways. Which, shock and awe. Big-mouth singers. We are big-mouth singers\".[128] Studio albums Headlining tours Co-headlining tours For film roles, he is credited as Colson Baker unless otherwise noted.",

One such group of survivors lives on a small island connected to the mainland by a single, heavily-defended causeway. When one of the group leaves the island on a mission into the dark heart of the mainland, he discovers secrets, wonders, and horrors that have mutated not only the infected but other survivors as well.\"[4] In June 2007, Fox Atomic confirmed development on a third 28 Days Later film, dependent upon the financial performance of 28 Weeks Later following its home video release.[5] In July of the same year, Danny Boyle said that the story for a third installment had been mapped out.[6] By October 2010, Alex Garland stated that due to differences involving the film rights, the project had been delayed.[7] In January 2011, Boyle stated that he believed the project would be realised, stating confirming further developments for the story.[8] By April 2013, however, the filmmaker expressed uncertainty as to whether the movie would be made.[9] In January 2015, Garland addressed the project's status, confirming that while it had fallen into development hell there were serious discussions going on behind the scenes to produce the project. Reiterating that development was progressing, stating that the script he was working on would tentatively be titled 28 Months Later.[10] In June 2019, Boyle confirmed that he and Garland had been working on the third installment.[11] In March 2020, Imogen Poots expressed interest in reprising her role from the second film,[12] followed by Cillian Murphy in May 2021.[13] In November 2022, Boyle, Garland and actor Murphy all indicated their interest in making a sequel to 28 Days Later.[14] In June 2023, Boyle and Garland expressed in collaboration their intentions to \"seriously\" and \"diligently\" see the project enter production; while announcing that the script was now titled 28 Years Later, acknowledging the years it had taken to be developed. Boyle stated that he would like to serve as director, unless Garland chooses to.[15] By July of the same year, Murphy stated that he had recently discussed the possibility of a third film with Boyle; once again expressing interest in reprising his role if Boyle and Garland return to the franchise in their creative roles.[16] In January 2024, it was announced that a third film titled 28 Years Later was officially in development; with plans for the project to be the first of a new trilogy of sequels. Danny Boyle will direct the first installment, with a script written by Alex Garland; while the latter will also write the scripts for each of planned sequels. Boyle, Garland, Andrew Macdonald, and Peter Rice will serve as producers.[17][18] In February of the same year, Murphy discussed his potential involvement with the project; that same month, MacDonald had bought back the rights to the first film from Searchlight Pictures, promptly selling it to Sony Pictures for future distribution, as well as rights to future sequels.[a][19][20][21] In March 2024, Garland confirmed that he is writing a trilogy of sequel films.[22] The following month, the writer stated that the film Kes was a major influence on his work for 28 Years Later.[23] Murphy was revealed as an executive producer later that month.[24] In April, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Jodie Comer and Ralph Fiennes were cast to star,[25] with Jack O'Connell joining the cast,[26] and Murphy being confirmed to reprise his role as Jim.[27] Erin Kellyman was added to the cast in June.[28] Principal photography began on 7 May 2024, in Northumberland,[29][30] with Anthony Dod Mantle serving as the cinematographer.[31] Filming wrapped on 29 July.[32] The film was notably shot on an iPhone 15 Pro Max with the aid of numerous specialised attachments.[33] Filming mainly took place in the north of England, in the North East and Yorkshire and the Humber regions. Locations include Holy Island (Lindisfarne) off the Northumberland Coast, Hexham, Bellingham, Kielder Forest, Rothbury (Northumberland), Newcastle upon Tyne (Tyne and Wear), Waskerley (County Durham), Melsonby, Ripon, Fountains Abbey, Aysgarth Falls, Redmire (North Yorkshire) and Bradford (West Yorkshire).[34][35][36][37][38] Some scenes were filmed at Plankey Mill Farm, near Langley and Bardon Mill (Northumberland).[35] In addition, some filming took place in Cheddar Gorge in Somerset in South West England.[39] 28 Years Later is scheduled to be released in the United Kingdom, United States and Canada by Sony Pictures Releasing on 20 June 2025.[40] The first trailer was released on 10 December 2024. It features the 1903 poem \"Boots\" by Rudyard Kipling, recited by American actor Taylor Holmes in 1915. The trailer became #1 trending on Youtube. Stuart Heritage, the film critic for the The Guardian, particularly noted the use of Holmes spoken-word recording of Boots and commented \"As of now, though, it’s just about the most exciting film of 2025. And this is entirely down to its trailer.\"[41][42] In April 2024, Nia DaCosta entered early negotiations to direct the second film in the new trilogy of sequels, with Boyle, Garland, Andrew Macdonald, Peter Rice, and Bernie Bellew attached as producers.[43] The following month, DaCosta was confirmed to have signed onto the project as director. The movie is filming back-to-back with 28 Years Later,[43] with principal photography beginning on 19 August 2024.[44] The film's title was revealed as 28 Years Later Part II: The Bone Temple.[45]",

                "content": "Real Madrid Club de Fútbol (Spanish pronunciation: [reˈal maˈðɾið ˈkluβ ðe ˈfuðβol] ⓘ), commonly referred to as Real Madrid, is a Spanish professional football club based in Madrid. The club competes in La Liga, the top tier of Spanish football. Founded in 1902 as Madrid Football Club, the club has traditionally worn a white home kit since its inception. The honorific title real is Spanish for \"royal\" and was bestowed to the club by King Alfonso XIII in 1920 alongside with the crown in the club crest. Real Madrid have played their home matches in the 85,000-capacity Santiago Bernabéu in Madrid since 1947. Unlike most European sporting clubs, Real Madrid's members (socios) have owned and operated the club throughout its history. The official Madrid anthem is the \"Hala Madrid y nada más\", written by RedOne and Manuel Jabois.[8] The club is one of the most widely supported in the world and is the most followed football club on social media according to the CIES Football Observatory as of 2023.[9][10] It was estimated to be worth $6.6 billion in 2024, making it the world's most valuable football club.[11] In 2024, Real Madrid become the first football club to make €1 billion ($1.08bn) in revenue according to the club's announcement.[12] In domestic football, the club has won 71 trophies; a record 36 La Liga titles, 20 Copa del Rey, 13 Supercopa de España, a Copa Eva Duarte and a Copa de la Liga.[13] In International football, Real Madrid have won a record 34 trophies: a record 15 European Cup/UEFA Champions League titles, a record six UEFA Super Cups, two UEFA Cups, a joint record two Latin Cups, a record one Iberoamerican Cup, and a record eight FIFA Club World championships.[note 1] Madrid was ranked first in the International Federation of Football History & Statistics Club World Ranking for 2000, 2002, 2014, 2017.[17] In UEFA, Madrid ranks first in the all-time club ranking.[18][19] Being one of the three founding members of La Liga that have never been relegated from the top division since its inception in 1929 (along with Athletic Bilbao and Barcelona), Real Madrid has many long-standing rivalries, most notably El Clásico with Barcelona and El Derbi Madrileño with Atlético Madrid. The club established itself as a major force in both Spanish and European football during the 1950s and 60s, winning five consecutive and six overall European Cups and reaching a further two finals. This success was replicated on the domestic front, with Madrid winning 12 league titles in 16 years. This team, which included Alfredo Di Stéfano, Ferenc Puskás, Paco Gento and Raymond Kopa is considered, by some in the sport, to be the greatest of all time.[20][21] Real Madrid is known for its Galácticos policy, which involves signing the world's best players, such as Ronaldo, Zinedine Zidane and David Beckham to create a superstar team.[22] The term 'Galácticos policy' generally refers to the two eras of Florentino Pérez's presidency of the club (2000–2006 and 2009–2018); however, players brought in just before his tenure are sometimes considered to be part of the Galácticos legacy. A notable example is Steve McManaman, who like many other players also succeeded under the policy.[23] On 26 June 2009, Madrid signed Cristiano Ronaldo for a record-breaking £80 million (€94 million);[24] he became both the club's and history's all-time top goalscorer.[25][26][27][28] Madrid have recently relaxed the Galácticos policy, instead focusing on signing young talents such as Vinícius Júnior, Rodrygo, Jude Bellingham[29] and Kylian Mbappé.[30][31] Real Madrid is recognised as the greatest football club of the 20th century by FIFA and as the best European club during the same timeframe by the IFFHS,[32] while also receiving the FIFA Centennial Order of Merit in 2004.[33] Real Madrid has the highest participations in the European Cup/Champions League (43),[18] a tournament in which they hold the overall record for the most wins, most draws and most goals scored.[34] Real Madrid is the only club to have won three consecutive titles (three-peat) in the European Cup/Champions League twice, first in 1955–56, 1956–57, and 1957–58, and second in 2015–16, 2016–17 and 2017–18. In June 2024, they won a record-extending 15th Champions League title (the fifth in nine seasons), recognised as such by Guinness World Records.[35] Real Madrid is the first club across all of Europe's top-five leagues to win 100 trophies in all competitions.[36] As of July 2024,[update] Real Madrid are ranked 2nd in the UEFA club rankings and first in last 10 years (2013–2023) overall.[37][38] Real Madrid's origins go back to when football was introduced to Madrid by the academics and students of the Institución Libre de Enseñanza, which included several Cambridge and Oxford University graduates.[39] They founded (Sociedad) Sky Football in 1897, commonly known as La Sociedad (The Society) as it was the only one based in Madrid, playing on Sunday mornings at Moncloa. In 1900, conflict between members caused some of them to leave and create a new club, Nueva Sociedad de Football (New Society of Football), to distinguish themselves from Sky Football. Among the dissenters were Julián Palacios, recognized as the first Real Madrid president, Juan Padrós and Carlos Padrós, the latter two being brothers and future presidents of Real Madrid. In 1901, this new club was renamed as Madrid Football Club. Later, following a restructuring in 1902, Sky was renamed as \"New Foot-Ball Club\".[40][41][42] On 6 March 1902, after a new Board presided by Juan Padrós had been elected, Madrid Football Club was officially founded.[7] The Padrós brothers summoned other football enthusiasts to a meeting in the back room of Al Capricho, the family business. They viewed football as a mass sport that should be accessible to representatives of all social classes, and thought the new club should embody that idea. The brothers proposed the name, Madrid Football Club, which was unanimously accepted. The membership fee was also set, two pesetas a month, and the color of the shirt was chosen to be white in honour of a famous English team Corinthian, which Juan Padrós had met on one of his trips.[43][44] Three years after its founding, in 1905, Madrid FC won its first title after defeating Athletic Bilbao in the Spanish Cup final. The club became one of the founding sides of the Royal Spanish Football Federation on 4 January 1909, when club president Adolfo Meléndez signed the foundation agreement of the Spanish FA. After moving between several grounds, the team relocated to the Campo de O'Donnell in 1912.[45] In 1920, the club's name was changed to Real Madrid after King Alfonso XIII granted the title of Real (Royal) to the club.[46] In 1929, the first Spanish football league was founded. Real Madrid led the first league season until the last match, a loss to Athletic Bilbao, meant they finished runners-up to Barcelona.[47] Real Madrid won its first league title in the 1931–32 season and retained it the following year.[48] On 14 April 1931, the arrival of the Second Spanish Republic caused the club to lose the title Real and the royal crown on its emblem, going back to being named Madrid Football Club until the end of the Spanish Civil War. Football continued during the Second World War, and on 13 June 1943, Madrid beat Barcelona 11–1 in the second leg of the Copa del Generalísimo semi-finals, the Spanish Cup having been renamed in honour of General Franco.[note 2][49] The first leg, played at the Les Corts in Catalonia, had ended with Barcelona winning 3–0. Madrid complained about all the three goals that referee Fombona Fernández had allowed for Barcelona,[50] with the home supporters also whistling Madrid throughout, whom they accused of employing roughhouse tactics, and Fombona for allowing them to. The newspaper Ya reported the whistling as a \"clear intention to attack the representatives of Spain.\"[51] Barcelona fans were banned from traveling to Madrid. The day of the second leg, the Barcelona team were insulted and stones were thrown at their bus as soon as they left their hotel. Barcelona's striker Mariano Gonzalvo said of the incident, \"Five minutes before the game had started, our penalty area was already full of coins.\" Barcelona goalkeeper Luis Miró rarely approached his line—when he did, he was armed with stones. As Francisco Calvet told the story, \"They were shouting: Reds! Separatists!... a bottle just missed Sospedra that would have killed him if it had hit him. It was all set up.\"[52] Real Madrid went 2–0 up within half an hour. The third goal brought with it a sending off for Barcelona's Benito García after he made what Calvet claimed was a \"completely normal tackle\". Madrid's José Llopis Corona recalled: \"At which point, they got a bit demoralized,\" while Ángel Mur countered, \"at which point, we thought: 'go on then, score as many as you want'.\"[53] Madrid made it 8–0 by half-time; two goals were also ruled out for offside, and proceeded to score a further three goals in the second half, to which Barcelona replied with a late consolation goal.[54] According to football writer Sid Lowe, \"There have been relatively few mentions of the game [since] and it is not a result that has been particularly celebrated in Madrid. Indeed, the 11–1 occupies a far more prominent place in Barcelona's history. This was the game that first formed the identification of Madrid as the team of the dictatorship and Barcelona as its victims.\"[50] Fernando Argila, Barcelona's reserve goalkeeper from the 1943 match, said: \"There was no rivalry. Not, at least, until that game.\"[55] Santiago Bernabéu became president of Real Madrid in 1943.[56] Under his presidency, the club was rebuilt after the Civil War, and he oversaw the construction of the club's current stadium, Estadio Real Madrid Club de Fútbol (now known as the Santiago Bernabéu), and its training facilities Ciudad Deportiva. Additionally, during the 1950s former Real Madrid Amateurs player Miguel Malbo founded Real Madrid's youth academy, or \"cantera,\" known today as La Fábrica. Beginning in 1953, he embarked upon a strategy of signing world-class players from abroad, the most prominent being Alfredo Di Stéfano.[57] In 1955, acting upon the idea proposed by Gabriel Hanot, a French sports journalist and editor of L'Équipe, Bernabéu, Ernest Bedrignan (deputy chairman of the Ligue de Football Professionnel)[58] and Gusztáv Sebes created the European Cup, a continental tournament for the league champions around Europe, which is today known as the UEFA Champions League.[59] It was under Bernabéu's guidance that Real Madrid established itself as a major force in both Spanish and European football. The club won the European Cup five times in a row between 1956 and 1960, which included the 7–3 Hampden Park final against Eintracht Frankfurt in 1960.[57] After these five consecutive successes, Real was permanently awarded the original cup and earned the right to wear the UEFA badge of honour.[60] Real Madrid's achievements in Europe were built upon its unprecedented domestic dominance, with the club winning twelve league titles out of sixteen possible from 1953–54 to 1968–69, including a five-in-a-row sequence in 1961–65, and finishing runners-up a further three times.[61] The club won the European Cup for a sixth time in 1966, defeating Partizan Belgrade 2–1 in the final with a team composed entirely of same nationality players, a first in the competition.[62] This team became known as the Yé-yé. The name \"Yé-yé\" came from the \"Yeah, yeah, yeah\" chorus in The Beatles' song \"She Loves You\" after four members of the team posed for Marca and impersonated the Beatles.[63] The Yé-yé generation was also European Cup runners-up in 1962[64] and 1964.[62] In the 1970s, Real Madrid won six league championships and three Spanish Cups.[65] The club competed in its first European Cup Winners' Cup in 1970–71 and progressed all the way to the final, where it lost to English side Chelsea 2–1 in a replay.[66] On 2 July 1978, club president Santiago Bernabéu died while the World Cup was being played in Argentina. FIFA decreed three days of mourning to honour him during the tournament.[67] The following year, the club organized the first edition of the Trofeo Santiago Bernabéu in memory of its former president. Bernabéu had been Real Madrid's president for almost 35 years, during which his club won one Intercontinental Cup, six European Cups, 16 league titles, six Spanish Cups, two Latin Cups and one Copa Eva Duarte.[68] In the early 1980s, Real Madrid had lost its grasp on the La Liga title, until a new cohort of home-grown stars brought domestic success back to the club.[69][70] Spanish sports journalist Julio César Iglesias gave to this generation the name La Quinta del Buitre (\"Vulture's Cohort\"), which was derived from the nickname given to one of its members, Emilio Butragueño. The other four members were Manolo Sanchís, Martín Vázquez, Míchel and Miguel Pardeza. All five footballers were graduates of Real Madrid's youth academy.[69][70] With La Quinta del Buitre (reduced to four members when Pardeza left for Zaragoza in 1986) and notable players like goalkeeper Francisco Buyo, right-back Miguel Porlán Chendo and Mexican striker Hugo Sánchez, Real Madrid had one of the best teams in Spain and Europe during the second half of the 1980s, winning two UEFA Cups, five Spanish championships in a row, one Spanish Cup, and three Spanish Super Cups.[69][70] In the early 1990s, La Quinta del Buitre split up after Martín Vázquez, Emilio Butragueño and Míchel left the club. In 1996, President Lorenzo Sanz appointed Fabio Capello as coach.[71] Although his tenure lasted only one season, Real Madrid were proclaimed league champions, and players like Predrag Mijatović, Davor Šuker, Clarence Seedorf, Roberto Carlos and keeper Bodo Illgner, arrived at the club to strengthen a squad that already boasted the likes of Raúl, Fernando Hierro and Fernando Redondo. As a result, Real Madrid (with the addition of Fernando Morientes in 1997) finally ended its 32-year wait for its seventh European Cup: in 1998, under manager Jupp Heynckes, they defeated Juventus 1–0 in the final with a goal from Mijatović.[72] In November 1999, Vicente del Bosque took over as coach. For the last season of the century, 1999–2000, the squad was still led by the older veterans such as Fernando Hierro, Fernando Redondo, Roberto Carlos and Raúl. Real added the budding young talents of Guti and Iker Casillas, supported by the arrival of Steve McManaman and Nicolas Anelka from the English Premier League, alongside local talents Míchel Salgado and Iván Helguera. In Del Bosque's first season in charge, Real won the Champions League for the eighth time, following a 3–0 victory over Valencia in the final, with goals from Morientes, McManaman and Raúl.[73] This victory marked the beginning of a successful period in Real Madrid's history.[74] In July 2000, Florentino Pérez was elected club president.[75] He vowed in his campaign to erase the club's €270 million debt and modernize the club's facilities. However, the primary electoral promise that propelled Pérez to victory was the signing of Luís Figo from arch-rivals Barcelona.[76] The following year, the club had its training ground rezoned and used the money to begin assembling the Galácticos team by signing a global star every summer, which included Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo, Luís Figo, David Beckham and Fabio Cannavaro.[77] It is debatable whether the gamble paid off, as despite winning the UEFA Champions League and an Intercontinental Cup in 2002, followed by La Liga in 2003, the club failed to win a major trophy for the next three seasons. Off the field, the Zidanes y Pavones policy resulted in increased financial success based on the exploitation of the club's high marketing potential around the world, particularly in Asia.[78] The few days after the capturing of the 2003 La Liga title were surrounded with controversy. The first controversial decision came when Pérez sacked winning coach Vicente del Bosque.[79] Over a dozen players left the club, including Madrid captain Fernando Hierro, while defensive midfielder Claude Makélélé refused to take part in training in protest at being one of the lowest-paid players at the club and subsequently moved to Chelsea.[80] \"That's a lot [of players leaving] when the normal rule is: never change a winning team,\" stated Zidane.[81] Real Madrid, with newly appointed coach Carlos Queiroz, started their domestic league slowly after a hard win over Real Betis.[81] The 2005–06 season began with the promise of several new signings: Júlio Baptista (€24 million), Robinho (€30 million), and Sergio Ramos (€27 million).[82] However, Real Madrid suffered from some poor results, including a 0–3 loss at the hands of Barcelona at the Santiago Bernabéu in November 2005.[83] Madrid's coach Wanderley Luxemburgo was sacked the following month and his replacement was Juan Ramón López Caro.[84] A brief return to form came to an abrupt halt after Madrid lost the first leg of the Copa del Rey semi-finals 6–1 to Real Zaragoza,[85] a defeat that was nearly reversed with a 4–0 home victory. Shortly after, Real Madrid were eliminated from the Champions League for a fourth successive year, this time at the hands of Arsenal. On 27 February 2006, Florentino Pérez resigned.[86] Ramón Calderón was elected as club president on 2 July 2006 and subsequently appointed Fabio Capello as the new coach and Predrag Mijatović as the new sporting director. Real Madrid won the Liga title in 2007 for the first time in four years, but Capello was nonetheless sacked at the end of the campaign.[87] The title was won on 17 June, where Real faced Mallorca at the Bernabéu while Barcelona and Sevilla, the other title challengers, faced Gimnàstic de Tarragona and Villarreal, respectively. At half-time, Real were 0–1 down, while Barcelona had surged ahead into a 0–3 lead in Tarragona. However, three goals in the last half-hour secured Madrid a 3–1 win and their first league title since 2003.[88] Real Madrid repeated as league winners in 2007–08, but the following season ended up being one of the most disastrous in the club's history: Real was knocked out of the Champions League at the round of 16 stage for the fifth time in a row, losing to Liverpool 0–5 on aggregate, and was embarrassed by Barcelona at the Santiago Bernabéu with a humiliating 2–6 loss, which all but confirmed the league title for Barça that went on to win the treble.[89] On 1 June 2009, Florentino Pérez regained Real Madrid's presidency amid the outrage over the club's decline.[90][91] Pérez continued with the Galácticos policy pursued in his first term, buying Kaká from Milan for a record-breaking (in pounds sterling) sum of £56 million,[92] and then breaking the record again by purchasing Cristiano Ronaldo from Manchester United for £80 million.[93] Real Madrid spent in excess of €261 million in the summer of 2009, and the assembled team was soon dubbed the Second Galácticos.[94] The 2009–10 season, however, was a transitional one as Madrid again finished second in the league, although this time amassing 96 points, the club's record at the time, and went out of the Champions League at the hands of Lyon. The season was marred by Cristiano Ronaldo's injury, that sidelined him for seven weeks,[95] although he still topped the goalscoring charts with 33 goals, and Madrid became the highest scoring team in La Liga, with 102 goals. Real Madrid also had the misfortune to become the runners-up with the highest points total in the history of Europe's top five leagues, until surpassed by Liverpool's 97 points in 2018–19.[96][97] José Mourinho took over as manager in May 2010.[98][99] In the 2010–11 season, the rebuilt Madrid successfully fought on all fronts, going toe to toe with a brilliant Barcelona side which some regard as the greatest team in football history. Ultimately, Madrid finished second in the league, with 92 points and four behind their perennial rivals, defeated them in the Copa del Rey final, and lost to Barça in the Champions League semi-finals, where Real progressed to for the first time since 2002–03. Moreover, from 16 April through 3 May, a rare occurrence happened when, for the first time ever, four Clásicos were to be played in a span of just 18 days. The first fixture was in the league campaign on 16 April (which ended 1–1 with penalty goals for both sides), the second one was in the Copa del Rey final (which was won by Madrid 1–0 a.e.t., bringing them their first trophy in the second Galáctico era) on 20 April and the third and fourth ones in the controversial[100][101] two-legged Champions League semi-finals on 27 April and 3 May (Barcelona won on aggregate with a 2–0 away victory and a 1–1 home draw).[102] Madrid again became the highest scoring team in La Liga, with 102 goals, repeating its output from the previous season, with Ronaldo scoring 40 and winning the European Golden Shoe. In the 2011–12 season, Real Madrid won La Liga for a record 32nd time in its history, also finishing the season with numerous league records set, including 100 points amassed in a single season, a total of 121 goals scored, a goal difference of +89, 16 away games won, and 32 wins overall.[103] They also competed in the UEFA Champions League for the 15th successive season,[104] losing in the semi-finals to Bayern Munich in a penalty shoot-out after a 3–3 aggregate tie. Madrid entered the Copa del Rey as the defending champions, but lost 3–4 on aggregate in the quarter-finals to Barcelona. In the same season, Cristiano Ronaldo became the fastest player to reach 100 goals scored in Spanish league history. In reaching 101 goals in 92 games, Ronaldo surpassed Real Madrid legend Ferenc Puskás, who scored 100 goals in 105 matches. Ronaldo set a new club mark for individual goals scored in one year (60) and became the first player ever to score against all 19 opposition teams in a single season.[105][106] Real Madrid started the 2012–13 season by winning the Supercopa de España, defeating Barcelona on away goals. However, the super cup turned out to be their only trophy of the season, despite being close to win them all. Real finished runners-up to Barça in La Liga, accumulating 85 points, and reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League for the third year in a row, where they were eliminated by Borussia Dortmund 3–4 on aggregate. Madrid also entered the Copa del Rey in the round of 32, going on a memorable run to the final, which saw them defeat Barcelona in the semi-finals before losing to Atlético Madrid 1–2 a.e.t. Real Madrid faced the Blaugrana six times throughout the season, coming away with three wins, two draws, and one loss. A major transfer of the season was the signing of Luka Modrić from Tottenham Hotspur for a fee in the region of £33 million.[107] After a loss to Atlético in the Copa del Rey final, Pérez announced the departure of José Mourinho at the end of the season by \"mutual agreement\".[108] On 25 June 2013, Carlo Ancelotti succeeded Mourinho to become the manager of Real Madrid on a three-year deal, with Zinedine Zidane named as one of his assistants.[109] On 1 September 2013, the long-awaited transfer of Gareth Bale from Tottenham Hotspur was announced. The transfer of the Welshman was reportedly a new world record signing, with the transfer price approximated at €100 million.[110] In Ancelotti's first season at the club, Real Madrid fought on all three fronts for the continental treble. Despite leading in the league campaign on multiple occasions, Madrid ultimately finished in third place (level on points with Barcelona and three behind cross-city rivals Atlético Madrid), collecting 87 points in total and scoring a record 104 goals.[111] By that time, Los Blancos had already secured the Copa del Rey – against rivals Barcelona – in April, with Bale scoring the winner.[112] The major breakthrough came in the UEFA Champions League, where Real returned to the final after twelve years, having beaten defending champions Bayern Munich 5–0 on aggregate in the semi-finals.[113] In the final, they defeated then-recently-league winners Atlético Madrid 4–1 a.e.t. to clinch their tenth European Cup (first since 2002) and become the first team to win ten European Cups/Champions League titles, an achievement known as \"La Décima\" (Spanish: \"The Tenth,\" [la ˈðeθima]).[114] Real's attacking trio of Bale, Benzema and Cristiano, dubbed the BBC, finished the season with 97 goals.[115] After winning the 2014 Champions League, Real Madrid signed goalkeeper Keylor Navas, midfielder Toni Kroos and attacking midfielder James Rodríguez.[116] In August, Madrid won the 2014 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla, the club's 79th official trophy.[117] During the last week of the 2014 summer transfer window, Real Madrid sold two players key to the previous season's successes: Xabi Alonso to Bayern Munich and Ángel Di María to Manchester United. This decision by the club was surrounded by controversy, with Cristiano Ronaldo stating, \"If I was in charge, maybe I would have done things differently,\" while Carlo Ancelotti admitted, \"We must start again from zero.\"[118] After a slow start to the 2014–15 season, Real Madrid went on a record-breaking 22-match winning streak, which included wins against Barcelona and Liverpool, surpassing the previous Spanish record of 18 successive wins set by Frank Rijkaard's Barça in the 2005–06 season.[119] In late December, Real Madrid won their first Club World Cup, defeating San Lorenzo 2–0 in the final.[120] The winning streak came to an end in their opening match of 2015 with a loss to Valencia, leaving the club two short of equalling the world record of 24 consecutive wins.[121] Madrid was in contention for both the La Liga title and the UEFA Champions League until the very end but ultimately came up short, finishing with 92 points in the league, two behind treble-winning Barcelona and losing to Juventus 2–3 on aggregate in the Champions League semi-finals.[122] Ronaldo finished the season scoring 48 league goals, winning his fourth European Golden Shoe, and 61 goals in all competitions, breaking his record from 2011 to 2012.[123] Overall, despite playing an attractive attacking football and being the highest scoring team in Europe with 118 league goals,[124] several narrow defeats meant that Real finished the season with two trophies out of six possible, which contributed to the dismissal of Carlo Ancelotti on 25 May 2015.[125][126] On 3 June 2015, Rafael Benítez was confirmed as the new Real Madrid manager for the 2015–16 season, signing a three-year contract.[127] Real Madrid remained unbeaten in the league until a 3–2 loss at Sevilla on the matchday 11. This was followed by a 0–4 home loss in the first Clásico of the season against Barcelona. Perhaps, his reign is best remembered by multiple lopsided wins achieved both in La Liga and the Champions League (6–0 vs Espanyol, 8–0 vs Malmö, 10–2 vs Rayo Vallecano and others). In the Copa del Rey round of 32, Real accidentally fielded an ineligible player in a 3–1 first leg win at Cádiz and was disqualified from the tournament two days later by the competition judge, despite protests from president Pérez.[128][129][130] In the meantime, Madrid comfortably topped their UCL group with 16 points and a +16 goal difference. Benítez was relieved of his duties on 4 January 2016 following allegations of unpopularity with supporters, displeasure with players and a failure to get good results against top teams.[131] Benítez's departure was announced along with the promotion of Zinedine Zidane to his first head coaching role.[132] Under Zidane, Madrid managed to turn the odds in its favour, ultimately winning the Champions League, something no one expected. The notable results include a 2–1 away victory over reigning treble winners Barcelona, who were on a record-breaking winning streak, a fantastic comeback against Wolfsburg in the Champions League quarter-finals (after losing the away game 0–2, Madrid erased the deficit and won 3–0 at home, courtesy of a Cristiano Ronaldo hat-trick), as well as a 12-game winning streak to conclude the league campaign, meaning Real finished second, with 90 points and just one point behind champions Barcelona, coming agonizingly close to clinching the title and overcoming a 12-point deficit in the process.[133] Finally, on 28 May, Real Madrid's eleventh Champions League title was won thanks to a 5–3 penalty shoot-out victory over rivals Atlético Madrid after a 1–1 draw in the final, with the achievement being termed \"La Undécima\".[134][135][126] Real Madrid began their 2016–17 campaign, which was to be Zidane's first full season in charge of the club, with a victory in the 2016 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla.[136] On 10 December 2016, Madrid played their 35th-straight match without a loss, which set a new club record.[137] On 18 December 2016, the club defeated Japanese outfit Kashima Antlers 4–2 in the final of the 2016 FIFA Club World Cup.[138] With a 3–3 draw at Sevilla in the second leg of the Copa del Rey round of 16 on 12 January 2017, Madrid progressed to the quarter-finals with a 6–3 aggregate victory and extended its unbeaten run to 40 matches, breaking Barcelona's Spanish record of 39 matches unbeaten in all competitions from the previous season.[139] Their unbeaten streak ended after a 1–2 away loss against the same opposition in La Liga three days later.[140] The team then was knocked out of the Copa del Rey by Celta Vigo 3–4 on aggregate. These slips, however, did not affect the overall trajectory of the season. In May, Madrid won the league title for a record 33rd time, their first title in five years, accumulating 93 points in the process.[141] On 3 June 2017, the club's victory over Juventus in the Champions League final resulted in Real Madrid becoming the first team to successfully defend their title in the UEFA Champions League era, and the first to win consecutive titles in the competition since Milan in 1989 and 1990, when the tournament was known as the European Cup.[142][143] Real Madrid's title was its 12th, extending the record, and its third in four years. The achievement is also known as \"La Duodécima\".[144] The 2016–17 season was the greatest campaign in terms of trophies won (four out of possible five) in the history of Real Madrid, an achievement that would be later equalled in the 2017–18 season.[145] Real kicked off the 2017–18 campaign by winning its second consecutive and fourth overall UEFA Super Cup in a 2–1 victory against Manchester United.[146] Five days later, Real Madrid beat Barcelona at the Camp Nou 3–1 in the first leg of the 2017 Supercopa de España and then defeated Barça 2–0 in the return leg, ending their 24 consecutive match scoring record in El Clásico matches and winning the second trophy of the season.[147] On 16 December 2017, Real beat Brazilian club Grêmio 1–0 in the FIFA Club World Cup final and became the first team to retain the trophy.[148] In the 2017–18 UEFA Champions League, Madrid once again progressed to the final where they defeated Liverpool 3–1 to become the first club to win three straight titles in the Champions League era, as well as the first team to win three consecutive titles in the European Cup/Champions League since Bayern Munich in 1976. The trophy also marked Madrid's fourth win in five years and their eighth consecutive semi-finals appearance. On 31 May, only five days after winning the final, Zidane announced his resignation as Real Madrid manager, citing the club's \"need for change\" as his rationale for departing.[149][150] Zidane's and Ronaldo's departures marked the end of the Second Galáctico Era that yielded four Champions League titles, two La Liga titles, two Copa del Rey, two Supercopa de España, three UEFA Super Cups, and three FIFA Club World Cup titles. The team was instrumental in ending Barcelona's dominance, despite the Blaugrana boasting arguably the greatest collection of talent in history,[151] and overshadowed the Catalans on the European stage.[152] Real Madrid was also somewhat notoriously unlucky in its league campaigns throughout these nine years, finishing runners-up with 96, 92 (twice) and 90 points, as well as on 87 points in third place, just three off the league winners.[97] On 12 June 2018, Real Madrid named Julen Lopetegui, the head coach of the Spanish national team, as their new manager. It was announced that he would officially begin his managerial duties after the 2018 FIFA World Cup. However, the Spanish national team sacked Lopetegui a day prior to the tournament, stating that he had negotiated terms with the club without informing them.[153][154] The club then began re-shaping the squad in the summer of 2018, which included the sale of Cristiano Ronaldo to Juventus for a reported €117 million.[155] Madrid began their 2018–19 campaign by losing to Atlético Madrid 2–4 a.e.t. in the 2018 UEFA Super Cup. After a 1–5 loss to Barcelona in El Clásico on 28 October which left Real Madrid in the ninth place with only 14 points after ten games, Lopetegui was dismissed a day later and replaced by then Castilla coach, Santiago Solari.[156] On 22 December 2018, Real Madrid beat Al Ain 4–1 in the FIFA Club World Cup and became the outright record winners of the Club World Cup with four titles.[157] However, they were then knocked out of the Copa del Rey at the semi-final stage by Barcelona, losing 1–4 on aggregate. On 5 March 2019, Real was defeated by Ajax 1–4 (3–5 on aggregate) at home, crashing out of the Champions League at the round of 16 stage after eight consecutive semi-finals appearances. On 11 March 2019, Real Madrid dismissed Solari and reinstated Zidane as the head coach of the club.[158] Madrid finished the season with 68 points and a +17 goal difference, its lowest totals since 2001–02 and 1999–2000 respectively.[159] In the summer of 2019, Madrid signed Eden Hazard, Luka Jović, Éder Militão, Ferland Mendy, Rodrygo, Reinier and other players for a total of more than €350 million.[160] On 12 January 2020, Madrid beat cross-city rivals Atlético Madrid in a penalty shootout in the Supercopa de España final to win their eleventh title.[161] After a three-month hiatus due to the COVID-19 outbreak in March 2020, La Liga was restarted in June and Madrid won ten games in a row to capture the team's 34th league title, collecting 87 points in total.[162] From the competition's resumption in June and until the end of the 2020–21 season, Real temporarily played home fixtures at the Alfredo Di Stéfano Stadium, while the Santiago Bernabéu underwent extensive renovations.[163][164] Zidane left a second time on 27 May 2021 after going trophyless that season,[165] with Carlo Ancelotti returning to coach the team for the 2021–22 season.[166] On the domestic front, he delivered two trophies out of possible three, winning La Liga and the Supercopa de España.[167][168][169] As such, Ancelotti won all six available top trophies at Madrid.[170] In the Champions League, Madrid produced one of the most memorable runs of all time,[171] defeating pre-tournament favourites Paris Saint-Germain,[172][173] defending champions and favourites Chelsea,[174] Premier League champions and heavy favourites Manchester City,[175] all in dramatic fashion,[176] and setting up the final against Liverpool, who were once again widely considered as favourites,[177] in a rematch of their 2018 encounter. A lone Vinícius Júnior goal sealed the 14th European Cup for Los Blancos, their fifth in nine years, and Ancelotti's second in charge.[178][179] Real also claimed their fourth ever European double (after 1956–57, 1957–58, and 2016–17). Despite Real's status as the most decorated team in the history of the Champions League, they were not favoured to win that year's edition, and their improbable run was widely considered a surprise.[180] After a highly successful 2021–22 season, Real Madrid signed German defender Antonio Rüdiger and French midfielder Aurélien Tchouaméni, while club legends Marcelo, Isco, Gareth Bale and Casemiro left the club. Real Madrid's 2022–23 season began with lifting the UEFA Super Cup and later the FIFA Club World Cup. The season ended with Real Madrid winning the 2022–23 Copa del Rey, but losing the La Liga and Spanish Super Cup to FC Barcelona and the Champions League to Manchester City, being defeated 5–1 on aggregate. In 2023, Real Madrid signed Jude Bellingham, who was given the number #5 jersey, previously used by Zinedine Zidane. Real also signed Arda Güler and Fran García. Meanwhile, Vinícius Júnior was given the number #7 jersey, previously used by Raúl and Cristiano Ronaldo; while Rodrygo was given the number #11 jersey, previously used by Gareth Bale. Karim Benzema left the club, while Toni Kroos would later announce that he would retire from football after this season. The 2023-24 season would prove to be another highly successful season for Los Blancos. First, Real Madrid lifted the Spanish Super Cup against Barcelona 4–1, taking revenge of the previous year's 3–0 defeat. Then, Real Madrid lifted the La Liga with relative ease, reaching 95 points, the second-best winning campaign by Real Madrid in La Liga history after the 2011–12 100 points season. In the 2023–24 UEFA Champions League, Real Madrid knocked out RB Leipzig in the Round of 16, then defending champions Manchester City in penalties. In the semifinals, Real Madrid faced Bayern Munich again. The first match was a 2–2 draw, while the second match in the Bernabéu was marked by a double by Joselu in the last few minutes of the game, with Bayern Munich suffering a historic comeback after leading 1–0. Real Madrid faced Borussia Dortmund in the final, and won 2–0, with Dani Carvajal being the man of the match and scoring with a header after a Toni Kroos corner, and Vinícius Júnior once again scoring in a UCL final. Real Madrid won their 15th Champions League without losing a single match during the campaign. Following the conclusion of the 2023–24 season, Real Madrid announced that striker Kylian Mbappé would be joining the club on a free transfer from Paris Saint-Germain in July 2024, concluding one of the most highly anticipated transfer sagas in modern history.[181] The first crest had a simple design consisting of a decorative interlacing of the three initials of the club, \"MCF\" for Madrid Club de Fútbol, in dark blue on a white shirt. The first change in the crest occurred in 1908 when the letters adopted a more streamlined form and appeared inside a circle.[182] The next change in the configuration of the crest did not occur until the presidency of Pedro Parages in 1920. At that time, King Alfonso XIII granted the club his royal patronage which came in the form of the title \"Real Madrid,\" meaning \"Royal.\"[183] Thus, Alfonso's crown was added to the crest and the club styled itself Real Madrid Club de Fútbol.[182] With the dissolution of the monarchy in 1931, all royal symbols (the crown on the crest and the title of Real) were eliminated. The crown was replaced by the dark mulberry band of the Region of Castile.[48] In 1941, two years after Nationalist victory in the Civil War, the Francoist regime restored the crest's \"Real Corona\", or \"Royal Crown\", while the mulberry stripe of Castile was retained as well.[184][56] In addition, the whole crest was made full color, with gold being the most prominent, and the club went back to its honorific name Real Madrid Club de Fútbol.[182] The most recent modification to the crest occurred in 2001 when the club wanted to better situate itself for the 21st century and further standardize its crest. One of the modifications made was changing the mulberry stripe to a more bluish shade.[182] Real Madrid has maintained the white shirt for its home kit throughout the history of the club. There was, however, one season that the shirt and shorts were not both white. It was an initiative undertaken by Juan Padrós in honour of an English team Corinthian, which he had met on one of his trips, one of the most famous teams at the time known for its elegance and sportsmanship.[43] It was decided that Real Madrid would wear black shorts in an attempt to replicate the English team, which had also inspired Madrid's original white kit, but the initiative lasted just one year. After being eliminated from the cup by Barcelona with a 1–5 defeat in Madrid and a 2–0 defeat in Catalonia, President Parages decided to return to an all-white kit, claiming that the other kit brought bad luck.[note 3] By the early 1940s, the manager changed the kit again by adding buttons to the shirt and the club's crest on the left breast, which has remained ever since. On 23 November 1947, in a game against Atlético Madrid at the Metropolitano Stadium, Real Madrid became the first Spanish team to wear numbered shirts.[56] English club Leeds United permanently switched their blue shirt for a white one in the 1960s, to emulate the dominant Real Madrid of the era.[185] Real's traditional away colours are all blue or all purple. Since the advent of the replica kit market, the club has also released various other one colour designs, including red, green, orange and black. The club's kit is manufactured by Adidas, whose contract extends from 1998.[186][187] Real Madrid's first shirt sponsor, Zanussi, agreed for the 1982–83, 1983–84 and 1984–85 seasons. Following that, the club was sponsored by Parmalat and Otaysa before a long-term deal was signed with Teka in 1992.[188][189] In 2001, Real Madrid ended their contract with Teka and for one season and used the Realmadrid.com logo to promote the club's website. Then, in 2002, a deal was signed with Siemens and in 2006, the BenQ Siemens logo appeared on the club's shirt.[190] Real Madrid's shirt sponsor from 2007 until 2013 was bwin.com following the economic problems of BenQ Siemens.[191][192] Fly Emirates became their shirt sponsor in 2013, and in 2017 the club renewed the sponsorship with the airliner, signing a deal until 2022 worth €70 million per year.[193] In 2022, the agreement was again extended, until 2026.[194] In 2015, Madrid signed a new ten-year contract with Adidas, believed to be worth a total of £850 million (€1 billion), with the club earning £59 million (€64 million) per season. The contract includes a clause sanctioning penalty or agreement termination anytime, if Real Madrid fails to qualify for the European competitions or is relegated from La Liga.[195] Note: early termination clauses can be activated at any time depending on the team's performance. After moving between several grounds, the team relocated to the Campo de O'Donnell in 1912, which remained its home stadium for 11 years.[45] After this period, the club moved for one year to the Campo de Ciudad Lineal, a small ground with a capacity of 8,000 spectators. After that, Real Madrid started playing its home matches at the Estadio Chamartín, which was inaugurated on 17 May 1923 with a match against Newcastle United.[201] In this stadium, which hosted 22,500 spectators, Real Madrid celebrated its first Spanish league title.[47] Following his election in 1943, president Santiago Bernabéu decided that the Chamartín was not big enough for the ambitions of the club, and thus a new stadium was built and inaugurated on 14 December 1947.[56][202] Initially knows as Nuevo Chamartín, the stadium was renamed in honour of Bernabéu in 1955 and continues to bear his name to this day.[57] The first match at the Bernabéu was played between Madrid and the Portuguese club Belenenses, with Los Blancos winning 3–1 and Sabino Barinaga scoring the first goal.[56] The capacity has changed frequently, peaking at 120,000 after a 1953 expansion.[203] Since then, there have been a number of reductions due to modernizations (the last standing areas were removed in 1998–99 in response to UEFA regulations which had forbidden standing at matches in European competitions), countered to some extent by expansions.[203] The current capacity is 81,044 spectators. Real Madrid has the fourth-highest average attendance in Europe, behind Borussia Dortmund, Barcelona and Manchester United.[204][205][206][207] The Bernabéu has hosted the 1964 UEFA European Championship final, the 1982 FIFA World Cup final, and the 1957, 1969, 1980 and 2010 European Cup/Champions League finals.[208] The stadium has its own namesake Madrid Metro station along the 10 line.[209] On 14 November 2007, the Bernabéu was upgraded to Elite Football Stadium status by UEFA.[210] On 9 May 2006, the Alfredo Di Stéfano Stadium, named after club legend Alfredo Di Stéfano, was inaugurated in the Real Madrid City, where Real Madrid usually trains. The inaugural match was played between Real Madrid and Reims, a rematch of the 1956 European Cup final. Real Madrid 6–1, with goals from Sergio Ramos, Antonio Cassano (2), Roberto Soldado (2) and José Manuel Jurado. The venue is now part of the Ciudad Real Madrid, the club's training facility located outside Madrid, in Valdebebas. The stadium's capacity is 5,000 people, and it is Real Madrid Castilla's home ground.[211] For the latter part of the 2019–20 season and throughout the 2020–21 season, the stadium hosted the first team's home games due to a combination of the COVID-19 pandemic-triggered restrictions and an extensive renovation of the Santiago Bernabéu.[212][164] The latest renovation of the Santiago Bernabéu is set to increase the capacity by approximately 4,000 with the addition of an extra tier, bringing it to nearly 85,000.[213][214] Furthermore, the height will also be increased by ten metres and a retractable roof, a retractable pitch and a 360-degree screen will be installed.[215][216] The works have started in 2019, and the renovated stadium was initially planned to be unveiled in 2022; however, the COVID-19 pandemic and Russian invasion of Ukraine caused significant disruption to supply chains, prompting the club to postpone the stadium's inauguration to 2023.[217][218] Raúl holds the record for most appearances with Real Madrid, with 741 appearances from 1994 to 2010. Iker Casillas comes second with 725 appearances, followed by Manuel Sanchis Jr., having played 710 times.[219] The record for a goalkeeper is held by Iker Casillas, with 725 appearances. With 63 goals, Cristiano Ronaldo has scored the most international goals while playing for the club. Meanwhile, Sergio Ramos has accumulated the most caps while playing for the club, with 176. Cristiano Ronaldo (2009–2018) is Real Madrid's all-time top goalscorer, with 450 goals in 438 matches.[220][221] Six other players have also scored over 200 goals for Real: Alfredo Di Stéfano (1953–1964), Santillana (1971–1988), Ferenc Puskás (1958–1966), Hugo Sánchez (1985–1992), Karim Benzema (2009–2023) and the previous goalscoring record-holder Raúl (1994–2010). Cristiano Ronaldo also holds the record for the most league goals scored in one season (48 in 2014–15), alongside being Real's top goalscorer of all time in La Liga history with 311 goals. Di Stéfano's 49 goals in 58 matches was for decades the all-time highest tally in the European Cup, until it was surpassed by Raúl in 2005, and is now held by Cristiano Ronaldo with 105 goals for Madrid and 140 overall. The fastest goal in the history of the club (13 seconds) was scored by the Chilean Iván Zamorano on 3 September 1994 during a league match against Sevilla.[222] Officially, the highest home attendance figure for a Real Madrid match is 129,690, which was for a European Cup match in 1956 against Milan. The current official capacity of the Santiago Bernabéu is 80,000.[223] Real has also set records in Spanish football, most notably the most domestic titles (36 as of 2023–24) and the most seasons won in a row (five, during 1960–65 and 1985–90).[1] With 121 matches (from 17 February 1957 to 7 March 1965), the club holds the record for longest unbeaten run at home in La Liga.[224] The club also holds the record for winning the European Cup/UEFA Champions League fifteen times[225] and for the most semi-finals appearances (33). As of June 2024, Cristiano Ronaldo is the all-time top scorer in the UEFA Champions League, with 140 (141 including qualifiers) goals in total, 105 while playing for Real Madrid. The team has the record number of consecutive participations in the European Cup (before it became the Champions League) with 15, from 1955–56 to 1969–70.[226] Among the club's on-field records is a 22-game winning streak in all competitions during the 2014–15 season, a Spanish record. In September 2017, the club equalled the record of the Brazilian club Santos, starring Pelé, by scoring in their 73rd consecutive game, before Bayern Munich breaks the record in 2021.[227] In June 2009, the club broke its own record for the highest transfer fee ever paid in the history of football after purchasing Manchester United star Cristiano Ronaldo for €94 million (£80 million).[228][229] The fee of €77.5 million (100 billion lire) for Zinedine Zidane's transfer from Juventus to Real Madrid in 2001 was the previous highest transfer fee ever paid. This record (in pounds sterling) had been broken previously in June 2009, for a few days, when Real Madrid agreed to buy Kaká from Milan for €67 million (£65 million). The transfer of Tottenham Hotspur's Gareth Bale in 2013 was reportedly a new world record signing, with the transfer fee approximated at around €100 million.[110] In January 2016, documents pertaining to Bale's transfer were leaked which confirmed a world record transfer fee of €100,759,418.[230] Real Madrid equalled their record signing in 2019, when the club signed Eden Hazard from Chelsea for a reported €115 million.[231] The club's record sale occurred on 10 July 2018, when Juventus signed Cristiano Ronaldo for €117 million.[232] During most home matches, the majority of the seats in the stadium are occupied by season-ticket holders, of which the figure is capped at 65,000.[233] To become a season ticket holder one must first be a socio, or club member. In addition to members, the club has more than 1,800 peñas (official, club-affiliated supporters' groups) in Spain and around the world. Real Madrid has the second highest average all-time attendance in Spanish football and regularly attracts over 74,000 fans to the Bernabéu. One of the best supported teams globally, Real Madrid was the first sports team (and first brand) to reach 100 million fans on Facebook in April 2017.[234][235] Real Madrid's hardcore supporters are the so-called Ultras Sur supporters, or simply Ultras. They are known for their extreme right-wing politics, akin to Barcelona's hardcore supporters group Boixos Nois. The Ultras Surs have developed an alliance with other right wing groups, most notably Lazio Irriducibili fans, and have also developed an alliance with left-wing groups. On several occasions, they have racially abused opposing players, and have been investigated by UEFA for doing so.[236][237] Florentino Pérez took it upon himself to ban the Ultras from the Bernabéu and assign their seats to the general public. This decision was controversial with some of the Bernabéu faithful, however, as the lively atmosphere of games would suffer as a result.[238][239] The Ultras have since held protests outside the Bernabéu and have demanded to be reinstated and allowed to enter the grounds.[240] Questioned over Pope Francis' adherence to 2014 FIFA Club World Cup Final opponents San Lorenzo, Madrid captain Sergio Ramos stated: \"In the semi-finals we noticed the love from supporters in Marrakesh and it seemed like we were playing at home. That sums up the greatness of this team. Madrid is God's team and the team of the world\".[241] Among the club's famous supporters is golfer Sergio García, who was invited to take the honorary kickoff for El Clásico at the Bernabeu wearing his green jacket from winning the 2017 Masters.[242] There is often a fierce rivalry between the two strongest teams in a national league, and this is particularly the case in La Liga, where the game between Real Madrid and Barcelona is known as \"The Classic\" (El Clásico). From the start of national competitions the clubs were seen as representatives of two rival regions in Spain: Castile and Catalonia, as well as of the two cities. The rivalry reflects what many regard as the political and cultural tensions felt between the Castilians and Catalans, seen by one author as a re-enactment of the Spanish Civil War.[243] Over the years, the record for Real Madrid and Barcelona is 100 victories for Madrid, 97 victories for Barcelona, and 52 draws.[244] As early as the 1930s, Barcelona \"had developed a reputation as a symbol of Catalan identity, opposed to the centralising tendencies of Madrid\".[246][247] During the dictatorships of Miguel Primo de Rivera and especially Francisco Franco, all regional languages and identities in Spain were frowned upon and restrained. As such, most citizens of Barcelona were in strong opposition to Franco's regime. In that period, Barcelona gained their motto Més que un club (English: More than a club) because of its alleged connection to Catalan nationalist as well as to progressive beliefs.[248] There is an ongoing controversy as to what extent Franco's rule (1939–75) influenced the activities and on-pitch results of both Barcelona and Real Madrid. Fans of both clubs tend to exaggerate the myths favouring their narratives. Most historians agree that Franco did not have a preferred football team, but his Spanish nationalist beliefs led him to associate himself with the establishment teams, such as Atlético Aviación and Madrid FC (that recovered its \"royal\" name after the fall of the Republic and again became Real Madrid). On the other hand, he also wanted the renamed Barcelona succeed as \"Spanish team\", rather than a Catalan one. During the early years of Franco's rule, Real Madrid were not particularly successful, winning two Copa del Generalísimo titles and a Copa Eva Duarte; Barcelona claimed three league titles, one Copa del Generalísimo and one Copa Eva Duarte. During that period, Atlético Aviación were believed to be the preferred team over Real Madrid. The most contested stories of the period include Real Madrid's 11–1 home win against Barcelona in the Copa del Generalísimo, where the Catalan team alleged intimidation, and the controversial transfer of Alfredo Di Stéfano to Real Madrid, despite his agreement with Barcelona. The latter transfer was part of Real Madrid chairman Santiago Bernabéu's \"revolution\" that ushered in the era of unprecedented dominance. Bernabéu, himself a veteran of the Civil War who fought for Franco's forces, saw Real Madrid on top, not only of Spanish, but also European football, helping create the European Cup, the first true competition for Europe's best club sides. His vision was fulfilled when Real Madrid not only started winning consecutive league titles, but also swept the first five editions of the European Cup in the 1950s.[249] These events had a profound impact on Spanish football and influenced Franco's attitude. According to historians, during this time he realized the importance of Real Madrid for his regime's international image, and the club became his preferred team until his death. Fernando Maria Castiella, who served as Minister of Foreign Affairs under Franco from 1957 until 1969, noted that \"[Real Madrid] is the best embassy we have ever had\". Franco died in 1975, and the Spanish transition to democracy soon followed. Under his rule, Real Madrid had won 14 league titles, six Copa del Generalísimo titles, one Copa Eva Duarte, six European Cups, two Latin Cups and one Intercontinental Cup. In the same period, Barcelona had won eight league titles, nine Copa del Generalísimo titles, three Copa Eva Duarte titles, three Inter-Cities Fairs Cups and two Latin Cups.[250][184] The rivalry was intensified during the 1950s when the clubs disputed the signing of Alfredo Di Stéfano. Di Stéfano had impressed both Barcelona and Real Madrid while playing for Los Millonarios in Bogotá, Colombia, during a players' strike in his native Argentina. Soon after Millonarios' return to Colombia, Barcelona directors visited Buenos Aires and agreed with River Plate, the last FIFA-affiliated team to have held Di Stéfano's rights, for his transfer in 1954 for the equivalent of 150 million Italian lira (according to other sources 200,000 dollars). This started a battle between the two Spanish rivals for his rights. FIFA appointed Armando Muñoz Calero, former president of the Spanish Football Federation as mediator. Calero decided to let Di Stéfano play the 1953–54 and 1955–56 seasons in Madrid, and the 1954–55 and 1956–57 seasons in Barcelona. The agreement was approved by the Football Association and their respective clubs. Although the Catalans agreed, the decision created various discontent among the Blaugrana members and the president was forced to resign in September 1953. Barcelona sold Madrid their half-share, and Di Stéfano moved to Los Blancos, signing a four-year contract. Real paid 5.5 million Spanish pesetas for the transfer, plus a 1.3 million bonus for the purchase, an annual fee to be paid to the Millonarios, and a 16,000 salary for Di Stéfano with a bonus double that of his teammates, for a total of 40% of the annual revenue of the Madrid club.[251] Di Stéfano became integral in the subsequent success achieved by Real Madrid, scoring twice in his first game against Barcelona. With him, Madrid won the first five editions of the European Cup.[252] The 1960s saw the rivalry reach the European stage when Real Madrid and Barcelona met twice in the European Cup, with Madrid triumphing en route to their fifth consecutive title in 1959–60 and Barcelona prevailing en route to losing the final in 1960–61. Ahead of the 1973–74 season, Johan Cruyff arrived to Barcelona for a world record £920,000 from Ajax.[253] Already an established player with Ajax, Cruyff quickly won over the Barcelona fans when he told the European press that he chose Barcelona over Real Madrid because he could not play for a club associated with Francisco Franco. He further endeared himself when he named his son \"Jordi\", after the local Catalan Saint George.[254] In 2002, the European encounter between the clubs was dubbed the \"Match of The Century\" by Spanish media, and Madrid's win was watched by more than 500 million people around the world.[255] A fixture known for its intensity and indiscipline, it has also featured memorable goal celebrations from both teams, often involving mocking the opposition.[256] In October 1999, Real Madrid forward Raúl silenced 100,000 Barcelona fans at the Camp Nou when he scored before he celebrated by putting a finger to his lips as if telling the crowd to be quiet.[256][257] In 2009, Barcelona captain Carles Puyol kissed his Catalan armband in front of Madrid fans at the Bernabéu.[256] Cristiano Ronaldo twice gestured to the hostile crowd to \"calm down\" after scoring against Barcelona at the Camp Nou in 2012 and 2016.[256] In April 2017, Messi celebrated his 93rd-minute winner for Barcelona against Real Madrid at the Bernabéu by taking off his Barcelona shirt and holding it up to incensed Real Madrid fans – with his name and number facing them.[256] Later that year, in August, Ronaldo was subbed on in the first leg of the Supercopa de España, proceeded to score in the 80th minute and took his shirt off before holding it up to Barça's fans with his name and number facing them.[258] The club's nearest neighbour is Atlético Madrid, a rivalry being shared between fans of both football teams. Although Atlético was founded by three Basque students in 1903, it was joined in 1904 by dissident members of \"Madrid FC\". The two teams met for the first time on 2 December 1906 in the regional championship, with Real Madrid winning 2–1. Their first league meeting came on 21 February 1929 in matchday three of the first league championship at the former Chamartín. It was the first official derby of the new tournament, and Real won 2–1.[47] After the Civil War, during the early Francoist period, Atlético became associated with the military air force (and thus renamed Atlético Aviación), although the alleged preference of the regime for the club is subject to discussion. In any case, during this period Atlético became the most successful club in Spain, reducing the historical gap between the two clubs, until the regime preference shifted towards Real Madrid in the 1950s, as Franco sought to make political capital out of Real Madrid's multiple European Cup titles at a time when Spain was internationally isolated; one minister said, \"Real Madrid are the best ambassadors we've ever had.\"[184] Thus, Atlético fans regularly chanted that Real were \"El equipo del gobierno, la vergüenza del país\" – \"The team of the government, the shame of the country\" – and allegedly adopted a more left-wing slant (tempered by the rise of ultras culture and Rayo Vallecano's presence as the \"true\" leftist club in Madrid).[259][260] The rivalry first gained international attention in 1959 during the European Cup when the two clubs met in the semi-finals. Real won the first leg 2–1 at the Santiago Bernabéu, while Atlético won 1–0 at the Metropolitano. The tie went to a replay, which Real won 2–1. Atlético, however, gained some revenge when, led by former Real Madrid coach José Villalonga, it defeated its city rivals in two successive Copa del Generalísimo finals in 1960 and 1961.[261] In the 1970s, Atlético again took the lead as the most successful Spanish club of the decade, which prompted the Real Madrid fanbase to look down on Atlético calling them and their supporters \"Indios\" (Indians, a reference to the Latin American players signed by the Red-and-whites).[262] By then, Real Madrid did not want to sign non-Caucasian players (president Santiago Bernabéu even stated, when he decided not to sign Portuguese star Eusebio at the end of the 1960s, \"Mientras yo viva, aquí no jugará ningún negro ni un blanco con bigote\" (\"As long as I live, no black or white with a mustache will play here\").[263] Atlético's supporters accepted the new \"Indian\" nickname joyfully and have been using it until today. The Santiago Bernabéu, Real Madrid's stadium, is alongside banks and businesses on the upper class Paseo de la Castellana street, while the Vicente Calderón (the stadium that Atlético Madrid used until the 2016–17 season) could be found near a brewery, alongside the Manzanares River and a motorway. Real draw greater support all across the region because of their historically greater resources and success, while Atlético have a relatively working class fan base mainly from the south of the city, with some fans also scattered throughout the city.[264][265] In fact, the Atlético crest includes the Coat of arms of Madrid, whereas Real crest has no such a reference to the city (instead, it includes a reference to the broader Castile region). Between 1961 and 1989, when Real dominated La Liga, only Atlético offered it any serious challenge, winning league titles in 1966, 1970, 1973 and 1977. In 1965, Atlético became the first team to beat Real at the Bernabéu in eight years. Real Madrid's record against Atlético in more recent times is very favourable.[266] A high point came in the 2002–03 season, when Real clinched the La Liga title after a 4–0 victory at the Vicente Calderón. Atlético's first win over its city rivals since 1999 came in the Copa del Rey final in May 2013. In 2013–14, Real and Atlético were finalists of the UEFA Champions League, the first final which hosted two clubs from the same city. Real Madrid triumphed with a 4–1 comeback victory in extra time.[267] On 7 February 2015, Real suffered their first defeat in 14 years at the Vicente Calderón, a 4–0 loss.[268] On 28 May 2016, Real and Atlético again met for the Champions League title, which resulted in a win for Real after a penalty shootout at San Siro.[269] A further minor rivalry exists between Real Madrid and Athletic Bilbao. This is known as El Viejo Clásico (the old classic),[270] so named as the two clubs were dominant in the first half of the 20th century, meeting in nine Copa del Rey finals including the first in 1903.[271][272] Until 10 December 2011, this fixture was the most played in the history of Spanish football, when it was surpassed by El Clásico.[273] Athletic Bilbao, who operate a policy of only using local players,[274] have long since ceased to be a competitive rival to clubs such as Real Madrid who scour the globe for the best talent; the Lions won only two of the 26 matches between the teams from 2005–06 to 2016–17.[270][275][276] However, the matches remain keenly fought due to their historical and cultural significance, with some parallels to the political aspect of the Barcelona/Catalonia rivalry as Athletic are the largest club in the Basque region.[277][260][278] Real Madrid and Bayern Munich are two of the most successful clubs in the UEFA Champions League/European Cup competition, with Real winning 15 times and Bayern winning six times.[279][280] Although they have never met in a final, Real Madrid versus Bayern is the match that has historically been played most often in the Champions League/European Cup with 26 matches (twelve wins for Madrid, eleven wins for Bayern, with three draws),[281] with several controversial incidents occurring due to the great importance of most of their meetings.[282][283][284] Real Madrid supporters often refer to Bayern as the \"Bestia negra\" (\"Black Beast\"). During the 2010s, the two teams met in the 2011–12 Champions League semi-finals, which ended 3–3 on aggregate (Bayern won 3–1 on penalties after extra time, but lost the final at their own stadium by the same method), then at the same stage in the 2013–14 edition with Real Madrid winning 5–0 on aggregate,[285] and again in 2017–18 with the Spanish club progressing 4–3;[286] both times they went on to win the competition. Another match that is often played in the European Cup/Champions League is Real Madrid vs Juventus, the most decorated Italian club. They have played each other in 21 matches and have an almost perfectly balanced record (nine wins for Juventus, ten wins for Real Madrid and two draws), as well as nearly the same goal difference (Madrid ahead 26 to 25).[287][288][289] Their first meeting was in the quarter-finals of the 1961–62 European Cup, which Real Madrid won 3–1 in a replay held in Paris.[288] At the quarter-final stage in 1995–96, Juventus prevailed 2–1 over the two legs and went on to lift the trophy.[288] In the 1998 UEFA Champions League Final between the teams in Amsterdam, Real Madrid won 1–0.[288][290] They met again in the 2002–03 UEFA Champions League semi-finals, when both clubs were in their respective 'golden eras'; Juventus won 4–3 on aggregate.[288] By that time, star midfielder Zinedine Zidane, who played for the Bianconeri in the 1998 final, had moved from Turin to Madrid in a world record €77 million deal.[291] The teams met again in the 2013–14 UEFA Champions League group stage, with Madrid winning 2–1 at home and drawing 2–2 away en route to their tenth title. In the 2014–15 UEFA Champions League semi-finals, former Real Madrid player Álvaro Morata scored one goal in each leg to take Juventus to the final, winning 3–2 on aggregate, while Cristiano Ronaldo scored both goals for Madrid.[288] They faced off again in the 2017 UEFA Champions League Final in Cardiff, with Ronaldo scoring twice as Real Madrid won 4–1.[288][292][293] The latest Champions League meeting was in the 2017–18 quarter-finals, which Real Madrid won 4–3 on aggregate; the tie ended in dramatic and controversial fashion, with a debatable penalty awarded to Real Madrid in the last minute of the second leg after Juventus built a 3–0 lead at the Bernabeu to pull level in the tie following a defeat at the Allianz Stadium by the same scoreline.[294][295] Cristiano Ronaldo scored three goals over the two matches including the decisive penalty and a spectacular overhead kick,[296] and having won the Champions League with Madrid for a fourth time,[297] he transferred to Juventus a few months later for a €117 million fee.[298] It was under Florentino Pérez's first presidency (2000–2006) that Real Madrid started its ambition of becoming the world's richest professional football club.[299] The club ceded part of its training grounds to the city of Madrid in 2001, and sold the rest to four corporations: Repsol YPF, Mutua Automovilística de Madrid, Sacyr Vallehermoso and OHL. The sale eradicated the club's debts, paving the way for it to buy the world's most expensive players, such as Zinedine Zidane, Luís Figo, Ronaldo and David Beckham. The city had previously rezoned the training grounds for development, a move which in turn increased their value, and then bought the site.[78] The European Commission started an investigation into whether the city overpaid for the property, to be considered a form of state subsidy.[300] The sale of the training ground for office buildings cleared Real Madrid's debts of €270 million and enabled the club to embark upon an unprecedented spending spree which brought big-name players to the club. In addition, profit from the sale was spent on a state-of-the-art training complex on the city's outskirts.[301] Although Pérez's policy resulted in increased financial success from the exploitation of the club's high marketing potential around the world, especially in Asia, it came under increasing criticism for being too focused on marketing the Real Madrid brand and not enough on the performances of the team.[81] By September 2007, Real Madrid was considered the most valuable football brand in Europe by BBDO. In 2008, it was ranked the second-most valuable club in world football, at €951 million (£640 million / $1.285 billion),[302] only beaten by Manchester United, which was valued at €1.333 billion (£900 million).[303] In 2010, Real Madrid had the highest turnover in football worldwide.[304] In September 2009, Real Madrid's management announced plans to open the club's own dedicated theme park by 2013.[305] A study at Harvard University concluded that Real Madrid \"is one of the 20 most important brand names and the only one in which its executives, the players, are well-known. We have some spectacular figures in regard to worldwide support of the club. There are an estimated 287 million people worldwide who follow Real Madrid.\"[306] In 2010, Forbes evaluated Real Madrid's worth to be around €992 million (US$1.323 billion), ranking them second only to Manchester United, based on figures from the 2008–09 season.[307][308] According to Deloitte, Real Madrid had a recorded revenue of €401 million in the same period, ranking first.[309] Along with Barcelona, Athletic Bilbao and Osasuna, Real Madrid is organised as a registered association. This means that the club is owned by its supporters, who elect the president. The president cannot invest his own money,[310] and the club can only spend what it earns, which is mainly derived through sponsorships, commercial partnerships, merchandise sales, television rights, prize money and ticket sales. Unlike a limited company, it is not possible to purchase shares in the club, but only a membership.[311] The members of Real Madrid, called \"socios\", form an assembly of delegates which is the highest governing body of the club.[312] As of 2010, the club had 60,000 socios.[313] At the end of the 2009–10 season, the club's board of directors stated that Real Madrid had a net debt of €244.6 million, €82.1 million lower than the previous fiscal year. Real Madrid announced that it had a net debt of €170 million after the 2010–11 season. From 2007 to 2011, the club made a net profit of €190 million.[314][315] During the 2009–10 season, Real Madrid made €150 million through ticket sales, the most of any club in top-flight football.[314] Real Madrid has the highest number of shirt sales per season, around 1.5 million.[314] For the 2010–11 season, Madrid's wage bill totalled €169 million, which was second-highest in Europe behind Barcelona;[316] furthermore, its wage bill to turnover ratio was the best in Europe at 43 percent, ahead of Manchester United and Arsenal at 46 percent and 50 percent, respectively. In 2013, Forbes listed the club as the world's most valuable sports team, worth $3.3 billion.[317] Real Madrid was valued at €3.47 billion ($4.1 billion) in 2018, and in the 2016–17 season it was the second highest-earning football club in the world, with an annual revenue of €674.6 million.[318] In November 2018, the average first-team pay at Madrid was £8.1m ($10.6m) per year, making it the second-highest paid sports team in the world after Barcelona.[319][320] In 2022, Forbes listed Real Madrid as the most valuable football club in the world, at $5.1 billion.[321] Real Madrid was the featured club in the second installment of the Goal! football movie trilogy, Goal! 2: Living the Dream... (2007). The film follows former Newcastle United star Santiago Muñez as he is first scouted and then signed by Real Madrid for the 2005–06 season. The film's creators wanted to put emphasis on the changes in Muñez's life after his move to Madrid. Production was done with the full support of UEFA, allowing the film crew to use many real life players in cameo roles. Real Madrid squad members featured in the film included Iker Casillas, Zinedine Zidane, David Beckham, Ronaldo, Roberto Carlos, Raúl, Sergio Ramos, Robinho, Michael Owen, Míchel Salgado, Júlio Baptista, Steve McManaman and Iván Helguera. Non-Real Madrid players to make cameo appearances included Ronaldinho, Thierry Henry, Lionel Messi, Samuel Eto'o, Andrés Iniesta, Pablo Aimar, Freddie Ljungberg, Cesc Fàbregas and Santiago Cañizares. In the film, both Florentino Pérez and Alfredo Di Stéfano presented the fictional player Muñez to the club after his signing.[322] Real, The Movie is a 2005 part feature, part documentary film that showcases the worldwide passion for Real Madrid. Produced by the club and directed by Borja Manso, it follows five sub-stories of fans from around the world and their love for the club. Along with the fictional portion of the film, it also contains real footage of the squad, during training at Ciudad Real Madrid, matches, and interviews. Although the film mentions all of the squad, it mainly focuses on galácticos such as David Beckham, Zinedine Zidane, Raúl, Luís Figo, Ronaldo, Iker Casillas and Roberto Carlos, among others. The film was originally produced in Spanish, but has been dubbed for their worldwide fanbase. The book White Storm: 100 years of Real Madrid by Phil Ball was the first English-language history of Real Madrid. Published in 2002, it talks about the most successful moments of the club during its first centenary, having been translated into various languages. In late 2011, Real Madrid released a digital music album, entitled Legends, and a remix of the club's anthem, \"Himno del Real Madrid,\" was released as the first single from the album.[323] Real Madrid TV is an encrypted digital television channel, operated by Real Madrid and specialising in the club. The channel is available in Spanish and English. It is located at Ciudad Real Madrid in Valdebebas (Madrid), Real Madrid's training centre. Hala Madrid is a magazine published quarterly for the Real Madrid club members and the Madridistas Fan Club card holders.[324] The phrase Hala Madrid, meaning \"Forward Madrid\" or \"Go Madrid\", is also the title of the club's official anthem, which is often sung by the Madridistas (the club's fans).[6] The magazine includes reports on the club's matches in the previous month, as well as information about the reserve and youth teams. Features often include interviews with players, both past and present, and the club's historic matches.[324] Real Madrid has appeared in many football-based video games, namely in the FIFA and Pro Evolution Soccer series. A Real Madrid player has appeared on the cover of both titles a combined seven times. In 2007, Spanish game publisher Virgin Play signed a deal with the club to make officially licensed Real Madrid video games. The only one released under the deal (due to Virgin Play's liquidation in September 2009) would end up being Real Madrid: The Game, which was developed by Atomic Planet Entertainment and was published under Virgin Play's publishing division V.2 Play in May 2009 for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, Windows, Wii and Nintendo DS exclusively in European territories Virgin Play released their products in. The game featured a career mode with a mixture of role-playing and simulation as well as arcade-styled Football gameplay. Spanish teams are limited to three players without EU citizenship. The squad list includes only the principal nationality of each player; several non-European players on the squad have dual citizenship with an EU country. Also, players from the ACP countries in Africa, the Caribbean, and the Pacific that are signatories to the Cotonou Agreement are not counted against non-EU quotas due to the Kolpak ruling.

                "content": "Share This article The Franklin Fire has left a trail of destruction in Malibu, CA, raging out of control as it has displaced thousands of residents, including several Hollywood stars. The fire started late Monday night. Tuesday's daylight revealed the damage as residents recalled their neighborhoods encircled by the fast-moving flames. \"We were completely surrounded by fire everywhere you looked,\" said Malibu resident Alec Gellis. \"I thought I was going to have to drive through a ring of fire just to get out of here.\" Gellis saved at least five homes in his neighborhood by pumping pool water through a high-powered hose. \"There was so much fire in here it was insane,\" he explained. Some homes burned to the ground as the fire continued through Tuesday. \"A small number of homes in the affected area have been destroyed and damaged,\" said Fire Chief Anthony Marrone, of the County of Los Angeles Fire Department. \"The exact number is currently unknown. We do have preliminary reports that seven structures are destroyed, and eight structures are damaged. This is from an aerial view that we are able to look at damage.\" More than 8,000 homes and other structures faced the threat of the fire including more than 2,000 where residents were ordered to evacuate. The American Red Cross opened a shelter for residents in need. \"To come here and just have somewhere to hang out and you know, get a cup of coffee and lay down on a cot after a tough sleep on the bench seat of the truck was really nice,\" said evacuee Matthew Ryder. The ferocious flames have been fueled by winds gusting to 80 miles an hour. At one point the fire jumped the Pacific Coast highway. Officials say the fire is zero percent contained and some 1,500 firefighters are building containment lines as air tankers drop water on the blaze. Monday night, the blaze reached the edges of Pepperdine University. Videos show trees on fire near the school's library where students sheltered inside. \"It was just a pretty wild ride, but I got to give props to the university,\" said student Marcello Campana. \"They handled it pretty well. Felt, felt pretty safe. It was definitively a little scary at some points, but I think it's pretty, pretty under control now.\" The fire also threatened the homes of several celebrities including actor Dick van Dyke and Cher. Van Dyke posted on Facebook, \"Arlene and I have safely evacuated with our animals except Bobo escaped as we were leaving. We're praying he'll be ok and that our community will survive these terrible fires.\" Meanwhile, by late Tuesday forecasters said the strongest winds had passed but the fire is still uncontained, and danger remains. The cause of the fire is under investigation.

                "content": "Manage your account Improving weather conditions in Southern California are expected to help more than 1,500 firefighters battling the wind-driven wildfire in Malibu, California, that's destroyed homes and forced residents to flee. Named the Franklin Fire, it had burned nearly 5 square miles near the campus of Pepperdine University as of Wednesday morning. “It was insane,” Malibu evacuee Jessica Jones told the Los Angeles Times. “The bright red flames and glow of the fire were all around the ridgeline as we were leaving.” Jones and her companion Matthew Ryder fled the fire with four things very important to them: Their goats named Willie, Russell and Ginger, along with potbellied pig Penelope. As many as 20,000 people have been forced out of their homes including celebrities like Cher and Dick Van Dyke. While Malibu is known for its celebrity and uber-wealthy residents, Kasey Earnest, executive director of the Boys and Girls Club of Malibu said Tuesday that she's especially concerned about the lower- and middle-class families, ranchers and farmers who make up the community, too. “I refer to those residents as the heart of Malibu,” she said. “They’re just normal families — nobody’s landing a helicopter on their property.” (MORE: 'Particularly Dangerous Situation' Santa Ana Wind Event In SoCal) The cause of the fire wasn't immediately known, but Santa Ana winds were to blame for extremely dangerous fire conditions across much of Southern California. Gusts over 50 mph were reported in the area of the fire. Winds will continue to decrease on Wednesday as the high-pressure system over the interior West that fueled the Santa Ana winds weakens. However, relative humidity levels will remain low until a moist onshore flow from the Pacific Ocean returns Thursday. \"There is a chance of isolated showers from a Pacific storm Saturday, but we don't expect a widespread soaking which is sorely needed in South California,\" weather.com senior meteorologist Chris Dolce said. Fire officials said that a \"minimal number\" of homes had burned but there were no reports of serious injuries or deaths. Crews first responded to the blaze at around 10:45 p.m. local time Monday night, according to KTLA-TV. Pepperdine canceled classes and finals on Tuesday and there was a shelter-in-place order. The order was lifted Tuesday morning. Flames could be seen from the campus, according to a university statement. Fire engines were on campus and helicopters were dropping water collected from lakes in the school's Alumni Park onto the fire. “The university understands the worst of the fire has pushed past Pepperdine. However, there are smaller spot fires on campus that are not threatening life or structures, and fire resources remain on campus to address these spot fires as they occur,” Pepperdine posted in a statement online. (MORE: November 2024 Was Planet's Second-Warmest On Record) Gabrielle Salgado was one of the students who was taking shelter in the university library. “Just seeing the flames grow and seeing that bright red color of fire just get brighter and brighter and brighter — it was so scary,” she told KABC-TV. Power to tens of thousands of people had been shut off by Monday night as utilities worked to mitigate the impacts of Southern California’s notorious Santa Ana winds, whose strong gusts could damage electrical equipment and spark wildfires. The Woolsey Fire that roared through Malibu in 2018, killing three people and destroying 1,600 homes, was sparked by Edison equipment \"This has been a traumatic 20 hours for the city of Malibu,” said Malibu Mayor Doug Stewart on Tuesday. The Malibu City Hall was in the fire’s path, so officials had to relocate to nearby Calabasas as a base for emergency operations, he continued. Many major fires have burned in Malibu, and there's now a familiar cycle where once-lush vegetation is charred. “It burns, it grows back, and we’re resilient and strong,” the mayor said.

                "content": "The UEFA Champions League (abbreviated as UCL) is an annual club association football competition organised by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) that is contested by top-division European clubs. The competition begins with a round robin league phase to qualify for the double-legged knockout rounds, and a single-leg final. It is the most-watched club competition in the world and the third most-watched football competition overall, behind only the UEFA European Championship and the FIFA World Cup. It is one of the most prestigious football tournaments in the world and the most prestigious club competition in European football, played by the national league champions (and, for some nations, one or more runners-up) of their national associations. Introduced in 1955 as the Coupe des Clubs Champions Européens (French for European Champion Clubs' Cup), and commonly known as the European Cup, it was initially a straight knockout tournament open only to the champions of Europe's domestic leagues, with its winner reckoned as the European club champion. The competition took on its current name in 1992, adding a round-robin group stage in 1991 and allowing multiple entrants from certain countries since the 1997–98 season.[1] While only the winners of many of Europe's national leagues can enter the competition, the top 5 leagues by coefficient provide four teams each by default,[2] with a possibility for additional spots based on performance during the previous season.[3][4] Clubs that finish below the qualifying spots are eligible for the second-tier UEFA Europa League competition, and since 2021, for the third-tier UEFA Conference League.[5] In its present format, the Champions League begins in early July with three qualifying rounds and a play-off round, all played over two legs. The seven surviving teams enter the league phase, joining 29 teams qualified in advance. The 36 teams each play eight opponents, four home and four away. The 24 highest-ranked teams proceed to the knockout phase that culminates with the final match in late May or early June.[6] The winner of the Champions League automatically qualifies for the following year's Champions League, the UEFA Super Cup, the FIFA Intercontinental Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup.[7][8] Spanish clubs have the most victories (20 wins), followed by England (15 wins) and Italy (12 wins). England has the most winning teams, with six clubs having won the title. The competition has been won by 23 clubs and 13 of them have won it more than once.[9] Real Madrid is the most successful club in the tournament's history, having won it 15 times. Madrid is the only club to have won it five times in a row (the first five editions).[10] Only one club has won all of their matches in a single tournament en route to the tournament victory: Bayern Munich in the 2019–20 season.[11] Real Madrid is the current European champion, having beaten Borussia Dortmund 2–0 in the 2024 final for their fifteenth title. The first time the champions of two European leagues met was in what was nicknamed the 1895 World Championship, when English champions Sunderland beat Scottish champions Heart of Midlothian 5–3.[12] The first pan-European tournament was the Challenge Cup, a competition between clubs in the Austro-Hungarian Empire.[13] Three years later, in 1900, the champions of Belgium, Netherlands and Switzerland, which were the only existing leagues in continental Europe at the time, participated in the Coupe Van der Straeten Ponthoz, thus being dubbed as the \"club championship of the continent\" by the local newspapers.[14][15] The Mitropa Cup, a competition modelled after the Challenge Cup, was created in 1927, an idea of Austrian Hugo Meisl, and played between Central European clubs.[16] In 1930, the Coupe des Nations (French: Nations Cup), the first attempt to create a cup for national champion clubs of Europe, was played and organised by Swiss club Servette.[17] Held in Geneva, it brought together ten champions from across the continent. The tournament was won by Újpest of Hungary.[17] Latin European nations came together to form the Latin Cup in 1949.[18] After receiving reports from his journalists over the highly successful South American Championship of Champions of 1948, Gabriel Hanot, editor of L'Équipe, began proposing the creation of a continent-wide tournament.[19] In interviews, Jacques Ferran (one of the founders of the European Champions Cup, together with Gabriel Hanot),[20] said that the South American Championship of Champions was the inspiration for the European Champions Cup.[21] After Stan Cullis declared Wolverhampton Wanderers \"Champions of the World\" following a successful run of friendlies in the 1950s, in particular a 3–2 friendly victory against Budapest Honvéd, Hanot finally managed to convince UEFA to put into practice such a tournament.[1] It was conceived in Paris in 1955 as the European Champion Clubs' Cup.[1] The first European Cup took place during the 1955–56 season.[22][23] Sixteen teams participated (some by invitation): AC Milan (Italy), AGF Aarhus (Denmark), Anderlecht (Belgium), Djurgården (Sweden), Gwardia Warszawa (Poland), Hibernian (Scotland), Partizan (Yugoslavia), PSV Eindhoven (Netherlands), Rapid Wien (Austria), Real Madrid (Spain), Rot-Weiss Essen (West Germany), Saarbrücken (Saar), Servette (Switzerland), Sporting CP (Portugal), Reims (France) and Vörös Lobogó (Hungary).[22][23] The first European Cup match took place on 4 September 1955, and ended in a 3–3 draw between Sporting CP and Partizan.[22][23] The first goal in European Cup history was scored by João Baptista Martins of Sporting CP.[22][23] The inaugural final took place at the Parc des Princes between Stade de Reims and Real Madrid on 13 June 1956.[22][23][24] The Spanish squad came back from behind to win 4–3 thanks to goals from Alfredo Di Stéfano and Marquitos, as well as two goals from Héctor Rial.[22][23][24] Real Madrid successfully defended the trophy next season in their home stadium, the Santiago Bernabéu, against Fiorentina.[25][26] After a scoreless first half, Real Madrid scored twice in six minutes to defeat the Italians.[24][25][26] In 1958, Milan failed to capitalise after going ahead on the scoreline twice, only for Real Madrid to equalise.[27][28] The final, held in Heysel Stadium, went to extra time where Francisco Gento scored the game-winning goal to allow Real Madrid to retain the title for the third consecutive season.[24][27][28] In a rematch of the first final, Real Madrid faced Stade Reims at the Neckarstadion for the 1959 final, and won 2–0.[24][29][30] West German side Eintracht Frankfurt became the first team not to compete in the Latin cup to reach the European Cup final.[18][31][32] The 1960 final holds the record for the most goals scored, with Real Madrid beating Eintracht Frankfurt 7–3 at Hampden Park, courtesy of four goals by Ferenc Puskás and a hat-trick by Alfredo Di Stéfano.[24][31][32] This was Real Madrid's fifth consecutive title, a record that still stands today.[9] Real Madrid's reign ended in the 1960–61 season when bitter rivals Barcelona dethroned them in the first round.[33][34] Barcelona were defeated in the final by Portuguese side Benfica 3–2 at the Wankdorf Stadium.[33][34][35] Reinforced by Eusébio, Benfica defeated Real Madrid 5–3 at the Olympic Stadium in Amsterdam and kept the title for a second consecutive season.[35][36][37] Benfica wanted to repeat Real Madrid's successful run of the 1950s after reaching the showpiece event of the 1962–63 European Cup, but a brace from Brazilian-Italian José Altafini at Wembley gave the spoils to Milan, making the trophy leave the Iberian Peninsula for the first time ever.[38][39][40] Inter Milan beat an ageing Real Madrid 3–1 at the Ernst-Happel-Stadion to win the 1963–64 season and replicate their local-rival's success.[41][42][43] The title stayed in Milan for the third year in a row after Inter beat Benfica 1–0 at their home ground, the San Siro.[44][45][46] Under the leadership of Jock Stein, Scottish club Celtic beat Inter Milan 2–1 in the 1967 final to become the first British club to win the European Cup.[47][48] The Celtic players that day, all of whom were born within 30 miles (48 km) of Glasgow, subsequently became known as the \"Lisbon Lions\".[49] The 1967–68 season saw Manchester United become the first English team to win the European Cup, beating two-times winners Benfica 4–1 in the final.[50] This final came ten years after the Munich air disaster, which had claimed the lives of eight United players and left their manager, Matt Busby, fighting for his life.[51] In the 1968–69 season, Ajax became the first Dutch team to reach the European Cup final, but they were beaten 4–1 by Milan, who claimed their second European Cup, with Pierino Prati scoring a hat-trick.[52] The 1969–70 season saw the first Dutch winners of the competition. Feyenoord knocked out the defending champions, Milan in the second round,[53] before beating Celtic in the final.[54] In the 1970–71 season, Ajax won the title, beating Greek side Panathinaikos in the final.[55] the season saw a number of changes, with penalty shoot-outs being introduced, and the away goals rule being changed so that it would be used in all rounds except the final.[56] It was also the first time a Greek team reached the final, as well as the first season that Real Madrid failed to qualify, having finished sixth in La Liga the previous season.[57] Ajax went on to win the competition three years in row (1971 to 1973), which Bayern Munich emulated from 1974 to 1976, before Liverpool won their first two titles in 1977 and 1978.[58] The following seasons saw victories in 1978–79 and 1979–80 for Brian Clough's Nottingham Forest. The following year Liverpool won their third title before Aston Villa continued the sense of English dominance in 1982. In 1982–83, Hamburger SV broke the English dominance. Liverpool regained it in 1983–84 before losing to Juventus (1984–85); Steaua București then won in 1985–86, Porto in 1986–87, PSV Eindhoven in 1987–88; Milan (2), Red Star Belgrade and Barcelona became champions before the competition was re-formulated as the UEFA Champions League. All English clubs were banned for five years (Liverpool for six years) following the 1985 European Cup final due to the Heysel Stadium disaster. \"Magic...it's magic above all else. When you hear the anthem it captivates you straight away.\" The UEFA Champions League anthem, officially titled simply as \"Champions League\", was written by Tony Britten, and is an adaptation of George Frideric Handel's 1727 anthem Zadok the Priest (one of his Coronation Anthems).[60][61] UEFA commissioned Britten in 1992 to arrange an anthem, and the piece was performed by London's Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and sung by the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields.[60] Stating that \"the anthem is now almost as iconic as the trophy\", UEFA's official website adds it is \"known to set the hearts of many of the world's top footballers aflutter\".[60] The chorus contains the three official languages used by UEFA: English, German, and French.[62] The climactic moment is set to the exclamations 'Die Meister! Die Besten! Les Grandes Équipes! The Champions!'.[63] The anthem's chorus is played before each UEFA Champions League game as the two teams are lined up, as well as at the beginning and end of television broadcasts of the matches. In addition to the anthem, there is also entrance music, which contains parts of the anthem itself, which is played as teams enter the field.[64] The complete anthem is about three minutes long, and has two short verses and the chorus.[62] Special vocal versions have been performed live at the Champions League final with lyrics in other languages, changing over to the host nation's language for the chorus. These versions were performed by Andrea Bocelli (Italian; Rome 2009, Milan 2016 and Cardiff 2017), Juan Diego Flores (Spanish; Madrid 2010), All Angels (Wembley 2011), Jonas Kaufmann and David Garrett (Munich 2012) and Mariza (Lisbon 2014). In the 2013 final at Wembley, the chorus was played twice. In the 2018 and 2019 finals, held in Kyiv and Madrid respectively, the instrumental version of the chorus was played, by 2Cellos (2018) and Asturia Girls (2019).[65][66] In the 2023 final, held in Istanbul, Hungarian pianist Ádám György performed the piano version of the anthem.[67] The anthem has been released commercially in its original version on iTunes and Spotify with the title of Champions League Theme. In 2018, composer Hans Zimmer remixed the anthem with rapper Vince Staples for EA Sports' video game FIFA 19, with it also featuring in the game's reveal trailer.[68] In 1991, UEFA asked its commercial partner, Television Event and Media Marketing (TEAM), to help brand the Champions League. This resulted in the anthem, \"house colours\" of black and white or silver and a logo, and the \"starball\". The starball was created by Design Bridge, a London-based firm selected by TEAM after a competition.[69] TEAM gives particular attention to detail in how the colours and starball are depicted at matches. According to TEAM, \"Irrespective of whether you are a spectator in Moscow or Milan, you will always see the same stadium dressing materials, the same opening ceremony featuring the 'starball' centre circle ceremony, and hear the same UEFA Champions League Anthem\". Based on research it conducted, TEAM concluded that by 1999, \"the starball logo had achieved a recognition rate of 94 percent among fans\".[70] The UEFA Champions League used to begin with a double round-robin group stage of 32 teams until it evolved into a league phase of 36 teams, which is preceded by two qualification 'streams' for teams that do not receive direct entry to the tournament proper. The two streams are divided between teams qualified by virtue of being league champions, and those qualified by virtue of finishing second, third or fourth in their national championship. The number of teams that each association enters into the UEFA Champions League is based upon the UEFA coefficients of the member associations. These coefficients are generated by the results of clubs representing each association during the previous five Champions League, Europa League and Conference League seasons. The higher an association's coefficient, the more teams represent the association in the Champions League, and the fewer qualification rounds the association's teams must compete in. Five of the remaining seven qualifying places are granted to the winners of a four-round qualifying tournament between the remaining 43 or 44 national champions, within which those champions from associations with higher coefficients receive byes to later rounds. The other two are granted to the winners of a three-round qualifying tournament between ten and eleven clubs from the associations ranked 5–6 through 15, which have qualified based upon finishing second, third or fourth in their respective national league. In addition to sporting criteria, any club must be licensed by its national association to participate in the Champions League. To obtain a license, the club must meet certain stadium, infrastructure and finance requirements. In 2005–06, Liverpool and Artmedia Bratislava became the first teams to reach the Champions League group stage after playing in all three qualifying rounds. Real Madrid and Barcelona hold the record for the most appearances in the group stage, having qualified 25 times, followed by Porto and Bayern Munich on 24.[71] Between 1999 and 2008, no differentiation was made between champions and non-champions in qualification. The 16 top-ranked teams spread across the biggest domestic leagues qualified directly for the tournament group stage. Prior to this, three preliminary knockout qualifying rounds whittled down the remaining teams, with teams starting in different rounds. An exception to the usual European qualification system happened in 2005, after Liverpool won the Champions League the year before, but did not finish in a Champions League qualification place in the Premier League that season. UEFA gave special dispensation for Liverpool to enter the Champions League, giving England five qualifiers.[72] UEFA subsequently ruled that the defending champions qualify for the competition the following year regardless of their domestic league placing. However, for those leagues with four entrants in the Champions League, this meant that, if the Champions League winner fell outside of its domestic league's top four, it would qualify at the expense of the fourth-placed team in the league. Until 2015–16, no association could have more than four entrants in the Champions League.[73] In May 2012, Tottenham Hotspur finished fourth in the 2011–12 Premier League, two places ahead of Chelsea, but failed to qualify for the 2012–13 Champions League, after Chelsea won the 2012 final.[74] Tottenham were demoted to the 2012–13 UEFA Europa League.[74] In May 2013,[75] it was decided that, starting from the 2015–16 season (and continuing at least for the three-year cycle until the 2017–18 season), the winners of the previous season's UEFA Europa League would qualify for the UEFA Champions League, entering at least the play-off round, and entering the group stage if the berth reserved for the Champions League title holders was not used. The previous limit of a maximum of four teams per association was increased to five, meaning that a fourth-placed team from one of the top three ranked associations would only have to be moved to the Europa League if both the Champions League and Europa League winners came from that association and both finished outside the top four of their domestic league.[76] In 2007, Michel Platini, the UEFA president, had proposed taking one place from the three leagues with four entrants and allocating it to that nation's cup winners. This proposal was rejected in a vote at a UEFA Strategy Council meeting.[77] In the same meeting, however, it was agreed that the third-placed team in the top three leagues would receive automatic qualification for the group stage, rather than entry into the third qualifying round, while the fourth-placed team would enter the play-off round for non-champions, guaranteeing an opponent from one of the top 15 leagues in Europe. This was part of Platini's plan to increase the number of teams qualifying directly into the group stage, while simultaneously increasing the number of teams from lower-ranked nations in the group stage.[78] In 2012, Arsène Wenger referred to qualifying for the Champions League by finishing in the top four places in the Premier League as the \"4th Place Trophy\". The phrase was coined after a pre-match conference when he was questioned about Arsenal's lack of a trophy after exiting the FA Cup. He said \"The first trophy is to finish in the top four\".[79] At Arsenal's 2012 AGM, Wenger was also quoted as saying: \"For me there are five trophies every season: Premier League, Champions League, the third is to qualify for the Champions League...\"[80] Beginning with the 2024–25 season, UEFA changed the format of their three club competitions, abandoning the group stage in favour of an expanded league phase.[81] The number of participating teams was increased from 32 to 36 teams. Teams are no longer divided into groups of four teams each but are ranked in a single table. Each team plays eight matches against eight different opponents. For the draw of the league phase, teams are divided into four seeding pots according to their UEFA coefficient. Each team will play against two teams from each pot, one home and one away. The league phase is played from September to January, while the knockout phase begins in February, with matches predominantly played on Tuesday and Wednesday nights. After the league phase, a two-legged knockout play-off round is played between teams finishing 9–16 (seeded) and 17–24 (unseeded) in the league phase. Teams finishing in the top eight of the league phase receive a bye to the round of 16 as seeded teams, while the eight winning teams from the knockout play-off round will enter the round of 16 draw as unseeded teams. Teams finishing 25th–36th place in the league phase and the eight losers of the knockout play-offs are eliminated from the competition and from European football since it is no longer possible to enter the Europa League from the league phase onwards. After the round of 16 the competition follows the traditional knockout format with quarter-finals, semi-finals (both two legged and without association draw protection) and then the final at a venue chosen prior to the season. The final is typically held in late May or early June. Prior to the 2024–25 season, the tournament proper began with a group stage of 32 teams, divided into eight groups of four.[82] The draw to determine which teams entered each group was seeded based on each team's UEFA coefficient, and no group could contain more than one club from each association. Each team played six group stage games, meeting the other three teams in its group home and away in a round-robin format.[82] The first place team and the runners-up from each group then progressed to the next round. The third-placed teams entered the Europa League's knockout round and the fourth-placed teams were eliminated from the competition. For the next stage – the last 16 – the winning team from one group played against the runners-up from another group, but teams from the same association could not be drawn against each other (see random two-sided matching). From the quarter-finals onwards, the draw was entirely random, without association protection.[83] The group stage was played from September to December, whilst the knockout stage began in February, with matches usually played on Tuesday and Wednesday nights. The knockout ties were played in a two-legged format, with the exception of the final. In the 2019–20 season, due to the COVID-19 pandemic the tournament was suspended for five months. The format of the remainder of the tournament was temporarily amended as a result, with the quarter-finals and semi-finals being played as single match knockout ties at neutral venues in Lisbon, Portugal in the summer with the final taking place on 23 August 2020.[84] The following is the default access list. Changes will be made to the access list above if the Champions League or Europa League title holders qualify for the tournament via their domestic leagues. Each year, the winning team is presented with the European Champion Clubs' Cup, the current version of which has been awarded since 1967. From the 1968–69 season and prior to the 2008–09 season any team that won the Champions League three years in a row or five times overall was awarded the official trophy permanently.[86] Each time a club achieved this, a new official trophy had to be forged for the following season.[87] Five clubs own a version of the official trophy: Real Madrid, Ajax, Bayern Munich, Milan and Liverpool.[86] Since 2008, the official trophy has remained with UEFA and the clubs are awarded a replica.[86] The current trophy is 74 cm (29 in) tall and made of silver, weighing 11 kg (24 lb). It was designed by Jürg Stadelmann, a jeweller from Bern, Switzerland, after the original was given to Real Madrid in 1966 in recognition of their six titles to date, and cost 10,000 Swiss francs. As of the 2012–13 season, 40 gold medals are presented to the Champions League winners, and 40 silver medals to the runners-up.[88] Starting with the 2024–25 season, the distribution of the prize money is as follows.[89] A large part of the distributed revenue from the UEFA Champions League is linked to the \"market pool\", the distribution of which is determined by the value of the television market in each nation. For the 2019–20 season, Paris Saint-Germain, who were the runners-up, earned nearly €126.8 million in total, of which €101.3 million was prize money, compared with the €125.46 million earned by Bayern Munich, who won the tournament and were awarded €112.96 million in prize money.[90] Like the FIFA World Cup, the UEFA Champions League is sponsored by a group of multinational corporations, in contrast to the single main sponsor typically found in national top-flight leagues. When the Champions League was created in 1992, it was decided that a maximum of eight companies should be allowed to sponsor the event, with each corporation being allocated four advertising boards around the perimeter of the pitch, as well as logo placement at pre- and post-match interviews and a certain number of tickets to each match. This, combined with a deal to ensure tournament sponsors were given priority on television advertisements during matches, ensured that each of the tournament's main sponsors was given maximum exposure.[91] From the 2012–13 knockout phase, UEFA used LED advertising hoardings installed in knockout participant stadiums, including the final. From the 2015–16 season onwards, UEFA has used such hoardings from the play-off round until the final.[92] Since 2021, the UEFA also used Virtual Board Replacement (VBR) technology to offer region-based advertising; regional sponsors are inserted into the hoardings as shown on the broadcast feed in specific regions along with the global sponsors.[93][94] Individual clubs may wear jerseys with advertising. However, only two sponsorships are permitted per jersey in addition to that of the kit manufacturer, at the chest and the left sleeve.[95] Exceptions are made for non-profit organisations, which can feature on the front of the shirt, incorporated with the main sponsor or in place of it; or on the back, either below the squad number or on the collar area.[96] If a club plays a match in a nation where the relevant sponsorship category is restricted (such as France's alcohol advertising restriction), then they must remove that logo from their jerseys. For example, when Rangers played French side Auxerre in the 1996–97 Champions League, they wore the logo of the holiday chain Center Parcs instead of their primary sponsor, McEwan's Lager (both companies at the time were subsidiaries of Scottish & Newcastle).[97] The tournament's main sponsors for the 2024–27 cycle are: Adidas is a secondary sponsor and supplies the official match ball, while Macron supplies the referee kits.[107] The competition attracts an extensive television audience, not just in Europe, but throughout the world. The final of the tournament has been, in recent years, the most-watched annual sporting event in the world.[108] The final of the 2012–13 tournament had the competition's highest TV ratings to date, drawing approximately 360 million television viewers.[109] Notes Players that are still active in Europe are highlighted in boldface. The table below does not include appearances made in the qualification stage of the competition. Starting from the 2021–22 edition, UEFA introduced the UEFA Champions League Player of the Season award. The jury is composed of the coaches of the clubs that participated in the group stage of the competition, as well as 55 journalists selected by the European Sports Media (ESM) group, one from each UEFA member association. In the same season, UEFA also introduced the UEFA Champions League Young Player of the Season award.",

The top team in the league comes out UEFA champions league every year. 32 teams will play the game and determines the best football club. At first, it was started by France, not the European Football Federation. It was played only as a home and away tournament, but a group stage was added from the 1991-92 season. The teams are selected because of good performances in their respective domestic leagues. The teams used to have to win their countries' league, but more than one team can play in the competition depending on how good their league is. For example: the Spanish League can get 4 Spanish clubs in the competition compared to the Kazakhstan League which can only get one team in the competition. Real Madrid won the Champions League the first five times it was held, still a record. They have also won the Champions League/European Cup 15 times, which is also a record. A total of 23 clubs from 10 European countries won the Champions League. 12 clubs won it more than once: Real Madrid, Milan, Bayern, Liverpool, Barcelona, Ajax, Manchester United, Inter Milan, Juventus, Benfica, Porto, Chelsea and Nottingham Forest. 2023",

                "content": "Marcus Dell Gastineau (born November 20, 1956) is an American former professional football player who was a defensive end for the New York Jets of the National Football League (NFL) from 1979 to 1988. A five-time All-Pro and Pro Bowler, he was one of the quickest and most feared pass rushers of his generation, and the first player to lead the NFL in sacks in consecutive seasons. Gastineau was ranked no. 8 in National Football League (NFL) history on NFL Network's top 10 pass rushers. He entered Eastern Arizona Junior College in 1975 and earned All-America honors in his first season. He transferred to Arizona State University, and spent just one season playing defensive end there before finally settling upon East Central Oklahoma State University, now East Central University, in Ada, Oklahoma. He had 27 quarterback sacks in his college career,[1] and earned Outstanding Defensive Lineman honors for the North in the 1979 Senior Bowl. Gastineau became ECU's first-ever draft pick when the New York Jets selected him in the second round of the 1979 NFL draft.[2] Connie Carberg, the first female NFL scout in history, was credited with helping the Jets discover Gastineau. The team was coaching in the Senior Bowl and needed another defensive lineman on the roster due to a vacancy, so Carberg called several prospects before suggesting Gastineau to be the replacement based on a phone conversation with him. He was projected to be an eighth round draft pick at the time, but due to his performance in the Senior Bowl and other pre-draft processes, the Jets selected him in the second round.[3] Gastineau was among the most talented and honored defensive linemen of his era. He made the Pro Bowl five straight seasons (1981–1985) and finished his ten-year career with 74 officially recorded sacks (sacks were not an official stat for the first three years of his career). He was a First-team All-Pro in 1982–1984 and was consensus All-AFC in each of those years. In New York, Gastineau was a key part of the famed \"New York Sack Exchange,\" the Jets defensive line that also included Joe Klecko, Marty Lyons and Abdul Salaam. The four combined for 66 sacks in 1981, including twenty by Gastineau (In 1981 sacks were unofficial, but Gastineau's 20 sacks trailed Klecko by only half a sack), to lead the Jets to their first playoff game since 1969. He was Second-team All-Pro in 1981 as well as being consensus All-AFC. In November 1981, he, Klecko, Lyons and Salaam were invited to ring the ceremonial opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange, which served as the inspiration for their nickname.[4] With Klecko rupturing the patella tendon in his right knee in the second game of the strike shortened 1982 season against the New England Patriots, Gastineau became the new unofficial leader of the \"Sack Exchange.\" Though he was often double teamed, he finished the season with six sacks, and was voted the NFL Defensive Player of the Year by NEA (and awarded the George Halas Trophy). The Jets made the playoffs again in 1982, losing the AFC Championship game to the Miami Dolphins.[5] The 1983 season started with Gastineau and the Jets' first round pick of the 1983 NFL draft, quarterback Ken O'Brien, being arrested and charged with assault at Studio 54.[6] Despite this off-the-field indiscretion, Gastineau totaled 19 sacks to lead the NFL for the first time. Gastineau was nationally famous for doing his signature \"Sack Dance\" after sacking an opposing quarterback. However, he had to stop when the NFL declared it \"unsportsmanlike taunting\" in March 1984 and began fining players for it. The ban on the dance stemmed from a bench-clearing brawl in the third quarter of a 27–24 overtime win over the Los Angeles Rams at Shea Stadium on September 25, 1983, which began with a sack of Vince Ferragamo by Gastineau who was then shoved from behind by Jackie Slater, the right tackle he had beaten on the play. One month later on October 21, a total of $15,750 in fines was assessed by the NFL against 16 Jets ($7,300) and 21 Rams ($8,450), with Gastineau incurring a $1,000 penalty.[7][8] Gastineau had his best individual season with an NFL record 22 sacks (leading the NFL for the second year in a row), 69 tackles and one fumble recovery for a touchdown in 1984. He was voted the UPI AFC Defensive Player of the Year, and was also named MVP of that season's Pro Bowl after tallying four sacks and a safety in that game. Gastineau's sack record stood for 17 years until Michael Strahan broke it in 2001. New defensive coordinator Bud Carson installed a 3-4 defense for the 1985 season. Gastineau shifted from left defensive end to right defensive end, although he did move him around to allow for mismatches. Gastineau broke his hand early in that season but still finished second in the league with 13½ sacks and was voted All-Pro by the NEA. The Jets finished 11–5 in 1985 to earn a wildcard spot in the playoffs along with fellow AFC East rivals, the New England Patriots. Gastineau recorded a sack in the Jets' 26–14 loss to the Pats at the Meadowlands.[9] For the start of the 1986 season, Gastineau was featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated alongside New York Giants star linebacker Lawrence Taylor. Injuries limited Gastineau to just two sacks in ten games (his lowest total since his rookie season) as he was slowed by groin and abdominal muscle ailments and then by a damaged left knee that required arthroscopic surgery and forced him to miss the last five games of the regular season. Gastineau rebounded in the postseason, however, recording a sack in the Jets 35–15 wildcard round victory over the Kansas City Chiefs[10] and 2+1⁄2 more in the divisional-round playoff game against the Cleveland Browns. Late in the fourth quarter of that game, though, with the Jets leading 20–10 and the Browns facing a second down and 24 from their own 18-yard line, Gastineau was called for a roughing the passer penalty. The play had originally resulted in an incomplete pass by Browns quarterback Bernie Kosar so instead of having a 3rd-and-24 situation, the 15-yard penalty on Gastineau gave the Browns a first down at their own 33. From there, the Browns drove the remaining 67 yards to a touchdown which cut the Jets' lead to 20–17. The Browns would later tie the game with 7 seconds remaining in regulation on a 22-yard field goal by Mark Moseley and win it on a 27-yard field goal by Moseley 2 minutes and 2 seconds into the second overtime period. After the game, Gastineau said that he hadn't been guilty of roughing and that he was \"just following through.\" Teammate Marty Lyons, the Jets' other starting defensive end, defended Gastineau saying, \"(Ben Dreith) is a referee who's known to take care of the quarterback.\" Joe Walton, the Jets' head coach would say only, \"It was a very key play, Mark was just trying to do the best he could do.\"[11] In 1987, Gastineau was the only Jet regular to immediately cross the picket line in that year's players' strike, citing his need to pay alimony. Teammate Dave Jennings said of this understandably unpopular move: \"We expected it from Mark. He's always put himself in front of the team.\" The crossing brought to a head longstanding tensions between Gastineau and his teammates; he had never been popular in the locker room.[12] Gastineau got into a fight with backup center Guy Bingham when he drove into the Jets complex early in the strike. Gastineau was later joined in crossing the picket line by teammates Marty Lyons and Joe Klecko, further undermining the players' strike. Gastineau led the AFC in sacks seven weeks into the 1988 season.[13] He then abruptly announced his retirement soon after Brigitte Nielsen, to whom he had previously announced his engagement, claimed to be suffering from cancer of the uterus.[14][13] The announcement was followed by a surge of investigation by local New York papers of whether she was telling the truth, reflecting citywide mistrust of Gastineau.[15] At the time of his retirement, Gastineau was the NFL's all-time leader in sacks. Gastineau attempted a comeback with the BC Lions of the Canadian Football League in 1990, but was released after only four games.[16] Gastineau was inducted into the New York Jets Ring of Honor on October 8, 2012.[17] In 2022, the Professional Football Researchers Association named Gastineau to the PFRA Hall of Very Good Class of 2022.[18] In 1991, Gastineau began a career in boxing, lasting five years. In his first fight, Gastineau knocked out Derrick Dukes in the first round. Dukes, a professional wrestler, later admitted he took a dive. TV newsmagazine show 60 Minutes interviewed several others that fought Gastineau and were told to take dives to make Gastineau look good. His career ended in 1996 when he lost to another former football player, Alonzo Highsmith. In 18 career bouts, his record in boxing was 15 wins, two losses, and one no-contest. Gastineau has been married three times. His first wife, Lisa Gastineau and their daughter Brittny Gastineau starred in the E! reality television show, The Gastineau Girls. Gastineau has a son with actress Brigitte Nielsen, Killian Marcus.[19] He was estranged from both children in 2010.[20] Shortly after his release from prison in 2001, Gastineau claimed he had put his turbulent past behind him after he had a religious conversion to faith in Jesus Christ. Gastineau has appeared on programs such as The 700 Club to speak of his experience.[21] Gastineau is a member of the choir at Times Square Church, where he married third wife JoAnn in 2007.[17] In 1984, Gastineau was found guilty of assaulting a patron at Studio 54. He was sentenced to 90 hours of community service, teaching football to inmates at Rikers Island.[22] In 1991, Gastineau was arrested for picking up a package of amphetamine pills at Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport. He was sentenced to three years probation in 1993.[23][24] In September 2000, Gastineau was sentenced to 18 months in jail after failing to complete an anger management course after hitting his second wife Patricia.[24] In 2016, Gastineau was diagnosed with dementia, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease.[25] Gastineau said he believed the illnesses could be traced back to football, stating he wanted to continue to teach younger football players how to play the game safely.[26] He blames the brain diseases on poor tackling technique.[27] In March 2019, Gastineau revealed that he had been battling colon cancer.[28]",

                "content": "NEW! Find where to watch all of your favorite sports! In this excerpt from 30 for 30's \"The New York Sack Exchange,\" Mark Gastineau has a tense exchange with Brett Favre over Michael Strahan sacking Favre to break Gastineau's single-season sack record. (2:28) Former New York Jets star Mark Gastineau, who has carried a grudge against Brett Favre for two decades, confronted the Hall of Fame quarterback last year at a memorabilia show and accused him of deliberately taking a sack that cost Gastineau the NFL's single-season record. It made for a tense and uncomfortable scene, captured on video. It appears in the ESPN 30 for 30 documentary \"The New York Sack Exchange,\" which premieres 8 p.m. ET Friday (ESPN/ESPN+). An angry Gastineau attended the memorabilia show in Chicago with two other members of the Jets' \"Sack Exchange,\" a four-man defensive line that dominated the early 1980s. He approached an unsuspecting Favre at a table where the Green Bay Packers legend was signing autographs. They shook hands. Favre mentioned how they had met once before. \"Yeah, right -- when you fell down for him,\" said Gastineau, alluding to former New York Giants star Michael Strahan -- the record breaker. \"I'm going to get my sack back. I'm going to get my sack back, dude.\" Favre looked bewildered. \"You probably would hurt me,\" he said. \"Well, I don't care,\" Gastineau said, pointing at Favre. \"You hurt me. You hurt me! You hear me?\" \"Yeah, I hear you,\" Favre said. \"You really hurt me,\" Gastineau shot back. \"You really hurt me, Brett.\" At that point, Favre was escorted away by one of his handlers, leaving a seething Gastineau by himself. He was miked up by a camera crew, which was following him. Gastineau was referring to the final game of the 2001 season, when Strahan broke Gastineau's single-season record with a controversial sack of Favre. With 22 sacks, Gastineau held the mark from 1984 to 2001. Many believe Favre went down on purpose so Strahan could break the record with 22.5. Gastineau was in attendance that day, graciously congratulating Strahan. After 18 years of suppressing his anger, Gastineau went public with his true feelings in a 2020 interview with ESPN. He doubles down in the documentary. \"Anybody will tell you that Brett Favre took a dive,\" Gastineau said in the documentary. The 30 for 30 chronicles the rise and fall of the \"Sack Exchange\" and the complex relationship between the polarizing Gastineau and teammates Joe Klecko, Marty Lyons and the late Abdul Salaam. Reached by phone, Gastineau explained why he confronted Favre. \"I wanted to let him know it was a trash sack,\" he said. \"I've been wanting to do that for a long time -- many, many years,\" Gastineau added. \"I've only got one more guy to go to\" -- meaning Strahan, who Gastineau says he believes conspired with Favre on the record-breaking sack. Gastineau had no idea Favre would be at the show until he and his wife, Jo Ann, arrived in Chicago and saw Favre's name on a list of attendees. Lyons, who was in Chicago and witnessed the confrontation, said he tried to convince his former teammate to stay away from Favre. \"I said, 'Mark, let it go, just let it go. That happened years ago,'\" Lyons said in a phone interview. \"But he had this little crazed look in his eye.\" Later that day, Jo Ann Gastineau returned to Favre's table to smooth things over. She said she apologized, saying her husband \"didn't mean anything by it.\" The record has been a source of anguish for Strahan as well. \"The sack record is great, absolutely phenomenal, but I almost feel like in a sense it was diminished because everyone goes, 'Oh, Brett Favre gave you a sack,'\" Strahan said in \"A Football Life,\" a documentary aired in 2013 by NFL Network. \"I caught so much flak over it. ... It's not worth it, because everyone looks as if one sack that they question is the defining moment of my career.\" The Hall of Famer is no longer the sole holder of the single-season record, as Pittsburgh Steelers star T.J. Watt matched Strahan's mark with 22.5 sacks in 2021. On Tuesday, Favre posted a long thread on X, addressing what he described as \"a small dustup\" between him and Gastineau. Favre said he didn't intentionally take the sack to hurt Gastineau, saying, \"There was no malice on my part.\" In retrospect, Favre said he sees how the sack record might have benefitted Gastineau financially and strengthened his case for the Hall of Fame. \"A while back, he saw me at a card show and got his frustration off his chest,\" Favre posted. \"It's not the kind of moment that should be filmed and released. It was a private moment of frustration between two old football warriors.\" Favre endorsed Gastineau for the Hall of Fame. \"I hope this controversy brings attention to just how great Mark Gastineau was. He belongs in Canton.\"",

                "content": "Newsletters By Kyle Phillippi NFL fans remember the infamous moment when Brett Favre was “sacked” by Michael Strahan in the final regular-season game of the 2001 season. The thing to know about that has to do with those little air quotes: Favre was not actually taken to the ground by Strahan, who was one sack away from setting an NFL record with 22.5 in the season. Instead, Favre basically laid down as a show of respect so the New York Giants defender could secure the record by touching him on the ground. It was controversial at the time, but as time went on, it just became part of the NFL lore. T.J. Watt recently tied Strahan’s record in 2021, which further pushed that questionable event down the ladder. That was until Mark Gastineau, who held the record until Strahan passed him, was shown in a publicity clip for an upcoming ESPN documentary in which he confronts Favre, expressing his frustration around the play. Football is a child’s game, and before we move on, let’s call a spade a spade: this is all childish. Gastineau is seen in the 30 for 30 promo telling Favre he hurt him when he let up against Strahan and nearly physically assaulted the former quarterback while he was at an event, telling him he would be getting his “sack back” as in “I’m going to knock you down right now.” It’s all ridiculous, but clearly Gastineau isn’t over the act. Favre shared a post on X after the clip came out this week, expressing that his decision to let Strahan get the sack at the time was “without malice.” He mentioned the incident at the card show that was seen in the trailer, “It was a private moment of frustration between two old football warriors.” “I hope this controversy brings attention to just how great Mark Gastineau was,” Favre wrapped up in a lengthy thread. “He belongs in Canton [the Hall of Fame].” You heard the man. This is just a couple of old head football players with big egos. There is nothing else to see here.

                "content": "William Stephen Belichick (/ˈbɛlɪtʃɪk, ˈbɛlɪtʃɛk/; born April 16, 1952) is an American sports analyst and American football coach. Widely regarded as one of the greatest head coaches of all time,[1][2][3] he holds numerous coaching records, including the record of most Super Bowl wins (six) as a head coach, all with the New England Patriots, along with two more during his time as the defensive coordinator of the New York Giants, for a record eight combined total Super Bowl victories as coach and coordinator.[4] A renowned American football historian, Belichick is often referred to as a \"student of the game\" with a deep knowledge of the intricacies of each player position.[5][6][7][8] During his tenure with the Patriots, Belichick was a central figure as the head coach and de facto general manager during the franchise's dynasty from 2001 to 2019.[9] Belichick is a descendant of the Bill Parcells coaching tree. He began his coaching career in 1975 as an assistant for the Baltimore Colts and became the defensive coordinator for New York Giants head coach Bill Parcells by 1985. Parcells and Belichick won two Super Bowls together before Belichick left to become the head coach of the Cleveland Browns in 1991. He remained in Cleveland for five seasons but was fired following the team's 1995 season. Belichick rejoined Parcells, first in New England where the team lost Super Bowl XXXI, and later with the New York Jets. After being named head coach of the Jets, Belichick resigned after only one day on the job to accept the head coaching job for the Patriots on January 27, 2000. In 24 seasons under Belichick, the Patriots won 17 AFC East division titles, made 13 appearances in the AFC Championship Game, and appeared in nine Super Bowls, with a record six wins. Overall, Belichick has won eight Super Bowl titles (the most of any individual in NFL history) and finished as runner-up four times from his combined time as an assistant and head coach. At the time Belichick left the Patriots, he was the NFL's longest-tenured active head coach. Belichick has the most playoff coaching wins all-time with 31 and ranks third in regular season coaching wins in the NFL with 302.[10] He is also in second place for combined regular season and postseason wins, and also second place for most regular season coaching wins with one franchise.[11] Belichick is one of only three head coaches who have won six NFL titles.[12] He was named the AP NFL Coach of the Year for the 2003, 2007, and 2010 seasons. Belichick has also been selected to the NFL 2000s All-Decade Team, NFL 2010s All-Decade Team, as well as the NFL 100th Anniversary All-Time Team. Belichick was born in Nashville, Tennessee, on April 16, 1952,[13] the son of Jeannette (née Munn) and Steve Belichick.[14] Belichick was named after College Football Hall of Fame coach Bill Edwards, who was his godfather.[15] He is of Croatian ancestry;[16] his paternal grandparents, Marija Barković and Ivan Biličić, emigrated from Draganić in 1897 and settled in Monessen, Pennsylvania, having changed their names to Mary and John Belichick at the suggestion of immigration officers.[17] Belichick was raised in Annapolis, Maryland,[18] where his father was an assistant football coach at the United States Naval Academy. Belichick has said his father is one of his most important football mentors, and Belichick often studied football with him.[19] Bill reportedly learned to break down game films at a young age by watching his father and the Navy staff do their jobs.[20] Belichick graduated from Annapolis High School in 1970, where he was a classmate of Sally Brice-O'Hara, who would later become the Vice Commandant of the Coast Guard.[21][22] While there, Belichick played football and lacrosse, with the latter being his favorite sport.[23] Belichick enrolled at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, for a postgraduate year, with the intention of improving his grades and test scores to be admitted into a quality college.[24] The school honored Belichick 40 years later by inducting him into its Athletics Hall of Honor in 2011.[25] Belichick attended Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut, where he played center and tight end. In addition to being a member of the football team, Belichick played lacrosse and squash, serving as the captain of the lacrosse team during his senior season. A member of Chi Psi fraternity,[26] Belichick earned a bachelor's degree in economics in 1975.[27] Eventually, he was part of the inaugural induction class into the university's Athletics Hall of Fame in spring 2008.[28] After graduating, Belichick took a $25-per-week job as an assistant to Baltimore Colts head coach Ted Marchibroda in 1975.[29] In 1976, Belichick joined the Detroit Lions as their assistant special teams coach before adding tight ends and wide receivers to his coaching duties in 1977.[30] Belichick was dismissed along with head coach Tommy Hudspeth and the rest of the coaching staff on January 9, 1978.[31] He spent the 1978 season with the Denver Broncos as their assistant special teams coach and defensive assistant while also serving as director of films.[32][33] In 1979, Belichick began a 12-year stint with the New York Giants alongside head coach Ray Perkins as a defensive assistant and special teams coach.[34] Belichick added linebackers coaching to his duties in 1980 and was named defensive coordinator in 1985 under head coach Bill Parcells, who had replaced Perkins in 1983. The Giants won Super Bowl XXI and Super Bowl XXV following the 1986 and 1990 seasons.[35][36] Belichick's defensive game plan from the New York Giants' 20–19 upset of the Buffalo Bills in Super Bowl XXV has been placed in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.[37] From 1991 until 1995, Belichick was the head coach of the Cleveland Browns. During his tenure in Cleveland, Belichick compiled a 36–44 record, leading the team to the playoffs in 1994, his only winning year with the team.[38] Coincidentally, Belichick's lone playoff victory during his Browns tenure was achieved against the New England Patriots, who were coached by former Giants head coach Bill Parcells, in the Wild Card Round during that postseason.[39] In Belichick's final season in Cleveland, the Browns finished 5–11 despite starting 3–1.[40] One of his most controversial moves was cutting quarterback Bernie Kosar midway through the 1993 season. Kosar was signed by the Dallas Cowboys two days later and won a Super Bowl with the Cowboys in Super Bowl XXVIII as a backup. In November 1995, in the middle of the ongoing football season, Browns owner Art Modell had announced he would move his franchise to Baltimore after the season.[41] After first being given assurances that he would coach the new team that would later become the Baltimore Ravens, Belichick was instead fired on February 14, 1996, a week after the shift was officially announced.[42] In the 2013 episode of A Football Life on the Cleveland Browns relocation controversy, many sports journalists who had covered the Browns at the time had said that in retrospective, Belichick had laid the groundwork for the Ravens success in the ensuring decades including their win in Super Bowl XXXV (with Cleveland holdovers Matt Stover and Rob Burnett still with the team at that point), setting up the infrastructure by giving recently retired tight end Ozzie Newsome his first front-office job and had planned on drafting Ray Lewis in the 1996 NFL Draft if Belichick and the team stayed in Cleveland. (Indeed, the newly-christened Ravens did draft Lewis, who went on to a 17-year Hall of Fame career with the team.) Those who had covered the Browns went on to state that if the original Browns had stayed in Cleveland, Belichick would have seen his work through. For his part, Belichick stated that he was able to learn from some mistakes he had made with the Browns while largely sticking to his blueprint from Cleveland when resurrecting the Patriots, such as factoring in off-the-field issues that can affect performance. Among those interviewed, the general consensus was that Belichick's failure in Cleveland was more to do with Modell's financial struggles (even paying a young Scott Pioli only $14,000/year--equivalent to $32,447 in 2024--as a scout) that eventually led the NFL to force the sale of the Ravens to Steve Bisciotti than Belichick's own doing.[43] After his dismissal by the Cleveland Browns, Belichick served under Parcells again as assistant head coach and defensive backs coach with the New England Patriots for the 1996 season. The Patriots finished with an 11–5 record and won the AFC Championship over the Jacksonville Jaguars, but they lost to the Green Bay Packers in Super Bowl XXXI amid rumors of Parcells's impending defection.[44][45] Belichick had two stints as the head coach of the New York Jets without ever coaching a game. In February 1997, Belichick, who had been an assistant coach under Bill Parcells with the New York Giants and New England Patriots, was named the Jets interim head coach while the Jets and Patriots continued to negotiate compensation to release Parcells from his contract with the Patriots and allow Parcells to coach the Jets.[46] Six days later, the Patriots and Jets reached an agreement that allowed Parcells to coach the Jets, and Belichick became the team's assistant head coach and defensive coordinator.[47] When Parcells stepped down as head coach after the 1999 season, he had already arranged with team management to have Belichick succeed him. However, Belichick was the Jets' head coach for only one day. On January 4, 2000, when Belichick was introduced as head coach to the media—the day after his hiring was publicized—he turned it into a surprise resignation announcement. Before taking the podium, Belichick scrawled a resignation note on a napkin that read, in its entirety, \"I resign as HC of the NYJ.\" He then delivered a half-hour speech explaining his resignation to the assembled press corps.[48] Soon after this bizarre turn of events, Belichick was introduced as the Patriots' 12th full-time head coach, succeeding the recently fired Pete Carroll.[49] The Patriots had inquired to the Jets about permission to interview him for their vacant spot at head coach just prior to Parcells stepping down.[50] Parcells and the Jets claimed that Belichick was still under contract to the Jets, and demanded compensation from the Patriots. NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue agreed, and the Patriots gave the Jets a first-round draft pick in 2000 in exchange for the right to hire Belichick.[51] Soon after hiring Belichick, owner Robert Kraft gave him near-complete control over the team's football operations, making him the de facto general manager as well. Until 2009, Belichick split many of the duties normally held by a general manager on other clubs with player personnel director Scott Pioli, though Belichick had the final say on football matters.[52] Pioli left for the Kansas City Chiefs after the 2008 season.[53] The Patriots went 5–11 in the 2000 regular season and missed the playoffs.[54] In 2001, the Patriots went 11–5 in the regular season, and in the playoffs defeated the Oakland Raiders (in the \"Tuck Rule Game\") and Pittsburgh Steelers on the way to the Super Bowl.[55][56] In Super Bowl XXXVI, Belichick's defense held the St. Louis Rams' offense, which had averaged 31 points during the season, to 17 points, and the Patriots won on a last-second field goal by Adam Vinatieri.[57] The win was the first Super Bowl championship in Patriots history.[58] The following season (2002)—the first in Gillette Stadium—the Patriots went 9–7 and missed the playoffs.[59] New England finished with the same record as the New York Jets and the Miami Dolphins, but the Jets won the AFC East title as a result of the third tiebreaker (record among common opponents).[60] The Patriots' 2003 season started with a 31–0 loss to the Buffalo Bills in Week 1, a few days after they released team defensive captain Lawyer Milloy.[61][62] However, they dominated through the remainder of the season to finish 14–2, setting a new franchise record for wins in a season.[63] In the final week of the regular season, the Patriots avenged their loss to the Bills by the same 31–0 score.[64] They defeated the Tennessee Titans in the divisional round of the playoffs. Playing against the Indianapolis Colts and Co-MVP Peyton Manning in the AFC Championship Game (Steve McNair of the Titans was also Co-MVP), the Patriots recorded four interceptions, and advanced to Super Bowl XXXVIII, where they defeated the Carolina Panthers 32–29 on a late Adam Vinatieri field goal.[65][66] Belichick was awarded the NFL Coach of the Year Award. In 2004, the Patriots once again finished with a 14–2 record, and they defeated the Indianapolis Colts in the divisional round of the playoffs.[67][68] They opened the season at 6–0, which combined with the 15 straight wins to end the previous season, gave New England 21 consecutive victories to break the record for most wins in a row formerly held by the Miami Dolphins with 18 straight victories in the 1972 and 1973 seasons. They defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers in the AFC Championship Game. In Super Bowl XXXIX, the Patriots beat the Philadelphia Eagles and became only the second team to win three Super Bowls in four years.[69][70] Belichick is the only coach to accomplish the feat as the Dallas Cowboys had two head coaches in the stretch they won three of four from 1992 to 1995. With a new defensive coordinator in Eric Mangini and no named offensive coordinator, the Patriots went 10–6 in the 2005 season and defeated the Jacksonville Jaguars in the Wild Card Round before losing to the Denver Broncos in the Divisional Round.[71][72][73] Earlier, with a season-opening win over the Oakland Raiders, Belichick notched his 54th win with the Patriots, passing Mike Holovak as the winningest coach in Patriots history. The Patriots finished with a 12–4 record in the 2006 season and defeated the New York Jets by a score of 37–16 in the Wild Card Round.[74][75] They then beat the San Diego Chargers the next week in the Divisional Round, before losing to the eventual Super Bowl XLI champion Indianapolis Colts in the AFC Championship by a score of 38–34.[76][77] The Patriots led 21–3 midway through the second quarter, but the Colts mounted one of the great comebacks in playoff history.[78] In 2007, Belichick led the Patriots to the first perfect regular season since the introduction of the 16-game regular season schedule in 1978, only the fourth team to do so in National Football League history after the 1934[79] and 1942 Chicago Bears[80] and 1972 Miami Dolphins. In the Divisional Round of the playoffs, they defeated the Jacksonville Jaguars by a score of 31–20. In the AFC Championship, the Patriots defeated the San Diego Chargers by a score of 21–12. The Patriots were upset in Super Bowl XLII 17–14 by the New York Giants, his former team, due to the defense allowing a famous play to David Tyree near the end of regulation.[81] The Patriots' failure to attain a \"perfect season\" (undefeated and untied, including playoffs) preserved the Miami Dolphins as the sole team to do so, having finished their 1972 regular season at 14–0 and having won three games in the playoffs. Only two other teams in professional football have recorded a perfect season—the 1948 Cleveland Browns (14–0) of the then All-America Football Conference and the 1948 Calgary Stampeders (12–0) of the Canadian Football League. No team in the former American Football League ever had a perfect season. During the Patriots' 2008 season-opener against the Kansas City Chiefs, quarterback Tom Brady sustained a season-ending injury in the first quarter.[82] Backup quarterback Matt Cassel was named the starter for the remainder of the season. However, with a win in Week 2, the Patriots broke their own record for regular season wins in a row with 21 (2006–08). After losing over 12 players to the injured reserve list, including Rodney Harrison, Adalius Thomas, and Laurence Maroney, the Patriots still managed their league-leading eighth consecutive season with a winning record, going 11–5.[83] However, the Patriots, who finished second in the AFC East, missed the playoffs for the first time since 2002, losing on tiebreakers to the Miami Dolphins (who won the division on the fourth tiebreaker, better conference record) and the Baltimore Ravens (who beat out the Patriots for the last playoff spot due to a better conference record).[84] The 1985 Denver Broncos are the only other 11-win team to miss the playoffs in a 16-game season.[85] In 2009, with a fully healthy Tom Brady back as the starting quarterback, Belichick was able to guide the Patriots to yet another AFC East division title with a 10–6 record.[86] However, the Patriots lost to the Baltimore Ravens in the Wild Card Round.[87] In an incident dubbed \"Spygate\",[88] on September 9, 2007, NFL security caught a Patriots video assistant taping the New York Jets' defensive signals from the sidelines, which is not an approved location. The NFL rules state: \"No video recording devices of any kind are permitted to be in use in the coaches' booth, on the field, or in the locker room during the game.\" Jets coach Eric Mangini, a former Patriots assistant, tipped off league officials that the Patriots might have been filming their signals. After the game, the Jets formally complained to the league. On September 13, the NFL fined Belichick $500,000—the largest fine ever imposed on a coach in the league's 87-year history,[89] and fined the Patriots $250,000. Additionally, the Patriots forfeited their first-round draft pick in the 2008 NFL draft. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, a former employee of the Jets, said that he fined the Patriots as a team because Belichick exercises so much control over the Patriots' on-field operations that \"his actions and decisions are properly attributed to the club.\" Goodell considered suspending Belichick but decided that taking away draft picks would be more severe in the long run.[90] Gary Myers, a columnist for New York's Daily News columnist, stated Belichick should have been suspended by Goodell for the Patriots' next game against the Jets.[91] Belichick later issued the following statement: I accept full responsibility for the actions that led to tonight's ruling. Once again, I apologize to the Kraft family and every person directly or indirectly associated with the New England Patriots for the embarrassment, distraction and penalty my mistake caused. I also apologize to Patriots fans and would like to thank them for their support during the past few days and throughout my career. [...] As the Commissioner acknowledged, our use of sideline video had no impact on the outcome of last week's game. We have never used sideline video to obtain a competitive advantage while the game was in progress. [...] Part of my job as head coach is to ensure that our football operations are conducted in compliance of the league rules and all accepted interpretations of them. My interpretation of a rule in the Constitution and Bylaws was incorrect. [...] With tonight's resolution, I will not be offering any further comments on this matter. We are moving on with our preparations for Sunday's game. The sanctions against Belichick were the harshest imposed on a head coach in league history until the New Orleans Saints' Sean Payton was suspended for the entire 2012 season for covering up a scheme in which bounties were paid for deliberately knocking opponents out of games. Following the incident and its fallout, Belichick led the Patriots to a perfect 16–0 regular season record, and was awarded the 2007 NFL Coach of the Year Award, as voted on by the Associated Press.[92] In the 2010 season, Belichick and the Patriots finished with a 14–2 record for the top seed in the AFC.[93] However, their postseason ended quickly with a 28–21 loss to the New York Jets in the divisional round.[94] In the 2011 season, the Patriots topped the AFC with a 13–3 record.[95] Following a victory over the Denver Broncos in the divisional round of the playoffs, the Patriots won the AFC Championship game, beating the Baltimore Ravens 23–20 when the Ravens failed to score a touchdown and Baltimore's kicker, Billy Cundiff, missed a routine 32-yard field goal attempt to tie the game and send it into overtime.[96][97] This sent New England to their fifth Super Bowl under Belichick. In Super Bowl XLVI, the Patriots lost in the Super Bowl XLII rematch to the New York Giants by a score of 21–17.[98] On September 26, 2012, following a 31–30 loss to the Baltimore Ravens, Belichick was fined $50,000 for grabbing a replacement official's arm while asking for more specific clarity on a ruling after Baltimore had narrowly converted a last-second field goal attempt to secure the win.[99] The Patriots finished the 2012 regular season with a 12–4 record. In the divisional round of the playoffs, they defeated the Houston Texans by a score of 41–28 and made it to the AFC Championship Game, where they lost to the eventual Super Bowl XLVII champion Baltimore Ravens by a score of 28–13, ending their season.[100][101] The Patriots began the 2013 season with much upheaval on the offensive side of the ball with the injury of Rob Gronkowski, the arrest and subsequent release of Aaron Hernandez, the departures of Wes Welker to the Denver Broncos and Danny Woodhead to the San Diego Chargers in free agency, and the release of Brandon Lloyd. To replace them, the Patriots signed Danny Amendola in free agency, drafted rookies Aaron Dobson and Josh Boyce, and signed undrafted rookie free agent Kenbrell Thompkins. The team finished the season with a 12–4 record, winning the AFC East and securing a playoff berth and a first-round bye, seeding second in the AFC standings.[102] In the Divisional Round, they defeated the Indianapolis Colts by a score of 43–22.[103] They lost to the Denver Broncos in the AFC Championship Game by a score of 26–16.[104] In the 2014 season, Belichick's Patriots started 2–2. At a mid-week press conference following a 41–14 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs, Belichick famously uttered, \"We're on to Cincinnati\" (referring to the Patriots' next opponent), several times in response to follow-up questions and criticisms of his team, Brady in particular.[105] Ultimately, they recorded a 12–4 record for the third straight season.[106] In the Divisional Round, they defeated the Baltimore Ravens by a score of 35–31.[107] During the AFC Championship Game, they defeated the Indianapolis Colts by a score of 45–7.[108] They reached Super Bowl XLIX, where they defeated the Seattle Seahawks by a score of 28–24.[109] With his fourth championship as head coach, Belichick tied Chuck Noll for most Super Bowl wins by a head coach.[110] In the 2015 season, the Patriots recorded a 12–4 record for the fourth straight season.[111] They defeated the Kansas City Chiefs in the Divisional Round by a score of 27–20.[112] During the AFC Championship Game, the Patriots narrowly lost to the eventual Super Bowl 50 champion Denver Broncos by a score of 20–18.[113] In the 2016 season, the Patriots recorded a 14–2 record, which earned them the #1 seed for the AFC playoffs.[114] In the Divisional Round, they defeated the Houston Texans by a score of 34–16.[115] During the AFC Championship Game, they defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers by a score of 36–17.[116] They reached Super Bowl LI, where they defeated the Atlanta Falcons in a comeback victory by a score of 34–28 in overtime.[117] The Patriots were down 28–3 at one point in the third quarter.[118] With the victory, Belichick won his record fifth Super Bowl title as a head coach.[119] In the 2017 season, the Patriots went 13–3, setting an NFL record eighth consecutive 12-or-more-win seasons, capturing their ninth consecutive AFC East title and their 15th of the last 17 seasons. They defeated the Tennessee Titans in the Divisional Round by a score of 35–14 and the Jacksonville Jaguars in the AFC Championship Game by a score of 24–20, claiming their second consecutive AFC title, while also extending their record of consecutive AFC Championship Game appearances with seven.[120][121] Super Bowl LII was Belichick's eighth title game as head coach and his eleventh overall in any capacity, which was also the Patriots' tenth appearance, all extending NFL records. The Ringer wrote that Belichick's \"team is different from many of New England's famous teams from the previous decade: The first iteration of the Patriots dynasty relied on defense. This year, they are 29th in yards allowed (though fifth in points allowed) and instead have perfected the art of situational football.\" The latter Patriots teams were noted for mounting late comebacks in playoff games.[122][123] However, the Patriots fell to the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LII, 41–33, as Eagles quarterback Nick Foles repeated his dominant NFC Championship Game performance and led Philadelphia to victory in a high-scoring game. The Patriots were down early, as they had been in most of their Super Bowl wins. However, they could not make a comeback this time, although they came very close. Eagles defensive end Brandon Graham strip-sacked Tom Brady to get the ball back with about two minutes to go in the fourth quarter. The Patriots did get the ball again before the end of the game, but they ran out of time to score.[124] In the 2018 season, the Patriots went 11–5, failing to win 12 or more games for the first time since 2009. Despite this, they still captured their 10th consecutive AFC East title and their 16th of the last 18 years. They defeated the Los Angeles Chargers in the Divisional Round by a score of 41–28 and the Kansas City Chiefs during the AFC Championship Game 37–31 in a tough overtime game in Kansas City to advance to their third straight Super Bowl.[125][126] In Super Bowl LIII, the Patriots defeated the Los Angeles Rams 13–3 to give Belichick his sixth Super Bowl championship as a head coach and his eighth overall to have the most Super Bowl rings in NFL history. His six championships matched both George Halas and Curly Lambeau for most championships as a head coach. The Patriots' defense held the high-scoring Rams offense to only 260 total yards.[127][128] On May 13, 2019, Belichick announced that he would assume another role as the Patriots' defensive coordinator starting the 2019 season.[129] On October 27, 2019, with the Patriots' win over the Cleveland Browns, Belichick obtained his 300th win, regular and postseason combined, as a head coach.[130] The Patriots finished the 2019 regular season with a 12–4 record, winning their 11th consecutive AFC East title.[131] However, the Patriots were defeated in the Wild Card Round of the playoffs by the Tennessee Titans, led by former Patriots linebacker Mike Vrabel, by a score of 20–13.[132] Following the departure of Tom Brady to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Belichick and the Patriots were faced with an uncertain quarterback situation for the first time in nearly two decades.[133] During the offseason, the Patriots signed former Carolina Panthers starter Cam Newton for the 2020 NFL season.[134] The off-season routines and schedules, as well as the normal processes of regular season were severely disrupted by the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the unanticipated difficulties and challenges of the pandemic, the Patriots were in the hunt for a playoff spot until late in the season, ultimately finishing 7–9. The 2020 season was Belichick's first losing season since his first year in New England.[135] In the 2021 NFL draft, the Patriots selected quarterback Mac Jones with the 15th overall pick.[136] After Jones and Newton competed for the starting job during the preseason, Belichick made the decision to release Newton and name Jones the starter for the upcoming season.[137][138] During Week 4, Brady's Tampa Bay Buccaneers visited the Patriots in his first trip to Gillette Stadium since signing with the Buccaneers. A missed 56-yard field goal by Patriots kicker Nick Folk allowed Tampa Bay to narrowly escape with a 19–17 victory.[139] Immediately after the game, Brady and Belichick shared a quick embrace on the field before Brady greeted his former teammates and other members of the Patriots organization.[140] Though fans criticized Belichick for his lack of warmth displayed towards his former quarterback, the two privately spoke at length in the Buccaneers locker room following the match.[141] Belichick helped lead the Patriots to a 10–7 record in 2021. The team fell to the Buffalo Bills in the Wild Card Round by a score of 47–17.[142] In the 2022 season, despite starting quarterback Mac Jones being injured in Week 3 and subsequently missing three more weeks, the Patriots remained in the hunt for a playoff spot until the last week, finishing with a record of 8–9.[143][144] During Week 4 of the 2023 season, the Patriots lost to the Dallas Cowboys by a score of 38–3.[145] In doing so, Belichick suffered the worst loss of his coaching career (35 points).[146] The following week, the Patriots lost to the Saints by a score of 34–0, giving Belichick his worst home loss of his career.[147] Two weeks later, New England upset the Buffalo Bills 29–25 to earn Belichick his 300th career regular season win as an NFL head coach.[148] After a Week 10 10–6 loss to the Indianapolis Colts in Germany and subsequent bye week, Belichick named Bailey Zappe the team's starting quarterback.[149] In Belichick's final game with New England, the Patriots lost to the New York Jets 17–3, snapping the team's 15-game winning streak over the Jets. The Patriots finished the season with a 4–13 record, the team's worst in Belichick's 24 seasons as head coach.[150] On January 11, 2024, Belichick and the Patriots mutually agreed to part ways.[151] On January 15, Belichick was interviewed by the Atlanta Falcons for their head coaching position, but ultimately did not get the job as the Falcons hired Raheem Morris instead.[152] Under Belichick, the Patriots had a regular-season record of 266–121–0 over 24 seasons.[153] Belichick is the most successful coach in Patriots history; his 266 wins with the franchise are more than quadruple those of runner-up Mike Holovak.[154] Belichick also compiled a 30–12 record in the playoffs with New England, including a 6–3 record in Super Bowls. He led the Patriots to 17 divisional titles, including five consecutive titles from 2003 to 2007 and eleven consecutive titles from 2009 to 2019. This streak of 11 consecutive playoff appearances is the most in NFL history for any team.[155] While still serving as head coach for the Patriots in 2019, Belichick appeared as one of three main analysts, alongside host Rich Eisen and Cris Collinsworth, for the NFL 100 All-Time Team series on NFL Network, serving as a voter, in addition to providing his analysis of each member's significance and breaking down tape of highlight plays. Belichick was chosen in these roles due to his exceptional knowledge of American football, to the extent that he and fellow former head coach John Madden were specifically assigned to look over film of the earliest players selected to the team.[156] Belichick was awarded a Sports Emmy in 2021 for his contributions to the series.[157] After mutually parting ways with the Patriots in 2024, Belichick, while still declaring himself an active head coach, officially agreed to appear every Monday afternoon during the 2024 NFL season with ESPN's The Pat McAfee Show, first appearing as an analyst on the show during its \"5th Annual Draft Spectacular\", covering the 2024 NFL draft, following a guest appearance weeks prior.[158][159] \"I can't tell you the advantage to having a defensive coach to take the quarterback behind the ropes on that defense, it made me a better quarterback, so Bill's gonna do that. I think the audience is going to be fascinated at how smart he is. Look, you guys saw how witty he is. I watched the Draft show you guys did; it was awesome. He's quick-witted, he's funny and like I said, he's brilliant when it comes to defense and offense, the guy can flat-out coach.\"[160] –Peyton Manning on Belichick as an analyst, May 2024 Peyton Manning revealed during the Netflix special The Roast of Tom Brady that Belichick would join another ESPN program, joining the Manning brothers (Peyton and Eli) in the Manningcast, an alternate live television broadcast of Monday Night Football.[161] A week afterward, Manning stated during an appearance on The Pat McAfee Show that Belichick would appear on every Manningcast broadcast during the 2024 season.[160] Coaching record accurate as of final week of the 2023 NFL season.[162] Bill Belichick has worked under six head coaches: Twenty of Belichick's assistant coaches have become NFL or NCAA head coaches (not including interim tenures): During the offseason, Belichick visits other football programs to learn from their experiences. For example, he has studied the Navy run offense, sought Bill Walsh (in past years) to understand more about the San Francisco 49ers as an organization and the West Coast offense as a system,[190] and spent time with Jimmy Johnson to learn about drafting and contract negotiations.[191] The track record of Belichick's coaching tree has been characterized as poor. Former assistant coaches under Belichick had a combined 208–296–1 (.413) record as head coaches of their own teams through November 28, 2020, and a number of them ended their brief tenures as head coaches by being fired midseason.[192] As of the end of the 2020 season, the only members of this coaching tree to have career NFL head coaching records above .500 were former coaches Groh (9–7) and O'Brien (52–48 during season, 2–4 in playoffs).[193] Nick Saban and Belichick are good friends. In 2007, when Belichick spoke about their relationship, he said: \"Two successful Croats in the same division of NFL. You must admit, you don't see that every day.\"[194] In May 2018, President Donald Trump appointed Belichick to be a member of his Council on Sports, Fitness & Nutrition.[195] Belichick has an Alaskan Klee Kai dog named Nike.[196] Interest in the breed surged after Nike made an appearance on camera during the 2020 NFL draft.[197] Belichick has dual Croatian/American citizenship.[198] He received Croatian citizenship on June 3, 2024, in Banski dvori in Zagreb from the Croatian prime minister Andrej Plenković.[199] He was also special guest of the association football friendly match on Stadion Rujevica between Croatia and North Macedonia.[200] Belichick was married to Debby Clarke from 1977 to 2006.[201][202] They have three children. Their daughter Amanda played lacrosse at Wesleyan University, and she is the head women's lacrosse coach at the College of the Holy Cross in Massachusetts in July 2015.[203] Their son Stephen played lacrosse and football at Rutgers University, served as an assistant coach with the Patriots, and is currently the defensive coordinator for the University of Washington.[204] Their son Brian is an assistant coach with the Patriots.[205] Starting in 2007, Belichick was in a relationship with Linda Holliday, the executive director of the Bill Belichick Foundation.[206][207] The relationship ended in 2023. In June 2024, it was reported that Belichick was in a relationship with Jordon Hudson, who is a 24-year-old former cheerleader.[208] On January 10, 2021, Politico reported then-President Donald Trump planned to award Belichick the Presidential Medal of Freedom.[209] Belichick indicated that he was flattered to be considered for the honor, but declined the award in a statement issued the next day.[210] His statement referenced the January 6 United States Capitol attack, which the House of Representatives had accused Trump of provoking when it impeached for the second time of his presidency, and cited Belichick's \"great reverence for our nation's values, freedom and democracy\" in light of that event.[211][212] A number of Massachusetts politicians, including Senator Ed Markey and Representative Jim McGovern, had previously called on him to decline after news of the award became public.[213] # denotes interim head coach # denotes de facto general manager # denotes interim head coach # denotes de facto general manager",

                "content": "NEW! Find where to watch all of your favorite sports! Adam Schefter appears on \"SportsCenter\" to talk about Bill Belichick's intention to coach next year after interviewing with North Carolina. (1:05) Bill Belichick, who won six Super Bowl championships with the New England Patriots, has had discussions with North Carolina about the Tar Heels' head-coaching job, sources told ESPN on Thursday. Belichick, 72, has been out of football this year after leaving the Patriots following the 2023 season. Sources told ESPN that Belichick, who has spent his career in the NFL, wants to coach again and is open to listening to people at the college and NFL level. UNC fired Mack Brown on Nov. 26 after six seasons with the Tar Heels. The 73-year-old Brown, a College Football Hall of Famer, was in his second stint at the school. Belichick is only a year younger than Brown, who was the oldest coach in the FBS this season. The Tar Heels went 44-33 under Brown from 2019 to 2024 and finished 6-6 this season. Brown will not coach in UNC's bowl game, and Freddie Kitchens, a former Cleveland Browns coach who has served as UNC's run game coordinator and tight ends coach the past two seasons, is serving as interim head coach while the school seeks a replacement. Belichick is far and away the biggest name to surface in the North Carolina search, and sources said there was genuine interest on both sides. But Tulane's Jon Sumrall was also at or near the top of North Carolina's list and was expected to speak formally with school officials after the Green Wave's AAC championship game against Army on Friday. Other candidates for the job include Iowa State's Matt Campbell, Georgia defensive coordinator Glenn Schumann, and Steve Wilks, who was the Arizona Cardinals' head coach in 2018 and the Carolina Panthers' interim head coach in 2022. Wilks was a volunteer assistant this season at Charlotte. North Carolina had initially targeted Pittsburgh Steelers offensive coordinator Arthur Smith, a UNC graduate, but he declined the Tar Heels' overtures and instead wanted to remain in the NFL. During Belichick's hiatus from coaching, he has made the media rounds this season. He's a regular on the \"ManningCast\" during ESPN's \"Monday Night Football\" and \"The Pat McAfee Show\" on ESPN and also part of the \"Inside the NFL\" crew on the CW Network. Belichick was with the Patriots for 24 seasons. He was also a part of two Super Bowl-winning teams with the New York Giants as Bill Parcells' defensive coordinator. Belichick's 333 wins as a head coach are second all time in the NFL to Don Shula's 347. Although Belichick never has coached in college, his father, Steve, was a longtime assistant at the U.S. Naval Academy, and Belichick grew up in Annapolis, Maryland. InsideCarolina.com was the first to report that Belichick had interviewed with UNC. Information from ESPN's Adam Schefter was used in this report.",

                "content": "Editions: En/nfl The six-time Super Bowl champion head coach is 48 years older than his woman Former New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick \"couldn't care less\" about the 48 years between himself and his new girlfriend, Jordon Hudson, as he faces criticism that he's too old for the 24-year-old. Hudson met the six-time Super Bowl champion on a flight where they discussed psychology, and they remained in touch with each other afterwards, before reportedly beginning dating sometime in 2022. \"[Belichick] couldn't care less about the age difference because he appreciates Jordon for the woman that she is,\" a source told PageSix.com. \"Jordon is an old soul so she and Bill connect on a deep level. \"Age is just a number to them. [They] don't listen to the haters because their relationship is the real deal. [They] don't care what anybody thinks.\" Their relationship has largely remained out of the spotlight due to Belichick's forced sabbatical from the NFL when the Patriots axed him as their head coach and general manager after two decades in the role. Whilst he is listed as an active coach, he currently is not registered to any team and works as a pundit for FOX Sports and often collaborates with Pat McAfee. The 72-year-old recently made his red carpet debut with his beau as they attended The Museum Gala at New York City's American Museum of Natural History on December 5 and now an insider reports his passionate defense of her. The young woman and senior citizen have bonded over their shared love of football, as well as nature and the outdoor world and despite criticism, they are said to genuinely like each other. \"Bill was so proud to have Jordon by his side,\" the insider tells PageSix.com of the trip to the Museum. \"They have a genuine connection and mutual respect for one another. \"[They] connect on so many levels despite what some may think.

                "content": "Editions: En/nfl This is the first season since 1975 that Belichick is not working with an NFL team After decades of relentless focus on the NFL, with numerous accomplishments and records such as most Super Bowl wins (8) and most wins as a head coach (6), it appears that Bill Belichick, now 72, is finally enjoying some well-deserved downtime with his 24-year-old girlfriend, Jordon Isabella. He's also been making frequent appearances on shows like The Breakdown with Peyton Manning, The Pat McAfee Show, and ESPN's Monday Night Manningcast, because it seems that even when he doesn't want to, football will always be present in him, and as a fan, it's very enriching to listen to him. The 48-year age difference with his partner has been a topic of discussion, but it's something that doesn't bother Bill at all. A source told Page Six that the former head coach and general manager \"couldn't care less about the age difference\" because he appreciates Jordon for the woman she is. \"Jordon is an old soul, so she and Bill connect on a deep level,\" the source added. The couple reportedly began dating in 2022, Belichick's final season with the Patriots and likely the last of his highly successful NFL career that has seen him recognized as the greatest coach of all time. The truth is, Belichick is the greatest talent scout in history, so he knows what he's talking about. No, but really, all kidding aside, I think she's old enough to make her own decisions. Besides, from what they've been sharing on social media, like their red carpet debut at The Museum Gala at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, and the time they've been spending together, it's clear they're both enjoying their relationship. Throughout his career, Belichick has been criticized for being in the spotlight of the NFL's greatest dynasty. I don't think he's bothered by that criticism at all. Belichick's last seasons without Tom Brady haven't lived up to his legendary career, with the Patriots making just one playoff appearance in four years after Brady's departure in 2019. Frankly, at his age and with nothing left to prove, I wouldn't go back to coaching. However, it appears Belichick is considering it-but not in the NFL. Instead, he's reportedly in talks with the University of North Carolina to coach college football. It would be fascinating to see Belichick make this move. In fact, he recently told Pat McAfee, \"If I were in a college program, it would be a professional program at the college level. Based on what Belichick has already shown, I have no doubt that he would do a great job wherever he chooses to coach, although college football is obviously different from the professional level. What his arrival would undoubtedly create is a wave of young talent wanting to play for him, whether at North Carolina or wherever he chooses to go. The Tar Heels are best known for their basketball program, which produced Michael Jordan, but their football team is a regular participant in bowl games.

                "content": "Max Dorian Fried (/ˈfriːd/ FREED; born January 18, 1994) is an American professional baseball pitcher who is a free agent.[1] He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Atlanta Braves. Drafted in 2012 by the San Diego Padres in the first round, seventh overall, Fried made his major league debut in 2017. His 17 wins in 2019 were 2nd-most in the National League, and his seven wins in 2020 were again 2nd-most in the NL. Fried pitched 6 shut-out innings in the final game of the 2021 World Series against the Houston Astros, helping lead the Braves to their first World Series title in 26 years.[2] Through 2023, Fried had the best career win–loss percentage of all Braves pitchers, at .705. In 2020, Fried won the NL Gold Glove Award at pitcher and the Fielding Bible Award at pitcher. In 2021, he won the Gold Glove Award again, as well as the Silver Slugger Award for pitchers, becoming the third pitcher in MLB history to win both awards in the same year. He was also named to the All-MLB Team those two years. In 2022, he was named an All Star and won his third consecutive Gold Glove Award at pitcher. In 2024, he was again an All Star. Fried was born and grew up in Encino, California, the middle son of Carrie and Jonathan Fried, and is Jewish.[3][4][5] His younger brother Jake, also a pitcher, attended the University of Arizona.[6] Max began attending the Reggie Smith Baseball Academy in Encino, California, at the age of seven, and learned how to throw a curveball from the retired outfielder.[7] Fried pitched for the 2009 Maccabiah Games Team USA Juniors baseball team that won a gold medal in Israel.[8] Fried first attended Montclair College Preparatory School, in Van Nuys, Los Angeles, where he played baseball, football, and basketball.[9] As a sophomore, with Ethan Katz as his pitching coach, he was 10–3 with a 1.81 earned run average (ERA), and was named the Olympic League MVP and to the All-California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) Division V first team.[10][11][12] In his junior year Fried was 7–3 with a 1.31 ERA, with 100 strikeouts in 69 innings, as he also played outfield and batted .360 with four home runs and 30 RBIs.[13][14] He was named the 2011 Southern California Jewish Sports Hall of Fame Male High School Athlete of the Year.[11] After Montclair Prep cut its baseball team subsequent to his junior year, Fried then transferred to Harvard-Westlake School in Los Angeles, where he wore uniform number 32 in honor of Sandy Koufax and played with fellow future MLB pitchers Lucas Giolito and Jack Flaherty.[8] In 2012, his senior year, Fried was 8–2 with a 2.02 ERA, and 105 strikeouts in 66 innings.[15][16] He was a 2012 Rawlings-Perfect Game 1st Team All-American.[17] The San Diego Padres selected Fried in the first round with the seventh overall selection of the 2012 Major League Baseball draft.[18] Fried chose to sign with the Padres for $3 million despite his commitment to the UCLA Bruins baseball team.[3][19] Baseball America rated him the top left-hander available in the draft.[20] Fried made his professional debut for the Arizona League Padres in 2012 and spent the whole season there, going 0–1 with a 3.57 ERA in 17.2 innings pitched. He played for the Fort Wayne TinCaps in 2013 where he compiled a 6–7 record and 3.49 ERA in 23 starts. At the end of the year, Fried was ranked the 43rd-best prospect in the minors by MLBPipeline.[21] He was also named an MiLB.com Padres Organization All Star, and Baseball America ranked his curveball as the best in the Padres' minor league system.[22][23] In 2014, he was ranked the Padres' top pitching prospect, and their No. 2 prospect overall, by MLB.com.[22] Fried was injured for much of the year and did not make his season debut until July. The next month, on August 20, Fried underwent Tommy John surgery; he missed the remainder of the 2014 season.[21] On December 19, 2014, the Padres traded Fried, Jace Peterson, Dustin Peterson, and Mallex Smith to the Atlanta Braves in exchange for Justin Upton and Aaron Northcraft.[24] Fried missed the entire 2015 season while recovering from Tommy John surgery.[21] He returned to action on April 9, 2016, for the Rome Braves.[25] Fried spent all of 2016 with Rome, pitching to an 8–7 record and 3.93 ERA in 21 games (20 starts), striking out 112 batters in 103.0 innings. Fried ended the season ranked by Baseball America as the 6th-best prospect in the South Atlantic League.[26] His fastball, clocked at 93–94 mph, reached 96–97 mph in the second half of the season.[27] The Braves added Fried to their 40-man roster after the season.[28] Fried was invited to spring training for the first time at the start of the 2017 season.[29] He began the season at the Class AA level with the Mississippi Braves.[30][31] He was ranked as the Braves' No. 8 prospect overall by MLB.com in May, and the #89 prospect in minor league baseball in July.[32][33] Fried was named Southern League Pitcher of the Week for the week ending April 30.[34] Fried was called up to the Atlanta Braves on August 5, 2017.[35] He debuted on August 8, throwing two scoreless innings against the Philadelphia Phillies, displaying what David O'Brien of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution called \"a devastating curveball\".[36][37] Two weeks later, Fried returned to the minor leagues, joining the AAA Gwinnett Braves.[38] In 26 innings pitched for the Braves for the season, he was 1–1 with a 3.81 ERA.[39] At the end of the 2017 season, Fried joined the Peoria Javelinas of the Arizona Fall League, for whom he was named league Player of the Week on October 31.[40][41] He led the league with 32 strikeouts in 26 innings (3rd in the league), and was 3–1 with a 1.73 ERA (6th) in six starts.[42][43] He ranked first among starters with a .163 opponents' batting average, was second in fewest-baserunners-allowed-per-nine-innings (7.96), and was named to the AFL's Top Prospects Team.[42] Baseball America rated him # 3 on the AFL Hot Sheet.[44] In December, Braves manager Brian Snitker said that he might look at Fried, Lucas Sims, or another pitcher as the team's fifth starter in 2018.[45] Fried began the 2018 season with the AA Mississippi Braves. After one game, he joined the Gwinnett Stripers.[46] He was called up to Atlanta in April.[47] In 33.2 innings pitched for the Braves in the 2018 regular season, he was 1–4 with 44 strikeouts and a 2.94 ERA.[39] With runners in scoring position he kept batters to one hit in 30 at bats (.033); and with RISP and two outs, opposing batters were 0-for-14 with eight strikeouts.[1] Fried was placed in the bullpen at the start of the 2019 season, and later moved to the starting rotation.[48][49][50] In a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers on May 7, Fried was hit on his left hand by a ball hit by Alex Verdugo and left the game, but he made his next regularly scheduled start.[51][52][53] In 2019 Fried was 17–6 with a 4.02 ERA, as in 33 games (30 starts) he pitched 165.2 innings in which he struck out 173 batters.[39] His 17 wins were 2nd in the National League, and his .739 won-loss percentage was 5th in the league.[39] He induced the second-lowest percentage of fly balls (22.2%), and the third-highest percentage of ground balls (53.6%), of all NL pitchers, and threw his curveball 24.6% of the time (6th in the league).[54] His 9.398 strikeouts/9 IP were the 5th-highest in a single season of any Braves pitcher in history.[55] On defense, he led all NL pitchers in assists with 34, and had the 2nd-best range factor/9 innings pitched of 2.23.[39] He had a 6 Defensive Runs Saved (DRS) rating, the best in the major leagues among pitchers.[56] Fried also batted .196 (9th among NL pitchers)/.262 (6th)/.268 (10th), and led all NL pitchers with at least 50 plate appearances in runs (11) and BB/SO ratio (0.31), while having the 2nd-lowest swinging strike percentage (7.1%), 3rd in contact percentage (81.6%), and tying for 3rd in walks (5).[57] During the season Fried developed into the ace starting pitcher for the Braves.[58][59] In the pandemic-shortened 2020 regular season, Fried had a 7–0 win-loss record with a 2.25 ERA and a 1.09 WHIP.[60] He led the major leagues in won-loss percentage (1.000) and pickoffs (4), led the National League in WAR for pitchers (2.9), was 2nd in the NL in Wins Above Replacement-all behind Mookie Betts, and tied for 2nd in the NL in wins.[61][62] He held batters to an average exit velocity on batted balls of 83.4 mph, and hard-hit balls to 23.8%, both among the lowest 2% of all major league pitchers.[63] His four pickoffs through September 6 were the most in the majors in 2020, and he needed only 12 pickoff attempts to do so.[64] Since his major league debut in 2017, Fried's 14 pickoffs were the most in the majors, and he was successful on 19% of his attempts.[64] In that same time-span, pitchers in all of baseball had been successful in picking off runners in only 0.017% of attempts.[64] Fried started the season by becoming the first left-handed pitcher to not allow any home runs through eight starts, with his team winning every game, since Babe Ruth in 1917.[65] On defense, Fried led all major league pitchers in assists for the second consecutive season (with 15), tied for the MLB lead in pickoffs (with 4; with his 9 in 2019–20 he was tops in major league baseball), and led all pitchers with five Defensive Runs Saved.[66][67][68][69] Fried won the 2020 NL Gold Glove Award at pitcher.[70] He became the fourth Braves pitcher to win the award, joining Mike Hampton, Greg Maddux, and Phil Niekro, and the first Braves player to win the award for a pitcher in 17 years.[66][71] He also won the 2020 Fielding Bible Award at pitcher.[72] The award honors the top fielder in the Major Leagues at pitcher.[72] He came in fifth in voting for the 2020 NL Cy Young Award.[73] He was named a starter on the 2020 All-MLB First Team.[74] Fried was the Braves' 2021 Opening Day starting pitcher.[75][76] His first career complete game shutout was a Maddux, pitched against the Baltimore Orioles on August 20, 2021.[77][78] Fried threw a second Maddux on September 24, while facing the San Diego Padres.[79][80] His 1.76 ERA and 0.84 WHIP in the second half of the season were the best in the major leagues.[81] He was named the National League Pitcher of the Month for September, after posting a 1.54 ERA.[82][83] In the 2021 regular season, Fried was 14–7 with a 3.04 ERA (9th in the National League), and his 14 wins were 5th in the NL.[39] In 28 starts he threw 2 shutouts (leading the league), as in 165.2 innings he averaged 7.5 hits, 0.8 home runs (3rd), and 2.2 walks per 9 innings, for a 1.087 WHIP.[39] His 8.584 strikeouts/9 innings were the 11th-most in Braves history.[55] His 51.8% ground ball percentage was 3rd-highest in the NL, and he induced softly hit balls 20.0% of the time (5th).[84] As a batter, he hit .273/.322/.327. His batting average and on-base percentage led all pitchers, while his slugging percentage ranked second. He scored 7 runs (2nd), hit three doubles (2nd), and drove in 5 RBIs (6th) in 55 at bats, had the second-highest exit velocity of all pitchers (90.3 mph), had 8 sacrifice hits (8th of all players), and was called upon to pinch hit four times.[39][85] On July 4, 2021, he had a pinch-hit, walk-off, single against the Miami Marlins.[86] On defense, Fried led the league in range factor/game as a pitcher (1.61), in assists as a pitcher for the third consecutive season (37), and in Defensive Runs Saved for the third season in a row (6). For the second consecutive season he tied for the major league lead in pickoffs (6).[39] In the three years in which Fried was a starter, from 2019 to 2021, he led all National League pitchers in wins (38), was tied for the lead in shutouts (2), was 2nd in the vertical movement of his curveball (−11.6 inches; batters hit .183/.218/.294 against it), and had the third-lowest barrels percentage in balls hit against him (5.0%).[87] In those three years on offense he led NL pitchers in runs (18), doubles (7), on base percentage (.292), and WAR (1.3), was 2nd-lowest in strikeout percentage (25.8%), and third in batting average (.234), slugging percentage (.297), OPS (.589), and walks (9).[88] In those three years on defense he led all NL pitchers in assists (86).[89] Fried won the final game of the 2021 World Series with six shutout innings against the Astros, who had led the majors in batting average and runs for the season, with Houston's three-time batting champion Jose Altuve observing: \"He was almost unhittable.\"[90] Fried won the 2021 NL Gold Glove Award at pitcher, winning the award for the second year in a row.[91][92] He became the third Braves pitcher to win multiple Gold Glove Awards, joining Greg Maddux and Phil Niekro.[93] Major League managers and coaches (voting only within their league, and unable to vote for players on their own team), account for 75% of the selection process, while the other 25% is a sabermetric component.[94] Fried also won the 2021 NL Silver Slugger Award for pitchers.[95] The award was given to the top offensive player at pitcher in the NL, as determined by a vote by the manager and three coaches of each MLB team (and no manager/coach can vote for a player on his own team).[96][97] Fried became the third MLB pitcher in history to win both the Silver Slugger Award and the Gold Glove Award in the same season, joining Mike Hampton (2003) and Zack Greinke (2019).[98] Fried was the final recipient of the Silver Slugger Award for pitchers, as the National League permanently implemented the designated hitter in 2022. He was named a starter on the 2021 All-MLB Second Team, earning his second consecutive All-MLB selection.[99] Through 2021, of the Braves career leaders, Fried was second in win–loss percentage (.690; behind Russ Ortiz and ahead of Greg Maddux).[100] Fried was named to his second straight Opening Day start in 2022.[101][102][103] Fried's salary for the 2022 season was set at $6.85 million via arbitration.[104] He was named to the 2022 Major League Baseball All-Star Game roster at midseason.[105][106] For the season, Fried was 14–7 with a 2.48 ERA (3rd in the NL; 10th-lowest in Atlanta franchise history), in 30 starts in which he pitched 185.1 innings with 170 strikeouts.[107][108] He gave up the lowest percentage of hard-hit balls in the NL (24.5%) and had the lowest barrel-percentage against (4.0%), was 2nd in fewest walks/9 innings (1.55), 3rd in strikeouts/walk (5.31) and fewest home runs/9 innings (0.58), 4th in ground ball percentage (51.2%), and tied for 5th in highest LOB (78.2%).[109] His curveball had the highest vertical movement of those of all NL pitchers, the exit velocity of balls hit against him (86.2 mph) was the third-lowest in the NL, and batters swung at his pitches outside the strike zone 36.8% of the time, the fourth-highest rate in the NL.[110] In the four seasons from 2019 to 2022, he had the lowest barrel-percentage against (4.6%) of all major league pitchers, and his 52 wins were second in the major leagues only to the 56 wins of pitcher Gerrit Cole.[111] On defense, opponents became hesitant to run on him.[112] Since his major league debut in 2017, his 23 pickoffs lead major league baseball, with him having picked the runner off in 14.29% of his career pickoff attempts, a much higher percentage than the major league average of 1.6%.[113] Fried was named the 2022 NL Gold Glove Award winner at pitcher, his third straight Gold Glove Award.[112] He became the first Braves pitcher since Greg Maddux to win three straight Gold Glove Awards.[114] The only other pitchers who have won the award three times in a row have been Harvey Haddix, Bobby Shantz, Bob Gibson, Phil Niekro, and Zack Greinke.[115] Fried finished second in the voting for the 2022 NL Cy Young Award.[116] It was the second time in three years he finished in the top five in Cy Young Award voting, as he had finished fifth in 2020.[117] At the end of the 2022 season, Fried was selected to his third consecutive All-MLB team.[118] Fried's 2023 season salary of $13.5 million was again determined by the arbitration process.[119] As the Opening Day starter for the third straight year, Fried was removed in the fourth inning against the Washington Nationals.[120][121] He spent time on the 15-day injured list in early April and early May, first for a strained left hamstring, then a strained left forearm.[122][123][124] On June 5, Fried was transferred to the 60-day injured list.[125] He was activated on August 4.[126] In the 2023 regular season Fried was 8–1 with a 2.55 ERA (the second-lowest in the major leagues among pitchers with at least 14 starts), as in 14 starts he had one shutout, and struck out 80 batters while giving up 18 walks in 77.2 innings.[39] Batters hit .109 against his curveball.[63][1] Of NL pitchers who pitched 70 or more innings in 2023, he was 2nd in ground ball percentage (57.7%) and lowest hard-hit percentage (24.2%), 3rd in lowest barrel percentage (3.8%), 5th in ERA, 6th in left-on-base percentage (82.3%) and lowest average exit velocity (86.5 mph), 7th in lowest line drive percentage (16.8%), and 9th in home runs/9 innings (0.81).[127] He ended the season as the Braves' career leader in won-loss percentage (.705), second in strikeouts/9 innings pitched (8.835), fourth in strikeouts/walk (3.688), eighth in WHIP (1.163), and 10th in hits per nine innings pitched (8.075).[100] From the beginning of his first full season in 2019 to the end of the 2023 regular season, Fried recorded 60 wins, the most in the NL and second to Gerrit Cole's 71 victories during this time period.[128][100] His 25 pickoffs since debuting in 2017 were the most in major league baseball, and in his career he had picked off a runner in 14.5% of his pickoff attempts, much higher than the MLB average during that period of 1.7%.[1] Fried and the Braves agreed to a one-year $15 million contract for the 2024 season, his final season before free agency.[129][130] Fried's streak of Opening Day starts was ended by Spencer Strider.[131][132] In Fried's season debut, the second game of the year against the Philadelphia Phillies, he recorded only two outs.[133][134] On April 23, Fried pitched a complete game shutout against the Miami Marlins, facing 29 hitters and throwing 92 pitches for his third career Maddux.[135] He pitched a scoreless inning for the NL team in the All Star Game, the second of his career.[39] In 2024, Fried was 11–10 with one shutout in 29 starts covering 174.1 innings, in which he gave up 146 hits and 57 walks while striking out 166 batters, and led the NL in ground ball percentage (58.8%) while having the second-lowest exit velocity (86.3 mph) and percentage of \"hard

a .225 batting average (7th), while on defense he tied for the league lead with a 1.000 fielding percentage.[39][136] Fried received a qualifying offer from the Braves at the end of the season,[137][138] which he declined.[139] Fried throws a 94–96 mph four-seam fastball.[63] He also throws two types of a 74 mph \"plus\" curveball (which he patterned after that of Sandy Koufax), an 85 mph slider (since 2019), a 93 mph sinker, and an 86 mph change-up,[63][140][141] with the curveball resulting in the lowest batting average in 2021 (.160).[63]",

                "title": "Max Fried to sign with Yankees: New York picks up ace lefty on eight-year, $218 million deal - CBSSports.com",
                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. The New York Yankees have landed one of the top starting pitchers in baseball. Left-hander Max Fried and the ballclub have agreed to a eight-year contract worth $218 million, CBS Sports HQ has confirmed. The deal includes a full no-trade clause and does not have opt-outs or deferrals, according to the New York Post. The team has not yet announced the signing. The Yankees missed out on free-agent right fielder Juan Soto two days ago when he accepted a 15-year, $765 million deal from the Mets. As part of the pivot here to Plan B, Fried ends up in the Bronx. The deal makes him the best-paid left-handed pitcher in MLB history. Fried is the third core member of the Atlanta Braves' 2021 World Series championship team to leave as a free agent, joining Freddie Freeman and Dansby Swanson. Fried started and won the Game 6 title clincher against the Houston Astros, striking out six in six shutout innings in the decisive Game 6 at Minute Maid Park. Our R.J. Anderson ranked Fried the fifth-best free agent available this offseason, and the third best pitcher behind Corbin Burnes and Blake Snell. Here's his write-up: We wanted to print a complete list of left-handed starting pitchers with a better ERA+ than Fried since the beginning of the 2020 season, but we ran into a problem when we went to compile the names. You see, no sinister hurler who had a decent amount of innings (min. 200 combined) actually placed ahead of him in that metric. Oh well. Blame Fried's sustained excellence on his ability to manage contact. He ranked in the 95th percentile in average exit velocity last season, and he did it while generating nearly 60% ground balls for a second consecutive year. The biggest knock on Fried is his innings count, as he's cleared the 180-threshold just once in his career. Given the league's direction over the past decade, we're not inclined to think that'll hurt him. Fried, 31 in January, pitched to a 3.25 ERA in 29 starts and 174 ⅓ innings in 2024, and it was his worst season since 2019, his first full year as a big-leaguer. From 2020-23, Fried had a 2.66 ERA in close to 500 innings with the excellent underlying numbers to match. Simply put, he has been one of the game's best pitchers over the last half-decade. The Braves originally acquired Fried as a prospect in the Justin Upton trade with the San Diego Padres in December 2014. Because he declined the qualifying offer, Atlanta will receive a compensation draft pick after the fourth round for losing Fried. There remains plenty of offseason, but with Fried on board, the Yankees' rotation right now looks something like: Righty Marcus Stroman and lefty Nestor Cortes are also still on the roster and could provide depth here or serve as trade bait. The Yankees won the AL East and won the AL pennant last season despite Cole starting the year on the injured list. They got 32 starts from Rodón, 30 from Cortes, 29 from Stroman, 29 from Gil, 17 from Cole and 16 from Schmidt. If they can get full seasons from Cole, Fried and Schmidt, that rotation looks a lot better and it was already a good one in 2024. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

Sofronio Vasquez, who was a member of coach Michael Bublé’s team, won this season’s singing competition. It was the first win for Bublé - the only coach to have two team members in the top five. That other team member, Shye, was the runner up. Vasquez, 32, hails from Mindanao, Philippines, and thanked her coach prior to her win. “Your mentorship is a blessing to me, my family and to all the dreamers out there,” he told Bublé. “You have opened up so many doors.” The season’s other coaches were Snoop Dogg, Reba McEntire and Gwen Stefani. At the beginning of the competition, all four turned their chairs for a chance to score Vasquez for their teams after he gave an impressive audition of Mary J. Blige’s version of “I’m Going Down.” He performed “Unstoppable” by Sia and “A Million Dreams” from “The Greatest Showman” for the finals. Bublé shared video of the winning moment on social media, which showed Vasquez dropping to his knees tearfully after he was announced as the winner. The rest of the contestants and the coaches reacted joyfully, including Stefani, who could be seen twirling in a gown. © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

By Gil Kaufman Sofronio Vasquez is the winner of season 26 of The Voice. The Team Bublé singer gave coach Michael Bublé a win in his first season on the show on Tuesday night (Dec. 10) when the 31-year-old singer from the Philippines emerged as voters’ favorite following electric performances of Sia’s “Unstoppable” and The Greatest Showman showstopper “A Million Dreams.” Explore Explore Michael Bublé See latest videos, charts and news See latest videos, charts and news See latest videos, charts and news See latest videos, charts and news In addition to scoring a $100,000 payday and a record deal, Vasquez said the amazing mentorship provided by the “Spicy Margarita” singer was its own prize. “Your mentorship is a blessing to me, my family and to all the dreamers out there,” Vasquez told Bublé before the final results were read. In a rare double-down, Bublé was also the only coach to have two contestants make it into the top five, as well as boasting the top two finishers thanks to his other contestant, Shye, coming in as runner-up. Related These Were The 100 Most Played Artists at ADE 2024 12/10/2024 Bublé joins Kelly Clarkson, Niall Horan and John Legend as the fourth new coach to score a win in their first season on the show. In addition to beating out his teammate, Vasquez also bested Team Snoop’s Jeremy Beloate and Team Gwen’s Sydney Sterlace. Trending on Billboard “My Filipino brother, you are the hope of so many people… it has been such an unbelievable journey to be here with you,” Bublé told Vasquez — who moved to the U.S. in 2022 to chase his music dreams — before the singer was handed his hardware. According to an NBC bio, Sofronio grew up in the Philippines with no bed or indoor plumbing and “describes his upbringing as happy because music was always there to bring his family joy.” He loved singing for his late father, but thought a music career was out of reach, so he began to study dentistry, then decided to give music a chance while taking his dental boards. After his father’s sudden death, Sofronio moved to the U.S. to pursue music full-time, landing gigs at the famed Apollo Theater and racking up nearly 10 million Facebook views for his cover of Dionne Warwick’s “That’s What Friends Are For.” “I think if people understood the strength that you have and the fact that through all of this adversity, you walk out here on a night like tonight, when it probably matters more than anything has in your whole life career-wise,” Bublé added. “You walk out here in the moment and you take the brass ring and I’m just so happy for you.” It was a joy ride for Vasquez, who got a four-chair turn at the beginning of the season from coaches Bublé, Reba McEntire, Gwen Stefani and Snoop Dogg for his take on Mary J. Blige’s version of Rose Royce’s 1976 disco ballad “I’m Goin’ Down.” Along the way, Vasquez proved his versatility with covers of Elvis’ “If I Can Dream,” Jennifer Rush’s “The Power of Love,” Dusty Springfield’s “You Don’t Have to Say You Love Me,” as well as a killer take on Roy Orbison’s “Crying” during the playoff rounds. He also teamed up with his coach during Tuesday night’s finale for a cover of soulful cover of Smokey Robinson and the Miracles’ “Who’s Loving You.” After the confetti fell, Vasquez posted a picture on his Insta of himself with Bublé holding the trophy with the caption, “Dreams really do come true.” The 27th season of The Voice will premiere on Feb. 3 with Bublé returning alongside Kelsea Ballerini, Legend and returning coach Adam Levine.

The Dec. 10 finale of the 26th season of The Voice was a competition, but it was also a lovefest with every contestant giving some variation of “going after my dream.” At the very end, two of the singers coached by Michael Bublé stood side by side: Shye, the one-named 18-year-old woman from Bethlehem, PA., and Sofronio Vasquez, 32, from Utica, NY. The victor was the velvet-voiced Vasquez, who sang the 1969 Jackson 5 hit “Who’s Lovin’ You,” penned by Smokey Robinson, 84. At one point in the show, Vasquez, who grew up in poverty, confessed that he feared few in America would love him when he immigrated from his childhood home, the Philippines: “Being in America, I thought I would not be welcome.” But he was most welcome on NBC’s long-running hit reality competition show, right from the start. At the onset of the competition, the blind audition on Sept. 23, all four judges – Bublé, 49, Gwen Stefani, 55, Snoop Dogg, 53, and Reba McEntire, 69, turned their chairs around, meaning they hoped to be his coach. Vasquez was the odds-makers favorite, too, withTVLine.com touts giving him a 33 percent chance of winning and Shye a 27 percent chance. The other three – Sydney Sterlace (3rd), Danny Joseph (4th) and Jeremy Baloate (5th) – all had winning probability gauged in the teens or below. ARTICLE CONTINUES AFTER ADVERTISEMENT I was rooting for McEntire’s protégé, the bluesy, soulful, mustachioed English singer Danny Joseph, who made it into the finals via the show’s “Instant Save” sub-category competition. Joseph, who moved to the United States ten years ago, was the only singer who also played an instrument, an electric guitar. On the second night, doing a duet on “You Don’t Know Me” with McEntire, he admitted he didn’t know what to do with his hands sans guitar. Maybe that was one reason viewers didn’t take to him as I did. On X, Lil Peanut posted, “Sorry but Danny's voice is too gruff, gnarly, loud and sounds the same on all his songs, it's actually not that great.” So Joseph’s defeat and Vasquez’s victory pretty much played out as expected. But as Stefani told her chosen singer Sterlace before the winner was announced, “Winning doesn’t matter — you won.” That’s a reality show cliché, but she’s not wrong. Vasquez gets the big prize, $100,000 and a record deal from Universal Music Group, but the massive TV exposure could translate into a golden ticket to a big career for any of them. The season finale of The Voice may rightfully he considered the Super Bowl of TV talent contests, especially for AARP members — the median age for viewers is a tick under 65. The only scoring that counts in the finals comes from viewers’ online votes. The performances of the show’s contestants were augmented by guest appearances by Kelly Clarkson, whom host Carson Daly, 51, called “our own” (the first-season American Idol winner, she was a coach on The Voice, Seasons 14-21); Sting, 73, who dueted with Snoop on Michael Jackson’s “Another Part of Me”); Tears for Fears, who played a medley of their big hit, “Everybody Wants to Rule the World” and latest single, “The Girl That I Call Home;” last season’s winner Asher HaVon, who warbled a tearjerking tribute to coach McEntire; Myles Smith, who sang a soulful, ‘70s-rooted “Stargazing;” Season 24 winner Huntley, singing his current country-rocker “Skyline Drive;” and Ella Langley and Riley Green doing their wrenching country hit, “You Look Like You Love Me.” The best sketch with the hosts and contestants was by Bublé and McEntire, who goaded him into donning cowboy garb – bolo tie, kerchief, hats of different sizes – as the natty, coiffed Canadian pleaded, “I’m not a cowboy, I’ve never been dirty in my life!” Cue: Dirt toss from McEntire. He was asking for it! A mechanical bull ride did not go well for the ersatz cowboy, but served its comic purpose. AARP NEWSLETTERS %{ newsLetterPromoText }% %{ description }% Privacy Policy ARTICLE CONTINUES AFTER ADVERTISEMENT In some ways, The Voice is as much about the judges as it is their chosen protégés, and about the rapport they share. The judges all have the star power the contestants lack – that draws a portion of the audience in. All four judges were winners this season, showing both their vocal chops and comedic acumen. If there was a winner in the judges’ realm, it was certainly Bublé, not just for having coached the winning singer and the runner-up, but for his witty badinage and heartfelt warmth throughout. On Monday’s show, Bublé aptly praised Vasquez’s offstage nature – “sweet and humble” – and then said Vasquez apparently went into a phone booth and changed into a musical Superman. The best duet was Stefani and Sterlace’s heartfelt take on the 1971 hit “Wild World,” by Cat Stevens, 76. Stevens’ wrote the song to bid farewell to his long-ago girlfriend, model/actress Patti D’Arbanville, 73, who left him to make Andy Warhol movies in New York, warning her about the wild world out there. But on The Voice, it was about the warm feelings between Stefani and the 16-year-old Sterlace. The most resonant part came at the end, when Stefani sang, “I’ll always remember you like a child, girl,” and then the two shared the line. Runner-up moment: Bublé and Shye covering the 1967 hit by Frank Sinatra and Nancy Sinatra, 84, “Somethin’ Stupid.” Daly announced the judges for the Season 27. Bublé will return to defend his title, along with John Legend, 45, Kelsea Ballerini, 31, and Adam Levine, 45, tagged the “O.G. coach” by Daly. The average age of the coaches will fall from 56.5 to 42.5, which may annoy some AARP viewers. But I bet they’ll keep watching it anyway.

She served as an advisor and led the fundraising division of Donald Trump's 2020 presidential campaign. Guilfoyle studied at University of California, Davis, and the University of San Francisco School of Law, where she earned a J.D. degree. She became a prosecuting attorney in San Francisco and Los Angeles, California. She was an assistant district attorney in San Francisco from 2000 to 2004. From 2001 to 2006, she was married to Democratic politician Gavin Newsom, and was first lady of San Francisco during Newsom's first two years as mayor of that city. She is the former fiancée of Donald Trump Jr. Guilfoyle worked at Fox News from 2006 to 2018, and co-hosted The Five on the network.[2][3] She later joined America First Policies, a pro-Trump super PAC, to campaign for Republicans in the 2018 midterm elections.[4][5] On December 10, 2024, President Trump nominated her as the U.S. Ambassador to Greece. Guilfoyle was born in San Francisco on March 9, 1969. Her mother was Puerto Rican and her father was born in Ireland and immigrated to the United States at the age of 20. She was raised Catholic.[6] She grew up in the Mission District of San Francisco and in Westlake, Daly City.[7] Guilfoyle's mother, Mercedes, taught special education.

She received her Juris Doctor from the University of San Francisco School of Law in 1994. While in law school, she interned at the San Francisco district attorney's office. She also was a lingerie and fashion model, being featured in local department stores advertising campaigns (including for Macy's) and modeling Victoria's Secret lingerie for a bridal magazine.[13] She later studied at Trinity College Dublin in Ireland. While there, Guilfoyle published research in international children's rights and European Economic Community law.[14] After law school, Guilfoyle taught in a public school district[7] and briefly worked as a prosecutor in San Francisco. She lost her job in 1996 when Terence Hallinan was elected district attorney and fired 14 of the city's prosecutors.[15] Guilfoyle worked for four years in Los Angeles as a deputy district attorney, serving on adult and juvenile cases. She received several awards at the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office, including Prosecutor of the Month.[14] In 2000, Guilfoyle was rehired by Hallinan in the San Francisco District Attorney's Office, where she was an assistant district attorney from 2000 to 2004. During this time she obtained a conviction while co-prosecuting with James Hammer in the 2002 case People v. Noel and Knoller, a second-degree murder trial involving a dog mauling, which received international attention.[16][17] In 2003, by which time her then-husband Gavin Newsom was the front-running candidate in the 2003 San Francisco mayoral election, Guilfoyle publicly accused her fellow assistant DA Kamala Harris (who was running in the 2003 election for district attorney) of being unwelcoming towards Kimberly Guilfoyle. This accusation occurred years earlier during Guilfoyle's re-hiring at the San Francisco district attorney's office. Harris denied this accusation. Guilfoyle did provide positive comments on Harris' qualifications for office; she described Harris as someone that would \"work very hard\" if elected district attorney, as well as \"very smart\" and \"a good speaker\".[18] In 1995, Guilfoyle worked on the reelection campaign of district attorney Arlo Smith. Around this time, she was also a regular fixture at political fundraisers organized by oil billionaire Gordon Getty, whose son William she dated. (It is not publicly known what the timeline is on Guilfoyle's relationship with Billy Getty.[19])[13] In January 2004, Guilfoyle moved to New York to host the program Both Sides on Court TV. In addition, she worked as a legal analyst on Anderson Cooper 360°.[20] She joined Fox News in February 2006 as host of the weekend show The Lineup. This was eventually canceled. Guilfoyle remained a regular contributor for the network, and in 2011 was picked as co-host of The Five. She worked as a host on the show until 2018.[21] In 2014, she began hosting and then co-hosting Outnumbered for nearly fifty episodes, plus a few more appearances until June 2018.[22] Guilfoyle also appeared weekly on the recurring segment \"Is It Legal?\" on The O'Reilly Factor until that show was cancelled in 2017, and as a weekly Thursday guest on Brian Kilmeade's Kilmeade and Friends radio show.[14] Guilfoyle guest-hosted Hannity, On the Record, Justice with Judge Jeanine, and Fox & Friends.[23] In mid-2017, Guilfoyle signed a long-term contract extension with Fox.[24] A year later, in July 2018, Guilfoyle abruptly left Fox News;[25] she began working for a pro–Donald Trump super PAC.[26][27] HuffPost reported that, at the time of her departure, the network had been in the midst of a year-long investigation of a sexual harassment accusation against Guilfoyle. Network officials had given Guilfoyle an ultimatum: Resign by the end of July or be fired.[26] The New Yorker subsequently corroborated reports that Guilfoyle had been forced to resign rather than leaving by choice.[28] After Guilfoyle left, Fox News agreed to an out-of-court settlement with an assistant who had accused Guilfoyle of sexual harassment. Terms were not disclosed. The New Yorker reported that the settlement was at least $4 million.[28] The assistant alleged that Guilfoyle frequently displayed herself naked, showed photographs of the genitalia of men she had sex with, and required her to sleep over at Guilfoyle's apartment.[28] The New Yorker independently verified several of the assistant's allegations.[28] In 2015, Guilfoyle published a semi-autobiographical advice book published by HarperCollins, titled Making the Case: How to Be Your Own Best Advocate, on her experiences growing up, working as a prosecutor, and encouraging people to advocate for themselves.[29] In April 2024, Guilfoyle announced the upcoming publication of The Princess and her Pup, a children's book that she has authored.[30] Ten percent of its sales are slated to benefit an nonprofit dedicated to animal welfare.[31] In December 2016, it was reported that Guilfoyle was being considered for the position of press secretary for the 45th United States president Donald Trump. Sean Spicer was considered the front-runner for the position,[32] and was ultimately selected. On the May 12, 2017, edition of The Five, co-host Bob Beckel hinted that Guilfoyle turned the job down. In an interview with Bay Area News Group on May 15, 2017, Guilfoyle confirmed she was in contact with the White House about the position following Spicer's resignation. She said: \"I'm a patriot, and it would be an honor to serve the country. I think it'd be a fascinating job, it's a challenging job, and you need someone really determined and focused, a great communicator in there with deep knowledge to be able to handle that position.\"[33][34] On May 19, Guilfoyle said she was under contract with Fox, indicating she turned the White House down. One month later, she extended her contract with Fox.[35] In 2018, The Washington Post described Guilfoyle as a \"conservative cheerleader for President Trump\".[36] In 2019, Guilfoyle and Donald Trump Jr. jointly toured school campuses, invited by venues such as the University of Florida, where they were paid $50,000 for their appearance from student activity fees, which led to complaints by anti-Trump students. At the event, two people were arrested and five were injured. Two years earlier, white nationalist Richard B. Spencer had preceded them as an invited speaker, generating similar controversy.[37][38] In 2020, Guilfoyle was reported to be the chair of the finance committee of the Trump Victory Committee.[39] As of early 2020, the Trump campaign was secretly paying Guilfoyle $15,000 per month through the campaign manager's private company, Parscale Strategy. Guilfoyle served as a surrogate on the stump and took on broad advisory roles.[40][41] In the Trump 2020 campaign, Guilfoyle managed a fund-raising division. This division paid socialite Somers Farkas to raise money.[42] The fundraising division managed by Guilfoyle was in internal turmoil amid departures of experienced staff and accusations of irresponsible spending.[43] In November 2020, Politico's reporting alleged that Guilfoyle had engaged in sexually explicit conversations during private Trump fundraisers that had made some attendees uncomfortable. Politico reported that many campaign insiders alleged that this was part of severe human resources problems that plagued fundraising division, likely damaging the Trump campaign's ability to keep pace with the Biden campaign's fundraising.[44] At the Republican National Convention in August 2020, Guilfoyle gave a speech endorsing Trump that was widely described by some observers as unnecessarily loud,[45] or unhinged.[46][47] Others in media described it as passionate.[48] She was criticized for describing herself as a first-generation American when her mother was from Puerto Rico and thus an American citizen.[49] She is a first generation American on her father's side, as he immigrated to the United States from Ireland.[9] On January 6, 2021, Guilfoyle joined Trump, Trump Jr., Rudy Giuliani, Eric Trump, and others on the Ellipse in Washington, D.C., to address the \"Save America March\". This resulted in the attack on the Capitol.[50] Having raised millions of dollars to support the rally, Guilfoyle was also involved in organizing the protest at the Capitol.[51] She was paid $60,000 for her 2.5 minute rally speech.[52] Guilfoyle was featured in a video screened at the rally by Trump Jr., \"break[ing] into the hip-shaking dance she's been showcasing at other recent pro-Trump rallies\" and \"tell[ing] Trump fans: 'Have the courage to do the right thing! Fight!'\"[53] Guilfoyle served on the platform committee of the 2024 Republican National Convention.[54] Guilfoyle delivered a speech at the convention.[55] While delivered in a similar fashion to her derided 2020 convention speech, the 2024 convention featured a in-person audience that reacted receptively to her speech.[56] On December 10, 2024, President-elect Trump nominated Guilfoyle as the next United States Ambassador to Greece.[57] Early into her work as a prosecutor in San Francisco, Guilfoyle briefly dated William Getty, a scion of the Getty family.[13] In December 2001, Guilfoyle married politician Gavin Newsom, then a San Francisco city supervisor. Newsom was elected mayor of San Francisco in 2003. While married to Newsom, she used the name Kimberly Guilfoyle Newsom. The couple appeared in the September 2004 issue of Harper's Bazaar; the spread had them posed at the Getty Villa, and they were referred to in the title as the \"New Kennedys\".[58] In January 2005, citing the strain of a bicoastal marriage, Guilfoyle and Newsom jointly filed for divorce.[59] Their divorce was final on February 28, 2006.[60] It later emerged that Newsom, then 39, was having an affair with Ruby Rippey-Tourk, the wife of his then-campaign manager and former deputy chief of staff, Alex Tourk.[61] It is unclear if Guilfoyle knew about the affair before the scandal broke in 2007.[61] On May 27, 2006, in Barbados, Guilfoyle married furniture heir Eric Villency.[62] On October 4, 2006, Guilfoyle gave birth to their son,[63] Ronan.[64] Guilfoyle and Villency divorced in November 2009.[65] In June 2018, Vanessa Trump, who had filed for divorce from Donald Trump Jr. three months earlier, confirmed that Guilfoyle was dating Trump Jr.[66] In mid-2019, Guilfoyle and Trump Jr. jointly purchased a $4.4 million home in The Hamptons. They sold it in March 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic for $8.14 million.[67][68] Also in March 2021, the couple jointly purchased a $9.7 million home in Jupiter, Florida.[69] Guilfoyle and Trump became engaged on December 31, 2020. The news of the engagement was not made public until January 2022.[70] Since 2021, Guilfoyle and Trump Jr. have cohabitated in their Jupiter residence.[71] Guilfoyle's 2017 departure from Fox News was due to alleged sexual harassment on her part.[26][28] Fox News later reached a settlement of at least $4 million with Guilfoyle's accuser.[28] The assistant alleged that Guilfoyle frequently displayed herself naked, showed photographs of the genitalia of men she had sex with, and required her to sleep over at Guilfoyle's apartment.[28] The New Yorker independently verified several of the assistant's allegations.[28] Guilfoyle has also faced separate allegations of making sexually explicit comments at fundraisers. In 2004, it was reported that in speaking on behalf of then-husband, Gavin Newsom, at the Empire State Pride Agenda gay rights fundraiser, Guilfoyle boasted about his attractiveness and large penis size, and implied (through innuendo and pantomiming) that she was talented at providing oral sex. This was treated in San Francisco as a political controversy. Guilfoyle subsequently denied that her arm gestures were meant to be a sexually explicit pantomime.[72] In November 2020, Politico's reporting alleged that Guilfoyle had engaged in sexually explicit conversations during private Trump fundraisers that had made some attendees uncomfortable, including explicit conversations involving Trump Jr., disclosing at a fall 2018 fundraiser that Trump Jr. liked her to cosplay as a Dallas Cowboys cheerleader, making an offer at a December 2019 fundraiser to personally reward the event's top contributor with a lap dance, and offering at a 2020 fundraiser to host a hot tub party for its top contributor. A Trump campaign spokesperson denied this, asserting that \"in context\" nothing about her remarks at fundraisers had been offensive.[44]",

                "content": "US President-elect Donald Trump's appointments for his second term have followed a handful of themes. Many of them are long-time loyalists, or one-time Fox News hosts - or they are part of, or connected to, his extended family. Kimberly Guilfoyle, 55, ticks all three of those boxes. The former Fox host was nominated to be US ambassador to Greece on Tuesday. She is a fierce defender of Trump who has worked on behalf of his presidential campaigns. The one-time lawyer is also engaged to Donald Trump Jr, though tabloids have recently spotted the president's eldest son holding hands with another woman - making the current status of their relationship unclear. Ms Guilfoyle was previously married to Gavin Newsom, the governor of California and a member of the rival Democratic Party. Announcing her appointment, Trump Sr called Ms Guilfoyle a \"close friend and ally\". \"Her extensive experience and leadership in law, media, and politics along with her sharp intellect make her supremely qualified to represent the United States, and safeguard its interests abroad,\" Trump said. \"Kimberly is perfectly suited to foster strong bilateral relations with Greece, advancing our interests on issues ranging from defence cooperation to trade and economic innovation.\" Writing on social media herself, Ms Guilfoyle thanked Trump for the appointment, saying she was looking forward \"to delivering on the Trump agenda, supporting our Greek allies, and ushering in a new era of peace and prosperity\". Hers is one of the appointments that will require the confirmation of US senators. Before spending more than a decade at Fox, Ms Guilfoyle was a former San Francisco and Los Angeles prosecutor. After leaving the broadcaster, she joined the Trump campaign. Ms Guilfoyle's appointment marks the latest in a string of appointments for one-time or current Fox hosts or contributors. They include Pete Hegseth, the president-elect's nominee for defence secretary, Trump's transportation secretary nominee who once co-hosted a Fox show, and Janette Nesheiwat, Trump's pick for surgeon general. While the exact status of Ms Guilfoyle in the Trump family is not fully clear, she is not the first close connection who Trump has appointed to a top job. Charles Kushner - the father-in-law of Trump's daughter Ivanka - was appointed to be ambassador to France. While Massad Boulos - the father-in-law of Trump's other daughter Tiffany - was selected to be the president-elect's senior adviser for Arab and Middle Eastern affairs. Ms Guilfoyle and Trump's eldest son have been engaged since 2020. Neither she nor Donald Trump Jr have commented on their current relationship status in response to the latest tabloid speculation.

As a key witness of the events leading up to the Capitol insurrection — and a fundraiser for that rally's organizers — she testified before the House Jan. 6 panel in 2022. Guilfoyle is also the longtime partner of his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr. The two started dating in 2018 and got engaged in 2020. The status of their relationship is currently unclear, however. On Tuesday morning, hours before Trump's ambassador announcement, tabloid photos of Don Jr. holding hands with a Palm Beach socialite (also spotted in the family box at the RNC this summer) fueled rumors about a breakup. Trump Jr. said in a tweet that he was proud of Guilfoyle, writing that \"she loves America and she always has wanted to serve the country as an Ambassador.\" Guilfoyle said she accepts the nomination, a role that requires Senate confirmation. She wrote on social media that she looks forward to \"delivering on the Trump agenda, supporting our Greek allies, and ushering in a new era of peace and prosperity.\" \"It was the democratic values born in Greece that helped shape the founding of America,\" she wrote. \"And now, we have an opportunity to honor that history by bringing better days here at home and abroad.\" It's not uncommon for presidents to reward allies with ambassadorships. In fact, the American Foreign Service Association says it has been \"common practice for decades\" for presidents to fill roughly 30 percent of chief-of-mission positions with political allies, including wealthy donors, as opposed to choosing career foreign service members. Trump isn't the first president to pick relatives, in-laws included, for the job — or to face criticism for doing so. Guilfoyle's nomination is the latest drawn from Trump's extended family. Earlier this month, Trump named Massad Boulos — a billionaire, Lebanese American businessman and the father-in-law of his daughter Tiffany — as a senior adviser on Arab and Middle Eastern affairs. Boulos, who twice ran unsuccessfully for parliament in Lebanon, has longstanding ties to powerbrokers in that country. He most recently helped lead the Trump campaign's outreach efforts to Arab American communities in Michigan. His son Michael married Tiffany Trump at Mar-a-Lago in 2022. Trump chose another of his children's in-laws for an ambassadorship last month, saying he intends to nominate real estate mogul Charles Kushner — whom he pardoned from various federal charges during his first term — as the ambassador to France. Kushner is the father of Jared Kushner, the former White House senior adviser to Trump who is married to Trump's oldest daughter, Ivanka. It is not clear what if any official role Trump's children will play in his administration. Ivanka said after her father's reelection campaign announcement in 2022 that she did \"not plan to be involved in politics,\" choosing to focus on her family's private life. There is a long history of presidents tapping family members to serve in their administrations, starting with John Adams appointing his son, John Quincy Adams, as the minister to Prussia. A number of presidents kept relatives on the White House payroll throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, many as secretaries, aides or unofficial advisers, according to the National Constitution Center. They include James Madison, James Monroe, Andrew Jackson, John Tyler, James Buchanan, Zachary Taylor, Ulysses Grant, Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt and Dwight Eisenhower. In 1961, John F. Kennedy appointed his brother-in-law, R. Sargent Shriver, as the director of the Peace Corps. He also appointed his brother Robert Kennedy as U.S. attorney general, a position to which he was confirmed and served for three years. RFK's nomination was so controversial that it prompted the enactment of the Federal Anti-Nepotism Statute in 1967, nicknamed the \"Bobby Kennedy law.\" It forbids public officials from appointing relatives to a \"civilian position in the agency in which he is serving or over which he exercises jurisdiction or control.\" The measure has been tested several times, including when Bill Clinton tasked Hillary Clinton with leading a health reform task force in the '90s and when Trump named Kushner a senior advisor during his first term. Experts have disagreed over the years about how to interpret the statute, with many — including a federal judge ruling in the Clinton case in 1993 — maintaining that it doesn't apply to the presidency because the White House doesn't count as an \"agency.\" Copyright 2024 NPR",

After joining her family on the red carpet for the world premiere of Mufasa last night, Beyoncé posted a rare Instagram tribute dedicated to 12-year-old Blue Ivy. In the live-action Lion King prequel, Blue voices Kiara, the daughter of Beyoncé’s character, Nala. The Instagram post featured snaps of Blue on the red carpet as she posed in an incredible gilded gold ball gown, which included a draped strapless bodice and a voluminous skirt. “My gorgeous baby girl. This is your night,” the “Protector” singer wrote in the caption. “You worked hard and you did such a beautiful job as the voice of Kiara. Your family could not be prouder. Keep shining.” Blue wasn’t the only one walking the red carpet in gold last night. Tapping Balmain, Beyoncé coordinated with her daughter in a black strapless column studded with metallic gold polka dots made out of brass metal leaves. Other details included a plunging, sculptural neckline and a thigh-high leg slit. Accompanying the mother-and-daughter duo at last night’s event were Beyoncé’s husband, Jay-Z, and mother, Tina Knowles. While the rapper wore a dark brown suit, Knowles opted for an all-black outfit composed of an off-the-shoulder top, pants, and an ornate oversize belt. The foursome’s appearance comes amid allegations that Jay-Z raped a 13-year-old girl with rapper Sean “Diddy” Combs more than two decades ago. The lawsuit named Combs as the defendant in the original October filing, but it was refiled on Sunday to include Jay-Z. The anonymous plaintiff alleged that she was raped at a MTV Video Music Awards after party in 2000. Jay-Z has denied the allegations, accusing the plaintiff’s lawyer, Tony Buzbee, of threatening him with a “blackmail attempt” in order to “make me want to settle,” the musician said in a statement released by Roc Nation. The accusation comes amid a wave of sex trafficking and racketeering charges made against Combs, who is currently being held in a federal detention facility in Brooklyn following his arrest this past September. Combs, who has pled not guilty, will head to trial in May 2025. You Might Also Like 4 Investment-Worthy Skincare Finds From Sephora The 17 Best Retinol Creams Worth Adding to Your Skin Care Routine",

                "content": "The UEFA Champions League (abbreviated as UCL) is an annual club association football competition organised by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) that is contested by top-division European clubs. The competition begins with a round robin league phase to qualify for the double-legged knockout rounds, and a single-leg final. It is the most-watched club competition in the world and the third most-watched football competition overall, behind only the UEFA European Championship and the FIFA World Cup. It is one of the most prestigious football tournaments in the world and the most prestigious club competition in European football, played by the national league champions (and, for some nations, one or more runners-up) of their national associations. Introduced in 1955 as the Coupe des Clubs Champions Européens (French for European Champion Clubs' Cup), and commonly known as the European Cup, it was initially a straight knockout tournament open only to the champions of Europe's domestic leagues, with its winner reckoned as the European club champion. The competition took on its current name in 1992, adding a round-robin group stage in 1991 and allowing multiple entrants from certain countries since the 1997–98 season.[1] While only the winners of many of Europe's national leagues can enter the competition, the top 5 leagues by coefficient provide four teams each by default,[2] with a possibility for additional spots based on performance during the previous season.[3][4] Clubs that finish below the qualifying spots are eligible for the second-tier UEFA Europa League competition, and since 2021, for the third-tier UEFA Conference League.[5] In its present format, the Champions League begins in early July with three qualifying rounds and a play-off round, all played over two legs. The seven surviving teams enter the league phase, joining 29 teams qualified in advance. The 36 teams each play eight opponents, four home and four away. The 24 highest-ranked teams proceed to the knockout phase that culminates with the final match in late May or early June.[6] The winner of the Champions League automatically qualifies for the following year's Champions League, the UEFA Super Cup, the FIFA Intercontinental Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup.[7][8] Spanish clubs have the most victories (20 wins), followed by England (15 wins) and Italy (12 wins). England has the most winning teams, with six clubs having won the title. The competition has been won by 23 clubs and 13 of them have won it more than once.[9] Real Madrid is the most successful club in the tournament's history, having won it 15 times. Madrid is the only club to have won it five times in a row (the first five editions).[10] Only one club has won all of their matches in a single tournament en route to the tournament victory: Bayern Munich in the 2019–20 season.[11] Real Madrid is the current European champion, having beaten Borussia Dortmund 2–0 in the 2024 final for their fifteenth title. The first time the champions of two European leagues met was in what was nicknamed the 1895 World Championship, when English champions Sunderland beat Scottish champions Heart of Midlothian 5–3.[12] The first pan-European tournament was the Challenge Cup, a competition between clubs in the Austro-Hungarian Empire.[13] Three years later, in 1900, the champions of Belgium, Netherlands and Switzerland, which were the only existing leagues in continental Europe at the time, participated in the Coupe Van der Straeten Ponthoz, thus being dubbed as the \"club championship of the continent\" by the local newspapers.[14][15] The Mitropa Cup, a competition modelled after the Challenge Cup, was created in 1927, an idea of Austrian Hugo Meisl, and played between Central European clubs.[16] In 1930, the Coupe des Nations (French: Nations Cup), the first attempt to create a cup for national champion clubs of Europe, was played and organised by Swiss club Servette.[17] Held in Geneva, it brought together ten champions from across the continent. The tournament was won by Újpest of Hungary.[17] Latin European nations came together to form the Latin Cup in 1949.[18] After receiving reports from his journalists over the highly successful South American Championship of Champions of 1948, Gabriel Hanot, editor of L'Équipe, began proposing the creation of a continent-wide tournament.[19] In interviews, Jacques Ferran (one of the founders of the European Champions Cup, together with Gabriel Hanot),[20] said that the South American Championship of Champions was the inspiration for the European Champions Cup.[21] After Stan Cullis declared Wolverhampton Wanderers \"Champions of the World\" following a successful run of friendlies in the 1950s, in particular a 3–2 friendly victory against Budapest Honvéd, Hanot finally managed to convince UEFA to put into practice such a tournament.[1] It was conceived in Paris in 1955 as the European Champion Clubs' Cup.[1] The first European Cup took place during the 1955–56 season.[22][23] Sixteen teams participated (some by invitation): AC Milan (Italy), AGF Aarhus (Denmark), Anderlecht (Belgium), Djurgården (Sweden), Gwardia Warszawa (Poland), Hibernian (Scotland), Partizan (Yugoslavia), PSV Eindhoven (Netherlands), Rapid Wien (Austria), Real Madrid (Spain), Rot-Weiss Essen (West Germany), Saarbrücken (Saar), Servette (Switzerland), Sporting CP (Portugal), Reims (France) and Vörös Lobogó (Hungary).[22][23] The first European Cup match took place on 4 September 1955, and ended in a 3–3 draw between Sporting CP and Partizan.[22][23] The first goal in European Cup history was scored by João Baptista Martins of Sporting CP.[22][23] The inaugural final took place at the Parc des Princes between Stade de Reims and Real Madrid on 13 June 1956.[22][23][24] The Spanish squad came back from behind to win 4–3 thanks to goals from Alfredo Di Stéfano and Marquitos, as well as two goals from Héctor Rial.[22][23][24] Real Madrid successfully defended the trophy next season in their home stadium, the Santiago Bernabéu, against Fiorentina.[25][26] After a scoreless first half, Real Madrid scored twice in six minutes to defeat the Italians.[24][25][26] In 1958, Milan failed to capitalise after going ahead on the scoreline twice, only for Real Madrid to equalise.[27][28] The final, held in Heysel Stadium, went to extra time where Francisco Gento scored the game-winning goal to allow Real Madrid to retain the title for the third consecutive season.[24][27][28] In a rematch of the first final, Real Madrid faced Stade Reims at the Neckarstadion for the 1959 final, and won 2–0.[24][29][30] West German side Eintracht Frankfurt became the first team not to compete in the Latin cup to reach the European Cup final.[18][31][32] The 1960 final holds the record for the most goals scored, with Real Madrid beating Eintracht Frankfurt 7–3 at Hampden Park, courtesy of four goals by Ferenc Puskás and a hat-trick by Alfredo Di Stéfano.[24][31][32] This was Real Madrid's fifth consecutive title, a record that still stands today.[9] Real Madrid's reign ended in the 1960–61 season when bitter rivals Barcelona dethroned them in the first round.[33][34] Barcelona were defeated in the final by Portuguese side Benfica 3–2 at the Wankdorf Stadium.[33][34][35] Reinforced by Eusébio, Benfica defeated Real Madrid 5–3 at the Olympic Stadium in Amsterdam and kept the title for a second consecutive season.[35][36][37] Benfica wanted to repeat Real Madrid's successful run of the 1950s after reaching the showpiece event of the 1962–63 European Cup, but a brace from Brazilian-Italian José Altafini at Wembley gave the spoils to Milan, making the trophy leave the Iberian Peninsula for the first time ever.[38][39][40] Inter Milan beat an ageing Real Madrid 3–1 at the Ernst-Happel-Stadion to win the 1963–64 season and replicate their local-rival's success.[41][42][43] The title stayed in Milan for the third year in a row after Inter beat Benfica 1–0 at their home ground, the San Siro.[44][45][46] Under the leadership of Jock Stein, Scottish club Celtic beat Inter Milan 2–1 in the 1967 final to become the first British club to win the European Cup.[47][48] The Celtic players that day, all of whom were born within 30 miles (48 km) of Glasgow, subsequently became known as the \"Lisbon Lions\".[49] The 1967–68 season saw Manchester United become the first English team to win the European Cup, beating two-times winners Benfica 4–1 in the final.[50] This final came ten years after the Munich air disaster, which had claimed the lives of eight United players and left their manager, Matt Busby, fighting for his life.[51] In the 1968–69 season, Ajax became the first Dutch team to reach the European Cup final, but they were beaten 4–1 by Milan, who claimed their second European Cup, with Pierino Prati scoring a hat-trick.[52] The 1969–70 season saw the first Dutch winners of the competition. Feyenoord knocked out the defending champions, Milan in the second round,[53] before beating Celtic in the final.[54] In the 1970–71 season, Ajax won the title, beating Greek side Panathinaikos in the final.[55] the season saw a number of changes, with penalty shoot-outs being introduced, and the away goals rule being changed so that it would be used in all rounds except the final.[56] It was also the first time a Greek team reached the final, as well as the first season that Real Madrid failed to qualify, having finished sixth in La Liga the previous season.[57] Ajax went on to win the competition three years in row (1971 to 1973), which Bayern Munich emulated from 1974 to 1976, before Liverpool won their first two titles in 1977 and 1978.[58] The following seasons saw victories in 1978–79 and 1979–80 for Brian Clough's Nottingham Forest. The following year Liverpool won their third title before Aston Villa continued the sense of English dominance in 1982. In 1982–83, Hamburger SV broke the English dominance. Liverpool regained it in 1983–84 before losing to Juventus (1984–85); Steaua București then won in 1985–86, Porto in 1986–87, PSV Eindhoven in 1987–88; Milan (2), Red Star Belgrade and Barcelona became champions before the competition was re-formulated as the UEFA Champions League. All English clubs were banned for five years (Liverpool for six years) following the 1985 European Cup final due to the Heysel Stadium disaster. \"Magic...it's magic above all else. When you hear the anthem it captivates you straight away.\" The UEFA Champions League anthem, officially titled simply as \"Champions League\", was written by Tony Britten, and is an adaptation of George Frideric Handel's 1727 anthem Zadok the Priest (one of his Coronation Anthems).[60][61] UEFA commissioned Britten in 1992 to arrange an anthem, and the piece was performed by London's Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and sung by the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields.[60] Stating that \"the anthem is now almost as iconic as the trophy\", UEFA's official website adds it is \"known to set the hearts of many of the world's top footballers aflutter\".[60] The chorus contains the three official languages used by UEFA: English, German, and French.[62] The climactic moment is set to the exclamations 'Die Meister! Die Besten! Les Grandes Équipes! The Champions!'.[63] The anthem's chorus is played before each UEFA Champions League game as the two teams are lined up, as well as at the beginning and end of television broadcasts of the matches. In addition to the anthem, there is also entrance music, which contains parts of the anthem itself, which is played as teams enter the field.[64] The complete anthem is about three minutes long, and has two short verses and the chorus.[62] Special vocal versions have been performed live at the Champions League final with lyrics in other languages, changing over to the host nation's language for the chorus. These versions were performed by Andrea Bocelli (Italian; Rome 2009, Milan 2016 and Cardiff 2017), Juan Diego Flores (Spanish; Madrid 2010), All Angels (Wembley 2011), Jonas Kaufmann and David Garrett (Munich 2012) and Mariza (Lisbon 2014). In the 2013 final at Wembley, the chorus was played twice. In the 2018 and 2019 finals, held in Kyiv and Madrid respectively, the instrumental version of the chorus was played, by 2Cellos (2018) and Asturia Girls (2019).[65][66] In the 2023 final, held in Istanbul, Hungarian pianist Ádám György performed the piano version of the anthem.[67] The anthem has been released commercially in its original version on iTunes and Spotify with the title of Champions League Theme. In 2018, composer Hans Zimmer remixed the anthem with rapper Vince Staples for EA Sports' video game FIFA 19, with it also featuring in the game's reveal trailer.[68] In 1991, UEFA asked its commercial partner, Television Event and Media Marketing (TEAM), to help brand the Champions League. This resulted in the anthem, \"house colours\" of black and white or silver and a logo, and the \"starball\". The starball was created by Design Bridge, a London-based firm selected by TEAM after a competition.[69] TEAM gives particular attention to detail in how the colours and starball are depicted at matches. According to TEAM, \"Irrespective of whether you are a spectator in Moscow or Milan, you will always see the same stadium dressing materials, the same opening ceremony featuring the 'starball' centre circle ceremony, and hear the same UEFA Champions League Anthem\". Based on research it conducted, TEAM concluded that by 1999, \"the starball logo had achieved a recognition rate of 94 percent among fans\".[70] The UEFA Champions League used to begin with a double round-robin group stage of 32 teams until it evolved into a league phase of 36 teams, which is preceded by two qualification 'streams' for teams that do not receive direct entry to the tournament proper. The two streams are divided between teams qualified by virtue of being league champions, and those qualified by virtue of finishing second, third or fourth in their national championship. The number of teams that each association enters into the UEFA Champions League is based upon the UEFA coefficients of the member associations. These coefficients are generated by the results of clubs representing each association during the previous five Champions League, Europa League and Conference League seasons. The higher an association's coefficient, the more teams represent the association in the Champions League, and the fewer qualification rounds the association's teams must compete in. Five of the remaining seven qualifying places are granted to the winners of a four-round qualifying tournament between the remaining 43 or 44 national champions, within which those champions from associations with higher coefficients receive byes to later rounds. The other two are granted to the winners of a three-round qualifying tournament between ten and eleven clubs from the associations ranked 5–6 through 15, which have qualified based upon finishing second, third or fourth in their respective national league. In addition to sporting criteria, any club must be licensed by its national association to participate in the Champions League. To obtain a license, the club must meet certain stadium, infrastructure and finance requirements. In 2005–06, Liverpool and Artmedia Bratislava became the first teams to reach the Champions League group stage after playing in all three qualifying rounds. Real Madrid and Barcelona hold the record for the most appearances in the group stage, having qualified 25 times, followed by Porto and Bayern Munich on 24.[71] Between 1999 and 2008, no differentiation was made between champions and non-champions in qualification. The 16 top-ranked teams spread across the biggest domestic leagues qualified directly for the tournament group stage. Prior to this, three preliminary knockout qualifying rounds whittled down the remaining teams, with teams starting in different rounds. An exception to the usual European qualification system happened in 2005, after Liverpool won the Champions League the year before, but did not finish in a Champions League qualification place in the Premier League that season. UEFA gave special dispensation for Liverpool to enter the Champions League, giving England five qualifiers.[72] UEFA subsequently ruled that the defending champions qualify for the competition the following year regardless of their domestic league placing. However, for those leagues with four entrants in the Champions League, this meant that, if the Champions League winner fell outside of its domestic league's top four, it would qualify at the expense of the fourth-placed team in the league. Until 2015–16, no association could have more than four entrants in the Champions League.[73] In May 2012, Tottenham Hotspur finished fourth in the 2011–12 Premier League, two places ahead of Chelsea, but failed to qualify for the 2012–13 Champions League, after Chelsea won the 2012 final.[74] Tottenham were demoted to the 2012–13 UEFA Europa League.[74] In May 2013,[75] it was decided that, starting from the 2015–16 season (and continuing at least for the three-year cycle until the 2017–18 season), the winners of the previous season's UEFA Europa League would qualify for the UEFA Champions League, entering at least the play-off round, and entering the group stage if the berth reserved for the Champions League title holders was not used. The previous limit of a maximum of four teams per association was increased to five, meaning that a fourth-placed team from one of the top three ranked associations would only have to be moved to the Europa League if both the Champions League and Europa League winners came from that association and both finished outside the top four of their domestic league.[76] In 2007, Michel Platini, the UEFA president, had proposed taking one place from the three leagues with four entrants and allocating it to that nation's cup winners. This proposal was rejected in a vote at a UEFA Strategy Council meeting.[77] In the same meeting, however, it was agreed that the third-placed team in the top three leagues would receive automatic qualification for the group stage, rather than entry into the third qualifying round, while the fourth-placed team would enter the play-off round for non-champions, guaranteeing an opponent from one of the top 15 leagues in Europe. This was part of Platini's plan to increase the number of teams qualifying directly into the group stage, while simultaneously increasing the number of teams from lower-ranked nations in the group stage.[78] In 2012, Arsène Wenger referred to qualifying for the Champions League by finishing in the top four places in the Premier League as the \"4th Place Trophy\". The phrase was coined after a pre-match conference when he was questioned about Arsenal's lack of a trophy after exiting the FA Cup. He said \"The first trophy is to finish in the top four\".[79] At Arsenal's 2012 AGM, Wenger was also quoted as saying: \"For me there are five trophies every season: Premier League, Champions League, the third is to qualify for the Champions League...\"[80] Beginning with the 2024–25 season, UEFA changed the format of their three club competitions, abandoning the group stage in favour of an expanded league phase.[81] The number of participating teams was increased from 32 to 36 teams. Teams are no longer divided into groups of four teams each but are ranked in a single table. Each team plays eight matches against eight different opponents. For the draw of the league phase, teams are divided into four seeding pots according to their UEFA coefficient. Each team will play against two teams from each pot, one home and one away. The league phase is played from September to January, while the knockout phase begins in February, with matches predominantly played on Tuesday and Wednesday nights. After the league phase, a two-legged knockout play-off round is played between teams finishing 9–16 (seeded) and 17–24 (unseeded) in the league phase. Teams finishing in the top eight of the league phase receive a bye to the round of 16 as seeded teams, while the eight winning teams from the knockout play-off round will enter the round of 16 draw as unseeded teams. Teams finishing 25th–36th place in the league phase and the eight losers of the knockout play-offs are eliminated from the competition and from European football since it is no longer possible to enter the Europa League from the league phase onwards. After the round of 16 the competition follows the traditional knockout format with quarter-finals, semi-finals (both two legged and without association draw protection) and then the final at a venue chosen prior to the season. The final is typically held in late May or early June. Prior to the 2024–25 season, the tournament proper began with a group stage of 32 teams, divided into eight groups of four.[82] The draw to determine which teams entered each group was seeded based on each team's UEFA coefficient, and no group could contain more than one club from each association. Each team played six group stage games, meeting the other three teams in its group home and away in a round-robin format.[82] The first place team and the runners-up from each group then progressed to the next round. The third-placed teams entered the Europa League's knockout round and the fourth-placed teams were eliminated from the competition. For the next stage – the last 16 – the winning team from one group played against the runners-up from another group, but teams from the same association could not be drawn against each other (see random two-sided matching). From the quarter-finals onwards, the draw was entirely random, without association protection.[83] The group stage was played from September to December, whilst the knockout stage began in February, with matches usually played on Tuesday and Wednesday nights. The knockout ties were played in a two-legged format, with the exception of the final. In the 2019–20 season, due to the COVID-19 pandemic the tournament was suspended for five months. The format of the remainder of the tournament was temporarily amended as a result, with the quarter-finals and semi-finals being played as single match knockout ties at neutral venues in Lisbon, Portugal in the summer with the final taking place on 23 August 2020.[84] The following is the default access list. Changes will be made to the access list above if the Champions League or Europa League title holders qualify for the tournament via their domestic leagues. Each year, the winning team is presented with the European Champion Clubs' Cup, the current version of which has been awarded since 1967. From the 1968–69 season and prior to the 2008–09 season any team that won the Champions League three years in a row or five times overall was awarded the official trophy permanently.[86] Each time a club achieved this, a new official trophy had to be forged for the following season.[87] Five clubs own a version of the official trophy: Real Madrid, Ajax, Bayern Munich, Milan and Liverpool.[86] Since 2008, the official trophy has remained with UEFA and the clubs are awarded a replica.[86] The current trophy is 74 cm (29 in) tall and made of silver, weighing 11 kg (24 lb). It was designed by Jürg Stadelmann, a jeweller from Bern, Switzerland, after the original was given to Real Madrid in 1966 in recognition of their six titles to date, and cost 10,000 Swiss francs. As of the 2012–13 season, 40 gold medals are presented to the Champions League winners, and 40 silver medals to the runners-up.[88] Starting with the 2024–25 season, the distribution of the prize money is as follows.[89] A large part of the distributed revenue from the UEFA Champions League is linked to the \"market pool\", the distribution of which is determined by the value of the television market in each nation. For the 2019–20 season, Paris Saint-Germain, who were the runners-up, earned nearly €126.8 million in total, of which €101.3 million was prize money, compared with the €125.46 million earned by Bayern Munich, who won the tournament and were awarded €112.96 million in prize money.[90] Like the FIFA World Cup, the UEFA Champions League is sponsored by a group of multinational corporations, in contrast to the single main sponsor typically found in national top-flight leagues. When the Champions League was created in 1992, it was decided that a maximum of eight companies should be allowed to sponsor the event, with each corporation being allocated four advertising boards around the perimeter of the pitch, as well as logo placement at pre- and post-match interviews and a certain number of tickets to each match. This, combined with a deal to ensure tournament sponsors were given priority on television advertisements during matches, ensured that each of the tournament's main sponsors was given maximum exposure.[91] From the 2012–13 knockout phase, UEFA used LED advertising hoardings installed in knockout participant stadiums, including the final. From the 2015–16 season onwards, UEFA has used such hoardings from the play-off round until the final.[92] Since 2021, the UEFA also used Virtual Board Replacement (VBR) technology to offer region-based advertising; regional sponsors are inserted into the hoardings as shown on the broadcast feed in specific regions along with the global sponsors.[93][94] Individual clubs may wear jerseys with advertising. However, only two sponsorships are permitted per jersey in addition to that of the kit manufacturer, at the chest and the left sleeve.[95] Exceptions are made for non-profit organisations, which can feature on the front of the shirt, incorporated with the main sponsor or in place of it; or on the back, either below the squad number or on the collar area.[96] If a club plays a match in a nation where the relevant sponsorship category is restricted (such as France's alcohol advertising restriction), then they must remove that logo from their jerseys. For example, when Rangers played French side Auxerre in the 1996–97 Champions League, they wore the logo of the holiday chain Center Parcs instead of their primary sponsor, McEwan's Lager (both companies at the time were subsidiaries of Scottish & Newcastle).[97] The tournament's main sponsors for the 2024–27 cycle are: Adidas is a secondary sponsor and supplies the official match ball, while Macron supplies the referee kits.[107] The competition attracts an extensive television audience, not just in Europe, but throughout the world. The final of the tournament has been, in recent years, the most-watched annual sporting event in the world.[108] The final of the 2012–13 tournament had the competition's highest TV ratings to date, drawing approximately 360 million television viewers.[109] Notes Players that are still active in Europe are highlighted in boldface. The table below does not include appearances made in the qualification stage of the competition. Starting from the 2021–22 edition, UEFA introduced the UEFA Champions League Player of the Season award. The jury is composed of the coaches of the clubs that participated in the group stage of the competition, as well as 55 journalists selected by the European Sports Media (ESM) group, one from each UEFA member association. In the same season, UEFA also introduced the UEFA Champions League Young Player of the Season award.",

He gained his career breakthrough as a featured player in the sketch comedy show In Living Color from 1991 to 1994. Following this success, he was given his own sitcom, The Jamie Foxx Show, in which he starred, co-created and produced from 1996 to 2001. Foxx received acclaim for his portrayal of Ray Charles in the film Ray (2004), winning the Academy Award for Best Actor. That same year, he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role in the crime film Collateral. He gained further prominence for his film roles in Ali (2001), Jarhead (2005), Dreamgirls (2006), Miami Vice (2006), Horrible Bosses (2011), Django Unchained (2012), Annie (2014), Baby Driver (2017), and Soul (2020). He also played Electro in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014) and Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021) and Walter McMillian in Just Mercy (2019). Foxx also embarked on a successful career as an R&B singer in the 2000s. He earned two number-one singles on the Billboard Hot 100, with his features on the singles \"Slow Jamz\" by Twista alongside Kanye West, and \"Gold Digger\" by the former. His single \"Blame It\" won him the Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals. Four of his five studio albums have charted in the top ten of the U.S. Billboard 200: Unpredictable (2005), which topped the chart, Intuition (2008), Best Night of My Life (2010), and Hollywood: A Story of a Dozen Roses (2015). Since 2017, Foxx has served as the host and executive producer of the Fox game show Beat Shazam. In 2021, he wrote his autobiography Act Like You Got Some Sense. Born in Terrell, Texas,[5] Foxx is the son of Darrell Bishop (renamed Shahid Abdula following his conversion to Islam),[6] who sometimes worked as a stockbroker, and Louise Annette Talley Dixon. Shortly after his birth, Foxx was adopted and raised by his mother's adoptive parents, Esther[7] Marie (née Nelson), a domestic worker and nursery operator, and Mark Talley, a yard worker.[8][9] He has had little contact with his birth parents, who were not part of his upbringing.[10] He was raised in the black quarter of Terrell, which at the time was a racially segregated community.[10] He has often acknowledged his grandmother's influence as one of the greatest reasons for his success.[8][11] Foxx began playing the piano when he was five years old.[12] He had a strict Baptist upbringing[8][13] and as a teenager was a part-time pianist and choir leader in Terrell's New Hope Baptist Church.[10] His natural talent for telling jokes was already in evidence as a third grader, when his teacher used him as a reward: if the class behaved well, Foxx would tell them jokes. He attended Terrell High School, where he received top grades and played basketball and football (as quarterback). His ambition was to play for the Dallas Cowboys, and he was the first player in the school's history to pass for more than 1,000 yards.[10][14] He also sang in a band called Leather and Lace.[10] After high school, Foxx received a scholarship to United States International University, where he studied musical and performing arts composition.[10][15] Foxx first told jokes at a comedy club's open mic night in 1989, after accepting a girlfriend's dare. When he found that female comedians were often called first to perform, he chose the stage name of Jamie Foxx, which he felt was ambiguous enough to disallow any biases,[10][16] with his surname being a tribute to the black comedian Redd Foxx.[16] Foxx joined the cast of In Living Color in 1991, where his recurrent character Wanda also shared a name with Redd's friend and co-worker, LaWanda Page. Following a recurring role in the comedy-drama sitcom Roc,[17] Foxx went on to star in his own sitcom The Jamie Foxx Show, from 1996 to 2001, which he also co-created and produced through his company Foxx Hole Productions and was aired on the WB network. Foxx made his film debut in the 1992 comedy Toys. His first dramatic role came in Oliver Stone's 1999 film Any Given Sunday, where he was cast as a hard-partying quarterback,[8] partly because of his own football background.[8] During filming, Foxx fought with costar LL Cool J.[18][19] In 2001, Foxx starred opposite Will Smith in Michael Mann's biographical drama Ali. Three years later, Foxx played taxi driver Max Durocher in the Mann film Collateral alongside Tom Cruise, for which he received outstanding reviews. Critic Roger Ebert praised Foxx's performance, stating that, \"Jamie Foxx's work is a revelation. I've thought of him in terms of comedy (\"Booty Call,\" \"Breakin' all the Rules\"), but here he steps into a dramatic lead and is always convincing and involving\".[20] He went on to receive a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance.[8] In 1994, Foxx released an album (on the Fox record label) entitled Peep This, which was not commercially successful. In 2003, Foxx made a cameo in Benzino's music video for \"Would You\", which features LisaRaye McCoy and Mario Winans. In 2003, Foxx featured on the rapper Twista's song, \"Slow Jamz\", together with Kanye West, which reached No. 1 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 singles chart and #3 on the UK Singles chart. His second collaboration with Kanye West, \"Gold Digger,\" in which Foxx sang the Ray Charles-influenced \"I Got a Woman\" hook, then went straight to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, remaining there for 10 weeks. In 2005, Foxx featured on the single \"Georgia\" by Atlanta rappers Ludacris and Field Mob, which sampled Ray Charles' hit \"Georgia on My Mind\". Foxx would also portray Ray Charles in the biographical film Ray (2004), for which he won the Academy Award for Best Actor[8] and the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role. Foxx is the third male in history (after Barry Fitzgerald and Al Pacino) to receive two acting Oscar nominations in the same year for two different movies, Collateral and Ray. In 2005, Foxx was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.[21] Foxx released his second studio album, Unpredictable, in December 2005. It debuted at No. 2, selling 598,000 copies in its first week,[22] rising to No. 1 the following week and selling an additional 200,000 copies.[23] To date, the album has sold 1.98 million copies in the United States, and was certified double Platinum by the RIAA.[24][25] The album also charted on the UK Albums Chart, where it peaked at No. 9.[26] Foxx became the fourth artist to have both won an Academy Award for an acting role and to have achieved a No. 1 album in the U.S, joining Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby and Barbra Streisand. Foxx's first single from the album, the title track \"Unpredictable\" (featuring Ludacris), peaked in the Billboard Hot 100 Top 10 singles and also made the UK Top 20 singles chart; the track samples \"Wildflower\" by New Birth. The second U.S. single from the album was \"DJ Play a Love Song,\" which reunited Foxx with Twista. In the UK, the second single was \"Extravaganza\", which saw Foxx once again collaborate with Kanye West, although Foxx did not feature in the song's music video. At the 2006 BET Awards, Foxx won Best Duet/Collaboration with Kanye West for \"Gold Digger\" and tied with Mary J. Blige's \"Be Without You\" for Video of the Year. On December 8, 2006, Foxx received four Grammy Award nominations, which included Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals for Love Changes featuring Mary J. Blige, Best R&B Album for Unpredictable, Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group for Georgia by Ludacris & Field Mob featuring Jamie Foxx, and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration for Unpredictable featuring Ludacris. Following on from these successes, Foxx went on to appear in the box-office hits Jarhead, Miami Vice, and Dreamgirls, which lifted his profile even higher as a bankable star in Hollywood. 2007 brought him the lead role in the action thriller film The Kingdom opposite Chris Cooper, Jason Bateman, Jennifer Garner and Ashraf Barhom. In September 2007, Foxx was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame: \"[it was] one of the most amazing days of my life,\" said Foxx.[27] In April 2009, Foxx played the lead role in the dramatic film The Soloist. A few months later in October 2009, he played a starring role alongside Gerard Butler in the thriller Law Abiding Citizen. In 2007, his company FoxxKing Entertainment signed deals with MTV and VH1.[28] Foxx released his third album titled Intuition in 2008, featuring Kanye West, T.I., Ne-Yo, Lil' Kim and T-Pain. The album's first single, \"Just Like Me\" featuring T.I., was promoted by a video directed by Brett Ratner which featured an appearance by actress Taraji P. Henson. The second single \"Blame It\" featured T-Pain and became a top 5 single on the Billboard Hot 100 and a number-one single on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. The song received many accolades for Foxx, including a Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals at the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards. The \"Blame It\" music video, directed by Hype Williams, features cameo appearances by Forest Whitaker, Samuel L. Jackson, Ron Howard, Quincy Jones and his Jarhead co-star Jake Gyllenhaal, amongst others. Foxx's musical career has also included a number of collaborations. In 2007, he recorded the song \"She Goes All the Way\" with country superstars Rascal Flatts for their Still Feels Good album. Foxx performed backing vocals for artist/songwriter Tank. He featured alongside The-Dream on Plies' \"Please Excuse My Hands.\" He also appeared alongside Fabolous on the remix of Ne-Yo's \"Miss Independent\". Foxx collaborated with rapper The Game on the track \"Around the World\". Foxx also featured on T.I.'s single \"Live in the Sky\" from the album King. On January 22, 2007, Foxx launched The Foxxhole, a channel on Sirius Satellite Radio featuring talk-radio programs, stand-up comedy albums and music primarily by African-American performers, as well as much of Foxx's own material. Foxx's own talk-radio variety program The Jamie Foxx Show airs Friday evenings on The Foxxhole with guests including musicians, actors and fellow comedians; co-hosts have included Johnny Mack, Speedy, Claudia Jordan, The Poetess, Lewis Dix, Yvette Wilson, T.D.P and Tyrin Turner. On the April 17, 2009, episode of The Jamie Foxx Show, Foxx and his co-hosts made several sexually suggestive and disparaging jokes regarding the teenage singer Miley Cyrus.[29] Several days later Foxx issued a public apology on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno in response to growing public outcry and televised criticism by Cyrus's father, country singer Billy Ray Cyrus.[30] On April 6, 2009, Foxx, a longtime fan of country music, performed the George Strait song \"You Look So Good in Love\" at the George Strait Artist of the Decade All-Star Concert. Jamie Foxx hosted the 2009 BET Awards ceremony on June 28, 2009, which featured several tributes to pop star Michael Jackson, who had died three days prior to the show. As well as performing \"Blame It\" with T-Pain and \"She Got Her Own\" with Ne-Yo and Fabolous, Foxx opened the show with a rendition of Jackson's \"Beat It\" dance routine and closed the show with a cover of the Jackson 5's \"I'll Be There\" with Ne-Yo. \"We want to celebrate this black man. He belongs to us and we shared him with everybody else.\", said Foxx during the ceremony. In April 2011, Foxx voiced the cartoon canary Nico in the movie Rio. During the summer of 2011, Foxx was involved as a producer of In the Flow with Affion Crockett on Fox.[31] Foxx released his fourth album, Best Night of My Life, on December 21, 2010,[32] featuring the singles \"Winner\" (featuring Justin Timberlake and T.I.), \"Living Better Now\" (featuring rapper Rick Ross) and \"Fall for Your Type\" (featuring rapper Drake).[32] On October 7, the RCA Music Group announced that it was disbanding J Records along with Arista Records and Jive Records, meaning that all artists (including Foxx) previously signed to the three labels will release their future material on the RCA Records brand.[33][34] In 2011, Jamie Foxx also featured on the rapper Pitbull's album Planet Pit, in the song \"Where Do We Go\". In 2012, Foxx starred in the title role of the Quentin Tarantino written and directed Django Unchained.[35] Foxx starred alongside his Ray co-star Kerry Washington, as well as Christoph Waltz, Leonardo DiCaprio and Samuel L. Jackson. In an interview about Django Unchained, Foxx told Vibe magazine: \"As a black person it's always racial. ... when I get home my other homies are like how was your day? Well, I only had to be white for at least eight hours today, [or] I only had to be white for four hours.\"[36] The filming was emotional as Foxx said, \"It's tough shooting when you're in plantation row and that's where your ancestors were persecuted and killed.\"[37] On November 25, 2012, at BET's Soul Train Awards, Foxx joked: \"It's like church in here. First of all, giving honor to God and our lord and savior Barack Obama.\"[38] The joke led to condemnation from some Christians, to which Foxx responded: \"I'm a comic [and] sometimes I think people get a little too tight.\"[39] While hosting Saturday Night Live on December 8, 2012, to promote Django Unchained, Foxx joked about being excited \"to kill all the white people in the movie\".[40] Appearing at the 2013 NAACP Image Awards, Foxx praised the achievements of black people, saying that \"black people are the most talented people in the world\".[41] In 2013, Foxx was cast as President James Sawyer in White House Down alongside Channing Tatum.[42] The following year, Foxx appeared in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 as the villain Electro, and co-starred with Quvenzhané Wallis in Annie, Sony's Will Smith and Jay-Z produced update of the comic strip-turned-musical.[43] In 2017, Foxx starred as Bats, a trigger-happy gang member, in Edgar Wright's action film Baby Driver. Foxx's October 2014 Deja Vu duet with Dionne Warwick appears on the Feels So Good album released by Warwick. He released his fifth studio album, Hollywood: A Story of a Dozen Roses, on May 18, 2015. It debuted atop the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums charts and at No. 10 on the Billboard 200.[44] In 2015, Foxx's voice was featured in the chorus on the Ariana Grande song, \"Focus\".[45] Since its debut in 2017, Foxx has been the host and executive producer of the Fox game show Beat Shazam, whose premise is similar to the once-popular game show format Name That Tune. On the show, three sets of two partners try to beat the software application Shazam in correctly identifying the titles of popular songs for increasingly higher amounts of money, with one team eventually vying for a potential prize of $1 million. Foxx's daughter Corinne began co-hosting the show in its second season in 2018, replacing DJ October Gonzalez.[46] The show has aired four seasons so far.[47] Foxx co-executive produced the 2017 Showtime sitcom White Famous, which starred Jay Pharoah as a young aspiring African-American comic, and was based on Foxx's own early career. Foxx also occasionally appeared on the show as himself. White Famous got middling reviews and ratings, and was cancelled after one season.[48] On May 22, 2019, Foxx appeared as George Jefferson in Live in Front of a Studio Audience: Norman Lear's All in the Family and The Jeffersons on ABC.[49] That year, he played wrongly convicted death row prisoner Walter McMillian in the drama film Just Mercy, for which he received significant critical acclaim.[50] Foxx starred in Project Power, directed by Ariel Schulman and Henry Joost, opposite Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Dominique Fishback, which was released on August 14, 2020, by Netflix.[51][52] That September, Foxx signed an overall deal with Sony Pictures Entertainment.[53] Foxx then voiced the main character, jazz pianist and music teacher Joe Gardner, in the Pixar animated film Soul (2020).[54] Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Soul was released direct-to-streaming on Disney+ in most countries, including the United States,[55] though it did get a theatrical release in some countries.[56][57] USA Today's Brian Truitt commended Foxx's performance, saying he brought \"warmth, humor and an occasional touch of exasperation\" to the role.[58] Foxx co-created, executive produced and starred in the 2021 Netflix sitcom Dad Stop Embarrassing Me!, in which he played the single father of two teenage girls. The series marked Foxx's return to the sitcom format after The Jamie Foxx Show ended in 2001.[59] The entire eight-episode series premiered April 14, 2021, on Netflix. It was cancelled after one season.[60] He reprised his role as Electro in Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021), set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.[61] In 2021, Foxx released the memoir Act Like You Got Some Sense: And Other Things My Daughters Taught Me, which focused on his family life, both as a child and as an adult.[62] On May 29, 2018, Foxx was cast as Al Simmons in King Spawn, to be directed by Todd McFarlane.[63] In 2015, Foxx became attached to portray former boxer Mike Tyson in a biographical drama film Finding Mike; in 2020, he began to exercise in order to gain muscle for the role.[64] In 2021, the project turned into a miniseries, to be directed by Antoine Fuqua.[65] Foxx has two daughters: model, actress, and television producer Corinne Foxx, born in 1994;[10] and another daughter born in 2009.[66] Corinne made her formal debut at the Bal des débutantes in November 2014 and was named Miss Golden Globe 2016 on November 18, 2015.[67] In 2008, Foxx filmed a public service announcement for Do Something to promote food drives in local communities.[68] From 2013 to 2019, Foxx was rumored to be in a relationship with actress Katie Holmes.[69][70] On January 18, 2016, he rescued a young man from a burning vehicle that crashed outside his home. The driver, Brett Kyle, was driving his truck \"at a high rate of speed\" when it left the road, traveled into a drainage ditch, and rolled over several times. Kyle was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol.[71][72] On October 26, 2020, Foxx announced that his sister Deondra Dixon had died. She was 36 years old and had been born with Down syndrome. She had been an ambassador for the Global Down Syndrome Foundation.[73] On April 12, 2023, his daughter Corinne announced that he had been hospitalized after an unspecified medical emergency, but was recovering.[74][75] On May 12, amid conflicting reports about the nature of his condition, including rumors that he was gravely ill, Corinne said that her father had been \"out of the hospital for weeks, recuperating\".[76] He was reportedly treated in a \"physical rehab facility in Chicago\" that specializes in \"strokes and brain injuries\".[77] On July 22, Foxx posted a video clip commenting about his health, saying that he had been to \"hell and back\".[78][79][80] On December 3, 2023, he made his first public appearance since the hospitalization, to accept a Critics Choice Association's Vanguard Award. In his speech, he disclosed that he couldn't walk at first and discussed his recovery, without detailing exactly what led to his hospitalization.[81] Despite the news of his health challenges, he walked his daughter Corinne down the aisle in September 21, 2024 at his home in Thousand Oaks, California.[82][83] On December 10, 2024, Foxx revealed that he had a stroke that led to his hospitalization in April 2023 in his Netflix comedy special, Jamie Foxx: What Had Happened Was....[84] In April 2003, Foxx and his sister Deondra Dixon were confronted by security guards and had a physical struggle with police officers who arrested them at Harrah's casino in New Orleans. Employees said the Foxx party failed to show identification upon entry and \"started yelling profanities\" and fought with police officers after being told to leave.[85] Foxx's sister was subdued by pepper spray after breaking free while being handcuffed and then using the handcuffs to strike out at the police officers.[85] Two police officers were injured in the incident.[85] Originally charged with trespassing, disturbing the peace, battery on police officers, and resisting arrest, Foxx pleaded no contest to disturbing the peace in exchange for the other charges being dropped and was sentenced to a six-month suspended jail term with two years of probation and a $1,500 fine.[85][86] In November 2023, Foxx was sued by a woman who accused him of sexually assaulting her in 2015.[87][88] Fox has denied the alleged wrongdoing.[89] Foxx, Jamie, with Nick Chiles (2021).

Lacking any glamour above that required, a desperate Blancos side picked up a critical 3-2 Champions League victory on the road at in-form Atalanta, albeit one that potentially comes at a cost. Kyilan Mbappe got it started as he scored 10 minutes in, seeming to add another notch in the argument that he's possibly rediscovering his best form. Yet his high hopes were dashed on the half-hour mark as he was forced to exit with an injury, replaced by Rodrygo. MORE: The latest on Kylian Mbappe's hamstring injury suffered in the first half of the Atalanta win Atalanta scored on the stroke of halftime, further plummeting Madrid back into the darkness, but they would not be denied on the day. Vinicius Jr. scored with his first attempt on goal shortly after the restart, and just three minutes later Jude Bellingham had also found the net for a 3-1 lead. The hosts, winners of nine straight games, would not go quietly, as the prolific Ademola Lookman pulled them a goal back just past the hour mark. But their hard work in search of an equalizer would go unrewarded as Mateo Retegui agonizingly missed a sitter bang on the fulltime whistle.

MORE: Find out how to stream the Atalanta vs. Real Madrid match LIVE FULLTIME: Atalanta 2-3 Real Madrid Retegui's gut-wrenching miss is the final kick of the game, and it results not in a last-gasp equalizer for the hosts, but instead a much-needed three points for Real Madrid! An absolutely critical result for Real Madrid who needed that win in the worst way, pulling them away from the elimination zone. Unfortunately, it may have come at a cost as Kylian Mbappe's injury will worry the Madrid faithful amidst a season plagued by injuries. 90+3 min: Chance, Atalanta! HOW DID MATEO RETEGUI NOT SCORE?!?!?!? Ademola Lookman puts the ball on a platter just two yards from goal, an absolute SITTER for the Atalanta striker, but as he pokes his foot out to redirect the ball into the net, he bafflingly puts it over the bar! 90+2 mins: With four minutes of added time shown, Atalanta are pushing hard for an equalizer but becoming increasingly desperate. Vinicius Jr. goes down off the ball dramatically, and Odilon Koussounou tries to drag the Brazilian back to his feet knowing time is of the essence. It sparks a scuffle, and the Atalanta man is booked. Lucas Vazquez is also shown a yellow card for his part in the fracas, which means he will be suspended for the next Champions League match due to accumulation. 84th min: Carlo Ancelotti makes a double change as Dani Ceballos and Brahim Diaz exit. Entering are Luka Modrid and young Raul Asencio, the latter of whom is young and highly touted by Madrid fans, who have clamored for him to see the field more. Ceballos looks to be dealing with a fitness issue as he exits. Minutes later Jude Bellingham is yanked by Ancelotti in favor of Arda Guler. 80th min: Ederson is tripped by Federico Valverde who catches the Brazilian on the ankle on his way through, and the whistle is blown giving Atalanta a dangerous free-kick about 25 yards from goal in a central location. Standing over it is Lazar Samardzic, who takes the hit after a touch from Maarten de Roon, but it's weak and makes for an easy low save. 78th min: Inspired by the changes, Atalanta are back in the attacking third, but the spell of pressure ends with a thud as a potentially dangerous shot by substitute Lazar Samardzic takes a deflection on its way through and falls perfectly into the waiting arms of Thibaut Courtois. 75th min: Gasperini makes a triple change for Atalanta as Charles De Ketelaere, Raoul Bellanova, and Berat Djimsiti exit. Mateo Retegui, Davide Zappacosta, and Odilon Kossounou enter the match, bringing fresh legs. They're all straight, like-for-like swaps. Kossounou's entry appearing to potentially be forced as Djimsiti looks to have picked up a knock. 70th min: Chance, Real Madrid! Brahim Diaz fires a volley over the crossbar with a great chance to score! It's a shot with a high degree of difficulty, as he looks to redirect a looping ball on goal from about eight yards out, but he gets the angle wrong and blasts it into the crowd. Moments later, Marco Carnesecchi makes a save on Rodrygo who rips a right-footed effort from left of the penalty spot but places it far too close to the Atalanta goalkeeper. 65th min: GOAL! ATALANTA! The hosts aren't going away quietly, as Ademola Lookman strikes back as you knew he might! What a fabulous, exhilarating game this has turned into! Thibaut Courtois makes a great save to deny Raoul Bellanova on an initial effort, but as Atalanta recycle possession around to the left, Lookman scores an all-too-easy goal by cutting vertically on his left and slicing the ball inside the near post! VIDEO: Watch Lookman goal in USA | Watch in UK | Watch in Australia 59th min: GOAL! REAL MADRID! CHAMPIONS LEAGUE JUDE BELLINGHAM IS BACK! Real Madrid have awoken as Jude Bellingham gets his first UCL goal in his last 19 appearances! Again, it comes from a relatively harmless passage of play, as the England international receives a long ball down the right, but is never truly pressured by Maarten de Roon. Bellingham cuts inside on his left and cooly deposits a shot into the back of the net while falling over. Atalanta were in control of this game, but two moments of laziness have them staring at a two-goal deficit! VIDEO: Watch Bellingham goal in USA | Watch in Canada | Watch in UK | Watch in Australia 56th min: GOAL! REAL MADRID! REAL MADRID ARE BACK IN FRONT OUT OF NOTHING! Los Blancos had been far from inventive this half so far, but on a nothing through-ball which deflects off a defender, the ball lands perfectly in the path of Vinicius Jr, who gets past his man with a vertical run and slots it past the goalkeeper! VIDEO: Watch Vinicius Jr goal in USA | Watch in Canada | Watch in UK | Watch in Australia In the aftermath of the goal, Mario Pasalic is withdrawn as Atalanta's first substitute, replaced by Lazar Samardzic. 53rd min: Vinicius Jr. goes to ground in the penalty area under a tackle from Ederson, but the referee rightly waves play on, and there's not much protest from the Brazilian or his teammates. 2nd half kickoff: They're back under way with it all to play for in the second half. No changes for either team as far as personnel are concerned. HALFTIME: Atalanta 1-1 Real Madrid It was going so well early on for Real Madrid as they led on a 10th minute goal by Kylian Mbappe, but everything has fallen apart since then. Mbappe's gone off injured, and Real Madrid conceded just before the break. It had been coming, as Atalanta were the better side across the whole of the first half, especially the final 20 minutes before the break. More and more headaches for Carlo Ancelotti, who has run out of room for error in European play. 45+1 min: PENALTY, ATALANTA! Aurelien Tchouameni, filling in at center-back for Real Madrid, clips the heel of Sead Kolasinac as he makes a vertical charge on the ball, and the referee doesn't hesitate for a moment as he points towards the spot! Charles de Ketelaere steps up to take and...SCORES! GOAL, ATALANTA! The playmaker is on hand with aplomb, as he blasts a howitzer perfectly into the top-right corner! We're level on the stroke of halftime! VIDEO: Watch Atalanta goal in USA | Watch in Canada | Watch in UK | Watch in Australia Aurélien Tchouaméni clips Sead Kolašinac in the box and Charles De Ketelaere brings Atalanta level against Real Madrid 🔥 pic.twitter.com/HKDH7cC4Xj 40th min: Chance, Real Madrid! The visitors haven't had much in front of goal to savor since the opening goal, but Antonio Rudiger comes close with a headed chance from a deep Dani Ceballos delivery that was played across by Jude Bellingham! The defender puts it wide of the left post after Bellingham put it on a platter. 35th min: INJURY — Kylian Mbappe is down at midfield off the ball and needs medical treatment, sitting up on his rear as the trainers arrive. This is a real issue for Madrid, who have already had more than their fair share of injury issues this season... He walks off under his own power after a very short conversation, and has a chat with Carlo Ancelotti. He then goes straight to the Madrid bench, and is going to come off. It's hard to tell exactly what happened or what the problem is, but it's an immediate and significant concern for Los Blancos. Rodrygo comes in to replace the Frenchman, as the mood around the game dampens significantly. 31st min: Ademola Lookman, unsurprisingly Atalanta's most dangerous forward so far, has a go from just outside the top-left corner of the penalty area, but blasts his shot wildly and it flies well wide of the far post. Not a good look on goal from that position. 28th min: Atalanta have completely controlled the last 10 minutes or so, and have managed to keep the ball in the attacking third for quite a long time. They're struggling, however, to deal with the Madrid physicality, which at the moment is keeping the hosts from really testing Thibaut Courtois. Ademola Lookman pushes off the back of a defender to create space to receive a big switch, which draws a foul and an end to their possession. 21st min: Chance, Atalanta! YOU HAVE TO BE KIDDING ME! TCHOUAMENI DOES IT AGAIN! ANOTHER big block to keep Ederson from testing Courtois! This time, the Frenchman sticks his leg out to put his foot expertly in the line of the Brazilian's shot. 20th min: Chance, Atalanta! Another big block from Real Madrid, this time by Antonio Rudiger, who gets a touch on a Charles De Ketelaere shot which slows the ball considerably and makes the ball easy for Thibaut Courtois to collect! The hosts look very dangerous but they can't find a way through the trees. 17th min: Chance, Atalanta! Brahim Diaz is exceptionally lucky not to be booked by Polish referee Szymon Marciniak as he chops down an Atalanta player in transition but is not punished more than a common foul. Atalanta take the free-kick quickly, and they produce a quality opportunity as they move forward quickly but there's another big block from a Madrid defender to prevent the entry pass to the front of goal. This game is breathless! 14th min: Chance, Real Madrid! Real Madrid break ferociously from the Lookman chance, and Kylian Mbappe forces a wonderful save by Marco Carnesecchi! 14th min: Chance, Atalanta! Aurelien Tchouameni makes a last-gasp block to prevent Ademola Lookman from putting a dangerous shot on frame! It's a fabulous effort from Tchouameni who likely prevents an immediate response! 10th min: GOAL! REAL MADRID! KYLIAN MBAPPE HAS ARRIVED! Receiving a pass from Brahim Diaz at the top of the penalty area with his back to goal, the Frenchman produces a sensational first touch to spin around his baffled defender and finish easily past the goalkeeper! It's Mbappe's second Champions League goal for Real Madrid, and first since their opener against Stuttgart in mid-September! VIDEO: Watch Mbappe goal in USA | Watch in Canada | Watch in UK | Watch in Australia 🔥 @KMbappe 🔥 #UCL pic.twitter.com/M83GpCQWnT 8th min: Real Madrid had controlled the early portion of this match, with Brahim Diaz looking incisive, but Atalanta have managed to work a response and now are enjoying a spell of attacking possession themselves. A lively start to this match. 2nd min: Chance, Real Madrid! Kylian Mbappe is clean through on goal from a tight angle on the right, but Marco Carnesecchi makes a great save by closing down the shooting space! Kickoff: They're under way in Bergamo! Both sides have a lot to play for — Atalanta are on the cusp of a top eight position and would be considered contenders for a famous win, while Real Madrid are hoping just to avoid dropping further into elimination danger. 15 mins to kickoff: Having Thibaut Courtois back in goal for Real Madrid has been important. Two of their three Champions League defeats came in his absence, although it's hard to truly blame Andriy Lunin for those, since Madrid scored a combined one goal over those two games). 🧤 @thibautcourtois 🧤#UCL pic.twitter.com/Mnj6MtGZx3 30 mins to kickoff: Jude Bellingham exploded to life at Real Madrid last season, scoring in his first four UCL matches with the club, but has been quiet since in European play. His 18 shots across his goal drought have been worth 2.3 total xG, meaning he's due for a strike. They could use him today to rescue their European standing. 12 - Jude Bellingham hasn’t scored in any of his last 12 appearances in the UEFA Champions League for Real Madrid, having netted in each of his first four for the club (four goals). Bellingham has attempted 18 shots across these 12 games (2.3 xG). Necessary. pic.twitter.com/tDreUVV0D3 45 mins to kickoff: The new Champions League format was crafted in part to give big clubs more room for error in reaching the knockout stage, but the likes of PSG and Real Madrid have still struggled to put their best foot forward and are at risk of elimination. The CBS Sports crew discussed the new format in their pregame show broadcast in the United States. Their studio show is always a blast, before during and after matches, and has gained notoriety for its perfect balance of analysis and nonsense. For example, CBS sent Micah Richards and Alessandro Del Piero on site in Bergamo, and apparently Micah Richards had a haircut snafu which gave the crew a laugh. Del Piero said they have enjoyed the wine and food in Italy, as you do. The new #UCL format has caused some shocking results for big teams 👀@kate_scott, Thierry Henry, @Carra23 and @clint_dempsey talk Real Madrid and PSG's campaigns so far ⬇️ pic.twitter.com/LwTl28Lhv2 1 hour to kickoff: The Atalanta lineup is now available, and it's as expected with a traditional back three from Gian Piero Gasperini. The chemistry between Ademola Lookman and Charles De Ketelaere has been brilliant this season, and we tipped the two will combine yet again against an out-of-form Real Madrid back line. MORE: See our full rundown of predictions, best bets, and props for today's match by clicking here. 1 hour 15 mins to kick: Atalanta's incredible recent form is even more stark when compared to that of Real Madrid, who have not stood on business against opposition they'd be expected to handle. They have three defeats in five Champions League games to the likes of Lille, AC Milan, and Liverpool, while they've lost to Athletic Club last time out in league play. It's been a trying campaign for Carlo Ancelotti, and Los Blancos can ill afford yet another adverse result in European play. They currently occupy the final qualifying spot in the standings with just three matches to go, and defeat here could leave them in an elimination position. Could the defending champions, the most successful European club, really be bounced in the league phase? 1 hour 30 mins to kick: The recent form of Atalanta is something to behold. They are unbeaten in 14 straight matches across all competitions, including wins in nine straight. While many of those games came against opponents they'd be expected to beat, there are victories over AC Milan and Napoli in that stretch, and the consistency is something many top European clubs would be envious of. They sit top of the Serie A table and fifth in the Champions League standings. Can they really keep this up across a long season? Gian Piero Gasperini certainly deserves a season such as this, especially after winning last year's Europa League title! Atalanta are top of Serie A, fifth in the UCL table, and unbeaten in 14 games since September.They’ve beaten the likes of Napoli, Roma, and AC Milan and drew against Arsenal this season.They're in great form entering today's match vs. Real Madrid 🔥 pic.twitter.com/dNVMErtElR 1 hour 45 mins to kick: In typical Real Madrid fashion, Carlo Ancelotti's starting lineup has already been made public, and there are a few talking points. First, while Vinicius Jr. returns to the starting lineup after a short spell out with injury, fellow Brazilian Rodrygo is not fit enough to make the XI, with Brahim Diaz in there instead. Additionally, it's Dani Ceballos in midfield instead of Luka Modric, with Eduardo Camavinga still out injured. There are three youth players on the bench for Madrid, thanks to their hefty injury load. 19-year-old left-back Youssef Enriquez, a Spain youth international who has also appeared for Morocco's youth side, is amongst the substitutes, while young midfielder Chema Andres is also available alongside Sergio Mestre. 2 hours to kickoff: Carlo Ancelotti had a humorous moment in his pre-match press conference before this game. There's been a lot of talk about Kylian Mbappe's fit at Real Madrid since joining in the summer, but a couple goals in his last few matches have quieted that for now. Apparently, Ancelotti's not quite used to talking about other topics, and joked at the end of the presser that it might be the first time all year he didn't field a single question about Mbappe! 🤣 La frase de Ancelotti sobre Mbappé que puso a los 100 de la sala de prensa a carcajada limpia#UCL pic.twitter.com/YfDSg9W2UZ This Champions League match kicks off from Gewiss Stadium on Tuesday, December 10 at 9 p.m. local time in Bergamo, Italy. Here's how that time translates across some of the major territories around the globe: Mateo Retegui started from the bench in Atalanta's win over AC Milan, however, he should once again lead their frontline against Real Madrid from the start. Atalanta come into this match without the likes of Gianluca Scamacca, Davide Zappacosta and Juan Cuadrado who are sidelined with injuries. Atalanta starting lineup (3-5-2): Carnesecchi (GK) — Djimsiti, Hien, Kolasinac — Bellanova, De Roon, Ederson, Ruggeri, Pasalic — De Ketelaere, Lookman. Atalanta subs (11): Rossi (GK), Patricio (GK), Godfrey, Zappacosta, Palestra, Kossounou, Toloi, Samardzic, Brescianini, Zaniolo, Retegui. Ancelotti has been boosted by two major returns with Rodrygo passed fit after missing the 3-0 La Liga win over Girona with a muscle injury. Fellow Brazilian Vinicius Junior is also back - after missing the last four games - and both players are in line to start in Italy. Vini slots back into the starting XI, but Rodrygo is only fit for the bench. Dani Carvajal, David Alaba and Eder Militao are all still long-term absentees with Ferland Mendy out until the start of 2025. Fran Garcia is expected to cover for Mendy at left-back but Eduardo Camavinga has been left in Madrid as a precaution. Real Madrid starting lineup (4-3-3): Courtois (GK) — Vazquez, Tchouameni, Rudiger, F Garcia — Valverde, Bellingham, Ceballos — B. Diaz, Mbappe, Vinicius. Real Madrid subs (10): Lunin (GK), Mestre (GK), Vallejo, Y. Enriquez, Andres, Modric, Asensio, Guler, Rodrygo, Endrick.

In the UEFA Champions League... Referring only to the times they have faced each other in the UEFA Champions League, we count two duels, which took place in the round of 16 of the 2020-21 season where Los Merengues won 1-0 on Italian soil and 3-1 on Spanish soil. Referring only to the times they have faced each other in the UEFA Champions League, we count two duels, which took place in the round of 16 of the 2020-21 season where Los Merengues won 1-0 on Italian soil and 3-1 on Spanish soil. Real Madrid comes into this match with a little more motivation after having achieved an urgent and necessary 3-0 victory over Girona in LaLiga, a result that left them in second place in the table, two points behind leaders Barcelona and with a game in hand. However, Carlo Ancelotti's team has had a very discreet participation this season in the UEFA Champions League, winning only two of their five matches so far, suffering three defeats in the current campaign, two of them against Milan and Liverpool in the most recent matchdays. Los Blancos are clinging to the possibility of clinching at least a playoff spot and have three more games ahead of them to get back on track in the competition, remembering that they will also have to face Red Bull Salzburg and Stade Brest to close out the league phase.

Atalanta is one of the best teams in European soccer at the moment and comes into this match with nine consecutive victories in all competitions, the most recent being last Friday's 2-1 win over Milan, which helped them climb to the top of Serie A with 34 points from their first 15 games. Gian Piero Gasperini's side, who reached the UEFA Champions League after winning the Europa League last season, have been in fine form with 11 points from their five matches thanks to three wins and two draws, which have them in fifth place in the table.

                "content": "NWS All NOAA Safety National Program Lake effect snow is common across the Great Lakes region during the late fall and winter. Lake Effect snow occurs when cold air, often originating from Canada, moves across the open waters of the Great Lakes. As the cold air passes over the unfrozen and relatively warm waters of the Great Lakes, warmth and moisture are transferred into the lowest portion of the atmosphere. The air rises, clouds form and grow into narrow band that produces 2 to 3 inches of snow per hour or more. Wind direction is a key component in determining which areas will receive lake effect snow. Heavy snow may be falling in one location, while the sun may be shining just a mile or two away in either direction. The physical geography of the land and water is also important. National Weather Service meteorologists consider these factors as well as others when forecasting lake effect snow.

He is rated as the number one player in the 2025 class after reclassifying from the 2026 class. Dybantsa grew up in Brockton, Massachusetts and initially attended Saint Sebastian's School. He has stated that his 8th grade religious studies teacher, Mr. Lewin, has been a mentor for him. [1] He was named the Massachusetts Boys' Basketball Gatorade Player of the Year following his freshman season after averaging 19.1 points, 9.6 rebounds, 2.9 assists and 2.5 blocks per game.[2] Dybantsa helped lead Saint Sebastian's to the NEPSAC Class A state championship, but lost to Milton Academy 77–76.[1] Dybantsa transferred to Prolific Prep in Napa, California at the end of his freshman year, where he teamed up with the second-ranked player in the 2026 class, Tyran Stokes.[2][3] In July 2023, Dybantsa led the Nike Peach Jam in scoring with 25.8 points per game[4] as a member of Expressions Elite, an Amateur Athletic Union team from Boston.[5] Dybantsa will conclude his high school basketball career playing at Utah Prep in Hurricane, Utah, where he transferred for the 2024-25 season.[6] Utah Prep was previously RSL Basketball Academy in Herriman. At Utah Prep, Dybantsa will reunite with fellow USA gold medalist[7] JJ Mandaquit, the nation's seventh-ranked point guard in the 2025 class who is also playing his senior year with the program. Dybantsa was named the number one player in the 2026 class by ESPN following his freshman season,[8] with his first NCAA Division I college offer coming from Boston College.[9] Additional schools that have offered him a scholarship and/or are under consideration include Alabama, Arkansas, Auburn, Baylor, BYU, UConn, Duke, Georgia Tech, Georgetown, Kentucky, North Carolina, Providence, USC, Utah, and Washington.[10][11] In July 2023, On3.com named Dybantsa the top high school player in the country regardless of class.[4] On October 11, Dybantsa announced that he had reclassified to the 2025 class.[12] On December 10, Dybantsa announced on First Take that he would be committing to BYU.

On Tuesday, the biggest prospect in college basketball's 2025 recruiting class took to ESPN's \"First Take\" to announce where he'll be playing next season. AJ Dybantsa, the consensus top prospect in this year's senior class, announced his commitment to BYU. Dybantsa chose the Cougars over his other final three choices of Alabama, Kansas and North Carolina. Dybantsa is a native of Brockton, Mass. but is spending his senior season at Utah Prep in Hurricane, Utah. His college decision means he'll stay in the Beehive State, traveling 250 miles northeast to Provo, Utah. Here's more on Dybantsa's decision to attend BYU. MORE: Who lands where in SN's first 2025 NBA Mock Draft? Simply put, BYU's basketball program is entering a new era of excitement. Dybantsa's commitment adds to the momentum that's been building over the past year. It's been over a dozen years since Jimmer Fredette dazzled during his time with the Cougars but the program entered a new era in 2024 when it hired longtime NBA assistant coach Ryan Young to a lucrative contract. Shortly after adding Young, BYU signed Russian five-star recruit Egor Demin to be one of the program's featured players in 2024-25. The people believed to be behind it all are Jazz executives and BYU alums Ryan Smith and Danny Ainge, both of whom are doing their part to boost their alma mater in the new era of Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL). Smith is a co-founder of Qualtrics, the Jazz majority governor and is worth $2.2 billion, according to Forbes. With that in mind, Dybantsa's financial package is reportedly in the $7 million range. That BYU was willing — and able — to put together such a package speaks volumes about the caliber of player Dybantsa is. Choosing BYU is much more than a business decision, however. Dybantsa's athleticism and talent are through the roof and he now has a head coach with an NBA background. Under Young, Dybantsa can polish his game to be NBA-ready, as most expect him to head to the league after next season. \"A lot stood out on my visit … my ultimate goal is to get to the NBA,\" Dybantsa said on ESPN. \"[Young] coached one of my favorite players of all time — Kevin Durant. \"I think it's going to be the best development program for me.\" MORE COLLEGE BASKETBALL NEWS: Dybantsa is a 6-9, 210-pound small forward who has been in the spotlight for years. He was born on Jan. 29, 2007, and was originally a member of the 2026 recruiting class before reclassifying to graduate high school in 2025. As evidenced by his measurables, Dybantsa is a jumbo wing player. He pairs his size with elite strength and athleticism, allowing him to score at will. While still developing, Dybantsa's bag consists of a mixture of shifty moves that allow him to create space for jumpers or get past defenders to show off his bounce. After announcing his commitment, Dybantsa described his game as a blend of Tracy McGrady and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. Dybantsa's pro-ready body has called many to question whether or not he is ready for the NBA as a high school senior. He's no stranger to that level of competition, having already shared the floor to work out and play alongside future Hall of Famers Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, LeBron James and Chris Paul. Impressive as Dybantsa's game is, he will be tested when he takes the floor next season in the Big 12. BYU's conference foes include perennial power Kansas and the ever-physical Houston, among other strong squads. He'll continue to develop during his senior season at Utah Prep and quickly transition to the college game as soon as he steps foot on BYU's campus. He has the potential to take the squad even further than it went during Fredette's days. Gilbert McGregor first joined The Sporting News in 2018 as a content producer for Global editions of NBA.com. Before covering the game, McGregor played basketball collegiately at Wake Forest, graduating with a Communication degree in 2016. McGregor began covering the NBA during the 2017-18 season and has been on hand for a number of league events.",

The series consists of fifteen animated, standalone short stories based on the following video games and franchises:[1][2][3][4] Secret Level was created by Tim Miller, who executive produces at his company Blur Studio. Blur Studio serves as a production company along with Amazon MGM Studios. Dave Wilson serves as executive producer and supervising director. The series was ordered by Amazon Prime Video on August 14, 2024.[5] The series was announced during Gamescom on August 20, 2024. A trailer was released at the event, which featured segments from each of the episodes.[1][7] The pilot who features in the Armored Core episode was the subject of media attention and speculation due to his resemblance to actor Keanu Reeves.[8][9] Though Prime Video declined to disclose casting information at the time of the announcement, ComicBook.com reported an influx of \"nearly nothing but replies about Reeves and his potential appearance in [the series]\" under a post by Armored Core's social media account.[10] IGN's Wesley Yin-Poole said that were it not really Reeves, the actor could claim a royalty payment due to the certainty of the character's likeness to his.[11] GamesRadar+'s Ali Jones remarked that while the shot could have been \"simply be an ethnically ambiguous man with similar facial hair\", they noted the likeness, and doubted that Armored Core would place the image so prominently on their social media account if it were \"just some random actor\" and not Reeves.[12] In October 2024 Reeves's casting was officially revealed alongside Arnold Schwarzenegger, Patrick Schwarzenegger, Kevin Hart, Heaven Hart, Gabriel Luna, Ariana Greenblatt, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Michael Beach, Emily Swallow, and Claudia Doumit.[6] The series premiered worldwide on December 10, 2024.[13] Half of the episodes were released for the premiere, and the other half releases on December 17, 2024.[6] On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, Secret Level has an approval rating of 64% based on 14 reviews, with an average rating of 6.0/10.[14] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 53 out of 100 based on nine critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews.[15]",
