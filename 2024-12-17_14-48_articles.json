                "content": "Live Updates • The shooter who opened fire at the Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Wisconsin, was 15-year-old female student Natalie Rupnow, who went by the name “Samantha,” police said on Monday. She died of a self-inflicted gunshot. • The shooting left one student and one teacher dead and six injured, including two people who are facing life-threatening conditions, police said. • A second-grade student made the 911 call to report the shooting, police said Monday. • Abundant Life Christian school is a K-12 school that serves about 420 students, according to an administrator. It planned to close for Christmas vacation after this week. Authorities on Monday investigated a residential property north of Madison, Wisconsin, just eight miles from the Abundant Life Christian School where two people were killed in a shooting Monday, according to CNN affiliate WTMJ. Videos show a home decorated with Christmas lights and cordoned off with police tape. The main door had been removed, and the windows damaged. Neighbors saw police throw stun grenades, which detonate with a bright flash and loud bang, into the home earlier in the afternoon, WTMJ reported. Neighbors told WTMJ that officers had arrived in the early afternoon, just after the shooting took place, and were going in and out until night fell. “I heard the news this afternoon and thought, well, we’ll just drive by the main drag, and there it was,” one neighbor told WTMJ. “The front door was taken off and nobody was around, and the detectives are in there mopping up the mess.” Earlier on Monday, Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes said the suspect’s home had been searched and police are seeking additional search warrants. The 15-year-old suspect’s family has so far been cooperating with law enforcement, and police are not looking to charge the parents in connection to the shooting “at this time,” Barnes said. He confirmed that the heavy police presence at a home in northern Madison was related to the shooting investigation but provided no further details. Second grader Nora Gottsckalk, age 8, was in the school hallway getting ready for lunch when the shooting began, she told CNN affiliate WISC on Monday. She saw a teacher she knew well who had been injured. “She was screaming, ‘Ah, my leg, help, help!’” Nora said, clutching a SpongeBob candy in her hand as she spoke to reporters. “I was really scared, and I was really sad.” Abundant Life Christian School is a small school – about 420 students from kindergarten to high school – with parents and school administrators describing it as a tight-knit community. Bethany Highman grew up in Madison, herself attending Abundant Life as a child — and now has a daughter attending the school. Her daughter was unharmed during the shooting on Monday, she told CNN affiliate WMTV in the afternoon, but she was still waiting to be reunited and wasn’t sure of her whereabouts. “I pray with my kids every morning that this won’t happen, and it’s the world that we live in,” Highman said. “God is good, God is gracious, and my kids are safe, my family is safe.” Sixth-grade student Adler Jean-Charles was attending English class Monday morning at Abundant Life Christian School when the lockdown occurred. “I heard two (gunshots),” he told CNN affiliate WISC-TV. “Some people started crying, and then we just waited until the police came and they escorted us out.” “I was scared. Why did they do that?” he said. The students were then taken to the hospital to be reunited with their parents, where Jean-Charles received a teddy bear. When he saw his mom, “I felt safe,” he said. His mother, Mireille Jean-Charles, said she had two other sons also attending the school. When they were reunited, they cried and prayed together, she said. When asked if she was OK, she shook her head and broke into tears. “It’s sad, you know, to be home and then somebody calls you and says your kids’ school is in lockdown and a shooting, and you don’t know where they are,” she told WISC. “Thank God, they were safe. But the trauma — it’s a lot, because I’m sure they lost friends and teachers, which is not OK. And I don’t think they’ll be OK for a long time.” Authorities identified Natalie Rupnow, 15, who went by the name “Samantha,” as the suspected shooter at Abundant Life Christian School on Monday morning in Madison, Wisconsin, according to Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes. Evidence suggests the suspect died by a self-inflicted gunshot wound, Barnes said at a Monday night news conference, adding that the suspect was pronounced dead on the way to the hospital. Barnes asked the community not to hold a vigil at the school as it is still an active crime scene, which is being monitored by police overnight and no one is allowed inside or on the school property. Barnes provided additional updates during a Monday night news conference: Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes updated the timeline of the emergency response to the mass shooting Monday morning at Abundant Life Christian School. Here are some of the details he gave at a news conference: Two of the six people who were injured in Monday’s shooting are in critical condition and have life-threatening injuries, Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes said at a news conference tonight. Those two people are students, he said. “A teacher and three students were treated for non-life threatening injuries, and two of those have been released,” Barnes added. Police are not looking to charge the parents of the 15-year-old suspect in connection with Monday’s shooting, Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes said. “The parents are fully cooperating, we have no reason to believe that they have committed a crime at this time,” Barnes said. The context: In recent years, law enforcement has charged the parents of children who did a shooting at their school. James and Jennifer Crumbley, whose son Ethan carried out a school shooting at his Michigan high school in November 2021, were sentenced to 10 to 15 years in prison after being convicted of manslaughter. The father of 14-year-old Colt Gray, who carried out a mass shooting at Apalachee High School in Georgia, was charged with 29 counts earlier this year. This post was updated with context on law enforcement charging parents in mass shooting incidents. Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes said he wants to make sure all family members have been notified before he releases the ages and names of the victims of Monday’s shooting at Abundant Life Christian School. “I think we want to make sure that all family members have been notified,” Barnes said. Barnes also said he wants to make sure all family members are OK with the victims’ names being shared. He suggested the names could be released at Tuesday’s briefing at 1 p.m. local time. Police are not aware of any previous interactions with the 15-year-old suspect, Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes said. “I think if there were, we certainly would of had some type of intervention, but I’m not aware of that,” Barnes said. People need to be more responsible on social media with posts about the shooter, Police Chief Shon Barnes said when asked at a news conference whether Natalie Rupnow was transgender. “I don’t know whether Natalie was transgender or not. And quite frankly, I don’t think that’s important at all,” he said. “I don’t think whatever happened today has anything to do with how she or he or they may want to identify.” He said people who are on the Internet need to leave out their personal biases and he won’t address information he has seen posted on social media that is incorrect or “just not helping.” “For what we’re doing right now, today, literally eight hours after a mass shooting in a school in Madison, it is of no consequence at this time (what gender the shooter was),” he said. The suspect’s father is speaking with police at one of their facilities, Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes said. Police are “trying to determine what he may knew [sic] or may have not known about what happened today, but again, he lost someone as well,” Barnes said. Authorities have been unable to identify the authenticity of a manifesto, Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes said. “We haven’t been able to verify that it’s authentic. We’re certainly aware that it’s been posted and the person who posted it, alleged to have a connection with the victim,” Barnes said. Barnes said they have not located the person who posted it, but have shared information with the FBI for help. A second grader at Abundant Life Christian School called 911 to report the shooting Monday, Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes told reporters. “Let that soak in for a minute,” he said at the news conference. “A second grade student called 911 at 10:57 a.m to report a shooting at school.” Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes asked the community not to hold a vigil at Abundant Life Christian School as it is still an active crime scene. The school is being monitored by police overnight and no one is allowed inside or on the school property, he said. Monday’s shooting at Abundant Life Christian School took place in a classroom, Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes said. “The shooting happened inside a classroom in a study hall of students from mixed grades,” Barnes said. Authorities identified Natalie Rupnow, 15, who went by the name “Samantha,” as the shooter at Abundant Life Christian School on Monday morning in Madison, Wisconsin, according to the city’s police chief. Evidence suggests the shooter died by a self-inflicted gunshot wound, Chief Shon Barnes said at a Monday night news conference and was pronounced dead on the way to the hospital. This post has been updated with the suspect’s name. In their most recent update, police said two students, who were taken to local hospitals along with four other people after the shooting Monday at a private Christian school in Madison, Wisconsin, are battling life-threatening injuries and are in critical condition. Police had earlier reported that a student and a teacher were killed and others were injured in the shooting that erupted just before 11 a.m. at the Abundant Life Christian School. The suspected shooter is also dead, according to Police Chief Shon Barnes. The attack is at least the 83rd school shooting of 2024, surpassing 2023 for the most school shootings in a single year since CNN began tracking such shootings in 2008. Here’s the latest we have learned: The shooter at the Abundant Life Christian School planned the attack in advance, a law enforcement official familiar with the investigation tells CNN. The source indicated that information gathered by investigators suggests the shooter had been dealing with problems and expressed some of those in writings, which they are now reviewing. The parents of the shooter are cooperating with authorities and are being interviewed by Madison police detectives, Police Chief Shon Barnes told reporters in a news briefing Monday. President Joe Biden spoke with Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers and Madison Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway following the shooting at the Abundant Life Christian School, the White House said Monday. The president offered his continued support to help the impacted community, the White House said. Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes urged the public to not repost or share information about the shooting at Abundant Life Christian School that did not come from a trusted official or journalist. “If you’re listening to this, or you’re at home and you’re thinking about reposting or sending something that did not come from someone in this room – a trusted and respected journalist – or did not come from us, please don’t do that,” Barnes said.“It does help erode the trust in this process – and that’s all we have.” Barnes added that sharing information that doesn’t come from a trusted individual could spread “misinformation and fear” at a time when the community needs to come together. Abundant Life Christian School had a training with the Madison Police Department earlier this year about what to do in an active shooter situation, according to an administrator at the school. Barbara Wiers, the director of elementary and school relations at the school where at least two people were killed in a shooting on Monday, said the training happened just before the start of the school year. “So I think everything was very fresh for our faculty,” she said. Wiers said the training with MPD was to go through updates to the procedure. Additionally, she said the school always keeps the doors locked, which “is one of the things that makes it quick and easy to secure a room” in the event of a shooting. Teachers are responsible for shutting the door and getting students to a safe part of the room, she said. The students at Abundant Life Christian School handled themselves “magnificently” during the shooting once they realized it wasn’t a drill, said Barbara Wiers, director of elementary and school relations for the school. “The students handled themselves magnificently. I cannot tell you how well our students did in that process,” Wiers said. “They were clearly scared,” Wiers said. “When they heard ‘lockdown, lockdown’ and nothing else – they knew it was real, but they handled themselves brilliantly.” Whether the teenaged shooter looked for specific people at Abundant Life Christian School is still under investigation, Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes said. “Whether they were targeted or not would speak to motivation and we don’t know that answer just yet,” Barnes said at an evening news conference. Two people were killed and six people were injured in the school, according to officials. Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes said the shooting at the Abundant Life Christian School shooting on Monday happened “in a learning part of the school.” “I did not, again, go into the school so I don’t know the exact nomenclature of where it happened but it happened in a learning part of the school,” Barnes said. The suspected shooter in a deadly shooting on Monday in Madison, Wisconsin, was at school at the beginning of the day, Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes said. “We believe that the shooter was at school. We have no information that there was some type of breach to the school,” Barnes said. What else we know: Barnes confirmed earlier today that the suspected shooter was a student at the school. Police have declined to provide any other identifying details about the suspected shooter, but one law enforcement source told CNN the person was a female. The person was dead when police arrived. Parents of the students at the Abundant Life Christian School responded with support, patience and kindness and offered prayers, according to Barbara Wiers, director of elementary and school relations. The families “were supportive, they were amazingly patient and kind. They were offering repeatedly, ‘we’re praying for you, we’re praying for our family,’” she said at a news conference Monday evening. “We also have a very strong faith in our community that in spite of tragedy, God is working. And we believe that God is good in everything and that he turns beauty for ashes. And so I had a number of families who mentioned that to me, that this wasn’t a surprise to God, and that he’s going to do something mighty with it,” she continued. “We’re holding on to those words, and we’re continuing to believe and trust in him. He is our foundation at Abundant Life Christian school,” she added. “We have complete faith that he will carry us through this.” The US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) is working with the Madison Police Department to help find out how the shooter at Abundant Life Christian School acquired a handgun. Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes said detectives do not know where the gun came from. “That’s part of the investigative process,” he said at a evening news conference. Barnes said the ATF, which has a trace program, and the FBI are “amazing” partners. Barnes has said they believe the shooter was a teenaged student. Abundant Life Christian School does not have metal detectors, but they do have “a number of security protocols in place,” Barbara Wiers, the director of elementary and school relations at the school, said. Abundant Life Christian School is a small private school. Wiers, while not sharing any specifics of what those protocols are, said there are cameras in the hallways that are monitored regularly in the office. “We also have other safety measures throughout the building. But as to a metal detector, no, we do not have,” Wiers said. “We do abide by the policy of visual scans every morning as students come into the building, so every student is visually scanned before they go into … up to their locker spaces or into their classrooms.” Wiers said the school is two levels and the doors are locked throughout the day, adding anyone trying to come into the building during school hours has to be let in. She also confirmed the school does not have a school resource officer. About 420 students are enrolled at the K-12 school, Wiers said. This post has been updated with additional information from Wiers. Heavy police presence seen at a home in Madison’s north side is related to Monday’s shooting at Abundant Life Christian School, Police Chief Shon Barnes confirmed. “Everyone is cooperating,” he said. Barnes continued that he hoped to provide more information later today on what authorities may have learned. Two of the victims who were injured with non- life threating injuries during the Abundant Life Christian School shooting on Monday have been released, according to Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes. “A teacher and three other students were taken to area hospitals with non-life-threatening injuries,” Barnes said. “Two of those victims, two of those survivors, have been released from the hospital.” Barbara Wiers, the director of elementary and school relations at Abundant Life Christian School where at least two people were killed in a shooting on Monday, said the incident has “rocked” the school community. She thanked those who helped families and students as they were reunited earlier today. She also thanked local and state officials for their support. “This has obviously rocked our school community, but we know it affects not just our school community, but Madison and the greater area and all schools,” Wiers said. “And so our hope is that there will be some good that comes out of this as we can learn and grow and continue to support schools.” Authorities are still working to determine the motive of a teenage shooter who killed two people at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Wisconsin, on Monday morning, the city’s police chief told reporters. “We know that there is information that may be circulating about the shooter, but I cannot at this time formally tell you the age or gender or name of the shooter,” Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes said at a third news conference of the day. “We do not want to compromise any part of the investigation.” He said he may be able to disclose the “answer to some of those questions” at a news conference set for 8:30 p.m. CT (9:30 p.m. ET). Two students who were taken to local hospitals are in critical conditions with life-threatening injuries, Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes said in a press briefing on Monday evening. “Of the injured and taken to local hospitals, two students remain in critical condition. Their injuries are life threatening,” Barnes said. At least six people were injured in the shooting, including the two students. Students at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Wisconsin, have been reunited with their families, Police Chief Shon Barnes said. At the third news conference after the deadly shooting at the school, Barnes said officials are still working to make sure some teachers and staff get back to their families. These were people who worked at the school “who selflessly stayed back to make sure our kids were OK.” “We do understand that this process of reunification may have taken a while and parents really wanted to see their children, give their children a hug. Certainly I would, as a father, but we are fortunate that process is complete,” Barnes said. The school shooter was 17 years old, a law enforcement source told CNN. It is believed the shooter died of a self-inflicted gunshot, the source added. Earlier in a briefing, Madison police said the final determination for the cause of death would be made by the medical examiner. At least two people are dead and multiple others were injured after a shooting at a school in Madison, Wisconsin, on Monday, police said. The suspected shooter is also dead, according to Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes. It marks at least the 83rd school shooting of 2024, surpassing 2023 for the most school shootings in a single year since CNN began tracking such shootings in 2008. Here’s what we know so far: A candlelight vigil will be held at the Wisconsin State Capitol in Madison on Tuesday at 6 p.m. local time (7 p.m. ET), according to a post on the Facebook page of the president of the Dane County Boys & Girls Club. “We are actively planning ways to provide support, including safe spaces for youth to process their feelings, sharing mental health resources, and collaborating with community partners to address community needs,” Michael Johnson says in the post. Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway will attend the vigil, which will take place in front of the statue of civil rights icon Vel Phillips, Johnson says. “As an organization dedicated to serving youth and families, we feel it is our responsibility to step forward and create spaces for connection and healing,” Johnson says in a second post. “This vigil is one way we can stand with our community and show that we are here to support them during this unimaginable time.” The White House expressed “deep condolences” to the victims and families affected by a Madison, Wisconsin, school shooting Monday, pledging federal support for the investigation as it unfolds. “Just horrific news, and news that no family, no parent, no sibling, no son or daughter ever wants to hear, so, just terrible,” White House national security spokesperson John Kirby told reporters. “And we will continue to stay focused on the community there in Madison, and we’ll obviously offer whatever help may be required or needed of local and state authorities.” A teacher and a student are dead after a shooting at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, according to Police Chief Shon Barnes. Six people were injured, including two who have life-threatening injuries, Barnes said. Kirby reiterated that President Joe Biden was briefed on the shooting and that officials “are, as you would expect we would be, in touch with our local counterparts there in Madison to provide whatever support that they need.” The Wisconsin Department of Justice Office of School Safety (OSS) and Office of Crime Victim Services (OCVS) are providing resources after Monday’s school shooting at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Wisconsin. “I’m heartbroken for the students, teachers, staff members, and families impacted by the devastating mass shooting this morning at Abundant Life Christian School. No one should ever have to experience something like this,” said Attorney General Josh Kaul. “Our Office of School Safety is offering support and will aid the community in recovery. My thoughts and condolences are with every family affected by this tragedy.” Here are the resources laid out by OSS as part of the Critical Incident Response Team (CIRT): The head coach of the Milwaukee Bucks opened his scheduled news conference Monday by acknowledging the shooting at the Abundant Life Christian School in Madison. “Before we start, I’m sure everybody knows about the shooting in Madison, Wisconsin,” Doc Rivers said.“You know, kids can’t go to school safe and it just seems like we don’t do anything about it. I’m not gonna get up here on the podium and give a long speech except for it’s just bad and that we’re thinking about them,” Rivers said. Rivers and the Bucks are in Las Vegas to take on the Oklahoma City Thunder on Tuesday for the NBA Cup title game. The shooter at the Abundant Life Christian School in Madison was female, a law enforcement official briefed on the shooting tells CNN. The suspect, who was a teenage student at the school, is also dead. Madison Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway urged those who may be dealing with mental health concerns in the aftermath of Monday’s shooting at Abundant Life Christian School to contact 988 via text or phone, for help. “If anyone needs mental health support as a result of this incident and the coverage of it, I encourage them to reach out to 988 by phone or text and to get the mental health support that they need,” Rhodes-Conway said.“It is incredibly important that we take care of our community in this very difficult time,” Rhodes-Conway said. Madison, Wisconsin, Police Chief Shon Barnes said Monday that it is not known if the shooter had any prior contact with law enforcement. “We do not know that the shooter had any prior contact with law enforcement. But I did do a check of the school. There were some calls, but they were like 911 hang-ups, things of that nature. There was nothing that suggested that the school was a place that violence would occur,” Barnes said at a news conference. The family of the student suspected of opening fire at a Madison, Wisconsin, school on Monday is cooperating with police, police chief Shon Barnes said. Earlier in the news conference, Barnes said the suspected shooter was a student at Abundant Life Christian School, but declined to give any other identifying details. The alleged shooter was found dead at the school, police said previously. A reporter asked Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes how residents of the community can feel better in sending their kids back to school following Monday’s shooting at Abundant Life Christian School. “I think you’re asking me how can I say 100% that no child will ever be harmed in school? I can’t. No police chief can,” Barnes responded at a news conference.“All I can tell you is that we have systems in place so that if something happens, we can respond like we did today,” Barnes said. “I can tell you that our mayor and our county exec has committed resources to not only public health, but also mental health.” Abundant Life Christian School, where at least two people were killed in a shooting on Monday, did not have a school resource officer, according to Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes. “If they did, it would be a police officer and I know where they all are and they’re not in the schools right now,” Barnes said at a news conference. The police chief said that the suspected shooter was a student at the school. Madison, Wisconsin, Police Chief Shon Barnes gave details on what the investigation into the shooting at the Abundant Life Christian School looks like. Here’s what to know: The shooting at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Wisconsin, was “confined to one space” in the building, police chief Shon Barnes said. He said that he does not know specifically whether it was a classroom or a hallway. There’s no evidence that anyone else was injured that was not in that age group,” Barnes said, referring to the section of the school where the shooting happened. Abundant Life Christian School is a K-12 school that has about 390 students, according to its website. Dane County Executive Melissa Agard told reporters she received a text from her son at a Madison city high school to say he was alright. “This hits you in the gut,” she said. The community and the country are better than this, she said Monday during a news conference about the deadly shooting at the Abundant Life Christian School in the city. “This cannot continue,” she said. People across the state and nation have been calling her offering help for the community, she said. Agard pledged her office’s assistance to the people experiencing “devastating loss.” Madison Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway said “this is an incredibly sad day for our community.” While Rhodes-Conway said there’s no danger to the community at this time, the “entire community has been impacted by this tragic incident.” Madison Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway said better steps need to be taken to prevent gun violence. “I am on record that I think we need to do better in our country and our community to prevent gun violence. And I hoped that this day would never come in Madison,” she said Monday at a press briefing. “It is not something that any mayor, any fire chief, any police chief, any person in public office ever wants to have to deal with.” At least seven people were taken to area hospitals after a shooting at a Madison, Wisconsin, school on Monday, according to fire chief Chris Carbon. The fire department was dispatched to the school at around 10:57 a.m. local time, he said at a news conference. They responded with five engine companies, four ladder companies and 15 ambulances. First responders took four people to St. Mary’s Hospital and three others were taken to University of Wisconsin hospitals, Carbon said. The fire chief also thanked their county partners and other fire and EMS agencies who responded. At least six people were injured during the shooting at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Police Chief Shon Barnes said Monday during a news conference. “Six other people were injured, two students are now in critical condition in the hospital, and these injuries are considered life-threatening injuries,” Barnes said. “Four students are also at other area hospitals with non-life threatening injuries,” Barnes added. Police Chief Shon Barnes said the process of returning every student to their loved ones is underway, noting that the Madison, Wisconsin, school building is clear and there is no other threat to the community. “There is no other threat or danger to the community. We’re in the process now of what we call reunification. And what that simply means is making sure that every student that was in the school is present and accounted for and returned to their loved ones,” he said at a briefing Monday. While such a process can take time, the preparedness of law enforcement has helped accelerate it. ” We have practiced, unfortunately, and practiced and practiced. And that’s why we’re able to reunify students with their parents within hours of a school shooting,” Barnes said. He thanked Dean Clinic on Stoughton Road for helping with the reunification process. Police Chief Shon Barnes said many people have asked him about “the why of this” shooting that happened Monday morning at Abundant Life Christian School. “Why did this happen? What do we know? What was the motivation?” the Madison, Wisconsin, police chief said. “I do not know.” He said detectives are working hard to find out as many answers at they can to prevent future shootings. Police Chief Shon Barnes said a teacher and a student were killed in the shooting at the Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Wisconsin, on Monday. The person suspected of opening fire at a Madison school on Monday was a student, police chief Shon Barnes said. The shooting happened at Abundant Life Christian School. “We know that the suspect shooter was a teenage student who attended the school,” Barnes said. He said police are not releasing the age or gender of the suspected shooter at this time. The shooter at Abundant Life Christian School used a 9mm pistol, according to a law enforcement source. The Abundant Life Christian School shooting in Madison, Wisconsin, marks at least the 83rd school shooting of 2024, surpassing 2023 for the most school shootings in a single year since CNN began tracking such shootings in 2008. The total number of school shootings CNN counted in 2023 was at least 82 shootings. Of the 83 school shootings this year, 56 shootings have been reported on K-12 campuses and 27 on university and college campuses. The deadliest school shooting of the year was in Winder, Georgia, where four victims were left dead at a shooting at Apalachee High School. At least two victims were killed at the Abundant Life Christian School on Monday. Take a look: The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) is on the scene of a school shooting in Madison, Wisconsin, as officials work to learn more about the gun that was used. ATF is running a trace on the firearm, an agency spokesperson told CNN. They will try to figure out where the gun came from, according to CNN correspondent Josh Campbell “That’s going to be a key part of this investigation as well, because we’ve seen, sadly, again, in shootings, that owners of weapons have been held accountable whenever someone underage then goes on to conduct an act of violence,” Campbell said. Police said on Monday that the suspected shooter was believed to be a student at Abundant Life Christian School. The suspect was found dead inside the building, Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes said. This post has been updated with additional information from the ATF. At least two people are dead after a shooting at a Madison, Wisconsin, school on Monday, according to a statement from police. The statement came shortly after a news conference at which police mistakenly reported four people were killed in the shooting. The suspect in the school shooting is also dead, police said. “This is a ever-evolving situation,” Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes said at the news conference. “So there’s a lot of work that has to be done, and we’re committed to doing that work. We just ask for your patience.” Barnes declined to give additional details about if the victims were teachers or students until families are notified. This post has been updated with the statement from Madison Police. Lawmakers from Wisconsin are reacting to the news of the shooting at the Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, where two were killed and the suspect is dead, according to police. Sen. Ron Johnson: “My sincere condolences and prayers for all the victims of the tragedy at Abundant Life Christian School. I will continue to closely monitor the situation,” he said in a post on X. Sen.

Medics with the Madison, Wisconsin, Police Department were conducting training nearby before they responded to a school shooting on Monday, Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes said. “They left the training center immediately and came down here — and doing in real time what they were actually practicing for,” Barnes said at a news conference. He said the training center is about three miles from Abundant Life Christian School, where the shooting occurred. Barnes said at least seven people were taken to the hospital after first responders gave them “life-saving measures.” “That’s why training is so important and making sure that we can provide the best possible training and the best possible response for our community members,” the police chief said. Abundant Life Christian School posted a statement online asking for prayers after two people were killed during a shooting at the school Monday morning. “Prayers Requested! Today, we had an active shooter incident at ALCS. We are in the midst of following up. We will share information as we are able. Please pray for our Challenger Family,” the school posted.

Senior White House officials are in touch with local counterparts in Madison to provide support as needed,” senior deputy press secretary Emilie Simons said. The Madison Police Department is declining to provide details about the people killed during a shooting at a Christian school Monday morning, citing the need to contact the victims’ families before releasing details. “I’m not going to give any information about who the victims are, whether they’re students, staff or parents, because we need to make sure that we can notify people,” Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes said. Police have also not provided information about the shooter, who is also dead. There are currently no other threats to schools in Madison, Wisconsin, or the community, the police chief said. It comes after two people were killed in a shooting at Abundant Life Christian School on Monday, according to Police Chief Shon Barnes. Police are still clearing the school and vehicles in the area, “making certain that there is no other threats to this community, which we believe there are none.” He also said police put other schools in the district on lockdown, “but there is no threat to MMSD schools at this time.” Madison, Wisconsin, Police Chief Shon Barnes said officers responded to a call about an active shooter at the Abundant Life Christian School at 10:57 a.m. local time. “Today around 10:57 a.m., our officers were responding to a call of an active shooter at the Abundant Life Christian School here in Madison,” he said at a press briefing. “When officers arrived, they found multiple victims suffering from gunshot wounds,” he added. Madison, Wisconsin, Police Chief Shon Barnes called today a “sad, sad day” not just for the community, but for the country after a shooting at a school on Monday. The shooting happened at Abundant Life Christian School where police previously said there are multiple reported injuries. “Yet another police chief is doing a press conference to speak about violence in our community, specifically in one of the places that’s most sacred to me as someone who loves education and to someone who has children that are in schools,” Barnes said. Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers said that there are “no words to describe the devastation and heartbreak” after a deadly shooting at a Madison school on Monday. “Kathy and I join the people of Wisconsin in praying for the families and loved ones of those whose lives were so senselessly taken and for the educators, staff, and the entire Abundant Life school community as they grapple with the grief, trauma, and loss of this gun-wrenching tragedy,” Evers said in a statement posted on X. Earlier in the day, the governor also posted on X, saying he was “closely monitoring” the shooting at the Abundant Life Christian School. “We are praying for the kids, educators, and entire Abundant Life school community as we await more information and are grateful for the first responders who are working quickly to respond,” he said in the first post. This post has been updated with more reaction from Evers. The shooting at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison has resulted in several casualties and there are transports to area hospitals which include children, Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes tells CNN. The chief added that one suspect is down. Authorities are still conducting a secondary searches of buildings and vehicles. Police will give an update on a shooting at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Wisconsin, soon. Madison police said in a news conference that the update is expected at 12:15 local time (1:15 ET). Earlier, police said “multiple injuries” were reported. Media is asked to meet at the Kwik Trip on Buckeye Road.Press update on school shooting will happen at 12:15. Madison Police officers are investigating a shooting at Abundant Life Christian School, the police department said. “Multiple injuries have been reported,” police said. “This remains an active and ongoing investigation.” Police told CNN officers are working to clear the school and have no one in custody. Police announced various road closures and asked people to avoid the area. Abundant Life Christian School is a K-12 school serving approximately 390 students, according to its website. The school has a 28-acre campus and its website boasts “smaller class sizes” that cater to students from about 200 families in the Dane County area. The school planned to close for Christmas vacation after this week. CNN’s Dakin Andone, Sara Smart and Bill Kirkos contributed to this post. © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

                "content": "Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Selina Guevara Reporting from Madison, Wisc. A resident of the same neighborhood as the teenage school shooter said that at about 1 this afternoon, just hours after the gunfire on campus, police arrived at the 15-year-old's home. He said he saw at least 10 police cars and dozens of officers, in addition to a SWAT truck that arrived on his neighbor’s front lawn. Residents reported flash-bangs in the neighborhood in north Madison, and the neighbor said he and his wife went to their basement. “After the first boom, that’s when we’re like, oh, we probably shouldn’t be up here,\" he said. The couple remained in the basement for about 45 minutes. They said officers came to their door to provide an update and give the all-clear. Phil Helsel The shooting occurred in a classroom during study hall, police said. The study hall had students in mixed grades when the 15-year-old female student opened fire, Barnes said. Phil Helsel Madison police investigating today’s shooting are aware of a document online and are looking into it to learn more, Barnes said. “A document about this shooting is circulating at this time on social media, but we have not verified its authenticity,” Barnes said. Police are working to determine the motive, he said. Police have spoken to the shooter’s parents, and they are fully cooperative, he said. Police are also searching the shooter’s home, he said. Phil Helsel Madison’s chief of police was asked about comments online that suggest the shooter may have been trans. “I don’t know whether Natalie was transgender or not,” Barnes said at a news conference tonight. “I don’t think that whatever happened today has anything to do with how she or he or they may have wanted to identify,” he said. “And I wish people would kind of leave their own personal biases out of this.” Barnes said a motive is under investigation. The shooter, who is dead of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound, has been identified by Barnes as Natalie Rupnow. He said he has seen things on social media that “frankly are incorrect, that are not true.” “So, whether or not she was, he was, they were transgender is something that may come out later — but for what we’re doing right now, today, literally eight hours after a mass shooting in a school in Madison, it is of no consequence at this time,” Barnes said. “And so I would encourage people to be responsible with your social media,” he said. Phil Helsel A second grade student called 911 at 10:57 a.m. to report the shooting, the police chief said. “Let that soak in for a minute,” Barnes said at a news conference this evening. “A second grade student called 911 at 10:57 a.m. to report a shooting at school.” A teacher and a teenage student were killed, and the shooter, who was 15 years old, died of what is believed to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound, he said. Six other students and a teacher were also injured, Barnes said. Two injured students remain in critical condition tonight, he said. Phil Helsel The person who opened fire at a Madison, Wisconsin, school today was a 15-year-old female student, the police chief said tonight. Barnes said Natalie Rupnow, who went by the name Samantha, died en route to a hospital of what is believed to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound, Barnes said. The county medical examiner will make an official determination of the cause and manner of death, he said. A motive is still under investigation, Barnes said. Investigators have talked to the shooter’s family and searched the home, Barnes said. The parents are \"fully cooperating,\" Barnes said. Phil Helsel Madison’s police chief late this afternoon called on the public to report troubling behaviors that could lead to violence like today’s school shooting. “Pre-planned or planned shootings, we believe, are preventable,” Barnes said at a late afternoon news conference. “If you see warning behaviors from someone that is planning an attack, say something, do something.” A motive in the shooting, which killed two people, is under investigation. The shooter, described as a teenager, is also dead. “Targeted violence is preventable,” said Trish Kilpin, director of the office of school safety with the Wisconsin Justice Department. “When somebody conducts a school shooting, they don’t snap. They don’t just decide one day to engage in this egregious behavior. “Instead, they make a decision and start research and planning toward an act of violence,” she said. “And when they’re on that pathway to violence, they often demonstrate observable behaviors that others notice.” Kilpin said that in 82% of cases, someone else knows about a shooter’s plans to attack a school. Selina Guevara Reporting from Madison, Wisc. At a news briefing this evening, the police chief confirmed that police activity at a home in Madison’s north side was related to the investigation into this morning's school shooting. Officers at a home on Delaware Boulevard this evening said a search warrant had been executed there. Neighbors confirmed the police activity at the home, which by this evening had no front door. Neighbors told NBC affiliate WTMJ of Milwaukee that police threw two flash-bang devices at the home, one through the door and one through the window. Alicia Victoria Lozano Cheyenne Darcy Amaya John Diaz de Leon II was home watching TV around 11 a.m. when suddenly he heard police and ambulance sirens in the otherwise quiet neighborhood. De Leon and his wife live about a block from Abundant Life Christian School, which their children attended when they were young. They decided to build their home near the school in the late 1980s after having met with school officials and decided Abundant Life felt like a great fit for their growing family. But today, he knew something wasn't right when \"not one, not two, but three and then more\" sirens approached the neighborhood. De Leon saw dozens of students evacuating the school when he stepped outside, he said. The older students walked quickly across the parking lot toward a church, while younger students held hands as school personnel led them outside. He also saw two police officers with what he described as \"long guns\" approach the school with dogs by their sides. \"This is the last school in Madison you would have thought this would happen,\" he said. \"The threat has passed, but it ain’t over.\" Phil Helsel Students told to lock down after today’s shooting knew the situation was not a drill and “handled themselves magnificently,” a school official said. “They were clearly scared. ... When we practice we always say, ‘This a drill, this is just a drill,’” Barbara Wiers, the school’s director of elementary and school relations, said at an evening news conference. “When they heard ‘lockdown, lockdown’ and nothing else, they knew it was real, and they handled themselves brilliantly,” she said. Wiers said that she was teaching at the time and that after the alert she worked to secure the door and move the children to a safe part of the room. Phil Helsel Police said they are still investigating a possible motive in today's deadly shooting, Barnes said in an update this evening. “At this time, we’re still working on a motive, trying to determine why this happened,” Barnes said. The age, gender and name of the shooter were not released. Another police update is scheduled for later. “We do not want to compromise any part of the investigation,” Barnes said. Phil Helsel All surviving students have been reunited with their families and loved ones, Barnes said this evening. Two students remained in critical condition at a hospital, and their injuries are life-threatening, Barnes said. Four people were also injured, a teacher and three students, he said. Those injuries are not life-threatening, and two of those injured people have been released from the hospital, he said. Karen Cortes President Joe Biden called today's school shooting \"shocking and unconscionable\" in a statement pressing Congress to \"act now\" on gun legislation. Among the changes Biden described as “commonsense” gun laws were: universal background checks, a national red flag law, and bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. \"From Newtown to Uvalde, Parkland to Madison, to so many other shootings that don’t receive attention — it is unacceptable that we are unable to protect our children from this scourge of gun violence,\" Biden said in a statement. \"We cannot continue to accept it as normal.\" He also offered condolences to the victims' families while expressing gratitude to the first responders at Abundant Life Christian School. Doha Madani Emotional support animals were taken to the site where students are waiting to be bused to the reunification center. The therapy dogs were seen being walked in to the area on NBC affiliate WMTV of Madison as students sat in a church while officials organized them onto city buses to be taken to the health clinic where their families are gathered. Some younger students have already been taken to the reunification center, WMTV reported. Annemarie Bonner Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers thanked law enforcement and first responders in a new statement for their response to today's shooting. He also ordered the flags of Wisconsin and the U.S. lowered to half-staff until Sunday. “As a father, a grandfather, and as governor, it is unthinkable that a kid or an educator might wake up and go to school one morning and never come home. This should never happen, and I will never accept this as a foregone reality or stop working to change it,\" he said. Evers also said \"there are no words to describe the devastation and heartbreak\" he feels. © 2024 NBCUniversal Media, LLC",

                "content": "Follow: A shooting at a small Christian school in Madison, Wisconsin, on Monday, left a teenage student and a teacher dead and several others injured, casting the small religious community into mourning just days before the school was going to close for Christmas. Police rushed to Abundant Life Christian School just before 11 a.m. Monday in response to reports of an active shooter, Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes said. In addition to the two people killed, another six are injured, according to police, including two students with life-threatening injuries in critical condition. A teacher and two other students received non-life-threatening injuries, according to Barnes. The shooting suspect, a teenage student, was also found dead at the scene, according to the police chief. Authorities identified Natalie Rupnow, 15, who went by the name “Samantha,” as the shooter, according to the city’s police chief. Evidence suggests the shooter died by a self-inflicted gunshot wound, Barnes said at a Monday night news conference. “Today truly is a sad day for Madison and for our country. It is a day that I believe will live in our collective minds for a very, very long time,” Barnes said during a news conference earlier Monday. Now, federal and local law enforcement are combing over the crime scene, working to uncover the suspect’s motive and preparing to support the heartbroken school community as they find themselves at the center of a distinctly American tragedy. The attack at Abundant Life is at least the 83rd school shooting of 2024, surpassing 2023 for the most school shootings in a single year since CNN began tracking such shootings in 2008. Abundant Life posted on its social media to ask that the public, “please pray for our Challenger Family” as they grapple with the attack. “I hoped that this day would never come in Madison,” Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway said Monday at a news conference. “It is not something that any mayor, any fire chief, any police chief, any person in public office ever wants to have to deal with.” Follow our live coverage here. Here’s what we know so far. Just hours before the shooting began, students from kindergarten to high school filed onto the school’s 28-acre campus to sit through the last week of classes before Christmas vacation. They had a week of festivities to look forward to, including a holiday concert and an Ugly Christmas Sweater Day, according to the school’s website. The suspected shooter entered the school at the beginning of the day with the rest of the students, police said. But as the school day got underway, investigators believe the suspect pulled out a handgun and opened fire on their peers, Barnes said. The shooting was “confined to one space,” the chief said, adding later it was a “learning” part of the school. At 10:57 a.m., the Madison Police Department received a 911 call from inside the school, Barnes said. Medics with the police department were conducting training about three miles away and raced to respond to the shooting, Barnes said. “They left the training center immediately and came down here — and doing in real time what they were actually practicing for,” Barnes said at a news conference. The first officers arrived at the school at 11 a.m. and immediately entered the building, Barnes said. “When officers arrived, they found multiple victims suffering from gunshot wounds,” Barnes said. Police also found the body of a teenage student whom they believe to be the shooter, the police chief said. He declined to provide the gender, age or name of the suspect. Related article 2 kindergartners in critical condition after gunman opened fire at Christian school Police cleared the school building and all students were accounted for and reunited with their families, Barnes said. “They were clearly scared,” Barbara Wiers, director of elementary and school relations for Abundant Life, said of the students when they realized it wasn’t a drill. “When they heard ‘lockdown, lockdown’ and nothing else – they knew it was real, but they handled themselves brilliantly.” The K-12 school serves approximately 420 students, according to school administrators. The school’s website boasts “smaller class sizes” catering to students from about 200 families in the Dane County area. The attack has “rocked” the Abundant Life community, which sees itself as a large family, Wiers said. “We know it affects not just our school community, but Madison and the greater area and all schools,” Wiers told reporters. “So our hope is that there will be some good that comes out of this as we can learn and grow and continue to support schools.” Wiers spoke to parents at the reunification center, and they were amazingly patient and kind, she said, adding they were all affected even if their child wasn’t directly impacted. “Because what affects one part of the body, affects all of it, as we know the Bible says,” she said. She said the school family believes God was not surprised by the shooting and is “going to do something mighty with it.” Federal and local investigators are working to determine the timeline of events, the suspect’s motive and details about the firearm used in the shooting. Law enforcement officials are now working to interview witnesses, and students are being encouraged to speak only when they feel ready, the police chief said. “We’re not going to interrogate students. We’re going to give them an opportunity to come in and speak to what they may have saw when they feel ready, which is why some of these questions can’t be answered,” Barnes said. The suspect’s home was searched Monday and police are seeking additional search warrants, Barnes said. The suspect’s family has so far been cooperating with law enforcement. A heavy police presence was reported at a home in northern Madison Monday night. Barnes confirmed it is related to the shooting investigation but provided no further details. It is unclear whether the suspected shooter had any prior contact with law enforcement, Barnes said. “I did do a check of the school,” the police chief said. “There were some calls, but they were like 911 hang-ups, things of that nature. There was nothing that suggested that the school was a place that violence would occur.” The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives will trace the gun used in the attack to determine its origin, according to police. President Joe Biden has been briefed on the shooting, a White House spokesperson said. “Senior White House officials are in touch with local counterparts in Madison to provide support as needed,” senior deputy press secretary Emilie Simons said. Of the 83 school shootings this year, 56 have been reported on K-12 campuses and 27 on university and college campuses. The deadliest school shooting of the year was in Winder, Georgia, where four victims were left dead at Apalachee High School. “Many of you have asked me about the ‘why’ of this. ‘Why did this happen? What do we know? What was the motivation?’” Barnes told reporters Monday. “I do not know, but I will tell you this: Our detectives are working hard in the investigative process to find out as many answers as we can so that we can further prevent these things from happening, not only in this community, but in other communities around our country.” “I think we can all agree that enough is enough. We have to come together to do everything we can to support our students, to prevent press conferences like these from happening again and again and again,” Barnes said.

                "title": "Vikings - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Chronological history Vikings were seafaring people originally from Scandinavia (present-day Denmark, Norway, and Sweden),[3][4][5][6] who from the late 8th to the late 11th centuries raided, pirated, traded, and settled throughout parts of Europe.[7][8][9] They also voyaged as far as the Mediterranean, North Africa, the Middle East, Greenland, and Vinland (present-day Newfoundland in Canada, North America). In their countries of origin, and some of the countries they raided and settled in, this period is popularly known as the Viking Age, and the term \"Viking\" also commonly includes the inhabitants of the Scandinavian homelands as a whole. The Vikings had a profound impact on the early medieval history of Scandinavia, the British Isles, France, Estonia, and Kievan Rus'.[10] Expert sailors and navigators of their characteristic longships, Vikings established Norse settlements and governments in the British Isles, the Faroe Islands, Iceland, Greenland, Normandy, and the Baltic coast, as well as along the Dnieper and Volga trade routes across modern-day Russia, Belarus,[11] and Ukraine,[12] where they were also known as Varangians. The Normans, Norse-Gaels, Rus' people, Faroese, and Icelanders emerged from these Norse colonies. At one point, a group of Rus Vikings went so far south that, after briefly being bodyguards for the Byzantine emperor, they attacked the Byzantine city of Constantinople.[13] Vikings also voyaged to Iran[14][page needed] and Arabia.[15] They were the first Europeans to reach North America, briefly settling in Newfoundland (Vinland). While spreading Norse culture to foreign lands, they simultaneously brought home slaves, concubines, and foreign cultural influences to Scandinavia, influencing the genetic[16] and historical development of both. During the Viking Age, the Norse homelands were gradually consolidated from smaller kingdoms into three larger kingdoms: Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. The Vikings spoke Old Norse and made inscriptions in runes. For most of the period, they followed the Old Norse religion, but later became Christians. The Vikings had their own laws, art, and architecture. Most Vikings were also farmers, fishermen, craftsmen, and traders. Popular conceptions of the Vikings often strongly differ from the complex, advanced civilisation of the Norsemen that emerges from archaeology and historical sources. A romanticised picture of Vikings as noble savages began to emerge in the 18th century; this developed and became widely propagated during the 19th-century Viking revival.[17][18] Perceived views of the Vikings as violent, piratical heathens or as intrepid adventurers owe much to conflicting varieties of the modern Viking myth that had taken shape by the early 20th century. Current popular representations of the Vikings are typically based on cultural clichés and stereotypes, complicating modern appreciation of the Viking legacy. These representations are rarely accurate—for example, there is no evidence that they wore horned helmets, a costume element that first appeared in the 19th century. The etymology of the word Viking has been much debated by academics, with many origin theories being proposed.[20][21] One theory suggests that the word's origin is from the Old English wicing 'settlement' and the Old Frisian wizing, attested almost 300 years prior.[22] Another less popular theory is that víking came from the feminine vík 'creek', 'inlet', 'small bay'.[23] Another etymology that gained support in the early 21st century derives Viking from the same root as Old Norse vika 'sea mile', originally referring to the distance between two shifts of rowers, ultimately from the Proto-Germanic *wîkan 'to recede'.[24][25][26][27] This is found in the early Nordic verb *wikan 'to turn', similar to Old Icelandic víkja 'to move, to turn', with \"well-attested nautical usages\", according to Bernard Mees.[26] This theory is better attested linguistically, and the term most likely predates the use of the sail by the Germanic peoples of northwestern Europe.[27][26][28] In the Middle Ages, viking came to refer to Scandinavian pirates or raiders.[29][30][31] The earliest reference to wicing in English sources is from the Épinal-Erfurt glossary (c. 700), about 93 years before the first known attack by Viking raiders in England. The glossary lists the Latin translation for wicing as piraticum 'pirate'.[32][33] In Old English, the word wicing appears in the Anglo-Saxon poem Widsith, probably from the 9th century. The word was not regarded as a reference to nationality, with other terms such as Northmen and Dene 'Danes' being used for that. In Asser's Latin work The Life of King Alfred, the Danes are referred to as pagani 'pagans'; historian Janet Nelson states that pagani became \"the Vikings\" in standard translations of this work, even though there is \"clear evidence\" that it was used as a synonym, while Eric Christiansen avers that it is a mistranslation made at the insistence of the publisher.[34] The word wicing does not occur in any preserved Middle English texts. The word Viking was introduced into Modern English during the 18th-century Viking revival, at which point it acquired romanticised heroic overtones of \"barbarian warrior\" or noble savage.[35] During the 20th century, the meaning of the term was expanded to refer not only to seaborne raiders from Scandinavia and other places settled by them (like Iceland and the Faroe Islands), but also any member of the culture that produced the raiders during the period from the late 8th to the mid-11th centuries, or more loosely from about 700 to as late as about 1100. As an adjective, the word is used to refer to ideas, phenomena, or artefacts connected with those people and their cultural life, producing expressions like Viking age, Viking culture, Viking art, Viking religion, Viking ship and so on. The Viking Age in Scandinavian history is taken to have been the period from the earliest recorded raids by Norsemen in 793 until the Norman conquest of England in 1066.[36] Vikings used the Norwegian Sea and Baltic Sea for sea routes to the south. The Normans were descendants of those Vikings who had been given feudal overlordship of areas in northern France, namely the Duchy of Normandy, in the 10th century. In that respect, descendants of the Vikings continued to have an influence in northern Europe. Likewise, King Harold Godwinson, the last Anglo-Saxon king of England, had Danish ancestors. Two Vikings even ascended to the throne of England, with Sweyn Forkbeard claiming the English throne in 1013 until 1014 and his son Cnut the Great being king of England between 1016 and 1035.[37][38][39][40][41] Geographically, the Viking Age covered Scandinavian lands (modern Denmark, Norway and Sweden), as well as territories under North Germanic dominance, mainly the Danelaw, including Scandinavian York, the administrative centre of the remains of the Kingdom of Northumbria,[42] parts of Mercia, and East Anglia.[43] Viking navigators opened the road to new lands to the north, west and east, resulting in the foundation of independent settlements in the Shetland, Orkney, and Faroe Islands; Iceland; Greenland;[44] and L'Anse aux Meadows, a short-lived settlement in Newfoundland, circa 1000.[45] The Greenland settlement was established around 980, during the Medieval Warm Period, and its demise by the mid-15th century may have been partly due to climate change.[46] The Viking Rurik dynasty took control of territories in Slavic and Finnic-dominated areas of Eastern Europe; they annexed Kiev in 882 to serve as the capital of the Kievan Rus'.[47] As early as 839, when Swedish emissaries are first known to have visited Byzantium, Scandinavians served as mercenaries in the service of the Byzantine Empire.[48] In the late 10th century, a new unit of the imperial bodyguard formed. Traditionally containing large numbers of Scandinavians, it was known as the Varangian Guard. The word Varangian may have originated in Old Norse, but in Slavic and Greek it could refer either to Scandinavians or Franks. In these years, Swedish men left to enlist in the Byzantine Varangian Guard in such numbers that a medieval Swedish law, the Västgötalagen, from Västergötland declared no-one could inherit while staying in \"Greece\"—the then Scandinavian term for the Byzantine Empire—to stop the emigration,[49] especially as two other European courts simultaneously also recruited Scandinavians:[50] Kievan Rus' c. 980–1060 and London 1018–1066 (the Þingalið).[50] There is archaeological evidence that Vikings reached Baghdad, the centre of the Islamic Empire.[51] The Norse regularly plied the Volga with their trade goods: furs, tusks, seal fat for boat sealant, and slaves. Important trading ports during the period include Birka, Hedeby, Kaupang, Jorvik, Staraya Ladoga, Novgorod, and Kiev. Scandinavian Norsemen explored Europe by its seas and rivers for trade, raids, colonisation, and conquest. In this period, voyaging from their homelands in Denmark, Norway and Sweden the Norsemen settled in the present-day Faroe Islands, Iceland, Norse Greenland, Newfoundland, the Netherlands, Germany, Normandy, Italy, Scotland, England, Wales, Ireland, the Isle of Man, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania,[52] Ukraine, Russia and Turkey, as well as initiating the consolidation that resulted in the formation of the present-day Scandinavian countries. In the Viking Age, the present day nations of Norway, Sweden and Denmark did not exist, but the peoples who lived in what is now those countries were largely homogeneous and similar in culture and language, although somewhat distinct geographically. The names of Scandinavian kings are reliably known for only the later part of the Viking Age. After the end of the Viking Age, the separate kingdoms gradually acquired distinct identities as nations, which went hand-in-hand with their Christianisation. Thus, the end of the Viking Age for the Scandinavians also marks the start of their relatively brief Middle Ages. Slavic and Viking tribes were \"closely linked, fighting one another, intermixing and trading\".[53][54][55] In the Middle Ages, goods were transferred from Slavic areas to Scandinavia, and Denmark could be considered \"a melting pot of Slavic and Scandinavian elements\".[53] Leszek Gardeła, of the Department of Scandinavian Languages and Literatures at the University of Bonn, posits that the presence of Slavs in Scandinavia is \"more significant than previously thought\",[53] while Mats Roslund states that \"the Slavs and their interaction with Scandinavia have not been adequately investigated\".[56] A 10th-century grave of a warrior-woman in Denmark was long thought to belong to a Viking. However, new analyses suggest that the woman may have been a Slav from present-day Poland.[53] The first king of the Swedes, Eric, was married to Gunhild, of the Polish House of Piast.[57] Likewise, his son, Olof, fell in love with Edla, a Slavic woman, and took her as his frilla (concubine).[58] They had a son and a daughter: Emund the Old, King of Sweden, and Astrid, Queen of Norway. Cnut the Great, King of Denmark, England and Norway, was the son of a daughter of Mieszko I of Poland,[59] possibly the former Polish queen of Sweden, wife of Eric. Colonisation of Iceland by Norwegian Vikings began in the 9th century. The first source mentioning Iceland and Greenland is a papal letter from 1053. Twenty years later, they appear in the Gesta of Adam of Bremen. It was not until after 1130, when the islands had become Christianised, that accounts of the history of the islands were written from the point of view of the inhabitants in sagas and chronicles.[60] The Vikings explored the northern islands and coasts of the North Atlantic, ventured south to North Africa, east to Kievan Rus (now – Ukraine, Belarus), Constantinople, and the Middle East.[61] They raided and pillaged, traded, acted as mercenaries and settled colonies over a wide area.[62] Early Vikings probably returned home after their raids. Later in their history, they began to settle in other lands.[63] Vikings under Leif Erikson, heir to Erik the Red, reached North America and set up short-lived settlements in present-day L'Anse aux Meadows, Newfoundland, Canada. This expansion occurred during the Medieval Warm Period.[64] Viking expansion into continental Europe was limited. Their realm was bordered by powerful tribes to the south. Early on, it was the Saxons who occupied Old Saxony, located in what is now Northern Germany. The Saxons were a fierce and powerful people and were often in conflict with the Vikings. To counter the Saxon aggression and solidify their own presence, the Danes constructed the huge defence fortification of Danevirke in and around Hedeby.[65] The Vikings witnessed the violent subduing of the Saxons by Charlemagne, in the thirty-year Saxon Wars of 772–804. The Saxon defeat resulted in their forced christening and the absorption of Old Saxony into the Carolingian Empire. Fear of the Franks led the Vikings to further expand Danevirke,[65] and the defence constructions remained in use throughout the Viking Age and even up until 1864.[66] The southern coast of the Baltic Sea was ruled by the Obotrites, a federation of Slavic tribes loyal to the Carolingians and later the Frankish empire. The Vikings—led by King Gudfred—destroyed the Obotrite city of Reric on the southern Baltic coast in 808 AD and transferred the merchants and traders to Hedeby.[67] This secured Viking supremacy in the Baltic Sea, which continued throughout the Viking Age. Because of the expansion of the Vikings across Europe, a comparison of DNA and archeology undertaken by scientists at the University of Cambridge and University of Copenhagen suggested that the term \"Viking\" may have evolved to become \"a job description, not a matter of heredity\", at least in some Viking bands.[68] The motives driving the Viking expansion are a topic of much debate. The concept that Vikings may have originally started sailing and raiding due to a need to seek out women from foreign lands was expressed in the 11th century by historian Dudo of Saint-Quentin in his semi-imaginary History of The Normans.[69] [70][71] As observed by Adam of Bremen, rich and powerful Viking men tended to have many wives and concubines;[72] and these polygynous relationships may have led to a shortage of women available to the Viking male. Consequently, the average Viking man may have felt compelled to seek wealth and power to have the means to acquire suitable women.[73] Several centuries after Dudo's observations, scholars revived this idea, and over time it became a cliché among scholars of the Viking Age.[74] Viking men would often buy or capture women and make them into their wives or concubines;[75][76] such polygynous marriages increase male-male competition in society because they create a pool of unmarried men who are willing to engage in risky status-elevating and sex-seeking behaviors.[77][78] The Annals of Ulster states that in 821 the Vikings plundered an Irish village and \"carried off a great number of women into captivity\".[79] One common theory posits that Charlemagne \"used force and terror to Christianise all pagans\", leading to baptism, conversion or execution, and as a result, Vikings and other pagans resisted and wanted revenge.[80][81][82][83][84] Professor Rudolf Simek states that \"it is not a coincidence if the early Viking activity occurred during the reign of Charlemagne\".[80][85] The ascendance of Christianity in Scandinavia led to serious conflict, dividing Norway for almost a century. However, this time period did not commence until the 10th century. Norway was never subject to aggression by Charlemagne and the period of strife was due to successive Norwegian kings embracing Christianity after encountering it overseas.[86] Another explanation is that the Vikings exploited a moment of weakness in the surrounding regions. Contrary to Simek's assertion, Viking raids occurred sporadically long before the reign of Charlemagne; but exploded in frequency and size after his death, when his empire fragmented into multiple much weaker entities.[87] England suffered from internal divisions and was a relatively easy prey given the proximity of many towns to the sea or to navigable rivers. Lack of organised naval opposition throughout Western Europe allowed Viking ships to travel freely, raiding or trading as opportunity permitted. The decline in the profitability of old trade routes could also have played a role. Trade between Western Europe and the rest of Eurasia suffered a severe blow when the Western Roman Empire fell in the 5th century.[88] The expansion of Islam in the 7th century had also affected trade with Western Europe.[89] Raids in Europe, including raids and settlements from Scandinavia, were not unprecedented and had occurred long before the Vikings arrived. The Jutes invaded the British Isles three centuries earlier, from Jutland during the Age of Migrations, before the Danes settled there. The Saxons and the Angles did the same, embarking from mainland Europe. The Viking raids were, however, the first to be documented by eyewitnesses, and they were much larger in scale and frequency than in previous times.[87] Vikings themselves were expanding; although their motives are unclear, historians believe that scarce resources or a lack of mating opportunities were a factor.[90] The slave trade was an important part of the Viking economy, with most slaves destined to Scandinavia although many others were shipped east where they could be sold for large profits.[91] The \"Highway of Slaves\" was a term for a route that the Vikings found to have a direct pathway from Scandinavia to Constantinople and Baghdad while traveling on the Baltic Sea. With the advancements of their ships during the 9th century, the Vikings were able to sail to Kievan Rus and some northern parts of Europe.[92] Jomsborg was a semi-legendary Viking stronghold at the southern coast of the Baltic Sea (medieval Wendland, modern Pomerania), that existed between the 960s and 1043. Its inhabitants were known as Jomsvikings. Jomsborg's exact location, or its existence, has not yet been established, though it is often maintained that Jomsborg was somewhere on the islands of the Oder estuary.[93] While the Vikings were active beyond their Scandinavian homelands, Scandinavia was itself experiencing new influences and undergoing a variety of cultural changes.[94] By the late 11th century, royal dynasties were legitimised by the Catholic Church (which had had little influence in Scandinavia 300 years earlier) which were asserting their power with increasing authority and ambition, with the three kingdoms of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden taking shape. Towns appeared that functioned as secular and ecclesiastical administrative centres and market sites, and monetary economies began to emerge based on English and German models.[95] By this time the influx of Islamic silver from the East had been absent for more than a century, and the flow of English silver had come to an end in the mid-11th century.[96] Christianity had taken root in Denmark and Norway with the establishment of dioceses in the 11th century, and the new religion was beginning to organise and assert itself more effectively in Sweden. Foreign churchmen and native elites were energetic in furthering the interests of Christianity, which was now no longer operating only on a missionary footing, and old ideologies and lifestyles were transforming. By 1103, the first archbishopric was founded in Scandinavia, at Lund, Scania, then part of Denmark. The assimilation of the nascent Scandinavian kingdoms into the cultural mainstream of European Christendom altered the aspirations of Scandinavian rulers and of Scandinavians able to travel overseas, and changed their relations with their neighbours. One of the primary sources of profit for the Vikings had been slave-taking from other European peoples. The medieval Church held that Christians should not own fellow Christians as slaves, so chattel slavery diminished as a practice throughout northern Europe. This took much of the economic incentive out of raiding, though sporadic slaving activity continued into the 11th century. Scandinavian predation in Christian lands around the North and Irish Seas diminished markedly. The kings of Norway continued to assert power in parts of northern Britain and Ireland, and raids continued into the 12th century, but the military ambitions of Scandinavian rulers were now directed toward new paths. In 1107, Sigurd I of Norway sailed for the eastern Mediterranean with Norwegian crusaders to fight for the newly established Kingdom of Jerusalem; the kings of Denmark and Sweden participated actively in the Baltic Crusades of the 12th and 13th centuries.[97] A variety of sources illuminate the culture, activities, and beliefs of the Vikings. Although they were generally a non-literate culture that produced no literary legacy, they had an alphabet and described themselves and their world on runestones. Most contemporary literary and written sources on the Vikings come from other cultures that were in contact with them.[98] Since the mid-20th century, archaeological findings have built a more complete and balanced picture of the lives of the Vikings.[99][100] The archaeological record is particularly rich and varied, providing knowledge of their rural and urban settlement, crafts and production, ships and military equipment, trading networks, as well as their pagan and Christian religious artefacts and practices. The most important primary sources on the Vikings are contemporary texts from Scandinavia and regions where the Vikings were active.[101] Writing in Latin letters was introduced to Scandinavia with Christianity, so there are few native documentary sources from Scandinavia before the late 11th and early 12th centuries.[102] The Scandinavians did write inscriptions in runes, but these were usually very short and formulaic. Most contemporary documentary sources consist of texts written in Christian and Islamic communities outside Scandinavia, often by authors who had been negatively affected by Viking activity. Later writings on the Vikings and the Viking Age can also be important for understanding them and their culture, although they need to be treated cautiously. After the consolidation of the church and the assimilation of Scandinavia and its colonies into mainstream medieval Christian culture in the 11th and 12th centuries, native written sources began to appear in Latin and Old Norse. In the Viking colony of Iceland, extraordinary vernacular literature blossomed in the 12th through 14th centuries, and many traditions connected with the Viking Age were written down for the first time in the Icelandic sagas. A literal interpretation of these medieval prose narratives about the Vikings and the Scandinavian past is doubtful, but many specific elements remain worthy of consideration, such as the great quantity of skaldic poetry attributed to court poets of the 10th and 11th centuries, the exposed family trees, the self-images, and the ethical values that are contained in these literary writings. Indirectly, the Vikings have also left a window open onto their language, culture and activities, through many Old Norse place names and words found in their former sphere of influence. Some of these place names and words are still in direct use today, almost unchanged, and shed light on where they settled and what specific places meant to them. Examples include place names like Egilsay (from Eigils ey meaning Eigil's Island), Ormskirk (from Ormr kirkja meaning Orms Church or Church of the Worm), Meols (from merl meaning Sand Dunes), Snaefell (Snow Fell), Ravenscar (Ravens Rock), Vinland (Land of Wine or Land of Winberry), Kaupanger (Market Harbour), Tórshavn (Thor's Harbour), and the religious centre of Odense, meaning a place where Odin was worshipped. Viking influence is also evident in concepts like the present-day parliamentary body of the Tynwald on the Isle of Man. Many common words in everyday English language stem from the Old Norse of the Vikings and give an opportunity to understand their interactions with the people and cultures of the British Isles.[103] In the Northern Isles of Shetland and Orkney, Old Norse completely replaced the local languages and over time evolved into the now extinct Norn language. Some modern words and names only emerge and contribute to our understanding after a more intense research of linguistic sources from medieval or later records, such as York (Horse Bay), Swansea (Sveinn's Isle) or some of the place names in Normandy like Tocqueville (Toki's farm).[104] Linguistic and etymological studies continue to provide a vital source of information on the Viking culture, their social structure and history and how they interacted with the people and cultures they met, traded, attacked or lived with in overseas settlements.[105][106] A lot of Old Norse connections are evident in the modern-day languages of Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Faroese and Icelandic.[107] Old Norse did not exert any great influence on the Slavic languages in the Viking settlements of Eastern Europe. It has been speculated that the reason for this was the great differences between the two languages, combined with the Rus Vikings' more peaceful businesses in these areas, and the fact that they were outnumbered. The Norse named some of the rapids on the Dnieper, but this can hardly be seen from modern names.[108][109] The Norse of the Viking Age could read and write and used a non-standardised alphabet, called runor, built upon sound values. While there are few remains of runic writing on paper from the Viking era, thousands of stones with runic inscriptions have been found where Vikings lived. They are usually in memory of the dead, though not necessarily placed at graves. The use of runor survived into the 15th century, used in parallel with the Latin alphabet. The runestones are unevenly distributed in Scandinavia: Denmark has 250 runestones, Norway has 50 while Iceland has none.[110] Sweden has as many as between 1,700[110] and 2,500[111] depending on the definition. The Swedish district of Uppland has the highest concentration with as many as 1,196 inscriptions in stone, whereas Södermanland is second with 391.[112] The majority of runic inscriptions from the Viking period are found in Sweden. Many runestones in Scandinavia record the names of participants in Viking expeditions, such as the Kjula runestone that tells of extensive warfare in Western Europe and the Turinge Runestone, which tells of a war band in Eastern Europe. Other runestones mention men who died on Viking expeditions. Among them are the England runestones (Swedish: Englandsstenarna), which is a group of about 30 runestones in Sweden which refer to Viking Age voyages to England. They constitute one of the largest groups of runestones that mention voyages to other countries, and they are comparable in number only to the approximately 30 Greece Runestones[113] and the 26 Ingvar Runestones, the latter referring to a Viking expedition to the Middle East.[114] They were engraved in Old Norse with the Younger Futhark.[115] The Jelling stones date from between 960 and 985. The older, smaller stone was raised by King Gorm the Old, the last pagan king of Denmark, as a memorial honouring Queen Thyre.[116] The larger stone was raised by his son, Harald Bluetooth, to celebrate the conquest of Denmark and Norway and the conversion of the Danes to Christianity. It has three sides: one with an animal image; one with an image of the crucified Jesus Christ; and a third bearing the following inscription: King Haraldr ordered this monument made in memory of Gormr, his father, and in memory of Thyrvé, his mother; that Haraldr who won for himself all of Denmark and Norway and made the Danes Christian.[117] Runestones attest to voyages to locations such as Bath,[118] Greece (how the Vikings referred to the Byzantium territories generally),[119] Khwaresm,[120] Jerusalem,[121] Italy (as Langobardland),[122] Serkland (i.e. the Muslim world),[123][124] England[125] (including London[126]), and various places in Eastern Europe. Viking Age inscriptions have also been discovered on the Manx runestones on the Isle of Man. The last known people to use the Runic alphabet were an isolated group of people known as the Elfdalians, that lived in the locality of Älvdalen in the Swedish province of Dalarna. They spoke the language of Elfdalian, the language unique to Älvdalen. The Elfdalian language differentiates itself from the other Scandinavian languages as it evolved much closer to Old Norse. The people of Älvdalen stopped using runes as late as the 1920s. Usage of runes therefore survived longer in Älvdalen than anywhere else in the world.[127] The last known record of the Elfdalian Runes is from 1929; they are a variant of the Dalecarlian runes, runic inscriptions that were also found in Dalarna. Traditionally regarded as a Swedish dialect,[128] but by several criteria closer related to West Scandinavian dialects,[129] Elfdalian is a separate language by the standard of mutual intelligibility.[130][131][132] Although there is no mutual intelligibility, due to schools and public administration in Älvdalen being conducted in Swedish, native speakers are bilingual and speak Swedish at a native level. Residents in the area who speak only Swedish as their sole native language, neither speaking nor understanding Elfdalian, are also common. Älvdalen can be said to have had its own alphabet during the 17th and 18th century. Today there are about 2,000–3,000 native speakers of Elfdalian. There are numerous burial sites associated with Vikings throughout Europe and their sphere of influence—in Scandinavia, the British Isles, Ireland, Greenland, Iceland, Faeroe Islands, Germany, Latvia, Estonia, Finland, Russia, etc. The burial practices of the Vikings were quite varied, from dug graves in the ground, to tumuli, sometimes including so-called ship burials. According to written sources, most of the funerals took place at sea. Funerals involved either burial or cremation, depending on local customs. In the area that is now Sweden, cremations were predominant; in Denmark burial was more common; and in Norway both were common.[133] Viking barrows are one of the primary sources of evidence for circumstances in the Viking Age.[134] The items buried with the dead give some indication as to what was considered important to possess in the afterlife.[135] It is unknown what mortuary services were given to dead children by the Vikings.[136] Some of the most important burial sites for understanding the Vikings include: There have been several archaeological finds of Viking ships of all sizes, providing knowledge of the craftsmanship that went into building them. There were many types of Viking ships, built for various uses; the best-known type is probably the longship.[143] Longships were intended for warfare and exploration, designed for speed and agility, and were equipped with oars to complement the sail, making navigation possible independently of the wind. The longship had a long, narrow hull and shallow draught to facilitate landings and troop deployments in shallow water. Longships were used extensively by the Leidang, the Scandinavian defence fleets. The longship allowed the Norse to go Viking, which might explain why this type of ship has become almost synonymous with the concept of Vikings.[144][145] The Vikings built many unique types of watercraft, often used for more peaceful tasks. The knarr was a dedicated merchant vessel designed to carry cargo in bulk. It had a broader hull, a deeper draught, and a small number of oars (used primarily to manoeuvre in harbours and similar situations). One Viking innovation was the 'beitass', a spar mounted to the sail that allowed their ships to sail effectively against the wind.[146] It was common for seafaring Viking ships to tow or carry a smaller boat to transfer crew and cargo from the ship to shore. Ships were an integral part of Viking culture. They facilitated everyday transportation across seas and waterways, exploration of new lands, raids, conquests, and trade with neighbouring cultures. They also held a major religious importance. People with high status were sometimes buried in a ship along with animal sacrifices, weapons, provisions and other items, as evidenced by the buried vessels at Gokstad and Oseberg in Norway[147] and the excavated ship burial at Ladby in Denmark. Ship burials were also practised by Vikings overseas, as evidenced by the excavations of the Salme ships on the Estonian island of Saaremaa.[148] Well-preserved remains of five Viking ships were excavated from Roskilde Fjord in the late 1960s, representing both the longship and the knarr. The ships were scuttled there in the 11th century to block a navigation channel and thus protect Roskilde, then the Danish capital, from a seaborne assault. The remains of these ships are on display at the Viking Ship Museum in Roskilde. In 2019, archaeologists uncovered two Viking boat graves in Gamla Uppsala. They also discovered that one of the boats still holds the remains of a man, a dog, and a horse, along with other items.[149] This has shed light on the death rituals of Viking communities in the region. Viking society was divided into the three socio-economic classes: thralls, karls and jarls. This is described vividly in the Eddic poem of Rígsþula, which also explains that it was the god Ríg—father of mankind also known as Heimdallr—who created the three classes. Archaeology has confirmed this social structure.[150] In daily life, there were many intermediate positions in the overall social structure and it appears that there was some social mobility between them. These details are unclear, but titles and positions like hauldr, thegn, and landmand, show mobility between the karls and the jarls. Other social structures included the communities of félag in both the civil and the military spheres, to which its members (called félagi) were obliged. A félag could be centred around certain trades, a common ownership of a sea vessel or a military obligation under a specific leader. Members of the latter were referred to as drenge, one of the words for warrior. There were also official communities within towns and villages, the overall defence, religion, the legal system and the Things. Like elsewhere in medieval Europe, most women in Viking society were subordinate to their husbands and fathers and had little political power.[156][157] However, written sources portray free Viking women as having independence and rights. Viking women generally appear to have had more freedom than women elsewhere,[157] as illustrated in the Icelandic Grágás and the Norwegian Frostating laws and Gulating laws.[158] Most free Viking women were housewives, and a woman's standing in society was linked to that of her husband.[157] Marriage gave a woman a degree of economic security and social standing encapsulated in the title húsfreyja (lady of the house). Norse laws assert the housewife's authority over the 'indoor household'. She had the important roles of managing the farm's resources, conducting business, as well as child-rearing, although some of this would be shared with her husband.[159] After the age of 20, an unmarried woman, referred to as maer and mey, reached legal majority and had the right to decide her place of residence and was regarded as her own person before the law.[158] An exception to her independence was the right to choose a husband, as marriages were normally arranged by the family.[160] The groom would pay a bride-price (mundr) to the bride's family, and the bride brought assets into the marriage, as a dowry.[159] A married woman could divorce her husband and remarry.[157][161] Concubinage was also part of Viking society, whereby a woman could live with a man and have children with him without marrying; such a woman was called a frilla.[161] Usually she would be the mistress of a wealthy and powerful man who also had a wife.[156] The wife had authority over the mistresses if they lived in her household.[157] Through her relationship to a man of higher social standing, a concubine and her family could advance socially; although her position was less secure than that of a wife.[156] There was little distinction made between children born inside or outside marriage: both had the right to inherit property from their parents, and there were no \"legitimate\" or \"illegitimate\" children.[161] However, children born in wedlock had more inheritance rights than those born out of wedlock.[159] A woman had the right to inherit part of her husband's property upon his death,[159] and widows enjoyed the same independent status as unmarried women.[161] The paternal aunt, paternal niece and paternal granddaughter, referred to as odalkvinna, all had the right to inherit property from a deceased man.[158] A woman with no husband, sons or male relatives could inherit not only property but also the position as head of the family when her father or brother died. Such a woman was referred to as Baugrygr, and she exercised all the rights afforded to the head of a family clan, until she married, by which her rights were transferred to her new husband.[158] Women had religious authority and were active as priestesses (gydja) and oracles (sejdkvinna).[162] They were active within art as poets (skalder)[162] and rune masters, and as merchants and medicine women.[162] There may also have been female entrepreneurs, who worked in textile production.[157] Women may also have been active within military offices: the tales about shieldmaidens are unconfirmed, but some archaeological finds such as the Birka female Viking warrior may indicate that at least some women in military authority existed.[163] These liberties of the Viking women gradually disappeared after the introduction of Christianity,[164] and from the late 13th century, they are no longer mentioned.[158] Examination of Viking Age burials suggests that women lived longer, and nearly all well past the age of 35, as compared to earlier times. Female graves from before the Viking Age in Scandinavia hold a proportionally large number of remains from women aged 20 to 35, presumably due to complications of childbirth.[165] Examination of skeletal remains also allows the relative health and nutritional status of boys and girls in the past to be reconstructed, using anthropometric techniques. Burials from Scandinavia and other European countries suggest that, in comparison with other societies at the time, female equality was remarkably high in rural Scandinavia. Females in the rural periphery of Nordic countries during the Viking period and the later Middle Ages had relatively high status, resulting in substantial nutritional and health resources being allocated to girls, enabling them to grow stronger and healthier.[166] Scandinavian Vikings were similar in appearance to modern Scandinavians: \"their skin was fair and the hair color varied between blond, dark and reddish\". Genetic studies suggest that people were mostly blond in what is now eastern Sweden, while red hair was mostly found in western Scandinavia.[167] Most Viking men had shoulder-length hair and beards, and slaves (thralls) were usually the only men with short hair.[168] The length varied according to personal preference and occupation. Men involved in warfare, for example, may have had slightly shorter hair and beards for practical reasons. Men in some regions bleached their hair a golden saffron colour.[168] Females also had long hair, with girls often wearing it loose or braided, and married women often wearing it in a bun.[168] The average height is estimated to have been 1.70 m (5 ft 7 in) for men and 1.55 m (5 ft 1 in) for women.[167] The three classes were easily recognisable by their appearance. Men and women of the Jarls were well groomed with neat hairstyles and expressed their wealth and status by wearing expensive clothes (often silk) and well-crafted jewellery like brooches, belt buckles, necklaces and arm rings. Almost all of the jewellery was crafted in specific designs unique to the Norse (see Viking art). Finger rings were seldom used and earrings were not used at all, as they were seen as a Slavic phenomenon. Most karls expressed similar tastes and hygiene, but in a more relaxed and inexpensive way.[150][169] Archaeological finds from Scandinavia and Viking settlements in the British Isles support the idea of the well-groomed and hygienic Viking. Burial with grave goods was a common practice in the Scandinavian world, through the Viking Age and well past the Christianisation of the Norse peoples.[170] Within these burial sites and homesteads, combs, often made from antler, are a common find.[171][172] The manufacturing of such antler combs was common, as at the Viking settlement at Dublin hundreds of examples of combs from the tenth-century have survived, suggesting that grooming was a common practice. The manufacture of such combs was also widespread throughout the Viking world, as examples of similar combs have been found at Viking settlements in Ireland,[173] England,[174] and Scotland.[175] The combs share a common visual appearance as well, with the extant examples often decorated with linear, interlacing, and geometric motifs, or other forms of ornamentation depending on the comb's period and type, but stylistically similar to Viking Age art.[176] All levels of Viking age society appear to have groomed their hair, as hair combs have been found in common graves as well as in aristocratic ones.[177] The sagas tell about the diet and cuisine of the Vikings,[178] but first-hand evidence, like cesspits, kitchen middens and garbage dumps have proved to be of great value and importance. Undigested remains of plants from cesspits at Coppergate in York have provided much information in this respect. Overall, archaeo-botanical investigations have been undertaken increasingly in recent decades, as a collaboration between archaeologists and palaeoethno-botanists. This new approach sheds light on the agricultural and horticultural practices of the Vikings and their cuisine.[179] The combined information from various sources suggests a diverse cuisine and ingredients. Meat products of all kinds, such as cured, smoked and whey-preserved meat,[180] sausages, and boiled or fried fresh meat cuts, were prepared and consumed.[181] There were plenty of seafood, bread, porridges, dairy products, vegetables, fruits, berries and nuts. Alcoholic drinks like beer, mead, bjórr (a strong fruit wine) and, for the rich, imported wine, were served.[182][183] Certain livestock were typical and unique to the Vikings, including the Icelandic horse, Icelandic cattle, a plethora of sheep breeds,[184] the Danish hen and the Danish goose.[185][186] The Vikings in York mostly ate beef, mutton, and pork with small amounts of horse meat. Most of the beef and horse leg bones were found split lengthways, to extract the marrow. The mutton and swine were cut into leg and shoulder joints and chops. The frequent remains of pig skull and foot bones found on house floors indicate that brawn and trotters were also popular. Hens were kept for both their meat and eggs, and the bones of game birds such as black grouse, golden plover, wild ducks, and geese have also been found.[187] Seafood was important, in some places even more so than meat. Whales and walrus were hunted for food in Norway and the northwestern parts of the North Atlantic region, and seals were hunted nearly everywhere. Oysters, mussels and shrimp were eaten in large quantities and cod and salmon were popular fish. In the southern regions, herring was also important.[188][189][190] Milk and buttermilk were popular, both as cooking ingredients and drinks, but were not always available, even at farms.[191] Milk came from cows, goats and sheep, with priorities varying from location to location,[192] and fermented milk products like skyr or surmjölk were produced as well as butter and cheese.[193] Food was often salted and enhanced with spices, some of which were imported like black pepper, while others were cultivated in herb gardens or harvested in the wild. Home grown spices included caraway, mustard and horseradish as evidenced from the Oseberg ship burial[182] or dill, coriander, and wild celery, as found in cesspits at Coppergate in York. Thyme, juniper berry, sweet gale, yarrow, rue and peppercress were also used and cultivated in herb gardens.[179][194] Vikings collected and ate fruits, berries and nuts. Apple (wild crab apples), plums and cherries were part of the diet,[195] as were rose hips and raspberry, wild strawberry, blackberry, elderberry, rowan, hawthorn and various wild berries, specific to the locations.[194] Hazelnuts were an important part of the diet in general and large amounts of walnut shells have been found in cities like Hedeby. The shells were used for dyeing, and it is assumed that the nuts were consumed.[179][191] The invention and introduction of the mouldboard plough revolutionised agriculture in Scandinavia in the early Viking Age and made it possible to farm even poor soils. In Ribe, grains of rye, barley, oat and wheat dated to the 8th century have been found and examined, and are believed to have been cultivated locally.[196] Grains and flour were used for making porridges, some cooked with milk, some cooked with fruit and sweetened with honey, and also various forms of bread. Remains of bread from primarily Birka in Sweden were made of barley and wheat. It is unclear if the Norse leavened their breads, but their ovens and baking utensils suggest that they did.[197] Flax was a very important crop for the Vikings: it was used for oil extraction, food consumption, and most importantly, the production of linen. More than 40% of all known textile recoveries from the Viking Age can be traced as linen. This suggests a much higher actual percentage, as linen is poorly preserved compared to wool, for example.[198] The quality of food for common people was not always particularly high. The research at Coppergate shows that the Vikings in York made bread from wholemeal flour—probably both wheat and rye—but with the seeds of cornfield weeds included. Corncockle (Agrostemma), would have made the bread dark-coloured, but the seeds are poisonous, and people who ate the bread might have become ill. Seeds of carrots, parsnip, and brassicas were also discovered, but they were poor specimens and tend to come from white carrots and bitter tasting cabbages.[195] The rotary querns often used in the Viking Age left tiny stone fragments (often from basalt rock) in the flour, which when eaten wore down the teeth. The effects of this can be seen on skeletal remains from that period.[197] Sports were widely practised and encouraged by the Vikings.[199] Sports that involved weapons training and developing combat skills were popular. These included spear and stone throwing, building and testing physical strength through wrestling (see glima), fist fighting, and stone lifting.[200] In areas with mountains, mountain climbing was practised as a sport. Agility and balance were built and tested by running and jumping for sport, and there is mention of a sport that involved jumping from oar to oar on the outside of a ship's railing as it was being rowed.[201] Swimming was a popular sport[202] – Snorri Sturluson describes three types: diving, long-distance swimming, and a contest in which two swimmers try to dunk one another. Children often participated in some of the sport disciplines,[203] and women have also been mentioned as swimmers, although it is unclear if they took part in competitions. King Olaf Tryggvason was acclaimed for his skill in both mountain climbing and oar-jumping, and reputedly excelled in the art of knife juggling as well. Skiing and ice skating were the principal winter sports, and also provided transport on snow and ice for adults.[199] Horse fighting was practised for sport, although the rules are unclear. It appears to have involved two stallions pitted against each other, within smell and sight of fenced-off mares. Whatever the rules were, the fights often resulted in the death of one of the stallions. Icelandic sources often mention knattleik, a ball game similar to hockey, played with a bat and a small hard ball, usually on a smooth surface of ice. Popular with both adults and children, it was a rugged game that often led to injuries. Knattleik appears to have been played only in Iceland, where it attracted many spectators, as did horse fighting.[199] Hunting was practiced as a sport only in Denmark, where it was not an essential food source. Deer and hares were hunted for meat, along with partridges and sea birds, while foxes were hunted to stop their killing of farm animals and for their furs. Spears, bows, and later crossbows, were the weapons used; stalking was the most common method, although game was also chased with dogs. Numerous kinds of snares and traps were used as well.[199] Archaeological finds and written sources indicate that the Vikings participated in social gatherings and festivities.[204][205] Board games and dice games were a popular pastime. Game boards were made of ornately carved wood, with gaming pieces fashioned mostly from wood, bone, or stone. Pieces were also made of glass, amber, and antler, along with materials such as walrus tusk and ivory from foreign sources. The Vikings played several types of tafl games; hnefatafl, nitavl (nine men's morris) and the less common kvatrutafl.[199] Hnefatafl was probably the oldest type of board game played in medieval Scandinavia.[199] The archaeological record indicates that hnefatafl was popular by the early medieval period, with the Vikings introducing it to England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland.[206] The Ockelbo Runestone shows two men possibly playing hnefatafl,[207] and one saga suggests that dice games involved gambling.[204] Beer and mead were served on festive occasions, where music was played, poetry was recited, and stories were told.[204] Music was considered an art form and musical skill was viewed as suitable for a cultivated man. The Vikings are known to have played instruments including harps, lutes, lyres and fiddles.[199] Elements of a Scandinavian identity and practices were maintained in settler societies, but they could be quite distinct as the groups assimilated into neighbouring societies. Assimilation to the Frankish culture in Normandy for example was rapid.[208] Links to a Viking identity remained longer in the remote islands of Iceland and the Faroes.[208] Knowledge about the arms and armour of the Viking age is based on archaeological finds, pictorial representation, and to some extent on the accounts in the Norse sagas and Norse laws recorded in the 13th century. According to custom, all free Norse men were required to own weapons and were permitted to carry them at all times. These arms indicated a Viking's social status: a wealthy Viking had a complete ensemble of a helmet, shield, mail shirt, and sword. However, swords were rarely used in battle; they were probably not sturdy enough for combat and most likely only used as symbolic or decorative items.[209][210] A typical bóndi (freeman) was more likely to fight with a spear and shield, and most also carried a seax as a utility knife and side-arm. Bows were used in the opening stages of land battles and at sea, but they tended to be considered less \"honourable\" than melee weapons. Vikings were relatively unusual for the time in their use of axes as a main battle weapon. The Húscarls, the elite guard of King Cnut (and later of King Harold II) were armed with two-handed axes that could split shields or metal helmets with ease. The warfare and violence of the Vikings were often motivated and fuelled by their beliefs in Norse religion, focusing on Thor and Odin, the gods of war and death.[211][212] Violence was common in Viking Age Norway. An examination of Norwegian human remains from the Viking Age found that 72% of the examined males and 42% of the examined females had suffered weapon-related injuries. Violence was less common in Viking Age Denmark, where society was more centralized and complex than the clan-based Norwegian society.[213] The Viking warrior is often associated with violent fits of rage and frenzied fighting in modern popular culture, as reflected in meanings attached to the words berserkergang and berserker that would not have been the meanings understood by medieval Norse society.[214] Such a fighting style may have been deployed intentionally by shock troops, and it has been proposed that the berserk-state may have been induced by consuming large amounts of alcohol,[215] or through ingestion of materials with psychoactive properties, such as the solanaceous plant Hyoscyamus niger, as speculated by Karsten Fatur[216] or by consumption of the hallucinogenic mushroom Amanita muscaria, as first hypothesised by the Swedish theologian Samuel Ødman in 1784 and later by the botanist F.C. Schübeler in 1885.[217] The Norwegian battlefield archaeologist Are Skarstein Kolberg asserts that \"...Ödman's hypothesis is not supported by the saga literature or by the archaeological record\",[218] and according to Roderick Dale, there is no evidence for it from the Viking Age or from Old Norse literature.[214] The Vikings established and engaged in extensive trading networks throughout the known world and had a profound influence on the economic development of Europe and Scandinavia.[219][220] Other than in such trading centres as Ribe Hedeby in Denmark, Scandinavia was unfamiliar with the use of coinage. Therefore, its economy was based on bullion; that is, the purity and weight of precious metals used in exchange. Silver was the precious metal most commonly used, although gold was also used. Traders carried small portable scales, enabling them to measure weight precisely, which allowed an accurate medium of exchange, even lacking a regular coinage.[221] Organised trade covered everything from ordinary items in bulk to exotic luxury products. The Viking ship designs, like that of the knarr, were an important factor in their success as merchants.[222] Imported goods from other cultures included:[223] To counter these valuable imports, the Vikings exported a large variety of goods. These goods included:[223] Other exports included weapons, walrus ivory, wax, salt and cod. As one of the more exotic exports, hunting birds were sometimes provided from Norway to the European aristocracy, from the 10th century.[231] Many of these goods were also traded within the Viking world itself, as well as goods such as soapstone and whetstone. Soapstone was traded with the Norse on Iceland and in Jutland, who used it for pottery. Whetstones were traded and used for sharpening weapons, tools and knives.[223] There are indications from Ribe and surrounding areas, that the extensive medieval trade with oxen and cattle from Jutland (see Ox Road), reach as far back as c. 720 AD. This trade satisfied the Vikings' need for leather and meat to some extent, and perhaps hides for parchment production on the European mainland. Wool was also very important as a domestic product for the Vikings, to produce warm clothing for the cold Scandinavian and Nordic climate, and for sails. Sails for Viking ships required large amounts of wool, as evidenced by experimental archaeology. There are archaeological signs of organised textile productions in Scandinavia, reaching as far back as the early Iron Ages. Artisans and craftsmen in the larger towns were supplied with antlers from organised hunting with large-scale reindeer traps in the far north. They were used as raw material for making everyday utensils like combs.[231] In England the Viking Age began dramatically on 8 June 793 when Norsemen destroyed the abbey on the island of Lindisfarne. The devastation of Northumbria's Holy Island shocked and alerted the royal courts of Europe to the Viking presence. \"Never before has such an atrocity been seen\", declared the Northumbrian scholar Alcuin of York.[233] Medieval Christians in Europe were totally unprepared for the Viking incursions and could find no explanation for their arrival and the accompanying suffering they experienced at their hands save the \"Wrath of God\".[234] More than any other single event, the attack on Lindisfarne demonised perception of the Vikings for the next twelve centuries. Not until the 1890s did scholars outside Scandinavia begin to seriously reassess the achievements of the Vikings, recognising their artistry, technological skills, and seamanship.[235] Norse Mythology, sagas, and literature tell of Scandinavian culture and religion through tales of heroic and mythological heroes. Early transmission of this information was primarily oral, and later texts relied on the writings and transcriptions of Christian scholars, including the Icelanders Snorri Sturluson and Sæmundur fróði. Many of these sagas were written in Iceland, and most of them, even if they had no Icelandic provenance, were preserved there after the Middle Ages due to the continued interest of Icelanders in Norse literature and legal codes. The 200-year Viking influence on European history is filled with tales of plunder and colonisation, and the majority of these chronicles came from western European witnesses and their descendants. Less common, although equally relevant, are references to Vikings in chronicles that originated in the east, including the Nestor chronicles, Novgorod chronicles, Ibn Fadlan chronicles, Ibn Rusta chronicles, and brief mentions by Photius, patriarch of Constantinople, regarding the first Viking attack on the Byzantine Empire. Other chroniclers of Viking history include Adam of Bremen, who wrote, in the fourth volume of his Gesta Hammaburgensis Ecclesiae Pontificum, \"[t]here is much gold here (in Zealand), accumulated by piracy. These pirates, which are called wichingi by their own people, and Ascomanni by our own people, pay tribute to the Danish king.\" In 991, the Battle of Maldon between Viking raiders and the inhabitants of Maldon in Essex was commemorated with a poem of the same name. Early modern publications, dealing with what is now called Viking culture, appeared in the 16th century, e.g. Historia de gentibus septentrionalibus (History of the northern people) of Olaus Magnus (1555), and the first edition of the 13th-century Gesta Danorum (Deeds of the Danes), by Saxo Grammaticus, in 1514. The pace of publication increased during the 17th century with Latin translations of the Edda (notably Peder Resen's Edda Islandorum of 1665). In Scandinavia, the 17th-century Danish scholars Thomas Bartholin and Ole Worm and the Swede Olaus Rudbeck used runic inscriptions and Icelandic sagas as historical sources. An important early British contributor to the study of the Vikings was George Hickes, who published his Linguarum vett. septentrionalium thesaurus (Dictionary of the Old Northern Languages) in 1703–05. During the 18th century, British interest and enthusiasm for Iceland and early Scandinavian culture grew dramatically, expressed in English translations of Old Norse texts and in original poems that extolled the supposed Viking virtues. The word \"viking\" was first popularised at the beginning of the 19th century by Erik Gustaf Geijer in his poem, The Viking. Geijer's poem did much to propagate the new romanticised ideal of the Viking, which had little basis in historical fact. The renewed interest of Romanticism in the Old North had contemporary political implications. The Geatish Society, of which Geijer was a member, popularised this myth to a great extent. Another Swedish author who had great influence on the perception of the Vikings was Esaias Tegnér, a member of the Geatish Society, who wrote a modern version of Friðþjófs saga hins frœkna, which became widely popular in the Nordic countries, the United Kingdom, and Germany. Fascination with the Vikings reached a peak during the so-called Viking revival in the late 18th and 19th centuries as a form of Romantic nationalism.[236] In Britain this was called Septentrionalism, in Germany \"Wagnerian\" pathos, and in the Scandinavian countries Scandinavism. Pioneering 19th-century scholarly editions of the Viking Age began to reach a small readership in Britain. Archaeologists began to dig up Britain's Viking past, and linguistic enthusiasts started to identify the Viking-Age origins of rural idioms and proverbs. The new dictionaries of the Old Norse language enabled the Victorians to grapple with the primary Icelandic sagas.[237] Until recently, the history of the Viking Age was largely based on Icelandic sagas, the history of the Danes written by Saxo Grammaticus, the Primary Chronicle, and Cogad Gáedel re Gallaib. Few scholars still accept these texts as reliable sources, as historians now rely more on archaeology and numismatics, disciplines that have made valuable contributions toward understanding the period.[238][citation needed] The romanticised idea of the Vikings constructed in scholarly and popular circles in northwestern Europe in the 19th and early 20th centuries was a potent one, and the figure of the Viking became a familiar and malleable symbol in different contexts in the politics and political ideologies of 20th-century Europe.[239] In Normandy, which had been settled by Vikings, the Viking ship became an uncontroversial regional symbol. In Germany, awareness of Viking history in the 19th century had been stimulated by the border dispute with Denmark over Schleswig-Holstein and the use of Scandinavian mythology by Richard Wagner. The idealised view of the Vikings appealed to Germanic supremacists who transformed the figure of the Viking in accordance with the ideology of a Germanic master race.[240] Building on the linguistic and cultural connections between Norse-speaking Scandinavians and other Germanic groups in the distant past, Scandinavian Vikings were portrayed in Nazi Germany as a pure Germanic type. The cultural phenomenon of Viking expansion was re-interpreted for use as propaganda to support the extreme militant nationalism of the Third Reich, and ideologically informed interpretations of Viking paganism and the Scandinavian use of runes were employed in the construction of Nazi mysticism. Other political organisations of the same ilk, such as the former Norwegian fascist party Nasjonal Samling, similarly appropriated elements of the modern Viking cultural myth in their symbolism and propaganda. Soviet and earlier Slavophile historians emphasised a Slavic rooted foundation in contrast to the Normanist theory of the Vikings conquering the Slavs and founding the Kievan Rus'.[241] They accused Normanist theory proponents of distorting history by depicting the Slavs as undeveloped primitives. In contrast, Soviet historians stated that the Slavs laid the foundations of their statehood long before the Norman/Viking raids, while the Norman/Viking invasions only served to hinder the historical development of the Slavs. They argued that Rus' composition was Slavic and that Rurik and Oleg's success was rooted in their support from within the local Slavic aristocracy.[citation needed]. After the dissolution of the USSR, Novgorod acknowledged its Viking history by incorporating a Viking ship into its logo.[242] Led by the operas of German composer Richard Wagner, such as Der Ring des Nibelungen, Vikings and the Romanticist Viking Revival have inspired many creative works. These have included novels directly based on historical events, such as Frans Gunnar Bengtsson's The Long Ships (which was also released as a 1963 film), and historical fantasies such as the film The Vikings, Michael Crichton's Eaters of the Dead (movie version called The 13th Warrior), and the comedy film Erik the Viking. The vampire Eric Northman, in the HBO TV series True Blood, was a Viking prince before being turned into a vampire. Vikings appear in several books by the Danish American writer Poul Anderson, while British explorer, historian, and writer Tim Severin authored a trilogy of novels in 2005 about a young Viking adventurer Thorgils Leifsson, who travels around the world. In 1962, American comic book writer Stan Lee and his brother Larry Lieber, together with Jack Kirby, created the Marvel Comics superhero Thor, which they based on the Norse god of the same name. The character is featured in the 2011 Marvel Studios film Thor and its sequels. The character also appears in the 2012 film The Avengers and its associated animated series. The appearance of Vikings within popular media and television has seen a resurgence in recent decades, especially with the History Channel's series Vikings (2013), directed by Michael Hirst. The show has a loose grounding in historical facts and sources, but bases itself more so on literary sources, such as fornaldarsaga Ragnars saga loðbrókar, itself more legend than fact, and Old Norse Eddic and Skaldic poetry.[243] The events of the show frequently make references to the Völuspá, an Eddic poem describing the creation of the world, often directly referencing specific lines of the poem in the dialogue.[244] The show portrays some of the social realities of the medieval Scandinavian world, such as slavery[245] and the greater role of women within Viking society.[246] The show also addresses the topics of gender equity in Viking society with the inclusion of shield maidens through the character Lagertha, also based on a legendary figure.[247] Recent archaeological interpretations and osteological analyses of previous excavations of Viking burials have given support to the idea of the Viking woman warrior, namely the excavation and DNA study of the Birka female Viking warrior, within recent years. However, the conclusions remain contentious. Vikings have served as an inspiration for numerous video games, such as The Lost Vikings (1993), Age of Mythology (2002), and For Honor (2017).[248] All three Vikings from The Lost Vikings series—Erik the Swift, Baleog the Fierce, and Olaf the Stout—appeared as a playable hero in the crossover title Heroes of the Storm (2015).[249] The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim (2011) is an action role-playing video game heavily inspired by Viking culture.[250][251] Vikings are the lead focus of the 2020 video game Assassin's Creed Valhalla, which is set in 873 AD, and recounts an alternative history of the Viking invasion of Britain.[252] Modern reconstructions of Viking mythology have shown a persistent influence in late 20th- and early 21st-century popular culture in some countries, inspiring comics, movies, television series, role-playing games, computer games, and music, including Viking metal, a subgenre of heavy metal music. Since the 1960s, there has been rising enthusiasm for historical reenactment. While the earliest groups had little claim for historical accuracy, the seriousness and accuracy of reenactors has increased. The largest such groups include The Vikings and Regia Anglorum, though many smaller groups exist in Europe, North America, New Zealand, and Australia. Many reenactor groups participate in live-steel combat, and a few have Viking-style ships or boats. The Minnesota Vikings of the National Football League are so-named owing to the large Scandinavian population in the US state of Minnesota. During the banking boom of the first decade of the twenty-first century, Icelandic financiers came to be styled as útrásarvíkingar (roughly 'raiding Vikings').[253][254][255] Experimental archaeology of the Viking Age is a flourishing branch and several places have been dedicated to this technique, such as Jorvik Viking Centre in the United Kingdom, Sagnlandet Lejre and Ribe Viking Center [da] in Denmark, Foteviken Museum in Sweden or Lofotr Viking Museum in Norway. Viking-age reenactors have undertaken experimental activities such as iron smelting and forging using Norse techniques at Norstead in Newfoundland for example.[256] On 1 July 2007, the reconstructed Viking ship Skuldelev 2, renamed Sea Stallion,[257] began a journey from Roskilde to Dublin. The remains of that ship and four others were discovered during a 1962 excavation in the Roskilde Fjord. Tree-ring analysis has shown the ship was built of oak in the vicinity of Dublin in about 1042. Seventy multinational crew members sailed the ship back to its home, and Sea Stallion arrived outside Dublin's Custom House on 14 August 2007. The purpose of the voyage was to test and document the seaworthiness, speed, and manoeuvrability of the ship on the rough open sea and in coastal waters with treacherous currents. The crew tested how the long, narrow, flexible hull withstood the tough ocean waves. The expedition also provided valuable new information on Viking longships and society. The ship was built using Viking tools, materials, and much of the same methods as the original ship. Other vessels, often replicas of the Gokstad ship (full- or half-scale) or Skuldelev have been built and tested as well. The Snorri (a Skuldelev I Knarr), was sailed from Greenland to Newfoundland in 1998.[258] Apart from two or three representations of (ritual) helmets—with protrusions that may be either stylised ravens, snakes, or horns—no depiction of the helmets of Viking warriors, and no preserved helmet, has horns. The formal, close-quarters style of Viking combat (either in shield walls or aboard \"ship islands\") would have made horned helmets cumbersome and hazardous to the warrior's own side. Historians therefore believe that Viking warriors did not wear horned helmets; whether such helmets were used in Scandinavian culture for other, ritual purposes, remains unproven. The general misconception that Viking warriors wore horned helmets was partly promulgated by the 19th-century enthusiasts of Götiska Förbundet, founded in 1811 in Stockholm.[259] They promoted the use of Norse mythology as the subject of high art and other ethnological and moral aims. The Vikings were often depicted with winged helmets and in other clothing taken from Classical antiquity, especially in depictions of Norse gods. This was done to legitimise the Vikings and their mythology by associating it with the Classical world, which had long been idealised in European culture. The latter-day mythos created by national romantic ideas blended the Viking Age with aspects of the Nordic Bronze Age some 2,000 years earlier. Horned helmets from the Bronze Age were shown in petroglyphs and appeared in archaeological finds (see Bohuslän and Vikso helmets). They were probably used for ceremonial purposes.[260] Cartoons like Hägar the Horrible and Vicky the Viking, and sports kits such as those of the Minnesota Vikings and Canberra Raiders have perpetuated the myth of the horned helmet.[261] Viking helmets were conical, made from hard leather with wood and metallic reinforcements for regular troops. The iron helmet with mask and mail was for the chieftains, based on the previous Vendel-age helmets from central Sweden. The only original Viking helmet discovered is the Gjermundbu helmet, found in Norway. This helmet is made of iron and has been dated to the 10th century.[262] The image of wild-haired, dirty savages sometimes associated with the Vikings in popular culture is a distorted picture of reality.[9] Viking tendencies were often misreported, and the work of Adam of Bremen, among others, told largely disputable tales of Viking savagery and uncleanliness.[263] There is no evidence that Vikings drank out of the skulls of vanquished enemies. This was a misconception based on a passage in the skaldic poem Krákumál speaking of heroes drinking from ór bjúgviðum hausa (branches of skulls). This was a reference to drinking horns, but was mistranslated in the 17th century[264] as referring to the skulls of the slain.[265] Margaryan et al. 2020 analysed 442 Viking world individuals from various archaeological sites in Europe.[16] They were found to be closely related to modern Scandinavians. The Y-DNA composition of the individuals in the study was also similar to that of modern Scandinavians. The most common Y-DNA haplogroup was I1 (95 samples), followed by R1b (84 samples) and R1a, especially (but not exclusively) of the Scandinavian R1a-Z284 subclade (61 samples). The study showed what many historians have hypothesised: that it was common for Norseman settlers to marry foreign women. Some individuals from the study, such as those found in Foggia, displayed typical Scandinavian Y-DNA haplogroups but also southern European autosomal ancestry, suggesting that they were the descendants of Viking settler males and local women. The five individual samples from Foggia were likely Normans. The same pattern of a combination of Scandinavian Y-DNA and local autosomal ancestry is seen in other samples from the study, for example Varangians buried near lake Ladoga and Vikings in England, suggesting that Viking men had married into local families in those places too.[16] The study found evidence of a Swedish influx into Estonia and Finland; and Norwegian influx into Ireland, Iceland and Greenland during the Viking Age. However, the authors commented \"Viking Age Danish-like ancestry in the British Isles cannot be distinguished from that of the Angles and Saxons, who migrated in the fifth to sixth centuries AD from Jutland and northern Germany\".[16] Margaryan et al. 2020 examined the skeletal remains of 42 individuals from the Salme ship burials in Estonia. The skeletal remains belonged to warriors killed in battle who were later buried together with numerous valuable weapons and armour. DNA testing and isotope analysis revealed that the men came from central Sweden.[16] Female descent studies show evidence of Norse descent in areas closest to Scandinavia, such as the Shetland and Orkney islands.[266] Inhabitants of lands farther away show most Norse descent in the male Y-chromosome lines.[267] A specialised genetic and surname study in Liverpool showed marked Norse heritage: up to 50% of males of families that lived there before the years of industrialisation and population expansion.[268] High percentages of Norse inheritance—tracked through the R-M420 haplotype—were also found among males in the Wirral and West Lancashire.[269] This was similar to the percentage of Norse inheritance found among males in the Orkney Islands.[270] Recent research suggests that the Celtic warrior Somerled, who drove the Vikings out of western Scotland and was the progenitor of Clan Donald, may have been of Viking descent, a member of haplogroup R-M420.[271] Margaryan et al. 2020 examined an elite warrior burial from Bodzia (Poland) dated to 1010–1020 AD. The cemetery in Bodzia is exceptional in terms of Scandinavian and Kievian Rus links. The Bodzia man (sample VK157, or burial E864/I) was not a simple warrior from the princely retinue, but he belonged to the princely family himself. His burial is the richest one in the whole cemetery. Moreover, strontium analysis of his teeth enamel shows he was not local. It is assumed that he came to Poland with the Prince of Kiev, Sviatopolk the Accursed, and met a violent death in combat. This corresponds to the events of 1018 AD when Sviatopolk himself disappeared after having retreated from Kiev to Poland. It cannot be excluded that the Bodzia man was Sviatopolk himself, as the genealogy of the Rurikids at this period is extremely sketchy and the dates of birth of many princes of this dynasty may be quite approximative. The Bodzia man carried haplogroup I1-S2077 and had both Scandinavian ancestry and Russian admixture.[16][272] Gerlög and Inga: Färentuna Runestones, Hillersjö stone, Snottsta and Vreta stones Runic transliteration and transcription",

                "content": "The Vikings were Scandinavian people from Northern Europe who were known as great seamen and warriors. From the 8th to the 11th centuries they travelled to Europe in their long ships. They attacked and later settled in areas that are now modern Great Britain, Germany, France, Spain, and Italy.[1] The people of the far north, later called Vikings, were first noticed by the Romans around the year 100 BC.[a][6] This is when the Cimbri and the Teutons moved into southern Gaul.[6] The Romans believed these war-like tribes came from Jutland. But the Romans suspected they were only a part of a greater threat located further north.[6] The Roman historians Jordanes described the destructive Ostrogoths and Visigoths as having come from Gotland.[6] The Frankish Empire that came after them in Gaul became more and more aware of the northern threat.[6] As the later Carolingian Empire expanded into northern Germany they came into contact with the Danish people. This is when the Vikings appear in written history.[6] The first recorded raid in Britain was at Lindisfarne in 793.[7] Why the Vikings began raiding is not clear. A popular theory is the populations had grown to the point there was not enough food to feed everyone.[8] The earliest raiders did not seem to want to move out of Scandinavia. They turned to looting, then returning home. These raids were possible because the Vikings were master boat builders. They made flat bottomed boats ideal for journeys up rivers. Many monasteries were on the rivers and were raided. [9] Raiding was easy. It became more and more popular among the Vikings.[8] Three different groups of Vikings took different, sometimes overlapping, routes.[8] Europeans were scared of the Vikings because of their strong weapons, swift attacks, and cruel fighting tactics. They were known for their bad treatment of women, children and monks in the places where they fought. When the Vikings came to England, the English kings paid them to leave the country. The Vikings took their money and sometimes fought them anyway. These payments were called Danegeld. From the 9th century to 1066, when the Duke of Normandy, who became King William I of England, conquered it, Danish and Norwegian Vikings ruled large parts of England. Because of their longships, which could float in 4 feet (1.3m) of water, the Vikings were able to make their way up rivers and land deep inside a country. They sailed up the River Shannon in Ireland and built a harbour 60 miles (100 km) from the coast. There was a difference in who led Viking raids. In the 9th century, Viking Age raids were led by men who may have been exiles in their own countries.[10] The later Viking raids in the late 10th century and early 11th century and were led by Kings.[10] Some of the early leaders tried to become kings with the riches they plundered from Europe and Russia. Some were successful but most were not.[10] The Vikings were called Rus' by the peoples east of the Baltic Sea.[11] The Vikings who settled in Kiev formed the first Russian state.[11] The Vikings (Rus') who served the Byzantine Emperors were called Varangians. They became the personal bodyguards to the Emperor and were called the Varangian Guard.[12] The Vikings travelled through Russia, the Mediterranean Sea, southern Europe, northern Africa and south-western Asia. Some Vikings sailed across the Atlantic Ocean via Iceland and Greenland and may have explored places in North America. The ruins of a Viking settlement have been found at L'Anse-aux-Meadows, Newfoundland.[13][14] Archaeologists used radiocarbon dating to find out how old the settlement was. Their tests gave them a range of dates from about AD 700 to about AD 1000.[15] Some English words, and many place names, come from the Scandinavian and Viking language (Norse). For example, the words skirt and shirt came from the word skyrta, meaning a tunic. As English changed, the semantics altered to give us the separate words 'skirt' and 'shirt' we know today. Skin came from the Norse word skinn (which meant to strip the meat off something). Some place-names in the areas the Vikings conquered are still in use.[16] For example, in Yorkshire places ending with thwaite meant a clearing[17] and dale meant a valley. The word thorpe meant new village, such as Scunthorpe.[18] The Anglo-Saxons called the Vikings pagans. They worshiped many gods. Viking gods belonged to two groups of gods in Norse mythology, the Aesir and the Vanir.[19] The pagan Vikings were exposed to Christianity from the beginning of the Viking Age.[20] They were surrounded by Christian countries. Early Christian missionaries were either enslaved or put to death.[21] The Vikings came into contact with Christianity when they raided other areas around them.[20] Viking raids produced many Christian slaves who were brought back to Scandinavia. They called Christians \"Cross-men\" because of the cross in their worship.[22] Many Vikings used Thors hammer as their religious symbol. When Vikings settled in Christian areas they converted to Christianity. There are still headstones in England with both a cross and a hammer. Perhaps they thought it was better to be safe than sorry.[20] That, or the more gods the better. As some Vikings turned from raiding to trading they found a nominal (in name only) profession of Christianity to be helpful.[23] Scandinavia, their homeland, was slower to change to the Christian religion. By the mid-11th century most of Norway and Denmark had converted. Sweden was converted by the mid-12th century.[20] The Viking's religion affected Christianity as well. The pagan celebration of Yuletide became Christmas.[22] Priests blessing the fields took the place of pagan fertility rites of spring held to make sure there was a good harvest.[22] Norse kept their \"farm gods\" well after Christianity just to make sure they were protected. Santa Claus owes much of his legend to the Norse god Odin. With his snow-white beard he traveled the midwinter sky on his eight-footed steed Sleipnir visiting his people with gifts. He became Father Christmas. Blended with the Christian Saint Nicholas he became Santa Claus. [22] In the late 19th century Richard Wagner and other artists in the Romantic period made operas and other artwork about ancient Germanic culture. They liked the Vikings because they were not Greeks or Romans. They came up with the idea of Vikings wearing fur clothes and helmets with wings or horns on them and drinking out of hollowed-out animal horns. Some ancient Germans wore helmets with horns on them, but real Vikings did not. Wagner and his partners dressed the actors in the opera Ring des Nibelungen so they would look like ancient Germans and so the audience would feel like modern Germans came from medieval Vikings.[24][25]",

From here they travelled great distances, mainly by sea and river – as far as North America to the west, Russia to the east, Lapland to the north and the Mediterranean World (Constantinople) and Iraq (Baghdad) to the south. We know about them through archaeology, poetry, sagas and proverbs, treaties, and the writings of people in Europe and Asia whom they encountered. They left very little written evidence themselves. As well as warriors, they were skilled craftsmen and boat-builders, adventurous explorers and wide-ranging traders. See Viking trade and Viking travel. What we call the Viking Age, and their relationship with England, lasted from approximately 800 to 1150 AD – though Scandinavian adventurers, merchants and mercenaries were of course active before and after this period. Their expansion during the Viking Age took the form of warfare, exploration, settlement and trade. During this period, around 200,000 people left Scandinavia to settle in other lands, mainly Newfoundland (Canada), Greenland, Iceland, Ireland, England, Scotland, the islands around Britain, France (where they became the Normans), Russia and Sicily. They traded extensively with the Muslim world and fought as mercenaries for the Byzantine emperors of Constantinople (Istanbul). However, by the end of the 11th century the great days of Viking expansion were over. Vikings in Britain: background and legacy Historians disagree about the origin of the word Viking. In Old Norse the word means a pirate raid, from either vikja (to move swiftly) or vik (an inlet). This captures the essence of the Vikings, fast-moving sailors who used the water as their highway to take them across the northern Atlantic, around the coasts of Europe and up its rivers to trade, raid or settle. In their poetry they call the sea 'the whale road'. Anglo-Saxon writers called them Danes, Norsemen, Northmen, the Great Army, sea rovers, sea wolves, or the heathen. From around 860AD onwards, Vikings stayed, settled and prospered in Britain, becoming part of the mix of people who today make up the British nation. Our names for days of the week come mainly from Norse gods – Tuesday from Tiw or Týr, Wednesday from Woden (Odin), Thursday from Thor and so on. Many of their other words have also become part of English, for example egg, steak, law, die, bread, down, fog, muck, lump and scrawny. To see questions children have asked about the Vikings, see our Viking starter lesson. A short history of the Vikings in Britain In 793 came the first recorded Viking raid, where 'on the Ides of June the harrying of the heathen destroyed God's church on Lindisfarne, bringing ruin and slaughter' (The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle). These ruthless pirates continued to make regular raids around the coasts of England, looting treasure and other goods, and capturing people as slaves. Monasteries were often targeted, for their precious silver or gold chalices, plates, bowls and crucifixes. Gradually, the Viking raiders began to stay, first in winter camps, then settling in land they had seized, mainly in the east and north of England. See The Vikings settle down. Outside Anglo-Saxon England, to the north of Britain, the Vikings took over and settled Iceland, the Faroes and Orkney, becoming farmers and fishermen, and sometimes going on summer trading or raiding voyages. Orkney became powerful, and from there the Earls of Orkney ruled most of Scotland. To this day, especially on the north-east coast, many Scots still bear Viking names. To the west of Britain, the Isle of Man became a Viking kingdom. The island still has its Tynwald, or ting-vollr (assembly field), a reminder of Viking rule. In Ireland, the Vikings raided around the coasts and up the rivers. They founded the cities of Dublin, Cork and Limerick as Viking strongholds. Meanwhile, back in England, the Vikings took over Northumbria, East Anglia and parts of Mercia. In 866 they captured modern York (Viking name: Jorvik) and made it their capital. They continued to press south and west. The kings of Mercia and Wessex resisted as best they could, but with little success until the time of Alfred of Wessex, the only king of England to be called ‘the Great'. King Alfred and the Danes King Alfred ruled from 871-899 and after many trials and tribulations (including the famous story of the burning of the cakes!) he defeated the Vikings at the Battle of Edington in 878. After the battle the Viking leader Guthrum converted to Christianity. In 886 Alfred took London from the Vikings and fortified it. The same year he signed a treaty with Guthrum. The treaty partitioned England between Vikings and English. The Viking territory became known as the Danelaw. It comprised the north-west, the north-east and east of England. Here, people would be subject to Danish laws. Alfred became king of the rest. Alfred's grandson, Athelstan, became the first true King of England. He led an English victory over the Vikings at the Battle of Brunaburh in 937, and his kingdom for the first time included the Danelaw. In 954, Eirik Bloodaxe, the last Viking king of York, was killed and his kingdom was taken over by English earls. See Egils Saga. Later Viking raids and rulers However, the Viking raiding did not stop – different Viking bands made regular raiding voyages around the coasts of Britain for over 300 years after 793. In 991, during the reign of Æthelred 'the Unready' ('ill-advised'), Olaf Tryggvason's Viking raiding party defeated the Anglo-Saxon defenders (recorded in the poem The Battle of Maldon), with Æthelred responding by paying 'Danegeld' in an attempt to buy off the Vikings. So the Vikings were not permanently defeated – England was to have four Viking kings between 1013 and 1042. The greatest of these was King Cnut, who was king of Denmark as well as of England. A Christian, he did not force the English to obey Danish law; instead he recognised Anglo-Saxon law and customs. He worked to create a north Atlantic empire that united Scandinavia and Britain. Unfortunately, he died at the age of 39, and his sons had short, troubled reigns. The final Viking invasion of England came in 1066, when Harald Hardrada sailed up the River Humber and marched to Stamford Bridge with his men. His battle banner was called Land-waster. The English king, Harold Godwinson, marched north with his army and defeated Hardrada in a long and bloody battle. The English had repelled the last invasion from Scandinavia. However, immediately after the battle, King Harold heard that William of Normandy had landed in Kent with yet another invading army. With no time to rest, Harold's army marched swiftly back south to meet this new threat. The exhausted English army fought the Normans at the Battle of Hastings on 14th October, 1066. At the end of a long day's fighting the Normans had won, King Harold was dead, and William was the new king of England. The irony is that William was of Viking descent: his great-great-great-grandfather Rollo was a Viking who in 911 had invaded Normandy in northern France. His people had become French over time, but in one sense this final successful invasion of England was another Viking one.

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. LAS VEGAS (AP) Ahead most of the game, including by double digits in the fourth quarter, the Atlanta Falcons were just trying to hold on at the end. The Raiders had two passes into the end zone. Two passes to steal a victory and hand Atlanta a considerable setback to its playoff hopes. Desmond Ridder's first attempt was incomplete and his second was intercepted by Jessie Bates III, allowing Atlanta to escape Las Vegas with a 15-9 victory Monday night and keep pace in the NFC South. The Falcons (7-7) ended a four-game losing streak to remain a game behind the first-place Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Atlanta owns the head-to-head tiebreaker in a close race with three games remaining. “That’s where you want to be, and that’s exactly where we’re at,” Falcons coach Raheem Morris said. “We’ve got a short week. We’ve got to get back in the lab. We’ve got to find ways to fix what we did wrong tonight and come out and get another win.” Atlanta has a favorable remaining schedule, facing two teams with a combined five wins that sandwich a trip to 9-5 Washington. Tampa Bay has a similar finishing stretch. A potential No. 1 overall draft pick rather than playoff scenarios make up most of the conversation regarding Las Vegas (2-12). The Raiders lost their 10th consecutive game, the NFL's longest active skid, and are tied with the New York Giants for the league's worst record. It is the fifth-longest skid in Raiders history, and worst since dropping 16 straight a decade ago. Kirk Cousins entered with no touchdown passes and eight interceptions over his previous four starts, raising questions about whether rookie Michael Penix Jr. would take over at quarterback for Atlanta. Morris stuck by Cousins - who signed a four-year, $180 million contract this year - over the eighth pick in the NFL draft. Cousins did little to assuage concerns about his play, passing for just 112 yards with an interception. His 30-yard pass to a wide-open Drake London with 14 seconds left in the first quarter to put Atlanta ahead 7-0 was his first touchdown toss since firing three of them Nov. 3 in a 27-21 victory over the Dallas Cowboys. “He's got to play better,” Morris said. Cousins didn't disagree. “It's stating the obvious,\" he said. The Falcons got the rest of their points on two field goals from Younghoe Koo and a safety by defensive lineman Zach Harrison. Bijan Robinson rushed for 125 yards and London caught three passes for 53 yards to give him 219 career receptions. London passed Calvin Ridley's 217 catches for most in Falcons history over a player's first three seasons. Atlanta prevented Ridder from putting a dent in its playoff plans. Ridder, who started 13 games for the Falcons last season before he was traded to Arizona, was stymied most of the night in his first start this season. In replacing Aidan O'Connell, inactive because of a bruised left knee, Ridder passed for 208 yards with a touchdown and two interceptions. Ridder again downplayed the emotions of playing against his former team, emphasizing this was more about the Raiders than him. “We were never able to find a rhythm until late in the game,” he said. “By then, it's too little, too late.” The injury-riddled Raiders gained just 249 yards, and they have trailed by double digits in all 14 games this season. O'Connell wasn't the only player missing. Defensive end Maxx Crosby announced Saturday he would be undergoing season-ending ankle surgery, and the Raiders were without about half their starting lineup on defense. Las Vegas also lost running back Sincere McCormick, who had recently become the starter, to an ankle injury early in the second quarter. Even so, the Raiders nearly rallied to win. Ridder's 5-yard touchdown pass to running back Ameer Abdullah with 2:54 left brought Las Vegas within six. The extra point was blocked, the third time the Falcons got their hands on a Raiders punt or kick. After getting the ball back for a last-gasp drive, the Raiders converted a fourth-and-8 from their 34-yard line to eventually set up Ridder's two shots into the end zone. “Desmond did a good job throwing it up there,” Raiders coach Antonio Pierce said. “It’s a jump-ball situation.” Falcons: Host the New York Giants on Sunday.

                "content": "Digital Team Reporter The Raiders fell 15-9 to the Atlanta Falcons on Monday Night Football, dropping the team to 2-12 on the season. Both defenses started strong, making pivotal plays in the first quarter of action, as Falcons cornerback Dee Alford forced a fumble on the Raiders' opening drive. Atlanta's first possession came to an end with a third-down sack by rookie Jonah Laulu, the first of his NFL career. A tipped punt placed the Falcons in good field possession to put the first points on the board. Quarterback Kirk Cousins pump faked on a screen, resulting in Drake London sprinting down the right side to catch a 30-yard touchdown pass. Daniel Carlson responded with a 52-yard field goal to make it 7-3. The Raiders defense forced a stop which lead to a fair catch on the 3-yard line. However, two plays later, Ameer Abdullah was taken down in Atlanta's end zone for a safety, giving the Falcons a 9-3 lead going into halftime. Coming out of the gate in the second half, Robert Spillane jumped in front of pass to Charlie Woerner for his second interception of the season. But the Raiders offense still couldn't find a way to put points on the board. The Falcons' special teams unit continued to deliver blows. Another blocked punt put the Falcons at the Raiders 37-yard line, resulting in Younghoe Koo knocking in a 40-yard field goal. The Falcons kicker would notch another field goal from 48 yards at the top of the fourth quarter to take a 15-3 lead. As the clock ran down, the Raiders still found a way to stay in the game. The offense drove the ball down the field 68 yards in under three minutes, scoring on a 5-yard pass from Desmond Ridder to Abdullah. Down six with 1:50 left in the game, the Raiders had a chance to mount a game-winning drive. However, three penalties prevented the team from advancing down the field. On the final play, Ridder launched the ball to the end zone on a second Hail Mary attempt that ultimately was picked off by the Falcons. While the Raiders defense only allowed one touchdown, while recording three sacks and a turnover, they allowed Bijan Robinson to run roughshod for 125 yards. Ridder, who made his first start with the Raiders in place of an injured Aidan O'Connell, went 23-of-39 for 208 yards, a touchdown and one interception against his former team. The Silver and Black will now turn their attention to facing the Jacksonville Jaguars on a short week back at home in Allegiant Stadium next Sunday.

                "content": "More on the Meaning of Patriot The word patriot signifies a person who loves their country and is ready to boldly support and defend it. That meaning has endured since the word's arrival in English in the 16th century, but it has not marched through the years unchallenged. Ultimately derived from Greek patrios, meaning \"of one’s father,\" patriot entered English via French patriote—meaning \"fellow countryman\" or \"compatriot\"—during a time of political unrest in western Europe that was characterized by infighting among fellow countrymen—especially among those of the Protestant and Catholic faiths. For much of the 17th century, words like good were attached to patriot to distinguish patriots who shared both a love of country and a common allegiance from those having opposing beliefs and loyalties: to be deemed a \"good patriot\" was to be a lover of country who agreed on political and/or religious matters with whoever was doing the deeming. The Catholiques were knowne good Patriots under our former Kings. — Henry Hammond, A view of some exceptions which have been made by a Romanist to the Lord Viscount Falkland's discourse…, 1646 Patriot was used to mean \"good patriot\" without modification more frequently by the end of the 17th century, but it tended to apply to a supporter of the ruling monarchy. A Patriot, both the King and Country serves; Prerogative, and Privilege preserves. — John Dryden, Fables, Ancient and Modern, 1700 Another effect of the tumultuous times was the development of a derogatory use of patriot to refer to hypocritical patriots: people who claimed devotion to one's country and government but whose actions or beliefs belied such devotion. This ultimately led to the discrediting of the loyalty and steadfastness associated with the word patriot. The years leading up to the American Revolutionary War further propagated the notion of patriot as a name for a seditious rebel against the monarchy. American writers of the 18th century, however, heartily embraced the word to define the colonists who took action against British control. As tensions continued to escalate, a new meaning of patriot came to the forefront, referring to a person who advocates or promotes the independence of their land or people from the country of which they are a colony. Benjamin Franklin provides an early record of this use. It should be no Wonder … if among so many Thousand true Patriots as New England contains there should be found even Twelve Judases. — Benjamin Franklin, letter, 7 July 1773 In the end, the patriots won the war and, centuries after America’s Declaration of Independence, patriot has held its place of honor in the English language as the meritorious name for the brave men and women of the armed forces who defend the rights and freedoms of their country. Stripped of all past disparagement, the word has returned to its original meaning: \"one who loves his or her country.\" Today, active fighting or resistance is not a requirement to being a patriot: a person only needs a strong sense of love for one’s country.

                "content": "The Philadelphia Eagles are a professional American football team based in Philadelphia. The Eagles compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the National Football Conference (NFC) East division. The team plays its home games at Lincoln Financial Field in the South Philadelphia Sports Complex.[7] The franchise was established in 1933 as a replacement for the bankrupt Frankford Yellow Jackets when a group led by Bert Bell secured the rights to an NFL franchise in Philadelphia. Since their formation, the Eagles have appeared in the playoffs 31 times, won 15 division titles (including 12 in the NFC East), appeared in four pre-merger NFL Championship Games, winning three of them (1948, 1949, and 1960), and appeared in four Super Bowls, winning Super Bowl LII at the end of the 2017 season. As of 2023, 13 individuals affiliated with the Eagles have been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame: Chuck Bednarik, Bell, Bob Brown, Harold Carmichael, Brian Dawkins, Sonny Jurgensen, Greasy Neale, Tommy McDonald, Pete Pihos, Norm Van Brocklin, Steve Van Buren, Dick Vermeil, and Reggie White. The team's intense rivalry with the New York Giants has been ranked the top rivalry of all time by NFL Network, the fourth-best NFL rivalry by Sports Illustrated,[8] and one of the fiercest and best-known football rivalries by ESPN.[9] The Eagles' bitter rivalry with the Dallas Cowboys has become more high-profile and intense since the 1960s, and the team has a historic rivalry with the Washington Commanders. Their rivalry with the Pittsburgh Steelers dates back to 1933 and is known as the \"Battle of Pennsylvania\".[10] The Philadelphia Eagles rank among the best teams in the NFL for attendance and have sold out every home game continuously since the 1999 season.[11][12] The Eagles are owned by Jeffrey Lurie. As of 2023, the Eagles franchise value has increased to $4.9 billion, according to Forbes, making them the 10th-most valuable team in the NFL.[13] The Frankford Athletic Association was organized in May 1899 in the parlor of the Suburban Club. The cost of purchasing a share in the association was $10. However, there were also contributing memberships, ranging from $1 to $2.50, made available to the general public. The Association was a community-based non-profit organization of local residents and businesses. In keeping with its charter, which stated that \"all profits shall be donated to charity\", all of the team's excess income was donated to local charitable institutions. The original Frankford Athletic Association apparently disbanded prior to the 1909 football season. Several of the original players from the 1899 football team kept the team together, and they became known as Loyola Athletic Club. In keeping with Yellow Jackets tradition, they carried the \"Frankford\" name again in 1912, to become the Frankford Athletic Association. In the early 1920s, the Frankford Athletic Association's Yellow Jackets gained the reputation as being one of the best independent football teams in the nation. In 1922, Frankford absorbed the Philadelphia City Champion team, the Union Quakers of Philadelphia. That year, Frankford captured the unofficial championship of Philadelphia. During the 1922 and 1923 seasons, the Yellow Jackets compiled a 6–2–1 record against teams from the National Football League. This led to the Association being granted an NFL franchise in 1924, thus becoming the Frankford Yellow Jackets. In spite of winning the NFL championship in 1926, midway through the 1931 season, the Yellow Jackets went bankrupt and were forced to cease operations.[14] After more than a year of searching for a suitable replacement for the Yellow Jackets in the lucrative Philadelphia market, the National Football League granted an expansion franchise to an ownership group headed by Bert Bell and Lud Wray, who were also awarded the liquidated assets of the defunct Yellow Jackets organization. The Bell–Wray group had to pay an entry fee of $3,500, or roughly US$67,000 in inflation-adjusted 2022 dollars, and assumed a total debt of $11,000 the Yellow Jackets owed to three other NFL franchises.[15] Drawing inspiration from the Blue Eagle logo of the National Recovery Administration, a centerpiece of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal policies,[15] Bell and Wray named their new franchise the Philadelphia Eagles. While it could seem as if the Yellow Jackets simply rebranded as the Eagles, both the Eagles organization and NFL officially regard the teams as two separate entities. Not only was there no Philadelphia NFL team for a season and a half, but almost no players from the 1931 Yellow Jackets appeared on the Eagles' first roster. In the 1933 NFL season, the Eagles were one of three teams, along with the Pittsburgh Pirates (now the Pittsburgh Steelers) and the now-defunct Cincinnati Reds, to join the NFL as expansion teams. Wray became the Eagles' first head coach after being persuaded to assume the position by Bell, his former teammate at Penn. The Eagles originally intended to play their home games at Shibe Park, which was the home of the Philadelphia Athletics professional baseball in Philadelphia. When negotiations for use of Shibe Park fell through, however, the Eagles struck a deal with the Athletics' crosstown rival, the Philadelphia Phillies, to begin playing at the Baker Bowl. The Eagles played their first game on October 15, 1933, against the New York Giants at the Polo Grounds in New York City, and lost the game 56–0.[16] The Eagles struggled over the course of their first decade, never winning more than four games in any of their first ten seasons. Their best finish was in 1934, the second season for the Eagles, when they tied for third in the East. The Eagles' early rosters largely consisted of former Penn, Temple, and Villanova players who played for the Eagles for a few years before going on to other things. In 1935, Bell proposed an annual college draft to equalize talent across the league. The draft was a revolutionary concept in professional sports. Having teams select players in inverse order of their finish in the standings, a practice still followed today, strove to increase fan interest by guaranteeing that even the worst teams would have the opportunity for annual infusions of the best college talent.[17] Between 1927, when the NFL changed from a sprawling Midwestern-based association to a narrower, major-market league, and 1934, three teams, the Chicago Bears, New York Giants, and Green Bay Packers, won all but one title with the exception of the Providence Steam Roller, which won in 1928. By 1936, the Eagles suffered significant financial losses and were sold through a public auction. Bert Bell was the only bidder and became the sole owner of the team. Wray refused a reduction in his salary and left the team. Bell assumed the head coaching position and led the team to a record of 1–11, last place in the league.[18] From 1936 to 1939, the Eagles played at Municipal Stadium in South Philadelphia. In 1940, Bell balked at a 66% rent increase plus 10% of the gate receipts proposed by the City of Philadelphia for use of Municipal Stadium and signed a lease for Shibe Park, which was renamed Connie Mack Stadium in 1954. At Connie Mack Stadium, the Eagles were also able to play night games, since lights were installed at the stadium the year before.[19] In the 1941 season, the Eagles played their home opener at Municipal Stadium, and then moved to Shibe Park.[20][21][22] To accommodate football at Shibe Park during the winter, management erected stands in right field, parallel to 20th Street. Some 20-feet high, these east stands included 22 rows of seats. The goalposts stood along the first base line and in left field. The uncovered east stands enlarged the park's capacity to over 39,000, but the Eagles rarely drew more than 25,000 to 30,000.[23] The Eagles finished the 1937 season 2–8–1 and continued to struggle over the next three seasons.[24] In December 1940, Bell intervened to stop the sale of Art Rooney's Steelers to Alexis Thompson,[25] and Rooney then acquired half of Bell's interest in the Eagles.[26] In a series of events known as the Pennsylvania Polka,[25] Rooney and Bell exchanged their entire Eagles roster and their territorial rights in Philadelphia to Thompson for his entire Steelers roster and his rights in Pittsburgh.[27] Rooney provided assistance to Bell by rewarding him with a 20% commission on the sale of the Steelers.[28] Bell became the Steelers' head coach and Rooney became the Steelers' general manager.[29] After assuming ownership, Thompson promptly hired Greasy Neale as the team's head coach. During the first years under Neale, the Eagles' struggles continued, and they finished the 1941 season with a 2–8–1 record.[30] In the 1942 season, there was no improvement as the team finished the season 2–9.[31] In 1943, with player shortages stemming from the U.S. entry engagement in World War II, it became difficult to fill the roster, and the team merged with the Steelers to form the \"Phil-Pitt Eagles\", known as the Steagles.[32] Greasy Neale continued to coach the team along with Steelers head coach Walt Kiesling. The team finished the 1943 season with a 5–4–1 record, and the merger, which was never intended to be a permanent arrangement, was dissolved at the season's end.[33] In 1944, the Eagles, led by head coach Greasy Neale and running back Steve Van Buren, had their first winning season in team history.[34] After two second-place finishes in 1945 and 1946, the team reached the NFL Championship game for the first time in 1947. Van Buren, Pete Pihos, and Bosh Pritchard fought valiantly, but the young team lost to the Chicago Cardinals, 28–21 at Comiskey Park in Chicago.[35] Undeterred, the young team rebounded in 1948 to return to the NFL Championship game. With home field advantage and a blinding snowstorm on their side, the Eagles won their first NFL Championship against the Chicago Cardinals by a score of 7–0.[36] The only score came in the fourth quarter when Steve Van Buren ran for a five-yard touchdown.[37] Because of the severe weather, few fans witnessed the joyous occasion. Prior to the start of the 1949 season, the Eagles were sold by Thompson to a syndicate of 100 buyers, known as the \"Happy Hundred\", each of whom paid $3,000 for a share of the team. While the leader of the \"Happy Hundred\" was noted Philadelphia businessman James P. Clark, one unsung investor was Leonard Tose.[38] In 1949, the Eagles returned to the NFL Championship game for a third consecutive year. The Eagles were favored by a touchdown,[39][40][41] and won 14–0 for their second consecutive title game shutout. Running back Steve Van Buren rushed for 196 yards on 31 carries for the Eagles, and their defense held the Rams to just 21 yards on the ground.[42] Chuck Bednarik was selected as the first overall pick in the 1949 NFL draft. An All-American lineman/linebacker from the University of Pennsylvania, Bednarik would go on to become one of the greatest and most beloved players in Eagles history. In 1950, the Eagles opened the season against the AAFC champion Cleveland Browns, who, along with two other AAFC franchises, had just joined the NFL. The Eagles were expected to make short work of the Browns, who were widely considered the dominant team in a lesser league. However, the Browns lit up the Eagles' vaunted defense for 487 total yards, including 246 passing yards, in a 35–10 rout. The Eagles never recovered from the loss, and finished the 1950 season 6–6. Following the 1950 season, Greasy Neale retired and was replaced by Bo McMillin. Two games into the 1951 season, McMillin was forced to retire following a diagnosis of terminal stomach cancer. Wayne Millner finished out the season before being replaced by Jim Trimble. While the remnants of the great 1940s teams managed to stay competitive for the first few years of the decade, and younger players like Bobby Walston and Sonny Jurgensen occasionally provided infusions of talent, the team lacked the total talent necessary for true greatness during most of the 1950s. After the 1957 season, the Eagles moved from Connie Mack Stadium to Franklin Field at the University of Pennsylvania. Franklin Field had a vastly expanded seating capacity for the Eagles. While Connie Mack Stadium had a capacity of 39,000, Franklin Field's capacity was 60,000.[43] In 1969, the grass field at Franklin Field was replaced by AstroTurf, making Franklin Field the first NFL stadium to use artificial turf. In 1958, the Eagles took several steps to improve, hiring Buck Shaw as head coach and acquiring quarterback Norm Van Brocklin in a trade with the Los Angeles Rams. During the 1959 season, the team showed flashes of talent, and finished in second place in the Eastern Division. Former Eagles owner and co-founder Bert Bell had become NFL commissioner, and attended the Eagles game on October 11 at Franklin Field against the Pittsburgh Steelers, a team Bell used to own. Bell refused the box seats that the Eagles reserved for him and purchased his own tickets to sit with the fans. During the fourth quarter, while sitting behind the end zone, Bell suffered a heart attack and died later that day. The Eagles' 1960 season remains one of the most celebrated year in team history. Shaw, Van Brocklin, and Bednarik, each in their last season before retirement, led an Eagles team more notable for its grit than its talent. One observer later quipped that the team had \"nothing but a championship\" to its first division title since 1949. The team was aided by their two Pro Bowl receivers, wide receiver Tommy McDonald, who later wrote an autobiography titled They Pay Me to Catch Footballs, and tight end Pete Retzlaff. On November 20, 1960, at Yankee Stadium in The Bronx, Bednarik launched a tackle against New York Giants' running back Frank Gifford, which has come to be known as The Hit, a tackle that is routinely ranked as one of the hardest and most vicious hits in NFL history. With the game tied 10 to 10 in the fourth quarter, Gifford caught a short pass over the middle and was immediately hit by Bednarik with a clothes line tackle so hard that it dropped Gifford to the ground unconscious. Gifford was removed from the field on stretcher and transported to a local hospital by ambulance, where he remained for ten days. Gifford was diagnosed with a deep concussion that resulted in his retirement from the game for 18 months.[44] On the 100th anniversary of the NFL's founding, the NFL ranked Bednarik's tackle the 44th greatest play in league history.[45] On December 26, 1960, one of the coldest days in recorded Philadelphia history, the Eagles faced Vince Lombardi's Green Bay Packers in the 1960 NFL Championship Game and dealt the formidable Lombardi the sole championship game loss of his storied career. Bednarik lined up at center on offense and at linebacker on defense. Fittingly, the game ended as Bednarik tackled a struggling Jim Taylor and refused to allow him to stand until the last seconds had ticked away.[46] Van Brocklin came to Philadelphia and agreed to play through 1960 with an understanding that, upon his retirement as a player, he would succeed Shaw as head coach. Ownership, however, opted to promote assistant coach Nick Skorich instead, and Van Brocklin quit the organization in a fit of pique, instead becoming head coach of the expansion Minnesota Vikings. Back-up quarterback Sonny Jurgensen became the Eagles' starter for the 1961 season; they finished a half-game behind the New York Giants for first place in the Eastern Conference standings with a 10–4 record. Despite the on-the-field success, however, the franchise was in turmoil. The 1962 team, decimated by injury, managed only three wins and were embarrassed at home in a 49–0 loss to the Packers. The off-field chaos continued through 1963, as the 65 shareholders remaining from the original Happy Hundred sold the team to Jerry Wolman, a 36-year-old millionaire Washington developer who outbid local bidders for the team, paying an unprecedented $5.505 million for control of the club.[47][48] In 1964, Wolman hired former Cardinals and Washington Redskins coach Joe Kuharich to a 15-year contract. Over the next five seasons the team failed to make the playoffs and the failures of the team over this period were highlighted by the Santa Claus incident, when fans pelted a Santa Claus with snowballs during a halftime Christmas pageant. The team had only one winning season, in 1966, finishing second in the NFL Eastern Conference. The Eagles lost to the Baltimore Colts 20–14, in the post-season's third place consolation game, the Playoff Bowl, which was held at the Orange Bowl in Miami. The Eagles finished 6–7–1 in 1967. In the following season, the Eagles fell even further in the standings, recording a 2–12 record in 1968. In 1969, Leonard Tose bought the team from Wolman for $16.155 million,[49] the equivalent of $134 million today, representing a record then for the highest amount ever paid for a professional sports franchise. Tose's first official act was to fire Coach Joe Kuharich after a disappointing 24–41–1 record during his five-year reign. Tose then named former Eagles wide receiver Pete Retzlaff the team's general manager and Jerry Williams as its new head coach. With the merger of the NFL and AFL in 1970, the Eagles were placed in the NFC East Division with the New York Giants, Washington Redskins, and Dallas Cowboys. The Eagles' heated rivalry with the Giants is the oldest of the NFC East rivalries, dating back to 1933, and is often cited as one of the best rivalries in the NFL.[8][50][51] 1970 was also the last season for the Eagles at Franklin Field; the team finished the first post-merger season in last place in their division at 3–10–1.[52] In 1971, the Eagles moved to Veterans Stadium, which had just been constructed and was initially acclaimed as a triumph of ultra-modern sports engineering.[53] After a 3–10–1 record in 1970 and three consecutive blowout losses to Cincinnati, Dallas, and San Francisco to open the 1971 season, Williams was fired and replaced by assistant coach Ed Khayat, a defensive lineman on the Eagles' 1960 NFL championship team. Williams and Khayat were hampered by Retzlaff's decision to trade longtime starting quarterback Norm Snead to the Minnesota Vikings in early 1971, leaving the Eagles a choice between journeyman Pete Liske and raw Rick Arrington. Khayat lost his first two games but won six of the season's last nine, thanks largely to the efforts of the Eagles' defense, led by all-pro safety Bill Bradley, who led the NFL in interceptions (11) and interception return yardage (248). The team regressed in 1972 to finish 2–11–1, and Khayat was released. The two wins (both on the road) proved to be surprises, however. Philadelphia beat the Kansas City Chiefs (which had had the best record in the AFC a year before) 21–20 and the Houston Oilers 18–17 on six field goals by kicker Tom Dempsey. The latter game had been called the \"Johnny Rodgers Bowl,\" because the loser, in finishing last in the league, would gain the first overall pick in the 1973 NFL draft, which was then presumed to be Nebraska wingback Johnny Rodgers, the Heisman Trophy winner. With their loss, the Oilers got first pick and took University of Tampa defensive end John Matuszak, who later faced Philadelphia in Super Bowl XV. With the second overall pick, the Eagles selected USC tight end Charle Young. Khayat was replaced by offensive guru Mike McCormack for the 1973 season. Aided by the skills of quarterback Roman Gabriel and towering young wide receiver Harold Carmichael, they managed to infuse a bit of vitality into a previously moribund offense. New general manager Jim Murray also began to add talent on the defensive side of the line, most notably through the addition of future Pro Bowl linebacker Bill Bergey in 1974. Overall, however, the team was still mired in mediocrity. McCormack was fired after a 4–10 1975 season. In 1976, Dick Vermeil was hired from UCLA to coach the struggling Eagles, who had managed only one winning season from 1962 to 1975.[54] Vermeil faced numerous obstacles as he attempted to rejuvenate a franchise that had not seriously contended in well over a decade. Despite the team's young talent and Gabriel's occasional flashes of brilliance, the Eagles finished 1976 with the same 4–10 record as in 1975. In 1977, the first seeds of hope began to emerge. The team obtained hard-throwing quarterback Ron Jaworski in a trade from the Los Angeles Rams in exchange for popular tight end Charle Young. The defense, led by Bergey and defensive coordinator Marion Campbell, began earning a reputation as one of the hardest-hitting in the league. 1978 saw one of the great moments in Eagles history, The Miracle at the Meadowlands, when Herman Edwards returned a fumble by Giants' quarterback Joe Pisarcik for a touchdown with 20 seconds left in the game, resulting in a 19–17 Eagles victory.[55] The Eagles would edge into the playoffs with a 9–7 season. Young running back Wilbert Montgomery became the first Eagle since Steve Van Buren to exceed 1,000 yards in a season.[56] In 1979, the Eagles tied for first place with an 11–5 record, as Montgomery shattered team rushing records with a total of 1,512 yards. In 1980, the team dominated the NFC, facing its chief nemesis, the Dallas Cowboys, in the NFC Championship Game. The game was played in cold conditions before faithful fans at Veterans Stadium. Led by an outstanding rushing performance by Montgomery, whose long cutback TD run in the first half is one of the most memorable in Eagles history, and a gutsy game from fullback Leroy Harris, who scored the Eagles' only other TD that day, the Birds earned a berth in Super Bowl XV with a 20–7 victory.[57] The Eagles traveled to New Orleans for Super Bowl XV, where they were heavily favored over the Oakland Raiders, who had squeaked into the playoffs as a wild-card team. Things did not go the Eagles' way, beginning with Tose's imprudent decision to bring comedian Don Rickles into the pregame locker room to lighten the mood. Jaworski's first pass was intercepted by Rod Martin, setting up an Oakland touchdown. Later in the first quarter, a potential game-tying 40-yard touchdown pass to Rodney Parker was nullified by an illegal-motion penalty. The final score was 27–10. Journeyman quarterback Jim Plunkett was named the game's MVP.[58] The team got off to a promising start in the 1981 season by winning their first six games. They ended up 10–6 to earn a wild-card berth. However, their hopes to repeat as NFC champs were dashed in the wild-card round by the New York Giants, who won 27–21. After the Eagles finished 3–6 in the strike-shortened 1982 season, Vermeil quit the team, citing \"burnout\". Defensive coordinator Marion Campbell replaced Vermeil as head coach. Campbell had helped to popularize the \"bend-don't-break\" defensive strategy in the 1970s. Philadelphia struggled through the mid-1980s, marked by flagging fan participation. The team failed to make the playoffs in 1983 and 1984. The team nearly moved to Phoenix, Arizona at the end of the 1984 season.[59] In 1985, Tose was forced to sell the Eagles to Norman Braman and Ed Leibowitz, highly successful automobile dealers from Florida, for a reported $65 million (equal to $184 million today) to pay off his more than $25 million ($71 million today) in gambling debts at Atlantic City casinos.[60] The team again struggled during the 1985 season, and Campbell was fired after week 16, to be replaced by assistant head coach/defensive backs coach Fred Bruney for the season's last game.[61] In the 1985 Supplemental draft, the Eagles acquired the rights to the Memphis Showboats' elite pass rusher Reggie White.[62] In 1986, the arrival of head coach Buddy Ryan and his fiery attitude sparked team performance and ignited the fan base. Immediately infusing the team with his hard-as-nails attitude, the Eagles quickly became known for their tough defense and tougher attitudes.[63] Ryan began rejuvenating the team by releasing several aging players, including Ron Jaworski. Randall Cunningham took his place and, despite a 5–10–1 season, began showing considerable promise. 1987 saw another strike, which shortened the season by one game.[64] The substitutes who had filled in for the strikers performed poorly and were crushed 41–22 by the Dallas Cowboys. After the strike, the regular Eagles' 1987 team won a 37–20 revenge game against Dallas. The season record was 7–8, of which three games had been played by substitutes. The Eagles reached the playoffs in 1988, but lost to the Chicago Bears, the team that Ryan had helped lead to a Super Bowl XX victory as defensive coordinator. The game became known as the \"Fog Bowl\", due to the inclement weather during the game. The Eagles lost, 20–12.[65] The following two years would see playoff appearances as well, but the team never made it past the first round. This failure was very frustrating to Eagles fans, as the team was widely regarded as among the most talented in the NFL. On offense, the Eagles were led by quarterback Cunningham, one of the most exciting players of his generation; tight end Keith Jackson; and running back Keith Byars. The defense is commonly acknowledged as among the greatest in league history, and as the best to never win a championship.[66] The two 1989 matches with Dallas were known as the Bounty Bowls. Both were won easily by the Eagles (the Cowboys finished 1–15 that year), and were marked by Ryan insulting new Cowboys coach Jimmy Johnson by placing a bounty on their kicker, and by Eagles fans throwing snowballs at him at Veterans Stadium.[67] On November 12, 1990, during a Monday Night Football game at the Vet, the Eagles defeated the Washington Redskins by a score of 28–14, as the defense scored three of the team's four touchdowns. This game, more lopsided than its score would indicate, was subsequently labeled the Body Bag Game in reference to the number of injuries Eagles players inflicted on the Redskins and the physically tough play of the Eagles in the game. In the game, the Eagles knocked out the starting Washington quarterback, and then seriously injured his replacement. Running back Brian Mitchell, who would later be signed by the Eagles, was called upon to finish the game as the Redskins' quarterback.[68] Washington returned to Philadelphia in the first round of the playoffs to defeat the Eagles 20–6, ending their season. Ryan was fired on January 7, 1991, and was replaced by offensive coordinator Rich Kotite.[69] The team started the 1991 season with the loss of starting quarterback Randall Cunningham due to a knee injury. Backup quarterback Jim McMahon assumed the starting role for the rest of the season. Despite having the top-rated defense in the league, the team failed to make the playoffs by finishing third in the NFC East with a record of 10–6. On June 25, 1992, All Pro defensive tackle Jerome Brown was killed in an automobile accident. The team and fan base dedicated the 1992 season to \"bring it home for Jerome\".[70] The team finished second in the NFC East with an 11–5 record to earn a wild-card playoff spot. Kotite led the Eagles to a victory over the New Orleans Saints in the wild-card game but then fell to the Dallas Cowboys in the Divisional round. Another blow to the team was the loss of all-time sacks leader Reggie White to free agency in the off-season. Among the team's offensive stars during that period were quarterback Randall Cunningham, tight end Keith Jackson, and running back Herschel Walker. But what was known as the Gang Green defense, led by Reggie White, Jerome Brown, Clyde Simmons, Seth Joyner, Wes Hopkins, Mike Golic, Byron Evans, Eric Allen, Andre Waters, and Mark McMillian, defined the team. In 1993, Kotite's Eagles fell apart after a promising start and miss the playoffs, ending the regular season 8–8. By 1994, team owner Norman Braman had become largely unpopular among local fans and a polarizing presence in the front office. Jeffrey Lurie bought the Eagles on May 6, 1994, for an estimated $185 million.[71] The club is now estimated to be the 21st most valuable sports team, worth $3.4 billion, as evaluated in 2021 by Forbes.[72] In Lurie's first season as owner in 1994, the team went 7–9 and again missed the playoffs.[73] Rich Kotite was fired and replaced by San Francisco 49ers defensive coordinator Ray Rhodes, who successfully lured 49ers star Ricky Watters to join the team as a free agent.[74][75] In 1995, Rhodes's first season, the Eagles got off to a slow start by losing three of their first four games but subsequently rebounded to finish with a 10–6 record and a playoff spot.[76] In the Wild Card Round, the Eagles, playing at home, overwhelmed the Detroit Lions 58–37, with 31 of Philadelphia's points coming in the second quarter.[77] However, the Eagles were again eliminated in the next round by the Cowboys by a score of 30–11.[78] This would be Randall Cunningham's last game as an Eagle. Cunningham scored the only touchdown of the game and the last Eagles postseason touchdown for six years. 1995 marked the end of Cunningham's tenure as starting quarterback. Rhodes benched Cunningham in favor of Rodney Peete, leading to friction between the two. Earlier, rumors had circulated that Lurie and Rhodes had tried to trade Cunningham to the Arizona Cardinals. However, no such trade materialized and Cunningham retired shortly after the season. In 1996, the Eagles' uniform colors were changed from the classic kelly green to a darker midnight green.[79] The team got off to a good start, winning three of their first four games. However, a week 5 Monday night game at Veterans Stadium against the rival Cowboys witnessed a season-ending knee injury to Peete, loss of the team's momentum, and the transition to an offense led by Ty Detmer and Watters. While Detmer played well and Watters rushed for 1,411 yards, the season conformed to what had become a familiar pattern: 10–6 record and early elimination (a 14–0 shutout by the 49ers) in the playoffs. In the 1996 NFL draft, future fan-favorite and hall-of-famer Brian Dawkins was chosen in the 2nd round. The continued early playoff exits led fans and local media to cast blame on high-priced free agents (Irving Fryar, Watters, Troy Vincent, and Guy McIntyre) for not stepping up in big games, especially in the postseason. Rhodes gradually deteriorated under the stress of the job, and players were beginning to grow tired of his brash demeanor and often autocratic coaching style.[80] After a see-saw 6–9–1 campaign in 1997, the bottom fell out in 1998.[81] The Eagles suffered a 3–13 record, their worst since 1972, and were ranked dead last in numerous offensive statistics.[82][83] Home attendance was declining, a quarterback controversy was deteriorating an already rudderless locker room, and the players had all but tuned out the embattled coaching staff. Left with little choice after a disastrous season, fan revolt, and sagging team morale, Lurie fired Rhodes and hired Green Bay Packers quarterback coach Andy Reid as head coach.[84] The Eagles reemerged as a predominant NFL team under the leadership of new head coach Andy Reid, who was hired away from the Green Bay Packers, where he was the Packers' quarterback coach. Reid's first notable step was drafting Syracuse quarterback Donovan McNabb with the second overall pick in the 1999 NFL draft.[86] The Eagles' awful 1998 season would have entitled the Eagle to first pick but it was awarded to the rebooted Cleveland Browns. Despite clearing the roster for new talent by releasing unpopular and aging veterans such as Ricky Watters and Irving Fryar, Reid was still a virtual unknown before his arrival as head coach, and his appointment was met initially with skepticism among Philadelphia fans. The drafting of McNabb was unpopular with many Eagles fans, many of whom traveled to Madison Square Garden for the 1999 Draft and booed the selection, believing the Eagles instead should have selected Ricky Williams, a University of Texas running back who had been named the 1998 AP College Player of the Year. The 1999 season was largely a rebuilding year for the Eagles. The team, which routinely sells out its home games in Philadelphia, had two 1999 home games that failed to sell out, resulting in local TV blackouts. Another six home games in the 1999 season sold out only because several local small business owners bought the remaining unsold tickets to spare Philadelphia-area viewers a television blackout of the game. The Week 5 home game at Veterans Stadium on October 10, 1999, against the Dallas Cowboys represented the last play of Cowboys wide receiver Michael Irvin's career. In the game, Irvin was driven into the turf by Eagles safety Tim Hauck, which left Irvin lying motionless. Some Eagles fans responded with applause, giving further rise to Philadelphia's reputation as unduly aggressive and hostile fans. Irvin was transported from the field by stretcher and then by ambulance to Thomas Jefferson University Hospital. Irvin, who was diagnosed with a potentially threatening cervical spine injury and forced to announce his NFL retirement after the injury, later said the Philadelphia fans were applauding his departure rather than his serious injury.[87] The team finished the season with a record of 5–11.[88] The 2000 regular-season opener in Dallas on September 3 became known in NFL lore as the \"Pickle Juice Game\". Kickoff temperature in Texas Stadium was 109 degrees Fahrenheit and soared to nearly 120, making it the hottest game in league history, beating a previous record set in a 1997 Cowboys–Cardinals match in Arizona. The nickname came about because an Eagles trainer had prepared for the predicted heat by having the players drink the juice from jars of dill pickles in order to retain body moisture and stave off cramps and heat exhaustion. The experiment proved successful as the Eagles won 41–14 while multiple Cowboys players had been consigned to the bench, unable to handle the torrid climate while the Eagles had no players benched. The game was also significant as marking the beginning of Philadelphia's domination of the NFC East. The team finished the season at 11–5, reaching the playoffs as a wild card, which restored fan optimism. After brushing aside the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 21–3, the Eagles moved to the second round of the playoffs, only to lose 20–10 to the New York Giants. After compiling an 11–5 record in 2001, the Eagles reached the playoffs again, this time at the top of their division. In a near rerun of the previous year, they disposed of the Buccaneers in a 31–9 game. In the second round, the Eagles defeated the Bears 33–19 at Soldier Field. In the NFC Championship game, they were unable to stop the St. Louis Rams, who defeated them 29–24.[89] Despite injuries, McNabb led the Eagles to a 12–4 season in 2002.[90] Once again, they reached the NFC Championship game, but lost at home 27–10 to the eventual Super Bowl champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the last game at Veterans Stadium.[91] In the opening game of the 2003 season, the Eagles were shut out 17–0 by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the first regular-season game ever played at their new home, Lincoln Financial Field. Once again, the team went 12–4 for the season and then reached the conference championship game. In doing so, the Eagles became the first team in modern history to get that far in the postseason after having been shut out at home in its first game. They achieved that distinction despite getting only five touchdown receptions all year by their wide receivers, which tied the league-low since the regular-season schedule was lengthened to its present 16 games in 1978 (this record would be broken in 2004 when the New York Giants' wide receivers caught only two touchdown passes). The Eagle receivers went through both September and October without a TD catch; the last time an NFL team had done that was in 1945. In the Divisional Round of the playoffs, the Eagles beat the Green Bay Packers 20–17 in overtime thanks in part to a late-game completion from McNabb to Freddie Mitchell on an iconic play that has come to be known as 4th and 26. They lost the NFC Championship game to the Carolina Panthers 14–3. Panthers cornerback Ricky Manning Jr. had three interceptions in the game.[92] The Eagles actively pursued premier wide receiver Terrell Owens, and acquired him in a controversial three-way deal with the Baltimore Ravens and the San Francisco 49ers, on March 16, 2004.[93] The 2004 season began with a bang as Owens caught three touchdown passes from McNabb in their season opener against the New York Giants. Owens ended up with exactly 1,200 receiving yards and 14 touchdown receptions, although his season ended prematurely with an ankle injury in a December 19 game against the Dallas Cowboys. The Eagles' 12–7 victory in this game gave them home-field advantage throughout the conference playoffs for the third year in a row. The Eagles tied a record by clinching the NFC East division crown (their fourth straight) after only their eleventh game of the season, matching the mark set by the 1985 Chicago Bears and the 1997 San Francisco 49ers. Their final two regular-season games thus rendered meaningless, the Eagles sat out most of their first-string players in these games and lost both, yet still finished the season with a 13–3 record. McNabb had his best season to date, passing for 3,875 yards and 31 touchdowns, with only eight interceptions. This made him the first quarterback in NFL history to throw 30 or more TD passes and fewer than 10 interceptions in a single regular season. They then began their playoff run with the Divisional round at home against the sixth-seeded Minnesota Vikings. The Eagles led from the start and never looked back, as McNabb led a very efficient passing attack (21 of 33 for 286 yards and 2 TDs), Brian Westbrook dominated on the ground with 70 rushing yards, and Freddie Mitchell performed very well on the receiving corps (5 receptions for 65 yards and a TD), as Philadelphia won 27–14, setting up their fourth-straight NFC Championship appearance. Facing the Atlanta Falcons, McNabb threw for 180 yards and two touchdowns, while also rushing for 32 yards. Westbrook rushed for 96 yards and caught five passes for 39. Winning the game 27–10, the Eagles advanced to Super Bowl XXXIX, where they faced the New England Patriots. Although McNabb threw 3 touchdown passes and 357 yards in the game, and the score was tied 14–14 going into the fourth quarter, the Patriots outscored the Eagles with ten straight points. McNabb completed a 30-yard touchdown pass, and the Eagles defense held the Patriots to a 3 and out, but a crucial interception with 46 seconds left sealed their fate, as the Patriots won 24–21.[94] The team took a step back in 2005 with a 6–10 record, failing to make the playoffs for the first time since the 1999 season.[95] McNabb had played with a sports hernia and a broken thumb, starting 4–2 then losing three in a row, before he finally succumbed to injury and missed the rest of the season. For obnoxious behavior and a feud with McNabb, Owens was suspended after 7 games and was eventually cut.[96][97] In 2006, the team lost McNabb 10 games in and went into turmoil. However, Westbrook stepped up, and the Eagles earned their fifth NFC East title under coach Reid, with a 10–6 record. They won the Wild Card game against the New York Giants, but lost in the Divisional Round to the New Orleans Saints. The 2007 season would end with the Eagles finishing 8–8 and failing to make the playoffs for the second time in three seasons. However, in 2008, the team finished the season with a 9–6–1 record, making the playoffs with a wild card berth, The team upset the Minnesota Vikings in the first round, winning the game 26–14. The team then went on to defeat the defending Super Bowl champion New York Giants 23–11 en route to their sixth NFC Championship Game. In the NFC Championship game, the Eagles rallied from down 24–6 at halftime to up 25–24 in the fourth quarter, but they lost to the Arizona Cardinals by a score of 32–25 after quarterback Kurt Warner scored a touchdown with just under three minutes remaining in regulation.[98] Entering the 2009 season, the Eagles signed quarterback Michael Vick.[99] On December 6, 2009, Andy Reid became only the fifth coach in NFL history to win 100 or more games with a single team in a single decade (the other four are Tom Landry, Don Shula, Tony Dungy, and Bill Belichick).[100] McNabb finally had a complete receiving corps, between first-round draft pick Jeremy Maclin, DeSean Jackson's 1,000-yard season, and Brent Celek ranking among the top 5 tight ends in the league. Without Brian Dawkins, defensive end Trent Cole stepped up and became the dominant force on defense with 12 sacks, earning him his second trip to the Pro Bowl and All-Pro honors. In 2009, the Eagles started 5–4, then won six straight. After a shutout by the Dallas Cowboys in week 17, the Eagles failed to secure a first-round bye, and with a record of 11–5, they were the NFC's sixth seed. In their January 2010 wild card game, the Eagles played against their divisional foes for the second consecutive week, losing 34–14 to hand Dallas their first playoff win since December 1996. On January 11, 2010, General Manager Tom Heckert, Jr. was hired away by the Cleveland Browns; he was replaced by Howie Roseman, who was promoted from Vice President of Player Personnel.[101] On March 5, 2010, Brian Westbrook was cut from the Eagles after eight seasons with the team. On April 4, 2010, the team traded long-time starting quarterback Donovan McNabb to the Washington Redskins in exchange for a second-round draft pick.[102] Kevin Kolb was immediately named the starter for the 2010 season, but after suffering a concussion in week 1 against the Packers, Vick took over as the starter. Week 4 saw the return of McNabb to Philadelphia. The Redskins got a touchdown early in the first quarter. After that, both offenses sputtered, and the Eagles had to settle for two field goals. But things rapidly fell apart when Vick injured his ribs and chest late in the first quarter when two Redskins defensive backs crushed him from both sides while running near the end zone. Kolb was once again brought out to play but delivered an uninspiring performance. He managed a touchdown pass in the fourth quarter, but it wasn't enough. A two-point conversion attempt after the touchdown failed, and Washington won 16–12. In Week 15, the Eagles beat New York in a stunning upset by overcoming a 21-point deficit in the second half. In the closing seconds of the game, DeSean Jackson returned a punt 65 yards for a touchdown to win 38–31. This became known as the Miracle at the New Meadowlands.[103] Vick led the Eagles to their sixth NFC East division title in ten seasons.[104] With a record of 10–6, the Eagles clinched the third seed.[105] In the wild card round, the Eagles lost 21–16 to the eventual Super Bowl XLV champion Green Bay Packers.[106] The 2011 season for the Eagles was a major disappointment. The off-season was marred by a lockout that began in March after the NFL's collective bargaining agreement expired, making practices, trades, and free agency impossible. During the draft, the Eagles did comparatively little. After the lockout ended in July, the team embarked on a rash of high-profile FA signings, including Raiders CB Nnamdi Asomugha, Dolphins RB Ronnie Brown, Giants WR Steve Smith, Packers TE Donald Lee, Titans DE Jason Babin, and Packers DT Cullen Jenkins. Meanwhile, Kevin Kolb, displeased at losing the starting quarterback job to Michael Vick in 2010, was traded to Arizona for Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie. Replacing him as 2nd-stringer was ex-Titans quarterback Vince Young. Young created a lot of hype by calling Philadelphia the \"Dream Team\".[107] The team managed to finish only 8–8 and missed the playoffs.[108] In 2012, the Eagles started off winning three of their first four games but lost their next eight, which eliminated them from the playoff hunt. They won only one of their last four games.[109] After a loss to the New York Giants on December 30, 2012, head coach Andy Reid was fired after fourteen seasons with the team.[110] On January 16, 2013, after a 4–12 season, the Eagles brought in University of Oregon head coach Chip Kelly to succeed Reid as head coach.[111] The Philadelphia Eagles named Michael Vick the starting quarterback going into the 2013 season with much promise running Chip Kelly's fast-paced spread offense.[112] The 2013 season proved very successful for the Eagles. While a hamstring injury took Michael Vick out after a 1–3 start, his backup Nick Foles led the team to a 10–6 regular-season record and its seventh NFC East title in 13 seasons, but the Eagles lost to the New Orleans Saints in the wild card round. Before throwing his first interception in Week 14, Foles had thrown 19 touchdowns, just one shy of the all-time NFL record of consecutive touchdowns without an interception to start a season, set earlier in the season by Peyton Manning. Foles also tied Manning for most touchdown passes in a single game, with seven, against the Oakland Raiders, which also made him the youngest player in NFL history to throw for that many touchdowns in a game. Foles finished the regular season with 27 touchdown passes and only 2 interceptions, giving him the then-best TD-INT ratio in NFL history. (That record was later broken by Tom Brady, in the 2016 season.) He also finished with a 119.0 passer rating, third-highest in league history behind only Aaron Rodgers in 2011 and Peyton Manning in 2004. He was also only the second quarterback in NFL history to have a game in which he topped 400 passing yards and a perfect passer rating. LeSean McCoy finished his Pro Bowl season as the league's top rusher with 1,607 rushing yards (also a franchise record) and 2,146 total yards from scrimmage, also best in the NFL. As a whole, the Eagles offense scored 51 touchdowns, most in franchise history, passing the previous season-high set back in 1948. Following the 2013 season, the Eagles released Pro-Bowl wide receiver DeSean Jackson due to his poor \"work ethic and attitude\", as well as speculation of his involvement in gang-related activities.[113] The team signed All Pro safety Malcolm Jenkins to a three-year contract, worth $16.25 million.[114] The Eagles opened the 2014 season winning their first three games and making NFL history as the only team ever to trail by ten or more points in their first three games and come back to win.[115] Nick Foles struggled with turnovers, but ultimately did well and led the Eagles to a 6–2 record, before breaking his collarbone, resulting in his replacement by Mark Sanchez, who outplayed Foles.[116] The Eagles held the divisional title from Week 1 to Week 15. After going 9–3 with a crucial win over the Dallas Cowboys, the Eagles lost their next three, and a week after losing the NFC East title, they lost an upset against the 3–11 Washington Redskins and were eliminated from playoff contention with the Cowboys' win over the Indianapolis Colts.[117] Following the 2014 season, Chip Kelly was given total control and made some controversial personnel moves.[118] He traded LeSean McCoy, who had become the team's all-time leading rusher after the 2014 season, for linebacker Kiko Alonso, a player Kelly coached at Oregon who had missed the entire 2014 season.[119] He also cut ten-year veteran and starter Trent Cole, who was still a consistent threat on defense and was second only to legend Reggie White on the Eagles all-time sack list.[120] He also traded the highly successful Nick Foles for Sam Bradford, who had missed the entire 2014 season with a torn anterior cruciate ligament.[121] Kelly tried to re-sign Jeremy Maclin, who had stepped up as the team's leading wide receiver, but Maclin signed with the Kansas City Chiefs instead. However, the Eagles also acquired league leading rusher DeMarco Murray,[122] which not only helped the Eagles, but hurt their rivals, the Dallas Cowboys. They also obtained Super Bowl champion Byron Maxwell,[123] who left the Seattle Seahawks in free agency to sign a six-year, $63 million contract. The first two games of the 2015 season were dismal, as they lost both. Bradford had a poor 2–4 TD-INT ratio, Maxwell was constantly beaten by Atlanta Falcons wide receiver Julio Jones, and Murray was held to 11 yards on 21 carries. After Murray was injured, Ryan Mathews rushed for over 100 yards in a Week 3 win against the New York Jets. Kelly made Murray the unquestioned starter and although Murray's play improved over the season, he never regained his dominant form and was held to a career-low average of 3.6 yards per carry.[124] On December 29, 2015, with one game left in the season, head coach Chip Kelly was released by the Eagles after a 6–9 record. Offensive coordinator Pat Shurmur was named interim head coach for the final game against the rival New York Giants, which Shurmur won 35–30.[125] The Eagles hired Kansas City Chiefs' offensive coordinator Doug Pederson as their next head coach on January 18, 2016.[126] Pederson had been with the Chiefs for the preceding three years after having spent the four seasons before those with the Eagles. He served as a quality control assistant coach for the Eagles in 2009 and 2010 before being promoted to quarterbacks coach for the 2011 and 2012 seasons. He had been praised for his work with Chiefs quarterback Alex Smith over the prior several seasons, particularly 2015, as the Chiefs moved into the top 10 in scoring offense.[127][128] At the end of the 2015 season, the Eagles were slated for the 13th overall pick in the 2016 NFL draft. They traded that pick, Byron Maxwell, and Kiko Alonso to the Miami Dolphins for the eighth overall pick.[129] Later, they traded the eighth overall pick, their third- and fourth-round picks, a 2017 first-round pick, and a 2018 second-round pick to the Cleveland Browns for the second overall pick and a 2017 fourth-round pick.[130] They used the second overall pick to draft North Dakota State quarterback Carson Wentz.[131] On September 3, 2016, the Eagles traded starting quarterback Sam Bradford to the Minnesota Vikings, who had lost Teddy Bridgewater for the season, for a 2017 first-round pick and a 2018 fourth-round pick.[132] Following the trade, the Eagles named Wentz the starting quarterback for Week 1 of the 2016 season.[133] First-time head coach Pederson led the Eagles to a 3–0 record to start the season. His rookie quarterback started with five touchdowns, no interceptions and over 255 yards per game. After a Week 4 bye, they lost four out of the next five games, including losses to every team in their division. They also lost right tackle Lane Johnson to a 10-game suspension following the Week 5 loss against the Lions, which damaged Carson Wentz's hot start.[134] In those four defeats, their average margin of loss was just under 5 points.[135] Pederson and the Eagles won just three of their final seven games. Although Wentz started off the season well, he finished with a TD–INT ratio of 8:7.[136] The rookie head coach-quarterback tandem led the Eagles to a 7–9 record, finishing last in the division.[137] The Eagles had a 13–3 record in 2017, including a nine-game winning streak.[138] In a week 14 game against the Los Angeles Rams, starting quarterback Carson Wentz left the game with a torn anterior cruciate ligament, and backup Nick Foles, who had been re-signed in the off-season, took over for the rest of the season.[139] Wentz was considered to have been playing at an MVP level at the time of his injury.[140][141] Foles's first start was a comeback from a 20–7 deficit against the New York Giants where he scored four touchdowns to win 34–29.[142] Foles struggled in the last two games of the season against the Oakland Raiders and the Dallas Cowboys and threw a touchdown and two interceptions in those two games.[143] Despite this, the Eagles clinched home-field advantage after the win against Oakland in week 16. Foles led the Eagles past the Atlanta Falcons in the Divisional Round 15–10.[144] In the NFC Championship game, the Eagles beat the Minnesota Vikings 38–7, despite having been betting underdogs.[145] Foles had his best game since week 15 and threw for 352 passing yards and three touchdowns.[146] The Eagles traveled to Minneapolis to compete in Super Bowl LII, their third attempt at a title, against Tom Brady and the New England Patriots in a rematch of Super Bowl XXXIX from 2005.[147] With Foles at the helm, the game's first touchdown was scored by the Eagles in just three plays: a short pass from Foles to Nelson Agholor, a 36-yard run up the middle by LeGarrette Blount, and a 34-yard touchdown pass from Foles to Alshon Jeffery on the left side of the field. The ensuing extra-point attempt from Jake Elliott was missed wide right, which made the score 9–3 in favor of the Eagles. The Patriots responded by advancing the ball to the Philadelphia 11-yard line on their next drive, which was set up by a 50-yard completion from Brady to Danny Amendola, and the quarter ended.[148] In the second quarter, Philadelphia faced fourth-and-goal on the 1-yard line with 38 seconds left. Deciding to go for the touchdown, they attempted a trick play similar to one that had failed for the Patriots earlier. It would be the most memorable play of the game. As Foles stepped up to the running back position, Clement took a direct snap and pitched the ball to tight end Trey Burton, who then threw the ball to Foles, who was wide open in the right side of the end zone. Foles caught the ball, making him the first quarterback ever to catch a touchdown pass in a Super Bowl, and the ensuing extra point was good, giving the Eagles a 22–12 lead, which was taken into the locker room after a short drive by the Patriots. The scoring play came to be known as the Philly Special.[148] New England's only lead was by one point in the fourth quarter, 33–32, but the Eagles rallied back and scored an 11-yard touchdown to tight end Zach Ertz to take the lead. The last score of the game was a 46-yard field goal by Elliott to make the final score 41–33.[149] The Eagles won their first Super Bowl and Vince Lombardi Trophy in franchise history and their first championship since 1960, ending the third-longest active championship drought in the NFL at 57 years.[150] Foles won Super Bowl MVP going 28 for 43 with 373 passing yards, three passing touchdowns, one interception, and one receiving touchdown.[151] Foles became the first backup quarterback to start and win a Super Bowl since his opponent Tom Brady won as the backup for Drew Bledsoe in 2002's Super Bowl XXXVI.[152] The combined 74 points scored was one point shy of the Super Bowl record of 75, set in Super Bowl XXIX in 1995; this game marked only the second time in the history of the Super Bowl where the teams combined for 70+ points.[153] The game also set a record for most yardage by both teams (combined) with 1,151 yards, the most for any single game, regular season or postseason.[154] The game set many other Super Bowl records as well, including fewest punts from both teams (one), and most yards gained by a team (613 for New England).[155] Before the 2018 season started, many injuries plagued the team, including quarterback Carson Wentz, who was still recovering from an anterior cruciate ligament injury that he had sustained during the previous season. Nick Foles was named the starting quarterback to begin the season,[156] and helped the team win their opening game against the Atlanta Falcons, 18–12. Wentz returned as the starting quarterback in week 3 after Foles had led the team to a 1–1 record.[157] Injuries continued to be a major problem throughout the season, especially on defense as Jalen Mills, Ronald Darby, and Rodney McLeod all suffered season-ending injuries.[158][159][160] Wentz suffered a fractured vertebra in his back after a week 14 loss to the Dallas Cowboys,[161] and Foles was again named the starter for remainder of the season.[162] The Eagles' 4–6 record after 10 games seemed to give them little chance of making the playoffs, but the team managed to win 5 of their last 6, including upsets over the eventual NFC champion Los Angeles Rams and Houston Texans. The Eagles finished the season with a 9–7 record and made the playoffs as the sixth seed.[163] In the Wild Card game against the Chicago Bears, Foles threw 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions in a 16–15 win. With ten seconds left, Bears kicker Cody Parkey missed a potential game-winning field goal that became known in NFL lore as the Double Doink.[164] This sent the Philadelphia Eagles to an NFC Divisional matchup against the New Orleans Saints. The Eagles offense initially performed well, ending the first quarter with a 14–0 lead. The Eagles would not score again after the Saints defense rallied, forcing Foles to throw two interceptions. The Eagles ended up losing by a score of 20–14, ending their opportunity to repeat as Super Bowl champions[165] In 2019, the Eagles matched their 9–7 record from 2018.[166] They won 4 straight games against divisional opponents to close the season, clinching the NFC East in Week 17 with a 34–17 win over the New York Giants[167] and clinched a playoff berth for the third consecutive season. Carson Wentz started his first playoff game in the Wild Card round against the Seattle Seahawks, but left the game early in the first quarter after suffering a concussion on a controversial helmet-to-helmet hit by Jadeveon Clowney.[168] Backup quarterback Josh McCown finished the game even after suffering a torn hamstring in the second quarter.[169] The Eagles lost to the Seahawks 17–9, ending their season.[170] The Eagles opened the 2020 season with consecutive losses to the Washington Football Team and Los Angeles Rams.[171][172] In week 3, the Eagles tied with the Cincinnati Bengals after controversially punting the ball instead of attempting a potential 64-yard game-winning field goal late in overtime.[173] The decision was widely criticized by sports media and fans as they accused head coach Doug Pederson of settling for a tie, rather than playing to win.[174] Once again, injuries continued to plague the team as almost every offensive starter had suffered an injury throughout the season,[175] and the team fielded 14 different offensive line combinations in 16 games.[176] The team entered the bye week with a 3–4–1 record and proceeded to lose their next four games. During their week 13 match-up against the Green Bay Packers, rookie quarterback Jalen Hurts entered the game in the third quarter in relief of Wentz after poor play.[177] Hurts would later be named the starting quarterback for the remainder of the season after a career-worst season performance by Wentz.[178][179] Hurts led the Eagles to a 24–21 victory against the New Orleans Saints in week 14. This would be the team's last win of the 2020 season as they lost their next three games, finishing with a 4–11–1 record and missing the playoffs for the first time in four seasons.[180] During the 2020 off-season, defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz announced that he would step down from his position.[181] A day later, linebackers coach Ken Flajole left his position on the team.[182] After a disappointing 2020 season, Doug Pederson met with Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie to discuss the future of the team. Pederson proposed changes to the coaching staff that were described by internal reporters as \"underwhelming\" and out of line with Lurie's vision for the team.[183][184] On January 11, 2021, the Eagles announced that they had fired Pederson.[185] In a statement, Lurie described the move as in the best interests of both Pederson and the team.[186] Pederson became just the first head coach to be fired within three years of winning a Super Bowl since the Baltimore Colts fired Don McCafferty after the 1972 NFL season.[187] The Eagles hired former Indianapolis Colts' offensive coordinator Nick Sirianni as their next head coach on January 21, 2021.[188] During the offseason, the Eagles traded starting quarterback Carson Wentz to the Colts for a 2021 third-round draft pick and a 2022 conditional second-round pick.[189] In doing so, Wentz was reunited with Frank Reich, head coach of the Colts who served as the Eagles' offensive coordinator for Wentz's first two years in Philadelphia, including during their Super Bowl-winning season in 2017. The Eagles absorbed a $33.8-million dead-cap hit for trading Wentz.[190] During the 2021 NFL draft, the Eagles selected Heisman Trophy–winning wide receiver DeVonta Smith with the 10th overall pick,[191] and maneuvered around the draft to gain an extra first-round selection in the 2022 NFL draft.[192] Smith was a highly touted prospect out of the University of Alabama, and was the first Heisman winner the Eagles drafted in over fifty years.[193] The drafting of Smith also reunited him with Jalen Hurts, his first quarterback at Alabama.[194] After training camp, Hurts was officially named the Eagles' starting quarterback for the 2021 season by head coach Sirianni.[195] After starting the season 2–5, the Eagles went 7–3 in their last ten games, clinching a playoff berth in week 17 after a victory over the Washington Football Team along with a loss by the Minnesota Vikings and win by the San Francisco 49ers.[196] The Eagles finished the season with the #1 rushing offense; It was the best rushing offense since the 1985 Chicago Bears, and the best in the franchise history since the 1949 Eagles team. They lost in the wild card game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 31–15.[197] The Eagles went on to win their first eight games of the 2022 season, setting a franchise record, and earned the top seed in the NFC with a 14–3 overall record.[198] the Eagles matched their franchise-best 13–1 start in the 2004 season and secured their third 13-win season win in franchise history, after 2004 and 2017. With a 22–16 win over the Giants in Week 18, the Eagles won the NFC East for the first time since 2019, and clinched the NFC's #1 seed for the first time since 2017.[199] The Eagles also reached 14 regular season wins, a franchise record.[200] In the Divisional Round, the Eagles routed the Giants 38–7 for their first postseason win since 2018.[201] With this win, Philadelphia completed a 3–0 sweep of all three games played against New York, and advanced to the NFC Championship for the first time since 2017. The Eagles went on to win the NFC Championship against an injury depleted San Francisco 49ers team 31–7, advancing to Super Bowl LVII, their fourth Super Bowl appearance in franchise history, to face the Kansas City Chiefs and former longtime head coach Andy Reid.[202] The Eagles ultimately lost to the Chiefs by a score of 38–35.[203] The Eagles opened the 2023 season as the defending NFC Champions. Despite starting the season 10–1, The Eagles failed to equal or improve on their 14–3 record from the previous year. Even in victory, the Eagles had problems with a poor defense the entire season, which was ranked 26th out of 32;[204] 8 of their 11 victories fell within one score, none of their aforementioned wins went outside of 2 scores, and their losses to the playoff-bound 49ers and Cowboys were blowouts. The Eagles' late-season woes continued into the playoffs, in which they were eliminated in the Wild Card round by the NFC South champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers in a 32–9 blowout loss. The Eagles promptly fired offensive coordinator Brian Johnson and defensive coordinator Sean Desai within a week of their playoff exit.[205][206] In the subsequent offseason, on March 4, 2024, center Jason Kelce retired after spending his entire 13-year career with the Eagles.[207] On March 10, defensive tackle Fletcher Cox would also retire after spending 12 seasons with the team.[208] The Eagles were a part of the NFL Eastern Division from 1933 to 1949, the National Conference from 1950 to 1953, and the Eastern Conference from 1953 to 1966. They were then placed in the Capitol Division of the Eastern Conference in 1967. When the league reformed into the NFC and AFC in 1970, the Eagles were placed in the NFC East. The choice of an eagle as the team mascot honored the insignia of the New Deal program, the National Recovery Administration, which featured a blue eagle as its insignia.[209][note 1] For the 1933 and 1934 seasons, the Eagles colors were light blue and yellow.[210] In 1935, they added green to their uniforms and for several decades, their colors were kelly green, silver, and white. In 1954 the Eagles, along with the Baltimore Colts, became the second team ever in the NFL to put a logo on their helmets, with silver wings on a kelly green helmet. In 1969 the team wore two helmet versions: Kelly green with white wings in road games, and white with kelly green wings at home. From 1970 to '73, they wore the white helmets with Kelly green wings exclusively before switching back to Kelly green helmets with silver wings. By 1974, Joseph A. Scirrotto Jr. designed the silver wings within a white outline, and this style on a kelly green helmet became standard for over two decades. From 1948 to 1995, the team logo was an eagle in flight carrying a football in its claws, although from 1969 to 1972, the eagle took on a more stylized look. In 1973, the team's name was added below the eagle, returning to its pre-1969 look. Both the logo and uniforms were radically altered in 1996, when the primary kelly green color was changed to a darker shade, officially described as \"midnight green.\" Silver was practically abandoned, as uniform pants moved to either white or midnight green. The traditional helmet wings were changed to a primarily white color, with silver and black accents. The team's logo combination (the eagle and club name lettering) also changed, with the eagle itself limited to a white (bald eagle) head, drawn in a less realistic, more cartoon-like style, and the lettering changed from calligraphic to block letters.[211] The eagle head is the only NFL logo to \"face left\" which causes the right side of the logo to present a stylized \"E\".[citation needed] Since 1996, the team has made only minor alterations, mostly related to jersey/pants combinations worn during specific games. For example, in 1997, against the San Francisco 49ers, the team wore midnight green jerseys and pants for the first of only two occasions in team history. The second occasion was in 2002, during the final regular season game at Veterans Stadium, a win over the division-rival Washington Redskins. A year later, in the first two games of the 2003 season (both home losses, to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and New England Patriots), the Eagles wore white jerseys with white pants. After that, the white jerseys along with white pants were worn exclusively during preseason games from 2004 to 2011, with the exception of 2007 and 2010. The 2003 season also saw the first (though subtle) change to the 1996-style uniform. On both white and green jerseys, black shadows and silver trim were added to both the green and white numbering. The stripe on the pants changed from black-green-black to black-silver-green on the white pants, and from a solid black stripe to one stripe of black, another of silver, with one small white stripe in between for the midnight green pants. The 2003 season also saw the team debut black alternate jerseys, with a green (instead of black) shadow on white numbers, and silver trim. These black jerseys have been worn for two selected home games each season (usually the first home game after a bye week and the season finale). In the 2003 and 2004 regular-season home finales, the team wore the green road pants with the black alternate jerseys, but lost both games. Since then, the Eagles have only worn the black jerseys with the white pants. However, due to the special 75th-anniversary uniforms serving as the \"alternates\" for one game in 2007, the Eagles could not wear the alternate black jersey that season per league rules at the time (alternate uniforms were permitted twice per season but only one can be used). The black jerseys with white pants, however, re-appeared for the 2008 Thanksgiving night game against the Arizona Cardinals. From 2006 to 2013, the Eagles have only worn the alternate black jerseys once a season and for the last November home game, but did not use them in 2007, 2010, and 2011. For the 2007 and 2010 seasons, the Eagles used throwback uniforms in place of the black alternates for their anniversary to commemorate past teams. The team also started wearing black cleats exclusively in 2004, although the rule was relaxed by the mid-2010s. To celebrate the team's 75th anniversary, the 2007 uniforms featured a 75th-season logo patch on the left shoulder. In addition, the team wore \"throwback\" jerseys in a 2007 game against the Detroit Lions. The yellow and blue jerseys, the same colors found on Philadelphia's city flag, are based on those worn by the Philadelphia Eagles in the team's inaugural season, and had been the same colors used by the Frankford Yellow Jackets franchise prior to its suspension of operations in 1931. The Eagles beat Detroit, 56–21.[212] The Eagles wear their white jerseys at home for preseason games and daytime games in the first half of the regular season from September to mid-October when the temperature is warmer. In night contests in the first half of the regular season, the Eagles do not need to wear white at home since the temperature is cooler. However, there have been exceptions, such as the home opener against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2003 and the Washington Redskins in 2007 that were played at night. In late October or beginning in November, the Eagles start to wear their colors at home (although they had done it earlier), be it the midnight green jerseys or a third jersey. On one occasion, the Eagles wore white at home after October in a meeting against the Dallas Cowboys on November 4, 2007, in order to make the Cowboys wear their blue road jerseys. Upon moving to Lincoln Financial Field in 2003, the Eagles wore white at home for at least their home opener, but in recent years they opted to wear their standard midnight green jerseys even during the warmest of autumn weather. In the 2010 season against the Green Bay Packers, on September 12, 2010, the Eagles wore uniforms similar to the ones that were worn by the 1960 championship team in honor the 50th anniversary of that team.[213] In weeks 4 and 6 of the 2010 season, the Eagles wore their white jerseys in a match-up against the Washington Redskins and Atlanta Falcons, respectively, before reverting to their midnight green jerseys for the rest of their home games. For the 2012 season, Nike took over from Reebok as the NFL's official apparel licensee, but the Eagles decided that they would not be adopting Nike's \"Elite 51\" uniform technology. Aside from the Nike logo replacing the Reebok logo, the only other change is the league-wide revision of the NFL shield on the uniform (replacing the NFL Equipment logo). Other than that the uniforms essentially remain unchanged. The Eagles also revived their black alternate jersey and resumed wearing white pants with their white jerseys in the regular season. For the 2014 season, the Eagles officially adopted the \"Elite 51\"-style uniform from Nike. However, they only wore the midnight green jerseys and pants in the second half of that season due to the difficulty of producing their preferred shade of midnight green.[214] Recently the team has discussed bringing back the \"Kelly Green\" uniforms similar to the uniforms worn in the 1960 NFL Championship season, which were last worn in the 2010 season opener vs. Green Bay. Traditionally, kelly green, silver and white had been the official team colors, until the 1996 season when it changed to the current \"Midnight Green\" uniforms. NFL rules and restrictions require that teams go through a waiting period before any major uniform changes and alterations can be made, which means it would likely be quite some time before any uniform changes are officially made. In Week 6 of 2014 against the New York Giants, the team introduced black pants to complement their black jerseys, giving them a blackout uniform set. The Eagles won the game 27–0. The victory was their first shutout in 18 years. In Week 16 of 2016 (also against the Giants), the Eagles wore a variation of the all-black look as part of the NFL Color Rush program, but with solid black socks as opposed to black with white sanitary socks of the original look. The black jerseys/white pants combination was last seen during a preseason road game against the New England Patriots, after which the black jerseys were paired exclusively with the black pants. In 2018, the Eagles' midnight green pants were not worn at all, marking the first such instance since the 1996 rebrand that the Eagles wore only white pants with their primary white or midnight green jerseys. In Week 6 of the 2017 season, the Eagles debuted an all-white look with white jerseys, white pants and solid white socks in a road game against the Carolina Panthers.[215] The all-white look began to be utilized full-time as a road uniform set in 2019 thanks to the NFL's decision to allow teams to wear solid color socks as an alternate look. During Week 10 of the 2021 season, the Eagles paired their white uniforms with the alternate black pants against the Denver Broncos, marking the first time the black pants were paired with a different colored uniform. In 2022, the Eagles unveiled a new black alternate helmet, which would be worn alongside the all-black uniform. In addition, the team announced that throwback Kelly Green uniforms would return as an alternate uniform starting in the 2023 season.[216] The team originally intended to release the uniforms in 2022, but due to production supply issues, the Eagles elected to delay its release to 2023. With the Kelly Green helmet becoming the team's alternate, the black helmet was shelved, and the Eagles returned to wearing their primary midnight green helmets with the all-black uniform. On June 16, it was released to the media that the Eagles would be changing their wordmark to a more modernized design.[217] Due to supply chain issues, the new wordmark was not applied to the uniforms until 2024. In addition, the black helmet was brought back as the team's third helmet option; while the NFL only allowed teams with new designs to adopt a third helmet in 2024, the Eagles' minor change of jersey wordmark counted as such. The black helmets were worn with the white jerseys, black pants and white socks for the team's Week 1 game in São Paulo, Brazil against the Green Bay Packers. The Eagles and Dallas Cowboys rivalry has been listed among the best and most acrimonious in the NFL.[218][219] The Eagles won the first game in this rivalry 27–25 on September 30, 1960. Dallas leads the all-time series 74–56 as of the 2023 season, but in recent years, the series has been close, with each team winning 12 games since 2006.[220] There is considerable hostility between the two teams' fan bases, with incidents such as the 1989 Bounty Bowl. The rivalry has even spilled over into draft weekend, with Cowboys legend Drew Pearson and Eagles legend David Akers exchanging insults at the opposing franchise in 2017 and 2018, respectively.[221][222] The Eagles' rivalry with the New York Giants began in 1933 with the founding of the Eagles and slowly strengthened when both teams came to relative prominence in the 1940s and 1950s. The two teams have played in the same division in the NFL every year since 1933. The ferocity of the rivalry can also be attributed to the geographic New York-Philadelphia rivalry, which is mirrored in Major League Baseball's Mets–Phillies and the NHL's Flyers–Rangers and Flyers–Islanders. It is ranked by NFL Network as one of the greatest rivalries of all time,[223] Sports Illustrated ranks it as the fourth best NFL rivalry of all time,[8] and according to ESPN, it is one of the fiercest and most well-known rivalries in the football community.[224] As of the 2023 season, the Eagles lead the all-time series 94–89–2.[225] While not as big as the rivalries with the Giants and Cowboys, the Eagles' historical rivalry with the Washington Redskins / Washington Football Team / Washington Commanders has still been fierce. Although the two franchises played in the same division in the Eagles' inaugural 1933 season, their first meeting did not take place until October 21, 1934, during Washington's first year under the Boston Redskins moniker; the Redskins defeated the Eagles 6–0 at Fenway Park.[226] Washington currently leads the all-time series 89–85–6. Since 2010, the rivalry has been very even overall with the Eagles winning 16 of the last 27 matchups.[227] The Eagles lead the Atlanta Falcons 21–15–1, with a 3–1 lead in playoff games.[228] The rivalry first emerged after the Falcons upset the Eagles in the 1978 Wild Card Round 14–13,[229] and only intensified further during the 2000s thanks to the rivalry between prominent dual-threat quarterbacks Donovan McNabb and Michael Vick. Recently, the Eagles' path to winning Super Bowl LII included a 2017 divisional round victory over the Falcons.[230][231] The Eagles and Pittsburgh Steelers are both located in Pennsylvania and began play in 1933.[232] From that season through 1966, this was a major rivalry for both teams, as both were part of the same division. In 1967 they were placed in separate divisions, but remained in the same conference for three years. In 1970 the Steelers (along with the Cleveland Browns and Baltimore Colts) moved to the American Football Conference, while the Eagles stayed with the rest of the old-line NFL teams in the National Football Conference. As a result, the Eagles and Steelers no longer played each other every year; instead, they are scheduled to meet once every four years in the regular season. The most recent meeting was in 2022 at Lincoln Financial Field due to the addition of a regular season game based on opposing conference divisional finish from the season before, with the Eagles winning 35–13. The Steelers have lost ten straight games on the road against the Eagles dating back to 1966, which was also the start of the Super Bowl era. As of the 2023 season, the Eagles lead the all-time series 49–29–3.[233] Running backs (RB) Wide receivers (WR) Tight ends (TE) Defensive linemen (DL) Defensive backs (DB) Special teams Reserve 53 active, 7 reserve, 15 practice squad (+1 exempt) Notes: In 1987, the Eagles Honor Roll was established. Every Eagles player who had been elected into the Pro Football Hall of Fame at that point was among the inaugural induction class. By 2012, the Honor Roll had been retitled as the Eagles Hall of Fame.[238] Players are considered for induction three years after their retirement from the NFL, and there have been 47 inductees into the Eagles Hall of Fame as of 2019.[239] The following players below have franchise records for the Eagles:[241] + = min. 500 attempts, # = min. 100 attempts, ∗ = minimum 15 attempts, ∗ = minimum 15 attempts, # = min. 100 attempts, + = min. 500 attempts ∗ = minimum 4 receptions, # = min. 20 receptions, + = min. 200 receptions → Coaching staff → Front office → More NFL staffs From 2008 through 2010, Eagles games were broadcast on both rock-formatted WYSP and sports-talk Sports Radio 610 WIP, as both stations were owned and operated by CBS Radio. In 2011, CBS dropped the music on WYSP, renaming it WIP-FM and making it a full simulcast of WIP. By 2020, 610 WIP had changed call letters to WTEL and rebranded to the Philadelphia affiliate for the Black Information Network, while WIP-FM broadcast all Eagles games. In 2017, the Eagles extended their broadcasting contract with WIP-FM through 2024.[242] Merrill Reese, who joined the Eagles in 1976, is the play-by-play announcer, and former Eagles wide receiver Mike Quick, who replaced offense lineman Stan Walters beginning in 1998, is the color analyst.[243][244] The post-game show, which has consisted of many Philadelphia sports personalities, as of the 2014 season is hosted by Kevin Riley, a former Eagles linebacker and special-teamer, and Rob Ellis. Riley was the former post-game host for the show on 94 WYSP before the WIP change over; Rob Ellis hosts a weekly show nightly from 6–10 on 94.1 WIP-FM. Spanish language broadcasts are on WEMG Mega 105.7FM with Rickie Ricardo on play-by-play, and Oscar Budejen as color commentator.[245][246] In 2015, the preseason games were being televised on WCAU, the local NBC owned and operated station. During the regular season, games are governed by the NFL's master broadcasting contract with Fox, CBS, NBC, and ESPN. Most games can be seen on Fox-owned WTXF-TV. When hosting an AFC team, those games can be seen on CBS-owned KYW-TV. The Eagles previously held their preseason training camp from the end of July through mid-August each year at Lehigh University in Bethlehem in the Lehigh Valley.[247] In 2013, with the addition of head coach Chip Kelly, the Eagles moved their training camp to the NovaCare Complex in Philadelphia.[248][249] Training camps were previously held at Chestnut Hill Academy in 1935, Saint Joseph's University in 1939 and 1943, Saranac Lake from 1946 to 1948, Hershey from 1951 to 1967, Albright College from 1968 to 1972, Widener University from 1973 to 1979, and West Chester University from 1980 to 1995.[249] This fight song is heard during Eagles' home games after touchdowns and before the team is introduced prior to kickoff.[250] The Eagles have their own cheerleading squad, which performs a variety of dance routines for the fans and the Eagles on the sideline.[251] The squad also releases a swimsuit calendar each year, and is the first squad in the league to release the calendar on the Android and iOS mobile systems.[252][253] Although the method may vary, studies that attempt to rank the 32 fan bases in the NFL consistently place Eagles fans among the best in the league, noting their \"unmatched fervor.\"[254] American City Business Journals, which conducts a regular study to determine the most loyal fans in the NFL,[255] ranked Eagles fans third in both 1999[256] and 2006.[257] The 2006 study called Eagles fans \"incredibly loyal\", noting that they filled 99.8% of the seats in the stadium over the previous decade.[258] Forbes placed the Eagles fans first in its 2008 survey,[259] which was based on the correlation between team performance and fan attendance.[260] ESPN.com placed Eagles fans fourth in the league in its 2008 survey, citing the connection between the team's performance and the mood of the city.[261] The last home game that was blacked out on television in the Philadelphia market as a result of not being sold out was against the Arizona Cardinals on Sunday, September 12, 1999, which was Andy Reid's first home game as new head coach of the Eagles.[262] The studies note that, whether the Eagles have winning or losing teams, fans can be counted on to pack the stadium each year. As of August 2008, the team had sold out 71 consecutive games, and 70,000 additional fans were on the Eagles' waiting list for season tickets.[261] Despite finishing with a 6–10 record in the 2005 season, the Eagles ranked second in the NFL in merchandise sales, and single-game tickets for the next season were sold out minutes after phone and Internet lines opened.[263] Eagles fans have also been known to chant the famous, \"E-A-G-L-E-S – Eagles!\" at Flyers, Phillies, and 76ers games when the team is getting blown out late in a game and a loss is inevitable, signifying their displeasure with the given team's performance, and that they are instead putting their hope into the Eagles.[264] Occasionally, travelling Phillies fans may even chant this when the Phillies appear to be a few innings away from an inevitable win on the road as a way to celebrate their team and Philadelphia as a whole. The Eagles and Phillies were both the main tenants at Veterans Stadium before Lincoln Financial Field at Citizens Bank Park were built. Notable famous fans of the Eagles include actor Bradley Cooper,[265] actor and comedian Kevin Hart,[266] Jeopardy! champion Brad Rutter,[267] journalists Jake Tapper[268] and Jesse Watters,[269] morning talk show host Kelly Ripa,[270] TV personality Jim Cramer,[271] and soccer star Carli Lloyd, the latter of whom also appeared at a joint practice of the Eagles with the Baltimore Ravens in 2019 where she nailed a 55-yard field goal attempt.[272] One week later, during an international friendly pitting the United States against Portugal at Lincoln Financial Field, Lloyd celebrated scoring a goal by doing the \"E-A-G-L-E-S, Eagles!\" chant.[273] The United States ultimately won that match 4–0. Along with their fierce devotion, Eagles fans have a reputation for bad behavior and sports-related violence, especially when the team plays its rivals.[274] One of the most famous incidents occurred in the 1968 season when fans of the struggling 2–11 Eagles pelted snowballs at an incarnation of Santa Claus during a halftime Christmas celebration.[275] In 2006, HarperCollins published If Football's a Religion, Why Don't We Have a Prayer?, a book by Jereé Longman, in which he describes the fans of the 700 Level at Veterans Stadium as having a reputation for \"hostile taunting, fighting, public urination and general strangeness.\"[276] A 1997 game against the San Francisco 49ers in Philadelphia featured so many incidents that, beginning at the following home game, the Eagles appointed a judge, Seamus McCaffery, to preside over a temporary courtroom at the stadium; 20 suspects came before him that day.[274] Fan behavior improved after the team's move to Lincoln Financial Field, and \"Eagles Court\" ended in December 2003.[277] The 1976 Philadelphia Eagles season was the subject of the movie Invincible.[278] The movie stars Mark Wahlberg as Vince Papale, a part-time school teacher, who is a diehard Eagles fan who became an Eagles player. The film differs slightly from true events as the selection process was invitation-only, and Papale had at least some previous playing experience.[279] The film Silver Linings Playbook highlights the 2008 Philadelphia Eagles season, and the novel mentions the 2006 team.[280] The film was critically acclaimed and nominated for several awards including 8 Academy Awards.[281][282] The award-winning comedy series It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia makes several references to the Philadelphia Eagles, most notably on Season 3, Episode 2, \"The Gang Gets Invincible,\" a reference to the 2006 Wahlberg film.[283] The Eagles are referenced in the 1978 Academy Award-winning movie The Deer Hunter. During a hunting trip in Pennsylvania, Nick and Stan are in a bar, and Nick says, \"Hey, I got a hundred bucks says the Eagles never cross the fifty in the next half and Pittsburgh wins by 20!\" Stan responds, \"And I got an extra twenty says the Eagles' quarterback wears a dress!\"[284]",

                "content": "SoftBank Group Corp. (ソフトバンクグループ株式会社, SofutoBanku Gurūpu Kabushiki gaisha) is a Japanese multinational investment holding company headquartered in Minato, Tokyo, Japan which focuses on investment management.[3] The group primarily invests in companies operating in technology that offer goods and services to customers in a multitude of markets and industries ranging from the internet to automation.[4] With over $100 billion in capital at its onset, SoftBank's Vision Fund is the world's largest technology-focused venture capital fund. Fund investors included sovereign wealth funds from countries in the Middle East.[5][6][7] The company is known for the leadership of its controversial[8][9][10][11] founder and largest shareholder Masayoshi Son.[12][13][14] Its investee companies, subsidiaries and divisions, including several unprofitable unicorns,[15][16] operate in robotics, artificial intelligence, software, logistics, transportation, biotechnology, robotic process automation, proptech, real estate, hospitality, broadband, fixed-line telecommunications, e-commerce, information technology, finance, media and marketing, and other areas.[17] Among its most internationally recognizable current stockholdings are stakes in Arm[18] (semiconductors), Alibaba[19] (e-commerce), OYO Rooms[20] (hospitality), WeWork[21] (coworking) and Deutsche Telekom[22] (telecommunications). SoftBank Corporation, its spun-out affiliate and former flagship business, is the third-largest wireless carrier in Japan, with 45.621 million subscribers as of March 2021.[23] SoftBank was ranked in the 2017 Forbes Global 2000 list as the 36th largest public company in the world[24] and the second-largest publicly traded company in Japan after Toyota.[25] The logo of SoftBank is based on the flag of the Kaientai, a naval trading company founded in 1865, near the end of the Tokugawa shogunate, by Sakamoto Ryōma.[26] Although SoftBank does not affiliate itself to any traditional keiretsu, it has close ties with Mizuho Financial Group, its primary lender.[27] SoftBank was founded in September 1981 as SOFTBANK Corp by then-24-year-old Masayoshi Son, initially as a software distributor. The company entered the publishing business in May 1982 with the launches of the Oh! PC and Oh! MZ magazines, about NEC and Sharp computers respectively.[28] Oh!PC had a circulation of 140,000 copies by 1989.[29] It would go on to become Japan's largest publisher of computer and technology magazines and trade shows. In 1994, the company went public, valued at $3 billion.[29] In September 1995, SoftBank agreed to purchase US-based Ziff Davis publishing for $2.1 billion.[30] In the 1990s, Son made large investments in Internet services and the so-called new economy in general. SoftBank bought COMDEX from The Interface Group on 1 April 1995 for $800 million and ZDI on 29 February 1996.[31][32] SoftBank sold COMDEX to Key3Media, a spin-off of Ziff Davis, in 2001.[33] In 1996, SoftBank formed a joint venture with American internet company Yahoo!, creating Yahoo! Japan (now LY Corporation), which would become a dominant site in the country.[34] In another highly publicized investment, SoftBank bought 80% of memory manufacturers Kingston Technology in 1996. When the owners-founders (John Tu and David Sun) announced plans to distribute $100,000,000 of the $1.5B windfall to Kingston employees, it created a very high-profile media stir that lasted well through the 1996 Christmas season; it was on all US networks, as well as international media. A few years later, in 1999, after the market for memory softened substantially, SoftBank sold the company back at a loss to the original owners for about a third of the original price.[35] In October 1999, SoftBank became a holding company.[36] In 2000, SoftBank made its most successful investment – $20 million to a then-fledgling Chinese Internet venture called Alibaba.[37] This investment turned into $60 billion when Alibaba went public in September 2014.[38][39] In February 2000, SoftBank Ventures Asia was founded under the leadership of Masayoshi Son to focus on investment in Korean-based Internet companies.[40] On 28 January 2005, SoftBank became the owner of the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks, a Nippon Professional Baseball team. On 17 March 2006, SoftBank announced its agreement to buy Vodafone Japan, giving it a stake in Japan's $78 billion mobile markets. In April 2006, SoftBank purchased a 23% stake in Betfair, an Internet betting exchange. In August 2006, SoftBank sold all its shares of SBI Group to a subsidiary of SBI's holding company, making SBI independent. On 1 October 2006, Vodafone Japan changed its corporate name and service brand name to \"SoftBank Mobile\" and \"SoftBank\" respectively.[41] On 28 January 2008, it was announced that SoftBank and Tiffany & Co. collaborated in making a limited 10 model-only phone. This phone contains more than 400 platinum diamonds, totaling more than 20 carats. The cost is said to be more than 100,000,000 yen.[42] On 3 February 2010, SoftBank acquired 13.7% in Ustream.[43] On 1 October 2010, Ayumi Hamasaki became the commercial spokesperson.[44] On 3 October 2012, the takeover of competitor eAccess was announced.[45] On 1 July 2013, SoftBank announced that Willcom was a wholly-owned subsidiary, after the termination of rehabilitation proceedings. eAccess was merged with Willcom, which resulted in a new subsidiary and brand from Yahoo! Japan, Ymobile Corporation.[46] On 15 October 2012, SoftBank announced plans to take control of American Sprint Nextel by purchasing a 70% stake for $20 billion.[47] On 6 July 2013, the United States Federal Communications Commission approved SoftBank's acquisition for $22.2 billion for a 78% ownership interest in Sprint.[48] On 6 August 2013, SoftBank bought 2% more shares of Sprint Corporation, increasing its ownership stake to 80%. In October 2013, SoftBank acquired a 51% stake in Supercell for a reported $2.1 billion.

In 2014, teams from both companies co-designed Pepper, a humanoid robot. In 2015, SoftBank increased its stake to 95%.[51][52] In 2015, SoftBank acquired DramaFever.[53] In May 2015, Masayoshi Son said he would appoint Nikesh Arora, a former Google executive, as Representative Director and President of SoftBank. Arora had been heading SoftBank's investment arm.[54] On 1 June 2015, SoftBank acquired an additional 22.7% stake in Supercell, increasing its total stake to 73.2% and becoming the sole external shareholder of the company.[55] In June 2015, SoftBank announced it would invest US$1 billion in the Korean e-commerce website Coupang as part of its overseas expansion plans.[56] In July 2015, SoftBank announced the renaming of the company from SoftBank Corp to SoftBank Group Corp. Meanwhile, SoftBank Mobile was renamed to SoftBank Corp, the now-former name of the company as a whole.[57] On 16 February 2016, SoftBank announced they would repurchase a record 14.2% of shares, valued at $4.4bn, to boost investor confidence.[58] On 31 March 2016, they announced they would sell shares worth $7.9 billion of their stake in Alibaba Group. On 21 June 2016, SoftBank sold its 84% stake in Supercell for a reported US$7.3 billion to Tencent.[59] On 3 June 2016, Softbank agreed to sell most of its stake in GungHo Online Entertainment (approximately 23.47%) for about $685 million, ending Softbank's majority ownership.[60][61][62] The offer was completed by 22 June.[63][64] In June 2016, Nikesh Arora stepped down amidst pressure from investors. Board member Ron Fisher and Baer Capital Partners founder Alok Sama undertook Arora's overseas investment duties.[65] One month later,[66] Son announced the company's largest deal ever to buy British chip designer Arm Holdings for more than US$32 billion.[67][68] This acquisition was completed on 5 September 2016.[69] On 6 December 2016, after meeting with the then United States President-elect Donald Trump, chief executive Masayoshi Son announced SoftBank would be investing US$50 billion in the United States toward businesses creating 50,000 new jobs.[70][71][72] On 30 January 2017, the Wall Street Journal wrote that SoftBank Group was \"weighing an investment of well over $1 billion in shared-office space company WeWork, in what could be among the first deals from its new $100 billion technology fund.\"[73] On 20 March, SoftBank bought a $300m stake in WeWork.[74] On 14 February 2017, SoftBank Group agreed to buy Fortress Investment Group LLC for $3.3 billion.[66] In February 2017, it was announced that Social Finance Inc. was close to raising $500 million from an investor group led by Silver Lake, including Softbank.[75] On 28 March 2017, the Wall Street Journal reported that SoftBank Group Corporation had approached Didi Chuxing Technology Co. about investing $6 billion to help the ride-hailing firm expand in self-driving car technologies, with the bulk of the money to come from SoftBank's planned $100 billion Vision Fund.[76] On 18 May 2017, it was reported that Softbank had completed its single largest investment in India to date, investing $1.4 billion in Paytm.

The fund is reported to focus on AI-based technology and invest approximately $108 billion, including $38 billion of its own funds.[85] In February 2020, however, a report from Wall Street Journal stated the fund would only up with less than half of that capital.[86] On 8 June 2017, Alphabet Inc. announced the sale of Boston Dynamics (robotics companies whose products include BigDog) to SoftBank Group for an undisclosed sum.[87] On 25 August 2017, SoftBank finalized a $4.4 billion investment in WeWork.[88] On 24 October 2017, Son announced the group would collaborate with Saudi Arabia to develop Neom, the new high-tech business and industrial city of the Saudi Kingdom.[89] On 14 November 2017, Softbank agreed to invest $10 billion into Uber.[90] On 29 December 2017, it was reported that a SoftBank-led consortium had invested $9 billion into Uber.

The sale is speculated to mark a shift in the company's trajectory, moving away from investments in solar energy towards companies dealing with artificial intelligence.[131][132][133] Later that month, Bloomberg reported that Vision Fund could go public via a $300 million SPAC in 2021, listing in Amsterdam.[134] In July 2021, Softbank announced that it would acquire the Yahoo Japan brand from Verizon Communications for $1.6 billion.[135][136] In August 2021, Son said he would begin to make personal investments alongside Softbank Group's Vision Fund 2.[137] In August 2022, Softbank said that it sold its entire Uber holdings in April–July 2022.[138] It was also reported that Softbank exited Opendoor in that quarter.[139] Five years after Masayoshi Son’s $100 billion fund entered the financial world to much fanfare, Softbank’s venture firm was crumbling and on the verge of collapse. Its large venture vehicles struggled badly, performing in the bottom of the asset class, and many of Son’s closest associates in the effort had departed from the company.[140] In February 2023, Toyota Tsusho announced that it had bought the controlling interest in SB Energy, which would become a subsidiary, alongside Toyota Tsusho subsidiary Eurus Energy.[141] In April 2023, SoftBank Group Corp. announced it was selling to a Singapore-based company run by Masayoshi Son’s youngest brother its Korea-based early-stage venture capital arm SoftBank Ventures Asia Corp. after suffering billions of dollars in losses from failed startup bets.[142] In May 2023, the SoftBank Group announced that losses from the SoftBank Vision Fund had widened 70 percent to a record $32 billion from a year ago.[143] In another divestiture of assets, SoftBank Group also sold the stake in Fortress Investment Group to Mubadala and Fortress' management.[144] SoftBank Group's Arm filed for an IPO on 21 August 2023 on the Nasdaq.[145][146] A few days earlier, SoftBank bought back the 25% stake from Vision Fund for around $16 billion, valuing Arm at over $64 billion.[147] Arm went public on 14 September 2023 raising $4.87 billion at a $54.5 billion valuation, with SoftBank continuing to own 90.6% of the company following the offering.[148][149][150] In December 2023, telecommunication and networking company SoftBank Corp, a subsidiary of SoftBank Group Corp, paid 513 million dollars for a controlling stake in Irish technology company Cubic Telecom, in a deal that will net the company’s founders and its private backers a multimillion-euro payout.[151][152] On June 27, 2024, Bloomberg reported that SoftBank has invested in the AI search startup Perplexity AI, valuing the company at $3 billion. Perplexity AI, known for its advanced artificial intelligence technology, aims to revolutionize online search experiences. This investment aligns with SoftBank's ongoing strategy to support innovative AI companies, highlighting Perplexity AI's potential in the tech industry. The funding is expected to accelerate the startup's growth and development, further enhancing its AI capabilities and market reach.[153] In December 2024, it was reported by CNBC that Softbank plans to invest $100 billion in the US over the next 4 years, with funding coming from various sources controlled by Softbank, including the Vision Fund, capital projects or chipmaker Arm Holdings. [154] As of 30 September 2020, SoftBank ownership is as follows:[155][156] By December 2022, Masayoshi Son’s stake in the company he founded had risen to 34.2% from 32.2% as of the end of September.[157] SoftBank's corporate profile includes various other companies such as Japanese broadband company SoftBank BB, data center company IDC Frontier and the publishing company SB Creative. SBI Group is a Japanese financial services company that began in 1999 as a branch of SoftBank.[158] Ymobile Corporation is another telecommunications subsidiary of SoftBank, established in 2014. In 2010, SoftBank founded Wireless City Planning (WCP), a subsidiary that planned the development of TD-LTE networks throughout Japan.[159] SoftBank also operates SoftBank Capital, a US-based venture capital company. SoftBank owns the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks professional baseball team. SoftBank also operated in the eco-power industry through subsidiary SB Energy until its sale. It has various partnerships in Japanese subsidiaries of foreign companies such as Yahoo! (which has resulted in Yahoo! Japan), E-Trade, Ustream.tv, EF Education First and Morningstar. It also has stakes in Alibaba Group and Sprint Corporation.[74] Other holdings include Softbank Corp.

SoftBank Corp. (ソフトバンク株式会社, SofutoBanku Kabushikigaisha) is SoftBank's telecommunications subsidiary, providing both mobile and fixed-line services. It was called SoftBank Mobile until July 2015, when the Group merged SoftBank BB Corp., SoftBank Telecom Corp. and Ymobile Corporation to reflect its fixed-line and ISP operations.[164] SoftBank's mobile communications arm began with the formation of Japan Telecom in 1984. The Digital Phone Group (デジタルホン, DPG, three local companies) mobile phone division was formed in 1994, and J-PHONE Co., Ltd. (J-フォン) was formed in 1999 by the DGP/ Digital TU-KA Group merger (DTG, six local companies, not to be confused with TU-KA). Japan Telecom owned a stake of 45.1%. J-PHONE grew steadily for a decade by introducing new services and enhancements such as SkyWalker for PDC, SkyMelody ringtone download, the Sha-Mail picture mail introduced following camera phones developed by SHARP, the mobile multimedia data service J-Sky modeled after NTT DoCoMo's i-mode, and advanced Java services based on JSCL, modeled after NTT DoCoMo's DoJa based i-appli. In October 2001, the British mobile phone group Vodafone increased its share to 66.7% of Japan Telecom and 69.7% of J-Phone. On 1 October 2003, the company's name and the service brand changed to Vodafone, while the division was called Vodafone K.K. or Vodafone Japan.[165] However, in January 2005, Vodafone Japan lost 58,700 customers and in February 2005 lost 53,200 customers, while competitors NTT DoCoMo gained 184,400 customers, while Au by KDDI gained 163,700, and Willcom gained 35,000. While as of February 2005, DoCoMo's FOMA 3G service had attracted 10 million subscribers and KDDI's 3G service had attracted over 17 million subscribers, Vodafone's 3G service only attracted 527,300 subscribers. Vodafone 3G failed to attract subscribers because Vodafone reduced investments in 3G services in Japan in 2002/3; handsets did not fully match the needs and preferences of Japanese customers. At the end of February 2005, Vodafone Japan had 15.1 million customers. By the end of October 2005, the number of subscribers had fallen below 15M. During the same period, NTT DoCoMo gained 1.65 million customers, and KDDI/AU gained 1.82 million customers. Vodafone-Japan had only 4.8% of Japan's 3G market. Vodafone changed the name of its multimedia data services from J-Sky to Vodafone live! and used J-Sky's principles, technologies, and business models to introduce the WAP-based Vodafone live! in Vodafone's other markets. At the end of February 2005, Vodafone live! had 12.907 million subscribers in Japan. By the end of October 2005, the number of Vodafone live! subscribers had fallen by 138,000. In March 2006, Vodafone began discussing the sale of the Vodafone Japan unit to SoftBank. Vodafone was unable to satisfy customers. Handsets had user interfaces that differed too much from the Japanese interface and lacked competitive features. On 17 March 2006, Vodafone Group announced it had agreed to sell Vodafone Japan to SoftBank for about US$15.1 billion. On 18 May 2006, the unit was renamed \"SoftBank Mobile Corp.\", effective 1 October 2006. On 4 June 2008, SoftBank Mobile announced a partnership with Apple and brought the iPhone (3G) to Japan later in 2008.[166] SoftBank Mobile was the only official carrier of the iPhone in Japan until the release of iPhone 4S in 2011, when au by KDDI began to offer it.[167] SoftBank Corp.'s mobile network operates W-CDMA (UMTS 3G) network (\"SoftBank 3G\"). SoftBank's 3G network is compatible with UMTS and supports transparent global roaming for UMTS subscribers from other countries. Since May 2006, SoftBank's telecommunications marketing and commercials have principally revolved around \"Otosan sujan karki\", the canine patriarch of the otherwise human \"Shirason, Kaito\" family.[170] \"Otosan\" translates to father, and the character, a Hokkaido dog, indeed acts as the father of the family, along with the son \"Kojiro\" (starred by Dante Carver), mom \"Masako\" (Kanako Higuchi), and daughter \"Aya\" (Aya Ueto).[171] The advertising series proved to be popular: CM Research Center ranked the Otousan adverts as the most popular in Japan between 2007 and 2012, based on monthly surveys of 3,000 randomly selected adults.[172][173] SoftBank partnered with the Ingress augmented reality game, supporting the branded \"SoftBank Ultra Link\" in-game item.[174] SoftBank bought a \"team\" for the America's Cup. The team was named SoftBank Team Japan, and Yanmar came on board. SoftBank Team Japan raced in the 2017 races held in Bermuda. The team members come from various backgrounds, most of whom were not Japanese.[175] The company was the official jersey sponsor of the Japanese national basketball team at the official 2017 Asian Basketball Championship in Lebanon[176] as well as the 2019 FIBA World Cup. SoftBank has also owned the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks, a Japanese professional baseball team based in Fukuoka, since 2005. The SoftBank logo appears on the jersey, and the team has won seven Japan Series championships under SoftBank, all of which came between 2011 and 2020. In 2015, SoftBank, along with some other companies in Japan,[177] offered a baby bonus for employees who have children. The payments range from 50,000 yen for the first child to 5 million yen for the fifth child.[178][179][180] SoftBank Investment Advisers oversees SoftBank's Vision Fund, created in 2017, which invests in emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, robotics and the internet of things.[181] It intended to develop a portfolio of 125 AI companies.[182] According to the fund and Son, it also invested in companies to revolutionize real estate, transportation, and retail. Son claimed he would make personal connections with the CEOs of all companies funded by Vision Fund in order to boost synergies among them.[183] Son’s original plans were to raise $100 billion for a new fund every few years, investing about $50 billion a year in startups.[184] By 2023, after the launch of Vision Fund 1 and 2, the dismal performance[185] of SoftBank’s funds had cast a shadow over the initial exuberance of both Masayoshi Son and his company regarding its huge, largely unprofitable intercorporate investments[186] that had become the main mission, vision and purpose of the entire SoftBank Group.[187][188][189] SoftBank Ventures Asia (SBVA) was the global early-stage venture capital arm of the SoftBank Group[190] The firm focused on early-stage ICT investments – including Artificial Intelligence (AI), the internet of things (IoT), and smart robotics.[191] By October 2021, SBVA had backed more than 250 companies in 10 countries with US$1.3 billion fund under management.[192] SoftBank Ventures Asia (SBVA) was founded in 2000 as SoftBank Ventures Korea[191] and began its focus on South Korean market[191] and its early-stage ventures.[190] SBVA’s one of the early investments in South Korea included Nexon Co, now a Korean-Japanese gaming publisher that was the largest IPO in Japan for 2011.[190] SoftBank Ventures Asia (SBVA) expanded its focus beyond South Korea since 2011 and made several notable investments in Southeast Asia,[193] such as Tokopedia,[194] an Indonesian e-commerce platform, and Carro, Singapore's used-car platform.[195] In 2018, SBVA launched a $300m venture fund ‘China Venture Fund I’,[191] targeting Chinese start-ups,[196] then immediately trailed by ‘SoftBank Acceleration Fund’ with $300M the following year.[190] With continuous investment across Asia and beyond, the company renamed itself as SoftBank Ventures Asia to reflect its broadened focus on startups in the Asia-Pacific region beyond South Korea, and opened offices in Seoul,[197] Singapore, and Beijing. With the company’s extended expertise in ICT investment, SBVA is aiming towards two investment themes, which were ‘technology innovation’ in AI,[191] Robotics, Semiconductor, Mobility, and AR/VR, and ‘market innovation’ in consumer, enterprise, shared economy, healthcare, etc.[192] SBVA created $160M ‘future innovation fund’ in March 2021, focusing on AI start-ups[198] and made investment in AI sector including VoyagerX, AI software developer,[199] Upstage AI, AI solution provider,[199] and MarqVision, AI-powered intellectual property (IP) protection platform.[200] In April 2023, it was known that Masayoshi Son's SoftBank Group would sell its early-stage venture capital arm SoftBank Ventures Asia to Singapore-based The Edgeof, a newly formed investment firm led by Son's youngest brother, Taizo Son, as SoftBank Group grappled with steep losses in a myriad of investments made around the world.[201] The operation raised governance concerns.[202]",

                "content": "The Seattle Seahawks are a professional American football team based in Seattle. The Seahawks compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the National Football Conference (NFC) West division. The club entered the NFL as an expansion team in 1976 in the NFC. From 1977 to 2001, Seattle was assigned to the American Football Conference (AFC) West; the team rejoined the NFC in 2002. They have played their home games at Lumen Field in Seattle's SoDo neighborhood since 2002, having previously played home games in the Kingdome (1976–1999) and Husky Stadium (1994 and 2000–2001).[a] Seahawks fans have been referred to collectively as the \"12s\" (formerly the \"12th Man\"),[11][12][13] or the \"12th Fan\".[14][15][16][17][18] The team's fans twice set the Guinness World Record for the loudest crowd noise at a sporting event within the span of a few months, first registering 136.6 decibels during a game against the San Francisco 49ers in September 2013,[19] and later registering 137.6 dB during a Monday Night Football game against the New Orleans Saints that December.[20][21] As the only NFL team based in the Pacific Northwest region of North America, the Seahawks attract support from a wide geographical area that includes parts of the U.S. states of Alaska, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and Utah, as well as the Canadian province of British Columbia.[22] The Seahawks have won 11 division titles and three conference championships, and are the only team to have played in both the AFC and NFC Championship Games. They have reached three Super Bowls, losing 21–10 to the Pittsburgh Steelers at Super Bowl XL, defeating the Denver Broncos 43–8 for their first championship at Super Bowl XLVIII, and losing 28–24 to the New England Patriots at Super Bowl XLIX. Players Kenny Easley, Walter Jones, Steve Hutchinson, Cortez Kennedy, and Steve Largent have been voted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame primarily or wholly for their accomplishments as Seahawks. In addition, players Dave Brown, Jacob Green, Dave Krieg, Curt Warner, Jim Zorn, Matt Hasselbeck and Shaun Alexander have been inducted into the Seahawks Ring of Honor, along with head coaches Chuck Knox, and Mike Holmgren, radio announcer Pete Gross, and franchise owner Paul Allen. As per one of the agreed parts of the 1970 AFL–NFL merger, the NFL began planning to expand from 26 to 28 teams.[23] In June 1972, Seattle Professional Football Inc., a group of Seattle business and community leaders, announced their intention to acquire an NFL franchise for the city of Seattle.[24] In June 1974, the NFL gave the city an expansion franchise.[25] That December, NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle announced the official signing of the franchise agreement by Lloyd W. Nordstrom, representing the Nordstrom family as majority partners for the consortium.[26] In March 1975, John Thompson, former executive director of the NFL Management Council and a former Washington Huskies executive, was hired as the general manager of the new team. The name Seattle Seahawks (\"seahawk\" is another name for osprey) was selected on June 17, 1975, after a public naming contest which drew more than 20,000 entries and over 1,700 names.[27] These include skippers, pioneers, and lumberjacks.[28] Thompson recruited and hired Jack Patera, a Minnesota Vikings assistant coach, to be the first head coach of the Seahawks; the hiring was announced on January 3, 1976. The expansion draft was held March 30–31, 1976, with Seattle and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers alternating picks for rounds selecting unprotected players from the other 26 teams in the league.[29] The Seahawks were awarded the 2nd overall pick in the 1976 draft, a pick they used on defensive tackle Steve Niehaus. The team took the field for the first time on August 1, 1976, in a pre-season game against the San Francisco 49ers in the then newly opened Kingdome. The Seahawks are the only NFL team to switch conferences twice in the post-merger era.[33] The franchise began play in 1976 in the aforementioned NFC West but switched conferences with the Buccaneers after one season and joined the AFC West. This realignment was dictated by the league as part of the 1976 expansion plan, so that both expansion teams could play each other twice and every other NFL franchise once (the ones in their conference at the time) during their first two seasons. The Seahawks won both matchups against the Buccaneers in their first two seasons, the former of which was the Seahawks' first regular season victory.[34][35] In 1983, the Seahawks hired Chuck Knox as head coach. Finishing with a 9–7 record, the Seahawks made their first post-season appearance, defeating the Denver Broncos in the Wild Card Round, and then the Miami Dolphins, before losing in the AFC Championship to the eventual Super Bowl champion Los Angeles Raiders. The following season, the Seahawks had their best season to that point, finishing 12–4; it would remain the best win–loss record in franchise history until their 2005 season.[36] Knox won the NFL Coach of the Year Award.[37] In 1988, Ken Behring and partner Ken Hofmann purchased the team for a reported $80 million.[38][39][40] The Seahawks won their first division title in 1988, but would miss the playoffs for the following three seasons, after which Knox left the team.[41] For most of the 1990s, the Seahawks continued to struggle. They saw three consecutive losing seasons (1992–1994) under head coach Tom Flores, including a franchise worst 2–14 season in 1992. Following the 1994 season, Flores was fired from the team and Dennis Erickson was brought in as head coach.[42][43][44][45][46] In 1996, Behring and Hoffman transferred the team's operations to Anaheim, California–a widely criticized move, although the team continued to play in Seattle. The team almost relocated, and was in bankruptcy for a short period. The NFL threatened Behring with fining him $500,000 a day if he did not move the team's operations back to Seattle;[47] with this, Behring and Hoffman sold the team to Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen in 1997 for $200 million.[48] Erickson's tenure as head coach ended after the 1998 season; the Seahawks missed the playoffs for all four of his seasons with the team, extending their \"playoff drought\" to ten consecutive seasons.[49] In 1999, Mike Holmgren was hired as head coach.[50] He would coach for 10 seasons.[51] The Seahawks won their second division title, as well as a wild card berth in the playoffs, losing to the Miami Dolphins 20–17. In 2002, the Seahawks returned to the NFC West as part of an NFL realignment plan that gave each conference four balanced divisions of four teams each. This realignment restored the AFC West to its initial post-merger roster of original AFL teams Denver, San Diego, Kansas City, and Oakland.[52] That same year, the team opened its new home stadium, Seahawks Stadium, after spending the last two seasons at Husky Stadium after the Kingdome's implosion in 2000.[53] In the 2005 season, the Seahawks had their best season in franchise history (a feat that would later be matched in 2013) with a record of 13–3,[54] which included a 42–0 rout of the Philadelphia Eagles in a Monday Night Football game.[55] The 13–3 record earned them the number one seed in the NFC.[54] They defeated the Washington Redskins in the Divisional Round and won the NFC Championship Game against the Carolina Panthers, but lost in Super Bowl XL against the Pittsburgh Steelers. The loss was controversial; NFL Films has Super Bowl XL at number 8 on its top ten list of games with controversial referee calls.[56] Referee Bill Leavy later admitted that he missed calls that altered the game.[57] Before 2005, the Seahawks had not won a playoff game since the 1984 season, a streak of 21 years (five teams had ever had a drought of twenty years at the time, with their six straight losses being tied for third-most in history). That drought was ended with a 20–10 win over the Washington Redskins in the 2005 playoffs.[58] In the 2006 season, the Seahawks finished 9–7 and won the NFC West.[59] The defeated the Dallas Cowboys 21–20 in the Wild Card Round before losing to the Chicago Bears 27–24 in the Divisional Round.[60][61] In the 2007 season, the Seahawks finished 10–6 and won the NFC West.[62] The team defeated Washington in the Wild Card Round 35–14 before losing to the Green Bay Packers in the Divisional Round 42–20.[63][64] The 2008 season saw the team go 4–12 and finish third in the NFC West.[65] Holmgren departed from the team after the 2008 season, following the end of his contract.[66] Defensive backs coach Jim L. Mora was named as Holmgren's successor.[67] In 2009, the Seahawks finished 3rd in the NFC West with a 5–11 record.[68] Shortly after, Mora was fired on January 8, 2010.[69] In the 2010 NFL season, the Seahawks made history by making it into the playoffs despite having a 7–9 record.[70] They had the best record in a division full of teams with losing seasons (Seahawks 7–9, Rams 7–9, 49ers 6–10, Cardinals 5–11) and won the decisive season finale against the Rams (not only by overall record, but by division record, as both teams coming into the game had a 3–2 division record).[71] In the playoffs, the Seahawks beat the defending Super Bowl XLIV champs, the New Orleans Saints, 41–36. The Seahawks made even more history during the game with Marshawn Lynch's 67-yard run, breaking 9 tackles, to clinch the victory. After the run, the fans reacted so loudly that a small earthquake (a bit above 2 on the Richter Scale) was recorded by seismic equipment around Seattle.[72] Lynch's run would be nicknamed the \"Beast Quake\". The Seahawks lost to the Bears in their second game, 35–24.[73] The 2011 season saw the team go 7–9 once again, but they were not able to get into the postseason with a third-place finish in the NFC West.[74] The 2012 NFL season started with doubt, as the Seahawks lost their season opener against the Arizona Cardinals. The highly touted Seattle defense gave up a go-ahead score late in the fourth quarter, and rookie quarterback Russell Wilson failed to throw the game-winning touchdown after multiple attempts in the red-zone. However, Russell Wilson and the Seahawks went 4–1 in their next five games en route to an 11–5 overall record (their first winning record since 2007). Their 2012 campaign included big wins over the Green Bay Packers, New England Patriots, and San Francisco 49ers. The Seahawks went into the playoffs as the No. 5 seed and the only team that season to go undefeated at home. In the Wild Card Round, the Seahawks overcame a 14-point deficit to defeat the Washington Redskins.[75] This was the first time since the 1983 Divisional Round that the Seahawks won a playoff game on the road.[76] However, in the 2012 Divisional Round, overcoming a 20-point, fourth-quarter deficit would not be enough to defeat the #1 seed Atlanta Falcons. An ill-advised timeout and a defensive breakdown late in the game cost the Seahawks their season, as they lost, 30–28.[77] Quarterback Russell Wilson won the 2012 Pepsi MAX Rookie of the Year award.[78] In the 2013 NFL season, the Seahawks continued their momentum from the previous season, finishing tied with the Denver Broncos for an NFL-best regular season record of 13–3, while earning the NFC's #1 playoff seed.[79][80] Their 2013 campaign included big wins over the Carolina Panthers, New Orleans Saints, and the San Francisco 49ers.[81] Six Seahawks players were named to the Pro Bowl: Quarterback Russell Wilson, center Max Unger, running back Marshawn Lynch, cornerback Richard Sherman, free safety Earl Thomas, and strong safety Kam Chancellor.[82] However, none of them were able to play in the Pro Bowl, as the Seahawks defeated the New Orleans Saints 23–15 and the San Francisco 49ers 23–17, in the playoffs to advance to Super Bowl XLVIII against the Denver Broncos.[83][84] On February 2, 2014, the Seahawks won the franchise's only Super Bowl Championship, defeating Denver 43–8.[85] The Seahawks' defense performance in 2013 was acclaimed as one of the best in the Super Bowl era.[86] The 2014 campaign saw the team lose some key pieces, including wide receiver Golden Tate to free agency and wide receiver Sidney Rice and defensive end Chris Clemons to retirement. Percy Harvin was also let go mid-season after several underachieving weeks and clashes with the rest of the locker room.[87] Despite starting 3–3, they rallied to a 12–4 record, good enough once again for the #1 seed in the NFC Playoffs.[88][89] After dispatching the Carolina Panthers handily in the Divisional Round 31–17,[90] they faced the Green Bay Packers in the NFC Championship Game. Despite five turnovers and trailing 19–7 late in the contest, the Seahawks prevailed in overtime to reach Super Bowl XLIX against the New England Patriots,[91] but an ill-fated interception at the 1-yard line late in the championship game stymied a comeback attempt and thwarted the Seahawks' bid to be the first repeat Super Bowl champions since the Patriots had won Super Bowls XXXVIII and XXXIX.[92] The Seahawks returned to the playoffs in both 2015 and 2016, but despite winning the Wild Card game in both years they failed to win either Divisional round game on the road.[93][94][95][96] The 2017 iteration of the team missed the playoffs for the first time in six years, as injuries to their core players coupled with disappointing acquisitions of running back Eddie Lacy and kicker Blair Walsh failed them in a competitive NFC.[97] The team cut ties with most of the remaining players that had been part of their meteoric rise and turnover both their Offensive and Defensive coaching staff in 2018, and an influx of young talent helped propel the team to a 10–6 record and another playoff berth that ultimately ended in a loss in the Wild Card game to the Dallas Cowboys.[98][99] In October 2018, owner Paul Allen died after a prolonged fight with cancer.[100] In 2019, the Seahawks put up their best record since their last trip to the Super Bowl at 11–5, but they still lost 3 out of their last 4 games and lost their chance to win the NFC West.[101] A likely explanation for their sloppy finish is because many of their players were injured late in the season. After defeating the Philadelphia Eagles 17–9 in the Wild Card game,[102] they lost to the Green Bay Packers in the Divisional round, failing another attempt at a second Super Bowl.[103] The 2020 season saw the Seahawks win their first five games, a franchise-best for a start to a season.[104] Despite the Seahawks losing three of their next four games, the Seahawks finished strong, earning twelve victories for the first time since their Super Bowl season in 2014, and winning the division for the first time in four years.[105] However, despite the 12–4 record and the division title, the Seahawks' season ended the following week against the Los Angeles Rams, who never trailed in a 30–20 victory.[106] The Seahawks struggled and started the 2021 season 3–8. Russell Wilson had an injured finger missing 3 games and the Seahawks were shut out the first time in the Wilson era in Week 10 against the Green Bay Packers.[107] This was their worst first half of a season since 2009, under then-head coach Jim Mora. The Seahawks were eliminated from playoff contention on December 26 in a loss to the Chicago Bears, and they finished last in their division for the first time since 1996.[108][109] With wins over the Detroit Lions and the Arizona Cardinals they finished 7–10.[110] Following the 2021 season was an offseason of continuing change, punctuated with the trade of quarterback Russell Wilson to the team he and the Seahawks beat in Super Bowl XLVIII, the Denver Broncos, on March 6, 2022. The Broncos traded quarterback Drew Lock, tight end Noah Fant, defensive end Shelby Harris, two first round picks (for that year's draft, No. 9 overall, and 2023's), two second round picks (that year's, No. 40 overall, and 2023's) and a 2022 fifth round selection to the Seahawks for Wilson and a 2022 fourth round pick. Another hallmark franchise player from the Super Bowl-winning Seahawks, former All-Pro linebacker Bobby Wagner, was also cut by the team that same day, a move that saves them $16.6 million in cap space. The Seahawks also took on $26 million in dead money by trading Wilson; ESPN Stats & Information research revealed it to be the second-most dead money a team has ever incurred, trailing the $33.8 million the Philadelphia Eagles ate in their trade of Carson Wentz the previous year.[111] In the 2022 season, the Seahawks finished with a 9–8 record and made the playoffs.[112] The team's season ended in the Wild Card round with a 41–23 loss to the San Francisco 49ers.[113] The 2023 season saw the Seahawks finish 9–8 and miss the postseason.[114] Carroll was fired from his head coaching position after the 2023 season.[115] Carroll remained with the team in an unspecified advisory role.[116] Mike Macdonald, formerly defensive coordinator of the Baltimore Ravens, was hired as the new head coach.[117] When the Seahawks debuted in 1976, the team's logo was a stylized royal blue and forest green osprey's head based on Kwakwakaʼwakw art masks.[118] The helmet and pants were silver while the home jerseys were royal blue with white and green sleeve stripes and white numerals and names. The road jersey was white, with white, blue and green sleeve stripes and had blue numerals and names. The socks were blue and had the same green and white striping pattern seen on the blue jerseys. Black shoes were worn for the first four seasons, one of the few NFL teams that did so in the late 1970s, at a time when most teams were wearing white shoes. They would switch to white shoes in 1980.[119][120] In 1983, coinciding with the arrival of Chuck Knox as head coach, the uniforms were updated slightly. The striping on the arms now incorporated the Seahawks logo, and the TV numbers, previously located on the sleeves, moved onto the shoulders. The helmet facemasks changed from gray to blue. Also, the socks went solid blue at the top, and white on bottom.[121] In the 1985 season, the team wore 10th Anniversary patches on the left side of their pants. It had the Seahawks logo streaking through the number 10. In 1994, the year of the NFL's 75th Anniversary, the Seahawks changed the style of their numbering to something more suitable for the team; Pro Block from then until 2001. That same year, the Seahawks wore a vintage jersey for select games resembling the 1976–82 uniforms. However, the helmet facemasks remained blue. The logos also became sewn on instead of being screen-printed. In 2000, Shaun Alexander's rookie year and Cortez Kennedy's last, the Seattle Seahawks celebrated their 25th Anniversary; the logo was worn on the upper left chest of the jersey. In 2001, the Seahawks switched to the new Reebok uniform system still in their then-current uniforms after that company signed a 10-year deal to be the exclusive uniform supplier to the NFL, but it would be their last in this uniform after the season ended. Prior to this, various companies made the team's uniforms. On March 1, 2002, to coincide with the team moving to the NFC as well as the opening of Seahawks Stadium (later renamed Qwest, CenturyLink, and currently Lumen Field), both the logo and the uniforms were heavily redesigned. The Wordmark was designed by Mark Verlander and the logo was designed by NFL Properties in-house design team. The colors were modified to a lighter \"Seahawks Blue\", a darker \"Seahawks Navy\" and lime green piping. The helmets also were changed from silver to the lighter \"Seahawks Blue\" color after a fan poll was conducted. Silver would not be seen again until 2012. The logo artwork was also subtly altered, with an arched eyebrow and a forward-facing pupil suggesting a more aggressive-looking bird. At first, the team had planned to wear silver helmets at home and blue helmets on the road, but since NFL rules forbid the use of multiple helmets, the team held the fan poll to decide which color helmet would be worn. The team had usually worn all blue at home and all white on the road since 2003, but late in the 2009 season, the Seahawks wore the white jersey-blue pants combo. The blue jersey and white pants combo has been worn for only one regular-season game, the 2005 season opener at the Jacksonville Jaguars, while the white jersey and blue pants combination has not been worn regularly since late in the 2002 season, with the exception of late in the 2009 season. In 2009, the Seahawks once again wore the white jersey and blue pants combination for road games against Minnesota (November 22), St. Louis (November 29), Houston (December 13), and Green Bay (December 27). The Seahawks wore their home blue jerseys during Super Bowl XL despite being designated as the visitor, since the Pittsburgh Steelers, the designated home team, elected to wear their white jerseys. On September 27, 2009, the Seahawks wore lime green jerseys for the first time, paired with new dark navy blue pants in a game against the Chicago Bears. The jerseys matched their new sister team, the expansion Seattle Sounders FC of Major League Soccer who wear green jerseys with blue pants. On December 6, 2009, the Seahawks wore their Seahawks blue jersey with the new dark navy blue pants for the first time, in a game against the San Francisco 49ers. The Seahawks broke out the same combo two weeks later against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and two weeks after that in the 2009 regular-season finale against the Tennessee Titans. In December 2009, then-coach Jim Mora announced that the new lime green jerseys were being retired because the team did not win in them, because he liked the standard blue home jerseys better, and added that the home jersey is a better match for the navy pants.[122] In the same press conference, he stated that the new navy pants \"felt better\" on players as opposed to the Seahawks blue pants. For the 2010 season, Seattle returned to the traditional all \"Seahawks Blue\" at home and all white on the road. On April 3, 2012, Nike, which took over as the official uniform supplier for the league from Reebok, unveiled new uniform and logo designs for the Seahawks for the 2012 season. The new designs incorporate a new accent color, \"Wolf Grey\", and the main colors are \"College Navy\" and \"Action Green\".[5][6] The uniforms incorporate \"feather trims\", multiple feathers on the crown of the helmet, twelve feathers printed on the neckline and down each pant leg to represent the \"12th Man\", referring to the team's fans.[123][124] The Seahawks have three different jersey colors: navy blue, white, and an alternate grey jersey. The Seahawks will have three different pants: navy blue with green feathers, gray with navy blue feathers, and white with navy blue feathers. Their new logo replaces the Seahawk blue with wolf grey. Altogether, there are nine different uniform combinations possible. The Seahawks wore their Nike home blue jerseys for the first regular-season game on September 16, 2012, against the Dallas Cowboys. The uniform Marshawn Lynch wore in that game is preserved at the Pro Football Hall of Fame.[125] On September 9, 2012, the Seahawks wore their Nike white away jerseys for the first regular-season game against the Arizona Cardinals; on October 14, 2012, with the Carolina Panthers wearing white at home, they wore their blue jerseys with gray pants (and would do so again against the Miami Dolphins seven weeks later); and on December 16, 2012, they wore their Alternate Wolf Grey jerseys for the first time against the Buffalo Bills.[126] The all-navy ensemble is the Seahawks' current primary uniform option for home games. Initially, the Seahawks paired their navy uniforms with gray pants on select road games in which the home team wore white jerseys, but on December 5, 2021, the Seahawks wore this combination at home for the first time in a game against the San Francisco 49ers. On the road, the Seahawks primarily pair their white uniforms with the navy pants (that combination was used during their Super Bowl XLVIII win), although they also pair the white uniforms with either white or gray pants on occasion. The all-gray uniforms were worn occasionally on the road, mainly against the Arizona Cardinals. In 2016, the Seahawks unveiled their NFL Color Rush uniform, an all-Action Green ensemble.[127] They first wore the uniform on December 16 against the Los Angeles Rams at home, marking the first time they wore green uniforms since 2009. The Seahawks continue to wear the Color Rush set as an alternate uniform alongside the all-gray combination. During a home matchup with the Vikings on December 3, 2019, the Seahawks wore their Color Rush green tops and regular navy pants.[128] The combination was used again on October 11, 2020, also against the Vikings, and then again on November 19, against the Arizona Cardinals. It was used once in 2021, on Thursday Night Football vs. the Rams. In July 2023, the Seahawks introduced a throwback uniform set inspired by the team's 1983–2001 design. These uniforms were worn in Week 8 against the Cleveland Browns.[129] Consequently, the gray alternate tops were retired due to NFL regulations restricting teams to two alternate jerseys.[130] Prior to 2023, the Seahawks were the only NFL team to have never worn white jerseys in a home game.[131] However, on September 24, 2023, the Seahawks wore their white jerseys at home for the first time, doing so against the Carolina Panthers. The game served as the 10th anniversary of the Seahawks' first Super Bowl victory, as the current team wore the same white jersey/navy pants combination from Super Bowl XLVIII.[132] The rivalry between the Seahawks and Los Angeles Rams came into existence in 2002 following the Seahawks' relocation to the NFC West. The first notable matchup between the two clubs occurred in the 2004 NFC Wild card round when the Rams managed to defeat the Seahawks in Seattle 27–20 and currently hold the streak for the only two wins against the Seahawks at home during the postseason. Much of the intensity waned as the Rams declined in competition throughout the 2000s and early 2010s, but several notable matchups between the two clubs would still occur. The rivalry saw new life as the Rams' Mob Squad-era teams regularly clashed with Seattle's Legion of Boom era teams, often escalating into bitter grudge matches for control of the division.[133][134] Following the Rams' return to Los Angeles in 2016, and subsequent playoff success (most recently with a Super Bowl victory in 2022); the rivalry has increased in intensity; especially as Seattle's Legion of Boom era teams waned in competition.[135] Due to the recent dominance by the Rams under Sean McVay and former defensive tackle Aaron Donald, Seahawks fans have recently viewed the Rams as their divisional arch rival.[136] Tensions especially ran high during the 2021 Wild Card game following a widely publicized taunt from Safety Jamal Adams during a postgame conference after a tough win over the Rams during week 16. The Rams would go onto decimate the Seahawks in the wild card game, with cornerback Jalen Ramsey and quarterback Jared Goff expressing their satisfaction to get retribution following Adams' comments and cigar gesture.[137] As of the 2023 season, the Seahawks lead the series 27–26, but the Rams have won both playoff meetings.[138] From 2011 to 2014, the Seahawks and the San Francisco 49ers emerged as two of the best teams in the NFC, and developed a rivalry as a result. The 49ers head coach at the time, Jim Harbaugh, had a contentious history with Seahawks coach Pete Carroll due to Harbaugh's previous job as coach at Stanford against Carroll's USC Trojans. Harbaugh's 49ers won the first three head-to-head contests but lost Week 16 of 2012. Both teams reached the playoffs that year, however the 49ers reached Super Bowl XLVII, which they lost. In 2013, the Seahawks won in a Week 2 contest, but the 49ers would triumph in Week 14. The Seahawks would beat the 49ers in the 2013 season NFC Championship Game 23–17 in a controversial win. The Seahawks went on to win the next 10 matchups, sweeping the regular season series against the 49ers from 2014 to 2018. Since then, however, the 49ers have won the last five contests against the Seahawks, winning the 2022 season regular season series, and a playoff matchup, as well as the 2023 regular season series. As of the 2023 season, the Seahawks lead the series 30–22.[139] The Arizona Cardinals and Seahawks became divisional rivals after both were relocated to the NFC West as a result of the league's realignment in 2002. This rivalry has become one of the NFL's more bitter in recent years, as the mid-to-late 2010s often saw the Seahawks and Cardinals squaring off for NFC West supremacy. The rivalry hit its peak as the Cardinals frequently clashed with the Legion Of Boom-era Seahawks led by Russell Wilson and head coach Pete Carroll, although Seattle shares more intense rivalries with the Rams and 49ers. Seattle leads the series 27–22–1, and the two teams have yet to meet in the playoffs.[140] Since moving to the NFC, the Seahawks have faced the Green Bay Packers several times in the playoffs, developing an intense rivalry as well. Some notable moments include the clubs' first playoff meeting in 2003 in which Seahawks quarterback Matt Hasselbeck threw a game-losing pick-six in overtime after guaranteeing a game-winning drive,[141] the Fail Mary, and Russell Wilson overcoming four interceptions and a 16–0 Packers lead to lead Seattle to a 28–22 overtime win to advance to Super Bowl XLIX.[142] As of the 2023 season, the Packers lead the all-time series 15–9.[143] From the 1980s to the 2002 league realignment, the Denver Broncos were a major rival for the Seahawks.[144][145] As of the 2023 season, the Broncos lead 35–23 against the Seahawks with Seattle having won both postseason meetings.[146] Since 2002, Denver has won three of five interconference meetings, and the teams met in Super Bowl XLVIII on February 2, 2014, where the Seahawks won 43–8.[147] On March 8, 2022, the Seattle Seahawks agreed to trade Russell Wilson and a 2022 fourth-round pick to the Denver Broncos for quarterback Drew Lock, tight end Noah Fant, defensive lineman Shelby Harris, two first-round picks (2022—No. 9 overall—and 2023), two second-round picks (2022—No. 40 overall—and 2023) and a 2022 fifth-round selection.[148] Russell Wilson's first game against the Seattle Seahawks as a member of the Denver Broncos was played September 12, 2022, on Monday Night Football, where the Seahawks won 17–16.[149] The Raiders and Seahawks played many times being old members of the AFC West. Seattle's move to the NFC has made the matchup occur much less frequently, playing only five times since the end of the 2002 season. The Raiders lead the all-time series 30–26.[150] During the Seahawks' first ten seasons (1976–85), the team's headquarters was in Kirkland at the southern end of the Lake Washington Shipyard (now Carillon Point), on the shores of Lake Washington.[151] The summer training camps were held across the state at Eastern Washington University in Cheney, southwest of Spokane. When the team's new headquarters across town in Kirkland was completed in 1986, the Seahawks held training camp at home for the next eleven seasons (1986–96), staying in the dormitories of the adjacent Northwest College. In 1997, Dennis Erickson's third season as head coach, the team returned to the hotter and more isolated Cheney for training camp, which continued through 2006. In 2007, training camp returned to the Seahawk's Kirkland facility because of the scheduled China Bowl (NFL) game, which was later canceled. In 2008, the Seahawks held the first three weeks of camp in Kirkland, then moved to the new 19-acre (77,000 m2) Virginia Mason Athletic Center (VMAC) on August 18 for the final week of training camp, where the team has held their training camps since. The new facility, adjacent to Lake Washington in Renton, has four full-size practice fields: three natural grass outdoors and one FieldTurf indoors.[152] As of the end of the 2023 season, the Seattle Seahawks have competed in 48 NFL seasons, dating back to their expansion year of 1976. The team has compiled a 392–366–1 (.517) regular-season record and a 17–19 (.472) record in the playoffs, for an overall record of 409–385–1 and a .515 winning percentage.[153] Seattle has reached the playoffs in 20 separate seasons, including in the 2005 season when they lost Super Bowl XL to the Pittsburgh Steelers, the 2013 season when they defeated the Denver Broncos to win Super Bowl XLVIII, and the 2014 season when they lost Super Bowl XLIX to the New England Patriots. In the 2010 season, the Seahawks became the first team in NFL history to earn a spot in the playoffs with a losing record (7–9, .438) in a full season; this was by winning the division. The Seahawks would go on to defeat the reigning Super Bowl champion New Orleans Saints in the Wild Card round, becoming the first team ever to win a playoff game with a losing record. Until Week 7 of the 2016 season against the Arizona Cardinals, the Seahawks had never recorded a tied game in their history.[154] Running backs (RB) Wide receivers (WR) Tight ends (TE) Defensive linemen (DL) Defensive backs (DB) Special teams Reserve 53 active, 7 reserve, 16 practice squad (+3 exempt) The 35th Anniversary team was voted upon by users on Seahawks.com and announced in 2010.[155] Bold indicates those elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

In 2002, the Seahawks began playing at what is now Lumen Field. Every regular season and playoff game at Lumen Field since the second week of the 2003 season has been played before a sellout crowd. Like the Kingdome before it, Lumen Field is one of the loudest stadiums in the league. The stadium's partial roof and seating decks trap and amplify the noise and reflect it back down to the field. This noise has caused problems for opposing teams, causing them to commit numerous false-start penalties. From 2002 through 2012, there have been 143 false-start penalties on visiting teams in Seattle, second only to the Minnesota Vikings.[168] The Seahawks' fans have twice set the Guinness World Record for the loudest crowd noise at a sporting event, first on September 15, 2013, registering 136.6 dB during a game against the San Francisco 49ers[19] and again on December 2, 2013, during a Monday Night Football game against the New Orleans Saints, with a roar of 137.6 dB.[20][21] As of September 29, 2014, the record of 142.2 dB is held in Arrowhead Stadium by fans of the Kansas City Chiefs.[169] Prior to kickoff of each home game, the Seahawks salute their fans by raising a giant #12 flag at the south end of the stadium.[170] Current and former players, coaches, local celebrities, prominent fans including Patti Hammond, Seattle-area athletes, and former owner Paul Allen have raised the flag. Earlier, the Seahawks retired the #12 jersey on December 15, 1984, as a tribute to their fans.[157] Before their Super Bowl win, the Seahawks ran onto the field under a giant 12th Man flag. In September 1990, Texas A&M University filed, and was later granted, a trademark application for the \"12th Man\" term, based on their continual usage of the term since the 1920s. In January 2006, Texas A&M filed suit against the Seattle Seahawks to protect the trademark and in May 2006, the dispute was settled out of court. In the agreement, which expired in 2016, Texas A&M licensed the Seahawks to continue using the phrase, in exchange for a licensing fee, public acknowledgement of A&M's trademark when using the term, a restriction in usage of the term to seven states in the Northwest United States, and a prohibition from selling any \"12th Man\" merchandise.[171][172][173] Once the agreement expired, the Seahawks were allowed to continue using the number \"12\" but were no longer permitted to use the \"12th Man\" phrase.[174] In August 2015, the Seahawks decided to drop their signage of the \"12th Man\" term and shifted towards referring to their fans as the \"12s\" instead.[175] Starting in the 1998 season, Blitz has been the Seahawks' official mascot.[176] Prior to the 2014 NFL season, Blitz was given a new look and a sidekick; a secondary mascot named Boom was introduced to appeal to and interact with younger children.[177][178] In the 2003 and 2004 seasons, a hawk named Faith would fly around the stadium just before the team came out of the tunnel. However, because of her relatively small size and an inability to be trained to lead the team out of the tunnel, Faith was replaced by an augur hawk named Taima before the start of the 2005 NFL season. Taima started leading the team out of the tunnel in September 2006.[179][180] A group of female and male cheerleaders known as the Seahawks Dancers rallies the crowd from the sidelines and performs a halftime routine during home games at Lumen Field. The group was an all-female squad called the Sea Gals prior to admitting male members and re-branding ahead of the 2019 NFL season.[181][182] During the off-season, a select performing group from the Dancers travels to parades and other events, as well as with other NFL Cheerleaders on the road. Beginning in 2004, the Seahawks introduced their drum line, the Blue Thunder.[183] The group plays at every home game as well as over 100 events in the Seattle community.

On local television broadcast preseason games are split between former Seahawks Paul Moyer, Sam Adkins, and Brock Huard. Pete Gross, who called the games from 1976 until just days before his death from cancer in 1992, is a member of the team's Ring of Honor. Other past announcers include Steve Thomas from 1992 to 1997, Lee Hamilton (also known as \"Hacksaw\") from 1998 to 1999, Brian Davis from 2000 to 2003, and former Seahawk Warren Moon from 2004 to 2017. Preseason games not shown on national networks were produced in-house by Seahawks Broadcasting and televised by KING-TV, channel 5 (and, in 2008, also on sister station KONG-TV since KING, an NBC affiliate, was committed to the Summer Olympics in China). Kate Scott became the announcer for Seahawks TV preseason games in 2023, replacing Curt Menefee (the host of Fox NFL Sunday) who had been the Seahawks TV voice since the 2009 preseason. KCPQ-TV, which airs most of the Seahawks' regular-season games (as the Seattle-Tacoma area's Fox affiliate), became the television partner for the team in 2012 and replaced KING-TV as broadcaster for preseason games, but KING-TV regained the partnership in 2022; simulcasts of any Seahawks games on ESPN's Monday Night Football air (as of the 2018 season) on CBS affiliate KIRO-TV.[188][189] In addition, any Saturday or Sunday afternoon games broadcast by CBS (usually—but not always—with the Seahawks hosting an AFC opponent) will air on KIRO-TV.

The same paycheck covers less goods, services, and bills. It is sometimes referred to as a “hidden tax,” as it leaves taxpayers less well-off due to higher costs and “bracket creep,” while increasing the government’s spending power. to prevent what is called “bracket creep.” Bracket creepBracket creep occurs when inflation pushes taxpayers into higher income tax brackets or reduces the value of credits, deductions, and exemptions. Bracket creep results in an increase in income taxes without an increase in real income. Many tax provisions—both at the federal and state level—are adjusted for inflation. occurs when inflation, rather than real increases in income, pushes people into higher income tax bracketsA tax bracket is the range of incomes taxed at given rates, which typically differ depending on filing status. In a progressive individual or corporate income tax system, rates rise as income increases. There are seven federal individual income tax brackets; the federal corporate income tax system is flat. or reduces the value they receive from credits and deductions. The IRS previously used the Consumer Price Index (CPI) as a measure of inflation prior to 2018. However, with the TaxA tax is a mandatory payment or charge collected by local, state, and national governments from individuals or businesses to cover the costs of general government services, goods, and activities. Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA), the IRS now uses the Chained Consumer Price Index (C-CPI) to adjust income thresholds, deduction amounts, and credit values accordingly. The new inflation adjustments are for tax year 2024, for which taxpayers will file tax returns in early 2025. In 2024, the income limits for every tax bracket and all filers will be adjusted for inflation and will be as follows (Table 1). The federal income tax has seven tax rates in 2024: 10 percent, 12 percent, 22 percent, 24 percent, 32 percent, 35 percent, and 37 percent. The top marginal income tax rate of 37 percent will hit taxpayers with taxable incomeTaxable income is the amount of income subject to tax, after deductions and exemptions. For both individuals and corporations, taxable income differs from—and is less than—gross income. above $609,350 for single filers and above $731,200 for married couples filing jointly. Tax policy can be complex. Thankfully our resources for understanding them aren’t. The standard deduction will increase by $750 for single filers and by $1,500 for joint filers (Table 2). Seniors over age 65 may claim an additional standard deduction of $1,950 for single filers and $1,550 for joint filers. The personal exemption for 2024 remains at $0 (eliminating the personal exemption was part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA). The alternative minimum tax (AMT) was created in the 1960s to prevent high-income taxpayers from avoiding the individual income taxAn individual income tax (or personal income tax) is levied on the wages, salaries, investments, or other forms of income an individual or household earns. The U.S. imposes a progressive income tax where rates increase with income. The Federal Income Tax was established in 1913 with the ratification of the 16th Amendment. Though barely 100 years old, individual income taxes are the largest source of tax revenue in the U.S. . This parallel income tax system requires high-income taxpayers to calculate their tax bill twice: once under the ordinary income tax system and again under the AMT. The taxpayer then needs to pay the higher of the two. The AMT uses an alternative definition of taxable income called alternative minimum taxable income (AMTI). To prevent low- and middle-income taxpayers from being subject to the AMT, taxpayers are allowed to exempt a significant amount of their income from AMTI. However, the exemption phases out for high-income taxpayers. The AMT is levied at two rates: 26 percent and 28 percent. The AMT exemption amount for 2024 is $85,700 for singles and $133,300 for married couples filing jointly (Table 3). In 2024, the 28 percent AMT rate applies to excess AMTI of $232,600 for all taxpayers ($116,300 for married couples filing separate returns). AMT exemptions phase out at 25 cents per dollar earned once AMTI reaches $609,350 for single filers and $1,218,700 for married taxpayers filing jointly (Table 4). The maximum earned income tax credit (EITC) in 2024 for single and joint filers is $632 if the filer has no children (Table 5). The maximum credit is $4,213 for one child, $6,960 for two children, and $7,830 for three or more children. The maximum child tax credit is $2,000 per qualifying child and is not adjusted for inflation. The refundable portion of the child tax credit is adjusted for inflation and will increase from $1,600 to $1,700 for 2024. Long-term capital gains face different brackets and rates than ordinary income (Table 6.) The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) includes a 20 percent deduction for pass-through businesses. Limits on the deduction begin phasing in for taxpayers with income above $191,950 (or $383,900 for joint filers) in 2024 (Table 7). In 2024, the first $18,000 of gifts to any person are excluded from tax, up from $17,000. The exclusion is increased to $185,000 from $175,000 for gifts to spouses who are not citizens of the United States.

But what often goes unnoticed is President Biden’s role in continuing Trump’s first trade war. In fact, more tax revenue from the trade war tariffs has been collected under Biden than under Trump.

The government decides how much tax you owe by dividing your taxable income into chunks — also known as tax brackets — and each individual chunk gets taxed at a corresponding tax rate. Tax rates can range from 10% to 37%. The beauty of tax brackets is that no matter which bracket(s) you’re in, you generally won’t pay that tax rate on your entire income. The highest tax rate you pay applies to only a portion of your income. Federal tax brackets example: If you had $50,000 of taxable income in 2024 as a single filer, you’d pay 10% on that first $11,600 and 12% on the chunk of income between $11,601 and $47,150. Then you’d pay 22% on the rest because some of your $50,000 of taxable income falls into the 22% tax bracket. The total bill would be about $6,053 — about 12% of your taxable income — even though your highest bracket is 22%. That 12% is your effective tax rate. » Need to back up? How to calculate taxable income States may handle taxes differently than the federal government. Your state might have different brackets, or it might altogether use a different system. Colorado, for example, has a flat tax rate of 4.4% on taxable income, and some states, such as Wyoming, don't have a state income tax. » MORE: Income tax rates and brackets by state Each year, all the federal income tax brackets — the window of income where a certain tax rate ends and begins — are updated to reflect the current rate of inflation. These tweaks, formally known as inflation adjustments, are a critical part of the tax code. Bracket adjustments can help prevent taxpayers from ending up in a higher tax bracket as their cost of living rises, a scenario called “bracket creep.\" They can also lower taxes for those whose compensation has not kept up with inflation. Tax inflation adjustment example In 2024, a single filer making $48,000 of taxable income pays a 10% tax rate on $11,600 of their earnings, a 12% tax rate on the portion of the earnings between $11,601 and $47,150, and a 22% tax rate on the remaining $850 that falls into that final tax bracket. Assuming this taxpayer's income does not change in 2025, they will now pay 10% on earnings up to $11,925 and 12% on the rest. In other words, they will no longer pay 22% on any part of their income. This is because the upper end of the 12% tax bracket has been updated from $47,150 to $48,475, which allows this taxpayer to shelter more of their income from a higher tax rate. The marginal tax rate is the tax rate paid on the last dollar of taxable income. It typically equates to your highest tax bracket. For example, if you're a single filer in 2024 with $35,000 of taxable income, portions of your income would be taxed at 10% and 12%. If your taxable income went up by $1, you would pay 12% on that extra dollar, too. » MORE: How to calculate your marginal tax rate Your effective tax rate is the percentage of your taxable income that you pay in taxes. To determine your effective tax rate, divide your total tax owed (line 24) on Form 1040 by your total taxable income (line 15). Two common ways of reducing your tax bill are credits and deductions. Tax credits can reduce your tax bill on a dollar-for-dollar basis; they don't affect what bracket you're in. Tax deductions, on the other hand, reduce how much of your income is subject to taxes. Generally, deductions lower your taxable income by the percentage of your highest federal income tax bracket. So, if you fall into the 22% tax bracket, a $1,000 deduction could save you $220. In other words, take all the tax deductions you can claim.

                "content": "An official website of the United States Government IR-2023-208, Nov. 9, 2023 WASHINGTON — The Internal Revenue Service today announced the annual inflation adjustments for more than 60 tax provisions for tax year 2024, including the tax rate schedules and other tax changes. Revenue Procedure 2023-34 provides detailed information about these annual adjustments. Starting in calendar year 2023, the Inflation Reduction Act reinstates the Hazardous Substance Superfund financing rate for crude oil received at U.S. refineries, and petroleum products that entered into the United States for consumption, use, or warehousing. The tax rate is the sum of the Hazardous Substance Superfund rate and the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund financing rate. For calendar years beginning in 2024, the Hazardous Substance Superfund financing rate is adjusted for inflation. For calendar year 2024 crude oil or petroleum products entered after Dec. 31, 2016, will have a tax rate of $0.26 cents a barrel. Highlights of changes in Revenue Procedure 2023-34: The tax year 2024 adjustments described below generally apply to income tax returns filed in 2025. The tax items for tax year 2024 of greatest interest to most taxpayers include the following dollar amounts: The other rates are: 35% for incomes over $243,725 ($487,450 for married couples filing jointly) 32% for incomes over $191,950 ($383,900 for married couples filing jointly) 24% for incomes over $100,525 ($201,050 for married couples filing jointly) 22% for incomes over $47,150 ($94,300 for married couples filing jointly) 12% for incomes over $11,600 ($23,200 for married couples filing jointly) The lowest rate is 10% for incomes of single individuals with incomes of $11,600 or less ($23,200 for married couples filing jointly). By statute, certain items that were indexed for inflation in the past are currently not adjusted.",

That’s because the federal government and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) don’t assess the same amount of tax for every dollar you earn. Instead, the IRS assigns your income to brackets with tax rates that increase as you earn more money. Following are the federal tax tables and how to make sense of them to potentially reduce your upcoming tax bill. Source: Internal Revenue Service Source: Internal Revenue Service The US has a progressive tax system at the federal level with 7 tax brackets. As you earn more money, the additional income jumps to a higher bracket with a higher tax rate. (Over a certain amount, your income is taxed no further.) The Internal Revenue Service adjusts federal income tax brackets annually to account for inflation, and the new brackets can help you estimate your tax obligation based on your income and filing status for the year. For example, a hypothetical single filer would owe 10% on the first $11,600 of taxable income in 2024 whether that amount represents their total earnings, or they earn $1 million. The next tax bracket is 12% of taxable income levels between $11,601 to $47,150. The tax rates continue to increase as someone’s income moves into higher brackets. The IRS uses different federal income tax brackets and ranges depending on filing status: Sign up for Fidelity Viewpoints weekly email for our latest insights. You can figure out what tax bracket you’re in using the tables published by the IRS (see tables above). To figure out your tax bracket, first look at the rates for the filing status you plan to use: single, married filing jointly, married filing separately, or head of household. Next, determine your taxable income. Start by adding up all the income you’ve earned for the year that will be taxed, such as from salary, bonuses, tips, freelance income, alimony (from an agreement finalized prior to 2019 that has not since been modified), and interest earnings. Subtract things like 401(k) contributions and HSA contributions (these are already factored into your W-2, if you will receive one). Then subtract the standard deduction, or deductions if you plan to itemize. The difference is your total taxable income, though other adjustments to income or deductions may apply. Note: The top tax rate your income falls into is not the actual rate you’ll pay. It’s the rate you’ll pay on the amount of income that falls into the last bracket. Find the appropriate boxes listing the income thresholds for your taxable income and filing status to determine how much of your income falls in each bracket. The federal marginal tax rate is the federal income tax rate owed on your highest dollar of income. For example, if your income falls into the 24% tax bracket, your federal marginal tax rate is 24%. You might owe 24 cents for every dollar you earn. If your income pushes you into a higher tax bracket, your marginal tax rate increases to that next percentage, and you’d owe a higher share of taxes on the additional income. Your federal effective tax rate is the total percentage of your income you pay in federal income tax, calculated by dividing what you owe in taxes by your total income. It essentially sums up how much you owe for each tax bracket into one percentage. For example, assume a hypothetical taxpayer who is married with $150,000 of joint income in 2024 is claiming the standard deduction of $29,200. Without considering other income, adjustments to income, or other deductions, their taxable income would be $120,800. They would owe the following in federal income taxes: They owe $16,682 of total taxes on $150,000 of income. Their effective tax rate is then $16,682/$150,000 = 11.1%. You can potentially get into a lower tax bracket by reducing your taxable income for the year. Here are some tactics to consider: Consult a tax advisor to help you pinpoint your exact tax bracket and, more importantly, the strategies you can use to reduce how much you owe.

                "content": "Little Big Town is an American country music vocal group from Homewood, Alabama. Founded in 1998, the group has had the same four members since its founding: Karen Fairchild, Kimberly Schlapman (née Roads), Phillip Sweet, and Jimi Westbrook. Fairchild and Westbrook have been married to each other since 2006. Little Big Town's musical style relies heavily on four-part vocal harmonies, with all four members alternating as lead vocalists. After a recording deal with the Mercury Nashville Records label which produced no singles or albums, Little Big Town released its self-titled debut on Monument Records in 2002. It produced two minor country chart singles before the group left the label. In 2005, the group signed to Equity Music Group, an independent record label owned by Clint Black. Their second album, The Road to Here, was released that year, and received a platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). A Place to Land, their third album, was released via Equity, then re-released via Capitol Nashville after Equity closed in 2008. Seven more albums followed for Capitol: The Reason Why (2010), Tornado (2012), Pain Killer (2014), The Breaker (2017), Nightfall (2020), Mr. Sun (2022) and The Christmas Record (2024), four of which have reached number one on the Top Country Albums chart. Their albums accounted for 24 singles on Hot Country Songs and Country Airplay, including the No. 1 singles \"Pontoon\", and \"Better Man\" along with the top 10 hits \"Boondocks\", \"Bring It On Home\", \"Little White Church\", \"Tornado\", \"Day Drinking\", and \"Girl Crush\". Fairchild and Schlapman met at Samford University in 1987, where they both sang in the school's vocal ensembles.[1] In the mid-1990s, Fairchild sang with the Christian vocal group Truth and was featured as a lead singer in a few of their songs. She formed a duo called KarenLeigh with Leigh Cappillino, a member of Truth who joined the group Point of Grace. KarenLeigh produced the singles, \"Save It for a Rainy Day\" and \"This Love Has\". Fairchild and Schlapman moved to Nashville, Tennessee, where they reunited and began singing together.[2] Westbrook joined Schlapman and Fairchild in 1998, followed by Sweet.[3] Little Big Town's first record deal was with Mercury Nashville Records. The band was dropped from the label's roster without releasing a single or album.[2][3] In 2001, they sang backing vocals on Collin Raye's album Can't Back Down, while Sweet and Roads co-wrote the song \"Back Where I Belong\" on Sherrié Austin's 2001 album Followin' a Feelin'.[4][5] In 2002, the band signed with Monument Records Nashville. The band released its first album, Little Big Town, in 2002. The album produced the singles \"Don't Waste My Time\" and \"Everything Changes\", which peaked at 33 and 42, respectively, on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart. Little Big Town was left without a label when Monument Records dissolved its Nashville branch. After Westbrook's father died, and Fairchild and Sweet got divorces, the band members got outside jobs while they continued to tour.[2] In 2005, Little Big Town was signed to Equity Music Group, a label started and partially owned by country music singer Clint Black.[2] Their third single, \"Boondocks\", was released in May, peaking at No. 9 on the country charts in January 2006. It served as the first of four singles from the group's second album, The Road to Here, which was released on October 4, 2005. \"Bring It On Home\", the second single from the album, became Little Big Town's first top 5 hit on Hot Country Songs. It was followed by \"Good as Gone\" and \"A Little More You\", both of which were top 20 hits. By the end of 2006, The Road to Here had been certified Platinum in the United States. Unlike their first album, the group's members co-wrote the majority of the songs on The Road to Here along with Wayne Kirkpatrick, who also produced it. In 2007, the group sang backing vocals on John Mellencamp's Freedom's Road album.[6] Little Big Town released A Place to Land, their third studio album and second with Equity, on November 6, 2007. Its lead-off single, \"I'm with the Band\", peaked at number 32 on the country chart. On April 23, 2008, Little Big Town announced it was leaving Equity for Capitol Nashville.[7] Shortly afterward, they charted with Sugarland and Jake Owen on a live cover of The Dream Academy's \"Life in a Northern Town\". Taken from Sugarland's 2007 tour, it reached number 28 on the country chart based on unsolicited airplay. In October 2008, Capitol re-released A Place to Land, which added four new songs, and the label promoted two further singles from the album, \"Fine Line\" and \"Good Lord Willing\". In the fall of 2008, Little Big Town opened up for Carrie Underwood on her Carnival Ride Tour. They began their first headlining tour in January 2009 in Jacksonville, Florida and continued through April.[8] Fairchild recorded a duet with Mellencamp on his 2008 album, Life, Death, Love and Freedom. The song, \"A Ride Back Home\", was released as the album's third single and was accompanied by a music video. Fairchild also duetted with Mellencamp on \"My Sweet Love\" and appears in its music video. Little Big Town was nominated for Vocal Group of the Year for the fourth year in a row at the 2009 CMA Awards. In March 2010, the group released a new single titled \"Little White Church\", as the lead-off single to their fourth studio album and first completely new album on Capitol Nashville, The Reason Why, which was released on August 24, 2010. \"Little White Church\" peaked at No. 6 on the country chart. The album produced two additional singles in \"Kiss Goodbye\" and the title track, but both failed to reach the top 40 of Hot Country Songs. The album's title track was released as a digital single on July 27, 2010, to begin an iTunes countdown to the album release on August 24, 2010. Three further digital singles – \"Kiss Goodbye\", \"Why, Oh Why\", and \"All the Way Down\" – were released weekly leading up until the album release. Also, in promotion of The Reason Why, Little Big Town went on tour as an opening act for Sugarland on The Incredible Machine Tour, as well their own The Reason Why Tour. Little Big Town's fifth studio album, Tornado, was released on September 11, 2012. It was also their first album to be produced by Jay Joyce. \"Pontoon\" was released as the album's lead single on April 30, 2012, and became their first number one hit on Hot Country Songs in September 2012. It was their first single to receive a Platinum certification. The title track was released as the album's second single on October 1, 2012. It reached No. 2 on the Country Airplay chart in 2013. At the 55th Grammy Awards, \"Pontoon\" won the Grammy Award for Best Country Duo/Group Performance.[9] The album was certified gold by the RIAA in December 2012.[10] The band joined Rascal Flatts on their Changed Tour, along with Eli Young Band and Edens Edge, for dates spanning Summer 2012. They played at the C2C: Country to Country festival in London on March 16, 2013.[11] The album's third single, \"Your Side of the Bed\", was a No. 27 hit. The band sang background vocals on Ashley Monroe's 2013 single, \"You Got Me\", featured on her 2013 release, Like a Rose. Fairchild co-wrote the song with Monroe.[12] The album's fourth single, \"Sober\", was a No. 31 hit. Little Big Town performed harmony vocals on David Nail's 2014 album, I'm a Fire, on the song \"When They're Gone (Lyle County)\", co-written by Brett Eldredge. They were featured on Miranda Lambert's 2014 album, Platinum, on \"Smokin' and Drinkin'\", a song which the band had considered recording.[13] It debuted on Billboard's Country Airplay chart at No. 38 after their performance at the CMA Awards in 2014 and was released as a single in 2015. The band began recording their sixth studio album, Pain Killer, in early 2014. The lead single, \"Day Drinking\", was released digitally June 3, and was sent to country radio on June 9.[14][15] It debuted on the Country Airplay chart at No. 32, their highest-ever debut at the time, and went on to peak at No. 2 on Country Airplay. It hit No. 1 on the Canada Country chart, becoming their second No. 1 single and first as songwriters. Pain Killer's track listing was announced on July 14, and the album was released on October 21.[16] On October 3, 2014, Reba McEntire invited the group to join the Grand Ole Opry. They accepted and were inducted by Vince Gill on October 17.[17] The second single from the album, \"Girl Crush\", was released December 15, 2014. Some radio stations were reported to have pulled \"Girl Crush\" from their playlists, in response to concerns from listeners who interpreted the song's lyrics to be about lesbianism. The label created a commercial in which the band discussed the song and its meaning.[18] Billboard consulted radio program directors on its panel and found one who detailed a specific complaint from a listener.[19] The song became Little Big Town's second No. 1 on a Billboard chart in May 2015 and their highest showing on the Billboard Hot 100 after gaining exposure on \"The Voice\" and the 50th Annual ACM Awards. The album's third single and the title track, \"Pain Killer\", released to country radio on August 24, 2015. On September 9, 2015, the group was nominated for five CMA Awards: Vocal Group of the Year, Album of the Year for Pain Killer, Single of the Year for \"Girl Crush\", Music Video of the Year for \"Girl Crush\" and Musical Event of the Year for their collaboration on the Miranda Lambert single \"Smokin' and Drinkin'\". They tied Eric Church for most nominations that year. The songwriters of \"Girl Crush\" were recognized with a Song of the Year win. For the 58th Annual Grammy Awards Pain Killer was nominated for Best Country Album, \"Girl Crush\" was nominated for Best Country Duo/Group Performance, Song of the Year and Best Country Song. Little Big Town received nominations for Best Country Album and Best Country Duo/Group Performance.[20] On January 24, 2016, the band sang the National Anthem before the Arizona/Carolina NFC Championship game. On July 4 of that year, they performed with the Boston Pops at their annual Independence Day concert. In February 2016, they appeared on \"Take Me Down\", a track on Down to My Last Bad Habit, the fourteenth album by Vince Gill. In March 2016, Little Big Town returned to the UK as part of the C2C: Country to Country tour, becoming one of four acts at the time (the others being Brantley Gilbert, Sam Hunt and Carrie Underwood) to perform at the festival twice. They headlined the launch party in 2015 where they announced the full line-up, revealing they would be supporting Underwood along with Hunt and Maddie & Tae. On May 24, 2016, the band announced their seventh studio album titled Wanderlust. The album contains eight tracks produced by Pharrell Williams and was released on June 10, 2016. Fairchild describes the album as, \"It's not a country album and it's not like anything we've ever done. It's fun to be spontaneous and put it out there to the fans, because we want to, and not to overthink it, but just because it has brought us a lot of joy, and we think it will for them as well. So why not? We're going with our gut and putting it out there. It's just music, you know?\" Fairchild stated that they are also working on a country record with Jay Joyce.[21] In July, they appeared on the 2000–2005 episode of ABC's Greatest Hits where they performed covers by Alicia Keys, Oasis and Sheryl Crow. They were also selected as one of 30 artists to perform on \"Forever Country\", a mash-up track of \"Take Me Home, Country Roads\", \"On the Road Again\" and \"I Will Always Love You\", which celebrates 50 years of the CMA Awards.[22] The band released \"Better Man\", which was written by singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, on October 20, 2016, as the lead single to their upcoming seventh studio album, The Breaker, that was released on February 24, 2017. Initially masking the song's writer, the band revealed that Swift wrote the song. The song's music video, directed by Reid Long and Becky Fluke, was released November 1, 2016. The band would follow up with singles \"Happy People\", their worst-charting single to date, and \"When Someone Stops Loving You\", a minor top 40 hit. The band announced they would be the first act in history to have a residency at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville. Little Big Town announced a six-date UK tour supported by Seth Ennis beginning on September 28 and concluding in London on October 5[23] before revealing that Kacey Musgraves and Midland would support them on the American leg of The Breakers Tour beginning in February 2018.[24] On October 5 during their show at the Royal Albert Hall, the band revealed that they would be headlining the 2018 C2C: Country to Country festival, making history as the first act to play the event three times.[25] \"Summer Fever\" was released as a stand-alone single on June 6, 2018. It debuted (and peaked) at number 29 on Country Airplay, becoming the band's highest debut to date. The song also peaked within the top 40 of Hot Country Songs and Canada Country charts. The group then released \"The Daughters\" on April 5, 2019 as the first single from their ninth album Nightfall, which the band produced themselves. It was released on January 17, 2020.[26][27] \"The Daughters\" debuted at number 29 on Hot Country Songs but was not promoted to radio and thus failed to chart on Country Airplay. On September 8, 2019, Little Big Town released \"Over Drinking\", the second single from Nightfall. The band embarked on a 30-date theatre tour of the same name with supporting act Caitlyn Smith, beginning with a show at New York City's Carnegie Hall the day before the album release.[26] On April 11, 2022, the band released the song \"Hell Yeah\".[28] On July 19, the band announced their tenth studio album, Mr. Sun, which was released on September 16.[29] In 2023, the group toured lightly, headlining the 10-date Friends of Mine tour, and opening for George Strait on his 2023 tour. In March 2024, the group announced the UK leg of the Friends of Mine tour. Also in March, the group announced on social media that they would be collaborating with \"lifelong friends\" Sugarland at the 2024 CMT Music Awards. They performed Phil Collins' \"Take Me Home\", which was released as single the same day. The two groups will be co-headlining the Take Me Home Tour from October 24 to December 13, 2024.[30] They announced on CMT Hot 20 Countdown on March 30, that they were in the process of recording a Christmas album, with an expected 2024 release. The Christmas Record was released on October 4, 2024.[31] Schlapman was married to Steven Roads, the band's lawyer, who died from a heart attack in 2005. On November 28, 2006, Roads married Stephen Schlapman, and gave birth to a daughter in July 2007.[32][33] The couple adopted a daughter on December 31, 2016.[34] Sweet married Rebecca Arthur on March 30, 2007. They welcomed a daughter in December 2007.[35] Fairchild and Westbrook married on May 31, 2006. They have a son who was born in 2010.[36] Little Big Town's musical stylings are defined by four-part vocal harmonies. Unlike most vocal groups, Little Big Town does not feature a definitive lead vocalist.[3] Instead, their songs are either led by any one of the four members, or by all four in varying combinations (such as on \"Boondocks\" and \"Life in a Northern Town\"). ^ A. with Sugarland and Jake Owen ^ B. with Andra Day, Common, Lee Ann Womack and Danielle Bradbery ^ C. with Jason Aldean, Keith Urban and Chris Stapleton ^ D. with Gladys Knight Note: \"Girl Crush\" was also nominated for Song of the Year and Best Country Song in 2016 (winning the latter), but in this category the award goes to the composer(s) of the song, not to the performing artist(s).

                "content": "Desmond Kelly Ridder (born August 31, 1999) is an American professional football quarterback for the Las Vegas Raiders of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at Cincinnati, where he was twice-named AAC Offensive Player of the Year before being selected by the Atlanta Falcons in the third round of the 2022 NFL draft. Ridder has also been a member of the Arizona Cardinals. Ridder was born in Louisville, Kentucky, to a 15-year-old mother and was raised by his mother and grandmother. He attended Holy Family Parochial before attending St. Xavier High School.[1] As a senior at St. Xavier, Ridder passed for 1,319 yards and nine touchdowns and also led the Tigers in rushing with 668 yards and 12 touchdowns and was named All-Metro.[2] He was rated as a two-star recruit by Rivals.com and a three-star recruit by 24/7 Sports and committed to play college football at the University of Cincinnati over an offer from Eastern Kentucky.[1] He received his scholarship offer from Cincinnati head coach Tommy Tuberville following a tryout held on the morning of the Kentucky Oaks for offensive coordinator Zac Taylor during his junior year. After Tuberville resigned during his senior year, new coach Luke Fickell honored the offer and Ridder signed his National Letter of Intent.[1] Ridder redshirted his true freshman season in 2017.[3] He became the Bearcats' starting quarterback as a redshirt freshman in 2018 and passed for 2,445 yards and 20 touchdowns and gained 583 yards rushing along with five touchdowns and was named the American Athletic Conference (AAC) Rookie of the Year.[4][5] As a redshirt sophomore in 2019, Ridder completed 179 of 325 passes for 2,164 yards and 18 touchdowns against nine interceptions while also rushing for 650 yards and five touchdowns.[6][7] He was named the MVP of the 2020 Birmingham Bowl completing 14-of-24 passes for 95 yards and one touchdown, while also rushing for 105 yards and three touchdowns in a 38–6 victory over Boston College.[8] The 2020 season proved to be a breakout campaign for the junior quarterback. Ridder was named the Walter Camp Offensive Player of the Week and the Davey O'Brien National Quarterback of the Week after completing 13-of-21 passes for 126 yards and a touchdown and also rushing eight times for 179 yards and three touchdowns in a 42–13 win over 16th-ranked SMU on October 24, 2020.[9][10][11][12] At the conclusion of the regular season, Ridder was named the AAC Offensive Player of the Year after passing 2,296 yards, and 19 touchdowns with six interceptions, while also rushing for 592 yards and 12 touchdowns, in only nine games due to the COVID-19-shortened season.[13] Ridder considered declaring for the 2021 NFL draft, but opted to return for his redshirt senior season.[14] In 2021, for the second time in his career, Ridder was named the Davey O'Brien National Quarterback of the Week after the No. 7 Bearcats defeated No. 9 Notre Dame on the road. Ridder went 19-of-32 for 297 yards and two TDs. In addition, he rushed for 26 yards and a game-sealing fourth-quarter touchdown as the Bearcats snapped the Fighting Irish's 26-game home winning streak.[15] Following an unbeaten 12–0 season, Ridder and the Bearcats went into the 2021 American Athletic Conference Football Championship Game ranked number four in the AP Polls, meaning a victory would see them stay in a playoff spot. Following a 35–20 win over the Houston Cougars, they became the first Group of Five team to make the playoffs, as well as the last major undefeated team going into the postseason. Ridder and Cincinnati would fall 27–6 to the Alabama Crimson Tide in the college football playoff semi-finals, finishing his final year in college with 30 passing touchdowns, six rushing touchdowns, and just eight interceptions, in what was the best season in the program's history. After wrapping up his collegiate career at Cincinnati, Ridder was invited to the NFL Scouting Combine, where he measured in at 6'3\" and 211 lbs., with a 32.75-inch arm span and a 10-inch hand span. With a 4.52-second 40-yard dash, Ridder posted one of the fastest times recorded by a quarterback. At the end of the pre-draft process, most experts had projected Ridder as a first-round to third-round pick. He was rated as the fourth-best quarterback prospect in the 2022 NFL draft class, after Malik Willis, Kenny Pickett, and Matt Corral.[citation needed] Ridder was drafted in the third round (74th overall) of the 2022 NFL Draft by the Atlanta Falcons.[19] Ridder was considered a surprise fall in the draft, as many analysts had projected him to be drafted in the first round as high as the eighth overall pick. He was just the second quarterback to be selected in the draft, after Kenny Pickett was selected in the first round by the Pittsburgh Steelers.[20] In his first training camp in the NFL, Ridder competed for the starting quarterback job against veteran Marcus Mariota. On July 28, 2022, head coach Arthur Smith named Mariota as the starting quarterback to open the season, with Ridder serving as the backup. On December 8, 2022, the Falcons benched Mariota and named Ridder as the starting quarterback for the rest of the season.[21] Ridder made his NFL debut in Week 15 against the New Orleans Saints, where he was 13-of-26 for 97 yards, zero touchdowns, zero interceptions, and 38 rushing yards in the 18–21 loss.[22] In Week 17 against the Arizona Cardinals, Ridder was 19-of-26 for 169 yards in the 20–19 victory, his first career NFL win.[23] In Week 18 against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Ridder was 19-for-30 for 224 yards and two touchdowns in the 30–17 win.[24] Ridder finished his rookie season with 708 passing yards, two touchdowns, zero interceptions, an 86.4 passer rating, and 64 rushing yards.[25] In March 2023, Falcons head coach Arthur Smith announced that Ridder would remain the starting quarterback at the start of the 2023 season.[26] In Week 8, Ridder was benched at the start of the second half game against the Tennessee Titans, being replaced by Taylor Heinicke.[27] In Week 9, on November 1, head coach Arthur Smith downgraded him on the depth chart after naming Heinicke as the Falcons' new starting quarterback for the game against the Minnesota Vikings.[28] In Week 12, Ridder was renamed as the starter after Heinicke went 0–2.[29] He finished the 2023 season with 2,836 passing yards, 12 passing touchdowns, and 12 interceptions to go with 53 carries for 193 rushing yards and five rushing touchdowns.[30] After the Falcons signed Kirk Cousins, Ridder was traded to the Arizona Cardinals on March 14, 2024, in exchange for wide receiver Rondale Moore.[31] On August 27, 2024, Ridder lost the battle for backup quarterback against Clayton Tune and was released by the Cardinals, then re-signed to their practice squad the next day.[32][33] After Las Vegas Raiders' quarterback Aidan O'Connell was placed on injured reserve, Ridder was signed off the Arizona Cardinals practice squad on October 21, 2024.[34] In Week 12 against the Denver Broncos, Ridder came in at quarterback for the Raiders after a collarbone injury to Gardner Minshew.[35] Ridder married his high school sweetheart, Claire Cornett, on July 15, 2022. The couple have one daughter, Leighton, and a son, Khylan.",

                "title": "Falcons prepared for possibility of facing Desmond Ridder",
                "content": "Falcons Digital Team Reporter FLOWERY BRANCH, Ga. — There's a good chance the Atlanta Falcons will play against a familiar face Monday night at Allegiant Stadium. Las Vegas Raiders starting quarterback Aiden O'Connell is questionable for the Week 15 matchup after not participating in any of the team's practices during the lead-up to Monday's game because of a knee injury. So, there's a good chance backup Desmond Ridder will get the start against his former team. \"I told him, if I see him before the game, I may have to punch him in the arm or something like that so he can't do nothing against us,\" Falcons wide receiver Drake London said. \"But no, I'm just happy for him.\" London and Ridder were both members of the Falcons' 2022 draft class. Ridder was a third-round pick — No. 74 overall — from the University of Cincinnati, while London was Atlanta's first-round pick at No. 8 overall out of the University of Southern California. Ridder spent the majority of his rookie season behind former Falcons quarterback Marcus Mariota. He ultimately took over the starting role for Atlanta's final four games, going 2-2, and then maintained the position in 2023. Last season, however, didn't go as planned for Ridder. He started 13 of the 15 games in which he played and went 6-7 as the starter. The starting job switched between Ridder and Taylor Heinicke more than once throughout the course of the franchise's third consecutive 7-10 season. After the departure of former head coach Arthur Smith and arrival of current head coach Raheem Morris, the Falcons completely revamped their quarterback room. They signed veteran Kirk Cousins to a four-year, $180 million contract and drafted rookie Michael Penix Jr. at No. 8 overall. They then traded Ridder to the Arizona Cardinals and Heinicke to the Los Angeles Chargers. Ridder ended up on the Cardinals' practice squad before the season started and stayed there until the Raiders signed him to their active roster in Week 8. \"That's the brutality of this league,\" London said. \"You could go from being so high to so low so quick. But the fact that he's been fighting his way back and he's on a team right now — I mean, he's starting on Monday Night Football — I know he's ecstatic about it and definitely happy where his role is right now. I know he wants more. He wants something that's solidified for sure.\" The Raiders signed Ridder because O'Connell had a previous stint on injured reserve from Weeks 8-12. Gardner Minshew II became the starter, Ridder his backup. Minshew was then placed on injured reserve in Week 13, leaving the Raiders with their current situation. Atlanta has prepared for either scenario it may face at quarterback, with coaches and players like closely studying the influence interim offensive coordinator Scott Turner has had on the Raiders since he assumed the role during the team's bye in Week 10. If Ridder gets the nod, though, the Falcons know what he's capable of. \"He'll be prepared in the right way. He'll be ready for us,\" Morris said. \"A familiar opponent, some people he knows, and I know we've got to get ready for him as well. He can run the football, he's talented, he's athletic, he's big, he throws football, did a lot of good things.\" Ridder has played in four games for the Raiders, completing 28 of his 44 passes for 239 yards and a touchdown. \"I think he's making the most out of every opportunity that he's been having,\" said Falcons running back Tyler Allgeier, another 2022 draft pick. \"I think it's just an awesome opportunity for him to show what he can do.\" The main takeaways, moments and more that determined the outcome of Monday's game between Falcons and Raiders. The second-year running back hit the mark in the first quarter of the Falcons Monday night game against the Raiders. Kickoff is scheduled for 8:30 p.m. ET at Allegiant Stadium. Atlanta also activated rookie Ruke Orhorhoro from injured reserve ahead of Monday night's matchup in Las Vegas. Quarterbacks have avoided testing Terrell for much of the year, which is the ultimate sign of respect for an NFL cornerback. Bijan Robinson is doing big things in his second NFL season. Kickoff is scheduled for 8:30 p.m. ET at Allegiant Stadium. Rookie defensive tackle Ruke Orhorhoro is questionable for Monday's game against the Las Vegas Raiders The key to Monday night's game and to the Falcons' success down the stretch is simple: Finish drives with touchdowns, specifically in the red zone. The Falcons have the Raiders, Giants, Commanders and Panthers left on their 2024 regular-season schedule. © Atlanta Falcons Football Club - 2023",

                "content": "News: 2 hours agoRidder completed 23 of 39 pass attempts for 208 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions while rushing five times for 28 yards in Monday's 15-9 loss to the Falcons. Spin: Ridder got a spot-start in place of injured starter Aidan O'Connell (knee) on Monday, squaring off against the team that drafted the backup in the third round of the 2022 NFL Draft. The 24-year-old Ridder was inconsistent in his first start for Las Vegas, committing a pair of turnovers before cashing in a late garbage-time touchdown in the loss. O'Connell's injury isn't considered serious, so there is a good chance Ridder returns to the bench for Sunday's tilt against Jacksonville. ESPN Fantasy Projection: Ridder drew comparisons to Marcus Mariota throughout the draft process in 2022. Therefore, it didn't seem entirely odd when he replaced the vet as the Falcons' QB1 in 2023. What was head-scratching, however, was Ridder's rigidity in the pocket. This contributed to a limited number of passing attempts (25.9 per game) and underwhelming aerial stats (2,836 pass yards). The bulk of Ridder's fantasy production came via his legs, as he recorded 53 carries, though those opportunities proved inefficient, as the former Bearcat managed just 193 rushing yards over 15 games. Ridder will start fresh in Arizona behind Kyler Murray. Given Murray's injury history, it's possible Ridder finds his way onto the field at some point in 2024, but he won't be a fantasy option.",

The second season of HBO’s The White Lotus ended on as shocking a note as any whodunnit could. And yet, we still didn’t see it coming. Tanya (Jennifer Coolidge) takes a tragic slip off the side of a yacht and falls to her death. Her corpse is discovered in the Ionian Sea the next day by Daphne (Meghann Fahy), along with the bodies of the captors she murdered in order to escape. Hey, at least Tanya went out guns blazing. Although, she really should’ve taken her heels off first. Related Stories This $23.3 Million Contemporary L.A. Home Is Concealed in a Forest-Like Setting How Notre Dame’s Reopening Became the Ultimate LVMH Flex London Will Soon Be Home to the Joint-Tallest Skyscrapers in Western Europe Just like the first season, White Lotus creator and showrunner Mike White had audiences engrossed in epic landscapes (Hawaii then Sicily), and also entangled in the complex web of characters he created. Who knew that by the end of this installation we’d all be rooting for a pair of scheming escorts? As it turns out, troubled and ultra-rich vacationers are his specialty, and audiences want nothing more than to see these elites get played. And boy did they. Now that fans are done theorizing about the finale, there’s only one question that remains: Where in the world will White take us next? Speculation around season three of White Lotus has already started. Fans are dissecting every morsel of information that the writer and director has given thus far. When will it come out? Who will be in the cast? What will it be about? Here, we break down everything you need to know about the upcoming season. HBO officially renewed The White Lotus for a third season back in November 2022. You can expect a change of scenery and a group of new characters. In addition, White teased that he’ll be taking the installment to a new level in season three—which is great for us viewers. “It’s going to be a supersized White Lotus,” White revealed to Entertainment Weekly. “It’s going to be longer, bigger, crazier. I don’t know what people will think, but I am super excited, so at least for my own barometer, that’s a good thing. . .I’m super excited about the content of the season.” As of now, it’s unclear whether White means that the series will have extra episodes, longer run times, or both. However, Michelle Monaghan, one of the newcomers cast this season, confirmed that a larger ensemble has been assembled. “I mean, it is big. We do so much,” the actress told Collider. “The scope of season 3 is bigger than season 1 and season 2, the cast is bigger as a result. It’s really special.” “Next year, the Maldives!” Daphne may have been joking when she suggested visiting the South Asian archipelago for another contentious couple’s retreat, but she might not have been far off. White told Robb Report’s sister site Deadline that Asia isn’t off the table for season three after season one took place in Hawaii and season two was based in Italy. “I think it’d be fun to maybe go to a whole different continent. You know, we did Europe, and maybe Asia, something crazy like that, that would be fun.” Executive producer David Bernad confirmed our suspicions during a keynote event at the Berlinale Series Market in Germany saying, “We’ve tried to work in Asia a lot and hopefully season three will be our chance to make something happen there.” Of course, Asia is a very big place, leaving plenty of room for speculation. HBO has teamed up with the Tourism Authority of Thailand for the next installment and recently confirmed that season three will be shot in Bangkok, Phuket, and Ko Samui starting in February 2024. More specifically, the hit show will film for three months at the Four Seasons Resort Koh Samui and spend several weeks at Anantara Mai Khao Phuket Villas in April and May, Bloomberg reported. In addition, scenes will be shot away from the beach at the Mandarin Oriental Bangkok. Speaking with IndieWire, The Leftovers‘ Carrie Coon, who will join the installment alongside Monaghan, revealed that torrential downpours in the area posed a problem when it came to shooting. “It was very, very challenging,” Coon said. “It created a lot of obstacles because we had to keep moving around every time there was bad weather. I think we moved around nine times, so the logistics were tough because who wants to see rainy, cold Thailand?” While Tokyo was the rumored locale for a while, it was confirmed by Deadline that the reason White settled on Thailand for season three was ultimately due to tax incentives. At the Tokyo Film Festival, Japanese producer Georgia Pope spoke about a location scouting trip that she went on with a “high profile showrunner” and his producers and studio executives. “It was a great scout,” Pope recalled in her MPA keynote address. “We saw some absolutely stunning locations all over Honshu. The showrunner loved it all, and I was feeling very confident that I had it all in the bag.” Things ultimately took a turn when a Thai production company informed the White Lotus crew of a 30 percent rebate. “For their project, that meant $4.4 million alone. . .At the time in Japan, we had no incentive in place at all. . .All I could hear was the sound of a $35 million project flying out the window,” Pope said. White Lotus season three will premiere on February 16, 2025. HBO Chief Casey Bloys told Deadline in September that season three (and The Last of Us season two) would be released in “the first half of the year.” Warner Bros. Discovery global streaming chief JB Perrette narrowed things down a bit, announcing in December that The White Lotus season three will debut in February 2025, ensuring it’s eligible for award season. The third season was reportedly in the early stages of production before the writers’ strike brought everything in Hollywood to a halt. White revealed to EW that he planned to start shooting the new season “at the beginning of the year” but admitted that the simultaneous SAG-AFTRA strike also hindered the development of the show’s next chapter. “I’m seriously finishing scripts,” he said. “Still waiting to be able to cast. If the SAG strike isn’t resolved soon, then yeah, we’d have to push again because the show has a new cast every season, so there’s lots of parts to cast. . .I’m more than eager to get going.” The third installment will welcome back White Lotus vet Natasha Rothwell. Viewers will remember her as season one spa manager, Belinda Lindsey, who was scammed by Tanya. Also checking in for season three, in addition to Monaghan and Coon, will be Leslie Bibb, Parker Posey, Jason Isaacs, Dom Hetrakul, and Tayme Thapthimthong, Variety confirmed. HBO announced even more newcomers to the star-studded ensemble, including Walton Goggins (The Righteous Gemstones), Patrick Schwarzenegger (Gen V), and Sex Education actress Aimee Lou Wood. Sarah Catherine Hook, Sam Nivola, Nicholas Duvernay, Arnas Fedaravičius, and Blackpink’s Lisa Manobal are also on board for The White Lotus season three. Christian Friedel will also reportedly join the cast along with Morgana O’Reilly, Lek Patravadi, and Shalini Peiris. It was previously reported that Miloš Biković and Francesca Corney would also be part of the upcoming installment; however, their roles have since been recast. Corney will now be replaced by actress-director Charlotte Le Bon and Biković, who was let go by the network over his links to Russia, will be swapped for Julian Kostov. In an interview with Vanity Fair, Rothwell opened up about her working relationship with White and what initially went into creating her character. “Mike is so collaborative. When we did the first season, we sat down and talked a lot about Belinda and he was so receptive to feedback. So we plan to approach it the same way,” she said. “But all credit to him, what I love working with him is that he understands that Belinda’s POV is something that he doesn’t possess—so he’s really interested in my feedback, and really wants to make it authentic.” The writer-actor recently spoke out for the first time about her role reprisal at the Los Angeles premiere of Wonka and teased fans about the upcoming season. “I’ve read all the scripts and I can’t say anything, but I will say it’s going to blow people’s minds,” she told The Hollywood Reporter. “I gasped out loud no less than five times and that was just reading them, so people are in for a treat.” As for what other White Lotus guests could appear in season three, White reportedly told season one star Connie Britton that her character, Nicole, could return to the show. “He wanted me to be in the second season, and there was an idea that I loved for the character,” Britton told Deadline. “Our intention is to do it in the third season. A piece of casting didn’t work in the second season and we’re hoping to [do] that in the third season. I would love to see a spinoff on every character in that show.” Don’t get too excited, though. A spokesperson for Britton later revealed to TVLine that “she is not participating in the upcoming season.” If you recall, Coolidge and Greis’s characters were the only links between seasons one and two, so we wouldn’t be all that surprised if they reappeared in the third iteration as well. In Coolidge’s Emmy acceptance speech for Best Supporting Actress, she thanked White for reviving her career and told the audience that Tanya “is definitely dead” and that she’s “going along with it.” However, if White does opt to continue the storyline, Coolidge has some choice words for the fate of her on-screen husband.“ My hope for Jon is that he’s not finished with Greg,” Coolidge told The Bear star Jeremy Allen White during Variety’s “Actors on Actors” series. “I hope there’s some comeuppance for evil Greg. I think he should, I don’t know, end up in a meat-grinding machine.” As for what’s in store for season three, we’re short on specifics. Even Bloys admitted to Deadline that he hasn’t seen any footage yet, however, he’s “seen dailies and read scripts” so he’s got “high hopes” for season three. What we do know is that new arrivals will include a multigenerational gang with a patriarch, a female corporate executive, an actress, a couple of mothers, a country club wife, a misfit, and a yogi. Thankfully, White did offer up some details on the potential theme in an exclusive clip for HBO. “The first season kind of highlighted money, and then, the second season is sex. And I think the third season it would be maybe a kind of satirical and funny look at death and Eastern religion and spirituality. And it feels like it could be a rich tapestry to do another round at White Lotus.” White also hinted that parts of season two could carry over into the third. Namely, the murder-for-hire plot involving Greg (Jon Gries), Tanya’s husband, and Portia (Haley Lu Richardson), her assistant, who was only starting to put the pieces together. “I think as far as like, what happens to Greg and the conspiracy of Tanya’s death, it’s possible that I think Portia is scared enough to just leave it alone, but the fact that all of those guys die on the boat, it feels like there’s gotta be somebody who’s gonna track it back down to Greg. But maybe you’ll have to wait to find out what happens.” “Karma comes for everyone,” said Max when dropping the official teaser for the third season. The new footage offers a glimpse into the show’s next chapter, including Belinda’s return as part of an exchange program in Thailand. The trailer introduces Manobal as an employee at The White Lotus and Coon, Bibb, and Monaghan as three long-time friends on a girls trip. The clip also flashes to an uptight Goggins who’s traveling with his much younger girlfriend, played by Wood. “Everyone runs from pain towards pleasure, but they get there only to find more pain,” a voice-over remarks amid a montage of meditation and partying. Meanwhile, Posey’s character Victoria is heard saying that someone “stole her lorazepam” and that she’s going to have to “drink herself to sleep.” Later she admits that “something is off,” followed by disturbing images of what looks like an armed robbery and a body being wheeled out on a gurney. You can watch the full trailer below: The White Lotus could return for future seasons as long as White is onboard. Bloys and JB Perrette, president of global streaming and games for Warner Bros. Discovery, sat down with Variety in June to address the show’s trajectory and whether the network has plans to keep the story going after season three. “I know Mike has a lot of ideas for where it could go,” Bloys said. “We’re lucky to be in business with him. And we have actors who now really, really want to be on the show because it’s a great opportunity and it’s great writing. So I think as long as he wants to do it, we’ll go along for the ride. He’s really built a very interesting model to go from different parts of the world and have a rotating cast.” That said, The White Lotus has not been renewed for a fourth season—yet.

                "title": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C. - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Tottenham Hotspur Football Club, commonly referred to as simply Tottenham (/ˈtɒtənəm/,[2][3] TOT-ən-əm, /tɒtnəm/, tot-nəm) or Spurs, is a professional football club based in Tottenham, north London, England. It competes in the Premier League, the top tier of English football. The team has played its home matches in the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium since 2019, replacing their former home of White Hart Lane, which had been demolished to make way for the new stadium on the same site. Founded in 1882, Tottenham Hotspur's emblem is a cockerel standing upon a football, with the Latin motto Audere est Facere (\"to dare is to do\"). The club has traditionally worn white shirts and navy blue shorts as their home kit since the 1898–99 season. Their training ground is on Hotspur Way in Bulls Cross, Enfield. After its inception, Tottenham won the FA Cup for the first time in 1901, the only non-League club to do so since the formation of the Football League in 1888. Tottenham were the first club in the 20th century to achieve the League and FA Cup Double, winning both competitions in the 1960–61 season. After successfully defending the FA Cup in 1962, in 1963 they became the first British club to win a UEFA club competition – the European Cup Winners' Cup.[4] They were also the inaugural winners of the UEFA Cup in 1972, becoming the first British club to win two different major European trophies. They collected at least one major trophy in each of the six decades from the 1950s to 2000s, an achievement only matched by Manchester United.[5][6] In domestic football, Spurs have won two league titles, eight FA Cups, four League Cups, and seven FA Community Shields. In European football, they have won one European Cup Winners' Cup and two UEFA Cups. Tottenham were also runners-up in the 2018–19 UEFA Champions League. They have a long-standing rivalry with nearby club Arsenal, with whom they contest the North London derby. Tottenham is owned by ENIC Group, which purchased the club in 2001. The club was estimated to be worth £2.6 billion ($3.2 billion) in 2024, and it was the eighth-highest-earning football club in the world, with an annual revenue of £549.2 million in 2023.[7][8] Originally named Hotspur Football Club, the club was formed on 5 September 1882 by a group of schoolboys led by Bobby Buckle. They were members of the Hotspur Cricket Club and the football club was formed to play sports during the winter months.[9] A year later the boys sought help with the club from John Ripsher, the Bible class teacher at All Hallows Church, who became the first president of the club and its treasurer. Ripsher helped and supported the boys through the club's formative years, reorganised and found premises for the club.[10][11][12] In April 1884 the club was renamed \"Tottenham Hotspur Football Club\" to avoid confusion with another London club named Hotspur, whose post had been mistakenly delivered to North London.[13][14] Nicknames for the club include \"Spurs\" and \"the Lilywhites\".[15] Initially, the north London side played games between themselves and friendly matches against other local clubs. The first recorded match took place on 30 September 1882 against a local team named the Radicals, which Hotspur lost 2–0.[16] The team entered their first cup competition in the London Association Cup, and won 5–2 in their first competitive match on 17 October 1885 against a company's works team called St Albans.[17] The club's fixtures began to attract the interest of the local community and attendances at its home matches increased. In 1892, they played for the first time in a league, the short-lived Southern Alliance.[18] The club turned professional on 20 December 1895 and, in the summer of 1896, was admitted to Division One of the Southern League (the third tier at the time). On 2 March 1898, the club also became a limited company, the Tottenham Hotspur Football and Athletic Company.[18] Soon after, Frank Brettell became the first ever manager of Spurs, and he signed John Cameron, who took over as player-manager when Brettell left a year later. Cameron would have a significant impact on Spurs, helping the club win its first trophy, the Southern League title in the 1899–1900 season.[19] The following year Spurs won the 1901 FA Cup by beating Sheffield United 3–1 in a replay of the final, after the first game ended in a 2–2 draw. In doing so they became the only non-League club to achieve the feat since the formation of The Football League in 1888.[20] In 1908, the club was elected into the Football League Second Division and won promotion to the First Division in their first season, finishing runners-up. In 1912, Peter McWilliam became manager; Tottenham finished bottom of the league at the end of the 1914–15 season when football was suspended due to the First World War. Spurs were relegated to the Second Division on the resumption of league football after the war, but quickly returned to the First Division as Second Division champions of the 1919–20 season.[21] On 23 April 1921, McWilliam guided Spurs to their second FA Cup win, beating Wolverhampton Wanderers 1–0 in the Cup Final. Spurs finished second to Liverpool in the league in 1922, but would finish mid-table in the next five seasons. Spurs were relegated in the 1927–28 season after McWilliam left. For most of the 1930s and 40s, Spurs languished in the Second Division, apart from a brief return to the top flight in the 1933–34 and 1934–35 seasons.[22] Former Spurs player Arthur Rowe became manager in 1949. Rowe developed a style of play, known as \"push and run\", that proved to be successful in his early years as manager. He took the team back to the First Division after finishing top of the Second Division in the 1949–50 season.[23] In his second season in charge, Tottenham won their first ever top-tier league championship title when they finished top of the First Division for the 1950–51 season.[24][25] Rowe resigned in April 1955 due to a stress-induced illness from managing the club.[26][27] Before he left, he signed one of Spurs' most celebrated players, Danny Blanchflower, who won the FWA Footballer of the Year twice while at Tottenham.[28] Bill Nicholson took over as manager in October 1958. He became the club's most successful manager, guiding the team to major trophy success three seasons in a row in the early 1960s: the Double in 1961, the FA Cup in 1962 and the Cup Winners' Cup in 1963.[29] Nicholson signed Dave Mackay and John White in 1959, two influential players of the Double-winning team, and Jimmy Greaves in 1961, the most prolific goal-scorer in the history of the top tier of English football.[30][31] The 1960–61 season started with a run of 11 wins, followed by a draw and another four wins, at that time the best ever start by any club in the top flight of English football.[32] The title was won on 17 April 1961 when they beat the eventual runner-up Sheffield Wednesday at home 2–1, with three more games still to play.[33] The Double was achieved when Spurs won 2–0 against Leicester City in the final of the 1960–61 FA Cup. It was the first Double of the 20th century, and the first since Aston Villa achieved the feat in 1897.[34] The next year Spurs won their consecutive FA Cup after beating Burnley in the 1962 FA Cup Final.[35] On 15 May 1963, Tottenham became the first British team to win a European trophy by winning the 1962–63 European Cup Winners' Cup when they beat Atlético Madrid 5–1 in the final.[36] Spurs also became the first British team to win two different European trophies when they won the 1971–72 UEFA Cup with a rebuilt team that included Martin Chivers, Pat Jennings, and Steve Perryman.[37] They had also won the FA Cup in 1967,[38] two League Cups (in 1971 and 1973), as well as a second place league finish (1962–63) and runners-up to the 1973–74 UEFA Cup. In total, Nicholson won eight major trophies in his 16 years at the club as manager.[29] Spurs went into a period of decline after the successes of the early 1970s, and Nicholson resigned after a poor start to the 1974–75 season.[39] The team was then relegated at the end of the 1976–77 season with Keith Burkinshaw as manager. Burkinshaw quickly returned the club to the top flight, building a team that included Glenn Hoddle, as well as two Argentinians, Osvaldo Ardiles and Ricardo Villa, which was unusual as players from outside the British Isles were rare at that time.[40] The team that Burkinshaw rebuilt went on to win the FA Cup in 1981 and 1982[41] and the UEFA Cup in 1984.[42] The 1980s was a period of change that began with a new phase of redevelopment at White Hart Lane, as well as a change of directors. Irving Scholar took over the club and moved it in a more commercial direction, the beginning of the transformation of English football clubs into commercial enterprises.[43][44] Debt at the club would again lead to a change in the boardroom, and Terry Venables teamed up with businessman Alan Sugar in June 1991 to take control of Tottenham Hotspur plc.[45][46][47] Venables, who had become manager in 1987, signed players such as Paul Gascoigne and Gary Lineker. Under Venables, Spurs won the 1990–91 FA Cup, making them the first club to win eight FA Cups.[48] Tottenham was one of the five clubs that pushed for the founding of the Premier League, created with the approval of The Football Association, replacing the Football League First Division as the highest division of English football.[49] Despite a succession of managers and players such as Teddy Sheringham, Jürgen Klinsmann and David Ginola, for a long period in the Premier League until the late 2000s, Spurs finished mid-table most seasons with few trophies won. They won the League Cup in 1999 under George Graham, and again in 2008 under Juande Ramos. Performance improved under Harry Redknapp with players such as Gareth Bale and Luka Modrić, and the club finished in the top five in the early 2010s.[50][51] In February 2001, Sugar sold his shareholding in Spurs to ENIC Sports plc, run by Joe Lewis and Daniel Levy, and stepped down as chairman.[52] Lewis and Levy would eventually own 85% of the club, with Levy responsible for the running of the club.[53][54] They appointed Mauricio Pochettino as head coach, who was in the role between 2014 and 2019.[55] Under Pochettino, Spurs finished second in the 2016–17 season, their highest league finish since the 1962–63 season, and advanced to the UEFA Champions League final in 2019, the club's first, where they ultimately lost to Liverpool 2–0.[56][57][58] Pochettino was subsequently sacked after a poor start to the 2019–20 season, in November 2019, and was replaced by José Mourinho.[59] Mourinho was sacked in April 2021,[60] while Nuno Espírito Santo lasted just four months as his successor.[61] The next manager, Antonio Conte, guided Spurs to fourth during the 2021–22 season and back to a Champions League place.[62] Following a poor run of form, Conte criticised the players and management of the club in press conferences; after exiting both the Champions League and FA Cup, he departed the club by mutual agreement in March 2023.[63][64] Ange Postecoglou took over as head coach on 1 July 2023[65] and the club qualified for the 2024–25 UEFA Europa League after a fifth-place finish in the Premier League. Spurs played their early matches on public land at the Park Lane end of Tottenham Marshes, where they had to mark out and prepare their own pitch.[9] Occasionally fights broke out on the marshes in disputes with other teams over the use of the ground.[66] The first Spurs game reported by the local press took place on Tottenham Marshes on 6 October 1883 against Brownlow Rovers, which Spurs won 9–0.[67] It was at this ground that, in 1887, Spurs first played the team that would later become their arch rivals, Arsenal (then known as Royal Arsenal), leading 2–1 until the match was called off due to poor light after the away team arrived late.[68] As they played on public parkland, the club could not charge admission fees and, while the number of spectators grew to a few thousand, it yielded no gate receipts. In 1888, the club rented a pitch between numbers 69 and 75 Northumberland Park[69] at a cost of £17 per annum, where spectators were charged 3d a game, raised to 6d for cup ties.[70] The first game at the Park was played on 13 October 1888, a reserve match that yielded gate receipts of 17 shillings. The first stand with just over 100 seats and changing rooms underneath was built at the ground for the 1894–95 season at a cost of £60. However, the stand was blown down a few weeks later and had to be repaired.[71] In April 1898, 14,000 fans turned up to watch Spurs play Woolwich Arsenal. Spectators climbed on the roof of the refreshment stand for a better view of the match. The stand collapsed, causing a few injuries. As Northumberland Park could no longer cope with the larger crowds, Spurs looked for a larger ground and moved to the White Hart Lane site in 1899.[72] The White Hart Lane ground was built on an unused plant nursery owned by the Charrington Brewery and located behind a public house named the White Hart on Tottenham High Road (the road White Hart Lane actually lies a few hundred yards north of the main entrance). The ground was initially leased from Charringtons, and the stands they used at Northumberland Park were moved here, giving shelter for 2,500 spectators.[73] Notts County were the first visitors to 'the Lane' in a friendly watched by 5,000 people and yielding £115 in receipts; Spurs won 4–1.[74] Queens Park Rangers became the first competitive visitors to the ground and 11,000 people saw them lose 1–0 to Tottenham. In 1905, Tottenham raised enough money to buy the freehold to the land, as well as land at the northern (Paxton Road) end.[73] After Spurs were admitted to the Football League, the club started to build a new stadium, with stands designed by Archibald Leitch being constructed over the next two and a half decades. The West Stand was added in 1909, the East Stand was also covered this year and extended further two years later. The profits from the 1921 FA Cup win were used to build a covered terrace at the Paxton Road end and the Park Lane end was built at a cost of over £3,000 some two years later. This increased the stadium's capacity to around 58,000, with room for 40,000 under cover. The East Stand (Worcester Avenue) was finished in 1934 and this increased capacity to around 80,000 spectators and cost £60,000.[73] Starting in the early 1980s, the stadium underwent another major phase of redevelopment. The West Stand was replaced by an expensive new structure in 1982, and the East Stand was renovated in 1988. In 1992, following the Taylor Report's recommendation that Premier League clubs eliminate standing areas, the lower terraces of the south and east stand were converted to seating, with the North Stand becoming all-seater the following season. The South Stand redevelopment was completed in March 1995 and included the first giant Sony Jumbotron TV screen for live game coverage and away match screenings.[75] In the 1997–98 season the Paxton Road stand received a new upper tier and a second Jumbotron screen.[75] Minor amendments to the seating configuration were made in 2006, bringing the capacity of the stadium to 36,310.[73] By the turn of the millennium, the capacity of White Hart Lane had become lower than other major Premier League clubs. Talks began over the future of the ground with a number of schemes considered, such as increasing the stadium capacity through redevelopment of the current site, or using of the 2012 London Olympic Stadium in Stratford.[76][77] Eventually the club settled on the Northumberland Development Project, whereby a new stadium would be built on a larger piece of land that incorporated the existing site. In 2016, the northeast corner of the stadium was removed to facilitate the construction of the new stadium. As this reduced the stadium capacity below that required for European games, Tottenham Hotspur played every European home game in 2016–17 at Wembley Stadium.[78] Domestic fixtures of the 2016–17 season continued to be played at the Lane, but demolition of the rest of the stadium started the day after the last game of the season,[79] and White Hart Lane was completely demolished by the end of July 2017.[80] In October 2008, the club announced a plan to build a new stadium immediately to the north of the existing White Hart Lane stadium, with the southern half of the new stadium's pitch overlapping the northern part of the Lane.[81] This proposal would become the Northumberland Development Project. The club submitted a planning application in October 2009 but, following critical reactions to the plan, it was withdrawn in favour of a substantially revised planning application for the stadium and other associated developments. The new plan was resubmitted and approved by Haringey Council in September 2010,[82] and an agreement for the Northumberland Development Project was signed on 20 September 2011.[83] After a long delay over the compulsory purchase order of local businesses located on land to the north of the stadium and a legal challenge against the order,[84][85] resolved in early 2015,[86] planning application for another new design was approved by Haringey Council on 17 December 2015.[87] Construction started in 2016,[88] and the new stadium was scheduled to open during the 2018–19 season.[89][90] While it was under construction, all Tottenham home games in the 2017–18 season as well as all but five in 2018–19 were played at Wembley Stadium.[91] After two successful test events, Tottenham Hotspur officially moved into the new ground on 3 April 2019[92] with a Premier League match against Crystal Palace which Spurs won 2–0.[93] The new stadium is called Tottenham Hotspur Stadium while a naming-rights agreement is reached.[94] An early training ground used by Tottenham was located at Brookfield Lane in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire. The club bought the 11-acre ground used by Cheshunt F.C. in 1952 for £35,000.[95][96] It had three pitches, including a small stadium with a small stand used for matches by the junior team.[97] The ground was later sold for over £4 million,[98] and the club moved the training ground to the Spurs Lodge on Luxborough Lane, Chigwell in Essex, opened in September 1996 by Tony Blair.[99] The training ground and press centre in Chigwell were used until 2014.[100] In 2007, Tottenham bought a site at Bulls Cross in Enfield, a few miles south of their former ground in Cheshunt. A new training ground was constructed at the site for £45 million, which opened in 2012.[101] The 77-acre site has 15 grass pitches and one-and-a-half artificial pitches, as well as a covered artificial pitch in the main building.[102][103] The main building on Hotspur Way also has hydrotherapy and swimming pools, gyms, medical facilities, dining and rest areas for players as well as classrooms for academy and schoolboy players. A 45-bedroom players lodge with catering, treatment, rest and rehabilitation facilities was later added at Myddleton Farm next to the training site in 2018.[104][105] The lodge is mainly used by Tottenham's first team and Academy players, but it has also been used by national football teams – the first visitors to use the facilities at the site were the Brazilian team in preparation for the 2018 FIFA World Cup.[106] Since the 1921 FA Cup Final the Tottenham Hotspur crest has featured a cockerel. Harry Hotspur, after whom the club is named, was said to have been given the nickname Hotspur as he dug in his spurs to make his horse go faster as he charged in battles,[107] and spurs are also associated with fighting cocks.[108] The club used spurs as a symbol in 1900, which then evolved into a fighting cock.[107] A former player named William James Scott made a bronze cast of a cockerel standing on a football at a cost of £35 (equivalent to £4,610 in 2023), and this 9-foot-6-inch (2.90 m) figure was then placed on top of the West Stand at the end of the 1909–10 season.[107] Since then the cockerel and ball emblem has become a part of the club's identity.[109] The club badge on the shirt used in 1921 featured a cockerel within a shield, but it was changed to a cockerel sitting on a ball in the late 1960s.[108] Between 1956 and 2006 Spurs used a faux heraldic shield featuring a number of local landmarks and associations. The castle is Bruce Castle, 400 yards from the ground and the trees are the Seven Sisters. The arms featured the Latin motto Audere Est Facere (to dare is to do).[66] In 1983, to overcome unauthorised \"pirate\" merchandising, the club's badge was altered by adding the two red heraldic lions to flank the shield (which came from the arms of the Northumberland family, of which Harry Hotspur was a member), as well as the motto scroll. This device appeared on Spurs' playing kits for three seasons 1996–99. In 2006, in order to rebrand and modernise the club's image, the club badge and coat of arms were replaced by a professionally designed logo/emblem.[110] This revamp displayed a sleeker and more elegant cockerel standing on an old-time football. The club claimed that they dropped their club name and would be using the rebranded logo only on playing kits.[111] In November 2013, Tottenham forced non-league club Fleet Spurs to change their badge because its new design was \"too similar\" to the Tottenham crest.[112] In 2017, Spurs added a shield around the cockerel logo on the shirts similar to the 1950s badge, but with the cockerel of modern design.[113] The shield was however removed the following season. The first Tottenham kit recorded in 1883 included a navy blue shirt with a letter H on a scarlet shield on the left breast, and white breeches.[114] In 1884 or 1885, the club changed to a \"quartered\" kit similar to Blackburn Rovers after watching them win in the 1884 FA Cup Final.[115] After they moved to Northumberland Park in 1888, they returned to the navy blue shirts for the 1889–90 season. Their kit changed again to red shirt and blue shorts in 1890, and for a time the team were known as 'the Tottenham Reds'.[116] Five years later in 1895, the year they became a professional club, they switched to a chocolate and gold striped kit.[66] In the 1898–99 season, their final year at Northumberland Park, the club switched colours to white shirts and blue shorts, same colour choice as that for Preston North End.[117] White and navy blue have remained as the club's basic colours ever since, with the white shirts giving the team the nickname \"The Lilywhites\".[118] In 1921, the year they won the FA Cup, the cockerel badge was added to the shirt for the final. A club crest has featured on the shirt since, and Spurs became the first major club to have its club crest on the players shirt on every match apart from the war years.[119] In 1939 numbers first appeared on shirt backs.[66] In the early days, the team played in kits sold by local outfitters. An early supplier of Spurs' jerseys recorded was a firm on Seven Sisters Road, HR Brookes.[70] In the 1920s, Bukta produced the jerseys for the club. From the mid-1930s onwards, Umbro was the supplier for forty years. In 1959, the V-neck shirt replaced the collared shirts of the past, and then in 1963, the crew neck shirt appeared (the style has fluctuated since).[120] In 1961, Bill Nicholson sent Spurs players out to play in white instead of navy shorts for their European campaign, starting a tradition which continues to this day in European competitions.[121] In 1977, a deal was signed with Admiral to supply the team their kits. Although Umbro kits in generic colours had been sold to football fans since 1959, it was with the Admiral deal that the market for replica shirts started to take off.[122] Admiral changed the plain colours of earlier strips to shirts with more elaborate designs, which included manufacturer's logos, stripes down the arms and trims on the edges.[122] Admiral was replaced by Le Coq Sportif in the summer of 1980.[123] In 1985, Spurs entered into a business partnership with Hummel, who then supplied the strips.[124] However, the attempt by Tottenham to expand the business side of the club failed, and in 1991, they returned to Umbro.[125] In 1991, the club was the first to wear long-cut shorts, an innovation at a time when football kits all featured shorts cut well above the knee.[66] Umbro was followed by Pony in 1995, Adidas in 1999, Kappa in 2002,[66][126] and a five-year deal with Puma in 2006.[127] In March 2011, Under Armour announced a five-year deal to supply Spurs with shirts and other apparel from the start of 2012–13,[128][129] with the home, away and the third kits revealed in July and August 2012.[130][131] The shirts incorporate technology that can monitor the players' heart rate and temperature and send the biometric data to the coaching staff.[132] In June 2017, it was announced that Nike would be their new kits supplier, with the 2017–18 kit released on 30 June, featuring the Spurs' crest encased in a shield, paying homage to Spurs' 1960–61 season, where they became the first post-war-club to win both the Football League First Division and the FA Cup.[133] In October 2018, Nike agreed a 15-year deal reportedly worth £30 million a year with the club to supply their kits until 2033.[134] Shirt sponsorship in English football was first adopted by the non-league club Kettering Town F.C. in 1976 despite it being banned by the FA.[135] FA soon lifted the ban, and this practice spread to the major clubs when sponsored shirts were allowed on non-televised games in 1979, and then on televised games as well in 1983.[132][136] In December 1983, after the club was floated on the London Stock Exchange, Holsten became the first commercial sponsor logo to appear on a Spurs shirt.[137] When Thomson was chosen as kit sponsor in 2002 some Tottenham fans were unhappy as the shirt-front logo was red, the colour of their closest rivals, Arsenal.[138] In 2006, Tottenham secured a £34 million sponsorship deal with internet casino group Mansion.com.[139] In July 2010, Spurs announced a two-year shirt sponsorship contract with software infrastructure company Autonomy said to be worth £20 million.[140] A month later they unveiled a £5 million deal with leading specialist bank and asset management firm Investec as shirt sponsor for the Champions League and domestic cup competitions for the next two years.[141][142] Since 2014, AIA has been the main shirt sponsor, initially in a deal worth over £16 million annually,[143][144] increased to a reported £40 to £45 million per year in 2019 in an eight-year deal that lasts until 2027.[145][146] In 2023, Tottenham provisionally agreed a three-year shirt sponsorship deal with South Africa Tourism (SAT) starting in 2023/24 and ending in the 2026/27 season.[147] Tottenham Hotspur F.C. became a limited company, the Tottenham Hotspur Football and Athletic Company Ltd, on 2 March 1898 so as to raise funds for the club and limit the personal liability of its members. 8,000 shares were issued at £1 each, although only 1,558 shares were taken up in the first year.[155] 4,892 shares were sold in total by 1905.[156] A few families held significant shares; they included the Wale family, who had association with the club since the 1930s,[157] as well as the Richardson and the Bearman families. From 1943 to 1984, members of these families were chairmen of Tottenham Hotspur F.C. after Charles Robert who had been chairman since 1898 died.[158] In the early 1980s, cost overruns in the construction of a new West Stand together with the cost of rebuilding the team in previous years led to accumulating debts. In November 1982, a fan of the club Irving Scholar bought 25% of Tottenham for £600,000, and together with Paul Bobroff gained control of the club.[47] In order to bring in funds, Scholar floated Tottenham Hotspur plc, which wholly owns the football club, on the London Stock Exchange in 1983, the first European sports club to be listed in a stock market, and became the first sports company to go public.[43][156] Fans and institutions alike can now freely buy and trade shares in the company; a court ruling in 1935 involving the club (Berry and Stewart v Tottenham Hotspur FC Ltd) had previously established a precedent in company law that the directors of a company can refuse the transfer of shares from a shareholder to another person.[159] The share issue was successful with 3.8 million shares quickly sold.[160] However, ill-judged business decisions under Scholar led to financial difficulties,[155] and in June 1991 Terry Venables teamed up with businessman Alan Sugar to buy the club, initially as equal partner with each investing £3.25 million. Sugar increased his stake to £8 million by December 1991 and became the dominant partner with effective control of the club. In May 1993, Venables was sacked from the board after a dispute.[161] By 2000, Sugar began to consider selling the club,[162] and in February 2001, he sold the major part of his shareholding to ENIC International Ltd.[163] The majority shareholder, ENIC International Ltd, is an investment company established by the British billionaire Joe Lewis. Daniel Levy, Lewis's partner at ENIC, is Executive Chairman of the club. They first acquired 29.9% share of the club in 1991, of which 27% was bought from Sugar for £22 million.[163] Shareholding by ENIC increased over the decade through the purchase of the remaining 12% holding of Alan Sugar in 2007 for £25m,[164][165] and the 9.9% stake belonging to Stelios Haji-Ioannou through Hodram Inc. in 2009. On 21 August 2009 the club reported that they had issued a further 30 million shares to fund the initial development costs of the new stadium project, and that 27.8 million of these new shares had been purchased by ENIC.[166] The Annual Report for 2010 indicated that ENIC had acquired 76% of all Ordinary Shares and also held 97% of all convertible redeemable preference shares, equivalent to a holding of 85% of share capital.[167] The remaining shares are held by over 30,000 individuals.[168] Between 2001 and 2011 shares in Tottenham Hotspur F.C. were listed on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM index). Following an announcement at the 2011 AGM, in January 2012 Tottenham Hotspur confirmed that the club had delisted its shares from the stock market, taking it into private ownership.[169] Lewis' shares are owned by the Lewis Family Trusts. In October 2022, Lewis ceased to be a person with significant control of the club, following a reorganisation of the Trusts. The club continues to be owned by Levy and the Lewis trusts and, in the summer of 2022, ENIC intended to inject up to £150 million into the club by the issuing of new shares.[170][171] Only £100 million of shares were subscribed for and this took ENIC's shareholding up to 86.58%.[172] Tottenham has a large fan base in the United Kingdom, drawn largely from North London and the Home counties. The attendance figures for its home matches, however, have fluctuated over the years. Five times between 1950 and 1962, Tottenham had the highest average attendance in England.[173][174] Tottenham was 9th in average attendances for the 2008–09 Premier League season, and 11th for all Premier League seasons.[175] In the 2017–18 season when Tottenham used Wembley as its home ground, it had the second-highest attendance in the Premier League.[176][177] It also holds the record for attendance in the Premier League, with 83,222 attending the North London derby on 10 February 2018.[178] Historical supporters of the club have included such figures as philosopher A. J. Ayer.[179][180] There are many official supporters' clubs located around the world,[181] while an independent supporters club, the Tottenham Hotspur Supporters' Trust, is officially recognised by the club as the representative body for Spurs supporters.[182][183] Historically, the club had a significant Jewish following from the Jewish communities in east and north London, with around a third of its supporters estimated to be Jewish in the 1930s.[184] Due to this early support, all three chairmen of the club since 1984 have been Jewish businessmen with prior history of supporting the club.[184] The club no longer has a greater Jewish contingent among its fans than other major London clubs (Jewish supporters are estimated to form at most 5% of its fanbase), though it is nevertheless still identified as a Jewish club by rival fans.[185] Antisemitic chants directed at the club and its supporters by rival fans have been heard since the 1960s, with words such as \"Yids\" or \"Yiddos\" used against Tottenham supporters.[184][186][187] In response to the abusive chants, Tottenham supporters, Jewish and non-Jewish alike, began to chant back the insults and adopt the \"Yids\" or \"Yid Army\" identity starting from around the late 1970s or early 1980s.[188] Some fans view adopting \"Yid\" as a badge of pride, helping defuse its power as an insult.[189] The use of \"Yid\" as a self-identification, however, has been controversial; some argued that the word is offensive and its use by Spurs fans \"legitimis[es] references to Jews in football\",[190] and that such racist abuse should be stamped out in football.[191] Both the World Jewish Congress and the Board of Deputies of British Jews have denounced the use of the word by fans.[192] Others, such as former Prime Minister David Cameron, argued that its use by the Spurs fans is not motivated by hate as it is not used pejoratively, and therefore cannot be considered hate speech.[193] Attempts to prosecute Tottenham fans who chanted the words have failed, as the Crown Prosecution Service considered that the words as used by Tottenham fans could not be judged legally \"threatening, abusive or insulting\".[194] There are a number of songs associated with the club and frequently sung by Spurs fans, such as \"Glory Glory Tottenham Hotspur\". The song originated in 1961 after Spurs completed the Double in 1960–61, and the club entered the European Cup for the first time. Their first opponents were Górnik Zabrze, the Polish champions, and after a hard-fought match Spurs suffered a 4–2 reverse. Tottenham's tough tackling prompted the Polish press to write that \"they were no angels\". These comments incensed a group of three fans and for the return match at White Hart Lane they dressed as angels wearing white sheets fashioned into togas, sandals, false beards and carrying placards bearing biblical-type slogans. The angels were allowed on the perimeter of the pitch and their fervour whipped up the home fans who responded with a rendition of \"Glory Glory Hallelujah\", which is still sung on terraces at White Hart Lane and other football grounds.[195] The Lilywhites also responded to the atmosphere to win the tie 8–1. Then manager of Spurs, Bill Nicholson, wrote in his autobiography: A new sound was heard in English football in the 1961–62 season. It was the hymn Glory, Glory Hallelujah being sung by 60,000 fans at White Hart Lane in our European Cup matches. I don't know how it started or who started it, but it took over the ground like a religious feeling. There had been a number of incidents of hooliganism involving Spurs fans, particularly in the 1970s and 1980s. Significant events include the rioting by Spurs fans in Rotterdam at the 1974 UEFA Cup Final against Feyenoord, and again during the 1983–84 UEFA Cup matches against Feyenoord in Rotterdam and Anderlecht in Brussels.[197] Although fan violence has since abated, the occasional incidence of hooliganism continues to be reported.[198][199] Tottenham supporters have rivalries with several clubs, mainly within the London area. The fiercest of these is with north London rivals Arsenal. The rivalry began in 1913 when Arsenal moved from the Manor Ground, Plumstead to Arsenal Stadium, Highbury, and this rivalry intensified in 1919 when Arsenal were unexpectedly promoted to the First Division, taking a place that Tottenham believed should have been theirs.[200] Tottenham also share notable rivalries with fellow London clubs Chelsea and West Ham United.[201] The rivalry with Chelsea is secondary in importance to the one with Arsenal[201] and began when Tottenham beat Chelsea in the 1967 FA Cup Final, the first ever all-London final.[202] West Ham fans view Tottenham as a bitter rival, although the animosity is not reciprocated to the same extent by Tottenham fans.[203] The club through its Community Programme has, since 2006, been working with Haringey Council and the Metropolitan Housing Trust and the local community on developing sports facilities and social programmes which have also been financially supported by Barclays Spaces for Sport and the Football Foundation.[204][205] The Tottenham Hotspur Foundation received high-level political support from the prime minister when it was launched at 10 Downing Street in February 2007.[206] In March 2007 the club announced a partnership with the charity SOS Children's Villages UK, whereby player fines would go towards this charity's children's village in Rustenburg, South Africa to support of a variety of community development projects in and around Rustenburg.[207] In the financial year 2006–07, Tottenham topped a league of Premier League charitable donations when viewed both in overall terms[208] and as a percentage of turnover by giving £4,545,889, including a one-off contribution of £4.5 million over four years, to set up the Tottenham Hotspur Foundation.[209] In contrast, they have successfully sought the reduction of section 106 planning obligations connected to the redevelopment of the stadium in the Northumberland Development Project. Initially the development would incorporate 50% affordable housing, but this requirement was later waived, and a payment of £16m for community infrastructure was reduced to £0.5m.[210] This is controversial in an area which has suffered high levels of deprivation as Spurs had bought up properties for redevelopment, removing existing jobs and businesses for property development but not creating enough new jobs for the area.[211] The club however argued that the project, when completed, would support 3,500 jobs and inject an estimated £293 million into the local economy annually,[212] and that it would serve as the catalyst for a wider 20-year regeneration programme for the Tottenham area.[213][214] In other developments in Tottenham, the club has built 256 affordable homes and a 400-pupil primary school.[215][216] As part of the development of Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, the club built an elite educational facility to sit alongside its club offices.[217] The London Academy of Excellence Tottenham (LAET) is a state-funded Sixth Form, sponsored by the Club and Highgate School - the principle academic sponsors who deliver expert teaching.[218] LAET was named the Sunday Times Sixth Form College of the Year, 2020 by Parent Power, The Sunday Times School Guide.[219] In 2022, LAET achieved an 'Outstanding' Ofsted rating across all areas.[220] Spurs are one of the high-profile participants in the 10:10 project, which they joined in 2009. In a year, the carbon emissions were reduced by 14%, an estimated 400 tonnes of carbon.[221] The club further said it is dedicated to minimising the environmental impact of its activities across all operations, setting targets to reduce its carbon emissions by 50% by 2030 and become net-zero by 2040.[222][223][224] In September 2021, the club partnered with Sky Sports to host the world's first net-zero carbon top-level football game.[225][226] The initiative won in the Sustainability category at the 2022 Football Business Awards.[227][228] In 2023, the club was ranked top in Premier League's Sustainability Rankings for fourth year running.[229] Sources: Tottenham Hotspur – History[230] Steve Perryman holds the appearance record for Spurs, having played 854 games for the club between 1969 and 1986, of which 655 were league matches.[232][233] Harry Kane holds the club goal scoring record with 280 goals scored. Tottenham's record league win is 9–0 against Bristol Rovers in the Second Division on 22 October 1977.[234][235] The club's record cup victory came on 3 February 1960 with a 13–2 win over Crewe Alexandra in the FA Cup.[236] Spurs' biggest top-flight victory came against Wigan Athletic on 22 November 2009, when they won 9–1 with Jermain Defoe scoring five goals.[235][237] The club's record defeat is an 8–0 loss to 1. FC Köln in the Intertoto Cup on 22 July 1995.[238] The record home attendance at White Hart Lane was 75,038 on 5 March 1938 in a cup tie against Sunderland.[239] The highest recorded home attendances were at their temporary home, Wembley Stadium, due to its higher capacity – 85,512 spectators were present on 2 November 2016 for the 2016–17 UEFA Champions League game against Bayer Leverkusen,[240] while 83,222 attended the North London derby against Arsenal on 10 February 2018 which is the highest attendance recorded for any Premier League game.[241] The club is ranked No. 21 by UEFA with a club coefficient of 80.0 points as of June 2023[update].[242] Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules; some limited exceptions apply. Players may hold more than one non-FIFA nationality. Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules; some limited exceptions apply. Players may hold more than one non-FIFA nationality. The following players are noted as \"greats\" for their contributions to the club or have been inducted into the club's Hall of Fame:[255][256][257] The most recent additions to the club's Hall of Fame are Steve Perryman and Jimmy Greaves on 20 April 2016.[258] Tottenham's women's team was founded in 1985 as Broxbourne Ladies. They started using the Tottenham Hotspur name for the 1991–92 season and played in the London and South East Women's Regional Football League (then fourth tier of the game). They won promotion after topping the league in 2007–08. In the 2016–17 season they won the FA Women's Premier League Southern Division and a subsequent playoff, gaining promotion to the FA Women's Super League 2.[260] On 1 May 2019 Tottenham Hotspur Ladies won promotion to the FA Women's Super League with a 1–1 draw at Aston Villa, which confirmed they would finish second in the Championship.[261] Tottenham Hotspur Ladies changed their name to Tottenham Hotspur Women in the 2019–20 season.[262] Tottenham Hotspur Women announced the signing of Cho So-hyun on 29 January 2021. With her Korean men's counterpart Son Heung-min already at the club it gave Spurs the rare distinction of having both the men's and women's Korean National Team captains at one club.[263] Tottenham Hotspur competed in Superleague Formula for three seasons from 2008 to 2010. Duncan Tappy was the main driver in the first season racing 10 times with 3 podium finishes. In 2010 Tottenham won the trophy with driver Craig Dolby.[264] Through its partnership with F1, the club has also introduced Go Karting.[265] Three track layouts are available, suiting everyone from beginners to elite karters.[266]",

                "content": "Tottenham (/ˈtɒtənəm/,[2][3] TOT-ən-əm, /tɒtnəm/, tot-nəm) is a town in north London, England, within the London Borough of Haringey. It is located in the ceremonial county of Greater London. Tottenham is centred 6 mi (10 km) north-northeast of Charing Cross,[4] bordering Edmonton to the north, Walthamstow, across the River Lea, to the east, and Stamford Hill to the south, with Wood Green and Harringay to the west. The area rapidly expanded in the late-19th century, becoming a working-class suburb of London following the advent of the railway and mass development of housing for the lower-middle and working classes. It has been home to the Premier League football club Tottenham Hotspur since 1882. The parish of Tottenham was granted urban district status in 1894 and municipal borough status in 1934. Following the Second World War, the area saw large-scale development of council housing, including tower blocks. Until 1965 Tottenham was in the historic county of Middlesex. In 1965, the borough of Tottenham merged with the municipal boroughs of Hornsey and Wood Green to form the London Borough of Haringey. Tottenham is renowned for its multicultural, ethnically diverse population. Following an influx of an Afro-Caribbean population during the Windrush era in the mid-20th century, it became one of the most ethnically diverse areas in Britain. It has more recently become home to an increased population from Africa, Asia, South America and Eastern Europe. At the 2011 census, the population of Tottenham was 129,237. Tottenham is believed to have been named after Tota, a farmer, whose hamlet was mentioned in the Domesday Book. 'Tota's hamlet', it is thought, developed into 'Tottenham'. The settlement was recorded in the Domesday Book as Toteham, in the ancient hundred of Edmonton.[5][6] It is not related to Tottenham Court Road in Central London, though the two names share a similar-sounding root.[7] There has been a settlement at Tottenham for over a thousand years. It grew up along the old Roman road, Ermine Street (some of which is part of the present A10 road), and between High Cross and Tottenham Hale, the present Monument Way. When the Domesday Book was compiled in 1086, about 70 families lived within the area of the manor, mostly labourers working for the Lord of the Manor. A humorous poem entitled the Tournament of Tottenham, written around 1400, describes a mock-battle between peasants vying for the reeve's daughter. The River Lea (or Lee) was the eastern boundary between the Municipal Boroughs of Tottenham and Walthamstow. It is the ancient boundary between Middlesex and Essex and also formed the western boundary of the Viking controlled Danelaw. Today it is the boundary between the London Boroughs of Haringey and Waltham Forest. A major tributary of the Lea, the River Moselle, also crosses the borough from west to east, and often caused serious flooding until it was mostly covered in the 19th century. From the Tudor period onwards, Tottenham became a popular recreation and leisure destination for wealthy Londoners. Henry VIII is known to have visited Bruce Castle[8] and also hunted in Tottenham Wood. A rural Tottenham also featured in Izaak Walton's book The Compleat Angler, published in 1653.[9] The area became noted for its large Quaker population[10] and its schools (including Rowland Hill[11] at Bruce Castle[12]). Tottenham remained a semi-rural and upper middle class area until the 1870s. In late 1870s, the Great Eastern Railway introduced special workman's trains and fares on its newly opened Enfield and Walthamstow branch lines. Tottenham's low-lying fields and market gardens were then rapidly transformed into cheap housing for the lower middle and working classes, who were able to commute cheaply to inner London. The workman's fare policy stimulated the relatively early development of the area into a London suburb. In 1894, Tottenham was made an urban district and on 27 September 1934 it became a municipal borough. As from 1 April 1965, the municipal borough formed part of the London Borough of Haringey together with Hornsey and Wood Green. An incident occurred on 23 January 1909, which was at the time known as the Tottenham Outrage.[13] Two armed robbers, Latvian Jews of Russian extraction, held up the wages clerk of rubber works in Chestnut Road. They made their getaway via Tottenham Marshes and fled across the Lea. On the opposite bank of the river, they hijacked a Walthamstow Corporation tramcar, hotly pursued by the police on another tram. The hijacked tram was stopped but the robbers continued their flight on foot. After firing their weapons and killing two people, Ralph Joscelyne, aged 10, and PC William Tyler, they were eventually cornered by the police and shot themselves rather than be captured. Fourteen other people were wounded during the chase. The incident later became the subject of a silent film.[14] During the Second World War Tottenham was one of the many targets of the German air offensive against Britain. Bombs fell in the borough (Elmar Road) during the first air raid on London on 24 August 1940. The borough also received V-1 (four incidents) and V-2 hits, the last of which occurred on 15 March 1945. Wartime shortages led to the creation of Tottenham Pudding, a mixture of household waste food which was converted into feeding stuff for pigs and poultry.[15] The \"pudding\" was named by Queen Mary on a visit to Tottenham Refuse Works. Production continued into the post-war period, its demise coinciding with the merging of the borough into the new London Borough of Haringey. The Broadwater Farm riot occurred around the Broadwater Farm Estate on 6 October 1985 following the death of Cynthia Jarrett. Jarrett was a resident of Tottenham who lived about one mile (two kilometres) from the estate, who died of heart failure during a police search of her home. The tension between local black youths and the largely white Metropolitan Police had been high due to a combination of local issues and the aftermath of riots in Brixton which had occurred in the previous week. The response of some of the black community in Tottenham and surrounding areas culminated in a riot beginning on Tottenham High Road and ending in Broadwater Farm Estate. One police officer, Keith Blakelock, was murdered; 58 policemen and 24 other people were injured in the fighting. Two of the policemen were injured by gunshots during the riot, the first time that firearms had been used in that type of confrontation.[16] The 2011 Tottenham riots were a series of riots precipitated by the fatal shooting of Mark Duggan, a 29-year-old man in Tottenham, by police officers on 4 August 2011.[17][18][19][clarification needed] Attacks were carried out on two police cars, a bus, a Post Office and several local shops from 8:00 pm onwards on 6 August 2011. Riot police vans attended the scene of disturbances on Tottenham High Road. Later in the evening, the riot spread, with an Aldi supermarket and a branch of Allied Carpets also destroyed by fire, and widespread looting in nearby Wood Green shopping centre and the retail park at Tottenham Hale. Several flats above shops on Tottenham High Road collapsed due to the fires. 26 shared ownership flats in the Union Point development above the Carpetright store – built in the landmark Cooperative department store building – were also destroyed by fire. The triggering event was when a group of over one hundred local Tottenham residents set out to undertake a protest march against the killing of Mark Duggan, who was shot by police officers assigned to Operation Trident earlier in the week. The crowd made up of Duggan's family and local community leaders, gathered outside Tottenham police station on 6 August 2011 to protest the failure of the police to provide family members with a formal notice of the killing.[20] The circumstances surrounding Duggan's death were not entirely clear at the time of the riot. On 17 August 2011, the Prince of Wales and his wife Duchess of Cornwall visited an emergency center to meet victims of the riots.[21] Tottenham is the biggest part of the parliamentary constituency of Tottenham. The constituency was created in 1885 when the first MP was Joseph Howard of the Conservative Party. The boundaries were redrawn in 1918, and Tottenham was divided into two separate constituencies: Tottenham North and Tottenham South. Since being reinstated in 1950, it has been predominantly represented by MPs from the Labour Party, with the exception of Alan Brown who defected to the Conservatives due to disagreement with the Labour Party's defence policy at the time. The current MP is David Lammy who won a by-election in 2000 following the death of Bernie Grant. Tottenham was at the center of a local administrative area from the medieval period until 1965. The administrative area developed from a parish in Middlesex into an Urban sanitary district in 1875, after a local board of health had been established in 1850. It was then divided in 1888 and Wood Green became a separate authority.[22] In 1894, Tottenham was reconstituted first as an urban district, based at Tottenham Town Hall, then as a municipal borough in 1934.[23] Under the Local Government Act 1963, it became part of the larger London Borough of Haringey. The Tottenham neighbourhood is now one of twenty neighbourhoods in Haringey. Its elevation is approximately 33 ft (10 m) above sea level. Because of Tottenham's long history as a borough, the Tottenham name is used by some to this day to describe the whole of the area formerly covered by the old borough, incorporating the N17 postcode area and part of N15.[24] However, there are differing views as to what constitutes the Tottenham neighbourhood in the present day. Many think of Tottenham today as most of the area covered by the N17 post code, sometimes using the phrase 'Tottenham Proper' to describe it and to distinguish it from the other parts of the old borough.[25] A claim made by MP David Lammy in 2011, indicated that at that time Tottenham had the highest unemployment rate in London and the eighth highest in the United Kingdom, and it had some of the highest poverty rates within the country.[26] Tottenham has a multicultural population, with many ethnic groups inhabiting the area. It contains one of the largest and most significant populations of Afro-Caribbean people. These were among the earliest groups of immigrants to settle in the area, starting from the UK's Windrush era. The Seven Sisters ward has the largest proportion of Jewish residents among Haringey wards, at 18.1%.[27] In the 2011 UK Census, the ethnic composition of the Tottenham constituency, of which Tottenham is a large part, was as follows:[28] Tottenham has been one of the main hotspots for gangs and gun crime in the United Kingdom during the past three decades. This followed the rise of gangs and drug wars throughout the area, notably those involving the Tottenham Mandem gang and various gangs from Hackney and all of the areas surrounding Tottenham, and the emergence of an organised crime ring known as the Turkish mafia fought other London gangs to allegedly control more than 90% of the UK's heroin market.[29] In 1999, Tottenham was identified as one of the yardies' strongholds in London, along with Hackney, Harlesden, Peckham and Brixton.[30] The Victoria line passes through Tottenham, calling at Seven Sisters and Tottenham Hale. This connects Tottenham directly to Walthamstow, the West End and Brixton.[36] The line has its operating depot in the area at Northumberland Park.[36] The area is served by two train operating companies: Tottenham is well served by many London Bus routes, including: 41, 76, 123, 149, 192, 230, 243, 259, 279, 318, 341, 349, 476, W3 and W4[39] The area is connected to both London and National cycle networks, with provisions for recreational and commuter cycling across Tottenham. The River Lea towpath is a shared-use path maintained by the Canal and River Trust.[45] Cycling infrastructure in maintained primarily by Transport for London (TfL) and the London Borough of Haringey. Tottenham is the home of Premier League football club Tottenham Hotspur. From 1899 until 2017, the club's home ground was White Hart Lane. In 2017, White Hart Lane ground closed and demolition commenced to make way for a new stadium on the same site, known as the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, as part of a wider project for the redevelopment of the area. The new stadium was due to open in September 2018, but was delayed until later in the 2018–19 season. The stadium was opened on 3 April 2019. For the 2017–18 season and most of the 2018–19 season, the club played their home games at Wembley. Tottenham also has two non-League football clubs, Haringey Borough F.C. who currently play at Coles Park Stadium and Park View who play at the White Hart Lane Community Sports Centre. The Tottenham & Wood Green Independent is a local newspaper published by Newsquest.[46] Tottenham cake is a sponge cake baked in large metal trays, covered either in pink icing or jam (and occasionally decorated with shredded desiccated coconut). Tottenham cake's origins are unclear. There is reference to \"tottenham cakes\" as early as 1891 when the Far Famed Cake Company are credited as the originators of the confection. Singer Adele was born in Tottenham. [47] Another source states the cake \"was originally sold by the baker Henry Chalkley from 1901, who was a Friend (or Quaker), at the price of one old penny, with smaller mis-shaped pieces sold for half an old penny\". The pink colouring was derived from mulberries found growing at the Tottenham Friends burial ground.[48] Originally \"a peculiar local invention\"[49] of north London, the cake was later mass-produced by bakery chains such as Percy Ingle and Greggs.[50][51] The cake featured on The Great British Bake Off TV programme broadcast Tuesday 17 September 2013 on BBC2.[52]",

                "title": "Dallas Mavericks - Wikipedia",
                "content": "The Dallas Mavericks (often referred to as the Mavs) are an American professional basketball team based in Dallas. The Mavericks compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Southwest Division of the Western Conference. The team plays its home games at American Airlines Center, which it shares with the National Hockey League's Dallas Stars. Throughout the 1980s, the Mavericks were a perennial playoff team, led by All-Stars Rolando Blackman and Mark Aguirre. The team struggled during the 1990s, entering into a period of rebuilding. In 1998, the franchise's fortunes would change drastically with the acquisition of Dirk Nowitzki, who would become the cornerstone of the most successful period in franchise history, leading the team to its first NBA Finals appearance in 2006 and its only NBA championship in 2011. The Mavericks later entered a rebuilding phase in the tail end of Nowitzki's storied career; although they missed the playoffs in three consecutive years from 2017 to 2019 (after which Nowitzki retired following his record-breaking 21st season with Dallas), the franchise's fortunes immediately rebounded once again with the acquisition of Luka Dončić (who was named the 2019 Rookie of the Year); the Mavericks returned to the playoffs in 2020, reached the Western Conference finals in 2022 for the first time since their 2011 championship, and reached their third NBA Finals in 2024. In February 2020, the Mavericks sold out their NBA-record 815th consecutive game, dating back to December 15, 2001. The sellout streak, which includes 67 playoff games, is the longest currently running in North American major league sports.[9] Since the Mavericks' inaugural 1980–81 season, the Mavericks have won five division titles (1987, 2007, 2010, 2021, 2024), three conference championships (2006, 2011, 2024) and one NBA championship (2011). In 1978, Californian businessman Garn Eckardt met Dallas lawyer Doug Adkins and mentioned he was trying to raise capital to move an NBA team to Dallas. Asking for a possible partner, Adkins recommended him one of his clients, Home Interiors and Gifts owner Don Carter. Negotiations with Eckardt fell through, but Carter remained interested in the enterprise as a gift to his wife Linda, who played basketball while at Duncanville High School. Simultaneously, Buffalo Braves president and general manager Norm Sonju developed an interest in bringing the NBA to Dallas as he studied possible new locations for the ailing franchise. While the Braves went to California as the San Diego Clippers, Sonju eventually returned to Texas. He was introduced to Carter by Mayor Robert Folsom, one of the owners and team president of the last professional basketball team in the city, the Dallas Chaparrals of the American Basketball Association, which moved to San Antonio in 1973 becoming the San Antonio Spurs. Sonju and Carter tried purchasing both the Milwaukee Bucks and the Kansas City Kings, but disagreement on relocation stalled the negotiations, leading them to instead aim for an expansion team. The league was initially reluctant to expand to Dallas, given Texas had both the Spurs and Houston Rockets. The 1978–79 season was proving unprofitable (18 out of the 22 teams lost money) and unpopular (television ratings fell 26 percent). Still, during the 1979 NBA All-Star Game weekend, NBA commissioner Larry O'Brien announced the league would add two new teams in the 1980–81 season, with teams in Dallas and Minneapolis. Once the potential Minnesota owners backed out, only Dallas remained. (The Minnesota Timberwolves would not join until 1989.) Through negotiations with general counselor and future commissioner David Stern, the expansion fee was settled on $12.5 million. Carter would provide half the amount.[10][11] At the 1980 NBA All-Star Game, league owners voted to admit the new team, with the team's name coming from the 1957–1962 TV western Maverick; the fans chose the title with 4,600 postcards received, beating Wranglers and Express.[12][13] James Garner, who played the title character, was a member of the ownership group.[14] The University of Texas at Arlington, who also uses the Mavericks nickname, had objections about a shared name but did not attempt any legal action.[15] They joined the Midwest Division of the Western Conference, where they would stay until the league went to six divisions for the 2004–05 season. Dick Motta, who had guided the Washington Bullets to the NBA Championship in 1977–78, was hired as the team's first head coach. The Mavs drafted Kiki VanDeWeghe of UCLA with the 11th pick of the 1980 NBA draft. Still, VanDeWeghe refused to play for the expansion Mavericks and staged a holdout that lasted a month into its inaugural season. VanDeWeghe was traded to the Denver Nuggets, along with a first-round pick, in 1981, in exchange for two future first-round picks that eventually materialized into Rolando Blackman in 1981, and Sam Vincent in 1985. In the Mavericks debut game, taking place in the brand-new Reunion Arena, the Mavericks defeated the Spurs, 103–92. But the Mavs started the season with a 6–40 record on their way to finishing 15–67. However, the Mavericks did make a player acquisition that, while it seemed minor at the time, turned out to play a significant role in the early years of their franchise. Journeyman 6 ft 3 in guard Brad Davis, who played for the Anchorage Northern Knights of the Continental Basketball Association, was tracked down and signed by the Mavericks in December after a scout watched a game with Davis. He had to be convinced to play for the team rather than attend to his studies at the University of Maryland (which he was funding by playing for Anchorage).[16] He would play for the remainder of the season after joining in December. Davis would spend the next twelve years with the Mavericks, and eventually, his number 15 jersey was retired. The Mavericks also marked the first NBA team to have a good debut season, with 7,789 spectators per game.[17] The 1981 NBA Draft brought three players who would become vital parts of the team. The Mavs selected forward Mark Aguirre with the first pick, guard Rolando Blackman ninth, and forward Jay Vincent at 24th. By the end of his seven-year Mavericks career, Aguirre would average 24.6 points per game. Blackman contributed 19.2 points over his 11-year career in Dallas. But it was Jay Vincent who made the most significant difference for the Mavs in their second season, leading the team in scoring with 21.4 points per game and earning NBA All-Rookie Team honors. The Mavericks improved to 28–54, getting out of the Midwest Division cellar as they finished above the Utah Jazz. In 1982–83, the Mavericks were serious contenders for the first time. At the All-Star break, they were 25–24 and had won 12 of their last 15 games. They could not sustain that momentum and finished seven games behind the Denver Nuggets for the sixth and final playoff spot in the Western Conference. But the Mavs' 38–44 record was a 10-game improvement from the previous season. Mark Aguirre led the 1982–83 Mavericks with 24.4 points per game, finishing sixth in the NBA. Jay Vincent and Rolando Blackman contributed 18.7 and 17.7 points per game, respectively. Brad Davis was 10th in the NBA in assists with 7.2 per game and shot .845 from the free-throw line, sixth in the league. The Mavs drafted Derek Harper with the 11th pick of the 1983 NBA draft. The 6 ft 4 in guard would spend the next decade with the organization, averaging 15 points and 6.1 assists. The Mavericks' in 1983–84 posted a winning record for the first time in franchise history, finishing 43–39 and second in the Midwest Division. The Mavs also earned the first playoff berth in franchise history. Mark Aguirre was named the team's first NBA All-Star, as he finished with an average of 29.5 points per game—second in the league to Utah's Adrian Dantley. Dallas finished with the fourth seed in the Western Conference playoffs, and in their first playoff trip, they defeated the Seattle SuperSonics in five games. The fifth and deciding game of that series was played at Moody Coliseum, as Reunion Arena, then the home court for the Mavericks was hosting a tennis tournament. The Magic Johnson-led Los Angeles Lakers, were next for the Mavs, and the young club fell short, losing four games to one. But a trade the Mavericks made in their inaugural season of 1980 paid off for them in 1984 because they owned Cleveland's first-round pick, which ended up being the fourth pick overall. The Mavs used it to select forward-center Sam Perkins, a former North Carolina Tar Heel, with a surprising range from the three-point line who would average 14.4 points and 8.0 rebounds in six seasons with Dallas. About this time, the Dallas Cowboys, once one of the NFL's elite teams, began a slow decline that eventually saw them fall to 1–15 in 1989. The Mavs were hitting their stride simultaneously and replaced the Cowboys as the Metroplex's most popular team. The 1984–85 team finished a game better than the previous year at 44–38. Mark Aguirre led the team in scoring again with 25.7 ppg, Sam Perkins made the All-Rookie team, and Rolando Blackman represented the Mavericks in the 1985 NBA All-Star Game. The Mavs returned to the playoffs in 1985 but were not as successful as they had been. They won Game 1 in double-overtime against the Portland Trail Blazers in their first-round playoff series, but lost the next three games in a row, ending their season. Dallas had the eighth pick in the 1985 NBA draft—again due to a trade with the Cavaliers—and drafted German-born forward Detlef Schrempf out of Washington. He would show flashes of brilliance in his three-plus seasons with the team, but it was not until he was traded to the Indiana Pacers that he displayed his full potential. The Mavericks also traded center Kurt Nimphius to the Los Angeles Clippers for center James Donaldson, who would play for the Mavericks until halfway through the 1991–92 season. This trade allowed the Mavericks to have a steady hand at the center position lacking throughout the franchise's first five years. In 1988, James Donaldson became the first Dallas Mavericks center in club history to be selected to play in the NBA All-Star Game. Rolando Blackman represented the Mavericks in the 1986 NBA All-Star Game, hosted by Dallas at Reunion Arena. The 1985–86 Mavericks were second in scoring at 115.3 points per game, gaining their third-straight playoff appearance. They defeated Utah three games to one in the first round. In the conference semi-finals, they ran into the Lakers again, and L.A. defeated Dallas in six games. But four of those games were decided by four points or fewer, and Dallas won half of those, leaving Mavericks fans room to hope that they could finally top the Lakers in the following season. The Mavs drafted Michigan center Roy Tarpley with the seventh overall pick, who would become a very talented—but troubled—member of the roster. The 1986–87 Mavericks team had their most successful regular season to date, going 55–27 and winning their first Midwest Division title. But despite the great expectations surrounding the team, they self-destructed in the playoffs. After hammering the Seattle SuperSonics by 22 points in Game 1, the bottom dropped out for the Mavs, as they lost Games 2 and 3 in close fashion before succumbing to Game 4 in Seattle. Following the unexpected early playoff exit, Motta, who had been with the team since its inception, shockingly resigned as head coach. John MacLeod, who had led the Phoenix Suns to nine playoff berths in 11 seasons, including an NBA Finals run in 1976, was hired as his replacement. The 1987–88 NBA season saw the Mavericks dip just a little bit in the regular season—finishing 53–29 and losing their Midwest Division title to the Denver Nuggets—but it was another successful year for the team. Mark Aguirre and James Donaldson both played in the 1988 NBA All-Star Game, the Mavericks rattled off a franchise-best 11-game winning streak, and Rolando Blackman scored his 10,000th career point. Aguirre led the team in scoring for the sixth consecutive year with 25.1 points per game, and Roy Tarpley won the NBA Sixth Man Award with averages of 13.5 points and 11.8 rebounds. The season saw the Mavs' deepest playoff run to date. They dispatched the Houston Rockets in four games and the Nuggets in six, leaving only the defending NBA Champion Lakers between them and their first-ever trip to the NBA Finals. The Mavericks gave the Lakers everything they could handle. Still, in the end, the more experienced Lakers prevailed, defeating Dallas in seven games on the way to eventually winning their second consecutive NBA Championship. Despite all the changes, the Mavs remained in contention. However, their season effectively ended when James Donaldson went down with a ruptured patella tendon on March 10, 1989, and missed the rest of the season. The Mavericks were left understaffed, demoralized, and disheartened as they finished with a 38–44 record. It was their first losing season since 1982–83—which was also the last time they missed the playoffs. The Mavericks returned to the playoffs in 1989–90 with a 47–35 record, but it was another season of off-court chaos. On November 15, only six games into the Mavs' season, Tarpley was arrested for driving while intoxicated and resisting arrest. The team started 5–6, and MacLeod was fired, replaced by assistant coach Richie Adubato. The Mavs finished the season with four straight victories to surge into the playoffs but went down rather meekly to the Portland Trail Blazers in three games. It would be the team's last winning season and playoff appearance until 2001. The team endured numerous changes in 1990, losing Sam Perkins to the Lakers via free agency and suffering injuries to practically their entire 1990–91 starting lineup. The players they managed to acquire—Rodney McCray, Fat Lever, and Alex English—were all in the twilight of their careers. On November 9, it was announced that Fat Lever would have season-ending surgery on his right knee, and that very night, Tarpley suffered a knee injury of his own, which ended his season. The Mavericks' season only got worse from there, and they finished with a record of 28–54, falling behind even the second-year Minnesota Timberwolves and Orlando Magic. In March 1991, Tarpley was charged with suspicion of driving while intoxicated and was suspended again by the NBA. It got even worse in 1991–92. Before the season even began, Tarpley violated the league's substance abuse policy for the third time and was banned from the NBA for life. The former Sixth Man Award winner's fall from grace was complete. The few talented players the Mavericks had remaining to them were lost to injury. Brad Davis' back problems forced him to retire in mid-January, and Fat Lever had knee surgery again on January 29, missing the remainder of the season—hardly worth the cost of losing two first-round draft picks. The team finished with a 22–60 record. In 1992–93, the rebuilding began in earnest, with the Mavs trading Rolando Blackman—who by that point had surpassed Mark Aguirre as the team's all-time leading scorer—to the New York Knicks for a first-round draft pick. Blackman had made four All-Star Game appearances in his Mavericks career. Herb Williams joined the Knicks as a free agent. Fat Lever underwent more surgery and missed the entire 1992–93 season. Derek Harper was the team's only bright spot, leading the team with 18.3 points per game. The Mavericks selected Ohio State guard Jim Jackson with the fourth overall pick of the 1992 NBA draft, but he and owner Donald Carter could not come to terms on a contract for half of his rookie season. Jackson only played 28 games in 1992–93, a season also ruined by trades, a coaching change, and injuries. The Mavericks started 2–27 and fired Adubato on January 13, replacing him with Gar Heard. The Mavericks came dangerously close to setting the all-time worst record in NBA history (at the time, 9–73 by the 1972–73 Philadelphia 76ers). But when Jackson was signed on March 3, the Mavs rallied, closing the season with a 7–14 mark, including two straight wins to end the season and finishing 11–71, the second-worst record in NBA history. Dallas selected Kentucky forward Jamal Mashburn with the fourth overall pick of the 1993 NBA draft and hired Quinn Buckner as head coach. Buckner decided from the start to be a disciplinarian on the model of his college coach, Bobby Knight, who told Buckner that the only way he would succeed with the Mavs would be to run the team with an iron hand.[18] The mostly young roster did not respond very well to Buckner's stern coaching style and started 1–23. By the end of January, they were 3–40, and it was once again possible that they could tie the 1973 Sixers for the all-time worst record in the league. But 5–9 records in February and April, coupled with Buckner loosening the reins a little bit, helped the Mavs finish 13–69. It was still the worst record in the league by far, but the Mavericks again avoided setting an all-time futility record. However, they did tie the NBA's single-season record for consecutive losses at 20 games (since broken). Buckner was fired at the end of the season despite having a five-year contract. However, Carter decided that Buckner had \"burned too many bridges\" due to his autocratic coaching style.[18] He compiled the worst record for a rookie NBA head coach, a record that only lasted four years until Bill Hanzlik broke it with the Denver Nuggets. The Mavericks brought back Dick Motta, who had led the franchise to some of its most successful seasons. The Mavericks also wound up with the number two pick in the 1994 NBA draft and picked up Cal point guard Jason Kidd, giving them a solid tandem of Jackson, Mashburn, and Kidd, known as \"The Three Js.\" The addition of Jason Kidd infused the Mavericks with new life in 1994–95. Kidd averaged 11.7 points, 5.4 rebounds, and 7.7 assists in his rookie season and led the league in triple-doubles. Roy Tarpley was allowed to return to the league after three years and helped with 12.6 points and 8.2 rebounds per game. The tandem of Jim Jackson and Jamal Mashburn combined as the league's highest-scoring pair of teammates. On separate occasions, Mashburn and Jackson scored 50 points in a game that season. Mashburn contributed 24.1 points per game, fifth in the NBA; Jackson averaged 25.7 points but suffered a severe ankle sprain in February, which caused him to miss the regular season's remainder. Second-year forward Popeye Jones had a great year as well, as he averaged 10.6 rebounds and led the NBA in offensive rebounds. The Mavericks' improvement was dramatic. The team jumped to 36–46, 10th in the Western Conference, and only five games behind the Denver Nuggets for the eighth and final playoff spot. It was the most significant one-year improvement in the team's history and the highest in the NBA. Many[who?] expected the Mavericks' improvement to continue with the franchise's first foray into the NBA playoffs since 1990. But despite a 4–0 start, the 1995–96 season was a disappointment about every conceivable way.[according to whom?] For the second time in his career, Roy Tarpley was given a lifelong ban from the NBA for repeated violations of the anti-drug policy—he never played in the NBA again. Jamal Mashburn had season-ending surgery to repair his sore right knee, only 18 games into the Mavericks' schedule. The team's two remaining stars, Jason Kidd and Jim Jackson bickered throughout the season, though neither of them had trouble establishing his stardom. Jackson led the team scoring with 19.6 ppg, made 121 three-pointers, and was the only Mav to start 82 games. Kidd became the first Maverick to be elected a starter in the NBA All-Star Game and finished second in the league in assists and fourth in steals while averaging 16.6 ppg. George McCloud, who averaged 9.6 ppg in his previous year, blew away his career-high scoring average as the Mavs resorted to the outside shot time and again due to their lack of an inside scoring threat. McCloud averaged 18.9 ppg and made 257 three-pointers, equaling the second-highest individual season total in league history. Overall, the Mavericks connected on 735 of their 2,039 three-point attempts, both new league records. The Mavs finished 26–56, fifth in the Midwest Division, and 33 games out of first place. Motta was relieved of his head coaching responsibilities at season's end and replaced by former Bulls assistant coach Jim Cleamons. And Don Carter, the only owner the Mavericks had ever had, sold the team to a group of investors led by H. Ross Perot, Jr. The 1996–97 season was a year of transition for the Mavericks as they re-designed their entire team; 27 different players saw action for that Dallas team, setting an all-time NBA record. By the time the season was over only rookie forward, Samaki Walker, had remained from the opening-day roster. The first big move came in December, as Jason Kidd, Loren Meyer, and Tony Dumas were traded to the Phoenix Suns for guards Michael Finley and Sam Cassell and forward A.C. Green. Cassell would play just one season while Green played three, but Finley, who, after his first half-season in Dallas, went on to average over or near twenty points per game for at least the next seven years of his Mavericks career. He made two visits to the NBA All-Star Game and played in each of the Mavericks games until the 2004–05 season.[19] Don Nelson was hired as Dallas' general manager on February 7. Within a week of his hiring, the Mavericks had released Fred Roberts and Oliver Miller. They then traded Jamal Mashburn to the Miami Heat for forwards Kurt Thomas and Martin Müürsepp and guard Sasha Danilović. Thomas did not play in 1996–97 and only ended up playing in five games as a Maverick before signing as a free agent with the New York Knicks. Danilović played in 13 games for the Mavericks before opting out of his contract and signing with Bucker Bologna. Müürsepp played in 73 games for the Mavericks over the next two years before leaving the NBA. Chris Gatling was the Mavericks' sole representative in the NBA All-Star Game, but he did not last much longer in Dallas. In one of the most massive two-team trades in NBA history, the Mavericks traded Gatling, Jim Jackson, Sam Cassell, George McCloud, and Eric Montross to the New Jersey Nets for 7 ft 6 in center Shawn Bradley, forward Ed O'Bannon, and guards Khalid Reeves and Robert Pack. Nelson claimed the trades were necessary because the situation in the locker room was unacceptable. However, whereas Cassell became a consistent floor leader, and Jackson, Gatling and, McCloud all continued to be substantial contributors to their teams for several more years, only Bradley lasted any time in Dallas. He would spend part of the next eight years putting up modest contributions for Dallas and giving them substantial numbers in blocked shots. Undrafted rookie guard Erick Strickland averaged 10.6 ppg. Along with Finley and Bradley, he was expected to be the core of this new Mavericks team. The constant changes made it impossible to establish any team chemistry in 1996–97, and the Mavericks finished 24–58. But they had acquired some of the pieces that would help them start to turn things around in years to come. In 1997–98, despite a poor record of 20–62, Dallas had a knack for giving some of the NBA's elite teams a hard time to beat the Seattle SuperSonics, New York Knicks, Indiana Pacers, and Chicago Bulls. Against the Bulls, Dallas went on a 17–2 run to force overtime, where they won 104–97. Midway through that season, Nelson fired Cleamons and named himself head coach. In the lockout-shortened 1998–99 season, the Mavericks finished with a lowly 19–31 record, but Michael Finley and Gary Trent put up substantial numbers and led their team to their first winning home record (15–10) since 1989–90. Notable were the acquisitions of power forward Dirk Nowitzki and point guard Steve Nash, two seemingly unspectacular moves that would significantly impact the future. In the following season, the team finally \"clicked\" and started to win consistently. Led by Finley, the Mavericks earned their first 40-win season since 1989–90. He was much helped by Nowitzki, who finally \"arrived\" in the NBA and established himself as a potent offensive threat. On January 14, 2000, Ross Perot's group sold the Dallas Mavericks to Internet entrepreneur and season ticket-holder Mark Cuban for $285 million. Cuban immediately set out to revitalize the Mavericks and increase the team's popularity in Dallas and nationwide. His controversial moves (he allowed Dennis Rodman to live in his house for a week before temporarily signing him) and outspoken personality quickly made him a fan favorite in Dallas. They garnered the team much press in the national media. He has also been fined millions of dollars for violating NBA rules.[20] In 2000–01, the Mavericks improved further and finished with a 53–29 record fueled by Nowitzki, Finley, and Nash's offensive triangle. The Mavs made a trade minutes before the trade deadline that sent Hubert Davis, Christian Laettner, Courtney Alexander, Loy Vaught, and Etan Thomas to the Washington Wizards for Juwan Howard, Calvin Booth, and Obinna Ekezie. This move brought in fresh blood that secured the club's first playoff visit in 11 years. Also, Wang Zhizhi became the first Chinese player to play in the NBA, signing with the Mavs in January, along with Eduardo Nájera, bringing Dallas an international cast that included Canada's Nash and Germany's Nowitzki. Nowitzki was named to the All NBA Third Team, becoming the first Maverick receive an All NBA honor. In the playoffs, the Mavericks won in the first round against the Utah Jazz. They advanced to the second round for the first time since 1988. Even though the San Antonio Spurs eliminated them in five games, it marked a sense of optimism for Dallas in earnestly contending for an NBA title. This season was also the last in the old Reunion Arena before moving to the modern American Airlines Center. The 2001–02 season was an excellent season for the Mavericks, with a 57–25 record and many sellout crowds. This season also saw a change in logo and colors, changing from the cowboy hat logo and green to a new horse logo and blue, almost on the same colors of fellow Dallas-based team, the Cowboys. Also, the team gained sleeker uniforms. Another blockbuster trade sent Juwan Howard, Tim Hardaway, and Donnell Harvey to the Denver Nuggets in exchange for Raef LaFrentz, Nick Van Exel, Tariq Abdul-Wahad, and Avery Johnson. The Mavericks also made several attempts to sign the Utah Jazz's star Karl Malone. The Mavericks swept the Kevin Garnett-led Minnesota Timberwolves in the 2002 playoffs but lost again in the second round to the Chris Webber-led Sacramento Kings. But it was only in the next season that the Mavericks finally broke through. The team started the 2002–03 season with a 14–0 record, which was one win shy of tying the NBA record set by the 1993–94 Houston Rockets (15–0). The Mavericks finished with a 60–22 record in the regular season, impressing fans and critics with their sparkling offense. Since acquiring the \"Big Three\" of Nowitzki, Finley, and Nash, the Mavericks were a Western Conference power in waiting.[21] Finally, they led the team to the conference finals against the San Antonio Spurs. However, with the series tied 1–1, Dirk Nowitzki, the team's leading scorer, suffered a knee injury in game three that kept him out. This injury further worsened the Mavs' front-court depth problems (both of their backup centers were injured for the entire series), and the Spurs took the series in 6 games. In 2003–04, two blockbuster trades were announced. The Mavericks acquired Antawn Jamison, Danny Fortson, Jiří Welsch, and Chris Mills from Golden State in exchange for Nick Van Exel, Evan Eschmeyer, Popeye Jones, Avery Johnson, and Antoine Rigaudeau. Another high-profile trade sent Raef LaFrentz, Chris Mills, and Jiří Welsch to Boston for Antoine Walker and Tony Delk. Although the team struggled with chemistry, the Mavericks comfortably qualified for the playoffs. With the trio Nowitzki-Finley-Nash and NBA Sixth Man of the Year Jamison, the Mavericks continued their reputation as the NBA's best offensive team. Notable were two rookies, Josh Howard and Marquis Daniels, who made an immediate impact. However, the Mavericks were eliminated quickly in the 2004 playoffs, losing in the first round to the Chris Webber-led Sacramento Kings, a better defensive team. The Mavericks management had to re-evaluate their strategy. The 2004–05 season saw trades which (among others) brought in robust center Erick Dampier, combo guard Jason Terry, speedy rookie point guard Devin Harris, scoring machine Jerry Stackhouse, and defensive stalwart Alan Henderson. Although the loss of All-Star Steve Nash via free agency visibly hurt the Mavericks' offense, the new acquisitions strengthened the team defense. The run-and-gun style of former times changed into a more balanced style of play. At the All-Star break, the Mavericks acquired Keith Van Horn for Calvin Booth and Henderson, the latter resigning only days later. Nowitzki added his third consecutive Euroscar during this season as well. On March 19, longtime coach Don Nelson stepped down, and his assistant Avery Johnson succeeded him. Under Johnson's tutelage, the Mavericks' defense became more vigorous, and they quickly qualified for the 2005 playoffs with an impressive 58–24 record. The Mavericks defeated the Houston Rockets in Round 1 of the playoffs in 7 games but then lost to the Phoenix Suns 4–2, led by former Maverick star Steve Nash. Before the 2005 NBA draft, the Mavericks had traded all their picks away and were left empty-handed. On August 15, 2005, veteran guard Michael Finley was waived under the new \"Allan Houston Rule.\"[22] Under that rule, the Orlando Magic waived Doug Christie, who then signed with the Mavericks. On August 19, the Mavericks held a press conference announcing they had re-signed Darrell Armstrong and introduced Christie, DeSagana Diop, Rawle Marshall, and Josh Powell as new Mavericks. Christie's playing time was minimal amid a surgically repaired ankle still hampering his play. He was waived on November 25, 2005. At the end of calendar 2005, Nowitzki achieved a rare double by winning both the Euroscar and Mr. Europa, a second prestigious award for the top European player. He additionally was named the inaugural FIBA Europe Player of the Year. Up until the very end of the season, the Mavericks were toe-to-toe with the San Antonio Spurs for the crown of the Southwest Division and the #1 spot in the Western Conference. However, they fell short of the title and had to settle for a fourth seed. Nonetheless, they once again achieved a 60–22 record, with Avery Johnson winning NBA Coach of the Year honors. They swept the Memphis Grizzlies in the 2006 playoffs, leading to a titanic series against their state rivals and the reigning NBA champions the San Antonio Spurs. Five out of the seven games were decided in the last minute, including a Game 7 that had to go into overtime, with the Mavs prevailing under the guidance of Dirk Nowitzki and an incredibly deep bench. The Mavericks were able to advance to the conference finals against former teammate Steve Nash and the Phoenix Suns. The Mavs' defense and depth enabled them to take the series as they defeated the Phoenix Suns in game 6 of the Western Conference finals on June 3, 2006, in the US Airways Center in Phoenix, and the Mavs advanced to their first NBA Finals in franchise history. In the NBA Finals, the Mavericks faced the Miami Heat, held the home-court advantage, and scored two convincing wins. After game 2, Dallas city officials had already planned the victory parade. However, in Game 3, the Mavs blew a late double-digit lead, courtesy of Heat guard Dwyane Wade. He carried the Heat to the win, with Nowitzki missing a potentially game-tying free throw in the last seconds. After getting blown out in Game 4, the Mavericks suffered another loss in Game 5 when Wade scored the game-tying basket in the final possession of regular time, putting the Heat ahead with last-second free throws in overtime. The tragic figure was Josh Howard, who missed a pair of clutch free throws in overtime and mistakenly called an early timeout, so the Mavs had to bring in the ball at backcourt rather than half-court for the last possession. In Game 6, the Mavericks took an early double-digit lead, but again, Wade poured in 36 points, helped by Alonzo Mourning's five blocked shots, and the Mavericks lost their fourth game and the title after a string of botched three-pointers. Many Mavericks fans were stunned by the defeat. Mavericks owner Mark Cuban was fined a total of $250,000 for \"several acts of misconduct\" during the series, and Nowitzki was fined $5,000 for kicking a ball into the stands after Game 5. Nowitzki was also caught by TV cameras attacking a stationary bicycle in the hallway outside of the Mavericks locker room. Jerry Stackhouse was suspended for Game 5 after fouling Shaquille O'Neal on a breakaway dunk attempt. The latter marked the third time a Mavericks player was suspended in the 2006 playoffs. The Mavericks became only the third team in NBA history (the first since 1977) to lose in the finals after taking a 2–0 lead. In Game 3, the Mavs held a 13-point lead under seven minutes remaining but were outscored 22–7 in the momentum-changing 98–96 defeat. The Heat's performance in the last seven minutes represented the team's most remarkable postseason comeback in team history.[23] After an end to their playoff run in 2006, the Mavericks sought retribution in the new season. After a 0–4 start, the Mavericks went on a historic run and posted a 52–5 record over their next 57 games. They finished the regular season with a record of 67–15, good enough to be tied for sixth place all-time, first in the league, and the number 1 seed in the Western Conference playoffs. Dirk Nowitzki had a dominant season, further cementing his place as one of the game's elite players; he won his fifth consecutive Euroscar during the season and was named the NBA MVP at its end. Josh Howard was named to the all-star team. However, the first-place Mavericks were defeated in six games by the eighth-seeded Golden State Warriors. This outcome is regarded as one of the biggest upsets in NBA history.[24] The Mavs were exposed defensively, and the Warriors systematically dismantled the Mavericks by exploiting match-ups and preying on Dirk Nowitzki's weaknesses. The Mavericks went 67–12 against the rest of the league and 0–3 against Golden State on the year. The Warriors were coached by Don Nelson, the immediate past manager and coach of the Mavericks. He had been appointed head coach of the Warriors in the 2006–07 mid-season. Nowitzki's winning of regular season MVP honors and his team's first-round exit created an awkward dilemma regarding the MVP trophy ceremony. Traditionally, MVP awards are given to the winner in a ceremony between the first and second rounds of the playoffs. It is believed[25] that the league opted to put some distance between the MVP presentation and the Mavericks' elimination against the Warriors. By the time Nowitzki collected his MVP award, nearly two weeks had elapsed since the Mavs were ousted. The Mavericks dealt Devin Harris, two first-round picks, and others to the New Jersey Nets for veteran all-star Jason Kidd and other role players; Cuban also tried to acquire Kevin Garnett without success. The Mavericks were 3–11 against winning teams since the trade and lost Nowitzki for a little over a week due to a high ankle sprain injury. He returned April 2 in a crucial game against the Golden State Warriors in a 111–86 Mavericks victory and helped defeat the Phoenix Suns in a 105–98 win on April 6. Dallas' win in Phoenix was especially significant because the Mavs had been nearly unable to defeat a contending team on the road the entire season. Continuing their playoff push, Dirk hit a crucial three-pointer with 0.9 seconds left, beating the Utah Jazz 97–94 on April 10. This victory guaranteed them a playoff spot and their eighth consecutive 50-win season. The Mavericks ended the season with a record of 51–31. In the first round of the playoffs, the Mavericks were eliminated by the New Orleans Hornets 4–1 on the road, 99–94. Just one day after a disappointing season ended, Avery Johnson was dismissed as head coach of the Dallas Mavericks. On May 9, 2008, Rick Carlisle was hired as the head coach.[26][27][28][29][30] After getting off to 2–7 start, the Mavericks eventually found themselves with the sixth spot in the Western Conference playoff bracket for 2009 after going 50–32 (ninth consecutive 50+-win season). About three to four weeks earlier, they were not even sure if they would make the eighth and final spot. But a run of 5–1 in their last six regular season games got them to a game over the Hornets for sixth place. Dirk Nowitzki also entered the postseason with a streak of twenty-five consecutive games of scoring 20 or more points, which was ended in the first game of the quarterfinals series versus the arch-rival, San Antonio Spurs. The Mavericks surprised many people by winning Game 1, 106–97 in San Antonio.[31] The Spurs quickly won game two in a rout. As the series shifted to Dallas, who had only lost one game there after the All-Star Break, won both Games 3 and 4. San Antonio was trying to win Game 5 to extend the series, but they could not do it as the Mavericks closed out the series with a 13-point-victory, 106–93. With the Victory, the Mavericks advanced to the Conference semi-finals for the first time since 2006. They faced the two-seeded Denver Nuggets in the semi-finals, who were fresh off a 4–1 series win against the New Orleans Hornets, including a 58-point win in New Orleans. The Mavericks stayed close with the Nuggets in the first three-quarters of Games 1 and 2, but it was the fourth quarter when Carmelo Anthony and the Nuggets woke up, as they took the first two games by double-digit figures. Game 3 in Dallas was close the whole way, and Dallas led by five points with less than a minute to go. But Carmelo Anthony hit a three-pointer to give the Nuggets a 106–105 victory. The play generated quite a bit of controversy because Maverick guard Antoine Wright fouled Anthony, but since there was no replay used in the NBA in 2009, the Mavericks suffered a Game 3 loss. The league later announced that the referees made the wrong call,[32] but despite that, the Mavericks still faced a 3–0 deficit in the series. Nowitzki's 44 points in Game 4 saved the Mavericks season, sending the series back to Denver for a Game 5, with the series in Denver's favor, 3–1. Game 5 would prove to be the final game for the Mavericks of the 2009 season, as a score of 124–110 would oust them. The elimination led to an off-season facing many questions about the future construction of the team. After a disappointing loss to the Nuggets in the playoffs, the Mavericks entered the off-season with many questions about the team's future construction. They began by re-signing Jason Kidd to a three-year contract extension, which took care of their pending point guard issue. The Mavericks also made a transaction to compound their age problem by trading for All-Star small forward Shawn Marion. In a three-team deal with the Grizzlies and Raptors, the Mavericks sent swingman Antoine Wright and defensive stalwart Devean George to Toronto, while aging guard Jerry Stackhouse landed in Memphis. Dallas also acquired athletic center Nathan Jawai and power forward Kris Humphries. Many analysts viewed this as a beneficial trade for the Mavericks, given that it countered their age issues while also providing them with more depth on the bench.[33] The Mavericks also added veteran forwards Tim Thomas, Drew Gooden, and Quinton Ross. These moves proved successful because after dropping the season opener to the Wizards, the Mavericks beat many contenders such as the Los Angeles Lakers, San Antonio Spurs, Houston Rockets, and the Phoenix Suns. A day before the trade deadline, the Mavericks instigated a deal. The trade sent Josh Howard, James Singleton, and Drew Gooden to the Washington Wizards in exchange for Caron Butler, Brendan Haywood, and Deshawn Stevenson. The Mavericks felt that this trade was necessary due to Howard's declining performance and apparent unhappiness with the Mavericks organization. Some NBA analysts thought that this was a good move, because not only did it remove a disgruntled Howard from the line-up, it simultaneously brought Dirk Nowitzki a quality supporting cast. Many believed that the Mavs could contend for a title after the trade went through.[34][35] The trade worked because the new-look Mavericks came out of the all-star break with a vengeance. On January 24, 2010, the Dallas Mavericks routed The New York Knicks 128–78. This win was the third-largest margin of victory in NBA history. The previous largest margin of victory for the Mavericks was 45 points. After dropping the second-half opener to the Oklahoma City Thunder, the Mavericks went on to win 13-straight games before losing to the New York Knicks. On April 10, the Mavericks clinched the Southwest division after defeating the Portland Trail Blazers 83–77. The Mavericks finished the season with a 55–27 record, good enough for the Western Conference's second seed. The Mavericks then entered the postseason with quite a bit of optimism and an assurance that they could earnestly contend for a title. During the playoffs, though, this optimism proved to be short-lived. After winning game one 100–94, behind Nowitzki's 36-point performance, the Mavericks dropped the next three games to their in-state rivals, the San Antonio Spurs, before winning game five. Dallas would eventually lose against San Antonio in six games 97–87, leading to yet another off-season full of speculation, mostly centering on franchise player Dirk Nowitzki's pending free agent status. After yet another first-round exit, the Mavericks began an unexpectedly early off-season. The first order of business for Mark Cuban and the Mavericks[36] was to re-sign Dirk Nowitzki, and they did so on July 4, 2010, when the Mavericks and Nowitzki agreed to a four-year deal worth $80 million. On July 13, the Mavericks, after losing the opportunity to sign LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, or Amar'e Stoudemire, acquired centers Tyson Chandler and Alexis Ajinça from the Charlotte Bobcats for center Erick Dampier, forward Eduardo Nájera, and guard Matt Carroll. USA Today called this trade one of the most lopsided trades in NBA history, saying Chandler \"was the perfect fit during his first season with the Mavericks, anchoring their defense on the way to the franchise's first championship.\"[37] The 2010–11 campaign saw the Mavericks fly out of the gate, winning 24 out of their first 29 games. However, on December 27, Dirk Nowitzki sustained a knee injury that derailed the Mavericks' momentum. The team's second-leading scorer Caron Butler suffered a season-ending knee injury himself only four nights later. The Mavericks then went on to drop seven of their next nine games, causing serious concern as to who would lead the offense in Nowitzki's absence. However, this injury would prove to only be a temporary setback because Nowitzki only missed nine games and admittedly rushed back to assist the Mavericks' reeling offense. Consequently, they quickly returned to their winning ways. The Mavericks re-invented their defensive reputation around the league during the 2010–11 campaign, mostly in part to off-season acquisition Tyson Chandler (who was later named to the All-Defensive Second Team).[38] The Mavericks battled the San Antonio Spurs all season long for the division title, but instead settled for the third seed, with a 57–25 record. The Mavericks had a lousy reputation of struggling during the playoffs; many predicted them to be eliminated in the first round against the six-seeded Portland Trail Blazers.[39] Yahoo! Sports analyst Adrian Wojnarowski even went so far as to predict a sweep for the Trail Blazers. The Mavs won Games 1 and 2 on their home floor in convincing fashion. However, upon their arrival at the Rose Garden in Portland, problems began to arise. After dropping game three to Portland, the Mavericks blew a 23-point fourth-quarter lead in game four to allow Portland to tie the series at two games apiece. The whispers then began to re-surface that the Mavericks would let another impressive regular season go down the drain.[40] The Mavericks then responded, posting back-to-back wins to oust the Blazers in six games. They then met the two-time defending champion Los Angeles Lakers in the Western Conference Semi-finals. This series would be the first and only time that Kobe Bryant met Dirk Nowitzki in a playoff series and was expected to be extremely competitive; however, it did not prove the case. The Mavericks shocked the NBA world by winning the first two games in Los Angeles, heading back to Dallas. They then won a thrilling game three in Dallas, courtesy of 32 points from Nowitzki in a 98–92 victory. The Mavericks then provided the perfect \"exclamation point\"[41] crushing the Lakers in Game 4 by a final score of 122–86. In that game, Jason Terry set an NBA playoff record with nine three-pointers with just one miss, ousting the Lakers in a four-game sweep. The Mavericks then met the upstart Oklahoma City Thunder in the Western Conference finals. Dirk Nowitzki set the tone in the series in game one with a 48-point performance, with the Mavericks taking Game 1 by a score of 121–112. The Thunder then responded with 106–100 victory in Game 2. The Mavericks then won the next three games, including a 15-point comeback in Game 4, to take the five-game series. The Mavericks claimed their second Western Conference Championship in franchise history and met the team that defeated them in the 2006 NBA Finals, the Miami Heat. The Mavericks entered the 2011 NBA Finals as underdogs, due to Miami's Big Three coming together at the start of the season. After dropping Game 1 in Miami by a score of 92–84, the Mavs needed more than just Nowitzki to score, with Nowitzki even calling out teammate Jason Terry earlier in the playoffs. In the fourth quarter of Game 2, with the Mavericks trailing 88–73, Dallas was desperate to avoid a 0–2 heading back home. Dallas then staged a comeback, going on a 22–5 run to end the game, stunned the Heat with a game two victory, and evened the series at one game apiece. After the series shifted back to Dallas, the Mavericks lost in Game 3, with Nowitzki narrowly missing the potential game-tying shot, by a final score of 88–86. Dallas yet again showed their resiliency, winning a pivotal Game 4 with Nowitzki hitting multiple big shots down the stretch to tie the series at two. Game 5 was a bit of an offensive showcase, with both teams breaking 100 points for the first time in the series. Jason Kidd and Jason Terry both hit huge shots down the stretch, and the Mavericks defeated the Heat 112–103, putting them one game from their first-ever NBA title. Three nights later, the Mavericks captured their first-ever NBA title with a 105–95 victory, completely reversing what had happened in the 2006 NBA Finals. Nowitzki scored 21, including 18 in the second half, and Terry provided 27 points off the Dallas bench. Nowitzki was so emotional after the game that he headed to the locker room before the game had concluded, and had to be coaxed back onto the floor for the NBA Championship trophy presentation. Nowitzki took home the NBA Finals MVP honors after averaging 26 points a game during the series, shedding the Mavericks label as \"soft\" and putting an end to the Mavericks' postseason futility. The 2011–12 season was shortened to 66 games due to a lockout, which meant the Mavericks had to wait until Christmas Day to raise their first championship banner. During the brief off-season, owner Mark Cuban decided to maintain financial flexibility by letting Tyson Chandler, DeShawn Stevenson, J.J. Barea, and Caron Butler go. Chandler signed with the New York Knicks, Stevenson joined the New Jersey Nets, Barea went to the Minnesota Timberwolves, and Butler joined the Los Angeles Clippers. Meanwhile, they acquired incumbent Sixth Man of the Year Lamar Odom via a trade with the Lakers, while signing veterans Vince Carter and Delonte West. The Mavericks raised their championship banner before their Finals rematch with the Heat on Christmas Day. Still, in what would soon become a mirror image of the 2006–07 Heat's eventual failed title defense, Miami blew them out in a 105–94 loss, marking Dallas's first regular season loss to Miami in eight seasons. Things did not get better for Dallas after starting the season 0–3, losing to the Thunder in a playoff rematch on December 29. As the calendar turned to 2012, the Mavericks won 14 of 18 games in January, but they posted a 22–22 record the rest of the way, eventually finishing seventh with a 36–30 record, their lowest finish since the 2007–08 season. Nowitzki produced 21.6 points, 6 rebounds, and 45.7% shooting, his most insufficient numbers since the 2000–01 season. Meanwhile, Odom, who proved to be a bad fit for the Mavericks, was deactivated for the final two months of the season. In a rematch from the previous year, the Mavericks faced the Oklahoma City Thunder in the first round of the 2012 NBA playoffs. Games 1 and 2 went down to the wire, but the Mavericks fell short on both occasions as Kevin Durant made a game-winning jumper in Game 1, and late-game free throws in Game 2. Back in Dallas for Game 3, the Mavericks suffered a 95–79 defeat to fall behind 0–3. In Game 4, the Mavericks led for much of the second half, but James Harden's 15-point fourth-quarter rallied the Thunder to a 103–97 win to eliminate the defending champions. It marked the first time Dallas was swept in a seven-game series. They became the third defending champion to be swept in the first round after the aforementioned 2006–07 Heat and the 1956–57 Philadelphia Warriors. During the 2012 off-season, the Mavericks lost both Jason Kidd and Jason Terry to free agency. Kidd signed with the New York Knicks, while Terry joined the Boston Celtics. Brendan Haywood was later amnestied before moving to the Charlotte Bobcats. The Mavericks acquired Darren Collison from the Indiana Pacers and signed O. J. Mayo from the Memphis Grizzlies. Also joining the team were former All-Stars Chris Kaman and Elton Brand. The 2012–13 season was a struggle for the Mavericks, as Nowitzki recovered from knee surgery and missed 29 games. Also, Collison was inexperienced at the point, leading the Mavericks to sign veteran Derek Fisher for nine games,[42] before settling on Mike James. Mayo was the team's leading scorer for the first two months of the season before Nowitzki's return saw his averages dip. Injuries also hounded Kaman and Brand. The Mavericks were 23–29 at the All-Star break, before making a late push for a playoff berth. Still, it did not save their season, and the Mavericks missed the playoffs for the first time since 2000. During the 2013 off-season, the Mavericks chose not to re-sign role players Collison, Brand, and Kaman. Mayo then declined to exercise his player option and later signed with the Milwaukee Bucks. The Mavericks signed José Calderón from the Detroit Pistons and Monta Ellis from the Bucks. They also signed veteran Samuel Dalembert. On April 4, 2014, the Mavericks swept the season series with the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time since the 1980–81 season with a 107–95 win.[43] The Mavericks finished 49–33, one game ahead of Phoenix for the eighth and final playoff spot, which meant that they would once again have to face their in-state rivals, the San Antonio Spurs, the top seed in the Western Conference with a 62–20 record. In Game 1 in San Antonio, Dallas had an 81–71 lead in the fourth quarter, but the Spurs rallied back and took Game 1, 85–90. However, the Mavs forced 22 turnovers in Game 2 to rout the Spurs 113–92, splitting the first two games before the series went to Dallas. In Game 3, Manu Ginóbili hit a shot that put the Spurs up 108–106 with 1.7 seconds left, but a buzzer-beater by Vince Carter gave the Mavs the victory, putting them up 2–1 in the series. The Spurs took Game 4 in Dallas 93–89 despite a late Dallas comeback, after the Spurs at one point had a 20-point lead and later won Game 5 at home, 109–103, giving them a 3–2 series lead. The Mavs avoided elimination in Game 6 at home by rallying in the fourth quarter, winning 111–113. Game 7 was on the Spurs home court, and the Spurs beat the Mavericks 119–96, putting an end to the Mavericks' season. In the 2014 off-season, the Mavericks made several moves, the first of which was trading for Tyson Chandler and Raymond Felton from the New York Knicks, sending Calderón, Dalembert, Shane Larkin, and Wayne Ellington as well as two-second-round draft picks, on June 26, 2014, right before the draft. Nowitzki also took a generous discount, re-signing for three years and $25 million, which helped Dallas sign restricted free agent Chandler Parsons from the Houston Rockets to a three-year contract at $46 million. Devin Harris was re-signed for four years and $16 million. Dallas brought in Richard Jefferson, Al-Farouq Aminu, Jameer Nelson, Greg Smith to build a deep bench. The Mavs' sixth man, Vince Carter, left in free agency to the Memphis Grizzlies. On November 13, 2014, the Mavericks recorded their largest victory ever with a 123–70 win over the Philadelphia 76ers. The 53-point margin for Dallas surpassed its 50-point win over the New York Knicks in January 2010.[44] Two days later, they scored 131 points to record their biggest point tally since 2009 in the win over the Minnesota Timberwolves.[45] On December 18, 2014, the Mavericks sent Jae Crowder, Jameer Nelson, Brandan Wright, a 2015 first-round pick and a 2016 second-round pick to the Boston Celtics for Rajon Rondo and Dwight Powell.[46] On April 28, 2015, the Mavericks were knocked out of the first round by their in-state rivals, the Houston Rockets, in a 4–1 series loss. After going down 3–0 in a Game 3 overtime, the Mavericks managed to win one on their homecourt before losing in Houston in the clinching game, 103–94. The Mavericks were the seventh seed in the playoffs and finished the season 50–32. On April 25, 2016, the Mavericks were once again knocked out of the first round, this time, by the Oklahoma City Thunder in a 4–1 series loss. After managing to win a game at OKC and tying the series 1–1, the Mavericks lost three straight to lose the series. This series was marked by both teams' physicality, including a Kevin Durant Flagrant 2 foul and several Mavericks playing very aggressive defense on Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant. The Mavericks did not make the playoffs during the 2016–17 season, despite efforts from their newest additions, Seth Curry, Harrison Barnes, Nerlens Noel, and Yogi Ferrell. They began the season going 3–15 through their first 18 games, and could not bounce back, finishing at a 33–49 record despite fighting towards a winning record, even reaching a 28–36 record partway through the season. This season was the second time in 17 years they missed the playoffs, with the other being the 2012–2013 season. The season marked the first time the team finished with a losing record since the 1999–2000 season. The Dallas Mavericks received the ninth pick in the 2017 NBA draft and used it to select point guard Dennis Smith Jr. out of North Carolina State. They began the 2017–18 season 3–15 through their first eighteen games as in the year prior and concluded it on a 2–12 slump to finish with a 24–58 record despite a solid rookie season from Smith Jr., who averaged 15.2 points, 3.8 rebounds, and 5.2 assists over 69 games, landing a spot on the All-Rookie Second Team. This season was the team's worst season since the 1997–98 season, in which they finished 20–62 and drafted Dirk Nowitzki afterward. In the 2018 NBA draft, Dallas traded for Luka Dončić, who was drafted third by the Atlanta Hawks.[47] Dallas traded their 2018 first-round pick, the fifth overall pick, and their 2019 first-round pick, the 10th overall pick. The two selections resulted in Trae Young and Cam Reddish, respectively.[48] Head coach Rick Carlisle described Dončić as \"a guy that we think is a franchise foundation piece.\"[49] On July 6, 2018, long-time Los Angeles Clippers center DeAndre Jordan (who had been with the Clippers since 2008), signed a one-year deal.[50][51] The Mavericks finished the season with a record of 33–49 and missed the playoffs despite Dončić winning Rookie of the Year.[52] Nowitzki announced his retirement at season's end; his 21st season with the Mavericks marked the longest that any NBA player in history spent with a single franchise. On January 31, 2019, the Mavericks sent Dennis Smith Jr., DeAndre Jordan, Wesley Matthews, and two future first-round draft picks to the New York Knicks in exchange for Kristaps Porziņģis, Tim Hardaway Jr., Courtney Lee, and Trey Burke.[53] At the quarter-mark of the 2019–20 season, the Mavericks began with a 15–6 record through their first 21 games. With Luka Dončić averaging a near 30-point triple-double, leading the Mavericks in points, rebounds, and assists and entering MVP contention, he led the Mavericks to the top-rated offense in the league.[54] On December 12, 2019, the Mavericks won against the Detroit Pistons in Mexico City, due to the NBA's efforts to expand internationally.[55] During that game, Luka Dončić tallied 41 points, 12 rebounds, and 11 assists, becoming the first player in NBA history to record multiple 40-point triple-doubles before turning 21-years-old. Dončić was later selected to his first NBA All-Star Game as a Western Conference starter.[56] Following the suspension of the 2019–20 NBA season, the Mavericks were one of the 22 teams invited to the NBA Bubble to participate in the regular season's final eight games. They resumed play on July 31, with a 153–149 loss against the Houston Rockets.[57] On August 2, after the Memphis Grizzlies lost against the San Antonio Spurs, the Mavericks clinched a spot in the 2020 NBA playoffs no worse than the seventh seed, marking their first trip since 2016.[58] Dončić was announced as one of the three finalists for the NBA Most Improved Player Award.[59] In the first round against the Los Angeles Clippers, which was the first time the two teams ever faced off in the playoffs, the Mavericks lost 4–2, despite historically great performances by Dončić.[60] Dončić later was selected to the All-NBA First Team. The 2020–21 season saw Dallas have players miss 41 games to COVID-19 protocols,[61] with Maxi Kleber, Jalen Brunson, Josh Richardson and Dorian Finney-Smith missing most of those 41 games. Additionally the start of the season saw forward Kristaps Porziņģis missing the first 9 games as he recovered from off-season meniscus surgery. At one point Dallas dropped to 14th in the Western conference largely in part due to missing key pieces of their rotation.[62] Despite this, Dallas improved on their previous season record and finished the season 42–30. The Mavericks clinched the Southwest division for the first time since the 2009–10 season following a 110–90 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers on May 7, 2021.[63] However the Mavericks lost in the first round to the Los Angeles Clippers for the second consecutive season in seven games.[64] Following the season on June 17, 2021, longtime head coach Rick Carlisle resigned from his position as head coach after 13 seasons.[65][66] The 2021–22 season would be the first season since 2004–05 without long-time general manager Donnie Nelson, as he announced his departure from the team on June 17, 2021, a day prior to Rick Carlisle's mutual parting with the team. Carlisle and Nelson were part of the Mavericks' 2010–11 championship squad, with Nelson being part of the 2005–06 team that made the 2006 NBA Finals.[67][68] On June 28, 2021, Jason Kidd, a player on the 2010–11 championship team, was hired as head coach of the team.[69] This marked the third time that Kidd was involved with the organization. Under Kidd, the Mavericks finished the 2021–22 season with a 52–30 record, which netted them the fourth seed in the Western Conference. The Mavericks won their first playoff series since their 2011 championship season by defeating the Utah Jazz, 4–2, in the first round of the 2022 NBA playoffs.[70] The Mavericks won two of the games with Dončić out due to injury. The Mavericks then faced the Phoenix Suns, who won a league-best 64 games in the regular season. After being down 3–2, Mavericks star Luka Dončić said, \"Everybody acts tough when they're up.\"[71] The Mavericks won the next two games to advance to their first Western Conference finals since 2011. In Game 7, the Mavericks beat the Suns by 33 points, and at one point they had a 46-point lead. During the 2022 Playoffs Jalen Brunson broke out as a star alongside Spencer Dinwiddie and Dončić, averaging 23 points in the first two series.[72] In their first Western Conference finals appearance since 2011 the Mavericks would ultimately fall to the eventual NBA champion-Golden State Warriors in 5 games.[73] On Draft Night in the 2022 NBA draft, The Mavericks traded for center Christian Wood sending the Houston Rockets a 2022 NBA draft pick ( Became Wendell Moore) as well as Boban Marjanovic, Sterling Brown, Trey Burke, and Marquese Chriss.[74] They also drafted guard Jaden Hardy with the 37th overall pick.[75] The Mavericks entered the 2022– 2023 season hoping to improve upon their WCF appearance, and traded for star guard Kyrie Irving at the 2023 trade deadline in exchange for Dorian Finney-Smith, Spencer Dinwiddie, a 2029 unprotected first-round draft pick and second-round picks in 2027 and 2029.[76] However, The Mavericks failed to click and failed to make the playoffs, intentionally losing the last few games by sitting their star players in order to keep the #10 overall pick instead of having it convey to the New York Knicks, who received the draft pick in the Kristaps Porzingis trade.[77] After Voyager Digital, a cryptocurrency lender, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in July 2022,[78] Mark Cuban and the Mavericks were named in a class-action lawsuit that alleged that Voyager Digital was a Ponzi scheme the following month due to Cuban's promotion of Voyager and Voyager's sponsorship with the team.[79][80] In February 2022, the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in a lawsuit against Bitconnect that the Securities Act of 1933 extends to targeted solicitation using social media.[81] With the 10th overall pick in the 2023 NBA draft, the Mavericks selected Cason Wallace who they immediately traded along with Davis Bertans to the Thunder for the 12th pick, Dereck Lively II.[82] The Mavericks also selected Olivier-Maxence Prosper with the 24th overall pick which they received through a salary dump of Richaun Holmes by the Sacramento Kings.[83] Before the February 8, 2024, trade deadline, the Mavericks traded for P.J. Washington and two future second–round picks from the Charlotte Hornets in exchange for Seth Curry, Grant Williams, and a 2027 first–round pick that is top 2 protected.[84] Daniel Gafford was also received from the Washington Wizards for Richaun Holmes and draft compensation.[84] The Mavericks finished the 2023–2024 regular season as Southwest Division champions and as the 5th seed in the West with a 50–32 record.[85] The Mavericks would face the Los Angeles Clippers in the first round of the 2024 NBA playoffs for the third time in five seasons, however this time the Mavs would avenge previous playoff defeats to the Clippers in 2020 and 2021 by winning the series 4–2.[86][87][88] They proceeded to then eliminate the one-seeded Oklahoma City Thunder in six games, winning the series-clinching Game 6 at home, 117–116.[89][90] The win allowed the Mavericks to advance to the Western Conference Finals for the second time in three years.[89] In the Western Conference Finals, the Mavericks defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves in five games to win their third Western Conference title in franchise history.[91] The Mavericks would go on to face the Boston Celtics in the 2024 NBA Finals, their first NBA Finals appearance since their 2011 victory. In those, the Mavericks lost in five games.[92][93] Their one win came from a 122–84 blowout, the third-largest blowout in NBA Finals history.[94] On July 6, 2024, Klay Thompson was traded to Mavericks in exchange for a 2025 second-round pick via a sign-and-trade.[95] The Mavericks also traded Hardaway Jr. to the Detroit Pistons for Quentin Grimes, while also acquiring Naji Marshall, Melvin Ajinça, and Spencer Dinwiddie.[96][97][98] During their expansion season of 1980–81, the Mavericks road uniform colors were royal blue with green and white trim, but the green and blue were reversed a year later, and green was the dominant road uniform color through 1992. However, in the 1992–93 season, they went back to their original road uniform scheme from their expansion season, with minor alterations to the \"Dallas\" script, a design that the Mavericks used until 2001. From 1980 to 2001, the home white uniforms had \"Mavericks\" in blue, with green and white trim, with a few minor alterations to the \"Mavericks\" script during the 1990s.[99] The 1980s green road jerseys were revived in the 2004–05 season as part of the Mavericks' 25th anniversary. However, while the lettering from the 1980s uniform was present, the number scheme resembled the 1993–2001 uniforms. The green uniforms would be revived again in the 2015–16 season, still with the 1990s number scheme. The aforementioned uniforms were brought back for the 2020–21 season as part of Nike's \"Classic\" set, this time with the proper number scheme. In the 2001–02 NBA season, the Mavericks drastically updated their logos and uniforms, with a new Dallas Cowboys-inspired color scheme of midnight blue, royal blue and silver. The new uniforms consist of a \"Dallas\" script on both the home and road jerseys. On the home jersey, \"Dallas\" is in midnight blue across the chest and the numbers are in royal blue with silver trim, while on the road jersey, \"Dallas\" is in white, with the numbers in silver and white trim. In the 2003–04 NBA season, the Mavericks debuted their shiny silver alternate uniforms, with \"Mavericks\" in white and royal blue trim, with blue numerals. However, it proved to be unpopular with fans (thus derisively nicknamed the 'Trash Bags'), and it was scrapped after just one game (at Lakers on October 28, 2003). In the 2004–05 NBA season, the Mavericks introduced an alternate green uniform similar to their 1980s road uniforms. They were designed by rapper Sean \"P. Diddy\" Combs, and featured \"Mavs\" in white on the front side of the jersey with blue trim, and the numbers in silver with white trim above the script on the left chest. On September 21, 2009, the Mavericks unveiled a new alternate royal blue uniform with the same \"Mavs\" script, replacing the green uniform. The said uniform will also be used for the NBA's Noche Latina promotion, with the wordmark \"Los Mavs.\".[100] On August 19, 2010, the Mavericks unveiled yet another change to their uniform set, with a new royal blue road uniform that displays the \"Dallas\" script in navy blue with silver numbers, both with white trim. The alternate royal blue uniform was retired as a result and this new uniform has replaced the midnight blue one as the main road uniform.[101] However the 'Los Mavs' uniforms were still in use despite the change, but would be the last time the Mavericks participated in the 'Noche Latina' uniform events. On December 13, 2011, during media day, the Mavericks unveiled an alternate uniform based on the last alternate uniform they wore in the 2009–10 season, except that the base color is navy blue and the number is positioned below the team nickname 'Mavs' rather than above, effectively reversing roles. On September 23, 2014, the Mavericks unveiled a new navy alternate uniform, featuring a depiction of the Dallas skyline in silver with white trim. The uniform was selected among thousands of entries as part of a design-a-uniform contest the Mavericks initiated during the 2013–14 season, but was not worn until the 2015–16 season. With the switch to Nike as the uniform supplier in 2017, the home and away uniform designations were eliminated. In its place are the \"Icon\" uniforms, \"Association\" uniforms, \"Statement\" uniforms and \"City\" uniforms. The Mavericks' white uniforms are part of the \"Association\" set, the royal blue uniforms are identified with the \"Icon\" set, and the navy blue uniforms are included in the \"Statement\" set. For the \"City\" set, the Mavericks wore black uniforms with \"DAL\" and the numbers in royal blue with neon green trim (a nod to the original Mavericks' colors). This set was worn only during the 2017–18 season, after which a new \"City\" uniform would be designed. The new \"City\" uniform was unveiled in November 2018. The \"DAL\" across the chest was replaced with the team's secondary logo and the neon green trim was removed, with the numbers no longer having a trim color. The \"City\" uniform for the 2019–20 season featured a stylized \"MAVS\" wordmark inspired from graffiti paintings. The uniform base had a light blue/navy blue gradient and neon green trim. The \"City\" uniform for 2020–21 featured a white base with gold and silver trim, which was said to be inspired by Pegasus, a Dallas symbol. Prior to the 2019–20 season, the Mavericks drastically redesigned their navy \"Statement\" uniforms, eliminating the Dallas skyline and reverting to the full team name \"Mavericks\" in front. The uniform contains white lettering and white and royal blue side stripes. During the 2021–22 season, in commemoration of the NBA's 75th anniversary, the Mavericks wore \"City\" uniforms featuring various elements taken from past uniforms. The template used is from their current uniforms, but with green striping. The typography resembled the Mavericks' uniforms from 1980 to 2001, and featured a modified version of the cowboy hat logo (except the \"M\" was replaced with a \"D\"). A recolored version of the current horse logo appears on the shorts, and the skyline silhouette from their 2015–2019 navy alternates is placed on the beltline. The 2022–23 \"City\" uniform featured retro-style white letters with green trim on a blue base, which was a nod to the late 1970s–early 1980s disco era that served as a boom period within the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex.[102] For the 2023–24 \"City\" uniform, the Mavericks partnered with Grammy Award-winning recording artist Leon Bridges in designing the uniform. The black-based uniform with stylized Western letters in silver and blue trim pay homage to 150 years of American rhythm and blues history.[103] This uniform, albeit in white with silver letters, was reused for their 2024–25 \"City\" uniform.[104] There have been nine head coaches for the Mavericks franchise. The franchise's first head coach was Dick Motta, who served for two non-consecutive stints and coached for nine seasons with the Mavericks. Motta is the franchise's all-time leader for the most regular season games coached (738); Don Nelson, Donnie Nelson's father, is the franchise's all-time leader for the most regular season game wins (339); Avery Johnson is the franchise's all-time leader for the most playoff games coached (47), the most playoff-game wins (23), and the highest winning percentage in the regular season (.735). Nelson is also named one of the top 10 coaches in NBA history.[105] Johnson was the first coach to win the Western Conference championship, losing the 2006 NBA Finals to the Miami Heat.[106] Johnson is also the only Mavericks coach to have won the NBA Coach of the Year Award, having won it in the 2005–06 season.[107] Quinn Buckner and Jim Cleamons have spent their entire NBA coaching careers with the Mavericks. Only one of the Mavericks coaches, Don Nelson, has been elected into the Basketball Hall of Fame as a coach.[108] Rick Carlisle was the head coach of the Mavericks from 2008 to 2021.[109][65][66] Carlisle led the team to their first championship in franchise history in 2011, against their 2006 Finals opponent, the Miami Heat, in a rematch. In 2015, he passed Motta as the winningest coach in franchise history. Currently, the head coach is Jason Kidd, who in 2022 led the Mavericks to the team's first playoff series win since the 2011 championship season that he won as a player. The Mavericks-Heat rivalry is a testament to when the two teams faced each other in the NBA finals on two occasions. First they came head to head in the 2006 NBA Finals, in which the two teams captured their first respective conference titles. The Mavericks came into the series 60–22 with a strong group of players while the Miami Heat came in with a respectable 52–30 record and sported an aging but still strong Shaquille O'Neal as well as an up-and-coming Dwyane Wade. Dallas was favored by many in the media to win the series. The Dallas Mavericks won the first two games but Miami went on to sweep the next four and win the NBA championship for the first time in team history. Both teams saw success over the next few seasons and appeared in the playoffs multiple times, and would ultimately go on to have a rematch in the 2011 NBA Finals. It was also the first time that either team had reached the Finals since 2006. This time, however, Miami was favored to win after the highly publicized signings of LeBron James and Chris Bosh to their roster. Dallas came in with a 57–25 record while the Heat came in 58–24. Miami won the first game 92–84, but Dallas went on to win four of the next five and upset the Heat to win the first title in franchise history. The Mavericks-Spurs rivalry is relatively new but very fierce. It features two teams with Dallas roots—the Spurs began their life in the ABA as the Dallas Chaparrals and did not move to San Antonio until 1973. On October 11, 1980, the Mavericks made their NBA debut by defeating the Spurs 103–92. The teams have met numerous times in the playoffs, with the Spurs defeating the Mavericks in 2001, 2003, 2010, and 2014, while the Mavericks defeated the Spurs in 2006 and 2009. The Spurs have won five championships and six conference titles, while the Mavericks have won one championship and three conference titles. The Spurs have won 15 division titles, while the Mavericks have won 5. Both the Spurs and the Mavericks have 3 60-win seasons. This is known as the \"I-35 rivalry\" because both cities lie on Interstate 35. The two teams met in the playoffs during the 2000–2001 season with the Spurs winning in five games. Little was made during this series, as the Spurs won their first NBA championship only two years before. The Mavericks, run by a trio of Steve Nash, Michael Finley, and Dirk Nowitzki, had just defeated the Utah Jazz despite not having home-court advantage and were only starting to meld into a title contender. The two teams met again in 2003 in the Western Conference finals. Both the Spurs and the Mavericks had 60-win seasons and reached the Western Conference finals after defeating the Los Angeles Lakers and the Sacramento Kings, respectively. Despite having the best season of their history, the Mavericks fell in six games to the Spurs. The rivalry took on a new meaning in 2005 when, near the end of the regular season, Don Nelson would resign as head coach of the Mavericks, apparently satisfied with the state of the team, and hand the coaching reins to former Spur Avery Johnson, the point guard of the 1999 NBA champion Spurs team who hit the game-winning shot against the New York Knicks. Since Johnson was coached under Spurs' head coach Gregg Popovich, he would be familiar with most, if not all, of Popovich's coaching style and philosophy. During the 2005 off-season, Michael Finley, waived by the Mavericks under the amnesty clause, joined the Spurs in search for the elusive title. During the 2006 playoffs the two rivals met again. San Antonio won the first game at home 87–85. The Mavericks got revenge the next game, winning 113–91 and evening the series up at 1–1. The Mavericks then won a dramatic Game 3 by a single point, 104–103. Though Manu Ginóbili could have made a game-winning basket with five seconds on the clock, he committed an error, allowing the ball to bounce away from him with one second remaining. Dallas won a tightly contested Game 4 123–118 in overtime. The Spurs proceeded to avoid elimination by taking Game 5. In the final seconds of the game, Jason Terry was seen punching former teammate Michael Finley under the belt, leading to his suspension for Game 6. He was sorely missed as the Spurs won, taking the series back home for a Game 7. In the crucial Game 7, with 2.6 seconds to go, Nowitzki converted a three-point play to force overtime. Manu Ginóbili, who fouled Dirk on the play, had just given San Antonio their first lead one possession earlier. Tim Duncan, who had played in all 48 minutes of regulation, was too fatigued to carry his team in overtime. The Mavericks, meanwhile, were set to take control of the game and they did just that, winning 119–111. The Mavericks went on to the Conference Finals where they defeated the Suns in six games, but succumbed to the champion Heat in the NBA Finals. Despite much anticipation of a renewed meeting in the 2007 Western Conference finals, the Mavericks lost to the Golden State Warriors in one of the greatest upsets in NBA history. The Spurs won the NBA finals after beating the Cleveland Cavaliers 4–0.[110] The eighth seed Warriors, who made the playoffs on the last game of the NBA season, defeated the 67-win, first-seed Mavericks in six games.[111] Meanwhile, the Spurs would ultimately go on to win the 2007 NBA Championship, establishing themselves as a true NBA dynasty.[112][113][114][115] The season also gave longtime former Maverick Michael Finley his first championship. Many Spurs teammates claimed that the drive to win this season was partially to give Finley his first championship, especially since Finley had lost a bitter-fought series to his longtime team the year previous.[116] Worth noting in a regular season meeting between the two rivals in April 2007, a game that the Spurs won 91–86, Tim Duncan suffered his first career ejection for supposedly laughing while sitting on the bench. Joey Crawford, the referee who ejected Duncan, allegedly asked Duncan to a fight which led to the longtime ref's season-ending suspension. As Duncan was heading into the locker room, American Airlines Center erupted into a huge cheer, applauding Duncan's ejection. The game saw chippy play, with Jerry Stackhouse and Manu Ginóbili getting into an altercation after a rebound. In the 2009 NBA playoffs, the Mavericks and Spurs squared off again in the first round. The Spurs and Mavericks split the first two games in San Antonio, but Dallas defeated the Spurs in games 3 and 4, both in Dallas. The Mavericks then went on to close out the series and eliminated the Spurs at the AT&T Center in San Antonio. In 2010, the Dallas Mavericks matched up against the San Antonio Spurs in the first round of the Western Conference Playoffs. Although the Mavericks managed to obtain the number two seed, they were defeated by the Spurs in six games. During the 2011 playoffs, a role reversal of sorts occurred between the two rivals, when the top-seeded Spurs were defeated by the eighth-seeded Memphis Grizzlies, the first time an eight-seed defeated a one-seed since the Mavericks-Warriors series of 2007. In addition, the Mavericks defeated the LeBron James-led Miami Heat in the NBA Finals. The Mavericks were swept in the 2012–13 season by the Spurs for the first time since the 1997–98 season, Tim Duncan's rookie season. In their last match-up of the season, San Antonio escaped with a 92–91 victory over Dallas when a Vince Carter 3-point attempt bounced off the rim at the buzzer. With the win, the Spurs clinched a playoff spot for the 16th straight season, currently the longest streak in the NBA. San Antonio also reached 50 wins for the 14th straight season, the longest streak in NBA history.[117] In the 2013–14 season, the Spurs once again swept the Mavericks in the regular season, giving them nine straight victories. In addition, an overtime loss to the Memphis Grizzlies on April 16, 2014, ensured that the Mavericks would face the Spurs once again in the 2014 NBA playoffs, where the Mavericks were the eighth seed and San Antonio the first. In Game 1 in San Antonio, the game was relatively close. Dallas reached an 81–71 lead in the fourth quarter, but the Spurs rallied back and took Game 1 at home, 90–85. However, the Mavericks managed to force 22 turnovers in Game 2 to rout the Spurs 113–92, splitting the first two games before the series went to Dallas. In Game 3, Manu Ginóbili managed to hit a shot that put the Spurs up 108–106 with 1.7 left, but a buzzer-beater by Vince Carter gave the Mavs the victory, putting them up 2–1 in the series. The Spurs took Game 4 in Dallas 93–89 and later Game 5 at home 109–103, giving them a 3–2 lead. The Mavericks won Game 6 at home by 113–111. The Spurs won game 7 119–96, eliminating the Mavericks in the first round. During the 2004 off-season, former Dallas Mavericks point guard Steve Nash signed a free-agent deal with the 29–53 Phoenix Suns to help out their offense. The addition of Nash helped as Phoenix rolled to a 62–20 record and the best record in the NBA. The teams met in the 2005 Western Conference Semifinals with Phoenix having the home-court advantage. Phoenix won game 1 127–102 with a 40-point game by Amar'e Stoudemire. Steve Nash was also given his NBA MVP award during that game, a game in which he terrorized his former team. However, Mavericks star Dirk Nowitzki hit a game-winning turn-around jumper in game 2 to beat Phoenix 108–106 to send the series back to Dallas tied 1–1. Phoenix and Dallas split the two games in Dallas which saw both winners of games score 119 points. The series went back to Phoenix then took care of Dallas 114–108 in the America West Arena (now Footprint Center). Then, in game 6, with Dallas facing elimination, Phoenix beat Dallas in a thriller which saw Steve Nash with a 39-point game, to go along with 12 assists. In the Western Conference finals, Phoenix lost to the San Antonio Spurs, who then went on to win the NBA title. The following year, a Suns team without Stoudemire (who was injured), Joe Johnson, and Quentin Richardson, but with a core of new players led by Raja Bell (who clotheslined Lakers star Kobe Bryant in a first-round series game), Boris Diaw and Tim Thomas to go along with Nash and fellow All-Star Shawn Marion. Phoenix had to play seven-game series against the two Los Angeles teams, the Los Angeles Lakers (who had a 3–1 lead against Phoenix) and the resurgent Los Angeles Clippers. In the Western Conference finals, they faced a Mavericks team who won 60 games, but were forced to be the fourth seed since the division winners got the top three seeds. On their way to the Western Conference finals, Dallas swept the Memphis Grizzlies, and beat in-state rival San Antonio Spurs in seven tense games. Phoenix won game 1 121–118 after Diaw hit a game-winning shot in the dying seconds of the fourth quarter. Bell, though injured himself in game 1, missing Games Two and Three. After that, Dallas took control of the series, winning Games Two and Three by the scores of 105–98 and 95–88. Bell came back for game 4 and led Phoenix to a 106–86 win. Dallas however, beat Phoenix 117–101 in game 5 which included a 50-point performance from Dirk Nowitzki, and eliminated the Suns in Phoenix 102–93 in game 6. Dallas would later lose to the Miami Heat in six games, despite winning the first two games. On March 14, 2007, in Dallas, Phoenix beat Dallas in a 129–127 double-overtime thriller. With the Mavericks up by 7 with a minute left in regulation, Dirk Nowitzki (a 90% free throw shooter) missed two free throws. Steve Nash fed off his mistakes and scored 10 straight points including the game-tying three-pointer with 3 seconds left to go. Dirk Nowitzki's potential game-winning shot bounced off the rim and sent the game to overtime. Jason Terry sent the game into another overtime with a game-tying three-pointer of his own. Dirk Nowitzki's potential game-tying shot in double overtime went in and out of the rim as Amar'e Stoudemire's 41 points were too much for Dallas to handle. On April 10, 2013, the Mavericks 12-season playoff streak, since 2001, ended in a loss to the Suns 102–91.[118] On April 12, 2014, the Mavs handed the Suns one of three straight losses to keep them out of the playoffs, 101–98. Their other two losses were to the San Antonio Spurs and Memphis Grizzlies. From the 2016–17 season through the 2021–22 regular season, the Suns dominated the rivalry, winning 17 out of 21 head-to-head games, including separate winning streaks of nine and seven games.[119] The Mavericks and the Suns met again in the 2022 Western Conference Semifinals, in which the Suns were coming off a historic franchise-record 64 wins, while the Mavericks compiled 52 regular season wins. Despite the Suns being heavily favored to win and going up 2–0 in the series, the Suns' season ended in an upset 123–90 game 7 loss to the Mavericks on their home floor.[120] An NBA intrastate rivalry, both in Texas linked by I-45, as well as both Dallas and Houston fans traditionally having a disdain for each other's city, the rivalry started when the Mavericks were the last Texas team to join the NBA. This is also known as the I-45 rivalry because they both lie on Interstate 45. In the Mavericks' inaugural season in 1980–81, the Rockets won all six meetings including a 116–68 win.[121] In the playoffs, the Mavericks defeated the Rockets in the 1988 and 2005 playoffs, the latter of which was plagued with allegations of game-fixing,[122] while the Rockets swept several season series with the Mavericks during the 1990s, and also during the Rockets' championship years. On April 11, 1995, the Mavericks defeated the Rockets 156–147 in double overtime, making that win one of their most memorable victories against Houston who were the reigning champions. Two years later, the Rockets and Mavericks have clashed in their first-ever regular season game played in Mexico City, which was won by the Rockets 108–106. In the 2010s, the rivalry has once again flourished with Dallas owner Mark Cuban and Rockets general manager Daryl Morey taking shots at each other on social media, as well as Houston fan-favorite Chandler Parsons signing an offer sheet to leave the Rockets to sign with the rival Mavericks for $46 million, while making negative statements about the city of Houston upon leaving,[123] causing massive backlash among Rockets fans. Finally, longtime Mavericks' player Jason Terry, who was a starter on the Mavericks' 2011 championship team, joined the Rockets for the 2014–15 season, and both teams met in the first round of the 2015 NBA playoffs, with the Rockets as the second seed and Mavericks the seventh seed, and the Rockets got the best of them 4–1. The rivalry between the Lakers and Mavericks began in the 1980s during the Lakers' Showtime era. In the 1984 NBA playoffs, the Lakers won over the Mavericks in the Western Conference Semi-finals with the series 4–1. In 1986, they met again in the semi-finals and the Lakers won the series 4–2. In the 1988 NBA playoffs, the Lakers, who were the defending champions, defeated the Mavericks in a seven-game series in the Western Conference finals and eventually became the back-to-back champions after winning the NBA Finals. In 2011, the Mavericks met the two-time defending champions Lakers in the semi-finals and rejected their three-peat by sweeping them in four games and eventually won the NBA Finals. In Game 2 of the 2011 NBA playoffs, Ron Artest was ejected for hitting J. J. Barea and suspended for Game 3. In Game 4, Lamar Odom was ejected for pushing Dirk Nowitzki and then Andrew Bynum was ejected for elbowing J. J. Barea. Both players received flagrant foul 2. After the 2011 NBA lockout, Lamar Odom was sent to the Mavericks after he requested to leave the Lakers due to the vetoed Chris Paul trade. Andrew Bynum made a formal apology for what he did to Barea before the start of the following season. List of the last five seasons completed by the Mavericks.

Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, W–L% = Winning percentage Roster Last transaction: October 22, 2024 The Mavericks hold the draft rights to the following unsigned draft picks who have been playing outside the NBA. A drafted player, either an international draftee or a college draftee who is not signed by the team that drafted him, is allowed to sign with any non-NBA teams. In this case, the team retains the player's draft rights in the NBA until one year after the player's contract with the non-NBA team ends.[124] This list includes draft rights that were acquired from trades with other teams. The following Mavericks players were selected to the NBA All-Star Game.[128] Mark Cuban purchased a majority stake in the Mavericks for $285 million from Ross Perot Jr. in 2000.[129][130] On December 27, 2023, casino magnates Miriam Adelson and Patrick Dumont acquired a 69% majority stake in the team at a franchise valuation of between $3.8 billion and $3.9 billion. Cuban retained 27% ownership and operational oversight of the team. Dumont replaced Cuban as the team's governor on the NBA Board of Governors, and the Adelson and Dumont families would have final say over all business and basketball decisions. Adelson funded the purchase by selling $2 billion of stock in Las Vegas Sands Corporation and with additional cash on hand. As part of the purchase, four minority shareholders were bought out, except for Mary Stanton who kept her 4% stake in the franchise.[6][131][132] Cuban's nearly 23-year tenure as owner and governor was the longest and most successful in team history. During the Cuban era, the Mavericks' record was 1,152–782, with 18 playoff berths, and the 2011 NBA championship.[6] Terdema Ussery served as team president and CEO from 1997 until 2015.[133] During this time Ussery also served in other roles, including president of the Dallas Mavericks Foundation and an alternate governor for the Mavericks on the NBA Board of Governors.[134] Ussery left the Mavericks for a position with Under Armour. In February 2018, the Dallas Mavericks hired former AT&T executive Cynthia Marshall as their interim CEO in a direct response to the franchise's sexual assault and domestic violence allegations involving Ussery and Earl K. Sneed.[135][136] Marshall was the first black female CEO of an NBA franchise as well as the first woman ever to hold the position.[137] Owner Mark Cuban formally responded in March 2018 to allegations of a 2011 sexual assault that surfaced in a Sports Illustrated investigation released in February.[138] In an email to The Associated Press on March 6, Cuban stated, \"It didn't happen.\"[139] The organization hired a pair of independent investigators to look into allegations.[140] On September 19, 2018, the team's investigation report concluded that there were \"numerous instances of sexual harassment and other improper workplace conduct\" that had occurred within the organization, none of which being related to the allegation on Cuban himself. Cuban also agreed to donate $10 million in reparations to organizations related to women's causes, mainly those committed to combating domestic violence and supporting the professional development of women within the sports industry. On October 5, 2018, over two weeks after the team publicly released their sexual harassment report, it was reported that team photographer Danny Bollinger made propositions to four now-former employees over the course of a decade. Bollinger was laid off by Cuban four days later.",

                "content": "Kate Garry Hudson (born April 19, 1979)[1] is an American actress and singer. She has received various accolades, including a Golden Globe Award and a nomination for an Academy Award. Born to singer Bill Hudson and actress Goldie Hawn, Hudson made her film debut in the 1998 drama Desert Blue, which was followed by supporting roles in several films. She rose to prominence with her portrayal of Penny Lane in Cameron Crowe's musical drama Almost Famous (2000), for which she won a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress and received an Oscar nomination in the same category. Throughout the 2000s, Hudson starred in a succession of romantic comedies, most notably in How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days (2003), You, Me and Dupree (2006), Fool's Gold (2008), and Bride Wars (2009). On television, she had a recurring role in the musical series Glee (2012–2013) and a starring role in the second season of Truth Be Told (2022). Her other film credits include The Skeleton Key (2005), Nine (2009), Rock the Kasbah (2015), Deepwater Horizon (2016), Mother's Day (2016), Music (2021), and Glass Onion (2022). Hudson is a co-founder of the fitness brand and membership program Fabletics, operated by TechStyle Fashion Group.[2][3] She is also the author of the non-fiction books Pretty Happy: Healthy Ways to Love Your Body (2016) and Pretty Fun: Creating and Celebrating a Lifetime of Tradition (2017). Hudson released her debut studio album, Glorious in 2024. Hudson was born in Los Angeles, California, the daughter of Academy Award-winning actress Goldie Hawn and Bill Hudson, an actor, comedian, and musician.[1] Her parents divorced when she was 18 months old and she and her older brother, actor Oliver Hudson, were raised in Snowmass, Colorado, and Pacific Palisades, California, by her mother and her mother's longtime boyfriend, actor Kurt Russell.[4] Hudson's ancestry is Italian (from her paternal grandmother), Hungarian Jewish (from her maternal grandmother),[5][6][7] and the remainder a mix of English and some German.[8][9] She was raised Jewish;[10][11] like her mother, she also practices Buddhism.[12] Hudson has stated that her biological father \"doesn't know me from a hole in the wall\", and she considers Russell her father.[13] Hudson has described her mother as \"the woman that I've learned the most from, and who I look up to, who has conducted her life in a way that I can look up to\".[14] She has four half-siblings: Emily and Zachary Hudson, from her biological father's later marriage to actress Cindy Williams; Lalania Hudson, from his relationship with another woman;[15] and Wyatt Russell, from her mother's relationship with Kurt Russell. In 1997, she graduated from Crossroads, a college preparatory school in Santa Monica. She was accepted to New York University, but chose to pursue an acting career instead of an undergraduate degree.[4] At age 11, Hudson performed on stage at the Santa Monica Playhouse.[16] She made her film debut in the dramedy Desert Blue (1998), and subsequently appeared in the romantic comedy 200 Cigarettes (1999). She took on the roles of a college student in the psychological thriller Gossip, the lesbian daughter of the titular character in the dramedy Dr. T & the Women and one of the leading roles in the romantic comedy About Adam, all of which were released during 2000.[16] Her breakthrough came with the role of a veteran groupie in Cameron Crowe's semi-autobiographical dramedy Almost Famous (2000). She \"hung in and had turned down leads in other movies just to play the part\" and soon obtained it \"because of her loyalty\", according to Crowe.[16] For her performance, she won the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress at the 58th Golden Globe Awards and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress at the 73rd Academy Awards.[4] Entertainment Weekly put it on its end-of-the-decade, \"best-of\" list, saying, \"This power ballad of a movie also happens to be Crowe's greatest (and most personal) film thanks to the golden gods of Stillwater and their biggest fan, Kate Hudson's incomparable Penny Lane.\"[17] She worked hard in avoiding association with her well-known parents, as she did not want to be perceived as someone who \"rode on somebody's coattails\".[4] In 2002, Hudson appeared in the remake of the historical romance The Four Feathers, as the fiancée of a young British officer (played by Heath Ledger). The film was panned by critics and had a lukewarm box office response.[18] In her next film, the romantic comedy How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days (2003), Hudson starred with Matthew McConaughey, as a writer for a women's magazine who, for an article, starts dating a guy and trying to drive him away using only the \"classic mistakes women make\" in relationships. The film was a box office success, grossing over US$100 million upon its release. She also starred opposite Naomi Watts in the Merchant-Ivory film Le Divorce (2003), portraying a woman who, with her sister, dispute the ownership of a painting by Georges de La Tour with the family of her former brother-in-law. Entertainment Weekly gave the film a \"C\" rating and wrote: \"I'm disappointed to report that Hudson and Watts have no chemistry as sisters\".[19] Her next romantic comedies, Alex & Emma (2003), in which she played a stubborn stenographer, and Raising Helen (2004), taking on the role of a young woman who becomes the guardian of her deceased sister's children, were released to varying degrees of success. In 2005, Hudson starred in the supernatural thriller The Skeleton Key, as a young hospice nurse who acquires a job at a New Orleans plantation home, and becomes entangled in a supernatural mystery involving the house. In its review, The Washington Post, describing her, wrote: \"Hudson, who dials back her native, Goldie-given charm here to give Caroline a no-nonsense brusqueness, manages to convincingly convey a fearless bullheadedness rather than less sympathetic naivete\".[20] The film was a box office hit, grossing over US$91.9 million worldwide ($47.9 million in North America).[21] Her next film, the comedy You, Me and Dupree, in which she appeared with Owen Wilson and Matt Dillon as one half of a couple who allows an unemployed friend to move in, grossed US$21.5 million on its opening weekend of July 14, 2006.[22] It eventually made US$130.4 million worldwide.[23] In 2007, Hudson directed the short film Cutlass, one of Glamour magazine's \"Reel Moments\" based on readers' personal essays, which starred Kurt Russell, Dakota Fanning, Virginia Madsen, Chevy Chase and Kristen Stewart.[24] In the romantic comedy Fool's Gold (2008), her second film with Matthew McConaughey, Hudson took on the role a divorced woman who returns with her former husband while searching for a lost treasure. She was certified in scuba diving in the Great Barrier Reef for the underwater scenes. The film made US$111.2 million worldwide.[25] In My Best Friend's Girl, another romantic comedy released in 2008, Hudson played the colleague of an amiable guy (Jason Biggs). Despite negative reviews, it was a moderate commercial success.[26] Hudson starred in Bride Wars (2009),[27] alongside Anne Hathaway, playing two best friends who become rivals after their weddings are scheduled on the same day. The film was named among the 10 worst chick flicks of all time by Time in 2010,[28] but was successful financially, grossing US$114.6 million globally.[29] Her next film was the musical Nine, directed by Rob Marshall, in which she played a Vogue fashion journalist, alongside Daniel Day-Lewis, Marion Cotillard, Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman, and Judi Dench. The film was acclaimed by critics and Hudson garnered praise for her dancing skills, showcased in a 1960s-inspired original piece called \"Cinema Italiano\", which was written specifically for her character.[30] Hudson starred with Casey Affleck and Jessica Alba, as the wife of a West Texas serial killer, in the film adaptation The Killer Inside Me, which premiered at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival. In 2011, Hudson played a quickwitted, carefree ad executive in the romantic comedy film A Little Bit of Heaven, and a party girl in another romantic comedy, Something Borrowed, based on Emily Giffin's novel of the same name. In is review for the latter, Detroit News remarked: \"Kate Hudson looks exhausted, as if she is as tired of wading through another one of her feckless duds as we are of watching them\".[31] While A Little Bit of Heaven found a limited release in theaters, Something Borrowed was a moderate commercial success.[32] In 2012, Hudson was cast on the Fox teen comedy series Glee, in the recurring role of Cassandra July, a dance teacher at the fictitious New York Academy of the Dramatic Arts.[33][34][35] In 2013, Hudson appeared in the political thriller The Reluctant Fundamentalist, as a photographer and the girlfriend of a professor at the University of Lahore. In 2014, she starred in the comedy Wish I Was Here, as the wife of a struggling actor, and the thriller Good People, as one half of a couple who fall into severe debt while renovating their family's home. The aforementioned films received a limited release and mixed reviews from critics.[36][37][38][39] In Rock the Kasbah (2015), Hudson played a top-hatted hooker with a heart of gold who befriends a has-been actor manager (Bill Murray) in Afghanistan. Despite a US$15-million budget, the film made just US$3 million at the North American box office.[40] Hudson voiced a crazy ribbon-dancing panda in the DreamWorks Animation film Kung Fu Panda 3 (2016),[41] which grossed US$521.1 million globally,[42] and became her most widely seen film.[41] She starred as a woman married to an Indian man and the sister of a lesbian woman, both of whom had not told their conservative parents, in the romantic comedy Mother's Day (2016), directed by Garry Marshall and opposite Julia Roberts, Timothy Olyphant, and Jason Sudeikis.[43] The film was panned by critics and a moderate commercial success.[44] She next played the wife of a chief electronics technician (Mark Wahlberg) in the drama Deepwater Horizon, based on the Deepwater Horizon explosion.[45][46] While critical response was positive, the film was only slightly profitable, making US$121.8 million on a budget of around US$110 million.[47] In the 2017 film Marshall, Hudson portrayed an employer accusing her black chauffeur of rape. It received positive reviews from critics but found a limited audience in theaters.[48] In 2021, Hudson co-starred as Kazu Gamble in musical film Music, co-written and directed by Sia.[49][50][51][52] She received her second overall Golden Globe nomination in the category of Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Comedy or Musical for her work on the film at the 78th Golden Globe Awards.[53] In 2021, she starred in Mona Lisa and the Blood Moon, a fantasy-adventure film by writer-director Ana Lily Amirpour.[54] In 2022, she starred alongside Michael Shannon in A Little White Lie directed by Michael Maren.[55] Also in 2022, Hudson co-starred in Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery, playing the role of Birdie Jay, a Manhattan supermodel turned fashion designer involved in a murder mystery.[56] Hudson signed a record deal with Virgin Music Group,[57][58] and released her debut single, \"Talk About Love\" in January 2024.[59][60] She wrote the song alongside her fiancée Danny Fujikawa and Linda Perry.[61][62] She released the single \"Live Forever\" on March 28, 2024;[63][64] the song was hailed by Rolling Stone as \"a love letter to parents\".[65] Hudson followed with \"Gonna Find Out\", which was released on April 17, 2024.[66] Hudson released her debut studio album, Glorious, on May 17, 2024.[67][68][69] On August 28, 2024, Hudson released a cover of the 1985 'Til Tuesday single \"Voices Carry\".[70] In 2013, Hudson, in a partnership with online fashion retailer TechStyle Fashion Group, launched her own line of workout clothes and active wear, Fabletics,[71][72][73] which currently operates 25 stores in the United States. The venture became her focus, and in a 2018 interview, Hudson remarked: \"I work more on Fabletics now than I do on movies.\"[74] In 2016, Hudson released her first book, Pretty Happy: Healthy Ways to Love Your Body.[75] In 2017, she released her second book, Pretty Fun: Creating and Celebrating a Lifetime of Tradition. In August 2018, Hudson and New York & Company announced their partnership, a multi-year deal to represent the ambassador for the company's US$200-million Soho Jeans collection, and to develop her own fashion line.[76] In 2018, Hudson collaborated with her mother Goldie to create a capsule collection, with 50 percent of net proceeds will benefit MindUP, a program within the Goldie Hawn Foundation. In November 2019, Hudson launched King St. Vodka, a vodka from California.[77] A podcast, Sibling Revelry, by Kate and her brother Oliver,[78][79] resulted in \"playfully bickering\" while promoting it on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert in 2022.[80][81][82] Hudson's only marriage has been to Chris Robinson, lead singer for the Black Crowes. They married on December 31, 2000, in Aspen, Colorado. Their son Ryder was born in January 2004.[83] The couple announced their separation in August 2006; Robinson filed for divorce that November, citing irreconcilable differences.[84] The divorce was finalized on October 22, 2007.[85] Before her marriage, Hudson dated actor Matt LeBlanc for at least one year beginning in 1995.[86][87] In 2010, Hudson began dating Muse lead vocalist and guitarist Matt Bellamy.[88][89][90] They became engaged in April 2011,[91] three months before the birth of their son Bing.[92][93] They broke up in 2014.[94] They remain on good terms.[95] In December 2016,[96] Hudson began dating Danny Fujikawa, a musician, actor, and co-owner of a record company.[97][98] They met through her best friends, Sara and Erin Foster, who are his stepsisters.[99] Their daughter Rani, who they named after his grandfather Ron Fujikawa, was born in October 2018.[100][101] They announced their engagement in September 2021, but a wedding has not taken place.[102] Hudson sued the British version of National Enquirer in 2006 after it reported she had an eating disorder, describing her as \"painfully thin\". Hudson said the tabloid's statements were \"a blatant lie\" and she was concerned about the impact the false report could have on impressionable young women.[103] The newspaper apologized and compensated her.[104] In 2016, Hudson said: \"Meditation has been the most helpful and life-changing thing for me. You can feel the difference when you meditate on a regular basis. At least I can... I started practicing transcendental meditation a year and a half ago so I meditate 20 minutes in the morning and I try to do another 20 minutes in the afternoon.\"[105]",

                "content": "Justin Pierre James Trudeau[c] (born December 25, 1971) is a Canadian politician who has been serving as the 23rd prime minister of Canada since 2015 and the leader of the Liberal Party since 2013. Trudeau was born in Ottawa, Ontario, and attended Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf. He graduated from McGill University in 1994 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in literature, then in 1998 acquired a Bachelor of Education degree from the University of British Columbia. After graduating, he taught at the secondary school level in Vancouver, before relocating back to Montreal in 2002 to further his studies. He was chair for the youth charity Katimavik and director of the not-for-profit Canadian Avalanche Association. In 2006, he was appointed as chair of the Liberal Party's Task Force on Youth Renewal. In the 2008 federal election, he was elected to represent the riding of Papineau in the House of Commons. He was the Liberal Party's Official Opposition critic for youth and multiculturalism in 2009; the following year, he became critic for citizenship and immigration. In 2011, he was appointed as a critic for secondary education and sport. In 2013, Trudeau was elected as leader of the Liberal Party, and led the party to a majority government in the 2015 federal election. Trudeau was the second-youngest prime minister in Canadian history when he took office and the first to be the child of a previous holder of the post, as the eldest son of Pierre Trudeau. Major government initiatives he undertook during his first term included establishing the Canada Child Benefit, legalizing medical assistance in dying, legalizing recreational marijuana through the Cannabis Act; attempting Senate appointment reform by establishing the Independent Advisory Board for Senate Appointments and establishing the federal carbon tax. In foreign policy, Trudeau's government negotiated trade deals such as the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA) and the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, and signed the Paris Agreement on climate change. He was sanctioned by Canada's ethics commissioner for violating conflict of interest rules regarding the Aga Khan affair, and later again with the SNC-Lavalin affair. Trudeau's Liberal Party was reduced to a minority government in the 2019 federal election. His government responded to the COVID-19 pandemic, announced an \"assault-style\" weapons ban in response to the 2020 Nova Scotia attacks, and launched a national $10-a-day child care program. He was investigated for a third time by the ethics commissioner for his part in the WE Charity scandal, but was cleared of wrongdoing. In the 2021 federal election, he led the Liberals to another minority government. In 2022, he invoked the Emergencies Act in response to the Freedom Convoy protests and responded to the Russian invasion of Ukraine by imposing sanctions on Russia and authorizing military aid to Ukraine. His party signed a confidence and supply agreement with the New Democratic Party (NDP) in early 2022, which resulted in the Canadian Dental Care Plan for residents that meet a certain income threshold and a framework for national pharmacare; in late 2024, the NDP opted to terminate the agreement. On June 23, 1971, the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) announced that Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau's wife of four months, Margaret Trudeau (née Sinclair),[2] was pregnant and due in December.[3][4] Justin Trudeau was born on December 25, 1971, at 9:27 pm EST at the Ottawa Civic Hospital.[5] He is the second child in Canadian history to be born to a prime minister in office; the first was John A. Macdonald's daughter Margaret Mary Theodora Macdonald (February 8, 1869 – January 28, 1933). Trudeau's younger brothers Alexandre (Sacha) (born December 25, 1973) and Michel (October 2, 1975 – November 13, 1998) were the third and fourth.[6][7] Trudeau is predominantly of Scottish and French Canadian descent.[8] His grandfathers were businessman Charles-Émile Trudeau[9] and Scottish-born James Sinclair,[10] who was minister of fisheries in the cabinet of Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent.[11] Trudeau's maternal great-grandfather Thomas Bernard was born in Makassar, Indonesia[12] and immigrated to Penticton, British Columbia, in 1906 at age 15 with his family.[13] Through the Bernard family, kinsmen of the Earls of Bandon,[14][15][16] Trudeau is the fifth great-grandson of Major-General William Farquhar,[17] a leader in the founding of modern Singapore; Trudeau also has remote ethnic Malaccan[18][19] and Nias[20][21][22] ancestry. Trudeau was baptized with his father's niece Anne Rouleau-Danis as godmother and his mother's brother-in-law Thomas Walker as godfather,[23][24] at Ottawa's Notre Dame Basilica on the afternoon of January 16, 1972, which marked his first public appearance.[25] and given the names \"Justin Pierre James\".[26] On April 14, 1972, Trudeau's father and mother hosted a gala at the National Arts Centre, at which visiting U.S. president Richard Nixon said, \"I'd like to toast the future prime minister of Canada, to Justin Pierre Trudeau\" to which Pierre Trudeau responded that should his son ever assume the role, he hoped he would have \"the grace and skill of the president\".[27] Earlier that day, first lady Pat Nixon had visited him in his nursery and gifted him a stuffed toy Snoopy.[28][29] Trudeau's parents announced their separation in 1977, when he was five years old; his father was given primary custody.[30] There were repeated rumours of a reconciliation for many years afterwards.[31] However his mother eventually filed for a no-fault divorce which the Supreme Court of Ontario granted in 1984;[32] his father had announced his intention to retire as prime minister a month earlier.[33] Eventually his parents came to an amicable joint-custody arrangement and learned to get along quite well. Interviewed in October 1979, his nanny Dianne Lavergne was quoted, \"Justin is a mommy's boy, so it's not easy, but children's hurts mend very quickly. And they're lucky kids, anyway.\"[34] Of his mother and father's marriage, Trudeau said in 2009, \"They loved each other incredibly, passionately, completely. But there was 30 years between them, and my mom never was an equal partner in what encompassed my father's life, his duty, his country.\"[35] Trudeau has three half-siblings, Kyle and Alicia, from his mother's remarriage to Fried Kemper,[36] and Sarah, from his father's relationship with Deborah Coyne.[37] Trudeau lived at 24 Sussex Drive, Ottawa, the official residence of Canada's prime minister, from his birth until his father's government was defeated in the 1979 federal election. The Trudeaus were expected to move into Stornoway, the residence of the leader of the Official Opposition, but because of flooding in the basement, Prime Minister Joe Clark offered them Harrington Lake, the prime minister's official country retreat in Gatineau Park, with the expectation they would move into Stornoway at the start of July.[38] However, the repairs were not complete, so Pierre Trudeau took a prolonged vacation with his sons to the Nova Scotia summer home of his friend, Member of Parliament Don Johnston, and later sent his sons to stay with their maternal grandparents in North Vancouver for the rest of the summer while he slept at his friend's Ottawa apartment. Trudeau and his brothers returned to Ottawa for the start of the school year but lived only on the top floor of Stornoway while repairs continued on the bottom floor.[39] His mother purchased and moved into a new home nearby at 95 Victoria Street in Ottawa's New Edinburgh neighbourhood in September 1979.[40][41] Pierre Trudeau and his sons returned to the prime minister's official residence after the February 1980 election that returned him to the Prime Minister's Office.[42] His father had intended Trudeau to begin his formal education at a French-language lycée, but Trudeau's mother convinced his father of the importance of sending their sons to a public school.[43] In the end, Trudeau was enrolled in 1976 in the French immersion program at Rockcliffe Park Public School. It was the same school his mother had attended for two years while her father was a member of Parliament.[44] He could have been dropped off by limousine, but his parents elected he take the school bus albeit with a Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) car following.[45][46][47][48] This was followed by one year at the private Lycée Claudel d'Ottawa.[49][50] After his father's retirement in June 1984, his mother remained at her New Edinburgh home while the rest of the family moved into his father's home at 1418 Pine Avenue, Montreal known as Cormier House;[51] the following autumn, he began attending the private Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf, his father's alma mater. The school had begun as a Jesuit school but was non-denominational by the time Justin matriculated.[52][53] In 2008, Trudeau said that of all his early family outings he enjoyed camping with his father the most, because \"that was where our father got to be just our father – a dad in the woods\".[54] During the summers his father would send him and his brothers to Camp Ahmek, on Canoe Lake in Algonquin Provincial Park, where he would later work in his first paid job as a camp counsellor.[50][55][56][57][58] Trudeau and his brothers were given shares in two numbered companies by their father: the first containing a portfolio of securities, from which they receive regular dividends, up to $20,000 per year; and the second which receives royalties from their father's autobiography and other sources, about $10,000 a year.[59] As of August 2011, the first numbered company had assets of $1.2 million.[60] The Trudeau brothers were also given a country estate of about 50 hectares in the Laurentians with a home designed by the esteemed Canadian architect Arthur Erickson, and the Cormier House in Montreal.[61][59][62] The country estate land was estimated to be worth $2.7 million in 2016.[62] Trudeau has a bachelor of arts degree in literature from McGill University and a bachelor of education degree from the University of British Columbia. In his first year at McGill, Trudeau became acquainted with his future principal secretary, Gerald Butts, through their mutual friend, Jonathan Ablett.[63] Butts invited Trudeau to join the McGill Debating Union.[64] They bonded while driving back to Montreal after a debate tournament at Princeton University.[63] After graduation, Trudeau stayed in Vancouver where he became a substitute teacher at local schools such as Killarney Secondary and worked permanently as a French and math teacher at the private West Point Grey Academy. He became a roommate at the Douglas Lodge[65] with fellow West Point Grey Academy faculty member and friend Christopher Ingvaldson.[63][66] From 2002 to 2004, he studied engineering at the École Polytechnique de Montréal, affiliated with Université de Montréal, but did not graduate.[67] He started a master's degree in environmental geography at McGill but withdrew from the program to seek public office.[68] In August 2000, Trudeau attended the Kokanee Summit in Creston, British Columbia, to raise funds in honour of his brother Michel Trudeau and other avalanche victims. After the event, an unsigned editorial in the Creston Valley Advance (a local newspaper) accused Trudeau of having groped an unnamed female reporter while at the music festival. The editorial stated Trudeau provided a \"day-late\" apology to the reporter, saying, \"If I had known you were reporting for a national paper, I never would have been so forward\".[69][70] In 2018, Trudeau was questioned about the groping incident but said he did not remember any negative incidents from that time. His apology and later statement about the event have been described as hypocritical, while responses to the story have been described as a witch hunt or non-story.[71] In October 2000, Trudeau, then 28, emerged as a prominent figure after delivering a eulogy at his father's state funeral.[72][73][74] The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) received numerous calls to rebroadcast the speech after its initial transmission, and leading Quebec politician Claude Ryan described it as \"perhaps ... the first manifestation of a dynasty\".[75] A book issued by the CBC in 2003 included the speech in its list of significant Canadian events from the past fifty years.[76] In 2007, Trudeau starred in the two-part CBC Television miniseries The Great War, which gave an account of Canada's participation in the First World War. He portrayed his fifth cousin, twice removed,[77] Major Talbot Mercer Papineau, who was killed on October 30, 1917, during the Battle of Passchendaele.[78] Trudeau is one of several children of former prime ministers who have become Canadian media personalities. The others are Ben Mulroney (son of Brian Mulroney), Catherine Clark (daughter of Joe Clark), and Trudeau's younger brother, Alexandre.[79] Ben Mulroney was a guest at Trudeau's wedding.[80] Trudeau and his family started the Kokanee Glacier Alpine Campaign for winter sports safety in 2000, two years after his brother Michel died in an avalanche during a ski trip.[81] In 2002, Trudeau criticized the Government of British Columbia's decision to stop its funding for a public avalanche warning system.[82][83] From 2002 to 2006, Trudeau chaired the Katimavik youth program, a project started by longtime family friend Jacques Hébert.[84][85] In 2002–03, Trudeau was a panelist on CBC Radio's Canada Reads series, where he championed The Colony of Unrequited Dreams by Wayne Johnston.[86][87] Trudeau and his brother Alexandre inaugurated the Trudeau Centre for Peace and Conflict Studies at the University of Toronto in April 2004; the centre later became a part of the Munk School of Global Affairs.[88] In 2006, he hosted the presentation ceremony for the Giller Prize for literature.[89][90] In 2005, Trudeau fought against a proposed $100-million zinc mine that he argued would poison the Nahanni River, a United Nations World Heritage Site located in the Northwest Territories. He was quoted as saying, \"The river is an absolutely magnificent, magical place. I'm not saying mining is wrong ... but that is not the place for it. It's just the wrong thing to be doing.\"[91][92] On September 17, 2006, Trudeau was the master of ceremonies at a Toronto rally organized by Roméo Dallaire that called for Canadian participation in resolving the Darfur crisis.[93][94][95] Trudeau supported the Liberal Party from a young age, offering his support to party leader John Turner in the 1988 federal election.[96] Two years later, he defended Canadian federalism at a student event at the Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf, which he attended.[97] Following his father's death, Trudeau became more involved with the Liberal Party throughout the 2000s. Along with Olympian Charmaine Crooks, he co-hosted a tribute to outgoing prime minister Jean Chrétien at the party's 2003 leadership convention, and was appointed to chair a task force on youth renewal after the party's defeat in the 2006 federal election.[98][99] In October 2006, Trudeau criticized Quebec nationalism by describing political nationalism generally as an \"old idea from the 19th century\", \"based on a smallness of thought\" and not relevant to modern Quebec. This comment was seen as a criticism of Michael Ignatieff, then a candidate in the 2006 Liberal Party leadership election, who was promoting recognition of Quebec as a nation.[100][101] Trudeau later wrote a public letter on the subject, describing the idea of Quebec nationhood as \"against everything my father ever believed\".[102][103] Trudeau announced his support for leadership candidate Gerard Kennedy shortly before the 2006 convention and introduced Kennedy during the candidates' final speeches.[104] When Kennedy dropped off after the second ballot, Trudeau joined him in supporting the ultimate winner, Stéphane Dion.[105][106] Rumours circulated in early 2007 that Trudeau would run in an upcoming by-election in the Montreal riding of Outremont. The Montreal newspaper La Presse reported despite Trudeau's keenness, Liberal leader Stéphane Dion wanted Outremont for a star candidate who could help rebuild the Liberal Party. Instead, Trudeau announced that he would seek the Liberal nomination in the nearby riding of Papineau for the next general election.[107][108][109] The riding, which had been held for 26 years by André Ouellet, a senior minister under his father, had been in Liberal hands for 53 years before falling to the Bloc Québécois in 2006.[110] On April 29, 2007, Trudeau won the Liberal party's nomination, picking up 690 votes to 350 for Deros and 220 for Giordano against Mary Deros, a Montreal city councillor and Basilio Giordano, the publisher of a local Italian-language newspaper.[111] Prime Minister Stephen Harper called an election for October 14, 2008, by which time Trudeau had been campaigning for a year in Papineau. On election day, Trudeau narrowly defeated Bloc Québécois incumbent Vivian Barbot.[112] Following his election win, Edward Greenspon, editor-in-chief of The Globe and Mail, noted that Trudeau would \"be viewed as few other rookie MPs are—as a potential future Prime Minister—and scrutinized through that lens\".[54] The Conservative Party won a minority government in the 2008 election, and Trudeau entered parliament as a member of the Official Opposition. Trudeau's first legislative act was a motion that called for the creation of a \"national voluntary service policy for young people\".[113] He later co-chaired the Liberal Party's April 2009 national convention in Vancouver, and in October of the same year he was appointed as the party's critic for multiculturalism and youth.[114] In September 2010, he was reassigned as critic for youth, citizenship, and immigration.[115] During that time, he criticized the government's legislation targeting human smuggling, which he argued would penalize the victims of smuggling.[116] Trudeau sparked controversy when it was revealed that he earned $1.3 million in public speaking fees from charities and school boards across Canada, $277,000 of which Trudeau received after becoming an MP.[117][118] He encouraged an increase of Canada's relief efforts after the 2010 Haiti earthquake, and sought more accessible immigration procedures for Haitians moving to Canada in the time of crisis. His own riding includes a significant Haitian community.[119] Trudeau was re-elected in Papineau in the 2011 federal election, as the Liberal Party fell to third-party standing in the House of Commons with only thirty-four seats. Ignatieff resigned as party leader immediately after the election, and rumours again circulated that Trudeau could run to become his successor. On this occasion, Trudeau said, \"I don't feel I should be closing off any options ... because of the history packaged into my name, a lot of people are turning to me in a way that ... to be blunt, concerns me.\"[120][121] Weeks after the election, Toronto MP Bob Rae was selected as the interim leader until the party's leadership convention, which was later decided to be held in April 2013. Rae appointed Trudeau as the party's critic for post-secondary education, youth and amateur sport.[122] After his re-election, he travelled the country hosting fundraisers for charities and the Liberal Party.[123][124][125][126] Trudeau wanted to take part in a charity boxing match on behalf of the cancer research fundraising event Fight for the Cure, but was having difficulty finding a Conservative opponent until Conservative senator Patrick Brazeau agreed when asked on Trudeau's behalf by their mutual hairdresser Stefania Capovilla.[127][128] The fight took place on March 31, 2012, at the Hampton Inn in Ottawa, and it was broadcast live on Sun News with commentary by Ezra Levant and Brian Lilley. Trudeau won in the third round; the result was considered an upset.[127][129] After Dion's resignation as Liberal leader in 2008, Trudeau's name was mentioned as a potential candidate with polls showing him as a favourite among Canadians for the position.[130][131] However, Trudeau did not enter the race and Michael Ignatieff was named leader in December 2008.[132] After the party's poor showing in the 2011 election, Ignatieff resigned from the leadership and Trudeau was again seen as a potential candidate to lead the party.[133] Following the election, Trudeau said he was undecided about seeking the leadership;[134] months later on October 12 at Wilfrid Laurier University, he announced he would not seek the post because he had a young family.[135] When interim leader Bob Rae, who was also seen as a frontrunner, announced he would not be entering the race in June 2012, Trudeau was hit with a \"tsunami\" of calls from supporters to reconsider his earlier decision to not seek the leadership.[136] Opinion polling conducted by several pollsters showed that if Trudeau were to become leader the Liberal Party would surge in support, from a distant third place to either being competitive with the Conservative Party or leading them.[137] In July 2012, Trudeau stated that he would reconsider his earlier decision to not seek the leadership and would announce his final decision at the end of the summer.[138][139] On September 26, 2012, multiple media outlets started reporting that Trudeau would launch his leadership bid the following week.[140][141] While Trudeau was seen as a frontrunner for the leadership of the Liberal Party, he was criticized for his perceived lack of substance.[142][143] During his time as a member of Parliament, he spoke little on policy matters and it was not known where he stood on many issues such as the economy and foreign affairs.[144][145] Some strategists and pundits believed the leadership would be the time for Trudeau to be tested on these issues; however, there was also fear within the party that his celebrity status and large lead might deter other strong candidates from entering the leadership race.[146][147][148] On October 2, 2012, Trudeau held a rally in Montreal to launch his bid for the leadership of the Liberal Party.[149] The core people on his campaign team were considered longtime friends, and all in their 30s and 40s. His senior advisor was Gerald Butts, the former president of WWF-Canada who had previously been principal secretary to former Ontario premier Dalton McGuinty. Other senior aides included campaign manager Katie Telford, and policy advisors Mike McNeir and Robert Asselin, who had all worked for recent Liberal Party leaders.[150] His brother Alexandre also took a break from his documentary work to be a senior advisor on Trudeau's campaign.[151] During the leadership campaign, three by-elections were held on November 26, 2012. The riding Calgary Centre was expected to be a three-way race between the Conservatives, Liberals and Green Party. A week before by-election day Sun Media reported on comments Trudeau had made in a 2010 interview with Télé-Québec, in which he said, \"Canada isn't doing well right now because it's Albertans who control our community and socio-democratic agenda.\" Trudeau's campaign advisor said that the comments were being brought up now because of the close race in Calgary Centre.[152] The following day, Trudeau apologized, saying he was wrong to use \"Alberta\" as \"shorthand\" in referring to Stephen Harper's government.[153] The Conservatives held onto Calgary Centre in the by-election by less than 1,200 votes. Liberal candidate Harvey Locke said he lost the by-election on his own and that comments made by Trudeau did not influence the outcome.[154] Fellow leadership candidate Marc Garneau, seen as Trudeau's main challenger in the race, criticized Trudeau for not releasing enough substantial policy positions. Garneau called on him to release more detailed policies before members and supporters begin to vote.[155] Garneau later challenged Trudeau to a one-on-one debate, and said that if Trudeau could not defend his ideas in a debate against him, he wouldn't be able to do so against Prime Minister Harper.[156] Trudeau clashed in debates with challenger Joyce Murray, who was the only Liberal leadership candidate to speak out strongly in favour of electing the House of Commons with a system of proportional representation. She challenged Trudeau over his support for a preferential ballot voting system.[157] On March 13, 2013, Garneau dropped out of the leadership race, saying that polling conducted by his campaign showed he would be unable to defeat Trudeau.[158][159] With Joyce Murray, the last challenger, receiving significant press time, more Liberal politicians and public figures declared themselves for Trudeau. Trudeau was declared the winner of the leadership election on April 14, 2013, garnering 80.1% of 30,800 votes.[160] Joyce Murray finished in second place with 10.2%, ahead of Martha Hall Findlay's 5.7%.[161] Trudeau had lost only five ridings, all to Murray and all in BC.[162] In the days following his victory in the leadership race, snapshot polls recorded a surge in support for the Liberal party.[164] In 2013, Trudeau chose to give up his seat at the funeral of Nelson Mandela, in deference to Irwin Cotler as representative of the Liberal Party of Canada, because of Cotler's work for and with Nelson Mandela in fighting apartheid.[165] During the leadership campaign, Trudeau pledged to park all his assets, exclusive of real estate holdings, into a blind trust which is atypical for opposition MPs, including leaders. According to documents obtained by the Ottawa Citizen, he fulfilled the pledge in July 2013 when the blind trust was set up by BMO Private Banking.[166] On January 27, 2014, Trudeau and MP Carolyn Bennett escorted Chrystia Freeland into the House of Commons, as is traditional for by-election victors.[167] Trudeau launched an internet video the week before the 2014 Liberal party convention titled \"An economy that benefits us all\" in which he narrates his economic platform. He said that Canada's debt to GDP ratios have come down in recent years and now it's time for Ottawa to \"step up\".[168] On October 19, 2015, after the longest official campaign in over a century, Trudeau led the Liberals to a decisive victory in the federal election. The Liberals won 184 of the 338 seats, with 39.5% of the popular vote, for a strong majority government;[169][170] a gain of 150 seats compared to the 2011 federal election.[169] This was the second-best performance in the party's history. The Liberals won mostly on the strength of a solid performance in the eastern half of the country. In addition to taking all of Atlantic Canada and Toronto,[169] they won 40 seats in Quebec—the most that the Liberals had won in that province since Trudeau's father led them to a near-sweep of the province in 1980, and also the first time since then that the Liberals won a majority of Quebec's seats in an election. The 150-seat gain was the biggest numerical increase for a single party since Confederation and marked the first time that a party had rebounded from third place in the Commons to a majority government. In addition to the appeal of his party's platform, Trudeau's success has been credited to his performance both on the campaign trail and televised leaders' debates exceeding the lowered expectations created by Conservative advertisements and conservative media outlets.[171][172][173] Trudeau declared victory shortly after CBC News projected that he had won a majority government. He began his speech with a reference to former Liberal prime minister Wilfrid Laurier's \"sunny ways\" (French: voies ensoleillées) approach to bringing Canadians together despite their differences. According to Trudeau, Laurier \"knew that politics can be a positive force, and that's the message Canadians have sent today\".[174] Harper announced his resignation as the leader of the Conservative Party that night.[175][176] Trudeau and the rest of the Cabinet were sworn in by Governor General David Johnston on November 4, 2015. He said that his first legislative priority was to lower taxes for middle-income Canadians and raise taxes for the top 1% of income earners after parliament was reconvened on December 3, 2015.[177] Trudeau also issued a statement promising to rebuild relations with Indigenous peoples in Canada and run an open, ethical and transparent government.[178] On November 5, 2015, during the first Liberal caucus meeting since forming a majority government, the party announced that it would reinstate the mandatory long-form census that had been scrapped in 2010, effective with the 2016 census.[179][180] As prime minister, Trudeau launched three major independent investigations: the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women (MMIWG), the Joint Federal/Provincial Commission into the 2020 Nova Scotia attacks (in partnership with the Government of Nova Scotia[181]), and the Public Inquiry into Foreign Interference in Federal Electoral Processes and Democratic Institutions. The latter was called in response to allegations of Chinese government interference in the 2019 and 2021 Canadian federal elections, but also deals with interference from other states deemed hostile to Canada.[182] The MMIWG investigation found that Canada's response to this issue amounts to genocide, a finding Trudeau said he accepted.[183] Trudeau was prime minister during the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic. His government's response to the pandemic included funds for provinces and territories to adapt to the new situation, funds for coronavirus research, travel restrictions, screening of international flights, self-isolation orders under the Quarantine Act, an industrial strategy, and a public health awareness campaign. Initially, Canada faced a shortage of personal protective equipment, as the Trudeau government had cut PPE stockpile funding in the previous years.[184][185] To deal with the economic impact of the pandemic in 2020, Trudeau waived student loan payments, increased the Canada Child Benefit, doubled the annual Goods and Services Tax payment, and introduced the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) as part of a first package in March. In April 2020, Trudeau introduced the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy, the Canada Emergency Business Account, and the Canada Emergency Student Benefit.[186] Trudeau also deployed the Canadian Forces in long-term care homes in Quebec and Ontario as part of Operation LASER.[187] Throughout the pandemic, the federal government was also responsible for the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines.[188] On May 12, 2020, the Trudeau government announced it had reached an exclusive deal with CanSino Biologics.[189] However, due to deteriorating Canadian-Chinese relations, the Cansino deal fell through.[190] On August 5, 2020, the Trudeau government created a plan to secure doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.[191] Starting in December 2020, Trudeau oversaw the implementation of Canada's mass-vaccination program.[192][188] The spread of COVID-19 in Canada continued beyond the initial outbreak, with a strong second wave in the fall of 2020 and an even more serious third wave in the spring of 2021.[193][194] Throughout the crisis, Trudeau periodically extended the scope and duration of the federal aid programs. The 2021 Canadian federal budget planned to phase them out by the end of September 2021, and projected a $354.2-billion deficit in the 2020–21 fiscal year.[195] While CERB was indeed phased out on September 26, the Canada Recovery Benefit (CBR) continued to provide support until October 23.[196] The Canada Worker Lockdown Benefit was introduced that month to replace the CBR, and expanded during the spread of the Omicron variant in December 2021.[197] The Canada convoy protest, called the Freedom Convoy, was a protest in Canada against COVID-19 vaccine requirements for truckers to re-enter the country by land introduced by the Government of Canada on January 15, 2022. Originally composed of several routes traversing all of the Canadian provinces, the truck convoys converged on Ottawa. On January 29, the first day of protest at Parliament Hill, Trudeau moved to an undisclosed location.[198][199] According to The Guardian, the demonstration developed to express a number of \"antigovernment grievances\", particularly against Trudeau.[200] On January 31, Trudeau called the protests an \"insult to truth\".[201] On February 3, he said that a military response was \"not in the cards right now\".[202] On February 11, Reuters reported that Trudeau promised the US \"quick action\" regarding protesters who have forcefully blocked the Ambassador Bridge on the US-Canada border, the continent's busiest land border crossing.\"[203] Trudeau subsequently indicated that there would be \"robust police intervention\" and called for all protesters to \"go home.\"[204] Trudeau invoked the Emergencies Act on February 14, 2022, for the first time since it was enacted in 1988, as a result of the public order emergency caused by the demonstrations in Ottawa.[205] On February 23, 2022, Trudeau announced that the federal government would revoke the emergency declaration. Later that day, the governor general signed a proclamation revoking it.[206][207] A year later, on February 17, 2023, a judicial inquiry into the use of the Emergencies Act concluded that the Trudeau government met the legal threshold required to invoke the act.[208] In early 2024, Federal Court judge Richard Mosley ruled that the federal government's invocation of the Emergencies Act to end the 2022 convoy protest was \"not justified\" and infringed on Charter rights. The federal government plans to appeal the ruling.[209][210] On September 11, 2019, Trudeau visited Governor General Julie Payette, to request the dissolution of Parliament, and formally triggering an election.[211] Prior to the formal start of the campaign, Trudeau announced his intention to only participate in the three leaders' debates, two organized by the Leaders' Debates Commission, and one organized by TVA.[212] Other leader's debates were either cancelled or took place with an empty podium left on stage for Trudeau.[213][214] In September 2019, controversial pictures and video were published showing Trudeau in brownface and blackface.[215] On September 18, 2019, Time magazine published a photograph of Trudeau wearing brownface makeup in the spring of 2001, at an Arabian Nights-themed gala, while Trudeau was a teacher at West Point Grey Academy.[216] Trudeau publicly apologized, agreeing the photo was racist and saying: \"I shouldn't have done that. I should have known better and I didn't. I'm really sorry.\"[217] He further went on to say \"It was something that I didn't think was racist at the time, but now I recognize it was something racist to do\".[218] Trudeau also admitted to wearing blackface makeup in high school while singing \"Day-O\" at a talent show that was subsequently published by Global News.[219] A third instance, a video, of Trudeau in racist dress was also published.[220] After this video was published, Trudeau admitted he could not remember how often he had worn blackface makeup.[221] In the days following the scandal, pollsters pointed out that many Canadians either were not bothered by the scandal or had accepted Trudeau's apology.[222][223][224][225] Additionally, some minority community groups, racialized commentators and some of Trudeau's opponents came to his defence.[226][227][228][229] Others were more critical, including members of his own party.[230] While Trudeau's Liberal Party lost 20 seats in the House of Commons (lowering its total from 177 to 157) from the time of dissolution, they still won the most seats of any party—enough to allow Trudeau to form a minority government.[231][232] For the first time since 1979, the party that garnered the largest share of the national popular vote did not win the most seats; the Liberals under Trudeau had 33.1% of the popular vote, while the Conservatives under Andrew Scheer had 34.4%.[233][234] On August 15, 2021, Trudeau advised Governor General Mary Simon to dissolve parliament, scheduling an election for September 20.[235] The election was called on the same day as the Fall of Kabul. In the first two weeks of the campaign, Trudeau received criticism for not acting fast enough in the face of the 2021 Taliban offensive to evacuate Canadian citizens and Afghans who supported Canada's military and diplomatic efforts during the War in Afghanistan.[236] In the 2021 federal election, Trudeau secured a third mandate and his second minority government after winning 160 seats. However, the Liberals came in second in the national popular vote, behind the Conservatives.[237] They received 32.6 percent of the popular vote, the lowest percentage of the national popular vote for a governing party in Canadian history.[238] On March 22, 2022, the Liberals and the NDP entered a confidence and supply agreement. The agreement, in which the NDP committed to supporting the Liberals in all votes of confidence for the duration of the 44th Parliament, included action towards key NDP priorities. The intent of the agreement was to avert any prospective early election prior to 2025 and to allow the minority Trudeau government to stay in power for the full four-year term of the parliament.[239] Among the policies included in the deal were the establishment of a national dental care program for low-income Canadians, progress towards a national pharmacare program, labour reforms for federally regulated workers, and new taxes on financial institutions.[239] In early 2024, the two parties reached an impasse over pharmacare, putting the deal in jeopardy. The agreement called for the development of the Canada Pharmacare Act by the end of 2023, setting out a framework for the system; however, the NDP had agreed to extend the deadline to March 1 of the following year as negotiations became fraught. Major points of contention included the NDP's demand that the system be single-payer, as well as preliminary coverage for certain drugs prior to the implementation of the full system.[240] On February 23, the parties reached an agreement, salvaging the deal. The agreement provided coverage for diabetes and contraceptive drugs ahead of the full program's launch.[241] In September 2024, the NDP pulled their support and ended the confidence and supply agreement.[242] NDP leader Jagmeet Singh said the Liberals had \"let people down\" and were \"too weak, too selfish and too beholden to corporate interests\" to fight for people,[243] while Trudeau stated he would continue to work for Canadians and not focus on politics.[244] On September 25, 2024, Trudeau survived a no-confidence vote brought by the Conservative Party.[245] Trudeau was criticized by opposition members in November 2016 for his fundraising tactics, which they saw as \"cash for access\" schemes.[246] Trudeau attended fundraisers where attendees paid upwards of $1500 for access to him and other cabinet members.[247][248] In some instances, the events were attended by foreign businessmen who needed government approval for their businesses.[249] Trudeau defended his fundraising tactics, saying that they were not in breach of any ethics rules. He also stated that he was lobbied at the fundraisers but not influenced.[248] In 2017, Trudeau introduced legislation that would eliminate such exclusive events by requiring increased transparency for political fundraisers.[250] In January 2017, the ethics commissioner, Mary Dawson, began an investigation into Trudeau for a vacation he and his family took to Aga Khan IV's private island in the Bahamas.[251][252] The ethics commissioner's report, released in December 2017, found that Trudeau had violated four provisions of the Conflict of Interest Act.[253] He became the first sitting prime minister to break federal conflict of interest rules.[254] In 2022, it was reported that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police had considered bringing criminal charges against Trudeau over the affair.[255] In February 2018, Trudeau was criticized when his government invited Khalistani nationalist Jaspal Atwal to the Canadian High Commission's dinner party in Delhi. Atwal had previously been convicted for the shooting and attempted murder of Indian Cabinet minister Malkiat Singh Sidhu in 1986, as well as the assault on former BC premier Ujjal Dosanjh in 1985. Following the dinner, the PMO rescinded the invitation, and apologized for the incident.[256][257][258][259] On February 8, 2019, The Globe and Mail reported that sources close to the government said that the Prime Minister's Office had allegedly attempted to influence Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould concerning an ongoing prosecution of SNC-Lavalin. When asked about the allegations, Trudeau said that the story in the Globe was false and that he had never \"directed\" Wilson-Raybould concerning the case.[260] Wilson-Raybould did not comment on the matter, citing solicitor-client privilege.[261] Soon after, Trudeau voluntarily waived privilege and cabinet confidences, permitting her to speak.[262] On February 11, the ethics commissioner announced the opening of an investigation into the allegations. Trudeau said he \"welcomed the investigation\".[263][264] The Justice Committee of the House of Commons has conducted a series of hearings on the alleged interference.[265][266][267] The investigation heard from several witnesses, including Jody Wilson-Raybould, who submitted as evidence a telephone call she secretly recorded between herself and Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick, which was subsequently released to the public.[268] On the recording, Wernick is heard asking to understand why the \"DPA route\" is not being used, stating that people were \"talking past each other\", and suggesting Trudeau obtain independent legal advice from former Supreme Court chief justice Beverly McLachlin. Wilson-Raybould is heard suggesting that Trudeau would be \"breaching a constitutional principle of prosecutorial independence\". On March 19, 2019, the Liberal committee members voted as a bloc to shut down the Justice Committee's investigation.[269] Trudeau was the subject of an investigation by the ethics commissioner, pursuant to the Conflict of Interest Act, in regards to criminal charges against SNC-Lavalin in the SNC-Lavalin affair. The commission's final report, issued August 14, 2019, concluded \"Mr. Trudeau contravened section 9 of the Act\".[270][271][272][273][274] Following complaints by opposition parties that the Trudeau family had ties to WE Charity, the ethics commissioner on July 3, 2020, announced an investigation into Trudeau's and the government's decision to have the charity administer a summer, student-grant program which could assist students financially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Trudeau responded by saying WE was the charity that had the capability to administer such a program. WE and the federal government decided to \"part ways\" leaving administration of the grant program to the federal government.[275][276][277] WE Charity was criticized for its close ties to the Trudeau family; the investigation came after revelations that Trudeau's mother, brother, and wife were paid nearly $300,000 in total to speak at WE Charity events.[278][279][280] On July 16, 2020, the ethics commissioner also announced the investigation was being expanded to include Finance Minister Bill Morneau.[281] Trudeau was ultimately cleared of any wrongdoing by the ethics commissioner though Morneau was found to have broken the conflict of interest law.[282] The Trudeau government's economic policy initially relied on increased tax revenues to pay for increased government spending. While the government has not balanced the budget, it reduced Canada's debt-to-GDP ratio every year until 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic hit.[283][284] Trudeau's self-described progressive and feminist social policy has included strong advocacy for abortion rights.[285] His government introduced the bill that made conversion therapies illegal in Canada.[286] After the 2015 election, Canada set targets to welcome an increased number of immigrants and refugees.[287][288] Despite warnings about the impact of increased immigration on housing and services, Trudeau's government allowed almost 1 million newcomers (permanent and temporary residents) in both 2022 and 2023.[289][290][291] Trudeau initiated measures to combat housing inflation: Foreign buyers were banned and the Housing Accelerator Fund was created. In Sept 2023, Trudeau stated housing prices were \"far too high\", but, in May 2024, during an interview with The Globe and Mail, Trudeau said, \"housing needs to retain its value.\"[292][293] In 2021, Trudeau touted his Child Benefit Program, claiming it had lifted 400,000 children out of poverty.[294] In 2024, food bank usage was at an all time high and more working people than ever were using food banks.[295] Canada introduced the right to medically-assisted dying in 2016.[296] and legalized cannabis for recreational use in 2018.[297] In 2021, Trudeau announced the creation of a national child care plan with the intention of reducing day care fees for parents down to $10 a day per child within five years.[298] In November 2022, the Trudeau government announced that Canada would admit 500,000 immigrants per year by 2025.[299] His environmental policy included introducing new commitments to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 30% before 2030, and to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.[300] His main tool for reaching this target is a federal carbon pricing policy.[301] Trudeau's parliament also adopted legislation for marine conservation,[302] banning six common single-use plastic products,[303] and strengthening environmental impact assessments.[304] Trudeau pledged to ban single use plastic in 2019. In the year 2022 his government announced a ban on producing and importing single use plastic from December 2022. The sale of those items will be banned from December 2023 and the export from 2025.[305] However, Trudeau is in favour of oil and gas pipelines to bring Canadian fossil fuel resources to foreign markets.[306] In 2015, Trudeau told the New York Times Magazine that Canada could be the \"first postnational state\".[307] In 2016, Trudeau lifted visa requirements for Mexican citizens. Asylum claims by Mexicans grew from 110 in 2015 to 24,000 in 2023. Visas and some restrictions were reinstated in 2024.[308][309] In January 2017, Trudeau wrote, \"To those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada,\" on Twitter. As a result, irregular border crossing increased, mainly at Roxham Road.[310][311] Increased strain on services in Quebec and Ontario, and criticism over the unsustainable influx of claimants, appeared to influence the decision to close Roxham Road in March 2023; however, the new terms of the Canada–United States Safe Third Country Agreement (STCA) had been arranged the previous year.[312] After irregular border crossings were shut down, asylum claims surged at airports.[313] Trudeau enjoyed good relations with the \"like-minded\" United States president Barack Obama,[314] despite Trudeau's support for the Keystone Pipeline, which was rejected by the Democratic president.[315] Trudeau's first foreign policy challenges included follow-through on his campaign promise to withdraw Canadian air support from the Syrian civil war[316] and to welcome 25,000 Syrian war refugees.[317] When Donald Trump became president, Canada-US relations deteriorated. The Trump administration forced the renegotiation of NAFTA to create the CUSMA, in which Canada made significant concessions in allowing increased imports of American milk, weakening Canada's dairy supply management system.[318][319] Donald Trump also implemented tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum, to which Trudeau retaliated by imposing tariffs on American steel, aluminum and a variety of other American products.[320] Canada's relationship with China also deteriorated during Trudeau's time as prime minister. The turmoil led to the arrest of Meng Wanzhou at the Vancouver International Airport in December 2018 at the behest of the United States,[321] and the arrest of Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig in China 12 days later.[322] Trudeau appointed Liberal advisor, Dominic Barton (McKinsey & Company, Century Initiative) ambassador to China in 2019. While Barton negotiated the release of Spavor and Kovrig, Canada-China trade reached historic highs. Barton resigned in December 2021, \"amidst growing pressure from...President Joe Biden for Ottawa to take a tougher stance with Beijing.\"[323] As Wanzhou, Spavor and Kovrig were released at the exact same time in September 2021, many observers speculated they were exchanged as part of a deal between the United States and China.[324] Trudeau greeted Spavor and Kovrig at the airport upon their repatriation. In 2024, Spavor was awarded $7 million in compensation for his arrest and detainment. Although Trudeau repeatedly claimed the two were arbitrarily targeted, it was later reported Spavor had unwittingly participated in espionage by sharing information on North Korea with Kovrig who then passed it onto the Canadian government.[325][326] In a similar fashion, Canada's relationship with Saudi Arabia was also put under strain, as human rights groups called on Trudeau to stop selling military equipment to that country under a deal struck by the Harper government. In 2018, Saudi Arabia recalled its Canadian ambassador and froze trade with the country in response to Canada's call for the Saudis to release opposition blogger Raif Badawi. However, in 2019, Canada doubled its weapons sales to Saudi Arabia, despite a \"moratorium on export permits following the killing of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi and mounting civilian deaths from the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen.\"[327] In September 2023, Trudeau said that the government of Canada had \"credible intelligence\" that the government of India was involved in the killing of a Canadian citizen, Hardeep Singh Nijjar, outside a Sikh temple in Surrey. This episode caused a rapid deterioration of Canada–India relations.[328] In 2020, Canada lost its bid to join the United Nations Security Council. This was the second time Canada had failed an attempt to join the Security Council, the first time being in 2009 under Prime Minister Stephen Harper.[329] In October 7, 2023, Trudeau condemned Hamas' actions during the Israel–Hamas war and expressed his support to Israel and its right to self-defence.[330] On October 24, he rejected calls for a ceasefire but said he supported \"humanitarian pauses\" to deliver aid to the people of the Gaza Strip.[331] On December 12, in a joint statement with the Prime Minister of Australia and the Prime Minister of New Zealand, Trudeau called for a \"sustainable ceasefire\" in the war.[332] Trudeau first met Sophie Grégoire when they were both children growing up in Montreal; Grégoire was a classmate and childhood friend of Trudeau's youngest brother, Michel.[333] They reconnected as adults in June 2003, when Grégoire, by then a Quebec television personality, was assigned as Trudeau's co-host for a charity ball; they began dating several months later. Trudeau and Grégoire became engaged in October 2004 and married on May 28, 2005, in a ceremony at Montreal's Sainte-Madeleine d'Outremont Church.[334] They have three children: a son, Xavier, a daughter, Ella-Grace, and a second son, Hadrien.[335] In June 2013, two months after Trudeau became the leader of the Liberal Party, the couple sold their home in the Côte-des-Neiges neighbourhood of Montreal.[336] They began living in a rented home in Ottawa's Rockcliffe Park, the neighbourhood near where Trudeau resided as a child during his father's time as prime minister.[336] On August 18, 2014, an intruder broke into the house while Grégoire and the couple's three children were sleeping and left a threatening note; however, nothing was stolen and there was no damage to the property. Following the incident, Trudeau, who was in Winnipeg at the time of the break-in, stated his intention to inquire with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police about his home security.[337] After his 2015 electoral victory, Trudeau opted to live at Rideau Cottage, on the grounds of Rideau Hall.[338] On August 2, 2023, Trudeau announced he and Grégoire had separated.[339] On August 21, Trudeau said he was focusing on his children and the future.[340] Trudeau's father was a devout Catholic[341] and his mother converted from Anglicanism to Catholicism just before their wedding.[342] Trudeau himself became a lapsed Catholic at age 18, as he felt that much of his day-to-day life was not addressed by the formality and structure of the church.[48][343] Trudeau described his faith during this period as \"like so many Catholics across this country, I said, 'OK, I'm Catholic, I'm of faith, but I'm just not really going to go to church. Maybe on Easter, maybe midnight Mass at Christmas.'\"[48][343] After the death of his brother Michel in 1998, Trudeau was persuaded by a friend to participate in an Alpha course, during which he regained his faith.[48][343] In 2011, Trudeau stated, \"My own personal faith is an extremely important part of who I am and the values that I try to lead with.\"[344] Bold indicates parties with members elected to the House of Commons.",

Justin studied literature at McGill University, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) in 1994. He went on to complete the University of British Columbia’s education program, and spent several years teaching French, math, and other subjects in Vancouver. Teaching allowed him to make a positive impact in the lives of young people. He remains committed to hearing the voices of young Canadians, from the classroom to Parliament Hill. Before entering politics, Justin served as the Chair of Katimavik, on the board of the Canadian Avalanche Foundation, and as an advocate for young people and the environment. As a speaker at events and conferences around the country, he encouraged young people to engage with the issues important to them and participate as active citizens. These experiences made it increasingly clear to him that the issues young Canadians care about – education, the environment, and their generation’s economic prospects – needed a stronger voice. Justin entered politics to make change that would better serve all Canadians. In 2007, he built a community-based, grassroots campaign to win the Liberal Party nomination in the Montréal riding of Papineau. He was elected in 2008, and re-elected in 2011, 2015, 2019, and 2021. Justin was elected Leader of the Liberal Party in April 2013. His leadership campaign focused on building a new, truly national movement of progressive Canadians, bringing hundreds of thousands of Canadians into politics, most for the first time. He worked closely with his team to build a plan to create jobs, grow the economy, protect the environment, and strengthen the middle class. With Justin’s leadership, the Liberal plan emphasized fair economic opportunity for everyone, respect for and promotion of freedom and diversity, and a more democratic government that truly represents Canadians. On October 19, 2015, Justin led his party to victory, winning a majority government with seats in every province and territory across the country. He was sworn in on November 4, 2015. On October 21, 2019, he led the Liberal Party to re-election, earning a second mandate from Canadians. On September 20, 2021, Justin once again led the party to re-election, earning a third mandate to govern from Canadians. As Prime Minister, Justin leads a government that works hard every day to continue moving Canada forward. His team is focused on creating good middle-class jobs, making life more affordable, keeping Canada’s communities safe, fighting climate change, and moving forward on reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples. A proud feminist, Justin appointed Canada’s first gender-balanced Cabinet.",

                "content": "Justin Pierre James Trudeau PC MP (born 25 December 1971) is a Canadian politician and former schoolteacher who is the 23rd and current Prime Minister of Canada since 2015. He is also the 14th Leader of the Liberal Party. He was elected leader on 14 April 2013.[2] He was also the 11th Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and Youth from 2015 to 2018. After leading his party to a majority government win in the 2015 federal election, Trudeau became the Prime Minister.[3][4] Since 2021, Trudeau is the senior G7 leader. Trudeau was born on 25 December 1971 at Ottawa Civic Hospital in Ottawa. He is the eldest son of former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. He is the second child in Canadian history to be born while one of his parents was prime minister; the first was John A. Macdonald's youngest daughter Margaret Mary Macdonald.[5] Trudeau was baptised with his father's niece Anne Rouleau-Danis as godmother and his mother's brother-in-law Thomas Walker as godfather,[6][7] at Ottawa's Notre Dame Basilica on 16 January 1972, which marked his first public appearance.[8] and given the names \"Justin Pierre James\".[9] On 14 April 1972, Trudeau's father and mother hosted a gala at the National Arts Centre, at which visiting U.S. president Richard Nixon said, \"I'd like to toast the future prime minister of Canada, to Justin Pierre Trudeau\" to which Pierre Trudeau responded that should his son ever assume the role, he hoped he would have \"the grace and skill of the president\".[10] Earlier that day, first lady Pat Nixon had visited him in his nursery and gifted him a stuffed toy Snoopy.[11][12] Trudeau earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in literature from McGill University and a Bachelor of Education degree from the University of British Columbia.[13] After he graduated, Trudeau worked as a social studies, drama, math and French elementary and high school teacher.[14] He taught at West Point Grey Academy and Sir Winston Churchill Secondary School in Vancouver, British Columbia.[13] Trudeau was elected for the first time in the 2008 federal election. He was the nominee for the Liberal Party in the electoral area of Papineau. He won more votes than the incumbent, Vivian Barbot of the Bloc Québécois.[15] On 19 October 2015, Trudeau and the Liberals won the most seats in the federal election. This was after one of the longest campaigns in over 100 years. The Liberals won 184 of the 338 seats in the House of Commons and 39.5% of the total vote. Because of this, they formed a majority government. Their seat count went up by 150 compared to the 2011 federal election.[16] The results were the second-best in the history of the Liberal Party. They did very well in the eastern half of Canada. They won all of the seats in Atlantic Canada and Toronto and won 40 seats in Quebec. In Quebec, they won the most seats since Pierre Trudeau's win in the 1980 election. It was also the first time since 1980 that the Liberals won more than half the seats in Quebec. The 150 seat gain was the biggest gain for any party in an election since Canadian Confederation. It was also the first time that a party went from third place in seat count to a majority government. Trudeau and the Cabinet he chose were sworn in by the Governor General David Johnston on 4 November 2015.[17] In 2022, he invoked the Emergencies Act in response to the Canada convoy protest, the first time the act was brought into force since it was enacted in 1988.[18] On 15 March 2024, Justin Trudeau was sued before the Ontario High Court for having illegally seized the bank accounts of protesters of the freedom convoys in 2022. Trudeau visited the Governor General, Julie Payette on 11 September 2019. This was to ask that Parliament be dissolved and new elections would begin.[19] For the first time since 1979, the party that won the largest share of the national popular vote did not win the most seats.[20] The Liberals under Trudeau had 33.1 per cent of the popular vote, while the Conservatives under Andrew Scheer had 34.4 per cent.[20][21] It was also the first time a government took power with less than 35 per cent of the national popular vote since 1867.[22] On 20 September 2021 Trudeau and the Liberal Party won re-election as the party won 160 seats, allowing them to form a minority government.[23] Trudeau first met his wife, Sophie Grégoire, when they were both children growing up in Montreal. Grégoire was a friend of Trudeau's brother, Michel.[24] They were married on 28 May 2005 in a Catholic wedding at the Sainte-Madeleine d'Outremont Church in Montreal.[25] On 2 August 2023, Trudeau and Grégoire's separation was announced.[26][27] They have three children together: a son, Xavier James Trudeau (born October 18, 2007), a daughter, Ella-Grace Margaret Trudeau (born 5 February 2009), and another son, Hadrien Grégoire Trudeau (born 28 February 2014).[28][29][30] On 12 March 2020, Trudeau and his wife Sophie Grégoire Trudeau isolated themselves, after she showed flu-like symptoms during the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic.[31] The Prime Minister's Office announced later that day that she had tested positive for COVID-19.[32] Trudeau · Macron · Scholz · Meloni · Ishiba · Starmer · Biden",

                "content": "Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. (/ˈrɒbɪnɪt ˈbaɪdən/ ⓘ ROB-in-it BY-dən; born November 20, 1942) is an American politician who has been the 46th and current president of the United States since 2021. A member of the Democratic Party, he served as the 47th vice president from 2009 to 2017 under President Barack Obama and represented Delaware in the U.S. Senate from 1973 to 2009. Born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, Biden moved with his family to Delaware in 1953. He received a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Delaware in 1965 and a Juris Doctor from Syracuse University in 1968. He was elected to the New Castle County Council in 1970 and the U.S. Senate in 1972. As a senator, Biden drafted and led the effort to pass the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act and the Violence Against Women Act. He also oversaw six U.S. Supreme Court confirmation hearings, including the contentious hearings for Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas. Biden ran unsuccessfully for the 1988 and 2008 Democratic presidential nominations. In 2008, Obama chose Biden as his running mate, and he was a close counselor to Obama during his two terms as vice president. In the 2020 presidential election, the Democratic Party nominated Biden for president. He selected Kamala Harris as his running mate, and they defeated Republican incumbents Donald Trump and Mike Pence. He became the oldest president in U.S. history and the first to serve with a female vice president. As president, Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent recession. He signed bipartisan bills on infrastructure and manufacturing. He proposed the Build Back Better Act, which failed in Congress, but aspects of which were incorporated into the Inflation Reduction Act that he signed into law in 2022. Biden appointed Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court. He worked with congressional Republicans to resolve the 2023 debt-ceiling crisis by negotiating a deal to raise the debt ceiling. In his foreign policy, Biden restored America's membership in the Paris Agreement. He oversaw the complete withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan that ended the war in Afghanistan, leading to the collapse of the Afghan government and the Taliban seizing control. He responded to the Russian invasion of Ukraine by imposing sanctions on Russia and authorizing civilian and military aid to Ukraine. During the Israel–Hamas war, Biden condemned the actions of Hamas as terrorism and sent military aid to Israel, as well as limited humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip. In April 2023, Biden announced his reelection campaign and, after the Democratic primaries, became the party's presumptive nominee in the 2024 presidential election. Concerns about Biden's age and health persisted throughout his term, with renewed scrutiny after his performance during the first presidential debate on June 27. On July 21, he withdrew his candidacy, becoming the first U.S. president to decline to seek reelection after securing enough delegates to win renomination. Biden endorsed Vice President Harris to be the Democratic presidential nominee. Harris won the nomination but lost the general election to Trump. Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. was born on November 20, 1942,[1] at St. Mary's Hospital in Scranton, Pennsylvania,[2] to Catherine Eugenia \"Jean\" Biden (née Finnegan; 1917–2010) and Joseph Robinette Biden Sr. (1915–2002)[3][4] The oldest child in a Catholic family of mostly Irish descent, along with English and French; he has a sister, Valerie, and two brothers, Francis and James. The Biden surname traces back to William Biden, an ancestor of his who emigrated from England to Maryland around 1820.[5] Biden's father had been wealthy and the family purchased a home in the affluent Long Island suburb of Garden City in the fall of 1946,[6] but he suffered business setbacks around the time Biden was seven years old,[7][8][9] and for several years the family lived with Biden's maternal grandparents in Scranton.[10] Scranton fell into economic decline during the 1950s and Biden's father could not find steady work.[11] Beginning in 1953 when Biden was ten,[12] the family lived in an apartment in Claymont, Delaware, before moving to a house in nearby Mayfield, Delaware.[13][14][8][10] Biden Sr. later became a successful used-car salesman, maintaining the family in a middle-class lifestyle.[10][11][15] At Archmere Academy in Claymont,[16] Biden played baseball and was a standout halfback and wide receiver on the high school football team.[10][17] Though a poor student, he was class president in his junior and senior years.[18][19] He graduated in 1961.[18] At the University of Delaware in Newark, Biden briefly played freshman football,[20][21] and, as an unexceptional student,[22] received a Bachelor of Arts degree with a double major in history and political science in 1965.[23][24] Biden had a stutter and has mitigated it since his early twenties.[25] He has described his efforts to reduce it by reciting poetry before a mirror.[19][26] Biden married Neilia Hunter, a student at Syracuse University, on August 27, 1966,[23][27] after overcoming her parents' disinclination for her to wed a Catholic. Their wedding was held in a Catholic church in Skaneateles, New York.[28] They had three children: Joseph R. \"Beau\" Biden III, Robert Hunter Biden, and Naomi Christina \"Amy\" Biden.[23] Biden earned a Juris Doctor from Syracuse University College of Law in 1968. In his first year of law school, he failed a course because he plagiarized a law review article for a paper he wrote, but the failing grade was later stricken. His grades were relatively poor, and he graduated 76th in a class of 85 students.[22] He was admitted to the Delaware bar in 1969.[1] Biden clerked at a Wilmington law firm headed by prominent local Republican William Prickett in 1968 and, he later said, \"thought of myself as a Republican\".[29][30] He disliked incumbent Democratic Delaware governor Charles L. Terry's conservative racial politics and supported a more liberal Republican, Russell W. Peterson, who defeated Terry in 1968.[29] Local Republicans attempted to recruit Biden, but he registered as an Independent because of his distaste for Republican presidential candidate Richard Nixon.[29] In 1969, Biden practiced law, first as a public defender and then at a law firm headed by a locally active Democrat,[31][29] who named him to the Democratic Forum, a group trying to reform and revitalize the state party;[32] Biden subsequently reregistered as a Democrat.[29] He and another attorney also formed a law firm.[31] Corporate law did not appeal to him, and criminal law did not pay well.[10] He supplemented his income by managing properties.[33] Biden ran for the 4th district seat on the New Castle County Council in 1970 on a liberal platform that included support for public housing in the suburbs.[34][35] The seat had been held by Republican Henry R. Folsom, who was running in the 5th District following a reapportionment of council districts.[36][37][38] Biden won the general election, defeating Republican Lawrence T. Messick, and took office on January 5, 1971.[39][40] He served until January 1, 1973, and was succeeded by Democrat Francis R. Swift.[41][42] During his time on the county council, Biden opposed large highway projects, which he argued might disrupt Wilmington neighborhoods.[42] Biden had not openly supported or opposed the Vietnam War until he ran for Senate and opposed Richard Nixon's conduct of the war.[43] While studying at the University of Delaware and Syracuse University, Biden obtained five student draft deferments at a time when most draftees were sent to the war. Based on a physical examination, he was given a conditional medical deferment in 1968; in 2008, a spokesperson for Biden said his having had \"asthma as a teenager\" was the reason for the deferment.[44] Biden defeated Republican incumbent J. Caleb Boggs to become the junior U.S. senator from Delaware in 1972. He was the only Democrat willing to challenge Boggs and, with minimal campaign funds, he was thought to have no chance of winning.[31][10] Family members managed and staffed the campaign, which relied on meeting voters face-to-face and hand-distributing position papers,[45] an approach made feasible by Delaware's small size.[33] He received help from the AFL-CIO and Democratic pollster Patrick Caddell.[31] His platform focused on the environment, withdrawal from Vietnam, civil rights, mass transit, equitable taxation, health care and public dissatisfaction with \"politics as usual\".[31][45] A few months before the election, Biden trailed Boggs by almost thirty percentage points,[31] but his energy, attractive young family, and ability to connect with voters' emotions worked to his advantage,[15] and he won with 50.5% of the vote.[45] A few weeks after Biden was elected senator, his wife Neilia and one-year-old daughter Naomi were killed in an automobile accident while Christmas shopping in Hockessin, Delaware, on December 18, 1972.[23][46] Neilia's station wagon was hit by a semi-trailer truck as she pulled out from an intersection. Their sons Beau (aged 3) and Hunter (aged 2) were in the car and were taken to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, Beau with a broken leg and other wounds and Hunter with a minor skull fracture and other head injuries.[47] Biden considered resigning to care for them,[15] but Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield persuaded him not to.[48] Biden contemplated suicide and was filled with anger and religious doubt.[49][50] He wrote that he \"felt God had played a horrible trick\" on him[51] and had trouble focusing on work.[52][53] Biden met teacher Jill Tracy Jacobs in 1975 on a blind date.[54] They married at the United Nations chapel in New York on June 17, 1977,[55][56] and spent their honeymoon at Lake Balaton in the Hungarian People's Republic.[57][58] Biden credits her with the renewal of his interest in politics and life.[59] The couple attends Mass at St. Joseph's on the Brandywine in Greenville, Delaware.[60][61][62] In 1981, the couple had a daughter, Ashley Biden.[23] She is a social worker and married to physician Howard Krein.[63] Jill helped raise her stepsons, Hunter and Beau, who were seven and eight respectively at the time of her marriage. Hunter has worked as a Washington lobbyist and investment adviser; his business dealings, personal life, and legal troubles have come under significant scrutiny during his father's presidency. In December 2024, Biden pardoned Hunter following his conviction on gun and tax charges despite repeated promises that he would not do so.[64][65][66][67] Beau became an Army judge-advocate in Iraq and later Delaware attorney general;[68] he died of brain cancer in 2015.[69][70] From 1991 to 2008, as an adjunct professor, Biden co-taught a seminar on constitutional law at Widener University School of Law.[71][72] He sometimes flew back from overseas to teach the class.[73][74][75] Secretary of the Senate Francis R. Valeo swore Biden in at the Delaware Division of the Wilmington Medical Center in January 1973.[76][47] Present were his sons Beau (whose leg was still in traction from the automobile accident) and Hunter and other family members.[76][47] At age 30, he was the seventh-youngest senator in U.S. history.[77] To see his sons, Biden traveled by train between his Delaware home and D.C.[78]—74 minutes each way—and maintained this habit throughout his 36 years in the Senate.[15] Elected to the U.S. Senate in 1972, Biden was reelected in 1978, 1984, 1990, 1996, 2002, and 2008, regularly receiving about 60% of the vote.[79] He was junior senator to William Roth, who was first elected in 1970, until Roth was defeated in 2000.[80] As of 2024[update], he was the 19th-longest-serving senator in U.S. history.[81] During his early years in the Senate, Biden focused on consumer protection and environmental issues and called for greater government accountability.[82] In a 1974 interview, he described himself as liberal on civil rights and liberties, senior citizens' concerns and healthcare, but conservative on other issues, including abortion and military conscription.[83] Biden was the first U.S. senator to endorse Jimmy Carter for president in the 1976 Democratic primary.[84] Carter went on to win the Democratic nomination and defeat incumbent Republican President Gerald Ford in the 1976 election. Biden also worked on arms control.[85][86] After Congress failed to ratify the SALT II Treaty signed in 1979 by Soviet general secretary Leonid Brezhnev and President Jimmy Carter, Biden met with Soviet foreign minister Andrei Gromyko to communicate American concerns and secured changes that addressed the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's objections.[87] He received considerable attention when he excoriated Secretary of State George Shultz at a Senate hearing for the Reagan administration's support of South Africa despite its continued policy of apartheid.[29] In a congressional hearing in 1984, he objected to the Strategic Defense Initiative plan to construct autonomous systems of ICBM defense.[88][89] In the mid-1970s, Biden was one of the Senate's strongest opponents of race-integration busing. His Delaware constituents strongly opposed it, and such opposition nationwide later led his party to mostly abandon school integration policies.[90] In his first Senate campaign, Biden had expressed support for busing to remedy de jure segregation, as in the South, but opposed its use to remedy de facto segregation arising from racial patterns of neighborhood residency, as in Delaware; he opposed a proposed constitutional amendment banning busing entirely.[91] Biden supported a 1976 measure forbidding the use of federal funds for transporting students beyond the school closest to them.[90] He co-sponsored a 1977 amendment closing loopholes in that measure, which President Carter signed into law in 1978.[92] Biden became ranking minority member of the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1981. He was a Democratic floor manager for the successful passage of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act in 1984. His supporters praised him for modifying some of the law's worst provisions, and it was his most important legislative accomplishment to that time.[93] In 1994, Biden helped pass the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, which included a ban on assault weapons,[94][95] and the Violence Against Women Act,[96] which he has called his most significant legislation.[97] The 1994 crime law was unpopular among progressives and criticized for resulting in mass incarceration;[98][99] in 2019, Biden called his role in passing the bill a \"big mistake\", citing its policy on crack cocaine and saying that the bill \"trapped an entire generation\".[100] Biden voted for a 1993 provision that deemed homosexuality incompatible with military life, thereby banning gay people from serving in the armed forces.[101][102] In 1996, he voted for the Defense of Marriage Act, which prohibited the federal government from recognizing same-sex marriages, thereby barring people in such marriages from equal protection under federal law and allowing states to do the same.[103] In 2015, the act was ruled unconstitutional in Obergefell v. Hodges.[104] Biden was critical of Independent Counsel Ken Starr during the 1990s Whitewater controversy and Lewinsky scandal investigations, saying \"it's going to be a cold day in hell\" before another independent counsel would be granted similar powers.[105] He voted to acquit during the impeachment of President Clinton.[106] During the 2000s, Biden sponsored bankruptcy legislation sought by credit card issuers.[15] Clinton vetoed the bill in 2000, but it passed in 2005 as the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act,[15] with Biden being one of only 18 Democrats to vote for it, while leading Democrats and consumer rights organizations opposed it.[107] As a senator, Biden strongly supported increased Amtrak funding and rail security.[79][108] In February 1988, after several episodes of increasingly severe neck pain, Biden underwent surgery to correct a leaking intracranial berry aneurysm.[109][110] While recuperating, he suffered a pulmonary embolism, a serious complication.[110] After a second aneurysm was surgically repaired in May,[110][111] his recuperation kept him away from the Senate for seven months.[112] Biden was a longtime member of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary. He chaired it from 1987 to 1995 and was a ranking minority member from 1981 to 1987 and again from 1995 to 1997.[113] As chair, Biden presided over two highly contentious U.S. Supreme Court confirmation hearings.[15] When Robert Bork was nominated in 1988, Biden reversed his approval‍—‌given in an interview the previous year‍—‌of a hypothetical Bork nomination. Conservatives were angered,[114] but at the hearings' close Biden was praised for his fairness, humor, and courage.[114][115] Rejecting the arguments of some Bork opponents,[15] Biden framed his objections to Bork in terms of the conflict between Bork's strong originalism and the view that the U.S. Constitution provides rights to liberty and privacy beyond those explicitly enumerated in its text.[115] Bork's nomination was rejected in the committee by a 5–9 vote[115] and then in the full Senate, 42–58.[116] During Clarence Thomas's nomination hearings in 1991, Biden's questions on constitutional issues were often convoluted to the point that Thomas sometimes lost track of them,[117] and Thomas later wrote that Biden's questions were akin to \"beanballs\".[118] After the committee hearing closed, the public learned that Anita Hill, a University of Oklahoma law school professor, had accused Thomas of making unwelcome sexual comments when they had worked together.[119][120] Biden had known of some of these charges, but initially shared them only with the committee because Hill was then unwilling to testify.[15] The committee hearing was reopened and Hill testified, but Biden did not permit testimony from other witnesses, such as a woman who had made similar charges and experts on harassment.[121] The full Senate confirmed Thomas by a 52–48 vote, with Biden opposed.[15] Liberal legal advocates and women's groups felt strongly that Biden had mishandled the hearings and not done enough to support Hill.[121] In 2019, he told Hill he regretted his treatment of her, but Hill said afterward she remained unsatisfied.[122] Biden was a longtime member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He became its ranking minority member in 1997 and chaired it from June 2001 to 2003 and 2007 to 2009.[123] His positions were generally liberal internationalist.[85][124] He collaborated effectively with Republicans and sometimes went against elements of his own party.[123][124] During this time he met with at least 150 leaders from 60 countries and international organizations, becoming a well-known Democratic voice on foreign policy.[125] Biden voted against authorization for the Gulf War in 1991,[124] siding with 45 of the 55 Democratic senators. He said the U.S. was bearing almost all the burden in the anti-Iraq coalition.[126] Biden became interested in the Yugoslav Wars after hearing about Serbian abuses during the Croatian War of Independence in 1991.[85] Once the Bosnian War broke out, Biden was among the first to call for the \"lift and strike\" policy.[85][123] The George H. W. Bush administration and Clinton administration were both reluctant to implement the policy, fearing Balkan entanglement.[85][124] In April 1993, Biden held a tense three-hour meeting with Serbian leader Slobodan Milošević.[127] Biden worked on several versions of legislative language urging the U.S. toward greater involvement.[127] Biden has called his role in affecting Balkan policy in the mid-1990s his \"proudest moment in public life\" related to foreign policy.[124] In 1999, during the Kosovo War, Biden supported the 1999 NATO bombing of FR Yugoslavia.[85] He and Senator John McCain co-sponsored the McCain-Biden Kosovo Resolution, which called on Clinton to use all necessary force, including ground troops, to confront Milošević over Yugoslav actions toward ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.[124][128] Biden was a strong supporter of the War in Afghanistan, saying, \"Whatever it takes, we should do it.\"[129] As head of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he said in 2002 that Iraqi president Saddam Hussein was a threat to national security and there was no other option than to \"eliminate\" that threat.[130] In October 2002, he voted in favor of the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq, approving the U.S. invasion of Iraq.[124] As chair of the committee, he assembled a series of witnesses to testify in favor of the authorization. They gave testimony grossly misrepresenting the intent, history, and status of Saddam and his secular government, which was an avowed enemy of al-Qaeda, and touted Iraq's fictional possession of weapons of mass destruction.[131] Biden eventually became a critic of the war and called his vote and role a \"mistake\", but did not push for withdrawal.[124][127] He supported the appropriations for the occupation, but argued that the war should be internationalized, that more soldiers were needed, and that the Bush administration should \"level with the American people\" about its cost and length.[123][128] By late 2006, Biden's stance had shifted considerably. He opposed the troop surge of 2007,[124][127] saying General David Petraeus was \"dead, flat wrong\" in believing the surge could work.[132] Biden instead advocated dividing Iraq into a loose federation of three ethnic states.[133] Rather than continue the existing approach or withdrawing, the plan called for \"a third way\": federalizing Iraq and giving Kurds, Shiites, and Sunnis \"breathing room\" in their own regions.[134] In September 2007, a non-binding resolution endorsing the plan passed the Senate,[135] but the idea failed to gain traction.[132] Biden formally declared his candidacy for the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination on June 9, 1987.[136] He was considered a strong candidate because of his moderate image, his speaking ability, his high profile as chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee at the upcoming Robert Bork Supreme Court nomination hearings, and his appeal to Baby Boomers; he would have been the second-youngest person elected president, after John F. Kennedy.[29][137][138] He raised more in the first quarter of 1987 than any other candidate.[137][138] By August his campaign's messaging had become confused due to staff rivalries,[139] and in September, he was accused of plagiarizing a speech by British Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock.[140] Biden's speech had similar lines about being the first person in his family to attend university. Biden had credited Kinnock with the formulation on previous occasions,[141][142] but did not on two occasions in late August.[143]: 230–232 [142] Kinnock himself was more forgiving; the two men met in 1988, forming an enduring friendship.[144] Earlier that year, Biden had also used passages from a 1967 speech by Robert F. Kennedy (for which his aides took blame) and a short phrase from John F. Kennedy's inaugural address; two years earlier he had used a 1976 passage by Hubert Humphrey.[145] Biden responded that politicians often borrow from one another without giving credit, and that one of his rivals for the nomination, Jesse Jackson, had called him to point out that he (Jackson) had used the same material by Humphrey that Biden had used.[15][22] A few days later, an incident was publicized in which, while in law school, Biden had taken text from a Fordham Law Review article with inadequate citations.[22] He was required to repeat the course and passed with high marks.[146] At Biden's request the Delaware Supreme Court's Board of Professional Responsibility reviewed the incident and concluded that he had violated no rules.[147] Biden has made several false or exaggerated claims about his early life: that he had earned three degrees in college, that he attended law school on a full scholarship, that he had graduated in the top half of his class,[148][149] and that he had marched in the civil rights movement.[150] The limited amount of other news about the presidential race amplified these disclosures[151] and on September 23, 1987, Biden withdrew his candidacy, saying it had been overrun by \"the exaggerated shadow\" of his past mistakes.[152] After exploring the possibility of a run in several previous cycles, in January 2007, Biden declared his candidacy in the 2008 elections.[79][153][154] During his campaign, Biden focused on the Iraq War, his record as chairman of major Senate committees, and his foreign-policy experience.[155] Biden was noted for his one-liners during the campaign; in one debate he said of Republican candidate Rudy Giuliani, \"There's only three things he mentions in a sentence: a noun, and a verb and 9/11.\"[156] Biden had difficulty raising funds, struggled to draw people to his rallies, and failed to gain traction against the high-profile candidacies of Obama and Senator Hillary Clinton.[157] He never rose above single digits in national polls of the Democratic candidates. In the first contest on January 3, 2008, Biden placed fifth in the Iowa caucuses, garnering slightly less than one percent of the state delegates.[158] He withdrew from the race that evening.[159] Despite its lack of success, Biden's 2008 campaign raised his stature in the political world.[160]: 336 In particular, it changed the relationship between Biden and Obama. Although they had served together on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, they had not been close: Biden resented Obama's quick rise to political stardom,[132][161] while Obama viewed Biden as garrulous and patronizing.[160]: 28, 337–338 Having gotten to know each other during 2007, Obama appreciated Biden's campaign style and appeal to working-class voters, and Biden said he became convinced Obama was \"the real deal\".[161][160]: 28, 337–338 Shortly after Biden withdrew from the presidential race, Obama privately told him he was interested in finding an important place for Biden in his administration.[162] In early August, Obama and Biden met in secret to discuss the possibility,[162] and developed a strong personal rapport.[161] On August 22, 2008, Obama announced that Biden would be his running mate.[163] The New York Times reported that the strategy behind the choice reflected a desire to fill out the ticket with someone with foreign policy and national security experience.[164] Others pointed out Biden's appeal to middle-class and blue-collar voters.[165][166] Biden was officially nominated for vice president on August 27 by voice vote at the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver.[167] Biden's vice-presidential campaigning gained little media attention, as the press devoted far more coverage to the Republican nominee, Alaska governor Sarah Palin.[168][169] Under instructions from the campaign, Biden kept his speeches succinct and tried to avoid offhand remarks, such as one he made about Obama's being tested by a foreign power soon after taking office, which had attracted negative attention.[170][171] Privately, Biden's remarks frustrated Obama. \"How many times is Biden gonna say something stupid?\", he asked.[160]: 411–414, 419 Obama campaign staffers called Biden's blunders \"Joe bombs\" and kept Biden uninformed about strategy discussions, which in turn irked Biden.[172] Relations between the two campaigns became strained for a month, until Biden apologized on a call to Obama and the two built a stronger partnership.[160]: 411–414 As the 2007–2008 financial crisis reached a peak in September 2008, and the proposed Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 became a major factor in the campaign, Biden voted for the $700 billion Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, which passed in the Senate, 74–25.[173] On October 2, he participated in the vice-presidential debate with Palin at Washington University in St. Louis. Post-debate polls found that while Palin exceeded many voters' expectations, Biden had won the debate overall. [174] On November 4, Obama and Biden were elected with 53% of the popular vote and 365 electoral votes to McCain and Palin's 173.[175][176][177] At the same time Biden was running for vice president, he was also running for reelection to the Senate,[178] as permitted by Delaware law.[79] On November 4, he was reelected to the Senate, defeating Republican Christine O'Donnell.[179] Having won both races, Biden made a point of not resigning from the Senate before he was sworn in for his seventh term in January 2009.[180] He cast his last Senate vote on January 15, supporting the release of the second $350 billion for the Troubled Asset Relief Program,[181] and resigned from the Senate later that day, after which Ted Kaufman took office as his successor.[182][183] In October 2010, Biden said Obama had asked him to remain as his running mate for the 2012 presidential election,[184] but with Obama's popularity on the decline, White House Chief of Staff William M. Daley conducted some secret polling and focus group research in late 2011 on the idea of replacing Biden on the ticket with Hillary Clinton.[185] The notion was dropped when the results showed no appreciable improvement for Obama,[185] and White House officials later said Obama himself had never entertained the idea.[186] Biden's May 2012 statement that he was \"absolutely comfortable\" with same-sex marriage gained considerable public attention in comparison to Obama's position, which had been described as \"evolving\".[187] Biden made his statement without administration consent, and Obama and his aides were quite irked, since Obama had planned to shift position several months later, in the build-up to the party convention.[172][188][189] Gay rights advocates seized upon Biden's statement,[188] and within days, Obama announced that he too supported same-sex marriage, an action in part forced by Biden's remarks.[190] Biden apologized to Obama in private for having spoken out,[191][192] while Obama acknowledged publicly it had been done from the heart.[188] The Obama campaign valued Biden as a retail-level politician, and he had a heavy schedule of appearances in swing states as the reelection campaign began in earnest in spring 2012.[193][194] An August 2012 remark before a mixed-race audience that Republican proposals to relax Wall Street regulations would \"put y'all back in chains\" once again drew attention to Biden's propensity for colorful remarks.[193][195][196] In the first presidential debate of the general election, President Obama's performance was considered surprisingly lackluster.[197] Time magazine's Joe Klein called it \"one of the most inept performances I've ever seen by a sitting president\".[198] Over the next few days, Obama's lead over Romney collapsed,[199] putting pressure on Biden to stop the bleeding with a strong showing against the Republican vice-presidential nominee, Paul Ryan.[200][201] Some political analysts considered Biden's performance against Ryan in the October 11 vice-presidential debate one of the best of his career[202][203] and a key factor in Obama's rebound in the polls and eventual victory over Romney.[204][205] The debate also became memorable for the popularization of Biden's use of the phrase \"a bunch of malarkey\" in response to an attack by Ryan on the administration's response to the September 11, 2012, attacks on the U.S. embassy in Benghazi.[206][207] Biden reused the phrase during his 2020 presidential campaign.[208] On November 6, Obama and Biden won reelection[209] over Romney and Ryan with 332 of 538 Electoral College votes and 51% of the popular vote.[210] Biden said he intended to eliminate some explicit roles assumed by George W. Bush's vice president, Dick Cheney, and did not intend to emulate any previous vice presidency.[211] He was sworn in as the 47th vice president of the United States on January 20, 2009.[212] He was the first vice president from Delaware[213] and the first Roman Catholic vice president.[214][215] Obama was soon comparing Biden to a basketball player \"who does a bunch of things that don't show up in the stat sheet\".[216] Biden visited Kosovo in May and affirmed the U.S. position that its \"independence is irreversible\".[217] Biden lost an internal debate to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton about sending 21,000 new troops to Afghanistan,[218][219] but his skepticism was valued,[220] and in 2009, Biden's views gained more influence as Obama reconsidered his Afghanistan strategy.[221] Biden visited Iraq about every two months,[132] becoming the administration's point man in delivering messages to Iraqi leadership about expected progress there.[220] More generally, overseeing Iraq policy became Biden's responsibility: Obama was said to have said, \"Joe, you do Iraq.\"[222] By 2012, Biden had made eight trips there, but his oversight of U.S. policy in Iraq receded with the exit of U.S. troops in 2011.[194][223] Biden oversaw infrastructure spending from the Obama stimulus package intended to help counteract the ongoing recession.[224] During this period, Biden was satisfied that no major instances of waste or corruption had occurred,[220] and when he completed that role in February 2011, he said the number of fraud incidents with stimulus monies had been less than one percent.[225] Biden's off-message response to a question in late April 2009, during the beginning of the swine flu outbreak, led to a swift retraction by the White House.[226] The remark revived Biden's reputation for gaffes.[227][221][228] Confronted with rising unemployment through July 2009, Biden acknowledged that the administration had \"misread how bad the economy was\", but maintained confidence the stimulus package would create many more jobs once the pace of expenditures picked up.[229] A hot mic picked up Biden telling Obama that his signing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was \"a big fucking deal\" on March 23, 2010. Despite their different personalities, Obama and Biden formed a friendship, partly based around Obama's daughter Sasha and Biden's granddaughter Maisy, who attended Sidwell Friends School together.[172] Members of the Obama administration said Biden's role in the White House was to be a contrarian and force others to defend their positions.[230] Rahm Emanuel, White House chief of staff, said that Biden helped counter groupthink.[216] Obama said, \"The best thing about Joe is that when we get everybody together, he really forces people to think and defend their positions, to look at things from every angle, and that is very valuable for me.\"[220] The Bidens maintained a relaxed atmosphere at their official residence in Washington, often entertaining their grandchildren, and regularly returned to their home in Delaware.[231] Biden campaigned heavily for Democrats in the 2010 midterm elections, maintaining an attitude of optimism in the face of predictions of large-scale losses for the party.[184] Following big Republican gains in the elections and the departure of White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel, Biden's past relationships with Republicans in Congress became more important.[232][233] He led the successful administration effort to gain Senate approval for the New START treaty.[232][233] In December 2010, Biden's advocacy for a middle ground, followed by his negotiations with Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell, were instrumental in producing the administration's compromise tax package that included a temporary extension of the Bush tax cuts.[233][234] The package passed as the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010. Obama delegated Biden to lead negotiations with Congress in March 2011 to resolve federal spending levels for the rest of the year and avoid a government shutdown.[235] The U.S. debt ceiling crisis developed over the next few months, but Biden's relationship with McConnell again proved key in breaking a deadlock and bringing about a deal to resolve it, in the form of the Budget Control Act of 2011, signed on August 2, 2011, the same day an unprecedented U.S. default had loomed.[236][237][238] Some reports suggest that Biden opposed proceeding with the May 2011 U.S. mission to kill Osama bin Laden,[194][239] lest failure adversely affect Obama's reelection prospects.[240][241] Obama named Biden to head the Gun Violence Task Force, created to address the causes of school shootings and consider possible gun control to implement in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, in December 2012.[242] Later that month, during the final days before the United States fell off the \"fiscal cliff\", Biden's relationship with McConnell again proved important as the two negotiated a deal that led to the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 being passed at the start of 2013.[243][244] It made many of the Bush tax cuts permanent but raised rates on upper income levels.[244] Biden was inaugurated to a second term on January 20, 2013, at a small ceremony at Number One Observatory Circle, his official residence, with Justice Sonia Sotomayor presiding (a public ceremony took place on January 21).[245] Biden played little part in discussions that led to the October 2013 passage of the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2014, which resolved the federal government shutdown of 2013 and the debt-ceiling crisis of 2013. This was because Senate majority leader Harry Reid and other Democratic leaders cut him out of any direct talks with Congress, feeling Biden had given too much away during previous negotiations.[246][247][248] Biden's Violence Against Women Act was reauthorized again in 2013. The act led to related developments, such as the White House Council on Women and Girls, begun in the first term, as well as the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault, begun in January 2014 with Biden and Valerie Jarrett as co-chairs.[249][250] He talked about sexual violence while introducing Lady Gaga at the 88th Academy Awards in 2016, receiving a standing ovation from the audience.[251] Biden favored arming Syria's rebel fighters.[252] As the ISIL insurgency in Iraq intensified in 2014, renewed attention was paid to the Biden-Gelb Iraqi federalization plan of 2006, with some observers suggesting Biden had been right all along.[253][254] Biden himself said the U.S. would follow ISIL \"to the gates of hell\".[255] Biden had close relationships with several Latin American leaders and was assigned a focus on the region during the administration; he visited the region 16 times during his vice presidency, the most of any president or vice president.[256] In August 2016, Biden visited Serbia, where he met with the Serbian Prime Minister, Aleksandar Vučić, and expressed his condolences for civilian victims of the bombing campaign during the Kosovo War.[257] Biden never cast a tie-breaking vote in the Senate, making him the longest-serving vice president with this distinction.[258] During his second term, Biden was often said to be preparing for a bid for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination.[259] With his family, many friends, and donors encouraging him in mid-2015 to enter the race, and with Hillary Clinton's favorability ratings in decline at that time, Biden was reported to again be seriously considering the prospect and a \"Draft Biden 2016\" PAC was established.[259][260][261] By late 2015, Biden was still uncertain about running. He felt his son Beau's recent death had largely drained his emotional energy, and said, \"nobody has a right ... to seek that office unless they're willing to give it 110% of who they are.\"[262] On October 21, speaking from a podium in the Rose Garden with his wife and Obama by his side, Biden announced his decision not to run for president in 2016.[263][264][265] After leaving the vice presidency, Biden became an honorary professor at the University of Pennsylvania, developing the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement. Biden remained in that position into 2019, before running for president.[266][267] In 2017, Biden wrote a memoir, Promise Me, Dad, and went on a book tour.[268] By 2019, he and his wife reported that they had earned over $15 million since the end of his vice presidency from speaking engagements and book sales.[269] Biden remained in the public eye, endorsing candidates while continuing to comment on politics, climate change, and the presidency of Donald Trump.[270][271][272] He also continued to speak out in favor of LGBT rights, continuing advocacy on an issue he had become more closely associated with during his vice presidency.[273][274] In 2018, he gave a eulogy for Senator John McCain, praising McCain's embrace of American ideals and bipartisan friendships.[275] Biden continued to support cancer research.[276] Between 2016 and 2019, media outlets often mentioned Biden as a likely candidate for president in 2020.[277] When asked if he would run, he gave varied and ambivalent answers, saying \"never say never\".[278] A political action committee known as Time for Biden was formed in January 2018, seeking Biden's entry into the race.[279] He finally launched his campaign on April 25, 2019,[280] saying he was prompted to run because he was worried by the Trump administration and felt a \"sense of duty\".[281] As the 2020 campaign season heated up, voluminous public polling showed Biden as one of the best-performing Democratic candidates in a head-to-head matchup against President Trump.[282][283][284] With Democrats keenly focused on \"electability\" for defeating Trump,[285] this boosted his popularity among Democratic voters.[286] It also made Biden a frequent target of Trump.[287][288] In September 2019, it was reported that Trump had pressured Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy to investigate alleged wrongdoing by Biden and his son Hunter Biden.[289] Despite the allegations, no evidence was produced of any wrongdoing by the Bidens.[290][291][292] Trump's pressure to investigate the Bidens was perceived by many as an attempt to hurt Biden's chances of winning the presidency.[293] Trump's alleged actions against Biden resulted in a political scandal[294] and Trump's impeachment by the House of Representatives for abuse of power and obstruction of congress.[295] In March 2019 and April 2019, eight women accused Biden of previous instances of inappropriate physical contact, such as embracing, touching or kissing.[296] Biden had previously called himself a \"tactile politician\" and admitted this behavior had caused trouble for him.[297] Journalist Mark Bowden described Biden's lifelong habit of talking close, writing that he \"doesn't just meet you, he engulfs you... scooting closer\" and leaning forward to talk.[298] In April 2019, Biden pledged to be more \"respectful of people's personal space\".[299] Throughout 2019, Biden stayed generally ahead of other Democrats in national polls.[300][301] Despite this, he finished fourth in the Iowa caucuses, and eight days later, fifth in the New Hampshire primary.[302][303] He performed better in the Nevada caucuses, reaching the 15% required for delegates, but still finished 21.6 percentage points behind Bernie Sanders.[304] Making strong appeals to Black voters on the campaign trail and in the South Carolina debate, Biden won the South Carolina primary by more than 28 points.[305] After the withdrawals and subsequent endorsements of candidates Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar, he made large gains in the March 3 Super Tuesday primary elections. Biden won 18 of the next 26 contests, putting him in the lead overall.[306] Elizabeth Warren and Mike Bloomberg soon dropped out, and Biden expanded his lead with victories over Sanders in four states on March 10.[307] In late March 2020, Tara Reade, one of the eight women who in 2019 had accused Biden of inappropriate physical contact, accused Biden of having sexually assaulted her in 1993.[308] There were inconsistencies between Reade's 2019 and 2020 allegations.[308][309] Biden and his campaign denied the sexual assault allegation.[310][311] When Sanders suspended his campaign on April 8, 2020, Biden became the Democratic Party's presumptive nominee for president.[312] On April 13, Sanders endorsed Biden in a live-streamed discussion from their homes.[313] Former president Barack Obama endorsed Biden the next day.[314] On August 11, Biden announced U.S. senator Kamala Harris of California as his running mate, making her the first African American and first South Asian American vice-presidential nominee on a major-party ticket.[315] On August 18, 2020, Biden was officially nominated at the 2020 Democratic National Convention as the Democratic Party nominee for president in the 2020 election.[316][317] Biden was elected the 46th president of the United States in November 2020. He defeated the incumbent, Donald Trump, becoming the first candidate to defeat a sitting president since Bill Clinton defeated George H. W. Bush in 1992. Trump refused to concede, insisting the election had been \"stolen\" from him through \"voter fraud\", challenging the results in court and promoting numerous conspiracy theories about the voting and vote-counting processes, in an attempt to overturn the election results.[318] Biden's transition was delayed by several weeks as the White House ordered federal agencies not to cooperate.[319] On November 23, General Services Administrator Emily W. Murphy formally recognized Biden as the apparent winner of the 2020 election and authorized the start of a transition process to the Biden administration.[320] On January 6, 2021, during Congress's electoral vote count, Trump told supporters gathered in front of the White House to march to the Capitol and refused to concede the election.[321] Soon after, some of his supporters attacked the Capitol. During the attack, Biden addressed the nation, calling the events \"an unprecedented assault unlike anything we've seen in modern times\".[322][323] After the Capitol was cleared, Congress resumed its joint session and officially certified the election results with Vice President Mike Pence, in his capacity as President of the Senate, declaring Biden and Harris the winners.[324] Biden was inaugurated as the 46th president of the United States on January 20, 2021.[325][326] At 78, he was the oldest person to have assumed the office.[325][327] He is the second Catholic president (after John F. Kennedy)[328][329] and the first president whose home state is Delaware.[330] He is also the first man since George H. W. Bush to have been both vice president and president, and the second non-incumbent vice president (after Richard Nixon in 1968) to be elected president.[331] He is also the first president from the Silent Generation.[332][333] Biden's inauguration was \"a muted affair unlike any previous inauguration\" due to COVID-19 precautions as well as massively increased security measures because of the January 6 United States Capitol attack. Trump did not attend, becoming the first outgoing president since 1869 to not attend his successor's inauguration.[334] In his first two days as president, Biden signed 17 executive orders. By his third day, orders had included rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement, ending the state of national emergency at the border with Mexico, directing the government to rejoin the World Health Organization, face mask requirements on federal property, measures to combat hunger in the United States,[335][336][337][338] and revoking permits for the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline.[339][340][341] On March 11, the first anniversary of COVID-19 having been declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization, Biden signed into law the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, a $1.9 trillion economic stimulus and relief package that he had proposed to support the United States' recovery from the economic and health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.[342] The package included direct payments to most Americans, an extension of increased unemployment benefits, funds for vaccine distribution and school reopenings, and expansions of health insurance subsidies and the child tax credit. Biden's initial proposal included an increase of the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour, but after the Senate parliamentarian determined that including the increase in a budget reconciliation bill would violate Senate rules, Democrats declined to pursue overruling her and removed the increase from the package.[343][344][345] Also in March, amid a rise in migrants entering the U.S. from Mexico, Biden told migrants, \"Don't come over.\" In the meantime, migrant adults \"are being sent back\", Biden said, in reference to the continuation of the Trump administration's Title 42 policy for quick deportations.[346] Biden earlier announced that his administration would not deport unaccompanied migrant children; the rise in arrivals of such children exceeded the capacity of facilities meant to shelter them (before they were sent to sponsors), leading the Biden administration in March to direct the Federal Emergency Management Agency to help.[347] On April 14, Biden announced that the United States would delay the withdrawal of all troops from the war in Afghanistan until September 11, signaling an end to the country's direct military involvement in Afghanistan after nearly 20 years.[348] In February 2020, the Trump administration had made a deal with the Taliban to completely withdraw U.S. forces by May 1, 2021.[349] Biden's decision met with a wide range of reactions, from support and relief to trepidation at the possible collapse of the Afghan government without American support.[350] On April 22–23, Biden held an international climate summit at which he announced that the U.S. would cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 50%–52% by 2030 compared to 2005 levels. Other countries also increased their pledges.[351][352] On April 28, the eve of his 100th day in office, Biden delivered his first address to a joint session of Congress.[353] On June 17, Biden signed the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act, which officially declared Juneteenth a federal holiday.[354] Juneteenth is the first new federal holiday since 1983.[355][356][357] In July 2021, amid a slowing of the COVID-19 vaccination rate in the country and the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant, Biden said that the country has \"a pandemic for those who haven't gotten the vaccination\" and that it was therefore \"gigantically important\" for Americans to be vaccinated.[358] In 2022, Biden endorsed a change to the Senate filibuster to allow for the passing of the Freedom to Vote Act and John Lewis Voting Rights Act, on both of which the Senate had failed to invoke cloture.[359] The rules change failed when two Democratic senators, Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, joined Senate Republicans in opposing it.[360] In April 2022, Biden signed into law the bipartisan Postal Service Reform Act of 2022 to revamp the finances and operations of the United States Postal Service agency.[361] In the summer of 2022, several other pieces of legislation Biden supported passed Congress. The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act aimed to address gun reform issues following the Robb Elementary School shooting in Uvalde, Texas.[362] The act's gun control provisions include extended background checks for gun purchasers under 21, clarification of Federal Firearms License requirements, funding for state red flag laws and other crisis intervention programs, further criminalization of arms trafficking and straw purchases, and partial closure of the boyfriend loophole.[363][364][365] Biden signed the bill on June 25, 2022.[366] The Honoring our PACT Act of 2022 was introduced in 2021 and signed into law by Biden on August 10, 2022.[367] The act intends to significantly improve healthcare access and funding for veterans who were exposed to toxic substances, including burn pits, during military service.[368] In 2022, Biden signed the Respect for Marriage Act, which repealed the Defense of Marriage Act and requires the federal government to recognize the validity of same-sex and interracial marriages.[369] In June 2024, Biden issued an executive action offering amnesty to unauthorized immigrants married to American citizens. The program included a pathway to U.S. residency and citizenship and was expected to initially affect about 500,000 people. It was later struck down due to a lack of legislation empowering the president to enact the program.[370][371] Biden entered office nine months into a recovery from the COVID-19 recession and his first year in office was characterized by robust growth in real GDP, employment, wages, and stock market returns, amid significantly elevated inflation. Real GDP grew 5.9%, the fastest rate in 37 years.[372][373] Amid record job creation, the unemployment rate fell at the fastest pace on record during the year.[374][375][376] By the end of 2021, inflation reached a nearly 40-year high of 7.1%, which was partially offset by the highest nominal wage and salary growth in at least 20 years.[377][378][379][380] In his third month in office, Biden signed an executive order to increase the minimum wage for federal contractors to $15 per hour, an increase of nearly 37%. The order went into effect for 390,000 workers in January 2022.[381][382] Amid a surge in inflation and high gas prices, Biden's approval ratings declined, with his disapproval rating surpassing his approval rating in early 2022.[384][385][386] After 5.9% growth in 2021, real GDP growth cooled in 2022 to 2.1%, after slightly negative growth in the first half spurred recession concerns. Job creation and consumer spending remained strong through the year, as the unemployment rate fell to match a 53-year low of 3.5% in December. Inflation peaked at 9.1% in June before easing to 3.2% by October 2023. Stocks had had their worst year since 2008[387][388][389] before recovering. Widespread predictions of an imminent recession did not materialize in 2022 or 2023, and by late 2023 indicators showed sharply lower inflation with economic acceleration. GDP growth hit 4.9% in the third quarter of 2023 and the year ended with stocks near record highs, with robust holiday spending.[390][391][392] Biden signed numerous major pieces of economic legislation in the 117th Congress, including the American Rescue Plan, Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, CHIPS and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act.[393] He signed the CHIPS and Science Act into law on August 9, 2022.[394] It provided billions of dollars in new funding to boost domestic research on and manufacture of semiconductors, to compete economically with China.[395] In 2022, Biden blocked a national railroad strike planned by multiple labor unions.[396] During the United Auto Workers strike, he expressed support for the workers in negotiations.[397] Biden joined striking UAW workers' picket line in Michigan, becoming the first president to join a picket line.[398] He refused to block a port strike from the International Longshoremen's Association in October 2024.[399] Over the course of five days in March 2023, three small- to mid-size U.S. banks failed, triggering a sharp decline in global bank stock prices and swift response by regulators to prevent potential global contagion. After Silicon Valley Bank collapsed, the first to do so, Biden expressed opposition to a bailout by taxpayers.[400] He claimed that the partial rollback of Dodd-Frank regulations contributed to the bank's failure.[401] At the beginning of the 118th Congress, Biden and congressional Republicans engaged in a standoff after the U.S. hit its debt limit, which raised the risk that the U.S. would default on its debt.[402] Biden and House speaker Kevin McCarthy struck a deal to raise the debt limit, the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, which suspended the debt limit until January 2025. Biden signed it on June 3, averting a default.[403] The deal was generally seen as favorable to Biden.[404][405] Biden extended the COVID-19 student loan pause through September 2023, with an \"on ramp\" period that extended some of the pause's protections against credit reporting, collection efforts, and late payment fees through September 30, 2024.[406] The Biden administration's attempts to implement student loan forgiveness and relief programs have faced legal challenges from a coalition of Republican-led states.[407] By the end of 2021, 40 of Biden's nominees to the federal judiciary had been confirmed, more than any president in his first year in office since Ronald Reagan.[408] Biden has prioritized diversity in his judicial appointments more than any president in U.S. history, with most of his appointees being women and people of color.[409] In January 2022, Supreme Court justice Stephen Breyer, a moderate liberal nominated by Bill Clinton, announced his intention to retire from the Supreme Court. During his 2020 campaign, Biden vowed to nominate the first Black woman to the Supreme Court if a vacancy occurred,[410] a promise he reiterated after Breyer announced his retirement.[411] On February 25, Biden nominated federal judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court.[412] She was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on April 7[413] and sworn in on June 30.[414] By May 2024, Biden had confirmed more than 200 federal judges, about two-thirds of them women.[415] In July 2024, during a speech at the LBJ Presidential Library, Biden expressed interest in judicial term limits and a binding ethics code for Supreme Court justices.[416] As part of Biden's Build Back Better agenda, in late March 2021, he proposed the American Jobs Plan, a $2 trillion package addressing issues including transport infrastructure, utilities infrastructure, broadband infrastructure, housing, schools, manufacturing, research and workforce development.[417][418] After months of negotiations among Biden and lawmakers, in August 2021 the Senate passed a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill called the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act,[419][420] while the House, also in a bipartisan manner, approved that bill in early November 2021, covering infrastructure related to transport, utilities, and broadband.[421] Biden signed the bill into law in mid-November 2021.[422] The other core part of the Build Back Better agenda was the Build Back Better Act, a $3.5 trillion social spending bill that expands the social safety net and includes major provisions on climate change.[423][424] The bill did not have Republican support, so Democrats attempted to pass it on a party-line vote through budget reconciliation, but struggled to win the support of Senator Joe Manchin, even as the price was lowered to $2.2 trillion.[425] After Manchin rejected the bill,[426] the Build Back Better Act's size was reduced. It was comprehensively reworked into the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, covering deficit reduction, climate change, healthcare, and tax reform.[427] The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was introduced by senators Chuck Schumer and Joe Manchin.[428][429] The package aimed to raise $739 billion and authorize $370 billion in spending on energy and climate change, $300 billion in deficit reduction, three years of Affordable Care Act subsidies, prescription drug reform to lower prices, and tax reform.[430] According to an analysis by the Rhodium Group, the bill will lower U.S. greenhouse gas emissions between 31 percent and 44 percent below 2005 levels by 2030.[431] On August 7, 2022, the Senate passed the bill (as amended) on a 51–50 vote, with all Democrats voting in favor, all Republicans opposed, and Vice President Kamala Harris breaking the tie. The bill was passed by the House on August 12[431] and was signed by Biden on August 16.[432][433] Before and during the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26), Biden promoted an agreement that the U.S. and the European Union cut methane emissions by a third by 2030 and tried to add dozens of other countries to the effort.[434] Biden pledged to double climate funding to developing countries by 2024.[435] Also at COP26, the U.S. and China reached a deal on greenhouse gas emission reduction. The two countries are responsible for 40 percent of global emissions.[436] In July 2023, when the 2023 heat waves hit the U.S., Biden announced several measures to protect the population and said the heat waves were linked to climate change.[437][438] In April 2024, Biden unveiled a plan to protect and restore natural water sources (3.2 million hectares of wetlands and 161,000 km of rivers and streams).[439] Illegal border crossings at the Mexico–United States border began to surge in 2021 when Biden assumed office,[440][441][442][443] following a pandemic-era lull, amid a global rise in migration. From 2021 to 2023, they increased to record highs, reaching an all-time monthly high in December 2023.[444][445] Throughout 2024, crossings began to significantly decline from the December record, after Biden implemented restrictions on asylum claims from migrants who cross the border between ports of entry and urged Mexico to crack down on migrants.[446][447][448] He has also used humanitarian parole to an unprecedented degree to mitigate illegal border crossings, allowing migrants to fly into the U.S. or schedule their entries through official entry points in the U.S.-Mexico border. Over a million migrants have been admitted to the U.S. under humanitarian parole as of January 2024.[449][450][451] In January 2024, Biden expressed support for a proposed bipartisan immigration deal led by Senators Kyrsten Sinema and James Lankford.[452][453] The proposed bill would allow DHS to close the border when encounters reach a seven-day average of 5,000 or exceed 8,500 in a single day.[454][455] In addition, the bill mandates the detention of migrants seeking asylum and undergoing asylum interviews, with those failing the process repatriated to their home countries.[456] While not addressing the status of \"Dreamers\", it would change immigration law to allow the children of those with H-1B visas to get work authorizations and freeze their legal ages while waiting for green cards, rather than face deportation once they hit age 21, and would provide additional funding for immigration judges.[457] In late January, former president Donald Trump announced his opposition to the legislation, calling on Congressional Republicans to oppose it; subsequently, leaders such as Speaker of the House Mike Johnson announced their opposition, halting further legislative action.[458][459] As a result of continued high immigration levels throughout his tenure, some lawmakers and pundits have criticized Biden's handling of the southern border.[460][461][462] Criticism of the bill and broader immigration policy continued to be expressed by both sides, with some liberals considering his policies too harsh while some conservatives considered them too lax.[463][464] In the final year of his presidency, the Biden administration worked to extend at least 14 contracts with private prison companies to run immigrant detention centers, despite his 2020 campaign promise to end the practice.[465] On October 6, 2022, Biden pardoned all Americans convicted of \"small\" amounts of cannabis possession under federal law.[466] On December 22, 2023, he pardoned Americans of cannabis use or possession on federal lands regardless of whether they had been charged or prosecuted.[467][468] On December 12, 2024, in what became the largest single-day clemency act in history, Biden granted clemency to about 1,500 non-violent felons in home confinement who had previously been released from prison.[469][470] The act generated controversy as it included felons such as Michael Conahan, a judge involved in the kids for cash kickback scandal, and Rita Crundwell, a comptroller responsible for the single largest municipal fraud in US history. The Biden administration stated that the offenders who received clemency \"deserve a second chance\" and were decided based on meeting certain criteria in a uniform decision.[471][472] On December 1, 2024, Joe Biden issued a \"full and unconditional\" pardon for Hunter Biden that covered all federal offenses Hunter committed or may have committed between January 1, 2014, and December 1, 2024. The pardon's sweeping extent was \"unprecedented\",[473] with legal experts citing Richard Nixon as the only other person given similar terms for a pardon, for his tenure as president from 1969 to 1974.[474][475][476][64] According to Reason magazine, Hunter Biden's pardon was even more far-reaching than Nixon's or other \"controversial\"[473] pardons: The Hunter pardon is far more comprehensive...in that it covered not just his convictions for drug-related activities and tax fraud, but any other criminal behavior since 2014—the year that Hunter joined the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma. It has been alleged that Hunter's job was essentially to trade on the family name and sell his access to dad. This may not have been illegal, but it does mean that the pardon is clearly designed to offer preemptive protection not just to Hunter, but to Joe Biden himself. These features make the pardon unprecedented, though perfectly in line with the president's executive powers. Hunter had been convicted on charges related to tax and gun offenses, after which Joe made numerous clear promises not to pardon him. He and his staff continued to say that there would be no pardon for Hunter as late as November, although internal staff discussions affirmed that the option of a pardon remained on the table even as Biden promised otherwise.[477][478][64] The ultimate decision for the pardon was finalized by Biden and his family, without consulting senior staff.[479] In an official statement announcing the pardon, Biden said he believed his son was \"selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted\", blaming \"political pressure\" for the collapse of a plea bargain. The plea bargain actually fell apart after the presiding judge asked about its unusual construction.[67][480][481] Biden's pardon came amidst incoming December sentencing dates for Hunter on his convictions and concerns about the succeeding Trump administration potentially targeting political rivals for prosecution.[479] No future president can rescind the pardon.[482] Biden also said, \"I hope Americans will understand why a father and a president would come to this decision.\"[482] Critics called out the pardon for seeming self-serving and corrupt.[483][484] On September 2, 2022, in a nationally broadcast Philadelphia speech, Biden called for a \"battle for the soul of the nation\". Off camera, he called Trump supporters \"semi-fascists\", which Republican commentators denounced.[485][486][487] A predicted Republican wave election did not materialize and the race for U.S. Congress control was much closer than expected, with Republicans securing a slim majority of 222 seats in the House of Representatives,[488][489][490][491] and the Democratic caucus keeping control of the U.S. Senate, with 51 seats, a gain of one seat from the last Congress.[492][b] It was the first midterm election since 1986 in which the party of the incumbent president achieved a net gain in governorships, and the first since 1934 in which the president's party lost no state legislative chambers.[496] Democrats credited Biden for their unexpectedly favorable performance,[497] and he celebrated the results as a strong day for democracy.[498] In June 2021, Biden took his first trip abroad as president. In eight days he visited Belgium, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. He attended a G7 summit, a NATO summit, and an EU summit, and held one-on-one talks with Russian president Vladimir Putin.[499] In September 2021, Biden announced AUKUS, a security pact between Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States, to ensure \"peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific over the long term\"; the deal included nuclear-powered submarines built for Australia's use, undercutting a prior Australian contract for submarines with France.[500] In February 2021, the Biden administration announced that the United States was ending its support for the Saudi-led bombing campaign in Yemen and revoked the designation of Yemen's Houthis as terrorists.[501][502] In early February 2022, Biden ordered the counterterrorism raid in northern Syria that resulted in the death of Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurashi, the second leader of the Islamic State.[503] In late July, Biden approved the drone strike that killed Ayman al-Zawahiri, the second leader of Al-Qaeda, and an integral member in the planning of the September 11 attacks.[504] The 2022 OPEC+ oil production cut caused a diplomatic spat with Saudi Arabia, widening the rift between the two countries, and threatening a longstanding alliance.[505][506] In August 2024, Biden negotiated and oversaw the 2024 Ankara prisoner exchange, the largest prisoner exchange since the end of the Cold War. It involved the release of 26 people, including American journalist Evan Gershkovich and former United States Marine Paul Whelan. In November 2024, the Biden administration announced that it had helped broker a ceasefire agreement in the Israel–Hezbollah conflict. American forces began withdrawing from Afghanistan in 2020, under the provisions of a February 2020 US-Taliban agreement that set a May 1, 2021, deadline.[507] The Taliban began an offensive on May 1.[508][509] By early July, most American troops in Afghanistan had withdrawn.[349] Biden addressed the withdrawal in July, saying, \"The likelihood there's going to be the Taliban overrunning everything and owning the whole country is highly unlikely.\"[349] On August 15, the Afghan government collapsed under the Taliban offensive, and Afghan President Ashraf Ghani fled the country.[349][510] Biden reacted by ordering 6,000 American troops to assist with evacuating American personnel and Afghan allies.[511] He faced bipartisan criticism for the manner of the withdrawal,[512] with the evacuations described as chaotic and botched.[513][514][515] On August 16, Biden addressed the \"messy\" situation, taking responsibility for it, and admitting that the situation \"unfolded more quickly than we had anticipated\".[510][516] He defended his decision to withdraw, saying that Americans should not be \"dying in a war that Afghan forces are not willing to fight for themselves\".[516][517] On August 26, a suicide bombing at the Kabul airport killed 13 U.S. service members and 169 Afghans. On August 27, an American drone strike killed two ISIS-K targets, who were \"planners and facilitators\", according to a U.S. Army general.[518] On August 29, another American drone strike killed ten civilians, including seven children. The Defense Department initially claimed the strike was conducted on an Islamic State suicide bomber threatening Kabul Airport, but admitted the suspect was harmless on September 17, calling its killing of civilians \"a tragic mistake\".[519] The U.S. military completed withdrawal from Afghanistan on August 30. Biden called the extraction of over 120,000 Americans, Afghans and other allies \"an extraordinary success\".[520] He acknowledged that up to 200 Americans who wanted to leave did not, despite his August 18 pledge to keep troops in Afghanistan until all Americans who wanted to leave had left.[521] After the withdrawal, the U.S. continued to send aid to Afghanistan, remaining the country's biggest aid donor as of August 2024 and spending at least $20.7 billion post-withdrawal. U.S. funding has helped support the Taliban government and stabilize Afghanistan's economy.[522][523] In February 2022, the Russian Armed Forces under President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. After warning for several weeks that an attack was imminent, Biden responded to the invasion by imposing severe sanctions on Russia and authorizing over $8 billion in weapons shipments to Ukraine.[524][525][526] On April 29, he asked Congress for $33 billion for Ukraine,[527][528] but lawmakers later increased it to about $40 billion.[529][530][531] Biden blamed Putin for the emerging energy and food crises.[532][533][534] On February 20, 2023, four days before the anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Biden visited Kyiv and met with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.[535] While there, he promised more military aid to Ukraine and denounced the war.[536][537][538] In 2022, Congress approved about $113 billion in aid to Ukraine.[539] In October 2023, the Biden administration requested an additional $61.4 billion in aid for Ukraine for the year ahead,[540] but delays in the passage of further aid by the House of Representatives inhibited progress, with the additional $61 billion in aid to Ukraine added in April 2024.[541][542][543] Throughout the conflict, Biden has consistently refused Ukrainian requests to allow them to utilize weapons against Russian military targets inside Russia. An exception was granted in May 2024 for targets in the vicinity of Kharkiv for \"counter-fire\" purposes.[544][545][546][547] The Solomon Islands-China security pact caused alarm in late 2022, as China could build military bases across the South Pacific. Biden sought to strengthen ties with Australia and New Zealand in the wake of the deal, as Anthony Albanese succeeded to the premiership of Australia and Jacinda Ardern's government took a firmer line on Chinese influence.[548][549][550] In a September 2022 interview with 60 Minutes, Biden said that U.S. forces would defend Taiwan in the event of \"an unprecedented attack\" by the Chinese,[551] which is in contrast to the long-standing U.S. policy of \"strategic ambiguity\" toward China and Taiwan.[552][553][554] The September comments came after three previous comments by Biden that the U.S. would defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion.[555] Amid increasing tension with China, Biden's administration has repeatedly walked back his statements and asserted that U.S. policy toward Taiwan has not changed.[555][556][552] In late 2022, Biden issued several executive orders and federal rules designed to slow Chinese technological growth, and maintain U.S. leadership over computing, biotech, and clean energy.[557] On February 4, 2023, Biden ordered the United States Air Force to shoot down a suspected Chinese surveillance balloon off the coast of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.[558][559] The State Department said the balloon carried antennas and other equipment capable of geolocating communications signals, and similar balloons from China have flown over more than 40 nations.[560] The Chinese government denied that the balloon was a surveillance device, instead claiming it was a civilian (mainly meteorological) airship that had blown off course.[561][562] Secretary of State Antony Blinken postponed his planned visit to China as the incident further damaged U.S.-China relations.[563][564][565] In May 2024, the Biden administration doubled tariffs on solar cells imported from China and more than tripled tariffs on lithium-ion electric vehicle batteries imported from China.[566] It also raised tariffs on imports of Chinese steel, aluminum, and medical materials.[566] In October 2023, Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel that devolved into an intensified conflict, jeopardizing the administration's push to normalize relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia.[567] Biden stated his unequivocal support for Israel and condemned the attack by Hamas.[568] He deployed aircraft carriers in the region to deter others from joining the war,[569] and called for an additional $14 billion in military aid to Israel.[570] He later began pressuring Israel to address the growing humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip.[571] Biden rejected calls for a ceasefire but said he supported \"humanitarian pauses\" to deliver aid to the people of the Gaza Strip.[572] He asked Israel to pause its invasion of Gaza for at least three days to allow for hostage negotiations; Israel agreed to daily four-hour pauses.[573] He also directed the U.S. military to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Gaza.[574] Biden has said he is a Zionist.[575][576] He has faced criticism for his unwavering support for Israel. Officials have urged him to take a harder stance against Israel, criticizing his administration's leniency and support despite the Israeli government's contentious offensive, which has led to significant civilian casualties and humanitarian crises.[577][578][579] Following the killing of Palestinian civilians receiving food aid on February 29, 2024, Biden said the current level of aid flowing into Gaza was insufficient.[580] On March 3, the U.S. military began airdropping food aid into Gaza.[581] Several experts called the U.S. airdrops performative and said they would do little to alleviate the famine in Gaza.[582] As of May 2024, Biden has continued to support Israel during the course of the war despite significant domestic opposition to American involvement in it and subsequent widespread protests. A March 2024 Gallup poll found that a strong majority of Americans disapproved of Israeli conduct during the war.[583] It found that 36% approved \"of the military action Israel has taken in Gaza\" and 55% disapproved.[583] Young Americans have been significantly less supportive of Israel than older generations.[584][585] Beginning in April 2024, widespread Israel–Hamas war protests emerged on university campuses, denouncing Biden.[586] On May 31, 2024, Biden announced his support for an Israeli ceasefire proposal, saying that Hamas was \"no longer capable\" of another large-scale attack.[587][588][589] The proposal, which would establish a permanent ceasefire, release all hostages, and reconstruct the Gaza Strip, was supported by Hamas officials after mediation by Egypt and Qatar.[590][591] The Netanyahu administration responded that Israel's goals regarding \"the destruction of Hamas military and governing capabilities\" had not changed and that conditions would need to be met before it would agree to a ceasefire.[592][593][594] In the first year of the war, it was estimated that the Biden administration had sent Israel at least $17.9 billion in military aid, a record.[595] In about the same period, it sent Palestinians $1.2 billion in humanitarian aid.[596] Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Biden expressed support for expanding NATO to cover Sweden and Finland.[597][598] On August 9, 2022, he signed the instruments of ratification stipulating U.S. support for the two countries' entry into NATO.[599][600] Finnish ascension occurred on April 4, 2023, but opposition by Turkey and Hungary to Swedish entry led to a stalemate.[601] Biden led diplomatic talks resulting in formal Swedish ascension into NATO on March 7, 2024.[602][603] He has also expressed openness to Ukrainian entry into NATO following the end of the conflict,[604] supporting an expedited timetable in its ascension and the removal of steps such as the Membership Action Plan typically required for NATO entry.[605][606] On November 2, 2022, while packing files at the Penn Biden Center, Biden's attorneys found classified documents dating from his vice presidency in a \"locked closet\".[607][608] According to the White House, the documents were reported that day to the U.S. National Archives, which recovered them the next day.[608] On November 14, Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed U.S. attorney John R. Lausch Jr. to conduct an investigation.[609][610] On December 20, a second batch of classified documents was discovered in the garage of Biden's Wilmington, Delaware residence.[611] The findings broke news on January 9, 2023, after CBS News published an article on the Lausch investigation.[608][612][613] On January 12, Garland appointed Robert K. Hur as special counsel to investigate \"possible unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents or other records\".[614] On January 20, after a 13-hour consensual search by FBI investigators, six more items with classified markings were recovered from Biden's Wilmington residence.[615] FBI agents searched Biden's home in Rehoboth Beach on February 1 and collected papers and notes from his time as vice president, but did not find any classified information.[616] On February 8, 2024, Hur concluded the special counsel investigation and announced that no charges would be brought against Biden.[617] On January 11, 2023, the House of Representatives launched an investigative committee into the foreign business activities of Biden's son, Hunter, and brother, James.[618] The committee's chair, Representative James Comer, simultaneously investigated alleged corruption related to the Hunter Biden laptop controversy.[619] On September 12, House speaker Kevin McCarthy initiated a formal impeachment inquiry against Biden, saying that the recent House investigations \"paint a picture of corruption\" by Biden and his family.[620][621][622][623] Congressional investigations, most notably by the House Oversight committee, have discovered no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden as of December 2023.[624][625][626][627] On December 13, 2023, the House of Representatives voted 221–212 to formalize an impeachment inquiry into Biden.[628][629][630] In February 2024, Alexander Smirnov, a former intelligence informant who was prominent in the bribery allegations against Biden, was charged with making false statements to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).[631] Smirnov admitted he had publicized a false story given to him by Russian intelligence officials with the goal of damaging Biden's reelection campaign.[632][633][634] Ending months of speculation,[635][636] on April 25, 2023, Biden confirmed he would run for reelection as president in the 2024 election, with Harris again as his running mate. The campaign launched four years to the day after the start of his 2020 presidential campaign.[637] On the day of his announcement, a Gallup poll found that Biden's approval rating was 37 percent, with most of those surveyed saying the economy was their biggest concern.[638] During his campaign, Biden promoted higher economic growth and recovery following the COVID-19 pandemic.[639][640] He frequently stated his intention to \"finish the job\" as a political rallying cry.[637][641][642] U.S. Representative Dean Phillips ran against Biden in the 2024 Democratic presidential primaries.[643] Biden was not on the ballot in the January 23 New Hampshire primary, but won it in a write-in campaign with 63.8% of the vote to Phillips's 19.6%.[644] He had wanted South Carolina to be the first primary, and won that state on February 3 with 96.2% of the vote.[645] Biden received 89.3% of the vote in Nevada and 81.1% of the vote in Michigan, with \"none of these candidates\" and \"uncommitted\" coming in second in each state, respectively. On March 5 (\"Super Tuesday\"), he won 15 of 16 primaries, netting 80% or more of the vote in 13 of them.[646][647] On March 6, Phillips suspended his campaign and endorsed Biden.[648] On March 12, Biden reached more than the 1,968 delegates needed to win the Democratic nomination, becoming the presumptive nominee.[649][650] The first presidential debate was held on June 27, 2024, between Biden and Trump. Biden's performance was widely criticized, with commentators saying he frequently lost his train of thought and gave meandering answers.[651][652][653] Several newspaper columnists declared Trump the winner,[654][655][656][657] and polling indicated the majority of debate watchers believed Trump won.[658] After the debate raised questions about his health and age, Biden faced calls to withdraw from the race, including from fellow Democrats[659] and the editorial boards of several major news outlets.[660][661] Biden initially insisted that he would remain a candidate,[662] but on July 21, he withdrew his candidacy, writing that this was \"in the best interest of my party and the country\".[663][664] He endorsed Harris as his successor.[665][666] His announcement came 29 days before the beginning of the 2024 Democratic National Convention.[667][668] On August 6, 2024, Harris was confirmed as the Democratic presidential nominee after securing 99% of the delegates in a virtual roll call vote.[669] This was the first time an eligible incumbent had declined to run for reelection since Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968.[670] In the general election, Trump defeated Harris, flipping six states Biden had won in 2020. The Senate went Republican for the first time since 2018. In a nationally televised speech after the election, Biden congratulated Trump and promised a \"peaceful and orderly\" transition of power.[671] As a senator, Biden was regarded as a moderate Democrat.[672] As a presidential nominee, Biden's platform had been called the most progressive of any major party platform in history, although not within his party's ideological vanguard.[673] Biden says his positions are deeply influenced by Catholic social teaching.[674][675][676] According to political scientist Carlo Invernizzi Accetti, \"it has become second nature to describe his politics with such ready-made labels as centrist or moderate.\"[677] Accetti says that Biden represents an Americanized form of Christian democracy, taking positions characteristic of both the center-right and center-left.[677] Biden has cited the Catholic philosopher Jacques Maritain, credited with starting the Christian democratic movement, as immensely influential in his thinking.[678] Other analysts have likened his ideology to traditional liberalism, \"a doctrine of liberty, equality, justice and individual rights that relies, in the modern age, on a strong federal government for enforcement\".[679][680] Such analysts distinguish liberals, who believe in a regulated market economy, from the left, who believe in greater economic intervention or a planned economy.[679][680] In 2022, journalist Sasha Issenberg wrote that Biden's \"most valuable political skill\" was \"an innate compass for the ever-shifting mainstream of the Democratic Party\".[681] Biden has proposed partially reversing the corporate tax cuts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, saying that doing so would not hurt businesses' ability to hire.[682][683] He supported raising the corporate tax only up to 28% from the 21% established in the 2017 bill, not back to 35%, the corporate tax rate until 2017.[684] He voted for the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).[685] as well as the Trans-Pacific Partnership.[686] Biden is a staunch supporter of the Affordable Care Act (ACA).[687][688] He has promoted a plan to expand and build upon it, paid for by revenue gained from reversing some Trump administration tax cuts.[687] Biden's plan aims to expand health insurance coverage to 97% of Americans, including by creating a public health insurance option.[689] Biden did not support national same-sex marriage rights while in the Senate and voted for the Defense of Marriage Act,[690] but opposed proposals for constitutional amendments that would have banned same-sex marriage nationwide.[691] Biden has supported same-sex marriage since 2012.[103][692] As a senator, Biden forged deep relationships with police groups and was a chief proponent of a Police Officer's Bill of Rights measure that police unions supported but police chiefs opposed.[693][694] In 2020, Biden also ran on decriminalizing cannabis,[695] after advocating harsher penalties for drug use as a U.S. senator.[696][697] Biden believes action must be taken on climate change. As a senator, he co-sponsored the Boxer–Sanders Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act, the most stringent climate bill in the United States Senate.[698] Biden supports nature conservation. According to a report from the Center for American Progress, he broke several records in this domain.[699] He took steps to protect old-growth forests.[700] Biden opposes drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.[701] He wants to achieve a carbon-free power sector in the U.S. by 2035 and stop emissions completely by 2050.[702] His program includes reentering the Paris Agreement, green building and more.[703] Biden supports environmental justice, including climate justice and ocean justice.[704][705] A major step is increasing energy efficiency, water efficiency and resilience to climate disasters in low-income houses for mitigate climate change, reduce costs, improve health and safety.[706][707] Biden has called global temperature rise above the 1.5 degree limit the \"only existential threat humanity faces even more frightening than a nuclear war\".[708] Despite his clean energy policies and congressional Republicans characterizing them as a \"War on American Energy\", domestic oil production reached a record high in October 2023.[709] Biden has said the U.S. needs to \"get tough\" on China, calling it the \"most serious competitor\" that poses challenges to the United States' \"prosperity, security, and democratic values\".[710][711] Biden has spoken about human rights abuses in the Xinjiang region to the Chinese Communist Party leader Xi Jinping, pledging to sanction and commercially restrict Chinese government officials and entities who carry out repression.[712][713] Biden has said he is against regime change but is for providing non-military support to opposition movements.[714] He opposed direct U.S. intervention in Libya,[715][230] voted against U.S. participation in the Gulf War,[716] voted in favor of the Iraq War,[717] and supports a two-state solution in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.[718] Biden has pledged to end U.S. support for the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen and to reevaluate the United States' relationship with Saudi Arabia.[271] Biden supports extending the New START arms control treaty with Russia to limit the number of nuclear weapons deployed by both sides.[719][720] In 2021, Biden officially recognized the Armenian genocide, becoming the first U.S. president to do so.[721][c] Biden has supported abortion rights throughout his presidency, though he personally opposes abortion because of his Catholic faith.[724][725] In 2019, he said he supported Roe v. Wade and repealing the Hyde Amendment.[726][727] After Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, he criticized near-total bans on abortion access passed in a majority of Republican-controlled states,[728] and took measures to protect abortion rights in the United States.[729] He has vowed to sign a bill codifying the protections of Roe into federal law; such a bill passed the House in 2022, but was unable to clear the Senate filibuster.[730][731] Biden was consistently ranked one of the least wealthy members of the Senate,[732][733] which he attributed to having been elected young.[734] Feeling that less-wealthy public officials may be tempted to accept contributions in exchange for political favors, he proposed campaign finance reform measures during his first term.[93] As of November 2009[update], Biden's net worth was $27,012.[735] By November 2020[update], the Bidens were worth $9 million, largely due to sales of Biden's books and speaking fees after his vice presidency.[736][737] Political columnist David S. Broder wrote that Biden has grown over time: \"He responds to real people—that's been consistent throughout. And his ability to understand himself and deal with other politicians has gotten much, much better.\"[33] Journalist James Traub has written that \"Biden is the kind of fundamentally happy person who can be as generous toward others as he is to himself\".[132] In recent years, especially after the 2015 death of his elder son Beau, Biden has been noted for his empathetic nature and ability to communicate about grief.[738][739] In 2020, CNN wrote that his presidential campaign aimed to make him \"healer-in-chief\", while The New York Times described his extensive history of being called upon to give eulogies.[740] Journalist and TV anchor Wolf Blitzer has called Biden loquacious;[741] journalist Mark Bowden has said that he is famous for \"talking too much\", leaning in close \"like an old pal with something urgent to tell you\".[298] He often deviates from prepared remarks,[742] and sometimes \"puts his foot in his mouth\".[168][743][744] Biden has a reputation for being prone to gaffes,[745] and in 2018 called himself \"a gaffe machine\".[746][747] The New York Times wrote that Biden's \"weak filters make him capable of blurting out pretty much anything\".[168] According to The New York Times, Biden often embellishes elements of his life or exaggerates, a trait also noted by The New Yorker in 2014.[748][749] For instance, he has claimed to have been more active in the civil rights movement than he actually was, and has falsely recalled being an excellent student who earned three college degrees.[748] The Times wrote, \"Mr. Biden's folksiness can veer into folklore, with dates that don't quite add up and details that are exaggerated or wrong, the factual edges shaved off to make them more powerful for audiences.\"[749] Biden is the oldest sitting president in U.S. history.[750] During his presidency, Republicans and media pundits have raised questions about his cognitive health in reaction to his public speaking. These narratives were amplified and widely covered by the media after his weak performance in a June 2024 presidential debate.[751] Biden has repeatedly said he is fit for the presidency.[752] On July 21, 2022, Biden tested positive for COVID-19 with reportedly mild symptoms.[753][754] According to the White House, he was treated with Paxlovid.[754][755] He worked in isolation in the White House for five days[756] and returned to isolation when he tested positive again on July 30, 2022.[757][758] On July 17, 2024, Biden again tested positive for COVID-19.[759][760] According to Morning Consult polling, Biden maintained an approval rating above 50% during his presidency's first eight months. In August 2021, it began to decline, reaching the low forties by December.[761] This was attributed to the Afghanistan withdrawal, increasing hospitalizations from the Delta variant, high inflation and gas prices, disarray within the Democratic Party, and a general decline in popularity customary in politics.[762][763][764][765] In 2023, Biden's approval rating was the lowest of any modern[d] U.S. president's after three years in office.[766] The Gallup Organization found Biden's approval ratings to be consistently above 50% during his first few months in office,[767][768] but by August his ratings began to decline.[769] He had a 98% approval rating from Democrats in February 2021, but by December only 78% approved of his presidency.[770][767] By October 2023, his rating among Democrats had reached a record low of 75%.[766][771] His approval rating among Republicans has been consistently in the single digits, aside from his first few months in office.[770] Additionally, Gallup noted that Biden's public support eroded each year he was in office: he averaged 49% approval in his first year,[772] 41% in his second,[773] and 40% in his third.[774] In July 2024, just before he withdrew from the 2024 presidential election, Gallup found his approval rating had fallen to an all-time low of 36%.[775] Nine men have portrayed Biden on Saturday Night Live, starting with Kevin Nealon in 1991. Jason Sudeikis portrayed Biden during the 2008 election season and reprised the role many times. During the 2020 election season, Biden was played by John Mulaney, Alex Moffat, Mikey Day, Woody Harrelson, and Jim Carrey. In 2024, Dana Carvey played the role.[776][777] In 2016, Greg Kinnear portrayed Biden in the HBO television film Confirmation, about the Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination hearings.[778]",

As President, Biden restored America’s leadership and built our communities back better. President Joseph Robinette Biden, Jr. was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, the first of four children of Catherine Eugenia Finnegan Biden and Joseph Robinette Biden, Sr. In 1953, the Biden family moved to Claymont, Delaware. President Biden graduated from the University of Delaware and Syracuse Law School and served on the New Castle County Council. At age 29, President Biden became one of the youngest Americans ever elected to the United States Senate. Just weeks after his Senate election, tragedy struck when his wife Neilia and daughter Naomi were killed, and sons Hunter and Beau were critically injured, in a car accident. He was sworn into the U.S. Senate at his sons’ hospital bedsides and began commuting from Wilmington to Washington every day, first by car, and then by train, in order to be with his family. In 1977, he married Jill Jacobs, and in 1980, their family was complete with the birth of their daughter Ashley. As a Senator from Delaware for 36 years, then-Senator Biden played a leading role addressing some of our nation’s most important domestic and international challenges, including writing the Violence Against Women Act. As Vice President, he worked alongside President Obama to secure passage of the Affordable Care Act, oversee the then-largest economic recovery plan in history, and strengthen American leadership on the world stage. In 2020, President Biden ran for the White House to restore the Soul of America, rebuild the backbone of America – the middle class, and unite the country. After being sworn in as the 46th President on January 20th, 2021, he took swift action to get America vaccinated and jumpstart an economic recovery that created more jobs than any other President has created in four years. The President’s agenda is investing in all Americans. His Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is rebuilding our roads and bridges, removing lead pipes, and expanding high-speed internet access. His Inflation Reduction Act is the largest investment in climate action in history. And his CHIPS and Science Act is making cutting-edge technology here in America with American workers. The President beat Big Pharma – negotiating lower prescription drug costs and capping insulin at $35 a month for seniors. His agenda is lowering health insurance costs, cutting utility bills, and taking on corporate rip-offs like junk fees. The President nominated the first Black woman to serve on the Supreme Court, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. He signed into law the first meaningful gun safety bill in nearly 30 years. And on the world stage, President Biden has strengthened our alliances and restored American leadership. He has rallied the world to stand up to Putin’s aggression in Ukraine, expanded NATO which is now larger and stronger than ever before, and increased America’s influence in the Indo-Pacific. President Biden came to office determined to build an administration that looks like America — and that’s what he’s done. He served as Vice President to the nation’s first Black President, and now serves as President alongside the nation’s first Black woman to be Vice President. President Biden has been at the center of the great American story of expanding opportunity and making real the promise of America to everyone.

                "content": "Our editors will review what you’ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article. Joe Biden is the 46th president of the United States (2021– ). He was born on November 20, 1942, in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and he served as a U.S. senator representing Delaware from 1972 to 2009. He was vice president in the Barack Obama administration from 2009 to 2017. In July 2024 Biden announced he would not seek a second term as president. In a statement posted on social media on July 21, 2024, Joe Biden said that “while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term.” Joe Biden (born November 20, 1942, Scranton, Pennsylvania, U.S.) is the 46th president of the United States (2021–25) and was the 47th vice president of the United States (2009–17) in the Democratic administration of Pres. Barack Obama. He previously represented Delaware in the U.S. Senate (1973–2009). In April 2023 Joe Biden formally announced his bid for reelection as president in 2024. In July 2024, however, following his poor performance in a nationally televised debate with Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump—and under intense pressure from several leading Democrats—Biden ended his candidacy and endorsed Vice Pres. Kamala Harris to be the Democratic Party’s presidential nominee. In ending his campaign, Biden became the first president since Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968 to not seek reelection. Biden, who was raised in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and New Castle county, Delaware, received a bachelor’s degree from the University of Delaware in 1965 and a law degree from Syracuse University in New York in 1968. During this time he married (1966) Neilia Hunter, and the couple later had three children. After graduating from law school, Biden returned to Delaware to work as an attorney before quickly turning to politics, serving on the New Castle county council from 1970 to 1972. He was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1972 at the age of 29, becoming the fifth youngest U.S. senator in history. About a month later his wife and infant daughter were killed in a car accident, and his two sons were seriously injured. Although he contemplated suspending his political career, Biden was persuaded to join the Senate in 1973, and he went on to win reelection six times, becoming Delaware’s longest-serving senator. In 1977 he married Jill Jacobs, an educator, and they later had a daughter. In addition to his role as U.S. senator, Biden also was an adjunct professor (1991–2008) at the Wilmington, Delaware, branch of the Widener University School of Law. As a senator, Biden focused on foreign relations, criminal law, and drug policy. He served on the Senate’s Foreign Relations Committee, twice as its chair (2001–03; 2007–09), and on the Committee on the Judiciary, serving as its chair from 1987 to 1995. He was particularly outspoken on issues related to the Kosovo conflict of the late 1990s, urging U.S. action against Serbian forces to protect Kosovars against an offensive by Serbian Pres. Slobodan Milošević. On the Iraq War (2003–11) Biden proposed a partition plan as a way to maintain a united, peaceful Iraq. Biden also was a member of the International Narcotics Control Caucus and was the lead senator in writing the law that established the office of “drug czar,” a position that oversees national drug-control policy. Biden pursued the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination but withdrew after it was revealed that parts of his campaign stump speech had been plagiarized from British Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock without appropriate attribution. His 2008 presidential campaign never gained momentum, and he withdrew from the race after placing fifth in the Iowa Democratic caucus in January of that year. (For coverage of the 2008 election, see United States Presidential Election of 2008.) After Obama amassed enough delegates to secure the Democratic presidential nomination, Biden emerged as a front-runner to be Obama’s vice presidential running mate. On August 23 Obama officially announced his selection of Biden as the Democratic Party’s vice presidential nominee, and on August 27 Obama and Biden secured the Democratic Party’s nomination. On November 4 the Obama-Biden ticket defeated John McCain and his running mate, Sarah Palin, and Biden also easily won reelection to his U.S. Senate seat. He resigned from the Senate post shortly before taking the oath of office as vice president on January 20, 2009. In November 2012 Obama and Biden were reelected for a second term, defeating the Republican ticket of Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan. As vice president Biden played an active role in the Obama administration, serving as an influential adviser to Obama and a vocal supporter of his initiatives. In addition, he was tasked with notable assignments. He helped avert several budget crises and played a key role in shaping U.S. policy in Iraq. In 2015 his eldest son, Beau, died from brain cancer; Biden recounted the experience in Promise Me, Dad: A Year of Hope, Hardship, and Purpose (2017). Several months later, Biden—who enjoyed high favorability ratings, partly due to a candor and affable manner that resonated with the public—announced that he would not enter the 2016 presidential election, noting that the family was still grieving. Instead, he campaigned for Hillary Clinton, who ultimately lost the election to Donald Trump. Biden’s close relationship with Obama was evident when the latter surprised him with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, with distinction, on January 12, 2017, just days before they left office. When Obama presented the rarely given honor he referred to Biden as “my brother.” Later that year Biden and his wife established the Biden Foundation, a charitable group involved in various causes. Biden remained involved in politics and was a vocal critic of President Trump. Biden himself faced censure when, in 2019, various women accused him of inappropriate physical contact, notably hugging and kissing. Although his response was widely derided—“I’m sorry I didn’t understand more.…I’m not sorry for anything that I have ever done. I’ve never been disrespectful intentionally to a man or a woman”—his popularity remained high. Amid growing speculation that he would run for president in 2020, Biden announced his candidacy in April 2019, joining a crowded Democratic field. Biden immediately became a front-runner, and he pursued a platform that was considered moderate, especially as compared with such candidates as Bernie Sanders. A poor performance in the party’s first debate in June 2019, however, raised questions about Biden, and his support dipped. After the first three nomination contests in early 2020, Sanders seemed poised to become the party’s nominee. However, worries about Sanders’s electability in the general election galvanized moderate voters, and in South Carolina in late February Biden won a resounding victory. Numerous candidates subsequently dropped out, and by early March it had become a two-person race between Biden and Sanders. As Biden registered more wins, he soon took a commanding lead in delegates. After the rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States stalled the campaigns, Sanders dropped out in April, and Biden became the presumptive Democratic nominee. In the ensuing months Biden outlined a platform that included a number of policies that appealed to progressives. He notably supported government aid to low-income communities, ambitious climate-change legislation, affordable child care, and the expansion of federal health insurance plans, such as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which had been enacted during Obama’s presidency. During this time Biden gained a somewhat sizable lead over Trump in nationwide polls, in part due to criticism of the president’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which had caused an economic downturn that rivaled the Great Depression. In August 2020 Biden chose Kamala Harris as his running mate—she became the first African American woman to appear on a major party’s national ticket—and later that month, he officially was named the Democratic presidential nominee. Although preelection polling had shown Biden with a significant lead in key battleground states, the actual contest proved to be much closer. Nevertheless, Biden and Harris succeeded in rebuilding the so-called “Blue Wall” through the Midwestern Rust Belt states, and on November 7, four days after the election, Biden secured the 270 electoral votes necessary to capture the presidency. Biden’s eventual electoral vote total was 306 to Trump’s 232; Biden won the popular vote by more than seven million votes. Trump and several other Republican leaders subsequently challenged the election results, claiming massive voter fraud. Although a number of lawsuits were filed, no evidence was provided to support the allegations, and the vast majority of the cases were dismissed. During this time, Biden and Harris began the transition to a new administration, announcing an agenda and selecting staff. By early December all states had certified the election results, and the process then moved to Congress for final certification. Amid Trump’s repeated calls for Republicans to overturn the election, a group of Republican congressional members, notably including Senators Josh Hawley (Missouri) and Ted Cruz (Texas), announced that they would challenge the electors of various states. As the proceedings began on January 6, 2021, a large crowd of Trump supporters marched to the U.S. Capitol from a rally near the White House, where Trump had delivered an incendiary speech repeating false allegations of voter fraud by Democrats and urging his supporters to “fight like hell.” Overwhelming Capitol police, the rioters stormed the complex and vandalized and looted the interior, resulting in the deaths of five people, including one Capitol police officer (see January 6 U.S. Capitol attack). After several hours the building was finally secured, and Biden and Harris were certified as the winners. Two weeks later, amid a massive security presence, Biden was sworn in as president. The 2020 election was marked by a historically large voter turnout, made possible in part by modifications in voting procedures initiated in many states to ensure that voters could cast their ballots safely amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Significantly more Democrats voted in the 2020 election than in previous presidential contests, and the Democratic Party not only won the presidential election but also maintained its control of the U.S. House of Representatives and took control of the U.S. Senate from Republicans, though only by the slimmest of margins (the resulting Senate membership was evenly divided between the two parties at 50 senators each, but tie votes could be broken by Vice President Harris, acting in her constitutional role as president of the Senate). In the view of many Democrats, particularly progressives, the party’s simultaneous control of the presidency and both houses of Congress afforded it a rare opportunity to pass transformative legislation that promised to make American society more democratic, equitable, and just. During the first weeks of his presidency, Biden signed a raft of executive orders, actions, and memoranda, many of which rescinded policies of the Trump administration, particularly in the areas of immigration, health care, and the environment. Notably, on his first day in office, Biden issued executive orders that reentered the United States into the Paris Agreement on climate change and canceled the country’s withdrawal from the World Health Organization. In March 2021 the Biden administration used budget reconciliation (a process that prevents certain budget-related bills in the Senate from being filibustered) to secure passage by Congress, without Republican support, of a $1.9 trillion pandemic relief bill, the American Rescue Plan. The law included, among other measures, one-time payments for lower- and middle-income Americans; extended unemployment benefits; an expanded child tax credit; financial aid to state and local governments, schools, and child care providers; housing assistance; and additional funding for coronavirus testing, contact tracing, and vaccine distribution. Biden supported three significant pieces of voting rights and electoral-reform legislation: the For the People Act, passed by the House in March 2021; the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, passed by the House in August; and the Freedom to Vote Act, introduced in the Senate in September. (The first two bills were later versions of legislation passed by the House in 2019.) All three bills were blocked in the Senate by Republican filibusters, which could be overcome only with the support of at least 60 senators. The bills were designed to prevent states from adopting egregious voter suppression laws, to eliminate partisan and racial gerrymandering, and to make elections more transparent by requiring “dark money” organizations to disclose their donors (see campaign finance; campaign finance laws). The failure of the electoral-reform measures, which Democrats viewed as essential to preserving American democracy, prompted progressive and even some moderate Democrats to urge the elimination of the filibuster, which is not established in the U.S. Constitution and can be ended by the Senate in a simple majority vote. In August 2021 the Senate passed the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, a drastically scaled-back ($550 billion) version of a wide-ranging infrastructure plan announced by Biden in March. Its smaller scale was made necessary by objections from Republicans and conservative Democrats to spending levels, tax increases on corporations and the wealthy, and several social spending provisions. The bill then languished in the House for months as progressive, moderate, and conservative Democrats debated its provisions. In early November, following important off-year elections in which Democrats suffered several unexpected defeats, Biden and Democratic House leaders intensified their efforts to reconcile their party’s factions, arguing that some tangible legislative achievement was necessary to retain the support of swing voters. After progressives finally conceded, the infrastructure bill was passed and sent to Biden for his signature. (In November 2022 Democrats lost control of the House to Republicans but retained their slim control of the Senate, gaining one seat.) In August 2022 the Biden administration again relied on budget reconciliation to secure passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, which incorporated some elements of an earlier bill, the Build Back Better Act, that had been defeated in the Senate after its rejection by conservative Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin. The Inflation Reduction Act included provisions designed to promote the development of clean-energy technologies; to lower prescription drug prices, in part by empowering Medicare to negotiate the purchase of certain drugs from pharmaceutical companies; to extend the administration’s earlier increase of medical-insurance subsidies provided under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010); and to increase federal tax revenue by imposing a minimum corporate tax rate of 15 percent and strengthening tax-law enforcement with thousands of additional Internal Revenue Service (IRS) officials. The legislation, which represents the largest government investment in climate-change prevention in U.S. history, was projected to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent (from 2005) by 2030. In part because of continued supply-chain disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and in part because the country’s economy grew at a fast pace during the first years of Biden’s presidency (in 2021 gross domestic product [GDP] grew by 5.7 percent, the highest annual rate in 37 years), inflation remained a persistent problem, eventually leading the Federal Reserve (the country’s central bank) to impose an extended series of interest-rate increases. Despite significant wage increases, rapid job growth, and greatly reduced unemployment, public worries regarding inflation contributed to a common perception that Biden was mismanaging the economy, which in turn contributed to his low public approval rating—less than 50 percent—during most of his presidency. By the end of 2023, the country’s inflation rate had declined to 4.1 percent, but Biden’s approval rating (according Gallup polls) was only 39 percent, the second lowest of any modern U.S. president after a third year in office. By mid-2024 Biden had nominated more than 240 individuals to vacant seats on the federal judiciary, and nearly 200 of his nominees had been confirmed by the U.S. Senate. After Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer announced in January 2022 that he would retire at the end of the Court’s 2021–22 term, Biden repeated his intention—first voiced as a campaign pledge—to nominate a Black woman to the Court. In February he nominated Ketanji Brown Jackson, whom he had earlier appointed (in 2021) to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Jackson’s nomination was confirmed by a Senate vote of 53 to 47, and in June she was sworn in as the first Black female Supreme Court justice. On December 13, 2022, Biden signed into law the Respect for Marriage Act. The act formally repealed the federal Defense of Marriage Act (1996), which had defined marriage as a legal union between one man and one woman and had permitted states to refuse to recognize same-sex marriages performed in other states. Biden had also appointed as U.S. secretary of transportation Pete Buttigieg, the first openly gay cabinet member in American history, who had unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020. Among Biden’s early goals in foreign policy were to repair frayed relations with several U.S. allies, to cooperate in global efforts to ameliorate climate change, and, in general, to return the United States to a position of global economic and political leadership. Biden had also promised during his campaign that he would withdraw all remaining U.S. troops from Afghanistan, finally ending nearly 20 years of U.S. military involvement in the country during all phases of the Afghanistan War, the longest military conflict ever fought by the United States. In April 2021 Biden announced a withdrawal of all U.S. troops by September 11—an extension of the May 1 withdrawal deadline negotiated with the Taliban by the Trump administration in 2020. By early August, after Biden had advanced the withdrawal deadline to August 31, the Taliban had begun to take military control of several Afghan provinces, and soon thereafter the Afghan capital, Kabul, was captured and the national government collapsed. Chaos ensued as the airport in Kabul was flooded with desperate Afghan refugees seeking to flee the country on American evacuation flights. During and after the withdrawal, the Biden administration was criticized by Republican and some Democratic leaders for having misjudged the strength and resolve of both the Taliban and the Afghan government and security forces. In 2022, following Russia’s military invasion of Ukraine, Biden imposed harsh economic sanctions on Russia and initiated the first of many military weapons transfers and other security assistance to Ukraine. By the end of 2023 Congress had approved $113 billion in military, economic, and humanitarian aid to the country at Biden’s request. His support for Ukraine and its leader, Volodymyr Zelensky, contrasted with the attitude of far-right Republicans, particularly members of the Trump-led MAGA movement, who generally supported Russian Pres. Vladimir Putin and Viktor Orbán, the authoritarian leader of Hungary. Trump’s long-standing admiration for Putin and his lack of sympathy for Ukraine were reflected in the opposition of Trump’s congressional allies to Biden’s request for additional military assistance to Ukraine in October 2023. After months of debate, Congress finally approved an aid package that included $61 billion for Ukraine. The aid package also contained $15 billion in additional military assistance for Israel, which had been engaged in a war against Hamas, the Palestinian militant group in control of the Gaza Strip, since the latter’s military assault on Israel on October 7, 2023 (see Israel-Hamas War). Hamas’s attack resulted in the deaths of more than 1,200 Israeli citizens. Israel responded with a massive ground invasion beginning in the northern Gaza Strip, nearly continuous airstrikes, and an intensified blockade preventing water, food, medicine, electricity, and fuel from entering the territory. By early May 2024, more than 35,000 Palestinians, most of whom were civilians, had been reported dead. Biden initially condemned Hamas’s attack and expressed unequivocal support for Israel while also requesting brief pauses in Israeli military action to permit humanitarian aid and civilian evacuations. As the war continued, Israel faced international condemnation for its numerous attacks on civilian targets (which it generally claimed were housing Hamas fighters) and the humanitarian crisis created by its blockade, and Biden faced criticism from some Democrats for not insisting that Israel accept a cease-fire. In February 2024, Biden indicated his opposition to Israel’s declared intention to invade Rafah, a city in the southwestern Gaza Strip that had become a refuge for massive numbers of fleeing civilians. The invasion proceeded anyway, beginning in early May. As the Israel-Hamas War continued, growing numbers of Americans opposed the country’s unconditional military assistance to Israel, and Biden was faulted by many Democrats for his apparent lack of influence over Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and for showing insufficient concern over Israeli military atrocities. The war also provoked student protests on dozens of college campuses across the United States, some of which became violent. Political analysts generally agree that America’s involvement in the Israel-Hamas War has contributed to Biden’s persistently low approval rating. Biden’s hopes of serving a second term as president, never a certainty, collapsed in a period of four weeks in the summer of 2024. National polling as early as the fall of 2023 showed Trump with a slight lead over Biden. Biden’s approval ratings remained low compared with other first-term presidents—a fact that analysts had attributed to the country’s chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, to the widespread perception that Biden was mismanaging the economy, and to the belief of many Americans (including some Democrats) that Biden was simply too old to competently serve as president. On June 27, 2024, the last concern was reinforced by Biden’s poor performance in his first televised debate with Trump. Although Trump himself did not debate well (repeating many falsehoods and consistently failing to answer moderators’ questions), Biden’s stumbling, meandering, and raspy-voiced responses made him seem much weaker, both physically and mentally, than his opponent. After the debate, some prominent Democrats and several Democratic-leaning journalists, commentators, and news organizations, including The New York Times, called upon Biden to withdraw from the race. Biden initially was defiant, doing speeches and holding news conferences to try to reverse the damage done by his debate performance. But over the course of a month that included an attempted assassination of Trump, the drumbeat of calls for Biden to step down grew louder. On July 21, he announced that he was withdrawing from the race and throwing his support to Harris, becoming the first president to not seek reelection since Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968. In an address to the nation, he explained his decision while never naming his opponent. I revere this office, but I love my country more. It’s been the honor of my life to serve as your president. But in the defense of democracy, which is at stake, I think it’s more important than any title. I draw strength and I find joy in working for the American people. But this sacred task of perfecting our union is not about me, it’s about you. Your families, your futures. It’s about “we the people.”",

                "content": "Joseph Robinette Biden, Jr. was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, the first of four children of Catherine Eugenia Finnegan Biden and Joseph Robinette Biden, Sr. In 1953, the Biden family moved to Claymont, Delaware. President Biden graduated from the University of Delaware and Syracuse Law School and served on the New Castle County Council. At age 29, President Biden became one of the youngest people ever elected to the United States Senate. Just weeks after his Senate election, tragedy struck the Biden family when his wife Neilia and daughter Naomi were killed, and sons Hunter and Beau were critically injured, in an auto accident. Biden was sworn into the U.S. Senate at his sons’ hospital bedsides and began commuting from Wilmington to Washington every day, first by car, and then by train, in order to be with his family. He would continue to do so throughout his time in the Senate. Biden married Jill Jacobs in 1977, and in 1980, their family was complete with the birth of Ashley Blazer Biden. A lifelong educator, Jill earned her doctorate in education and returned to teaching as an English professor at a community college in Virginia. Beau Biden, Attorney General of Delaware and Joe Biden’s eldest son, passed away in 2015 after battling brain cancer with the same integrity, courage, and strength he demonstrated every day of his life. Beau’s fight with cancer inspires the mission of President Biden’s life — ending cancer as we know it. As a Senator from Delaware for 36 years, President Biden established himself as a leader in facing some of our nation’s most important domestic and international challenges. As Chairman or Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee for 16 years, Biden is widely recognized for his work writing and spearheading the Violence Against Women Act — the landmark legislation that strengthens penalties for violence against women, creates unprecedented resources for survivors of assault, and changes the national dialogue on domestic and sexual assault. As Chairman or Ranking Member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for 12 years, Biden played a pivotal role in shaping U.S. foreign policy. He was at the forefront of issues and legislation related to terrorism, weapons of mass destruction, post-Cold War Europe, the Middle East, Southwest Asia, and ending apartheid. As Vice President, Biden continued his leadership on important issues facing the nation and represented our country abroad. Vice President Biden convened sessions of the President’s Cabinet, led interagency efforts, and worked with Congress in his fight to raise the living standards of middle-class Americans, reduce gun violence, address violence against women, and end cancer as we know it. Biden helped President Obama pass and then oversaw the implementation of the Recovery Act — the biggest economic recovery plan in the history of the nation and our biggest and strongest commitment to clean energy. The President’s plan prevented another Great Depression, created and saved millions of jobs, and led to 75 uninterrupted months of job growth by the end of the administration. And Biden did it all with less than 1% in waste, abuse, or fraud — the most efficient government program in our country’s history. President Obama and Vice President Biden also secured the passage of the Affordable Care Act, which reduced the number of uninsured Americans by 20 million by the time they left office and banned insurance companies from denying coverage due to pre-existing conditions. He served as the point person for U.S. diplomacy throughout the Western Hemisphere, strengthened relationships with our allies both in Europe and the Asia-Pacific, and led the effort to bring 150,000 troops home from Iraq. In a ceremony at the White House, President Obama awarded Biden the Presidential Medal of Freedom with Distinction — the nation’s highest civilian honor. Joe Biden and Barack Obama both in dark suits, holding each other and smilingBarack Obama announces Biden as his vice-presidential running mate in Springfield, Illinois After leaving the White House, the Bidens continued their efforts to expand opportunity for every American with the creation of the Biden Foundation, the Biden Cancer Initiative, the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement, and the Biden Institute at the University of Delaware. On April 25, 2019, Biden announced his candidacy for President of the United States. Biden’s candidacy was built from the beginning around 3 pillars: the battle for the soul of our nation, the need to rebuild our middle class — the backbone of our country, and a call for unity, to act as One America. It was a message that would only gain more resonance in 2020 as we confront a pandemic, an economic crisis, urgent calls for racial justice, and the existential threat of climate change.

                "content": "An Amber alert (alternatively styled AMBER alert) or a child abduction emergency alert (SAME code: CAE) is a message distributed by a child abduction alert system to ask the public for help in finding abducted children.[1][2] The system originated in the United States.[1] The Amber alert was created in reference to Amber Rene Hagerman, who was abducted and later found murdered on January 17, 1996. Alternative regional alert names were once used; in Georgia, \"Levi's Call\"[3] (in memory of Levi Frady); in Hawaii, \"Maile Amber Alert\"[4] (in memory of Maile Gilbert); in Arkansas, \"Morgan Nick Amber Alert\"[5] (in memory of Morgan Nick); in Utah, \"Rachael Alert\" (in memory of Rachael Runyan); and in Idaho, \"Monkey's Law\" (in memory of Michael “Monkey” Joseph Vaughan). In the United States, the alerts are distributed via commercial and public radio stations, Internet radio, satellite radio, television stations, text messages, and cable TV by the Emergency Alert System and NOAA Weather Radio[6][7] (where they are termed \"Amber Alerts\"). The alerts are also issued via e-mail, electronic traffic-condition signs, commercial electronic billboards,[8][9] or through wireless device SMS text messages. The US Justice Department's Amber Alert Program has also teamed up with Google[10][11] and Facebook[12] to relay information regarding an Amber alert to an ever-growing demographic: Amber alerts are automatically displayed if citizens search or use map features on Google, Yahoo!, Bing, and other search engines. With Google public alert (also called Google Amber Alert in some countries), citizens see an Amber alert if they search for related information in a particular location where a minor has recently been abducted and an alert was issued. This is a component of the Amber alert system that is already active in the US (there are also developments in Europe). Those interested in subscribing to receive Amber alerts in their area via SMS messages can visit Wireless Amber alerts, which are offered by law as free messages.[13] In some states, the display scrollboards in front of lottery terminals are also used. The decision to declare an Amber alert is made by each police organization (in many cases, the state police or highway patrol) investigating the abduction. Public information in an Amber alert usually includes the name and description of the abductee, a description of the suspected abductor, and a description and license plate number of the abductor's vehicle if available. [citation needed] The alerts are broadcast using the Emergency Alert System, which had previously been used primarily for weather bulletins, civil emergencies, or national emergencies.[14] In Canada, alerts are broadcast via Alert Ready, a Canadian emergency warning system. Alerts usually contain a description of the child and of the likely abductor.[15] To avoid both false alarms and having alerts ignored as a \"wolf cry\", the criteria for issuing an alert are rather strict. Each state's or province's Amber alert plan sets its own criteria for activation,[16] meaning that there are differences between alerting agencies as to which incidents are considered to justify the use of the system. However, the U.S. Department of Justice issues the following \"guidance\", which most states are said to \"adhere closely to\" (in the U.S.):[17] Many law enforcement agencies have not used #2 as a criterion, resulting in many parental abductions triggering an Amber alert, where the child is not known or assumed to be at risk of serious injury or death. In 2013, West Virginia passed Skylar's Law to eliminate #1 as a criterion for triggering an Amber Alert.[citation needed] It is recommended that Amber alert data immediately be entered into the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) National Crime Information Center. Text information describing the circumstances surrounding the abduction of the child should be entered, and the case flagged as child abduction.[citation needed] The Royal Canadian Mounted Police's (RCMP) requirements in Canada are nearly identical to the above list, with the exception that the RCMP is notified.[18] One organization might notify the other if there is reason to suspect that the border may be crossed.[citation needed] When investigators believe that a child is in danger of being taken across the border to either Canada or Mexico, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, United States Border Patrol and the Canada Border Services Agency are notified and are expected to search every car coming through a border checkpoint. If the child is suspected to be taken to Canada, a Canadian Amber Alert can also be issued, and a pursuit by Canadian authorities usually follows.[citation needed] For incidents which do not meet Amber alert criteria, the United States Department of Justice developed the Child Abduction Response Teams (CART) program to assist local agencies. This program can be used in all missing children's cases with or without an Amber alert. CART can also be used to help recover runaway children who are under the age of 18 and in danger. As of 2010[update], 225 response teams have been trained in 43 states, as well as Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico, the Bahamas, and Canada.[19] Amber Rene Hagerman (November 25, 1986 – January 15, 1996) was a nine-year-old girl abducted while riding her bike in Arlington, Texas.[21] Her younger brother, Ricky, had gone home without her because Amber had wanted to stay in the parking lot for a while. When he returned with his grandfather, they only found her bicycle. A neighbor who had witnessed the abduction called 911.[citation needed] On hearing the news, Hagerman's father, Richard, called Marc Klaas, whose daughter, Polly, had been kidnapped and murdered in Petaluma, California, in 1993 and Amber's mother, Donna Whitson (now Donna Williams), called the news media and the FBI. They and their neighbors began searching for Amber.[22] Four days after her abduction, near midnight, a man walking his dog discovered Amber's naked body in a creek behind an apartment complex with severe laceration wounds to her neck. The site of the discovery was less than five miles (8 km) from where she was abducted. Her murder remains unsolved.[23] Within days of Amber's death, Donna Williams was \"calling for tougher laws governing kidnappers and sex offenders\".[24] Amber's parents soon established People Against Sex Offenders (PASO). They collected signatures hoping to force the Texas Legislature into passing more stringent laws to protect children.[25] God's Place International Church donated the first office space for the organization, and as the search for Amber's killer continued, PASO received almost-daily coverage in local media. Companies donated various office supplies, including computer and Internet service. Congressman Martin Frost, with the help of Marc Klaas, drafted the Amber Hagerman Child Protection Act. Both of Hagerman's parents were present when President Bill Clinton signed the bill into law, creating the national sex offender registry. Williams and Richard Hagerman then began collecting signatures in Texas, which they planned to present to then-Governor George W. Bush as a sign that people wanted more stringent laws for sex offenders.[26] In July 1996, Bruce Seybert (whose own daughter was a close friend of Amber)[27] and Richard Hagerman attended a media symposium in Arlington. Although Hagerman had remarks prepared, on the day of the event the organizers asked Seybert to speak instead. In his 20-minute speech, he spoke about efforts that local police could take quickly to help find missing children and how the media could facilitate those efforts. C.J. Wheeler, a reporter from radio station KRLD, approached the Dallas police chief shortly afterward with Seybert's ideas and launched the first ever Amber Alert.[28] Williams testified in front of the U.S. Congress in June 1996, asking legislators to create a nationwide registry of sex offenders. Representative Martin Frost, the Congressman who represents Williams' district, proposed an \"Amber Hagerman Child Protection Act.\" Among the sections of the bill was one that would create a national sex offender registry.[29] Diana Simone, a Texas resident who had been following the news, contacted the KDMX radio station and proposed broadcasts to engage passers-by in helping locate missing children.[30] Her idea was picked up and for the next two years, alerts were made manually to participating radio stations. In 1998, the Child Alert Foundation created the first fully automated Alert Notification System (ANS) to notify surrounding communities when a child was reported missing or abducted. Alerts were sent to radio stations as originally requested but included television stations, surrounding law enforcement agencies, newspapers and local support organizations. These alerts were sent all at once via pagers, faxes, emails, and cell phones with the information immediately posted on the Internet for the general public to view.[31] Following the automation of the Amber alert with ANS technology created by the Child Alert Foundation, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) expanded its role in 2002 to promote the Amber alert.[32] In October 2000, the United States House of Representatives adopted H.Res.605, which encouraged communities nationwide to implement the AMBER Plan.[citation needed] In October 2001, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children that had declined to be a part of the Amber alert program in February 1996, launched a campaign to have Amber alert systems established nationwide.[citation needed] In February 2002, the Federal Communications Commission officially endorsed the system. In 2002, several children were abducted in cases that drew national attention. One such case, the kidnapping and murder of Samantha Runnion, prompted California to establish an Amber alert system on July 24, 2002.[14] According to Senator Dianne Feinstein, in its first month California issued 13 Amber alerts; 12 of the children were recovered safely and the remaining alert was found to be a misunderstanding.[33] By September 2002, 26 states had established Amber alert systems that covered all or parts of the state. A bipartisan group of US Senators, led by Kay Bailey Hutchison and Dianne Feinstein, proposed legislation to name an Amber alert coordinator in the U.S. Justice Department who could help coordinate state efforts. The bill also provided $25 million in federal matching grants for states to establish Amber alert programs and necessary equipment purchases, such as electronic highway signs. A similar bill was sponsored in the U.S. House of Representatives by Jennifer Dunn and Martin Frost.[33] The bill passed the Senate unanimously within a week of its proposal.[34] At an October 2002 conference on missing, exploited, and runaway children, President George W. Bush announced changes to the AMBER Alert system, including the development of a national standard for issuing AMBER Alerts.[35] A similar bill passed the House several weeks later on a 390–24 vote.[36] A related bill finally became law in April 2003.[37] The alerts were offered digitally beginning in November 2002, when America Online began a service allowing people to sign up to receive notification via computer, pager, or cell phone. Users of the service enter their ZIP Code, thus allowing the alerts to be targeted to specific geographic regions.[38] By 2005, all fifty states had operational programs and today the program operates across state and jurisdictional boundaries.[39] As of January 1, 2013[update], AMBER Alerts are automatically sent through the Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA) program.[40] Canada's system began in December 2002, when Alberta launched the first province-wide system. At the time, Alberta Solicitor-General Heather Forsyth said \"We anticipate an Amber Alert will only be issued once a year in Alberta. We hope we never have to use it, but if a child is abducted Amber Alert is another tool police can use to find them and help them bring the child home safely.\"[41] The Alberta government committed to spending more than CA$1 million to expanding the province's emergency warning system so that it could be used effectively for Amber Alerts.[41] Other provinces soon adopted the system, and by May 2004, Saskatchewan was the only province that had not established an Amber Alert system.[42] Within the next year, the program was in use throughout the country. Amber alerts may also be distributed via the Alert Ready emergency alert system, which disrupts programming on all radio, television stations, and television providers in the relevant region to display and play audio of Amber alert information. In 2018, Alert Ready introduced alerts on supported mobile devices. When an alert is broadcast, a distinct sound is played and a link to find more information is displayed onscreen. Currently, there is no way to deactivate Amber alerts on mobile devices in Canada, even if the device is in silent and/or Do Not Disturb modes, which has provoked controversy.[43][44] These series of multiple blaring alarms going off in the middle of the night have caused residents to complain, often by calling 911.[45] However, there are concerns that hearing repeated alarms may cause Canadians to ignore the alarm when the system is used to warn of life-threatening emergencies.[citation needed] Translink, the corporation responsible for the regional transportation network of Metro Vancouver in British Columbia, Canada, displays Amber alerts on all their buses' digital signs reading \"AMBER ALERT | Listen to radio | Bus #\". Details of the Amber alert information are also available on screens at transit stations.[citation needed] The program was introduced in Quebec on May 26, 2003. The name AMBER alert was then adapted in French to Alerte Médiatique But Enfant Recherché, which directly translates as \"Media Alert Goal of Child Recovery\". In order to launch an AMBER alert, police authorities need to meet four criteria simultaneously and with no exceptions: Once all four conditions are met, the police service may call an AMBER alert. Simultaneously, all of Quebec's Ministry of transport message boards will broadcast the police's messages. The Société de l'assurance automobile du Québec (SAAQ) road traffic controllers also help with the search. Television and radio stations broadcast a description of the child, the abductor and/or the abductor's car. On the radio, the information is broadcast every 20 minutes for two hours or less if the child is found. On the television, the information is broadcast on a ticker tape at the bottom of the screen for two hours with no interruptions. After this, the ticker tape is withdrawn, but the police continue to inform the public through the usual means of communication.[citation needed] Over the years, the program gathered more partners in order for the alert to be communicated on different media platforms. As in Ontario, lottery crown corporation Loto-Québec puts to the disposition of the police forces their 8,500 terminals located throughout the province. Some of these terminals are equipped with a screen that faces the customer which makes it one of the largest networks of its kind to operate in Canada. The technology employed enables them to broadcast the message on the entire network in under 10 minutes. In addition, The Canadian Wireless Telecommunications Association (CWTA) offers to most Canadians, upon free subscription, the possibility to receive, via text message, on their mobile devices AMBER alert notices.[citation needed] Ontario furthered its reach beyond media and highway signs by offering Amber alerts on the province's 9,000 lottery terminal screens.[47] After the abduction and murder of Victoria Stafford, an online petition was started by Suzie Pereira, a single mother of 2 children who gathered over 61,000 signatures, prompting a review of the Amber Alert. There was some concern regarding the strict criteria for issuing the alerts – criteria that were not met in the Stafford case – that resulted in an alert not being issued. Ontario Provincial Police have since changed their rules for issuing an alert from having to confirm an abduction and confirm threat of harm, to believe that a child has been abducted and believe is at risk of harm.[48][49] Mexico joined international efforts to spread the use of the Amber alert at an official launch ceremony on April 28, 2011.[50][51] The Australian state of Queensland implemented a version of the Amber alerts in May 2005.[52] Other Australian states joined Queensland in Facebook's Amber Alert program in June 2017.[53] AMBER Alert Europe is a foundation that strives to improve the protection of missing children by empowering children and raising awareness on the issue of missing children and its root causes. AMBER Alert Europe advocates that one missing child is one too many and aims for zero missing children in Europe.[citation needed] AMBER Alert Europe is a neutral platform for the exchange of knowledge, expertise, and best practices on the issue of missing children and its roots causes. To contribute to a safer environment for children, it connects experts from 44 non-governmental and governmental organisations, as well as business entities from 28 countries across Europe.[citation needed] Its activities cover prevention and awareness-raising, training, research, and child alerting, as well as launching initiatives aimed at impacting policies and legislation in the area of children’s rights. All activities are implemented in line with the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and the EU Strategy on the Rights of the Child and with respect for the privacy of children and data protection laws.[citation needed] Its beginnings As a response to missing children cases exceeding geographical borders, the AMBER Alert Europe Foundation was founded in 2013 to contribute to better cross-border coordination and cooperation in the search for missing children.[citation needed] Since then, its network has expanded and now encompasses different experts from a variety of backgrounds who make their know-how and experiences available to improve existing practices and procedures for a fast and safe recovery of children gone missing. Its joint efforts with police experts in the field of missing children even paved the way for a European police expert network in this area.[citation needed] With the objective to prevent children from going missing, it also develop activities in the area of prevention, awareness-raising, research, and training together with its network of experts.[citation needed] In February 2006, France's Justice ministry launched an apparatus based on the AMBER alerts named Alerte-Enlèvement (abduction alert) or Dispositif Alerte-Enlèvement (abduction alert apparatus) with the help of most media and railroad and motorway companies.[citation needed] AMBER Alert Netherlands was launched in 2008. On February 14, 2009, the first Dutch AMBER alert was issued when a 4-year-old boy went missing in Rotterdam. He was found safe and sound after being recognized by a person who saw his picture on an electronic billboard in a fast food restaurant. He was recovered so quickly, that the transmission of the AMBER alert was halted before all recipients received it.[citation needed] An AMBER alert is issued when a child is missing or abducted and the Dutch police fear that the life or health of the child is in imminent danger. The system enables the police to immediately alert press and public nationwide, by means of electronic highway signs, TV, radio, social media, PCs, large advertising screens (digital signage), email, text messages, apps, RSS news feeds, website banners and pop-ups.[54] There are four key criteria in The Netherlands to be met before an AMBER Alert is issued: On April 1, 2007, the AMBER alert system became active in North West England.[56] An implementation across the rest of Britain was planned at that time. This was realized on May 25, 2010, with the nationwide launch of the Child Rescue Alert, based on the AMBER alert system. The first system in the UK of this kind was created in Sussex on November 14, 2002. This was followed by versions in Surrey and Hampshire. By 2005, every local jurisdiction in England and Wales had its own form of alert system.[citation needed][57] The system was first used in the UK on October 3, 2012, with regard to missing 5 year-old April Jones in Wales. In April 2009, it was announced that an AMBER alert system would be set up in Ireland, In May 2012, the Child Rescue Ireland (CRI) Alert was officially introduced.[58] Ireland's first AMBER alert was issued upon the disappearance of two boys,[59] Eoghan (10) and Ruairí Chada (5). The AMBER alert system, called \"Pronađi me\" (transl. Find me) started operating in Serbia on October 25, 2023.[60]It was first activated on March 26, 2024[61] due to the disappearance of two-year-old girl, Danka Ilić, in Banjsko Polje in Bor.[citation needed] The alerts are distributed via SMS messages and TV programs.[62] Since April 2015, an emergency child abduction alert system \"AMBER Alert Slovakia\" is also available in Slovakia. (www.amberalert.sk) On 22 September 2021, Ukraine's Ministry of Digital Transformation, the National Police of Ukraine and Facebook announced the launch of AMBER alert in Ukraine.[63] On 15 May 2016, the Ministry of Public Security of the People's Republic of China announced the Ministry of Public Security Emergency Release Platform for Children's Missing Information in Beijing, which was soon rolled out to the rest of the country. It is run by the Criminal Investigation Department of the Ministry of Public Security and receives technical support from Alibaba Group. The platform pushes information of missing children confirmed by the police to the mobile phones of the people around the place where the children disappeared, to mobilise people in the area to find and provide feedback on clues related to abductions, trafficking, and related crimes in the area.[64] In 2018, Ecuador's Department of Security introduced its own Amber alert called Emilia alert, named after the abducted girl Emilia Benavides in December 2017.[citation needed] In September 2007, Malaysia implemented the Nurin Alert. Based on the Amber alert, it is named for a missing eight-year-old girl, Nurin Jazlin.[citation needed] In March 2023, the General Directorate of National Security of Morocco developed a system in cooperation with Meta Platforms based on the Amber Alert, named \"Tifli Moukhtafi\" (lit. 'my child is missing').[65][66] The alerts are distributed via SMS and on platforms owned by Meta.[67] In 2019, Megafon developed its own alert system called MegaFon.Poisk. It is oriented for all regions of Russia where MegaFon is represented and is used for searches of children and adults as well. For less than half of a year, the service has been used for searching of more than 250 people and in more than 30% of situations people called back with information about a lost person.[68] According to the U.S. Department of Justice, of the children abducted and murdered by strangers, 75% are killed within the first three hours of their abduction.[14] Amber alerts are designed to inform the general public quickly when a child has been kidnapped and is in danger so \"the public [would be] additional eyes and ears of law enforcement\".[14] As of December 2023[update], the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children said 1,186 children were recovered because of the Amber alert program.[69] A Scripps Howard study of the 233 Amber alerts in the United States in 2004 found that most issued alerts did not meet the Department of Justice's criteria. That is, 50% (117 alerts) were categorized as family abductions\", e.g., a parent involved in a custody dispute. There were 48 alerts for children who had not been abducted at all, but were lost, ran away, involved in family misunderstandings (for example, two instances where the child was with grandparents), or as the result of hoaxes. Another 23 alerts were issued in cases where police did not know the name of the allegedly abducted child, often as the result of misunderstandings by witnesses who reported an abduction. Seventy of the 233 Amber alerts issued in 2004 (30%) were actually children taken by strangers or who were unlawfully travelling with adults other than their legal guardians.[70] According to the 2014 Amber Alert Report, 186 Amber alerts were issued in the US, involving 239 children – 60 who were taken by strangers or people other than their legal guardians.[71] Some municipalities have used the wireless emergency alert system for categories of people beyond missing children.[citation needed] In 2012, California created the \"silver alert\" for missing elderly people, followed by the \"feather alert\" for missing Indigenous people in 2022,[72][73] and then the \"ebony alert\" for missing Black children and young women. Supporters of the ebony alert say that this will dedicate resources to missing Black youths that may not be given sufficient attention through Amber alerts.[74][75] Since 2008, Texas has implemented the \"blue alert\" for suspected cases of serious injury to police officers.[76][77] Some outside scholars examining the system in depth disagree with the \"official\" results.[78][79][80] A research team led by criminologist Timothy Griffin reviewed hundreds of abduction cases that occurred between 2003 and 2006 and found that Amber alerts actually had little apparent role in the eventual return of abducted children. The Amber alerts tended to be \"successful\" in relatively mundane abductions, such as when the child was taken by a noncustodial parent or other family member. There was little evidence that Amber alerts routinely \"saved lives\", although a crucial research constraint was the impossibility of knowing with certainty what would have happened if no alert had been issued in a particular case.[80] Griffin and coauthor Monica Miller articulated the limits to Amber alerts in a subsequent research article. They stated that alerts are inherently constrained, because to be successful in the most menacing cases there needs to be a rapid synchronization of several events (rapid discovery that the child is missing and subsequent alert, the fortuitous discovery of the child or abductor by a citizen, and so forth). Furthermore, there is a contradiction between the need for rapid recovery and the prerogative to maintain the strict issuance criteria to reduce the number of frivolous alerts, creating a dilemma for law enforcement officials and public backlash when alerts are not issued in cases ending as tragedies. Finally, the implied causal model of alert (rapid recovery can save lives) is in a sense the opposite of reality: in the worst abduction scenarios, the intentions of the perpetrator usually guarantee that anything public officials do will be \"too slow\".[citation needed] Because the system is publicly praised for saving lives despite these limitations, Griffin and Miller argue that Amber alert acts as \"crime control theater\" in that it \"creates the appearance but not the fact of crime control\".[81] AMBER Alert is thus a socially constructed \"solution\" to the rare but intractable crime of child-abduction murder. Griffin and Miller have subsequently applied the concept to other emotional but ineffective legislation such as safe-haven laws and polygamy raids. Griffin considers his findings preliminary, reporting his team examined only a portion of the Amber alerts issued over the three-year period they focused on, so he recommends taking a closer look at the evaluation of the program and its intended purpose, instead of simply promoting the program.[citation needed] Advocates for missing children have expressed concerns that the public is gradually becoming desensitized to Amber alerts because of a large number of false or overly broad alarms, where police issue an Amber alert without strictly adhering to the U.S. Department of Justice's activation guidelines.[82] The timing of a July 2013 New York child abduction alert sent through the Wireless Emergency Alerts system at 4 a.m. raised concerns that many cellphone users would disable WEA alerts.[83] In 2024, the Texas Department of Public Safety sent a blue alert at 4:50 a.m. to cell phones across the state, some as far as eight hours' drive away from the incident location.[77] The alert prompted thousands of complaints to the Federal Communications Commission,[76] along with public expressions of disbelief that the state government would expect private individuals to wake up in the middle of the night to search for the suspect.[84] A family in Texas claimed their child suffered a ruptured eardrum and inner ear damage, resulting in permanent hearing loss and tinnitus, when an Amber alert was pushed through his earphones at an \"ear-shattering volume\".[85] Amber alerts are often displayed on electronic message signs. The Federal Highway Administration has instructed states to display alerts on highway signs sparingly, citing safety concerns from distracted drivers and the negative impacts of traffic congestion.[86] Many states have policies in place that limit the use of Amber alerts on freeway signs. In Los Angeles, an Amber alert issued in October 2002 that was displayed on area freeway signs caused significant traffic congestion. As a result, the California Highway Patrol elected not to display the alerts during rush hour, citing safety concerns.[87] The state of Wisconsin only displays Amber alerts on freeway signs if it is deemed appropriate by the transportation department and a public safety agency. Amber alerts do not preempt messages related to traffic safety.[88] The United States Postal Service issued a postage stamp commemorating Amber alerts in May 2006. The 39-cent stamp features a chalk pastel drawing by artist Vivienne Flesher of a reunited mother and child, with the text \"AMBER ALERT saves missing children\" across the pane. The stamp was released as part of the observance of National Missing Children's Day.[89][90] In 2006, a TV movie, Amber's Story, was broadcast on Lifetime. It starred Elisabeth Röhm and Sophie Hough. A comic book entitled Amber Hagerman Deserves Justice: A Night Owl Story was published by Wham Bang Comics in 2009. Geared toward a young audience by teen author Jake Tinsley and manga artist Jason Dube, it tells Amber's story, recounts the investigation into her murder, and touches on the effect her death has had on young children and parents everywhere. It was created to promote what was then a reopened investigation into her murder.[91]",

All other posters are the responsibility of the agency whose logo appears on the poster. AMBER Alerts are usually resolved within hours. However, there are still some children who were featured in AMBER Alerts who are still missing. These children and their most up to date poster can be found below. AMBER Alerts are activated in the most serious child-abduction cases. The goal of an AMBER Alert is to instantly galvanize the community to assist in the search for and safe recovery of a missing child. These alerts are broadcast through radio, TV, road signs, cellphones, and other data-enabled devices. The AMBER Alert system is being used in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Indian country, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and 27 other countries. The U.S. Department of Justice’s Office of Justice Programs has tasked the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children with managing the AMBER Alert Secondary Distribution Program. When law enforcement issues an AMBER Alert, NCMEC is notified and re-distributes the alert to the appropriate secondary distributors. As of October 31, 2024: 1,221 children have been recovered due to AMBER Alerts, and 195 are due to WEA. AMBER Alerts are broadcast through radio, television, road signs, and the network of secondary distributors, which include digital signage, hotel chains, internet service providers, apps, and other technology. As of 2013, AMBER Alerts are also delivered to wireless phones through the Wireless Emergency Alerts program (WEA). Most people will see AMBER Alerts directly from primary distribution and secondary distributors and do not require any additional steps. You may also be notified of an AMBER Alert in the following ways: On Facebook: Visit www.facebook.com/AMBERAlert and “Like” the page to receive AMBER Alerts in your newsfeed. Facebook also automatically notifies users near the location of an AMBER Alert. On Instagram: If an AMBER Alert is activated by law enforcement and you are in the designated search area, the alert will appear in your Instagram feed. On Twitter: Follow @AMBERAlert to receive rapid AMBER Alert notifications on your Twitter feed and share the alert with your followers. Countries around the world followed the success of AMBER Alerts in the U.S. and created similar rapid alert systems. Each country adapted the system to fit its own needs and requirements but the goal remains the same — use the eyes and ears of the public to help law enforcement recover a child who is in immediate danger.

It is intended to indicate the urgency of the message and make the alert accessible to people with hearing or vision-related disabilities. The message will contain a limited number of characters and provide basic information. o In the case of an AMBER Alert, the message would indicate that an AMBER Alert has been issued for your area and, relevant information about the missing child, and if possible, the abductor and/or vehicle used in the abduction. How do AMBER Alerts work? o Once law enforcement has been notified about an abducted child, they will decide whether or not to issue an AMBER Alert based on their AMBER Alert program's criteria. They will provide the geographic area where the alert should be issued as well as any available information about the child, abductor, or suspected vehicle used in the abduction. o Once issued, the alerts are distributed by broadcasters and transportation agencies. They are also sent to NCMEC which redistribute the alerts to a network of secondary distributors that includes internet service providers, digital billboards, truckers, and others. How are AMBER Alerts distributed to cell phones? o AMBER Alerts are distributed to cell phones as part of the AMBER Alert program's secondary distribution through the Wireless Emergency Alert program (WEA). What is the Wireless Emergency Alert program? o The Wireless Emergency Alert program is operated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. It distributes notifications from authorized federal, state, local, and tribal government agencies that alert customers with capable devices of imminent threats to safety or an emergency situation. The messages are intended as a supplement to the existing Emergency Alert System, which broadcasts alerts over radio and television. o In addition to AMBER Alerts, the program includes National Weather Service, Presidential, and imminent threat alerts. If you own a capable mobile device, you will automatically receive these alerts when you are in the geographic area where an alert has been issued. o Because the alerts are sent on a special wireless carrier channel called Cell Broadcast they are not affected by congestion on the voice or SMS text channels. The alerts are transmitted simultaneously to all mobile devices within range of the cellular carrier towers in the affected area. The system does not need to know your mobile number and it does not track your whereabouts; it simply broadcasts the alert, and any mobile devices that can \"hear\" the alert will display it to the user. Will wireless customers be charged for Wireless Emergency Alert messages? o No. Wireless customers will not be charged for the receipt of these messages. How do I know if my device is Wireless Emergency Alert capable? o To determine if your mobile device is capable of receiving the alerts, visit www.ctia.org/wea and look for a link for your wireless service provider where you will find a list of mobile devices that will receive the alerts on their network. Also, be sure to ask for a capable device the next time you acquire a new mobile device. o Look for this symbol on the box Is it possible to adjust the volume of the Wireless Emergency Alert audible signal? o If a wireless device is set to vibrate only, users will not hear the audible signal from a Wireless Emergency Alert message. For additional information about adjusting the volume of a specific device or opting out of receiving the alerts, wireless customers should contact their individual wireless service providers. Where can I go to receive more information if I receive an AMBER Alert on my cell phone? o If you are notified through a Wireless Emergency Alert message that there is an AMBER Alert in your area, you can consult local media or visit www.missingkids.org/AMBER or www.amberalert.gov for more detail about the AMBER Alert.

The Seattle Seahawks struggled mightily against the Green Bay Packers to start Sunday night's Week 15 showdown, falling behind 20-3 before halftime en route to a 30-13 loss. They also lost their starting quarterback in the second half, with Geno Smith exiting halfway through the third quarter with a knee injury. On Monday, head coach Mike Macdonald told reporters that tests on Smith's knee revealed positive news, and that there's optimistic the quarterback could suit up when Seattle hosts the Minnesota Vikings Sunday. \"We're fortunate,\" Macdonald said, via the Seahawks' official website. \"A lot of positive, optimistic signs coming out of the tests. Geno's a beast, man. He was in here working out in the morning, working through it. I know he's still feeling it, but this guy is tough as nails, and hopefully we'll see him practice throughout the week, optimistic that he'll be ready for the game.\" The injury occurred when Smith, 34, backpedaled in the pocket on a first down with 7:12 left in the third quarter, throwing incomplete as Packers linebacker Edgerrin Cooper applied pressure. Cooper dove toward the quarterback's legs, however, and ultimately came down on Smith's right lower leg. While the contact was legal, it prompted some visible frustration from Smith, who proceeded to drop to the ground for further evaluation. Smith then exited the field under his own power, limping to the sidelines, while backup Sam Howell took over under center for Seattle. Howell finished the drive, leading the Seahawks to a field goal, and Smith walked to the locker room for additional treatment as the third-quarter clock ticked under six minutes, ruled questionable to return. \"It was severe enough [to keep him from returning],\" Macdonald told reporters after the game \"We'll do more tests on him. ... Structurally, it looks like it's OK. But we've gotta get an image and all that stuff ... Just don't know right now [about his availability.]\" Smith's participation in practice this week will be something to monitor, but it would appear he avoided serious injury. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive.

                "content": "Three more teams officially clinched playoff berths on Sunday, leaving just a handful of open spots left across the board for teams as the NFL regular season starts to wrap up. The Houston Texans, Pittsburgh Steelers and Minnesota Vikings all earned postseason spots on Sunday despite the Steelers actually losing to the Philadelphia Eagles and the Vikings not playing. The Vikings then rolled over the Bears in one of two games on Monday night to officially end Week 15. While the playoff picture is starting to come together, some teams — including both the Detroit Lions and Seattle Seahawks — may be in trouble. Seahawks head coach Mike Macdonald was optimistic Monday when discussing quarterback Geno Smith's knee injury from Sunday night. Smith left with the injury in the third quarter and didn't return to the game that the Packers won, 30-13. MacDonald didn't offer clarity on a specific diagnosis, but said that \"structurally, it's all there.\" He believes that Smith will practice this week and has a chance to play in Week 16 against the Vikings. \"A lot of positive, optimistic signs coming out of the tests, Macdonald said. \"Geno's a beast, man.

He was able to walk off of the field with help from trainers. pic.twitter.com/0Hgv7YK4WK — Arye Pulli (@AryePulliNFL) December 16, 2024 Smith didn't return to the game, and the Seahawks went with Sam Howell the rest of the way. Smith's status is key as the Seahawks dropped into a first-place tie with the Rams in and NFC West where the second-place team isn't projected to make the playoffs. The Detroit Lions lost a shootout to the Buffalo Bills on Sunday, which snapped an 11-game win streak for what could very easily be the best team the city has seen in decades. But it wasn't the loss that was the tough part for the Lions. It was the injuries that kept piling up. The Lions lost both cornerbacks Carlton Davis III and Khalil Dorsey to injuries in the game. Davis went down with a jaw injury that will have him out six weeks, and defensive lineman Alim McNeill tore his ACL, per NFL Network's Ian Rapoport. Running back David Montgomery is out for the season, according to head coach Dan Campbell, with a torn MCL that will require surgery. Those injuries come after a string of injuries elsewhere that have already plagued their defense, including to defensive end Aiden Hutchinson, defensive tackle Mekhi Wingo, linebacker Malcolm Rodriguez and linebacker Alex Anzalone, to name just a few. The team, whether Campbell wants to admit it's a factor or not, is incredibly beaten up. With the regular season winding down and the Lions vying for the top spot in the NFC, injuries just keep coming.

The Chiefs announced the decision Monday afternoon. Shortly before the announcement, Edwards-Helaire released a statement on social media addressing the Chiefs, Kansas City and the team's fans. \"Love ya KC!\" Edwards-Helaire wrote. \"A family I didn’t know I needed, y’all made a Kid from Baton Rouge dreams come true! To Chiefs Kingdom, its all love and the support I had in troubling times will forever be unmatched from you guys! With love!\" Edwards-Helaire has not played in a game this season. He previously announced on July 29 that he's been living with PTSD related to a fatal self-defense shooting he was involved in while he was in college. He was placed on the non-football illness list prior to Week 1. For more, read here. Diontae Johnson and the Baltimore Ravens are taking a break. The Ravens announced Monday that Johnson has been excused from team activities in the aftermath of a one-game suspension for his refusal to enter a game. The Ravens announced Johnson's status in a one-sentence statement. \"We have mutually agreed with Diontae Johnson to excuse him from team activities this week,\" the statement reads. For more, read here. The Cowboys are hoping cornerback Trevon Diggs' recovery will allow him to return for the start of the 2025 season. Diggs will miss the rest of this season with a knee injury and according to executive vice president Stephen Jones it's “a new injury that has to do with cartilage.” NFL Network's Ian Rapoport reported that recovery time could be around eight months. Diggs will need surgery and he's not expected to take part in training camp, Jones said. “I don’t think he’ll be a player during training camp. I think his timeline is going to be right about the start of the season.\" Jameis Winston has thrown eight interceptions in the last three games, which has led Browns head coach Kevin Stefanski to ponder whether to make a change at quarterback. Dorian Thompson-Robinson entered Cleveland's 21-7 loss to the Chiefs on in the fourth quarter and went 4-for-9 for 18 yards and an interception.

The team announced the decision on Monday afternoon with a statement from general manager John Lynch. \"We have suspended De'Vondre Campbell Sr. for three games due to conduct detrimental to the team,\" Lynch said in the statement. \"We will have no further comment on the matter.\" The reason the 49ers have suspended Campbell instead of cutting him is to block him from joining any other team for the rest of this season. Teams can suspend players up to four games for detrimental conduct. Read more here. According to ESPN's Jeremy Fowler, Bengals defensive end Sam Hubbard will miss the rest of the season after injuring his PCL during a touchdown catch in Sunday's 37-27 win over the Tennessee Titans. Hubbard's two-yard reception came during his sixth offensive snap of the season with the Bengals in a third-and-goal situation.

Hubbard recorded 41 total tackles, two sacks and an interception in 14 games this season for the Bengals. Per SI's Jay Morrison, that moment could also be the final one of Hubbard's seven-year Bengals career. He is due $9.5 million next season and if the team cuts him the Bengals would save $7.5 million. The Lions can't catch a break: After a slew of defensive injuries, Detroit has added running back David Montgomery to the list of players who were hurt in Sunday's loss to the Bills. Montgomery will reportedly be out indefinitely after suffering an MCL tear on Sunday. The 27-year-old running back will undergo additional testing and will get a second opinion about the injury, but it's possible that his season is over. Raiders QB Desmond Ridder is expected to start tonight vs. the Falcons, per sources. Raiders QB Aidan O’Connell is listed as questionable and is expected to work out pregame to see if he can play, but Ridder is expected to start for now. — Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) December 16, 2024 Dan Campbell's suspicion was correct and the Detroit Lions will be missing two key pieces of their defense following injuries to defensive lineman Alim McNeill and cornerback Carlton Davis III during Sunday's loss to the Buffalo Bills. McNeill is out for the year after tearing his ACL while running after Bills quarterback Josh Allen and landing awkwardly on his knee. Davis will be out indefinitely following surgery for a fractured jaw. The injury was suffered while tackling Bills running back Ray Davis. After leaving the game, he was evaluated and did not return. McNeill appeared in 14 games this season, recording 25 tackles, 7 tackles for loss and 3 1/2 sacks. Davis had two interceptions and 56 total tackles in 13 games this season, his first in Detroit. The Lions' defense has already been without Aidan Hutchinson, Alex Anzalone, Marcus Davenport, and Derrick Barnes.

QB Josh Allen's play is more important to the Bills than ever before, since their defense can't seem to stop opposing teams from scoring. Hear the full conversation on “Football 301” - and subscribe on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you listen. The Bills and Lions facing off on Sunday was perhaps the most anticipated game of Week 15. Two of the top teams in the NFL and their high-powered offenses going toe-to-toe? That's a must-watch. Buffalo emerged with the 48-42 win, but the matchup showed that even the best teams have problems that can (and likely will) hamper them as both seek the first Super Bowl victory in their respective franchise histories. The Bills won on the back of another Josh Allen superhero performance, but they gave up 42 points — 21 of which were scored in the 4th quarter. Their defense couldn't stop a late onslaught from the Lions, which is definitely a problem. Detroit's defense has been absolutely hammered by injuries throughout the season, and on Sunday they lost several more in what can only be described as a recurring nightmare. They're losing players faster than they can replace them, in a time of year when they simply cannot afford to lose any ground on defense.",

Smith left the Seahawks' Sunday night contest against Green Bay in the third quarter following a hit to his lower legs. As Sam Howell stepped in under center for Seattle, Smith was ruled \"questionable\" to return by Seattle with a knee injury, but after going to the locker room, he came out and remained on the bench, grimacing and shaking his head in discomfort.

                "title": "Penn State's Beau Pribula entering transfer portal isn't NCAA's fault",
                "content": "Before we all hop on the latest bandwagon to the end of college football as we know it, let’s collectively get smart and embrace the single basic concept we learned as children. You can’t have your cake and eat it, too. Or in this case of ever-widening player empowerment in college athletics, you can’t have everything — and still want more. Beau Pribula is a backup quarterback at Penn State, and took to social media Sunday to proclaim that the NCAA’s postseason transfer model has forced him to choose between participating in the College Football Playoff with Penn State, or entering the transfer portal. He then wrote it was “with a heavy heart” that he was entering the transfer portal. You’ve got to be kidding me. It is here where I have the gross task of defending the NCAA, a dysfunctional, do-nothing collection of presidential blowhards who proclaim that, at heart, they have the best interest of all involved. I don’t know what makes me want to puke more: speaking truth to this transfer portal nonsense, or defending the muckety-mucks at the NCAA. First and foundational: any player who enters the transfer portal doesn’t have to leave his school until he signs with another. So Pribula, a changeup quarterback who typically plays a handful of snaps a game, doesn’t have to leave the team. He can enter the portal, stay on the Penn State team through its College Football Playoff run and then negotiate with other schools. This has nothing to do with a finite number of scholarships available, and the horror stories (most of them true) of players entering the portal and eventually not finding a home. Pribula is in the portal, and every school knows he’s transferring. If there’s a market for him in the portal, schools will wait to make a decision on a quarterback – the most important position on the field – until after Penn State’s CFP run. NEW BOSSES:Where does Bill Belichick rank among the coaching hires? BEST TO WORST:Ranking the 35 college football bowl games Not that this has to be said, but what the heck: there’s another portal opening in the spring, and the NCAA – foreseeing this potential CFP/portal problem – gave players participating in the new 12-team CFP an extension to the winter transfer portal beyond the Dec. 28 closing date. In other words, there’s zero reason for Pribula (or any other college football player) to be staring at “an impossible decision,” as Pribula wrote on social media. Pribula is a communications major and graduated in three years from one of the top public universities in the country. This is not the “system” taking advantage of the player. This is the player working the system to his benefit. It should come as no surprise that less than 24 hours after Pribula’s announcement, Penn State quarterback Drew Allar announced he was returning to State College in 2025. It’s not that difficult to connect Pribula's timeline from a lifelong Penn State fan, a boy who dreamed of playing for the Nittany Lions, to a player who has done everything asked of him but can’t win the starting job, to the disappointment of sitting another year behind Allar. Pribula doesn’t have significant game tape, and any school investing in him (scholarship, revenue deal, NIL deal) would do so based on potential. Not many Power Four conference schools are spending top dollar for portal potential. In other words, the longer Pribula waits to leave Penn State, the less chance he has of connecting with a major conference school. This Penn State graduate, who has family that graduated from Penn State, who starred at Central York High School – about two hours southeast of State College – can’t be part of such a selfish move of leaving your team before the end of the season. So he makes it about the NCAA, the easy villain. BEST OF BEST:Hunter, Jeanty lead USA TODAY Sports All-America team Players already can earn off their name, image and likeness, and have free movement without the previous restraint of sitting out a season of eligibility. Beginning next season, players in all sports at universities will be paid from a media rights revenue sharing salary pool of at least $20.5 million. If the House vs. NCAA settlement case isn’t approved in July, it could be much more. Everything players have asked for – including $2.8 billion in back pay to former players from 2017 forward – has essentially been handed over by the NCAA, hat in hand. Now Pribula wants the NCAA to absolve him of guilt. Because a player who has done everything right at Penn State, who by all accounts has been the perfect teammate, can’t just walk away in the middle of a championship run. Somebody has to take the blame. Why not the NCAA? Why not hop on social media and gin up support from the vocal pitchfork, and decry how the mean men and women at the NCAA are forcing the poor, misunderstood player to make a difficult life decision. Sort of like the difficult life decision to go to Penn State in the first place. Look, players have been on the short end of this deal for three forevers, and only since 2021 have they rightfully begun to get their monetary footing. But you can’t play both sides of the story. You can’t be the one taken advantage of when you’re getting everything you want. You can’t complain about the NCAA keeping you down when you control movement and employment. Because that’s what this is now — no matter how university presidents and conference commissioners try to convince everyone it’s not with a variety of mental gymnastics. You have a job. You have responsibilities. If you walk away and look for another job, it’s on you. Not anyone else. Nearly three years ago, Jayden Daniels left Arizona State and entered the transfer portal. He spent three uneven seasons with the Sun Devils, and decided it was time to leave. Five weeks later, in late March of 2022 and during the spring portal – after his Arizona State teammates used social media to share their thoughts on his departure – Daniels signed with LSU and had two years of eligibility remaining. He then led the Tigers to back-to-back 10-win seasons, and won the Heisman Trophy in 2023. Maybe you can have your cake and eat it, too. Just don't blame the NCAA when it doesn't taste like it should. Matt Hayes is the senior national college football writer for USA TODAY Sports Network. Follow him on X at @MattHayesCFB.",

                "title": "Why Did Penn State QB Beau Pribula Enter the Transfer Portal? James Franklin: He Was Put in 'No-Win' Situation | State College, PA",
                "content": "Penn State Union Raises Concerns Over University Plan to Partner With Private Developer on Housing Project New Pub to Open in Downtown Bellefonte Penn State Backup QB Beau Pribula Entering Transfer Portal, Will Depart Before CFP By – The biggest story in college football currently surrounds one of Penn State’s quarterbacks. Not Drew Allar, who announced his return for the 2025 season on Monday, but backup Beau Pribula, who is set to enter the transfer portal and has left the program before Saturday’s first-round College Football Playoff game against SMU. With Allar’s return, Pribula’s decision to transfer should hardly come as a surprise. What is surprising, however, is the timing. It’s a story of the NCAA calendar and the transfer portal window. It’s a story surrounding a clear flaw in the college landscape, where players are tasked with choosing between competing in the postseason and balancing opportunities for their future. James Franklin and Pribula have chatted for weeks about this process. Last week, Pribula entered Franklin’s office and declared he had no intentions of leaving before the playoffs. But after feeling pressured to visit interested schools while practicing for the Mustangs, Pribula did not feel as if he could prepare to the best of his abilities, Franklin said. “We got problems in college football. And I can give you my word, Beau Pribula did not want to leave our program, and he did not want to leave our program until the end of the season,” Franklin said. “But the way the portal is and the timing of it, and the way our team is playing, and when you play the position of quarterback, and there’s only one spot, and those spots are filling up, he felt like he was put in a no-win situation. And I agree with him.” Pribula showcased throughout the season that he’s likely good enough to start for a Power Four team. His role wasn’t limited only to backup opportunities. Pribula was a spark plug in two-quarterback sets that gave opponents something unique and difficult to gameplan for. And when he was asked to replace Allar, who was injured for the second half at Wisconsin, Pribula excelled. Franklin has no quarrels with Pribula’s decision to transfer. He understands it. But what he’s not content with is the system that leaves players, like Pribula, with the impossible decision to play through the postseason or begin looking for opportunities to benefit his future. “I hate for it, No. 1, most importantly, for Beau Pribula. I don’t think it’s in the best interest of the student athlete. I don’t think it’s in the best interest of college football. But I think that’s our challenge right now, right? Who is really running college football and making the best decisions for the student athletes and for our sport as a whole?,” Franklin said. “Beau should not be put in this position.” What’s the solution? Franklin has asked himself this, just as many coaches across the country likely have. Franklin has weighed whether shortening the regular season or eliminating conference championship games could help align the season with the academic calendar. Whatever the solution may be, it’s clear there’s a problem with the current model. “To have a transfer portal/free agency, going on right in the middle of the playoffs, it’s just a lot of things that don’t really make sense,” Franklin said. There’s one suggestion Franklin has been adamant about for years, and Pribula’s transfer has only amplified his calls. Franklin said it’s “obvious” a commissioner of college football is needed. That would be step one in cleaning up a landscape with money flowing and guardrails almost nonexistent. But in Franklin’s eyes, not just anyone could assume this role. “We need somebody running college football,” Franklin said. “We need somebody that is not biased based on a conference, and that is out of the financial impacts of it, as well. Because if you’re just making the decisions which are in the best interest of student athletes in college football, then I think you can do it. But if you’re biased by a specific conference or if you’re impacted by making all your decisions based on revenue and earnings, then we’re never going to get to a good place.” Just as Franklin understands Pribula’s decision to transfer, he gets that some people across the country will ask why Penn State’s backup quarterback couldn’t finish the season with his team. The fact of the matter is, Pribula was hardly left with a choice. Stay and miss out on opportunities, leave and face backlash. “I’m concerned for college football right now, in general, to be honest with you, and I think a lot of people are,” Franklin said. “… Why have we created a system where this guy couldn’t finish this season with his team?” Receive all the latest news and events right to your inbox.

I don’t think it’s in the best interest of college football.”The transfer portal for football opened last Monday, Dec. 9, the day after the Lions formally received a berth in the first 12-team playoff against SMU, and will close Dec. 28, a 19-day period that runs through the first-round games and preparation for quarterfinals. Imagine NFL free agency beginning a week before the playoffs and continuing for almost three weeks during the playoffs. That’s what’s going on now in college football. It’s nuts.“It’s unfortunate that it has to be this way,” Allar said. “I know Beau didn’t necessarily want it to be this way. Unfortunately, that’s the landscape of college football right now.“He’s been a part of our offense throughout the year. He’s one of the reasons why we’re here. It sucks that he’s not able to go out there and play with us on Saturday.”Franklin said he and Pribula met several times to try to find a way for him to stay with the team once he expressed interest in transferring.Why wouldn’t Franklin want Pribula to stay? His role increased this season with new offensive coordinator Andy Kotelnicki.He completed 26-of-35 passes for 275 yards and five touchdowns with one interception and rushed 38 times for 242 yards and four touchdowns. When Allar sustained a knee injury in the first half at Wisconsin in October, Pribula helped lead Penn State to a 28-13 comeback win.“We talked about a ton of different scenarios,” Franklin said. “The more we talked about and the more we went through it, Beau felt like he was going to have a hard time finishing school, finding a new place and still preparing like a starter like he had been doing all year.“He was out at practice Sunday and I could tell he was distracted by all of this. We were open to different solutions and coming up with scenarios that could work for everybody. We just couldn’t get to a point where everybody felt like it was going to work out in everybody’s best interests.”Pribula’s absence leaves the Lions without a backup quarterback who has played even one snap in college. The No. 2 guy most likely will be freshman Ethan Grunkemeyer.“As the head coach, I have a responsibility for Penn State and our football program but I also have a responsibility for Beau Pribula,” Franklin said. “I hate it. I hate it for him. I hate it for Penn State. I also don’t think it’s the right thing for college football.”Franklin again pleaded for the sport to have a commissioner with no vested interest in a particular conference. He pleaded for the calendar to be changed either by shortening the regular season, starting it earlier or pushing the transfer portal back.That doesn’t help Beau Pribula, who is one of the most popular guys among his Penn State teammates.“He’s a wonderful young man,” Franklin said. “I would recruit him every year. Knowing everything I know right now, I’d go back and recruit the heck out of Beau. Beau grew up wanting to come to Penn State his whole life. This is his dream school. He had a phenomenal career here.“I want everybody to understand that and why we created a system in which this guy couldn’t finish this season with his team.” He should receive sympathy for being backed into a corner by the college football calendar.

When Allar sustained a knee injury in the first half at Wisconsin in October, Pribula helped lead Penn State to a 28-13 comeback win. “We talked about a ton of different scenarios,” Franklin said. “The more we talked about and the more we went through it, Beau felt like he was going to have a hard time finishing school, finding a new place and still preparing like a starter like he had been doing all year. “He was out at practice Sunday and I could tell he was distracted by all of this. We were open to different solutions and coming up with scenarios that could work for everybody. We just couldn’t get to a point where everybody felt like it was going to work out in everybody’s best interests.” Pribula’s absence leaves the Lions without a backup quarterback who has played even one snap in college. The No. 2 guy most likely will be freshman Ethan Grunkemeyer. “As the head coach, I have a responsibility for Penn State and our football program but I also have a responsibility for Beau Pribula,” Franklin said. “I hate it. I hate it for him. I hate it for Penn State. I also don’t think it’s the right thing for college football.” Franklin again pleaded for the sport to have a commissioner with no vested interest in a particular conference. He pleaded for the calendar to be changed either by shortening the regular season, starting it earlier or pushing the transfer portal back. That doesn’t help Beau Pribula, who is one of the most popular guys among his Penn State teammates. “He’s a wonderful young man,” Franklin said. “I would recruit him every year. Knowing everything I know right now, I’d go back and recruit the heck out of Beau. Beau grew up wanting to come to Penn State his whole life. This is his dream school. He had a phenomenal career here. “I want everybody to understand that and why we created a system in which this guy couldn’t finish this season with his team.” Copyright © 2024 MediaNews Group",

                "content": "– in Europe (light green & dark grey)– in the European Union (light green) Germany,[e] officially the Federal Republic of Germany,[f] is a country in Central Europe. It lies between the Baltic and North Sea to the north and the Alps to the south. Its sixteen constituent states have a total population of over 82 million in an area of 357,596 km2 (138,069 sq mi), making it the most populous member state of the European Union. It borders Denmark to the north, Poland and the Czech Republic to the east, Austria and Switzerland to the south, and France, Luxembourg, Belgium, and the Netherlands to the west. The nation's capital and most populous city is Berlin and its main financial centre is Frankfurt; the largest urban area is the Ruhr. Settlement in the territory of modern Germany began in the Lower Paleolithic, with various tribes inhabiting it from the Neolithic onward, chiefly the Celts. Various Germanic tribes have inhabited the northern parts of modern Germany since classical antiquity. A region named Germania was documented before AD 100. In 962, the Kingdom of Germany formed the bulk of the Holy Roman Empire. During the 16th century, northern German regions became the centre of the Protestant Reformation. Following the Napoleonic Wars and the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, the German Confederation was formed in 1815. Formal unification of Germany into the modern nation-state commenced on 18 August 1866 with the North German Confederation Treaty establishing the Prussia-led North German Confederation, which became the German Empire in 1871. After World War I and the German Revolution of 1918–1919, the Empire was replaced by the Weimar Republic. The Nazi rise to power in 1933 led to the establishment of a totalitarian dictatorship, World War II, and the Holocaust. In 1949, after the war and a period of Allied occupation, Germany was organized into two separate polities with limited sovereignty: the Federal Republic of Germany, or West Germany, and the German Democratic Republic, or East Germany. Berlin continued its de jure Four Power status. The Federal Republic of Germany was a founding member of the European Economic Community and the European Union, while the German Democratic Republic was a communist Eastern Bloc state and member of the Warsaw Pact. After the fall of the communist led-government in East Germany, German reunification saw the former East German states join the Federal Republic of Germany on 3 October 1990. Germany has been described as a great power with a strong economy; it has the largest economy in Europe by nominal GDP. As a global power in industrial, scientific and technological sectors, it is both the world's third-largest exporter and importer. As a developed country, it offers social security, a universal health care system, and tuition-free university education. Germany is a member of the United Nations, Council of Europe, NATO and OECD, and a founding member of the European Union, G7 and G20. It has the third-highest number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites, 54, of which 51 are cultural. The English word Germany derives from the Latin Germania, which came into use after Julius Caesar adopted it for the peoples east of the Rhine.[12] The German term Deutschland, originally diutisciu land ('the German lands'), is derived from deutsch (cf. Dutch), descended from Old High German diutisc 'of the people' (from diot or diota 'people'), originally used to distinguish the language of the common people from Latin and its Romance descendants. This in turn descends from Proto-Germanic *þiudiskaz 'of the people' (see also the Latinised form Theodiscus), derived from *þeudō, descended from Proto-Indo-European *tewtéh₂- 'people', from which the word Teutons also originates.[13] Pre-human ancestors, the Danuvius guggenmosi, who were present in Germany over 11 million years ago, are theorized to be among the earliest ones to walk on two legs.[14] Ancient humans were present in Germany at least 600,000 years ago.[15] The first non-modern human fossil (the Neanderthal) was discovered in the Neander Valley.[16] Similarly dated evidence of modern humans has been found in the Swabian Jura, including 42,000-year-old flutes which are the oldest musical instruments ever found,[17] the 40,000-year-old Lion Man,[18] and the 41,000-year-old Venus of Hohle Fels.[19][20] The Nebra sky disk, created during the European Bronze Age, has been attributed to a German site.[21] The Germanic peoples are thought to have emerged from the Jastorf culture during the Nordic Bronze Age or early Iron Age.[22][23] From southern Scandinavia and northern Germany, they expanded south, east, and west, coming into contact with the Celtic, Iranian, Baltic, and Slavic tribes.[24][25] Southern Germany was inhabited by Celtic-speaking peoples, who belonged to the wider La Tène culture. They were later assimilated by the Germanic conquerors.[26] Under Augustus, the Roman Empire began to invade lands inhabited by the Germanic tribes, creating a short-lived Roman province of Germania between the Rhine and Elbe rivers. In 9 AD, three Roman legions were defeated by Arminius in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest.[27] The outcome of this battle dissuaded the Romans from their ambition of conquering Germania and is thus considered one of the most important events in European history.[28] By 100 AD, when Tacitus wrote Germania, Germanic tribes had settled along the Rhine and the Danube (the Limes Germanicus), occupying most of modern Germany. However, Baden-Württemberg, southern Bavaria, southern Hesse and the western Rhineland had been incorporated into Roman provinces.[29][30][31] Around 260, Germanic peoples broke into Roman-controlled lands.[32] After the invasion of the Huns in 375, and with the decline of Rome from 395, Germanic tribes moved farther southwest: the Franks established the Frankish Kingdom and pushed east to subjugate Saxony and Bavaria. Areas of what is today eastern Germany were inhabited by Western Slavic tribes.[29] Charlemagne founded the Carolingian Empire in 800; it was divided in 843.[33] The eastern successor kingdom of East Francia stretched from the Rhine in the west to the Elbe river in the east and from the North Sea to the Alps.[33] Subsequently, the Holy Roman Empire emerged from it. The Ottonian rulers (919–1024) consolidated several major duchies.[34] In 996, Gregory V became the first German Pope, appointed by his cousin Otto III, whom he shortly after crowned Holy Roman Emperor. The Holy Roman Empire absorbed northern Italy and Burgundy under the Salian emperors (1024–1125), although the emperors lost power through the Investiture controversy.[35] Under the Hohenstaufen emperors (1138–1254), German princes encouraged German settlement to the south and east (Ostsiedlung).[36] Members of the Hanseatic League, mostly north German towns, prospered in the expansion of trade.[37] The population declined starting with the Great Famine in 1315, followed by the Black Death of 1348–1350.[38] The Golden Bull issued in 1356 provided the constitutional structure of the Empire and codified the election of the emperor by seven prince-electors.[39] Johannes Gutenberg introduced moveable-type printing to Europe, laying the basis for the democratization of knowledge.[40] In 1517, Martin Luther incited the Protestant Reformation and his translation of the Bible began the standardization of the language; the 1555 Peace of Augsburg tolerated the \"Evangelical\" faith (Lutheranism), but also decreed that the faith of the prince was to be the faith of his subjects (cuius regio, eius religio).[41] From the Cologne War through the Thirty Years' Wars (1618–1648), religious conflict devastated German lands and significantly reduced the population.[42][43] The Peace of Westphalia ended religious warfare among the Imperial Estates.[42] The legal system initiated by a series of Imperial Reforms (approximately 1495–1555) provided for considerable local autonomy and a stronger Imperial Diet.[44] The House of Habsburg held the imperial crown from 1438 until the death of Charles VI in 1740. Following the War of the Austrian Succession and the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, Charles VI's daughter Maria Theresa ruled as empress consort when her husband, Francis I, became emperor.[45][46] From 1740, dualism between the Austrian Habsburg monarchy and the Kingdom of Prussia dominated German history. In 1772, 1793, and 1795, Prussia and Austria, along with the Russian Empire, agreed to the Partitions of Poland.[47][48] During the period of the French Revolutionary Wars, the Napoleonic era and the subsequent final meeting of the Imperial Diet, most of the Free Imperial Cities were annexed by dynastic territories; the ecclesiastical territories were secularised and annexed. In 1806 the Imperium was dissolved; France, Russia, Prussia, and the Habsburgs (Austria) competed for hegemony in the German states during the Napoleonic Wars.[49] Following the fall of Napoleon, the Congress of Vienna founded the German Confederation, a loose league of 39 sovereign states. The appointment of the emperor of Austria as the permanent president reflected the Congress's rejection of Prussia's rising influence. Disagreement within restoration politics partly led to the rise of liberal movements, followed by new measures of repression by Austrian statesman Klemens von Metternich.[50][51] The Zollverein, a tariff union, furthered economic unity.[52] In light of revolutionary movements in Europe, intellectuals and commoners started the revolutions of 1848 in the German states, raising the German question. King Frederick William IV of Prussia was offered the title of emperor, but with a loss of power; he rejected the crown and the proposed constitution, a temporary setback for the movement.[53] King William I appointed Otto von Bismarck as the Minister President of Prussia in 1862. Bismarck successfully concluded the war with Denmark in 1864; the subsequent decisive Prussian victory in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 enabled him to create the North German Confederation which excluded Austria. After the defeat of France in the Franco-Prussian War, the German princes proclaimed the founding of the German Empire in 1871. Prussia was the dominant constituent state of the new empire; the King of Prussia ruled as its Kaiser, and Berlin became its capital.[54][55] In the Gründerzeit period following the unification of Germany, Bismarck's foreign policy as chancellor of Germany secured Germany's position as a great nation by forging alliances and avoiding war.[55] However, under Wilhelm II, Germany took an imperialistic course, leading to friction with neighbouring countries.[56] A dual alliance was created with the multinational realm of Austria-Hungary; the Triple Alliance of 1882 included Italy. Britain, France and Russia also concluded alliances to protect against Habsburg interference with Russian interests in the Balkans or German interference against France.[57] At the Berlin Conference in 1884, Germany claimed several colonies including German East Africa, German South West Africa, Togoland, and Kamerun.[58] Later, Germany further expanded its colonial empire to include holdings in the Pacific and China.[59] The colonial government in South West Africa (present-day Namibia), from 1904 to 1907, carried out the annihilation of the local Herero and Namaqua peoples as punishment for an uprising;[60][61] this was the 20th century's first genocide.[61] The assassination of Austria's crown prince on 28 June 1914 provided the pretext for Austria-Hungary to attack Serbia and trigger World War I. After four years of warfare, in which approximately two million German soldiers were killed,[62] a general armistice ended the fighting. In the German Revolution (November 1918), Wilhelm II and the ruling princes abdicated their positions, and Germany was declared a federal republic. Germany's new leadership signed the Treaty of Versailles in 1919, accepting defeat by the Allies. Germans perceived the treaty as humiliating, which was seen by historians as influential in the rise of Adolf Hitler.[63] Germany lost around 13% of its European territory and ceded all of its colonial possessions in Africa and the Pacific.[64] On 11 August 1919, President Friedrich Ebert signed the democratic Weimar Constitution.[65] Communists briefly seized power in Bavaria and a few larger cities, while conservative elements failed to overthrow the central government in the 1920 Kapp Putsch. The occupation of the Ruhr by Belgian and French troops and a period of hyperinflation followed. A plan to restructure Germany's war reparations and the creation of a new currency in 1924 helped stabilise the government and ushered in the Golden Twenties, an era of artistic innovation and liberal cultural life.[66][67][68] The worldwide Great Depression hit Germany in 1929, and by 1932 the unemployment rate had risen to 24%.[69] The Nazi Party led by Adolf Hitler became the largest party in the Reichstag after the election of July 1932, and President Hindenburg appointed Hitler chancellor on 30 January 1933.[70] After the Reichstag fire, a decree abrogated basic civil rights, and the first Nazi concentration camp opened.[71][72] On 23 March 1933, the Enabling Act gave Hitler unrestricted legislative power, overriding the constitution,[73] and marked the beginning of Nazi Germany. His government established a centralised totalitarian state, withdrew from the League of Nations, and dramatically increased the country's rearmament.[74] A government-sponsored programme for economic renewal focused on public works, the most famous of which was the Autobahn.[75] In 1935, the regime withdrew from the Treaty of Versailles and introduced the Nuremberg Laws which targeted Jews and other minorities.[76] Germany also reacquired control of the Saarland in 1935,[77] remilitarised the Rhineland in 1936, annexed Austria in 1938, annexed the Sudetenland in 1938 with the Munich Agreement, and in violation of the agreement occupied Czechoslovakia in March 1939.[78] Kristallnacht (Night of Broken Glass) saw the burning of synagogues, the destruction of Jewish businesses, and mass arrests of Jewish people.[79] In August 1939, Hitler's government negotiated the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact that divided Eastern Europe into German and Soviet spheres of influence.[80] On 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland, beginning World War II in Europe;[81] Britain and France declared war on Germany on 3 September.[82] In the spring of 1940, Germany conquered Denmark and Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and France, forcing the French government to sign an armistice. The British repelled German air attacks in the Battle of Britain in the same year. In 1941, German troops invaded Yugoslavia, Greece and the Soviet Union. By 1942, Germany and its allies controlled most of continental Europe and North Africa, but following the Soviet victory at the Battle of Stalingrad, the Allied reconquest of North Africa and invasion of Italy in 1943, German forces suffered repeated military defeats. In 1944, the Soviets pushed into Eastern Europe; the Western allies landed in France and entered Germany despite a final German counteroffensive. Following Hitler's suicide during the Battle of Berlin, Germany signed the surrender document on 8 May 1945, ending World War II in Europe[81][83] and Nazi Germany. Following the end of the war, surviving Nazi officials were tried for war crimes at the Nuremberg trials.[84][85] In what later became known as the Holocaust, the German government persecuted minorities, including interning them in concentration and death camps across Europe. The regime systematically murdered 6 million Jews, at least 130,000 Romani, 275,000 disabled, thousands of Jehovah's Witnesses, thousands of homosexuals, and hundreds of thousands of political and religious opponents.[86] Nazi policies in German-occupied countries resulted in the deaths of an estimated 2.7 million Poles,[87] 1.3 million Ukrainians, 1 million Belarusians and 3.5 million Soviet prisoners of war.[88][84] German military casualties have been estimated at 5.3 million,[89] and around 900,000 German civilians died.[90] Around 12 million ethnic Germans were expelled from across Eastern Europe, and Germany lost roughly one-quarter of its pre-war territory.[91] After Nazi Germany surrendered, the Allies de jure abolished the German state and partitioned Berlin and Germany's remaining territory into four occupation zones. The western sectors, controlled by France, the United Kingdom, and the United States, were merged on 23 May 1949 to form the Federal Republic of Germany (German: Bundesrepublik Deutschland); on 7 October 1949, the Soviet Zone became the German Democratic Republic (GDR) (German: Deutsche Demokratische Republik; DDR). They were informally known as West Germany and East Germany.[92] East Germany selected East Berlin as its capital, while West Germany chose Bonn as a provisional capital, to emphasise its stance that the two-state solution was temporary.[93] West Germany was established as a federal parliamentary republic with a \"social market economy\". Starting in 1948 West Germany became a major recipient of reconstruction aid under the American Marshall Plan.[94] Konrad Adenauer was elected the first federal chancellor of Germany in 1949. The country enjoyed prolonged economic growth (Wirtschaftswunder) beginning in the early 1950s.[95] West Germany joined NATO in 1955 and was a founding member of the European Economic Community.[96] On 1 January 1957, the Saarland joined West Germany.[97] East Germany was an Eastern Bloc state under political and military control by the Soviet Union via occupation forces and the Warsaw Pact. Although East Germany claimed to be a democracy, political power was exercised solely by leading members (Politbüro) of the communist-controlled Socialist Unity Party of Germany, supported by the Stasi, an immense secret service.[98] While East German propaganda was based on the benefits of the GDR's social programmes and the alleged threat of a West German invasion, many of its citizens looked to the West for freedom and prosperity.[99] The Berlin Wall, built in 1961, prevented East German citizens from escaping to West Germany, becoming a symbol of the Cold War.[100] Tensions between East and West Germany were reduced in the late 1960s by Chancellor Willy Brandt's Ostpolitik.[101] In 1989, Hungary decided to dismantle the Iron Curtain and open its border with Austria, causing the emigration of thousands of East Germans to West Germany via Hungary and Austria. This had devastating effects on the GDR, where regular mass demonstrations received increasing support. In an effort to help retain East Germany as a state, the East German authorities eased border restrictions, but this actually led to an acceleration of the Wende reform process culminating in the Two Plus Four Treaty under which Germany regained full sovereignty. This permitted German reunification on 3 October 1990, with the accession of the five re-established states of the former GDR.[102] The fall of the Wall in 1989 became a symbol of the Fall of Communism, the dissolution of the Soviet Union, German reunification and Die Wende (\"the turning point\").[103] United Germany was considered the enlarged continuation of West Germany so it retained its memberships in international organisations.[104] Based on the Berlin/Bonn Act (1994), Berlin again became the capital of Germany, while Bonn obtained the unique status of a Bundesstadt (federal city) retaining some federal ministries.[105] The relocation of the government was completed in 1999, and modernisation of the East German economy was scheduled to last until 2019.[106][107] Since reunification, Germany has taken a more active role in the European Union, signing the Maastricht Treaty in 1992 and the Lisbon Treaty in 2007,[108] and co-founding the eurozone.[109] Germany sent a peacekeeping force to secure stability in the Balkans and sent German troops to Afghanistan as part of a NATO effort to provide security in that country after the ousting of the Taliban.[110][111] In the 2005 elections, Angela Merkel became the first female chancellor. In 2009, the German government approved a €50 billion stimulus plan.[112] Among the major German political projects of the early 21st century are the advancement of European integration, the energy transition (Energiewende) for a sustainable energy supply, the debt brake for balanced budgets, measures to increase the fertility rate (pronatalism), and high-tech strategies for the transition of the German economy, summarised as Industry 4.0.[113] During the 2015 European migrant crisis, the country took in over a million refugees and migrants.[114] Germany is the seventh-largest country in Europe.[4] It borders Denmark to the north, Poland and Czechia to the east, Austria and Switzerland to the south, and France, Luxembourg, Belgium, and the Netherlands to the west. Germany is also bordered by the North Sea and, at the north-northeast, by the Baltic Sea. German territory covers 357,596 km2 (138,069 sq mi).[6] Elevation ranges from the mountains of the Alps (highest point: the Zugspitze at 2,963 metres or 9,721 feet) in the south to the shores of the North Sea (Nordsee) in the northwest and the Baltic Sea (Ostsee) in the northeast. The forested uplands of central Germany and the lowlands of northern Germany (lowest point: in the municipality Neuendorf-Sachsenbande, Wilstermarsch at 3.54 metres or 11.6 feet below sea level[115]) are traversed by such major rivers as the Rhine, Danube and Elbe. Significant natural resources include iron ore, coal, potash, timber, lignite, uranium, copper, natural gas, salt, and nickel.[4] Most of Germany has a temperate climate, ranging from oceanic in the north and west to continental in the east and southeast. Winters range from the cold in the Southern Alps to cool and are generally overcast with limited precipitation, while summers can vary from hot and dry to cool and rainy. The northern regions have prevailing westerly winds that bring in moist air from the North Sea, moderating the temperature and increasing precipitation. Conversely, the southeast regions have more extreme temperatures.[116] From February 2019 – 2020, average monthly temperatures in Germany ranged from a low of 3.3 °C (37.9 °F) in January 2020 to a high of 19.8 °C (67.6 °F) in June 2019.[117] Average monthly precipitation ranged from 30 litres per square metre in February and April 2019 to 125 litres per square metre in February 2020.[118] Average monthly hours of sunshine ranged from 45 in November 2019 to 300 in June 2019.[119] The territory of Germany can be divided into five terrestrial ecoregions: Atlantic mixed forests, Baltic mixed forests, Central European mixed forests, Western European broadleaf forests, and Alps conifer and mixed forests.[120] As of 2016[update], 51% of Germany's land area is devoted to agriculture, while 30% is forested and 14% is covered by settlements or infrastructure.[121] Plants and animals include those generally common to Central Europe. According to the National Forest Inventory, beeches, oaks, and other deciduous trees constitute just over 40% of the forests; roughly 60% are conifers, particularly spruce and pine.[122] There are many species of ferns, flowers, fungi, and mosses. Wild animals include roe deer, wild boar, mouflon (a subspecies of wild sheep), fox, badger, hare, and small numbers of the Eurasian beaver.[123] The blue cornflower was once a German national symbol.[124] The 16 national parks in Germany include the Jasmund National Park, the Vorpommern Lagoon Area National Park, the Müritz National Park, the Wadden Sea National Parks, the Harz National Park, the Hainich National Park, the Black Forest National Park, the Saxon Switzerland National Park, the Bavarian Forest National Park and the Berchtesgaden National Park.[125] In addition, there are 17 Biosphere Reserves,[126] and 105 nature parks.[127] More than 400 zoos and animal parks operate in Germany.[128] The Berlin Zoo, which opened in 1844, is the oldest in Germany, and claims the most comprehensive collection of species in the world.[129] Germany is a federal, parliamentary, representative democratic republic. Federal legislative power is vested in the parliament consisting of the Bundestag (Federal Diet) and Bundesrat (Federal Council), which together form the legislative body. The Bundestag is elected through direct elections using the mixed-member proportional representation system. The members of the Bundesrat represent and are appointed by the governments of the sixteen federated states.[4] The German political system operates under a framework laid out in the 1949 constitution known as the Grundgesetz (Basic Law). Amendments generally require a two-thirds majority of both the Bundestag and the Bundesrat; the fundamental principles of the constitution, as expressed in the articles guaranteeing human dignity, the separation of powers, the federal structure, and the rule of law, are valid in perpetuity.[130] The president, currently Frank-Walter Steinmeier, is the head of state and invested primarily with representative responsibilities and powers. He is elected by the Bundesversammlung (federal convention), an institution consisting of the members of the Bundestag and an equal number of state delegates.[4] The second-highest official in the German order of precedence is the Bundestagspräsident (President of the Bundestag), who is elected by the Bundestag and responsible for overseeing the daily sessions of the body.[131] The third-highest official and the head of government is the chancellor, who is appointed by the Bundespräsident after being elected by the party or coalition with the most seats in the Bundestag.[4] The chancellor, currently Olaf Scholz, is the head of government and exercises executive power through his Cabinet.[4] Since 1949, the party system has been dominated by the Christian Democratic Union and the Social Democratic Party of Germany. So far every chancellor has been a member of one of these parties. However, the smaller liberal Free Democratic Party and the Alliance 90/The Greens have also been junior partners in coalition governments. Since 2007, the democratic socialist party The Left has been a staple in the German Bundestag, though they have never been part of the federal government. In the 2017 German federal election, the right-wing populist Alternative for Germany gained enough votes to attain representation in the parliament for the first time.[132][133] Germany is a federation and comprises sixteen constituent states which are collectively referred to as Länder.[134] Each state (Land) has its own constitution,[135] and is largely autonomous in regard to its internal organisation.[134] As of 2017[update], Germany is divided into 401 districts (Kreise) at a municipal level; these consist of 294 rural districts and 107 urban districts.[136] Germany has a civil law system based on Roman law with some references to Germanic law.[140] The Bundesverfassungsgericht (Federal Constitutional Court) is the German Supreme Court responsible for constitutional matters, with power of judicial review.[141] Germany's specialized supreme court system includes the inquisitorial Federal Court of Justice for civil and criminal cases, along with the Federal Labour Court, Federal Social Court, Federal Fiscal Court, and Federal Administrative Court for other matters.[142] Criminal and private laws are codified on the national level in the Strafgesetzbuch and the Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch respectively. The German penal system seeks the rehabilitation of the criminal and the protection of the public.[143] With the exceptions of petty crimes, tried by a single professional judge, and of serious political crimes, all charges are adjudicated by mixed tribunals where lay judges (Schöffen) and professional judges preside together.[144][145] As of 2016, Germany's murder rate stood at a low of 1.18 murders per 100,000.[146] In 2018, the overall crime rate fell to its lowest since 1992.[147] Same-sex marriage has been legal in Germany since 2017, and LGBT rights are generally protected in the nation.[148] Germany has a network of 227 diplomatic missions abroad[149] and maintains relations with more than 190 countries.[150] Germany is a member of NATO, the OECD, the G7, the G20, the World Bank and the IMF. It has played an influential role in the European Union since its inception and has maintained a strong alliance with France and all neighbouring countries since 1990. Germany promotes the creation of a more unified European political, economic and security apparatus.[151][152][153] The governments of Germany and the United States are close political allies.[154] Cultural ties and economic interests have crafted a bond between the two countries resulting in Atlanticism. [155] After 1990, Germany and Russia worked together to establish a \"strategic partnership\" in which energy development became one of the most important factors. As a result of the cooperation, Germany imported most of its natural gas and crude oil from Russia.[156][157] Germany's development policy functions as a distinct sector within its foreign policy framework. It is formulated by the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development and carried out by the implementing organisations. The German government sees development policy as a joint responsibility of the international community.[158] It was the world's second-biggest aid donor in 2019 after the United States.[159] Germany's military, the Bundeswehr (Federal Defence), is organised into the Heer (Army and special forces KSK), Marine (Navy), Luftwaffe (Air Force) and Cyber- und Informationsraum (Cyber and Information Domain Service) branches.[160] In absolute terms, German military spending in 2023 was the seventh-highest in the world.[161] In response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced that German military expenditure would be increased past the NATO target of 2%, along with a one-time 2022 infusion of 100 billion euros, representing almost double the 53 billion euro military budget for 2021.[162][163] In 2023, military spending according to NATO criteria amounted to $73.1 billion, or 1.64% of the country's GDP, well below the NATO target of 2%. In 2024, Germany reported $97.7 billion to NATO, exceeding the NATO target of 2% at 2.12% of GDP.[164] As of May 2024[update], the Bundeswehr has a strength of 180,215 active soldiers and 80,761 civilians.[165] Reservists are available to the armed forces and participate in defence exercises and deployments abroad.[166] Until 2011, military service was compulsory for men at age 18, but this has been officially suspended and replaced with a voluntary service.[167][168] Since 2001 women may serve in all functions of service without restriction.[169] According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, Germany was the fifth-largest exporter of major arms in the world from 2019 to 2023.[170] In peacetime, the Bundeswehr is commanded by the Minister of Defence. In state of defence, the Chancellor would become commander-in-chief of the Bundeswehr.[171] The role of the Bundeswehr is described in the Constitution of Germany as defensive only. But after a ruling of the Federal Constitutional Court in 1994, the term \"defence\" has been defined not only to include protection of the borders of Germany, but also crisis reaction and conflict prevention, or more broadly as guarding the security of Germany anywhere in the world. As of 2017,[update] the German military has about 3,600 troops stationed in foreign countries as part of international peacekeeping forces, including about 1,200 supporting operations against Daesh, 980 in the NATO-led Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan, and 800 in Kosovo.[172][173] Germany has a social market economy with a highly skilled labour force, a low level of corruption,[175] and a high level of innovation.[176] It is the world's third-largest exporter and third-largest importer,[4] and has the largest economy in Europe by nominal GDP, which is also the world's third-largest economy by nominal GDP[177] and sixth-largest by PPP-adjusted GDP.[178] Its GDP per capita measured in purchasing power standards amounts to 121% of the EU27 average.[179] The country's service sector contributes approximately 69% of the total GDP, industry 31%—with Germany having the largest manufacturing sector in Europe—and agriculture 1% as of 2017[update].[4] The unemployment rate published by Eurostat amounts to 3.2% as of January 2020[update], which is the fourth-lowest in the EU.[180] Germany is part of the European single market which represents more than 450 million consumers.[181] In 2017, the country accounted for 28% of the eurozone economy according to the International Monetary Fund.[182] Germany introduced the common European currency, the euro, in 2002.[183] Its monetary policy is set by the European Central Bank, which is headquartered in Frankfurt.[184][174] The automotive industry in Germany is regarded as one of the most competitive and innovative in the world,[185] and is the sixth-largest by production as of 2021. Germany is home to Volkswagen Group, the world's second-largest automotive manufacturer by vehicle production.[186] The top ten exports of Germany are vehicles, machinery, chemical goods, electronic products, electrical equipments, pharmaceuticals, transport equipments, basic metals, food products, and rubber and plastics.[188] Of the world's 500 largest stock-market-listed companies measured by revenue in 2023, the Fortune Global 500, 32 are headquartered in Germany.[189] 30 major Germany-based companies are included in the DAX, the German stock market index which is operated by Frankfurt Stock Exchange.[190] Well-known international brands include Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Volkswagen, Audi, Porsche, Opel, Siemens, Allianz, Adidas, Puma, Hugo Boss, SAP SE, Bosch and Deutsche Telekom.[191] Berlin is a hub for startup companies and has become the leading location for venture capital-funded firms in the European Union.[192] Germany is recognised for its large portion of specialised small and medium enterprises, known as the Mittelstand model.[193] These companies represent 48% of the global market leaders in their segments, labelled hidden champions.[194] Research and development efforts form an integral part of the German economy,[195] with the country ranking fourth in research and development expenditure since 2005.[196] In 2018, Germany ranked fourth globally in terms of number of science and engineering research papers published[197] and third in the quality-adjusted Nature Index in 2023.[198] Research institutions in Germany include the Max Planck Society, the Helmholtz Association, and the Fraunhofer Society and the Leibniz Association.[199] Germany is the largest contributor to the European Space Agency.[200] Germany was ranked 9th in the Global Innovation Index in 2024.[201] With its central position in Europe, Germany is a transport hub for the continent.[202] Its road network is among the densest in Europe.[203] The motorway (Autobahn) is widely known for having no general federally mandated speed limit for some classes of vehicles.[204] The Intercity Express or ICE train network serves major German cities as well as destinations in neighbouring countries with speeds up to 300 km/h (190 mph).[205] The largest German airports are Frankfurt Airport, Munich Airport and Berlin Brandenburg Airport.[206] The Port of Hamburg is the third-busiest port in Europe and one of the twenty largest container ports in the world.[207] In 2019[update], Germany was the world's seventh-largest consumer of energy.[208] All nuclear power plants were phased out in 2023.[209] Germany meets its power demands using 40% renewable sources, and has been called an \"early leader\" in solar and offshore wind.[210][211] The country is committed to the Paris Agreement and several other treaties promoting biodiversity, low emission standards, and water management.[212][213][214] Germany's household recycling rate is among the highest in the world—at around 65%.[215] The country's greenhouse gas emissions per capita were the ninth-highest in the EU in 2018[update], but these numbers have been trending downward.[216][217] The German energy transition (Energiewende) is the recognised move to a sustainable economy by means of energy efficiency and renewable energy, with the country being called \"the world's first major renewable energy economy\".[218][219][211] Germany has reduced its primary energy consumption by 11% between 1990 and 2015[220] and set itself goals of reducing it by 30% by 2030 and by 50% by 2050.[221] Domestic and international travel and tourism combined directly contribute over €105.3 billion to German GDP. Including indirect and induced impacts, the industry supports 4.2 million jobs.[222] As of 2022, Germany is the eighth-most-visited country.[223] Its most popular landmarks include Cologne Cathedral, the Brandenburg Gate, the Reichstag, the Dresden Frauenkirche, Neuschwanstein Castle, Heidelberg Castle, the Wartburg, and Sanssouci Palace.[224] The Europa-Park near Freiburg is Europe's second-most popular theme park resort.[225] With a population of 84.7 million according to the 2023 German census,[226] Germany is the most populous country in the European Union, the second-most populous country in Europe after Russia,[4][g] and the nineteenth-most populous country in the world. Its population density stands at 227 inhabitants per square kilometre (590 inhabitants/sq mi). The fertility rate of 1.57 children born per woman (2022 estimates) is below the replacement rate of 2.1 and is one of the lowest fertility rates in the world.[4] Since the 1970s, Germany's death rate has exceeded its birth rate. However, Germany is witnessing increased birth rates and migration rates since the beginning of the 2010s. Germany has the third oldest population in the world, with an average age of 47.4 years.[4] Four sizeable groups of people are referred to as national minorities because their ancestors have lived in their respective regions for centuries:[228] There is a Danish minority in the northernmost state of Schleswig-Holstein;[228] the Sorbs, a Slavic population, are in the Lusatia region of Saxony and Brandenburg; the Roma and Sinti live throughout the country; and the Frisians are concentrated in Schleswig-Holstein's western coast and in the north-western part of Lower Saxony.[228] After the United States, Germany is the second-most popular immigration destination in the world.[229] In 2015, following the 2015 refugee crisis, the Population Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs listed Germany as host to the second-highest number of international migrants worldwide, about 5% or 12 million of all 244 million migrants.[230] Refugee crises have resulted in substantial population increases;[231] for example, the major influx of Ukrainian immigrants following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, meaning over 1.06 million refugees from Ukraine were recorded in Germany as of April 2023.[232] As of 2019[update], Germany ranks seventh among EU countries in terms of the percentage of migrants in the country's population, at 13.1%.[233] In 2022, there were 23.8 million people, 28.7 percent of the total population, who had a migration background.[234] Germany has a number of large cities. There are 11 officially recognised metropolitan regions. The country's largest city is Berlin, while its largest urban area is the Ruhr.[235] According to the 2022 census, Christianity is the largest religion at 49.7% of the population; 23.1% identified as Protestant and 25.1% as Catholic.[237] Islam is the second-largest religion in the country.[238] In the 2011 census, 1.9% of respondents (1.52 million people) gave their religion as Islam, but this figure is deemed unreliable because a disproportionate number of adherents of this faith (and other religions, such as Judaism) are likely to have made use of their right not to answer the question.[239] In 2019, there were an estimated 5.3–5.6 million Muslims with a migrant background[h] (6.4–6.7% of the population), in addition to an unknown number of Muslims without a migrant background.[240] Most of the Muslims are Sunnis and Alevis from Turkey, but there are a small number of Shi'ites, Ahmadiyyas and other denominations. Other religions each comprise less than one percent of Germany's population.[238] In 2011, formal members of the Jewish community represented no more than 0.2% of the total German population, and 60% of them resided in Berlin.[241] An estimated 80 to 90 percent of these Jews in Germany are Russian-speaking immigrants from the former Soviet Union, who came to Germany from the 1980s onwards.[242][243] A study in 2023 estimated that 46.2% of the population are not members of any religious organization or denomination.[244] Irreligion in Germany is strongest in the former East Germany, which used to be predominantly Protestant before the enforcement of state atheism, and in major metropolitan areas.[245][246] German is the official and predominantly spoken language in Germany.[247] It is one of 24 official and working languages of the European Union, and one of the three procedural languages of the European Commission, alongside English and French.[248] German is the most widely spoken first language in the European Union, with around 100 million native speakers.[249] Recognised native minority languages in Germany are Danish, Low German, Low Rhenish, Sorbian, Romani, North Frisian and Saterland Frisian; they are officially protected by the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. The most used immigrant languages are Turkish, Arabic, Kurdish, Polish, Italian, Greek, Spanish, Serbo-Croatian, Bulgarian and other Balkan languages, as well as Russian. Germans are typically multilingual: 67% of German citizens claim to be able to communicate in at least one foreign language and 27% in at least two.[247] Responsibility for educational supervision in Germany is primarily organised within the individual states. Optional kindergarten education is provided for all children between three and six years old, after which school attendance is compulsory for at least nine years depending on the state. Primary education usually lasts for four to six years.[250] Secondary schooling is divided into tracks based on whether students pursue academic or vocational education.[251] A system of apprenticeship called Duale Ausbildung leads to a skilled qualification which is almost comparable to an academic degree. It allows students in vocational training to learn in a company as well as in a state-run trade school.[250] This model is well regarded and reproduced all around the world.[252] Most of the German universities are public institutions, and students traditionally study without fee payment.[253] The general requirement for attending university is the Abitur. According to an OECD report in 2014, Germany is the world's third leading destination for international study.[254] The established universities in Germany include some of the oldest in the world, with Heidelberg University (established in 1386), Leipzig University (established in 1409) and the University of Rostock (established in 1419) being the oldest.[255] The Humboldt University of Berlin, founded in 1810 by the liberal educational reformer Wilhelm von Humboldt, became the academic model for many Western universities.[256][257] In the contemporary era Germany has developed eleven Universities of Excellence. Germany's system of hospitals, called Krankenhäuser, dates from medieval times, and today, Germany has the world's oldest universal health care system, dating from Bismarck's social legislation of the 1880s.[259] Since the 1880s, reforms and provisions have ensured a balanced health care system. The population is covered by a health insurance plan provided by statute, with criteria allowing some groups to opt for a private health insurance contract. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Germany's health care system was 77% government-funded and 23% privately funded as of 2013[update].[260] In 2014, Germany spent 11.3% of its GDP on health care.[261] Germany ranked 21st in the world in 2019 in life expectancy with 78.7 years for men and 84.8 years for women according to the WHO, and it had a very low infant mortality rate (4 per 1,000 live births). In 2019[update], the principal cause of death was cardiovascular disease, at 37%.[262] Obesity in Germany has been increasingly cited as a major health issue. A 2014 study showed that 52 percent of the adult German population was overweight or obese.[263] Culture in German states has been shaped by major intellectual and popular currents in Europe, both religious and secular, and its scientists, writers and philosophers have played a significant role in the development of Western thought.[264] Global opinion polls from the BBC revealed that Germany is recognised for having the most positive influence in the world in 2013 and 2014.[265][266] Germany is well known for such folk festivals as the Oktoberfest and Christmas customs, which include Advent wreaths, Christmas pageants, Christmas trees, Stollen cakes, and other practices.[267][268] As of 2024[update], UNESCO inscribed 54 properties in Germany on the World Heritage List.[269] There are a number of public holidays in Germany determined by each state; 3 October has been a national day of Germany since 1990, celebrated as the Tag der Deutschen Einheit (German Unity Day).[270] German classical music includes works by some of the world's most well-known composers. Dieterich Buxtehude, Johann Sebastian Bach and Georg Friedrich Händel were influential composers of the Baroque period. Ludwig van Beethoven was a crucial figure in the transition between the Classical and Romantic eras. Carl Maria von Weber, Felix Mendelssohn, Robert Schumann and Johannes Brahms were significant Romantic composers. Richard Wagner was known for his operas. Richard Strauss was a leading composer of the late Romantic and early modern eras. Karlheinz Stockhausen and Wolfgang Rihm are important composers of the 20th and early 21st centuries.[271] In 2013, Germany was the second-largest music market in Europe, and fourth-largest in the world.[272] German popular music of the 20th and 21st centuries includes the movements of Neue Deutsche Welle, pop, Ostrock, heavy metal/rock, punk, pop rock, indie, Volksmusik (folk music), schlager pop and German hip hop. German electronic music gained global influence, with Kraftwerk and Tangerine Dream pioneering in this genre.[273] DJs and artists of the techno and house music scenes of Germany have become well known (e.g. Paul van Dyk, Felix Jaehn, Paul Kalkbrenner, Robin Schulz and Scooter).[274] German painters have influenced Western art. Albrecht Dürer, Hans Holbein the Younger, Matthias Grünewald and Lucas Cranach the Elder were important German artists of the Renaissance, Johann Baptist Zimmermann of the Baroque, Caspar David Friedrich and Carl Spitzweg of Romanticism, Max Liebermann of Impressionism and Max Ernst of Surrealism. Several German art groups formed in the 20th century; Die Brücke (The Bridge) and Der Blaue Reiter (The Blue Rider) influenced the development of expressionism in Munich and Berlin. The New Objectivity arose in response to expressionism during the Weimar Republic. After World War II, broad trends in German art include neo-expressionism and the New Leipzig School.[275] German designers became early leaders of modern product design.[276] The Berlin Fashion Week and the fashion trade fair Bread & Butter are held twice a year.[277] Architectural contributions from Germany include the Carolingian and Ottonian styles, which were precursors of Romanesque. Brick Gothic is a distinctive medieval style that evolved in Germany. Also in Renaissance and Baroque art, regional and typically German elements evolved (e.g. Weser Renaissance).[275] Vernacular architecture in Germany is often identified by its timber framing (Fachwerk) traditions and varies across regions, and among carpentry styles.[278] When industrialisation spread across Europe, classicism and a distinctive style of historicism developed in Germany, sometimes referred to as Gründerzeit style. Expressionist architecture developed in the 1910s in Germany and influenced Art Deco and other modern styles. Germany was particularly important in the early modernist movement: it is the home of Werkbund initiated by Hermann Muthesius (New Objectivity), and of the Bauhaus movement founded by Walter Gropius.[275] Ludwig Mies van der Rohe became one of the world's most renowned architects in the second half of the 20th century; he conceived of the glass façade skyscraper.[279] Renowned contemporary architects and offices include Pritzker Prize winners Gottfried Böhm and Frei Otto.[280] German literature can be traced back to the Middle Ages and the works of writers such as Walther von der Vogelweide and Wolfram von Eschenbach. Well-known German authors include Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Friedrich Schiller, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing and Theodor Fontane. The collections of folk tales published by the Brothers Grimm popularised German folklore on an international level.[281] The Grimms also gathered and codified regional variants of the German language, grounding their work in historical principles; their Deutsches Wörterbuch, or German Dictionary, sometimes called the Grimm dictionary, was begun in 1838 and the first volumes published in 1854.[282] Influential authors of the 20th century include Gerhart Hauptmann, Thomas Mann, Hermann Hesse, Heinrich Böll, and Günter Grass.[283] The German book market is the third-largest in the world, after the United States and China.[284] The Frankfurt Book Fair is the most important in the world for international deals and trading, with a tradition spanning over 500 years.[285] The Leipzig Book Fair also retains a major position in Europe.[286] German philosophy is historically significant: Gottfried Leibniz's contributions to rationalism; the enlightenment philosophy by Immanuel Kant; the establishment of classical German idealism by Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling; Arthur Schopenhauer's composition of metaphysical pessimism; the formulation of communist theory by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels; Friedrich Nietzsche's development of perspectivism; Gottlob Frege's contributions to the dawn of analytic philosophy; Martin Heidegger's works on Being; Oswald Spengler's historical philosophy; and the development of the Frankfurt School have all been very influential.[287] The largest internationally operating media companies in Germany are Bertelsmann, Axel Springer SE and ProSiebenSat.1 Media. Germany's television market is the largest in Europe, with over 38 million TV households as of 2012.[288] Around 90% of German households have cable or satellite TV, with a variety of free-to-view public and commercial channels.[289] There are more than 300 public and private radio stations in Germany; Germany's national radio network is the Deutschlandradio and the public Deutsche Welle is the main German radio and television broadcaster in foreign languages.[289] Germany's print market of newspapers and magazines is the largest in Europe.[289] The papers with the highest circulation are Bild, Süddeutsche Zeitung, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung and Die Welt.[289] The largest magazines include ADAC Motorwelt and Der Spiegel.[289] Germany has a large video gaming market, with over 34 million players nationwide.[290] The Gamescom is the world's largest gaming convention.[291] German cinema has made major technical and artistic contributions to film. The first works of the Skladanowsky Brothers were shown to an audience in 1895. The renowned Babelsberg Studio in Potsdam was established in 1912, thus being the first large-scale film studio in the world. Early German cinema was particularly influential with German expressionists such as Robert Wiene and Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau. Director Fritz Lang's Metropolis (1927) is referred to as the first major science-fiction film. After 1945, many of the films of the immediate post-war period can be characterised as Trümmerfilm (rubble film). East German film was dominated by the state-owned film studio DEFA, while the dominant genre in West Germany was the Heimatfilm (\"homeland film\").[292] During the 1970s and 1980s, New German Cinema directors such as Volker Schlöndorff, Werner Herzog, Wim Wenders, and Rainer Werner Fassbinder brought West German auteur cinema to critical acclaim. The Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film (\"Oscar\") went to the German production The Tin Drum (Die Blechtrommel) in 1979, to Nowhere in Africa (Nirgendwo in Afrika) in 2002, and to The Lives of Others (Das Leben der Anderen) in 2007. Various Germans won an Oscar for their performances in other films. The annual European Film Awards ceremony is held every other year in Berlin, home of the European Film Academy. The Berlin International Film Festival, known as \"Berlinale\", awarding the \"Golden Bear\" and held annually since 1951, is one of the world's leading film festivals. The \"Lolas\" are annually awarded in Berlin, at the German Film Awards.[293] German cuisine varies from region to region and often neighbouring regions share some culinary similarities, including with the southern regions of Bavaria and Swabia, Switzerland, and Austria. International varieties such as pizza, sushi, Chinese food, Greek food, Indian cuisine, and doner kebab are popular. Bread is a significant part of German cuisine and German bakeries produce about 600 main types of bread and 1,200 types of pastries and rolls (Brötchen).[294] German cheeses account for about 22% of all cheese produced in Europe.[295] In 2012 over 99% of all meat produced in Germany was either pork, chicken or beef. Germans produce their ubiquitous sausages in almost 1,500 varieties, including Bratwursts and Weisswursts.[296] The national alcoholic drink is beer.[297] German beer consumption per person stands at 110 litres (24 imp gal; 29 US gal) in 2013 and remains among the highest in the world.[298] German beer purity regulations date back to the 16th century.[299] Wine has become popular in many parts of the country, especially close to German wine regions.[300] In 2019, Germany was the ninth-largest wine producer in the world.[301] The 2018 Michelin Guide awarded eleven restaurants in Germany three stars, giving the country a cumulative total of 300 stars.[302] Football is the most popular sport in Germany. With more than 7 million official members, the German Football Association (Deutscher Fußball-Bund) is the largest single-sport organisation worldwide,[303] and the German top league, the Bundesliga, attracts the second-highest average attendance of all professional sports leagues in the world.[304] The German men's national football team won the FIFA World Cup in 1954, 1974, 1990, and 2014,[305] the UEFA European Championship in 1972, 1980 and 1996,[306] and the FIFA Confederations Cup in 2017.[307] Germany is one of the leading motor sports countries in the world. Constructors like BMW and Mercedes are prominent manufacturers in motor sport. Porsche has won the 24 Hours of Le Mans race 19 times, and Audi 13 times (as of April 2024[update]).[308] The driver Michael Schumacher has set many motor sport records during his career, having won seven Formula One World Drivers' Championships.[309] Sebastian Vettel is also among the most successful Formula One drivers of all time.[310] German athletes historically have been successful contenders in the Olympic Games, ranking third in an all-time Olympic Games medal count when combining East and West German medals prior to German reunification.[311] In 1936 Berlin hosted the Summer Games and the Winter Games in Garmisch-Partenkirchen. Munich hosted the Summer Games of 1972.[312][313] Sources 51°N 9°E﻿ / ﻿51°N 9°E﻿ / 51; 9",

The country's full name is sometimes shortened to the FRG (or the BRD, in German). To the north of Germany are the North and Baltic Seas, and the kingdom of Denmark. To the east of Germany are the countries of Poland and the Czech Republic. To the south of Germany are the countries of Austria and Switzerland. To the west of Germany are the countries of France, Luxembourg, Belgium, and the Netherlands. The total area of Germany is 357,021 square kilometres (137,847 square miles). Most of Germany has warm summers and cold winters. In March 2021, Germany had a population of 83.1 million people, the second-largest in Europe after Russia.[10] After the United States, Germany is the second most popular country for migration in the world.[11] Before it was called Germany, it was called Germania. In the years A.D. 900 – 1806, Germany was part of the Holy Roman Empire. From 1949 to 1990, Germany was made up of two countries called the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) and the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). During this time, the capital city of Berlin was divided into a west and an east part. On 13 August 1961, East Germany started building the Berlin Wall between the two parts of Berlin. West Germany was one of the countries that started the European Union.[12] Germany gained importance as the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation, which was the first Reich (this word means empire). It was started by Charlemagne who became the first Holy Roman Emperor in 800 AD, and it lasted until 1806, the time of the Napoleonic Wars.[13] After, German nation-states were made sovereign in Central Europe. During the mid-1800s, Prussia was led by Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, who is sometimes known as the \"Father of Germany\". He led a process to bring the German people together under one country. In 1866, Prussia won a war against Austria and their allies. During this time, Prussia founded the North German Confederation. The treaty of unification of Germany was made in Versailles after Germany won the Franco-Prussian War in 1871.[14] This began the Second Reich. The biggest state in the new German Empire was Prussia. The rulers were called Kaisers or \"German Emperors\", but they did not call themselves \"Emperors of Germany\". There were many smaller states in the Empire, but not Austria. Germany stayed an empire for 50 years. It joined the other European empires in the Scramble for Africa and fought wars to make large parts of Africa and Oceania its colonies.[15] It killed many Nama and Herero people who did not want to be ruled by Germany.[15][16] Today, those colonies have become seven states: Togo, Cameroon, Namibia, Rwanda, Burundi, Tanzania, and Papua New Guinea.[15] Germany was in World War I with their ally Austria-Hungary, and again declared war on France.[14] The war became slow in the west and became trench warfare. Many men were killed on both sides without winning or losing. In the Eastern Front the soldiers fought with the Russian Empire and won there after the Russians gave up. The war ended in 1918 because the Germans could not win in the west and gave up. Germany's emperor also had to give up his power, and most of Germany's African colonies were taken by other European empires.[14][17] France took Alsace from Germany and Poland got the Danzig corridor. After a revolution, the Second Reich ended, and the democratic Weimar Republic began. After the war, there were a lot of problems with money in Germany because of the Peace Treaty of Versailles, which made Germany pay for the costs of World War I and the worldwide Great Depression.[18] The Third Reich was Nazi Germany; it lasted 12 years, from 1933 to 1945.[19] It started after Adolf Hitler became the head of government. On 23 March 1933, the Reichstag (parliament) passed the Enabling Act, which let Hitler's government command the country without help from the Reichstag and the presidency. This gave him total control of the country and the government.[20] Hitler, in effect, became a dictator. Hitler wanted to unify all Germans in one state and did this by taking over places where Germans lived, such as Austria and Czechoslovakia; Hitler also wanted the land in Poland that Germany had owned before 1918, but Poland refused to give it to him. He then invaded Poland. This started World War II on 1 September 1939. In the beginning of the war, Germany was winning and even successfully invaded France. It managed to take over much of Europe. However, Germany attacked the Soviet Union in 1941 and after the Battle of Kursk, the German Eastern Front began a slow retreat until war's end. On 8 May 1945, Germany gave up after Berlin was captured, Hitler had killed himself a week earlier. Because of the war, Germany lost a lot of German land east of the Oder-Neiße line, and for 45 years, Germany was split into West Germany and East Germany. Other events happened during the war in Nazi Germany, including the Holocaust, the mass genocide of Jews and other peoples, for which some Nazis were punished in the Nuremberg Trials. After World War II Germany was occupied by the allies and in 1949 it was divided into 2 states: West Germany and East Germany, who were stuck in the Cold War. The capital city of Berlin was divided between the two by the Berlin Wall. In 1989 there was a process of reforms in East Germany, which lead to the opening of the Berlin Wall and to the end of socialist rule in Germany. These events are known as the Wende or the Friedliche Revolution (Peaceful Revolution) in Germany. After that, East Germany joined West Germany in 1990.[21] The new Germany is a part of the European Union.[22] Germany is a constitutional federal democracy.[23] Its political rules come from the 'constitution' called Basic Law (Grundgesetz), written by West Germany in 1949. It has a parliamentary system, and the parliament elects the head of government, the Federal Chancellor (Bundeskanzler). The current Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, is a man who used to live in West Germany. The people of Germany vote for the parliament, called the Bundestag (Federal Assembly), every four years.[24] Government members of the 16 States of Germany (Bundesländer) work in the Bundesrat (Federal Council). The Bundesrat can help make some laws.[25] The head of state is the Bundespräsident (Federal President). This person has no real powers but can order elections for the Bundestag. The current president is Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD). The judiciary branch (the part of German politics that deals with courts) has a Bundesverfassungsgericht (Federal Constitutional Court). It can stop any act by the law-makers or other leaders if they feel they go against Germany's constitution. The opposition parties are the CDU, CSU, Die Linke and the AfD. Germany is one of the largest countries in Europe. It stretches from the North Sea and Baltic Sea in the north to the high mountains of the Alps in the south. The highest point is the Zugspitze on the Austrian border, at 2,962 metres (9,718 ft).[25] Germany's northern part is very low and flat (lowest point: Neuendorf-Sachsenbande at −3.54 m or −11.6 ft). In the middle, there are low mountain ranges covered in large forests. Between these and the Alps, there is another plain created by glaciers during the ice ages. Germany also contains parts of Europe's longest rivers, such as the Rhine (which makes up a part of Germany's western border, while Oder River is on its eastern border), the Danube and the Elbe.[25] In Germany there are sixteen states (Bundesländer): In these states there are 301 Kreise (districts) and 114 independent cities, which do not belong to any district. Germany has a mostly continental climate, but the northern German coast has an oceanic climate. The highest temperature ever recorded in Germany was 41.2 °C (106.2 °F), on 25 July 2019 in Duisburg and Tönisvorst.[27] The lowest temperature ever recorded in Germany was −45.9 °C (−50.6 °F), on 24 December 2001 in Funtensee.[28] Germany has one of the world's largest technologically powerful economies. Bringing West and East Germany together and making their economy work is still taking a long time and costing a lot of money.[29] Germany is the largest economy in Europe and the fourth-largest in the world by nominal gross domestic product (GDP).[30] In September 2011, the inflation rate in Germany was 2.5%. The unemployment rate of Germany was 5.5% as of October 2011.[31] Germany is one of the G8 countries. The main industry area is the Ruhr area.[32] The country has companies like BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, Porsche, Siemens, Bosch, SAP, BASF and more. Germany's most exported products are cars.[33] Nearly all German companies are small- or medium-sized.[30] Most of the people in Germany are ethnically Germans, but the country also has many ethnic minorities. There are at least seven million people from other countries living in Germany. Some have political asylum, and some are guest workers (Gastarbeiter). Many people from poor or dangerous countries go to Germany for safety. Many others move to Germany without permission. About 50,000 ethnic Danish people live in Schleswig-Holstein, in the north. About 60,000 Sorbs (a Slavic people) live in Germany too, in Saxony and Brandenburg. About 12,000 people in Germany speak Frisian; this language is the closest language to English that is still spoken today. In northern Germany, people outside towns speak Low Saxon. Most of the people who have come to Germany are from Turkey. Germany has about 1.9 million Turkish immigrants and they own many businesses there. Turkish people introduced the Doner kebab and became a popular fast food in Germany. Other small groups of people in Germany are Croats (0.2 million), Italians (0.6 million), Greeks (0.4 million), Russians, and Poles (0.3 million). There are also some ethnic Germans who lived in the old Soviet Union (1.7 million), Poland (0.7 million), and Romania (0.3 million). These people have German passports, so they are not counted as foreigners. A lot of these people do not speak German at home.[25] Christianity is the biggest religion; Protestants are 38% of the people (mostly in the north) and Catholics are 34% of the people (mostly in the south).[25] There are also many Muslims, while the other people (26.3%) are either not religious, or belong to smaller religious groups.[25] In the eastern regions, the former territory of the GDR (known as the DDR in German), only one fifth of the population is religious. Germany has one of the world's highest levels of schooling, technology, and businesses. The number of young people who attend universities is now three times more than it was after the end of World War II, and the trade and technical schools of Germany are some of the best in the world. German income is, on average, $25,000 a year, making Germany a highly middle class society. A large social welfare system gives people money when they are ill, unemployed, or similarly disadvantaged. Millions of Germans travel outside of their country each year. The four recognized minorities in Germany are Danes 50,000 (concentrated in Schleswig-Holstein state), Frisians 60,000-70,000 (based in Eastern and Northern Frisia), Sorbs 60,000 (primarily in Saxony and Brandenburg) and Romani and Sinti.[34] Germany is a very densely populated country, and especially in cities the housing situation is difficult and rents are high. Already in 2014 there were 39,000 homeless people in Germany and 339,000 people without an apartment.[35] Here is a link to a German video report[36] from a German news magazine. The video is about refugees, who have been living in a sports gym in Berlin for over a year with no privacy. In the video people discuss amongst others why there are problems to find living space in containers. The containers are similar to those in Zaatari refugee camp. Germany's constitution says that all people can believe in any religion they want to, and that no one is allowed to discriminate against somebody because of the person's religion. In ancient times, Germany was largely pagan. Roman Catholicism was the biggest religion in Germany up to the 15th century, but a major religious change called the Reformation changed this. In 1517, Martin Luther said that the Catholic Church used religion to make money. Luther started Protestantism, which is as big as the Catholic religion in Germany today. Before World War II, about two-thirds of the German people were Protestant and one-thirds were Roman Catholic. In the north and northeast of Germany, there were a lot more Protestants than Catholics. Today, about two-thirds of German people (more than 55 million people) call themselves Christian, but most of them do not practice it. About half of them are Protestants and about half are Roman Catholics.[37] Most German Protestants are members of the Evangelical Church in Germany. The previous Pope, Benedict XVI, was born in Germany. Before World War II, about one percent of the country's people were German Jews. Today, Germany has the fastest-growing group of Jewish people in the world. Many of them are in Berlin. Ten thousand Jews have moved to Germany since the fall of the Berlin Wall; many came from countries that were in the Soviet Union. Schools teaching about the things that happened when the Nazis were in power, as well as teaching against the ideas of the Nazis, has helped to make Germany very tolerant towards other people and cultures, and now many people move there from countries that may not be so tolerant. About three million Muslims live in Germany, 3.7% of the total population.[37][38] The country also has a large atheist and agnostic population, and there are also large about 0.6 million Hinduism follower and some small group of Jain, Buddhist and Zoroastrian communities. The 20th century has also seen a neopagan revival. Germany has a long history of poets, thinkers, and artists. There are 240 supported theaters, hundreds of orchestras, thousands of museums and over 25,000 libraries in Germany. Millions of tourists visit these attractions every year. Some of the greatest classical musicians including Johann Sebastian Bach, Ludwig van Beethoven and possibly Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart were German. Some of the most revered scientists today like Albert Einstein are German. Artists like Marc Engelhard are active in the 21st century.[39][40][41] Germany has created a high level of gender equality, disability rights, and accepts homosexuality. Gay marriage has been legal in Germany since 2017. Doner kebab is often considered a popular German-Turkish fast food. But more traditional foods of German cuisine are sausage based such as Bratwurst and Currywurst. German food varies from region to region. For example, in the southern regions, such as Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg, they share their type of food with Switzerland and Austria. Everywhere in Germany, meat is eaten as a sausage. Even though wine use is increasing, the national alcoholic drink is beer. The number of Germans who drink beer is one of the highest in the world. German restaurants are often rated the second-best, with France rated first place. Football (soccer) is the most popular sport in Germany. The national team has won the FIFA World Cup 4 times, and appears in the finals a lot. The top football league in Germany is Bundesliga. Also, the German Football Association (Deutscher Fußball-Bund) is the largest in the world. A lot of big football teams are from Germany, like FC Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund, RB Leipzig and many others. Some of the world's best footballers come from Germany too. These would include Mesut Özil, Manuel Neuer, Serdar Tasci, Michael Ballack, Bastian Schweinsteiger, Franz Beckenbauer, and so on. Plus, many tournaments have taken place in Germany. The most recent was the 2006 FIFA World Cup, and the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup. The Audi Cup takes place in Germany every year in Munich. Germany is also known for its motor sports. Successful German racing drivers include Michael Schumacher and Sebastian Vettel. Successful tennis players have also come from Germany, including Steffi Graf and Boris Becker. More recently, Sabine Lisicki reached the Women's Singles final at Wimbledon in 2013. Lastly, Germany is one of the best countries in the Olympic Games. Germany is the third in the list of the most Olympic Games medals in history (mixed with West and East Germany medals). The country finished first place in the 2006 Winter Olympics, second place in the 2010 Winter Olympics. Germany also got fifth place in the 2008 Summer Olympics.
