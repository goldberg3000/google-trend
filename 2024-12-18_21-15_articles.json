                "content": "Adam McCalvy Addressing his crowded outfield on Tuesday, Cubs president of baseball operations Jed Hoyer told reporters that, “We’re not done yet.” And he wasn’t kidding. Hours after Hoyer uttered those words about last week’s addition of three-time All-Star Kyle Tucker, Chicago traded one of its surplus outfielders, former National League MVP Cody Bellinger, to the Yankees along with cash for right-hander Cody Poteet. It was one of two trades on Tuesday for the Cubs, who also shipped catcher Matt Thaiss to the White Sox for cash. Chicago had just acquired Thaiss from the Angels in November for cash, but he was forced down the depth chart when the Cubs signed catcher Carson Kelly to a two-year deal. TRADE DETAILSCubs receive: RHP Cody PoteetYankees receive: OF/1B Cody Bellinger, $5 million TRADE DETAILSCubs receive: CashWhite Sox receive: C Matt Thaiss Besides adding pitching depth in Poteet, a 30-year-old who has a 3.80 ERA in 83 Major League innings for the Marlins and Yankees since 2021, the Cubs cleared some excess from their depth chart by moving Bellinger, who’d long been rumored to be available in a trade. The Cubs already had Ian Happ in left field, Pete Crow-Armstrong in center and Bellinger and Seiya Suzuki in right before Tucker arrived last week. The designated hitter provides some flexibility, but only to a point. So Bellinger was moved to New York with two years and $52.5 million left on his three-year contract with the Cubs, which has opt outs following each season. Bellinger already exercised his $27.5 million player option in November to stick with the Cubs, and has another player option for 2026 at $25 million with a $5 million buyout. According to MLB Network insider Jon Heyman, the Blue Jays also showed interest in trading for Bellinger, helping the Cubs move him while reportedly paying down only $5 million of what he’s still owed. Bellinger, 29, revived his career with the Cubs in 2023, when he hit .307/.356/.525 with 26 home runs, 97 RBIs and 20 stolen bases. He re-signed with Chicago but didn’t deliver the same kind of season in ‘24, when his OPS slipped to .751, down 130 points from the year before. The Cubs, meanwhile, went 83-79 under new manager Craig Counsell. So Hoyer went into the offseason seeking star power and found it in a trade for Tucker -- who is coming off four straight seasons north of four wins above replacement with the Astros -- even if that deal left Chicago with too many outfielders. “There's a finite number of ways that we can really improve as a team, especially on a position player side,” Hoyer said of adding Tucker. “Because in order to get a player that's better than our internal replacement level, you have to go fairly high. We have a lot of good players. We're very balanced, and so there's just not that many players out there that were available that we felt like, ‘OK, this player clearly makes us a better team. He provides something we don't have.’ And obviously, Tucker provides that.” Poteet, Miami’s fourth-round pick in 2015, has experience both as a starter and a reliever in the Majors, but he’s been mostly a starting pitcher in the Minors, compiling a 3.76 ERA over parts of nine seasons with a modest 7.4 strikeouts per nine innings. He was sidelined for much of last season by a triceps injury and went 3-0 with a 3.40 ERA in 13 starts between Double-A and Triple-A in the Minors, and 3-0 with a 2.22 ERA in five games (four starts) in the Majors for New York.",

                "content": "NEW YORK — The New York Yankees agreed to acquire outfielder Cody Bellinger from the Chicago Cubs on Tuesday for right-hander Cody Poteet, a person familiar with the negotiations told The Associated Press. The person spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because the trade had not been announced. Chicago will send the Yankees $5 million as part of the trade, the person said. The 29-year-old Bellinger, whose father Clay helped the Yankees win World Series titles in 1999 and 2000, is owed $27.5 million in 2025 under the first of two player options as part of an $80 million, three-year contract. The two-time All-Star also has a $25 million player option for 2026 with a $5 million buyout that would be payable in equal installments on Jan. 15, 2026, and Jan. 15, 2027. Bellinger batted .266 with 18 homers and 78 RBIs in 130 games this year. He was on the injured list from April 24 to May 7 with a broken right rib. He drove in 33 runs in his last 39 games of the season, but Chicago finished with an 83-79 record. Bellinger, who plays first base and center field, made his major league debut in 2017 and spent his first six seasons with the Los Angeles Dodgers. He was the NL MVP in 2019, batting .305 with 47 homers and 115 RBIs in 156 games. He also helped LA win the World Series in 2020. He was cut by the Dodgers in November 2022 and signed a $17.5 million, one-year deal with Chicago a month later. He regained his form with the Cubs, hitting a career-best .307 with 26 homers, 97 RBIs and 20 steals in 130 games last season year. Bellinger is a .259 hitter with 196 homers and 597 RBIs in 1,005 games. He turns 30 in July. Poteet, 30, made his major league debut with Miami in 2021, had Tommy John surgery on Aug. 17, 2022, returned to the mound with Kansas City's Triple-A Omaha farm team on Sept. 23, 2023, was released by the Royals and signed with the Yankees last January. He went 3-0 with a 2.22 ERA in four starts and one relief appearance during a season in which he was sidelined between June 12 and Sept. 25 by a strained right triceps.

                "content": "Forgot your password? By Matthew Trueblood In a move necessary because of the Cubs' acquisition of Kyle Tucker from the Houston Astros, the team has dealt outfielder/first baseman Cody Bellinger to the New York Yankees. In order to add Kyle Tucker's projected arbitration salary (in excess of $15 million) and maintain the payroll flexibility they need to further supplement the roster thereafter, the Cubs needed to offload the hefty contract of Cody Bellinger. After acquiring Tucker Friday afternoon, the team sent Bellinger and cash to the New York Yankees, in exchange for right-handed swingman Cody Poteet. Poteet, 30, is an interesting pickup. He has four years of remaining team control and can still be optioned to the minors, which is welcome flexibility. He has five pitches, though his soft stuff—sweeper, curveball, changeup—is a little better than his four-seamer or sinker. He only throws about 93 miles per hour, and the slot and the movement are fairly vanilla. He doesn't strike out a lot of hitters. He's a fairly fungible arm, but a clearly usable one, and he can cover multiple innings—even as a three- or four-inning long man or spot starter. Poteet would probably be a more known quantity, if not for a string of brutal injuries. The second half of his 2021 season was pulverized by a knee issue. He underwent Tommy John surgery in mid-2022 and missed all of 2023, and in 2024, he spent about half the season on the shelf with a triceps strain. That's why the Cubs (like most teams would) now view him mostly as a reliever, rather than because he's unable to start from a skills perspective. It's also why he was available in this deal. He has real upside; he's just not reliably available. Sending out Bellinger is as much about accommodating the personnel as about money, but without question, it's about both. The team is very unlikely to spend up to the competitive balance tax threshold, according to multiple sources, which means that clearing a hefty chunk of the $30 million they owed Bellinger for 2025 was important if they were to make a big splash elsewhere on the roster. This move ensures that they'll have that flexibility. The team can now turn its attention back to free-agent targets like Kirby Yates and Kyle Finnegan, but they might not be done making significant trades, either. On Friday, the Cubs and Yankees were talking about starting pitching prospect Will Warren as compensation for Bellinger, but as the sides haggled, the Cubs became increasingly resistant to sending the amount of money the Yankees demanded to consummate that version of the deal. In the end, they'll send just $5 million to New York. Getting Poteet while clearing so much money from their books lets the Cubs pivot more flexibly toward their next set of acquisitions, including (but not limited to) another starting pitcher. Losing Bellinger's high-contact, occasionally powerful bat from the lineup will lightly sting, but the team was left-handed enough as it was, especially after bringing in Tucker—who is a marked upgrade from Bellinger. The real risk embraced in this trade is tied to Pete Crow-Armstrong, who is now operating without a net as he enters his first full, unfettered season as the team's center fielder. Non-tendering Mike Tauchman and trading Bellinger are clear messages about the faith the Cubs have in their young defensive whiz and his offensive upside, but right now, they also leave the team staring at a choice between Kevin Alcántara and Alexander Canario as the backup center fielders. In all likelihood, the team will try to land one more accomplished center fielder (albeit on the cheap), so they have some measure of insurance against regression or injury for Crow-Armstrong. Bellinger and the Cubs were largely good for each other; the rest of the club's roster-building just wasn't good enough to fully capitalize on what he brought to the table. He also struggled to stay healthy, twice running into outfield walls and ending up injured in the process of making good catches. He probably didn't belong in center field anymore, anyway, so when he opted back in after the season, this immediately popped onto the team's radar. Getting Poteet and significant salary relief for Bellinger is another win, especially because the Cubs have clearer utility for him than they had for Wesneski. It's a smaller, secondary trade in the shadow of a true blockbuster, but this one, too, has a chance to make the Cubs substantially better, by giving them more spending power this winter and bringing in a controllable arm who could become a fixture.

                "content": "1970 due to renovations to Wrigley Field: 2002 due to renovations to Soldier Field: The Chicago Bears are a professional American football team based in Chicago. The Bears compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the National Football Conference (NFC) North division. The Bears have won nine NFL Championships, eight prior to the AFL–NFL merger and one Super Bowl. They also hold the NFL records for the most enshrinees in the Pro Football Hall of Fame and the most retired jersey numbers. The Bears' NFL championships and overall victories are second behind the Green Bay Packers,[11][12][13] with whom they have a long-standing rivalry.[14] The franchise was founded in Decatur, Illinois, on September 20, 1919,[15][16][17] became professional on September 17, 1920, and moved to Chicago in 1921.[18][19] It is one of two remaining franchises from the NFL founding in 1920, along with the Arizona Cardinals, which began in Chicago. The team played home games at Wrigley Field on Chicago's North Side through the 1970 season; playing since then at Soldier Field on the Near South Side, adjacent to Lake Michigan. The team headquarters, Halas Hall, is in the Chicago suburb of Lake Forest, Illinois. The Bears practice at adjoining facilities there during the season, and began hosting training camp at Halas Hall in 2020 after major renovations. In March of 1920 a man telephoned me ... George Chamberlain and he was general superintendent of the A.E. Staley Company ... In 1919, [the company's Fellowship Club] had formed a football team. It had done well against other local teams but Mr. Staley wanted to build it into a team that could compete successfully with the best semi-professional and industrial teams in the country ... Mr. Chamberlain asked if I would like to come to Decatur and work for the Staley Company. Originally named the Decatur Staleys, the club was established by the A. E. Staley food starch company of Decatur, Illinois as a company team. This was the typical start for several early professional football franchises. The team played independently in 1919, winning the Central Illinois Championship.[20] The company hired George Halas and Edward \"Dutch\" Sternaman in 1920 to run the team. The 1920 Decatur Staleys season[21] was their inaugural regular season completed in the newly formed American Professional Football Association (later renamed the National Football League (NFL) in 1922). Full control of the team was turned over to Halas and Sternaman in 1921.[22] Official team and league records cite Halas as the founder as he took over the team in 1920 when it became a charter member of the NFL.[23] The team moved to Chicago in 1921, where the club was renamed the Chicago Staleys; Under an agreement reached by Halas and Sternaman with Staley, they received US$5,000 to keep the name \"Staleys\" for the 1921 season.[24] In 1922, Halas changed the team name from the Staleys to the Bears.[25] The team moved into Wrigley Field, home of the Chicago Cubs baseball franchise. As with several early NFL franchises, the Bears derived their nickname from their city's baseball team (bears' young are called \"cubs\").[26] Halas liked the bright orange-and-blue colors of his alma mater, the University of Illinois, and the Bears adopted those colors as their own, albeit in a darker shade of each (the blue is Pantone 5395, navy blue, and the orange is Pantone 1665, similar to burnt orange).[27][28] The Staleys/Bears dominated the league in the early years. Their rivalry with the Chicago Cardinals, the oldest in the NFL (and a crosstown rival from 1920 to 1959), was key in four out of the first six league titles. During the league's first six years, the Bears lost twice to the Canton Bulldogs (who took two league titles over that span), and split with their crosstown rival Cardinals (going 4–4–2 against each other over that span), but no other team in the league defeated the Bears more than a single time. During that span, the Bears posted 34 shutouts. The Bears' rivalry with the Green Bay Packers is one of the oldest and most storied in American professional sports, dating back to 1921 (the Green Bay Packers were an independent team until they joined the NFL in 1921). In one infamous incident that year, Halas got the Packers expelled from the league in order to prevent their signing a particular player, and then graciously got them re-admitted after the Bears had closed the deal with that player.[29] The franchise was an early success under Halas, capturing the NFL Championship in 1921 and remaining competitive throughout the decade. In 1924 the Bears claimed the Championship after defeating the Cleveland Bulldogs on December 7, even putting the title \"World's Champions\" on their 1924 team photo. But the NFL had ruled that games after November 30 did not count towards league standings, and the Bears had to settle for second place behind Cleveland.[30] Their only losing season came in 1929. During the 1920s the club was responsible for triggering the NFL's long-standing rule that a player could not be signed until his college's senior class had graduated. The NFL took that action as a consequence of the Bears' aggressive signing of famous University of Illinois player Red Grange within a day of his final game as a collegian.[31] Despite much of the on-field success, the Bears were a team in trouble. They faced the problem of increased operating costs and flatlined attendance. The Bears would only draw roughly 5,000–6,000 fans a game, while a University of Chicago game would draw 40,000–50,000 fans a game. By adding top college football draw Red Grange to the roster, the Bears knew that they found something to draw more fans to their games. C.C. Pyle was able to secure a $2,000 per game contract for Grange, and in one of the first games, the Bears defeated the Green Bay Packers, 21–0. However, Grange remained on the sidelines while learning the team's plays from Bears quarterback Joey Sternaman. Later in 1925, The Bears would go on a barnstorming tour, showing off the best football player of the day. 75,000 people paid to see Grange lead the Bears to a 17–7 victory over the Los Angeles Tigers, who were a quickly put together team of West Coast college all-stars. After a loss to San Francisco, the Bears cruised to a 60–3 over a semi-pro team called the Portland All Stars.[32] Any hopes that Grange would lead the Bears to glory in 1926 were quickly dashed. A failed contract talk led to Grange bolting to the AFL's New York Yankees, owned by Pyle. The Bears also lost star quarterback Joey Sternaman, who joined the Chicago Bulls of the AFL. The Bears replaced Grange with Paddy Driscoll, a star football player in his own right. The Bears used the money made from the Grange barn-storming tour to sign the man that replaced him. Grange split his time between making movies and playing football. However, the time was not right to have two competing pro football leagues, and the AFL folded after only one season. Grange would return to the Bears.[32] After the financial losses of the 1932 Championship season, Halas' partner Dutch Sternaman left the organization. Halas maintained full control of the Bears until his death in 1983. He also coached the team off-and-on for forty seasons, an NFL record. In the 1932 \"Unofficial\" NFL Championship, the Bears defeated the Portsmouth Spartans in the first NFL playoff game.[33] Due to blizzard conditions in Chicago, the game was played at Chicago Stadium,[33][34] marking it as the first indoor American football game. The success of the playoff game led the NFL to institute a championship game. In the first NFL Championship, the Bears played against the New York Giants, defeating them 23–21. The teams met again in the 1934 NFL Championship where the Giants, wearing sneakers[35] defeated the Bears 30–13 on a cold, icy day at the Polo Grounds. From 1940 to 1947, quarterback Sid Luckman led the Bears to victories in four out of the five NFL Championship Games in which they appeared. The team acquired the University of Chicago's discarded nickname \"Monsters of the Midway\" and their famous helmet wishbone-C, as well as a newly penned theme song that declared them \"The Pride and Joy of Illinois\". One famous victory during that period was their 73–0 victory over the favored Washington Redskins at Griffith Stadium in the 1940 NFL Championship Game;[36] the score is still an NFL record for lopsided results.[37] The secret behind the one-sided outcome was the introduction of a new offensive formation by Halas. The T-formation, as Halas named it, involved two running backs instead of the traditional one in the backfield. Luckman established himself as one of the franchise's most elite quarterbacks. Between 1939 and 1950, he set the Bears' passing records for most career touchdowns, yards, and completions. Many of Luckman's records stood for decades before they were eclipsed by Jay Cutler in 2014.[38] Cutler then went on to break Luckman's franchise record for most career passing touchdowns a year later in 2015.[39] After declining throughout the 1950s, the team rebounded in 1963 to capture its eighth NFL Championship, which would be its last until 1985.[40] The late 1960s and early-1970s produced notable players like Dick Butkus, Gale Sayers, and Brian Piccolo,[41] who died of embryonal carcinoma in 1970. The American television network ABC aired a movie about Piccolo in 1971 entitled Brian's Song, starring James Caan and Billy Dee Williams in the roles of Piccolo and Sayers respectively; Jack Warden won an Emmy Award for his performance as Halas. The movie was later released for theater screenings after first being shown on television. Despite Hall of Fame careers, Butkus and Sayers would also have their careers cut short due to injuries, hamstringing the Bears of this era. Halas retired as coach in 1967 and spent the rest of his days in the front office.[42] He became the only person to be involved with the NFL throughout the first 60 years of its existence. He was also a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame's first induction class in 1963.[43] As the only living founder of the NFL at the February 1970 merger between the NFL and the American Football League, the owners honored Halas by electing him the first President of the National Football Conference, a position that he held until his death in 1983. In his honor, the NFL named the NFC Championship trophy as the George Halas Memorial Trophy.[44] After the merger, the Bears finished the 1970 season last place in their division, a repeat of their placing in the 1969 season.[45] In 1975, the Bears drafted Walter Payton from Jackson State University with their first pick.[46] He won the NFL Most Valuable Player Award in the 1977–78 season.[47][48] Payton would go on to eclipse Jim Brown's NFL career rushing record in 1984 before retiring in 1987, and would hold the mark until 2002, when Emmitt Smith of the Dallas Cowboys surpassed it.[49] Payton's career and personality would capture the hearts of Bear fans, who called him \"Sweetness\".[50] He died from a rare form of liver cancer in 1999 at the age of 45.[51] On November 1, 1983, a day after the death of George Halas, his oldest daughter, Virginia McCaskey, took over as the majority owner of the team.[52] Her husband, Ed McCaskey, succeeded her father as the chairman of the board.[53] Their son Michael became the third president in team history.[54] Mrs. McCaskey holds the honorary title of \"secretary of the board of directors\", but has been called the glue that holds the franchise together.[55] Mrs. McCaskey's reign as the owner of the Bears was not planned, as her father originally earmarked her brother, George \"Mugs\" Halas Jr. as the heir apparent to the franchise. However, he died of a severe heart attack in 1979.[56] Her impact on the team is well-noted as her own family has dubbed her \"The First Lady of Sports\", and the Chicago Sun-Times has listed her as one of Chicago's most powerful women.[57] Mike Ditka, a tight end for the Bears from 1961 to 1966, was hired to coach the team by George Halas in 1982.[58] His gritty personality earned him the nickname \"Iron Mike\".[59] The team reached the NFC Championship game, losing to the San Francisco 49ers 23–0, in 1984.[60] In the 1985 season the fire in the Bears–Packers rivalry was re-lit when Ditka used 315-pound defensive tackle \"Refrigerator\" Perry as a running back in a touchdown play at Lambeau Field, against the Packers.[61] The Bears won their ninth NFL Championship, first since the AFL-NFL merger, in Super Bowl XX after the 1985 season in which they dominated the NFL with their then-revolutionary 46 defense and a cast of characters that recorded the novelty rap song \"The Super Bowl Shuffle\".[62][63] The season was notable in that the Bears had only one loss, the \"unlucky 13th\" game of the season, a Monday night affair in which they were defeated by the Miami Dolphins.[64] At the time, much was made of the fact that the 1972 Dolphins were the only franchise in history to have had an undefeated season and post-season. The Dolphins came close to setting up a rematch in the Super Bowl, but lost to the New England Patriots in the AFC title game. \"The Super Bowl Shuffle\" was videotaped the day after that Monday night loss in Miami.[65] After the 1985 championship season, the Bears remained competitive throughout the 1980s but failed to return to the Super Bowl under Ditka. Throughout the remainder of his tenure, Ditka led the Bears to five more postseason berths, getting as far as the NFC Championship in the 1988 season.[66] Between the firing of Ditka and the hiring of Lovie Smith, the Bears had two head coaches, Dave Wannstedt and Dick Jauron.[67][68][69] While both head coaches led the team to the playoffs once (Wannstedt in 1994 and Jauron in 2001), neither was able to accumulate a winning record or bring the Bears back to the Super Bowl. Therefore, the 1990s was largely considered to be a disappointment.[70] Before the Bears hired Jauron in January 1999, Dave McGinnis (Arizona's defensive coordinator, and a former Bears assistant under Ditka and Wannstedt) backed out of taking the head coaching position. The Bears scheduled a press conference to announce the hiring before McGinnis agreed to contract terms.[71] Soon after Jauron's hiring, Mrs. McCaskey fired her son Michael as president, replacing him with Ted Phillips and promoting Michael to chairman of the board.[55] Phillips became the first man outside of the Halas-McCaskey family to run the team.[72] From 1997 to 2000, the Bears suffered four consecutive last place finishes within the division.[73][74][75][76] In the 2001 season, Jim Miller took over as the primary starting quarterback and helped lead the Bears to a resurgent 13–3 record and division title.[77] The 2001 team did not see any postseason success as they fell 33–19 to the Philadelphia Eagles in the Divisional Round.[78] The 2002 season saw a setback as the team went 4–12.[79] The team improved to a 7–9 record in 2003 but still missed the postseason.[80] Jauron was fired following the end of the 2003 season.[81] Lovie Smith, hired on January 15, 2004, is the third post-Ditka head coach. Joining the Bears as a rookie head coach, Smith brought the highly successful Tampa 2 defensive scheme with him to Chicago. Before his second season with the Bears, the team rehired their former offensive coordinator and then Illinois head coach Ron Turner to improve the Bears' struggling offense.[82] In 2005, the Bears won their division and reached the playoffs for the first time in four years. Their previous playoff berth was earned by winning the NFC Central in 2001. The Bears improved upon their success the following season, by clinching their second consecutive NFC North title during Week 13 of the 2006 season, winning their first playoff game since 1995, and earning a trip to Super Bowl XLI.[83] However, they fell short of the championship, losing 29–17 to the Indianapolis Colts. Following the 2006 season, the club decided to give Smith a contract extension through 2011, at roughly $5 million per year. This comes a season after being the lowest-paid head coach in the National Football League.[84] The club has played in over a thousand games since becoming a charter member of the NFL in 1920. Through the 2010 season, they led the NFL in overall franchise wins with 704 and had an overall record of 704–512–42 (going 687–494–42 during the regular season and 17–18 in the playoffs).[85] On November 18, 2010, the Bears recorded franchise win number 700 in a win against the Miami Dolphins.[86] The Bears made one of the biggest trades in franchise history, acquiring Pro Bowl quarterback Jay Cutler from the Denver Broncos in exchange for Kyle Orton and draft picks on April 2, 2009.[87] After a disappointing 2009 campaign with the team going 7–9,[88] Mike Martz was hired as the team's offensive coordinator on February 1, 2010.[89] On March 5, 2010, the Bears signed defensive end Julius Peppers, running back Chester Taylor, and tight end Brandon Manumaleuna, spending over $100 million on the first day of free agency.[90] Also during the 2010 offseason, Michael McCaskey was replaced by brother George McCaskey as chairman of the Bears.[91] With a 38–34 win against the New York Jets, the Bears clinched the No. 2 seed and a first-round bye for the 2010–11 NFL playoffs. In their first Playoff game since Super Bowl XLI, The Bears defeated the No. 4 seed Seattle Seahawks 35–24 in the Divisional Round. The Bears reached the NFC Championship Game, where they played Green Bay Packers at Soldier Field – only the second playoff meeting between the two storied rivals, the only other game played in 1941.[92] The Bears lost the game, 21–14.[93] The team started the 2011 season strong with a 7–3 record,[94] and running back Matt Forté led the NFL in total yards from scrimmage. Eventually, quarterback Jay Cutler fractured his thumb, and Forté also was lost for the season against the Kansas City Chiefs after spraining his MCL, and the Bears, with Caleb Hanie playing, lost five straight before winning against the Minnesota Vikings with Josh McCown starting over Hanie. At season's end, general manager Jerry Angelo was fired, and former Chiefs director of scouting and former Bears scout Phil Emery was brought in.[95][96] Offensive coordinator Mike Martz resigned, and eventually retired, and was replaced by offensive line coach Mike Tice.[97][98] The Bears made another notable move by trading for Miami Dolphins receiver and Pro Bowl MVP Brandon Marshall.[99] The Bears became the first team in NFL history to return six interceptions for touchdowns in the first seven games of the season, with another pick-six by Brian Urlacher in Week 9 bringing Chicago two behind the record set by the 1961 San Diego Chargers.[100] However, the Bears missed the playoffs with a record of 10–6 (after starting the season 7–1, the first team to start with the record and miss the playoffs since the 1996 Washington Redskins),[101] and Smith was fired on December 31.[102] Then-CFL head coach and former NFL journeyman Marc Trestman was hired to succeed Smith after an exhaustive search that included at least 13 known candidates.[103][104] On March 20, 2013, Brian Urlacher's 13-year tenure with the Bears ended when both sides failed to agree on a contract.[105] The Trestman era began on September 8 with a 24–21 win over the Cincinnati Bengals, making Trestman the fourth head coach in Bears history to win in his coaching debut, after George Halas (1920), Neill Armstrong (1978) and Dick Jauron (1999).[106] The Bears ended the 2013 season 8–8, barely missing the playoffs after losing in the final week of the season to the Packers.[107] Despite having a second-ranked offense that set numerous franchise records,[108] the defense greatly worsened as it set franchise worsts in categories like yards allowed (6,313).[109] The following season was a disaster for the Bears, with the offense regressing to finish outside the top 20 in scoring.[110] The team also allowed 50-point games in two straight weeks against the Patriots and Packers, including a franchise-high 42 points and NFL-record six touchdowns allowed in the first half against the latter,[111][112] to become the first team since the 1923 Rochester Jeffersons to allow at least 50 points in consecutive games.[113] The Bears ended the year 5–11 and last in the NFC North.[114] Trestman and Emery were fired after the season ended.[115] The Bears hired Ryan Pace of the New Orleans Saints to be their new general manager on January 8, 2015.[116] On January 16, 2015, John Fox accepted a four-year deal to become head coach.[117] In Fox's first season as head coach, the Bears saw improvements from 2014; after USA Today projected the Bears to win three games,[118] they doubled that total and finished the season with a 6–10 record, including a Thanksgiving win over the Packers at Lambeau Field.[119] However, during the 2016 season, the Bears regressed heavily, compiling a 3–13 record (their worst since the NFL's change to 16-game seasons in 1978). The season included several injuries to starters and secondary players, including Jay Cutler, who only played five games as a result of two separate injuries.[120] Backup quarterback Brian Hoyer started the next three games before a broken arm put him out for the season. He was replaced by Matt Barkley, who made his first career start with the Bears.[121][122] None of the three quarterbacks returned for the 2017 season.[123][124][125] In the 2017 NFL draft, the team selected quarterback Mitchell Trubisky with the second-overall pick,[126] who sat behind newly signed quarterback Mike Glennon for the first four games before taking over.[127] The Bears ended the season 5–11 and again finished last in the NFC North.[128] On January 1, 2018, Fox was fired, ending his tenure in Chicago with a 14–34 record.[129] The Bears hired Matt Nagy from the Kansas City Chiefs as their new head coach in January 2018.[130] General manager Ryan Pace signed receivers Taylor Gabriel, Allen Robinson, and Trey Burton in the offseason to complement second-year quarterback Mitchell Trubisky.[131] The Bears also acquired linebacker Khalil Mack in a block-blockbuster trade from the Oakland Raiders to further bolster their defense, sending a package of draft picks that includes 2019 and 2020 1st round draft picks in exchange.[132] Nagy's Bears clinched the NFC North on December 16, 2018, for the first time since 2010 with a 24–17 victory over the Green Bay Packers.[133] The Bears finished the 2018 season with a 12–4 record.[134] They lost to the defending Super Bowl Champions Philadelphia Eagles in the wild-card round of the playoffs after Cody Parkey's game-winning field goal attempt was partially tipped and hit the uprights in the final seconds of the game, a play coined the \"Double Doink\".[135][136] Despite the first-round exit, Nagy was named Coach of the Year by the Pro Football Writers Association and Associated Press.[137][138] He was the first Bears coach to be given the AP award since Lovie Smith in 2005 and the fifth in team history.[139] In 2019, the team regressed to an 8–8 record, though Nagy's combined 20 wins in 2018 and 2019 were the most by a Bears head coach in his first two seasons.[140] During the year, renovations to Halas Hall were completed, allowing the team to move Training Camp from Ward Field on the campus of Olivet Nazarene University in Bourbonnais, Illinois to Lake Forest for 2020.[141][142] The Bears opened the 2020 season with a 5–1 record. However, they lost their next six games. The Bears won three of their last four games to finish the season with an 8–8 record. Despite their finish, the Bears qualified for the 2020–21 NFL playoffs, which was expanded to include one additional wildcard team from each conference.[143] The New Orleans Saints defeated the Bears in the opening round of the playoffs, 21–9.[144] The team did not re-sign Trubisky after the 2020 season and instead allowed him to become a free agent.[145] Prior to the 2021 season, the Bears traded up in the 2021 NFL draft to select quarterback Justin Fields 11th overall.[146] The team also signed veteran quarterback Andy Dalton in free agency.[147] Dalton was initially declared the Bears starting quarterback, but Fields won the position after Dalton was injured.[148] The Bears finished the season with a 6–11 record and missed the playoffs.[149] Nagy and general manager Ryan Pace were fired after the season's conclusion.[149] Nagy posted a 34–33 record over four seasons with two playoff berths, while Pace compiled a 48–65 record over seven seasons.[149] On January 25, 2022, the Bears hired Ryan Poles as their general manager.[8] The team hired Matt Eberflus as the franchise's 17th head coach two days later.[150] The Bears struggled throughout the 2022 season, which included a franchise-record 10-game losing streak.[151] They finished with an NFL worst 3–14 record, which secured the team the first overall pick in the 2023 NFL draft.[151] The Bears traded the first overall pick to the Carolina Panthers in exchange for wide receiver D. J. Moore and multiple draft picks.[152] The Bears opened the 2023 season with a 0–4 record, extending the team losing streak to 14 (longest in team history; dating back to the 2022 season).[153] The team bounced back by winning five of their last eight games, but finished with a 7–10 record, placing last in the NFC North for the second consecutive season. However, the team acquired the first overall pick in the 2024 NFL draft, which was part of their previous trade with the Panthers, who finished the 2023 season with worst record in the NFL.[154] The first overall pick was used on USC quarterback Caleb Williams.[155] The Bears fired Eberflus on November 29, with five games remaining in the 2024 NFL season.[156] Eberflus, who a posted a 14–32 overall record with the Bears, was the first head coach in team history to be fired before the end of the season.[157] The team is primarily owned by the heirs of George Halas. His daughter, Virginia Halas McCaskey (holds 22.6% of the team shares), is the principal owner and votes on behalf of her 11 children and two nephews (who each own 3.8%) as well as the Brizzolara family (who own 8.33%), which amounts to an 80.33% ownership stake, allowing her to control the team.[158] Former chairman and CEO of Aon Corp. Pat Ryan (17.67%)[159] and former Aon director Andrew J. McKenna's estate (2%) own the remainder 19.67% of the club.[55] Ryan is also a board member.[7] The McCaskey family has right of first refusal on stock sale, while Ryan's block has second refusal rights.[159] In 2020, Forbes magazine reported that the franchise is worth $3.525 billion, making it the seventh richest franchise in the NFL.[160] Chicago is the third largest media market in the United States.[161] In a Crain's Chicago Business article, one businessman described his wishes for the team to maximize its potential. In 2009, Yahoo! Sports listed the McCaskeys as the third worst owner in the NFL, stating \"[T]hey get less for what they've got than any team in our league.\"[162] The club was founded by A. E. Staley Manufacturing Company owner Augustus Eugene Staley in 1919 and was owned by the company until 1921. In 1921, Staley felt he could no longer afford the expensive burden of pro-football and transferred team ownership to Halas and paid him $5,000 for a sponsorship deal that kept the Staleys name for one more year.[163] Halas than added Edward \"Dutch\" Sternaman as a second owner. On January 28, 1922, the Bears were incorporated at an NFL meeting, as \"a new league team\" after its name change.[164][165] At season's end, the two competed with agent Bill Harley for ownership of the Staleys, after he negotiated a contract that was to give his brother Chic Harley and himself one-third ownership of the team as part of his contract. However, Halas and Sternaman claimed that the contract was voided when a physical revealed health impairments resultant from Harley's time in the war. The other league owners agreed to nullify the deal in favor of the Halas/Sternaman partnership by an 8–2 vote.[165] In addition, Halas and Sternaman offered a share of the team to Paddy Driscoll, but the move was blocked by the owners in the NFL's June meeting, after the Chicago Cardinals (Driscoll's team) activated the league's reserve clause.[165] In 1931, Sternaman offered to sell his stake to Halas for $38,000 to focus on his other businesses. Halas’ purchase agreement with Sternaman was to be paid off in installments, and stipulated that if Halas defaulted on any of the payments, ownership of the team reverted to Sternaman. Halas raised the initial funding by selling an 8.33% ownership stake to Ralph Brizzolara,[166] as well as $5,000 of shares to Jim McMillen, and George Trafton's mother, who paid $20,000 (Halas later bought her out for $40,000).[167] Charles Bidwill purchased $5,000 in stock in 1933 (which was later bought off of his widow Violet for $50,000 in 1949[168]) and he also arranged a bank loan for the remaining $5,000 needed to pay off Sternaman: \"But it was a mighty close call. As I remember, I finally got all the money together at 11:10 a.m. on the day the final note came due. Forfeit time was 12 o’clock noon.\" Halas remained the club's president and principal owner until his death on October 31, 1983. Halas' children, George \"Mugs\" Halas Jr. and Virginia McCaskey acquired stock in the team through prior gifts and sales. After Mugs' death in 1979, Halas Sr. owned a 49.35% interest in the Bears, Mugs' estate owned a 19.67% interest, while Virginia McCaskey, Jim Finks (3.5%, which he later relinquished when he resigned as the team GM[169]), Charles Brizzolara, Robert and Carol Brizzolara in joint tenancy, and Nancy Lorenz owned the remaining outstanding shares. In 1981, the shareholders merged the Bears with a newly formed Delaware-incorporated organization, the Chicago Bears Football Club, Inc..[170] In 1987, Mugs' estate executor wanted to sell his ownership stake and challenged the legality of a 1981 corporate reorganization and the other owners' right of first refusal,[171] while his heirs, Christine and Stephen Halas, wanted to keep their father's stake, asking a Cook County Probate Court judge not to allow the sale.[172] Ultimately they failed to block the Chicago Bears from buying their father's 19.67% ownership stake of the team, which sold for $17.5 million in 1988.[173] Bears then-president Michael McCaskey called the purchase a \"terrific financial burden\", and the team would later sell the stake to Chicago-area businessmen Andrew McKenna and Patrick Ryan for a then-undisclosed sum[b] in 1990.[174] At the time it was also speculated that they invested to help the Bears lobby lawmakers for a domed stadium.[175] In 2017, the NFL approved a sale of shares from Mugs' children (unreported whom or how much) to the McCaskey family for an undisclosed sum.[176] The team has major sponsorship deals with Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Miller Brewing Company, PNC Financial Services, United Airlines, Verizon, Xfinity, and Proven IT.[177][178] The team was the first in the NFL to have a presenting sponsor, with the 2004 season advertised as \"Bears Football presented by BankOne\". Additionally, the Bears have an agreement with WFLD (the Fox owned-and-operated station in Chicago) to broadcast pre-season football games.[179] The club has had few official logos throughout their history. When the team was known as the Decatur Staleys in 1920, they used A. E. Staley's logo as football was intended to help promote the company.[180] The first Chicago Bears logo was introduced in 1940, depicting a black bear running with a football. The next logo, introduced in 1946, featured a navy blue bear on top of a football. In 1962, the Bears introduced their trademark \"wishbone-C\" logo for the first time.[181] Initially white with a black outline, the logo is similar to the \"C\" long worn on the Cincinnati Reds' baseball caps, and very closely resembles the University of Chicago Maroons' \"C\" logo introduced in 1898. The change in the Bears' logo was due to the addition of logos on helmets, which professional football teams began adding in the late 1950s and early 1960s. In 2023, the Bears made their primary logo the orange bear head, which was previously their secondary logo since 1999.[3] Despite demoting the \"C\" to a secondary logo, the team will still retain it on their helmets and at the home field's 50-yard line.[182] Before the 2003 season, the team had two unofficial mascots named \"Rocky\" and \"Bearman\". \"Rocky\" was a man who donned a #1 Bears jersey, carried a megaphone, and started chants all over Soldier Field during the 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s, in a fashion similar to Fireman Ed. The identity of \"Rocky\" is unknown, but he presumably lives in northwestern Indiana.[183] Don Wachter, also known as \"Bearman\", is a season ticket holder who decided in 1995 that he could also assist the team by cheerleading, similar to Rocky. The club allowed him to run across the field with a large Bears flag during player introductions and each team score (a role more recently done by the Bears 4th Phase and Bears captains). In 1996, he donned his \"costume\" of face paint, bear head and arms, and a number 46 jersey. \"Bearman\" was forced to stop wearing his costume with the introduction of Staley Da Bear in 2003, but in 2005 Wachter was allowed in costume again.[183] Staley Da Bear is an anthropomorphic bear with a customized No. 00 jersey, with blue and orange eyes, synonymous with the team's main colors.[184] His name is eponymous to starch processing company A. E. Staley, who founded the Bears' franchise. Like Rocky and Bearman, he entertains Bears fans, but like other NFL mascots, and mascots in general, Staley also visits charity events, parties,[185][186] Chicago Rush AFL games, and other Bears-related events, as well as taking part in games with his \"furballs\" against youth football teams at halftime.[187][188] The team had a cheerleading squad called the Chicago Honey Bears beginning in 1976. However, Bears owner Virginia Halas McCaskey terminated them after the 1985 season.[183] The squad's uniforms changed three times: from 1976 to 1979, the uniform was a white bodysuit with navy blue sleeves; from 1980 to 1984 it was a white bodysuit with orange sleeves and the navy was moved to the trim, and for the squad's final season in 1985, the uniform was redesigned with an orange sequin vest.[189] Since 1998, the Bears have partnered with 'A Safe Place,' a domestic violence shelter in Waukegan, Illinois.[190] In June 2017, existing and former Bears employees helped renovate the shelter by ripping up carpet, painting walls, demolishing a kitchen and building a fence.[190] The Bears have also provided financial support throughout the years. The Green Bay Packers are the Bears' biggest rivals since their team's inception in 1920. The Green Bay Packers currently have the lead at 103–95–6,[191] and the teams have met twice in the postseason. The Bears won the 1941 meeting, 33–14, and eventually defeated the New York Giants in the 1941 NFL Championship Game, and the Packers won the 2011 meeting, 21–14, en route to a Super Bowl XLV win over the Pittsburgh Steelers.[192] The teams' first meeting was a victory for the Bears (known as the Staleys at the time) in 1921 in a shutout, 20–0. The Packers claimed their first win over the Bears in 1925, 14–10. The 1924 matchup (which ended in a 3–0 win for Chicago) was notable for featuring the first-ever ejection of players in a game in NFL history, as Frank Hanny of the Bears and Walter Voss of the Packers were ejected for punching each other.[193] The rivalry also featured one of the last successful fair catch kicks in 1968, when Bears kicker Mac Percival kicked the game-winning field goal.[194] The Detroit Lions and Bears have faced off since the Lions' inception in 1930, when they were known as the Portsmouth Spartans, with the Spartans winning, 7–6, and Chicago winning the second meeting, 14–6. Since then, the Bears have led the series, 99–74–5.[195] The rivalry grew in 1932, when the Bears and Spartans met in the first-ever postseason game in NFL history, with the Bears winning the game 9–0. The game also was known as the first pro \"indoor football\" game, as the game took place in indoor Chicago Stadium due to a blizzard at the time. The game also started the forward pass.[196] Chicago and Minnesota took each other on in the Vikings' inaugural game, with the Vikings defeating the Bears in a 37–13 rout, and Minnesota currently holds the series lead 60–54–2.[197] The oldest continuing matchup in the NFL belongs to the Bears and the Arizona Cardinals.[198] It began as intense intra-city rivalry between the Bears and the Chicago Cardinals, which the Bears were leading 47–19–6 through 1959, when the Cardinals moved to St. Louis. The rivalry's importance waned further after the Cardinals moved to the Phoenix metropolitan area in 1988. The Bears lead the all-time series 59–28–6.[199] The teams have yet to meet in the playoffs.[200][201][202][203] The Bears and the New York Giants squared off in six NFL championship games, more than any common match-up in either the NFL championship game or Super Bowl. The Bears won four of the six championship games, which included the Sneakers Game that the Giants won in the 1934 NFL Championship Game. The two teams also met in the 1985 and 1990 playoffs, splitting each meeting en route to a Super Bowl championship (Bears in Super Bowl XX, Giants in Super Bowl XXV). As of the 2023 season, the Bears lead the all-time series 36–25–2.[204][205] The Bears and San Francisco 49ers were regular foes while both played in the Western Conference. The rilvary grow during the 1980s, as both teams were constant playoff contenders in the NFC. The 49ers currently holds the series lead 35-33-1 and 3–0 in the playoffs.[206][207] Under the current NFL scheduling formula, the Bears and 49ers play at least once every four years.[208] The Bears holds historic rivalry with its former NFC Central foe Tampa Bay Buccaneers. as of the 2023 season, Chicago currently holds the series lead 40–22.[209][210] Under the current NFL scheduling formula, the Bears and Bucs play at least once every four years.[208] Although the teams never played in the same division, the Bears and the Washington Commanders have a historically significant rivalry, dating back to 1932, when the Commanders were located in Boston and were known as the Braves. The rivalry started to heat up in 1937, when Washington drafted quarterback Sammy Baugh and both teams were often met in the NFL Championship Game.[211] The most memorable game from that era was in 1940, when the Bears set a record by defeating the Commanders 73-0 in the NFL Championship game, to this day, the largest margin of victory in league history.[212][36] The series regained steam in the 1980s, when both teams were fighting for the NFC supremacy.[213] Washington holds a slight edge in the all-time series 27-25-1 (2–1 in the playoffs and 2–2 in championship games).[214] Under the current NFL scheduling formula, the Bears and Commanders play at least once every four years.[208] The Cleveland/Los Angeles/St. Louis Rams and the Bears played in the same division the 1937 NFL season to the 1969 NFL season (with the 1958 game attracting 100,470 fans, the largest in Bears history[215]), while the two franchises continue to play annually until the 1980 NFL season.[216] From 1995 to 2015 the two teams were part of the Chicago-St. Louis rivalries in the major professional leagues.[217] As of the 2023 season, Chicago currently holds the series lead 54–39–3 (1–1 in the playoffs). It is the Rams' longest-running, non-division series.[218] Under the current NFL scheduling formula, the Bears and Rams play at least once every four years.[208] The AFC member Miami Dolphins and the Bears met less than 15 times but most of them were memorable.[219] The most notable was the 1985 shootout at Monday Night, as Miami handing Chicago their first, and only, regular-season loss for the year, while keeping the 1972 Dolphins as the only perfect team in NFL history.[220] As of the 2023 season, Miami currently holds the series lead 10–4.[221] Under the current NFL scheduling formula, the teams play at least once every four years.[208] Chicago had a fierce instate rivalry with the Rock Island Independents in the league first decade, with the Bears winning the series 8–1–4.[222][223] The Canton/Cleveland Bulldogs and the Staleys/Bears rivalry was between the two NFL's powerhouses in the 1920s, with games usually attracting the most fans,[224] and the outcome often decided the fate of NFL Championship (1921–1924).[225] The rivalry grow after the 1921 season, when the Staleys star Guy Chamberlin joined the Bulldogs and led them to three consecutive championships, including a tiebreaker win over the Bears in 1924.[165][226][227] Chicago won the series 4–3.[228][229] Soldier Field, located on Lake Shore Drive in Chicago, is the home of the Bears. The Bears moved to Soldier Field in 1971 after outgrowing Wrigley Field, the team's home for 50 years.[230] After the AFL-NFL Merger, the league preferred their teams to play in stadiums that could hold at least 50,000 fans. Even with portable bleachers that the team set up at Wrigley, the stadium could still only hold 46,000.[231] At first, the Bears were supposed to play at Dyche Stadium (later called Ryan Field), but Northwestern University's residential neighbors objected, and the agreement was cancelled. The original home of the Bears was Staley Field at Decatur, Illinois, when the team was known as the Decatur Staleys, before they moved to Chicago in 1921. Soldier Field's playing surface was changed from natural grass to astroturf before the 1971 season, and then back to natural grass in time for the start of the 1988 season. Throughout its history, Soldier Field's field maintenance has been done by the Chicago Park District (the municipal entity from which the Bears lease the field) by disparate district employees, rather than a permanent team-employed grounds crew, generating some controversy among players for its rough surface.[232] This arrangement caused disagreements with the city throughout the years, with the Bears attempting to agree on a new stadium since 1986.[233] The stadium was the site of the infamous Fog Bowl playoff game between the Bears and Philadelphia Eagles.[234] In 2002, the stadium was closed and rebuilt with only the exterior wall being preserved. It was closed on Sunday, January 20, 2002, the day after the Bears lost in the playoffs. It reopened on September 27, 2003, after a complete rebuild (the second in the stadium's history).[231] Many fans refer to the rebuilt stadium as \"New Soldier Field\".[235] During the 2002 season, the Bears played their home games at the University of Illinois' Memorial Stadium in Champaign, where they went 3–5. Multiple critics have negative views of the new stadium, believing that its structure has made it more of an eyesore than a landmark; some have dubbed it the \"Mistake on the Lake\".[236] Soldier Field was stripped of its National Historic Landmark designation on February 17, 2006.[237] In the 2005 season, the Bears won the NFC North Division and the No. 2 Seed in the NFC Playoffs, entitling them to play at least one home game in the postseason. The team hosted (and lost) their divisional round match on January 15, 2006, against the Carolina Panthers. This was the first playoff game at Soldier Field since the stadium reopened. The stadium's end zones and midfield were unpainted until the 1982 season. The design sported on the field included the bolded word \"Chicago\" rendered in Highway Gothic in both end zones. In 1983, the end zone design returned, with the addition of a large wishbone \"C\" Bears logo painted at midfield. These field markings remained unchanged until the 1996 season. In 1996 the midfield wishbone \"C\" was changed to a large blue Bears head, and the end zone design were painted with \"Bears\" in cursive. This design remained until the 1999 season, when the artwork was returned to the classic \"Chicago\" and \"C\". In the new Soldier Field, the artwork was tweaked with the word \"Chicago\" bolded in one end zone and the other having \"Bears\".[238] In June 2021, the Bears submitted a bid to purchase the Arlington International Racecourse in Arlington Heights, Illinois from Churchill Downs.[239] Despite negotiations between the city of Chicago to upgrade Soldier Field again, the Bears entered into an agreement with Churchill Downs to purchase the Arlington International Racecourse in September 2021 for $197.2 million. The sale of the property which includes 326 acres of space for potential development closed on February 15, 2023.[240][241] As of 2024, the Bears have shifted their focus to the parking area south of Soldier Field on Museum Campus.[242][243] On April 24, 2024, the Bears revealed plans for a $4.7 billion domed lakefront stadium development.[244][245] From its inception until 1930 the Staleys/Bears conducted their summer training camp in their home stadiums: Staley Field (Decatur, Illinois) and later Cubs' Park (Chicago).[246] In 1930 they first moved to Mills Stadium in Chicago and from 1931 to 1934 to Loyola University Chicago, Logan Square Baseball Park, Notre Dame University and Lane Tech College Prep High School, respectively.[247] In 1935 they began to conduct training camps at a prominent location, when they started practicing at St. John's Northwestern Military Academy (Delafield, Wisconsin) for a decade.[141] In 1944 they moved to St. Joseph's College in Rensselaer, Indiana and stayed there for 30 years. This location was the place of the famous automobile accident on July 27, 1964 that killed Bears players Willie Galimore and Bo Farrington, after Galimore's Volkswagen left the road on a curve and rolled, a few miles from the team's training camp.[248][249][250] From 1975 to 1984 they conducted their summer training camp in Lake Forest College, at the original Halas Hall (the practice and front office facility for the Bears from 1977 until 1997).[251] The practice field was later renamed Farwell Field and serves as the main field for Foresters football and soccer. From 1984 to 2001, the Bears held pre-season training camp in Ralph E. Davis Pioneer Stadium at University of Wisconsin–Platteville. They were considered a member of the \"Cheese League\" that in 1999 consisted of the Green Bay Packers, New Orleans Saints and Kansas City Chiefs, with each team practicing at a different university in Wisconsin.[252] In 2001, the Illinois General Assembly asked the Bears to move to an Illinois practice facility in order to raise funds for remodeling Soldier Field. Before the Bears left, they donated $250,000 to UW–Platteville for a new computer lab, which was named \"The Bears Den\".[253] On June 16, 2014, the stadium was damaged by a tornado and the Bears donated $50,000 to the school relief fund.[254] From 2002 to 2019, the Bears held their summer training camp at Olivet Nazarene University in Bourbonnais. Although the Bears had an agreement to continue practicing there through 2022,[255] they moved the camp permanently into the recently renovated Halas Hall in 2020.[142] The team headquarters, Halas Hall, named after founder George Halas, is in the Chicago suburb of Lake Forest, Illinois. The Bears practice at adjoining facilities during the season. The location is 4 miles (6.4 km) west of the original Halas Hall which had opened in 1977, and it was named after George Halas Jr., who died unexpectedly in 1979. It was located at Lake Forest College and contained 2 practice fields (one regulation-size outdoor field as well as a 70-yard practice field) and front office facilities,[256] which is used by the Foresters Athletics Department.[257] The 38-acre complex opened on March 3, 1997, and was expanded in 2013 and 2018.[258][259] The team also has a 11,000 square feet (1,000 m2) corporate office in downtown Chicago, located at 123 N. Wacker Dr,[260] for sales, corporate partnerships and events departments employees.[261] While the Super Bowl XX champion Bears were a fixture of mainstream American pop culture in the 1980s, the Bears made a prior mark with the 1971 American TV movie Brian's Song starring Billy Dee Williams as Gale Sayers and James Caan as Brian Piccolo.[262][263] The film told of how Piccolo helped Sayers recover from a devastating knee injury to return to his status as one of the league's best players, and how Sayers in turn helped the Piccolo family through Brian's fatal illness.[264][265] A 2001 remake of the movie for ABC starred Sean Maher as Piccolo and Mekhi Phifer as Sayers.[266] The 1985 team is also remembered for recording the song \"The Super Bowl Shuffle\", which reached number forty-one on the Billboard Hot 100 and was nominated for a Grammy Award.[267] The music video for the song depicts the team rapping that they are \"not here to start no trouble\" but instead \"just here to do the Super Bowl Shuffle\". The team took a risk by recording and releasing the song before the playoffs had even begun, but were able to avoid embarrassment by going on to win Super Bowl XX by a then-record margin of 46–10. That game was one of the most-watched television events in history according to the Nielsen ratings system; the game had a rating of 48.3, ranking it seventh in all-time television history.[268] In addition to the \"Super Bowl Shuffle\"[269] rap song, the Bears' success in the 1980s – and especially the personality of head coach Mike Ditka – inspired a recurring sketch on the American sketch comedy program Saturday Night Live, called \"Bill Swerski's Superfans\". The sketch featured Cheers co-star George Wendt, a Chicago native, as host of a radio talk-show (similar in tone to WGN radio's \"The Sportswriters\"), with co-panelists Carl Wollarski (Robert Smigel), Pat Arnold (Mike Myers) and Todd O'Connor (Chris Farley). To hear them tell it, \"Da Bears\" and Coach Ditka could do no wrong. The sketch stopped after Ditka was fired in 1993. The sketch usually showed the panelists chugging beer and eating lots of Polish sausage, and often featured Todd getting so agitated about what was happening with the Bears that he suffered a heart attack, but quickly recovered (through self-administered CPR). The sketch also features the cast predicting unrealistic blowout victories for Bears games.[270] Da Super Fan sketch has not been brought back by SNL, with the exception of a single appearance by Horatio Sanz as a Super Fan for the Cubs on \"Weekend Update\" in 2003. Outside of SNL, George Wendt reprised his role of Swerski in the opening promo of Super Bowl XL on ABC. On TV shows based in Chicago such as The Bob Newhart Show, Married... with Children, Family Matters, Still Standing, According to Jim, Early Edition and The Bernie Mac Show, the main characters are all Bears fans, and have worn Bears' jerseys and T-shirts on some occasions. Some episodes even show them watching Bears games. Roseanne is another TV show based in Illinois (albeit not in Chicago itself) to feature the Bears as the consensus household favorite, as 'Dan Connor' John Goodman is seen wearing Bears hats in several episodes. That '70s Show featured several Bears references, as it was based in Wisconsin, home of the Packers. On one episode while the gang is at a Bears vs. Packers game, Eric comes to the seat in a Walter Payton jersey and is booed by the surrounding Packers fans. In an episode of the Disney Channel show Shake It Up, based in Chicago, recurring character Dina Garcia (Ainsley Bailey) sold scalped Chicago Bears tickets. More recently, Modern Family character Cameron Tucker has been shown as a Bears fan. In an episode of the Disney Channel show \"I Didn't Do It\", based in Chicago, Lindy Watson (Olivia Holt) and Logan Watson (Austin North) try to get a football signed by NFL Hall of Famer Dick Butkus after destroying their fathers Butkus signed ball, Alshon Jeffery also makes a cameo appearance as well.[271] Ditka's success and popularity in Chicago has led him to land analyst roles on various American football pregame shows. Ditka worked for both the NFL on NBC and CBS's The NFL Today, and he currently works on ESPN's Sunday NFL Countdown and provided Friday night analysis on the Bears on WBBM-TV's 2 on Football with former WBBM-TV sports director Mark Malone.[272] He is also the color analyst for all local broadcasts of Bears preseason games. Ditka also co-starred himself alongside actor Will Ferrell in the 2005 comedy film Kicking & Screaming.[273] Also, Ditka, Dick Butkus, Walter Payton, Jim McMahon, William \"Refrigerator\" Perry and Brian Urlacher are among Bears figures known for their appearances in TV commercials. Urlacher, whose jersey was among the league's best-selling in 2002, was featured on Nike commercials with former Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Vick.[274][275] In the 1961 Hanna-Barbera animated short \"Rah Rah Bear\", Yogi Bear helps the Bears beat the New York Giants.[276] The Bears were later depicted in an episode of the 1985 cartoon version of the NBC sitcom Punky Brewster, where the Bears are playing the Green Bay Packers.[277][278] Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) from the National Lampoon's Vacation series appears in some scenes wearing a navy blue with burnt orange scripting Chicago Bears ball cap. He wears the same Chicago Bears cap throughout all four Vacation movies.[279] Currently, WMVP (1000 AM) broadcast Bears games with Jeff Joniak doing the play-by-play, along with color commentator Tom Thayer, who played for the Bears from 1985 to 1992.[280][281][282] Over the years, many Bears play-by-play broadcasters have included play-by-play announcers Jack Brickhouse, Joe McConnell and Wayne Larrivee, and color commentators Hub Arkush, Dick Butkus, Jim Hart and Irv Kupcinet. Spanish radio station WLEY-FM aired the Bears games from 2012 to 2014. Since 2015, WRTO and WVIV-FM air Bears games in Spanish.[283] Preseason games air on WFLD (channel 32).[284] The announcers are Adam Amin (play-by-play), Jim Miller (color commentary) and Lou Canellis (sideline reporter). WFLD also carries the majority of the team's regular season games through the NFL on Fox. Any Bears home games against AFC teams are aired on the CBS O&O station, WBBM-TV, which was the Bears' unofficial \"home\" station from 1956 until Fox won the NFC rights in 1995. Sunday Night games are broadcast on WMAQ-TV, the NBC O&O station, with ESPN Monday Night Football games airing either on ESPN or WLS-TV, the ABC affiliate. Patrick Mannelly holds the record for the most seasons in a Bears uniform with 16.[285] On the other hand, Steve McMichael holds the record for most consecutive games played by a Bear with 191;[285] he accomplished the feat from 1981 to 1993. In second place is Payton, who played 186 games from 1975 to 1987 at running back, a position considered to be conducive to injury, only missing one game in a span of 13 seasons. Kicker Robbie Gould became the Bears' all-time scoring leader in Week 5 of 2015 season[286] overtaking placekicker Kevin Butler who previously held the club record[285] for scoring the most points in his ten-year Bear career. He scored 1,116 points as the Bears kicker from 1985 to 1995. He is followed by running back Walter Payton, with 750 points. Payton holds the team record for career rushing yards with 16,726.[285] That was an NFL record until Emmitt Smith of the Dallas Cowboys broke it in 2002. Former Bears running back Matt Forte, who started playing for the Bears in 2008, is the closest to Payton's record with 6,985 yards. Forte also holds the team's single season record for rookies in rushing attempts, rushing yards and receptions. Mark Bortz holds the record for most Bear playoff appearances, with 13 between 1983 and 1994, and is followed by Kevin Butler, Dennis Gentry, Dan Hampton, Jay Hilgenberg, Steve McMichael, Ron Rivera, Mike Singletary, and Keith Van Horne, who have each played in 12 playoff games. The 1940 Chicago Bears team holds the record for the biggest margin of victory in an NFL game, including both playoff and regular season games, with a 73–0 victory over the Washington Redskins in the 1940 NFL Championship Game.[212] The largest home victory for the Bears came in a 61–7 result against the Green Bay Packers in 1980. The largest defeat in club history was a 52–0 loss against the Baltimore Colts in 1964. The club recorded undefeated regular seasons in 1934 and 1942; unlike the 1972 Miami Dolphins, however, they did not win the championship game in either season. In 1934, the club completed a 13–0 record but were defeated by the New York Giants, and in 1942 the club completed an 11–0 record but were defeated by the Redskins. Had the Bears won either championship, the club would have completed a championship three-peat – a feat completed only by the Packers (twice), although no team has done it since the AFL-NFL merger.[287] Halas holds the team record for coaching the most seasons with 40 and for having the most career victories of 324. Halas' victories record stood until Don Shula surpassed Halas in 1993. Ditka is the closest Bears coach to Halas, with 112 career victories. No other Bears coach has recorded over 100 victories with the team.[285] During the 2006 season, return specialist Devin Hester set several kick return records. He currently holds the franchise record for most return yards with 2,261.[288] He had six touchdown returns, setting a record for most returns in a single season.[289] In 2007, he recorded another six touchdown season from returns. One of the most notable of these returns came on November 12, 2006, when he returned a missed field goal for a 108-yard touchdown.[290] The record tied former teammate Nathan Vasher's previous record, which was set almost a year earlier.[291] Hester set a Super Bowl record as the first player to return an opening kick of a Super Bowl for a touchdown.[292] On December 20, 2010, Hester set an NFL record for most touchdowns on a punt or kickoff return with his 14th career return coming against the Minnesota Vikings. In 2011, Hester broke the record for the most punt returns against the Carolina Panthers. In 2012, Charles Tillman set the record for most forced fumbles in a single game with four against the Tennessee Titans.[293] Against the Titans, Chicago became the first team in league history to score a touchdown pass, a touchdown run, an interception return for a touchdown, and a blocked kick/punt for a score in the same quarter.[294] Tillman and teammate Lance Briggs became the first pair in NFL history to return an interception for a touchdown in consecutive games against the Jacksonville Jaguars and Dallas Cowboys.[295] This is a partial list of the Bears' last five completed seasons. For the full season-by-season franchise results, see List of Chicago Bears seasons.[296] Note: The Finish, Wins, Losses, and Ties columns list regular season results and exclude any postseason play. As of January 8, 2023 Running backs (RB) Wide receivers (WR) Tight ends (TE) Defensive linemen (DL) Defensive backs (DB) Special teams Reserve 53 active, 9 reserve, 16 practice squad (+1 exempt) In the Pro Football Hall of Fame, the Bears have the most enshrined primary members with 32;[302] the club also has had eight Hall of Famers spend a minor portion of their career with the franchise.[303] Founder, owner, head coach, and player George Halas, halfback Bronko Nagurski, and Red Grange were a part of the original class of inductees in 1963. The franchise saw 14 individuals inducted into the Hall of Fame from 1963 to 1967. Offensive tackle Jim Covert and defensive end Ed Sprinkle are the most recent Chicago Bear inductees, both being inducted as seniors as part of the Pro Football Hall of Fame's centennial class of 2020.[304] In 2023 Chuck Howley, who only played minor portion of his career with the Bears, was elected as a Seniors candidate.[305] In addition, Ray Bray was enshrined in Helms Athletic Foundation Pro Football Hall of Fame, which was established in 1950 and preceded the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He's the only Bears member from the Helms Athletic Foundation hall to not be enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. The Chicagoland Sports Hall of Fame was founded in 1979 and honors sports greats associated with the Chicago metropolitan area.[306] As of 2023, there are 59 honorees enshrined in the hall with connection to the Bears.[307] The Bears have retired 14 uniform numbers, which is the most in the NFL, and ranks fourth behind the basketball Boston Celtics (23), baseball New York Yankees (21), and hockey Montreal Canadiens (15) for the most in major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada.[308] The Bears retired Mike Ditka's number 89 jersey on December 9, 2013.[309] It is the last number that the Bears retired.[310] In honor of the team's centennial anniversary, on May 20, 2019, the Chicago Bears unveiled the Top 100 players in franchise history, as voted on by Hall of Fame writers Don Pierson and Dan Pompei, two of the most famous journalists that have ever covered the club in their long history.[311] At the time of the publish, the list included 27 Pro Football Hall of Famers, while two more inductees would join in the 2020 Centennial class (Jim Covert and Ed Sprinkle). Among the 100 Greatest, four active players made the list, including safety Eddie Jackson (96), defensive lineman Akiem Hicks (75), offensive lineman Kyle Long (74) and Khalil Mack (60), who had only played only one season with the team at the time of the unveiling of the list. Long would retire the following year. On a later date, Chicagobears.com released a list titled \"Top 10: Best of the rest\" that featured the \"top 10 snubs\" from the centennial list. The players include (in a following order): Alex Brown, Thomas Jones, Dave Whitsell, Curtis Conway, Tim Jennings, Leslie Frazier, Roberto Garza, Marty Booker, Nathan Vasher and William Perry.[312] Pompei would later say that the last two players who didn't make the list were Brown and Frazier.[313] 𝙝𝙤𝙛 Pro Football Hall of Fame inductee. 𝐟 Pro Football Hall of Fame finalist.

Larry Mayer of the Chicagobears.com would later state, that according to the voters \"if they had included a long-snapper on the team it would have been Patrick Mannelly\".[318] * As a Chicago Bear → Coaching staff → Front office → More NFL staffs The NFL, contrary to the four other major sports leagues in North America, don't have a formal farm system (beside the short lived Association of Professional Football Leagues), and over the years some teams had \"independent\" minor affiliates throughout their existence. The Bears, along with the New York Giants, were at the forefront of those endeavors when in 1939 Halas purchased the American Association's Newark Tornadoes and renamed them the \"Bears\".[319] Halas stocked the team with talent that did not make the Chicago roster, and used the club to incubate talent and for easy return for injured players, thus making it pro football's first true farm team.[320] Newark's most notable names included Joe Zeller as coach and Gene Ronzani (that year Chicago also assigned Sid Luckman to Newark playoff game, which the Bears won 13–6, to win the Southern Division title). This practice continued sporadically until 1972, and ended with the collapse of several minor leagues along with the NFL labor disputes in the 1970s.[321] Other notable players assigned includes: George Gulyanics, Ed Ecker, Lloyd Reese, Raymond Schumacher, Jack Karwales and Doug McEnulty. †= Never played in the league",

Damian Lillard also impressed with 23 points, four rebounds and four assists. The Thunder struggled mightily throughout the game. OKC finished the night shooting 5-of-32 (15.6%) from 3-point range, while leading scorer Shai Gilgeous-Alexander was held to 21 points (on 8-of-24 shooting) and two assists. If you missed the action, The Sporting News tracked score updates, highlights, news, and more from the 2024 NBA Cup championship. SN's NBA HQ: Live NBA scores | Updated NBA standings | Full NBA schedule (All times Eastern.) 10:56 p.m.: Under three minutes remain and Milwaukee leads 94-77. The Thunder are back in action in two days and they've pulled their starters, seemingly conceding this one to the Bucks. We're minutes away from the Bucks becoming the second-ever NBA Cup champions. 10:49 p.m.: It's really been the Bucks' night. Milwaukee leads by 16 with 5:01 remaining in regulation. The Bucks have had an answer for every Thunder attempt to make it interesting. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander has tried to make things happen but he's been limited to 21 points on 8-of-24 shooting and two assists. As a team, the Thunder are shooting 27-of-76 (35.5 percent) from the field and 4-of-29 (13.8 percent) from deep. Credit to Milwaukee, this is the best performance it has put forth all season. The Bucks are five minutes away from the grand prize. 10:42 p.m.: The Bucks lead by 19 but Bobby Portis is whistled for a Flagrant 1. The Thunder will get two free throws and possession of the ball with 8:23 remaining. If there were any time to make a run, it would be now. Bucks 88, Thunder 69 10:35 p.m.: It's looking spooky for the Thunder. Gary Trent Jr. and Brook Lopez each drain 3s to put Milwaukee up by 17 early on in the fourth. With Giannis Antetokounmpo on the bench, the Milwaukee lead is still growing. That's a bad sign for OKC. Timeout Thunder. 10:01 remains. Bucks 83, Thunder 66 10:30 p.m.: Make it a 26-14 advantage for Milwaukee in the third quarter. After leading by one at the half, the Bucks take a 13-point lead into the final frame.

Damian Lillard has also been great with 20 points, three rebounds and four assists. The Thunder have missed 21 of their 24 3-point attempts. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is up to 19 points but he's shooting 7-of-21 from the field. After their lowest-scoring quarter of the season, the Thunder will need a big fourth to make a run for the Cup. 10:27 p.m.: It's still all Bucks here late in the third. With Milwaukee up 10, Giannis Antetokounmpo gets an impressive block on Alex Caruso that ricochets off his face.

Bucks 77, Thunder 64 10:20 p.m.: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is finding his form at the right time for the Thunder. After entering the half with 10 points, Gilgeous-Alexander has scored nine points in the first eight minutes of the third. He's up to 19 points after a pair of free throws that trimmed the deficit to seven. Bucks 69, Thunder 62 10:13 p.m.: The Bucks are holding onto a double-digit lead as the game approaches the midway point of the third quarter. It's basically been all Milwaukee to start the second half. It has outscored Oklahoma City 16-7 in the third. Doc Rivers called a timeout to talk things over with 6:19 left in the third.

With the smaller Jalen Williams guarding him, Antetokounmpo brought his total to 16 points in the game. As the two-time MVP gave a menacing look to the cameras, OKC head coach Mark Daignealut called for a timeout. Bucks 59, Thunder 53 10:01 p.m.: The Bucks picked up where they left off with a pair of quick 3s to open the second half. OKC responded with a triple to cut the deficit to four points. On the ensuing possession, Giannis Antetokounmpo picked up his third foul of the game. That will be something to monitor. Bucks 57, Thunder 53 9:57 p.m.: Halftime stats: 9:45 p.m.: One half is in the books and Milwaukee takes a one-point lead into the locker room. Giannis Antetokounmpo has paced the Bucks with 14 points, six rebounds and five assists in the first half. He's also done it on efficient 6-of-9 shooting from the field. Isaiah Hartenstein also has 14 points to go along with seven rebounds in the first half, doing so on perfect 5-of-5 shooting from the field. The Thunder shot an abysmal 1-of-17 (5.9 percent) from 3-point range while the Bucks drained seven 3s at a 38.9 percent clip. In addition to the shooting difference, Milwaukee's defense limited Shai Gilgeous-Alexander to 10 points on 4-of-13 shooting. Both teams should like where they are: Milwaukee has clearly executed its game plan and its working but OKC should be confident that it will get more from Gilgeous-Alexander and all of its 3-point shooters. 9:36 p.m.: The first half is winding down but tensions are starting to rise. With the money on the line, there were some extracurriculars between Bucks guard Andre Jackson Jr. and Thunder center Isaiah Hartenstein. Cooler heads prevailed and the game is headed to a timeout with under two minutes left. Milwaukee leads by one. Bucks 47, Thunder 46 9:32 p.m.: Giannis Antetokounmpo is beginning to heat up. The Thunder's defense has been working on slowing Antetokounmpo down by committee but he's finding ways to make an impact. After scoring six points in the first quarter, he's quickly doubled that total during the last stretch of action. An alley-oop dunk gives Giannis 12 points on the night. UP TO GIANNIS 😲He's got 12.

After falling behind by five points, the Thunder are on a 9-2 run to retake a two-point lead. We're just five minutes into the quarter, meaning this trend will likely continue. Thunder 39, Bucks 37 9:08 p.m.: Alex Caruso sinks a triple at the buzzer but it appears he did not get it off on time. Officials will review but it looks like the Thunder will take a one-point lead into the second frame. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Isaiah Hartenstein lead all scorers with 10 points apiece. For the Bucks, Damian Lillard has a team-high seven points while Giannis Antetokounmpo has scored six. OKC shot 12-of-21 (57.1 percent) from the field but Milwaukee closed the gap by shooting 5-of-9 (55.6 percent) from 3-point range in the first frame. This has the makings of a game that will continue to go back and forth. 8:58 p.m.: Make it an 8-0 run for the Bucks, who take their first lead of the game courtesy of a Damian Lillard 3.

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. The Milwaukee Bucks won the 2024 NBA Cup on Tuesday, pulling away from the cold-shooting Oklahoma City Thunder for a 97-81 win in the tournament's title game in Las Vegas. The Bucks star duo of Giannis Antetokounmpo and Damian Lillard led the way, combining for 49 points as Milwaukee capped off a perfect 7-0 run in NBA Cup play. Antetokounmpo, who had a triple-double in the championship game (26 points, 19 rebounds, 10 assists), was named the tournament's MVP. Bucks players earned the trophy and a lucrative payday with the win. Milwaukee players will all receive a bonus prize of $514,971 for winning the title as the league upped the NBA Cup prize money in 2024. But it was the Thunder team the Bucks beat, and the way they beat them, that could end up meaning a lot more to their ultimate goal of competing for an actual championship in the coming months. Yes, the Thunder were without Chet Holmgren and that changes a lot at the rim, and no, the Thunder, even though they haven't been nearly as sharp from 3 as they were last season, are not going to miss 85% of their 3-pointers in many games (OKC went just 5 for 32 from 3-point range on Tuesday and made just one triple in the first half). None of that takes away from Milwaukee's performance, which, when we look back upon this season, could very well end up being the night the Bucks' season really kicked into high gear. You might argue that has already happened as the Bucks entered Tuesday night having won 12 of their last 15 games. But look at the opponents. Of the 12 wins, only three came against a team that was over .500 at the time, and two of those came with major caveats. A one-point squeaker over the Rockets came courtesy of a game-winning possession the Bucks never should've been gifted in the first place, which the NBA admitted to in its Last Two-Minute Report. The other good win on paper came a week ago against a Magic, who were without Paolo Banchero and Franz Wagner, which basically makes them a Big Ten offense. In the Cup semifinal, Milwaukee defeated a Hawks team that has been similarly hot, but that's not a measuring-stick opponent if we're being honest. Oklahoma City is, even without Holmgren on the floor, especially considering the Bucks were without Khris Middleton, who is going to have to factor heavily into their half-court formula if they're going to compete with the big boys come April and May. The Bucks won this game at the 3-point line, where, as mentioned, the Thunder were ice cold while Milwaukee made 17 of 40 attempts (42%). That's been the theme for a while now. Over these last 15 games, Milwaukee has made 41% of its 3-pointers, the second-best mark in the league. The Bucks have their flaws, but they have a lot of guys who can shoot it, too, and that cures a lot. Right now, they're hot. Will it continue? The sheer number of viable shooters suggests it will endure as a strength, even if not at this hot a clip. Damian Lillard, who finished with 23 points and made five of his 10 3s, has looked largely like the player the Bucks expected they were getting when they essentially flipped defense for offense (by swapping Jrue Holiday). Antetokounmpo, meanwhile, is probably having the best season of his career, which is certainly saying something for a two-time MVP. But something like this Cup run had to happen to stamp some validation on what the Bucks have been doing for the last month. It doesn't mean it'll equate to anything in the long run. The Lakers won the Cup last season and got swept in the first round of the playoffs. Momentum only lasts so long and is only good for so much. But the Bucks were a mess to start this season, and they don't look anything like that team right now. They're old, but the top-end talent is still there, especially on a given night. When a team has the talent, good things can always happen. Bad times can always turn around. It doesn't mean it can't flip again and start heading back south, and the Bucks still have to show they can beat the good teams if the 3-point disparity isn't so extremely in their favor, but for now the ship is more than steadied. It's actually starting to steam ahead, propelled by Tuesday night, when the Bucks recorded what was easily their best -- and in hindsight could end up being their most important -- win of the season. The Milwaukee Bucks are your 2024 NBA Cup champions. They dominated the second half en route to a 16-point win and have joined the Los Angeles Lakers as the only teams to win this event. Giannis Antetokounmpo finished with 26 points, 19 rebounds, 10 assists, two steals and three blocks in another truly phenomenal showing on the big stage. Damian Lillard added 23 points, and four assists, while the Bucks knocked down 17 3-pointers. The Thunder's defense did its job in making things difficult for the Bucks, but the offense did not show up. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored just 21 points on 24 shots, while the team as a whole shot 33.7% from the field overall, including a disastrous 5 of 32 from behind the arc. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive.

                "title": "Bucks vs Thunder score, highlights: Milwaukee wins NBA Cup tournament",
                "content": "Given the style of play in today’s NBA, 3-pointers are a necessity. In Tuesday’s NBA Cup final, the Milwaukee Bucks made them and the Oklahoma City Thunder did not. It also helps to have two-time MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo on your side. The Bucks captured the NBA Cup championship with a 97-81 victory against the Thunder, capitalizing on 3-pointers, a triple-double from Antetokounmpo (26 points, 19 rebounds and 10 assists) and 23 points from Damian Lillard. The Bucks outscored the Thunder 51-15 on 3-pointers, with Milwaukee shooting 42.5% from 3 (17-for-40), and the Thunder making just five of their 32 3-point attempts (15.6%). It’s about impossible to win a game in today’s NBA with that discrepancy. \"It's the best feeling ever, just winning,\" Antetokounmpo said. \"Winning feels good. Playing big games, feels good when you're able to come to the game and execute your game plan, and then the outcome is exactly what you want it to be.\" Brook Lopez had 13 points and nine rebounds, and Gary Trent Jr. also added 13 points off the bench for the Bucks. While this game does not count in the standings, the Bucks have rebounded from a 2-8 start and have won 13 of their past 16 games. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led the Thunder with 21 points but was just 8-for-24 from the field and 2-for-9 on 3s. Antetokounmpo earned NBA Cup MVP. In six Cup games, he averaged 30.5 points, 10.2 rebounds, 7.7 assists, 2.8 blocks and 1.2 steals and shot 66.7% from the field. Giannis Antetokounmpo's assist late in the fourth quarter gave him a triple-double with 26 points, 19 rebounds and 10 assists – plus three blocks and two steals as Milwaukee closed in on the NBA Cup title. The Thunder need a big fourth-quarter comeback. Milwaukee’s quick 6-2 start to the fourth quarter on 3-pointers by Gary Trent Jr. and Brook Lopez has extended its lead to 83-66 with 10:01 left in the fourth. Milwaukee’s Giannis Antetokounmpo is two assists from a triple-double, and the Bucks are 12 minutes from winning the NBA Cup. They have a 77-64 lead against Oklahoma City after three quarters as Antetokounmpo has 26 points, 15 rebounds, eight assists, two steals and one block, and teammate Damian Lillard has 20 points. They are the only two Bucks players in double figures, but five other Milwaukee players have at least five points. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander has a team-high 19 points, and Jalen Williams and Isaiah Hartenstein each have 14 points for the Thunder. However, Oklahoma City remains hampered by poor 3-point shooting – just 3-for-24 on 3s and it's been outscored 33-9 on 3s. It’s hard to win a high-level game shooting 12.5% from deep. Thunder coach Mark Daigneault did not like his team’s start to the third quarter and called a timeout 2 minutes, 6 seconds into the third with the Bucks ahead 59-53. Giannis Antetokounmpo is moving closer to that triple-double: he has 16 points, eight rebounds and seven assists. Damian Lillard is up to 15 points after making a 3-pointer. Giannis Antetokounmpo and Damian Lillard make the Bucks go – and they have Milwaukee halfway to an NBA Cup title. Milwaukee took a 51-50 lead into halftime, buoyed by Antetokounmpo’s 14 points, six rebounds and five assists (triple-double watch) and Lillard’s 12 points, four assists and three rebounds. The Bucks have 14 assists on 19 made field goals – ball movement is leading to good shots. Oklahoma City was just 1-for-17 on 3-pointers and was outscored by the Bucks 21-3 from that distance. Isaiah Hartenstein has a team-high 14 points for the Thunder. Jalen Williams had 11 points, and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander 10 for OKC in the first half. Gilgeous-Alexander is just 4-for-13 from the field, including 1-for-5 on 3s. Milwaukee’s Andre Jackson Jr. and Oklahoma City’s Isaiah Hartenstein were issued technical fouls for a brief altercation that occurred with 1:56 left in the second quarter. It appeared Jackson gave Thunder All-Star Shai Gilgeous-Alexander a little shove on a Gilgeous-Alexander field goal attempt. On the next possession, Hartenstein and Jackson exchanged words and had to be separated. After an altercation review by referees, both were given technical fouls. Isaiah Hartenstein (12 points), Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (10 points) and Jalen Williams (eight points) have combined for 30 points as the Thunder are up 41-37 against the Bucks with 6:15 left in the second quarter. Damian Lillard leads the Bucks with 12 points. Milwaukee has outscored Oklahoma City 21-3 on 3-pointers, but OKC is shooting 69.6% on shots inside the 3-point line while Milwaukee is just 5-for-16 on 2-pointers. In a first quarter that had six lead changes, the Thunder grabbed a 28-27 lead after the opening 12 minutes. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Isaiah Hartenstein each had 10 points for the Thunder, and Gilgeous-Alexander also had two rebounds and two assists. The potent 1-2 punch of Giannis Antetokounmpo and Damian Lillard combined for 13 of Milwaukee’s 27 points, and the Bucks went 5-for-9 from 3-point range to stay close. OKC shot 57.1% from the field (but just 1-for-6 on 3s) in the first quarter, and Milwaukee was 9-for-20 from the field. Even though the Thunder are 10-for-17 shooting from the field, they are 0-for-4 on 3-pointers. Meanwhile, the Bucks are shooing 46.7% from the field but have made four of their seven 3-pointers and own a 22-20 lead with 3:25 left in the first quarter. Taurean Prince, Brook Lopez, Bobby Portis and Damian Lillard have made 3s for Milwaukee. Thunder center Isaiah Hartenstein, one of the savvy offseason acquisitions, had six points (3-for-3 shooting) and two rebounds in the first three minutes, and teammate Jalen Williams, who is making a case for his first All-Star appearance, has four points, one rebound, one assist, one steal and one block as the Thunder own an early 16-9 lead, forcing a Milwaukee timeout with 7:30 left in the first quarter. Milwaukee small forward Khris Middleton, who played in his first game this season on Dec. 6, is out with a non-COVID illness. Milwaukee’s Giannis Antetokounmpo has won two MVPs. Oklahoma City’s Shai Gilgeous-Alexander finished second last season to Denver’s Nikola Jokic, who won his third MVP in four seasons. They are among the leading candidates for the 2024-25 MVP two months into the season, and Antetokounmpo’s Bucks play Gilgeous-Alexander’s Thunder in the NBA Cup final. The Bucks are hot after a 2-8 start and have won 12 of their past 15 games, and Antetokounmpo is leading the way. He is the NBA’s top scorer at 32.7 points per game and averages 11.5 rebounds, 6.1 assists and 1.6 blocks and shoots 61.4%, which would be a career high if he maintains that percentage. If the Bucks continue to win and vault into the top four in the Eastern Conference by season’s end (they are in sixth place right now), Antetokounmpo will have a great case for his third MVP. Gilgeous-Alexander averages 30.3 points, 6.3 assists, 5.5 rebounds and 1.9 steals and shoots 51% from the field, 34% on 3s and 86.4% on free throws – and the Thunder are atop the West at 20-5. Just two players (Gilgeous-Alexander and Jokic) average at least 30 points, 6.0 assists, 5.0 rebounds and 1.5 steals this season. A 60-win season with those stats might give Gilgeous-Alexander his first MVP. Here is the NBA Cup prize money for players in 2024: The prize money increased because the players and the league agreed on it in the 2023 collective bargaining agreement as it relates to basketball-related income. Following the first season of the NBA Cup in 2023, according to the CBA, prize money will increase \"for each subsequent Salary Cap Year: (A) for each IST Player on the Team that wins the IST Finals Game, an amount equal to $500,000 multiplied by the 'BRI Growth Factor' for such Salary Cap Year; (B) for each IST Player on the Team that loses the IST Finals Game, an amount equal to $200,000 multiplied by the BRI Growth Factor for such Salary Cap Year; (C) for each IST Player on a Team that loses an IST Semifinals game, $100,000 multiplied by the BRI Growth Factor for such Salary Cap Year; and (D) for each IST Player on a Team that loses an IST Quarterfinals game, $50,000 multiplied by the BRI Growth Factor for such Salary Cap Year.\" What is BRI growth factor? According to the CBA, \"the BRI Growth Factor for a Salary Cap Year is a fraction, the numerator of which is BRI for the immediately preceding Salary Cap Year and the denominator of which is BRI for the 2022-23 Salary Cap Year; provided, however, that the NBA and Players Association may agree to reduce the BRI Growth Factor for one (1) or more Salary Cap Years to a smaller fraction with value of no less than one (1).\" In simpler terms, the prize money is about a 3% increase season over season. The NBA Cup final tips off at 8:30 p.m. ET on Tuesday. Tuesday's NBA Cup final is at 8:30 p.m. ET on ABC and can be streamed on Fubo. Tuesday’s final is being played at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.

                "title": "Memphis vs West Virginia highlights: Frisco Bowl score, results",
                "content": "There was scoring left and right, but it was Memphis that emerged as the winners of the 2024 Frisco Bowl, beating West Virginia 42-37 in a highlight-filled game. Memphis started the game hot with 17-straight points to start the night, and it paved the way for the victory as West Virginia was forced to play catch-up. While the Mountaineers were able to pick it up, the Tigers made sure to respond each time and kept West Virginia from pulling off the comeback. West Virginia had a chance to take the lead late, but a Memphis interception sealed it. Both sides combined for 1,008 total yards. Quarterback Seth Henigan has stayed at Memphis the past four seasons, breaking plenty of school records and helping the Tigers become a contender in the American Athletic Conference. He ended his college career in great fashion with 294 yards on 18-for-26 passing and 54 yards on the ground in his 50th start. There were hopes of being the Group of Five representative in the College Football Playoff, and while it didn’t happen, Memphis still finished with 11 wins – its most since 2019 – and has back-to-back 10-win seasons for the first time in school history. On the other side, West Virginia finishes the season 6-7 and will begin its preparations for Rich Rodriguez’s second stint in Morgantown. Memphis almost gave West Virginia a last-second chance, but video review seals it for the Tigers. With 17 seconds left and at the Memphis 37-yard line, West Virginia's Garrett Greene threw a pass that was intercepted by Memphis' Elijah Herring. However, instead of going immediately down, Herring ran around a bit, and just as he was going down, the ball was punched out of his hands and recovered by the Mountaineers. The play went to video review, and officials determined Herring slid, giving himself up, before the ball came out, meaning Memphis held on to the ball. The Tigers then took a knee to finish the game. With under five minutes to go, West Virginia isn't done yet. Needing a touchdown, West Virginia went 75 yards on 12 plays in six-and-a-half minutes to make it a one-score game again. C.J. Donaldson Jr. had another 1-yard run to punch it in for the touchdown, his second score of the day. The running back has 22 carries for 83 yards and two catches for 11 yards. Now the Mountaineers need to get a stop in order to keep the chance of winning alive. A long pass helped set up a Memphis touchdown and pushes the lead back to two scores. On the first play following West Virginia's touchdown, Seth Henigan found Demeer Blankumsee on the go route and he stumbled just outside of the goal line for an 89-yard strike. On the next play, Brandon Thomas punched it in for the touchdown. West Virginia needed to convert a fourth down play, and it resulted in six points. After starting at their own 10-yard line, the Mountaineers went down the field and got all the way inside the Memphis 5-yard line. On third-and-goal, a completed pass ended right at the 1-yard line and the Mountaineers were faced with a decision. The offense stayed on the field, and it was a success with C.J. Donaldson Jr. just getting over the goal line. It's now a one-score game in Frisco. It remains a double-digit lead for Memphis heading into the final quarter. West Virginia has had to play catch-up for much of the game, and the defense finally made a stop in the third quarter to force a punt. The Mountaineers will start the fourth quarter with the ball and will try to claw back in this one. The West Virginia offense is doing all it can to stay in the game with its own touchdown on its first possession of the second half. It was a methodical drive down the field with Garrett Greene finding Hudson Clement in the end zone for the receiver's second touchdown on the night. The extra point was no good after the Mountaineers kicking unit couldn't get the snap down. The offense has picked up right where it left off with Memphis getting right back in the end zone to start the third quarter. The Tigers went 75 yards on eight plays to extend the lead, punctuated with a 3-yard run by Mario Anderson. It was all offense in the second quarter for both sides with 35 combined points scored in the frame and Memphis holding an 11-point lead. The Tigers got out to a fast start with a 17-0 lead, but West Virginia's offense woke up midway through the second quarter and wasted no time cutting the deficit. West Virginia kicker Michael Hayes made an 46-yard field goal as time expired in the first half. Both teams combined for 503 total yards in the first half and Memphis will get the ball out of halftime. Offense can't be stopped in Frisco. Memphis responded with a quick touchdown before halftime to give it a two-touchdown lead just before the break. The Tigers moved 75 yards in five plays and 47 seconds to add its second touchdown of the second quarter. Seth Henigan found Demeer Blankumsee in the corner of the endzone for an 18-yard touchdown pass, and the two Tigers connected again on the two-point conversion. When no one was open, Garrett Greene decided to take it to the house. The Mountaineers quarterback scrambled to the right and turned on the jets on the way to the endzone to close the deficit to six points. It's the 28th career touchdown for Greene, and the longest rushing touchdown for West Virginia this season. Kicker Tristian Vandenberg knocked in his second field goal of the night with a 42-yard kick through the uprights. Hudson Clement extended as far as he could to haul in a spectacular catch in the endzone and get West Virginia back in the game. The sophomore receiver was able to haul the catch and get a leg in bounds before stepping out. All Memphis needed was one play on the drive to strengthen its lead as Greg Desrosiers Jr. took it 46 yards to the house to make it a three-score game. Memphis made it a two-score lead to open the second quarter with a 34-yard field goal from Tristian Vandenberg. The score came off a West Virginia fumble. So far it's been all Memphis after 15 minutes as the West Virginia offense has struggled to do much early. The Mountaineers have generated just 28 yards of offense and just one first down in three drives. They gave Memphis good field position midway through the first frame that led to a Tigers touchdown. On the following drive, West Virginia's C.J. Donaldson Jr. fumbled the ball that set Memphis up on the Mountaineers' side of the field. Memphis took advantage of good field position to get in the end zone for the first score of the game. It was a mixture of the run and the pass that helped Memphis go 45 yards down the field, with quarterback Seth Henigan coming up big on a third down play with a 23-yard scramble to get inside the 5. On the next play, Henigan dumped it off to Mario Anderson Jr. and the running back leaped across the goal line for a 4-yard touchdown pass. The kickoff for the Scooter's Coffee Frisco Bowl game between the No. 23 Memphis Tigers and the West Virginia Mountaineers at Toyota Stadium in Frisco, Texas, is Tuesday at 9 p.m. ET. The Scooter's Coffee Frisco Bowl game between the No. 23 Memphis Tigers and the West Virginia Mountaineers will be televised nationally on ESPN. Live streaming is available on Fubo, which has a free trial. The Memphis Tigers are the favorites to defeat the West Virginia Mountaineers in the Frisco Bowl, according to the BetMGM college football odds on Tuesday afternoon. Wallach writes, \"The Tigers defense has been vulnerable at times, especially against big plays with an explosive rush and pass rate outside the top 100, but the team can feast on Greene’s shaky decision making. In a game that is being lined as a coin flip, there are plenty of reasons to side with the small favorite to cap its season with a win.\" Burke writes, \"The Tigers defense has given up a lot of points this season, but West Virginia doesn’t have the tempo or the potency of an AAC offense. QB Garrett Greene had a 13/11 TD/INT ratio and the Tigers were tied for ninth with 24 takeaways. They are also an opportunistic defense with 14 fumble recoveries. WVU only lost four fumbles during the season. But, as a defense, they only had 11 takeaways, so Memphis may very well carry the edge in the turnover margin department.\" The Athletic's team unanimously picked Memphis to win, one of only six unanimous predictions, alongside Notre Dame to beat Indiana, James Madison to beat Western Kentucky, Pitt to beat Toledo, Kansas State to beat Rutgers, and Syracuse to beat Washington State. Nate Duffett writes, \"Memphis' explosive offense should be too much for West Virginia in this game. We mentioned that when the Mountaineers lost, they lost big, which could be bad news when facing the Tigers' offense. Take Memphis to blow this game open with their passing game and hold on for a convincing victory, which they have been doing all season.\" There are 46 games on the college football postseason schedule this season, with the expansion of the College Football Playoff adding to the intrigue of bowl season. The Salute to Veterans Bowl between South Alabama and Western Michigan kicked off the action on Dec. 14, and it all comes to a conclusion 37 days later at the CFP national championship game.

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. FRISCO, Texas (AP) Seth Henigan had quite a homecoming for his final game as a four-year starter for Memphis, tying the American Athletic Conference career record with his 104th touchdown pass and leading the 25th-ranked Tigers to one more victory. Henigan threw for 294 yards and two touchdowns, and was one yard short of another score, as the Tigers held on for a 42-37 win over West Virginia in the Frisco Bowl on Tuesday night. They got 11 wins for only the second time in 109 years of Memphis football. “It's meant the world to me, and just to be able to go out with the win, I feel like that's a good way to cap off a pretty good career,” Henigan said. “And having stayed at the same university four years, I hope that's a testament to who I am, and about the people around me.” The only current four-year FBS starting quarterback to do that all with the same school, Henigan's 50th game for the Tigers (11-2) came just over 20 miles from his hometown of Denton, Texas. He completed 18 of 26 passes, including an 89-yard catch-and-run in the fourth quarter when DeMeer Blankumsee was tripped up at the 1. Even though Henigan knew that would have pushed him one past the 104 touchdowns that Clayton Tune had for Houston from 2018-22, he handed off to Brandon Thomas for a 1-yard touchdown on the next play. Even when he had a run-pass option. “I'm just happy that we came out with a win,” Henigan said. West Virginia (6-7) had scored on six consecutive possessions (four touchdowns) before one more chance in the final minute after the Tigers missed a 50-yard field goal. But the Mountaineers’ final push ended when Elijah Herring had an interception. “The ebbs and flows of a football game. We did what we needed to, we found a way,” said fifth-year coach Ryan Silverfield, now 4-0 in the bowl games the Tigers have played. “That’s kind of the mantra all season. Just leave no doubt, find a way.” Sitting at the podium afterward, Silverfield said he was savoring his final few minutes with Henigan as his quarterback. “He's meant everything,” Silverfield said. “For him to stay loyal to this place, he is a rare breed.\" Garrett Greene was 29-of-40 passing for 328 yards with two TD passes to Hudson Clement, and also ran for 95 yards and a score for West Virginia. Clement finished with 11 catches for 166 yards, and CJ Donaldson ran for 83 yards and two TDs. The Mountaineers played five days after Rich Rodriguez was re-hired for a second stint as head coach at his alma mater 17 years after he left. He was at the game while offensive coordinator Chad Scott served as the interim head coach. “We didn’t start out as fast as we wanted to play, and the guys never wavered,” Scott said. “They were resilient and responded. It didn’t work out for us in the end.” Memphis never trailed, going ahead 7-0 on Henigan’s first TD pass about 10 minutes into the game, a 4-yard underhand scoop to Mario Anderson on the next play after the quarterback had a 23-yard run. His AAC record-matching score was an 18-yarder to Blankumsee with 55 seconds left in the first half for a 28-14 lead. Henigan finished as the Memphis career leader with 14,266 yards, 104 touchdowns and 1,147 completions. All of those records were previously held by Brady White, the quarterback he succeeded for the Tigers. West Virginia trailed 17-0 early in the second quarter after Greene had a fourth-down incompletion and Greg Desrosiers ran 46 yards for a Memphis TD on the next play. The Mountaineers then scored on six consecutive possessions, and outgained Memphis 534 total yards to 474. Memphis scored at least 20 points in its 40th consecutive game since November 2021, by far the nation's longest active streak. Next on the list is Miami's 16 games in a row. ... The Tigers already had consecutive 10-win seasons for the first time. The only other time they had more wins was when going 12-2 in 2019. Rodriguez opens his second stint as West Virginia's head coach at home against FCS team Robert Morris on Aug. 30. His last game with the Mountaineers was a 13-9 loss to Pittsburgh in a regular-season finale on Dec. 1, 2007 that cost them a chance to play in the BCS national championship game. He then left for Michigan. Memphis has won its last eight games in its home stadium, starting with a win over Big 12 team Iowa State in the 2023 Liberty Bowl. Their 2025 opener is there against FCS team Chattanooga on Aug. 30. --- Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season. Sign up here.

        "Vanuatu": [
            {
                "title": "Vanuatu - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Vanuatu (English: /ˌvɑːnuˈɑːtuː/ ⓘ VAH-noo-AH-too or /vænˈwɑːtuː/ van-WAH-too; Bislama and French pronunciation [vanuatu]), officially the Republic of Vanuatu (French: République de Vanuatu; Bislama: Ripablik blong Vanuatu), is an island country in Melanesia located in the South Pacific Ocean. The archipelago, which is of volcanic origin, is 1,750 km (1,090 mi) east of northern Australia, 540 km (340 mi) northeast of New Caledonia, east of New Guinea, southeast of Solomon Islands, and west of Fiji. Vanuatu was first inhabited by Melanesian people. The first Europeans to visit the islands were a Spanish expedition led by Portuguese navigator Fernandes de Queirós, who arrived on the largest island, Espíritu Santo, in 1606. Queirós claimed the archipelago for Spain, as part of the colonial Spanish East Indies and named it La Austrialia del Espíritu Santo. In the 1880s, France and the United Kingdom claimed parts of the archipelago, and in 1906, they agreed on a framework for jointly managing the archipelago as the New Hebrides through an Anglo-French condominium. An independence movement arose in the 1970s, and the Republic of Vanuatu was founded in 1980. Since independence, the country has become a member of the United Nations, Commonwealth of Nations, Organisation internationale de la Francophonie, and the Pacific Islands Forum. Vanuatu's name derives from the word vanua (\"land\" or \"home\"),[9] which occurs in several Austronesian languages,[a] combined with the word tu, meaning \"to stand\" (from Proto-Oceanic *tuqur).[10] Together, the two words convey the independent status of the country.[11] The history of Vanuatu before European colonisation is mostly obscure because of the lack of written sources up to that point, and because only limited archaeological work has been conducted; Vanuatu's volatile geology and climate is also likely to have destroyed or hidden many prehistoric sites.[12] Archaeological evidence gathered since the 1980s supports the theory that the Vanuatuan islands were first settled about 3,000 years ago, in the period roughly between 1100 BCE and 700 BCE.[12][13] These were almost certainly people of the Lapita culture. The formerly widespread idea that Vanuatu might have been only marginally affected by this culture was rendered obsolete by the evidence uncovered in recent decades at numerous sites on most of the islands in the archipelago, ranging from the Banks Islands in the north to Aneityum in the south.[12] Notable Lapita sites include Teouma on Éfaté, Uripiv, and Vao off the coast of Malakula, and Makue on Aore. Several ancient burial sites have been excavated, most notably Teouma on Éfaté, which has a large ancient cemetery containing the remains of 94 individuals.[12] There are also sites – on Éfaté and on the adjacent islands of Lelepa and Eretoka – associated with the 16th–17th century chief or chiefs called Roy Mata. (This may be a title held by different men over several generations.) Roy Mata is said to have united local clans and instituted and presided over an era of peace.[14][15] The stories about Roy Mata come from local oral tradition and are consistent with centuries-old evidence uncovered at archaeological sites.[15] The Lapita sites became Vanuatu's first UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2008.[16][17] The immediate origins of the Lapita lie to the northwest, in the Solomon Islands archipelago and the Bismarck Archipelago of Papua New Guinea,[12] though DNA studies of a 3,000-year-old skeleton found near Port Vila in 2016 indicates that some may have arrived directly from the Philippines and/or Taiwan, pausing only briefly en route.[18] They brought with them crops such as yam, taro, and banana, as well as domesticated animals such as pigs and chickens.[12] Their arrival is coincident with the extinction of several species, such as the land crocodile (Mekosuchus kalpokasi), land tortoise (Meiolania damelipi) and various flightless bird species.[12] Lapita settlements reached as far east as Tonga and Samoa at their greatest extent.[12] Over time, the Lapita culture lost much of its early unity; as such, it became increasingly fragmented, the precise reasons for which are unclear. Over the centuries, pottery, settlement and burial practices in Vanuatu all evolved in a more localised direction, with long-distance trade and migration patterns contracting.[12] Nevertheless, some limited long-distance trade did continue, with similar cultural practices and late-period items also being found in Fiji, New Caledonia, the Bismarcks and the Solomons.[12] Finds in central and southern Vanuatu, such as distinctive adzes, also indicate some trade connections with, and possibly population movements of, Polynesian peoples to the east.[12][14] Over time, it is thought that the Lapita either mixed with, or acted as pioneers for, migrants coming from the Bismarks and elsewhere in Melanesia, ultimately producing the darker-skinned physiognomy that is typical of modern Ni-Vanuatu.[19][20] Linguistically, the Lapita peoples' Austronesian languages were maintained, with all of the numerous 100+ autochthonous languages of Vanuatu being classified as belonging to the Oceanic branch of the Austronesian language family.[21] This linguistic hyperdiversity resulted from a number of factors: continuing waves of migration, the existence of numerous decentralised and generally self-sufficient communities, hostilities between people groups, with none able to dominate any of the others, and the difficult geography of Vanuatu that impeded inter- and intra-island travel and communication.[22] The geological record also shows that a huge volcanic eruption occurred on Ambrym in c. 200 CE, which would have devastated local populations and likely resulted in further population movements.[12][14][23] Human cannibalism was widespread in some parts of Vanuatu.[24] The Vanuatu islands first had contact with Europeans in April 1606, when the Portuguese explorer Pedro Fernandes de Queirós, sailing for the Spanish Crown, departed El Callao,[25] sailed by the Banks Islands, landing briefly on Gaua (which he called Santa María).[14][26] Continuing further south, Queirós arrived at the largest island, naming it La Austrialia del Espíritu Santo or \"The Southern Land of the Holy Spirit\", believing he had arrived in Terra Australis (Australia).[12][27] The Spanish established a short-lived settlement named Nueva Jerusalem at Big Bay on the north side of the island.[14][26] Despite Queirós's intention, relations with the Ni-Vanuatu turned violent within days. The Spanish subsequent attempts to make contact were met with the islanders fleeing or leading the explorers into an ambush.[14] Many of the crew, including Queirós, were also suffering from ill health, with Queirós's mental state also deteriorating.[14][26] The settlement was abandoned after a month, with Queirós continuing his search for the southern continent.[14] Europeans did not return until 1768, when the French explorer Louis Antoine de Bougainville sailed by the islands on 22 May, naming them the Great Cyclades.[28][12] Of the various French toponyms Bougainville devised, only Pentecost Island has stuck.[26] The French landed on Ambae, trading with the native people in a peaceful manner, though Bougainville stated that they were later attacked, necessitating him to fire warning shots with his muskets, before his crew left and continued their voyage.[26] In July–September 1774 the islands were explored extensively by British explorer Captain James Cook, who named them the New Hebrides, after the Hebrides off the west coast of Scotland, a name that lasted until independence in 1980.[29][12][26] Cook managed to maintain generally cordial relations with the Ni-Vanuatu by giving them presents and refraining from violence.[14][26] In 1789, William Bligh and the remainder of his crew sailed through the Banks Islands on their return voyage to Timor following the mutiny on the Bounty; Bligh later returned to the islands, naming them after his benefactor Joseph Banks.[30] Whaleships were among the first regular visitors to this group of islands. The first recorded visit was by the Rose in February 1804, and the last known visit by the New Bedford ship John and Winthrop in 1887.[31] In 1825, the trader Peter Dillon's discovery of sandalwood on the island of Erromango, highly valued as an incense in China where it could be traded for tea, resulted in rush of incomers that ended in 1830 after a clash between immigrant Polynesian workers and indigenous Ni-Vanuatu.[12][32][33][34] Further sandalwood trees were found on Efate, Espiritu Santo, and Aneityum, prompting a series of boom and busts, though supplies were essentially exhausted by the mid-1860s, and the trade largely ceased.[32][34] During the 1860s, planters in Australia, Fiji, New Caledonia, and the Samoan islands, in need of labourers, encouraged a long-term indentured labour trade called \"blackbirding\".[34] At the height of the labour trade, more than one-half the adult male population of several of the islands worked abroad. Because of this, and the poor conditions and abuse often faced by workers, as well the introduction of common diseases to which native Ni-Vanuatu had no immunity, the population of Vanuatu declined severely, with the current population being greatly reduced compared to pre-contact times.[29][12][34] Greater oversight of the trade saw it gradually wind down, with Australia barring any further 'blackbird' labourers in 1906, followed by Fiji and Samoa in 1910 and 1913 respectively.[34] From 1839 onwards, missionaries, both Roman Catholic and Protestant, arrived on the islands.[14][34] At first, they faced hostility, most notably with the killings of John Williams and James Harris of the London Missionary Society on Erromango in 1839.[14][35] Despite this, they pressed on, resulting in many conversions. To the consternation of the Europeans, Ni-Vanuatu syncretised Christianity with traditional kastom beliefs.[34] The Anglican Melanesian Mission also took young converts for further training in New Zealand and Norfolk Island.[14] Presbyterian missionaries are particularly successful on Aneityum, though less so on Tanna, with missionaries being repeatedly chased off the island by locals throughout the 1840s–60s.[14] The waves of illnesses and deaths the missionaries brought with them may have been partly to blame for the hostile response.[14][34] Other European settlers also came, looking for land for cotton plantations, the first of these being Henry Ross Lewin on Tanna in 1865 (which he later abandoned).[36] When international cotton prices collapsed after the ending of the American Civil War, they switched to coffee, cocoa, bananas, and, most successfully, coconuts. Initially British subjects from Australia made up the majority of settlers, but with little support from the British government they frequently struggled to make a success of their settlements.[34] French planters also began arriving, beginning with Ferdinand Chevillard on Efate in 1880, and later in larger numbers following the creation of the Compagnie Caledonienne des Nouvelles-Hébrides (CCNH) I. 1882 by John Higginson (a fiercely pro-French Irishman), which soon tipped the balance in favour of French subjects.[37][38] The French government took over the CCNH in 1894 and actively encouraged French settlement.[34] By 1906, French settlers (at 401) outnumbered the British (228), almost two to one.[29][34] The jumbling of French and British interests in the islands and the near lawlessness prevalent there brought petitions for one or both of the two powers to annex the territory.[34] The Convention of 16 October 1887 established a joint naval commission for the sole purpose of protecting French and British citizens, with no claim to jurisdiction over internal native affairs.[14][39] Hostilities between settlers and Ni-Vanuatu were commonplace, often centring on disputes over land which had been purchased in dubious circumstances.[34] There was pressure from French settlers in New Caledonia to annex the islands, though Britain was unwilling to relinquish their influence completely.[14] As a result, in 1906, France and the United Kingdom agreed to administer the islands jointly; called the Anglo-French Condominium, it was a unique form of government with two separate governmental, legal, judicial and financial systems that came together only in a Joint Court.[34][40] Land expropriation and exploitation of Ni-Vanuatu workers on plantations continued apace.[34] In an effort to curb the worst of the abuses, and with the support of the missionaries, the Condominium's authority was extended via the Anglo-French Protocol of 1914, although this was not formally ratified until 1922.[34] While this resulted in some improvements, labour abuses continued, and Ni-Vanuatu were barred from acquiring the citizenship of either power, being officially stateless.[29][34] The underfunded Condominium government proved dysfunctional, with the duplication of administrations making effective governance difficult and time-consuming.[34] Education, healthcare and other such services were left in the hands of the missionaries.[34] During the 1920s–1930s, indentured workers from Vietnam (then part of French Indochina) came to work in the plantations in the New Hebrides.[41] By 1929, there were some 6,000 Vietnamese people in the New Hebrides.[34][41] There was some social and political unrest among them in the 1940s due to the poor working conditions and the social effects of Allied troops, who were generally more sympathetic to their plight than the planters.[42] Most Vietnamese were repatriated in 1946 and 1963, though a small Vietnamese community remains in Vanuatu today.[43] The Second World War brought immense change to the archipelago. The fall of France to Nazi Germany in 1940 allowed Britain to gain a greater level of authority on the islands.[40] The Australian military stationed a 2,000-strong force on Malakula in a bid to protect Australia from a possible Japanese invasion.[40] Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, the United States joined the war on the Allied side; Japan soon advanced rapidly throughout Melanesia and was in possession of much of what is now Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands by April 1942, leaving the New Hebrides on the frontline of any further advance.[40] To forestall this, from May 1942 US troops were stationed on the islands, where they built airstrips, roads, military bases and an array of other supporting infrastructure on Efate and Espiritu Santo.[44] At the peak of the deployment, some 50,000 Americans were stationed on the two military bases, outnumbering the native population of roughly 40,000, with thousands more Allied troops passing through the islands at some point.[44] A small Ni-Vanuatu force of some 200 men (the New Hebrides Defence Force) was established to support the Americans, and thousands more were engaged in the construction and maintenance work as part of the Vanuatu Labor Corps.[44] The American presence effectively sidelined the Anglo-French authorities for the duration of their stay, with the Americans' more tolerant and friendly attitude to the Ni-Vanuatu, informal habits, relative wealth, and the presence of African American troops serving with a degree of equality (albeit in a segregated force) seriously undermining the underlying ethos of colonial superiority.[44] Wartime Vanuatu was the setting for James Michener's novel Tales of the South Pacific. With the successful reoccupation of the Solomons in 1943 the New Hebrides lost their strategic importance, and the Americans withdrew in 1945, selling much of their equipment at bargain prices and dumping the rest in the sea, at a place now called Million Dollar Point on Espiritu Santo.[34] The rapid American deployment and withdrawal led to growth in 'cargo cults', most notably that of John Frum, whereby Ni-Vanuatu hoped that by returning to traditional values whilst mimicking aspects of the American presence that 'cargo' (i.e. large quantities of American goods) would be delivered to them.[45][46] Meanwhile, the Condominium government returned, though understaffed and underfunded, it struggled to reassert its authority.[34] Decolonisation began sweeping the European empires after the war, and from the 1950s the Condominium government began a somewhat belated campaign of modernisation and economic development.[34] Hospitals were built, doctors trained and immunisation campaigns carried out.[34] The inadequate mission-run school system was taken over and improved, with primary enrollment greatly increasing to be near-universal by 1970.[34] There was greater oversight of the plantations, with worker exploitation being clamped down on and Ni-Vanuatu paid higher wages.[34] New industries, such as cattle ranching, commercial fishing and manganese mining were established.[34] Ni-Vanuatu began gradually to take over more positions of power and influence within the economy and the church.[34] Despite this, the British and French still dominated the politics of the colony, with an Advisory Council set up in 1957 containing some Ni-Vanuatu representation having little power.[34] The economic development had unintended consequences. In the 1960s, many planters began fencing off and clearing large areas of bushland for cattle ranching, which were often deemed to be communally-held kastom lands by Ni-Vanuatu.[34] On Espiritu Santo, the Nagriamel movement was founded in 1966 by Chief Buluk and Jimmy Stevens on a platform of opposing any further land clearances and gradual, Ni-Vanuatu-led, economic development.[34][47] The movement gained a large following, prompting a crackdown by the authorities, with Buluk and Stevens being arrested in 1967.[34] Upon their release, they began to press for complete independence.[34] In 1971, Father Walter Lini established another party: the New Hebrides Cultural Association, later renamed the New Hebrides National Party (NHNP), which also focused on achieving independence and opposition to land expropriation.[34] The NNDP first came to prominence in 1971, when the Condominium government was forced to intervene after a rash of land speculation by foreign nationals.[34] Meanwhile, French settlers, and Francophone and mixed-race Ni-Vanuatu, established two separate parties on a platform of more gradual political development – the Mouvement Autonomiste des Nouvelles-Hébrides (MANH), based on Espiritu Santo, and the Union des Communautés des Nouvelles-Hébrides (UCNH) on Efate.[34] The parties aligned on linguistic and religious lines: the NHNP was seen as the party of Anglophone Protestants, and were backed by the British who wished to exit the colony altogether, whereas the MANH, UCNH, Nagriamel and others (collectively known as the 'Moderates') represented Catholic Francophone interests, and a more gradual path to independence.[34] France backed these groups as they were keen to maintain their influence in the region, most especially in their mineral-rich colony of New Caledonia where they were attempting to suppress an independence movement.[34][48] Meanwhile, economic development continued, with numerous banks and financial centres opening up in the early 1970s to take advantage of the territory's tax haven status.[34] A mini-building boom took off in Port Vila and, following the building of a deep-sea wharf, cruise ship tourism grew rapidly, with annual arrivals reaching 40,000 by 1977.[34] The boom encouraged increasing urbanisation and the populations of Port Vila and Luganville grew rapidly.[34] In November 1974, the British and French met and agreed to create New Hebrides Representative Assembly in the colony, based partly on universal suffrage and partly on appointed persons representing various interest groups.[34] The first election took place in November 1975, resulting in an overall victory for the NHNP.[34] The Moderates disputed the results, with Jimmy Stevens threatening to secede and declare independence.[34] The Condominium's Resident Commissioners decided to postpone the opening of the Assembly, though the two sides proved unable to agree on a solution, prompting protests and counter-protests, some of which turned violent.[34][49][50] After discussions and some fresh elections in disputed areas, the Assembly finally convened in November 1976.[34][51][52] The NHNP renamed itself the Vanua'aku Pati (VP) in 1977, and now supported immediate independence under a strong central government and an Anglicisation of the islands. The Moderates meanwhile supported a more gradual transition to independence and a federal system, plus the maintenance of French as an official language.[34] In March 1977, a joint Anglo-French and Ni-Vanuatu conference was held in London, at which it was agreed to hold fresh Assembly elections and later an independence referendum in 1980; the VP boycotted the conference and the subsequent election in November.[34][53] They set up a parallel 'People's Provisional Government' which had de facto control of many areas, prompting violent confrontations with Moderates and the Condominium government.[34][54][55] A compromise was eventually brokered, a Government of National Unity formed under a new constitution, and fresh elections held in November 1979, which the VP won with a comfortable majority. Independence was now scheduled for 30 July 1980.[34] Performing less well than expected, the Moderates disputed the results.[34][56] Tensions continued throughout 1980. Violent confrontations occurred between VP and Moderate supporters on several islands.[34] On Espiritu Santo Nagriamel and Moderate activists under Jimmy Stevens, funded by the American libertarian organisation Phoenix Foundation, took over the island's government in January and declared the independent Republic of Vemarana, prompting VP supporters to flee and the central government to institute a blockade.[34][57] In May, an abortive Moderate rebellion broke out on Tanna, in the course of which one of their leaders was shot and killed.[34] The British and French sent in troops in July in a bid to forestall the Vemarana secessionists. Still ambivalent about independence, the French effectively neutered the force, prompting a collapse of law and order on Espiritu Santo resulting in large scale looting.[34] The New Hebrides, now renamed Vanuatu, achieved independence as planned on 30 July 1980 under Prime Minister Walter Lini, with a ceremonial President replacing the Resident Commissioners.[34][58][59] The Anglo-French forces withdrew in August, and Lini called in troops from Papua New Guinea, sparking the brief 'Coconut War' against Jimmy Stevens's Vemarana separatists.[34][60] The PNG forces quickly quelled the Vemarana revolt and Stevens surrendered on 1 September; he was later jailed.[34][61][62] Lini remained in office until 1991, running an Anglophone-dominated government and winning both the 1983 and 1987 elections.[63][64] In foreign affairs, Lini joined the Non Aligned Movement, opposed Apartheid in South Africa and all forms of colonialism, established links with Libya and Cuba, and opposed the French presence in New Caledonia and their nuclear testing in French Polynesia.[65][66] Opposition to Lini's tight grip on power grew and in 1987, after he had suffered a stroke whilst on a visit to the United States, a section of the Vanua'aku Pati (VP) under Barak Sopé broke off to form a new party (the Melanesian Progressive Party, MPP), and an attempt was made by President Ati George Sokomanu to unseat Lini.[60] This failed, and Lini became increasingly distrustful of his VP colleagues, firing anyone he deemed to be disloyal.[64] One such person, Donald Kalpokas, subsequently declared himself to be VP leader, splitting the party in two.[64] On 6 September 1991 a vote of no confidence removed Lini from power;[64] Kalpokas became prime minister, and Lini formed a new party, the National United Party (NUP).[64][60] Meanwhile, the economy had entered a downturn, with foreign investors and foreign aid put off by Lini's flirtation with Communist states and tourist numbers down due to the political turmoil, compounded by a crash in the price of copra, Vanuatu's main export.[64] As a result, the Francophone Union of Moderate Parties (UMP) won the 1991 election, but not with enough seats to form a majority. A coalition was thus formed with Lini's NUP, with the UMP's Maxime Carlot Korman becoming prime minister.[64] Since the 1991 general election, Vanuatuan politics have been unstable with a series of fractious coalition governments and the use of no confidence votes resulting in frequent changes of prime ministers. The democratic system as a whole has been maintained and Vanuatu remains a peaceful and reasonably prosperous state. Throughout most of the 1990s the UMP were in power, the prime ministership switching between UMP rivals Korman and Serge Vohor, and the UMP instituting a more free market approach to the economy, cutting the public sector, improving opportunities for Francophone Ni-Vanuatu and renewing ties with France.[64][67] The government struggled with splits in their NUP coalition partner and a series of strikes within the Civil Service in 1993–1994, the latter dealt with by a wave of firings.[64] Financial scandals dogged both Korman and Vohor, with the latter implicated in a scheme to sell Vanuatu passports to foreigners.[68][69] In 1996, Vohor and President Jean-Marie Léyé were briefly abducted by the Vanuatu Mobile Force over a pay dispute and later released unharmed.[70][60] A riot occurred in Port Vila in 1998 when savers attempted to withdraw funds from the Vanuatu National Provident Fund following allegations of financial impropriety, prompting the government to declare a brief state of emergency.[60][69] A Comprehensive Reform Program was enacted in the 1998 with the aim of improving economic performance and cracking down on government corruption.[69] At the 1998 Vanuatuan general election the UMP were unseated by the VP under Donald Kalpokas.[60][71][72] He lasted only a year, resigning when threatened with a no confidence vote, replaced by Barak Sopé of the MPP in 1999, himself unseated in a no confidence vote in 2001.[73][69] Despite the political uncertainty Vanuatu's economy continued to grow in this period, fuelled by high demand for Vanuatu beef, tourism, remittances from foreign workers, and large aid packages from the Asian Development Bank (in 1997) and the US Millennium Challenge fund (in 2005).[74] Vanuatu was removed from the OECD list of 'uncooperative tax havens' in 2003 and joined the World Trade Organization in 2011.[74][75] Edward Natapei of the VP became prime minister in 2001 and went on to win the 2002 Vanuatuan general election.[76] The 2004 Vanuatuan general election saw Vohor and the UMP return to power. He lost much support over a secret deal to recognise Taiwan in the China-Taiwan dispute and was unseated in a confidence vote less than five months after taking office, being replaced by Ham Lini.[77][78] Lini switched back recognition to the People's Republic of China, and the PRC remains a major aid donor to the Vanuatu government.[79][80] In 2007, violent clashes broke out in Port Vila between migrants from Tanna and Ambrym, in which two people died.[81][75] Lini lost the 2008 Vanuatuan general election, with Natapei returning to power as Vanuatu politics entered a period of turmoil. There were frequent attempts by the opposition to unseat Natapei via the use of no confidence votes – though unsuccessful, he was briefly removed on a procedural technicality in November 2009, an action that was then overturned by the Chief Justice.[82][83] Sato Kilman of the People's Progressive Party (PPP) ousted Natapei in another no confidence vote in December 2010. He was removed in the same manner by Vohor's UMP in April 2011. This was invalidated on a technical point and he returned as PM. The Chief Justice then overturned his victory. Natapei returned to power for ten days, until Parliament voted in Kilman again.[84] Kilman managed to remain in office for two years, before being ousted in March 2013.[85] The new government was the first time the Green Confederation was in power, and the new prime minister, Moana Carcasses Kalosil, was the first non-Ni-Vanuatu to hold the position (Kalosil is of mixed French-Tahitian ancestry and a naturalised Vanuatu citizen). Kalosil took steps to institute a review of diplomatic passport sales in his country. He also expressed his support for the West Papuan independence movement. Support for this move was also expressed by former Prime Ministers Kilman and Carlot Korman.[86][87][88][89] Kalosil was ousted in another confidence vote in 2014, with the VP returning under Joe Natuman, who himself was ousted the following year in a confidence vote led by Kilman. Meanwhile, the country was devastated by Cyclone Pam in 2015, which resulted in 16 deaths and enormous destruction.[90] A corruption investigation in 2015 resulted in the conviction of numerous MPs in Kilman's government for bribery, including former PM Moana Carcasses Kalosil.[91][92] His authority was severely weakened, and Kilman lost the 2016 Vanuatuan general election to Charlot Salwai's Reunification Movement for Change (RMC). Salwai in turn lost the 2020 Vanuatuan general election amidst allegations of perjury, bringing back in the VP under Bob Loughman as the country dealt with the aftermath of Cyclone Harold and the global COVID-19 pandemic.[93][94] Vanuatu was one of the last places on Earth to suffer a coronavirus outbreak, recording its first case of COVID-19 in November 2020.[95] In October 2023, Vanuatu aimed itself at being the first Pacific country to eliminate cervical cancer.[96] Vanuatu is a Y-shaped archipelago consisting of about 83 relatively small, geologically newer islands of volcanic origin (65 of them inhabited), with about 1,300 kilometres (810 mi) between the most northern and southern islands.[97][98] Two of these islands (Matthew and Hunter) are also claimed and controlled by France as part of the French collectivity of New Caledonia. The country lies between latitudes 13°S and 21°S and longitudes 166°E and 171°E. The fourteen of Vanuatu's islands that have surface areas of more than 100 square kilometres (39 sq mi) are, from largest to smallest: Espiritu Santo, Malakula, Efate, Erromango, Ambrym, Tanna, Pentecost, Epi, Ambae or Aoba, Gaua, Vanua Lava, Maewo, Malo and Aneityum or Anatom. The nation's largest towns are the capital Port Vila, on Efate, and Luganville on Espiritu Santo.[99] The highest point in Vanuatu is Mount Tabwemasana, at 1,879 metres (6,165 ft), on the island of Espiritu Santo. Vanuatu's total area is roughly 12,274 square kilometres (4,739 sq mi),[100] of which its land surface is very limited (roughly 4,700 square kilometres (1,800 sq mi)). Most of the islands are steep, with unstable soils and little permanent freshwater.[98] One estimate, made in 2005, is that only 9% of land is used for agriculture (7% with permanent crops, plus 2% considered arable).[101] The shoreline is mostly rocky with fringing reefs and no continental shelf, dropping rapidly into the ocean depths.[98] There are several active volcanoes in Vanuatu, including Lopevi, Mount Yasur and several underwater volcanoes. Volcanic activity is common, with an ever-present danger of a major eruption; a nearby undersea eruption of 6.4 magnitude occurred in November 2008 with no casualties, and an eruption occurred in 1945.[102] Vanuatu is recognised as a distinct terrestrial ecoregion, which is known as the Vanuatu rain forests.[103] It is part of the Australasian realm, which includes New Caledonia, the Solomon Islands, Australia, New Guinea and New Zealand. Vanuatu's population (estimated in 2008 as growing 2.4% annually)[104] is placing increasing pressure on land and resources for agriculture, grazing, hunting, and fishing. 90% of Vanuatu households fish and consume fish, which has caused intense fishing pressure near villages and the depletion of near-shore fish species. While well-vegetated, most islands show signs of deforestation. The islands have been logged, particularly of high-value timber, subjected to wide-scale slash-and-burn agriculture, and converted to coconut plantations and cattle ranches, and now show evidence of increased soil erosion and landslides.[98] Many upland watersheds are being deforested and degraded, and fresh water is becoming increasingly scarce. Proper waste disposal, as well as water and air pollution, are becoming troublesome issues around urban areas and large villages. Additionally, the lack of employment opportunities in industry and inaccessibility to markets have combined to lock rural families into a subsistence or self-reliance mode, putting tremendous pressure on local ecosystems.[98] The country had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 8.82/10, ranking it 18th globally out of 172 countries.[105] Despite its tropical forests, Vanuatu has relatively few terrestrial plant and animal species. It has an indigenous flying fox, Pteropus anetianus. Flying foxes are important rainforest and timber regenerators. They pollinate and disperse seed from a variety of native trees. Their diet is nectar, pollen and fruit and they are commonly called \"fruit bats\". They are in decline across their South Pacific range. The 19 species of native reptiles include the flowerpot snake, found only on Efate. The Fiji banded iguana (Brachylophus fasciatus) was introduced as a feral animal in the 1960s.[106][107] There are eleven species of bats (three unique to Vanuatu) and sixty-one species of land and water birds. While the small Polynesian rat is thought to be indigenous, the large species arrived with Europeans, as did domesticated hogs, dogs, and cattle. The ant species of some of the islands of Vanuatu were catalogued by E. O. Wilson.[108] The region has more than 4,000 species of marine molluscs and a large diversity of marine fishes. Cone snails and stonefish carry poison that is fatal to humans. The Giant East African land snail arrived only in the 1970s but has already spread from the Port Vila region to Luganville. There are three or possibly four adult saltwater crocodiles living in Vanuatu's mangroves and no current breeding population.[107] It is said the crocodiles reached the northern part of the islands after cyclones, given the island chain's proximity to the Solomon Islands and New Guinea, where crocodiles are common.[109] The climate is tropical, with about nine months of warm to hot rainy weather and the possibility of cyclones and three to four months of cooler, drier weather characterised by winds from the southeast. The water temperature ranges from 22 °C (72 °F) in winter to 28 °C (82 °F) in the summer. Cool between April and September, the days become hotter and more humid starting in October. The daily temperature ranges from 20–32 °C (68–90 °F). Southeasterly trade winds occur from May to October.[98] Vanuatu has a long rainy season, with significant rainfall almost every month. The wettest and hottest months are December through April, which also constitutes the cyclone season. The driest months are June through November.[98] Rainfall averages about 2,360 millimetres (93 in) per year but can be as high as 4,000 millimetres (160 in) in the northern islands.[101] According to the WorldRiskIndex 2021, Vanuatu ranks first among the countries with the highest disaster risk worldwide.[110] In March 2015, Cyclone Pam impacted much of Vanuatu as a Category 5 severe tropical cyclone, causing deaths and extensive damage to all the islands. As of 17 March 2015[update] the United Nations said the official death toll was 11 (six from Efate and five from Tanna), and 30 were reported injured; these numbers were expected to rise as more remote islands reported back.[111][112] Vanuatu lands minister, Ralph Regenvanu said, \"This is the worst disaster to affect Vanuatu ever as far as we know.\"[113] In April 2020, Cyclone Harold travelled through the Espiritu Santo town of Luganville, causing great material damage there and on at least four islands.[114] Vanuatu has relatively frequent earthquakes. Of the 58 M7 or greater events that occurred between 1909 and 2001, few were studied. A severe earthquake in November 1999, followed by a tsunami, caused extensive damage to the northern island of Pentecost, leaving thousands homeless. Another powerful earthquake in January 2002 caused extensive damage in the capital, Port Vila, and surrounding areas and was also followed by a tsunami. Another earthquake of 7.2 struck on 2 August 2007.[115] The Republic of Vanuatu is a parliamentary democracy[116] with a written constitution, which declares that the \"head of the Republic shall be known as the President and shall symbolise the unity of the nation.\" The powers of the President of Vanuatu, who is elected for a five-year term by a two-thirds vote of an electoral college, are primarily ceremonial.[117] The electoral college consists of members of Parliament and the presidents of Regional Councils. The President may be removed by the electoral college for gross misconduct or incapacity. The Prime Minister, who is the head of government, is elected by a majority vote of a three-quarters quorum of the Parliament. The Prime Minister, in turn, appoints the Council of Ministers, whose number may not exceed a quarter of the number of parliamentary representatives. The Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers constitute the executive government. The Parliament of Vanuatu is unicameral and has 52 members,[118] who are elected by popular vote every four years unless earlier dissolved by a majority vote of a three-quarters quorum or by a directive from the President on the advice of the Prime Minister. Forty-four of these MPs are elected through Single non-transferable voting; eight are elected through single-member plurality. The national Council of Chiefs, called the Malvatu Mauri and elected by district councils of chiefs, advises the government on all matters concerning ni-Vanuatu culture and language. The Supreme Court consists of a chief justice and up to three other judges. Two or more members of this court may constitute a Court of Appeal. Magistrate courts handle most routine legal matters. The legal system is based on British common law and French civil law. The constitution also provides for the establishment of village or island courts presided over by chiefs to deal with questions of customary law.[119] Squatting occurs and the principle of adverse possession does not exist.[120] Besides national authorities and figures, Vanuatu also has high-placed people at the village level. Chiefs continue to be the leading figures at the village level. It has been reported that even politicians need to oblige them.[121] In northern Vanuatu, feasts are graded through the nimangki system. In July 2024, Minister Charlot Salwai graced the opening ceremony of the new $21 million presidential palace built by China. Hu Chunhua bestowed Vanuatu an oversized novelty golden key emblazoned with \"China Aid\". Dragon dancers and ceremonial kava brew completed the festivity.[122] Vanuatu has joined the Asian Development Bank, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the Agence de Coopération Culturelle et Technique, la Francophonie, and the Commonwealth of Nations. Vanuatu has been a member of the Forum of Small States (FOSS) since the group's founding in 1992.[123] Since 1980, Australia, the United Kingdom, France and New Zealand have provided the bulk of Vanuatu's development aid. Direct aid from the UK to Vanuatu ceased in 2005 following the decision by the UK to no longer focus on the Pacific. More recently, new donors such as the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) of the United States and the People's Republic of China have been providing increased amounts of aid funding and loans. In 2005 the MCA announced that Vanuatu was one of the first 15 countries in the world selected to receive support – an amount of US$65 million was given for the provision and upgrading of key pieces of public infrastructure. In March 2017, at the 34th regular session of the UN Human Rights Council, Vanuatu made a joint statement on behalf of some other Pacific nations raising human rights abuses in the Western New Guinea or West Papua region, which has been part of Indonesia since 1963,[124] and requested that the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights produce a report[125][126] as more than 100,000 Papuans allegedly have died during decades of Papua conflict.[127] Indonesia rejected Vanuatu's allegations.[126] In September 2017, at the 72nd Session of the UN General Assembly, the Prime Ministers of Vanuatu, Tuvalu, and the Solomon Islands once again raised human rights concerns in West Papua.[128] In 2018, newspaper reports from Australia indicated growing concern about the level of Chinese investment in Vanuatu, with over 50% of the country's debt of $440 million owed to China.[129] Concern was focused on the possibility that China would use Vanuatu's potential inability to repay debt as leverage to bargain for control of, or a People's Liberation Army presence at, Luganville Wharf. China loaned and funded the $114 million redevelopment of the wharf, which has already been constructed, with the capacity to dock naval vessels.[130] In July 2024, China built three governmental buildings, including the new presidential palace, supposedly as a free donation to Vanuatu; this has revived international concerns about the potential overreach of Chinese authorities on Vanuatu and other Pacific countries.[131] Vanuatu retains strong economic and cultural ties to Australia, the European Union (in particular France), the UK, and New Zealand. Australia now provides the bulk of external assistance, including to the police force, which has a paramilitary wing.[132] Karen Bell is the new British High Commissioner to Vanuatu. The British High Commission to Vanuatu, located in Port Vila, was reopened in the summer of 2019 as part of the UK Government's 'Pacific Uplift' strategy.[133] The British Friends of Vanuatu,[134] based in London, provides support for Vanuatu visitors to the UK, and can often offer advice and contacts to persons seeking information about Vanuatu or wishing to visit, and welcomes new members (not necessarily resident in the UK). The association's Charitable Trust funds small scale assistance in the education and training sector. In 2018, Vanuatu banned all use of plastic bags and plastic straws, with more plastic items scheduled to be banned in 2020.[135] In 2019, Vanuatu's plastic waste disposal rate was approximately 2,000 tonnes per year, with the most common items being single-use soft plastic packaging, polyethylene terephthalate water bottles, and styrofoam packaging.[136] In 2020, the government banned another seven more 'types' of items, covering cutlery, single-use plates, and artificial flowers.[137] In 2023, the governments of Vanuatu and other islands vulnerable to climate change (Fiji, Niue, the Solomon Islands, Tonga, and Tuvalu) launched the \"Port Vila Call for a Just Transition to a Fossil Fuel Free Pacific\", calling for the phase-out of fossil fuels and the 'rapid and just transition' to renewable energy and strengthening environmental law, including introducing the criminalization of ecocide.[138][139][140] There are two police wings: the Vanuatu Police Force (VPF) and the paramilitary wing, the Vanuatu Mobile Force (VMF).[141] Altogether there were 547 police officers organised into two main police commands: one in Port Vila and one in Luganville.[141] In addition to the two command stations there were four secondary police stations and eight police posts. This means that there are many islands with no police presence, and many parts of islands where getting to a police post can take several days.[142][143] There is no purely military expenditure.[144] In 2017, Vanuatu signed the UN treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.[145][146] Vanuatu has been divided into six provinces since 1994.[147][148] The names in English of all provinces are derived from the initial letters of their constituent islands: Provinces are autonomous units with their own popularly elected local parliaments known officially as provincial councils.[149] The provinces are in turn divided into municipalities (usually consisting of an individual island) headed by a council and a mayor elected from among the members of the council.[150] Vanuatu was ranked the 173rd safest investment destination in the world in the March 2011 Euromoney Country Risk rankings.[151] In 2015, Vanuatu was ranked the 84th most economically free country by The Heritage Foundation and The Wall Street Journal.[152] The economy grew about 6% in the early 2000s.[153] This is higher than in the 1990s, when GDP rose less than 3%, on average. One report from the Manila-based Asian Development Bank about Vanuatu's economy gave mixed reviews and noted that the economy grew at a 5.9% rate from 2003 to 2007.[153] Vanuatu became the 185th member of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) in December 2011.[154] Exports include copra, kava, beef, cocoa, and timber; imports include machinery and equipment, foodstuffs, and fuels. In contrast, mining activity is very low. Agriculture provides a living for 65% of the population. In particular, production of copra and kava creates substantial revenue. Many farmers have been abandoning cultivation of food crops and use earnings from kava cultivation to buy food.[121] Kava has also been used in ceremonial exchanges between clans and villages.[155] Cocoa is also grown for foreign exchange.[156] In 2007, the number of households engaged in fishing was 15,758, mainly for consumption (99%), and the average number of fishing trips was 3 per week.[157] The tropical climate enables growing of a wide range of fruits and vegetables and spices, including banana, garlic, cabbage, peanuts, pineapples, sugarcane, taro, yams, watermelons, leaf spices, carrots, radishes, eggplants, vanilla (both green and cured), pepper, cucumber, and many others.[158] In 2007, the value (in terms of millions of vatu – the official currency of Vanuatu) for agricultural products was estimated for different products: kava (341 million vatu), copra (195), cattle (135), crop gardens (93), cocoa (59), forestry (56), fishing (24), and coffee (12).[159] Raising cattle leads to beef production for export. One estimate in 2007 for the total value of cattle heads sold was 135 million vatu; cattle were first introduced into the area from Australia by British planter James Paddon.[160] On average, each household has 5 pigs and 16 chickens, and while cattle are the \"most important livestock\", pigs and chickens are important for subsistence agriculture as well as playing a significant role in ceremonies and customs (especially pigs).[161] There are 30 commercial farms (sole proprietorships (37%), partnerships (23%), corporations (17%)), with revenues of 533 million vatu and expenses of 329 million vatu in 2007.[162] The Vanuatu National Statistics Office (VNSO) released their 2007 agricultural census in 2008. According to the study, agricultural exports make up about three-quarters (73%) of all exports; 80% of the population lives in rural areas where \"agriculture is the main source of their livelihood\"; and of these households, almost all (99%) engaged in agriculture, fisheries and forestry.[163] Total annual household income was 1,803 million vatu. Of this income, agriculture grown for their own household use was valued at 683 million vatu, agriculture for sale at 561, gifts received at 38, handicrafts at 33, and fisheries (for sale) at 18.[163] Although manganese mining halted in c. 1980,[164] there was an agreement in 2006 to export manganese already mined but not yet exported.[165] The country has no known petroleum deposits. A small light-industry sector caters to the local market. Tax revenues come mainly from import duties and a 15% VAT on goods and services.[166] The country's economic development has been suspected to be hindered by dependence on relatively few commodity exports, vulnerability to natural disasters, and long distances between constituent islands and from main markets.[167] Vanuatu is one of the premier vacation destinations for scuba divers wishing to explore coral reefs of the South Pacific region.[168] Another attraction to scuba divers is the wreck of the US ocean liner and converted troop carrier SS President Coolidge on Espiritu Santo island. Sunk during World War II, it is one of the largest shipwrecks in the world that is accessible for recreational diving. Tourism increased 17% from 2007 to 2008 to reach 196,134 arrivals, according to one estimate.[169] The 2008 total is a sharp increase from 2000, in which there were only 57,000 visitors (of these, 37,000 were from Australia, 8,000 from New Zealand, 6,000 from New Caledonia, 3,000 from Europe, 1,000 from North America, and 1,000 from Japan).[170] Vanuatu sells citizenship for about $150,000. With demand from the Chinese market booming, passport sales may now account for more than 30% of the country's revenue.[171] Such schemes have been shown to raise ethical problems,[172] and have been involved in some political scandals.[68][173] On 19 July 2023, Vanuatu lost UK visa-free access due to concerns over its citizenship by investment scheme.[174] Financial services are an important part of the economy. Vanuatu is a tax haven that until 2008 did not release account information to other governments or law-enforcement agencies.[175] International pressure, mainly from Australia, influenced the Vanuatu government to begin adhering to international norms to improve transparency. In Vanuatu, there is no income tax, withholding tax, capital gains tax, inheritance tax, or exchange control.[176] Many international ship-management companies choose to flag their ships under the Vanuatu flag, because of the tax benefits and favourable labour laws (Vanuatu is a full member of the International Maritime Organization and applies its international conventions). Vanuatu is recognised as a \"flag of convenience\" country.[177] Several file-sharing groups, such as the providers of the KaZaA network of Sharman Networks and the developers of WinMX, have chosen to incorporate in Vanuatu to avoid regulation and legal challenges.[178] In response to foreign concerns, the government has promised to tighten regulation of its offshore financial centre. Vanuatu receives foreign aid mainly from Australia and New Zealand. The largest expenditure by households was food (300 million vatu), followed by household appliances and other necessities (79 million vatu), transportation (59), education and services (56), housing (50), alcohol and tobacco (39), clothing and footwear (17).[179] Exports were valued at 3,038 million vatu, and included copra (485), kava (442), cocoa (221), beef (fresh and chilled) (180), timber (80) and fish (live fish, aquarium, shell, button) (28).[180] Total imports of 20,472 million vatu included industrial materials (4,261), food and drink (3,984), machinery (3,087), consumer goods (2,767), transport equipment (2,125), fuels and lubricants (187) and other imports (4,060).[181] There are substantial numbers of crop gardens – 97,888 in 2007 – many on flat land (62%), slightly hilly slope (31%), and even on steep slopes (7%); there were 33,570 households with at least one crop garden, and of these, 10,788 households sold some of these crops over a twelve-month period.[182] Mobile phone service in the islands is provided by Vodafone (formerly TVL)[183] and Digicel. Internet access is provided by Vodafone, Telsat Broadband, Digicel, and Wantok using a variety of connection technologies. A submarine optical fibre cable now connects Vanuatu to Fiji.[184] According to the 2020 census, Vanuatu had a population of 300,019. Men outnumber women, with the population consisting of 151,597 men and 148,422 women in 2020.[185] The population is predominantly rural, but Port Vila and Luganville have tens of thousands of residents. An English coinage termed the inhabitants of Vanuatu as Ni-Vanuatu. The Ni-Vanuatu are primarily of Melanesian descent, with the remainder made up of a mix of Europeans, Asians, and other Pacific islanders.[185] The community of Vietnamese in Vanuatu comprises most of the country's Asian population. The Vietnamese community has declined from 10% of Vanuatu's population in 1929 to about 0.3% (or 1,000 individuals) in 2017.[186] In 2006[187] and 2024,[188] the New Economics Foundation and Friends of the Earth environmentalist group published the Happy Planet Index, which analysed data on levels of reported happiness, life expectancy, and ecological footprint, and they ranked Vanuatu at number one worldwide for the second time. Trade in citizenship for investment has been an increasingly significant source of revenue for Vanuatu in recent years. The sale of what is called \"honorary citizenship\" in Vanuatu has been on offer for several years under the Capital Investment Immigration Plan and more recently the Development Support Plan. People from mainland China make up the bulk of those who have purchased honorary citizenship, entitling them to a Vanuatu passport.[172] The national language of the Republic of Vanuatu is Bislama. The official languages are Bislama, English, and French. The principal languages of education are English and French. The use of English or French as the formal language is split along political lines.[189] Bislama is a creole spoken natively in urban areas. Combining a typical Melanesian grammar and phonology with an almost entirely English-derived vocabulary, Bislama is the lingua franca of the archipelago, used by the majority of the population as a second language. The growth of Bislama as a first language has considerably encroached on the indigenous languages, whose use receded from 73.1% to 63.2% of the population between 1999 and 2009.[190] In addition, 113 indigenous languages, all of which are Southern Oceanic languages except for three outlier Polynesian languages, are spoken in Vanuatu.[191] The density of languages per capita is the highest of any nation in the world,[192] with an average of only 2,000 speakers per language. All vernacular languages of Vanuatu (i.e., excluding Bislama) belong to the Oceanic branch of the Austronesian family. Christianity is the predominant religion in Vanuatu, consisting of several denominations. About one-third of the population belongs to the Presbyterian Church in Vanuatu,[193] Roman Catholic and Anglican are other common denominations, each claiming about 15% of the population. According to its 2022 facts and statistics, 3.6% of the population belongs to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, with a countrywide membership of over 11,000.[194] As of 2010, 1.4% of the people of Vanuatu are members of the Baháʼí Faith, making Vanuatu the 6th most Baháʼí country in the world.[195] The less significant groups are the Seventh-day Adventist Church, the Church of Christ,[196] Neil Thomas Ministries (NTM), Jehovah's Witnesses, and others. In 2007, Islam in Vanuatu was estimated to consist of about 200 converts.[197][198] Because of the modern goods that the military in the Second World War brought with them when they came to the islands, several cargo cults developed. Many died out, but the John Frum cult on Tanna is still large, and has adherents in the parliament.[199] Also on Tanna is the Prince Philip Movement, which reveres the United Kingdom's Prince Philip.[200] Villagers of the Yaohnanen tribe believed in an ancient story about the pale-skinned son of a mountain spirit venturing across the seas to look for a powerful woman to marry. Prince Philip, having visited the island with his new wife Queen Elizabeth II, fit the description exactly and is therefore revered as a god around the isle of Tanna.[201] After Philip died, an anthropologist familiar with the group, said that after their period of mourning the group would probably transfer their veneration to King Charles III, who had visited Vanuatu in 2018 and met with some of the tribal leaders.[202] The estimated literacy rate of people aged 15–24 years is about 74% according to UNESCO figures.[203] The rate of primary school enrolment rose from 74.5% in 1989 to 78.2% in 1999 and then to 93.0% in 2004 but then fell to 85.4% in 2007. The proportion of pupils completing a primary education fell from 90% in 1991 to 72% in 2004[204] and up to 78% in 2012. Port Vila and three other centres have campuses of the University of the South Pacific, an educational institution co-owned by twelve Pacific countries. The campus in Port Vila, known as the Emalus Campus, houses the university's law school. Vanuatu culture may be divided into three major cultural regions. In the north, wealth is established by how much one can give away through a grade-taking system. Pigs, particularly those with rounded tusks, are considered a symbol of wealth throughout Vanuatu. In the centre, more traditional Melanesian cultural systems dominate. In the south, a system involving grants of title with associated privileges has developed.[191] Young men undergo various ceremonies, usually including circumcision.[191][205] Most villages have a nakamal or village clubhouse, which serves as a meeting point for men and a place to drink kava. Villages also have male- and female-only sections. These sections are situated all over the villages; in nakamals, special spaces are provided for females when they are in their menstruation period.[191] There are few prominent Ni-Vanuatu authors. Women's rights activist Grace Mera Molisa, who died in 2002, was a descriptive poet. The traditional music of Vanuatu is still present in the rural areas of Vanuatu.[206] Musical instruments consist mostly of idiophones: drums of various shapes and sizes, slit gongs, stamping tubes, and rattles, among others. Another musical genre that has become widely popular during the 20th century in all areas of Vanuatu is known as string band music. It combines guitars, ukuleles, and popular songs. More recently, the music of Vanuatu, as an industry, grew rapidly in the 1990s, and several bands have emerged with a Ni-Vanuatu identity.[207] Popular genres of modern commercial music include zouk music and reggaeton. The cuisine of Vanuatu (aelan kakae) incorporates fish, root vegetables such as taro and yams, fruits, and vegetables. Most island families grow food in their gardens, and food shortages are rare. Papayas, pineapples, mangoes, plantains, and sweet potatoes are abundant through much of the year. Coconut milk and coconut cream are used to flavour many dishes. Most food is cooked using hot stones or through boiling and steaming; very little food is fried.[98] The national dish of Vanuatu is the laplap.[208] The most practised sport in Vanuatu is football. The top-flight league is the VFF National Super League. The Port Vila Football League is another competition. The island of Pentecost is known for its tradition of land diving, locally known as gol. The ritual consists of men land diving off a 98-foot-high wooden tower with their ankles tied to vines, as part of the annual yam harvest festival.[209][210] This local tradition is often credited to the inspiration of the modern practice of bungee jumping, which was developed in New Zealand in the 1980s.",

In 2020, 300,019 people lived in Vanuatu.[5] The capital of Vanuatu is Port Vila. The country was ruled as a colony by England and France. It got its independence in 1980.[7] During the colonial time, it was named the \"New Hebrides\" or \"Nouvelles Hebrides\". Evidence shows, that people lived in Vanuatu by 1300 BC.[8] Portuguese explorer Pedro Fernández de Quirós first discovered the islands in 1606. British explorer, navigator James Cook discovered the islands in 1774. Cook mapped the islands and named them New Hebrides.[9][8] Vanuatu is an island archipelago. It has about 82 small islands. The islands were made from volcanoes. People live on 65 of the islands. There is about 800 miles (1,300 km) north to south distance between the outermost islands. Two of the islands (Matthew and Hunter) are also claimed by France. Fourteen of Vanuatu's islands are larger than 100 square kilometres (39 sq mi). The highest point in Vanuatu is Mount Tabwemasana, at 1,879 metres (6,165 ft), on the island of Espiritu Santo. Even though it has tropical forests, Vanuatu has a small number of plant and animal species. There are no large mammals. The 19 species of native reptiles include the flowerpot snake, found only on Efate. The Fiji Banded Iguana (Brachylophus fasciatus) was introduced as a feral animal in the 1960s.[10][11] There are 11 species of bats and 61 species of land and water birds. The region is rich in sea life. There are more than 4,000 species of marine molluscs. Coneshell and stonefish carry poison that will kill humans. The giant East African land snail arrived only in the 1970s but already has spread from the Port-Vila region to Luganville. There are three or possibly four adult saltwater crocodiles living in Vanuatu's mangroves and no current breeding population.[11] It is said the crocodiles reach the northern part of the islands after cyclones. This is because of the island chain's closeness to the Solomon Islands and New Guinea, where crocodiles are very common.[12] The national dish of Vanuatu is the lap lap.[13] There are six provinces in Vanuatu. They are Malampa, Penama, Sanma, Shefa, Tafea and Torba. Some of the cities are:[14] Adele Willie is a sports commentator.",

                "content": "Our editors will review what you’ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article. Vanuatu, country in the southwestern Pacific Ocean, consisting of a chain of 13 principal and many smaller islands located about 500 miles (800 km) west of Fiji and 1,100 miles (1,770 km) east of Australia. The islands extend north-south for some 400 miles (650 km) in an irregular Y shape. The Torres Islands are the northernmost group. Southward from the Torres group, the main islands are Vanua Lava and Santa Maria (Gaua) in the Banks Islands group, Espiritu Santo, Aoba (Ambae), Maéwo, Pentecost, Malakula, Ambrym, Épi, Éfaté, Erromango, Tanna, and Anatom. Some 200 miles (320 km) to the southeast of Anatom, two uninhabited islands, Hunter and Matthew, are claimed by both Vanuatu and France (as part of New Caledonia). Formerly the jointly administered Anglo-French condominium of the New Hebrides, Vanuatu achieved independence in 1980. The name Vanuatu means “Our Land Forever” in many of the locally used Melanesian languages. The capital, largest city, and commercial centre is Port-Vila (Vila), on Éfaté. A diverse relief—ranging from rugged mountains and high plateaus to rolling hills and low plateaus, with coastal terraces and offshore coral reefs—characterizes the islands. Sedimentary and coral limestones and volcanic rock predominate; frequent earthquakes indicate structural instability. Active volcanoes are found on several islands, including Séré’ama on Vanua Lava, Manaro on Aoba, Garet on Santa Maria, the twin volcanic vents of Benbow and Marum on Ambrym, and Yasur on Tanna. There are also several submarine volcanoes in the group, and some islands have solfataras or fumaroles. The highest point is Tabwémasana, 6,165 feet (1,879 metres), on Espiritu Santo, the largest island. There are two seasons—hot and wet from November to April, and cooler and drier from May to October. The southeast trades are the prevailing winds, although northerlies during the hot season provide most of the heavy rainfall. Annual precipitation varies from about 80 inches (2,000 mm) in the south to some 160 inches (4,000 mm) in the northern islands. Much of the group is covered by dense rain forest, but drier regions have patches of savanna grassland. Abundant bird and insect life contrasts with the sparse fauna. Of the approximately 10 types of bats found in Vanuatu, three are found only there. Vanuatu is also home to the estuarine crocodile. The indigenous population, called ni-Vanuatu, is overwhelmingly Melanesian, though some of the outlying islands have Polynesian populations. There are also small minorities of Europeans, Micronesians, Chinese, and Vietnamese. Roughly three-fourths of the population lives in rural areas, but since independence the urban centres of Luganville and Port-Vila have drawn a significant number of people attracted by better opportunities. More than 100 local Melanesian languages and dialects are spoken; Bislama, an English-based Melanesian pidgin, is the national language and, along with English and French, is one of three official languages. Some seven-tenths of the population is Protestant, Presbyterians constituting the largest denomination. Other religions include Roman Catholicism, traditional beliefs, and cargo cults. Subsistence agriculture has traditionally been the economic base of Vanuatu, together with an elaborate exchange network within and between islands. Economic changes occurred with the development of European plantations in the island group after 1867: cotton was the initial crop, followed by corn (maize), coffee, cocoa beans, and coconuts (for copra). Cattle ranching was instituted later. By the 1880s French planters had reversed the initial British domination of the plantation sector, though they too found it increasingly difficult to compete with ni-Vanuatu producers, who could fall back on subsistence agriculture in times of economic downturn. French hopes of economic hegemony, based on high world prices for copra and the importation of Vietnamese labour in the 1920s, were dashed by the Great Depression of the 1930s. By 1948 most of the copra in the island group was being produced by the ni-Vanuatu themselves, though it was not until the development of cooperatives in the 1970s that they were finally able to assume control of the trade. Kava, beef, copra, timber, and cocoa are the most important exports; Australia, New Caledonia, Japan, and New Zealand are the main export destinations. Imports—mainly of machinery and transport equipment, food and live animals, and mineral fuels—come principally from Australia, Singapore, New Zealand, and Fiji. Because of its vulnerability to weather and commodity market fluctuations, Vanuatu is working toward supplementing large-scale agriculture with stronger extractive, manufacturing, and service sectors to foster its long-term economic growth. Since independence, Vanuatu’s tourism and offshore financial services have emerged as the largest earners of foreign income. The growing lucre generated by tourism has attracted the attention of foreign companies seeking to develop land into resorts and other attractions. Although, according to the 1980 constitution, all land in Vanuatu is under ni-Vanuatu customary collective ownership and cannot be sold to foreigners, increasing interest from abroad in the late 20th and early 21st centuries prompted the government to allow land to be leased for 75-year periods. Such leases were often negotiated to the disadvantage of ni-Vanuatu, however; many included, for example, a provision that, at the end of the 75 years, the customary owners could regain their lands only by paying in full the cost of any development. In the early 21st century there was concern that such provisions would mean the permanent alienation of customarily owned lands. Forestry, important in the islands’ early colonial history but later eclipsed by plantation agriculture, has also grown in importance. Much of the country is forested (including areas of sandalwood and other valuable tropical species). Because the majority of trees felled during the 1980s were exported as unsawn logs, in the early 1990s the government banned exports of roundwood and limited the annual harvest. Earnings from processed wood (mostly sawn on small portable mills) grew as a result, and wood products accounted for a small but significant proportion of exports in the early 21st century. The sale of commercial fishing rights is another important source of foreign revenue, and there is extensive small-scale fishing for local consumption. Mining of manganese ore on Éfaté ended in the 1970s, but later surveys identified a number of remaining deposits there as well as the likely existence of exploitable gold, copper, and petroleum reserves elsewhere in the islands. On most of Vanuatu’s islands, unpaved roads link coastal settlements; there are few interior roads. Interisland transportation is by boat or airplane. Major airports are located near Port-Vila, near Luganville on Espiritu Santo, and on the northwest side of Tanna. Many smaller airfields are scattered throughout the islands.",

                "content": "The embattled boss of Swedish fashion brand Djerf Avenue has apologised again after claims she mistreated staff, blaming her lack of leadership experience as the firm's growth exploded. \"I wasn't ready,\" Matilda Djerf wrote in a post on Instagram, days after a report in Swedish news outlet Aftonbladet sparked backlash against the brand. In the message, the 27-year-old said the firm was working to improve its work culture, which included hiring managers with more experience and introducing monthly anonymous surveys of staff. Ms Djerf, who started her online influencer career in 2016, said she was committed to \"getting it right\". \"When I started Djerf Avenue I never expected that the company would be what it is today, with so many team members and so much responsibility,\" she wrote. \"I'll keep learning and working to ensure Djerf Avenue is a safe, inclusive space for everyone.\" Launched in 2019, Djerf Avenue rapidly gained a following among young women for wardrobe staples such as oversize button-down shirts and trousers. The brand, which reported around $35m (£27.5m) in revenue last year, is known for its size inclusivity and diverse model representation. But it has been facing outcry from customers after Aftonbladet reported claims bullying and body-shaming. It said that some models were told they did not fill out a pair of jeans, while others were called fat. Djerf Avenue recently held its first 10-day pop-up shop in London, which saw queues forming up to three hours before the store opened. Journalism student Evie Summers, who attended the pop-up to write a report, said the allegations against Ms Djerf were \"incredibly disappointing and discouraging to the young, impressionable people who adore her\". She said the apology was the only route available to Ms Djerf, who has won a following not just for her designs, but for her \"lifestyle and values\". \"With this in mind, it's especially important for her to reflect the brand values of kindness and inclusivity towards her staff,\" the 19-year-old said. In her message, Ms Djerf said she hoped to rebuild trust with her fans. \"I had never built a company prior to this, and under a lot of stress, high tempo and naivety I failed to be the leader and colleague I wish to be along the way,\" she added. London resident Samantha Rogers said the controversy was a reminder that brands had to live by their values. \"I'm definitely sad about what's happened, but I also think it's great that brands are being called out when they don't stick to the values they promote,\" the 32-year-old told the BBC. \"If your brand doesn't feel real, it won't stand the test of time.\" Officers tackle shoplifting in Exeter as reports of the retail crime increase.

AFT reported that the problems in the workplace were \"well-known\" to HR and management, according to their sources, yet \"nothing improved.\" One employee, Tove, said when they spoke to HR and the CEO (who is Djerf's boyfriend), they allegedly told them, \"It had always been like that\" and \"That's just the way it is.\" They reportedly said, \"'What do you want us to do?

                "content": "Manage your account Matilda Djerf, a Swedish influencer and co-founder of the popular fashion brand Djerf Avenue, has responded to accusations that she created a climate of “psychological terror” in her workplace. Djerf, 27, a Forbes 30 under 30 honouree, is alleged to have regularly yelled at her employees, forced one to scrub her personal toilet, and made fatphobic comments. In a statement shared on Instagram on Tuesday (December 17), Djerf addressed the claims with an apology and a reflection on her role as a leader. “Over the past few days, I’ve been quiet on social media,” the fashion influencer wrote. “My highest priority has been to meet with the Djerf Avenue team and speak to them. I am fully aware that my words here are not an answer or a solution, but for me it’s important to write this directly to you.” Acknowledging her shortcomings, Djerf admitted to feeling unprepared for the rapid growth of her company. “When I started Djerf Avenue, I never expected that the company would be what it is today… I wasn’t ready. I had never led a team prior to this, I had never built a company prior to this, and under a lot of stress, high tempo, and naivety, I failed to be the leader and colleague I wish to be. And for that, I am so, so sorry.” Djerf emphasized her commitment to personal and professional growth, stating, “I wish my growth happened faster. I want to underline that I’m extremely committed to getting it right and to continuing growing.” Concluding her statement, Djerf pledged to prioritize growth and accountability moving forward. “I’m committed and want to focus my all on becoming the best leader and colleague I can be. I’ll keep learning and working to ensure Djerf Avenue is a safe, inclusive space for everyone. I want to end by saying thank you to all of you who’ve had honest and transparent conversations with me over the past few days.” Djerf Avenue, known for its minimalist Scandinavian designs, has grown rapidly since its launch in 2019. However, former employees told Aftonbladet about alleged toxic behavior behind the scenes. “She could yell at you in front of the whole office, I was scared every day that I would get a scolding,” said one of the eleven staff members who came forward. “I’ve probably never been so scared of a person in my life,” said another, as staff reported “crying every day”, having “panic attacks” and “hyperventilating.” “A recurring stress is what many describe as a favouritism culture, where you are moved up and down in the hierarchy,” said the report. This included her personal bathroom, which only Djerf’s “favourite” employees were allowed to use. When one staff member used the room by mistake, another employee was reportedly forced to scrub the toilet clean before Djerf could use it again. In a statement shared with The Independent, the influencer initially said she didn’t “recognize myself in these claims.” She said, “I want to emphasise that I take responsibility and see this as an opportunity to reflect, develop, and contribute to a better culture for all employees at Djerf Avenue. I will actively work on my leadership, including continuing to seek support from a coach.”",

                "content": "On Tuesday, Matilda Djerf has apologized publicly after several former employees accused her of bullying and creating a hostile work environment, saying she had “failed” as a leader and colleague. “When I started Djerf Avenue I never expected that the company would be what it is today, with so many team members and so much responsibility. I wasn’t ready,” she wrote in part on Instagram. “I had never led a team prior to this, I had never built a company prior to this, and under a lot of stress, high tempo and naivety I failed to be the leader and colleague I wish to be along the way. As for that, I am so, so sorry.\" Matilda Djerf has created an empire off her personal brand of effortless, chic, Scandinavian cool. But according to anonymous former employees in her native Sweden, her demeanor is anything but chill. The former fashion blogger turned influencer turned entrepreneur has been accused of enacting a reign of “psychological terror” as the leader of her fashion line Djerf Avenue—bullying employees, calling a plus-size model “fat,” and once allegedly demanding an employee clean her personal toilet. The bombshell report in Sweden’s newspaper Aftonbladet is slowly making its way to English-speaking social media, where fans are flooding her accounts with questions and criticism. In response Djerf told the paper she felt “truly sorry” and apologized for any instance where a worker felt mistreated. Here’s everything you need to know, in this edition of TL;DR. Lifestyle, beauty, and fashion influencer Matilda Djerf has been accused by a group of former employees at her company Djerf Avenue of creating a toxic work environment. Matilda Djerf, 27, is a Swedish influencer with more than 4.5 million followers across TikTok and Instagram. She’s perhaps best known for her Scandinavian cool-girl aesthetic, minimalist and chic fashion, and bouncy blonde hair, the style of which—the butterfly cut—she’s credited with popularizing. In 2019, Djerf founded her fashion line Djerf Avenue along with her boyfriend, Rasmus Johansson, according to The New York Times. The brand sells clothing staples in muted colors as well as hair products, homewares, and more, and ships worldwide. A brand image of Matilda Djerf from a recent Djerf Avenue launch. It has had pop-up stores in places like Stockholm, London, and New York. Djerf also frequently collaborates with other brands, such as a recent limited-edition lip treatment created with Hailey Bieber’s Rhode. A bombshell report in Sweden’s Aftonbladet has allegations from 11 former and current Djerf Avenue employees of mistreatment and bullying. The report and the accompanying video—which features the accusers telling their stories in shadow—are all in Swedish, but according to an online translation, Djerf has been accused of bullying, favoritism, creating a toxic work environment, being fatphobic, and more. In one bizarre allegation, an employee claimed to the newspaper that Djerf designated a toilet in the office for the use of just herself and her “favorite” employees, putting a sign on the door reading “Please do not use!” in English. When the sign fell down, the newspaper alleges, an employee was made to scrub the toilet because it had been used by an unapproved person. Djerf herself and Pernilla Bonny, a spokesperson for the company, responded to the allegations in detail, including the toilet claim. When asked if it was “reasonable” that an employee who was not a cleaner should have had to scrub the toilet, Bonny said “obviously” it was not and they would work to rectify the situation. Bonny defended the right of Djerf to have her own toilet in order to “stay healthy” but said the use of it by “favorites” would end. Others accused Djerf of swearing and acting condescending to her employees, creating an environment full of “terror” in which employees regularly broke down in tears. “I have never been so afraid of a person in my entire life,” said one, according to a rough translation. Another recounted an alleged instance where Djerf saw photographs of a plus-size model and claimed she didn’t want to use them because the woman looked “so fat.” In response to claims that the company’s stated values of inclusivity didn’t match reality, Bonny told the paper that “If there are employees who feel that we do not live up to our values, it is obviously something we have to work even harder on.” In her own statement, Djerf said she doesn’t recognize herself in some of the allegations made but apologized to any employee who felt mistreated. “I take the criticism that has come forward very seriously and want to be clear that a safe and respectful work environment is crucial for me, both as a person and as the founder of Djerf Avenue,” she said, according to a rough translation. “If any staff member has felt mistreated or ill-equipped in their role due to my actions, that is something I am truly sorry for and apologize for. It was never my intention to contribute to a work environment that negatively affects anyone and I am sorry that there are employees who have had such experiences.” Fans are understandably pissed. On both Djerf’s personal social media accounts and ones for the brand, people are leaving comments in both English and Swedish about how disappointed they were to hear the allegations. In a follow-up story, a reporter for Aftonbladet said that many followers were saying they would boycott the brand over her alleged behavior. However, another Swedish woman founder, Cecilia Blankens, weighed in to defend Djerf, saying that a male CEO wouldn’t face the same scrutiny, according to the paper. It’s hard to say whether the allegations will be a but blip in Djerf’s career and reputation, or if it will have an impact on her brand.

                "content": "Karate Kid: Legends is an upcoming American martial arts drama film directed by Jonathan Entwistle and written by Rob Lieber. It is the sixth film in The Karate Kid franchise following The Karate Kid (2010), and stars Jackie Chan and Ralph Macchio, both reprising their roles from previous films, with Ben Wang as the main lead alongside Joshua Jackson, Sadie Stanley, and Ming-Na Wen. It is the first film in the series not to be produced by Jerry Weintraub, who died in 2015.[1][2] The film was confirmed to be in development in September 2022, with Entwistle set to direct and Lieber set to write the screenplay in November 2023. It serves as a sequel to the original films of the franchise starring Macchio and the 2010 film starring Chan. Casting took place from November 2023 to April 2024. Filming took place from April to June 2024. Karate Kid: Legends is scheduled to be released in the United States and Canada on May 30, 2025, by Sony Pictures Releasing. Additionally, Sadie Stanley, Ming-Na Wen, Aramis Knight, Wyatt Oleff, Danny McBride, and Jennifer-Lyn Christie have been cast in undisclosed roles. The Karate Kid (1984), starring Ralph Macchio as Daniel LaRusso, was followed by three sequels: The Karate Kid Part II (1986), The Karate Kid Part III (1989), and The Next Karate Kid (1994), although Macchio did not return for the fourth film. A remake of the first film was released in 2010, with a similar storyline but with a different set of characters, including Jackie Chan as Mr. Han. Despite maintaining the original title, the remake focused on kung fu, as the film was set in China. A television series, Cobra Kai, premiered in 2018. A sequel to the 2010 remake was announced shortly after its release with Jaden Smith, Taraji P. Henson, and Chan set to reprise their roles. Breck Eisner was tapped to direct in April 2014.[3] By then, two drafts of the screenplay had been written by writing duo Ethan Reiff and Cyrus Voris as well as Zak Penn. Eisner left the project three months later and a new screenplay by Jeremiah Friedman and Nick Palmer was commissioned.[4] In April 2017, Eisner returned to the project[5] but by October, Chan expressed dissatisfaction with the film's script.[6] In September 2022, a new feature film was confirmed to be in development, being described as \"the return of the original Karate Kid franchise\".[7][8] In November 2023, it was reported that Jonathan Entwistle was set to direct the film, with a screenplay written by Rob Lieber and with Karen Rosenfelt serving as the producer.[9] In August 2023, Chan was reported to be reprising his role in the film. In late November 2023, Chan and Macchio were officially revealed to have joined the cast. The announcement confirms that the original films, the remake, and the Cobra Kai series all take place in the same universe.[10] In addition, Chan and Macchio announced a world-wide open casting call for an actor to star as the film's iteration of the titular character, described as a Chinese teen who moves to the East Coast and begins studying martial arts.[10] In February 2024, Ben Wang was cast as the titular character, Li Fong.[11] In March, Joshua Jackson, Sadie Stanley, and Ming-Na Wen were cast in undisclosed roles.[12][13][14] In April, Aramis Knight and Wyatt Oleff joined the cast.[15] Principal photography began in Montreal on April 1, 2024, and wrapped filming on June 3,[16] under the working title Victory Boulevard.[10][17] Dominic Lewis was hired to compose the score by December 2024.[18] Karate Kid: Legends is scheduled to be released on May 30, 2025 in the United States and Canada.[19] The film was originally set to be released on June 7, 2024,[7][8] but due to the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike, it was delayed to December 13, 2024.[20] It was moved once more to May 2025 to avoid conflict with the final season of Cobra Kai.[21]",

The Tar Heels have won six NCAA championships (1957, 1982, 1993, 2005, 2009, and 2017) in addition to a 1924 Helms Athletic Foundation title (retroactive). North Carolina has won a record 133 NCAA tournament matchups while advancing to 31 Sweet Sixteen berths (since 1975), a record 21 Final Fours, and 12 title games. It is the only school to have an active streak of reaching the National Championship game for nine straight decades (no other school has done it in more than six straight) and at least two Final Fours for six straight decades, all while averaging more wins per season played (20.7) than any other program in college basketball. In 2012, ESPN ranked North Carolina No. 1 on its list of the 50 most successful programs of the past fifty years. North Carolina's six national championships are third-most all-time, behind UCLA (11) and Kentucky (8). UNC has also won eighteen Atlantic Coast Conference tournament (ACC) titles,[2] and thirty-three ACC regular season titles.[3] The program has produced many notable players who went on to play in the NBA, including four of ESPN's top 74 players of all-time: Michael Jordan, James Worthy, Vince Carter, and Bob McAdoo (tied for most with UCLA).[4] Many Tar Heel assistant coaches and players have gone on to become head coaches elsewhere.[5] From the Tar Heels' first season in 1910–11 through the start of the 2021–22 season, the program has amassed a .735 all-time winning percentage (second highest all-time), winning 2,294 games and losing 829 games in 111-plus seasons.[6][7][8] The Tar Heels also have the most consecutive 20-win seasons, with 31 from the 1970–71 season through the 2000–01 season.[9] On March 2, 2010, North Carolina became the second college basketball program to reach 2,000 wins in its history. The Tar Heels are currently 3rd all-time in wins. The Tar Heels are one of only four Division I men's basketball programs to have achieved 2,000 victories. Kentucky, Kansas, and Duke are the other three. Carolina has played 182 games in the NCAA Tournament. The Tar Heels have appeared in the NCAA Tournament championship game twelve times, and have been in a record 21 NCAA Tournament Final Fours.[10] The Tar Heels have been selected to the NCAA Tournament 53 times (second-most all-time),[11][12] and have amassed 133 victories (most all-time).[11][12] North Carolina won the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) in 1971,[2] and has appeared in two NIT Finals with six appearances in the NIT Tournament.[2] Additionally, the team has been the No. 1 seed in the NCAA tournament eighteen times, the latest being in 2024 (most No. 1 seeds all-time). North Carolina has been ranked in the top 25 of the AP Poll an all-time record 927 weeks,[13] has beaten AP No. 1 ranked teams 14 times,[14] has the most 25-win seasons with 38,[15] and has the most consecutive top-three ACC regular season finishes with 37.[16] North Carolina has ended the season ranked in the top 25 of the AP Poll 51 times and in the top 25 of the Coaches' Poll 53 times.[15] Furthermore, the Tar Heels have finished the season ranked No. 1 in the AP Poll six times and ranked No. 1 in Coaches' Poll seven times.[15] In 2008, the Tar Heels received the first unanimous preseason No. 1 ranking in the history of either the Coaches' Poll or the AP Poll.[17][18] North Carolina played its first game on January 27, 1911, beating Virginia Christian 42–21 at Bynum Gymnasium, the team's home from 1911 to 1923.[14] The team's first coach was Nat Cartmell. Cartmell was charged with illegally playing dice with known gamblers and was fired after the 1913–14 season. He would be replaced by Charles Doak.[19] In the 1914–15 season, UNC joined the SAIAA, and would compete in the conference through the 1920–21 season.[15] The 1917–18 team went 9–3 (7–0 at home) to finish 3rd in the SAIAA. On January 24, 1920, North Carolina beat Trinity College (Duke), 36–25, in the first-ever game of the Carolina-Duke rivalry.[15] In 1921, the school joined the Southern Conference.[20] Overall, the Tar Heels played 32 seasons in the Southern Conference from 1921 to 1953. During that period, they won 304 games and lost 111 for a winning percentage of 73.3%. The Tar Heels won the Southern Conference regular season title 9 times and the Southern Conference tournament 8 times. In 1924, the Tar Heels moved to the Tin Can for home games. From 1924 to 1938, UNC would go 130–20 (.867 winning percentage) at the Tin Can. Rudimentarily built of steel, attempts to heat the Tin Can failed, with ice often forming inside: The Tin Can was always freezing [...] they had icicles in the corners. To stay warm the electricians put those big-wattage bulbs under the benches, and we had blankets and wore heavy sweat clothes. Later on they did get central heat in there, but it was never adequate. You couldn't dress there. On February 29, 1924, UNC beat Kentucky, 41–20, in the first-ever game of the Kentucky–North Carolina rivalry. The 1923–24 Tar Heels squad went 26–0, and was awarded a national championship by the Helms Athletic Foundation in 1943 and later by the Premo-Porretta Power Poll.[21][22] In North Carolina's first five seasons in the SoCon (from 1921–22 to 1925–26), they went 96–17, won four SoCon regular season championships, and four SoCon tournament championships.[15] Their fast style of play and stingy defense earned these teams the nickname \"White Phantoms\", coined by sportswriter Oscar Bane Keeler of The Atlanta Journal,[23] used as an alternative nickname for the Tar Heels through 1950.[24] Cartwright Carmichael was the first Tar Heel to earn first-team All-America honors in any sport in 1923, and was again selected in 1924. Jack Cobb was UNC's first three-time All-America (1924, 1925, 1926), and was named Helms Foundation Player of the Year in 1926. George Glamack followed suit in 1940 and 1941, being named Helms Foundation Player of the Year also. Both Cobb and Glamack are honored with their numbers being retired (Cobb did not have a number).[15] In 1939, the Tar Heels relocated their home arena to the Woollen Gymnasium, where they would play until 1965. On March 21, 1946, under Hall of Fame coach Ben Carnevale and All-Americans Hook Dillon and Jim Jordan, North Carolina beat NYU, 57–49, for their first win in the NCAA Tournament ever. Later in the 1946 NCAA tournament, UNC advanced to their first ever Final Four, losing to Oklahoma A&M, 43–40, in the championship game.[15] For most of the first four decades of the program's history, North Carolina had very little consistency at the head coaching position, reflecting the lack of emphasis on the sport in much of the South at the time. The first coach, Cartmell, doubled as the track coach. From 1923 to 1926, three coaches led the program in as many years. Norman Shepard led the team to an undefeated season in 1923–24 while attending law school. He was succeeded by one of his players, medical student Monk McDonald, who in turn gave way to Harlan Sanborn. Other early coaches included baseball coaches Charles Doak and James Ashmore and assistant football coach Bill Lange. All told, from 1910 to 1946, no coach stayed in Chapel Hill longer than five years. Carnevale, who led UNC to its first Final Four, left after only two years. Tom Scott ran the program for six years from 1946 to 1952, but was pushed out in favor of Frank McGuire after two consecutive losing years. The modern era of Tar Heel basketball began in 1952, when Scott was pushed out after two consecutive losing seasons in favor of St. John's head coach Frank McGuire. School officials wanted a big-name coach to counter the rise of North Carolina State under Everett Case. On December 1, 1952, McGuire coached his first game at UNC with a 70–50 win over The Citadel.[15] In 1953, North Carolina split from the Southern Conference and became a founding member of the Atlantic Coast Conference.[25] On December 12, 1953, UNC beat South Carolina, 82–56, in their first ACC game ever. On December 14, 1955, UNC routed then-No. 5 Alabama 99–77. It was UNC's first defeat of a nonconference opponent ranked in the top 10 of a major media poll. On January 14, 1956, All-American Lennie Rosenbluth scored 45 points in a 103–99 win at Clemson. On February 24, 1956, Rosenbluth had 31 points in a 73–65 win over Duke to clinch UNC's first-ever ACC regular-season title (shared with N.C. State). The following season, in 1956–57, Lennie Rosenbluth scored 40 in a Tar Heel win at Duke to finish with a perfect 24–0 regular season record (14–0 in ACC). Rosenbluth was named 1957 Helms Foundation Player of the Year. Furthermore, in 1957, the Tar Heels won their first ACC Tournament and first NCAA Championship. On March 23, 1957, No. 1 North Carolina beat Wilt Chamberlain and No. 2 Kansas, 54–53, in triple overtime as Carolina capped off a perfect 32–0 season as national champions.[15] C.D. Chesley, a Washington, D.C. television producer, piped the 1957 championship game in Kansas City to a hastily created network of five stations across North Carolina—the ancestor to the longstanding syndicated ACC football and basketball package from Raycom Sports—which helped prove pivotal in basketball becoming a craze in the state.[26] The title game was the only triple overtime final game in championship history,[27] which followed a triple overtime North Carolina defeat of Michigan State 74–70 the previous night. In 1961, the Tar Heels were placed on NCAA probation for a year for violating \"provisions prohibiting excessive entertainment\" of prospective players and providing \"improper financial assistance\" to the parents of players. As a result, they were barred from the 1961 NCAA tournament[28] and also withdrew from the 1961 ACC tournament. Following the season, Chancellor William Aycock forced McGuire to resign. As a replacement, Aycock selected one of McGuire's assistants, Kansas alumnus Dean Smith. On December 2, 1961, Carolina beat Virginia, 80–46, in Dean Smith's first game as head coach.[15] Smith's early teams were not nearly as successful as McGuire's had been. His first team went only 8–9, the last losing season UNC would suffer for 40 years.[29] On January 13, 1964, All-American Deakon Patrick scored 40 and had 28 rebounds in 97–88 win over Maryland.[15] On December 4, 1965, UNC beat William and Mary, 82–68, in the first game played at UNC's new home, Carmichael Auditorium. On December 16, 1965, Bobby Lewis scored a current UNC-record 49 points in a 115–80 win over Florida State.[15] Smith's first five teams never won more than 16 games. This grated on a fan base used to winning; in 1965 some of them even hanged him in effigy. Smith would go on to take the Tar Heels to a reign of championships and national dominance.[29] On March 17, 1967, North Carolina beat Princeton for Dean Smith's first NCAA Tournament win. Later, in the 1967 NCAA tournament, UNC beat Boston College to advance to Dean Smith's first Final Four, where they would lose to Dayton in the national semifinal. In 1968, Carolina appeared in their second consecutive Final Four. On March 23, 1968, they lost to Lew Alcindor and UCLA for the national title. On March 15, 1969, All-American Charlie Scott hit the game-winning jumper at the buzzer to beat Davidson, 87–85, to advance North Carolina to their third consecutive Final Four. On March 27, 1971, Bill Chamberlain scored 34 points as UNC beat Georgia Tech, 84–66, to win the NIT. On March 18, 1972, Carolina beat Penn, 73–59, to advance to their 4th Final Four in 6 years. All-American Bob McAdoo had 24 points and 15 rebounds, but fouled out with 13 minutes to play, as UNC lost to Florida State in the national semifinal. On March 26, 1977, the Tar Heels, back in the Final Four, edged UNLV, 84–83, in the national semifinal. Carolina, in the championship two days later, lost to Marquette, 67–59. On February 25, 1978, co-consensus National Player of the Year Phil Ford scored 34 points in his final game at Carmichael Auditorium, an 87–83 win over Duke. North Carolina returned to the Final Four in 1981. In the national semifinal, All-American Al Wood scored 39 in a win over Virginia. UNC would lose in the NCAA championship game to Indiana. The following year, North Carolina won their second NCAA championship. On March 29, 1982, Final Four MOP James Worthy scored 28 points and Michael Jordan hit the game-winning shot with 17 seconds to play as Carolina beat Georgetown, 63–62, to win Dean Smith's first national championship. On January 18, 1986, North Carolina beat Duke, 95–92, in the first game played in UNC's new arena, the Dean Smith Center. On March 24, 1991, Carolina beat Temple, 75–72, to advance to the Final Four for the first time since 1982. In the national semifinal, Carolina fell to former UNC assistant coach Roy Williams and Kansas, 79–73. In 1993, UNC won their third NCAA title. On April 5, 1993, Final Four MOP Donald Williams scored 25 points as Carolina beat Michigan, 77–71, for Dean Smith's second NCAA championship. On March 25, 1995, North Carolina beat Kentucky, 74–61, to advance to another Final Four. UNC would fall to Arkansas in the national semifinal. On March 15, 1997, North Carolina beat Colorado, 73–56, in the NCAA tournament second round for Dean Smith's 877th win, breaking Adolph Rupp's all-time record for coaches. On March 23, 1997, the Tar Heels beat Louisville, 97–74, for another Final Four appearance. Smith would coach his final game, a 66–58 loss to Arizona in the national semifinal, on March 29, 1997. After 36 years as head coach, Smith retired on October 9, 1997.[15] When he retired, Smith's 879 wins were the most ever for any NCAA Division I men's basketball coach (currently 5th all-time).[30] During his tenure, North Carolina won or shared 17 ACC regular-season titles and won 13 ACC tournaments. They went to the NCAA tournament 27 times–including 23 in a row from 1975 to 1997–appeared in 11 Final Fours and won NCAA tournament titles in 1982 and 1993. The 1982 national championship team was led by James Worthy, Sam Perkins, and a young Michael Jordan.[31] The 1993 national championship team starred Donald Williams, George Lynch and Eric Montross.[32] While at North Carolina, Smith helped promote desegregation by recruiting the university's first African American scholarship basketball player, Charlie Scott.[33] Smith unexpectedly retired before the start of practice for the 1997–98 season. He was succeeded by Bill Guthridge, who had been an assistant coach at the school for 30 years, the last 25 as Smith's top assistant. During Guthridge's three seasons as head coach, he posted an 80–28 record, making him tied for the then-NCAA record for most wins by a coach after three seasons.[34] The Tar Heels reached the NCAA Final Four twice, in the 1998 tournament and again in the 2000 tournament. North Carolina reached the Final Four in 2000 as an 8-seed, their lowest seeding in a Final Four appearance.[35] Guthridge retired in 2000 and North Carolina turned to Matt Doherty, the head coach at Notre Dame and a player on the 1982 championship team, to lead the Tar Heels.[36] Doherty had little success while at North Carolina. In his first season, the Heels were ranked No. 1 in the polls in the middle of the Atlantic Coast Conference schedule and finished with a 26–7 record. The bottom fell out the following year, as the Tar Heels finished the season with a record of 8–20, the worst season in school history. They missed postseason play entirely for the first time since the 1965–66 season (including a record 27 straight NCAA Tournament appearances) and finished with a losing record for the first time since 1962 (Dean Smith's first year as coach). They also finished 4–12 in the ACC—only the program's second losing ACC record ever. The 12 losses were six more than the Tar Heels had ever suffered in a single season of ACC play and placed them in a tie for 7th place—the program's first finish below fourth place ever. The season also saw the end of UNC's run of 31 straight 20-win seasons and 35 straight seasons of finishing third or higher in the ACC. After bringing in one of the top 5 incoming classes for the 2002–2003 season, the Tar Heels started the season by knocking off a top 5 Kansas team and going on to win the Preseason NIT and returning to the AP top 25. North Carolina went on to finish the season 17–15, but a 6–10 record in ACC play kept them out of the NCAA Tournament. Doherty led the Tar Heels to the third round of the NIT, where they ended their season with a loss to Georgetown. Despite the turnaround from the year before and the NIT appearance, at the end of the season Matt Doherty was replaced as head coach by Roy Williams. Williams had served as an assistant to Smith for 11 years before a successful 15-year tenure at Kansas, winning 9 conference regular season championships and taking his Jayhawk teams to four Final Fours. Smith himself convinced Williams to return home. Williams had also been courted by Smith for the UNC job when it had been open in 2000, but Williams had promised Nick Collison he would be at Kansas his entire college career and could not bring himself to leave Kansas at that time despite media speculation reporting Williams would take the job in 2000. Williams could not turn his mentor down a second time, so just two weeks after Doherty's resignation, Williams took the Carolina job. Williams was UNC's third coach in six years, the most turnover the program had faced since its early years. The previous two, McGuire and Smith, had covered a 45-year period. On November 22, 2003, Carolina beat Old Dominion, 90–64, in Roy Williams’ first game as head coach. In Williams' first season, the Tar Heels finished 19–11 and were ranked in a final media poll for the first time in three years. They returned to the NCAA tournament and were ousted in the second round by Texas. The following year, on April 4, 2005, the Tar Heels defeated Illinois, 75–70, to win their fourth NCAA title and Williams' first as a head coach.[37] After winning the championship, Williams lost his top seven scorers, but the 2005–06 season saw the arrival of freshman Tyler Hansbrough and Williams was named Coach of the Year. The Tar Heels swept the ACC regular season and tournament titles in 2007 and 2008. The 2008 ACC tournament was the first time North Carolina had ever won the ACC Tournament without defeating at least one in-state rival during the tournament.[38] North Carolina lost in the national semifinals of the 2008 NCAA tournament to Williams' former program Kansas. On December 18, 2008, Tyler Hansbrough scored his 2,292nd career point, breaking Phil Ford's UNC career scoring record. In the 2008–09 season, the Tar Heels won their fifth NCAA title by defeating Michigan State in the championship of the 2009 NCAA men's basketball tournament.[39] The Tar Heels won all six of that year's tournament games by at least 12 points, for an average victory margin of 20.2 points, and only trailed for a total of 10 minutes out of 240 through the entire tournament.[40] Wayne Ellington was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player, the fourth Tar Heel so honored. The 2009–2010 Tar Heels struggled throughout the regular season finishing with a 16–15 record,[41] and dropped to No. 3 in Division I in all-time wins. They later lost in the first round of the ACC Tournament, playing in the first \"play-in\" Thursday game for the first time since the ACC grew to 12 teams. The Tar Heels did not receive an NCAA tournament bid, and instead accepted a bid to the NIT.[42] During the season, on March 2, 2010, Carolina beat Miami, 69–62, to become the second school in NCAA history to win its 2,000th game (North Carolina was in its 100th season of basketball at the time of this accomplishment). The Tar Heels made it to the final game of the NIT, losing to Dayton in the final game finishing with a 20–17 record. The 2010–2011 Tar Heels, with the addition of Harrison Barnes, Kendall Marshall, and Reggie Bullock, eighth in the preseason polls, struggled out the gates, starting with a 2–2 record, the worst start since the 2001–02 season. After losses to Illinois and Texas, the Tar Heels fell out of the rankings. The losses of senior Will Graves, to dismissal, and Larry Drew II, to transfer and also the unexpected off-season transfers of David and Travis Wear did not help matters. However, the Tar Heels improved greatly during the conference season, finishing first in the ACC regular season with a 14–2 record. Williams was named Conference Coach of the Year for his efforts of getting his team to work through the adversity to finish strong in the regular season.[43] Also during the season, the term Tar Heel Blue Steel was coined, referencing the Tar Heel men's basketball walk-ons. The term was started by one of the players, Stewart Cooper, in hopes that it would be a replacement for \"walk-ons\" and similar names, and soon enough Roy Williams caught on. North Carolina lost to Duke in the ACC Tournament Final and made a significant run in the NCAA Tournament until they were eliminated in the Elite Eight by Kentucky, finishing with a 29–8 record.[44] The 2011–2012 Tar Heels season started on November 11, 2011, as top-ranked Carolina beat Michigan State, 67–55, on the deck of the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson in San Diego. The Tar Heels finished the season with a record of 32–6, including a 14–2 ACC record to win the conference regular-season championship outright. The team fell to Florida State in the championship game of the 2012 ACC tournament and was a No. 1 seed in the Midwest Regional of the 2012 NCAA tournament; the team reached the Elite Eight and was defeated by Kansas 80–67. Before the Kansas game, the Tar Heels won their previous three games in the NCAA Tournament by an average of 13.7 points. In the second-round game versus Creighton, starting UNC point guard Kendall Marshall broke his right wrist with 10:56 remaining[45] in the second half with UNC leading 66–50. Marshall continued to play by dribbling primarily with his left hand and left the game with two minutes left with UNC leading 85–69. Williams announced the injury at the Creighton post-game press conference.[46] Marshall did not play in UNC's two following games in the NCAA Tournament, a 73–65 overtime win over Ohio in the Sweet 16 and the aforementioned 80–67 loss to Kansas in the Elite Eight. With the departures of several stars from the 2012 team, The Tar Heels would begin a slow climb back to the top following the Elite Eight loss. The 2012–13 season ended with a loss to Kansas in the tournament for the second year in a row. In 2013–14, the Tar Heels became the only team in men's college basketball history to beat every team ranked in the top 4 in the preseason.[15] The Tar Heels would finish 24–10 that year, ending the year by losing to Iowa State in the final seconds of the Round of 32. The 2014–15 team would improve, finishing the year 4th in the ACC and a Sweet 16 appearance, where they would lose to the Wisconsin. It was also the year that North Carolina would add Joel Berry II and Justin Jackson to the roster, who were both key contributors to the 2017 National Championship squad. In 2015–16, led by seniors Marcus Paige and Brice Johnson, the Tar Heels earned their 30th ACC regular season title, 18th ACC tournament title, and 19th Final Four.[15] They also appeared in their 10th NCAA title game, in which they lost on a buzzer beater to Villanova, despite Marcus Paige's dramatic three-pointer to tie the game with 4.7 seconds left.[47] The Tar Heels finished with a 33–7 overall record and a 14–4 ACC record. The following year, the Tar Heels were ranked No. 6 in the AP preseason poll, having lost Paige and Johnson but retaining 2016 ACC Tournament MVP Joel Berry II as well as forwards Kennedy Meeks and Isaiah Hicks. After early season losses to Indiana and Kentucky, the Tar Heels won their 31st ACC regular season title. Despite never being ranked No. 1 in the AP Poll and losing to Duke in the semifinals of the ACC tournament, the Heels earned a No. 1 seed in the NCAA tournament. On March 26, 2017, Luke Maye hit a jump shot with 0.3 seconds left to beat second-seed Kentucky, 75–73, to advance to Carolina's record 20th Final Four. On April 3, 2017, Final Four MOP Joel Berry II scored 22 points as UNC beat Gonzaga, 71–65, to give Williams his 3rd national championship, surpassing mentor Dean Smith for NCAA Tournament championships.[48] Just as in the previous year, the Tar Heels finished with a 33–7 overall record and a 14–4 ACC record.[49] In 2017–18, the Tar Heels were ranked at No. 9 in the AP and Coaches poll. Forwards Isaiah Hicks, Kennedy Meeks, Tony Bradley,[50] and Justin Jackson had left, while the team added Cameron Johnson. This season, the team did not win the ACC regular season or tournament title. However, the Heels earned a No. 2 seed in the NCAA Tournament and ended the season 26–11 after being eliminated by Texas A&M in the Round of 32 in the NCAA Tournament. In the 2018–19 season, the Tar Heels were led by freshman point guard Coby White, and seniors Luke Maye and Cameron Johnson. The Tar Heels were co-ACC regular season champions with Virginia, earned another Number 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament, and made it to the Sweet Sixteen round before being eliminated by the Auburn Tigers.[51] 2019–20 was an unusually down year for the Tar Heels, only winning 14 games and being swept by arch-rival Duke in the regular season. Freshman point guard Cole Anthony's knee injury and a lack of depth on the bench proved devastating for the Tar Heels, as they were unable to carry momentum through ACC play, losing several games on last second shots after starting the season 6–1. The Tar Heels made it to the second-round of the ACC tournament before losing to Syracuse in what would turn out to be the final ACC tournament game played before the cancellation of the rest of the 2019–20 season due to the emerging COVID-19 pandemic.[52] Williams passed Smith's mark of 879 all-time wins in the COVID-shortened season. Heading into the 2020–21 season, expectations were high after the lackluster, injury-filled performance of the season prior. Coming into the season with a talented freshman recruiting class, the Tar Heels looked to rebound from their 14–19 record. Senior Garrison Brooks was picked as the preseason ACC Player of the Year yet failed to live up to the preseason hype. Sophomore forward Armando Bacot led the Tar Heels in scoring, and the emergence of freshman Kerwin Walton provided the Tar Heels with an outside shooter that had been missing on the previous year's team. However, the Heels stumbled out of the starting block, beginning conference play with an 0–2 record in the ACC. However, the Tar Heels rebounded, and returned the favor to the Blue Devils, sweeping them in the two regular season matchups. Freshman guard Caleb Love scored 25 points and 7 assists against Duke in Durham, breaking an at-Duke assist record set by Ty Lawson in 2009. On February 27, 2021, Williams earned his 900th career victory as a head coach against Florida State, becoming the fastest coach to reach that mark, over the fewest number of games. The Tar Heels finished with a record of 18–11, losing to Wisconsin in the first round of the NCAA tournament. On April 1, 2021, Roy Williams announced his retirement as the head coach of the Tar Heels after 48 years in coaching and 33 years as a collegiate head coach, 18 of which came at the helm of his alma mater.[53] Williams ended his coaching career with 903 career wins, 485 of which came at Carolina, and three national championships, all as the Tar Heel head coach. At the time of his retirement, Williams was third all-time in NCAA Division I victories. Williams is the first coach to earn 400 or more wins at two different schools. Athletic Director Bubba Cunningham announced that evening that a search for the next head coach would begin immediately, with the search being headed up by Cunningham and UNC-Chapel Hill chancellor Kevin Guskiewicz. Four days after Williams retired, assistant coach and former Tar Heel player Hubert Davis was hired as his successor. Davis, the nephew of Tar Heel and NBA great Walter Davis, became the first African-American to lead the program.[54] After an up-and-down start to the regular season that included some blowout losses, Davis' Tar Heels turned a corner in the latter part of ACC conference play. With a 70–63 victory against Louisville on February 21, 2022, Davis reached 20 wins in his first season as head coach. The team coupled the renewed energy and intensity with a shock 94–81 upset victory over Duke in Mike Krzyzewski's final home game at Cameron Indoor Stadium. The Tar Heels earned an 8 seed in the NCAA tournament and upset the defending champions and 1 seeded Baylor 93-86 in the second round, despite the ejection of UNC forward Brady Manek due to a flagrant-2 foul. The Tar Heels defeated UCLA in the Sweet Sixteen and Saint Peter's in the Elite Eight to earn a trip to the 2022 Final Four in New Orleans. In a rematch of the regular season finale against Duke, the Tar Heels defeated Duke 81–77 in the national semifinal in Mike Krzyzewski's final game as a head coach. The Tar Heels faced the Kansas Jayhawks in the National Championship game, during which they were unable to capitalize on a double-digit halftime lead and were defeated by a final score of 72–69, finishing the season as National Runner-Up. The team was preseason #1 the following season but never could find much consistency finishing with a disappointing 20–13 record and declining an NIT bid. Because of this, they became the first preseason #1 team to miss the tournament since it expanded to 64 teams in 1985. After Caleb Love and others decided to transfer after the season, Davis looked to the transfer portal to improve the team's fortunes. They landed Harrison Ingram from Stanford University, and Cormac Ryan, a graduate transfer student from Notre Dame University, while also landing Elliot Cadeau, who was considered the top point guard in the class of 2024. The changes in personnel definitely helped as the Tar Heels finished the regular season 25-6 and atop the ACC standings at 17-3 for their 33rd conference title in school history. Along with sweeping their archrivals, Duke Blue Devils Hubert Davis was voted ACC coach of the year while senior RJ Davis was voted ACC player of the year. Dean Smith was widely known for his idea of \"The Carolina Way\", in which he challenged his players to \"Play hard, play smart, play together\".[55] \"The Carolina Way\" was an idea of excellence in the classroom, as well as on the court. In Coach Smith's book The Carolina Way, former player Scott Williams said, regarding Dean Smith: \"Winning was very important at Carolina, and there was much pressure to win, but Coach cared more about our getting a sound education and turning into good citizens than he did about winning.\"[56] \"The Carolina Way\" was evident in many practices the players would implement, including pointing to the player who assisted in a basket, giving him credit as an act of selflessness. This \"Thank the Passer\" practice is used throughout basketball today.[57] The Tar Heels own several notable streaks in the history of college basketball. They appeared in either the NCAA Tournament or National Invitation Tournament (NIT) every year from 1967 to 2001. This includes 27 straight appearances in the NCAA tourney from 1975 (the first year that more than one team in each conference was assured of a tournament bid) to 2001—the longest such streak in tournament history until it was broken by Kansas in March 2017. The Tar Heels also notched 37 straight winning seasons from 1964 to 2001, the third-longest such streak in NCAA history, behind UCLA's streak of 54 consecutive winning seasons from 1948 to 2001, and Syracuse's streak of 46 seasons. They also finished .500 or better for 39 years in a row from 1962 (Dean Smith's second year) to 2001, the third-longest such streak in NCAA history, behind Kentucky's streak of 61 consecutive seasons from 1926 to 1988 (the Wildcats were barred from playing in 1952–53 due to NCAA violations) and UCLA's 54-season streak. From the ACC's inception in 1953 to 2001, the Tar Heels did not finish worse than a tie for fourth place in ACC play. By comparison, all of the ACC's other charter members finished last at least once in that time. From 1965 to 2001, they did not finish worse than a tie for third, and for the first 21 of those years they did not finish worse than a tie for second. All of these streaks ended in the 2001–02 season, when the Tar Heels finished 8–20 on the season under coach Matt Doherty. They also finished tied for 7th in conference play, behind Florida State and Clemson—only their second losing conference record ever (the first being in the ACC's inaugural season). Additionally, the Tar Heels went 59–0 all-time in home games played against the Clemson Tigers (the NCAA record for the longest home winning streak against a single opponent).[58] The Tar Heels' all-time home winning streak against Clemson lasted until the 2019–2020 season where Clemson stunned the Tar Heels in overtime, 79–76.[59] Until the 2010 ACC tournament, North Carolina was the only program to have never played a Thursday game in the ACC tournament since it expanded to a four-day format. The Tar Heels have three stretches of being ranked for more than 100 consecutive weeks in the AP Poll. They spent 172 consecutive weeks in the rankings from the start of the 1990–91 season until early in the 1999–2000 season, the second-longest streak in college basketball history at the time behind only UCLA's run of 231 consecutive weeks from 1966 to 1980. That streak has since been passed by Duke's run of 200 consecutive weeks from 1997 to 2007 and Kansas' 231 consecutive weeks from 2009 to 2021. They were also ranked for 171 consecutive weeks from 1973 to 1983, and for 106 consecutive weeks from 2014 to 2020.[60] North Carolina has 14 victories over the AP number one ranked team.[64][65][66][67] Eight players (including Jack Cobb, whose jersey did not have a number) have had their numbers retired. Tyler Hansbrough's number 50 is the eighth to be retired, after he won all six major player of the year awards during the 2007–08 season.[69] 51 former North Carolina men's basketball players are honored in the Smith Center with banners representing their numbers hung from the rafters. Of the 51 honored jerseys, eight are retired. In addition to the eight retired jerseys, an additional 43 jerseys are honored. Joel Berry II, Justin Jackson, and RJ Davis most recently qualified to have their jerseys honored.[71][72] To have his jersey honored, a player must have met one of the following criteria:[73] To date thirteen Tar Heels have been inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame Source:[95] UNC alumni defeated UCLA alumni 116–111 in an exhibition game in Los Angeles, CA on June 29, 1987.[102] The Carolina Basketball Museum[103][104] is located in the Ernie Williamson Athletics Center and contains 8,000 square feet (740 m2).[105] It was built to replace the old memorabilia room in the Dean Smith Center.[105] Designed by Gallagher & Associates, the cost of construction was $3.4 million.[105] The museum opened in January 2008.[106][107] The UNC junior varsity basketball team was originally used at North Carolina as freshmen teams because freshmen were not allowed to play on the varsity team until the NCAA granted freshmen eligibility in the Fall of 1972. After most schools decided to disband their J.V. squads, North Carolina's athletic department opted to keep the team so that non-scholarship students were given the chance to play basketball for UNC. North Carolina also uses their J.V. team as a way for varsity assistant coaches to gain experience as head coaches, such as the current coach, Hubert Davis. Roy Williams was a J.V. coach for eight years before he was hired at Kansas. Students at UNC are only allowed to play on the team for two years, and then they are given a chance to try out for the varsity. The J.V. team also serves as a way for coaches to evaluate players for two years on the J.V. so they will better know what to expect when they try out for varsity later in their careers. UNC's J.V. team plays a combination of teams from Division II and III schools, some community colleges, and a few prep schools from around the North Carolina area.",

                "content": "Progressive Era Repression and persecution Anti-war and civil rights movements Contemporary Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (/oʊˌkɑːsioʊ kɔːrˈtɛz/ ⓘ oh-KAH-see-oh kor-TEZ, Spanish: [aleɣˈsandɾja oˈkasjo koɾˈtes]; born October 13, 1989), also known as AOC, is an American politician and activist serving since 2019 as the U.S. representative for New York's 14th congressional district. She is a member of the Democratic Party. Ocasio-Cortez was born in the New York City borough of the Bronx. Her family later moved to Yorktown Heights, where she attended Yorktown High School. She then attended Boston University, where she double-majored in international relations and economics, graduating with honors. She moved back to the Bronx, becoming an activist and working as a waitress and bartender. On June 26, 2018, Ocasio-Cortez drew national recognition when she won the Democratic Party's primary election for New York's 14th congressional district. She defeated Democratic Caucus chair Joe Crowley, a 10-term incumbent, in what was widely seen as the biggest upset victory in the 2018 midterm election primaries.[4][5][6] She easily won the November general election, defeating Republican Anthony Pappas. She was reelected in the 2020, 2022, and 2024 elections. Taking office at age 29, Ocasio-Cortez is the youngest woman[7][8] and the first female member of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) to be elected to Congress.[c][10] She advocates a progressive platform that includes support for worker cooperatives,[11] Medicare for All, tuition-free public college, a federal jobs guarantee, a Green New Deal, and abolishing the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). She is a prominent leader of the left-wing faction of the Democratic Party, and a member of progressive congressional bloc \"the Squad\". Ocasio-Cortez was born in the New York City borough of the Bronx on October 13, 1989, the daughter of Sergio Ocasio-Roman and Blanca Ocasio-Cortez (née Cortez).[12] She has a younger brother named Gabriel.[13] Her father was born in the Bronx to a Puerto Rican family and became an architect; her mother was born in Puerto Rico.[14][15][16] The family lived in an apartment in the Bronx neighborhood of Parkchester[15] until Ocasio-Cortez was five, when they moved to a house in suburban Yorktown Heights.[15][17] She said her family raised enough money to buy a small home there so she could go to school, and that her mother worked as a house cleaner in the town.[18] Ocasio-Cortez attended Yorktown High School, graduating in 2007.[19] In high school and college, Ocasio-Cortez went by the name of \"Sandy Ocasio\".[20] She came in second in the microbiology category of the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair in 2007 with a research project on the effect of antioxidants on the lifespan of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.[21][22] In a show of appreciation for her efforts, the MIT Lincoln Laboratory named a small asteroid after her: 23238 Ocasio-Cortez.[23][24] In high school, she took part in the National Hispanic Institute's Lorenzo de Zavala (LDZ) Youth Legislative Session. After graduating, she became the LDZ Secretary of State while attending Boston University. Ocasio-Cortez had a John F. Lopez Fellowship.[25] Her father died of lung cancer in 2008 during her second year of college,[26][27] and Ocasio-Cortez became involved in a lengthy probate dispute to settle his estate. She has said that the experience helped her learn \"first-hand how attorneys appointed by the court to administer an estate can enrich themselves at the expense of the families struggling to make sense of the bureaucracy\".[28] During college, Ocasio-Cortez was an intern for U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy in his section on foreign affairs and immigration issues.[29] In interviews, she said she was the only Spanish speaker in the office and the sole person responsible for assisting Spanish-speaking constituents.[29][30][31] Ocasio-Cortez graduated cum laude[32] from Boston University in 2011 with a bachelor's degree in international relations and economics.[33][30][34] After college, Ocasio-Cortez moved back to the Bronx and took a job as a bartender and waitress to help her mother—a house cleaner and school bus driver—fight foreclosure of their home.[35][36] She later launched Brook Avenue Press, a now-defunct publishing firm for books that portrayed the Bronx in a positive light.[37][38] Ocasio-Cortez also worked for the nonprofit National Hispanic Institute.[25][39][40] During the 2016 primary, Ocasio-Cortez worked as an organizer for Bernie Sanders's presidential campaign.[41] After the general election, she traveled across America by car, visiting places such as Flint, Michigan, and Standing Rock Indian Reservation in North Dakota, and speaking to people affected by the Flint water crisis and the Dakota Access Pipeline.[42] In an interview she recalled her December 2016 visit to Standing Rock as a tipping point, saying that before that, she had believed that the only way to run for office effectively was to have access to wealth, social influence, and power. But her visit to North Dakota, where she saw others \"putting their whole lives and everything that they had on the line for the protection of their community\", inspired her to begin to work for her own community.[43] One day after she visited North Dakota, she got a phone call from Brand New Congress, which was recruiting progressive candidates (her brother had nominated her soon after Election Day 2016).[44] She has credited Jabari Brisport's unsuccessful City Council campaign with restoring her belief in electoral politics, in running as a socialist candidate, and in Democratic Socialists of America as an organization.[45] Ocasio-Cortez began her campaign in April 2017[7] while waiting tables and tending bar at Flats Fix, a taqueria in New York City's Union Square.[47] \"For 80 percent of this campaign, I operated out of a paper grocery bag hidden behind that bar,\" she told Bon Appétit.[48] She was the first person since 2004 to challenge Joe Crowley, the Democratic Caucus Chair, in the primary. She faced a financial disadvantage, saying, \"You can't really beat big money with more money. You have to beat them with a totally different game.\"[49][50][28] Ocasio-Cortez's campaign undertook grassroots mobilization and did not take donations from corporations.[7] Her campaign posters' designs were said to have taken inspiration from \"revolutionary posters and visuals from the past\".[46] The candidates' only face-to-face encounter during the campaign occurred on a local political talk show, Inside City Hall, on June 15. The format was a joint interview conducted by Errol Louis, which NY1 characterized as a debate.[51] A debate in the Bronx was scheduled for June 18, but Crowley did not participate. He sent former New York City Council member Annabel Palma in his place.[52][53][54] Ocasio-Cortez was endorsed by progressive and civil rights organizations such as MoveOn[55] and Democracy for America.[41] Then-Governor Cuomo endorsed Crowley,[56] as did both of New York's U.S. senators, Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand,[57] multiple U.S. representatives, various local elected officials and trade unions, and groups such as the Sierra Club,[58] Planned Parenthood,[58] the Working Families Party,[59] NARAL Pro-Choice America,[60] and Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, among others.[61] California representative Ro Khanna, a Justice Democrat like Ocasio-Cortez,[57][7] initially endorsed Crowley but later endorsed Ocasio-Cortez in an unusual dual endorsement.[62] Ocasio-Cortez received 57.13% of the vote (15,897) to Crowley's 42.5% (11,761), defeating the 10-term incumbent by almost 15 percentage points on June 26, 2018.[63] The result shocked many political commentators and analysts and immediately garnered nationwide attention. Many news sources, including Time, CNN, The New York Times, and The Guardian mentioned how the win completely defied their predictions and expectations.[41][64][65][5] She was outspent by a margin of 18 to 1 ($1.5 million to $83,000) but won the endorsement of some influential groups on the party's left.[66] Crowley conceded defeat on election night,[67] but did not telephone Ocasio-Cortez that night to congratulate her, fueling short-lived speculation that he intended to run against her in the general election.[68] Bernie Sanders and Noam Chomsky congratulated her.[69][70] Several commentators noted the similarities between Ocasio-Cortez's victory over Crowley and Dave Brat's Tea Party movement-supported 2014 victory over House majority leader Eric Cantor in the Republican primary for Virginia's 7th congressional district.[71][72] Like Crowley, Cantor was a high-ranking member in his party's caucus.[73] After her primary win, Ocasio-Cortez endorsed several progressive primary challengers to Democratic incumbents nationwide,[74] capitalizing on her fame and spending her political capital in a manner unusual even[tone] for unexpected primary winners.[75] Without campaigning for it, Ocasio-Cortez won the Reform Party primary as a write-in candidate in a neighboring congressional district, New York's 15th, with a total vote count of nine, highest among all 22 write-in candidates. She declined the nomination.[76][77] Ocasio-Cortez faced Republican nominee Anthony Pappas in the November 6 general election.[78] Pappas, an economics professor, did not actively campaign. The 14th district has a Cook Partisan Voting Index of D+29, making it New York City's sixth-most Democratic district, with registered Democrats outnumbering Republicans almost six to one.[79][80] Ocasio-Cortez was endorsed by various politically progressive organizations and figures, including former president Barack Obama and U.S. senator Bernie Sanders.[81][82] She spoke at the Netroots Nation conference in August 2018, and was called \"the undisputed star of the convention\".[83] Crowley remained on the ballot as the nominee of the Working Families Party (WFP) and the Women's Equality Party (WEP). Neither he nor the WFP party actively campaigned, both having endorsed Ocasio-Cortez after the Democratic primary.[84] Ocasio-Cortez called the WEP, which Governor Cuomo created ahead of the 2014 New York gubernatorial election, a cynical, centrist group that endorsed male incumbents over female challengers like her and Cynthia Nixon.[85] Former Connecticut senator Joe Lieberman, who won reelection in 2006 on a third-party line after losing the Democratic primary in 2006, penned a July 17 column in the Wall Street Journal expressing hope that Crowley would actively campaign on the WFP ballot line.[86] WFP Executive Director Dan Cantor wrote an endorsement of, and apology to, Ocasio-Cortez for the New York Daily News; he asked voters not to vote for Crowley if his name remained on the general election ballot.[87] Ocasio-Cortez won the election with 78% of the vote (110,318) to Pappas's 14% (17,762). Crowley, on the WFP and WEP lines, received 9,348 votes (6.6%). Her election was part of a broader Democratic victory in the 2018 midterm elections, as the party gained control of the House by picking up 41 seats.[88] Saikat Chakrabarti, who had been her campaign co-chair, became chief of staff for her congressional office.[89] His departure in 2019 drew considerable speculation as to whether Ocasio-Cortez was trying to implement a more moderate strategy.[90] The first media network to give Ocasio-Cortez a platform and extensively cover her campaign and policies was The Young Turks, a left-wing online news program.[7] After her primary win, she quickly garnered nationwide media attention, including numerous articles and TV talk-show appearances.[91][92] She also drew a great amount of media attention when she and Sanders campaigned for James Thompson in Kansas in July 2018.[93] A rally in Wichita had to be moved from a theater with a capacity of 1,500 when far more people said they would attend. The event drew 4,000 people, with some seated on the floor.[94] In The New Yorker, Benjamin Wallace-Wells wrote that while Sanders remained \"the de-facto leader of an increasingly popular left, [he is unable to] do things that do not come naturally to him, like supply hope.\" Wallace-Wells suggested that Ocasio-Cortez had made Sanders's task easier, as he could point to her success to show that ideas \"once considered to be radical are now part of the mainstream\".[94] Until she defeated incumbent Joe Crowley in the 2018 Democratic primary, Ocasio-Cortez received little coverage on most traditional news media outlets.[95][96] Jimmy Dore interviewed her when she first announced her candidacy in June 2017.[97] After her primary win, Brian Stelter wrote that progressive-media outlets, such as The Young Turks and The Intercept, \"saw the Ocasio-Cortez upset coming\" in advance.[72] Margaret Sullivan wrote in The Washington Post that traditional metrics of measuring a campaign's viability, like total fundraising, were contributing to a \"media failure\" and that \"they need to get closer to what voters are thinking and feeling: their anger and resentment, their disenfranchisement from the centers of power, their pocketbook concerns.\"[96] Ocasio-Cortez's campaign was featured on the cover of the June 2018 edition of The Indypendent,[98][99] a free New York City-based monthly newspaper. In a tweet she hailed the cover appearance on \"NYC's classic monthly\" as an important breakthrough for her campaign.[100] Otherwise Ocasio-Cortez was barely mentioned in print until her primary win.[101] Ocasio-Cortez was one of the subjects of the 2018 Michael Moore documentary Fahrenheit 11/9; it chronicled her primary campaign.[102][103] In an attempt to embarrass Ocasio-Cortez just before she took office, Twitter user \"AnonymousQ\" shared a video dating to Ocasio-Cortez's college years: a Boston University student-produced dance video in which she briefly appeared.[104] Many social media users came to her defense, inspiring memes and a Twitter account syncing the footage to songs like \"Mambo No. 5\" and \"Gangnam Style\".[105] Ocasio-Cortez responded by posting a video of herself dancing to Edwin Starr's \"War\" outside her congressional office.[104] Elizabeth Warren wrote the entry on Ocasio-Cortez for 2019's Time 100.[106] The documentary Knock Down the House, directed by Rachel Lears, which focuses on four female Democrats in the 2018 United States elections who were not career politicians—Ocasio-Cortez, Amy Vilela, Cori Bush and Paula Jean Swearengin—premiered at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival. Ocasio-Cortez was the only one of the women featured in the film to win.[107][108] It was released by Netflix on May 1, 2019.[109] Ocasio-Cortez also appeared in Lears's 2022 film To the End, which focuses on the effects of climate change. The film debuted at the 2022 Sundance Film Festival[110][111] and was presented at the Tribeca Film Festival in June 2022.[112] Michelle Caruso-Cabrera challenged Ocasio-Cortez in the 2020 Democratic primary.[113] After Ocasio-Cortez won the nomination, Caruso-Cabrera reorganized and ran in the general election as the Serve America Movement nominee.[114] Ocasio-Cortez's Republican challengers in the general election included nominee John Cummings, a former police officer, and Antoine Tucker, a write-in candidate.[114][115] The American Prospect wrote in October 2020 that Ocasio-Cortez was \"spending the 2020 campaign running workshops\" for constituents on workplace organizing, fighting eviction, and organizing childcare.[116] They noted that Ocasio-Cortez was often not featured in the streamed workshops, saying the \"strategy decentralizes the candidate from her own campaign.\"[116] On October 20, 2020, Ocasio-Cortez hosted a Twitch stream of the social deduction game Among Us, with fellow congresswoman Ilhan Omar, and many established streamers such as Pokimane, Hasan Piker, DrLupo, and mxmtoon.[117] The stream peaked with over 400,000 viewers and, according to The Guardian's Joshua Rivera, succeeded in humanizing her.[118][119][120][121] Ocasio-Cortez again streamed Among Us on Twitch on November 27, 2020, with Hasan Piker, xQc, ContraPoints and Canadian MP Jagmeet Singh to raise money for food pantries, eviction defense legal aid, and community support organizations to assist those suffering economic hardship during the COVID-19 pandemic.[122] The stream raised $200,000 and Ocasio-Cortez wrote, \"This is going to make such a difference for those who need it most right now.\"[123] Ocasio-Cortez ran unopposed in the Democratic primary.[124] She defeated Republican Tina Forte and Conservative Party nominee Desi Cuellar in the general election.[125] In May, the DSA debated whether to endorse Ocasio-Cortez. Some members argued that she was more committed to the Democratic Party and that her positions on Palestine had become weaker.[126] On June 23, the DSA National Political Committee (NPC) voted to endorse her so long as she fulfilled its list of demands, most concerning Palestine. The New York City chapter, which endorsed her, rejected the deal. On July 10, the NPC withdrew its endorsement of Ocasio-Cortez. It mainly cited a panel she held with Jewish leaders that supposedly conflated antisemitism with anti-Zionism. Other concerns included her support for a resolution that characterized denial of Israel's right to exist as antisemitism and her support of the Iron Dome defense system.[127][128][129] Investment banker Marty Dolan, a moderate Democrat, ran against Ocasio-Cortez in the primary. Ocasio-Cortez won overwhelmingly.[130] Ocasio-Cortez again easily won the general election.[131] Notably, some voters in her district split their tickets, voting for Ocasio-Cortez and for Trump in the presidential election. A political analyst speaking to NBC New York said this was because both candidates \"were leading with the message of working-class pocketbook issues\".[132] Ocasio-Cortez asked those who split their tickets why they did so; some said that they both cared about the working class and were \"less establishment\", while others cited the Israel-Hamas war and the economy.[133] Taking office at age 29, Ocasio-Cortez is the youngest woman ever to serve in the United States Congress, and also the youngest member of the 116th Congress.[134] When the 116th Congress convened on January 3, 2019, Ocasio-Cortez entered with no seniority but with a large social media presence. Axios credited her with \"as much social media clout as her fellow freshman Democrats combined\".[135] Since June 2024[update], she has 13.1 million X (formerly Twitter) followers,[136] up from 1.4 million in November 2018[135] and surpassing Nancy Pelosi.[137] She has 8.1 million Instagram followers as of June 2024[138] and 1.8 million followers on Facebook as of June 2024.[139] Her colleagues appointed her to teach them social media lessons upon her arrival in Congress.[139] In early July 2019 two lawsuits were filed against her for blocking Joey Salads and Dov Hikind on Twitter in light of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that it was a violation of the First Amendment for President Trump to block people on Twitter.[140][141] On November 4, 2019, it was announced that they settled the lawsuit with Ocasio-Cortez issuing a statement apologizing for the Twitter block.[142][143] In a 2019 interview, Ocasio-Cortez said she had stopped using her private Facebook account and was minimizing her usage of all social media accounts and platforms, calling them a \"public health risk\".[144][145] In November 2018, on the first day of congressional orientation, Ocasio-Cortez participated in a climate change protest outside the office of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.[146] Also that month, she backed Pelosi's bid to be Speaker of the House once the Democratic Party reclaimed the majority on the condition that Pelosi \"remains the most progressive candidate for speaker\".[147] During the orientation for new members hosted by the John F. Kennedy School of Government, Ocasio-Cortez wrote on Twitter in December 2018 about the influence of corporate interests by sponsors such as the American Enterprise Institute and the Center for Strategic and International Studies: \"Lobbyists are here. Goldman Sachs is here. Where's labor? Activists? Frontline community leaders?\"[148][149][150] When Ocasio-Cortez made her first speech on the floor of Congress in January 2019, C-SPAN tweeted the video. Within 12 hours, the video of her four-minute speech set the record as C-SPAN's most-watched Twitter video of a member of the House of Representatives.[151] In February 2019, speaking at a Congressional hearing with a panel of representatives from campaign finance watchdog groups, Ocasio-Cortez questioned the panel about ethics regulations as they apply to both the president and members of Congress. She asserted that no regulations prevent lawmakers \"from being bought off by wealthy corporations\".[152] With more than 37.5 million views, the clip became the most-watched political video posted on Twitter.[153] When President Donald Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen appeared before the Oversight Committee in February 2019, Ocasio-Cortez asked him whether Trump had inflated property values for bank or insurance purposes and where to get more information on the subject.[154] Cohen's reply implied that Trump may have committed tax and bank fraud in his personal and business tax returns, financial statements and real-estate filings.[155][156] The president of the American Constitution Society named Ocasio-Cortez as the committee member best at obtaining specific information from Cohen about Trump's \"shady practices, along with a road map for how to find out more\".[157] New York Times columnist David Brooks praised her skill in questioning Cohen.[158] The exchange between Ocasio-Cortez and Cohen prompted an investigation by New York attorney general Letitia James, who referred to it in August 2020 when filing legal action to compel Trump's companies to comply with subpoenas about financial information, and to compel his son Eric Trump to testify.[159] Further developments as a result of the exchange saw James form a civil investigation and lawsuit against the Trump Organization regarding potential financial fraud, which resulted in a fine of $354 million and a ban on Trump doing business in New York for two to three years.[160][161][162] According to reports in March 2019, Ocasio-Cortez continued to receive media coverage early in her congressional tenure on par with that of 2020 presidential candidates[163] and was considered \"one of the faces of the Democratic party\"[164] and one of the most talked-about politicians in the United States.[165] Between July 8 and 14, 2019, she drew more social media attention than the Democratic presidential candidates. Tracking company NewsWhip found that interactions with news articles on Ocasio-Cortez numbered 4.8 million, while no Democratic presidential candidate got more than 1.2 million. David Bauder of the Associated Press wrote that Trump's supporters were thus having \"some success\" in having \"Ocasio-Cortez be top of mind when people think of\" the Democratic Party.[166] According to a Media Matters for America study, Ocasio-Cortez has been intensely discussed on sister television channels Fox News and Fox Business, being mentioned every day from February 25 to April 7, 2019, for a total of 3,181 mentions in 42 days (an average of around 75 per day). The Guardian's David Smith wrote that this is evidence that Fox is \"obsessed by Ocasio-Cortez, portraying her as a radical socialist who threatens the American way of life\".[167] Brian Stelter of CNN Business found that between January and July 2019, she had nearly three times as many mentions on Fox News as on CNN and MSNBC, and seven times the coverage of James Clyburn, a Democratic leader in the House of Representatives. Stelter wrote that the attention Ocasio-Cortez is receiving has caused \"the perception, particularly on the right, that her positions and policies are representative of the Democratic Party as a whole\".[168] In a CBS News and YouGov poll of almost 2,100 American adults conducted from July 17 to 19, it was found that Republican respondents were more aware of Ocasio-Cortez than Democratic respondents. She had very unfavorable ratings among Republican respondents and favorable ratings among Democratic respondents.[169] In March 2019, Time Magazine said Ocasio-Cortez was the \"second-most talked about politician\" in the United States, after Trump, and called her \"the Wonder Woman of the left\".[170] In March 2019, PolitiFact reported that Ocasio-Cortez is \"one of the most targeted politicians for hoax claims, despite the fact that she just entered Congress as a freshman\". Fake quotes attributed to her, fake photos of her, and false rumors about her have spread on social media. Some of these have originated from 4chan and r/The_Donald.[171] By July 2019, the fake material included attributing things Trump said to Ocasio-Cortez, such as \"I have a very good brain and I've said lots of things.\"[172] On July 18, 2019, Charlie Rispoli, a police officer from Gretna, Louisiana, posted on Facebook an apparent threat to shoot Ocasio-Cortez, calling her a \"vile idiot\" who \"needs a round, and I don't mean the kind she used to serve\" as a bartender. Rispoli posted the comment in response to a fake news article that falsely quoted Ocasio-Cortez as saying, \"We pay soldiers too much\". A photo from the article also had the label \"satire\".[173] Rispoli was fired for his post and his Facebook account was deleted.[174] Ocasio-Cortez is known to wear red lipstick, usually by the American makeup brand Stila Cosmetics in the shade \"Beso\", as a style trait of Latina women from the Bronx.[175] In a skincare tutorial for Vogue, she explained that beauty and femininity are important to her because these things are often used against women in politics and society, and that self-love is like a \"mini protest\" against misogynistic critiques.[176] Ocasio-Cortez attended the 2021 Met Gala, which had the theme \"In America: a Lexicon of Fashion\". The Met Gala is an annual fundraiser for the Metropolitan Museum of Art that is overseen by Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour, who selects every invitee and designer pairing. Ocasio-Cortez wore an organza gown emblazoned with the phrase \"Tax the Rich\". As an elected official in New York City, she was considered a guest of the museum, and as such did not have to buy a ticket, which costs persons other than elected officials at least $35,000. Responding to critics, Ocasio-Cortez stated that they were using a sexist double standard and that she \"punctured the fourth wall of excess and spectacle\". James also believed that the extremely wealthy people in attendance needed to see the message in person.[177] In September 2021, the American Accountability Foundation filed an ethics complaint against Ocasio-Cortez for attending the Met Gala. The AAF claimed that her attendance amounted to accepting an illegal gift since her estimated $35,000 ticket was paid for by Condé Nast, a for-profit company, not a charity.[178][179][180] Ocasio-Cortez is a member of an informal group of progressive members of Congress called \"the Squad\", initially including Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley, and Rashida Tlaib.[181] On July 14, 2019, Trump attacked the Squad (which had only four members at the time) in a tweet, saying that they should \"go back and help fix\" the countries they came from rather than criticize the American government.[182] He continued to make similar comments over the next several days, even though three of the women, including Ocasio-Cortez, were born in the United States. Ocasio-Cortez responded in a tweet that \"the President's words [yesterday], telling four American Congresswomen of color 'go back to your own country' is hallmark language of white supremacists.\"[183] She later added, \"We don't leave the things that we love, and when we love this country, what that means is that we propose the solutions to fix it.\"[184] Days later, Trump falsely asserted that Ocasio-Cortez called \"our country and our people 'garbage'\"; she had actually said that Americans should not be content with moderate policies that are \"10% better from garbage\".[185] Trump also falsely claimed that Ocasio-Cortez said \"illegal immigrants are more American\" than Americans who tried to keep them out; she actually said that \"women and children on that border that are trying to seek refuge and opportunity\" in America \"are acting more American\" than those who tried to keep them out.[186] The Squad grew in 2020, 2022, and 2024, with Jamaal Bowman, Cori Bush, Greg Casar, Summer Lee, and Delia Ramirez joining.[187] Ocasio-Cortez submitted her first piece of legislation, the Green New Deal, to the House on February 7, 2019. She and Senator Ed Markey released a joint non-binding resolution laying out the main elements of a 10-year \"economic mobilization\" that \"would phase out fossil fuel use and overhaul the nation's infrastructure.\"[188] Their plan called for implementing the \"social cost of carbon\" that was part of the Obama administration's plans to address climate change. In the process it aimed to create jobs.[188] According to CNBC, an initial outline the Green New Deal called for \"completely ditching fossil fuels, upgrading or replacing 'every building' in the country and 'totally overhaul[ing] transportation' to the point where 'air travel stops becoming necessary'\". The outline set a goal of having the U.S. \"creating 'net zero' greenhouse gases in 10 years. Why 'net zero'? The lawmakers explained: 'We set a goal to get to net-zero, rather than zero emissions, in 10 years because we aren't sure that we'll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast.'\"[189] Activist groups such as Greenpeace and the Sunrise Movement came out in favor of the plan. No Republican lawmakers voiced support.[190][191] The plan gained support from some Democratic senators, including Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Cory Booker;[192] other Democrats, such as Senator Dianne Feinstein and House speaker Nancy Pelosi, dismissed the proposal (Pelosi has referred to it as \"the green dream, or whatever they call it\").[193] On March 26, Senate Republicans called for an early vote on the Green New Deal without allowing discussion or expert testimony. Markey said Republicans were trying to \"make a mockery\" of the Green New Deal debate and called the vote a \"sham\". In protest, Senate Democrats voted \"present\" or against the bill, resulting in a 57–0 defeat on the Senate floor.[194][195] In March 2019, a group of UK activists proposed that the Labour Party adopt a similar plan, \"Labour for a Green New Deal\". The group said it was inspired by the Sunrise Movement and the work Ocasio-Cortez has done in the US.[196] On July 20, 2020, U.S. Representatives Ted Yoho and Roger Williams accosted Ocasio-Cortez on the Capitol steps, where Yoho (as overheard by a journalist) called her \"disgusting\" and told her \"You are out of your freaking mind\" for recently suggesting that poverty and unemployment were driving a spike in crime in New York City during the COVID-19 pandemic amid her ongoing advocacy for cutting police budgets. Ocasio-Cortez told Yoho he was being \"rude\". As she walked away from Yoho into the Capitol, Yoho called her a \"fucking bitch\".[197][198] Yoho addressed the matter on the House floor and, without naming Ocasio-Cortez, apologized for the \"abrupt manner of the conversation\" with her, claiming that \"offensive name calling, words attributed to me by the press, were never spoken to my colleagues\", and concluding: \"I cannot apologize for my passion\".[199][200] Ocasio-Cortez responded with a speech saying that the incident was emblematic of a \"culture ... accepting of violence and violent language against women ... In using that language, in front of the press, he gave permission to use that language against his wife, his daughters, women in his community, and I am here to stand up to say that is not acceptable.\"[201][202] In November 2021, Representative Paul Gosar posted a version of the title sequence of the anime series Attack on Titan on social media that he had edited with the faces of Ocasio-Cortez, Joe Biden, and himself superimposed on the show's characters, depicting Gosar attacking them with swords and killing Ocasio-Cortez. Speaker Nancy Pelosi called for law enforcement and the House Ethics Committee to investigate it as a threat.[203] Pelosi opened discussion on the House floor, saying that Gosar's actions demanded a response: \"We cannot have members joking about murdering each other or threatening the president of the United States. This is both an indictment of our elected officials and an insult to the institution of the House of Representatives. It's not just about us as members of Congress. It is a danger that it represents to everyone in the country.\"[204] When Republican House members refused to condemn the video, Ocasio-Cortez responded that she believed the video was \"part of a pattern that normalizes violence\", adding, \"I believe this is a part of a concerted strategy and I think it's very important for us to draw a strict line a strong line for material consequence\". She gave a six-minute floor speech, saying, \"This is not about me. This is not about Representative Gosar. This is about what we're willing to accept.\" The House voted to censure Gosar, mostly along party lines. The last time the House censured a lawmaker was in 2010.[205][206] In a nearly 90-minute Instagram Live video made in February 2021,[207] Ocasio-Cortez said that she had previously experienced sexual assault, and recounted her experience of fear during the 2021 storming of the United States Capitol, when she was in her office (in the Cannon House Office Building).[208] She said she had hidden in her office bathroom before being startled by a Capitol Police officer who entered her office suite and shouted \"Where is she?\" before ordering her and her staff to evacuate to a different House Office Building. Ocasio-Cortez said the officer did not self-identify, and said she first believed the officer's voice was that of an attacker. She described sheltering in place in Representative Katie Porter's office and preparing for what she believed would be an assault by rioters on their offices.[209][210] She said, \"I had a very close encounter where I thought I was going to die.\"[211] Ocasio-Cortez gave her first major convention speech at the 2024 Democratic National Convention, where she was given a primetime slot.[212] She expressed support for the Harris-Walz campaign and heavily criticized Trump, calling him a union buster who would \"sell this country for a dollar if it meant lining his own pockets and greasing the palms of his Wall Street friends\". She leaned into her middle-class background and said that Harris would support the middle class because she is from it and understands it. Ocasio-Cortez also addressed the Israel-Hamas war, saying Harris was \"working tirelessly\" for a ceasefire and hostage deal.[213] The speech was well received, including by moderate and establishment Democrats. After the speech, Politico wrote that Ocasio-Cortez was one of the party's \"most celebrated stars\" and that the establishment acknowledged it.[214][215] The speech also led to speculation as to whether Ocasio-Cortez would run for higher office.[216][214][217][218] Ocasio-Cortez reacted to the 2021 Texas power crisis by organizing a fundraiser to provide food, water, and shelter to affected Texans. The fundraiser, which began on February 18, raised $2 million in its first day[219][220] and $5 million by February 21.[221] The money was given to organizations such as the Houston Food Bank and the North Texas Food Bank.[221] Ocasio-Cortez also traveled to Houston to help volunteers with recovery.[222] On April 15, 2021, Ocasio-Cortez and three other senators called a press conference to announce a bill that they had introduced to implement postal banking pilot programs in rural and low-income urban neighborhoods where millions of households cannot access or afford standard banking services. Ocasio-Cortez described the families she sees in her urban community who need to rely on check cashing companies that charge exorbitant interest rates due to the absence of mainstream banks. \"They'll show up to a check cashing place and imagine cashing your stimulus check...and having 10 to 20% of that check taken away from you.\"[223] On November 5, 2021, Ocasio-Cortez was one of six House Democrats to break with their party and vote against the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, as it was decoupled from the social safety net provisions in the Build Back Better Act.[224][225] In September 2022, Ocasio-Cortez was asked about running for president. She said, \"I hold two contradictory things [in mind] at the same time. One is just the relentless belief that anything is possible. But at the same time, my experience here has given me a front-row seat to how deeply and unconsciously, as well as consciously, so many people in this country hate women. And they hate women of color. People ask me questions about the future. And realistically, I can't even tell you if I'm going to be alive in September [of 2022]. And that weighs very heavily on me. And it's not just the right wing. Misogyny transcends political ideology: left, right, center.\"[226] In June 2024, following reports that Clarence Thomas accepted undisclosed gifts from conservatives, Ocasio-Cortez said the Court was \"corrupted by money and extremism\" and undemocratic. She and Representative Jamie Raskin led a congressional meeting about the Court,[227] and explored options for holding justices accountable.[228] On June 25, they introduced the \"High Court Gift Ban Act\", which would impose restrictions on the gifts given to justices.[229] In July 2024, Ocasio-Cortez supported and co-led the \"DEFIANCE Act\", which would allow people to sue creators and distributors of non-consensual deepfake pornography of themselves, something that had previously been done to her.[230] On July 1, after the Supreme Court ruled in Trump v. United States that presidents have immunity from criminal prosecution for official actions, Ocasio-Cortez announced she would file articles of impeachment against justices. She said the court was corrupt and that Congress must defend the nation against an \"authoritarian capture\".[231][232] On July 10, Ocasio-Cortez officially introduced articles of impeachment against justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, co-sponsored by seven House Democrats. The resolution accused the justices of failing to recuse themselves from cases despite personal bias and not disclosing lavish gifts they received. The resolution cited the involvement of Ginni Thomas in attempts to overturn the 2020 election and the presence of \"Stop the Steal\" symbols on Alito's properties as personal bias.[233] In a statement, she said that corruption in the court had become a constitutional crisis that threatened democracy.[234][235] Legal experts said the case would likely fail, but was still important because it drew attention to the justices' conduct.[236] In December 2024, Ocasio-Cortez made a bid for ranking member of the House Oversight Committee, but lost to the more senior Gerry Connolly.[237] Ocasio-Cortez has been described as progressive,[242] left-wing,[243] left-wing populist,[244] and far-left.[245] Ocasio-Cortez is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America[9] and embraces the democratic socialist label as part of her political identity. In an interview on NBC's Meet the Press, she described democratic socialism as \"part of what I am. It's not all of what I am. And I think that that's a very important distinction.\"[246] In response to a question about democratic socialism ultimately calling for an end to capitalism during a Firing Line interview on PBS, she answered: \"Ultimately, we are marching towards progress on this issue. I do think that we are going to see an evolution in our economic system of an unprecedented degree, and it's hard to say what direction that that takes.\"[247] Later at a conference she said \"To me, capitalism is irredeemable.\"[248] Ocasio-Cortez supports progressive ideals such as workplace democracy,[11] single-payer Medicare for All, tuition-free public college and trade school,[249] a federal job guarantee,[250] the cancellation of all $1.6 trillion of outstanding student debt,[251] guaranteed family leave,[252] abolishing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement,[253] ending the privatization of prisons, enacting gun-control policies,[254] and energy policy relying on 100% renewables.[255] She told Anderson Cooper that she favors policies that \"most closely resemble what we see in the UK, in Norway, in Finland, in Sweden\".[256] Ocasio-Cortez has rejected state socialism, calling it \"undemocratic\" and \"easily corrupted\", but has expressed support for worker control of the means of production.[257] She has also said that market economies are not incompatible with democratic socialism as long as workers control companies, citing worker cooperatives as a model.[258] Ocasio-Cortez supports raising the marginal tax rate on top income earners to fund the implementation of her policy goals.[259] She was among the 46 House Democrats who voted against final passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023.[260] Ocasio-Cortez has called for reducing defense spending.[261] In December 2022, she was the only House Democrat to vote against an omnibus spending package because it increased funding for defense and federal agencies that oversee immigration.[262] In late 2020, Ocasio-Cortez and Rashida Tlaib proposed a public banking bill to encourage creation of state and local public banks by giving them access to facilities from the Federal Reserve and setting national guidelines on public banking.[263] In April 2021, Ocasio-Cortez announced a bill that she and three senators had introduced to implement postal banking pilot programs in rural and low-income urban neighborhoods where millions of households cannot access or afford standard banking services.[223] Ocasio-Cortez has been a vocal supporter of labor rights, including a $15 per hour federal minimum wage.[264] In May 2019, she returned to bartending at the Queensboro Restaurant in Jackson Heights, Queens, to promote the Raise the Wage Act, which would increase the minimum hourly wage for restaurant servers and other tipped workers from $2.13 to $15. Speaking to restaurant workers, customers and reporters, she criticized an exemption in U.S. minimum wage law for restaurants and the service sector that allows them to be paid less than $7.25 per hour, saying, \"Any job that pays $2.13 per hour is not a job, it is indentured servitude.\"[265][266] On January 20, 2021, Ocasio-Cortez skipped the inauguration of Joe Biden in order to join the 2021 Hunts Point Produce Market strike in the Bronx.[267] In September 2019, Ocasio-Cortez introduced an anti-poverty policy proposal (packaged in a bundle called \"A Just Society\") that would take into account the cost of childcare, health care, and \"new necessities\" like Internet access when measuring poverty. The proposal would cap annual rent increases and ensure access to social welfare programs for people with convictions and undocumented immigrants.[268] According to the U.S. census, about 40 million Americans live in poverty. Ocasio-Cortez has proposed a marginal tax as high as 70% on income above $10 million to pay for the Green New Deal. According to tax experts contacted by The Washington Post, this tax would bring in extra revenue of $720 billion per decade.[269][270] But an analysis by the think tank Tax Foundation estimated that, after accounting for macroeconomic effects, the proposal would increase tax revenue by $189.1 billion over ten years if it is applied only to ordinary income, or decrease tax revenue by 53.1 billion if it is applied to all forms of income, including capital gains.[271] Ocasio-Cortez has opposed and voted against the pay-as-you-go rule supported by Democratic leaders, which requires deficit-neutral fiscal policy, with all new expenditures balanced by tax increases or spending cuts. She and Representative Ro Khanna have condemned the rule for hamstringing new or expanded progressive policies.[272][273] Drawing a parallel with the Great Depression, she has argued that the Green New Deal needs deficit spending like the original New Deal.[274] Ocasio-Cortez opposed a planned deal by New York City to give Amazon.com $3 billion in state and city subsidies and tax breaks to build a secondary headquarters (Amazon HQ2) that was expected to bring in $27 billion in tax revenue for the city and state, in an area near her congressional district, saying that the city should instead itself invest $3 billion in the district.[275][276][277] Some commentators criticized her remarks on the grounds that she did not understand tax breaks are discounts on money paid to, not by, the government, that \"New York does not have $3 billion in cash\" it would \"give\" to Amazon, and that between 25,000 and 40,000 new jobs, in addition to the high-paying tech jobs Amazon would have created, disappeared when Amazon left. Conservative columnist Marc Thiessen argued that \"her economic illiteracy is dangerous\" because \"by helping to drive Amazon away, she did not save New York $3 billion; she cost New York $27 billion.\"[278] In 2024, Ocasio-Cortez took part in a live-streamed roundtable with Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan, discussing \"efforts to check unlawful corporate power\".[279] Later, in response to investor and Harris supporter Mark Cuban saying that he wouldn't keep Khan, Ocasio-Cortez said \"anyone goes near Lina Khan and there will be an out and out brawl\".[280] Ocasio-Cortez has called for \"more environmental hardliners in Congress\",[274] calling climate change \"the single biggest national security threat for the United States and the single biggest threat to worldwide industrialized civilization\".[281] Referring to a recent United Nations report indicating that the effects of climate change could become irreversible unless carbon emissions are reined in within the next 12 years, she has argued that global warming must be addressed immediately to avert human extinction.[282][283][284] Ocasio-Cortez's environmental plan, the Green New Deal, advocates for the U.S. to transition to an electrical grid running on 100% renewable energy[192] and to end the use of fossil fuels within ten years. The changes, estimated to cost roughly $2.5 trillion per year, would be financed in part by higher taxes on the wealthy.[285][286][287] She has said she has an \"open mind\" about nuclear power's role in the Green New Deal,[288] but has been criticized for ignoring it in her proposals for the deal.[289][290] In 2024, Ocasio-Cortez, supported by Bowman and Sanders, introduced the \"Green New Deal for Public Housing\", a plan to fund the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) and help it transition to clean energy.[291] Ocasio-Cortez criticized the American companies Activision Blizzard and Apple for censoring pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong.[292] She co-signed a letter to Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick that read, \"As China amplifies its campaign of intimidation, you and your company must decide whether to look beyond the bottom line and promote American values—like freedom of speech and thought—or to give in to Beijing's demands in order to preserve market access.\"[293] A bipartisan letter by Ocasio-Cortez and seven other lawmakers fiercely criticized the NBA's handling of a controversy involving a tweet by Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey supporting pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. The lawmakers wrote that the NBA's response not only \"sold out an American citizen\" but also \"reinforces the Chinese Communist Party view that those who point to Chinese repression in Hong Kong are as best stating opinions, not facts\", as well as being \"a betrayal of fundamental American values\".[294][295][296] Ocasio-Cortez voted to withdraw U.S. military aid for Saudi Arabia's intervention in Yemen,[297] and was among 56 Democrats to vote in favor of H.Con.Res. 21, which directed President Joe Biden to remove U.S. troops from Syria within 180 days.[298][299] Ocasio-Cortez criticized President Trump's administration for escalating tensions with Iran, saying that it would bring the country into a \"military conflict that is completely irresponsible\".[300] Ocasio-Cortez supported the Mahsa Amini protests, saying, \"right to choose belongs to us all, from hijabs to reproductive care\". This was criticized by the conservative Washington Examiner, which said that Iranian repression was not comparable to abortion restrictions.[301] In May 2018, Ocasio-Cortez criticized the Israel Defense Forces' use of deadly force against Palestinians participating in the 2018 Gaza border protests, calling it a \"massacre\" in a tweet.[302][303] In a July 2018 interview, she said she was \"a proponent of a two-state solution\"[247] and called Israel's presence in the West Bank an \"occupation of Palestine\". After being asked to elaborate, she responded she was not \"the expert on geopolitics on this issue\".[304][305] Her use of the term \"occupation\" drew backlash from a number of pro-Israel groups and commentators.[306][304] Others defended her remarks, citing the United Nations' designation of the territory in the West Bank as occupied.[307][308] In July 2019, Ocasio-Cortez voted against a House resolution introduced by Representative Brad Schneider condemning the Global Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions Movement targeting Israel.[309] The resolution passed 398–17.[310] Ocasio-Cortez warned that Israel's planned annexation of Palestinian territories in the occupied West Bank \"would lay the groundwork for Israel becoming an apartheid state\".[311] She wrote to U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that she would work to \"pursue legislation that conditions the $3.8 billion in U.S. military funding to Israel to ensure that U.S. taxpayers are not supporting annexation in any way\".[311] AIPAC condemned the letter, saying it threatened the U.S.-Israel relationship.[312] In May 2021, Ocasio-Cortez issued a statement condemning Israel's evictions of Palestinian families from their homes in Israeli-occupied East Jerusalem.[313] She criticized President Biden for saying Israel \"has a right to defend itself\", arguing that \"blanket statements like these [with] little context or acknowledgement of what precipitated this cycle of violence—namely, the expulsions of Palestinians and attacks on Al Aqsa—dehumanize Palestinians [and] imply the US will look the other way at human rights violations.\"[314] On September 23, 2021, Ocasio-Cortez abruptly changed her vote from \"no\" to \"present\" on a bill providing $1 billion for Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system, citing the \"hateful targeting\" she had received surrounding the bill. She apologized for her vote after receiving criticism on social media from some supporters of Israel and of Palestine but maintained her opposition to the bill due to Israel's \"persistent human rights abuses against the Palestinian people\".[315] On July 18, 2023, Ocasio-Cortez and eight other progressive Democrats (Jamaal Bowman, Cori Bush, Andre Carson, Summer Lee, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley, Delia Ramirez, and Rashida Tlaib), voted against a congressional non-binding resolution proposed by August Pfluger that \"the State of Israel is not a racist or apartheid state\", that Congress rejects \"all forms of antisemitism and xenophobia\", and that \"the United States will always be a staunch partner and supporter of Israel\". She argued that it was wrong to pair \"accusations of antisemitism with real concerns around the human rights crisis in the region\" and that combining a \"vote on antisemitism and discussion of apartheid and...two-tier legal systems is very cynical\".[316] In 2023, Ocasio-Cortez condemned the October 7 attacks, calling them \"horrifying attacks against innocent civilians\".[317] On October 12, she criticized Israel's plans to block electricity, water and fuel from Gaza, calling it a \"collective punishment and a violation of international law\".[318] On October 16, she signed a resolution calling for a ceasefire in the war.[319] On March 22, 2024, she characterized Israel's assault on Gaza and the Gaza Strip famine as genocide.[320] Asked what the Biden administration could have done better in the situation, Ocasio-Cortez said it could have enforced its red line on the Rafah offensive, investigated its weapons shipments to Israel, provided heavier sanctions in response to the occupation of the West Bank, and \"rein in\" Netanyahu.[321] In a separate statement, she called for halting weapons transfers to Israel.[322] In January 2024, the U.S. and other countries cut funding to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) over intelligence reports that certain staff members participated in the Hamas attacks.[323] On January 29, Ocasio-Cortez acknowledged the reports, but said that cutting funding to UNRWA was \"unacceptable\" and that the U.S. \"should restore aid immediately\" because of the agency's humanitarian work.[324] Ocasio-Cortez boycotted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's 2024 speech to Congress, calling him a war criminal.[325] On September 18, 2024, Ocasio-Cortez condemned Israel for the 2024 Lebanon pager explosions.[326] After the contentious confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett, Ocasio-Cortez urged Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden to expand the court if he won and their party achieved a Senate majority.[327] In April 2021, she supported a bill to increase the Court's size.[328] She again called for expansion in September 2021 after the Court voted not to grant an emergency stay of the Texas Heartbeat Bill.[329] In March 2022, Ocasio-Cortez called on Justice Clarence Thomas to resign over his wife's texts urging President Trump's chief of staff to overturn the 2020 presidential election, raising a possible impeachment effort if he did not.[330] After the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022, Ocasio-Cortez called for the impeachment of Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. She alleged that the two had lied under oath about their views on Roe during their confirmation hearings.[331] In June 2022, after the Supreme Court made several consequential rulings and granted certiorari to Moore v. Harper, which has a potential impact on future elections, Ocasio-Cortez tweeted that the U.S. was \"witnessing a judicial coup in progress\".[332][333] The next month, she claimed the Court had \"gone rogue\" and that impeachment, expansion, introduction of ethics rules and recusal requirements should be considered. She added that Thomas should certainly be impeached.[334] Two days later, she led House progressives calling on the Democratic leadership in Congress to strip the Court of its jurisdiction \"in the areas of abortion, marriage equality, non-procreative intimacy, and contraception\". They pointed to Thomas's concurring opinion in Dobbs, which suggested revisiting cases that established a constitutional right to contraception, same-sex marriage, and gay sex.[335] In 2019, Ocasio-Cortez supported pay raises for Congress. She wrote, \"It's not a fun or politically popular position to take. But consistency is important. ALL workers should get cost of living increases. That's why minimum wage should be pegged to inflation, too.\" Members of Congress make $174,000 annually; the Speaker makes $223,500 and House leaders make $193,400. Republican Kevin McCarthy joined her in supporting the pay raise, saying he did not want Congress to be a place where only the wealthy can afford to serve. Colleagues such as Joe Cunningham opposed the measure, saying, \"We didn't come up here to give ourselves a raise\".[336] On June 28, 2018, Ocasio-Cortez told CNN she would support the first impeachment of President Trump, citing Trump's alleged violations of the Emoluments Clause and saying that \"we have to hold everyone accountable and that no person is above that law.\"[337][338] Ocasio-Cortez supported impeaching Trump a second time for his attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election. On January 3, 2021, she said that the Trump–Raffensperger phone call constituted an impeachable offense, and called it a \"despicable abuse of power\".[339] After January 6, she and many other Democrats co-sponsored an article of impeachment against Trump. Ocasio-Cortez said that Trump should be permanently barred from office and impeached.[340] In April 2020, Ocasio-Cortez was one of 77 representatives to call for public reports of data on COVID-19 cases in nursing homes and long-term care facilities.[341] In March 2021, she and Representative Jamaal Bowman called on New York Governor Andrew Cuomo to resign, citing the sexual misconduct allegations against him as well as the New York COVID-19 nursing home scandal about the Cuomo administration's reported undercounting of COVID-19 nursing home deaths.[342] Ocasio-Cortez has called for \"solidarity with Puerto Rico\". She has advocated for granting Puerto Ricans further civil rights, regardless of Puerto Rico's legal classification. She advocates for voting rights and disaster relief. Ocasio-Cortez was critical of FEMA's response to Hurricane Maria and the federal government's unwillingness to address Puerto Rico's political status.[343] She believes the federal government should increase investment in Puerto Rico.[254] In August 2020, Ocasio-Cortez and Nydia Velázquez introduced the Puerto Rico Self-Determination Act of 2020, which was referred to the House Committee on Natural Resources.[344][345] On March 18, 2021, Ocasio-Cortez, Velázquez and Senator Bob Menendez introduced a new version, the Puerto Rico Self-Determination Act of 2021,[346] with over 70 co-sponsors in the House and seven co-sponsors in the Senate, including one Republican.[347] After the June 2024 presidential debate, Ocasio-Cortez, who previously supported Biden during the campaign,[348] said that she had spoken with Biden and that he made clear he was staying in the race. She said that she supported him and that her focus was defeating Republicans in the election.[349][350][351] Later, on July 19, she held an Instagram Live in which she said that replacing Biden was risky and legally challenging, but suggested that nominating Vice President Kamala Harris was better than an open convention.[352] When Biden withdrew from the race, she endorsed Harris.[353] Ocasio-Cortez supports transitioning to a single-payer healthcare system and considers medical care a human right.[354][355] She says that a single government health insurer should cover every American, reducing overall costs.[250] Her campaign website says, \"Almost every other developed nation in the world has universal healthcare. It's time the United States catch up to the rest of the world in ensuring all people have real healthcare coverage that doesn't break the bank.\"[355] Many 2020 Democratic presidential candidates adopted the Medicare-for-all proposal.[252] In June 2019 and in July 2021, Ocasio-Cortez proposed legislation that would remove restrictions placed on researching the medical use of psilocybin.[356][357] Ocasio-Cortez supports codifying the right to abortion, and is a member of the House pro-choice caucus.[358] On July 19, 2022, after the Supreme Court overruled Roe v. Wade in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, she and 17 other members of Congress were arrested in an act of civil disobedience for refusing to clear a street during a protest for reproductive rights outside the Supreme Court Building.[359][360] Ocasio-Cortez campaigned in favor of establishing tuition-free public colleges and trade schools. She has said she is still paying off student loans herself and wants to cancel all student debt.[355] Ocasio-Cortez has expressed support for defunding and abolishing the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency on multiple occasions. In February 2018 she called it \"a product of the Bush-era Patriot Act suite of legislation\" and \"an enforcement agency that takes on more of a paramilitary tone every single day\".[361][362] That June, she said she would \"stop short of fully disbanding the agency\", and would rather \"create a pathway to citizenship for more immigrants through decriminalization\".[363] She later clarified that this does not mean ceasing all deportations.[364] Two days before the primary election, Ocasio-Cortez attended a protest at an ICE child-detention center in Tornillo, Texas.[365] She was the only Democrat to vote against H.R. 648, a bill to fund and reopen the government, because it funded ICE.[366] In June 2019, Ocasio-Cortez compared the detention centers for undocumented immigrants under the Trump administration at the Mexico–United States border to \"concentration camps\". She cited \"expert analysis\", linking to an Esquire article quoting Andrea Pitzer, author of One Long Night: A Global History of Concentration Camps, who had made a similar claim.[367][368] Some academics supported Ocasio-Cortez's use of the term for the forced detention of immigrants;[369][370] others strongly criticized it, saying it showed disrespect for Holocaust victims.[371] In response to criticism from both Republicans and Democrats,[372] Ocasio-Cortez said they had conflated concentration camps (\"the mass detention of civilians without trial\") with death camps.[373] She refused to apologize for using the term: \"If that makes you uncomfortable, fight the camps, not the nomenclature.\"[374] In July 2019, Ocasio-Cortez visited migrant detention centers and other facilities in Texas as part of a congressional delegation to witness the border crisis firsthand. She called the conditions \"horrifying\". She said that women in one cell said they had not had access to showers for two weeks and were told to drink water from the toilet when their sink broke, and that one woman said that her daughters had been taken from her two weeks earlier and she did not know where they were.[375][376] In January 2021, Ocasio-Cortez expressed support for the Roadmap to Freedom resolution to guide future immigration policy championed by Representative Pramila Jayapal. The resolution aims to safeguard vulnerable migrants while reducing criminal prosecutions of migrants.[377] In February 2021, when the Biden administration reopened a Carrizo Springs, Texas, center to house unaccompanied migrant children, Ocasio-Cortez responded that such actions \"never will be okay—no matter the administration or party\".[378] For short-term measures to address the situation, she called for mandatory licensing for such centers and urged reconsideration of how the centers are \"contracted out\".[379] Ocasio-Cortez is a proponent of LGBT+ rights and equality. She has said she supports the community and thanked its members for their role in her campaign.[380][254] At the January 2019 New York City Women's March in Manhattan, Ocasio-Cortez gave a detailed speech in support of measures needed to ensure LGBT+ equality in the workplace and elsewhere.[381] She has also spoken in support of transgender rights, specifically saying, \"Trans rights are civil rights are human rights.\"[382] Later, she appeared on a video game live stream to help raise money for Mermaids, a UK-based charity for transgender children.[383] At the House Committee on Oversight and Reform on February 27, 2020, Ocasio-Cortez argued for LGBTQ equality in the context of her religious background. Referencing a Catholic hospital that refused a hysterectomy for a transgender man,[384] she argued, \"[t]here is nothing holy about rejecting medical care of people, no matter who they are, on the grounds of what their identity is. There is nothing holy about turning someone away from a hospital.\"[385][386] Ocasio-Cortez supports the \"defund the police\" movement. Asked to give her interpretation of the movement, she said: It looks like a suburb ... affluent white communities already ... fund youth, health, housing etc. more than they fund police. When a teenager or preteen does something harmful in a suburb ... White communities bend over backwards to find alternatives to incarceration ... Why don't we treat Black and Brown people the same way?[387] The MIT Lincoln Laboratory named the asteroid 23238 Ocasio-Cortez after her when she was a senior in high school in recognition of her second-place finish in the 2007 Intel International Science and Engineering Fair.[23][24] Ocasio-Cortez was named the 2017 National Hispanic Institute Person of the Year by Ernesto Nieto.[25] In 2019, Ocasio-Cortez received the Adelle Foley Award.[391] She was named as one of the 2019 BBC 100 Women.[392] After the death of Ocasio-Cortez's father in 2008, her mother and grandmother moved to Florida due to financial hardship.[14][35] She still has family in Puerto Rico, where her grandfather was living in a nursing home[343] before he died in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria.[393] Ocasio-Cortez has said that \"to be Puerto Rican is to be the descendant of ... African Moors [and] slaves, Taino Indians, Spanish colonizers, Jewish refugees, and likely others. We are all of these things and something else all at once—we are Boricua.\"[16] She has said she has some Sephardic Jewish ancestry.[394] Ocasio-Cortez is a Catholic. She discussed her faith and its impact on her life and her campaign for criminal justice reform in a 2018 article she wrote for America, the magazine of the Jesuit order in the United States.[395] During the 2018 election campaign, Ocasio-Cortez resided in Parkchester, Bronx, with her partner, web developer Riley Roberts.[396][397][398] They became engaged in April 2022 in Puerto Rico.[399] In 2021, the watchdog group OpenSecrets, analyzing financial disclosure forms, ranked Ocasio-Cortez one of the least wealthy members of the 116th Congress, with a maximum net worth of $30,000.[400] In February 2021, Ocasio-Cortez said that she had been sexually assaulted.[401] That May, she said that she had been in psychotherapy after the January 6 United States Capitol attack, which she called \"extraordinarily traumatizing\", saying she \"did not know if I was going to make it to the end of that day alive\".[402] Ocasio-Cortez is a fan of the New York Yankees.[403]",

                "content": "Conor Anthony McGregor (born 14 July 1988) is an Irish professional mixed martial artist, professional boxer, businessman and actor. He is a former Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) Featherweight and Lightweight Champion, becoming the first UFC fighter to hold UFC championships in two weight classes simultaneously.[10] He is also a former simultaneous Cage Warriors Fighting Championship (CWFC) Featherweight and Lightweight Champion. In 2008, McGregor began competing on the professional mixed martial arts (MMA) circuit in the lightweight and featherweight divisions. In 2012, he won the vacant CWFC Featherweight and Lightweight Championships. A year later, he signed with the UFC. After five straight wins, he challenged for the Interim Featherweight Championship and defeated Chad Mendes at UFC 189. After he knocked out featherweight champion José Aldo in 13 seconds at UFC 194, his fame catapulted tremendously.[11] He made his welterweight debut at UFC 196 where he was defeated by Nate Diaz via submission, marking his first loss in the UFC. In November 2016, he defeated Eddie Alvarez at UFC 205 and won the UFC Lightweight Championship. He briefly transitioned to boxing in 2017, making his professional debut against Floyd Mayweather Jr., where he was defeated via TKO in the 10th round. He returned to MMA and challenged for the UFC Lightweight Championship at UFC 229, losing to lightweight champion Khabib Nurmagomedov via submission. McGregor is the biggest pay-per-view (PPV) draw in MMA history, having headlined the five highest-selling UFC PPV events.[12] His bout with Nurmagomedov at UFC 229 drew 2.4 million PPV buys, the most ever for an MMA event.[13] His 2017 boxing bout with Floyd Mayweather Jr.[14] drew over 5.3 million buys across the United States and the United Kingdom, and became the second highest buy rate in pay-per-view history.[15][16][17] McGregor was ranked as the world's highest-paid athlete by Forbes in 2021, earning a reported $180 million.[18] He also featured in the list in 2018, when he was ranked fourth, with a reported income of $99 million.[19] Outside of his fighting career, McGregor has ventured into business, and is best known for his alcohol-related ventures. Throughout his career, McGregor has become the subject of many controversies due to his behaviour, ranging from driving offences to assault, disorderly conduct and rape. He has made controversial comments about the 2023 Dublin riots, the Irish government's immigration policy and race. In November 2024, the Irish High Court, in a civil case, found that he assaulted and raped a woman in December 2018, ordering him to pay over €248,000 in damages.[20] In December 2024, he was further ordered to pay the entirety of her legal costs, approximately €1,500,000.[21] After the verdict, McGregor was widely condemned, losing several partnership deals. Conor Anthony McGregor[22] was born in Dublin, Ireland.[1] He was raised in Crumlin and attended Irish-language schools — the Gaelscoil Scoil Mológa, in Harold's Cross, at primary level, and Gaelcholáiste Coláiste de hÍde in Tallaght at secondary level, where he also developed his passion for sport, playing football.[23] In his youth, he played football for Lourdes Celtic Football Club.[24] At the age of 12, he also began boxing at Crumlin Boxing Club,[25][26] as a way to defend himself against bullies and raise his confidence. In 2006, McGregor moved with his family to Lucan, Dublin, attending Gaelcholáiste Coláiste Cois Life. Following that, he commenced a plumbing apprenticeship.[27] While in Lucan, he met future UFC fighter Tom Egan and they soon started training mixed martial arts (MMA) together.[28] Among his inspirations growing up were Naseem Hamed, Muhammad Ali and Bruce Lee.[29][30] On 17 February 2007, at the age of 18, McGregor made his mixed martial arts debut in an amateur fight against Kieran Campbell for the Irish Ring of Truth promotion in Dublin. He won via technical knockout (TKO) in the first round. Following the fight, he turned professional and was signed by the Irish Cage of Truth promotion. In 2008, McGregor began training at the Straight Blast Gym (SBG) in Dublin under John Kavanagh.[31] On 9 March 2008, McGregor had his first professional MMA bout, as a lightweight, defeating Gary Morris with a second-round TKO. After McGregor won his second fight against Mo Taylor, he made his featherweight debut in a loss via kneebar against submission specialist Artemij Sitenkov. After a victory at featherweight in his next bout against Stephen Bailey, McGregor contemplated a different career path before his mother contacted his coach John Kavanagh and reinvigorated him to continue pursuing mixed martial arts.[32] McGregor then won his next fight, also at featherweight, against Connor Dillon, before moving back to lightweight for a fight against Joseph Duffy, in which he received his second professional loss after submitting to an arm-triangle choke. Following this, during 2011 and 2012, McGregor went on an eight-fight winning streak,[33] during which he won both the CWFC Featherweight and Lightweight championships, making him the first European professional mixed martial artist to hold titles in two divisions simultaneously.[34] In February 2013, UFC president Dana White made a trip to Dublin, Ireland to receive a Gold Medal of Honorary Patronage from Trinity College and was inundated with requests to sign McGregor to the UFC. After a meeting with McGregor and talking with UFC CEO Lorenzo Fertitta, White offered him a contract days later.[35] In February 2013, the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) announced that they had signed McGregor to a multi-fight contract.[36] In joining, he became only the second fighter from Ireland to compete for the company, following team member Tom Egan. On 6 April 2013, McGregor made his UFC debut against Marcus Brimage at UFC on Fuel TV: Mousasi vs. Latifi.[37] He won the fight by knockout in round one.[38] The win also earned McGregor his first \"Knockout of the Night\" award.[39] McGregor was expected to face Andy Ogle on 17 August 2013 at UFC Fight Night 26, but Ogle pulled out of the bout citing an injury and was replaced by eventual UFC Featherweight Champion Max Holloway.[40] McGregor won the fight by unanimous decision (30–27, 30–27, 30–26). Following the bout with Holloway, an MRI scan revealed that McGregor had torn his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) during the bout and would require surgery, keeping him out of action for up to ten months.[41] McGregor was expected to face Cole Miller on 19 July 2014, at UFC Fight Night 46 in his comeback bout after recovering from his ACL injury.[42] However, Miller pulled out of the bout citing a thumb injury and was replaced by Diego Brandão.[43] McGregor fought Brandão in front of a loud, rowdy crowd of 9,500 at The O2 in his hometown of Dublin, Ireland. The fight was officially halted by referee Leon Roberts at 4:05 of the first round. The win earned McGregor his first Performance of the Night award.[44] Prior to his next bout, McGregor met with Lorenzo Fertitta and signed a new multi-fight contract with the UFC. McGregor next faced Dustin Poirier on 27 September 2014, at UFC 178.[45] Despite McGregor landing only 9 significant strikes to Poirier's 10, he managed to secure a victory early on in the first round, by pressuring Poirier onto his back foot, before exploding with a left hook behind Poirier's ear, forcing referee Herb Dean to step in to end the fight. The finish officially came at 1:46 into the first round.[46][47] This marked Poirier's first UFC loss via KO/TKO and earned McGregor his second straight \"Performance of the Night\" award.[48] McGregor faced Dennis Siver on 18 January 2015 at UFC Fight Night 59.[49][50] He won the fight via TKO in the second round.[51] The victory also earned McGregor his third straight \"Performance of the Night\" award.[52] The highly anticipated bout with Aldo was announced on 30 January 2015, at the UFC 183 Q&A. McGregor declared that he was expected to face Aldo on 11 July 2015 at UFC 189 for the undisputed UFC Featherweight Championship, during the UFC's annual International Fight Week. The fight took place at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada.[53] The UFC, confident that the fight would exceed expectations, increased the promotional budget for the event, with company Dana White stating that \"[the UFC] spent more money promoting Aldo–McGregor than any fight in UFC history.\"[54] The fight against Aldo was announced on 30 January 2015, at the UFC 183 and both McGregor and Aldo embarked on a 12-day world tour, during which eight cities in five countries were visited, including Aldo's home country of Brazil (Rio de Janeiro) and McGregor's hometown of Dublin. The tour began in Rio de Janeiro on 20 March and ended in Dublin on 31 March.[55] However, on 23 June, it was reported that Aldo had suffered a rib fracture and had pulled out of the bout as a consequence.[56][57] McGregor remained on the card and was rescheduled to face Chad Mendes for the Interim Featherweight Championship.[58] The official attendance for the event, 16,019, broke the record in Nevada, while the gate of $7,200,000 broke the record for a mixed martial arts event in the United States.[59] Prior to the fight, McGregor's entrance song, \"The Foggy Dew\", was sung live by Irish singer-songwriter Sinéad O'Connor.[60] McGregor won the fight via TKO, winning the UFC Interim Featherweight Championship.[61][62] McGregor then took part in UFC's The Ultimate Fighter, in which he coached against Urijah Faber.[63] Faber's team member Ryan Hall ended up winning the competition. On 10 August, it was announced that the event would take place on 12 December, when McGregor would face José Aldo for the UFC Featherweight Championship.[64] At the weigh-ins, both McGregor and Aldo achieved the weight limit of 145 pounds.[65][66] McGregor knocked out Aldo thirteen seconds into the first round with a left hook, ending his seven-year-long WEC and UFC title reign and eighteen-fight win streak to claim the title, earning the \"Performance of the Night\" bonus as well.[67][68] This finish marked the fastest knockout in a title bout in UFC history.[69] McGregor faced The Ultimate Fighter Season 5 winner and former UFC Lightweight Championship challenger Nate Diaz on 5 March 2016 at UFC 196 in a welterweight bout.[70] On 24 February 2016, a press conference was held to help promote the new main event, with both men trading insults.[71] At the Thursday pre-fight press conference on 3 March, McGregor and Diaz engaged in a brief scuffle during a face-off, after McGregor landed a strike on Diaz's lead hand.[72] The fight began with combination in the first round, Diaz returned fire with two consecutive hooks, one a slap, a signature of Nate and his brother, Nick Diaz, termed the \"Stockton Slap\". McGregor had success with his bodywork, but Diaz began to land combinations of his own. After a one-two punches from Diaz, McGregor attempted a double leg takedown, which Diaz defended by sprawling. Diaz then threatened the guillotine choke, which forced McGregor onto his back after stopping McGregor from scrambling and Diaz secured the mount and secured a rear naked choke. McGregor tapped to the submission at 4:12 into the second round.[73][74][75] Both competitors were awarded \"Fight of the Night\" bonuses, and McGregor received the highest disclosed purse of any fighter in the history of the company to that point, at $1,000,000.[76][77] McGregor was critical of his own performance while praising Diaz, saying \"I was inefficient with my energy. It was a battle of energy and he got the better of that.\"[78] A rematch with Diaz was scheduled for 9 July at UFC 200; however, on 19 April, the UFC announced that McGregor had been pulled from the event after failing to fulfil media obligations related to the fight.[79][80][81] In turn, the fight with McGregor was rescheduled and took place the following month, contested again at welterweight, at UFC 202.[82] McGregor won the rematch via majority decision (48–47, 47–47, 48–47).[83] The bout was once again awarded \"Fight of the Night\" honours.[84] The event broke the record previously held by UFC 100 for the highest selling pay-per-view in UFC history, with 1,650,000 buys.[85] On 27 September, it was officially announced that McGregor's next bout would be against Eddie Alvarez for the UFC Lightweight Championship on 12 November at UFC 205.[86] After dropping Alvarez multiple times throughout the first round, McGregor landed a multiple-punch combination to stop his opponent via technical knockout in the second round.[87] This result marked the first time a competitor had held UFC championships in two different weight classes, and it also repeated McGregor's feat during his career at Cage Warriors.[88][89] This win earned McGregor the \"Performance of the Night\" and is widely considered one of his best performances inside the octagon.[90][91][92] On 26 November, due to his inactivity in the division, it was initially announced that McGregor had vacated the Featherweight Championship, therefore promoting José Aldo to undisputed champion.[93] McGregor's coach, however, confirmed further reports which stated that McGregor had actually been stripped of the title.[94] After winning the lightweight championship at UFC 205, McGregor announced he would take time off from the UFC to wait for the birth of his first child due in 2017.[95] McGregor spent the majority of his public appearances in early-2017 campaigning for a boxing match with Floyd Mayweather Jr.[96] After months of negotiations, the two finally came to terms on 14 June 2017 and announced the match to take place on 26 August.[97] The match ultimately ended in the 10th round with a victory by TKO for Mayweather.[14] After the conclusion of UFC 223 on 7 April, McGregor was stripped of the UFC Lightweight Championship due to inactivity[10] and Khabib Nurmagomedov was crowned the undisputed champion after defeating Al Iaquinta at the event.[98] On 3 August, it was announced that McGregor would return to the octagon for the first time since November 2016 at UFC 229 to challenge the undefeated Khabib Nurmagomedov for the UFC Lightweight Championship on 6 October.[99] This bout was considered one of the biggest contests in the history of the sport and it was filled with pre-fight hype.[100][101][102] Nurmagomedov submitted McGregor with a neck crank in the fourth round.[103][104] On 26 March 2019, McGregor announced his retirement on social media.[105][106] However, Dana White viewed this announcement as a ploy to secure an ownership stake in the company,[107][108] with White later suggesting his retirement would not last and that he had been in regular contact with him and stated he would fight again in the future.[109] McGregor had previously tweeted that he wanted a rematch with Khabib Nurmagomedov and that he would see him in the Octagon.[110][111] After over a year away from the Octagon, McGregor faced Donald Cerrone in a welterweight bout on 18 January 2020 at UFC 246.[112] He won the fight via technical knockout 40 seconds into the first round.[113] This win earned him a Performance of the Night award.[114] The win made McGregor the first UFC fighter to hold knockout finishes in the featherweight, lightweight and welterweight divisions.[115] On 6 June 2020, McGregor announced once more that he was retiring from fighting.[116] Despite talks of retirement, McGregor was booked to face former UFC Lightweight Championship challenger Dustin Poirier in a rematch of their 2014 bout at UFC 257 on 24 January 2021.[117] He lost the fight via technical knockout in the second round, marking the first knockout loss in his career.[118] McGregor was later handed a 6–month medical suspension after the knockout.[119] McGregor faced Dustin Poirier for a third time on 10 July 2021 at UFC 264.[120] McGregor lost the fight via technical knockout in round one after the ringside doctor stopped the bout. McGregor had rolled his ankle while stepping back, resulting in a broken lower tibia which rendered him unable to continue.[121][122][123] After the layoff nursing his leg injury, McGregor coached The Ultimate Fighter 31 for the second time with the opposing coach being Michael Chandler. Filming of the show started in February 2023[124] and aired on television from May to August 2023.[125] The show led to McGregor being scheduled to fight in a welterweight bout against Chandler at UFC 303 on June 29, 2024.[126] Following speculation on the fight's status due to an abruptly cancelled press conference,[127][128] the UFC officially announced the fight's cancellation on June 13, 2024, citing an injury (broken toe) sustained by McGregor.[129] McGregor is known mostly as a counter-striker[130][131] and prefers to fight standing up, as opposed to on the ground. He is known for his striking precision and knockout power.[132] McGregor is left-handed and primarily fights out of the southpaw stance, but often switches to an orthodox stance. He will frequently try to be the aggressor in his bouts.[1] McGregor's boxing is typically considered his best skill, with the majority of his victories coming by way of knockout or technical knockout via punches.[26] Many pundits cite McGregor's pull-back left-handed counter as his most dangerous strike.[133][134][135] McGregor's signature style off arena is to repeatedly engage in trash talk and \"psychological warfare\" against his opponents, which has led to earning him the moniker 'The Notorious'[136] and has brought comparisons with Muhammad Ali, whom McGregor cites as one of his early inspirations.[137][138][139][140] After Ali died in June 2016, McGregor opined that \"nobody will ever come close to [Ali's] greatness\".[141][142] McGregor has also cited Bruce Lee as an inspiration,[143] and compared himself to Lee.[144] During the buildup to his bout against Donald Cerrone and the rematch against Dustin Poirier, McGregor was respectful towards his opponents and refrained from trash talking.[145][146] However, McGregor heavily used trash talk in the build up to his trilogy fight with Poirier.[147] On 14 June 2017, it was announced that McGregor would compete in his first professional boxing match against the undefeated Floyd Mayweather Jr., on 26 August 2017 at T-Mobile Arena in Paradise, Nevada. The fight was broadcast on Showtime PPV in the US and Sky Sports Box Office in the UK.[148] The bout was contested at super welterweight (154 pounds) with 8 oz. gloves.[149][150] The fight was expected to be the richest in boxing history.[151] On 24 August 2017, it was announced that Mayweather and McGregor would compete for the WBC Money Belt.[152] According to the Nevada State Athletic Commission, Mayweather would earn a guaranteed purse of $100 million and McGregor was guaranteed $30 million.[153] The match resulted in Mayweather winning via TKO in the 10th round, with the scorecards reading 87–83, 89–82, 89–81, all in favour of Mayweather. The Nevada State Athletic Commission announced the live gate for the event was $55,414,865.79 from 13,094 tickets sold.[154] Given the success in pay-per-views, Mayweather reportedly earned around $280 million overall, while McGregor came out with earning $130 million.[155] On 23 November 2023, in response to the stabbing of a woman and three children in Dublin, McGregor made multiple anti-immigration statements, tweeting that \"Ireland is at war\". In response to a tweet by Britain First leader Paul Golding calling on McGregor to lead a \"freedom march\", McGregor condemned the riots that followed the stabbings but tweeted \"Ashling Murphy murdered. Two Sligo men decapitated. This is NOT Ireland's future! If they do not act soon with their plan of action to ensure Ireland's safety, I will.\" He also called for the man who perpetrated the stabbings to be \"tortured and killed\".[156] It was reported on 28 November that McGregor was being investigated as part of a criminal probe into incitement to hatred, following his social media statements following the stabbings.[157] On 26 November 2023, McGregor criticised Taoiseach Leo Varadkar for his views on immigration and for his failure to mention the Palestinian militant group Hamas when he wrote about an Irish hostage released by the group, in which he described her as \"an innocent child who was lost\".[158] It was reported in December 2023 that McGregor was considering running for the office of President of Ireland,[159] to which Elon Musk posted on X \"Not a bad idea.\"[160] As to why he would run, McGregor said, \"Among many other things, the allocation of our nation's funds has been nothing short of criminal, and without an iota of consideration for the public's thinking. ... Our people feel ignored. Unheard. Until of course election time. Then the waffle begins.\"[159] A poll that month found that eight percent of people polled would vote for McGregor for office, while 89 percent said they would not.[161] McGregor has endorsement deals with Beats by Dre, Monster Energy, Reebok and Bud Light.[162][163] In 2017, his endorsement deals rounded up to $7 million.[164] In early 2018, McGregor signed a deal with Burger King.[165] In light of a 2024 Dublin court case, in which McGregor was found to have assaulted and raped a woman in December 2018, McGregor lost his first sponsor when the IO Interactive video game company ceased its collaboration with him.[166][167] After the court case, Rape Crisis Network Ireland called for retailers to stop selling his stout and whiskey brands.[168] Musgrave delisted McGregor-linked drinks,[169] resulting in SuperValu, Costcutter, Centra and Carry Out ceasing to sell McGregor's Forged Irish Stout and Proper No. Twelve whiskey.[170] Tesco and Ocado additionally pulled all alcoholic products associated with McGregor from their stores,[171][172] alongside Wetherspoons, Asda, and BWG Group who stopped stocking Proper No. Twelve whiskey.[173][174] Irish airports in Cork and Dublin also pulled McGregor-related alcohol products from their airport bars.[175] Just ahead of his fight with Mayweather, McGregor announced a fashion partnership with tailoring brand David August; the brand is named \"August McGregor\" and is aimed at providing modern men's suits to millennials.[176] August had met McGregor about three years earlier, via Dana White.[177] In September 2018, McGregor launched Proper No. Twelve Irish whiskey in Ireland and the United States.[178] The whiskey is named after the Crumlin neighbourhood in Dublin 12, in which McGregor grew up.[179] In 2021, it was reported that McGregor and his business partners sold their majority stake in the Proper No. Twelve company to Proximo Spirits, who previously had a 49% stake, for a deal worth a reported $600 million.[180][181] In the aftermath of a 2024 Dublin court case, in which McGregor was found to have assaulted and raped a woman in December 2018, Proximo Spirits announced it would no longer use McGregor's name or image on the drink.[182] In an August 2022 interview Artem Lobov alleged that McGregor was initially headed towards creating a vodka product, but it was Lobov who pitched the idea of doing a whiskey instead.[183] In the same interview, Lobov also stated that he was the one who did the background study and conducted business deals for the product.[183] In late November 2022, news surfaced that Lobov had sued McGregor, seeking five percent of the proceeds of the $600 million deal conducted in 2021.[184] Following the suing, McGregor aimed several social media messages at Lobov, who subsequently filed another lawsuit against McGregor for defamation, intimidation and harassment.[185] In January 2023, the latter lawsuit was denied by the judge and Lobov was ordered to pay the legal fees.[186] In 2020, McGregor purchased a pub in South Dublin, renaming it to the Black Forge Inn.[187] In 2022, the Black Forge Inn was targeted by petrol bombs.[188] He purchased a second pub in 2021, the Marble Arch.[189] McGregor had previously assaulted a man at the Marble Arch on 6 April 2019.[190] McGregor officially launched Forged Irish Stout in 2021. In 2024, complaints about the sexualised nature of its advertising were upheld by the Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland.[191] In 2022, McGregor was cast along with the actor Jake Gyllenhaal in a remake of the 1989 film Road House.[192] On April 27, 2024, it was announced that McGregor and his company \"McGregor Sports and Entertainment\" were now part-owners of Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship (BKFC).[193][194][195] McGregor has since appeared at multiple BKFC events. McGregor has two sisters named Erin and Aoife.[196] He has been in a relationship with his fiancée, Dee Devlin, since 2008.[197] They have four children.[198] McGregor often trains at the Mjölnir gym in Reykjavík, alongside fellow UFC fighter Gunnar Nelson.[199][200][201] He has stated that he does not adhere to any pre-fight rituals or superstitions because he believes them to be \"a form of fear\".[202][203] McGregor is a Catholic.[204] McGregor is a football fan and a supporter of both Celtic and Manchester United.[205][206] He has also expressed support for Paris Saint-Germain, being a friend of Sergio Ramos.[207] In November 2017 McGregor pleaded guilty to exceeding the speed limit in Rathcoole, County Dublin.[208] He was fined €400.[208] In November 2018 he pleaded guilty to speeding in Kill, County Kildare,[209] and was fined €1,000 and disqualified from driving for six months.[209] On 22 March 2022, McGregor was arrested in Dublin and charged with six driving offences, including two counts of dangerous driving, being uninsured, having no licence and failing to produce his documents. His car was seized by the Irish police.[210] He was released on bail and his car was returned to him. He was scheduled to appear before Blanchardstown district court in April 2022, and, if convicted, could be subject to a fine of up to €5,000, six months' imprisonment or both.[211][212][213] On 23 June 2022, McGregor appeared in Blanchardstown District Court in relation to events on 22 March 2022.[214][215] He was remanded on continuing bail pending \"further charges\" as part of a dangerous driving prosecution.[214][215] He has not yet indicated a plea and the judge remanded him to appear on 8 September 2022 for directions from the Director of Public Prosecutions.[214][215] On 8 September he was charged with an additional charge of careless driving, adding to the six charges he already faced over the incident: two charges of dangerous driving, two of allegedly driving with no license or insurance and two of failing to produce either license or insurance.[216] The trial was originally set to begin in January 2023, but after McGregor's defence argued to the court that he could not attend the trial then due to being unwell,[217] the judge in the case ordered the trial to start on 31 July 2024.[217] Ahead of his 2015 bout with Brazilian fighter José Aldo, McGregor was accused of racially taunting Aldo.[218] In 2017, McGregor was accused of racism, after taunting boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr. ahead of their August 26 boxing match. McGregor told the 46-year-old to \"Dance for me, boy,\" at a promotional event in Los Angeles, before urging the crowd to yell obscenities at Mayweather, his wife and children. Mayweather told reporters at a fan meet in London: \"He totally disrespected Black women, he called Black people monkeys, and he was disrespectful to my [13-year-old] daughter.\"[219] McGregor responded in a lengthy post via Instagram, stating: \"Floyd Mayweather, don't ever bring race into my success again. I am an Irishman. My people have been oppressed our entire existence. And still very much are. I understand the feeling of prejudice. It is a feeling that is deep in my blood. In my family's long history of warfare there was a time where just having the name 'McGregor' was punishable by death. Do not ever put me in a bracket like this again...\"[220] On 10 November 2017, McGregor's SBG Ireland teammate Charlie Ward made his debut at Bellator 187 in Dublin against John Redmond.[221] Ward knocked out Redmond in round one,[222] and McGregor jumped the cage (he was not a licensed cornerman) to celebrate Ward's win while the fight was not yet officially declared over.[223] McGregor was separated by referee Marc Goddard, as Goddard needed to verify if the knockout was before the bell, and to ensure lock down of the cage for medical staff to assess the health of the knocked out Redmond. McGregor charged towards Goddard: while he pushed and confronted Goddard in a wild melee, he also checked on the downed Redmond and knocked him down while he was trying to get up.[224] McGregor did a lap around the cage after he exited the cage a few minutes later, then climbed and straddled the cage apron to continue the celebration of Ward's win. He was stopped by a commissioner and McGregor, agitated, slapped the commissioner's face.[225][226] Redmond stated after the fight that Goddard intended to let the fight continue to round two, but the Mohegan Sun commission, which oversaw the event, elected to end the fight due to McGregor's behaviour in the ring.[227] A day after the incident, the head of the commission for Bellator 187, Mike Mazzulli, the president of both the Mohegan Tribe Department of Athletic Regulation (MTDAR) and Association of Boxing Commissions, issued a statement, stating that \"McGregor's conduct jeopardized the health and safety\" of fighters who were in the cage during the Ireland event. In addition, Mr McGregor assaulted Referee Mark Goddard and a (member of) Bellator staff.\"[228] On 3 April 2018, Khabib Nurmagomedov and his entourage cornered and slapped Artem Lobov at a hotel in Brooklyn, New York.[229][230] Lobov is known to be close to McGregor, with whom Nurmagomedov has had altercations and trash talk exchanges.[231] The two groups have a lengthy history of insults and confrontations. On 5 April 2018, during promotional appearances for UFC 223, McGregor and a group of about twenty others were let into the Barclays Center by credentialled members of his promotional team. They attempted to confront Nurmagomedov, who was on a bus leaving the arena with \"red corner\" fighters for UFC 223 on it, such as Rose Namajunas, Al Iaquinta, Karolina Kowalkiewicz, Ray Borg and Michael Chiesa.[232] McGregor ran up alongside the slowly moving bus and then ran past it to grab a metal equipment dolly, which he then threw at the bus's window, before trying to throw other objects in the vicinity.[233] Chiesa and Borg were injured by the shattered glass and sent to hospital. They were soon removed from the card on the advice of the NYSAC and the UFC's medical team.[234] Lobov was also pulled from his fight for his involvement in the dispute. Dana White said there was a warrant out for McGregor's arrest and the NYPD said McGregor was a person of interest.[235] White said McGregor had told him via text message: \"This had to be done.\"[236] \"You can imagine he's going to be sued beyond belief\", White said, and denied suggestions that the violence was a publicity stunt intended to generate interest in the UFC.[237] McGregor and others involved initially fled the Barclays Center after the incident,[238] although he and a fellow accused turned themselves in that night. McGregor was charged with three counts of assault and one count of criminal mischief.[239][240] He was further charged with menacing and reckless endangerment at his arraignment and was released on $50,000 bail until 14 June 2018.[241][242] Under the bail conditions negotiated by his then attorney, Jim Walden, and set by the judge, McGregor was allowed to travel without restriction.[243][244] On 12 April 2018, McGregor hired lawyer Bruce Mafeo of Cozen O'Connor to represent him in this matter.[245] McGregor pleaded no contest to a count of disorderly conduct and was ordered to perform five days of community service and attend anger management classes.[246] On 12 September 2018, Chiesa announced a lawsuit against McGregor, saying that he \"experienced pain, suffering and a loss of enjoyment of life\" as a result of the attack.[247] Following the fight at UFC 229 on 6 October 2018, Khabib Nurmagomedov jumped out of the cage and charged towards McGregor's training partner Dillon Danis. Soon afterwards, McGregor and Abubakar Nurmagomedov, Khabib's cousin, also attempted to exit the octagon, but a scuffle broke out after McGregor punched Abubakar, who then punched him back.[248] Two of Nurmagomedov's cornermen retaliated: Esed Emiragaev and Zubaira Tukhugov.[249] Tukhugov was scheduled to fight on 27 October 2018 at UFC Fight Night: Volkan vs. Smith against Artem Lobov, the McGregor team member who was confronted by Nurmagomedov in April 2018. Nurmagomedov's payment for the fight was withheld by the Nevada State Athletic Commission (NSAC) as a result, pending an investigation into his actions. Nurmagomedov appeared at the post-fight interview and apologized to the NSAC.[250] The NSAC filed a formal complaint against both McGregor and Nurmagomedov, and on 24 October, the NSAC voted to release half of Nurmagomedov's $2 million fight payout immediately.[251] Both Nurmagomedov and McGregor received indefinite bans, at least until the official hearing, which took place in December 2018.[252] On 29 January 2019, the NSAC announced a six-month suspension for McGregor (retroactive to 6 October 2018) and a $50,000 fine. He became eligible to compete again on 6 April 2019.[253] In March 2019, The New York Times reported that McGregor was under investigation by the Garda Síochána (police), following allegations of a sexual assault on a woman in a Dublin hotel in December 2018.[254][255] A second allegation of sexual assault was reported in October 2019, regarding an assault on a woman in a car alleged to have taken place earlier that month.[256] In January 2021, after prosecutors declined to prosecute McGregor for the 2018 alleged sexual assault, a civil claim for damages was launched in the High Court. A spokeswoman for McGregor said in a statement that the allegations against him were \"categorically rejected\" and that he was \"confident that justice will prevail\" in the civil case.[257][258] In March 2022, the High Court made a pre-trial discovery order against McGregor requiring the Gardaí to disclose certain information and documents gathered by them.[259] The civil action was taken against McGregor by Nikita Hand, who alleged he violently beat and raped her in Dublin in December 2018. The trial began in the High Court in Dublin on 5 November 2024, with Mr Justice Alexander Owens as judge.[260][261][262] On 22 November 2024, the jury returned their verdict and found that McGregor had raped Hand. Accordingly, McGregor was ordered to pay Hand nearly €250,000 in damages.[263][264][265][266] On 5 December 2024, Justice Owens ordered McGregor to pay the entirety of Hand's legal costs, approximately €1,500,000, and said that he may begin contempt of court proceedings against McGregor for his comments about the case on social media after it concluded.[267][268][269] After the trial, McGregor indicated on social media that he planned to appeal the verdict, and Hand said she hoped that the case would encourage victims of assault to continue \"pushing forward for justice\". The Irish Minister for Justice, Helen McEntee, praised Hand's bravery and determination, and the Taoiseach, Simon Harris, had a phone conversation with Hand before complimenting her \"bravery and courage\" when speaking to the media.[270][271][272] It also emerged that Hand's partner had been stabbed and windows were smashed when attackers wearing balaclavas invaded their home in June 2024. This information was withheld from the jury during the trial.[273] In light of the court ruling, IO Interactive ceased its collaboration with McGregor, removing content that featured him from their Hitman video game series.[274] The Rape Crisis Network Ireland also called for retailers to stop selling his stout and whiskey brands.[275] Various retailers and Irish wholesalers, including the Musgrave Group, announced that they would no longer stock his beer brand or whiskey, which would see the brands removed from SuperValu, Centra, Tesco Ireland, Spar, Mace and Londis stores, among others.[276] A few days after the verdict, Proper No. Twelve-parent company Proximo Spirits announced it would no longer feature McGregor in association with the brand.[277] Wetherspoons and other pub chains likewise stopped selling McGregor's stout brand.[278] On 11 March 2019, McGregor was arrested outside of the Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami Beach, Florida, after he attacked a fan taking a picture with a cellphone. In an incident that was caught on a security camera, McGregor lunged to hit the man, grabbed his device and smashed it on the ground with his feet. Subsequently, he was arrested and charged with strong-armed robbery and criminal mischief.[279] McGregor was held in custody for several hours before being released on a $5,000 bond. On 14 March 2019, news surfaced that McGregor was also facing a civil lawsuit from the fan involved in the incident.[280] On 8 April, the civil lawsuit against McGregor was dropped by the fan.[281] On 13 May, it was revealed that the criminal charges against McGregor had also been dropped after the accuser's attorney said that his client had \"been made whole\" by McGregor, in a reference to an out-of-court settlement that was reached.[282][283] On 15 August 2019, TMZ Sports published a video that showed McGregor punching an older man at The Marble Arch Pub in Dublin.[190] The incident happened on 6 April and was originally reported by Irish media, although without the video that showed the attack.[284] McGregor had repeatedly offered the victim a shot of his whiskey, which the victim repeatedly declined, then McGregor had punched him.[284] Irish police stated that they had opened an investigation.[285] McGregor was charged with assault and first appeared in court on 11 October 2019.[284] The court heard that McGregor had 18 prior convictions from 2018 going back to 2009.[284] The majority were for driving offences, but he was given the Probation Act in 2009 when he was an apprentice plumber for an assault causing harm offence.[284] On 1 November, McGregor pleaded guilty to the assault and was fined €1,000.[286][284] On 10 September 2020, McGregor was arrested on the French island of Corsica on suspicion of attempted sexual assault and indecent exposure for an incident alleged to have taken place in a bar. After being held in custody for two days while being interviewed by police, he was released without charge.[287][288][289] Eight months later, French authorities dropped the investigation due to insufficient evidence.[290][291] On 17 October 2021, McGregor allegedly assaulted Francesco Facchinetti, an Italian musician and TV presenter, in a nightclub in Rome, breaking Facchinetti's nose in front of witnesses and bodyguards. A few days later, Facchinetti filed charges against McGregor for the attack.[292][293][294][295][296] In January 2023, McGregor was accused of assaulting a 42-year-old woman aboard his yacht in Ibiza, Spain, during his birthday party on 22 July 2022. The woman claimed she was berated by McGregor before being physically assaulted. She further claimed that she was forced to jump from the yacht to escape McGregor and that she sustained a broken arm in the process. The woman did not file a formal statement with Spanish police at the time of the incident. In January, she gave a formal statement with Irish police, who then shared that statement with their Spanish counterparts. The woman has also filed a civil suit against McGregor over the alleged incident.[297][298][299] After making her formal statement, the woman's car was set ablaze outside of her Dublin home.[300] In February, a brick was reportedly thrown through a window of that residence.[301] In late February 2023, news surfaced that the lawsuit was discontinued by the plaintiff, with no further information provided.[302] On 10 June 2023, McGregor appeared at Game Four of the 2023 NBA Finals in Miami, Florida, to promote his pain relief spray in a planned skit with the Miami Heat's mascot, Burnie. McGregor proceeded to punch the man wearing the mascot costume (Heat dancer Chris Brown) once and \"knock him out\", but then he dealt a second, powerful and apparently off-script punch to Brown's jaw while Brown was on the ground. Brown was subsequently treated in a local hospital emergency room and later released. Most of the crowd in attendance booed McGregor for his actions.[303][304] On 13 June, three days after the incident, McGregor claimed that \"it was a skit\" and that \"all is well\" between the two.[305][306] On 11 June 2023, Miami police received a report that McGregor had sexually assaulted a woman the previous night in a restroom at the Miami Heat arena after Game Four of the NBA Finals.[307] McGregor released a statement via the Kessler PR Group, a public relations and crisis management group, denying the allegation.[308] On 18 October, the case was dropped.[309] [369]",

                "title": "Aaron Rodgers - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Aaron Charles Rodgers (born December 2, 1983) is an American professional football quarterback for the New York Jets of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the California Golden Bears (where he set several career passing records, including lowest single-season and career interception rates[1]), before being selected in the first round of the 2005 NFL draft by the Green Bay Packers, spending 18 seasons with the team.[2] He is regarded among the greatest[3] and most talented quarterbacks of all time.[4] After backing up Brett Favre for the first three years of his NFL career, Rodgers became the Packers' starting quarterback in 2008. In the 2010 season, he led them to a victory in Super Bowl XLV, earning the Super Bowl MVP. He was named Associated Press Athlete of the Year in 2011,[5] and was voted league MVP by the Associated Press for the 2011, 2014, 2020, and 2021 NFL seasons. Rodgers is the fifth player to win NFL MVP in consecutive seasons, joining Peyton Manning, Favre, Joe Montana and Jim Brown. Rodgers has led the NFL six times in touchdown-to-interception ratio (2011, 2012, 2014, 2018, 2020, 2021);[6] six times in lowest passing interception percentage (2009, 2014, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021);[7] four times in passer rating (2011, 2012, 2020, 2021);[8] and four times in touchdown passing percentage (2011, 2012, 2020, 2021);[9] three times in total touchdowns (2011, 2016, 2020); twice in touchdown passes (2016, 2020)[10] and once in yards per attempt (2011) and completion percentage (2020).[11] Rodgers is first on the NFL's all-time regular-season career passer rating list, with a regular-season career passer rating of over 100 (the first to ever have a career rating over 100) while also having had the highest passer rating, the best touchdown-to-interception ratio and the lowest passing interception percentage in NFL history throughout the entire 2010s decade. In the postseason, he is second in both touchdown passes and touchdown-to-interception ratio, fourth in passing yards, and fifth in all-time passer rating. In the regular season, he has the best touchdown-to-interception ratio in NFL history at 4.53,[12] holds the league's lowest career interception percentage at 1.4 percent[13] and the highest single-season passer rating record of 122.5.[14] Rodgers is also a four-time winner of the Best NFL Player ESPY Award. Rodgers was born on December 2, 1983, in Chico, California,[15] the son of Darla Leigh (née Pittman) and Edward Wesley Rodgers. His father is a Texas-born chiropractor who played football as an offensive lineman for the Chico State Wildcats from 1973 to 1976.[16][17] Rodgers is of English, Irish and German ancestry.[16] The family moved to Ukiah, California, where he attended Oak Manor Elementary School.[18] Edward Rodgers tossed a football with his sons Luke, Aaron and Jordan Rodgers, and told them not to drink and not to party in college or they would limit themselves in sports like he did. Aaron took this advice to heart.[17] At the age of ten, he was featured on the front page of the Ukiah Daily Journal for his top performance at a local basketball free throw competition.[18] Later, the family moved to Beaverton, Oregon, where Rodgers attended Vose Elementary School and Whitford Middle School, and played baseball in the Raleigh Hills Little League at shortstop, center field and pitcher.[19] The Rodgers family returned to Chico in 1997, and Aaron attended Pleasant Valley High School, starting for two years at quarterback and garnering 4,421 passing yards.[20] He set single-game records of six touchdowns and 440 all-purpose yards. Rodgers set a single-season school record with 2,466 total yards in 2001.[21] He graduated from Pleasant Valley High School in spring 2002, after scoring 1310 in the SAT and with an A− average.[22][23][24] Despite his impressive high school record, Rodgers attracted little interest from Division I programs.[25] In a 2011 interview with E:60, he attributed the relative lack of attention in the recruiting process to his unimposing physical stature as a high school player at 5'10\" (1.78 m) and 165 lb (75 kg). Rodgers wanted to attend Florida State and play under head coach Bobby Bowden, but was rejected.[26] He was only offered an opportunity to compete for a scholarship as a walk-on from University of Illinois.[27] He declined the invitation, and considered quitting football to play baseball instead or giving up entirely on the idea of playing in professional sports and attending law school after completing his undergraduate degree.[28] He was then recruited to play football at Butte College in Oroville, a junior college about 15 miles (25 km) southeast of Chico.[29] Rodgers threw 26 touchdowns in his freshman season at Butte,[30][31] leading the school to a 10–1 record, the NorCal Conference championship,[32] and a No. 2 national ranking. While there, he was discovered by the California Golden Bears' head coach Jeff Tedford, who was recruiting Butte tight end Garrett Cross.[33] Tedford was surprised to learn that Rodgers had not been recruited earlier. Because of Rodgers' good high school scholastic record, he was eligible to transfer to the University of California, Berkeley after one year of junior college instead of the typical two.[34] As a junior college transfer, Rodgers had three years of eligibility at Cal. He was named the starting quarterback in the fifth game of the 2003 season, beating the only team that offered him a Division I opportunity out of high school, Illinois.[35] As a sophomore, he helped lead the Golden Bears to a 7–3 record as a starter.[1][36] In his second career start, Rodgers led the team to a 21–7 halftime lead against #3 USC. Due to injury, Rodgers was replaced in the second half by Reggie Robertson.[37][38] The Bears won in triple overtime, 34–31.[37][39] Rodgers passed for 394 yards and was named game MVP in the Insight Bowl against Virginia Tech.[40][41] In 2003, Rodgers tied the school season record for 300-yard games with five and set a school record for the lowest percentage of passes intercepted at 1.43%.[42] As a junior, Rodgers led Cal to a 10–1 record and top-five ranking at the end of the regular season, with their only loss a 23–17 loss at No. 1 USC.[43] In that game, Rodgers set a school record for consecutive completed passes with 26 and tied an NCAA record with 23 consecutive passes completed in one game.[44] He set a Cal single-game record for passing completion percentage of 85.3.[45][46] Rodgers holds the Cal career record for lowest percentage of passes intercepted at 1.95 percent.[42] Rodgers' performance set up the Golden Bears at first and goal with 1:47 remaining and a chance for the game-winning touchdown. On the first play of USC's goal line stand, Rodgers threw an incomplete pass. This was followed by a second-down sack by Manuel Wright.[47] After a timeout and Rodgers' incomplete pass on third down, USC stopped Cal's run play to win the game.[47] Rodgers commented that it was \"frustrating that we couldn't get the job done.\"[47] Overall, he finished the 2004 season with 2,566 passing yards, 24 touchdowns, and eight interceptions. His 66.1% pass completion percentage led the Pac-10.[48][49] He finished ninth in Heisman Trophy voting.[50] After Texas was picked over Cal for a Rose Bowl berth, the fourth-ranked Bears were awarded a spot in the Holiday Bowl, which they lost to Texas Tech, 45–31.[51] After the season, Rodgers decided to forgo his senior season to enter the 2005 NFL draft.[52] Rodgers was expected to be selected early in the 2005 NFL Draft as he had posted impressive numbers as a junior with Cal, throwing for 2,320 yards with a 67.5 completion rate in the regular season. He threw for 24 touchdowns and only eight interceptions in his last college season, impressing many NFL scouts. They commented that he was a \"talented strong-armed junior\"[54] who \"combines arm strength, mechanics and delivery to make all the throws\", but noted that his stats could be inflated due to playing in a quarterback-friendly system and that he would need to adjust to the more elaborate defensive schemes of the NFL.[54] Before the draft, Rodgers was confident that he would be drafted to the team he supported and grew up near,[58] the San Francisco 49ers, who possessed the No. 1 overall pick in the draft.[59] The 49ers, however, drafted quarterback Alex Smith out of Utah instead, and Rodgers slid all the way down to the 24th overall pick by the Green Bay Packers. Rodgers has said that he experienced much angst and restlessness when waiting to be selected several hours into the draft, as he had expected himself to be selected much sooner.[58] Rodgers' slip to the 24th selection and the Packers choosing to pick Brett Favre's future replacement became one of the biggest stories of the draft, though he was still the second quarterback selected. His drop in the draft was later ranked number one on the NFL Network's Top 10 Draft Day Moments.[60] Many teams drafting between the second and 23rd positions had positional needs more pressing than quarterback.[61][62] Rodgers is one of six quarterbacks coached by Jeff Tedford to be drafted in the first round of an NFL draft, joining Trent Dilfer, Akili Smith, David Carr, Joey Harrington and Kyle Boller.[63] In August 2005, Rodgers agreed to a reported five-year, $7.7 million deal that included $5.4 million in guaranteed money and had the potential to pay him as much as $24.5 million if all incentives and escalators were met.[64] Rodgers spent his rookie season as the Packers' backup quarterback behind Brett Favre.[65] The Packers were 4–12 at this point and he received his first extended look in the opening preseason game against the San Diego Chargers after replacing Favre.[66] In his first NFL game, Rodgers completed two out of seven passes and was sacked twice. He continued to struggle through the preseason, before ending the preseason by converting two third downs and throwing a touchdown pass to tight end Ben Steele against the Tennessee Titans.[67] Once the regular season began, Rodgers saw very little action that year. He played against the New Orleans Saints in the fourth quarter of a 52–3 victory, and completed his first career pass to fullback Vonta Leach for 0 yards.[68] On December 19, 2005, Rodgers entered the game against the Baltimore Ravens at the end of the third quarter in a 48–3 loss.[68] He completed eight of 15 passes for 65 yards and an interception.[69] After the Packers' losing season, head coach Mike Sherman was fired and replaced by Mike McCarthy.[70][71] Rodgers was then placed in McCarthy's \"Quarterback school\" for six hours a day several times a week.[72] This focused on working on Rodgers' motor skills such as hand-eye coordination, finger dexterity, and mechanics.[73] McCarthy also worked on Rodgers' release point, moving it from right beside the ear hole of his helmet to further below it, to give him a smoother release.[74] When the 2006 preseason began, Rodgers played as the backup in all four games; he completed 22 out 38 passes for 323 yards and three touchdowns.[68] Rodgers saw very little action during the 2006 season, but did step in briefly on October 2 against the Philadelphia Eagles when Favre left the game due to injury.[68] On November 19, 2006, Rodgers broke his left foot while playing against the New England Patriots in a 35–0 defeat at home, filling in for an injured Favre, and Rodgers missed the remainder of the 2006 season.[72] Following the team's season-ending victory at Chicago, Favre announced that he would stay with the Packers for the 2007 season, again postponing Rodgers' hopes of becoming the Packers' starting quarterback.[75] Prior to the 2007 season, rumors surfaced about a potential trade involving Rodgers in which he would be traded to the Oakland Raiders for wide receiver Randy Moss.[76] However, Moss was traded to the Patriots during the second day of the 2007 NFL draft, and Rodgers stayed in Green Bay.[77] Rodgers stepped in when Favre was injured in the second quarter against the Dallas Cowboys on Thursday Night Football on November 29, 2007.[78] Rodgers completed 18 passes for 201 yards, with no interceptions.[78] He also threw his first touchdown pass but was sacked three times.[78] Rodgers brought the team back from a 17-point deficit to a 3-point deficit, but the Cowboys went on to win 37–27.[78] Favre's retirement announcement on March 4, 2008, opened up the Packers' starting quarterback position to Rodgers for the 2008 season. Although Favre decided to return from retirement, he was traded to the New York Jets, which meant that Rodgers would become the starter.[79] Rodgers quickly proved that he was one of the best quarterbacks in the league by passing for 4,038 yards in his first season as a starter as well as throwing for 28 touchdowns and only 13 interceptions. As of the 2023 season, this still stands as the most interceptions he has thrown in a season.[80] With Rodgers making his debut as a starter, the Packers beat the Minnesota Vikings 24–19 at Lambeau Field. This marked the first time since 1992 that a quarterback other than Favre started a regular season game for the Packers. Rodgers ended the game with 178 yards passing and two touchdowns (one passing and one rushing).[81] In just his second NFL start the following week, Rodgers was voted the FedEx Air award winner after passing for 328 yards and three touchdowns in a win against the Lions.[82] During the fourth week of the season, Rodgers' streak of 157 consecutive pass attempts without an interception ended when he was intercepted by Derrick Brooks of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The streak was the third-longest in franchise history behind Bart Starr (294) and Brett Favre (163).[83] Rodgers suffered a severe shoulder sprain in the game but continued to start and played well in a win against the Seattle Seahawks two weeks later.[84] Despite early successes, Rodgers had been unable to win a close game during the season despite seven opportunities to do so.[84][85] On October 31, 2008, Rodgers signed a six-year, $65 million contract extension through the 2014 season.[86][87] In Rodgers' first full season with the team, the Packers finished with a 6–10 record and missed the playoffs.[88] For the opening game of the 2009 season, Rodgers recorded his first win in a comeback situation. The Packers were trailing at the beginning of the fourth quarter when Rodgers completed a fifty-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Greg Jennings with about a minute remaining in the game to contribute to the 21–15 victory over the Chicago Bears.[89] Rodgers was named NFC Offensive Player of the Month for October 2009, when he passed for 988 yards, completed 74.5 percent of his passes, and recorded a passer rating over 110 for all three games played during the month.[90] After a 4–4 start to the season and a 38–28 loss to the previously winless Buccaneers,[91] the team began to heat up. Rodgers led the Packers to five straight wins, in which he threw for a total of 1,324 yards, nine touchdowns, and two interceptions.[92] Rodgers and the Packers won two of their last three games, finishing the second half of the season with a 7–1 record and an overall 11–5 record; good enough to secure a wild card playoff berth and clinch the fifth seed in the playoffs.[93][94] The Packers set a new franchise record by scoring 461 total points (third in the league), breaking the previous record held by the 1996 Super Bowl team (456).[95][96] Rodgers became the first quarterback in NFL history ever to throw for 4,000 yards in both of his first two years as a starter.[97] He finished the season fourth in passing yards (4,434), touchdown passes (30), passer rating (103.2), and yards per attempt (8.2) as well as eighth in completion percentage (64.7%), while also coming second among quarterbacks in rushing yards (316).[98] His passing yardage made him second all-time in Packers history, behind only Lynn Dickey's all-time single-season record.[99] His passer rating of 103.2 was also third-highest in team history at the time, behind only Bart Starr's 105.0 rating in 1966 and 104.3 rating in 1968 (minimum 150 attempts).[100] In the Wild Card Round, the Packers played the Arizona Cardinals, the same team they had previously beaten the week before, 33–7.[101] Rodgers and Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner put on a show that later ranked second on NFL Network's Top 10 Quarterback Duels.[102] Rodgers' first pass was intercepted by Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie.[103] Rodgers settled down after that miscue, however, and finished the game completing 28 of 42 passes for 423 yards, with four touchdown passes all in a second-half comeback. His 423 passing yards are the most by any quarterback in his first playoff game as well as his four touchdown passes and five total touchdowns.[104] Warner shredded the Packers' second-ranked defense, completing 29 of 33 passes for 379 yards, five touchdowns, no interceptions, and a passer rating of 154.1. Despite Rodgers' offensive efforts, the Packers lost the game when he fumbled on a controversial play in overtime. The ball was returned by Karlos Dansby for the winning touchdown in the 51–45 Cardinals victory.[105] It was the highest scoring playoff game in NFL history.[106] Due to his regular season performance, Rodgers earned a trip to his first Pro Bowl as the NFC's third quarterback, behind Drew Brees and Brett Favre. However, after Favre dropped out due to injury and Brees was replaced due to his participation in Super Bowl XLIV, Rodgers became the NFC's starter.[107] In 2010, Rodgers led the Packers to a 2–0 start, but then lost three of their next four games, including back-to-back overtime losses. The two overtime defeats brought Rodgers' record in overtime games to 0–5.[108] At midseason, Rodgers had already thrown nine interceptions compared to only throwing seven all of the previous season, and was 16th in the league with an 85.3 passer rating.[109] Over the remainder of the regular season, however, his play improved as he threw 16 touchdowns to only two interceptions, completed 71.4% of his passes, and had a passer rating of 122.0.[110] In Week 13, in a 34–16 victory over the San Francisco 49ers, Rodgers had 298 passing yards and three touchdowns to earn his first career NFC Offensive Player of the Week honor.[111][112] In Week 14, he sustained his second concussion of the season. Backup Matt Flynn was put into the game as Rodgers' replacement. The Packers lost the game 7–3 to the Lions.[113] Against the Patriots, Rodgers missed the next week's regular season start, ending his streak of consecutive starts at 45, which is tied for the second longest in team history.[114] After their road loss to the Patriots, the Packers found themselves at 8–6 and had to win their final two regular season games to qualify for the playoffs. Rodgers turned around the team's performance; they won their final two regular season games, one of them against the New York Giants, where Rodgers completed 25 of 37 passes for 404 yards, with four touchdown passes, and with a passer rating of 139.9.[115] It was his first regular season 400-yard passing game. For his effort against the Giants, he earned his second NFC Offensive Player of the Week honor for the 2010 season.[116] In the next game, they defeated the Bears by a score of 10–3 in the regular season finale.[117] Rodgers was named the FedEx Air NFL Player of the Year for his passing performance in the 2010 season.[118] With a 10–6 record, the Packers entered the playoffs as a Wild Card and the No. 6 seed. In the Wild Card Round, they defeated the No. 3 seeded Eagles 21–16.[119] In the Divisional Round, Rodgers completed 31 of 36 pass attempts for 366 yards and four touchdowns in a 48–21 blowout victory over the No. 1 seeded Atlanta Falcons.[120] It was the most points scored in Packers postseason history.[121] During the contest, Rodgers tied an NFL record for consecutive playoff games with at least three touchdown passes (3 games). Rodgers also set an NFL record by becoming the only quarterback to pass for ten touchdowns combined through three consecutive playoff games. On January 23, 2011, Rodgers had a 55.4 passer rating as the Packers beat the No. 2 seed Chicago Bears 21–14 win to capture the NFC Championship.[122] After winning the NFC Championship, the Packers earned a trip to Super Bowl XLV against the Pittsburgh Steelers. In the game, Rodgers completed 24 of 39 pass attempts for 304 yards and three touchdowns in the 31–25 win, and was named Super Bowl MVP for his performance.[123][124] This would ultimately be his only Super Bowl appearance with the Packers. From his playoff performance, Rodgers became only the third player in NFL history to pass for over 1,000 yards in a single postseason and also became one of only four quarterbacks to record over 300 yards passing, with at least three touchdown passes, and no interceptions in a Super Bowl.[125] He finished with 1,094 passing yards, nine touchdown passes, two rushing touchdowns, and two interceptions, while completing 68.2% of his passes for a passer rating of 109.8.[126] From this postseason, Rodgers also became the only player to pass for at least 900 yards and rush for at least two touchdowns in a single postseason.[127] He was ranked 11th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2011.[128] Because of the 2011 NFL lockout, the Packers and Rodgers did not schedule unofficial off-season workouts, despite many teams doing so.[129] Rodgers and the Packers quickly quelled any concerns over their readiness by defeating the Saints, who had scheduled off-season workouts, 42–34. He had 312 passing yards and three touchdowns to earn NFC Offensive Player of the Week.[130][131] After the game, Rodgers said in the press conference, \"I was going to ask myself, what would have happened if we had offseason workouts? I mean, could we have started any faster and scored more points tonight?\"[132] In Week 4, a 49–23 victory over the Denver Broncos, Rodgers had 408 passing yards, four touchdowns, and one interception and ran for two touchdowns to earn another NFC Offensive Player of the Week honor.[133][134] In Week 6, a 24–3 victory over the St. Louis Rams, Rodgers converted on a career-high 93-yard touchdown pass to Jordy Nelson.[135] In Week 9, a 45–38 victory over the Chargers, he had 247 passing yards and four touchdowns to earn his third NFC Offensive Player of the Week honor for the 2011 season.[136][137] Rodgers and the Packers got off to a 13–0 start in 2011, tying the NFC record for most consecutive wins to start a season, but were upset by the Kansas City Chiefs 19–14 in week 15, ending their winning streak at 19 games, the second-longest winning streak in NFL history.[138][139] Rodgers finished the season with 4,643 passing yards, 45 touchdown passes, and six interceptions, good for a passer rating of 122.5, which as of 2024 is the highest single-season passer rating in NFL history.[140] His passing yards, touchdown passes, and passer rating set single-season franchise records.[141] In addition to passer rating, Rodgers led the league in touchdown to interception ratio (7.5, fourth-best all-time), touchdowns passing % (9.0%, second highest all-time), and yards per attempt (9.2, fourth-highest all-time since becoming an official stat in 1970), while finishing second in both touchdown passes (45, sixth-highest all-time) and completion percentage (68.3%), as well as fifth in passing yards. He earned NFC Offensive Player of the Month awards for September, October, and November, and FedEx Air Player of the Week six times (Weeks 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 13). In week four, against the Denver Broncos, Rodgers became the only quarterback in NFL history to record over 400 passing yards with four touchdown passes, while also rushing for two touchdowns in the same game.[142] He was the winner of the 2011 Galloping gobbler as MVP of the Thanksgiving game between the Packers and the Lions, a 27–15 Green Bay victory, and tied an NFL record for consecutive games with at least two touchdown passes (13). The Packers became the fifth team in NFL history to finish the regular season with a 15–1 record.[143] Rodgers played in 15 of the 16 games, with the only exception being Week 17 against the Lions, a game in which Rodgers was rested after the club clinched home-field advantage for the playoffs the previous week. In the game, Rodgers assisted backup quarterback Matt Flynn in his stellar 480-yard, six-touchdown performance by helping call some plays.[144] The Packers' offense set franchise record for points scored in a season with 560, which as of 2016 is the third-most ever behind only the 2007 Patriots and 2013 Broncos.[145] Rodgers set numerous NFL records in 2011. He recorded a passer rating of over 100.0 in thirteen games during the season, including twelve games in a row (both records), and a passer rating of 110.0 or higher in twelve games, including eleven in a row (also records). Rodgers also won the league's MVP award, receiving 48 of the 50 votes (the other two going to Drew Brees). He also finished second, behind Brees, for the AP Offensive Player of the Year award.[146] Rodgers' 2011 season was later ranked as the third greatest passing season of all time by ESPN in 2013, and was regarded as the most efficient.[147] The Packers were upset by the eventual Super Bowl champion Giants in the Divisional Round by the score of 37–20. The Packers' receiving corps dropped six passes in the loss and Rodgers finished the game with 264 passing yards, two touchdown passes, and an interception on his last pass attempt.[148] The 2011 Packers became the only team in NFL history to go 15–1 and not win a playoff game, as well as being the fourth consecutive team to win at least 15 games and not win the Super Bowl.[149] Rodgers was named to the Pro Bowl for his 2011 season to go along with a First-team All-Pro honor.[150][151] He was voted by his fellow players as the best player in the league on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2012.[152] Rodgers and the Packers started off the 2012 season with a 30–22 loss to the 49ers.[153] With the loss, Rodgers lost his bet with the music group Boyz II Men, and had to wear an Alex Smith jersey during the next week of practice.[154] Had the Packers won the game, Boyz II Men would have sung the national anthem during their next home game at Lambeau.[154] In Week 4, a 28–27 victory over the Saints, Rodgers had 319 passing yards, four touchdowns, and one interception to earn NFC Offensive Player of the Week.[155][156] In Week 6, against the undefeated Houston Texans, he tied the franchise record by throwing six touchdown passes, in a 42–24 victory, to earn NFC Offensive Player of the Week.[157][158] The Texans had allowed only six total touchdowns passes during the season up to that point.[159] This sparked a five-game winning streak which Rodgers completed 65.7% of his passes for 1,320 yards, 17 touchdowns, two interceptions, and a passer rating of 119.1.[160] During that stretch, Rodgers was named NFC Offensive Player of the Month for October.[161] In Week 15, Rodgers threw for 291 yards and three touchdowns to lead the Packers past the Bears, 21–13, making them NFC North champions for the second consecutive year.[162] In the season finale, despite Rodgers going 28 of 40 for 365 yards, four touchdowns, no interceptions and a passer rating of 131.8, the Packers lost 37–34 against the Vikings.[163] This ended the Packers' twelve-game winning streak against NFC North opponents. The Packers finished with an 11–5 record, first in the NFC North, and clinched the #3-seed in the NFC playoffs.[164] Rodgers led the league for the second straight year in passer rating (108.0) touchdowns passing % (7.1%), and touchdown-to-interception ratio (4.875), while finishing second in touchdown passes (39), third in completion percentage (67.2%), fifth in yards per attempt (7.78), and eighth in passing yards (4,295).[165] In the playoffs, the Packers defeated the Minnesota Vikings 24–10 in the Wild Card Round. Rodgers completed 23 of 33 passes to ten different players for 274 yards and a touchdown.[166] They were beaten 45–31 by the 49ers in the Divisional Round.[167] Rodgers completed 26 of 39 passes for 257 yards, two touchdowns, and an interception, while also rushing for 28 yards, in the losing effort. He earned his third career Pro Bowl nomination for his performance in the 2012 season.[168] He was ranked sixth by his peers on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2013.[169] On April 26, 2013, the Packers and Rodgers agreed to a 5-year, $110 million contract extension making him the highest paid player in NFL history.[170] The Packers began their 2013 season against the reigning NFC champions, the 49ers, the team that also ended their playoff run the previous season. Rodgers went 21 for 37 in completions, 333 yards, three touchdowns and an interception in the 34–28 loss.[171] The following week, Rodgers had a career-high 480 passing yards to tie the franchise record in the 38–20 home-opener win against the Washington Redskins. He earned NFC Offensive Player of the Week for his effort against the Redskins.[172][173] His 335 passing yards in the first half set a club record.[174] He also became the first quarterback since Y. A. Tittle in 1962 to throw for at least 480 yards, four touchdowns and no interceptions in a game.[175] The following week, Rodgers saw his NFL record of 41 consecutive games without throwing multiple interceptions come to an end in a loss to the Cincinnati Bengals by the score of 34–30.[176][177] After the loss to the Bengals, the Packers started rolling, winning their next four games. Against the Ravens, the Packers lost two receivers: Randall Cobb and James Jones. Cobb was sidelined with a broken leg and Jones with a sprained PCL.[178] Against the Cleveland Browns, tight end Jermichael Finley was carted off the field with a bruised spinal cord, leaving Rodgers without three of his top four offensive weapons.[179] The next week against the Vikings, Rodgers completed 24 of 29 passes in a 44–31 victory.[180] At home against the Bears in Week 9, Rodgers was sacked by Shea McClellin. He fractured his left clavicle in the process, and the speculation for his return ranged from a few weeks to an indefinite timetable that became a weekly spectacle of whether or when he might be cleared to play again.[181][182][183] Before Rodgers had broken his collarbone, the Packers had won four straight games to climb to the top of the NFC North division with a 5–2 record. With Rodgers injured and unable to play, the Packers went winless over the next five weeks to fall to 5–6–1 on the season.[184] After rallying in December behind re-acquired backup quarterback Matt Flynn,[185] the Packers had fought their way back to a 7–7–1 record going into the final week of the season. On December 26, Packers head coach Mike McCarthy announced Rodgers would return and start in the season-finale showdown against the Chicago Bears at Soldier Field for the NFC North championship.[186] Returning from the injury, Rodgers threw for 318 yards, two touchdowns, and two interceptions in the regular season finale against the Bears.[187] Trailing 27–28 with under a minute to go in the game and facing the third 4th down of the drive, a 4th & 8 from the 48-yard line, Rodgers connected with Cobb, who was also returning for his first game since breaking his leg in Week 6, for a 48-yard game-winning touchdown to clinch the NFC North and earn the right to host a home playoff game against the San Francisco 49ers as the fourth seed.[188] Rodgers won the 2013 GMC Never Say Never Award for the come-from-behind, division-winning touchdown pass. Rodgers finished fifth in the league in passer rating (104.9), completion percentage (66.6%), and yards per game (282) while also finishing second in yards per attempt (8.75).[189] Rodgers led the Packers to the playoffs again, this time with an 8–7–1 record and were up against the team that eliminated them last year in the Divisional Round of the playoffs, the 49ers.[190] The Packers lost to the 49ers for the fourth consecutive time, 23–20 on a last second field goal at Lambeau Field, in the Wild Card Round. Rodgers recorded only 177 yards passing, his lowest in a playoff game, and one touchdown pass.[191] He was ranked No. 11 by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2014.[192] The Packers' 2014 regular season debut came against the defending Super Bowl champion Seahawks—a game in which they would go on to lose 36–16.[193] In Week 2, the team began the game with a 21–3 deficit against the Jets, but came back and won 31–24.[194] The 18-point comeback marked the biggest comeback in Rodgers' career.[195] In the third week of the season, the Packers offense was shut down by the Lions' defense, 19–7.[196] The Packers' 7 points were the fewest points allowed in a game Rodgers finished; the 223 yards of total Packer offense were the lowest since Rodgers took over at quarterback and his 162 passing yards were also a career low. For the third consecutive season, the Packers were off to a 1–2 start. In those three games, Rodgers threw five touchdowns and one interception combined, with a passer rating of 95.1. Amid widespread concern, Rodgers told the fans and the media, \"R-E-L-A-X. Relax. We're going to be OK.\"[197] After their loss to the Lions, the Packers went on a four-game win streak, during which, Rodgers threw 13 touchdowns with no interceptions.[198] In Week 4, a 38–17 victory over the Bears, he had 302 passing yards and four touchdowns to earn NFC Offensive Player of the Week.[199][200] In Week 6, against the Miami Dolphins, Rodgers led the Packers to a game-winning drive with less than two minutes remaining. He completed a 4th & 10 pass to wide receiver Jordy Nelson and mimicked Dan Marino's famous fake spike play by completing a pass to wide receiver Davante Adams to get to within four yards of the endzone later in the drive.[201] Rodgers then completed a touchdown pass to tight end Andrew Quarless to win the game 27–24.[202] This play would later win Rodgers the GMC Never Say Never Moment of the Year Award.[202] In Week 7, a 38–17 victory over the Carolina Panthers, he was 19-of-22 for 255 passing yards and three touchdowns to earn NFC Offensive Player of the Week.[203][204] In a Week 8 loss against the Saints, Rodgers finished 28 of 39 for 418 yards, with one touchdown pass and two interceptions, ending his 212 consecutive attempts without an interception streak[205]—the second longest in team history. In the game, Rodgers injured his hamstring which appeared to have an effect on his play for the remainder of the game.[206] In Week 10, against the Chicago Bears, Rodgers became the second player in NFL history and the first since Daryle Lamonica in 1969 to throw six touchdown passes in the first half.[207] Rodgers finished 18 of 27 for 315 yards and six touchdowns despite only playing one drive in the second half to earn NFC Offensive Player of the Week.[208][209] Rodgers set multiple records during the game: most touchdown passes of 70 or more yards with 16—breaking the record held by Brett Favre and Peyton Manning, most consecutive touchdown passes without an interception at home—breaking the record also held by Favre and Manning, and became the first quarterback to ever have 10 touchdown passes against the same team in a season.[208] The 55–14 victory tied the Packers' 55–7 win vs. the Titans in 2009 for the most points scored by a Rodgers-led offense. In a Week 11 game against the 7–2 Eagles, Rodgers set a record for most consecutive attempts at home without an interception, breaking Tom Brady's record of 288 consecutive attempts.[210] In the 53–20 victory, he finished going 22 of 36, with 341 passing yards, three touchdown passes and no interceptions.[211] The 8–3 Packers met the 9–2 Patriots in Week 13, at Lambeau Field in what was Brady and Rodgers' first time playing against each other as starters.[212] Rodgers finished going 24 of 38, with 368 passing yards and two passing touchdowns in the 26–21 Packers victory.[213] For his efforts in the month of November, he earned NFC Offensive Player of the Month.[214] Rodgers suffered a calf injury in Week 16, against the Buccaneers, due to severe dehydration he endured from flu-like symptoms he suffered during the week.[215] In the Week 17 game against the Lions, Rodgers re-injured his left calf while extending a play and throwing a touchdown pass to Randall Cobb, then was helped off the field, and carted off to the locker room. After missing a series, Rodgers re-entered the game with the score tied 14–14. Despite being less mobile with the injury, Rodgers completed 13 of 15 passes for 129 yards and two scores against the league's second-ranked defense. The Packers won 30–20, winning their fourth straight NFC North title. Rodgers finished 17 of 22 for 226 yards, two touchdown passes, no interceptions, a 139.6 passer rating, and a rushing touchdown to earn his fourth NFC Offensive Player of the Week honor for the 2014 season.[216][217] The Packers secured the second seed in the NFC, rewarding them with a playoff bye and a week off which helped Rodgers rest and rehabilitate his injured left calf.[218] In the Divisional Round, the Packers were scheduled to play the 13–4 Cowboys, which marked the first time in NFL playoff history when a team which went undefeated at home (Packers) played against a team which went undefeated away (Cowboys).[219] Rodgers helped secure a 26–21 victory by finishing 24 of 35 for 316 yards, three touchdowns, no interceptions, and a 125.4 passer rating.[220] The Packers then traveled to Seattle to face the top-seeded Seahawks in a rematch of the regular season opener.[221] In the NFC Championship Game, the Packers were leading 19–7 with just over five minutes to go, but the home team's offense finally woke up and, with the assistance of a crucial Packers special teams gaffe on an onside kick, the Seahawks led 22–19, with 44 seconds remaining. Rodgers quickly drove downfield to set up a tying field goal, only to watch from the sidelines as the Seahawks won the coin toss in overtime and proceeded to score the game-winning touchdown on their first possession. Rodgers was 19-for-34 for 178 yards and a touchdown, with two interceptions in the losing effort.[222] Rodgers finished the regular season first in touchdown-to-interception ratio (7.6), lowest interception percentage (1.0%), second in passer rating (112.2), yards per attempt (8.4), and touchdown passing percentage (7.1%), third in touchdown passes (38), seventh in passing yards (4,381), and ninth in completion percentage (65.6%).[223] He set an NFL record for most consecutive pass attempts (512) at home without an interception, and touchdown passes (41). Rodgers was voted the AP NFL Most Valuable Player for the 2014 season, receiving 31 votes,[224] and was named NFC Offensive Player of the Year by the Kansas City Committee of 101[225] and Fed-Ex Air NFL Player of the Year.[226] He was also named to the AP All-Pro team as the first quarterback, receiving 44 votes while runner-up Tony Romo received three.[227] He was named to the Pro Bowl for the 2014 season.[228] He was ranked as the second best player in the league among his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2015.[229] In 2015, Rodgers had a down year by his standards. He threw for a career low 3,821 yards in which he played for at least 15 games, although he had 31 touchdowns to just eight interceptions.[230] Rodgers completed only 60.7 of his passes, averaged only 6.7 yards per attempt and finished with a passer rating of 92.7, all career lows. Pro Bowl wide receiver Jordy Nelson's absence due to injury for the season was considered a contributing factor in Rodgers' statistical drop compared to previous seasons.[231][232][233] In Week 3, a 38–28 victory over the Chiefs, Rodgers had 333 passing yards and five touchdowns to earn NFC Offensive Player of the Week.[234][235] During Week 9 against the Panthers, he finished with 369 passing yards, four touchdowns, and one interception. The interception came with only 1:47 left in the fourth quarter, and following the interception, Rodgers expressed frustration by throwing down a Microsoft Surface tablet.[236] The Packers ended up losing the game 29–37.[237] On December 3, 2015, in a Week 13 match-up against the Lions, Rodgers threw a Hail Mary pass caught by Richard Rodgers II for 61 yards with 0:00 left to beat the Lions 27–23, after the game was extended due to a facemask penalty called on Detroit.[238] The play was quickly dubbed as \"The Miracle in Motown.\"[239][240] The Packers made the playoffs as the fifth seed in the NFC with a 10–6 record.[241] They defeated the Redskins 35–18 on the road in the Wild Card Round of the playoffs. Rodgers finished the game with 210 yards and two passing touchdowns.[242] In the Divisional Round against the Cardinals, Rodgers threw a 41-yard Hail Mary touchdown pass to Jeff Janis as time expired to send the game into overtime. However, the Packers lost 26–20 in overtime. Rodgers finished the game 24 for 44 for 261 yards with two touchdowns and an interception.[243] He was named to his fifth Pro Bowl and was ranked as the sixth best player by his peers on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2016.[244][245] Throughout the first five games of the 2016 season, Rodgers' struggles from the 2015 season appeared to continue.[246] Through those games, he completed 60.2% of his passes, averaged 6.5 yards per attempt, and posted a passer rating of 88.4—all of which were similar to his 2015 numbers.[247] He also fumbled five times, and lost two. His lackluster performance through those games caused much speculation about the causes of his problems.[248][246][249][250] In a Week 7 Thursday Night Football game against the Bears, Rodgers rebounded by recording a franchise record and career-high 39 completions, breaking Brett Favre's previous record of 36 in 1993, also against the Bears.[251] Rodgers recorded 326 passing yards for his first 300-yard passing game since Week 10 of the 2015 season in the 26–10 win.[252] The following week against the Atlanta Falcons, Rodgers recorded a career regular season high of 60 rushing yards,[252] and finished with four touchdown passes and a 125.5 passer rating.[253] After a Week 11 loss to the Redskins—the Packers' fourth in a row, putting them at 4–6—Rodgers was optimistic about the remainder of the season, saying, \"I feel like we can run the table, I really do.\"[254] Despite widespread doubt over the likelihood of such a run,[255][256][257] the Packers would go on to finish the season with six straight wins—as Rodgers said they could. In a Week 12 Monday Night Football game Rodgers appeared to injure his hamstring on a scrambling play against the Eagles.[258] After the play, Rodgers went into an injury tent on the sideline to get his leg taped up.[258] Rodgers, however, did not miss any snaps in the game and finished 30 out of 39 for 313 yards with no sacks or interceptions.[259] His 300-yard performance was his fourth of the season and the first allowed by the Eagles' defense all season.[259] The Packers won, 27–13, snapping their four-game losing streak. In a 38–10 victory over the Seahawks in a Week 14 game, Rodgers and the Packers continued their recent offensive and defensive success.[260][261] Rodgers finished with 246 passing yards, three touchdown passes and a 150.8 passer rating. The 150.8 passer rating was the best recorded against Seattle's defense since head coach Pete Carroll took over in 2010.[260] Rodgers did this despite suffering a calf injury early in the game.[260] He was named NFC Offensive Player of the Week for his performance against the Seahawks.[262] On December 20, 2016, Rodgers was selected to his third consecutive Pro Bowl and his sixth overall in his career.[263] During Week 16, Rodgers and Drew Brees tied the NFL record for most seasons with at least 35 touchdown passes with four—a record shared with Peyton Manning and Tom Brady.[264][265] In the game against the Vikings, Rodgers finished 28 of 38 for 347 yards, four touchdown passes and a rushing touchdown to earn NFC Offensive Player of the Week.[266][267] His 300-yard performance was the first allowed by the Vikings' defense all season.[266] He also set Packer regular season records for most 4,000-yard passing seasons (6), most completions in a season (374), and—with Jordy Nelson—most touchdowns by a quarterback/wide receiver combination with (59).[266] Rodgers was named NFC Offensive Player of the Month for December.[268] Rodgers helped lead the Packers to a NFC North title and a playoff berth in 2016.[269] The Packers defeated the Giants in the Wild Card Round. Rodgers completed 25 of 40 passes for 364 yards and four touchdowns in the victory. They defeated the #1-seed Cowboys in the Divisional Round. With the game tied at 31 with only 18 seconds remaining with the ball on their own 32-yard line, Rodgers threw a 36-yard completion to tight end Jared Cook to put the Packers in Mason Crosby's field goal range. Crosby converted the 51-yard attempt as time expired to win the game.[270] Overall, Rodgers completed 28 of 43 passes for 355 yards, two touchdowns and an interception in the victory.[271][272] The Packers lost to the Falcons in the NFC Championship in the final game at the Georgia Dome. Rodgers completed 27 of his 45 passing attempts for 287 yards with three touchdowns and an interception in the losing effort.[273] In 2016, Rodgers finished with 401 completions and 610 attempts (both career highs), a 65.7% completion percentage, 4,428 passing yards, 40 touchdown passes, seven interceptions, a passer rating of 104.2, 369 rushing yards (career-high), and four rushing touchdowns.[274] With his 40 touchdown passes, he led the league in the statistic for the first time in his career[275] and became one of only four quarterbacks to pass for at least 40 touchdowns in multiple seasons.[276] Rodgers also finished fourth in passing yards, completions, attempts, and passer rating.[277] Among quarterbacks, he finished third in rushing yards and fifth in rushing touchdowns.[278] He was ranked sixth by his peers on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2017.[279] In a Week 1 victory over the Seahawks, Rodgers had his 50th career game with at least 300 passing yards. He finished the game with 311, but his streak of 251 consecutive passes without an interception came to an end when defensive tackle Nazair Jones picked him off in the first quarter.[280] In the next game, a 34–23 loss to the Falcons in Week 2, he had 343 passing yards, two touchdowns, and an interception in the first game in the new Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta.[281] In Week 5, down by 28–31 against the Cowboys with less than two minutes on the clock, Rodgers led a nine-play, 75-yard touchdown drive in the 35–31 victory, earning him NFC Offensive Player of the Week.[282] During Week 6 against the Vikings, Rodgers was taken off the field by his coaches and medical personnel after suffering a shoulder injury on a hit from Anthony Barr. Shortly thereafter, it was revealed that Rodgers suffered a fractured right collarbone.[283][284] The next day, on October 16, it was announced that Rodgers would have surgery on his broken collarbone.[285] On October 19, he underwent surgery on his collarbone, and was officially placed on injured reserve the next day.[286][287] A total of 13 screws were inserted to stabilize his collarbone.[288][289] Rodgers returned to practice on December 2, 2017, making him eligible to play in the upcoming Week 15 game.[290] On December 12, 2017, it was announced that Rodgers was medically cleared by doctors and was set to start the next game against the Panthers.[291] He was officially activated on December 16, 2017.[292] Rodgers returned during Week 15 against the Panthers, where he finished with 290 passing yards, three touchdowns, and three interceptions as the Packers lost 24–31.[293] However, two days later, on December 19, Rodgers was placed back on injured reserve after the Packers were eliminated from playoff contention.[294][295][296] He was ranked No. 10 by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2018.[297] On August 29, 2018, Rodgers signed a four-year extension with the Packers worth $134 million featuring a $57.5 million signing bonus.[298][299] During Sunday Night Football against the Bears in Week 1, Rodgers left the game with a knee injury but returned in the third quarter. Down by 20 points, Rodgers finished with 286 passing yards and three touchdowns, leading the Packers rally to a 24–23 win.[300] Despite a nagging knee injury, Rodgers had at least 40 pass attempts in each of the next three games. In the last of these, he threw his first interception in 150 attempts.[301] In Week 5, Rodgers passed for 442 yards (the second-best of his career) and three touchdowns, but also two fumbles, in a 31–23 loss to the Lions.[302] In the following game, a 33–30 victory over the 49ers, he had 425 passing yards and two passing touchdowns.[303] Following the bye-week, despite a continuing knee injury,[304] Rodgers had his third consecutive week with a 100+ quarterback rating,[305] which included 286 yards passing, no interceptions, and a go-ahead 40-yard touchdown pass to Marquez Valdes-Scantling in a 29–27 loss to the Los Angeles Rams.[306] In Week 14, against the Falcons, Rodgers set an NFL record by converting his 359th consecutive pass without an interception, breaking Tom Brady's previous record.[307] In Week 15, against the Chicago Bears, Rodgers threw for 274 yards and an interception in a 24–17 loss.

Trailing at one point by 15 points, Rodgers and the Packers won 44–38 in overtime.[309] He matched his own feat of achieving at least 400 passing yards, two passing touchdowns, and two rushing touchdowns in a single game. The only other time in NFL history that occurred was when Rodgers accomplished it in 2011 against the Denver Broncos.[310] On December 18, 2018, Rodgers was named to his seventh Pro Bowl.[311] He declined the appearance due to injury and was replaced by Russell Wilson.[312] In the regular season finale against the Detroit Lions, Rodgers suffered a concussion early in the game and would not return.[313] He was then sent to the hospital to test for concussion symptoms.[314] Because the Packers had already been eliminated from playoff contention, Rodgers answered questions about whether he should be playing, for fear of injury, by saying: \"That's just not the way I lead, and I'm super-competitive, and I want to be out there with the guys and I look forward to being out there.\"[314] Rodgers was later spotted at the Packers' facility after the game.[314] Rodgers finished the season with 372 completions, 597 attempts, 4,442 passing yards, 25 passing touchdowns, two interceptions and a passer rating of 97.6.[315] His touchdown to interception ratio of 25:2 (12.5) ranks third best all-time (min. 300 attempts).[316] In addition to setting the record for consecutive passes without an interception during the season, Rodgers set NFL records for interception percentage for a season, with only 0.335% of his passes being intercepted, and for the amount of thrown away passes.[317][318] He was ranked eighth by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2019.[319] Rodgers started the 2019 season with a new head coach in Matt LaFleur following the departure of Mike McCarthy.[320] The Packers offense relied less on Rodgers' trademark passes and more on heavy formations and play-action throws to take advantage of running back Aaron Jones.[321] Rodgers helped lead the Packers to a 3–0 start with victories over the Bears, Vikings, and Broncos.[322][323][324] In Week 4, against the Eagles on Thursday Night Football, he had 422 passing yards and two passing touchdowns, but also threw the game-ending interception as the Packers were handed their first loss of the season by a score of 34–27.[325] In Week 7, against the Raiders, Rodgers posted his first-ever game with a perfect passer rating of 158.3, the first quarterback in team history to do so.[326] He completed 25-of-31 passes for 429 yards and five touchdowns in the 42–24 victory.[327] He was named the NFC Offensive Player of the Week for his performance.[328] In Week 17, against the Lions, Rodgers helped lead the team to a 23–20 comeback win.

Instead, he had received homeopathic treatment from his personal doctor. While unvaccinated, he committed multiple violations of NFL COVID-19 protocols for unvaccinated players, including attending parties with teammates while not using PPE and appearing unmasked at multiple postgame press conferences.[360][361][362][363][364] After a review, he was fined $14,650 for violations of the agreed protocols and his team was fined $300,000.[365][366] Rodgers was activated off the reserve/COVID-19 list on November 13, and returned to play the next day against the Seahawks, a game the Packers won 17–0.[367] In Week 15, Rodgers threw for 268 yards and three touchdowns in a 31–30 win over the Ravens, which clinched the NFC North title for the Packers for a third consecutive season and earned him NFC Offensive Player of the Week honors.[368] On December 23, 2021, Rodgers was named to his tenth Pro Bowl.[369] In a Week 16 victory over the Browns, Rodgers threw his 443rd career touchdown pass, passing Brett Favre for the most all-time career touchdown passes in Packers history.[370] For his play in the month of December, Rodgers earned NFC Offensive Player of the Month honors.[371] He finished the 2021 season with 4,115 passing yards, 37 touchdowns, and four interceptions.[372] On January 14, 2022, Rodgers earned his fourth career First-team All-Pro selection.[373] In the Divisional Round against the 49ers, Rodgers threw for 225 yards, but a poor performance by the special teams unit haunted the Packers, losing 13–10. It was Rodgers' fourth loss in as many games to the 49ers in the postseason and Rodgers' second home divisional loss.[59] After the season, Rodgers won the AP NFL Most Valuable Player Award for the second consecutive season and the fourth time overall.[374] Rodgers became the fifth player to win consecutive MVPs and first since Peyton Manning between 2008 and 2009.[375] Rodgers joined Manning as the only players in NFL history to win at least four MVPs.[376] He was ranked third by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2022.[377] On March 8, Rodgers confirmed that he would return and play for the Packers for the 2022 season after speculations that Rodgers could retire or demand a trade to another team.[378] There were reports that Rodgers and the Packers had agreed to terms on a 4-year, $200 million contract extension that would have made him the highest-paid player in NFL history, but Rodgers denied those reports on Twitter, stating that the numbers on the proposed contract were inaccurate, and that he had yet to sign such a contract. He did confirm, however, that he would return to play his 18th NFL season with the Packers.[379][380] On March 16, he officially signed his contract extension. The final terms of the contract was a 3-year contract (which replaced the final year of his existing contract) worth $150.8 million, with $101.5 million guaranteed. The new contract made him the highest paid player in North American sports history on an annual basis, surpassing the NBA's Damian Lillard's $49 million per annum contract.[381] In the season opener against the Vikings, Rodgers threw for 195 yards and an interception in the 23–7 loss.[382][383] In Week 4 against the Patriots, Rodgers threw for 251 yards and two touchdowns, but also threw his fourth career pick-six to Jack Jones in the 27–24 overtime win.[384] In Week 5 at London, Rodgers threw for 222 yards and two touchdowns in an upset loss against the Giants.[385] In Week 8 against the Buffalo Bills on Sunday Night Football, Rodgers threw for 203 yards, two touchdowns and one interception as the Packers lost their fourth consecutive game in the 27–17 defeat.[386] The next week against the Lions, Rodgers threw for 291 yards, a touchdown, and three interceptions in the 15–9 loss. It was the first time since Week 15 of the 2017 season that Rodgers threw three interceptions in a game.[387] Rodgers bounced back the following week against the Cowboys, completing 14-of-20 passes for 224 yards and three touchdowns in 31–28 overtime victory.[388][389] Following a Week 11 loss to the Titans, Rodgers confirmed he has been playing with a broken thumb on his throwing hand he suffered in Week 5.[390][391] A Week 12 loss to the Eagles left the Packers with a 4–8 record, but the team rallied off four consecutive wins to get to 8–8 before the regular season finale.[392] The Packers finished with an 8–9 record and missed the postseason following a Week 18 loss to the Detroit Lions in a win-and-in scenario for Green Bay.[393][394] Rodgers finished the 2022 season with 3,695 passing yards, 26 touchdowns, and 12 interceptions, which marked the most for Rodgers in a single season since 2008.[395][396] He was ranked 51st by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2023.[397] On April 26, 2023, Rodgers was traded to the Jets, along with the Packers' first and fifth-round selections in the 2023 NFL draft, in exchange for the Jets' first, second (via Cleveland) and sixth-round selections in the 2023 draft and a conditional second-round selection (which would have converted to a first if Rodgers played 65% of the offensive snaps in 2023, but it did not happen) in the 2024 NFL draft.[398] The move echoed the career path of his predecessor Brett Favre, who similarly spent over fifteen years as quarterback of the Packers before being traded to the Jets.[399] Although Joe Namath granted Rodgers permission to wear his retired No. 12 jersey, Rodgers announced that he would return to wearing the No. 8 jersey, which he had worn throughout his college career with the California Golden Bears.[400] On July 26, 2023, Rodgers took a pay cut and agreed to a reworked contract with the Jets.[401] Making his Jets debut in Week 1 on Monday Night Football against the Bills at MetLife Stadium, Rodgers injured his left ankle on just his fourth offensive snap after being sacked by Bills' defensive end Leonard Floyd. Rodgers was helped off the field and later carted to the locker room for further evaluation.[402] Rodgers' backup Zach Wilson went on to lead the Jets to a 22–16 win in overtime.[403] The next day, Rodgers was diagnosed with an Achilles tendon rupture and was later placed on injured reserve.[404][405] Rodgers underwent surgery on September 13, with Dr. Neal ElAttrache placing an internal brace in his left Achilles with the goal of a mid-January return at the earliest.[406] On November 29, the New York Jets opened the 21-day practice window for Rodgers. Limited in practice, Rodgers was cleared for functional activity but not contact.[407] He was activated off injured reserve on December 20, but the Jets announced he would not play again this season after their Week 15 loss to the Dolphins mathematically eliminated them from playoff contention.[408][409] After playing just four offensive snaps in his first season with the Jets due to an Achilles injury, Rodgers made his return on Monday Night Football in Week 1 to kick off the 2024 campaign. In his highly anticipated return, Rodgers completed 13 of 21 passes for 167 yards, one touchdown and one interception in a 32–19 loss to the defending NFC champion San Francisco 49ers.[410] In the Jets' home opener against the New England Patriots, Rodgers completed 27 of 35 passes for 281 yards and two touchdowns as the Jets cruised to a 24–3 victory.[411] In Week 5 in London, Rodgers became the ninth quarterback in NFL history to reach 60,000 passing yards but tied his career-high with three interceptions, including a game-sealing pick with under a minute left as the Jets lost 23–17 to the Vikings.[412] Jets head coach Robert Saleh was unexpectedly fired after the London loss, with some analysts perceiving that he did not get along with Rodgers.[413] When asked about it on The Pat McAfee Show, the quarterback firmly denied accusations that he had a role in Saleh's termination.[414] In Week 6, the Jets' first game after Saleh’s termination, Rodgers threw for 294 yards and two touchdowns, including a 52-yard Hail Mary pass to Allen Lazard to close out the first half, his fourth career such pass completion.[415] However, another interception on the Jets' final drive doomed them as they lost 23–20 to the Buffalo Bills.[416] Following the loss, the Jets traded for Davante Adams, with whom Rodgers had previously combined for over 600 receptions and 68 touchdowns during their eight seasons together in Green Bay.[417] However, the Jets continued to struggle, as Rodgers threw two interceptions and led the offense to zero points in the second half of their Week 7 matchup against the Steelers, losing their fourth consecutive game.[418] After a loss to the Patriots, Rodgers helped the Jets snap their five-game losing streak in Week 9 against the Houston Texans, throwing for 179 yards and three touchdowns in the second half after being shutout in the first half as the Jets won 21–13.[419] In Week 11 against the Colts, Rodgers threw two touchdowns and led the Jets to a season-high in points, but they fell short in a 28–27 loss, dropping to 3–7.[420] During their bye week, it was revealed that Rodgers had been playing through hamstring, knee, and ankle injuries but had refused to get scans done in fear of how severe they would be.[421] Despite this, he remained the starter following the bye week.[422] Entering Week 14, Rodgers held an NFL-record 34-game drought without a 300-yard passing performance, which he broke on December 8 against the Dolphins.[423] Despite recording his first 300-yard game in three years, the Jets fell 32–26 in overtime, eliminating them from playoff contention.[424] Since becoming a starter in 2008, Rodgers has become known for his unique touchdown celebration, which he and his teammates have dubbed the \"Championship Belt.\" After a scoring play, Rodgers celebrates by making a motion as if he is putting an invisible championship belt on around his waist.[425][426] Teammate Greg Jennings said of the celebration: \"It's just something fun that he does. We get excited when we see it cause we know that he's made a play or we've made a play as offense.\"[427] The gesture drew the praise of WWE wrestler Triple H and has become common for Green Bay fans to mimic during games.[428] He has also celebrated by doing the shoryuken, a jumping uppercut move from the Street Fighter series.[429] Rodgers has been vocal about his use of alternative medicine,[463][464] and is a proponent of the legalization of psychedelic drugs.[465] He revealed in 2022 that he had previously made offseason trips to Peru, where he consumed ayahuasca.[466] Rodgers is one of the most prominent American athletes to choose not to get vaccinated against the COVID-19 virus,[467] and was critical of the NFL's health and safety protocols during the COVID-19 pandemic.[468] His stances on the COVID-19 vaccine were criticized by scientists, health officials, and some former players and commentators, due to concerns that Rodgers was spreading vaccine misinformation and potentially was risking the health of his teammates.[469] During the NFL season, Rodgers frequently appears on The Pat McAfee Show.[470] One such interview in 2021 made headlines after Rodgers made several false and misleading statements about COVID-19,[471][472] implying that unvaccinated people were not the group most affected by the pandemic and that ivermectin was beneficial for people with COVID-19.[467][473][474][475] These and similar claims led some reporters to describe Rodgers as a conspiracy theorist.[471][476] Rodgers has voiced support for Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his presidential campaign of 2024.[477] Kennedy reportedly included Rodgers on his \"short list\" of possible vice presidential running mates, along with others, including Jesse Ventura and Nicole Shanahan.[478][479] On Adam Breneman's podcast in 2022, former Packers backup quarterback DeShone Kizer said that Rodgers had expressed interest in 9/11 conspiracy theories at one of the first meetings between the two quarterbacks. Kizer described their discussion of conspiracy theories as \"a real thought experiment\".[480][481] Rodgers has also promoted the Tartarian architecture conspiracy theory.[482] In a January 2024 appearance on The Pat McAfee Show, Rodgers, without evidence, implied that comedian Jimmy Kimmel was an acquaintance of disgraced financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, and that Kimmel's name would possibly appear in soon to be released court documents listing Epstein's associates.[483] Kimmel denied the allegations and threatened to sue Rodgers for defamation if he repeated the claim.[484] In a follow-up appearance on McAfee's show the following week, Rodgers stated: \"I'm glad that Jimmy is not on the list. I really am. I don't think he's the P-word [pedophile].\"[485] During a February 2024 appearance on the conspiracy-focused Look Into It podcast hosted by Eddie Bravo, Rodgers espoused numerous conspiracy theories on medicine, immigration, and John F. Kennedy.[486] His claims included that AIDS and COVID were created by the government for the sake of pharmaceutical industry profits (see also discredited HIV/AIDS origins theories and Operation Denver).[487] In 2024, CNN reporter Pamela Brown reported that Rodgers had in 2013 shared false conspiracy theories about the Sandy Hook massacre, claiming that the attack was an \"inside job\" perpetrated by the government. CNN simultaneously reported an allegation by an anonymous source that Rodgers had several years prior said \"Sandy Hook never happened....All those children never existed. They were all actors.\"[488] In response, Rodgers said, \"I am not and have never been of the opinion that the events did not take place\" but did not say whether he had ever believed the Sandy Hook massacre was an \"inside job.\"[477] Rodgers has two brothers; the younger, Jordan, played quarterback at Vanderbilt University and had a brief NFL career with the Jacksonville Jaguars and Tampa Bay Buccaneers.[489][490][491] Although Rodgers and his brothers were raised Christian, in an interview in 2017 he stated that he no longer affiliated himself with any organized religion.[492] Rodgers is the godfather to Cade Cobb, the second son of his long-time NFL teammate, Randall Cobb.[493] Rodgers was in a relationship with actress Olivia Munn from 2014 to 2017 and with former professional racing driver Danica Patrick from 2018 to 2020.[494][495][496] He started dating actress Shailene Woodley in the second half of 2020.[497] In an appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon in 2021, Woodley confirmed that she was engaged to Rodgers.[498] On February 16, 2022, Rodgers and Woodley called off their engagement.[499] Rodgers was initiated as an honorary member of Tau Kappa Epsilon (TKE) on January 5, 2012, at the Sigma-Xi Chapter at St. Norbert College.[500] In April 2018, Rodgers was announced as a limited partner in the Milwaukee Bucks ownership group, making him the first active NFL player with an ownership stake in an NBA franchise.[501] Rodgers was a longtime spokesperson for State Farm Insurance and was frequently featured in their commercials. In the commercials, Rodgers often highlights his \"Championship Belt\" touchdown celebration, which State Farm renamed as the \"Discount Double Check\".[502] Rodgers has also been featured in Pizza Hut advertisements,[503] as well as numerous local Wisconsin-based advertisements.[504] In May 2015, Rodgers appeared as a contestant on Celebrity Jeopardy!; he defeated Shark Tank investor Kevin O'Leary and astronaut and future United States Senator Mark Kelly, winning $50,000 for his charity. In April 2021, Rodgers had a two-week stint as guest host on Jeopardy! from April 5–16.[505][506] Rodgers has also made numerous cameo appearances on television, including in a 2013 episode of The Office, a 2019 episode of Game of Thrones, and a 2015 episode of the sketch comedy television series Key & Peele.[507][508][509] He also taped a cameo as Jeopardy! host for an episode of The Conners.[510] In 2021, Rodgers took part in The Match IV, which was the fourth installment in the exhibition match play golf series. He was paired with professional golfer Bryson DeChambeau. The team went up against Phil Mickelson and Tom Brady.[511] DeChambeau and Rodgers won the match 3 and 2.[512] Rodgers also took part in the sixth edition of The Match, where he teamed up with Brady against fellow quarterbacks Josh Allen and Patrick Mahomes.[513] Rodgers and Brady defeated Mahomes and Allen 1 up.[514] Rodgers is the founder, and the co-creator, along with David Gruber, of itsAaron,[515] a charity with a mission of \"creating awareness for organizations and people who are changing the world\".[516][517] He is also a supporter of the MACC Fund,[518][519] Raise Hope for Congo,[520] and other humanitarian and charitable efforts.[521][522] Rodgers' Celebrity Jeopardy! win earned $50,000 for the MACC Fund.[523][524] During his 2021 appearance as Jeopardy! guest host, the show made a charitable donation equal to the cumulative winnings of the contestants (including the runners-up) for those ten shows.[506] Rodgers is a supporter of his alma mater, University of California, Berkeley. He has donated funds to renovate the athletic facilities[525] and also established an endowed scholarship for transfer students at the school. In 2021, he was honored by the school for his charitable work.[526] In 2021, Rodgers donated $1 million to help small businesses in Chico and Butte County, California.[527] In 2024, Rodgers raised $3 million for charities with a flag football tournament.[528]",

                "content": "Editions: En/nfl/new-york-jets The documentary \"Enigma\" delves into the life and work of the oldest player in the NFL today. With a 19-year career and 41 years of age, Aaron Rodgers is the oldest active player in the NFL. Although this is a cause for respect, it also has its downside, as it often makes him the target of all kinds of jokes regarding his age, as revealed by the quarterback himself. Rodgers began his professional career in 2005 with the Green Bay Packers, with whom he played 18 seasons before signing in 2023 with the New York Jets. Although the veteran continues to play at the highest level, his most recent two years have been tougher than expected. In 2023, an injury kept him from playing the entire season, while in 2024, several persistent injuries and a slump in his play intensified the debate regarding his age. Off the field, it's not easy either, although Rodgers tries to take it with humor, comments and \"jokes\" about his age are more frequent than he would like. Related: In a newly released Netflix docuseries, the Jets signal-caller recalled an unusual conversation with Willie Randolph. In an elevator encounter, the former MLB executive asked Rodgers, \"Were you in Green Bay in 1991?\" to which the quarterback humorously replied, \"No, I was not. I was 7 in '91 for most of the year, but thank you.\" The Super Bowl XLV champion revealed that it is common for people to confuse him with players from past decades. In similar conversations, he explained, he has been asked if he played with legends like Steve Young or John Elway, who retired in 1999 and 1998, respectively. Rodgers seems relatively comfortable with being the punchline of elderly jokes. In fact, he is also aware that he has played longer than most of his contemporaries, \"But never in 1991.\" The \"Enigma\" docuseries delves into Rodgers' life, exploring his playing career and lesser-known facets of his life. Among these, his controversial use of ayahuasca as an aid in his spiritual awakening, and the estrangement from his family. Religion of Sports, Skydance Sports, and NFL Films produced the documentary, which is available on Netflix starting this week. Beyond the senior citizen jokes, the series is a journey into the life of one of the most polarizing names in the NFL. © Unidad Editorial Información Deportiva, S.L.U. All rights reserved.

                "content": "Editions: En/nfl/new-york-jets Jets' quarterback was accused of misleading the public about the COVID-19 vaccine Aaron Rodgers admits in his upcoming Netflix sports documentary that he has lost friends and family over his 'controversial' views after the New York Jets quarterback questioned the COVID-19 vaccine and hit out at cancel culture. The 41-year-old is in a very privileged position where he is wealthy enough that he never has to engage with, or think about, politics if he doesn't want to but that's simply not the path the Super Bowl champion has taken. He previously accused the 'woke cancel culture' of trying to stop him from expressing himself as well as later admitting he misled the public when he described himself as 'immunized' against COVID-19, before later contracting the disease in November 2021. Whilst the then-Green Bay Packer claimed the reaction to his lack of clarity about his vaccination status was an \"attempted takedown\" of his integrity and word, he revealed that some of his family and friends have distanced themselves from him. \"Losing friendships, family. It was heartbreaking,\" Rodgers says in a tailer for Aaron Rodgers: Enigma, also adding that he battled between his naturally introverted personality behind closed doors, and his extroverted persona for fans. He has lost connection to his parents and his two brothers for around a decade, although this is thought to be related to non-Christian values, such as sex before marriage, rather than his policy towards viruses and 'cancel culture'. Between Rodgers' confession about his personal life and his ex-fiancee's comments about their relationship, it's not been a great week as far as his public persona goes. Shailene Woodley and the quarterback got engaged in 2021, just days after going public together, but they never made it to the wedding ceremony as they broke up in 2022. The 33-year-old previously hinted that emotional unavailability was the source of the split, but now she's seemed to go one step further by hinting that the damage from their relationship still hurts her to this day and even left her depressed. \"I haven't shared much about my relationship with Aaron because it always makes me cry,\" Woodley told outside magazine. \"It was not right. But it was beautiful. \"I had a really awful, traumatic thing happen in early 2022. I felt like I lost my soul, myself, my happiness, my joy. \"Empathy kind of kept me in this loop of feeling everything for everyone. I knew I was depressed when I looked at a tree and felt nothing.\" © Unidad Editorial Información Deportiva, S.L.U. All rights reserved. Follow us",

LIVE: Follow LIV vs. PGA Tour Showdown updates Instead of going after each other in the media, four of golf's biggest names — two on the PGA Tour and two belonging to LIV Golf — are facing off in an exhibition match on Tuesday. Scottie Scheffler and Rory McIlroy will do battle with Bryson DeChambeau and Brooks Koepka, combining 13 major championships and personalities that have clashed in the past. Not only has McIlroy been heavily critical of those who joined LIV Golf, but DeChambeau and Koepka themselves butted heads in the past before reconciling. Fans will finally get to see PGA Tour golfers face off with LIV Golfers outside of a major, and the action will go down at Las Vegas' Shadow Creek Golf Club. Here's a look at the format for Tuesday's LIV Golf vs. PGA Tour Showdown. MORE: Complete guide to LIV vs. PGA Tour Showdown The Showdown between the LIV Golf and PGA Tour pairs will 18 holes, which are broken down into three different stages. The first six holes will be played as four-balls. In this style of play, each golfer uses their own ball to play the hole. However, only the teammate with the lower score counts. Whichever team has the lower score wins the round. Holes No. 7-12 will be played in a foursomes format. Each team plays only one ball, with teammates alternating shots. The group will also switch who tees off the hole, with one player assigned the odd numbers and the other with the evens. The team with the lower score wins the hole. The final six holes will feature two one-on-one matches between a player from each team. The matchups are not yet known. The team that wins more of the three stages will win the event and earn a payment in the form of CRO Cryptocurrency. MORE: How much prize money will LIV vs. PGA Tour Showdown winners make? The four players will play a standard 18 holes on Tuesday, but the holes will be broken into stages. Golfers will play a four-ball format for the first six holes, foursomes on holes No. 7-12 and singles matches on holes No. 13-18. That means the scoring won't break down the same way it would for 18 traditional holes, with emphasis instead being placed on winning each individual stage of play. Four-ball play, which will be how the first six holes are played, simply allows a team of two to take the lowest score from each round. For example, Scheffler and McIlroy will each play their own ball on the first hole, but only the better score between the two will count. That means a major mistake by one of the two golfers wouldn't cost the team, assuming the other player doesn't similarly post a disappointing score. Four-ball always involves four players, as the name indicates. The players will use the foursomes scoring format for holes No. 7-12. Rather than use two balls as they will during the four-ball portion, each team only uses one ball. The players on each team alternate shots. If Scheffler takes the tee shot, for example, McIlroy will take the next shot, followed by Scheffler again. The two alternate shots until the ball is in the hole. Team members typically alternate tee shots, with one taking the tee shots on even-numbered holes and the other taking the odd-numbered holes.

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. There was ultimately not much \"show\" to The Showdown on Tuesday night as the PGA Tour pairing of Scottie Scheffler and Rory McIlroy took it to the LIV Golf duo of Bryson DeChambeau and Brooks Koepka to win the inaugural event in decisive fashion. Scheffler & McIlroy raced through the initial four-ball match, eked out the foursomes match and cruised through the singles matches to win the 2.5 points necessary to reign supreme in Las Vegas. Scheffler & McIlroy jumped out the gates and never looked back at Shadow Creek Golf Club. Leaning primarily on McIlroy in the four-ball match, the PGA Tour team won the first two holes thanks to birdies from the blade of the Northern Irishman. After both teams made pars on the ensuing hole, McIlroy maneuvered the par-5 4th in effective fashion to set up a match-clinching moment. Rolling in his eagle putt from roughly 40 feet, McIlroy turned the tables on DeChambeau, who was in tight with a chance to extend the match. When the U.S. Open champion's putt veered left, the first match point was had by Scheffler & McIlroy to the tune of 3&2. The foursomes match was a tighter affair as Scheffler missed a birdie bid on the first hole with McIlroy doing the same on the second. The PGA Tour team was unable to take advantage of their scoring opportunities until Scheffler stuffed a wedge in tight on the third hole. McIlroy was never forced to hit his birdie putt, however, as Koepka & DeChambeau played putt-putt on the green and gifted the lead to their opponents. Staying in the holiday spirit, the two sides continued to present gifts to one another. After Scheffler missed a 5-foot birdie putt on the fourth hole, failing to secure at least another half point as Koepka rolled in a birdie on No. 5 to win his side's first hole of the evening and tie the second match. Unfortunately for Koepka & DeChambeau, they needed three putts again on the pivotal sixth hole of the match and gave away the full point in favor of Scheffler & McIlroy. With two of the possible four points already obtained, Scheffler & McIlroy were required to only tie one of the two singles matches. Scheffler squared off against Koepka leaving McIlroy and DeChambeau to duke it out in a mini rematch of this summer's U.S. Open. McIlroy's firepower persisted until the end allowing him to surge past DeChambeau in a commanding manner. Meanwhile, the world No. 1 made easy work of the five-time major champion as Scheffler's steady nature was too much for an up-and-down Koepka to overcome and put the finishing touches on a dominant night for the two players from the PGA Tour. Scottie Scheffler and Rory McIlroy both make par on the first hole of the singles matches, and they are enough to command leads in both matches. They just need to tie one of the two matches to take care of this bad boy. Well, it was not pretty, but the PGA Tour wins another point in the foursomes match. Winning 1 UP thanks to a par on the last hole, the PGA Tour team needs to only tie one of the two singles matches in order to win the competition. Neither team could make a putt in the second match. This match could be over by now, but the putters have not cooperated for the PGA Tour team in the foursomes format. They lead 1 UP with two holes to play after Scheffler missed a snapping right-to-left 5-foot putt to win the hole. They have let the LIV Golf guys off the hook a few times in this portion of the match. The two teams have exchanged pars on the first two holes of the six-hole alternate shot match. The PGA Tour team had chances on both holes to claim the lead as Scheffler missed a birdie chance from 7 feet on the first hole and McIlroy just missed one from roughly 13 feet on the second hole. The ol' Mongolian reversal. Rory McIlroy makes an eagle from 40 feet on No. 4 and put the pressure on Bryson DeChambeau who was inside 5 feet with an eagle look of his own. The U.S. Open champion pulls his eagle putt which means the PGA Tour team grabs the four-ball match 3 and 2. They will now transition to alternate shot. McIlroy and Scheffler remain 2 UP as the two teams tie the par-4 3rd at Shadow Creek. With three holes remaining in the four-ball format, another hole win from the PGA Tour side will give them the first match. The second match — holes Nos. 7-12 — will be alternate shot. It is an opening birdie from the PGA Tour side in the four-ball format. They take a 1 UP lead with five holes remaining in this portion of the match. The early lead is courtesy of Rory McIlroy who split the fairway and hit his second to roughly 5 feet before cashing in the birdie effort. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

While LIV Golf may be the new, fun brand, it was the PGA Tour that walked away with the victory, and in dominant fashion. The match itself offered an opportunity to get into the minds of the golfers, with each of them mic'd up throughout the night. Unfortunately, the matchup itself wound up finishing sooner than we'd expected, as Scottie Scheffler and Rory McIlroy dominated from the get-go, taking home the $10 million cryptocurrency prize purse. Here's everything that happened at Shadow Creek Golf Course in North Las Vegas. THE SHOWDOWN PURSE:Golfers will be paid in crypto. In sports, they won't be the first From early on, it was evident that Scheffler and McIlroy were playing a level above Koepka and DeChambeau. Perhaps DeChambeau's parka was a giveaway that LIV was not ready to play in the cold Vegas air. McIlroy's heroics with the putter combined with Scheffler's consistency and DeChambeau's struggles allowed the PGA Tour to secure the win in just 16 holes. If you though it couldn't get worse for DeChambeau and Koepka, you'd be mistaken. The 16th hole saw LIV spend more time in the trees than the fairway. Still, despite the time in the woods, LIV had an opportunity to stay alive if Koepka could've sunk a 10-foot putt. Unfortunately, Koepka left the putt to the right, allowing Scheffler to take a two hole lead with only two holes to play. Given that LIV Golf needed both Koepka and DeChambeau to win their singles matches to have a chance, Koepka's missed putt gave the win to the PGA Tour. It was a fitting end to a forgettable day for LIV Golf. With three holes to play, both PGA Tour golfers are one up. DeChambeau actually won Hole 15 after McIlroy left his shot short of the creek on 15, forcing a very tough shot onto the green, while DeChambeau was already near the pin. However, it may not be enough for DeChambeau to overcome his deficit. Hole 14 saw LIV Golf win one of their matchups as Koepka defeated Scheffler, but DeChambeau continued to struggle, missing a putt that would've tied the hole with McIlroy. Following the missed putt, DeChambeau was noticeably upset. He put his head in his hands and covered his face for a few seconds before walking over and picking up his ball. While Scheffler and Koepka are tied through two holes of the final segment, DeChambeau is down two with only four holes to play. LIV Golf needs both DeChambeau and Koepka to win their matchups for any shot at the $10 million grand prize. LIV Golf needs to win each of their singles matchups – Scheffler vs. Koepka, McIlroy vs. DeChambeau – for any shot to win The Showdown, but the third and final segment got off to a rocky start. Hole 13 is a tough Par 3, but both McIlroy and Scheffler were able to earn pars. DeChambeau and Koepka each lipped out their par putts. It was close, but as has been the case all night, LIV Golf is constantly coming up just short. They are at a huge disadvantage with only five holes to play. Although it was much closer than the first segment, the PGA Tour duo of Scottie Scheffler and Rory McIlroy walked away from Hole 12 with a 2 segment to none lead over LIV Golf. DeChambeau and Koepka gave the PGA Tour a run for their money, winning Hole 11 to knot the score up, but after a missed putt opened the door, McIlroy's ever-faithful putter sealed the victory for his team. The PGA Tour only needs to halve the final segment – singles play – to secure the grand prize. LIV Golf finally got on the board with a win on Hole 11. PGA Tour's Rory McIlroy had an opportunity to earn a birdie with a mid-range putt, but missed. McIlroy was flabbergasted, and visibly upset with himself. That opened the door for Koepka to win the hole. He did just that. We head into Hole 12, the final hole of the second segment, with the teams knotted up. Each team needs 2.5 segments to win the event, meaning if DeChambeau and Koepka cannot win this last hole, their only hope for a win would be each of them winning their singles matches and forcing a playoff. It hasn't been a great showing for LIV Golf tonight, and Hole 10 was no different, but it could've been much worse. DeChambeau had an opportunity to birdie the hole and knot the second segment back up, but he lipped out. Over the broadcast, you could hear DeChambeau audibly say \"Are you kidding me?\" after the miss. Luckily, Scheffler lipped his birdie putt out as well, giving Koepka an opportunity to tie the hole, which he drained. Through four holes in the second segment, Scheffler and McIlroy are up one. After a terrific second shot by Scheffler, McIlroy was set up for an easy birdie to take the lead in the second segment. McIlroy's putter has been money all night, so it was nearly a guarantee as soon as Scheffler hit the green. Through three holes in the second segment, PGA Tour is up one. LIV Golf needs to win this segment for any hope at the prize money. Once again, McIlroy and Scheffler had an opportunity to take a lead in the second segment, but McIlroy's impressive putter failed them as he rolled the ball right of the hole on what would've been the hole-clinching putt. Through two in the second segment, it's still tied. LIV Golf was all over the yard on the first hole of the second segment, going from the rough off the tee to behind a bunker, but the pair did eventually earn a par to put the pressure on McIlroy and Scheffler. The PGA Tour had an opportunity to clinch it with a six-foot birdie putt for Scheffler, but Scheffler missed. Through one hole in the second segment, it's all knotted up. LIV Golf must win this segment to have any hope of winning the prize. After a terrific second shot by Bryson DeChambeau put him mere feet away from the pin, McIlroy rose to the occasion, opting for the ol' Texas wedge from way off the green. McIlroy drilled it, earning him an eagle, and putting the pressure on DeChambeau to nail his putt. DeChambeau lipped it left, and the PGA Tour (or solely McIlroy) won the first six-hole segment of the event in just four holes with a 3-hole lead with only two to play. The golfers will skip holes 5 and 6, jumping straight to 7 for the second segment, where each team will alternate shots. LIV Golf's comeback attempt hit another hurdle on the fourth hole as Koepka teed off into the water on the left side. Hole No. 4 is a Par 5, giving Koepka an opportunity for an up-and-down with two fantastic shots, but the odds of him making a difference here are slim. It appears up to DeChambeau to keep LIV Golf in the running for the first segment of this event. After the PGA Tour pair won each of the first two holes, Hole 3 went to neither group, making the odds of a LIV Golf comeback all the more improbable with only three holes to play. LIV Golf had an opportunity to win the hole with a birdie putt from DeChambeau, but it was left just right, enabling McIlroy and Scheffler to putt for par and earn a push. During the third hole, as the golfers walked to their shots, the TV crew and Koepka were poking fun at DeChambeau's big coat, saying that it looked big enough to fit both DeChambeau and Koepka. Afterwards, the crew mentioned that while DeChambeau and Koepka are \"good now,\" perhaps hopping in the same coat would be too much. For casual golf fans, that statement may have been confusing. But for folks who have followed golf over the last few years, the pair's feud was sure to be brought up at some point during the night. Here's a quick explainer: Emotions between DeChambeau and Koepka started running high after Koepka criticized DeChambeau's play at the 2019 Dubai Desert Classic. The pair continued taking subtle jabs at one another throughout the 2020 season, with the most viral moment coming after Koepka appeared visibly annoyed with DeChambeau after the latter walked through the former's interview and said something that the cameras couldn't pick up, but Koepka clearly heard. Their feud came to a head in 2021 after DeChambeau was showered with \"Brooksie\" chants throughout the PGA Tour season. It got so bad that the PGA Tour itself had to get involved, threatening to eject fans who taunted DeChambeau. Their differences have reportedly been squashed since, and the pair's decision to each sign with LIV Golf certainly helped them look past their grievances. With only six holes in the match play segment of this event, Rory McIlroy is putting the PGA Tour on his back, giving them an almost insurmountable two-hole lead after two holes. He's now birdied twice in a row and reminded everyone why you should never doubt Rory in match play. After both LIV and Scheffler parred the first hole, the pressure was on McIlroy to win the hole for the PGA Tour. McIlroy is not known for his clutch gene, but he came up big on this occasion, drilling the putt for the early lead. As a reminder, only the first six holes will be match play. The following six will be alternating shots, while the final six will be singles. After Scheffler was the only golfer to miss the fairway off the tee, the PGA Tour golfers bounced back on their second shots, each of them hitting the green. The same can't be said for the LIV duo. Koepka's shot bounced over the back of the green, just off the edge in the rough, while DeChambeau's shot fell short. After a coin toss on the first tee, it was revealed that the PGA Tour team of Scottie Scheffler and Rory McIlroy would have honors to start the event. Scheffler took the first shot ahead of McIlroy, and smoked an iron onto the right side rough, just off the fairway. Shadow Creek Golf Course is a notoriously narrow course, so we should expect to see a lot more play out of the thick stuff as the event unfolds. That said, Scheffler was the only player not to hit the fairway off the first tee. The Showdown golf event will be broadcast on TNT, and coverage will start at 6 p.m. The actual time to tee off has not yet been announced. Bryson DeChambeau, the 2024 U.S. Open champion, will team up with former rival Brooks Koepka, a five-time major winner, to represent LIV Golf. On the other side, 2024 Masters champion Scottie Scheffler will compete with four-time major champion Rory McIlroy, representing the PGA Tour. Scheffler, who won the 2022 and 2024 Masters tournament, is the world's No. 1 ranked golfer and just won PGA Tour Player of the Year in a landslide vote. McIlroy, currently ranked No. 3, won the PGA Champonship in 2012 and 2014, the U.S. Open in 2011 and the British Open in 2014. DeChambeau won the U.S. Open earlier this year after winning it for the first time in 2020. Koepka has won the PGA Championship three times (2018, 2019 and 2023) and the U.S. Open twice (2017 and 2018). But it could be a large hill to climb for DeChambeau and Koepka to stand a chance. The pair currently rank 10th and 86th, respectively. This will indeed be a lively event as the network is bringing on familiar faces from \"Inside the NBA.\" Ernie Johnson will be alongside Charles Barkley to call the action. As for commentary from the course, two-time Masters champion Bubba Watson will be alongside Lauren Jbara. The broadcast also gets a boost with experts Trevor Immelman and David Feherty. Odds via Draftkings. Golfweek: Scheffer/McIlroy: -155 Riley Hamel writes, \"This pick is pretty simple: one team has Scottie Scheffler, the other doesn't. He's on a different level than any other golfer on the planet at the moment, and he's a gamer. He wants to win no matter what he's competing in. I have a hard time seeing Scheffler and McIlroy losing this match, but it is Vegas — anything can happen.\" Bleacher Report: Scheffler and McIlroy win Kristopher Knox writes, \"McIlroy hasn't been as consistent this year, but he's still ranked third in the World Golf Rankings. DeChambeau and Koekpa are both elite golfers with Majors wins on their resumes. However, it's hard to envision anyone unseating Scheffler, even in a team event.\" Sports Illustrated: McIlroy/Scheffler Iain MacMillan writes, \"I'm going to lean with the favorites in the Showdown almost solely due to their recent form. Both Rory McIlroy and Scottie Scheffler are fresh off wins ahead of Tuesday’s event. McIlroy won the DP World Tour Championship last month and Scottie Scheffler captured his ninth victory of 2024, winning the Hero World Challenge. Not only is the No. 1-ranked golfer in the world coming off his win, but his new claw grip led to his best putting performance of the year. If his putting becomes a strength of his, he's going to be near invincible.\" According to TNT, the tee time should commence at 6 p.m. ET. However, it's safe to assume that there will be some fodder at the start of coverage, with actual golf taking place moments after the broadcast begins. Although most renditions of The Match are 12 holes long, this battle between the PGA Tour and LIV will be a full 18. Those 18 holes will be divided into three sections of six, with the first six being best ball, holes 7-12 being alternate shot, and singles closing out the final six holes. A whopping $10 million in prize money will be up for grabs, according a report last month by Front Office Sports. And, in a bit of a twist, it will be distributed to the participating golfers in the form of cryptocurrency. Title sponsor Crypto.com said in a news release that the event will be \"the first ever major golf tournament with a multimillion dollar purse to be paid in CRO cryptocurrency.\" (CRO stands for Cronos, which is the primary cryptocurrency of Crypto.com, a Singapore-based crypto exchange.) — Tom Schad SHOWDOWN PURSE:Golfers will be paid in crypto.

The first-of-its-kind competition marks the first time that PGA Tour players have competed against LIV Golf players outside of the majors and the Olympics, with DeChambeau and Koepka both unable to feature on the PGA Tour since joining the Saudi-backed circuit in 2022. Scheffler and McIlroy never trailed and needed only 14 holes to take victory at Shadow Creek Golf Course in Las Vegas. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player With four total points available – two in singles play – 2 1/2 points were needed for the victory and the final McIlroy/DeChambeau match was not played to completion, as the far-sharper PGA Tour duo claimed victory in dominant fashion. The format was one point for a six-hole fourballs match, one point for a six-hole foursomes match and one point each for singles over the last six holes. McIlroy came out firing and delivered the shot of the match with a 40-foot eagle putt on the par-five fourth hole with DeChambeau already in tight in two. But then DeChambeau missed his eagle try and the PGA Tour side was on its way, winning in four holes. \"Rory getting off to a great start was big for our team,\" Scheffler said.

Scheffler and McIlroy never trailed in singles and the match ended on the 16th hole without viewers getting a chance to see the signature par-three 17th at Shadow Creek. By virtue of claiming victory, Scheffler and McIlroy each won $5 million paid in cryptocurrency, adding to Scheffler's amazing year in which he won just over $62 million. Scheffler and McIlroy were each coming off victories - the American in the Bahamas two weeks ago, McIlroy in the DP World Tour finale in Dubai last month. DeChambeau, meanwhile, looked ring-rusty having not competed since LIV Golf ended its season on September 22 - whilst Koepka had not played since featuring at the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship in October. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player \"I'd love to have another opportunity,\" DeChambeau said. \"It was a bit of a pillow fight for us.\" As the rift thaws between the duelling tours, there is some belief that the competition in the Nevada desert could end up being a precursor to a full-blown Ryder Cup-style match between the two tours played over an entire weekend. \"Ideally, I think the end goal here is to get the game of golf back together,\" Scheffler said ahead of the unprecedented PGA Tour versus LIV Golf crossover clash. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player In August, PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan said he had been encouraged by \"enhanced\" negotiations with the Saudi Public Investment Fund, but warned no deadline has been set for a deal to be agreed. The PGA Tour, DP World Tour and PIF - financers of the breakaway LIV Golf League - signed a framework agreement in June 2023 that would combine the respective tours and seek to bring over $1bn of Saudi investment into the game of golf. Almost a year on from the original December 31 deadline, the PGA Tour and PIF remain in negotiations over the proposed agreement, with Monahan unable to commit a date on when negotiations will conclude. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player And the lack of timeline on a potential resolution has seemingly prompted the players to act and set up something like The Showdown. \"It was really about us taking this into our own hands a little bit and do something outside of either tour, to not only give back to the fans, but to show them or at least let them know we're trying,\" McIlroy said. \"The players want to play together more often.

                "content": "Rayful Edmond III (November 26, 1964 – December 2024) was an American drug trafficker in Washington, D.C. in the 1980s. Edmond was largely responsible for having introduced crack cocaine into the Washington, D.C. area during the crack epidemic, resulting in an escalating crime rate in the city which became known as the \"murder capital of the United States\".[1] Edmond was alleged to have moved large amounts of cocaine. In an indictment involving two of Edmond's associates Dwayne (D.C. Scorpio), it was said that they bought between 1,000 and 2,000 kilos per week in 1992 from the Trujillo-Blanco brothers, who were associated with the Medellin cartel, and sold the drugs to Washington area wholesalers. He was known to have spent some $457,619 in an exclusive Georgetown store (Linea Pitti, specializing in Italian men's clothing) owned by Charles Wynn who was later convicted on 34 counts of money laundering. Edmond's estimated revenue was approximately $300 million annually.[2] In one year, Edmond's organization, which employed 150 people, committed 30 murders.[3] Remarking on Edmond, longtime D.C. mayor Marion Barry wrote in his autobiography: He was a young, likable guy, good-looking, with a good personality, and a lot of his friends he played basketball with had no idea that he was involved in drug selling. He was basically pulled into it from his family. That doesn't make it right, but Rayful had a lot of people who liked him and were very loyal to him.[4] Edmond was an avid fan of the Georgetown Hoyas, and frequently sat courtside with his entourage at the Capital Centre for home games. At the height of his empire, he became very friendly with several Hoyas players. When Georgetown University basketball coach (and D.C. native) John Thompson confirmed what was happening, he sent word through his sources to have Edmond meet him at his office at McDonough Gymnasium. When Edmond arrived, Thompson was initially cordial, and informed Edmond that he needed to cease all contacts with his players,[5] specifically John Turner and Alonzo Mourning, both of whom had befriended Edmond.[6] However, Thompson's parting words to Edmond were that Edmond would face serious consequences if he did not stay away from his players.[7] It is believed that Thompson is the only person to stand up to Edmond without consequence,[8] initially causing some shock and surprise that there was no reprisal against Thompson for it. However, in a memoir published posthumously in December 2020, Thompson characterized the encounter very differently, calling it very respectful. Thompson asked Rayful if he would make sure that Alonzo and John were not wrapped up in any of the illegal activity. Rayful told Thompson that he would take care of it and both men left the meeting in agreement and with respect for each other as human beings. Rayful is quoted as saying afterwards, \"Coach Thompson is cool as hell\".[9] Edmond was arrested on April 15, 1989[10] at the age of 24. His arrest and subsequent trial were widely covered by local and national media. Judicial officials, fearful of reprisals from members of Edmond's gang, imposed unprecedented security during the trial. Jurors' identities were kept secret before, during, and after trial, and their seating area was enclosed in bulletproof glass. The presiding judge even barred the public from the trial in an effort to protect the jury.[3] Edmond was jailed at the maximum security Marine Corps Brig at Marine Corps Base Quantico in Virginia and flown to the Federal Court House in Washington, D.C. by helicopter each day for his trial. Authorities took this unusual step due to heightened fears of an armed escape attempt. Edmond was convicted of numerous federal violations: (1) Engaging in a Continuing Criminal Enterprise, under 21 U.S.C. §§ 848(b), 853 (Count One); (2) Conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute more than 5 kilograms of cocaine and more than 50 grams of cocaine base, under 21 U.S.C. § 846 (Count Two); (3) Unlawfully employing a person under 18 years of age, under 21 U.S.C. § 845b (Count Five); (4) Interstate travel in aid of racketeering, under 18 U.S.C. § 1952(a) (Count Eleven); (5) Unlawful use of a communications facility, under 21 U.S.C. § 843(b) (Counts Fourteen, Fifteen, Sixteen, and Eighteen).[11] On September 17, 1990, the District Court imposed sentences of mandatory life without parole on Count One, life without parole on Counts Two and Five, 60 months on Count Eleven, and 48 months on Counts Fourteen, Fifteen, Sixteen, and Eighteen. Edmond's sentences were to run concurrently.[11] Edmond was eventually sentenced to life in prison without parole. His mother, Constance \"Bootsie\" Perry,[12] was sentenced to 14 years in prison for participating in his criminal enterprise. Several of his sisters and cousins also received sentences.[11] Edmond continued to deal after being incarcerated in the Lewisburg Federal Penitentiary, in Pennsylvania. He hooked up with Dixon Dario and Osvaldo \"Chiqui\" Trujillo-Blanco (son of Griselda \"Godmother\" Trujillo Blanco) who shared the same cell block with him. Edmond was setting up deals between D.C. area traffickers and his Colombian connection while incarcerated. In 1996, Edmond and another drug dealer from Atlanta, named Lowe, were convicted after conducting drug business from a federal prison phone. Edmond received an additional 30-year sentence. In an interview with the Bureau of Prisons, Edmond said he had spent several hours every day on the telephone, occasionally using two lines simultaneously to conduct his drug business. Attorney General Eric Holder criticized the Federal Bureau of Prisons for its lax management that allowed drug deals to be conducted from inside prison.[13] In 1996, federal authorities revealed that Edmond had become a government informant.[13][14] With Edmond's cooperation, the government arrested 11 alleged drug dealers working in Washington D.C. In exchange, federal prosecutors agreed to seek a reduced sentence for Edmond's mother.[14] Edmond remained incarcerated but later became part of the United States Federal Witness Protection Program. The prison where he was held was not publicly disclosed by the government.[15] In 2019, Edmond returned to D.C. for hearings on whether his life sentence should be reduced to time served based on the information he provided to authorities concerning 20 homicides. At the time, a survey by the District of Columbia Attorney General showed that half of D.C. residents thought Edmond should be released.[15] In 2021, Judge Emmet G. Sullivan granted the government's request for early release, although Edmond has a separate 30-year sentence for running his operation from prison.[16] On July 31, 2024, Edmond was transferred from prison to a halfway house at an undisclosed location in Kentucky or Tennessee under the supervision of the Bureau of Prisons Nashville Residential Reentry Management Office.[17][18] On December 17, 2024, it was announced only a few months after his release from prison, that Edmond had died from a heart attack. He was 60.[19]",

                "content": "Share One of D.C.'s most infamous drug kingpins, Rayful Edmond, has died just months after being released from federal prison. His cause of death has not been released. Edmond was 60 years old. WASHINGTON - Officials have confirmed that notorious drug kingpin Rayful Edmond, the man accused of bringing the crack epidemic to D.C., has died at the age of 60. The Federal Bureau of Prisons confirmed that Edmond died Tuesday. He had been transferred from prison to a halfway house in Nashville at the end of July. His cause of death has not been released at this time. Rayful Edmond was an infamous cocaine kingpin who once reigned over Washington, D.C.'s drug trade. He was arrested at age 24 and sentenced in federal court in 1990 to life in prison for introducing crack cocaine to D.C., which contributed to the city earning the title of \"Murder Capital of the U.S.\" in the 1980s. PREVIOUS STORY: Rayful Edmond III's life sentence for cocaine-related charges in DC reduced by federal judge Edmond was convicted of running a criminal enterprise involving 150 people, raking in $300 million a year, and being responsible for at least 30 murders. He later received another 30-year sentence for dealing massive amounts of drugs from his Pennsylvania prison cell. After petitioning the court, he was released from federal prison at the end of July after serving more than three decades of a life sentence, and was remanded to community confinement in Tennessee. Notorious D.C. drug kingpin Rayful Edmond III has been transferred to community confinement in Nashville. According to officials, Edmond was transferred on Wednesday, July 31, to community confinement overseen by the Federal Bureau of Prisons' Nashville Residential Reentry Management Office. FOX 5 spoke with Tyrone Parker, a founding member of the D.C.-based organization Alliance of Concerned Men who knew Edmond for years following Edmond's release. \"He’s doing well. He’s happy as you can almost imagine. It’s a miracle that he’s home,\" Parker said. PREVIOUS STORY: Rayful Edmond's lawyer defends release of notorious DC drug kingpin: 'Give him a chance' \"Let’s give the man a chance,\" he said. \"Yes, he did some terrible things, but we’re talking about 33 years ago. Let’s give him an opportunity, especially if we think he could help us turn this ocean liner of violence around. And if he’s willing... who am I to say no? Not me.\" Jason Downs, who was Edmond's attorney for the past seven years told FOX 5 back in August that, \"He feels that he has served, and we believe that Mr. Edmond has served and paid his debt to society.\" The Federal Bureau of Prisons and FOX 5 reporting.

The Federal Bureau of Prisons confirmed Rayful Edmond III died suddenly Tuesday evening at a halfway house in Florida. Officials have not released the cause of death at this time. Edmond ruled the drug scene throughout the 80s, controlling nearly one third of the drug market in the District. Edmond, 60, was known at the height of his criminal empire as the “king of cocaine” in Washington, D.C. He oversaw a sprawling drug network that fueled the city’s devastating crack epidemic, contributing to a dramatic rise in homicides and the destruction of countless lives. Armed enforcers, wielding Uzi submachine guns, protected Edmond’s territory as he ran an operation linked to at least 30 murders, although none were directly attributed to him. In 1989, at the age of 24, Edmond was arrested and later sentenced to life in prison for his role in running a vast drug distribution network. His operation was estimated to be moving up to 1,700 pounds of cocaine per month, generating millions of dollars each week. At the time, Edmond was a household name in D.C., living a lavish lifestyle that included sponsoring local basketball tournaments and frequent trips to Las Vegas for high-profile boxing matches. Edmond was transferred to \"community confinement\" back in August. \"We can confirm that Rayful Edmond III was transferred (not released) on July 31, 2024, to community confinement overseen by the Federal Bureau of Prisons' Nashville Residential Reentry Management Office,\" said Scott Taylor, a spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Edmond was originally sentenced out of the Middle District of Pennsylvania to 30 years consecutive to his D.C. sentence of life in prison – which was reduced to 20 years in prison. At the time, officials said Edmond's assistance as an informant to bring justice to murder cases and putting dozens of other drug dealers in jail made him valuable and helped lower his sentence. Edmond's information and testimony over the years put away a killer responsible for 30 murders and helped unspool the Cali and Medellin cartel operations in the U.S. Investigators revealed Edmond was a cellmate of Pablo Escobar’s future brother-in-law. Retired prosecutor Richard Watkins said that after Edmond was caught in 1994 directing Colombian cocaine into D.C. using prison phones, he decided to cooperate with investigators despite the threat of death. He served more than 35 years in federal custody.

                "title": "Honda, Nissan in merger talks to form world's 3rd-biggest auto group",
                "content": "KYODO NEWS - 2 hours ago - 20:34 | All, Japan Honda Motor Co. and Nissan Motor Co. have begun talks on a merger that would create the world's third-biggest automaker group by volume, sources familiar with the matter said Wednesday, amid fierce global competition in electric vehicles dominated by overseas rivals. Japan's second- and third-largest automakers are considering the possibility of establishing a holding company, the sources said, in an apparent bid to form an automobile alliance to challenge Tesla Inc. of the United States and Chinese EV makers such as BYD Co. The talks come as speculation swirls among industry officials that Taiwan's electronics giant Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., has made a buyout offer for struggling Nissan, with some viewing the potential merger with Honda as a move by Nissan to thwart Foxconn's effort. \"We are considering collaboration. Other possibilities are also being considered, but nothing has been decided,\" Honda President Toshihiro Mibe told reporters. Honda, Nissan, and Mitsubishi Motors Corp., which partners with Nissan, said in a statement that they are \"considering various possibilities for future collaboration, but no decisions have been made.\" The merger would create an alliance that rivals industry giants Toyota Motor Corp. and Volkswagen AG in size, with combined sales reaching around 8 million vehicles if those of Mitsubishi Motors are included. Honda and Nissan agreed in March to commence a feasibility study on a strategic partnership in EV production and software technologies to cut costs and improve competitiveness, with Mitsubishi Motors joining the talks in August. At a press conference in August, Mibe said the talks did not involve a capital tie-up, although he did not deny such a possibility in the future. Global automakers are struggling to secure funds to cover increasingly high costs for EV development due to expensive batteries and the massive resources required for software development, such as autonomous driving functions. Honda, which traditionally preferred to develop cars in-house, has been ramping up collaboration with companies such as Sony Group Corp. and General Motors Co. in recent years. Nissan, which agreed to review its decades-old capital alliance with Renault SA last year in a deal that lowered the French automaker's influence over the Japanese company, has been exploring ways to increase its competitiveness. Honda and Nissan are facing slumping sales in China, where local brands with more affordable EVs are grabbing market share from Japanese automakers. Last month, Honda cut its net profit outlook for the current business year through March to 950 billion yen ($6.2 billion), which would represent a 14.2 percent decline from the previous year, due to weaker-than-expected auto sales in China. Also in November, Nissan unveiled a plan to cut 9,000 jobs and reduce global output capacity by 20 percent, saying its business in the United States and China continued to struggle. In 2023, Honda and Nissan sold 3.98 million and 3.37 million vehicles worldwide, respectively. The Toyota group sold 11.23 million vehicles that year, maintaining the top position for the fourth consecutive year, followed by Volkswagen with 9.24 million. Following media reports on the potential merger talks, trading of Nissan shares was briefly halted by the Tokyo Stock Exchange ahead of the Wednesday morning session but resumed after the companies issued the statement. Nissan shares closed nearly 24 percent higher at 417 yen, while Honda shares declined about 3 percent to 1,244 yen.

                "content": "Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Honda and Nissan are discussing a possible merger, potentially bringing together two Japanese automaking titans that have recently fallen on hard times. The companies said in statement that they have been in talks, but they offered no details or timeframe for when a deal – if one should develop – may be completed. It’s also not clear what shape the possible joint-venture could take. Nikkei first reported the news of a potential tie-up Tuesday. “As announced in March, Honda and Nissan are exploring various possibilities for future collaboration, leveraging each other’s strengths,” the companies said in a statement Tuesday. “If there are any updates, we will inform our stakeholders at the appropriate time.” Honda and Nissan also confirmed to CNN that Mitsubishi is part of these preliminary talks, bringing a potential third major Japanese car manufacturer into the mix. Mitsubishi did not respond to requests for comment. In March, Honda and Nissan announced that they would partner on electric vehicles and in August said they would collaborate on battery technology. But they could benefit from deepening their ties as both have faced challenges this year. Both companies, like many non-Chinese automakers, have struggled in the once-promising China market, the world’s largest market for cars. Chinese consumers had flocked to foreign brands but have largely shifted to domestic brands, which have better perceived value in the country. China’s government has also provided incentives to help speed up customer adoption of electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids. Although both companies offer EVs and plug-ins – Nissan, in particular, was a pioneer in EV technology – Chinese brands like BYD have eclipsed their technology and are priced more cheaply. Nissan has also struggled since its former CEO, Carlos Ghosn, became a fugitive, fleeing Japan for his native Lebanon. Ghosn was arrested in Tokyo in 2018 on suspicion of financial misconduct, and Nissan fired him. Ghosn has repeatedly denied the charges. His ouster shook up the powerful automaking alliance among Nissan, Renault and Mitsubishi. Once the largest automaking partnership in the world, Renault has since sharply reduced its ownership stake in Nissan, weakening the Japanese automaker. Nissan said that its operating income between March and September fell 90% from the same period in the previous year. Meanwhile Honda, which is roughly five times the size of Nissan, also faces challenges. The company announced plans to sell only zero-emission vehicles in major markets by 2040. But the transition has been slow going, as relatively low gas prices, insufficient charging infrastructure and increased competition have dragged down demand for EVs in the United States and Europe.

                "title": "Tom Cruise - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Thomas Cruise Mapother IV (born July 3, 1962) is an American actor and producer. Regarded as a Hollywood icon,[1][2][3] he has received various accolades, including an Honorary Palme d'Or and three Golden Globe Awards, in addition to nominations for four Academy Awards. His films have grossed over $12 billion worldwide,[4] placing him among the highest-grossing actors of all time.[5] One of Hollywood's most bankable stars, he is consistently one of the world's highest-paid actors.[6] Cruise began acting in the early 1980s and made his breakthrough with leading roles in Risky Business (1983) and Top Gun (1986). Critical acclaim came with his roles in the dramas The Color of Money (1986), Rain Man (1988), and Born on the Fourth of July (1989). For his portrayal of Ron Kovic in the latter, he won a Golden Globe Award and received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor. As a leading Hollywood star in the 1990s, he starred in commercially successful films, including the drama A Few Good Men (1992), the thriller The Firm (1993), the horror film Interview with the Vampire (1994), and the romance Jerry Maguire (1996). For the latter, he won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor. Cruise's performance in the drama Magnolia (1999) earned him another Golden Globe Award and a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Cruise subsequently established himself as a star of science fiction and action films, often performing his own risky stunts. He has played fictional agent Ethan Hunt in the Mission: Impossible film series since 1996. His other films in the genre include Vanilla Sky (2001), Minority Report (2002), The Last Samurai (2003), Collateral (2004), War of the Worlds (2005), Knight and Day (2010), Jack Reacher (2012), Oblivion (2013), Edge of Tomorrow (2014), and Top Gun: Maverick (2022). Cruise holds the Guinness World Record for the most consecutive $100-million-grossing movies, a feat that was achieved during the period of 2012 to 2018.[7] In December 2024, he was awarded the US Navy's highest civilian honor, the Distinguished Public Service Award, in recognition of his \"outstanding contributions\" to the military, with his screen roles.[8] Forbes ranked him as the world's most powerful celebrity in 2006.[9] He was named People's Sexiest Man Alive in 1990,[10] and received the top honor of \"Most Beautiful People\" in 1997.[11] Outside his film career, Cruise has been an outspoken advocate for the Church of Scientology. Cruise was born on July 3, 1962, in Syracuse, New York,[12] to electrical engineer Thomas Cruise Mapother III (1934–1984) and special education teacher Mary Lee (née Pfeiffer; 1936–2017).[13] His parents were both from Louisville, Kentucky,[14] and had English, German, and Irish ancestry.[15][16] Cruise has three sisters named Lee Anne, Marian, and Cass. One of his cousins, William Mapother, is also an actor who has appeared alongside Cruise in five films.[17] Cruise grew up in near poverty and had a Catholic upbringing. He later described his father as \"a merchant of chaos\",[18] a \"bully\", and a \"coward\" who beat his children. He elaborated, \"[My father] was the kind of person where, if something goes wrong, they kick you. It was a great lesson in my life—how he'd lull you in, make you feel safe and then, bang! For me, it was like, 'There's something wrong with this guy. Don't trust him. Be careful around him.'\"[18] Cruise's biological father died of cancer in 1984.[19] In total, Cruise attended fifteen schools in fourteen years.[20] Cruise spent part of his childhood in Canada; when his father took a job as a defense consultant with the Canadian Armed Forces, his family moved in late 1971 to Beacon Hill, Ottawa.[21] He attended the new Robert Hopkins Public School for his fourth and fifth grade education.[21][22] He first became involved in drama in fourth grade, under drama teacher George Steinburg. He and six other boys put on an improvised play to music called IT at the Carleton Elementary School drama festival.[21] Drama organizer Val Wright was in the audience and later said that \"the movement and improvisation were excellent ... a classic ensemble piece.\"[21] In sixth grade, Cruise went to Henry Munro Middle School in Ottawa. That year, his mother left his father, taking Cruise and his sisters back to the United States.[21] In 1978, she married Jack South.[23] Cruise briefly took a Catholic church scholarship and attended the St. Francis Seminary in Cincinnati; he aspired to become a Franciscan priest before leaving after a year. Priests at the seminary have said Cruise chose to leave the school when his family relocated again; however, a former classmate said that they were both asked to leave after getting caught taking liquor.[24][25]: 24–26 In his senior year of high school, he played football for the varsity team as a linebacker, but was cut from the squad after getting caught drinking beer before a game.[25]: 47 He went on to star in the school's production of Guys and Dolls.[26] In 1980, he graduated from Glen Ridge High School in Glen Ridge, New Jersey.[27] At age 18,[28] with the blessing of his mother and stepfather, Cruise moved to New York City to pursue an acting career.[26] After working as a busboy in New York, he went to Los Angeles to try out for television roles. He signed with CAA and began acting in films.[28] He made his film debut in a bit part in the 1981 film Endless Love, followed by a major supporting role as a crazed military academy student in Taps later that year. Cruise was originally supposed to appear as a background actor but his role was expanded after impressing director Harold Becker.[29] In 1983, Cruise was part of the ensemble cast of Francis Ford Coppola's The Outsiders. That same year he appeared in All the Right Moves and Risky Business, which has been described as \"A Generation X classic, and a career maker for Tom Cruise.\"[30] He also played the male lead in the Ridley Scott film Legend, released in 1985.[31] By 1986's Top Gun, his status as a superstar had been cemented.[32] Cruise followed up Top Gun with Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money (1986), which came out the same year, and which paired him with Paul Newman. Their chemistry won praise among critics with The Washington Post writing, \"One of the subtle achievements of both Cruise's and Newman's performances is that you feel that both of them are genuinely top-notch pool hustlers\".[33] In 1988, Cruise starred in Cocktail, a film that was a box office success but failed with critics. His performance earned him a nomination for the Razzie Award for Worst Actor. Later that year he starred with Dustin Hoffman in Barry Levinson's Rain Man, which won the Academy Award for Best Film.[34] In 1989, Cruise portrayed real-life paralyzed Vietnam War veteran Ron Kovic in Oliver Stone's war epic Born on the Fourth of July. Film critic Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote, \"Nothing Cruise has done will prepare you for what he does in Born on the Fourth of July ... His performance is so good that the movie lives through it. Stone is able to make his statement with Cruise's face and voice and doesn't need to put everything into the dialogue.\"[35] The performance earned him a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama, the Chicago Film Critics Association Award for Best Actor, the People's Choice Award for Favorite Motion Picture Actor, a nomination for BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role, and Cruise's first Best Actor Academy Award nomination.[36] Cruise's next films were Days of Thunder (1990) and Far and Away (1992), both of which co-starred then-wife Nicole Kidman as his love interest, followed by the legal thriller The Firm, which was a critical and commercial success. In 1994, Cruise starred along with Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas and Christian Slater in Neil Jordan's Interview with the Vampire, a gothic drama/horror film that was based on Anne Rice's best-selling novel. The film was well-received, although Rice was initially quite outspoken in her criticism of Cruise having been cast in the film, as Julian Sands was her first choice. Upon seeing the film, however, she paid $7,740 (equivalent to $15,911 in 2023) for a two-page ad in Daily Variety praising his performance and apologizing for her previous doubts about him.[37] In 1996, Cruise starred as superspy Ethan Hunt in the reboot of Mission: Impossible, which he also produced.[38] The film was directed by Brian De Palma and was a box office success. Film critic Stephen Holden of The New York Times praised Cruise's performance, declaring \"Tom Cruise has found the perfect superhero character on which to graft his breathlessly gung-ho screen personality.\"[39] In the same year, Cruise took on the title role in Cameron Crowe's sports drama Jerry Maguire playing a sports agent in search of love. The film was a massive financial success grossing more than $273 million worldwide against its $50 million budget.[40] In 1999, Cruise costarred with Kidman in Stanley Kubrick's erotic and psychological drama film Eyes Wide Shut. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian praised both Cruise and Kidman on their performances writing, \"Cruise in particular lays himself open in that fiercely committed way that he tries everything as an actor\".[41] That same year he took a rare supporting role, as a motivational speaker, Frank T.J. Mackey, in Paul Thomas Anderson's Magnolia (1999). Rolling Stone film critic Peter Travers heaped praise on Cruise writing, \"Cruise is a revelation, fully deserving of the shower of superlatives coming his way ... Cruise seethes with the chaotic energy of a wounded animal—he's devastating.\"[42] For his performance he received another Golden Globe and nomination for an Academy Award.[43] In 2000, Cruise returned as Ethan Hunt in the second installment of the Mission: Impossible films, Mission: Impossible 2. The film was helmed by Hong Kong director John Woo and branded with his gun fu style; it continued the series' success at the box office, taking in $547 million worldwide.[44] Unlike its predecessor, it was the highest-grossing film of the year,[45] but had a mixed critical reception.[46] Cruise received an MTV Movie Award for Best Male Performance for the film.[47] His next five films were major critical and commercial successes.[48][49] The following year, Cruise starred in the romantic thriller Vanilla Sky (2001) with Cameron Diaz and Penélope Cruz. In 2002, Cruise starred in the dystopian science fiction action film Minority Report, which was directed by Steven Spielberg and based on the short story by Philip K. Dick. It has since been included in lists of the greatest science fiction films of all time.[50][51][52] In 2003, he starred in Edward Zwick's period action drama The Last Samurai, for which he received a Golden Globe nomination for best actor.[53] In 2004, Cruise received critical acclaim for his performance as Vincent in Collateral. The critical consensus states that \"Driven by director Michael Mann's trademark visuals and a lean, villainous performance from Tom Cruise, Collateral is a stylish and compelling noir thriller.\"[54] In 2005, Cruise worked again with Steven Spielberg in War of the Worlds, a loose adaptation of the H. G. Wells novel of the same name, which became the fourth highest-grossing film of the year with $591.4 million worldwide.[55] Also in 2005, he was a nominee for the People's Choice Award for Favorite Male Movie Star[56] and the winner of the MTV Generation Award.[57] Cruise was nominated for seven Saturn Awards between 2002 and 2009, winning once. Nine of the ten films he starred in during the decade made over $100 million at the box office.[48] In 2006, he returned to his role as Ethan Hunt in the third installment of the Mission Impossible film series, Mission: Impossible III. The film was more positively received by critics than the previous films in the series and grossed nearly $400 million at the box office.[58] In 2007, Cruise took a rare supporting role for the second time in Lions for Lambs, which was a commercial disappointment. This was followed by an unrecognizable appearance as \"Les Grossman\" in the 2008 comedy Tropic Thunder with Ben Stiller, Jack Black, and Robert Downey Jr. This performance earned Cruise a Golden Globe nomination.[53] Cruise played the central role in the historical thriller Valkyrie released on December 25, 2008, to box office success.[59] In March 2010, Cruise completed filming the action-comedy Knight and Day, in which he re-teamed with former costar Cameron Diaz; the film was released on June 23, 2010.[60] On February 9, 2010, Cruise confirmed that he would star in Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol, the fourth installment in the Mission: Impossible series. The film was released in December 2011[61] to high critical acclaim[62] and box office success.[63] Unadjusted for ticket price inflation, it was Cruise's biggest commercial success to that date.[64] On May 6, 2011, Cruise was awarded a humanitarian award from the Simon Wiesenthal Center and its Museum of Tolerance for his work as a dedicated philanthropist.[65] In mid-2011, Cruise started shooting the movie Rock of Ages (2012), in which he played the fictional character Stacee Jaxx. The film was released in June 2012 and was a rare box-office misstep for Cruise.[66] Cruise however received positive reviews for his performance with Variety's film critic Justin Chang writing, \"Channeling the likes of Axl Rose and Keith Richards with his tattoos, heavy furs and even heavier eyeshadow, Cruise clearly relishes the opportunity to play against type even as he sends up his world's-biggest-movie-star identity, displaying a cock-of-the-rock strut that viewers haven't seen since his turn in Magnolia.\"[67] Cruise starred as Jack Reacher in the film adaptation of British author Lee Child's 2005 novel One Shot. The film was released on December 21, 2012.[68] It met with positive reviews from critics and was a box office success grossing $217 million worldwide.[69][70] In 2013, he starred in the science fiction film Oblivion based on director Joseph Kosinski's graphic novel of the same name. The film met with mixed reviews and grossed $286 million worldwide. It also starred Morgan Freeman and Olga Kurylenko.[71][72] In 2014, Cruise starred in the science fiction-action film Edge of Tomorrow, which received positive reviews[73] and grossed over $370 million.[74] In 2015, Cruise returned as Ethan Hunt in the fifth installment of the Mission: Impossible series, Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation, which he also produced.[75] Returning cast members included Simon Pegg as Benji and Jeremy Renner as William Brandt, with Christopher McQuarrie as director. The film earned high critical acclaim[76] and was a commercial success.[77] Cruise starred in the 2017 reboot of Boris Karloff's 1932 horror movie The Mummy.[78] The new film, also titled The Mummy, received negative reviews and disappointed at the box office, though still grossed over $400 million.[79][80] In 2018, Cruise again reprised Ethan Hunt, in the sixth film in his franchise, Mission: Impossible – Fallout. The film was more positively received by critics than the previous films in the series and grossed over $791 million at the box office.[81][82] Unadjusted for ticket price inflation, it was Cruise's biggest commercial success to date.[83] In May 2020, it was reported that Cruise would be starring in and producing a movie shot in outer space.[84] Doug Liman would be directing, writing, and co-producing. Both will fly to the International Space Station as part of a future Axiom Space mission in a SpaceX Dragon 2 spacecraft.[85] In May 2021, Cruise protested against the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA) by returning all three of his Golden Globe Awards in light of controversy surrounding the HFPA,[86] particularly its lack of diversity, specifically no black members, and ethical questions related to financial benefits to some of its members.[87] In 2022, Cruise reprised his role as Captain Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell in Top Gun: Maverick, a film which he also produced. The film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival where Cruise earned an Honorary Palme d'Or.[88] The film was released to widespread critical praise, with many reviewers deeming it superior to its predecessor.[89] The film broke several box office records upon its release; earning over $1 billion, becoming the highest-grossing film of his career.[90] Cruise earned $100 million for the film, when combining ticket sales, his salary, and his cut of home entertainment rentals and streaming revenues.[91] Cruise reprised his role as Ethan Hunt in Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One which was released in theaters on July 12, 2023. The film received critical acclaim, but was a box office disappointment due to the box-office and cultural phenomenon dubbed Barbenheimer, which was the same-day release of Christopher Nolan's historical epic film Oppenheimer and Greta Gerwig's fantasy comedy Barbie.[92] Peter Debruge of Variety praised Dead Reckoning for its performances, action sequences and a satisfying ending, writing, \"This outing may be one-half of a two-part finale, but it gives audiences enough closure to stand on its own\".[93] In 2024, he appeared in the Paris 2024 Olympics closing ceremony to promote Los Angeles 2028 Summer Olympics, by jumping from the roof of the Stade de France stadium in Paris. He took the flag from Mayor Karen Bass and athlete Simone Biles.[94] Cruise will reprise the role in the second part, Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning, due for release in May 2025.[95][96] He will also star in Judy, directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu which will be his first film at Warner Bros. Pictures in ten years.[97][98] Cruise partnered with his former talent agent Paula Wagner to form Cruise/Wagner Productions in 1993,[99] and the company has since co-produced several of Cruise's films, the first being Mission: Impossible in 1996 which was also Cruise's first project as a producer. In addition, Cruise has produced films in which he does not appear in, namely The Others, Shattered Glass, Elizabethtown, Narc, Ask the Dust, and Without Limits.[100] Cruise is noted as having negotiated some of the most lucrative film deals in Hollywood and was described in 2005 by Hollywood economist Edward Jay Epstein as \"one of the most powerful—and richest—forces in Hollywood.\" Epstein argues that Cruise is one of the few producers (the others being George Lucas, Steven Spielberg and Jerry Bruckheimer) who are regarded as able to guarantee the success of a billion-dollar film franchise. Epstein also contends that the public obsession with Cruise's tabloid controversies obscures full appreciation of Cruise's exceptional commercial prowess.[101] On August 22, 2006, Paramount Pictures announced it was ending its 14-year relationship with Cruise. In The Wall Street Journal, chairman of Viacom (Paramount's parent company) Sumner Redstone cited the economic damage to Cruise's value as an actor and producer from his controversial public behavior and views.[102][103] Cruise/Wagner Productions responded that Paramount's announcement was a face-saving move after the production company had successfully sought alternative financing from private equity firms.[104] Industry analysts such as Edward Jay Epstein commented that the real reason for the split was most likely Paramount's discontent over Cruise/Wagner's exceptionally large share of DVD sales from the Mission: Impossible franchise.[105][106] In November 2006, Cruise and Paula Wagner announced that they had taken over the film studio United Artists.[99] Cruise acts as a producer and star in films for United Artists, while Wagner serves as UA's chief executive. Production began in 2007 of Valkyrie, a thriller based on the July 20, 1944, assassination attempt against Adolf Hitler. The film was acquired in March 2007 by United Artists. On March 21, 2007, Cruise signed to play Claus von Stauffenberg, the protagonist. This project marked the second production to be greenlighted since Cruise and Wagner took control of United Artists. The first was its inaugural film, Lions for Lambs, directed by Robert Redford and starring Redford, Meryl Streep and Cruise. In August 2008, Wagner stepped down from her position at United Artists; she retained her stake in UA, which combined with Cruise's share amounted to 30 percent of the studio.[107] Cruise began working with Paramount again as a producer and star with Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol, without Wagner, which was a critical and commercial success. He and Wagner would collaborate for the final time on the modestly successful Jack Reacher series, also for Paramount.[108] In January 2024, it was announced that his production company was forming a new strategic partnership with Warner Bros. Discovery to develop and produce original and franchise films.[109][110] In 2006, Premiere ranked Cruise as Hollywood's most powerful actor,[111] as Cruise came in at number 13 on the magazine's 2006 Power List, being the highest ranked actor.[112] The same year, Forbes magazine ranked him as the world's most powerful celebrity.[113] The founder of CinemaScore in 2016 cited Cruise and Leonardo DiCaprio as the \"two stars, it doesn't matter how bad the film is, they can pull [the box office] up.\"[114][115] October 10, 2006, was declared \"Tom Cruise Day\" in Japan; the Japan Memorial Day Association said that he was awarded with a special day because of \"his love for and close association with Japan.\"[116] While reviewing Days of Thunder, film critic Roger Ebert noted the similarities between several of Cruise's 1980s films and nicknamed the formula the \"Tom Cruise Picture\".[117] Ebert listed nine key ingredients that make up the Tom Cruise Picture: the Cruise character, the mentor, the superior woman, the craft he must hone, the arena it takes place in, the arcana or knowledge he must learn, the trail or journey, the proto enemy, and the eventual enemy of the character. Some of Cruise's later films like A Few Good Men and The Last Samurai can also be considered to be part of this formula. Widescreenings compares two of these Cruise characters in an article on the film A Few Good Men: [screenwriter] Aaron Sorkin interestingly takes the opposite approach of Top Gun, where Cruise also starred as the protagonist. In Top Gun, Cruise plays Mitchell who is a 'hot shot' military underachiever who makes mistakes because he is trying to outperform his late father. Where Maverick Mitchell needs to rein in the discipline, Daniel Kaffee needs to let it go, finally see what he can do.[118] Cruise is an aerobatic pilot and was inducted as part of the Living Legends of Aviation in 2010, receiving the Aviation Inspiration and Patriotism Award from the Kiddie Hawk Air Academy. In addition to other aircraft, Cruise owns a P-51 Mustang.[119] Cruise splits his time between homes in Beverly Hills, California;[120] Clearwater, Florida;[121] and the South of England, where Cruise has lived in various places such as Central London, Dulwich,[122] East Grinstead,[123] and Biggin Hill.[124] In the early-to-mid-1980s, Cruise had relationships with Melissa Gilbert,[125] Rebecca De Mornay,[126] Patti Scialfa,[127] and Cher.[128] Cruise married actress Mimi Rogers on May 9, 1987.[129] They divorced on February 4, 1990. Rogers had grown up in Scientology and was one of its 'auditors';[130] they met when Cruise became one of her clients.[131] In a 1993 Playboy interview, Rogers discussed her split from Cruise and said that he had been considering becoming a monk, which affected their intimacy. Rogers later retracted the comments and claimed she had been misinterpreted.[132][133] Rogers received a $4 million divorce settlement.[132] Cruise met his second wife, actress Nicole Kidman, on the set of their film Days of Thunder (1990). The couple married on December 24, 1990. They adopted two children: Isabella Jane (born 1992) and Connor Antony (born 1995). On February 5, 2001, the couple's spokesperson announced their separation.[134] Cruise filed for divorce two days later, and their marriage was dissolved later that year, with Cruise citing irreconcilable differences.[135] In a 2007 interview with Marie Claire, Kidman noted the incorrect reporting of a miscarriage early in her marriage: \"It was wrongly reported as miscarriage by everyone who picked up the story. So it's huge news, and it didn't happen. I had a miscarriage at the end of my marriage, but I had an ectopic pregnancy at the beginning of my marriage.\"[136] Cruise was next romantically linked with Penélope Cruz, his co-star in Vanilla Sky (2001). Their three-year relationship ended in 2004.[137] An article in the October 2012 issue of Vanity Fair stated that several sources have said that after the breakup with Cruz, Scientologist leaders launched a secret project to find Cruise a new girlfriend. According to those sources, a series of \"auditions\" of Scientologist actresses resulted in a short-lived relationship with Iranian-British actress Nazanin Boniadi, who subsequently left Scientology.[138] Scientology and Cruise's lawyers issued strongly worded denials and threatened to sue, accusing Vanity Fair of \"shoddy journalism\" and \"religious bigotry\".[139] Journalist Roger Friedman later reported that he received an email from director and ex-Scientologist Paul Haggis confirming the story.[140][141] In April 2005, Cruise began dating actress Katie Holmes. On April 27 that year, Cruise and Holmes—dubbed TomKat by the media—made their first public appearance together in Rome.[142] A month later, Cruise publicly declared his love for Holmes on The Oprah Winfrey Show; he jumped on Winfrey's yellow couch and stood there to make the announcement. On October 6, 2005, Cruise and Holmes announced they were expecting a child.[143] In April 2006, their daughter Suri was born. On November 18, Holmes and Cruise were married at the 15th-century castle Castello Orsini-Odescalchi in Bracciano, in a Scientologist ceremony attended by many Hollywood stars.[144][145] Their publicists said the couple had \"officialized\" their marriage in Los Angeles the day before the Italian ceremony.[146] There has been widespread speculation that their marriage was arranged by the Church of Scientology.[147][148] David Miscavige, the head of Scientology, served as Cruise's best man.[149] On June 29, 2012, Holmes filed for divorce from Cruise.[150][151] On July 9, the couple signed a divorce settlement worked out by their lawyers.[152] New York law requires all divorce documents remain sealed, so the exact terms of the settlement are not publicly available.[153] Cruise stated that ex-wife Katie Holmes divorced him in part to protect the couple's daughter Suri from Scientology and that Suri is no longer a practicing member of the organization.[154] In 1998, Cruise successfully sued the Daily Express, a British tabloid which alleged that his marriage to Kidman was a sham designed to cover up his homosexuality.[155] In May 2001, Cruise filed a lawsuit against gay porn actor Chad Slater. Slater had told the celebrity magazine Actustar that he had been involved in an affair with Cruise. This claim was strongly denied by Cruise,[156] and Slater was ordered to pay $10 million to Cruise in damages after Slater declared he could not afford to defend himself against the suit and would therefore default. Cruise requested a default judgment, and in January 2003, a Los Angeles judge decided against Slater after he admitted that his claims were false.[157][158] Cruise also sued Bold Magazine publisher Michael Davis for $100 million, because Davis had alleged that he had video that would prove Cruise was gay. The suit was dropped in exchange for a public statement by Davis that the video was not of Cruise, and that Cruise was heterosexual.[159] In 2006, Cruise sued cybersquatter Jeff Burgar to obtain control of the TomCruise.com domain name. When owned by Burgar, the domain redirected to information about Cruise on Celebrity1000.com. The decision to turn TomCruise.com over to Cruise was handed down by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) on July 5, 2006.[160] In 2009, magazine editor Michael Davis Sapir[161] filed a suit charging that his phone had been wiretapped at Cruise's behest. That suit was dismissed by a Central Civil West court judge in Los Angeles on the grounds that the statute of limitations had expired on Sapir's claim.[162][163] In October 2012, Cruise filed a lawsuit against In Touch and Life & Style magazines for defamation after they claimed Cruise had \"abandoned\" his six-year-old daughter.[164] During deposition, Cruise admitted that \"he didn't see his daughter for 110 days\". The suit was settled the following year.[165] Cruise was converted to Scientology by his first wife, Mimi Rogers, in 1986 and became an outspoken advocate for the Church of Scientology in the 2000s. His involvement in the organization was leaked by the tabloid Star in 1990, and he publicly announced he followed Scientology in a 1992 interview with Barbara Walters. Cruise has said that Scientology, and Study Technology in particular, helped him overcome his dyslexia.[166][167] Cruise has been a close friend of Scientology leader David Miscavige since the 1980s.[168][169] Several years after Cruise started studying Scientology, the organization's leaders promised to share some Scientology secrets with him,[170] including information about the extraterrestrial ruler Xenu. According to Janet Reitman's book Inside Scientology: The Story of America's Most Secretive Religion (2011), Cruise \"freaked out\" and took a step back from the Church to work on the film Eyes Wide Shut.[170] In 1999, Marty Rathbun was sent by David Miscavige to convince Cruise to return to the Church and continue his studies.[170] Cruise later sparked controversy in the 2000s with his efforts to promote Scientology.[170] In the aftermath of 9/11, Cruise co-founded and raised donations for Downtown Medical to offer New York City rescue workers \"detoxification therapy\", drawing criticism from medical professionals and firefighters.[171][172] In late 2004, David Miscavige created the Scientology Freedom Medal of Valor and awarded it to Cruise for this work.[173] Former Scientologist Paul Haggis has claimed that Cruise attempted to convert several celebrities to Scientology, including James Packer, Victoria and David Beckham, Jada Pinkett, Will Smith, and Steven Spielberg.[169] Since 2008, Cruise has restricted interviewers from asking him about Scientology.[174] As well as promoting various programs to introduce people to Scientology, Cruise campaigned for Scientology to be recognized as a religion in Europe. In 2005, the Council of Paris revealed that Cruise had lobbied French Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy and Senate President Jean-Claude Gaudin; they described Cruise as a militant spokesman for Scientology and barred any further dealings with him.[175][176] In January 2004, Cruise said, \"I think psychiatry should be outlawed.\"[177] In 2005, he criticized actress Brooke Shields for using the drug Paxil (paroxetine), an antidepressant which she used to recover from postpartum depression after the birth of her first daughter in 2003. Cruise asserted that there is no such thing as a chemical imbalance and that psychiatry is a form of pseudoscience. In response, Shields argued that Cruise \"should stick to saving the world from aliens and let women who are experiencing postpartum depression decide what treatment options are best for them.\"[178] This led to a heated argument between Cruise and Matt Lauer on NBC's Today on June 24, 2005.[179][180] Medical authorities view Cruise's comments as furthering the social stigma of mental illness.[181] From The Lancet, \"He may be right that psychotropic drugs are overused, sometimes misused; and that lifestyle changes (and exercise for depression) can be helpful. But he is wrong, as a celebrity, to add to the burden of those with a mental illness, who often fear seeking or continuing treatment because of the stigma still attached to their condition.\"[181] Shields called Cruise's comments \"a disservice to mothers everywhere\".[182] In late August 2006, Cruise apologized in person to Shields for his comments.[183] Scientology is well known for its opposition to mainstream psychiatry and psychoactive drugs that are routinely prescribed for treatment.[173] It was reported that Cruise's anti-psychiatry actions led to a rift with director Steven Spielberg.[184] Spielberg had reportedly mentioned in Cruise's presence the name of a doctor friend who prescribed psychiatric medication. Shortly thereafter, the doctor's office was picketed by Scientologists, reportedly angering Spielberg.[185] On January 15, 2008, a video produced by the Church of Scientology featuring an interview with Cruise was posted on YouTube by the Anonymous-linked group Project Chanology, showing Cruise discussing what being a Scientologist means to him.[186][187] The Church of Scientology said the video had been \"pirated and edited\", and was taken from a three-hour video produced for members of Scientology.[187][188] YouTube removed the Cruise video from their site under threat of litigation.[189] It was subsequently reinstated on the site, and as of June 2020, the video has achieved over 15 million views.[190] In March 2004, his publicist of 14 years, Pat Kingsley, resigned. Cruise's next publicist was Lee Anne DeVette, his sister, who was herself a Scientologist. She served in that role until November 2005.[191] DeVette was replaced with Paul Bloch from the publicity firm Rogers and Cowan.[192] Such restructuring was seen as a move to curtail publicity of his views on Scientology, as well as the controversy surrounding his relationship with Katie Holmes.[193] Lawrence Wright's 2013 book Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief and Alex Gibney's 2015 television documentary adaptation of the same name cast a spotlight on Cruise's role in Scientology. The book and the film both allege that the Scientology organization groomed romantic partners for Cruise and that Cruise used Sea Org and Rehabilitation Project Force workers as a source of free labor.[194][169] In the film, Cruise's former auditor Marty Rathbun claims that wife Nicole Kidman was wiretapped on Cruise's suggestion, which Cruise's lawyer denies.[195][196] Cruise's ex-girlfriend Nazanin Boniadi later compared the Scientology organization's auditioning of women to date Cruise and experiences with him to \"white slavery\".[197]",

                "content": "Our editors will review what you’ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article. Tom Cruise (born July 3, 1962, Syracuse, New York, U.S.) is an American actor who emerged in the 1980s as one of Hollywood’s most popular leading men, known for his clean-cut good looks and versatility. Cruise, who took up acting in high school, made his film debut in Endless Love (1981). He had supporting roles in such movies as Taps (1981) and The Outsiders (1983) before starring as a high-school senior who turns his parents’ home into a brothel in Risky Business (1983). The movie was a major success, earning Cruise widespread recognition. His star status was cemented with Top Gun (1986), the highest-grossing film of that year, in which he played a navy jet pilot. In 1986 Cruise appeared opposite Paul Newman in The Color of Money, which was directed by Martin Scorsese, and two years later starred as an autistic man’s selfish brother in Rain Man. For his portrayal of a Vietnam War veteran turned activist in Born on the Fourth of July (1989), Cruise received his first Academy Award nomination. Cruise went on to exhibit a broad depth and range of characters in his films during the 1990s, playing such diverse roles as a navy lawyer in A Few Good Men (1992), a vampire in Interview with the Vampire (1994), and a secret agent in Mission: Impossible (1996); the immense popularity of the latter film led to sequels in 2000, 2006, 2011, 2015, 2018, and 2023. His performance as a sports agent in Jerry Maguire (1996) earned Cruise a second Oscar nomination. In 1999 he starred with his then-wife, Nicole Kidman, in the highly anticipated final film of director Stanley Kubrick, Eyes Wide Shut (1999), an examination of marital fidelity that drew mixed reviews. That year Cruise also earned acclaim as a misogynistic self-help guru in Magnolia, for which he received an Academy Award nomination for best supporting actor. Cruise starred in a number of action films in the 2000s, including the science-fiction thriller Minority Report (2002), directed by Steven Spielberg; The Last Samurai (2003), in which he played a disaffected U.S. soldier who aligns himself with a samurai community; and the gritty Los Angeles-set Collateral (2004), in which he took on the role of an obdurate contract killer. He reteamed with Spielberg on War of the Worlds (2005), a visually impressive adaptation of the H.G. Wells novel of the same name. In 2008 Cruise earned laughs as an abrasive movie executive in the comedy Tropic Thunder, and he portrayed the historical figure Col. Claus von Stauffenberg, a German army officer who organized an attempt to assassinate Adolf Hitler, in Valkyrie. Cruise subsequently starred in the action thrillers Knight and Day (2010) and Jack Reacher (2012). In the latter he played a former army investigator, a role he reprised in Jack Reacher: Never Go Back (2016). After appearing as a 1980s rock idol in the musical Rock of Ages (2012), he was cast as an apocalypse survivor in the sci-fi adventure Oblivion (2013). He then portrayed a glib military public relations officer who is repeatedly killed and resurrected in the comic alien-invasion romp Edge of Tomorrow (2014). In 2017 Cruise starred in the action-horror film The Mummy and the antic drama American Made. For Top Gun: Maverick (2022), he reprised his role from the 1986 blockbuster. Cruise’s personal life often attracted as much attention as his acting. His marriage to Kidman was followed closely by the Hollywood media, as was their divorce in 2001. Over the next few years, his outspoken support of Scientology proved controversial, especially his 2005 public denouncement of psychiatry as an illegitimate science (a view held by Scientologists). Cruise continued to find attention in tabloids and entertainment media through his public relationship with actress Katie Holmes, to whom he was married from 2006 to 2012.",

                "content": "Actor Tom Cruise has starred in the box-office hits Risky Business, Top Gun, Jerry Maguire, and the Mission: Impossible franchise. Tom Cruise wrapped up the 2024 Paris Olympics with a death-defying stunt. During the Olympics closing ceremony on August 11, the actor jumped off the roof of Stage de France and propelled down to the stadium’s floor on a cable, where he greeted athletes and snapped a few selfies as he walked toward the stage. Once on stage, Cruise shook hands with gymnast Simone Biles and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, who handed him the Olympic flag. The Mission: Impossible star then secured the flag to the back of his motorcycle and took off. The 62-year-old then appeared in a previously filmed video clip that showed Cruise driving through the streets of Paris and boarding a plane headed to Los Angeles, symbolizing the passing of the torch from the Paris Games to the Los Angeles Olympics in summer 2028. Cruise put on skydiving gear and jumped out of the plane, soaring through Los Angeles and past the Hollywood sign, which he redesigned to feature the Olympic rings in place of the two Os at the end of Hollywood. Cruise is famous for doing many of his own stunts in his movies, including the Mission: Impossible and Top Gun franchises. Ahead of the release of Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One in July 2023, he told Entertainment Tonight that his most dangerous stunt took years of practice to perfect: “You have to be razor sharp when you do something like that.” Actor Tom Cruise has been one of the most prominent movie stars in Hollywood dating back to the 1980s. After developing an interest in acting during high school, he rocketed to fame with his turns in Risky Business and Top Gun. Cruise has since become an action movie veteran, counting the Mission: Impossible franchise, Edge of Tomorrow, and Top Gun: Maverick among his many successes. The four-time Oscar nominee has also earned acclaim for his performance in Born on the Fourth of July, Jerry Maguire, and Magnolia. Off the silver screen, Cruise is one of the most high-profile members of the Church of Scientology and has been married to fellow actors Nicole Kidman and Katie Holmes. FULL NAME: Thomas Cruise Mapother IVBORN: July 3, 1962BIRTHPLACE: Syracuse, New YorkSPOUSES: Mimi Rogers (1987-1990), Nicole Kidman (1990-2001), and Katie Holmes (2005-2012)CHILDREN: Isabella, Connor, and SuriASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Cancer Thomas Cruise Mapother IV, better known as Tom Cruise, was born on July 3, 1962, in Syracuse, New York. The third of four children, Tom was the only son of Mary Lee South and Thomas Cruise Mapother III. Cruise’s mother was an amateur actor and schoolteacher, and his father was an electrical engineer. His family moved around a great deal when young Tom was a child to accommodate his father’s career. Tom’s parents divorced when he was 11, and the children moved with their mother to Louisville, Kentucky, and then to Glen Ridge, New Jersey, after she remarried. Like his mother and three sisters, Cruise suffered from dyslexia, which made academic success difficult for him. He excelled in athletics, however, and considered pursuing a career in professional wrestling until a knee injury sidelined him during high school. At age 14, Cruise enrolled in a Franciscan seminary with thoughts of becoming a priest, but he left after a year. When he was 16, a teacher encouraged him to participate in the school’s production of the musical Guys and Dolls. After Cruise won the lead of Nathan Detroit, he found himself surprisingly at home on the stage, and a career was born. Cruise set a 10-year deadline for himself in which to build an acting career. He left school and moved to New York City, where he struggled through audition after audition before landing an appearance in 1981’s Endless Love, starring Brooke Shields. Around this same time, he snagged a small role in the military school drama Taps (1981), co-starring Sean Penn. His role in Taps was upgraded after director Harold Becker saw Cruise’s potential, and his performance caught the attention of a number of critics and filmmakers. In 1983, Cruise appeared in Francis Ford Coppola’s The Outsiders, which also starred Emilio Estevez, Matt Dillon, and Rob Lowe—all prominent members of a group of young actors the entertainment press dubbed the “Brat Pack.” The movie wasn’t well received, but it allowed Cruise to work with an acclaimed director on a high-profile project. His next movie, Risky Business (1983), grossed $65 million and become one of the most profitable movies at the box office that year. It also made Cruise a highly recognizable actor—thanks in no small part to a memorable scene of the young star dancing in his underwear. In 1986, after a two-year hiatus, the budding actor released the big-budget fantasy film Legend, which did poorly at the box office. That same year, however, Cruise’s A-list status was confirmed with the release of Top Gun, which co-starred Kelly McGillis, Anthony Edwards, and Meg Ryan. The testosterone-fueled action-romance, set against the backdrop of an elite naval flight school, became the highest-grossing movie of 1986. Decades later, Cruise returned to his role as fighter pilot Pete “Maverick” Mitchell in the action-packed sequel Top Gun: Maverick (2022), which picks up more than 30 years after the original. Critics heaped praise on the movie, and in addition to becoming the second highest-grossing film of the year, it earned an Oscar nomination for Best Picture. Cruise is set to star in a third movie, Top Gun 3, which doesn’t yet have a release date. Cruise followed the tremendous success of the original Top Gun with a string of both critically acclaimed and commercially successful films. First up was The Color of Money (1986) with co-star Paul Newman, then Cruise worked with Dustin Hoffman on Rain Man (1988). Cruise’s next role, as Vietnam veteran Ron Kovic in the biopic Born on the Fourth of July (1989), earned him an Academy Award nomination and a Golden Globe for Best Actor. In 1992, Cruise proved once more that he could hold his own opposite a screen legend when he co-starred with Jack Nicholson in the military courtroom drama A Few Good Men. The movie grossed more than $15 million its first weekend and earned Cruise another Golden Globe nomination. He continued to demonstrate his success as a leading man with The Firm (1993) and Interview with the Vampire (1994), which co-starred Brad Pitt. Next, Cruise hit the big screen with another huge action hit: the $64 million blockbuster Mission: Impossible (1996). In addition to starring in the movie, Cruise also served as a producer. The movie’s popularity spawned another action franchise for Cruise. The long-awaited smash hit Mission: Impossible 2 arrived in 2000 followed by the also popular Mission: Impossible 3 in 2006. However, Cruise was faced with a professional setback that August when Paramount Pictures ended its 14-year relationship with the actor. The company’s chairman cited Cruise’s erratic behavior and controversial views as the reason for the split, though industry experts noted that Paramount more likely ended the partnership over the actor’s high earnings from the Mission: Impossible franchise. Ultimately, Cruise and Paramount patched up their relationship and have continued adding films to the franchise. That includes Mission: Impossible—Ghost Protocol (2011), Mission: Impossible—Rogue Nation (2015), Mission: Impossible—Fallout (2018), and most recently, Mission: Impossible—Dead Reckoning (2023). The same year as the first Mission: Impossible movie, Cruise landed another hit with the highly acclaimed Jerry McGuire (1996), directed by Cameron Crowe. The star secured a second Academy Award nomination and won his second Golden Globe for Best Actor. Cruise and then-wife Nicole Kidman spent much of 1997 and 1998 in England shooting Eyes Wide Shut, an erotic thriller that was director Stanley Kubrick’s final film. The movie came out in the summer of 1999 to mixed reviews, but that same year, Cruise enjoyed greater success with the release of Magnolia. His performance as a self-confident sex guru in the ensemble film earned him another Golden Globe Award and an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. In 2002, Cruise starred in Vanilla Sky, his second collaboration with director Cameron Crowe, as well as Steven Spielberg’s Minority Report. The following year, Cruise traveled to Australia to shoot the $100 million war epic The Last Samurai, which earned him another Golden Globe nomination. Cruise proved he remained a top draw by starring in the Steven Spielberg–directed remake of the science-fiction classic War of the Worlds (2005), which grossed more than $230 million at the box office. The third Mission: Impossible movie added to his list of credits in May 2006, but three months later, his partnership with Paramount Pictures, the franchise’s studio, ended. Cruise quickly rebounded with an announcement early that November: He had a new partnership with film executive Paula Wagner and the United Artists film studio. Their first production as a team, the political drama Lions for Lambs (2007), proved a commercial disappointment despite a strong cast that included Meryl Streep and Robert Redford. Taking a break from weighty material, Cruise delighted audiences with his performance in the comedy Tropic Thunder (2008). Despite his relatively small role in a movie that featured Robert Downey Jr. and Ben Stiller, Cruise stood out by obscuring his trademark good looks to play a balding, obese movie studio executive. In December 2008, Cruise released his second project through United Artists. The film, Valkyrie, was a World War II drama about a plot to assassinate German leader Adolf Hitler. Cruise starred as a German army officer who became involved in the conspiracy. Breaking into new territory after another entry in the Mission: Impossible franchise in 2011, Cruise starred in the 2012 musical Rock of Ages. Although Cruise received some positive reviews for his performance as a rock star, the movie failed to attract much of an audience. Returning to his mainstream action roots, Cruise anchored the 2012 crime drama Jack Reacher, based on a book by Lee Child. He then headlined a pair of science-fiction adventures: Oblivion (2013) and Edge of Tomorrow (2014). Showing no signs of slowing down, the veteran actor in 2015 delivered his usual high-energy performance for the fifth installment of his blockbuster Mission: Impossible franchise. In 2016, Cruise reprised the role of Jack Reacher for Jack Reacher: Never Go Back. He then headlined a reboot of The Mummy (2017), which performed respectably at the box office but was savaged by critics, before earning better reviews later that year for the crime thriller American Made. Cruise is one of the most prominent celebrity members of the Church of Scientology. He became a student of the religion, founded by writer L. Ron Hubbard, through his first wife, Mimi Rogers. Cruise credited the church with curing his dyslexia, and he soon became one of its leading proponents. In 2005, Cruise made headlines as an outspoken Scientologist. He openly criticized his former Endless Love co-star Brooke Shields for using anti-depressants during her recovery from postpartum depression. He also denounced psychiatry and modern medicine, claiming Scientology held the key to true healing. Cruise’s statements led to a heated argument with news anchor Matt Lauer on The Today Show in June 2005, for which Cruise later apologized. Cruise has been married three times, all to fellow actors, and has three children. He first wed Mimi Rogers in 1987 but their union ended three years later. Cruise wasn’t single for long. Also in 1990, he connected with Nicole Kidman, his co-star in the racecar drama Days of Thunder. The movie was unpopular among critics and fans alike, but the two lead actors had real chemistry. On Christmas Eve 1990, after a brief courtship, Cruise and Kidman married in Telluride, Colorado. For much of the 1990s, Cruise and Kidman found themselves fiercely defending the happiness and legitimacy of their marriage. They filed two different lawsuits against tabloid publications for stories they considered libelous. In each case, the couple received a published retraction and apology, along with a large monetary settlement which they donated to charity. During the first half of their marriage, the couple adopted two children, Isabella and Connor. On February 5, 2001, Cruise and Kidman announced their separation after 11 years of marriage. The couple cited the difficulties involved with two acting careers and the amount of time spent apart while working. Following the divorce, Cruise briefly dated his Vanilla Sky co-star Penelope Cruz followed by a much-publicized relationship with actor Katie Holmes. A month after his ties to Holmes became public, Cruise professed his love for Holmes in a now-famous appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show, during which he jumped on Winfrey’s sofa, shouting “Yes!” In June 2005, after a two-month courtship, Cruise proposed to Holmes in a restaurant at the top of the Eiffel tower. In October, they announced that they were expecting their first child together. The hasty proposal and surprise pregnancy quickly became tabloid gossip. In 2006, Cruise and Holmes welcomed their daughter, Suri. That November, they were married in an Italian castle, with celebrities Will Smith, Jada Pinkett Smith, Jennifer Lopez, and Victoria and David Beckham among those in attendance. However, the storybook romance didn’t last, and in June 2012, Holmes filed for divorce.

                "content": "Bob Lee (December 20, 1979 – April 4, 2023) was an American businessman and software engineer who was best known for helping to create the financial service Cash App. He was the chief technology officer of Square and the chief product officer of MobileCoin. On April 4, 2023, Lee was fatally stabbed in the Rincon Hill neighborhood of San Francisco.[1] The San Francisco Police Department arrested Nima Momeni for Lee's killing on April 13, 2023.[2] Lee was born in St. Louis, Missouri, on December 20, 1979.[3][4] Tim Oliver Lee is his brother.[5] While attending Lindbergh High School,[6] Lee wrote a 3D rendering engine in Turbo Pascal[7] and became known as \"Crazy Bob\" for his exuberant energy in playing water polo.[8] Lee attended Southeast Missouri State University and pledged the Sigma Chi fraternity.[8] On August 7, 2001, Lee released a free program to defend Microsoft IIS servers from Code Red, which was at the time a rapidly spreading computer worm.[9] Lee worked for Southeast Missouri State University as a web developer.[10] By 2003, Lee was employed as a technical architect at AT&T. While at AT&T, Lee developed the aspect-oriented programming (AOP) framework dynaop similar to the Spring Framework for Java, featured in Oracle Magazine.[11] Lee was employed at Google as a staff software engineer from October 2004[12] to January 2010[13] and helped develop the Android mobile operating system.[14] Lee co-authored the dependency injection framework Guice with Kevin Bourrillion in 2006 while at Google to modularize AdWords.[15][16] Lee developed Guice based on ideas he had for Apache Struts, which he concurrently worked on.[17] In 2008, Lee and Bourrillion were awarded the Jolt Award for their work on Guice.[18] Lee transferred to the core libraries team in 2007,[19] eventually leading the team.[20] In May 2009, Lee created a Java dependency injection proposal with Rod Johnson.[21] He was also part of the expert group for a Java proposal that added lambda expressions, as well as another proposal to add concurrency to the language.[22] Additionally, Lee worked on Dalvik, an Android process virtual machine.[23] During Oracle v. Google, Lee was called as a witness.[24] In January 2010, the e-commerce company Square recruited Lee.[13] He became the company's chief technology officer and led development on the company's Android app, eventually taking over development on Square's iOS app from now-deceased co-founder Tristan O'Tierney.[25] After becoming the chief technology officer, Lee moved to San Francisco from his St. Louis, Missouri home.[26] In 2013, he helped Square build Cash App, then Square Cash. He left Square in 2014, investing in several tech startups, including Clubhouse, SpaceX, and Figma.[20][27] During the COVID-19 pandemic, Lee assisted the World Health Organization with its app.[28] In 2021, he joined the cryptocurrency payment firm MobileCoin as its chief product officer.[29] Lee had polydactyly before undergoing surgery.[7] In 2019, following the death of Lee's mother, his father moved to Mill Valley, California, to live with Lee's family. In 2019, Lee and his wife, Krista, separated. The couple had two children together.[30][31] In October 2022, Krista and Lee's two children stayed in the Bay Area when Lee moved to Miami to live with his father.[32] In the early morning of April 4, 2023, Lee was stabbed in the chest and hip while he was on the 300 block of Main Street in the Rincon Hill neighborhood of San Francisco.[27] Police were called to the scene at 2:35 a.m. local time. CCTV footage shows a wounded Lee stumbling to a parked car that had its hazard lights on, and lifting his shirt to show his wound; the car immediately drove away, after which Lee collapsed on the ground. By the time police arrived on the scene, he was unconscious. He was taken to a local hospital where he died from his injuries at the age of 43.[33][34][29] He had been stabbed in the hip and heart, and had called 911 begging for help.[35] The autopsy report released by the San Francisco medical examiner's office showed that he suffered knife wounds to his heart and lung.[36] The autopsy also revealed evidence of alcohol, cocaine, and ketamine consumption in Lee's system.[37] On April 13, the San Francisco Police Department arrested 38-year-old Nima Momeni of Emeryville (born August 1984) for the murder of Lee.[38] Momeni was born in Tehran, the capital of Iran. At the age of 14, Nima, along with his mother and sister, fled to the United States to get away with their abusive father in 1999.[39] He had been working in the technology industry since 2005 and allegedly knew Lee.[40] The nature of how Lee and Momeni knew each other or a motive was not initially revealed. However, on May 14, 2023, The Wall Street Journal reported that Lee and Khazar Elyassnia (Momeni's sister) had a \"casual sexual relationship\" despite her being married and that Lee had dated Momeni's ex-girlfriend three years before his death. Hours before Lee's death, Momeni had confronted Lee about whether or not his sister was doing drugs or anything else with Lee that Momeni considered inappropriate due to Elyassnia's marriage. Lee had attended several house parties with Elyassnia before his death and had taken several drugs with her at the time of his death. Elyassnia was also arrested for driving under the influence, but the charges were later dismissed.[41][42] On December 17, 2024, Momeni was found guilty of second-degree murder after a seven-day deliberation.[43][44] Randall Knox, an attorney who briefly represented Momeni's mother, Mahnaz Tayarani Babai, said that the jury had a lot to consider. Tayarani then later spoke to the cameras on both KNTV and KGO-TV shortly after the verdict saying that her son was the kindest and had never done anything wrong before the murder despite him having a history of drug abuse.[45]",

                "content": "By Charisma Madarang Nima Momeni was found guilty of second-degree murder on Tuesday in the fatal stabbing of Cash App founder Bob Lee, according to the NBC Bay Area. The outlet reported that a San Francisco jury rejected the tech consultant’s claim that he acted in self defense, and that he faces 16 years to life in prison. A status hearing to determine the sentencing date was set for Jan. 10. “I would like to thank the jury for their service in this trial,” District Attorney Brooke Jenkins said in a statement. “I would also like to thank Mr. Lee’s family for their trust and faith in my office through this long journey to get justice. Although nothing will bring back Mr. Lee, I hope that this verdict brings his family and friends some closure as they work to heal from this devastating loss. Mr. Lee was loved deeply by many and his killing shocked all of us locally with reverberations felt across the country.” Tony Brass, an attorney for Momeni, said the verdict was “obviously very disappointing for us,” and that his team would evaluate for an appeal. Momeni was arrested on April 13, 2023, for Lee’s murder, nearly two weeks after Lee had been found dripping blood and calling for help on the streets of San Francisco. The Cash App founder was taken to a nearby hospital where he was later pronounced dead. Prosecutors argued that Momeni planned the attack on Lee, driving him to a secluded area under the Bay Bridge. The said Momeni was angry at Lee for introducing his younger sister to a drug dealer she said gave drugs and then sexually assaulted her, and that Momeni stabbed Lee three times.

Momeni claimed that he didn’t realize he had fatally stabbed Lee or that he had wounded him. “We think justice was done here today,” Lee’s brother, Tim Oliver, told the outlet. “What matters today is that we had a guilty verdict and Nima Momeni is going away for a very long time.” We want to hear it.

The jury found Momeni not guilty of first-degree murder, meaning jurors decided the murder of Lee was not premeditated. Lee was fatally stabbed on the streets of downtown San Francisco in April 2023. During the trial, prosecutors painted a dramatic picture of Lee’s two-day drug binge with Khazar Momeni, the sister of his murderer, which preceded his death. Prosecutors alleged that Lee’s friend and drug dealer had sexually assaulted Khazar during the escapade, leading to a heated exchange in which Nima ultimately stabbed Lee with a kitchen knife from his sister’s home. However, the defense told a different story. Nima Momeni told the jury he was out on a walk with Lee under the Bay Bridge on the night of the stabbing, trying to convince Lee to spend more time at home with his family instead of out partying. The defense alleged that Lee became frustrated and attacked Momeni with a knife during that conversation, leading Momeni to retaliate in self-defense and grab the weapon from Lee. Momeni told jurors he had no animosity toward Lee. However, video evidence of the event indicated that Momeni was the aggressor, and forensic testing found Momeni’s DNA on the knife’s handle. The punishment for first-degree murder is often harsher than the punishment for second-degree murder, but both typically come with lengthy prison sentences. Momeni is facing 16 years to life in prison, with sentencing to come at a later date. Lee was 43 and the chief product officer at the cryptocurrency company MobileCoin at the time of his death. Prior to that, he led technology development at Jack Dorsey’s Block, where he created the mobile payment service Cash App, and was also an investor in SpaceX, Clubhouse, Tile, and Figma. In his early 20s, he helped develop the Android operating system at Google. At the time of Lee’s death, his colleagues and peers praised his contributions to the technology world. The CEO of Figma, Dylan Field, noted how Lee first met with him when he was 14 and was an early supporter of Figma. Dorsey said Lee was instrumental to creating Square, which then became Block. Initially after Lee’s murder, many speculated that the tech executive’s death was random and related to San Francisco’s homelessness and crime problem. In fact, it turned out that Lee knew the killer.

                "content": "Michael Steven Bublé OC OBC (IPA: /buːˈbleɪ/ boo-BLAY; born September 9, 1975[1]) is a Canadian singer and songwriter. Born in Burnaby, British Columbia, he is often credited for helping to renew public interest and appreciation for traditional pop standards and the Great American Songbook. Bublé has sold over 75 million records worldwide,[2] and won numerous awards, including five Grammy Awards[3] and fifteen Juno Awards.[4] In 2003, Bublé's first album reached the top ten in Canada and the United Kingdom. He found a worldwide audience with his 2005 album It's Time and his 2007 album Call Me Irresponsible – which reached number one on the Canadian Albums Chart, the UK Albums Chart, the US Billboard 200, the Australian ARIA Albums Chart and several European charts. His 2009 album Crazy Love debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 after three days of sales, and remained there for two weeks. It was also his fourth number-one album on Billboard's Top Jazz Albums chart. His 2011 holiday album, Christmas, was in first place on the Billboard 200 for the final four weeks of 2011 and the first week of 2012, totalling five weeks atop the chart, it also made the top 5 in the United Kingdom. With this, Christmas became his third-consecutive number-one album on the chart. To Be Loved was released in April 2013, followed by Nobody but Me in October 2016 and Love in November 2018. Michael Steven Bublé was born in Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada,[5] on September 9, 1975, the son of Lewis Bublé, a fisherman,[6][7] and Amber (née Santaga), a homemaker.[8][9] Bublé's paternal and maternal great-grandparents immigrated to Canada from Italy.[10][11] His surname was originally spelled \"Bubli\", and some of his paternal ancestors came from Istria.[12][13][6] Bublé stated: \"[On the side of the family native to modern-day Croatia] some say we're Yugoslavian, others that we're Italian.\"[14] He has two younger sisters,[15] Brandee, a children's book author, and Crystal, an actress. He and his siblings were raised Roman Catholic. He attended Seaforth Elementary School and Cariboo Hill Secondary School.[16] According to an Oprah Winfrey interview on October 10, 2009, Bublé dreamed of becoming a famous singer since he was two. When he was a teenager, he slept with his Bible and prayed to become a singer.[17][18] His interest in jazz began at around age five when his family played Bing Crosby's White Christmas album.[19][20][21] His musical influences include Frank Sinatra,[22] Dean Martin,[23] Tony Bennett,[24] Elvis Presley, Bobby Darin[25] and Sam Cooke.[26] The first time his family noticed his singing talent was during the Christmas holidays, when Bublé was 13 years old, and they heard him powerfully sing the phrase \"May your days be merry and bright\" when the family was singing to the song \"White Christmas\" on a car ride.[17][27] Bublé also has a strong passion for ice hockey and wanted to become a professional hockey player for the Vancouver Canucks growing up, but believed he was not good enough.[28] \"I wanted so bad to be a hockey player... If I was any good at hockey, I probably wouldn't be singing right now.\"[29] He often played hockey in his youth, watched Vancouver Canucks games with his father, and said that he \"went to every single home game as a kid... I remember I wanted to be Gary Lupul, I wanted to be Patrik Sundstrom and Ivan Hlinka. I used to think that being named Michael Bublé was pretty cool because I was close to being called Jiri Bubla.\"[30] Bublé shared his hockey interest with his grandfather.[31] From the age of 14, Bublé spent six years working during the summer as a commercial fisherman with his father and crewmates.[32][33] He called the experience \"the most deadly physical work I'll ever know in my lifetime. We'd be gone for two, sometimes three months at a time and the experience of living and working among guys over twice my age taught me a lot about responsibility and what it means to be a man.\"[15] His first singing engagements were in nightclubs at age 16 and were facilitated by his Italian grandfather Demetrio Santagà,[34] a plumber from Preganziol, Treviso,[35] who offered his plumbing services in exchange for stage time for his grandson.[15] Bublé's grandfather paid for his singing lessons. Both his voice teacher, Sandi Siemens, and his maternal grandfather never stopped believing that he would become a star. Bublé's maternal grandmother, Iolanda (née Moscone),[36] was also Italian, from Carrufo, L'Aquila.[37][38] Bublé grew up listening to his grandfather's collection of jazz records and credits his grandfather in encouraging his love for jazz music. \"My grandfather was really my best friend growing up. He was the one who opened me up to a whole world of music that seemed to have been passed over by my generation. Although I like rock and roll and modern music, the first time my granddad played me the Mills Brothers, something magical happened. The lyrics were so romantic, so real, the way a song should be for me. It was like seeing my future flash before me. I wanted to be a singer and I knew that this was the music that I wanted to sing.\"[39] Bublé never stopped believing he would become a star but admitted he was probably the only one who believed in his dream, stating that even his maternal grandfather thought Bublé was going to be \"an opening act for somebody in Las Vegas\".[40] He stated he never learned to read and write music, using only emotion to drive his songwriting ability.[28][41][42] At age 18, Bublé entered a local talent contest and won, but was disqualified by organizer Bev Delich for being underage. Delich entered him in the Canadian Youth Talent Search. After Bublé won that contest, he asked Delich to be his manager. Delich represented him for the next seven years, during which Bublé worked diligently at any job that came along: clubs, conventions, cruise ships, hotel lounges, shopping malls, and talent shows.[27][33] In 1996, Bublé appeared in TV's Death Game (also known as Mortal Challenge) as a Drome Groupie. Also in 1996, he appeared (uncredited) in two episodes of The X-Files as a member of a submarine crew. His first national TV performance was on a 1997 award-winning Bravo! documentary titled Big Band Boom!, directed by Mark Glover Masterson. Beginning in 1997, he became a frequent guest on Vicki Gabereau's national talk show on the CTV network. During its first season, the Vancouver-based programme aired live, which ultimately worked in Bublé's favour. When a scheduled guest was forced to cancel, the show's music producer often asked Bublé to fill in at the last minute. The Gabereau appearances provided Bublé with great exposure, but they also helped the singer hone his television skills as a performer and as an interview guest. In a mutual show of gratitude, Bublé appeared on the final Gabereau show in 2005, along with Jann Arden and Elvis Costello.[43] Bublé received two Genie Award nominations for Best Original Song in 2000 for \"I've Never Been in Love Before\" and \"Dumb ol' Heart\", two songs he wrote for the film Here's to Life!.[44] He recorded three independent albums: First Dance (1996), Babalu (2001), and Dream (2002).[45][46] Michael McSweeney, an aide to former prime minister Brian Mulroney, saw Bublé's performance at a business party[47] and received a copy of Bublé's self-financed independent album. McSweeney showed the album to Mulroney and his wife. Bublé subsequently was invited to sing at the wedding of Mulroney's daughter, Caroline, where he sang Kurt Weill's \"Mack the Knife\".[47] At the wedding, Bublé was introduced to David Foster, a multiple Grammy Award-winning producer and record executive who previously had worked with artists such as Madonna, Brandy Norwood, Whitney Houston, Michael Jackson, Céline Dion, Barbra Streisand, Kenny G, Cher, Josh Groban, and Andrea Bocelli.[47][48] David Foster was reluctant to sign Bublé to his 143 Records label[49] because he \"didn't know how to market this kind of music\". Bublé moved to Los Angeles with his agent for a brief period to convince Foster to sign him. Eventually, Foster agreed to produce an album for him if he raised $500,000 to cover the costs of the production (which Bublé did). Foster ended up covering the costs of production under his label, with no assurances of support from Warner Brothers. Additionally, Bublé received the personal stamp of approval and support of Foster's friend, musician and songwriter Paul Anka. After David Foster agreed to produce Bublé's debut album, Bruce Allen, whom Bublé had pursued for years to be his manager, also signed Bublé.[49] Bublé appeared as a karaoke singer in Duets in 2000 and a club owner in Totally Blonde in 2001.[50] Bublé's self-titled debut album was released on February 11, 2003, by 143 Records/Reprise Records. The album features a range of standards from various eras including \"Fever\", \"The Way You Look Tonight\", \"For Once in My Life\", \"Moondance\" and \"You'll Never Find Another Love Like Mine\". Also on the album is \"How Can You Mend a Broken Heart?\", with Barry Gibb of the Bee Gees singing backing vocals. The album went to the top 10 in Canada, United Kingdom, South Africa and reached No. 1 in Australia. It was No. 33 on the ARIA Top 100 Albums of 2003.[51] Bublé appeared nationally on television in the United States on the Today program on February 14, 2003.[19] In November 2003, Bublé released a Christmas EP Let it Snow, containing five previously unreleased tracks, that peaked at 56 on the Billboard 200. The title track reached the top 40 of the Australia singles chart. A live DVD/CD called Come Fly with Me was released in early 2004. The Come Fly with Me CD was No. 99 on the Aria Top 100 Albums of 2004.[51] The DVD included live footage and behind-the-scenes footage of Bublé's first world tour. The CD included three new studio tracks, two live recordings of new songs, and three live recordings of songs from the album Michael Bublé. The album peaked at 55 on the Billboard 200. In November 2004, the Christmas edition of his debut album was released as a two-disc set that included both the Michael Bublé and the Let It Snow EP. Bublé won New Artist of the Year at the 2004 Juno Awards, and his album was nominated for Album of the Year but lost to Sam Roberts. He appeared in the 2003 film The Snow Walker. Also in 2003, he played a lounge performer on an episode of Days of Our Lives.[19] In 2004, he appeared as himself in Las Vegas.[52] Songs from Bublé's debut album (\"For Once in My Life\", \"Kissing a Fool\") were released on the soundtrack for the movie Down with Love (2003).[53] The soundtrack also included a previously unreleased duet with Holly Palmer of the movie's title theme. The Junkie XL remix of the theme for the 1960s TV cartoon version of Spider-Man from Bublé's Babalu album was played during the closing credits of Spider-Man 2 (2004), and this version was also released as a single. A CD was released in 2003 of the 7 songs that Bublé sang for Totally Blonde, calling it Totally Bublé. Bublé collaborated with the Barenaked Ladies for \"Elf's Lament\", a song on their 2004 Christmas album Barenaked for the Holidays.[54] Bublé's second studio album, It's Time, was released on February 8, 2005, again by 143/Reprise Records. The album also included standards from a variety of eras including \"You Don't Know Me\", \"Feeling Good\", \"Can't Buy Me Love\", \"Save the Last Dance for Me\", \"Song for You\", and \"Quando, Quando, Quando\" (a duet with Canadian pop singer Nelly Furtado). It also included an original track, \"Home\", co-written by Bublé, his musical director Alan Chang, and Amy Foster-Gilles. The album reached No. 1 in Canada, Italy, Japan, and on the Billboard Top Jazz chart, No. 2 in Australia, and No. 7 on the Billboard 200. Additionally it reached the top 10 in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Norway, Austria, and Sweden. The album spent 104 weeks on the Billboard Top Jazz chart, including a record-breaking 78 weeks in the No. 1 spot. It's Time was Billboard's Top Jazz Album in both 2005 and 2006. The first single, \"Feeling Good\", met with little commercial success. However, the second single from the album, \"Home\", reached No. 1 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary Tracks chart and No. 72 on the Billboard Hot 100.[55] The third single \"Save the Last Dance for Me\" reached No. 5 on the Billboard AC Track Chart and No. 99 on the Billboard Hot 100.[55] In 2005, he appeared in a commercial for Starbucks' Frappucino line, singing his single \"Come Fly with Me\". The single appeared as a bonus track for a Starbucks edition release of It's Time.[56] He won four Juno Awards in 2006: Album of the Year and Pop Album of the Year (It's Time), Single of the Year (\"Home\"), and Artist of the Year.[57] He was nominated twice for a Grammy in the category Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album in 2006 (It's Time) and 2007 (Caught in the Act), but lost both times to Tony Bennett. In 2007, Bublé received one Juno nomination, for Fan Choice, but lost to Nelly Furtado.[58] Bublé's third studio album, Call Me Irresponsible, was released on May 1, 2007, by 143/Reprise Records. His third effort included songs from different eras such as \"Always on My Mind\", \"Dream\", \"I've Got the World on a String\", and \"Comin' Home Baby\" (a duet with Boyz II Men). In the US, the album debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 and rose to number one in its second week.[59] His fourth studio album, Crazy Love, was set to be released by 143/Reprise Records on October 13, 2009.[60] However, an early release in the United States happened on October 9, 2009,[61] in which Bublé appeared on Oprah that same day and performed the album's first single \"Haven't Met You Yet\". The album was also promoted in an interview with George Stroumboulopoulos on The Hour on October 17, 2009,[62] and on the December 22, 2009 episode of The Glenn Beck Program.[63] This album contains 12 tracks (and one bonus track), including two original songs co-written by Bublé, \"Haven't Met You Yet\" and \"Hold On\".[64] Its first single, \"Haven't Met You Yet\", was released August 31, 2009, and reached No. 1 on Billboard's Canadian Adult Contemporary chart.[65] Most of the tracks off the album were recorded live because Bublé did not want his album to sound overproduced and slick.[66] Bublé wrote the opening part for his cover on the single \"Cry Me a River\" in Bond-like theme because he wanted the song to sound very cinematic and bombastic.[67] Crazy Love debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart,[68] becoming Bublé's fourth No. 1 album on Billboard's Top Jazz Albums chart. It also debuted at No. 1 in Australia and Canada, where it became his fastest-selling album. The album was supported by the Crazy Love Tour. During the tour, Bublé performed two nights at the new Aviva Stadium in Dublin, Ireland, which were the first concerts to take place at the venue.[69] On April 18, 2010, Bublé won four Juno Awards for Juno Fan Choice Award, Single of the Year (\"Haven't Met You Yet\"), Album of the Year (Crazy Love) and Pop Album of the Year (Crazy Love),[57] plus two Juno nominations for Artist of the Year and Songwriter of the Year. Crazy Love producers David Foster and Bob Rock both received two separate nominations of their own for the Jack Richardson Producer of the Year Award, with Bob Rock winning the award.[57][70] Bublé re-released Crazy Love on October 25, 2010, in the US, with an earlier release date of October 15, 2010 for Europe. The special edition is called \"Crazy Love: Hollywood Edition\",[71] and contains several bonus tracks including Bublé's newest single, \"Hollywood\", co-written with Toronto songwriter and pianist Robert G. Scott.[72] On September 7, 2010, \"Hollywood\" was released worldwide on radio and as a digital single on iTunes. He recently played to 100,000 people at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin, his biggest concert to date.[71] In October 2011, Bublé released his fifth studio album, Christmas, which rose to the top of the US and UK charts.[73][74] Christmas has been the best-selling Christmas album in Australia each year since its release.[75] Bublé took part in the torch relay in Vancouver before the opening ceremony of the 2010 Winter Olympics.[76] He performed on the Today Show on February 12, the day of the opening ceremony and during the broadcast on Grouse Mountain. The introduction for his song \"Cry Me a River\" was chosen as the theme for the BBC's coverage of the Winter Olympics.[77] He performed with other Canadian celebrities at the closing ceremony, singing a version of \"Maple Leaf Forever\" and appearing as a Mountie but having his uniform torn off to reveal a white tuxedo.[78] He appeared in the TV special Michael Bublé's Canada, which aired on Australian cable television in January, ahead of the 2010 Winter Games.[79] He was a guest on the comedy TV program Colbert Report for Colbert's 2010 Vancouver Winter Games coverage.[80] In 2009, he appeared with neuroscientist Daniel Levitin on the television program My Musical Brain, which was based on Levitin's book This Is Your Brain on Music. Also in 2009, he took part in series 6 of The X Factor in the UK. He was the celebrity mentor for the finalists in week 3 and also appeared on the finale, duetting with Stacey Solomon. He was featured in an ITV special called This Is Michael Bublé. On February 23, 2011, he was the narrator of BBC Radio 2's Song Stories \"My Way\".[81] Bublé released To Be Loved on April 15, 2013 (regional releases include April 22 in Canada and April 23 in the US). The lead single, \"It's a Beautiful Day\", was released on February 25, 2013.[82] To Be Loved debuted at number-one on the Billboard 200, becoming the crooner's fourth consecutive number-one album on the chart.[83] He was featured in the ITV documentary Michael Bublé's Day Off which aired on June 30, 2013. On December 18, 2013, he performed his 3rd Annual Christmas Special with NBC. Special guests included Mariah Carey, Mary J. Blige, Queen Latifah, and David Foster.[84][85] The To Be Loved Tour was the fifth concert tour by Canadian singer Michael Bublé. Launched in support of his sixth studio album To Be Loved (2013), the tour began on June 30, 2013, with a series of ten concerts at The O2 Arena in London and ended on March 22, 2015, in Johannesburg.[86] To advertise Michael Bublé's Christmas in Hollywood on NBC, he released a Christmas song called \"The More You Give (The More You'll Have)\". His seventh studio album, Nobody but Me, was released on October 21, 2016.[87] The titular lead single features Black Thought of The Roots and was released on August 19, 2016. During the same month, his perfume went on sale in thirty countries.[88] His eighth studio album Love (written as the heart emoji, ❤️) was released on November 16, 2018, with the first single \"When I Fall in Love\" preceding it on September 27, 2018. In November, he announced he would embarking on a tour in 2019 in honor of the album; his An Evening with Michael Bublé tour kicked off in Tampa on February 13, 2019.[89][90] On December 15, 2018, Bublé was the musical guest for the final of the sixteenth edition of BBC's Strictly Come Dancing.[91] On January 17, 2019, it was announced that Bublé would star in a Super Bowl commercial for Bubly sparkling water.[92] On January 29, 2022, Bublé announced that his ninth studio album, Higher, would be released on March 25. The album was his first studio album since Love (2018).[93] Dancing With The Stars on Disney+ celebrated \"Michael Bublé Night\" on October 24, 2022, with Bublé serving as a guest judge, and performing two songs, including Higher. On May 13, 2024, it was announced that Bublé would be featured as a coach on the 26th season of The Voice.[94] Bublé will return as a coach for the 27th season in early 2025.[95] Bublé resides in Burnaby, British Columbia with his wife and children. He once had a home in Croydon, London.[96] He holds dual Italian and Canadian citizenship.[34][35][97] An avid hockey fan since childhood, he is a prominent celebrity supporter of the Vancouver Canucks. Since December 2008, he has co-owned the Vancouver Giants.[98] Bublé requires \"one local team hockey puck\" in his dressing room as part of his contract to concert promoters in every city.[28] On February 12, 2009, he pledged a donation of A$50,000 to the victims of the Black Saturday bushfires in Victoria, Australia, at a charity concert at Lakeside Secondary School.[99] Bublé was previously engaged to actress Debbie Timuss, who appeared with him in the musicals Red Rock Diner in 1996[100] and Dean Regan's Forever Swing in 1998.[101][102] Timuss was listed as one of the dedicatees in Bublé's self-titled album Michael Bublé and It's Time and sang background vocals for it. While in Italy, he co-wrote the hit single \"Home\" for her.[103][104] She was featured in the music video for \"Home\".[104][105] Their engagement ended in November 2005 and inspired him to write \"Lost\".[106] During an appearance at Australian television's Logie Awards in 2005, Bublé met English actress Emily Blunt and they soon began dating.[15][107] She sang background vocals on \"Me and Mrs. Jones\", and \"Everything\" was written by Bublé for her.[105][108] After his relationship with Blunt ended in July 2008,[109] Bublé began dating Argentine actress Luisana Lopilato; they became engaged in November 2009[110][111] and married in March 2011 in Buenos Aires.[112] Bublé co-wrote the hit single \"Haven't Met You Yet\" for Lopilato while they were dating[113] and she appeared in his music video.[110] The couple have four children: sons born in 2013 and 2016[114][115] and daughters born in 2018 and 2022.[116][117] Bublé's oldest son was diagnosed with hepatoblastoma in 2016.[118] The singer canceled his planned tour after receiving news of the diagnosis, spending time with his son during chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Bublé discussed this with British talk show host James Corden in 2018.[119] Bublé's son has since fully recovered.[120]",

                "title": "December 16 news on Madison, Wisconsin school shooting | CNN",
                "content": "• The shooter who opened fire at the Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Wisconsin, was 15-year-old female student Natalie Rupnow, who went by the name “Samantha,” police said on Monday. She shot herself and died. • The shooting left one student and one teacher dead and six injured, including two people who are facing life-threatening conditions, police said. • A second-grade student made the 911 call to report the shooting, police said Monday. • Abundant Life Christian school is a K-12 school that serves about 420 students, according to an administrator. It planned to close for Christmas vacation after this week. Our live coverage of the shooting at the Abundant Life Christian School has moved here. The US school year is heading into its Christmas holiday break similar to how it began – with a mass shooting. The shooting at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Wisconsin, on Monday was the 83rd school shooting recorded in 2024, surpassing 2023 for the most school shootings in a single year since CNN began tracking such incidents in 2008. And the start of the academic year in early fall had been scattered with numerous shootings — including an apparent murder-suicide on the first day of classes at Rice University in Houston on August 26. The following week, a 14-year-old shooter killed four victims at a high school in Winder, Georgia — making it the deadliest school shooting of the year. Wisconsin shaken: The state has experienced a number of other scares in recent months. In May, police shot and killed a student who brought a gun near a middle school in the village of Mount Horeb, about 23 miles southwest of Madison. The student was a minor and did not manage to enter the school. Nobody else was injured. Then in November, a 13-year-old boy was arrested on suspicion of planning a shooting in Kenosha, by Lake Michigan, after he tried to enter a secure area of an elementary school while carrying two bags. The boy had been searching online about school shootings, and had made several comments to other students about school shootings for months beforehand, police said. The city of Madison, Wisconsin, was left reeling after a school shooting on Monday killed one student and one teacher and injured several others, including two in critical condition. The shooter, identified by police as 15-year-old female student Natalie Rupnow, died of a self-inflicted gunshot after the attack at Abundant Life Christian School. Here’s what to look for on Tuesday: Authorities on Monday investigated a residential property north of Madison, Wisconsin, just eight miles from the Abundant Life Christian School where two people were killed in a shooting Monday, according to CNN affiliate WTMJ. Videos show a home decorated with Christmas lights and cordoned off with police tape. The main door had been removed, and the windows damaged. Neighbors saw police throw stun grenades, which detonate with a bright flash and loud bang, into the home earlier in the afternoon, WTMJ reported. Neighbors told WTMJ that officers had arrived in the early afternoon, just after the shooting took place, and were going in and out until night fell. “I heard the news this afternoon and thought, well, we’ll just drive by the main drag, and there it was,” one neighbor told WTMJ. “The front door was taken off and nobody was around, and the detectives are in there mopping up the mess.” Earlier on Monday, Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes said the suspect’s home had been searched and police are seeking additional search warrants. The 15-year-old suspect’s family has so far been cooperating with law enforcement, and police are not looking to charge the parents in connection to the shooting “at this time,” Barnes said. He confirmed that the heavy police presence at a home in northern Madison was related to the shooting investigation but provided no further details. Second grader Nora Gottsckalk, age 8, was in the school hallway getting ready for lunch when the shooting began, she told CNN affiliate WISC on Monday. She saw a teacher she knew well who had been injured. “She was screaming, ‘Ah, my leg, help, help!’” Nora said, clutching a SpongeBob candy in her hand as she spoke to reporters. “I was really scared, and I was really sad.” Abundant Life Christian School is a small school – about 420 students from kindergarten to high school – with parents and school administrators describing it as a tight-knit community. Bethany Highman grew up in Madison, herself attending Abundant Life as a child — and now has a daughter attending the school. Her daughter was unharmed during the shooting on Monday, she told CNN affiliate WMTV in the afternoon, but she was still waiting to be reunited and wasn’t sure of her whereabouts. “I pray with my kids every morning that this won’t happen, and it’s the world that we live in,” Highman said. “God is good, God is gracious, and my kids are safe, my family is safe.” Sixth-grade student Adler Jean-Charles was attending English class Monday morning at Abundant Life Christian School when the lockdown occurred. “I heard two (gunshots),” he told CNN affiliate WISC-TV. “Some people started crying, and then we just waited until the police came and they escorted us out.” “I was scared. Why did they do that?” he said. The students were then taken to the hospital to be reunited with their parents, where Jean-Charles received a teddy bear. When he saw his mom, “I felt safe,” he said. His mother, Mireille Jean-Charles, said she had two other sons also attending the school. When they were reunited, they cried and prayed together, she said. When asked if she was OK, she shook her head and broke into tears. “It’s sad, you know, to be home and then somebody calls you and says your kids’ school is in lockdown and a shooting, and you don’t know where they are,” she told WISC. “Thank God, they were safe. But the trauma — it’s a lot, because I’m sure they lost friends and teachers, which is not OK. And I don’t think they’ll be OK for a long time.” Authorities identified Natalie Rupnow, 15, who went by the name “Samantha,” as the suspected shooter at Abundant Life Christian School on Monday morning in Madison, Wisconsin, according to Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes. Evidence suggests the suspect died by a self-inflicted gunshot wound, Barnes said at a Monday night news conference, adding that the suspect was pronounced dead on the way to the hospital. Barnes asked the community not to hold a vigil at the school as it is still an active crime scene, which is being monitored by police overnight and no one is allowed inside or on the school property. Barnes provided additional updates during a Monday night news conference: Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes updated the timeline of the emergency response to the mass shooting Monday morning at Abundant Life Christian School. Here are some of the details he gave at a news conference: Two of the six people who were injured in Monday’s shooting are in critical condition and have life-threatening injuries, Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes said at a news conference tonight. Those two people are students, he said. “A teacher and three students were treated for non-life threatening injuries, and two of those have been released,” Barnes added. Police are not looking to charge the parents of the 15-year-old suspect in connection with Monday’s shooting, Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes said. “The parents are fully cooperating, we have no reason to believe that they have committed a crime at this time,” Barnes said. The context: In recent years, law enforcement has charged the parents of children who did a shooting at their school. James and Jennifer Crumbley, whose son Ethan carried out a school shooting at his Michigan high school in November 2021, were sentenced to 10 to 15 years in prison after being convicted of manslaughter. The father of 14-year-old Colt Gray, who carried out a mass shooting at Apalachee High School in Georgia, was charged with 29 counts earlier this year. This post was updated with context on law enforcement charging parents in mass shooting incidents. Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes said he wants to make sure all family members have been notified before he releases the ages and names of the victims of Monday’s shooting at Abundant Life Christian School. “I think we want to make sure that all family members have been notified,” Barnes said. Barnes also said he wants to make sure all family members are OK with the victims’ names being shared. He suggested the names could be released at Tuesday’s briefing at 1 p.m. local time. Police are not aware of any previous interactions with the 15-year-old suspect, Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes said. “I think if there were, we certainly would of had some type of intervention, but I’m not aware of that,” Barnes said. People need to be more responsible on social media with posts about the shooter, Police Chief Shon Barnes said when asked at a news conference whether Natalie Rupnow was transgender. “I don’t know whether Natalie was transgender or not. And quite frankly, I don’t think that’s important at all,” he said. “I don’t think whatever happened today has anything to do with how she or he or they may want to identify.” He said people who are on the Internet need to leave out their personal biases and he won’t address information he has seen posted on social media that is incorrect or “just not helping.” “For what we’re doing right now, today, literally eight hours after a mass shooting in a school in Madison, it is of no consequence at this time (what gender the shooter was),” he said. The suspect’s father is speaking with police at one of their facilities, Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes said. Police are “trying to determine what he may knew [sic] or may have not known about what happened today, but again, he lost someone as well,” Barnes said. Authorities have been unable to identify the authenticity of a manifesto, Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes said. “We haven’t been able to verify that it’s authentic. We’re certainly aware that it’s been posted and the person who posted it, alleged to have a connection with the victim,” Barnes said. Barnes said they have not located the person who posted it, but have shared information with the FBI for help. A second grader at Abundant Life Christian School called 911 to report the shooting Monday, Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes told reporters. “Let that soak in for a minute,” he said at the news conference. “A second grade student called 911 at 10:57 a.m to report a shooting at school.” Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes asked the community not to hold a vigil at Abundant Life Christian School as it is still an active crime scene. The school is being monitored by police overnight and no one is allowed inside or on the school property, he said. Monday’s shooting at Abundant Life Christian School took place in a classroom, Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes said. “The shooting happened inside a classroom in a study hall of students from mixed grades,” Barnes said. Authorities identified Natalie Rupnow, 15, who went by the name “Samantha,” as the shooter at Abundant Life Christian School on Monday morning in Madison, Wisconsin, according to the city’s police chief. Evidence suggests the shooter died by a self-inflicted gunshot wound, Chief Shon Barnes said at a Monday night news conference and was pronounced dead on the way to the hospital. This post has been updated with the suspect’s name. In their most recent update, police said two students, who were taken to local hospitals along with four other people after the shooting Monday at a private Christian school in Madison, Wisconsin, are battling life-threatening injuries and are in critical condition. Police had earlier reported that a student and a teacher were killed and others were injured in the shooting that erupted just before 11 a.m. at the Abundant Life Christian School. The suspected shooter is also dead, according to Police Chief Shon Barnes. The attack is at least the 83rd school shooting of 2024, surpassing 2023 for the most school shootings in a single year since CNN began tracking such shootings in 2008. Here’s the latest we have learned: This post has been updated with additional information from police. The shooter at the Abundant Life Christian School planned the attack in advance, a law enforcement official familiar with the investigation tells CNN. The source indicated that information gathered by investigators suggests the shooter had been dealing with problems and expressed some of those in writings, which they are now reviewing. The parents of the shooter are cooperating with authorities and are being interviewed by Madison police detectives, Police Chief Shon Barnes told reporters in a news briefing Monday. President Joe Biden spoke with Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers and Madison Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway following the shooting at the Abundant Life Christian School, the White House said Monday. The president offered his continued support to help the impacted community, the White House said. Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes urged the public to not repost or share information about the shooting at Abundant Life Christian School that did not come from a trusted official or journalist. “If you’re listening to this, or you’re at home and you’re thinking about reposting or sending something that did not come from someone in this room – a trusted and respected journalist – or did not come from us, please don’t do that,” Barnes said.“It does help erode the trust in this process – and that’s all we have.” Barnes added that sharing information that doesn’t come from a trusted individual could spread “misinformation and fear” at a time when the community needs to come together. Abundant Life Christian School had a training with the Madison Police Department earlier this year about what to do in an active shooter situation, according to an administrator at the school. Barbara Wiers, the director of elementary and school relations at the school where at least two people were killed in a shooting on Monday, said the training happened just before the start of the school year. “So I think everything was very fresh for our faculty,” she said. Wiers said the training with MPD was to go through updates to the procedure. Additionally, she said the school always keeps the doors locked, which “is one of the things that makes it quick and easy to secure a room” in the event of a shooting. Teachers are responsible for shutting the door and getting students to a safe part of the room, she said. The students at Abundant Life Christian School handled themselves “magnificently” during the shooting once they realized it wasn’t a drill, said Barbara Wiers, director of elementary and school relations for the school. “The students handled themselves magnificently. I cannot tell you how well our students did in that process,” Wiers said. “They were clearly scared,” Wiers said. “When they heard ‘lockdown, lockdown’ and nothing else – they knew it was real, but they handled themselves brilliantly.” Whether the teenaged shooter looked for specific people at Abundant Life Christian School is still under investigation, Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes said. “Whether they were targeted or not would speak to motivation and we don’t know that answer just yet,” Barnes said at an evening news conference. Two people were killed and six people were injured in the school, according to officials. Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes said the shooting at the Abundant Life Christian School shooting on Monday happened “in a learning part of the school.” “I did not, again, go into the school so I don’t know the exact nomenclature of where it happened but it happened in a learning part of the school,” Barnes said. The suspected shooter in a deadly shooting on Monday in Madison, Wisconsin, was at school at the beginning of the day, Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes said. “We believe that the shooter was at school. We have no information that there was some type of breach to the school,” Barnes said. What else we know: Barnes confirmed earlier today that the suspected shooter was a student at the school. Police have declined to provide any other identifying details about the suspected shooter, but one law enforcement source told CNN the person was a female. The person was dead when police arrived. Parents of the students at the Abundant Life Christian School responded with support, patience and kindness and offered prayers, according to Barbara Wiers, director of elementary and school relations. The families “were supportive, they were amazingly patient and kind. They were offering repeatedly, ‘we’re praying for you, we’re praying for our family,’” she said at a news conference Monday evening. “We also have a very strong faith in our community that in spite of tragedy, God is working. And we believe that God is good in everything and that he turns beauty for ashes. And so I had a number of families who mentioned that to me, that this wasn’t a surprise to God, and that he’s going to do something mighty with it,” she continued. “We’re holding on to those words, and we’re continuing to believe and trust in him. He is our foundation at Abundant Life Christian school,” she added. “We have complete faith that he will carry us through this.” The US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) is working with the Madison Police Department to help find out how the shooter at Abundant Life Christian School acquired a handgun. Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes said detectives do not know where the gun came from. “That’s part of the investigative process,” he said at a evening news conference. Barnes said the ATF, which has a trace program, and the FBI are “amazing” partners. Barnes has said they believe the shooter was a teenaged student. Abundant Life Christian School does not have metal detectors, but they do have “a number of security protocols in place,” Barbara Wiers, the director of elementary and school relations at the school, said. Abundant Life Christian School is a small private school. Wiers, while not sharing any specifics of what those protocols are, said there are cameras in the hallways that are monitored regularly in the office. “We also have other safety measures throughout the building. But as to a metal detector, no, we do not have,” Wiers said. “We do abide by the policy of visual scans every morning as students come into the building, so every student is visually scanned before they go into … up to their locker spaces or into their classrooms.” Wiers said the school is two levels and the doors are locked throughout the day, adding anyone trying to come into the building during school hours has to be let in. She also confirmed the school does not have a school resource officer. About 420 students are enrolled at the K-12 school, Wiers said. This post has been updated with additional information from Wiers. Heavy police presence seen at a home in Madison’s north side is related to Monday’s shooting at Abundant Life Christian School, Police Chief Shon Barnes confirmed. “Everyone is cooperating,” he said. Barnes continued that he hoped to provide more information later today on what authorities may have learned. Two of the victims who were injured with non- life threating injuries during the Abundant Life Christian School shooting on Monday have been released, according to Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes. “A teacher and three other students were taken to area hospitals with non-life-threatening injuries,” Barnes said. “Two of those victims, two of those survivors, have been released from the hospital.” Barbara Wiers, the director of elementary and school relations at Abundant Life Christian School where at least two people were killed in a shooting on Monday, said the incident has “rocked” the school community. She thanked those who helped families and students as they were reunited earlier today. She also thanked local and state officials for their support. “This has obviously rocked our school community, but we know it affects not just our school community, but Madison and the greater area and all schools,” Wiers said. “And so our hope is that there will be some good that comes out of this as we can learn and grow and continue to support schools.” Authorities are still working to determine the motive of a teenage shooter who killed two people at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Wisconsin, on Monday morning, the city’s police chief told reporters. “We know that there is information that may be circulating about the shooter, but I cannot at this time formally tell you the age or gender or name of the shooter,” Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes said at a third news conference of the day. “We do not want to compromise any part of the investigation.” He said he may be able to disclose the “answer to some of those questions” at a news conference set for 8:30 p.m. CT (9:30 p.m. ET). Two students who were taken to local hospitals are in critical conditions with life-threatening injuries, Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes said in a press briefing on Monday evening. “Of the injured and taken to local hospitals, two students remain in critical condition. Their injuries are life threatening,” Barnes said. At least six people were injured in the shooting, including the two students. Students at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Wisconsin, have been reunited with their families, Police Chief Shon Barnes said. At the third news conference after the deadly shooting at the school, Barnes said officials are still working to make sure some teachers and staff get back to their families. These were people who worked at the school “who selflessly stayed back to make sure our kids were OK.” “We do understand that this process of reunification may have taken a while and parents really wanted to see their children, give their children a hug. Certainly I would, as a father, but we are fortunate that process is complete,” Barnes said. It is believed the shooter died of a self-inflicted gunshot, a law enforcement source told CNN. Earlier in a briefing, Madison police said the final determination for the cause of death would be made by the medical examiner. Police on Monday identified the shooter as a 15-year-old female. This post has been updated with additional information from police. At least two people are dead and multiple others were injured after a shooting at a school in Madison, Wisconsin, on Monday, police said. The suspected shooter is also dead, according to Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes. It marks at least the 83rd school shooting of 2024, surpassing 2023 for the most school shootings in a single year since CNN began tracking such shootings in 2008. Here’s what we know so far: A candlelight vigil will be held at the Wisconsin State Capitol in Madison on Tuesday at 6 p.m. local time (7 p.m. ET), according to a post on the Facebook page of the president of the Dane County Boys & Girls Club. “We are actively planning ways to provide support, including safe spaces for youth to process their feelings, sharing mental health resources, and collaborating with community partners to address community needs,” Michael Johnson says in the post. Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway will attend the vigil, which will take place in front of the statue of civil rights icon Vel Phillips, Johnson says. “As an organization dedicated to serving youth and families, we feel it is our responsibility to step forward and create spaces for connection and healing,” Johnson says in a second post. “This vigil is one way we can stand with our community and show that we are here to support them during this unimaginable time.” The White House expressed “deep condolences” to the victims and families affected by a Madison, Wisconsin, school shooting Monday, pledging federal support for the investigation as it unfolds. “Just horrific news, and news that no family, no parent, no sibling, no son or daughter ever wants to hear, so, just terrible,” White House national security spokesperson John Kirby told reporters. “And we will continue to stay focused on the community there in Madison, and we’ll obviously offer whatever help may be required or needed of local and state authorities.” A teacher and a student are dead after a shooting at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, according to Police Chief Shon Barnes. Six people were injured, including two who have life-threatening injuries, Barnes said. Kirby reiterated that President Joe Biden was briefed on the shooting and that officials “are, as you would expect we would be, in touch with our local counterparts there in Madison to provide whatever support that they need.” The Wisconsin Department of Justice Office of School Safety (OSS) and Office of Crime Victim Services (OCVS) are providing resources after Monday’s school shooting at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Wisconsin. “I’m heartbroken for the students, teachers, staff members, and families impacted by the devastating mass shooting this morning at Abundant Life Christian School. No one should ever have to experience something like this,” said Attorney General Josh Kaul. “Our Office of School Safety is offering support and will aid the community in recovery. My thoughts and condolences are with every family affected by this tragedy.” Here are the resources laid out by OSS as part of the Critical Incident Response Team (CIRT): The head coach of the Milwaukee Bucks opened his scheduled news conference Monday by acknowledging the shooting at the Abundant Life Christian School in Madison. “Before we start, I’m sure everybody knows about the shooting in Madison, Wisconsin,” Doc Rivers said.“You know, kids can’t go to school safe and it just seems like we don’t do anything about it. I’m not gonna get up here on the podium and give a long speech except for it’s just bad and that we’re thinking about them,” Rivers said. Rivers and the Bucks are in Las Vegas to take on the Oklahoma City Thunder on Tuesday for the NBA Cup title game. The shooter at the Abundant Life Christian School in Madison was female, a law enforcement official briefed on the shooting tells CNN. The suspect, who was a teenage student at the school, is also dead. Madison Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway urged those who may be dealing with mental health concerns in the aftermath of Monday’s shooting at Abundant Life Christian School to contact 988 via text or phone, for help. “If anyone needs mental health support as a result of this incident and the coverage of it, I encourage them to reach out to 988 by phone or text and to get the mental health support that they need,” Rhodes-Conway said.“It is incredibly important that we take care of our community in this very difficult time,” Rhodes-Conway said. Madison, Wisconsin, Police Chief Shon Barnes said Monday that it is not known if the shooter had any prior contact with law enforcement. “We do not know that the shooter had any prior contact with law enforcement. But I did do a check of the school. There were some calls, but they were like 911 hang-ups, things of that nature. There was nothing that suggested that the school was a place that violence would occur,” Barnes said at a news conference. The family of the student suspected of opening fire at a Madison, Wisconsin, school on Monday is cooperating with police, police chief Shon Barnes said. Earlier in the news conference, Barnes said the suspected shooter was a student at Abundant Life Christian School, but declined to give any other identifying details. The alleged shooter was found dead at the school, police said previously. A reporter asked Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes how residents of the community can feel better in sending their kids back to school following Monday’s shooting at Abundant Life Christian School. “I think you’re asking me how can I say 100% that no child will ever be harmed in school? I can’t. No police chief can,” Barnes responded at a news conference.“All I can tell you is that we have systems in place so that if something happens, we can respond like we did today,” Barnes said. “I can tell you that our mayor and our county exec has committed resources to not only public health, but also mental health.” Abundant Life Christian School, where at least two people were killed in a shooting on Monday, did not have a school resource officer, according to Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes. “If they did, it would be a police officer and I know where they all are and they’re not in the schools right now,” Barnes said at a news conference. The police chief said that the suspected shooter was a student at the school. Madison, Wisconsin, Police Chief Shon Barnes gave details on what the investigation into the shooting at the Abundant Life Christian School looks like. Here’s what to know: The shooting at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Wisconsin, was “confined to one space” in the building, police chief Shon Barnes said. He said that he does not know specifically whether it was a classroom or a hallway. There’s no evidence that anyone else was injured that was not in that age group,” Barnes said, referring to the section of the school where the shooting happened. Abundant Life Christian School is a K-12 school that has about 390 students, according to its website. Dane County Executive Melissa Agard told reporters she received a text from her son at a Madison city high school to say he was alright. “This hits you in the gut,” she said. The community and the country are better than this, she said Monday during a news conference about the deadly shooting at the Abundant Life Christian School in the city. “This cannot continue,” she said. People across the state and nation have been calling her offering help for the community, she said. Agard pledged her office’s assistance to the people experiencing “devastating loss.” Madison Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway said “this is an incredibly sad day for our community.” While Rhodes-Conway said there’s no danger to the community at this time, the “entire community has been impacted by this tragic incident.” Madison Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway said better steps need to be taken to prevent gun violence. “I am on record that I think we need to do better in our country and our community to prevent gun violence. And I hoped that this day would never come in Madison,” she said Monday at a press briefing. “It is not something that any mayor, any fire chief, any police chief, any person in public office ever wants to have to deal with.” At least seven people were taken to area hospitals after a shooting at a Madison, Wisconsin, school on Monday, according to fire chief Chris Carbon. The fire department was dispatched to the school at around 10:57 a.m. local time, he said at a news conference. They responded with five engine companies, four ladder companies and 15 ambulances. First responders took four people to St. Mary’s Hospital and three others were taken to University of Wisconsin hospitals, Carbon said. The fire chief also thanked their county partners and other fire and EMS agencies who responded. At least six people were injured during the shooting at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Police Chief Shon Barnes said Monday during a news conference. “Six other people were injured, two students are now in critical condition in the hospital, and these injuries are considered life-threatening injuries,” Barnes said. “Four students are also at other area hospitals with non-life threatening injuries,” Barnes added. Police Chief Shon Barnes said the process of returning every student to their loved ones is underway, noting that the Madison, Wisconsin, school building is clear and there is no other threat to the community. “There is no other threat or danger to the community. We’re in the process now of what we call reunification. And what that simply means is making sure that every student that was in the school is present and accounted for and returned to their loved ones,” he said at a briefing Monday. While such a process can take time, the preparedness of law enforcement has helped accelerate it. ” We have practiced, unfortunately, and practiced and practiced. And that’s why we’re able to reunify students with their parents within hours of a school shooting,” Barnes said. He thanked Dean Clinic on Stoughton Road for helping with the reunification process. Police Chief Shon Barnes said many people have asked him about “the why of this” shooting that happened Monday morning at Abundant Life Christian School. “Why did this happen? What do we know? What was the motivation?” the Madison, Wisconsin, police chief said. “I do not know.” He said detectives are working hard to find out as many answers at they can to prevent future shootings.

ATF is running a trace on the firearm, an agency spokesperson told CNN. They will try to figure out where the gun came from, according to CNN correspondent Josh Campbell “That’s going to be a key part of this investigation as well, because we’ve seen, sadly, again, in shootings, that owners of weapons have been held accountable whenever someone underage then goes on to conduct an act of violence,” Campbell said. Police said on Monday that the suspected shooter was believed to be a student at Abundant Life Christian School. The suspect was found dead inside the building, Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes said.

                "title": "Second-grade teacher called police over Wisconsin school shooting",
                "content": "Police in the US state of Wisconsin said the emergency call they received over Monday's school shooting came from a second-grade teacher, not a student as they had previously stated. A teenage pupil and a teacher were shot dead and six others injured at a Christian private school by a 15-year-old girl, named by authorities as Natalie Rupnow. The attacker, who attended the school, was also found dead with a handgun. Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes apologised for mistakenly saying the 911 call came from a child, who would have been no older than seven or eight years old, attributing the error to a misreading of police log. Mr Barnes said the motive for the deadly shooting appeared to be \"a combination of factors\". The victims have not yet been named, and nor has the child who raised the alarm. Chief Barnes said two students were facing life-threatening injuries. Four others were taken to hospital and two of them later released. The attacker, who also used the first name Samantha, is believed to have died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. No officers fired shots. She attended the school before launching Monday's attack, Chief Barnes said. The shooting was confined to a study hall with students in mixed grades. Asked about some text posted online that is purported to have been authored by Rupnow, Chief Barnes said: \"We haven't been able to verify that it's authentic. We're certainly aware that it's been posted and the person who posted it alleged to have a connection.\" Information has been shared with the FBI, he added. Rupnow's family has been co-operating with the investigation. Local media reported that a property north of Madison was raided on Monday. Authorities have also asked to hear from witnesses, and a number of those present during the assault at Abundant Life Christian School have spoken to local media. Nora Gottschalk, aged eight, told CNN affiliate WISC that she was getting ready for lunch when the shots rang out. She saw a teacher who was injured screaming for help. \"I was really scared and I was really sad,\" she said. Adler Jean-Charles, who is in sixth grade, said he heard two gunshots when he was in English class. \"Some people started crying and then we just waited until the police came,\" he told WISC. Bethany Highman, who attended the school and now has a daughter who is a pupil, told another CNN affiliate, WMTV: \"I pray with my kids every morning that this won't happen, and it's the world we live in.\" The school's director of relations said pupils' training for a mass shooting would have been \"very fresh\" after sessions were held earlier this year. President Joe Biden said the shooting was \"shocking and unconscionable\", and called on lawmakers to act immediately on legislation that could prevent more gun violence. Mass shootings are common in the US, including at schools. According to news organisation EducationWeek, 38 of them have caused deaths or injuries this year. There were a total of 69 victims - including 16 deaths - before Monday's attack. But school shootings by female attackers are rare. The school, which has around 400 students from kindergarten to high-school age, remains closed during the investigation. There is \"no sense of danger\" after a puzzling flurry of sightings on the east coast, the president says. The Republican will begin his second presidential term in January 2025. The government has pledged a joint \"strike force\" and 24/7 aerial surveillance, as well as a host of other measures. The US president-elect recently referred to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as the \"governor\" of the \"Great State of Canada\". The 26-year-old was allegedly detained with a gun, bullets, fake IDs, cash and a handwritten \"manifesto\". Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

                "title": "\n    2 killed, suspect dead in school shooting in Madison, Wisconsin, police say - CBS Chicago",
                "content": "Watch CBS News By Elyssa Kaufman, Emily Mae Czachor, Aliza Chasan, Charlie De Mar Updated on: December 17, 2024 / 6:25 PM CST / CBS Chicago MADISON, Wis. (CBS) — Two people were killed and a teenage suspect — later identified as a 15-year-old girl — was found dead in a shooting at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Wisconsin, on Monday morning. Just before 11 a.m., Madison police responded to the mass shooting at the private school located at 4901 E. Buckeye Rd. on the east side of Madison. Madison Chief of Police Shon F. Barnes said a second-grade teacher called 911 at 10:57 a.m. to report the shooting. (Police initially said the 911 call came from a second grader, but then corrected that Tuesday to say it was a teacher who called.) The shooting took place inside a classroom and study hall occupied by students in various grades, Barnes said. The shooter has been identified as 15-year-old Natalie Rupnow, a student at the school who lived in Madison and went by the name Samantha. It is believed she died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound after opening fire in the school. \"What we do know is this child was obviously very troubled,\" Barnes said in an interview with \"CBS Mornings\" on Tuesday. \"There's usually some type of warning signs that we all may have missed and so we have to understand that we have to come together as a community. We have to wrap our arms around our children and understand what's going on in their lives.\" Police said the two people who died in the shooting were a teenage student and a teacher. According to Pastor Chris Dolson, who was speaking at a vigil for the victims on Monday night, the teacher who was killed may have been a substitute. \"There's a woman who called in sick today. She's a teacher. And there was a substitute that came in to take her place that was shot and killed,\" Dolson said. \"Survivor guilt kicks in when those things happen.\" CBS News has not independently confirmed the teacher's identity. Five other students and another teacher were injured. Two of the wounded students remained in critical condition with life-threatening injuries Monday night, Barnes said. The surviving teacher and three other students were treated for non-life-threatening injuries, and two of those victims have been released, while the other two have been stabilized, Barnes said. Barnes confirmed officers found the teenage shooting suspect at the scene apparently having shot herself, and officers fired no shots. Police said the suspect used a 9 mm pistol, and police were working to trace the gun. Rupnow was pronounced dead while being taken to the hospital, Barnes said. All surviving students were reunited with their loved ones in the hours after the shooting, officials said. As police searched for a motive late Monday, the FBI was working with local law enforcement to process the scene, conduct interviews, and obtain search warrants. \"We'll spend a lot of time going through some items that we took from her house as a result of a search,\" Barnes said. \"We'll look through her social media, talk to some of her friends, and really try to piece together how a 15-year-old was able to do something like this in such a short amount of time.\" CBS News Chicago is told the suspected shooter's family is cooperating with police. \"Right now, my heart is heavy for my community,\" Barnes said earlier Monday. \"My heart is heavy for Madison, and we have to come together as a community and figure out what happened here and make sure that it doesn't happen at any other place that should be a refuge for students in our community.\" Barnes is a former public school teacher and taught history for four years before switching career paths to law enforcement. \"This affects me tremendously,\" he said. \"I've always had a big heart for school and education. As someone who values the sanctity of school and understanding and being in that position to know how dedicated teachers really are, to understand that our kids need to be safe in order to learn.\" Mireille Jean-Charles is the mother of three boys who attend Abundant Life Christian School. She spoke with Meryl Hubbard, a reporter for CBS affiliate WISC-TV in Madison. \"It's sad, you know, to be home and then somebody calls you and says your kids' school in lockdown—and you don't know where they are. And I was there since 11. I finally got them, and thank God they were safe,\" Jean-Charles said. \"But the trauma—it's a lot, because I'm sure they lost friends and a teacher, which is not OK. And I don't think they will be OK for a long time, and I'm not.\" As reported by WISC, school director of elementary and school relations Barbara Weirs said the school does not have metal detectors, but does follow safety protocols. Weirs said the school held a practice lockdown at the beginning of the current academic year, the station reported. \"We've joked around about how safe a 400-student-bodied school—Christian private school—is, right?\" a man said. \"If it can happen here, it can literally happen anywhere.\" Hours after the shooting, several officers were seen removing the door from a Madison home in a search Chief Barnes said was connected to the investigation. \"Our detectives are working hard in the investigative process to find out as many answers as we can so that we can further prevent these things from happening—not only in this community, but in other communities around our country,\" Barnes said. Dave Wagner is the former principal of the school. \"My heart grieves beyond words with them,\" Wagner said. \"I know the principal. I know several of the teachers. They're going to be impacted for their life by the tragedy of this day. Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers released the following statement: \"There are no words to describe the devastation and heartbreak we feel today after the school shooting at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison this morning. \"Kathy and I join the people of Wisconsin in praying for the families and loved ones of those whose lives were so senselessly taken and for the educators, staff, and the entire Abundant Life school community as they grapple with the grief, trauma, and loss of this gut-wrenching tragedy. We are also praying and hoping all those injured survive and recover. \"Kathy and I are also keeping in our hearts the first responders who acted quickly and ran toward danger to help save lives. This day will no doubt weigh heavily on them, and we are grateful for their critical response efforts in answering the call when they were needed most. \"As a father, a grandfather, and as governor, it is unthinkable that a kid or an educator might wake up and go to school one morning and never come home. This should never happen, and I will never accept this as a foregone reality or stop working to change it. \"Today my focus is on supporting these families and kids and the Abundant Life community, and the state stands ready to support them and the efforts of local law enforcement through what will undoubtedly be difficult days ahead.\" Gov. Evers has ordered the flags of the United States and the state of Wisconsin to half-staff across the state immediately until sunset on Sun., Dec. 22. Abundant Life Christian School is a private, nondenominational religious school that serves just under 400 students from kindergarten through 12th grade. Students as young as kindergarten age experienced the shooting. Second grader Nora Gottschalk, 8, heard the gunfire personally. Nora's father encouraged CBS News Chicago to talk to her—thinking it could help her heal. \"She was calling all of us in. She did this—'Everyone, come in!'\" Nora said, \"because that was the first time that's ever happened, and it's her first year as a teacher.\" Nora said she knew she was hearing gunshots. She said she was putting on her shoes when the gunfire rang out—and caused a flood in her classroom. \"I think that one of the bullets hit one of the pipes when we were all in the classroom. It hit like right above our door, and the flood went like, 'Boop! Ssss!'\" she said. Nora said she was scared. Her dad, Karl, rushed to the school. \"I panicked. I mean, it could be mine. Seeing all the ambulances made me think, why is there 12 ambulances?\" Karl Gottschalk said. Meanwhile back at the school Tuesday, a group of school bus drivers brought flowers, candles, and prayers. \"My son was part of the Waukesha school shooting. He was a victim of that shooting. He had a gun pointed at his face that particular day,\" said school bus driver Megan Mojica. \"So when I'm seeing everything go on here, it brought me back to that day.\" It was a surreal scene the day after the shooting at the Abundant Life Christian School, where yellow tape still surrounded the playground—and a sign was still up reading, \"Happy Thanksgiving.\" \"The amount of stress is unknowable until you're there, and then it's just an overwhelming flood of certainty and fair—but it gets outweighed really quickly, you know, as we have faith,\" said Abundant Life parent James Smith. James and Rebekah Smith said their daughter was already well familiar with active shooter drills. \"They have drills every month,\" said Rebekah Smith. \"Our daughter was sick of practicing for active shooter.\" The Smiths said their daughter, a high school junior, did not know the shooter well—only having seen her passing in the hall. \"She's new and she didn't talk to anyone,\" Rebekah Smith said of Natalie Rupnow. \"They were all talking about it, like her friends never had one conversation. They weren't in the same class either.\" The Rev. Kellen Lewis also has four kids who attend the school. \"Hugging them a little bit extra tight, giving them a kiss, letting them know I love them. You know, it's tough,\" Lewis said. \"It makes you appreciate your kids, but man, my heart goes out to those that—they don't have their kids to hug anymore.\" It is extremely rare for women to carry out mass shootings. Data from the think tank Rockefeller Institute of Government lists 441 mass shootings in the United States between 1966 and 2022 — more than 95% of the perpetrators of those shootings were men, and just 4.3% were women. The organization defines a mass shooting as \"an incident of targeted violence carried out by one or more shooters at one or more public or populated locations,\" which results in multiple victims injured or killed and where both the victims and locations are chosen randomly or for \"symbolic value.\" Their definition excludes shootings related to gang violence or militant activity. Although exact figures vary somewhat between research groups, depending on how \"mass shooting\" is defined, other organizations report similarly low rates of these incidents being carried out by female shooters. The nonprofit Violence Prevention Group tracked 195 mass shootings between 1966 and 2022, categorizing a mass shooting as one where four or more people are shot and killed, excluding the shooter. That group's research showed 192 of the shooters were men, and just 4 were women. It also accounted for the perpetrator in a Nashville school shooting in 2023, who was transgender. The number of women who carry out mass shootings in schools — one of the most common places for this sort of crime — is similarly low compared with men. Of 544 shooting incidents at K-12 schools between 2013 and 2024, the advocacy organization Everytown for Gun Safety found less than 5% of the perpetrators were female, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported.

                "title": "Falcons vs. Raiders results, score: Atlanta stays in playoff picture",
                "content": "Editor's note: USA TODAY Sports also provided live updates from the Vikings vs. Bears MNF game. It was by no means pretty, but when you’re on a skid like the Atlanta Falcons, you’ll take anything you can get. The offense didn’t do much, and it nearly gave this one away, but Atlanta snapped a four-game losing streak with a 15-9 win over the lowly Las Vegas Raiders on \"Monday Night Football.\" For more than a month, quarterback Kirk Cousins has been under scrutiny with eight interceptions and no touchdowns in Atlanta's last four games. He finally threw for a touchdown, but he didn’t do much to stop the criticism. He tallied only 112 yards on 11-for-16 passing and threw another interception – the fifth-straight game he has turned it over. But as much the Falcons offense struggled, Las Vegas didn’t do itself any favors. It was stuck in the mud for much of the game, and whether it was a turnover or blocked punt, the Raiders gave the Falcons good field position throughout the night, which helped Atlanta get ahead. NFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more. The Raiders did make it interesting late with a chance to take the lead, but the offense was unable to connect on two Hail Mary attempts with 10 seconds remaining and 35 yards away from the endzone. Now back in the win column, the Falcons stay in the hunt for the NFC South title, just one game behind the Tampa Bay Buccaneers with three weeks left in the season. On the other side, it’s now 10 straight losses for the Raiders, and they remain in the hunt for the No. 1 pick in the 2025 NFL draft. NFL NEWSLETTER: Sign up now to get football news delivered to your inbox The comeback falls just short as Desmond Ridder's pass with no time left couldn't find a receiver in the endzone as time expired. Atlanta's Jessie Bates III intercepted the ball to seal the win after Ridder's previous attempt at a Hail Mary was knocked down in the endzone. Just when it looked like Las Vegas would get the ball back, a flag may have sealed this one. On third down, Kirk Cousins' pass got deflected, but the officials ruled the Raiders' Robert Spillane hit the quarterback unnecessarily and called roughing the passer to extend the drive in the final minutes. The ESPN announcers debated whether the call was correct. The Raiders eventually forced a punt and will get a chance to win it in the final minute. Don't count out Las Vegas just yet. The Raiders offense has struggled nearly all game, but they put together their best drive of the night with a nine play, 68-yard drive to get their first touchdown of the night. Desmond Ridder dished it out to Ameer Abdullah for a five-yard score with just less than three minutes left. The extra point was blocked, so it will be a six point game. Younghoe Koo had a perfect night so far, but he missed a 42-yard field goal that would've extended the lead to 15 points. Las Vegas will now get the ball with a small chance to still make a comeback. It's just been that kind of night for the Raiders. Desmond Ridder hasn't been able to do much against his former team, and he threw an interception with less than eight minutes left to give Atlanta another chance to score. The lead has been extended off another Younghoe Koo kick. Atlanta had good field position once again, but the offense moved just 18 yards before falling short on a third-down play. Koo kicked a 48-yarder for his second make of the night. There wasn't much to compliment offensively in the third quarter with a Falcons field goal the lone score in the frame. Both sides have struggled to move the ball, and the teams combined to total just 65 yards in the third quarter. Sincere McCormick got the start for Las Vegas, but he is out for the remainder of the game due to an ankle injury. Atlanta took advantage of the field position from the blocked punt with a field goal from Younghoe Koo. While the Falcons would've preferred getting in the endzone, they settled on a 40-yard field goal to extend the lead. Make it two blocked punts on the night for Atlanta after the special teams blocked another kick off Raiders punter AJ Cole. The Falcons tried to pick it up and run it back, but Las Vegas' Divine Deablo picked it up and ran for some yards to put Atlanta further away from the endzone. Kirk Cousins played clean football the entire first half, and it only took one snap for that to change in the second half. After a solid kick return gave Atlanta good field position, Cousins tried to throw into a tight window to tight end Charlie Woerner, but the Raiders' Robert Spillane jumped in front of the pass and hauled it in. Kirk Cousins finally throwing a touchdown pass and the Falcons defense forcing safety is what has Atlanta heading into the locker room with a six-point lead. While a one-score game, the Falcons have been in control for much of the first half, and could be up by much more. However, three drives stalled at midfield or in Raiders territory, making the game closer than Atlanta would like to be. Cousins is 7-for-9 with 84 yards and a touchdown, and the Raiders' Desmond Ridder − facing his old team − is 7-for-11 with 59 yards and 22 more on the ground. It's been the weapons for Atlanta making the difference, with Bijan Robinson at 58 rushing yards on 10 carries and Drake London with 48 receiving yards on two catches, one of which was a touchdown. Add two points to the scoreboard for Atlanta with the defense forcing a safety. Atlanta punter Bradley Pinion downed the Raiders at their own three-yard line, and Las Vegas lost two yards on the first play of its drive. On the next play, the Falcons defensive line rushed right up to running back Alexander Mattison before he could reach the goal line. There was no doubt about whether he got out of the endzone on this one, and the Falcons will get the ball with a six point lead. One half of Las Vegas' rushing attack left the field in Sincere McCormick. The running back suffered a reported ankle injury and was seen heading to the locker room and is questionable to return. McCormick, who got the start, had seven carries for eight yard so far on the night. It's no secret Younghoe Koo has struggled kicking for Atlanta this season, but his team surely didn't help his confidence in the second quarter. Kirk Cousins was unable to connect with Darnell Mooney on a third down play at the Las Vegas 38-yard line, and Raheem Morris sent out the field goal unit. It would have been a 55-yard attempt, but it never happened. Instead, the Falcons just stood there trying to draw the Raiders offside. It didn't work, Atlanta took a delay of game and then punted the ball. Las Vegas responded to Atlanta's score with one of its own thanks to the leg of Daniel Carlson. The Raiders put together a promising drive, with some key plays coming off the legs and arm of Desmond Ridder. The drive stalled in Falcons territory, and Carlson drilled a 52-yard field goal to get the Raiders on the scoreboard. Atlanta made sure to take advantage of good field position the second time around with a touchdown for the first points of the game. After a blocked punt got the Falcons to start at their own 49-yard line, Atlanta took six plays to get in the endzone, capped off by Kirk Cousins using a pump fake to drop a dime to Drake London for a 30-yard touchdown in the final minute of the first quarter. The score was Cousins' first touchdown pass in more than a month, with his last coming in the Week 9 win against the Cowboys. Atlanta was given a great opportunity to put points on the board on its opening drive but it was unable to capitalize. Starting at the Las Vegas 48-yard line, the Falcons moved up 20 yards when they faced a third down. Kirk Cousins dropped back and the Raiders pass rush got to him in no time, sacking him for 10 yards. Facing what would be a tough field goal for the struggling Younghoe Koo, Atlanta opted to punt the ball away. What looked like a promising start for Las Vegas turned disastrous with a fumble in its own territory. The Raiders picked up a few first downs to start the game, but their momentum was killed when a trick play didn’t work and resulted in a loss of 10 yards. Two plays later on third and long, Alexander Mattison took a run for a few yards before he fumbled it. There was a pile on the field and it was Atlanta’s Kevin King that came up with it to give the Falcons solid field position. The Raiders and Falcons are set to kick off at 8:30 p.m. ET in in the second game of the Week 15 \"Monday Night Football\" doubleheader. The Raiders-Falcons tilt will air on ESPN.

                "title": "Falcons-Raiders game breakdown: What happened in Week 15",
                "content": "Falcons Digital Team Reporter LAS VEGAS — Two phases of the Atlanta Falcons' game plan executed their jobs well enough to secure a Week 15 victory Monday against the Las Vegas Raiders at Allegiant Stadium. Final score: 15-9 Why it's important: The Falcons snap a four-game losing streak and improve to 7-7 overall. Because the Tampa Bay Buccaneers also won their Week 15 game, the Falcons remain one game back from the NFC South lead. That's better than two games, though. All the Falcons have to do to clinch the division is match the Buccaneers' final record. Atlanta holds the tiebreaker since it swept Tampa Bay this season. Key takeaway: The Falcons' defense and special teams came to play and complemented each other very well. No drive showed this better than the one that ended in a safety during the second quarter. Standout performance: Bradley Pinion. The Falcons punter truly had himself a game. He punted five times, and all but one punt was pinned within the 10-yard line. Pinion's first punt in the first quarter and last punt in the fourth quarter went into the end zone, resulting in touchbacks, but the rest put the Raiders' offense at the 3-yard line (twice), 8-yard line and 9-yard line. With Atlanta playing relatively conservatively, Pinion's punts were very impactful. Number to know: Two. The number of Raiders punts that Falcons wide receiver KhaDarel Hodge got his hands on. The first one in the first quarter technically didn't count as a blocked punt because the ball didn't go behind the line of scrimmage. The second in the third quarter was an official blocked punt. The Falcons' offense took over possession at the Raiders' 37-yard line as a result and got a 40-yard field goal out of it. Player milestones: Injury updates: A quick tweet: The Falcons editorial staff of Tori McElhaney, Will McFadden, Terrin Waack and Amna Subhan share their gut reactions to Monday's outcome in 280 characters or less. Settling the storylines: Looking forward: The Falcons return home to Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Week 16 to host the New York Giants (2-12) on Sunday at 1 p.m. ET.

Atlanta defeated the Las Vegas Raiders on Monday Night Football, but did the offensive performance overshadow the win itself? The second-year running back hit the mark in the first quarter of the Falcons Monday night game against the Raiders. Kickoff is scheduled for 8:30 p.m. ET at Allegiant Stadium. Atlanta also activated rookie Ruke Orhorhoro from injured reserve ahead of Monday night's matchup in Las Vegas. Quarterbacks have avoided testing Terrell for much of the year, which is the ultimate sign of respect for an NFL cornerback. © Atlanta Falcons Football Club - 2023",

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. The Atlanta Falcons snapped their four-game losing streak, but that was all Atlanta could say in a 15-9 victory over the Las Vegas Raiders Monday night. The Falcons scored just 15 points and survived a late charge against a Raiders team led by Desmond Ridder for the victory. Atlanta stayed one game behind the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for first place in the NFC South, but there was little for the Falcons to be encouraged by. The Falcons had 11 possessions and scored just one touchdown, a 30-yard pass from Kirk Cousins to Drake London on the game's second possession to take a 7-0 lead. The Falcons never trailed, but they just couldn't pull away. That almost came back to bite them, as Ridder threw a touchdown pass to Ameer Abdullah with 2:54 left to make the score 15-9. Ridder struggled throughout the night, but had a chance to win the game with 1:50 left. Las Vegas had two Hail Mary attempts in the final seconds, as Jessie Bates picked off Ridder on the final play to seal the victory. Ridder finished 23 of 39 for 208 yards with a touchdown and two interceptions despite struggling for 3.5 quarters. Cousins struggled throughout the night, finishing 11 of 17 for 12 yards with a touchdown and an interception. The Falcons had just 261 yards of offense and had two field goals from Younghoe Koo -- a less-than-encouraging performance despite getting the losing streak snapped. Here are some takeaways from this game. A more detailed recap can be found in the live blog below! The Falcons didn't do much offensively to \"win\" the game, but a strong start helped. Kirk Cousins threw a 30-yard touchdown pass to Drake London early, as the Falcons had their game-high possession in yards (51). The offense didn't do much, but the defense took advantage of a third-string quarterback by holding the Raiders to just 116 yards on their first 10 possessions. If the Falcons weren't facing a third-string quarterback, the outcome might have been different due to their porous offense. The Raiders rolled out a third-string quarterback with Gardner Minshew and Aidan O'Connell injured, and Desmond Ridder's start to the game went as expected. Ridder began 9 of 20 passing for 65 yards with zero touchdowns and one interception (32.3 rating) as the Raiders had three points on their first 10 possessions. Ridder rallied on the final two possessions, finishing 13 of 18 for 135 yards with a touchdown and an interception, but the rally was too late. The poor start doomed Ridder and the offense, which finished with nine points. The Raiders were making a late run at snatching the victory -- getting the Falcons off the field on third down thanks to a Kirk Cousins incomplete pass intended for Kyle Pitts. Raiders linebacker Robert Spillane batted the pass but also leaped into Cousins making the play, causing a 15-yard penalty that kept the Falcons on the field. Las Vegas would have gotten the ball with just over 2:30 left with a timeout and the two-minute warning, but the penalty allowed the Falcons to take a minute off the clock and made the Raiders burn their last timeout. The Raiders got the ball back with 1:50 left and no timeouts. Perhaps the Hail Mary attempts late could have been regular plays into the end zone with the extra minute on the clock. There weren't many plays to choose from in this affair, but Atlanta's blocked punt set the stage for the eventual victory. KhaDarel Hodge blocked A.J. Cole's punt with 12:26 left in the third quarter, this coming after Kirk Cousins threw an interception on the first play of the period. The block by Hodge gave the Falcons good field position, but they didn't fully capitalize on the excellent opportunity. Atlanta only got a field goal, but the 40-yarder by Younghoe Koo gave the Falcons the deciding score in the win. The Falcons remain alive in the NFC South and will host the Giants (2-11) on Sunday. The Raiders are tied for the worst record in football and host the Jaguars (3-11) on Sunday. Desmond Ridder had two shots at the end zone, but the final chance was picked off by Jessie Bates on the final play. The Falcons survive 15-9. Just a bad game by a team that somehow stayed alive in the playoff race. Kirk Cousins pass to RayRay McCloud goes incomplete and the Raiders get the ball with 1:50 left. Let's see if Ridder can mount a comeback. No timeouts left for the Raiders. Roughing the passer by Robert Spillane on an incomplete pass by Kirk Cousins keeps the Falcons on the field. Atlanta is gonna run more time off the clock. This is a controversial penalty as Spillane went full speed and couldn't get out of the way. Raiders are still a play away from getting the ball back. Ameer Abdullah catches a TD pass from Ridder to cap off a 9-play, 68-yard drive. The extra point was blocked -- the third blocked kick tonight -- and the Falcons lead 15-9. We have a game. Ridder had 70 yards passing and just one incomplete pass on this drive. The Falcons can't get 18 points. Koo missed a 42-yard FG to the left. This game is going about as good as you could imagine. Ridder goes deep for Jakobi Meyers, but badly overthrows him. Justin Simmons picks it off and the Falcons are in Raiders territory. Ridder is 10-of-21 for 72 yards with an INT. Three incomplete pass for Ridder and the Raiders have to punt. Ridder is 9 of 19 for 74 yards. This is ugly folks. Koo drills a 48-yard kick to extend the lead to 15-3 with 13:26 left. Atlanta has scored field goals on two of four possessions in the second half, but this isn't an encouraging performance for their offense. Kirk Cousins finds Drake London on 3rd down for a5-yard gain. At the end of the third quarter the Falcons are up 12-3. Falcons are trying to build the lead. Ridder is 7 of 14 for 59 yards with a 61.3 passer rating. Poor throws throughout the night and teh Raiders averaged 2.6 yards per play. This has been a disaster for the Raiders. The Falcons don't fully capitalize on their short field, getting a 40-yard FG from Younghoe Koo to extend their lead to 12-3. Drake London was open on 3rd down, but Cousins flat out missed him. Falcons 12, Raiders 3 The Raiders have a catch nullified by penalty then have a punt blocked., Falcons get the ball at the Raiders' 37 to start their first possession of the second half. This game has bene sore on the eyes. The Falcons can't score points on offense and the Raiders can't move the ball efficiently. It's 9-3 Falcons at the half. After the Falcons decide to punt, they pin the Raiders down at the 3. Alexander Mattison runs for -2 yards than gets tackles for a safety on the next play. The Falcons strategy worked -- just hav eto play the Raiders. Falcons 9, Raiders 3 Atlanta had Younghoe Koo line up for a 56 yard FG attempt, only to run the clock all the way down to zero and take a delay of game penalty. Not like Koo hasn't made 56 yard kicks in domes before. Atlanta punts and remains up 7-3. The raiders respond to the Falcons TD with a nine-play, 37-yard drive of their own. Daniel Carlson drilled a 52-yard FG to get Vegas on the board. Desmond Ridder is 5 of 8 for 32 yards -- along with 22 yards rushing Falcons 7, Raiders 3 Cousins fires a 30-yard TD to Drake London to get the Falcons on the board. First time in five games Cousins throws a TD. London was wide open after his man slipped. Falcons 7, Raiders 0 Cousins is 3-of-3 for 21 yards to start, but the development is Bijan Robinson averaging 6.8 YPC. Falcons driving. Kirk Cousins gets sacked by Jonah Laulu and the Falcons go 3-and-out. -5 yards on the drive. Not a great start for Atlanta. Alexander Mattison fumbled as the Raiders were playing for field position on 3rd-and-23. Kevin King got the forced fumble and fumble recovery. Falcons get the takeaway. Start at Raiders 48. The Raiders tried a double reverse with Jakobi Meyers -- a former QB -- going back to pass. It didn't go well. Loss of 10 yards. Kaden Elliss on the sack. We're gonna see Desmond Ridder and the Raiders offense to start. Ridder started 17 games -- including 13 last year -- in his two years playing for the Falcons. W-L -- 4-1 Comp PCT -- 66.1 Yds/Att -- 6.8 Pass Yds/Gm -- 243.8 TD/INT -- 9/6 >> Started 0-9 in career on MNF 87 receptions this season (most by rookie TE in NFL History) A loss would be huge for the Raiders tonight. They held the 2025 No. 1 overall pick entering Week 15 (using strength of schedule tiebreaker w/NYG for all 17 opponents). They'll keep it with a loss. The Falcons are the first team in NFL history with 0 Pass TD and 8+ INT on offense, and 8+ Pass TD allowed and 0 INT on defense in a 4-game span. QB Aidan O'Connell (emergency 3rd QB) DE Maxx Crosby DE Charles Snowden CB Sam Webb OL Andrus Peat With O'Connell inactive, Desmond Ridder officially gets the start. RB Carlos Washington Jr. ILB Rashaan Evans DL Brandon Dorlus OL Elijah Wilkinson T Brandon Parker WR Casey Washington Good evening everyone.
