From their conquests of Seattle and Minnesota earlier in the season to more recent outbursts against the Packers and Bills, Detroit seems to have a knack for this whole scoring thing. And Monday night matchup against the 49ers did little to knock Dan Campbell's side off course. Fueled by heroics from Jared Goff and Jahmyr Gibbs, as well as timely takeaways via a pair of Kerby Joseph interceptions, Detroit emerged victorious, downing San Francisco, 40-34, in a modern-day ESPN classic. Goff ‚Äî 26-of-34 passing for 303 yards, three touchdowns and zero interceptions ‚Äî bested his opposite number, Brock Purdy, who put up strong numbers himself ‚Äî 27-of-35 passing for 377 yards, three touchdowns and two interceptions. While the Lions' 30-year-old QB might not be an MVP candidate, he certainly looked the part underneath the Levi's Stadium lights, crafting one of his most effective performances in a year increasingly defined by them. He was far from alone, however. Gibbs (22 touches, 163 yards from scrimmage, one touchdown) showcased his multifaceted style of play, as did Jameson Willams (five catches, 77 yards, two touchdowns). Amon-Ra St. Brown was always available, snagging eight passes for 60 yards and a score. Then there was Sam LaPorta, the second-year receiving maven who showcased his blocking chops in open space throughout the match. Detroit's defense left much to be desired, conceding 34 points to an offense that has looked rather listless at points due to injury concerns. Still, that offense is sugar. And as long as Campbell and Ben Johnson are able to write up some attack-heavy game script, the Lions should always have a chance.

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) The big prizes for the Detroit Lions remain on the horizon, with the team seeking a division title, the top seed in the NFC playoffs and the franchise's first Super Bowl trip. With almost nothing at stake in a rematch of last season's NFC championship game that Detroit lost to San Francisco, coach Dan Campbell and the Lions approached it with the same sort of ferocity that has defined his tenure. Jared Goff threw three touchdown passes and the Lions tuned up for their Week 18 division showdown against Minnesota by beating the 49ers 40-34 on Monday night. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the only way we know. It's just go and find a way to win,‚Äù Goff said. \"This is what ended our season last year. There‚Äôs a lot of guys on this team that were there last year that wanted to get one back on them even though in a lot of ways it was meaningless for them and it was meaningless for us.\" The stakes for this game were miniscule compared to the last meeting between the teams when a berth in the Super Bowl was on the line last January. San Francisco was eliminated from playoff contention last week and Detroit plays Minnesota in the regular-season finale next week, with the winner earning the NFC North title and top seed in the NFC playoffs, and the loser relegated to being the first 14-win wild-card team in NFL history. ‚ÄúThis is just fairytale stuff,‚Äù Campbell said. Had the Vikings lost on Sunday, Detroit could have clinched the division and No. 1 seed on Monday night. But now the win against the 49ers would only matter if Detroit and Minnesota tie in Week 18, with the Lions now set to earn the No. 1 seed in that unlikely scenario. Campbell said he considered resting some starters but decided it would be unfair to the backups who hadn't prepared and the starters who still would have had to play. It all worked out, with the Lions getting the win and coming out healthy. ‚ÄúI ended up settling on the right thing to do was playing those guys,‚Äù he said. \"We owed it to the team. ... That was tough. I think the biggest thing is there was things we wanted to do better than we did last week, and we did.\" Goff threw a go-ahead touchdown pass to Amon-Ra St. Brown in the final minute of the third quarter following the first of Kerby Joseph's two second-half interceptions against Brock Purdy. That proved to be enough for the Lions (14-2) to complete a perfect regular season away from home, beat the 49ers (6-10) on the road for the first time since 1975 and get a small bit of revenge for last season's playoff loss. ‚ÄúI still had that chip on my shoulder from last year,‚Äù Joseph said. ‚ÄúWe were so close and we just came up short.‚Äù Jahymr Gibbs put the game away with a 30-yard touchdown run with less than three minutes left following Purdy's second interception, giving him 117 yards on the night. The offenses dominated for much of the night, with the teams scoring touchdowns on the first five possessions and Purdy and Goff combining to complete the first 17 passes of the game - including a perfectly executed hook-and-ladder play that led to a 42-yard TD for Goff. He threw a short pass to St. Brown, who immediately pitched the ball to Jameson Williams, who streaked down the sideline for the final 41 yards and his second TD of the first half. The only stops of the half came when Renardo Green broke up a pass in the end zone from Goff to Sam LaPorta and when Jake Moody missed a 51-yard field goal in the closing seconds for San Francisco. Purdy threw a 5-yard pop pass for a TD on San Francisco's opening drive of the second half before Detroit's defense finally managed a stop when Joseph intercepted an overthrown pass by Purdy. Goff turned that into a 4-yard TD pass to St. Brown on fourth-and-goal to give the Lions their first lead at 31-28 late in the third quarter. Moody missed a 58-yard field goal that could have tied the game early in the fourth quarter for his ninth missed field goal of the season. Moody also missed an extra point after Joshua Dobbs scored on a TD run in the final minute. Lions: RT Penei Sewell went to the locker room early at the end of the first half to get a thumb injury checked out but there is no concern about his status. 49ers: Purdy left late in the fourth quarter after hurting his throwing elbow on a sack. Purdy said his elbow ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt feel the best‚Äù but initial testing showed that his surgically repaired ligament from the 2022 NFC title game is fine.

                "title": "Lions vs. 49ers score, takeaways: Detroit gets payback from NFC title game loss as Jared Goff throws 3 TDs - CBSSports.com",
                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. It doesn't change the result of last year's NFC Championship, but the Lions' 40-34 win over the 49ers on \"Monday Night Football\" is nonetheless a big win for Detroit, which will now prepare for the right to earn the NFC's top seed after adding another loss to the defending NFC champions' mounting tally. How important was this game to Detroit? Despite having nothing to gain in the standings, Lions head coach Dan Campbell played each of his healthy starters. Campbell also continued to be aggressive with his decision-making, and the result was two big fourth-down conversions that included the go-ahead touchdown pass from Jared Goff to Amon-Ra St. Brown. The Lions turned a tight game into a runaway after recording four unanswered scores during the second half. Fittingly, the back-breaking score was courtesy of Lions running back Jahmyr Gibbs, who committed a costly fumble in January's NFC title game loss. Detroit received yet another MVP-caliber performance from Goff, who threw for 306 yards and three touchdowns on 26 of 34 passing. Jameson Williams scored two touchdowns (including one off a trick play), while Gibbs was a beast on the ground with 117 rushing yards in addition to his four catches for 46 yards. The Lions' defense recorded a pair of second-half picks against 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy, who left the game after injuring his elbow with under two minutes left. His backup, Josh Dobbs, made the final score look closer with a late touchdown run. The game started with five consecutive drives that ended with touchdowns. San Francisco took a 21-13 halftime lead on the strength of Purdy's 200 passing yards, two touchdown passes and 9-yard touchdown run during the game's first 30 minutes. But from there, it was all Detroit. Here's how the Lions took care of business in the Bay. It was a complete team victory as the Lions outplayed the 49ers in all three phases. The Lions' offense racked up 475 yards on a night when they made history by becoming the first offense in NFL history to have two receivers and two running backs to each post 1,000 all-purpose yards in a season. Detroit's offense was money on possession downs, going 9 of 14 on third down and 2 of 3 on fourth down. Each of the Lions' touchdowns came on either third- or fourth-down plays. Defensively, the Lions struggled early but made up for it in the second half with their two picks of Purdy that the offense turned into 14 points. San Francisco's offense was on fire in the first half, but it simply couldn't keep pace with the Lions in the second half. It didn't help that the 49ers' running game was non-existent in the second half. San Francisco ran for just 15 yards on three carries in the second half after rushing for 60 yards and a score on 15 carries in the first half. Without a semblance of a running game, the 49ers put Purdy in a tough spot, as the Lions defense focused all of their attention on him. The result wasn't pretty for the 49ers and Purdy, whose gaudy final stats (377 yards on 27 of 35 passing) were overshadowed by his two big mistakes. Another big factor in the 49ers' loss were two missed field goals by Jake Moody that included a 58-yard miss that would have tied the score early in the fourth quarter. In defeat, the 49ers received solid performances from tight end George Kittle (112 yards on eight catches) and rookie wideout Ricky Pearsall (141 yards and a touchdown on eight receptions). The Lions had already started to build momentum, but it was still anyone's game late in the third quarter. Detroit took the momentum for good, though, when Kerby Joseph picked off Purdy's high pass intended for Pearsall late in the third quarter. The pick set up Goff's go-ahead touchdown pass to St. Brown. It was the second of four unanswered scores by the Lions, who turned a 28-21 deficit into a 40-28 lead. Once again, Ben Johnson dialed up a trick play that worked to perfection. Trailing 14-6 early, the Lions got on the board after Williams scored after catching a lateral from St. Brown. \"This game describes our DNA. Everyone is saying, 'Oh, rest the starters. ... The biggest game is next Sunday night for the 1 seed. This one doesn't matter.' We go out there and we play the whole game. I feel like none of us out there were even thinking of next week. We just wanted to win this one.\" -- St. Brown during his ESPN postgame interview As alluded to above, the 14-2 Lions will host the 14-2 Vikings on Sunday night in a game that will decide which team gets the NFC's No. 1 seed. For the 49ers, they'll wrap up what has been a tough season with a home game against the Arizona Cardinals, who have also been eliminated from postseason contention.

Kerby Joseph is an absolute stud, and he read Brock Purdy all the way for this interception. His second of the night, and NINTH of the season. Those nine interceptions lead the league, and are the most by a Lion since Jimmy Allen in 1981. DET 34SF 286:06 remaining in the fourth quarter Detroit goes 28 yards on eight plays, and Jake Bates is good from 42 yards out. Still a one-possession game despite how San Francisco has played this half. The difference in this game is not only the one Purdy turnover, but the performance of the kickers as well. Bates is 2/2 on FGs, Jake Moody is 0/2. DET 34SF 2810:29 remaining in the fourth quarter We still haven't seen a punt tonight. Why should we with how these defenses are playing. The 49ers have now registered back-to-back empty possessions. Following Purdy's INT (and the Lions TD that came from the short field), Jake Moody missed a 58-yard field goal. He's 0/2 on the night, missing from 51 and 58. Moody was selected by the 49ers in the THIRD round of the 2023 NFL Draft out of Michigan. DET 31SF 2813:25 remaining in the fourth quarter The Lions aren't going to kick field goals near the goal line.

Brock Purdy throws it straight to Kerby Joseph, who takes it back 26 yards to the SF 43-yard line. The 49ers defense gets their second stop of the night. Nick Bosa sacked Jared Goff on third-and-3 to get the Lions offense off the field, and Jake Bates was good from 57 yards out. DET 24SF 284:25 remaining in the third quarter The trading of touchdowns continues. Following the Lions' 66-yard TD drive to open up the second half, the 49ers went 84 yards on six plays, and Deebo Samuel scores his first TD of the game. When I tell you there is zero defense being played tonight, there is zero defense being played tonight. DET 21SF 287:40 remaining in the third quarter Pearsall now has five receptions for 102 yards and a touchdown! His previous career high was 73 receiving yards. Did you expect anything different? The Lions got the ball first to begin the second half, and Goff marched his unit 66 yards down the field on 10 plays, while Sam LaPorta capped the drive with a 6-yard TD. Dan Campbell made the decision to go for two to tie the game, and Goff hit a wide-open Tim Patrick for the successful try. DET 21SF 219:58 remaining in the third quarter St. Brown is one of the best wide receivers in the NFL, and catches like this prove it. St. Brown got up slow after this catch, but he's still out on the field. Brock Purdy registered a perfect passer rating (158.3) in the first half for the first time in his career. This is the Lions' second-largest halftime deficit this season (8 points). Detroit is 1-2 when trailing at halftime this year. The lone win came in Week 10 in Houston vs. the Texans.

After the Lions picked up 62 yards on 11 plays, Jared Goff and Co. were threatening again inside the 49ers' 10-yard line. Facing a fourth-and-3, Dan Campbell kept his offense out on the field, but Jared Goff couldn't connect with Sam LaPorta in the end zone. Lions turn it over on downs, ending our streak of five straight touchdowns. Nick Bosa is back in the game. Seems fine. Someone get a stop! The 49ers just went 70 yards down the field on seven plays, and Brock Purdy ran in the score from 9 yards out -- utilizing the nifty pump fake! Both offenses are flying up and down the field. Five total drives, five total touchdowns. Brock Purdy is liking Pearsall tonight! The rookie is up to 57 yards receiving and a touchdown on three receptions. ¬© 2004-2024 CBS Interactive.

                "content": "38; see text. Falcons (/Ààf…ílk…ôn, Ààf…îÀêl-, Ààf√¶l-/) are birds of prey in the genus Falco, which includes about 40 species. Some small species of falcons with long, narrow wings are called hobbies,[7] and some that hover while hunting are called kestrels.[7][8] Falcons are widely distributed on all continents of the world except Antarctica, though closely related raptors did occur there in the Eocene.[9] Adult falcons have thin, tapered wings, which enable them to fly at high speed and change direction rapidly. Fledgling falcons, in their first year of flying, have longer flight feathers, which make their configuration more like that of a general-purpose bird such as a broadwing. This makes flying easier while still learning the aerial skills required to be effective hunters like the adults. The falcons are the largest genus in the Falconinae subfamily of Falconidae, which also includes two other subfamilies comprising caracaras and a few other species of \"falcons\". All these birds kill prey with their beaks, using a tomial \"tooth\" on the side of their beaks ‚Äî unlike the hawks, eagles and other larger birds of prey from the unrelated family Accipitridae, who use talons on their feet. The largest falcon is the gyrfalcon at up to 65 cm (26 in) in length. The smallest falcon species is the pygmy falcon, which measures just 20 cm (7.9 in). As with hawks and owls, falcons exhibit sexual dimorphism, with the females typically larger than the males, thus allowing a wider range of prey species.[10] As is the case with many birds of prey, falcons have exceptional powers of vision; the visual acuity of one species has been measured at 2.6 times that of human eyes.[11] They are incredibly fast fliers, with the Peregrine falcons having been recorded diving at speeds of 320 km/h (200 mph), making them the fastest-moving creatures on Earth; the fastest recorded dive attained a vertical speed of 390 km/h (240 mph).[12] The genus Falco was introduced in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his Systema Naturae.[13] The type species is the merlin (Falco columbarius).[14] The genus name Falco is Late Latin meaning a \"falcon\" from falx, falcis, meaning \"a sickle\", referring to the claws of the bird.[15][16] In Middle English and Old French, the title faucon refers generically to several captive raptor species.[17] The traditional term for a male falcon is tercel (British spelling) or tiercel (American spelling), from the Latin tertius (third) because of the belief that only one in three eggs hatched a male bird. Some sources give the etymology as deriving from the fact that a male falcon is about one-third smaller than a female[18][19][20] (Old French: tiercelet). A falcon chick, especially one reared for falconry, still in its downy stage, is known as an eyas[21][22] (sometimes spelled eyass). The word arose by mistaken division of Old French un niais, from Latin presumed nidiscus (nestling) from nidus (nest). The technique of hunting with trained captive birds of prey is known as falconry. Compared to other birds of prey, the fossil record of the falcons is not well distributed in time. For years, the oldest fossils tentatively assigned to this genus were from the Late Miocene, less than 10 million years ago.[23] This coincides with a period in which many modern genera of birds became recognizable in the fossil record. As of 2021, the oldest falconid fossil is estimated to be 55 million years old.[24][25] Given the distribution of fossil and living Falco taxa, falcons are probably of North American, African, or possibly Middle Eastern or European origin. Falcons are not closely related to other birds of prey, and their nearest relatives are parrots and songbirds.[26] Falcons are roughly divisible into three or four groups. The first contains the kestrels (probably excepting the American kestrel);[17] usually small and stocky falcons of mainly brown upperside colour and sometimes sexually dimorphic; three African species that are generally gray in colour stand apart from the typical members of this group. The fox and greater kestrels can be told apart at first glance by their tail colours, but not by much else; they might be very close relatives and are probably much closer to each other than the lesser and common kestrels. Kestrels feed chiefly on terrestrial vertebrates and invertebrates of appropriate size, such as rodents, reptiles, or insects. The second group contains slightly larger (on average) species, the hobbies and relatives. These birds are characterized by considerable amounts of dark slate-gray in their plumage; their malar areas are nearly always black. They feed mainly on smaller birds. Third are the peregrine falcon and its relatives, variably sized powerful birds that also have a black malar area (except some very light color morphs), and often a black cap, as well. They are very fast birds with a maximum speed of 390 kilometres per hour. Otherwise, they are somewhat intermediate between the other groups, being chiefly medium grey with some lighter or brownish colours on their upper sides. They are, on average, more delicately patterned than the hobbies and, if the hierofalcons are excluded (see below), this group typically contains species with horizontal barring on their undersides. As opposed to the other groups, where tail colour varies much in general but little according to evolutionary relatedness,[note 1] the tails of the large falcons are quite uniformly dark grey with inconspicuous black banding and small, white tips, though this is probably plesiomorphic. These large Falco species feed on mid-sized birds and terrestrial vertebrates. Very similar to these, and sometimes included therein, are the four or so species of hierofalcon (literally, \"hawk-falcons\"). They represent taxa with, usually, more phaeomelanins, which impart reddish or brown colors, and generally more strongly patterned plumage reminiscent of hawks. Their undersides have a lengthwise pattern of blotches, lines, or arrowhead marks. While these three or four groups, loosely circumscribed, are an informal arrangement, they probably contain several distinct clades in their entirety. A study of mtDNA cytochrome b sequence data of some kestrels[17] identified a clade containing the common kestrel and related \"malar-striped\" species, to the exclusion of such taxa as the greater kestrel (which lacks a malar stripe), the lesser kestrel (which is very similar to the common, but also has no malar stripe), and the American kestrel, which has a malar stripe, but its colour pattern ‚Äì apart from the brownish back ‚Äì and also the black feathers behind the ear, which never occur in the true kestrels, are more reminiscent of some hobbies. The malar-striped kestrels apparently split from their relatives in the Gelasian, roughly 2.0‚Äì2.5 million years ago (Mya), and are seemingly of tropical East African origin. The entire \"true kestrel\" group‚Äîexcluding the American species‚Äîis probably a distinct and quite young clade, as also suggested by their numerous apomorphies. Other studies[27][28][29][30][31] have confirmed that the hierofalcon are a monophyletic group‚Äìand that hybridization is quite frequent at least in the larger falcon species. Initial studies of mtDNA cytochrome b sequence data suggested that the hierofalcon are basal among living falcons.[27][28] The discovery of a NUMT proved this earlier theory erroneous.[29] In reality, the hierofalcon are a rather young group, originating at the same time as the start of the main kestrel radiation, about 2 Mya. Very little fossil history exists for this lineage. However, the present diversity of very recent origin suggests that this lineage may have nearly gone extinct in the recent past.[31][32] The phylogeny and delimitations of the peregrine and hobby groups are more problematic. Molecular studies have only been conducted on a few species, and the morphologically ambiguous taxa have often been little researched. The morphology of the syrinx, which contributes well to resolving the overall phylogeny of the Falconidae,[33][34] is not very informative in the present genus. Nonetheless, a core group containing the peregrine and Barbary falcons, which, in turn, group with the hierofalcon and the more distant prairie falcon (which was sometimes placed with the hierofalcon, though it is entirely distinct biogeographically), as well as at least most of the \"typical\" hobbies, are confirmed to be monophyletic as suspected.[27][28] Given that the American Falco species of today belong to the peregrine group, or are apparently more basal species, the initially most successful evolutionary radiation seemingly was a Holarctic one that originated possibly around central Eurasia or in (northern) Africa. One or several lineages were present in North America by the Early Pliocene at latest. The origin of today's major Falco groups‚Äîthe \"typical\" hobbies and kestrels, for example, or the peregrine-hierofalcon complex, or the aplomado falcon lineage‚Äîcan be quite confidently placed from the Miocene-Pliocene boundary through the Zanclean and Piacenzian and just into the Gelasian, that is from 2.4 to 5.3 Mya, when the malar-striped kestrels diversified. Some groups of falcons, such as the hierofalcon complex and the peregrine-Barbary superspecies, have only evolved in more recent times; the species of the former seem to be 120,000 years old or so.[31] The sequence follows the taxonomic order of White et al. (1996),[35] except for adjustments in the kestrel sequence. Several more paleosubspecies of extant species also been described; see species accounts for these. \"Sushkinia\" pliocaena from the Early Pliocene of Pavlodar (Kazakhstan) appears to be a falcon of some sort. It might belong in this genus or a closely related one.[36] In any case, the genus name Sushkinia is invalid for this animal because it had already been allocated to a prehistoric dragonfly relative. In 2015 the bird genus was renamed Psushkinia.[44] The supposed \"Falco\" pisanus was actually a pigeon of the genus Columba, possibly the same as Columba omnisanctorum, which, in that case, would adopt the older species name of the \"falcon\".[37] The Eocene fossil \"Falco\" falconellus (or \"F.\" falconella) from Wyoming is a bird of uncertain affiliations, maybe a falconid, maybe not; it certainly does not belong in this genus. \"Falco\" readei is now considered a paleosubspecies of the yellow-headed caracara (Milvago chimachima).",

                "content": "Actress Linda Lavin, best known for her role in the classic sitcom Alice, passed away on Sunday at the age of 87. A spokesperson for the Golden Globe-winning star confirmed she had died unexpectedly in Los Angeles due to complications from recently discovered lung cancer. Lavin was working on the Hulu comedy Mid-Century Modern at the time of her death. \"Working with Linda was one of the highlights of our careers,\" show-runners David Kohan, Max Mutchnick and Jimmy Burrows said in a statement. \"She was a magnificent actress, singer, musician, and a heat-seeking missile with a joke. But more significantly, she was a beautiful soul. Deep, joyful, generous and loving. She made our days better. The entire staff and crew will miss her beyond measure. We are better for having known her.\" A native of Maine, Lavin moved to New York after majoring in theater arts at the College of William & Mary. She went on to appear in an off-Broadway revival of George and Ira Gershwin's Oh, Kay!. Over the course of her career, she earned six Tony nominations, the first of which came for her portrayal of Elaine in 1970's Last of the Red Hot Lovers. Lavin won the award in 1987 for playing Kate in Broadway Bound. Lavin also made a name for herself in TV, landing a recurring role as Detective Janice Wentworth in the first two seasons of ABC's Barney Miller. She was later cast to lead Alice in 1976, which made her a household name. The show, based on the 1974 movie Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, saw Lavin as a financially-strained, widowed mother in Phoenix working in a diner. She earned one Emmy nomination and two Golden Globes for her work on the hit show. Speaking to broadcaster Steve Adubato in 2012, Lavin discussed how the role thrust her into the women's movement at the time. \"I knew it behooved me to learn about single mothers and working women,\" she said. \"So I went to Gloria Steinem, whom I had met briefly, and she hooked me up with writers and columnists and news people who were writing about working women. \"I learned that Alice represented 80 percent of all the women who work in this country who were still struggling at 69 cents to the dollar that men were making for the same quality of work. Suddenly, I had a rhetoric, I had a commitment.\" Lavin's storied career also saw her take on big screen roles in a number of movies, including 1984's The Muppets Take Manhattan, See You in the Morning (1989), I Want to Go Home (1989), Wanderlust (2012), and The Intern (2015). In recent years, she appeared in How to Be a Latin Lover (2017), Nancy Drew and the Hidden Staircase (2019), and Being the Ricardos (2021) opposite Nicole Kidman and Javier Bardem. On TV, Lavin was mostly recently seen in the CBS shows B Positive and Elsbeth, as well as No Good Deed, a new Netflix comedy featuring Lisa Kudrow. Lavin attended the show's Hollywood premiere on December 4. Lavin is survived by her husband, the drummer and artist Steve Bakunas, who she married in 2005.

The Alice star looked healthy and happy when she was last seen in early September in Los Angeles. The acclaimed actress sported a colorful outfit of blue slacks with slits up the legs and a printed shirt for the outing. She was nicely made up with light pink-toned makeup as she wore her hair partially back. Lavin easily glided out of her SUV vehicle without the help of a walker or cane as well. Lavin was still working as recently as this month. She was on No Good Deed and also worked on the upcoming Hulu show, Mid-Century Modern. Meanwhile, several celebrities such as Sarah Paulson and Patricia Heaton have shared loving tributes for the stage and screen star. Linda Lavin died unexpectedly on Sunday at the age of 87 due to complications from recently discovered lung cancer. The Alice star looked healthy and happy when she was last seen in early September in Los Angeles That is just under four months after she passed away. The acclaimed actress sported a colorful outfit of blue slacks with slits up the legs and a printed shirt for the outing Lavin was a Tony Award-winning stage actress. Lavin died in Los Angeles on Sunday of complications from recently discovered lung cancer, her representative, Bill Veloric, told The Associated Press in an email. A success on Broadway, Lavin tried her luck in Hollywood in the mid-1970s. She was chosen to star in a new CBS sitcom based on Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, the Martin Scorsese-directed film that won Ellen Burstyn an Oscar for playing the title waitress. The title was shortened to Alice and Lavin became a role model for working moms as Alice Hyatt, a widowed mother with a 12-year-old son working in a roadside diner outside Phoenix. The show, with Lavin singing the theme song There's a New Girl in Town, ran from 1976 to 1985. The show turned 'Kiss my grits' into a catchphrase and co-starred Polly Holliday as waitress Flo and Vic Tayback as the gruff owner and head chef of Mel¬¥s Diner. The series bounced around the CBS schedule during its first two seasons but became a hit leading into All In The Family on Sunday nights in October 1977. It was among primetime¬¥s top 10 series in four of the next five seasons. Variety magazine listed it among the all-time best workplace comedies. Lavin soon went on to win a Tony for best actress in a play for Neil Simon's 'Broadway Bound' in 1987, which also garnered her Drama Desk, Outer Critics and Helen Hayes awards. 'She was a tremendous performer with a generous heart,' the union Actors Equity said on X. The group in 2023 honored her with the Richard Seff Award - given to veteran performers in supporting roles - for her work in Noah Diaz¬¥s 'You Will Get Sick.' She was working as recently as this month promoting a new Netflix series in which she appears, No Good Deed, and filming a forthcoming Hulu series, Mid-Century Modern, according to Deadline, which first reported her death. She also appeared in 2024 as a guest star in Elsbeth, the spinoff of The Good Wife. Lavin was known for her award-winning and illustrious acting career in both arenas of Broadway and television; pictured in Alice portrait between 1976 and 1985 She is perhaps most commonly recognized for her role in the 1976 sitcom Alice; pictured alongside Alice co-stars Celia Weston, Vic Tayback and Beth Howland in September 1984 portrait She was nicely made up with light pink-toned makeup as she wore her hair partially back. Lavin easily glided out of her SUV vehicle without the help of a walker or cane as well Lavin was still working as recently as this month Lavin grew up in Portland, Maine, and moved to New York City after graduating from the College of William and Mary. She sang in nightclubs and in ensembles of shows. Iconic producer and director Hal Prince gave Lavin her first big break while directing the Broadway musical It's a Bird ... It's a Plane ... It's Superman. She went on to earn a Tony nomination in Simon's 'Last of the Red Hot Lovers' in 1969 before winning 18 years later for another Simon play, Broadway Bound. In the mid 1970s, Lavin moved to Los Angeles. She had a recurring role on Barney Miller and in 1976 was chosen to star in a new CBS sitcom based on Ellen Burstyn¬¥s Oscar-winning waitress comedy-drama, Alice Doesn¬¥t Live Here Anymore. Back on Broadway, Lavin later starred in Paul Rudnick's comedy The New Century, had a concert show called Songs & Confessions of a One-Time Waitress and earned a Tony nomination in Donald Margulies¬¥ Collected Stories. 'A star in every medium, but pure theatrical genius. Blissfully funny, deeply emotional, and audiences adored her. She never disappointed: I worked with her, and just watching her rehearse and build a performance was an education and the greatest joy,' Rudnick wrote on X. For her performance in the Last of the Red Hot Lovers, she earned her first out of six Tony Award nominations in 1970; pictured alongside Rita Moreno in 1978 Pasadena She went on to take home her first win for her performance in Broadway Bound in 1987. Her most recent Tony nomination was in 2012 for her performance in The Lyons; pictured in Broadway play Broadway Bound Michael Kuchwara of the AP gave Lavin a rave in 'Collected Stories,' writing that she 'gives one of those complete, nuanced performances, capturing the woman¬¥s intellectual vigor, her wry sense of humor and her increasing physical frailty with astonishing fidelity. And Lavin¬¥s sense of timing is superb, whether delivering a joke or acerbically dissecting the work of her protegee.' Lavin basked in a burst of renewed attention in her 70s, earning a Tony nomination for Nicky Silver's 'The Lyons.' She also starred in 'Other Desert Cities' and a revival of 'Follies' before they transferred to Broadway. The AP again raved about Lavin in 'The Lyons,' calling her 'an absolute wonder to behold as Rita Lyons, a nag of a mother with a collection of firm beliefs and eye rolls, a matriarch who is both suffocating and keeping everyone at arm¬¥s length.' She also appeared in the film 'Wanderlust' with Jennifer Aniston and Paul Rudd, and released her first CD, 'Possibilities.' She played Jennifer Lopez's grandmother in 'The Back-Up Plan.' This year, she continued keeping busy and guest starred on CBS' Elsbeth, took on a recurring role on Netflix's No Good Deed and also worked on the upcoming Hulu show, Mid-Century Modern; pictured December 2021 in Los Angeles In the past decade, she had other major roles in television and was a series regular on the NBC comedy series Sean Saves the World as well as CBS' 9JKL and B Positive; pictured in B Positive still Lavin and Steve Bakunas attend the Premiere of Netflix's No Good Deed on December 4 When asked for guidance from up-and-coming actors, Lavin stressed one thing. 'I say that what happened for me was that work brings work. As long as it wasn't morally reprehensible to me, I did it,' she told the AP in 2011. She and Steve Bakunas, an artist, musician and her third husband, converted an old automotive garage into the 50-seat Red Barn Studio Theatre in Wilmington, North Carolina. It opened in 2007 and their productions include 'Doubt' by John Patrick Shanley, 'Glengarry Glen Ross' by David Mamet, 'Rabbit Hole' by David Lindsay-Abaire and 'The Tale of the Allergist's Wife' by Charles Busch, in which Lavin also starred on Broadway, earning a Tony nomination. She returned to TV in 2013 in 'Sean Saves the World,' starring 'Will & Grace¬¥s' Sean Hayes, a show which lasted a season. Lavin also made appearances on 'Mom' and '9JKL.' Sarah Paulson and Patricia Heaton were among those paying tribute to Broadway star and sitcom actress Linda Lavin following her passing at age 87. Paulson, 50, who starred opposite Lavin on Broadway's Collected Stories, posted a slew of selfies accompanied by sweet messages about the star. 'I love you forever,' she wrote alongside a photo booth shot of the duo. She also included a picture of them taking their bows following a performance of Collected Stories. 'One of the great honors of my life,' Paulson remarked. '(I wasn't very good, she was brilliant),' she added. One of the photos Paulson shared appeared to have been taken from her recent 50th birthday bash, which was attended by Lavin. She dated the photo December 14, 2024. 'I love you so,' Paulson wrote in the snap of her, Lavin, and another friend. Sarah Paulson was among those paying tribute to Lavin following her passing at age 87 Patricia Heaton was also among the celebs paying tribute to Linda; pictured with Lavin in 2003 Paulson added Lavin was 'always showing up for me' as she shared a snap of them taken earlier this year. Heaton, 66, starred opposite Lavin in the 1987 sitcom A Room For Two, praised the actress as a 'true friend' and 'total force of nature' as she took to X to mourn the loss While A Room For Two, which Heaton described as her 'first major TV' role, last for just two seasons, their friendship endured, and they even had dinner together just a few months ago. 'I'm down here in my basement looking through some old photos and ran across some pictures of me and my dear friend Linda Lavin,' she said in the video. 'She was such a legend. The first major role in television I had was playing her daughter in a short-lived but wonderful show called A Room For Two. She was my mentor, my guardian angel. 'She really looked out for me, taught me a lot. Not just about acting but about life. And we had dinner a couple of months ago when I was in LA. And she was just as sharp and funny and energetic as she always has been. 'And she passed away today,' she said before taking a long pause. 'I'm going to miss her. She was a good friend.' One of the photos Paulson shared appeared to have been taken from her recent 50th birthday party, which was attended by Lavin Paulson praised her former co-star's loyalty She gushed about working with Lavin on Collected Stories as 'one of the great honors of my life' Heaton remembered her friend and former co-star in a video posted to X She posted the clip to X, writing along with a string of broken-heart emojis, 'I just heard the news that my dear friend Linda Lavin died . Totally unexpected, even at the age of 87. A true friend and a total force of nature.' Producer Liz Feldman, who worked with Lavin on No Good Deed and 9JKL , also paid tribute. She shared a selfie of her with Lavin followed with a cast photo from No Good Deed and a lengthy, sweet message praising the late star.'Oh sweet, brilliant, talented, beautiful @linda_lavin. Getting to work with you once was an honor and a joy,' she captioned the post. 'I loved writing for you on 9JKL all those years ago. I just loved YOU. Being around you. In your magnetic orbit. That we got to collaborate again on No Good Deed was simply a gift. You were, as always, incredibly gracious, totally hilarious and pitch perfect. Ready to play and full of life.

                "content": "The Iowa Hawkeyes football program represents the University of Iowa in college football. The Hawkeyes compete in the Big Ten Conference. Iowa joined the Conference (then known as the Western Conference or Big Nine) in 1899 and played their first Conference football season in 1900. They are a Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association. The Hawkeyes play their home games in Iowa City, Iowa, at Kinnick Stadium, with a capacity of 69,250. The Hawkeyes are coached by Kirk Ferentz, who is in his 26th season as the head coach and is the longest current tenured head coach in NCAA Division I FBS. The Hawkeyes have won 13 conference championships (including 11 in the Big Ten). Iowa has been ranked #1 in the AP and Coaches Poll 15 times. Football was first played as a club sport at Iowa in 1872, with intramural games against other colleges played as early as 1882, but it was not until 1889 that the University of Iowa first officially recognized a varsity football team. Beginning in 1892, Iowa played for six seasons as a member of the Western Interstate University Football Association against three other Midwestern flagship state universities. In 1899, again playing as an independent, Iowa completed its first undefeated football season, which led to an invitation to join the Western Conference, now known as the Big Ten Conference. In 1900, the Hawkeyes finished another undefeated season and won a share of the Western Conference title in their first year of conference play. In 1907, Iowa helped form the new Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association with the other three university members of the former WIUFA and participated in football in the new league, while retaining its existing membership in the Western Conference. Iowa tied for the league championship in the first season of competition, but would leave the conference soon thereafter to return to sole competition in the Western Conference.[4] Iowa claimed consecutive Big Ten titles in 1921 and 1922, and were recognized as national champions in those years. The Hawkeyes won 20 straight games in the early 1920s under the guidance of Hall of Fame coach Howard Jones. But Jones soon left Iowa and established a powerhouse at Southern California, and the Hawkeyes were abysmal for most of the 1930s. Iowa was expelled from the Big Ten on May 25, 1929. The reasons were officially unstated and university president Walter Jessup professed not to know why the faculty committee voted to expel the university. Suspicions of player compensation and Iowa's inaction to address alleged ethics violations appear to have been the main cause.[5] Following the 1929 season, the Big Ten faculty committee unanimously voted to reinstate Iowa to the conference on February 1, 1930. On December 11, 1929, Iowa had disqualified 27 players, presumably due to compensation issues, and was advised not to seek reinstatement of any of those players.[6] Little was expected of Iowa's 1939 team based upon its overall record in the decade, but led by their new coach Eddie Anderson the team exceeded expectations and had a glorious run. Nicknamed the \"Ironmen\" because a small number of players shouldered the brunt of the time played, the 1939 Hawkeyes scored several upset victories and vaulted into the national rankings. Though Iowa fell a game short of winning the Big Ten title, team MVP Nile Kinnick won almost every major national award, including the 1939 Heisman Trophy. Forest Evashevski was hired as Iowa's head coach in 1952. He lured Calvin Jones to Iowa, where Jones became the first Hawkeye ‚Äì and the first African-American ‚Äì to win the Outland Trophy in 1955. From 1956 to 1960, Evashevski led Iowa to four finishes in the top five of the national rankings, three Big Ten Conference titles, two Rose Bowl victories (in 1957 and 1959), and the 1958 FWAA national championship. After the 1960 season, Evashevski left coaching to become Iowa's athletic director. In 1960 the Hawkeyes held on to the No. 1 ranking for much of the season. The Hawkeyes defeated No. 8 Ohio State, No. 15 Michigan State, and No. 10 Purdue. Iowa lost to rival No. 3 Minnesota. The game was the only loss of the year for the 1960 Hawkeyes and they shared the Big Ten title with Minnesota. However, at that time, the Big Ten did not allow their teams to go to any bowl except for the Rose Bowl. As such, Minnesota was picked over Iowa to go to Pasadena and Iowa was left out, despite a No. 2 ranking in the Coaches' Poll and a No. 3 ranking in the AP. Minnesota went on to win the National Championship, as the final AP poll was conducted before their Rose Bowl loss to Washington. This season is known as the \"Forgotten Season\",[citation needed] for despite ending the season with a No. 2/3 ranking and a share of the Big Ten title, the Hawks were left out of January play. Evashevski's departure from the sidelines began a two-decade downturn in Iowa's fortunes. Jerry Burns coached from 1961 though 1965. He had a 16‚Äì27‚Äì2 record. His first team finished 5‚Äì4, which would be Iowa's last winning record for 20 years. Ray Nagel followed from 1966 to 1970 with a 16‚Äì32‚Äì2 record. A 3-3-2 record in 1963 and consecutive 5‚Äì5 records in 1968 and 1969 would be the Hawks' only non-losing records from 1962 to 1980. Frank Lauterbur followed, coaching from 1971 to 1973 with a 4‚Äì28‚Äì1 record, with a 0‚Äì11 record in 1973. Bob Commings coached the Hawkeyes from 1974 to 1978. His record was 18 wins and 37 losses. Hall of Fame coach Hayden Fry was hired after the 1978 season[7] to reverse Iowa's fortunes. Considering the awful state of the program upon his arrival, Fry didn't take long to return the Hawkeyes to respectability. In his third year, Fry led the Hawkeyes to their first winning season in 21 years, a share of the Big Ten title, and a berth in the Rose Bowl‚Äìonly the third bowl appearance in school history. He had vowed to resign if he didn't get the Hawkeyes to a bowl within four years. Fry would go on to lead the Hawkeyes to three Big Ten titles (one outright, two shared) and 14 bowl games (including two more Rose Bowls in 1986 and 1991). His best team was the 1985 unit, which won a then school-record 10 games and garnered Iowa's first outright Big Ten title in 27 years. That team spent most of October ranked No. 1 in both major polls, the highest they had been ranked that far into the season in two decades. Among the legacies that Fry left behind is the now iconic Tiger Hawk logo and a widely reviled pink visitors' locker room (better to \"calm\" the opponents). Fry retired in 1998, turning the program over to his former assistant Kirk Ferentz. Ferentz led Iowa to three consecutive top-10 finishes from 2002 to 2004 and two Big Ten titles. The Hawkeyes have been invited to 21 bowl games in the past 23 seasons, and in 35 bowl games over the last 42 seasons. Kirk Ferentz has been the head coach since Hayden Fry's retirement after the 1998 season, and has led the team to a number of Bowl appearances, including two Orange Bowls (2003, 2010) and the 2016 Rose Bowl. Iowa has cracked the Top 25 at the end of the season eleven times during the Kirk Ferentz era ‚Äì No. 8 in 2002, 2003, and 2004, No. 20 in 2008, No. 7 in 2009, No. 9 in 2015, No. 25 in 2018, No. 15 in 2019, No.16 in 2020, No. 23 in 2021 and No. 24 in 2023. Under Ferentz, Iowa won the Big Ten West division three times (2015, 2021 & 2023). Iowa has been selected national champion five times by NCAA-designated major selectors, in 1921, 1922, 1956, 1958, and 1960.[8]: 111, 113 Iowa claims national championships for all five seasons.[2] Iowa finished the 1958 regular season with a 7‚Äì1‚Äì1 record and a No. 2 ranking in the major wire-service polls‚Äîthe AP Poll and the Coaches' Poll‚Äîand won the 1959 Rose Bowl convincingly over No. 16 and 7‚Äì3 California, 38‚Äì12, setting or tying six Rose Bowl records. The AP and Coaches' Polls had named 10‚Äì0 Louisiana State as national champions at the end of the regular season.[9][10] The Football Writers Association of America (FWAA) awarded the Grantland Rice Trophy and their national championship to Iowa after the bowl games were played.[11] Iowa has never finished a season ranked No. 1 in either the AP or Coaches' Poll.[12] Iowa has won 13 conference championships in school history, eight shared and five outright, winning 11 with the Big Ten and 2 in other conferences.[13] ‚Ä† Co-champions ‚Ä° Iowa was a member of the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association from 1907 to 1911 in addition to their membership in the Big Ten. In 1928, the MVIAA split in two: the Big Six (which officially retained the MVIAA name; would become the Big Eight in later years) and the Missouri Valley Conference (which retained the MVIAA administrative team). Since both leagues claim the same history from 1907 until the 1928 split, conference champions during that time are listed as conference champions of the respective leagues. Iowa has three Big Ten division championships. Iowa has appeared in 37 bowl games, including 35 bowl games since 1981. In bowl games, Iowa has a 18‚Äì18‚Äì1 record.[14] The team also accepted a bid to the 2020 Music City Bowl, which was subsequently canceled due to an outbreak of COVID-19 on the opposing team.[15] ^ Eddie Anderson did not coach during the 1943‚Äì1945 seasons to serve in World War II. ‚ÄìIowa did not hire their first head coach until 1892, even though their football program began in 1889. They have had 25 total head coaches in their program's history. Iowa plays Iowa State annually for the Cy-Hawk Trophy, which began in 1977. The teams' first meeting was in 1894. The teams quit meeting after the 1934 season until they renewed their rivalry in 1977. It was in 1977 that the tradition of the Cy-Hawk Trophy began, when the Des Moines Athletic Club donated a trophy dedicated to the rivalry. It was quickly dubbed the \"Cy-Hawk Trophy\". Iowa leads the trophy series 31‚Äì16, and the overall series 47‚Äì24 through the 2024 season.[16] The game is currently held in early September near Patriot Day. Iowa plays Minnesota annually for the Floyd of Rosedale, which is Iowa's oldest trophy game that began in 1935. The teams' first meeting was in 1891. Floyd of Rosedale was created in 1935 after Minnesota Governor Floyd Olson bet a prize pig that the Gophers would win the game, a goal which the Gophers would accomplish that year. After the death of the pig, its image was cast in bronze, and the Floyd of Rosedale trophy was created. Iowa leads the trophy series 45‚Äì43‚Äì2 while Minnesota leads the overall series 63‚Äì53‚Äì2 through the 2024 season.[17] Iowa plays Nebraska annually for the Heroes Trophy, which began when Nebraska joined the Big Ten Conference in 2011. Since the inauguration of the series as a conference game, the game has been played on the Friday following Thanksgiving. Iowa leads the trophy series 10‚Äì4, while Nebraska leads the overall series 30‚Äì22‚Äì3 through the 2024 season.[18] Iowa has played Wisconsin for the Heartland Trophy since 2004. The teams' first meeting was in 1894. Wisconsin leads the trophy series at 10‚Äì9 and the overall series 49‚Äì47‚Äì2 through the 2024 season.[19] Iowa's home jersey is black with white numerals, with gold and white stripes on the sleeves. The away jersey is white with black numerals, and gold stripes on the sleeves. Players' names are located above the numerals on the back of the jersey. Gold pants with a black stripe are worn with both the home and away jersey. Iowa's helmets are black with a black facemask. They also have a gold stripe and the gold Iowa Hawkeye logo included on both sides of the helmet. In 1979, Hayden Fry helped to create the Tiger Hawk, the logo seen on Iowa's football helmets.[20] Since both teams shared the colors of black and yellow gold, Fry sought and gained permission from the Pittsburgh Steelers, the dominant National Football League (NFL) team of the 1970s, to overhaul Iowa's uniforms in the Steelers' image. Fry's idea was that if the team were going to act like winners, they first needed to dress like winners. Fry had originally asked Steelers defensive tackle \"Mean\" Joe Greene for a replica helmet and home jersey; Greene was able to send Fry to one of the team owners, and three days later, the owners sent Fry reproduction copies of the home and away uniform of Steelers quarterback Terry Bradshaw, making Iowa one of only a few schools to use the uniform scheme of an NFL team; others include the Blue Devils of Duke University whose football uniforms resemble those of the Indianapolis Colts. Although the uniforms appear substantially the same, there are subtle differences, mainly in the font of the numerals, the scheme of the white away jerseys, and the width of the pants and jersey stripes. The Hawkeyes have removed the Tiger Hawk helmet logo and the single yellow gold stripe from their game helmets on five occasions as a symbolic gesture of mourning. The first instance was on November 2, 1991, in recognition of the six victims of a fatal campus shooting.[21] The second occasion was for a December 29, 1996, appearance in the Alamo Bowl. It served to commemorate the family of linebacker Mark Mitchell, who were involved in a fatal vehicle accident while en route to the game. The accident resulted in the death of Mitchell's mother and severe injuries to his father and two brothers.[22] Third came on Veterans' Day 2011 when they used a red, white, and blue Tiger Hawk on one side and left the other side blank in honor of our fallen heroes against Michigan.[23] Fourth was September 12, 2015, when they honored Tyler Sash, former Iowa Safety and NFL Veteran, who had died on September 8, 2015.[24] To honor Sash, one Tiger Hawk was replaced with a large, gold \"#9\" a tribute to the jersey number Sash wore while he played at Iowa. The Tiger Hawk was removed for a fifth time during the 2019 Holiday Bowl in San Diego, California to honor the passing of former Iowa Hawkeye football coach, Hayden Fry.[21] The Hawkeyes have won all five memorial games. The Iowa Athletic Director has okayed only seven stickers on the helmets from 1985 to the present. The first was in 1985, when a gold disk appeared, with the black letters \"ANF\", which stands for America Needs Farmers. This sticker had remained in place until 1992 when the NCAA required teams to remove 'excessive' decals. However, it was brought back by head coach Kirk Ferentz in 2009 and has remained in place since. The second was a small black sticker on the back of the helmet, with white letters that spelled out \"EVY\", the nickname of legendary Iowa head coach, and athletic director, Forest Evashevski, to commemorate his death in 2009. The third was in memory of Iowa high school football coaching legend Ed Thomas, who was killed in his team's weight room by a former player. A small gold sticker with the black letters \"FFF\" placed near the crown of the helmet represents \"Faith, Family, Football,\" a motto Coach Thomas preached to his players to represent what his players' priorities should be not only through the season, but throughout life. The fourth was a small green sticker, with the number 30 on it to honor former Hawkeye Safety Brett Greenwood, who had recently fallen into a coma while working out at his old high school. Fifth was a small black sticker with a gold \"TS\", worn on the back of the helmet to commemorate the death of former Hawkeye safety Tyler Sash. Another decal was commissioned to honor former Polk County deputy sheriff Ron Stewart died on October 9, 2016, at the age of 76. Stewart volunteered his time providing security for the Iowa Football team at home and road games from 1982 to 2014. For the remainder of the season, the Hawkeyes wore a decal on the back of their helmets bearing his initials \"RS\" within a sheriff's badge in his memory.[25] Most recently, a special helmet decal was worn to honor former Iowa Hawkeye football player Damon Bullock, who died at the age of 25 in March 2019. For the 2019 season opener, the Hawkeyes wore a gold circle with black lettering detailing \"DB5\" on the back of their helmets, a nod to Bullock's playing number from 2011 to 2014, in addition to a gold graduation cap, honoring the team's recent graduates.[26] Nile Kinnick Stadium, formerly known as Iowa Stadium, is the home stadium of the University of Iowa Hawkeyes in Iowa City, Iowa. It opened as Iowa Stadium in 1929; prior to that time, Iowa played its home games at Iowa Field. Iowa Stadium was renamed Nile Kinnick Stadium in 1972 in honor of Nile Kinnick, the 1939 Heisman Trophy winner and the only Heisman winner in university history, who died in service during World War II. It holds 69,250 people,[27] making it the 25th largest college football stadium in America and the 82nd largest sports stadium in the world. On Nov. 21, 1953, an undefeated No. 1 ranked Notre Dame team was set to face the Hawkeyes in South Bend. In the first quarter, Iowa defensive back Dusty Rice intercepted the Irish, which allowed the Hawkeyes to drive the ball 72 yards for an Iowa touchdown and a 7‚Äì0 lead. With only 2 seconds left in the first half, Irish tackle Frank Varrichione fell down with an injury which stopped the clock (Notre Dame had no time outs left). Varrichione went in that same play and the Irish scored on a touchdown pass to Dan Shannon, to tie the game 7‚Äì7 at the half. With the score still deadlocked late into the fourth quarter, Iowa intercepted a pass on their own 48-yard line. The Hawkeyes then scored on a touchdown pass to end Frank Gilliam to give the Hawkeyes a 14‚Äì7 lead with 2:06 left in the game, with Notre Dame having no time outs remaining. With only 6 seconds left and the clock ticking away Frank Varrichione came down with another injury which stopped the clock (again he went back in that very same play). Notre Dame then scored a touchdown to tie the game up and stay unbeaten. After the game, sportswriters such as Grantland Rice and others were infuriated calling it unfair, and the Irish earned the label: \"The Fainting Irish of Notre Dame\". Iowa head coach Forest Evashevski said after the game: \"When the One Great Scorer comes to write against our name, He won't write whether we won or lost, but how come we got gypped at Notre Dame\". The Hawkeyes, who were ranked No. 20 before the game, jumped teams with better records to gain the No. 9 ranking. Varrichione has since admitted that the injuries were fake, in Steve Delsohn's book, Talking Irish: The Oral History Of Notre Dame Football. In addition, Notre Dame Heisman winner Johnny Lattner praised his team's tactics calling it \"Pretty smart thinking, wasn't it?\".[28] Because of this game, the NCAA changed the rules making players sit out at least one down before returning to the game. On November 17, Iowa (ranked No. 7 in the AP Poll) defeated Ohio State (ranked No. 6), 6‚Äì0, before a crowd of 57,732 at Iowa Stadium. Ohio State went into the game with the second best rushing attack in the country but were held to 147 rushing yards, their lowest rushing yardage total in two years. The result broke Ohio State's winning streak of 17 games against conference opponents and clinched for Iowa the conference championship and a berth in the Rose Bowl. After time expired, Iowa fans hauled down the goal posts and paraded through Iowa City.[29] Aided by three rushing touchdowns, the Big Ten Champion Iowa Hawkeyes got off to a 21‚Äì6 start at the half. After the half, Iowa scored two more touchdowns and beat Oregon State 35‚Äì19. With the victory, Iowa won their first Rose Bowl Game in program history. Quarterback Ken Ploen was the game's MVP ending the game with one rushing touchdown and one passing touchdown. This game was lopsided and by the end of the third quarter, with a 22‚Äì6 advantage over the California Golden Bears, Iowa could smell victory (eventually winning by a final margin of 38‚Äì12). With their win in the Rose Bowl in 1959, the No. 2 Iowa Hawkeyes (8‚Äì1‚Äì1) won the Grantland Rice Trophy (in recognition of the national champion) as awarded by the Football Writers Association of America (FWAA) following the bowl games. No. 1 Louisiana State (11‚Äì0) was crowned national champions in both major polls, AP and Coaches', before the bowl games were played. The LSU Tigers went on to claim a shutout victory in the Sugar Bowl over No. 12 Clemson. Official recap‚ÄîThere weren't many among the 60,160 who jammed Iowa's Kinnick Stadium who thought they were watching a matchup of the eventual Midwest entries in the Rose and Orange Bowls. There probably weren't a whole lot more who thought Iowa would avenge a 57‚Äì0 slaughter the Hawkeyes had suffered in Lincoln the year before. However, Iowa took advantage of excellent field position to jump to a 10‚Äì0 first-half lead, then held on to win a 10‚Äì7 stunner over the seventh-ranked Huskers. The Hawkeye defense held the Huskers to their lowest total offense output of the season‚Äî234 yards‚Äîand stopped the Nebraska offense three straight times in Iowa territory after Roger Craig's one-yard TD had pulled the Huskers within 10‚Äì7 early in the final period. NU was stymied in the fourth quarter by a missed 30-yard field goal, a fumble, and Lou King's diving interception, which secured Iowa's victory with 39 seconds remaining. In the first half, the Hawkeyes capitalized on a short punt and an interception to set up a two-yard TD run by Eddie Phillips and a 35-yard field goal by Lon Olejniczak. Meanwhile, the Huskers were held scoreless through three quarters for the first time since 1973 and didn't get out of their own territory until late in the second period, partly because of Iowa punter Reggie Roby's 50-plus yard average. NU quarterbacks Mark Maurer and Nate Mason completed only 8-of-18 passes for 81 yards and rushed 12 times for minus-2 yards. Iowa used its upset win as a launching pad to defeat such teams as UCLA, Michigan and Purdue and post its first winning season since 1961.[30] \"At this minute, this is the greatest victory of my life,\" Iowa coach Hayden Fry said. \"I'm getting to be an old man and I don't want to hurt any of my other teams that pulled off some upsets. But while I've been at Iowa, this is far and away the greatest victory. \"If you stay with this game long enough, the worm is bound to turn. Don't think we didn't earn this one, either. We did it fair and square, plus we showed a lot of character.\"[31] The Hawkeyes trailed 10‚Äì9 late in the fourth quarter, in what may be considered the greatest game played at Kinnick Stadium. Iowa got the ball, with 5:27 left, on their own 22-yard line. Led by their All-American Quarterback, Chuck Long, Iowa drove the ball to the Michigan 12-yard line. As the clock expired, kicker Rob Houghtlin sent one through the uprights, to give Iowa the win. The Hawkeyes would go on to accept an invitation to the 1986 Rose Bowl.[32] The game has gone down in Hawkeye history known simply as \"The Catch\". Iowa was set to play the defending National Champion LSU Tigers. Despite leading the entire game, Iowa found itself down 24‚Äì25 and got the ball with only 46 seconds left on the clock. With only a few seconds left in the game, Iowa found itself on their own 44-yard line facing a 2nd and 6. Iowa Quarterback Drew Tate threw the ball 56 yards to Warren Holloway for an Iowa touchdown that gave the Hawkeyes a 30‚Äì25 victory over Nick Saban's defending champion Tigers. The touchdown was Holloway's first and only career touchdown.[33] The undefeated Penn State Nittany Lions came into the game ranked No. 3 in the country with hopes of a BCS national championship. The Hawkeyes, on the other hand, were 5‚Äì4 and coming off a tough loss at Illinois. The Hawkeyes jumped out to an early lead following a Penn State sack-fumble on 3rd down during its first drive, but the Nittany Lions would come back to take a 13‚Äì7 lead into halftime. With less than four minutes left in the game, and trailing 23‚Äì21, Iowa strong safety Tyler Sash intercepted Penn State quarterback Daryll Clark's pass inside Iowa territory. The Hawkeyes drove to within field goal range where kicker Daniel Murray made a 31-yard field goal with :01 left to play. Iowa would go on to win 24‚Äì23 and hand Penn State its only regular season loss of the year. The Hawkeyes would go on to beat South Carolina in the Outback Bowl. The win would be the first in a 13-game winning streak for Iowa stretching into the 2009 season. The game pitted the ACC Champion Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets against No. 10 Iowa. On Iowa's second drive of the game, quarterback Ricky Stanzi drove the Hawkeyes 80 yards, culminating in a 3-yard touchdown pass to Marvin McNutt, putting Iowa on top 7‚Äì0. Iowa scored another touchdown on their next drive, following a Georgia Tech punt, with Stanzi hitting Colin Sandeman for 21 yards, extending the Hawkeyes lead to 14‚Äì0. On the ensuing drive, GT punted for the third time in a row. On Iowa's next drive, Stanzi was intercepted by Jerrard Tarrant who returned the pick for a touchdown, cutting Iowa's lead to 14‚Äì7. Georgia Tech received the ball at the start of the second half. Iowa took over on downs after Georgia Tech missed a 41-yard field goal. On Iowa's next drive, they extended their lead by three thanks to a 33-yard field goal from kicker Daniel Murray. At the start of the 4th Quarter, Iowa had a 17‚Äì7 lead. This lead was cut when Georgia Tech drove down the field for its first and only offensive touchdown of the game. The touchdown cut Iowa's lead to 17‚Äì14. However, Iowa running back Brandon Wegher sealed the win for the Hawkeyes with his 32-yard rushing touchdown late in the 4th Quarter. Iowa beat Georgia Tech by a final score of 24‚Äì14. The win marked the first BCS Bowl win for the Iowa program (Iowa had won two Rose Bowls prior to the formation of the BCS). The win also marked Iowa's first Orange Bowl victory. Iowa is one of only five Big Ten teams to compete in and win an Orange Bowl. Iowa entered this matchup against the 9‚Äì0 Wolverines with a 5‚Äì4 record, a letdown given the high expectations entering the season. Michigan arrived in Iowa City with the No. 1 scoring defense and the No. 3 scoring offense in the country. A week after being humbled 41‚Äì14 at Penn State, in the midst of a three-game home losing streak, and after trailing 10‚Äì0 in the second quarter of this game, the Hawkeyes put forth a gritty, spirited effort. Freshman Keith Duncan drilled a 33-yard field goal as time expired to deliver Iowa a much needed win. Akrum Wadley was the offensive standout for the Hawkeyes with 115 yards rushing, and another 52 yards receiving that included a touchdown late in the first half. The Hawkeye defense did their part as well, allowing only 201 total yards and scoring a safety in the 14‚Äì13 win. With Clemson and Washington both losing, this marked only the second time No. 2, No. 3, and No. 4 fell during the same day in the regular-season. The other time was October 19, 1985, and one of the games that day was No. 1 Iowa's 12‚Äì10 win over No. 2 Michigan. Iowa entered this matchup against the 7‚Äì1 Buckeyes with a 5‚Äì3 record. At kickoff, the Buckeyes were ranked No. 6 in the nation and although the game was being played at Iowa's Kinnick Stadium, Ohio State was a 21-point favorite to win. Early on, it was an even contest as the teams traded scores on their way to a 17‚Äì17 midway through the second quarter. However, in the last 3 minutes of the first half, Iowa TE Noah Fant was on the receiving end of two Nate Stanley TD passes, sending Iowa into the locker room with a 31‚Äì17 lead. The second half belonged to the Hawkeyes as they sliced through the Ohio State defense on TD drives of 78, 60 and 47 yards on their way to a resounding 55‚Äì24 win. Notable performances from the game were five TD passes by Iowa QB Nathan Stanley, Iowa CB Joshua Jackson's 3 interceptions, Iowa RB Akrum Wadley rushing for 118 yards on 20 carries (5.9) and Ohio State QB J. T. Barrett throwing four INT's along with three TD's. On the day Iowa racked up a total of 487 yards against an Ohio State defense that came into the game only allowing 302 yards per contest. Many pundits remarked after the season that the lop-sided loss to Iowa was the reason that Ohio State was excluded from the College Football Playoff, even though the Buckeyes had won the Big Ten championship.[34] The Hawkeyes entered this game following a close road loss (24‚Äì22) at Wisconsin. Minnesota, on the other hand, was coming in with an undefeated 9‚Äì0 record and just off a home win against then-undefeated Penn State.[35] However, the Gophers' undefeated season would end during this match, as they fell 23‚Äì19 to the Hawkeyes, despite a late comeback rally. Iowa kept the Gophers outside the end zone for two quarters, forcing two Gopher field goals. At the end of the half, the Hawkeyes were up 20‚Äì6. The Gophers would respond mightily in the second half, both on offense and defense, outscoring their opponent 13‚Äì3 with two touchdowns, one in the third and one in the fourth quarter. They forced a turnover late in the fourth quarter with a chance to win the game, but back to back sacks on first and second down sidelined quarterback Tanner Morgan with an injury, and Cole Kramer had to step in on a 3rd down and 21. His hail mary attempt was ultimately intercepted by Riley Moss, clinching the Hawkeyes' upset.[36] Minnesota would clinch the Big Ten West and play Ohio State in the Big Ten Championship if they won this match, even if they were to later fall to Wisconsin in the season finale, since the Badgers had two conference losses. However, this loss opened the door for Wisconsin to regain a shot at winning the West, which they were able to pull off by upsetting the Gophers on the road.[37] This was also the first of four straight wins for Iowa to end the season. Many pundits called them the \"strongest 3-loss team in the country\" prior to the game, as they lost in three road games by a total of 14 points to conference powers Michigan, Penn State and Wisconsin.[38] Since 2008, Iowa is 5‚Äì1 against AP-top 10 teams at home, their lone loss coming in 2017 to Penn State on a touchdown pass as the clock expired.[39] Extending from the previous season, Penn State was on a 10-game winning streak and Iowa was on a 12-game winning streak. Both teams were ranked in the Top 5 and Fox's Big Noon Kickoff came to Iowa City for the game. Penn State jumped out to an early 17‚Äì3 lead before Iowa closed the gap to 7 by the end of the half. In the 3rd Quarter Penn State would extend the lead to 20‚Äì10, but the Nittany Lions would not score again in the game. Iowa would again close the gap to 7 points with a field goal to close out scoring in the 3rd Quarter. Iowa scored another field goal and a touchdown in the 4th Quarter which was enough to give Iowa the 24‚Äì20 win. After the game, Iowa extended its season record to 6‚Äì0 and obtained its third win over a ranked team in the early season. As a result of Alabama's loss to Texas A&M, Iowa would go on to be ranked #2 in the AP and Coaches Poll the following week. Iowa's official fight song is the \"Iowa Fight Song\" which is sung by the marching band and the fans. Iowa's school song is \"On Iowa\". Iowa also plays a third fight song, entitled \"Roll Along Iowa\". After victories the band plays the Im Himmel gibt's kein Bier Polka, which translates to \"In Heaven There is No Beer\". Before the game (since 2005) the team has exited the tunnel together to \"Back in Black\" by AC/DC before joining hands and running onto the field in unison to \"Enter Sandman\" by Metallica.[40] This became known as \"The Swarm.\" Iowa's mascot is Herky the Hawk, a black and gold caricature of a Hawk. Herky was created as a cartoon in 1948, and first appeared at a sporting event in 1959. Herky was actually named after the Greek God Hercules. The term \"Hawkeye\" originally appeared in the 19th century historical novel The Last of the Mohicans by James Fenimore Cooper; it was later used in its plural form to describe the people of the state of Iowa. The University of Iowa adopted this as the nickname for its athletic teams. Founded in 1881, the Hawkeye Marching Band now performs at all Iowa Hawkeye home football games. The band also travels with the team to usually one away game per year and any post-season bowl games. In 2017, Hawkeyes fans created what ESPN called \"college football's coolest new tradition\". In February of that year, the university's children's hospital, which has long had a close relationship with the Iowa football program, opened a new 12-story building across the street from Kinnick Stadium, with the top few floors featuring an unobstructed view of the playing field.[41] The top floor of the hospital features the Press Box Caf√©, a lounge area with floor-to-ceiling windows facing the field that is reserved for patients and their families on Hawkeyes game days, with big-screen TVs available when Iowa plays on the road.[41][42] Following a suggestion posted to a Hawkeyes fan page on Facebook, by Iowan Krista Young, fans now face the hospital and wave to the children and their families at the end of the first quarter of every home game. For home night games, the first of which was against Penn State on September 23, 2017, \"The Wave\" features fans waving with their cell phone flashlights turned on.[42] Two weeks after the Penn State game, with the Hawkeyes at home against Illinois, the Hawkeye Marching Band joined in this new tradition, forming a hand moving side-to-side and \"waving\" at the children during its halftime show.[43] The Wave was even seen in the offseason‚Äîon February 15, 2018, inspired by a suggestion from nurses at the children's hospital, the stadium's maintenance crew created a pattern of a waving hand in snow that was covering the playing field. At least one patient was reported to have seen the crew creating the design, and upon completion, the crew went into the Press Box Caf√© to see their final product.[44] The tradition has even spread beyond the Iowa fan base. With Iowa playing at Michigan State on September 30, ESPN's College GameDay aired a six-minute feature on The Wave, followed by the feature's reporter, Tom Rinaldi, leading the crowd at the Virginia Tech campus in a wave of their own.[45] A few hours later at the end of the first quarter of the Iowa‚ÄìMichigan State game, Spartans fans joined in The Wave with visiting Iowa fans.[46] Disney Sports announced it would present the Iowa football program with its Disney's Wide World of Sports Spirit Award, which annually goes to college football's most inspirational figure on November 20, 2017. The award was presented to the University of Iowa for The Wave on ESPN on December 7, 2017.[47] Since the 2023 season, Iowa has been ranked in the final Associated Press poll 26 times and the Coaches 25 times. The Hawkeyes have finished the season ranked in the Top 10 in the Associated Press poll 13 times. The 1940s and 1970s are the only decades that the Iowa Hawkeyes have not had a team finish in the Associated Press poll Top 10 since the poll's inception in 1936. The Hawkeyes have also been ranked in the final College Football Playoff Rankings five times since its inception in 2014. An Iowa player has been selected as a Consensus All-Americans 35 times, with 33 players having been honored as such (two players Cal Jones and Larry Station received the honor twice). A total of 16 Hawkeyes have been named as unanimous All-American. In 2013, Iowa introduced the Kinnick Stadium Wall of Honor. Players inducted into the Kinnick Wall of Honor have their name and number placed on the Kinnick Stadium Press Box. The Hawkeyes have won 17 NCFAA individual player awards. Iowa also won the 2017 Disney's Wide World of Sports Spirit Award, Iowa Head Coach Kirk Ferentz won the Eddie Robinson Coach of the Year Award in 2015 and Iowa Defensive Coordinator Phil Parker won the Broyles Award in 2023 bringing Iowa's total NCFAA awards to 20. ‚Ä¢Heisman Trophy ‚Ä¢Maxwell Award ‚Ä¢Davey O'Brien Award ‚Ä¢Ray Guy Award ‚Ä¢John Mackey Award ‚Ä¢Lou Groza Award ‚Ä¢Butkus Award ‚Ä¢Doak Walker Award ‚Ä¢Jim Thorpe Award ‚Ä¢Outland Trophy ‚Ä¢Dave Rimington Trophy ‚Ä¢AP Athlete of the Year ‚Ä¢AP Player of the Year ‚Ä¢UPI Lineman of the Year ‚Ä¢Ozzie Newsome Award ‚Ä¢Jack Tatum Trophy ‚Ä¢William V.

Both Kinnick and Jones were consensus first team All-Americans, and both men died in separate plane crashes before their 25th birthday. Kinnick won the University of Iowa's only Heisman Trophy in 1939 and is the man for whom Kinnick Stadium is named. Jones was the first African-American to win the Outland Trophy and is one of only two Hawkeyes to be named Consensus All-American two times. Jones also finished 10th in the Heisman Trophy voting, an impressive finish for a lineman. Five Hawkeyes have been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.[49] Iowa has 16 inductees in the College Football Hall of Fame.[55] The Rose Bowl has inducted four Iowa coaches and players into the Rose Bowl Game Hall of Fame.[58] Iowa has had at least one player drafted in every NFL Draft since 1978. Through the 2020 NFL draft, Iowa has had 294 draft picks. 254 in the NFL, 21 in the AFL, and 7 in the AAFC (the AFC and AAFC both merged with the NFL). and 83 players have gone in the first three rounds of the NFL Draft. Iowa has had 26 first round NFL Draft selections:[60] Announced schedules as of June 28, 2022[61]",

                "content": "The 2024 Iowa Hawkeyes football team represented the University of Iowa as a member of the Big Ten Conference during the 2024 NCAA Division I FBS football season. The Hawkeyes were led by Kirk Ferentz in his 26th year as head coach. Iowa played their home games at Kinnick Stadium located in Iowa City, Iowa, and sold out all seven home contests for the third consecutive season. at Kinnick Stadium ‚Ä¢ Iowa City, IA Iowa opened the season against Illinois State, whom they had played only once previously, a 31‚Äì14 win to open the 2015 season. The Hawkeyes had just a 6‚Äì0 lead at halftime, but the offense came alive in the second half, scoring 34 points behind a balanced attack. The Hawkeye defense forced three turnovers, had four sacks, and pitched a shutout in a game in which the Redbirds never put together a scoring threat. Head coach Kirk Ferentz served a one-game suspension following a recruiting violation, making this the first game since November 25, 1978, that neither Hayden Fry nor Ferentz patrolled the Iowa sideline.[15][16][17] at Kinnick Stadium ‚Ä¢ Iowa City, Iowa Iowa had won seven of the last eight in this trophy series. While the Hawkeyes had a double-digit lead at halftime, two first and goal situations inside the 5 yard line (that netted only 6 points) and a failed two-point conversion set the stage for Iowa State's comeback win.[19][20] (Gold Out Spirit game) at Kinnick Stadium ‚Ä¢ Iowa City, Iowa In the last non-conference game for the Hawkeyes, the team struggled in the first half but put up four touchdowns in the second.[22][23] at Huntington Bank Stadium ‚Ä¢ Minneapolis, Minnesota Iowa was out for revenge and to recapture Floyd after the previous year's controversial ending. They were outplayed in the first half but completely dominated the second. The victory was the fifth consecutive for the Hawkeyes at Huntington Bank Stadium and tied Kirk Ferentz with Amos Alonzo Stagg in career wins as a Big Ten coach (199).[25][26][27] at Ohio Stadium ‚Ä¢ Columbus, Ohio The Hawkeyes haven't won in Columbus since 1991 and were humbled during their last visit two years prior. After a competitive first half the Buckeyes ran away with the game in the second. [28][29] (ANF Black and Gold Spirit Game) at Kinnick Stadium ‚Ä¢ Iowa City, Iowa These programs hadn't faced each other since the 1995 Sun Bowl. Playing Washington for the first time as a Big Ten opponent, Iowa held a 10-point halftime lead before dominating the second half. The victory gave Kirk Ferentz his 200th win at Iowa.[30][31] at Spartan Stadium ‚Ä¢ East Lansing, Michigan Iowa's offense sputtered for most of the game, and Michigan State sustained drives consistently in earning a homecoming victory in East Lansing.[32][33] (Homecoming) at Kinnick Stadium ‚Ä¢ Iowa City, Iowa Iowa has won four of last five in this series. However, the Wildcats have spoiled two previous homecomings in the Ferentz era (2008, 2016). After struggling for most of the first half, the Iowa offense exploded in the third quarter with four touchdowns.[34][35] (Black out/ Military Game) at Kinnick Stadium ‚Ä¢ Iowa City, Iowa Wisconsin hasn't won at Kinnick Stadium since 2018. Iowa also hadn't won three in a row in this series in two decades. This was the first career start at Iowa for Brendan Sullivan. The Hawkeyes capitalized on two interceptions to keep the bull in Iowa City for a third year in a row and reach bowl eligibility for a twelfth consecutive year.[36][37] at Rose Bowl ‚Ä¢ Pasadena, California No scoring plays After a strong first quarter, the Hawkeyes remain winless at the Rose Bowl since January 1, 1959. UCLA won their third straight with a strong running game and limiting the running game of the Hawkeyes, who had been the Big Ten's top rushing team. This was the first matchup in the series since the 1986 Rose Bowl, the first regular season matchup since the 1981 season, and Iowa's first visit to Pasadena since the 2016 Rose Bowl.[38][39] at SECU Stadium ‚Ä¢ College Park, Maryland Maryland hasn't defeated Iowa since 2014. This was also the first time Brian Ferentz coached against his father. Five Drew Stevens field goals ‚Äì tying a single-game program record ‚Äì kept Iowa in the lead throughout. Junior running back Kaleb Johnson set the single-season program record for rushing touchdowns (21).[40][41] at Kinnick Stadium ‚Ä¢ Iowa City, Iowa Iowa has won nine of last ten in this rivalry series. Additionally, Nebraska hasn't won consecutive games at Kinnick Stadium in a decade. Drew Stevens nailed a 53-yard field goal as time expired to keep the Heroes Trophy in Iowa City.[42][43] at Nissan Stadium ‚Ä¢ Nashville, Tennessee These two programs haven't played since the 2010 Insight Bowl. They were scheduled to play in same bowl four years prior but it was cancelled due to COVID-19 complications. This is also the second time Iowa has been invited to this bowl in the last three seasons. Additionally, a victory would have Kirk Ferentz tied with Woody Hayes in Big Ten career wins.

                "content": "Newcastle United beat Manchester United 2-0 in the Premier League on Monday thanks to early headed goals from Alexander Isak and Joelinton at Old Trafford, an ugly culmination of one of the most miserable months in the home side's recent memory. With five losses in their last six league games, Manchester United languish 14th in the standings on 19 points, their worst placing to end a calendar year since they were 15th in 1989. Newcastle are fifth on 32 points. \"One of the more difficult moments in the history of Manchester United,\" said manager Ruben Amorim, who called the team's position in the table embarrassing. \"It's a very difficult moment, but we have to fight to win the next game.\" Isak got the visitors on the scoresheet in the fourth minute when he leapt to head home a pinpoint cross from Lewis Hall with both Harry Maguire and Lisandro Mart√≠nez failing to pick him up. It was the 11th goal in 11 games for Isak, who has scored more Premier League goals in December than any other player with eight. Newcastle doubled their lead in the 19th minute in near carbon copy fashion with Anthony Gordon sending in a cross that Joelinton headed in. The win marked Newcastle's second victory at Old Trafford in 40 league visits, dating back to 1972. \"We know the hurt this fixture has had for us historically, it wasn't lost on us,\" Newcastle boss Eddie Howe said. \"We didn't necessarily use that with the players, but it was a big step forward for us today. I think we need to win games like this to achieve what we want on a regular basis.\" It is also the first time since 1979 that Manchester United have lost three consecutive league games at home. Their 18 goals conceded in all competitions in December is their most in a single month since March 1964 (also 18). The score could have been more lopsided, with Isak lashing a shot past keeper Andr√© Onana in what would have made it 3-0 in the first half before the offside flag went up to the relief of United fans. Soon after, Sandro Tonali missed an absolute sitter when he ran onto a flick from Gordon but clattered it off the woodwork. \"It feels great. We haven't won in a long time here, it was a great performance and the perfect way to end the year,\" Isak said. \"The challenge was to have the same intensity here as we do at home -- the first half paid off.\" While the home side struggled to get out of their end in the first half, Rasmus Hojlund and Casemiro both squandered chances just before half-time. Hojlund was played in by Martinez but sent his shot across the face of goal, inches from the far corner, while Casemiro unleashed a shot that sailed wide, burying his head in his hands. Ruben Amorim's men were better after the break and Maguire's diving header that goalkeeper Martin D√∫bravka grabbed at least had the Old Trafford crowd -- who had booed their squad off the pitch at the break -- cheering their effort. One of the game's ugliest moments was when the Old Trafford crowd lustily booed struggling Joshua Zirkzee when Amorim took him out of the game in the 33rd minute. There were huge swaths of empty seats, however, by the time the final whistle blew.",

It's the first time United have suffered such a fate since September 1962 and they wrap up 2024 in 14th position in the Premier League, seven points above third-bottom Ipswich Town. In the competition's history, four teams in this position in the standings at the turn of the year have suffered relegation at the end of it. Eddie Howe's visitors were swaggeringly excellent during the first half-hour, irrespective of whether they had to be or not. Alexander Isak continued a rich run of goalscoring form with his eighth goal in his past six Premier League outings when he headed home unchallenged from Lewis Hall's fourth-minute cross. There was more defensive incompetence from Ruben Amorim's three centre-backs when Joelinton powered home Anthony Gordon's delivery. It should have been worse for United as the otherwise excellent Sandro Tonali hit the post from close range after Isak botched a straightforward one-on-one. Joshua Zirkzee, a surprise starter for the Red Devils, was substituted in the 33rd minute to roars, catcalls and boos from the home fans, somewhat encapsulating the unedifying spectacle.

The England midfielder set up Casemiro after Fabian Schar's error in first-half stoppage time, but the Brazilian fluffed his lines. United were better after the break as Harry Maguire headed against the post from Diogo Dalot's cross. Substitute Leny Yoro then passed up a presentable headed chance from a right-wing corner with 16 minutes to play. If the home team's relative improvement to avert the total collapse that appeared on the cards during the first period was to Amorim's credit, then what came before did not reflect well on a man who endured his darkest night yet in one of football's most foreboding jobs. The former Sporting CP coach's signature 3-4-3 formation does favours to some United players and not others. Matthijs de Ligt, Maguire and Lisandro Martinez should all enjoy playing in a defensive three, but they were made to look amateurish by the manner of both Newcastle goals. There were square, old and ill-shaped pegs in the myriad holes in front of them. The suspended Bruno Fernandes and Manuel Ugarte were badly missed in a midfield. Marcus Rashford was back on the bench, seemingly never with a realistic hope of seeing the field. Even then, there was no need for Zirkzee's gruesome ordeal. After that regrettable moment, the Stretford End buoyantly backed their beleaguered side, booming out \"Ruben Amorim's Red and White Army!\" It was an admirable enough show of defiance but is the cycle so dizzying and unrelenting at Old Trafford that we're already into the siege mentality chapter of the latest new dawn? The storm Amorim correctly forecast doesn't look nearly ready to pass. Manchester United suffer three consecutive home games for the first time since 1962. This looked like being a humiliation and they did at least steady the ship after halftime, with Harry Maguire hitting the post. But the first half an hour was as bad as it get sin terms of abject incompetence. The Newcastle fans have just enjoyed a deserved celebration in front of their raucous travelling fans. They played brilliantly during the the first half and you can be a few rungs below brilliant to have your way with this United side right now. Thanks for joining us. 90 mins: There will be three minutes added. Stick a fork in this one. 85 mins: Barnes and Willock replace Murphy and Gordon who've both been key to this Newcastle performance. 83 mins: Big old load of scrambled nonsense in the Newcastle box. Eriksen pings a volley over but the offside flag is already up. Antony comes on for De Ligt and a chunk of home fans seemingly take that as their cue to leave. 81 mins: Antony is coming on. Marcus Rashford still has a big coat on. So do I and it feels like there's a similar chance of either of us kicking a ball out there at this point. 78 mins: This has become a bit of a listless trudge. Newcastle are happy enough settling in behind the ball against a United team who, without Bruno Fernandes, lack the gumption to find a way through from open play. 74 mins: Chance for United as Yoro gets up to meet a right-wing corner and glances wide of the corner. The young Frenchman probably should have put that away. 71 mins: A poor clearance from Dubravka interrupts a string of Newcastle \"oles\". Amad gets into the area but the excellent Guimaraes is there to block. He tends to be everywhere. 64 mins: Hall's in-swinger is cleared by De Ligt. Double change for United as Garnacho and Yoro replace Casemiro and Martinez. 63 mins: Dalot fouls the waspish Gordon. Newcastle free-kick deep down the United left. 61 mins: Burn is forced to make a meaty tackle on Hojlund. Newcastle needn't be involved in a game anymore but they absolutely are now. They get some respite as Martinez clatters through Isak to earn fairly stupid booking. 59 mins: Head tennis in he Newcastle box after a Dalot long throw. Last-ditch block to deny Mainoo! United come again, Old Trafford cranking up. Now Dalot with the ball at his feet, Maguire heads against the post! 58 mins: Trippier gets back to keep help repel a Dalot cross and that's his last act as Livramento enters the fray. 55 mins: United continue to poke and prod in midfield. They've looked better since Mainoo has given them numerical equality in there. It makes Amorim's wonky starting XI seem all the more curious. Tino Livramento might be coming on soon. Trippier is down. 52 mins: Decent position for Casemiro but he plonks a cross with the outside of his boot into Dubravka's gloves. Not now, mate. 50 mins: Schar clears behind under pressure from Hojlund and this is a decent start to the second half from United. The corner bobbles about a bit but Newcastle can chalk it off as a minor inconvenience. We're back underway. No further changes. Newcastle should be out of sight. Can Man United make them pay? A few boos greet the whistle. Largely mute befuddlement across most of Old Trafford. Then the Stretford End start chanting \"Amorim's Red and White Army!\". All very laudable but are we really at the siege mentality of this new era already? Newcastle should be comfortably further ahead than 2-0 and that Casemiro miss a few moments ago shows they could still pay for playing with their food. See you in a few moments. 45 mins+1: Oh United should have a goal back! Schar gifts away possession, Mainoo bares down on goal, slips a pass to Casemiro... who lifts a shot wide of the far post. The Brazilian looks annoyed that he was given the ball, as if he was expecting Mainoo to shoot. 45 mins: There will be three minutes of added time. 41 mins: Amad has some green grass to run into but Hall closes the door emphatically. 39 mins: Guimares and Isak having their way with United whenever they please. A timely boot from Casemiro interrupts them this time. 34 mins: A Manchester United chance, Martinez lofts a lovely ball forward for Hojlund down the left channel. He fires just wide of the far post. 33 mins: A tactical change from United. Zirkzee is hooked and Mainoo comes on. The Old Trafford crowd rises to huge cheers before booing the Dutchman as he leaves. Ooooofff. Brutal. 31 mins: Guimares scythes through United again, now Gordon. TONALI HITS THE POST FROM CLOSE RANGE! Newcastle should be completely out of sight. 30 mins: Inexplicably they go short, but still end up with loads of room to cross anyway. Dan Burn should make it three! Then the ball breaks to Isak who lashes a delicious finish into the top corner but he's offside. 29 mins: Burn has left Amad in a heap. \"Play on\" says the referee. Guimaraes drives forward and it's another Newcastle corner. 27 mins: The United goalkeeper takes his defence out of the equation and punches Trippier's corner behind. Trippier has a go at an Olimpico this time. My word, it's not far away. Again. Yikes. 26 mins: Newcastle should concede possession but there's no United player in the same postcode as the second ball. Hall unleashes a rasper that Onana holds. Newcastle have the ball straight back. Good heavens. Tonali's shot is deflected behind. Onana was screwed if that was on target. 24 mins: Zirkzee on the edge of the D duffs a pass straight to Hall. Howls of anguish in the stands. The Dutchman has been woeful so far but he's not alone. 19 mins: GOOOOOAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLL!!!!!! Joelinton 19' Just preposterously easy.

Here they come... 20 mins before kickoff: There's quite the contrast in the warmups at Old Trafford. Newcastle are going through the usual repertoire of rondos, keep-ball, some sprints and stretches. Manchester United, on the other hand, have been doing some very specific positional work with the defensive line about 30 yards from goal and the attackers trying to play through them. Then, the full complement of players practiced defending wide free-kicks. Corners have been an issue for the Red Devils of late, but it was still a pretty unusual thing to witness. Whole United team practicing set-piece defending as part of the warm-up. Not sure I've ever seen that before. pic.twitter.com/fjCFJ0qFzW 40 mins before kickoff: Amorim is keeping his cards close to his chest regarding Rashford's return, although his exchange with Gary Neville on Sky Sports was hardly Frost/Nixon. \"Selection, and we have a lot of players out,\" he said. \"Like I said, every week, I choose my players, and he was there to be chosen.\" With Bruno Fernandes and Manuel Ugarte suspended alongside United's customarily weighty injury list, has Rashford just been picked as a means of filling out the bench?

In his programme notes, Ruben Amorim has doubled down on his conviction that there are brighter days ahead. What I can say for certain is that it will take time, but we will improve. I have no doubt about that. This period will not last forever. When I took this job, I knew that I was signing up for a lot of work. If we are to make the long-term changes that we want to make to Manchester United, then we have to go through that step by step. We are looking to implement a new way of playing at that busiest time of the year, so there are short-term costs. I will say, though, that the players are working hard to take on and use all the new information and instructions they are getting. The longer they do this, the easier it will become for them, and then the comfort and confidence in our game will grow. I have seen enough in the last few weeks to recognise that we have many of the ingredients we need for success and I remain as convinced as I was on my first day here that we will achieve it. In the meantime, it is my responsibility to remain clam and keep everyone together through this period of change. 1 hr 40 mins before kickoff: The main murmurs in the press room at Old Trafford centre on Marcus Rashford. The England forward has arrived at the stadium with the United squad and it is rumoured he will be involved in the matchday squad for the first time since United's Europa League trip to Viktoria Plzen on December 12. 2 hours before kickoff. Hello and welcome to The Sporting News' live coverage of Manchester United vs. Newcastle. Is this the night when Ruben Amorim's forecast storm passes? Well, it's expected to be a rainy night at Old Trafford. This Premier League match kicks off in Manchester at 8 p.m. local time. Here's how that time translates across some of the major territories: Bruno Fernandes' red card at Wolves changed the course of the game and means the United captain is banned for this fixture. Manuel Ugarte is also missing due to a suspension, forcing Amorim to field Casemiro and Christian Eriksen in a central midfield two that appears to lack legs. Mason Mount won't return from his latest injury until at least January, while there is still no word on when Luke Shaw and Victor Lindelof will be available. Matthijs de Ligt has been struggling with illness but completes the back three with Harry Maguire and captain-for-the-night Lisandro Martinez. Arguably the biggest piece of team news comes among the substitutes, where Marcus Rashford features in a United matchday squad for the first time since December 12.

                "content": "Brown is a color. It can be considered a composite color, but it is mainly a darker shade of orange. In the CMYK color model used in printing and painting, brown is usually made by combining the colors orange and black.[4][5][6] In the RGB color model used to project colors onto television screens and computer monitors, brown combines red and green. The color brown is seen widely in nature, wood, soil, human hair color, eye color and skin pigmentation. Brown is the color of dark wood or rich soil.[7] In the RYB color model, brown is made by mixing the three primary colors, red, yellow, and blue. According to public opinion surveys in Europe and the United States, brown is the least favorite color of the public; it is often associated with plainness, the rustic, although it does also have positive associations, including baking, warmth, wildlife, the autumn and music. The term is from Old English br√∫n, in origin for any dusky or dark shade of color. The first recorded use of brown as a color name in English was in 1000.[8][9] The Common Germanic adjectives *br√ªnoz and *br√ªn√¢ meant both dark colors and a glistening or shining quality, whence burnish. The current meaning developed in Middle English from the 14th century.[10] Words for the color brown around the world often come from foods or beverages; in the eastern Mediterranean, the word for brown often comes from the color of coffee: in Turkish, the word for brown is kahverengi; in Greek, kaf√©. In Portuguese, Spanish and French, the word for brown or for a specific shade of brown is derived from the word for chestnut (castanea in Latin). In Southeast Asia, the color name often comes from chocolate: coklat in Malay; tsokolate in Filipino. In Japan, the word chairo means the color of tea.[11] Brown has been used in art since prehistoric times. Paintings using umber, a natural clay pigment composed of iron oxide and manganese oxide, have been dated to 40,000 BC.[12] Paintings of brown horses and other animals have been found on the walls of the Lascaux cave dating back about 17,300 years. The female figures in ancient Egyptian tomb paintings have brown skin, painted with umber. Light tan was often used on painted Greek amphorae and vases, either as a background for black figures, or the reverse. The Ancient Greeks and Romans produced a fine reddish-brown ink, of a color called sepia, made from the ink of a variety of cuttlefish. This ink was used by Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael and other artists during the Renaissance, and by artists up until the present time. In Ancient Rome, brown clothing was associated with the lower classes or barbarians. The term for the plebeians, or urban poor, was \"pullati\", which meant literally \"those dressed in brown\".[13] In the Middle Ages brown robes were worn by monks of the Franciscan order, as a sign of their humility and poverty. Each social class was expected to wear a color suitable to their station; and grey and brown were the colors of the poor. Russet was a coarse homespun cloth made of wool and dyed with woad and madder to give it a subdued grey or brown shade. By the statute of 1363, poor English people were required to wear russet. The medieval poem Piers Plowman describes the virtuous Christian:[14] And is gladde of a goune of a graye russetAs of a tunicle of Tarse or of trye scarlet. In the Middle Ages, dark brown pigments were rarely used in art; painters and book illuminators artists of that period preferred bright, distinct colors such as red, blue and green rather than dark colors. The umbers were not widely used in Europe before the end of the fifteenth century; The Renaissance painter and writer Giorgio Vasari (1511‚Äì1574) described them as being rather new in his time.[15] Artists began using far greater use of browns when oil painting arrived in the late fifteenth century. During the Renaissance, artists generally used four different browns; raw umber, the dark brown clay mined from the earth around Umbria, in Italy; raw sienna, a reddish-brown earth mined near Siena, in Tuscany; burnt umber, the Umbrian clay heated until it turned a darker shade, and burnt sienna, heated until it turned a dark reddish brown. In Northern Europe, Jan van Eyck featured rich earth browns in his portraits to set off the brighter colors. The 17th and 18th century saw the greatest use of brown. Caravaggio and Rembrandt Van Rijn used browns to create chiaroscuro effects, where the subject appeared out of the darkness. Rembrandt also added umber to the ground layers of his paintings because it promoted faster drying. Rembrandt also began to use new brown pigment, called Cassel earth or Cologne earth. This was a natural earth color composed of over ninety percent organic matter, such as soil and peat. It was used by Rubens and Anthony van Dyck, and later became commonly known as Van Dyck brown. Brown was generally hated by the French impressionists, who preferred bright, pure colors. The exception among French 19th-century artists was Paul Gauguin, who created luminous brown portraits of the people and landscapes of French Polynesia. In the late 20th century, brown became a common symbol in western culture for simple, inexpensive, natural and healthy. Bag lunches were carried in plain brown paper bags; packages were wrapped in plain brown paper. Brown bread and brown sugar were viewed as more natural and healthy than white bread and white sugar. Brown is a dark orange color, made by combining red, yellow and black.[16] It can be thought of as dark orange, but it can also be made in other ways. In the RGB color model, which uses red, green and blue light in various combinations to make all the colors on computer and television screens, it is made by mixing red and green light. In terms of the visible spectrum, \"brown\" refers to long wavelength hues, yellow, orange, or red, in combination with low luminance or saturation.[17] Since brown may cover a wide range of the visible spectrum, composite adjectives are used such as red brown, yellowish brown, dark brown or light brown. As a color of low intensity, brown is a tertiary color: a mix of the three subtractive primary colors is brown if the cyan content is low. Brown exists as a color perception only in the presence of a brighter color contrast.[18] Yellow, orange, red, or rose objects are still perceived as such if the general illumination level is low, despite reflecting the same amount of red or orange light as a brown object would in normal lighting conditions. With few exceptions, all mammals have brown or darkly-pigmented irises.[25] In humans, brown eyes result from a relatively high concentration of melanin in the stroma of the iris, which causes light of both shorter and longer wavelengths to be absorbed[26][27] and in many parts of the world, it is nearly the only iris color present.[28] Dark pigment of brown eyes is most common in East Asia, Central Asia, Southeast Asia, South Asia, West Asia, Oceania, Africa, Americas, etc. as well as parts of Eastern Europe and Southern Europe.[29] The majority of people in the world overall have dark brown eyes. Brown irises range from highly pigmented, dark brown (almost black) eyes, to very light, almost amber or hazel irises composed partially of lipochrome. of Light or medium-pigmented brown eyes are common in Europe, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Northern India, as well as some parts of the Middle East, and can also be found in populations in East Asia and Southeast Asia, but are proportionally rare. (See eye color). Brown is the second most common color of human hair, after black. It is caused by higher levels of the natural dark pigment eumelanin, and lower levels of the pale pigment pheomelanin. Brown eumelanin is more common among Europeans, while black eumelanin is more often found in the hair on non-Europeans. A small amount of black eumelanin, in the absence of other pigments, results in grey hair. A small amount of brown eumelanin in the absence of other pigments results in blond hair. A majority of people in the world have skin that is a shade of brown, from a very light honey brown or a golden brown, to a copper or bronze color, to a coffee color or a dark chocolate brown. Skin color and race are not the same; many people classified as \"white\" or \"black\" actually have skin that is a shade of brown. Brown skin is caused by melanin, a natural pigment which is produced within the skin in cells called melanocytes. Skin pigmentation in humans evolved to primarily regulate the amount of ultraviolet radiation penetrating the skin, controlling its biochemical effects.[30] Natural skin color can darken as a result of tanning due to exposure to sunlight. The leading theory is that skin color adapts to intense sunlight irradiation to provide partial protection against the ultraviolet fraction that produces damage and thus mutations in the DNA of the skin cells.[31] There is a correlation between the geographic distribution of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) and the distribution of indigenous skin pigmentation around the world. Darker-skinned populations are found in the regions with the most ultraviolet, closer to the equator, while lighter skinned populations live closer to the poles, with less UVR, though immigration has changed these patterns.[32] While white and black are commonly used to describe racial groups, brown is rarely used, because it crosses all racial lines. In Brazil, the Portuguese word pardo, which can mean different shades of brown, is used to refer to multiracial people. The Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) asks people to identify themselves as branco (white), pardo (brown), negro (black), or amarelo (yellow). In 2008 43.8 percent of the population identified themselves as pardo.[33] (See human skin color). The thin top layer of the Earth's crust on land is largely made up of soil colored different shades of brown.[34] Good soil is composed of about forty-five percent minerals, twenty-five percent water, twenty-five percent air, and five percent organic material, living and dead. Half the color of soil comes from minerals it contains; soils containing iron turn yellowish or reddish as the iron oxidizes. Manganese, nitrogen and sulfur turn brownish or blackish as they decay naturally. Rich and fertile soils tend to be darker in color; the deeper brown color of fertile soil comes from the decomposing of the organic matter. Dead leaves and roots become black or brown as they decay. Poorer soils are usually paler brown in color, and contain less water or organic matter. A large number of mammals and predatory birds have a brown coloration. This sometimes changes seasonally, and sometimes remains the same year-round. This color is likely related to camouflage, since the backdrop of some environments, such as the forest floor, is often brown, and especially in the spring and summertime when animals like the snowshoe hare get brown fur. Most mammals are dichromats and so do not easily distinguish brown fur from green grass. Surveys in Europe and the United States showed that brown was the least popular color among respondents. It was the favorite color of only one percent of respondents and the least favorite color of twenty percent of people.[35] Brown has been a popular color for military uniforms since the late 18th century, largely because of its wide availability and low visibility. When the Continental Army was established in 1775 at the outbreak of the American Revolution, the first Continental Congress declared that the official uniform color would be brown, but this was not popular with many militias, whose officers were already wearing blue. In 1778 the Congress asked George Washington to design a new uniform, and in 1779 Washington made the official color of all uniforms blue and buff.[36] In 1846 the Indian soldiers of the Corps of Guides in British India began to wear a yellowish shade of tan, which became known as khaki from the Urdu word for dust-colored, taken from an earlier Persian word for soil. The color made an excellent natural camouflage, and was adopted by the British Army for their Abyssian Campaign in 1867‚Äì1868, and later in the Boer War. It was adopted by the United States Army during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War (1896), and afterwards by the United States Navy and United States Marine Corps. In the 1920s, brown became the uniform color of the Nazi Party in Germany. The Nazi paramilitary organization the Sturmabteilung (SA) wore brown uniforms and were known as the brownshirts. The color brown was used to represent the Nazi vote on maps of electoral districts in Germany. If someone voted for the Nazis, they were said to be \"voting brown\". The national headquarters of the Nazi party, in Munich, was called the Brown House. The Nazi seizure of power in 1933 was called the Brown Revolution.[37] At Adolf Hitler's Obersalzberg home, the Berghof, he slept in a \"bed which was usually covered by a brown quilt embroidered with a huge swastika. The swastika also appeared on Hitler's brown satin pajamas, embroidered in black against a red background on the pocket. He had a matching brown silk robe.\"[38] Brown had originally been chosen as a Party color largely for convenience; large numbers of war-surplus brown uniforms from Germany's former colonial forces in Africa were cheaply available in the 1920s. It also suited the working-class and military images that the Party wished to convey. From the 1930s onwards, the Party's brown uniforms were mass-produced by German clothing firms such as Hugo Boss.[39][40] Pullman Brown[41] is the color of the United Parcel Service (UPS) delivery company with their trademark brown trucks and uniforms; it was earlier the color of Pullman rail cars of the Pullman Company, and was adopted by UPS both because brown is easy to keep clean, and due to favorable associations of luxury that Pullman brown evoked. UPS has filed two trademarks on the color brown to prevent other shipping companies (and possibly other companies in general) from using the color if it creates \"market confusion\". In its advertising, UPS refers to itself as \"Brown\" (\"What can Brown do for you?\"). Labrecque, et al. (2012) have hypothesized that brown would be related to competence when used in advertising, as the color is typically associated with reliability and support However, they did not find a link between brown and competence.[42]",

The name evolved to Chelsea, a location on the River Thames that became a London borough known for its wealthy, socially influential residents. Many locations have been named after the English place name Chelsea.[2] The given name, a transferred use of the place name, was in use for boys in the New England region of the United States by the late 18th century and was first used for American girls in the 1840s.[2] The name was first popularized for girls in larger numbers in the United States by American comedian Chelsea Brown, who was born Lois Brown but chose Chelsea as a stage name. After Brown began appearing on the American television program Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In in 1968, the name quadrupled in use for American girls to 48 uses that year. The name debuted among the 1,000 most popular names for American girls in 1969, in 702nd place. Chelsea Morning, a 1969 hit song written about mornings in Chelsea, Manhattan by Canadian singer Joni Mitchell and later performed by Judy Collins, further popularized the name for girls with its descriptive lyrics such as \"the light poured in like butterscotch.\"[2] The name of Chelsea Clinton, daughter of American President Bill Clinton and former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, was inspired by the song when she was born in 1980. The name Chelsea increased further in popularity in the 1980s due to its use for film and television characters, such as Chelsea Thayer Wayne, a character played by Jane Fonda in the 1981 American film On Golden Pond and Chelsea Reardon, a character played by Kassie DePaiva on the American soap opera Guiding Light beginning in 1986. In 1992, the name reached peak popularity in the United States and would have been the eighth most popular name for American girls in that year if all spellings of the name were combined. The name dramatically declined in use in 1993, during the first year of Bill Clinton's presidency. At the time, it was out of fashion in the United States to name children after politicians and those who were associated with them. The name has continued to decline in use, but remained among the 1,000 most popular names for American girls in 2023.[2] Spelling variants in use in the United States include Chelsey, Chelsi, Chelsie, and Chelsy.[2] The name has also been in regular use throughout the Anglosphere, including Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, as well as in Belgium, France and Netherlands.[3]",

He played college football for the Iowa State Cyclones and was selected by the 49ers with the final pick in the 2022 NFL draft, becoming that year's Mr. Irrelevant. Purdy began his rookie season in the NFL as the third-string quarterback but took the starting role following injuries to Trey Lance and Jimmy Garoppolo. Winning all five regular-season games that he started, Purdy played a key role in the 49ers' ten-game winning streak, securing a division title and an NFC Championship Game appearance. Purdy continued as the 49ers' starting quarterback in the 2023 season, where he led them to a repeat division title and led the league in multiple passing categories before an appearance in Super Bowl LVIII. Purdy also set the franchise's single-season passing yards record and earned his first Pro Bowl selection. Purdy was born on December 27, 1999, in Queen Creek, Arizona. He played high school football for Perry High School in Gilbert, Arizona.[1] Purdy is the middle child of Shawn and Carrie Purdy. Shawn was a Minor League Baseball player for eight seasons. His older sister Whittney played softball at Southeastern University.[2] His younger brother Chubba later became the starting quarterback at Perry[3] before being recruited to Florida State as a dual-threat quarterback.[4] As a youth, Purdy played quarterback in a flag football league. His father attributed Purdy's later success in part to the faster processing speed required to play flag football; quarterbacks were given seven seconds to dispose of the football before plays were blown dead.[5] Purdy started his varsity football career during the 2015 season as a sophomore for the newly opened Perry High School. In 2016, the Arizona Interscholastic Association (AIA) adjusted the athletic regions, placing Perry in the 6A Division Premier Region, ranked as the sixth toughest region in the nation.[6] Purdy's performance elevated Perry into the 6A Division AIA State Championship game in 2016 and 2017, losing 65‚Äì28 and 48‚Äì42, respectively, both to Chandler High School.[7] Purdy established himself as a football power in Arizona, competing against Chandler Unified School District's more established powerhouse programs such as Chandler High (0‚Äì5), Hamilton (4‚Äì2) and Basha (2‚Äì1). Purdy achieved a 27‚Äì13 record at Perry. He was named Gatorade's Football Player of the Year and was The Arizona Republic's high-school player of the year.[8][9][10] Purdy was considered a three-star prospect by 247Sports.[11][12] He signed his letter of intent to commit to Iowa State University on February 7, 2018, enrolling in June of that year.[13][14][15] Sources: Purdy entered his freshman year for the Cyclones in 2018 as the third string to Kyle Kempt and Zeb Noland. He became the starter after Kempt was injured and Noland was ineffective.[16][17] Overall, Purdy started eight games, completing 146-of-220 passes for 2,250 yards, 16 touchdowns, and seven interceptions for what would prove to be a career-best 169.9 passer rating (sixth best in all NCAA football), and compiling a 7‚Äì2 record for the Cyclones.[18][19] In addition, he rushed for 308 yards and five touchdowns.[20] During Purdy's sophomore season in 2019, he started all 13 games, compiling a 7‚Äì6 record.[21] The year was highlighted by 435 yards and a school-record 510 total yards, along with three passing and three rushing touchdowns against Louisiana-Monroe, five passing touchdowns and one rushing touchdown in a narrow 42‚Äì41 loss to the then number 9 Oklahoma Sooners,[22] and 372 yards with three passing touchdowns and one rushing touchdowns in a win over Kansas.[23] He passed for a touchdown in 12 consecutive games and completed 39 passes against a single team, Oklahoma State‚Äîboth school records. Purdy also led the Big 12 Conference in passing yards with 3,982 and was third in total touchdowns, 27 of them passing, which broke George Amundson's 41-year-old school record of 24 total touchdowns.[24][25] During Purdy's junior year in 2020, he had less flashy statistics, but the emergence of running back Breece Hall led the Cyclones to a 9‚Äì3 record (tied with the 2000 season for the best record in program history) and a number 9 national ranking, their highest in school history dating to 1895.[26] Purdy had three touchdowns and no interceptions in a 45‚Äì0 shutout of Kansas State,[27] followed two weeks later by completing 20-of-23 passes for three touchdowns and rushing for 38 yards and another touchdown during a 42‚Äì6 victory over West Virginia.[28] In the Fiesta Bowl, Purdy passed and rushed for a touchdown in a 34‚Äì17 win over Oregon.[29] In his 2021 senior year, Purdy and Hall again led the Cyclones to a 7‚Äì6 record, highlighted by 307 yards and two touchdowns in a 24‚Äì21 victory over number 8 Oklahoma State.[30] Purdy also had 356 yards and three touchdowns against Texas Tech, but Iowa State lost in a 41‚Äì38 shootout.[31] The season was a disappointment to an Iowa State team ranked number 7 entering the season, but Purdy's 71.7 percent completion percentage and 3,188 yards again led the Big 12.[32] Purdy ended his time at Iowa State as a three-time All-Big 12 quarterback, holding 32 school records including career pass attempts, completions, percentage, yards, and both passing (81) and total (100) touchdowns.[24] His 14 games with 300-plus passing yards was nearly triple the previous school record of five by Bret Meyer.[24] Purdy's four years at Iowa State corresponded with the first time the school's football program had seen four consecutive winning seasons since 1923‚Äì1927.[33] The San Francisco 49ers selected Purdy with the final pick (262nd overall) of the 2022 NFL draft, making him that year's Mr. Irrelevant.[36] The Athletic later obtained the scouting report of another NFL team that evaluated Purdy but opted not to draft him; the report described Purdy as experienced and \"works through his progressions very well\" but \"not a very good athlete...limited arm, both in strength and throw repertoire.\" After observing Purdy's subsequent performance in his first NFL season, the coach who authored the report told The Athletic that while Purdy's record in college was impressive, \"The requirement to juke people and outrun people in college is a lot lower than it is in the NFL... In college, they might be able to outrun that D-end or pull away from that linebacker, but they got hawked down in the NFL. But Purdy has kinda maintained that and almost surpassed his level of agility in the NFL.\" The coach indicated that Purdy's performance in his first NFL season would likely have warranted being drafted in the second or third round, saying: \"We undervalued his agility and probably the mental side, and San Francisco is perfect for it because they put a lot of importance on that because of their offense.\"[37] In October 2023, former 49er quarterback and Hall of Fame member Steve Young opined that Purdy was overlooked in the draft because his calmness under pressure would not have been apparent: \"...the [quarterback] position is really about guile and an innate gift from heaven, in some ways, to be able to have your heart rate go down when everyone else is in anxiety and pressure... But in the NFL, very few are naturally at peace. And that's why when I compare him to Patrick Mahomes, I'm comparing him to how Patrick feels at peace. We all grew into it. Some guys just show up. Patrick showed up at peace, and so did Brock. The draft doesn't understand that thing.\"[38] Trey Lance was named the starter over Jimmy Garoppolo for the 2022 season, making Purdy the third-string quarterback. A week into training camp during the 2022 preseason, 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan told 49ers CEO Jed York that he thought Purdy was the team's best quarterback. According to York, Shanahan told him that nevertheless they would continue to invest in Lance as the starter: \"Obviously we‚Äôve invested in Trey and Trey's doing a good job and we're going to do everything that we can. We're not going to change that. And we're not going to change our depth chart. But I think Brock will end up being our quarterback.\" York publicly recounted this story ahead of Super Bowl LVIII, praising both Shanahan's candor and decision process: \"...one thing that owners don't love to hear when they've invested money and/or draft picks or both into people is that the last pick in the draft is the guy that we think is the best. That‚Äôs generally not great news. But he's honest. And he let it play out the right way.\"[39] Lance appeared in only two games before suffering a season-ending ankle injury against the Seattle Seahawks in Week 2.[40] During a Week 5 37‚Äì15 road victory over the Carolina Panthers, Purdy made his NFL debut, taking a knee to close out the game.[41] Two weeks later against the Kansas City Chiefs, he relieved Garoppolo on the 49ers' last drive, throwing for 66 yards and an interception in the 44‚Äì23 loss.[42] 49ers CEO York later said that Purdy's performance gave him some doubts: \"I think Brock threw one ball into the stands. And I may or may not have had some sarcastic comments for Kyle postgame.\"[39] In Week 13, in the first quarter against the Miami Dolphins, Garoppolo suffered a foot injury, causing the 49ers to call upon Purdy once again. Purdy performed efficiently, and finished the game completing 25-of-37 passes for 210 yards, two touchdowns‚Äîone to running back Christian McCaffrey and one to fullback Kyle Juszczyk‚Äîand an interception during a 33‚Äì17 victory.[43] Purdy became the first 'Mr. Irrelevant' to throw a touchdown pass in a regular season game.[44][a] Following Garoppolo's injury, Purdy was named the 49ers' starting quarterback for the remainder of the 2022 season.[45] On December 11, Purdy became the only quarterback in his first career start to beat a team led by Tom Brady, when the 49ers defeated the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 35‚Äì7.[46] Purdy finished the game with 185 passing yards and two passing touchdowns to go along with a two-yard rushing touchdown. After the game, the 49ers sent out a tweet dubbing Purdy \"Mr. Relevant\".[47][48][49] In the next game against the Seahawks, Purdy had 17-for-26 passing with 217 yards and two touchdowns, both to George Kittle, during the 21‚Äì13 victory as the 49ers clinched the NFC West.[50] Purdy became the second player in NFL history, after Aaron Rodgers, to record a cumulative total quarterback rating of 115 or greater in his first two starts.[51] During a Week 16 37‚Äì20 victory over the Washington Commanders, Purdy had 234 passing yards, two touchdowns, and an interception.[52][53] In the next game against the Las Vegas Raiders, he threw for 284 yards, two touchdowns, and an interception during the 37‚Äì34 overtime road victory.[54][55] On January 12, 2023, the NFL named Purdy as the National Football Conference (NFC)'s Rookie of the Month for December and January.[56] Purdy finished the regular season throwing for 1,374 yards for 13 touchdowns and four interceptions, winning all five of his starts and leading the 49ers to the second seed in the playoffs. Purdy's passer rating of 119.4 through his five starts is the highest for a quarterback in his first five starts since Kurt Warner in 1999.[57] He was named to the PFWA All-Rookie Team.[58] In the Wild Card Round against the Seahawks, Purdy became the first 49ers rookie quarterback to start and win a playoff game, while putting him 6‚Äì0 in career starts. During the 41‚Äì23 victory, he completed 18-of-30 passes for 332 yards and scored four total touchdowns (three passing, one rushing), the most by a rookie quarterback in a playoff game.[59] With this victory, Purdy also became the lowest-drafted quarterback to start and win a playoff game,[60] and became the first rookie quarterback since Sammy Baugh in 1937 to have at least 200 pass yards and two pass scores in a playoff win.[61] This also made Purdy the first rookie quarterback to do so since the AFL‚ÄìNFL merger. With the 49ers' subsequent 19‚Äì12 victory in the Divisional Round over the Dallas Cowboys, Purdy became the third quarterback since 1970 to win two playoff games in his rookie season. Although throwing no touchdowns in this game, Purdy completed 19-of-29 passes for 214 yards, which also made him the first rookie quarterback since 1970 to throw over 200 yards in consecutive NFL postseason games.[62] During the first quarter of the NFC Championship Game against the Philadelphia Eagles, Purdy suffered an injury to his right elbow. He was replaced by Josh Johnson.[63] Following Johnson's concussion in the third quarter, Purdy reentered the game,[64] though he would only throw two more passes; Purdy was primarily tasked with handing off the ball to his teammates. The 49ers would go on to lose on the road 31‚Äì7.[65] Purdy was diagnosed with a complete tear of his ulnar collateral ligament, which rendered him unable to throw the ball more than 10 yards.[66][67] After a successful recovery from injury, Purdy was named the starting quarterback to begin the 2023 season, over Sam Darnold, Brandon Allen, and Trey Lance, the lattermost later being traded to the Cowboys.[68] During the season-opening 30‚Äì7 road victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers, Purdy completed 19-of-29 passing attempts for 220 yards, two touchdowns (both to Brandon Aiyuk), and a passer rating of 111.3. With the 49ers' win and two touchdown passes on the day, Purdy became the first quarterback in NFL history to win his first six career regular season starts and throw at least two touchdown passes in each of those starts. With a passer rating of 111.3, Purdy also became the first quarterback in NFL history to register a passer rating of 95.0 or higher in each of his first six career regular-season starts.[69] Three weeks later the Arizona Cardinals, the 49ers won by a score of 35‚Äì16 with Purdy completing 20-of-21 passes for 283 yards and a touchdown, setting a new 49ers franchise record for highest single-game completion rate of 95.2%. The prior franchise record of 90% had been set by Steve Young in Week 8 of the 1991 season.[70] During a Week 5 42‚Äì10 victory over the Cowboys, Purdy completed 17-of-24 passes for 252 yards and four touchdowns. With this victory, Purdy became the fourth quarterback in NFL history (after Kurt Warner, Peyton Manning, and Tom Brady) to lead a team that scored 30 points or more in at least 8 consecutive regular season games.[71] The following week against the Cleveland Browns, Purdy suffered his first regular season loss after rookie kicker Jake Moody missed a 41-yard field goal as time expired in the fourth quarter. Purdy finished the narrow 19‚Äì17 road loss completing 12-of-27 passes for 125 yards, a touchdown, and an interception for a 55.3 passer rating.[72] Purdy entered concussion protocol following a Week 7 road loss to the Minnesota Vikings after experiencing symptoms on the flight home.[73] However, he was cleared in time for the next game against the Cincinnati Bengals, which the 49ers lost 31‚Äì17.[74][75] During a Week 10 34‚Äì3 road victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars, Purdy threw for 296 yards and three touchdowns, setting a new career record passer rating of 148.9. This was the third time in his NFL career that Purdy had thrown at least three touchdowns with a passer rating of 140 or more; the only other NFL quarterback to have done the same in his first two seasons is Kurt Warner.[76] In the next game against the Buccaneers, Purdy completed 21-of-25 passes for 333 yards and three touchdowns for a perfect passer rating of 158.3. This was the first time a 49ers quarterback achieved a perfect passer rating since Joe Montana in 1989,[77] and the only time a 49ers quarterback has accomplished that feat with 25 or more attempts in a game. Purdy was subsequently named the NFC Offensive Player of the Week[78] and FedEx Air NFL Player of the Week for his performance.[79] Two weeks later against the Eagles, Purdy completed 19-of-27 passes for 314 yards and four touchdowns as the 49ers won on the road 42‚Äì19.[80] He was again named FedEx Air NFL Player of the Week.[81] During a Week 14 28‚Äì16 victory over the Seahawks, Purdy threw for 368 yards and two touchdowns with a completion rate of 70.4%, and was named FedEx Air NFL Player of the Week for the second week in a row.[82] During a Week 15 45‚Äì29 road victory over the Cardinals, Purdy led the 49ers to a second consecutive NFC West title as he completed 16-of-25 passes for 245 yards and four touchdowns with a passer rating of 135.3.[83] Purdy left the game in the second quarter and was assessed in the medical tent for what head coach Kyle Shanahan believed was a head injury, but Purdy eventually returned to the game after the medical staff assessed that Purdy had a shoulder stinger. Backup quarterback Darnold substituted Purdy for three plays while he was in the medical tent.[84] In the next game against the Baltimore Ravens, Purdy completed 18-of-32 passes for 255 yards, no touchdowns, and four interceptions during the 33‚Äì19 loss.[85] His 255 passing yards allowed him to surpass 4,000 passing yards in a season, the first 49ers quarterback to do so since Jeff Garcia in 2000.[86] The following week against the Commanders, Purdy threw for 230 yards and two touchdowns as the 49ers won on the road 27‚Äì10, surpassing Garcia's franchise season passing yards record by two yards.[87] On January 3, 2024, Shanahan stated that Purdy would not play in the regular-season finale against the Los Angeles Rams.[88] Later that day, the NFL announced that Purdy had been selected as the NFC's starting quarterback for the 2024 Pro Bowl Games.[89] He completed the regular season leading the league in passer rating, total quarterback rating, and yards gained per attempt.[90] At home against the Green Bay Packers in the Divisional Round, Purdy struggled with accuracy in rainy conditions as the 49ers trailed entering the fourth quarter. Despite his struggles, Purdy engineered a 12-play, 69-yard drive that culminated with Christian McCaffrey scoring a go-ahead touchdown with under two minutes left as the 49ers won 24‚Äì21.[91] Purdy was 6-of-7 for 47 yards on the game-winning drive and finished the game completing 23 of his 39 passes for 252 yards and a touchdown.[92] In the NFC Championship Game against the Detroit Lions, Purdy only completed seven of his 15 pass attempts for 93 yards and an interception as San Francisco trailed 24‚Äì7 at halftime.[93] In the second half, Purdy completed 13-of-16 passes for 174 yards and a touchdown. He also scrambled for 49 rushing yards as he rallied the 49ers from a 17-point deficit at halftime to win 34‚Äì31, advancing to Super Bowl LVIII.[94] Purdy became the lowest drafted quarterback to start a Super Bowl.[95] In the Super Bowl, Purdy completed 23-of-38 passes for 255 yards and a touchdown in a 25‚Äì22 overtime loss to the Kansas City Chiefs.[96] In Week 5 against the Arizona Cardinals, Purdy made his 50th career touchdown pass after passing to George Kittle. He also became the fastest quarterback in 49ers franchise history to achieve 50 career touchdown passes.[98] Purdy is a devout Christian and openly talks about his faith.[99] Purdy has stated in press briefings and interviews that Christianity plays a major role in his life.[100] Purdy's favorite team as a youth was the Miami Dolphins, and he wears number 13 in honor of Dan Marino.[101] For his first two seasons in the NFL, Purdy lived with 49ers teammates Nick Zakelj and Alfredo Guti√©rrez.[2][102][103] Because he is a starter despite his draft status, Purdy has been nicknamed \"Mr. Relevant.\"[104][105] In July 2023, Purdy announced his engagement to girlfriend Jenna Brandt.[106] They married on March 9, 2024.[107]",

                "title": "Brock Purdy - Summer 2024 - Iowa Stater",
                "content": "Cyclone Power Written by Caleb Grizzle | Image by the San Francisco 49ers Brock Purdy, the winningest quarterback in Iowa State history, has risen to stardom in the NFL. Purdy‚Äôs (‚Äô21) humble beginnings and exciting play on the field have captured the hearts of football fans across the country. Everything that Iowa State has done for me has been so beautiful. They‚Äôve been so supportive. The people, the Iowa State Football program, it‚Äôs all been so unreal in terms of the support and the growth that I had while I was there. To go back and show love to everybody and my gratitude for them means a lot to me. My favorite part is the people, just because of how down-to-earth and real everyone is. Everyone wants to help each other out. There‚Äôs no selfishness. I don‚Äôt know what it is about the culture in Iowa, but everybody just loves one another authentically. And when you go back, you feel that every time. I think one is how I can love my wife really well. I‚Äôm learning more and more about marriage and the importance of that. Then my community: how I can serve and help the next generation of kids. And then, obviously, being intentional with my family and friends, and the relationships that I have with them. I think all those things are extremely important in terms of helping me be who I am as a person rather than just a football player. As you start to become more and more well known as an NFL player, people start to think that you‚Äôre on some other level in terms of not being human. And for me, I always keep it simple. I‚Äôm still a son. I‚Äôm a brother. I‚Äôm a husband. I‚Äôm a friend. I‚Äôm a teammate. I‚Äôm human, and I have flaws. I‚Äôm broken. I‚Äôm not the perfect human being that a lot of people may think. Being in the NFL now, I‚Äôve started to think, ‚ÄúPeople really do think that we‚Äôre perfect just because we‚Äôre on TV playing for an NFL team.‚Äù But at the end of the day, we‚Äôre human. I just try to keep it simple and remember that. That it‚Äôs a game. There‚Äôs a lot of hype and lead up to that game just during the week, and then all the glamor and fanciness that goes on before the game, at halftime, all of it. But, as I was dropping back and trying to convert a third down and score a touchdown, I was thinking, ‚ÄúThis is just a game.‚Äù It‚Äôs still four quarters. Obviously, it‚Äôs the last game of the year, and it‚Äôs on one of the biggest stages, but for me, it was another football game that I was playing in my life. My dad; he played Minor League Baseball for eight to nine years and never got to the big leagues. Growing up, he gave me everything. And I‚Äôm talking time. He coached me in the backyard and in little league and football, you name it. To be able to get to where I‚Äôm at today, from college to the NFL, playing in the Super Bowl, it‚Äôs pretty cool just because my dad is the one that lit and ignited that fire in me at a young age. He supported me all the way. He showed me how to live on and off the field. I‚Äôve always looked up to him, and I still look up to him. It means a lot to me. Growing up in Arizona, all I ever wanted was some good people around me, friends, and family, and no one ever wanted anything from me. They just loved me for who I was. And that was the same thing in Ames. As I started to play and have success and stuff in football, nobody really gravitated just to that. It was always who I was, and what I stand for is what they loved. And I appreciate that. It‚Äôs not all about me. It‚Äôs about how I can lay down my life and serve those around me both in Arizona and in Ames, Iowa. I feel like they‚Äôre very similar just in terms of the people that I‚Äôve surrounded myself with. I am very thankful for both communities. Going to Iowa State for four years and then leaving, you realize how special the place is: the people, the campus, the college town itself, the pride of being a Cyclone, it‚Äôs real. As I look back, I‚Äôm grateful for the people who invested their time in me and for the roots and relationships that I have there. When I go back, it‚Äôll always be the same ‚Äî the same love and the same gratitude. I‚Äôm proud to be a Cyclone. I‚Äôm thankful that I was able to be a part of growth on campus. I will always love Iowa State and the people in Ames.

I'll give you a moment. Paige announced the news during Monday's episode of her and Hannah Berner's podcast Giggly Squad (via Page Six), saying ‚ÄúCraig and I have decided to no longer be together.‚Äù She added that talking about the situation was ‚Äúweird,‚Äù and said ‚ÄúI love him, I think he loves me. I think we will remain friends. No one did anything. It wasn‚Äôt a bad thing. I think we both were just being really mature and saying what we want and what we didn‚Äôt want, and I think that‚Äôs extremely powerful to be able to voice how you‚Äôre feeling in real time and what you want for your future.‚Äù ‚ÄúI have so much love and respect for Craig,‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄúI think he is one of the best people I‚Äôve met in my entire life. I will remain the biggest fan for him and want the best for him, and he truly will get the best, because he is the best. But, with that said, I think it is the right decision for both of us.‚Äù Paige said the breakup was ‚Äúvery sad‚Äù and ‚Äúawkward‚Äù and shut down speculation that it was for ratings, saying ‚ÄúThe network has power, but they don‚Äôt have that much power. So, that was not a real thing. Rumors of us breaking up months ago again, also, not a real thing.‚Äù She added, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs definitely the best boyfriend I‚Äôve ever had, like, I can truly say that. He was a great boyfriend, and he did everything correct, and he never made me feel insecure or anything like that, so it almost is harder when no one‚Äôs done anything to be mad about, and that‚Äôs hard.‚Äù Cynthia Erivo & Lena Waithe's Full 'Ship Timeline Denzel Washington's Net Worth?

Watch Summer House on Bravo Wednesday, February 12 at 9/8c and next day on Peacock. Catch up on the Bravo app. The Summer House cast member confirmed the major life update on the December 30 episode of her and Hannah Berner's podcast, Giggly Squad. \"What I did want to say is that Craig and I have decided to no longer be together,\" she said. \"And I know I said I would never cry on the internet, but like it's OK if I cry on the pod[cast]. I feel like that's OK.\" See the ‚ÄúSanctuary‚Äù Craig Conover Built For Paige DeSorbo in His Backyard (VIDEO) Craig Conover Sets the Record Straight on Status with Paige: \"I'll Admit...\" Craig Conover Teases Future Business Moves With Paige DeSorbo: ‚ÄúExcited‚Äù (EXCLUSIVE) Paige said there wasn't one major thing that caused her split from the Sewing Down South founder. She admitted that she wasn't \"expecting\" to split from the Southern Charm cast member, but that she's gone through a lot of changes in the years since they first started dating. \"It's weird, obviously it's weird. Like, it's very weird. I wasn't expecting this, obviously, when we first started dating, like you don't think, 'Oh, what's going to happen? Will we get married, will we not? You just kind of are in this relationship, and as you get older ‚Äî I mean I started dating Craig when I was 29 and I'm 32 now,\" she said on the podcast. \"And your thirties, for women, really are very transformative, and you change a lot and you grow a lot, and him as well. Not to sound traditional and old-fashioned, but this is not a situation where I have a 50-part series of like, 'Who the f--k was I dating?' Like, could not be more opposite.\" Paige continued, \"I have so much love and respect for Craig. I think he is one of the best people I have ever met in my entire life. I will remain the biggest fan of him, and want the best for him. And he truly will get the best because he is the best. But, with that said, I think it is the right decision for both of us moving forward in our lives and the direction our lives are going in that we didn't foresee or whatever. It's a very sad thing...\" The fashionista noted that the two broke up a bit before the podcast announcement, but that they both took \"a little time\" to process the split \"in private\" with their loved ones before she went public with the news. She now has nothing but positive feelings towards her ex. \"I love him. I think he loves me. I think we will remain friends. No one did anything, it wasn't like a bad thing. I think we both were being mature and just saying what we want and what we didn't want,\" she concluded on the matter. \"And I think that's extremely powerful to be able to voice how you're feeling in real time and what you want for your future.\" Get news and updates about your favorite shows, plus 3 free credits to watch locked content.

                "title": "Missouri Tigers football - Wikipedia",
                "content": "The Missouri Tigers football program represents the University of Missouri (often referred to as Mizzou) in college football and competes in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). Missouri's football program dates back to 1890, and has appeared in 37 bowl games (including 11 New Year's Six bowl appearances: four Orange Bowls, four Cotton Bowls, two Sugar Bowls, and one Fiesta Bowl). Missouri has won 15 conference titles and 5 division titles. Entering the 2024 season, Missouri's all-time record is 711‚Äì590‚Äì52 (.545).[3] Since 2012, Missouri has been a member of the Southeastern Conference (SEC)[4] and competes in the Eastern Division. Home games are played at Faurot Field (\"The Zou\") in Columbia, Missouri, named for hall of fame coach Don Faurot. Hall of famer Gary Pinkel, coach from 2001 to 2015, has the most wins in Missouri football history, setting that mark with his 102nd win in the AT&T Cotton Bowl on January 3, 2014.[5] Pinkel's record with Mizzou after his final game on November 27, 2015, is 118‚Äì73 (.618). Since the 2020 football season, the team has been coached by Eliah Drinkwitz. The Missouri Tigers have 15 conference championships and five conference division titles.[6] The Tigers were selected as national champions by NCAA-designated major selectors in 1960 and 2007. Neither championship is claimed by the university.[7][8][9][10] [11] ‚Ä† The 1960 record was 10‚Äì1, but was later changed to 11‚Äì0 due to Kansas' subsequent forfeit [12] Missouri has won 15 conference championships. ‚Ä† Co-champions ‚Ä° The 1960 Big Eight title was retroactively awarded after a loss to Kansas was reversed due to Kansas' use of a player who was later ruled to be ineligible.[13][14] The Tigers were previously members of the Big 12 North division between its inception in 1996 and the dissolution of conference divisions within the Big 12 in 2011. The Tigers joined the SEC as members of the SEC East starting in 2012. Missouri has won five division championships. ‚Ä† Co-champion Missouri has appeared in 37 bowl games, including 11 New Year's Six bowl appearances: 4 Orange Bowls, 4 Cotton Bowls, 2 Sugar Bowls, and 1 Fiesta Bowl, with an all-time bowl record of 17‚Äì20.[15] The team also accepted a bid to the 2020 Music City Bowl against Iowa, which was subsequently canceled due to COVID-19.[16] Missouri's entire bowl history is shown in the table below.[17] Missouri and Arkansas first met in 1906 in Columbia, Missouri, and played each other five times prior to Missouri joining the SEC in 2012, and then becoming Arkansas' permanent cross-division rival in 2014. The annual meeting was dubbed the Battle Line Rivalry. On November 23, 2015, a new rivalry trophy was unveiled for the annual game.[18] Missouri leads the series 11-4 as of the conclusion of the 2023 season, which saw the Tigers beat Arkansas 48-14 in Fayetteville.[19] Oklahoma leads the series 67-25‚Äì5 through the 2024 season.[20] From 1940 through 1974, the teams played for the Tiger-Sooner Peace Pipe trophy. The rivalry was renewed in 2024, as the teams are members of the same conference again. Missouri won the 2024 matchup 30-23. [21] A new rivalry was started in 2012 when Missouri joined the SEC East. With both schools located in cities named Columbia (Columbia, Missouri, and Columbia, South Carolina), the mayors of the cities commemorate the winner with the \"Mayor's Cup\" trophy for the annual game.[22][23] Missouri leads the series 9-6 as of the conclusion of the 2024 edition of the rivalry.[24][25] The rivalry between Missouri and Illinois is modeled after the two schools' longstanding basketball rivalry, and it garners the most interest around St. Louis, with both schools having alumni and fans in the area. It has not been played annually, with 24 matchups occurring from 1896 to 2010, with Missouri leading the series 17‚Äì7.[26] Between 2000 and 2010, the schools met in St. Louis six times, with Missouri winning each time. In 2026, the series will be renewed for a four-year period, to be played on campus sites.[27] Missouri and Iowa State first met in 1896 and the regional rivalry was born. Before the 1959 match-up between the two schools, which took place in Ames, Iowa, field testing showed that the telephones the two schools used to communicate with their coaches in the coaches' box were wired so that either school could hear what was happening on the other sideline. The problem was fixed before the game, but neither of the two coaches knew that. Northwestern Bell Telephone Company of Ames then decided to have a trophy made to commemorate the incident, thus the Telephone Trophy was born.[28][29] When Missouri left the Big 12 for the SEC, the rivalry was essentially ended. Missouri leads the series with Iowa State 61‚Äì34‚Äì9 through the 2022 season.[30] Missouri leads the series with Kansas 57‚Äì54‚Äì9 through the 2021 season.[31] With history dating back to Bleeding Kansas in the 1850s, the \"Border War\" rivalry was well-known as one of the longest-lasting and fiercest rivalries in college sports. The teams met annually, traditionally for the final game of the regular season, from 1891 through 2011 when Missouri left the Big 12 for the SEC.[32] The series is set to renew in 2025.[33] Nebraska leads the series 65‚Äì36‚Äì3 through the 2022 season.[34] From 1892 through 2010, the teams played for the Victory Bell trophy. Missouri has 38 first-team All-American selections as of 2017, 14 of whom were consensus selections.[35]: 121‚Äì126 ‚Ä† Consensus selection Missouri has retired six jersey numbers representing seven players as of 2017.[35]: 119‚Äì120 Missouri has 15 inductees into the College Football Hall of Fame.[37] Two Missouri players have been enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame:[38] Truman the Tiger was introduced as the school's mascot against the Utah State Aggies in 1986, receiving his name from former president Harry S Truman. Truman has been named the \"Nation's Best Mascot\" three times since 1986, most recently in 2014.[39] The NCAA[40] as well as Jeopardy! and Trivial Pursuit[41] recognize the University of Missouri as the birthplace of Homecoming, an event which became a national tradition in college football. The history of the University of Missouri Homecoming can be traced back to the 1911 Kansas vs. Missouri football game, when the Missouri Tigers faced off against the Kansas Jayhawks in the first installment of the Border War rivalry series.[42][43] Now the Tigers nearly sell out Memorial Stadium every Homecoming, which is usually a home game in October. From 2012 to 2023, Missouri played in the East Division of the SEC and played each opponent in the division each year along with several teams from the West Division. The SEC will expand the conference to 16 teams and will eliminate its two divisions in 2024, causing a new scheduling format for the Tigers to play against the other members of the conference.[44] On March 20, 2024, the SEC announced that they would continue with 8 conference games for the 2025 season, and that each team would play their same conference opponents from the 2024 schedule, only with the host locations switched.[45] Announced schedules as of August 4, 2024.[46] Aug 30",

Attorney General Stuart Young said the country recorded 61 murders in December, bringing the year's total up to 623 homicides, an increase from 577 homicides recorded in 2023 and 599 in 2022. Young, speaking at a press conference in the capital Port of Spain, said the public emergency would not include a curfew or restrict people's movements, to minimize the economic impact of the declaration. The authorization for police to carry out searches and arrests without a warrant may be extended up to seven days by a judge, Young said. At the same press conference, Minister of National Security Fitzgerald Hinds called the spike in violent murders \"an epidemic\" for the country of 1.4 million residents, with 551 shootings recorded this year, as of December 26. Recent incidents of violence included a man shot and killed after leaving a police station in Port of Spain on Saturday, and a shooting in Laventille, Trinidad, on Sunday that killed five. A state of emergency had previously been declared for the same reason in 2011, but the application was limited to \"hotspots\" of crime.",

                "content": "Follow: Trinidad and Tobago has declared a state of emergency after a spate of killings over the weekend added to what was already an exceptionally deadly year for the Caribbean nation. Under emergency powers announced Monday by the office of the Prime Minister Keith Rowley, the police will be able to search people and premises without warrants, and detain suspects for up to 48 hours, in an effort to bring down what the leader has called an ‚Äúunacceptable high level of violent crime.‚Äù However, there will be no curfew. The authorization came after gun violence claimed several lives over the weekend, bringing the country‚Äôs murder toll for 2024 to 623 ‚Äì the highest level in police records dating back to 2013. Trinidad and Tobago, population 1.5 million, already has one of the highest murder rates in the Caribbean, along with Jamaica and Haiti, according to the US Government Accountability Office (GAO), while violent deaths in the region are nearly three times the global average. Related article Thousands of guns recovered from Caribbean crime scenes came from the US, says government report And police warn they expect the amount of gang-related violent crime involving powerful assault weapons to increase. Acting Attorney General Stuart Young told a briefing Monday there had been 61 homicides so far in the month of December alone. These included a shooting Saturday involving a high caliber automatic weapon outside a police station that killed one person and an incident less than 24 hours later that left five dead and one injured in the Port of Spain area. Minister of National Security Fitzgerald Hinds told the same briefing a further two people had been killed on Friday ‚Äì one in a gang-related incident, another in a ‚Äúdomestic situation‚Äù ‚Äì and 15 others killed in gun-related incidents since last Monday. Police were viewing the latest wave of incidents as an ‚Äúoutbreak of gang violence,‚Äù Hinds said, adding that the military would assist in enforcing the state of emergency. Attorney General Young added that the use of high-caliber firearms by criminal gangs had made the recent violence particularly concerning, leading to the state of emergency declaration. ‚ÄúThere is very little chance of survival due to the velocity and the caliber of these weapons. This has been a major concern not only for us here in Trinidad and Tobago, but throughout the whole CARICOM region,‚Äù he said, referring to the regional Caribbean Community group of nations. A significant amount of the country‚Äôs violent crime ‚Äì such as murder, assault and kidnapping ‚Äì is related to criminal gang activity and narcotics trafficking, according to the US State Department. In July, the US State Department set its travel advisory for Trinidad and Tobago to Level 3, advising US citizens to reconsider travel due to crime. ‚ÄúExercise increased caution in Trinidad and Tobago due to terrorism and kidnapping,‚Äù the travel advisory said. The attorney general said the government was in contact with the US, where many of the high-powered weapons come from, to discuss how to control the situation. While Caribbean countries do not manufacture firearms, more than 7,000 firearms were recovered from them between 2018 and 2022. Nearly three-quarters of those came from the US, according to GAO.

                "content": "Officials linked the state of emergency to the proliferation of illegal, high-powered firearms in the Caribbean nation. The Caribbean republic of Trinidad and Tobago has announced a state of emergency in response to a spike in gang violence over the weekend. The declaration grants police additional powers as they seek to tamp down on reprisal killings and other gang-related activity. ‚ÄúThe declaration and calling of a public state of emergency is something that is not taken lightly,‚Äù said acting Attorney General Stuart Young at a news conference on Monday. He explained that information from the Trinidad and Tobago police service ‚Äúdictated and mandated the necessity of this extreme action that we took this morning‚Äù. The state of emergency empowers the country‚Äôs police to arrest people ‚Äúon suspicion of involvement in illegal activities‚Äù. It will also allow law enforcement to ‚Äúsearch and enter both public and private premises‚Äù and suspend bail. A government statement specified that no curfew would be imposed, and the freedom to meet publicly or demonstrate in marches would not be impeded. Young indicated that an uptick in violence over the weekend in the capital, Port of Spain, helped prompt the emergency announcement in the early hours of Monday. ‚ÄúYou will recall that on Saturday, just after 3 o‚Äôclock in the afternoon outside the Besson Street police station, there was a shooting with the use of a high-calibre automatic weapon,‚Äù Young explained. Local media described the shooting as an ambush. A suspected gang leader, Calvin Lee, had arrived at the police station to sign the bail book, but as he and his entourage left, The Daily Express reported that gunmen emerged from a nearby van and began to fire. One person was killed. Lee himself managed to flee. But Young explained that the shooting led to reprisal killings between local gangs. Within 24 hours, he said, six people were fired upon in Laventille, a suburb of Port of Spain. Five of them were killed. Young said further reprisal attacks are still anticipated. ‚ÄúThere can be expected heightened reprisal activities by the criminal elements in and around certain places in Trinidad and Tobago that immediately warranted and took us out of what we can consider the norm,‚Äù he explained. He declined to name specific locations where gang activity may be concentrated. ‚ÄúBut I can say, throughout Trinidad and possibly Tobago, [criminal gangs] are likely to immediately increase their brazen acts of violence in reprisal shootings on a scale so extensive that it threatens persons and will endanger public safety.‚Äù Young added that the decision to invoke a state of emergency was in part a result of the high-calibre weapons being used in the attacks, which elevated the possibility of bystander deaths. He noted the involvement of AK-47 and AR-15 guns. ‚ÄúOver the last month or so, and in fact building up to this, the government has been concerned about the use of high-powered, illegal firearms ‚Äî high-calibre firearms including automatic weapons that unfortunately are a scourge throughout the whole Caribbean region,‚Äù Young said. Caribbean countries do not manufacture firearms themselves, and many of the guns used in gang violence have been illegally imported. One source in particular stands out: the United States. It is the largest weapons exporter in the world. In March, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute found that the US was the source of approximately 42 percent of global arms exports. A 2017 analysis from the Small Arms Survey also found that the US had the largest number of private guns per capita, with US civilians holding 40 percent of the world‚Äôs firearms. Guns from the US have been connected to crimes across the Caribbean, from Haiti and Jamaica to Trinidad and Tobago. The US has collaborated with 13 Caribbean countries to help disrupt the illegal firearms trade. Between 2018 and 2022, an estimated 7,399 firearms collected from crimes in the region have been sent to the US for origin tracing. In October, the US Government Accountability Office published a report with its findings. Of all the firearms retrieved and traced during that four-year period, a total of 5,399 ‚Äî or 73 percent ‚Äî originated from the US. A couple hundred more had ambiguous origins. The proliferation of illegal firearms has been linked to increased violence in the Caribbean. Trinidad and Tobago, for example, has been struggling with a record homicide rate. In December alone, there were 61 homicides, according to the government. The country tallied 623 homicides total so far for 2024. ‚ÄúGangs accounted for 263 of them,‚Äù MP Fitzgerald Hinds, the minister of national security, said during Monday‚Äôs news conference. ‚ÄúSo as a result, we consider that this declaration of a public emergency is to confront the criminals and to allow law enforcement easier access than ordinary to them, in light of the crises they have presented to this country.‚Äù Follow Al Jazeera English:",

At the same press conference, Minister of National Security Fitzgerald Hinds called the spike in violent murders \"an epidemic\" for the country of 1.4 million residents, with 551 shootings recorded this year, as of December 26. Recent incidents of violence included a man shot and killed after leaving a police station in Port of Spain on Saturday, and a shooting in Laventille, Trinidad, on Sunday that killed five. A state of emergency had previously been declared for the same reason in 2011, but the application was limited to \"hotspots\" of crime. (AFP) ¬© 2024 Copyright France 24 - All rights reserved.

Treasury's mission highlights its role as the steward of U.S. economic and financial systems, and as an influential participant in the world economy. The Treasury Department is the executive agency responsible for promoting economic prosperity and ensuring the financial security of the United States. The Department is responsible for a wide range of activities such as advising the President on economic and financial issues, encouraging sustainable economic growth, and fostering improved governance in financial institutions. The Department of the Treasury operates and maintains systems that are critical to the nation's financial infrastructure, such as the production of coin and currency, the disbursement of payments to the American public, revenue collection, and the borrowing of funds necessary to run the federal government. The Department works with other federal agencies, foreign governments, and international financial institutions to encourage global economic growth, raise standards of living, and to the extent possible, predict and prevent economic and financial crises. The Treasury Department also performs a critical and far-reaching role in enhancing national security by implementing economic sanctions against foreign threats to the U.S., identifying and targeting the financial support networks of national security threats, and improving the safeguards of our financial systems. The Department of the Treasury is organized into two major components, the Departmental offices and the operating bureaus. The Departmental Offices are primarily responsible for the formulation of policy and management of the Department as a whole, while the operating bureaus carry out the specific operations assigned to the Department. Our bureaus make up 98% of the Treasury work force. The basic functions of the Department of the Treasury include:",

                "title": "Aurora - 30 Minute Forecast | NOAA / NWS Space Weather Prediction Center",
                "content": "Space Weather Prediction Center National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Northern Hemisphere Southern Hemisphere This is a short-term forecast of the location and intensity of the aurora. This product is based on the OVATION model and provides a 30 to 90 minute forecast of the location and intensity of the aurora. The forecast lead time is the time it takes for the solar wind to travel from the L1 observation point to Earth. The two maps show the North and South poles of Earth respectively. The brightness and location of the aurora is typically shown as a green oval centered on Earth‚Äôs magnetic pole. The green ovals turn red when the aurora is forecasted to be more intense. The sunlit side of Earth is indicated by the lighter blue of the ocean and the lighter color of the continents. Aurora can often be observed somewhere on Earth from just after sunset or just before sunrise. The aurora is not visible during daylight hours. The aurora does not need to be directly overhead but can be observed from as much as a 1000 km away when the aurora is bright and if conditions are right. The aurora is an indicator of the current geomagnetic storm conditions and provides situational awareness for a number of technologies. The aurora directly impacts HF radio communication and GPS/GNSS satellite navigation. It is closely related to the ground-induced currents that impact electric power transmission. For many people, the aurora is a beautiful nighttime phenomenon that is worth traveling to arctic regions just to observe. It is the only way for most people to actually experience space weather. These links provide a discussion of the aurora phenomena and tips for the best opportunities to view aurora at various locations around the world. The OVATION (Oval Variation, Assessment, Tracking, Intensity, and Online Nowcasting) model is an empirical model of the intensity of the aurora developed at the Johns Hopkins University, Applied Physics Laboratory by Patrick Newell and co-workers1. The model uses the solar wind velocity and interplanetary magnetic field measured at the L1 orbit position at 1.6 million km (1 million miles) upstream from earth as input and calculates three types of electron precipitation and the proton precipitation which strongly correlate with the aurora. An estimate of aurora viewing probability can be derived by assuming a linear relationship to the intensity of the aurora. This relationship was validated by comparison with data from the Ultraviolet imager (UVI) instrument on the NASA Polar satellite(2). On occasion, the input solar wind data are either contaminated or unavailable. In those instances, an alternative estimate of the solar wind forcing, based on the current Kp geomagnetic index is used to drive the OVATION model. When this occurs, there is no forecast lead time. For more information on the OVATION model and aurora products, see: In 2009, Newell et. al., developed the OVATION model. In 2011, NOAA (NCEI and SWPC) developed a real-time version of the OVATION model to forecast the location and intensity of the aurora. Machol and Redmon (NCEI) developed the real-time ovation model. Viereck (SWPC) implemented the model and developed the graphical products to run in realtime to create aurora forecasts. In 2013, Newell upgraded the OVATION Prime model so that it would more accurately capture large geomagnetic storms. The original model, based solely on DMSP data, was only reliable to Kp of 7. By adding data from the NASA TIMED GUVI instrument, Newell et al., were able to expand the model to include the larger storm values of Kp of 8 and 9. In 2016, NOAA SWPC shared the operational OVATION code (written in IDL) with the UK Met Office in the UK. The UK Met Office converted the OVATION model from IDL to Python. In 2020, NOAA SWPC implemented the new version of the OVATION Prime model into operations. This version has been dubbed OVATION 2020. The Auroral Forecast product is based on the OVATION Prime model developed by P. Newell at the Johns Hopkins, Applied Physics Laboratory.

Source: Space Weather Prediction Center Click here to submit a form with your additional feedback There is always some aurora at some place on Earth; however, the sky must be dark and at least partially clear in order for the aurora to be visible. When the flow of particles known as the solar wind is calm, the aurora might only be occurring at very high latitudes and appear faint, but nevertheless, there is still aurora. Sunlight and clouds are the biggest obstacles to observing this elusive phenomenon. The best places to view aurora are high northern latitudes during the winter in northern Europe, Asia and North America. To see the aurora you need a mostly clear and dark sky. During very large auroral events, the aurora may be seen at lower latitudes throughout the world, but these are rare. During an extreme event in May 2024, the aurora borealis was visible as far south as India, Morocco and Mexico and the aurora australis as far north as Perth, Australia, Argentina, and Namibia. During average activity levels, auroral displays will be overhead at high northern or southern latitudes. Places like Fairbanks, Alaska; Dawson City, Yukon; Yellowknife, NWT; Churchill, Manitoba; the southern tip of Greenland; Reykjavik, Iceland; Troms√∏, Norway; and the northern coast of Siberia all offer a good chance to view the aurora overhead. At lower latitudes, you might be able to see aurora on the northern horizon when activity picks up a little. In the southern hemisphere, the aurora has to be fairly active before it can be seen from places other than Antarctica. Hobart, Tasmania and the southern tip of New Zealand have about the same chance of seeing aurora as Vancouver, B.C., South Dakota, Michigan, Scotland, or St. Petersburg, Russia. Fairly strong auroral activity is required for aurora viewing in those locations. Although aurora occurs throughout the night, the best time to watch for the aurora is the three or four hours centered around midnight. Active auroral displays tend to be more diffuse and fragmented later in the night, which means that 9 p.m. to 3 a.m. is typically the time period with higher probability of seeing spectacular auroral displays over interior Alaska in winter. Since clear sky and darkness are both essential to see aurora, the best time is determined by the weather and by the sunrise and sunset times. Moonlight may also affect aurora viewing. When the moon is full or close to full, the added ambient light may prevent you from seeing dim auroral features. However, this same effect also may enhance their colors. The bright moon activates more color and detail-sensitive cone cells in your eyes. In contrast, rods are photoreceptor cells that work well in the dark, but only produce images in black and white and with low levels of detail. Moonlight provides cone cells with the right amount of light to ‚Äúturn on‚Äù so you can see colors in the aurora. When the aurora becomes very bright, even with no moon you may see colors in the aurora. For photography enthusiasts, third-quarter or new moon phases are best. The aurora in the sky can shine on the ground and produce interesting reflections that get ‚Äúwashed out‚Äù when the moon is more full. Note: In the Arctic, the first-quarter moon does not set below the horizon, while the third-quarter moon does not rise. Partially clear skies are a requirement (the clearer the sky, the more aurora that can be seen), so you should try to choose a location and a season that has the clearest skies. Statistically, the continental locations in Russia, Alaska and western Canada under the auroral zone have the clearest skies, and in the spring, the skies of Iceland and Scandinavia are usually clear. Furthermore, there is a quite strong (but poorly understood) tendency for auroral activity to be more intense around fall and spring equinox compared to summer and winter solstice known as the ‚ÄúRussell-McPherron effect.‚Äù This means that the statistical likelihood of seeing aurora over Interior Alaska is roughly twice as high on the equinox as it is at solstice. With these factors combined, aurora viewing may be best in locations with clear skies and around the spring (March) or fall (September) equinox. Sunlight prevents viewing the aurora during the summer at high latitudes. The skies at night are simply too bright as the sun climbs in the sky until the June 21 solstice and then descends. (If active, aurora can generally be seen after civil twilight. See day length in your viewing location). Here in Fairbanks, at about latitude 64.8, our aurora viewing ‚Äúseason‚Äù is roughly August 21 to April 21. The odds are in your favor between those dates: if the weather is clear and you stay for at least three nights, it‚Äôs highly likely (though never certain!) that you will see the aurora. Although the sun does set to varying degrees in Fairbanks between April 22 and August 20, the sky doesn‚Äôt get dark enough to see the aurora even if it was a spectacular display. Note: There are two ‚Äúshoulder seasons,‚Äù one for some time after April 21 and the other for some time before August 20, where the skies are dark enough to potentially see aurora for very brief periods of time during twilight. However, when scheduling your aurora viewing travel, we recommend avoiding these shoulder seasons and visiting between August 21 and April 21. The number of sunspots on the sun's surface changes on a fairly regular cycle, which scientists refer to as the sun's 11-year cycle variation. Sunspot activity tends to peak every 11 years. This peak is called the solar maximum. The last solar maximum was in 2014; the next is expected in winter 2024-25. Auroral activity tends to peak slightly after the solar maximum by around one year. Like the transitions between summer and winter seasons on Earth, the sun‚Äôs activity cycle takes time to ascend to solar maximum and decline to solar minimum. Although the chances of seeing the aurora at lower latitudes increase when the sunspot cycle is at a maximum, aurora viewing at higher latitudes is not as dependent on the solar maximum because the auroral oval is normally present. View solar cycle progression here For specific information on accommodations, tour companies, etc., we suggest www.explorefairbanks.com. People who live in Fairbanks are accustomed to spectacular views of the aurora borealis. Many residents routinely stay up late to photograph this phenomenon or simply to experience the widely different forms it takes with each new display. Some people view the aurora from their homes, but many travel away from the city lights for the most spectacular views. Visitors to Fairbanks should plan to watch from a hill away from city lights with a clear view of the horizon, since the aurora can occur in any part of the sky. During solar activity maximum years, many auroral substorms start south of Fairbanks. During years of minimum solar activity, many auroral substorms start north of Fairbanks and occur in the midnight hours. Although trees make good foreground subjects in auroral photographs, too many of them can limit the full experience of the aurora, so photographers may want to search out a location with a clear view of the northern horizon. Another concern for visitors is the extremely cold winter weather. In those conditions, small problems may become disasters in remote areas. If you are aurora hunting at cold temperatures, please be prepared! Visit this page for tips on safely enjoying the winter season. Recommended aurora viewing sites around Fairbanks include: The aurora is a luminous glow frequently seen around the geomagnetic poles of the northern (aurora borealis) and southern (aurora australis) hemispheres. The light is caused by collisions between electrically charged particles streaming from outer space that enter Earth‚Äôs atmosphere and collide with molecules and atoms of gas (primarily oxygen and nitrogen). When the electrons and protons from the sun collide with gases in the Earth‚Äôs atmosphere, the atmospheric particles (or gases) gain energy. To return to their normal state, they release that energy in the form of light. The principle is similar to what happens in a neon light: electricity runs through the light fixture to excite the neon gas inside, and when the neon is excited, it gives off a brilliant light. The dancing lights of the aurora are seen around the magnetic poles of the northern and southern hemispheres because the electrons from the sun travel along magnetic field lines in the Earth‚Äôs magnetosphere. The magnetosphere is the extension of Earth‚Äôs magnetic field into a vast, comet-shaped bubble around our planet that acts as a sort of protective shield against space weather. The magnetosphere works to deflect and funnel particles from the solar wind into the space environment surrounding our planet. The ‚Äúweak points‚Äù of our protective magnetic shield are over the poles where field lines converge. Many particles end up funneled over these areas with some penetrating into the upper atmosphere and colliding with other atoms or molecules to produce aurora light. The two figures below show the locations with the most frequent occurrences of aurora borealis (left) and aurora australis (right) during the period of best viewing around the middle of the night. The ‚Äúquiet‚Äù state of the aurora is on average a thin oval band situated around 67-68 degrees in geomagnetic latitude. Under quiet solar wind conditions, the aurora will most likely occur inside the region shown with the auroral oval, and if you travel to these regions during dark and clear conditions and stay for 3-7 days, you will most likely see the aurora. These auroral ovals can expand when geomagnetic activity is enhanced, bringing sightings of aurora to lower latitudes. This three-day forecast and many other sites, including the NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC), rely on the Kp index as an indicator of the auroral oval size. Inside the auroral oval, however, Kp is less relevant, since even when global activity is low, auroral activity can be high. The composition and density of the atmosphere and the altitude of the collisions determine the colors. The aurora is most often seen as a striking green, but it also occasionally shows off other colors, ranging from red to pink or blue to purple. Oxygen at about 60 miles up gives off the familiar green-yellow color, while oxygen at higher altitudes (about 200 miles above Earth‚Äôs surface) gives all-red auroras. Nitrogen in different forms produces the blue light. Purple occurs when nitrogen at higher altitudes mixes with the red auroral emissions from oxygen. Within a small layer between the red and green aurora, it is possible to even see orange! Cameras have different sensitivities to colors than the human eye; therefore, there is often more red aurora in photos than you can see with the unaided eye. Just like sunlight, which appears to be white, is a blend of the colors of the rainbow, the aurora is also a mixture of colors. The overall impression is a greenish-whitish glow. Since there is more oxygen at high altitudes, the red aurora tends to be on top of the regular green aurora. Very intense aurora often has a purple rim at the bottom. The purple results from a mixture of blue and red emissions from nitrogen molecules. The bottom edge of the aurora is typically about 60 miles (100 kilometers) above the surface of the Earth. The top of the visible aurora peters out at about 120 to 200 miles (200 to 300 kilometers), but sometimes aurora can be seen as high as 500 miles (800 kilometers). Viewing angle also impacts what one sees when aurora gazing; see the image below (courtesy of Aurorasaurus). Auroral forms can be divided into broad categories based on activity level and the viewer's perspective. At its least active, the auroral curtain forms diffuse, glowing streaks hanging quietly in the sky. This form has no distinct structure. When the aurora becomes slightly more active, vertical stripes or striations, called rays, form. These are actually fine pleats in the auroral curtain. The auroral curtain sometimes appears to touch a distant mountain top or even rise like smoke. This illusion occurs because you are seeing a several-hundred mile long aurora near the horizon where perspective gives the illusion that it is touching the ground. The aurora may appear as rays shooting out in all directions from a single point in the sky. This dramatic form occurs when you are directly beneath the swirls and folds of an active curtain. The rays are actually hundreds of miles long and perspective makes them appear to converge. The best answer is ‚ÄúMaybe.‚Äù It is easy to say that the aurora makes no audible sound. The upper atmosphere is too thin to carry sound waves, and the aurora is so far away that it would take a sound wave five minutes to travel from an overhead aurora to the ground. But many people claim that they hear something at the same time when there is aurora in the sky. We are aware of only one case where a microphone has been able to detect audible sound associated with aurora (visit Auroral Acoustics: the web site does not have sound samples, but you'll find a link to an in-depth paper and recent news on this topic). The sound is often described as whistling, hissing, bristling or swooshing. Some even describe it like sizzling bacon on a pan. What gives people the sensation of hearing sound during auroral displays is an unanswered question. By searching for an answer to that question, we will probably learn more about the brain and how sensory perception works than about the aurora. Scientists can predict when and where there will be aurora, but with less confidence than they can predict the regular weather. The ultimate energy source for the aurora is the solar wind. When the solar wind is calm, there tends to be minimal aurora; when the solar wind is strong and perturbed, there is a chance of intense aurora. The sun turns on its own axis once every 27 days, so an active region that produced perturbations which resulted in aurora might again cause aurora 27 days later. The solar wind takes approximately three days to get to the Earth on its way from the sun. Observing the sun and predicting perturbations in the solar wind resulting from events taking place on the sun (such as flares or coronal mass ejections) provides information in a few days in advance of possible auroral displays. Spacecraft such as the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) and Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) provide researchers with data on activity occurring on the surface of the sun as well as in the solar magnetic field. Another source of data used to predict the aurora comes from satellites located approximately 90 minutes or 1,500,000 km away from Earth. The Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) and Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) Real-Time Solar Wind satellites provide real-time data to researchers about geomagnetic storms. Data from these satellites provide about one to two hours warning of conditions that may cause enhanced auroral displays. Streams of charged particles that produce the aurora come from the corona, the outermost layer of the sun's atmosphere. The corona is exceedingly hot, measuring more than two million degrees Fahrenheit. The high temperature causes hydrogen atoms to split into protons and electrons, and the resulting gas of charged particles is called plasma, which is electrically conductive. The solar plasma is so hot that it breaks free of the sun's gravitational force and blows away from the surface in all directions. The movement of this plasma is called solar wind. The intensity of the solar wind and the magnetic field carried by it change constantly. When the solar wind blows more strongly, we see more active and brighter aurora on Earth. The Kp number is a numeric scale that describes geomagnetic activity. The number is computed by averaging the magnetic activity from around eight stations around the world every three hours. The metric ranges from 0 to 9 (with 0 being calm, 1 very weak, and all the way up to 9, which would represent an extreme geomagnetic storm). On average, there are only one or two extreme geomagnetic storms per solar cycle (~11 years). Anything above a Kp 5 is classified as a geomagnetic storm. The Kp index was introduced by a German scientist named Julius Bartels in 1939. The abbreviation Kp comes from the German \"Kennziffer Planetarische,\" which translates loosely as ‚Äúplanetary index number,‚Äù although it is better known in English as simply the planetary index, and is usually designated as Kp (number from 0-9). Can the Kp forecast the aurora in Fairbanks? Yes and no. Kp index is derived from 3-hour averages of observations from equatorial magnetometer stations to characterize global magnetic activity. When global geomagnetic activity is higher, the likelihood of seeing aurora increases globally. However, local conditions could be quite different from global activity. That's why scientists divide geomagnetic activity into two categories: geomagnetic storms and substorms. Auroral phenomena are more closely related to substorms, which are used to define the almost nightly occurrences of auroral activity. Aurora chasers use local magnetometer measurements (like our GIMA chain), aurora cameras (like our Poker Flat DASC; see under ‚ÄúLive Cameras‚Äù on this page), models like OVATION, or reports from social media or sites like Aurorasaurus for more accurate, real-time information. Magnetometers provide a quantitative view of the level of geomagnetic disturbance occurring. A sudden steep change (i.e., tens or hundreds of nanotesla) in the magnetometer data is usually an indicator that an extended period (0.5 hours or more) of active aurora is beginning. This is especially true just before midnight. Scientists also find it helpful to see the time history of the magnetometer trace, since other indicators, like the all-sky camera, only show current conditions. Visit the magnetometer monitor for a chart of the current conditions, and view the all-sky camera at Poker Flat Research Range (65.13¬∞ N, 147.49¬∞ W) to see aurora occurring northeast of Fairbanks, Alaska. The Poker Flat camera and others are linked on this page under the ‚ÄúLive Cameras‚Äù section. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) OVATION is updated every 5 minutes. The animation shows auroral activity that occurred over the Northern Hemisphere in the last 24 hours. The animation is in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC); fast forward to the last few seconds of the animation to see what is predicted for the next 30 minutes. The model depicts a day/night terminator showing what areas of the world are sunlit and what areas are in darkness. Auroras cannot be seen during the daytime. Remote sensing spacecraft monitor the sun for indications of eruptions that eject solar material towards the Earth, or regions where continuous high-speed streams of material are escaping and heading earthward. In either case, the travel time to Earth for such material leaving the sun is 1 to 3 days. This allows relatively accurate forecasts to be made on these look-ahead time scales. Just as Earth rotates on its axis and makes a complete rotation every 24 hours, the sun spins on an axis and makes one complete rotation every ~27 days. Coronal holes on the sun allow solar material to flow out at high speeds. When these holes on the sun are facing Earth, we may experience enhanced auroral displays, among other effects. As the sun rotates, these coronal holes and other active regions result in high-speed streams of plasma that are likely to reoccur every 27 days until the phenomena dissipate; therefore, if there is high auroral activity today, it‚Äôs possible that there will be high auroral activity again in 27 days. This 27-day period is known as the Carrington Rotation. Since it was established by an Act of Congress in 1946, scientists at the Geophysical Institute have studied geophysical processes from the center of the Earth to the surface of the sun and beyond, turning data and observations into information useful for state, Arctic and national priorities.

                "title": "Ring in 2025 Watching a Geomagnetic Storm That Makes Aurora Borealis More Visible - Newsweek",
                "content": "Forecasters from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Space Weather Prediction Center say that geomagnetic storms could result in some parts of the U.S. ringing in the new year under the northern lights. The northern lights, or aurora borealis, are typically visible in far northern regions within 1,550 miles of the North Pole. While the colorful phenomena is regularly expected in Alaska, it is usually a rare sight in other parts of the U.S. Geomagnetic storms earlier this year resulted in the aurora being visible to large and unlikely areas of the contiguous U.S. on more than one occasion, with sightings of the lights as far south as Florida. A NOAA forecast explains that \"a G3 (Strong) geomagnetic storm watch is in effect for 31 Dec, with a G1 (Minor) watch for 1 Jan,\" due to an expected \"pair of Earth-directed coronal mass ejections (CME).\" \"We will not know the true potential of geomagnetic disturbance levels of response until the CME(s) arrive 1 million miles from Earth (when they will be about 30-60 minutes from reaching our planet) and their structure and intensity can be measured by our solar wind observatories - NOAA DSCOVR and NASA ACE spacecraft,\" the forecast states. \"Also, neither CME is expected to be a direct hit, which also makes forecast of intensity more difficult,\" it adds. NOAA is predicting that the northern lights could be viewable on New Year's Eve over a smaller part of the U.S. than the sightings earlier this year, though it may be seen by residents of states that border Canada. Forecast maps shared by the Space Weather Prediction Center show parts of more than a dozen northern states highlighted with a low-to-medium likelihood of being in the \"aurora viewline\" from December 30 to New Year's Day. While it is not certain that the northern lights will be viewable in any of the lower 48 states over New Year's, they might be seen in parts of the following states: Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Illinois, Michigan, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine. Lieutenant Bryan Brasher, project manager for NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center, told Newsweek via email that auroras \"are caused by the interaction between solar wind and Earth's magnetic field which itself is disturbed by the solar wind.\" \"Our primary mission, however, focuses on protecting critical infrastructure and essential services, like power grids, satellites, communication and navigation networks, aviation and human spaceflight, all which can be negatively affected by space weather,\" Brasher said. \"While auroras provide a fantastic opportunity to engage the public, they are generally benign and not our primary focus.\" While forecasters can predict the likelihood of an aurora being viewable in different areas, the phenomena cannot be predicted with total accuracy days or even hours in advance. Residents of states that could experience the northern lights on New Year's Eve can check a tool on the Space Weather Prediction Center website that provides a forecast for \"where the aurora will be in the next few minutes\" about 30 minutes in advance.

                "content": "Space weather describes changing environmental conditions in near-Earth space. Magnetic fields, radiation, particles and matter, which have been ejected from the Sun, can interact with the Earth‚Äôs upper atmosphere and surrounding magnetic field to produce a variety of effects. Learn more about Space Weather Different aspects of space weather have a variety of impacts on mankind and the technology we use. The Met Office Space Weather Operations Centre (MOSWOC) uses numbered scales developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). These scales are similar to those used to describe hurricanes or earthquakes and are used worldwide to classify space weather conditions and communicate the impact on people and systems. We have developed a UK-specific impact scale to use in forecasts, alerts and warnings based on the 2013 Royal Academy of Engineering report on the impacts of extreme space weather on engineered systems and infrastructures specific to the UK. You can see the scales below for three different types of space weather: The ionosphere is a dynamic part of the upper atmosphere which acts as a reflector for long-range, high-frequency communications (HF comms). During a solar flare, the increase in radiation from the sun causes the ionosphere to absorb rather than reflect signals, disrupting communications systems on the sunlit side of the Earth. The sun may also emit radio bursts at multiple wavelengths causing various problems for communication and navigation systems. Even during periods of quiet solar activity, turbulence in the ionosphere can result in a scattering of electromagnetic waves disrupting navigation systems like Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) or Global Positioning System (GPS) and radio bands up to the GHz frequencies. These are referred to as radio blackouts. Navigation: Low-frequency navigation signals used by maritime and general aviation systems experience outages on the sunlit side of the Earth for many hours, causing a loss in positioning. Increased satellite navigation errors in positioning for several hours on the sunlit side of the Earth, which may spread into the night side. (2 x 10-3) Navigation: Outages of low-frequency navigation signals cause an increased error in the positioning of satellite navigation possible on the sun side of Earth. (10-3) (8 days per cycle) Navigation: Low-frequency navigation signals degraded for about an hour. (10-4) (140 days per cycle) Navigation: Low-frequency navigation signals degraded of about an hour. (5 x 10-5) (300 days per cycle) Navigation: Low-frequency navigation signals degraded for brief intervals. (10-5) (950 days per cycle) Geomagnetic storms are large disturbances in the Earth's magnetic field caused by changes in the solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) structure. These changes in the solar wind arise from disturbances on the sun, such as in powerful coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Their effect can be felt for a number of days. With the right magnetic configuration, and increases in solar wind speed and density, large amounts of energy can be transferred into the Earth's geomagnetic system. The effect of geomagnetic storms can result in impacts to power systems, spacecraft operations and other communication. Spacecraft operations: May experience extensive surface charging, drag may increase on low-Earth-orbit satellites, problems with orientation, uplink/downlink and tracking satellites. Other systems: HF (high-frequency) radio communication may be impossible in many areas for one to two days. GNSS (GPS) satellite navigation may be degraded for days with possible effects on infrastructure reliant on GSS (GPS) for positioning or timing. Low-frequency radio navigation can be out for hours, and aurora may be seen across the whole of the UK. Spacecraft operations: May experience extensive surface charging, drag may increase on low-Earth-orbit satellites, problems with orientation, uplink/downlink and tracking satellites. Other systems: Pipeline currents can reach hundreds of amps. HF (high-frequency) radio propagation may be impossible in many areas for one to two days. Satellite navigation may be degraded for days. Low-frequency radio navigation can be out for hours, and aurora has been seen as low as Florida and southern Texas (typically 40-degree geomagnetic lat).*** (4 days per cycle) Spacecraft operations: May experience surface charging and tracking problems, drag may increase on low-Earth-orbit satellites, corrections may be needed for orientation problems.

Other systems: HF radio propagation can fade at higher latitudes, and aurora has been seen as low as New York and Idaho (typically 55-degree geomagnetic lat).*** (360 days per cycle) Spacecraft operations: Minor impact on satellite operations possible. Other systems: Aurora may be seen as low as Northern Scotland. Spacecraft operations: Minor impact on satellite operations possible. Other systems: Migratory animals are affected at this and higher levels; aurora is commonly visible at high latitudes (northern Michigan and Maine).*** (900 days per cycle) In association with large solar flares, solar radiation storms may also occur. These storms, consisting of very high energy protons, primarily impact polar regions. This is called polar cap absorption, and their main effect is to degrade HF comms in these regions. In space, astronauts and satellites can be exposed to increased levels of radiation. While extra-vehicular activity (spacewalks) can be avoided during a solar storm, satellites could be exposed to excessive and damaging radiation levels. For instance, solar panels can be degraded (reducing the life expectancy of the satellite), surface charging can damage the electronics and radiation can result in errors within computer systems. Although the atmosphere provides a significant level of protection, charging and radiation from space weather events have been shown to impact ground-based systems occasionally. Similarly, aircraft, crews and passengers on high latitude polar routes may, on very rare occasions, be exposed to elevated radiation levels. Spacecraft operations: Some satellites may suffer temporary outages due to memory impacts, which can cause loss of control, serious noise in image data or orientation problems and permanent damage to solar panels. Aircraft operations: Some aircraft electronic systems may experience single events effects (SEE) which can cause upsets or unexpected behaviour. The rate of SEE depends on the flight path and the detailed storm characteristics. **** Satellite operations: Satellites may be rendered useless, memory impacts can cause loss of control, may cause serious noise in image data, star-trackers may be unable to locate sources; permanent damage to solar panels possible.

Aircraft operations: Unlikely to have an effect. **** Satellite operations: None. Aircraft operations: Minor impacts on HF radio in the polar region.*** The Met Office issues a number of different types of notifications triggered by space weather activity. These notifications fall into the following categories: The auroral oval is likely to remain at background levels initially. However, from 31 Dec, a Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) is forecast to arrive at Earth with a risk of G1-G2/Minor-Moderate geomagnetic storms which could produce visible aurora across Scotland, Northern Ireland and parts of northern England. Slight chance of a G3/Strong storm. The auroral oval is likely to remain at background levels initially. However, from 31 Dec, a Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) is forecast to arrive at Earth with a risk of G1-G2/Minor-Moderate geomagnetic storms which could produce visible aurora up to 55S, but any views will likely be limited by the short hours of darkness. Slight chance of a G3/Strong storm. Issued at: 02:11 (UTC) on Tue 31 Dec 2024 Solar Activity: High, with strong flare observed from the large complex region in the northwest of the disc at 30/0414 UTC with frequent Moderate-class flares throughout. There has also been evidence of some flaring from beyond the eastern limb. There are currently ten sunspot regions on the visible disc. The region in the northwest that produced the peak flare is the largest and most active region but has been relatively stable in terms of growth over the last 24 hours. Further complex groups lie in the southeast and the central northern hemisphere. The remaining regions are all relatively simple or only slowly evolving. Numerous coronal mass ejections (CMEs) have been observed leaving the disc over the past 24 hours. However, these mostly considered to have been far-sided. However, a filament eruption (arc of plasma) was observed in imagery within the vicinity of a sunspot region located in the southeast quadrant. This produced a partial halo CME, which has been analysed as potentially being Earth-directed, with an expected arrival at Earth on Day 1 (31 Dec). Another partial halo emerged shortly after 29/1800UTC, again from the southeast and is likely to have an Earth-directed element arriving on Day 2 (01 Jan). Although it appears to be rather faint compared to the previous event, with less material expected. Solar Wind / Geomagnetic Activity: Solar winds showed a slow regime. The total magnetic field strength has been weak. The north-south component of the magnetic field has also varied generally weakly. Geomagnetic activity was Quiet throughout (Kp 0-2). Energetic Particles / Solar Radiation: High energy proton flux (greater than 10MeV) at GOES18 remained at background levels throughout, well below the 1-pfu S1/Minor Radiation Storm threshold. Solar Activity: Generally Moderate solar activity is expected with frequent Moderate-class flares forecast through the period, with a chance of isolated Strong-class flares, especially from AR3936 in the northwest. Solar Wind / Geomagnetic Activity: No coronal hole fast winds currently feature in the forecast. A partial halo CME observed in imagery looks to be associated with an Moderate-class flare and a filament eruption near the vicinity of a sunspot region located in the southeast quadrant of the disc at around 29/0440UTC. This event has been analysed as Earth-directed, which is expected to arrive at Earth on Day 1 (31 Dec). A second, slower partial halo CME was observed from a sunspot region in the southeast later on 29 Dec, with the potential to reach Earth on Day 2 (01 Jan), however little material is expected with this second CME. Geomagnetic activity is expected to be mainly Quiet. The aforementioned Earth-directed CMEs arriving on Days 1-2 (31 Dec- 01 Jan) are likely to enhance geomagnetic activity, reaching G1-G2 Minor/Moderate storm, with a slight chance of G3/Strong storm. Any CME effects gradually waning into Day 3 (02 Jan), back towards Quiet to Unsettled conditions. Energetic Particles / Solar Radiation: There is a slight chance of S1/Minor Radiation Storm enhancements during the period, should any significant flares occur from the larger regions on the disc as they rotate into the western hemisphere. Issued at: 00:34 (UTC) on Tue 31 Dec 2024 This channel highlights the outer atmosphere of the Sun - called the corona - as well as hot flare plasma. Hot active regions, solar flares, and coronal mass ejections will appear bright here. The dark areas - called coronal holes - are places where very little radiation is emitted, yet are the main source of solar wind particles. Issued at: 23:59 (UTC) on Tue 26 Nov 2024 This channel is especially good at showing areas where cooler dense plumes of plasma (filaments and prominences) are located above the visible surface of the Sun. Many of these features either can't be seen or appear as dark lines in the other channels. The bright areas show places where the plasma has a high density.

                "content": "Troy Kenneth Aikman (born November 21, 1966)[1][2] is an American former professional football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 12 seasons with the Dallas Cowboys. After transferring from the Oklahoma Sooners, he played college football for the UCLA Bruins and won the Davey O'Brien Award as a senior. Aikman was selected first overall by the Cowboys in the 1989 NFL draft, went to six Pro Bowls, and won three Super Bowls. He was also named MVP of Super Bowl XXVII, the franchise's first title in over a decade. Aikman was inducted to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2006[1] and the College Football Hall of Fame in 2008. After retiring in 2000, Aikman served as the color commentator of NFL on Fox from 2001 to 2021 and has served as the color commentator of Monday Night Football since 2022. He and his partner play-by-play announcer Joe Buck are the longest tenured announcer pairing in NFL history.[3] Aikman was also a co-owner of the now defunct NASCAR Sprint Cup Series team Hall of Fame Racing from 2005 to 2009, along with fellow former Cowboys quarterback Roger Staubach, and is a part-owner of the San Diego Padres in Major League Baseball (MLB).[4][5] Aikman was born on November 21, 1966. He spent the first part of his childhood in Cerritos, California. At age 12, Aikman's family moved to Henryetta, Oklahoma, where he played football and baseball at Henryetta High School, and earned All-State honors.[6] Aikman also won the 1983 Oklahoma high school state championship in typing.[7][8] The New York Mets offered Aikman a contract out of high school, but instead of playing baseball he chose to pursue football and attended the University of Oklahoma under head coach Barry Switzer.[9] In 1984, he became the first freshman to start at quarterback for Oklahoma since World War II. In 1985, his first full season as a collegiate starter,[9] Aikman led the Sooners to victories over Minnesota, Kansas State, and No. 17 Texas in the Red River Shootout before losing to the Miami Hurricanes as he left the game with a broken ankle. He also lost to his future teammate Michael Irvin and head coach Jimmy Johnson, who had also scouted him when he was the head coach of Oklahoma State.[10] On October 19, Miami's Jerome Brown broke through the offensive line, sacked Aikman at the Sooners' 29-yard line, and broke Aikman's ankle. Aikman, who had been six of eight passing for 131 yards, would be out for the season. Switzer and offensive coordinator Jim Donnan were forced to switch back to the wishbone offense under freshman quarterback Jamelle Holieway. The team went on to win the 1985 National Championship. With Holieway established as the starting quarterback at OU, Aikman decided to transfer to UCLA.[11] Barry Switzer oversaw Aikman's transfer to UCLA, which was coached by Terry Donahue and more effective for a passing quarterback. He had to sit out a year due to college transfer rules but went on to lead the Bruins to a 20‚Äì4 record over two seasons.[9][11] As a junior, Aikman was named Pac-10 Offensive Player of the Year, throwing for 2,525 yards, 17 touchdowns, and 8 interceptions. He led the Bruins to a 10‚Äì2 record and the 1987 Aloha Bowl, where they beat the Florida Gators by a score of 20‚Äì16.[9][12][13] As a senior, Aikman threw for 2,771 yards, 24 touchdowns, and 9 interceptions. He won the 1988 Davey O'Brien Award as the nation's top quarterback, a first for UCLA.[9] He was a Consensus All-American, the UPI West Coast Player of the Year, the Washington DC Club QB of the Year, a finalist for the 1988 AFCA \"Coaches Choice\" Player of the year award, and finished third in voting for the 1988 Heisman Trophy. UCLA matched the victory total from the previous season under Aikman, going 10‚Äì2 and losing only to USC and Washington State. The 1988 season culminated with a 17‚Äì3 Bruins victory over the Arkansas Razorbacks in the 1989 Cotton Bowl Classic, which was played in Dallas.[9] The Dallas media spent most of the Cotton Bowl Classic week promoting Aikman as the \"next quarterback of the Cowboys,\" and much was made of Cowboys head coach Tom Landry watching Aikman practice during the Bruins' workouts at Texas Stadium. Aikman finished his career as the number two career passing leader in UCLA history.[12][13] In 2008, Aikman was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame.[14] On November 28, 2014, UCLA retired his #8 jersey at halftime against Stanford.[15][16] Aikman was selected as the first overall pick in the 1989 NFL draft by the Dallas Cowboys.[9] On February 25, 1989, new owner Jerry Jones fired Tom Landry and replaced him with Jimmy Johnson. A few months later, in the NFL's supplemental draft, Johnson drafted Steve Walsh, who played for Johnson at the University of Miami. Aikman won the starting quarterback job, and Walsh was traded early in the 1990 season. Aikman played his first NFL preseason game on August 26, 1989, against the Denver Broncos. His NFL debut started with a 28‚Äì0 loss to the New Orleans Saints. The following week, Aikman threw his first touchdown pass, a 65-yard completion to Michael Irvin, but the Atlanta Falcons intercepted two passes and won. In a game against the Phoenix Cardinals, he threw for 379 yards to set an NFL rookie record.[9] Aikman finished 1989 with a 0‚Äì11 record as a starter, completing 155 of 293 passes for 1,749 yards, 9 touchdowns, and 18 interceptions. Following Aikman's rookie season, Dallas selected Florida Gators running back Emmitt Smith in the first round of the 1990 NFL draft. With Smith and Irvin, Aikman led the Cowboys to a 7‚Äì7 record in the 1990 season but was injured in the 15th game, against the Philadelphia Eagles. The Cowboys would go on to lose that game and the following week against the Atlanta Falcons with backup quarterback Babe Laufenberg, missing the final playoff wild card spot by one game. In 1991, Aikman led the Cowboys to a 6‚Äì4 record in the first 10 games and had the Cowboys ahead in week 12 against an undefeated Washington Redskins team when he was injured. Steve Beuerlein replaced Aikman, and Dallas finished the season 5‚Äì0 and earned the #5 playoff seed. Beuerlein went on to lead the Cowboys to a road upset over the #4 seed Chicago Bears in the wild card round. With the Cowboys trailing 17‚Äì6 at halftime the following week against the Detroit Lions in the NFC Divisional Playoff game, Aikman was inserted to start the third quarter but was unable to provide a spark as the Cowboys lost, 38‚Äì6. Aikman was selected to the first of six consecutive Pro Bowls.[9] In 1992, Aikman set career highs in completions (302), passing yards (3,445), and touchdown passes (23), and led the Cowboys to a team record 13 regular-season victories and the second-best record in the NFC. During the playoffs, Aikman broke Joe Montana's record of 83 passes without an interception by throwing 89.[9] The Cowboys defeated the Philadelphia Eagles at home in the divisional round and squared off against the San Francisco 49ers in the NFC Championship, a matchup that featured the two best teams in the NFC. The Cowboys won, 30‚Äì20, with Aikman completing two game-changing passes to send the Cowboys to their first Super Bowl appearance since 1978. In Super Bowl XXVII against the Buffalo Bills, Aikman led the Cowboys to a 52‚Äì17 victory (coincidentally the game was played in his alma mater's home stadium, the Rose Bowl).[9] Aikman was named Super Bowl MVP after completing 22 of 30 passes for 273 yards and 4 touchdowns.[9] In 1993, the Cowboys finished 12‚Äì4, the best record in the NFC. In the playoffs, Aikman again led the Cowboys to a home playoff win, this time over a young, upstart Green Bay Packers squad led by quarterback Brett Favre, who was in his first full season as a starting quarterback. Aikman then shredded the San Francisco 49ers secondary in the NFC Championship 38‚Äì21, before leaving the game with a concussion after 49ers defensive tackle Dana Stubblefield's knee hit Aikman's head.[19] Aikman now says he has no memory of playing in the game.[20][21] In Super Bowl XXVIII, Aikman was kept out of the end zone, but a combination of key turnovers by the Buffalo Bills offense and the running of Emmitt Smith helped lead to a 30‚Äì13 victory for the Cowboys. Head coach Jimmy Johnson left the team on March 29, 1994, and Jerry Jones hired Barry Switzer, Aikman's former college coach at Oklahoma. In 1994, the Cowboys finished with the second-best record in the NFC (behind the San Francisco 49ers) and Aikman again missed playing time due to injuries. The Cowboys won their Divisional Playoff game against the Green Bay Packers 35‚Äì9, but fell to the 49ers in the NFC Championship, 38‚Äì28. In 1995, Aikman passed for over 3,300 yards as the Cowboys once again finished with the best record in the NFC, with the 49ers having the second-best record. Aikman was knocked out of a highly anticipated rematch between the Cowboys and the San Francisco 49ers when Stubblefield landed on Aikman, forcing his knee to hit the turf. After a playoff loss at home by the 49ers to the Green Bay Packers, the Cowboys faced the Packers in the NFC Championship and, for the third straight season, knocked the Packers out of the playoffs, this time by a 38‚Äì27 score, to earn their third Super Bowl appearance in four years. The Cowboys won Super Bowl XXX against the Pittsburgh Steelers 27‚Äì17, with Aikman throwing one touchdown pass. In 1996, despite offensive troubles, Aikman again helped lead the Cowboys to another NFC East Division title and a home game in the wild card round, a 40‚Äì15 win over the Minnesota Vikings. The following week, the Cowboys fell in the divisional round to the Carolina Panthers, 26‚Äì17. In 1997, Aikman became the first quarterback in Cowboys history to have three straight 3,000-yard seasons, but the team finished 6‚Äì10 and missed the playoffs for the first time since 1990. Switzer suffered the first losing season of his career and resigned at the end of the season. 1998 was a rebound year for Aikman and the Cowboys, and despite missing five games, Aikman again helped lead the Cowboys back to the NFC East title and the playoffs. The Cowboys were upset at home in the wild card round as the #6 seed Arizona Cardinals won, 20‚Äì7. The 1999 season started off strong for Aikman and the Cowboys as they faced the Washington Redskins. Aikman threw a career-high five touchdown passes, including the game-winner in overtime to beat the Redskins. 1999 also marked the final playoff appearance for Aikman, and the final season the trio of Aikman, Irvin, and Emmitt Smith would play together. The Cowboys finished 8‚Äì8 and lost in the wild card round to the Minnesota Vikings, 27‚Äì10. The 2000 season was Aikman's final season as a professional football player. Aikman suffered several concussions during the season, and a revolving door at quarterback took place between Aikman and former Eagles quarterback Randall Cunningham. Aikman's final game was at home against the Washington Redskins. He was hit by linebacker LaVar Arrington and suffered the tenth and final concussion of his career. During the 2001 offseason, Aikman was waived a day before he was due a $70 million/7-year contract extension, and ultimately announced his retirement on April 9, after failing to find another team. He ended his career as the Cowboys' all-time leading passer (32,942 yards). 90 of his 94 career wins were in the 1990s and the most of any quarterback in any decade until Peyton Manning surpassed him in the 2000s with 115 wins. Presently, Aikman is third on that list, also trailing Tom Brady (122 in the 2010s).[9][22] During a late December 2013 radio interview, Aikman said the real reason he retired was due to persistent back issues he had in his final season. Aikman explained that he had back surgery in the offseason following Super Bowl XXVII with no complications but by the time he reached his final season he was constantly getting treatment for back pain. While the hit by Arrington ended his 2000 season, he claims it was the back pain and not that concussion that ended his career.[23] In a January 2020 interview, Aikman said he wanted to sign with the San Diego Chargers after being released by the Cowboys in the 2001 offseason to play for Norv Turner (Aikman's former offensive coordinator in Dallas), but they signed Doug Flutie instead and Aikman chose to retire. He said Andy Reid called him after Eagles starting quarterback Donovan McNabb suffered a broken ankle in week 11 of the 2002 season to offer him the starting position, but Aikman declined. In 2003, Aikman agreed to play for the Miami Dolphins with Turner as their offensive coordinator and began training again, but the team decided not to sign a contract with him.[24] After he retired from professional football as a player, Aikman joined Fox's NFC telecasts as a color commentator for the 2001 season. A year later, he was named to the network's lead announcing crew, teaming with Joe Buck and (from 2002 to 2004) Cris Collinsworth.[25] Aikman received an Emmy Award nomination for his television work in 2004 and has helped broadcast six Super Bowls (XXXIX, XLII, XLV, XLVIII, LI, and LIV) to date. It was revealed in 2016 that in 2004, Aikman nearly came out of retirement to sign a one-year deal with the Miami Dolphins, but the Dolphins ended up not signing him. Aikman also hosts a weekly sports radio show which airs on Thursday from 7 to 8 p.m. ET on Sporting News Radio and appears weekly during the football season on the Dunham & Miller morning show on Dallas sports talk radio station 1310 The Ticket. He was a public spokesman for Acme Brick throughout his career. He is also the chairman of the Troy Aikman Foundation, a charity to benefit children that has recently focused on building playplaces for children's hospitals.[26] In 2016, Aikman merged his foundation with the United Way Foundation of Metropolitan Dallas and donated $1 million to United Way in the process.[27] The Agency Sports Management & Marketing handles Aikman's marketing activities, where Jordan Bazant is his lead agent. Aikman, who in 1999 was ranked No. 95 on The Sporting News' list of the 100 Greatest Football Players, has been the official Wingstop spokesman for several years.[28] He appeared in The Simpsons episode \"Sunday, Cruddy Sunday\" alongside former Miami Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino. He also participated in the 2001 and 2011 videos honoring Billy Graham's 83rd and 93rd birthdays. Aikman said he was going to appear on Dancing with the Stars in front of TMZ cameras.[29][30] However, he revealed he was only joking about it and won't appear on the show.[31][29][30] On September 19, 2005, at halftime of the Dallas Cowboys-Washington Redskins game (broadcast on Monday Night Football), Aikman was inducted into the Dallas Cowboys Ring of Honor with his longtime teammates Michael Irvin and Emmitt Smith. On August 5, 2006, Aikman was one of six players inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. At another halftime ceremony, on February 7, 2009, at the UCLA-Notre Dame basketball game, Aikman's induction into the College Hall of Fame was honored. Aikman announced he had completed coursework to finish his degree in sociology. He participated in UCLA's 2009 Sociology Department commencement ceremony with current quarterback Kevin Craft and former linebacker Marcus Reece, who also came back to finish his college education. Former UCLA quarterback John Sciarra was the keynote speaker at the ceremony.[32] On February 9, 2010, Aikman became a member of the National Football Foundation Board of Directors. As of fall 2010, Aikman is a co-spokesman for Rent-a-Center, along with Hulk Hogan. In the fall of 2011, Aikman joined the Oxford Preparatory Academy Charter School Advisory Board in Southern California. In November 2013, Aikman was named a 2014 recipient of the NCAA Silver Anniversary Award, given annually to six former college athletes 25 years after the end of their college athletics careers.[33] In March 2014, Aikman was announced as a partner and spokesman for IDLife. Before a 2020 NFL broadcast between the Packers and Buccaneers in Tampa, Aikman and his partner Joe Buck were caught on a hot mic questioning the necessity of a military flyover when only 15,000 fans were allowed in Raymond James Stadium for the game. Aikman most notably said \"That's a lot of jet fuel just to do a little flyover\" and \"That stuff ain't happening with a Kamala-Biden ticket, I'll tell you that right now, partner.\" An Armed Forces spokesperson later said there is no additional cost to conduct the flyovers. Meanwhile, Buck and Aikman faced accusations of being unpatriotic.[34][35] After 20 seasons as Fox's lead broadcast team, ESPN announced on March 16, 2022, that both Buck and Aikman would join the network as the new lead commentators of Monday Night Football.[36][37] In late 2005, Aikman together with another former Cowboys quarterback, Roger Staubach, established a NASCAR team known as Hall of Fame Racing, fielding the No. 96 car (derived by multiplying Aikman's jersey number as a Dallas Cowboy by Staubach's) shared between Terry Labonte and Tony Raines during the 2006 NASCAR Nextel Cup Series. Raines drove for Hall of Fame full-time in 2007, and J. J. Yeley and Brad Coleman drove the car in 2008. The team closed after the 2009 season.[38] Aikman has owned several car dealerships in the Dallas‚ÄìFort Worth area and launched a light beer brand called Eight in 2022.[39][40] Aikman was once named the most eligible bachelor in Dallas by Texas Monthly, and dated country singer Lorrie Morgan.[41] He married former Cowboys publicist Rhonda Worthey on April 8, 2000, in Plano, Texas.[42] Worthey has a daughter named Rachel from a previous marriage. Worthey and Aikman have two daughters.[43] The couple announced their separation on January 24, 2011.[44] Their divorce was finalized on April 12, 2011.[45] On June 2, 2017, Aikman announced his engagement to high-end fashion retailer Catherine \"Capa\" Mooty[46] on Instagram.[47] Mooty has two sons with her ex-husband, lawyer Jerry Mooty,[48] who is the nephew of Cowboys owner Jerry Jones.[49] On September 1, 2017, Aikman and Catherine Mooty married at the Biltmore Four Seasons in Montecito, California.[50] However, it was revealed in July 2023 that Aikman and Mooty were officially divorced.[51] Aikman resides in Dallas.[52]",

                "content": "Editions: En/nfl/dallas-cowboys Aikman on Cowboys culture during his glory days Troy Aikman, a name synonymous with the Dallas Cowboys' 1990s dynasty, is more than a Hall of Fame quarterback-he's a Texas legend. Leading the Cowboys to three Super Bowl titles, Aikman embodied a high standard of dedication and leadership. These days, as a commentator and a staple on Dallas's Sportsradio 96.7 FM, he offers his perspective on everything from game strategies to the unique \"culture\" he experienced in his Cowboys years. Aikman recently weighed in on the challenges the Cowboys face today, comparing the team's distractions and focus to those during his tenure. Reflecting on his early years, Aikman admitted that when he first arrived in Dallas, the culture was anything but stable. \"It was pretty rough, and rough really through much of the second year,\" he said. Things changed when the team started winning, shifting the team culture toward a \"winning culture,\" according to Aikman. The Cowboys' legendary owner, Jerry Jones, brought big changes himself, risking everything to buy the team in 1989. Aikman pointed out Jones's core strength as a promoter: \"Look at it 30 years later... what the valuation is of the Cowboys and what he's accomplished.\" The dynamic between Jimmy Johnson, the coach who led the Cowboys to those Super Bowls, and Jones was pivotal. According to Aikman, Jones and Johnson originally had a clear division of labor: \"Jimmy would handle the football side of things, Jerry would handle the financial side of things,\" he recalled. But as Jones gained confidence in his own football knowledge, those boundaries blurred, especially after Johnson left. Jones's vision for the Cowboys went beyond just winning games; it was about creating an iconic brand with unrivaled access for fans. \"For most of those people that do take those tours,\" Aikman said, \"that's as close as they're ever going to get to the Dallas Cowboys.\" Jones's enthusiasm for expanding the Cowboys' brand went hand-in-hand with his decision to add luxury boxes and stadium tours, something that intensified after Johnson's departure. \"Jerry started taking seats out, putting in luxury boxes,\" Aikman remembered. Over the years, this approach has only \"continued to escalate,\" creating a balance between football success and the Cowboys' immense popularity off the field. Jones's approach may occasionally raise questions about the team's focus, but as Aikman puts it, Jones is deeply passionate about making the Cowboys accessible: \"He wants people to be able to feel it and touch it.\" ¬© Unidad Editorial Informaci√≥n Deportiva, S.L.U.

                "content": "DallasCowboys.com Staff Writer FRISCO, Texas ‚Äî Troy Aikman had his fair share of criticism and hard times as quarterback of the Dallas Cowboys, both in the beginning and in the end of his career, so he can, on some level, relate to what Dak Prescott is up against as the face of the most scrutinized and criticized franchise in all of sports. Aikman, a former first-overall pick in 1989, fell out of the gate to a record of 0-11 as a rookie, and suffered a combined record of 14-24 over his first three seasons. Needless to say, he was then labeled by many outside of the building as anything but the Chosen One, only to prove them all wrong in Year 4 and beyond ‚Äî ultimately leading the Cowboys to three Super Bowl wins via a Hall of Fame career. Prescott, a former fourth-round pick entering his ninth year, is still working to overcome the postseason obstacle, but Aikman hasn't written the three-time Pro Bowler off. \"I still believe in Dak,\" said Aikman, speaking at an event honoring the City of Dallas for being recognized as the No. 1 Sports Business City by Sports Business Journal. \"I feel like until you do it, there are always those criticisms. Peyton Manning heard that his first three years ‚Äî he didn't win a playoff game ‚Äî and then you look back at it now and you can't imagine anybody would question whether or not he could win a playoff game.\" Prescott and the Cowboys have taken the NFC East crown in two of the last three seasons to go along with a regular season record of 36-15, but they're also now 1-2 in the tournament that followed. Their loss to the Green Bay Packers was as demoralizing as you'll see, and the accountability can be spread nearly evenly across the board ‚Äî offense, defense, special teams and coaching ‚Äî raising questions on if Prescott, who produced an MVP-frontrunner season before the wheels came off of the offense in January, can end the Super Bowl drought that extends back to Aikman's days in the driver's seat. \"I do know that we all draw on our past experiences,\" said Aikman. \"And when we don't have great experiences, then those become hard to overcome, and I think that's the challenge for Dak. The question for him, and really for the team, isn't so much what happens in the regular season but rather how you play once you get into the postseason. That makes for a long year when that's the way it works. \"And I've been there as well, as far as when the expectations are high. ‚Ä¶ The Cowboys have been through that earlier in their franchise history, so the pressure gets higher, for sure, as they go into this offseason and next season. It makes it hard to come back and put themselves in position to do it all over again.\" And therein lies the added rub, because Prescott isn't getting any younger and there is currently no extension being inked for head coach Mike McCarthy, along with the reality that the NFL is a business of attrition and, as such, roster turnover on an annual basis becomes an added challenge to the ultimate goal. \"It's hard in this league to keep the [proverbial window] open,\" Aikman added. He's not wrong, and the onus is on all involved to right the ship next season, but not simply between the months of September and December, because that is now expected, which means it will not be the bar for which success or failure is measured in 2024. A deep playoff run will be, and nothing short of that will silence Prescott's, or Cowboys' critics. The 20 Questions series concludes with a forecast into the upcoming season and what the realistic expectations should be. As the 20 Questions series nears the end, we focus on Dak Prescott and what it will take for him to have an MVP season in 2024. With training camp starting this week, here are at least five of the bigger storylines to watch as the Cowboys get ready to invade Oxnard on Tuesday. In his five seasons at South Dakota, Brock Mogensen became one of the most productive FCS linebackers in the nation and a player who hasn't missed a start in four years. The 20 Questions series nears the end and we focus on Micah Parsons and his role in Mike Zimmer's defense. The Cowboys not only want to excel in their games in Texas, but have to thrive on the East Coast. For rookie Josh DeBerry, his unique experience includes him doing both. As we continue the 20 Questions series, the focus shifts to CeeDee Lamb. Once he gets on the field, what should we expect after his record-setting 2023 season? The Cowboys beefed up the middle of the defense over the offseason with multiple linebacker additions including undrafted tackling machine Jason Johnson out of UCF. As Mike McCarthy enters Year 5 with the Cowboys, the questions surrounding this team are more than ever. Today, the writers are asked what McCarthy's biggest challenge is heading into the 2024 season. There aren't many starting spots truly up for grabs at the start of camp but center appears to be one of them. The Cowboys have at least two, maybe three players who could start Week 1 at Cleveland. Get ready for the upcoming 2024 season with the Cowboys' official Training Camp Preview, your comprehensive source for scouting reports, position breakdowns and more. Going from being a high-priority undrafted free agent to making an impact in his first training camp will be a challenge, but one the Dallas Cowboys believe Corey Crooms can take on. ¬©2024 Dallas Cowboys.

                "title": "Jimmy Carter - Wikipedia",
                "content": "James Earl Carter Jr. (October 1, 1924 ‚Äì December 29, 2024) was the 39th president of the United States, serving from 1977 to 1981. A member of the Democratic Party, he was the longest-lived U.S. president and the first to reach 100 years of age. Born and raised in Plains, Georgia, Carter graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1946 and joined the U.S. Navy's submarine service. He returned home after his military service to revive his family's peanut-growing business before beginning a career in Georgia politics, where he supported the civil rights movement as State Senator and later Governor. Carter won the 1976 Democratic presidential nomination as a dark horse candidate before defeating incumbent president Gerald Ford of the Republican Party in the 1976 election. Carter pardoned Vietnam War draft evaders on his second day in office and successfully pursued the Camp David Accords, the Panama Canal Treaties, and the second round of Strategic Arms Limitation Talks. His administration established the US departments of Energy and Education. The end of his presidency was marked by the Iran hostage crisis, an energy crisis, and the end of d√©tente after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan (leading to a grain embargo, the declaration of the Carter Doctrine, and the 1980 Moscow Olympics boycott). Carter defeated a primary challenge from Ted Kennedy in the 1980 Democratic primaries, but lost the general election to Republican Ronald Reagan. After leaving the presidency, Carter established the Carter Center, with the goal of advancing human rights and alleviating human suffering. The Carter center has advocated monitored elections, and provided treatment for neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) The Carter Center has become the driving force behind several major deworming and disease eradication efforts, including the campaign to end dracunculiasis (with Carter's final wish being to see the last guinea worm die before him). Carter's post-presidency writings include political memoirs, commentary on global affairs, and books of poetry. Historians have given mixed ratings to Carter's presidency, but more favorably view his post-presidency period, which was the longest in U.S. history. James Earl Carter Jr. was born October 1, 1924, in Plains, Georgia, at the Wise Sanitarium, where his mother worked as a registered nurse.[1] Carter thus became the first American president born in a hospital.[2] He was the eldest child of Bessie Lillian Gordy and James Earl Carter Sr., and a descendant of English immigrant Thomas Carter, who settled in the Colony of Virginia in 1635.[3][4] In Georgia, numerous generations of Carters worked as cotton farmers.[5] Plains was a boomtown of 600 people at the time of Carter's birth. His father was a successful local businessman who ran a general store and was an investor in farmland.[6] Carter's father had previously served as a reserve second lieutenant in the U.S. Army Quartermaster Corps during World War I.[6] During Carter's infancy, his family moved several times, settling on a dirt road in nearby Archery, which was almost entirely populated by impoverished African American families.[2][7] His family eventually had three more children, Gloria, Ruth, and Billy.[8] Carter got along well with his parents, even though his mother was often absent during his childhood, since she worked long hours, and although his father was staunchly pro-segregation, he allowed Jimmy to befriend the black farmhands' children.[9] Carter was an enterprising teenager who was given his own acre of Earl's farmland, where he grew, packaged, and sold peanuts.[10] Carter also rented out a section of tenant housing that he had purchased.[2] Carter attended Plains High School from 1937 to 1941, graduating from the eleventh grade, since the school did not have a twelfth grade.[11] By that time, Archery and Plains had been impoverished by the Great Depression, but the family benefited from New Deal farming subsidies, and Carter's father took a position as a community leader.[10][12] Carter was a diligent student with a fondness for reading.[13] A popular anecdote holds that he was passed over for valedictorian after he and his friends skipped school to venture downtown in a hot rod. Carter's truancy was mentioned in a local newspaper, although it is not clear he would have otherwise been valedictorian.[14] As an adolescent, Carter played on the Plains High School basketball team, and also joined Future Farmers of America, which helped him develop a lifelong interest in woodworking.[14] Carter had long dreamed of attending the United States Naval Academy.[10] In 1941, he started undergraduate coursework in engineering at Georgia Southwestern College in nearby Americus, Georgia.[15] The next year, Carter transferred to the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, where civil rights icon Blake Van Leer was president.[16] While at Georgia Tech, Carter took part in the Reserve Officers' Training Corps.[17] In 1943, he received an appointment to the Naval Academy from U.S. Representative Stephen Pace, and Carter graduated with a Bachelor of Science in 1946.[18][17] He was a good student, but was seen as reserved and quiet, in contrast to the academy's culture of aggressive hazing of freshmen.[19] While at the Academy, Carter fell in love with Rosalynn Smith, a friend of his sister Ruth.[20] The two wed shortly after his graduation in 1946, and were married until her death on November 19, 2023.[21][22] Carter was a sprint football player for the Navy Midshipmen.[23] He graduated 60th out of 821 midshipmen in the class of 1947[a] with a Bachelor of Science degree and was commissioned as an ensign.[25] From 1946 to 1953, the Carters lived in Virginia, Hawaii, Connecticut, New York, and California, during his deployments in the Atlantic and Pacific fleets.[26] In 1948, he began officer training for submarine duty and served aboard USS Pomfret.[27] Carter was promoted to lieutenant junior grade in 1949, and his service aboard Pomfret included a simulated war patrol to the western Pacific and Chinese coast from January to March of that year.[28] In 1951, Carter was assigned to the diesel/electric USS K-1 (SSK-1), qualified for command, and served in several positions, to include executive officer.[29] In 1952, Carter began an association with the Navy's fledgling nuclear submarine program, led by then-Captain Hyman G. Rickover.[30] Rickover had high standards and demands for his men and machines, and Carter later said that, next to his parents, Rickover had the greatest influence on his life.[31] Carter was sent to the Naval Reactors Branch of the Atomic Energy Commission in Washington, D.C., for three-month temporary duty, while Rosalynn moved with their children to Schenectady, New York.[32] On December 12, 1952, an accident with the experimental NRX reactor at Atomic Energy of Canada's Chalk River Laboratories caused a partial meltdown, resulting in millions of liters of radioactive water flooding the reactor building's basement. This left the reactor's core ruined.[33] Carter was ordered to Chalk River to lead a U.S. maintenance crew that joined other American and Canadian service personnel to assist in the shutdown of the reactor.[34] The painstaking process required each team member to don protective gear and be lowered individually into the reactor for 90 seconds at a time, limiting their exposure to radioactivity while they disassembled the crippled reactor. When Carter was lowered in, his job was simply to turn a single screw.[35] During and after his presidency, Carter said that his experience at Chalk River had shaped his views on atomic energy and led him to cease the development of a neutron bomb.[36] In March 1953, Carter began a six-month course in nuclear power plant operation at Union College in Schenectady.[26] His intent was to eventually work aboard USS Seawolf, which was intended to be the second U.S. nuclear submarine.[37] His plans changed when his father died of pancreatic cancer in July, two months before construction of Seawolf began, and Carter obtained a release from active duty so he could take over the family peanut business.[38][39] Deciding to leave Schenectady proved difficult, as Rosalynn had grown comfortable with their life there.[40][41] She later said that returning to small-town life in Plains seemed \"a monumental step backward.\"[42] Carter left active duty on October 9, 1953.[43][44] He served in the inactive Navy Reserve until 1961 and left the service with the rank of lieutenant.[45] Carter's awards include the American Campaign Medal, World War II Victory Medal, China Service Medal, and National Defense Service Medal.[46] As a submarine officer, he also earned the \"dolphin\" badge.[47] After debt settlements and division of his father's estate among its heirs, Jimmy inherited comparatively little.[48] For a year, he, Rosalynn, and their three sons lived in public housing in Plains.[b] Carter was knowledgeable in scientific and technological subjects, and he set out to expand the family's peanut-growing business.[50] Transitioning from the Navy to farming was difficult as his first-year harvest failed due to a drought, and Carter had to open several bank lines of credit to keep the farm afloat.[51] Meanwhile, he took classes and studied agriculture while Rosalynn learned accounting to manage the business's books.[52] Though they barely broke even the first year, the Carters grew the business and became quite successful.[49][52] As racial tension inflamed in Plains by the 1954 Supreme Court of the United States ruling in Brown v. Board of Education,[53] Carter favored racial tolerance and integration but often kept those feelings to himself to avoid making enemies. By 1961, Carter began to speak more prominently of integration as a member of the Baptist Church and chairman of the Sumter County school board.[54][55] In 1962, he announced his campaign for an open Georgia State Senate seat 15 days before the election.[56] Rosalynn, who had an instinct for politics and organization, was instrumental to his campaign. While early counting of the ballots showed Carter trailing his opponent, Homer Moore, this was later proven to be the result of fraudulent voting. The fraud was found to have been orchestrated by Joe Hurst, the chairman of the Democratic Party in Quitman County.[56] Carter challenged the election result, which was confirmed fraudulent in an investigation. Following this, another election was held, in which Carter won against Moore as the sole Democratic candidate, with a vote margin of 3,013 to 2,182.[57] The civil rights movement was well underway when Carter took office. He and his family had become staunch John F. Kennedy supporters. Carter remained relatively quiet on the issue at first, even as it polarized much of the county, to avoid alienating his segregationist colleagues. Carter did speak up on a few divisive issues, giving speeches against literacy tests and against an amendment to the Georgia Constitution that he felt implied a compulsion to practice religion.[58] Carter entered the state Democratic Executive Committee two years into office, where he helped rewrite the state party's rules. He became the chairman of the West Central Georgia Planning and Development Commission, which oversaw the disbursement of federal and state grants for projects such as historic site restoration.[59] When Bo Callaway was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1964, Carter immediately began planning to challenge him. The two had previously clashed over which two-year college would be expanded to a four-year college program by the state, and Carter saw Callaway‚Äîwho had switched to the Republican Party‚Äîas a rival who represented aspects of politics he despised.[60] Carter was reelected to a second two-year term in the state Senate,[61] where he chaired its Education Committee and sat on the Appropriations Committee toward the end of the term. He contributed to a bill expanding statewide education funding and getting Georgia Southwestern State University a four-year program. He leveraged his regional planning work, giving speeches around the district to make himself more visible to potential voters. On the last day of the term, Carter announced his candidacy for the House of Representatives.[62] Callaway decided to run for governor instead;[63] Carter changed his mind, deciding to run for governor too.[64] In the 1966 gubernatorial election, Carter ran against liberal former governor Ellis Arnall and conservative segregationist Lester Maddox in the Democratic primary. In a press conference, he described his ideology as \"Conservative, moderate, liberal and middle-of-the-road ... I believe I am a more complicated person than that.\"[65] He lost the primary but drew enough votes as a third-place candidate to force Arnall into a runoff election with Maddox, who defeated Arnall.[66] In the general election, Republican nominee Callaway won a plurality of the vote but less than a majority, allowing the Democratic-majority Georgia House of Representatives to elect Maddox as governor.[66] This resulted in a victorious Maddox, whose victory‚Äîdue to his segregationist stance‚Äîwas seen as the worst outcome for the indebted Carter.[66] Carter returned to his agriculture business, carefully planning his next campaign. This period was a spiritual turning point for Carter; he declared himself a born again Christian, and his last child, Amy, was born during this time.[67][68] In the 1970 gubernatorial election, liberal former governor Carl Sanders became Carter's main opponent in the Democratic primary. Carter ran a more modern campaign, employing printed graphics and statistical analysis. Responding to polls, he leaned more conservative than before, positioning himself as a populist and criticizing Sanders for both his wealth and perceived links to the national Democratic Party. He also accused Sanders of corruption, but when pressed by the media, he did not provide evidence.[69][70] Throughout his campaign, Carter sought both the black vote and the votes of those who had supported prominent Alabama segregationist George Wallace. While he met with black figures such as Martin Luther King Sr. and Andrew Young and visited many black-owned businesses, he also praised Wallace and promised to invite him to give a speech in Georgia. Carter's appeal to racism became more blatant over time, with his senior campaign aides handing out a photograph of Sanders celebrating with Black basketball players.[69][70] Carter came ahead of Sanders in the first ballot by 49 percent to 38 percent in September, leading to a runoff election. The subsequent campaign was even more bitter; despite his early support for civil rights, Carter's appeal to racism grew, and he criticized Sanders for supporting Martin Luther King Jr. Carter won the runoff election with 60 percent of the vote and won the general election against Republican nominee Hal Suit. Once elected, Carter changed his tone and began to speak against Georgia's racist politics. Leroy Johnson, a black state senator, voiced his support for Carter: \"I understand why he ran that kind of ultra-conservative campaign. I don't believe you can win this state without being a racist.\"[69] Carter was sworn in as the 76th governor of Georgia on January 12, 1971. In his inaugural speech, he declared that \"the time for racial discrimination is over\",[71] shocking the crowd and causing many of the segregationists who had supported him during the race to feel betrayed. Carter was reluctant to engage with his fellow politicians, making him unpopular with the legislature.[72][73] He expanded the governor's authority by introducing a reorganization plan submitted in January 1972. Despite initially having a cool reception in the legislature, the plan passed at midnight on the last day of the session.[74] Carter merged about 300 state agencies into 22, although it is disputed whether that saved the state money.[75] On July 8, 1971, during an appearance in Columbus, Georgia, he stated his intention to establish a Georgia Human Rights Council to help solve issues ahead of any potential violence.[76] In a news conference on July 13, 1971, Carter announced that he had ordered department heads to reduce spending to prevent a $57 million deficit by the end of the 1972 fiscal year, specifying that each state department would be affected and estimating that 5 percent over government revenue would be lost if state departments continued to fully use allocated funds.[77] On January 13, 1972, he requested that the state legislature fund an early childhood development program along with prison reform programs and $48 million (equivalent to $270 million in 2023) in paid taxes for nearly all state employees.[78] On March 1, 1972, Carter said he might call a special session of the general assembly if the Justice Department opted to turn down any reapportionment plans by either the House or Senate.[79] He pushed several reforms through the legislature, providing equal state aid to schools in Georgia's wealthy and poor areas, setting up community centers for mentally disabled children, and increasing educational programs for convicts. Under this program, all such appointments were based on merit rather than political influence.[80][81] In one of his more controversial decisions, he vetoed a plan to build a dam on Georgia's Flint River, which attracted the attention of environmentalists nationwide.[82][83] Civil rights were a high priority for Carter, who added black state employees and portraits of three prominent black Georgians to the capitol building: Martin Luther King Jr., Lucy Craft Laney, and Henry McNeal Turner. This angered the Ku Klux Klan.[83] He favored a constitutional amendment to ban busing for the purpose of expediting integration in schools on a televised joint appearance with Florida governor Reubin Askew on January 31, 1973,[84] and co-sponsored an anti-busing resolution with Wallace at the 1971 National Governors Conference.[85][86] After the U.S. Supreme Court threw out Georgia's death penalty statute in Furman v. Georgia (1972), Carter signed a revised death-penalty statute that addressed the court's objections, thus reintroducing the practice in the state. He later regretted endorsing the death penalty, saying, \"I didn't see the injustice of it as I do now.\"[87] Ineligible for reelection, Carter looked toward a potential presidential run and engaged in national politics. He was named to several southern planning commissions and was a delegate to the 1972 Democratic National Convention, where liberal U.S. Senator George McGovern was the likely nominee. Carter tried to ingratiate himself with the conservative and anti-McGovern voters. He was fairly obscure at the time, and his attempt at triangulation failed; the 1972 Democratic ticket was McGovern and senator Thomas Eagleton.[88][c] On August 3, Carter met with Wallace in Birmingham, Alabama, to discuss preventing the Democrats from losing in a landslide,[90] but they did.[91] Carter regularly met with his fledgling campaign staff and decided to begin putting a presidential bid for 1976 together. He tried unsuccessfully to become chairman of the National Governors Association to boost his visibility. On David Rockefeller's endorsement, he was named to the Trilateral Commission in April 1973. The next year, he was named chairman of both the Democratic National Committee's congressional and gubernatorial campaigns.[92] In May 1973, Carter warned his party against politicizing the Watergate scandal,[93] which he attributed to president Richard Nixon's isolation from Americans and secretive decision-making.[94] On December 12, 1974, Carter announced his presidential campaign at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. His speech contained themes of domestic inequality, optimism, and change.[95][96] Upon his entrance in the Democratic primaries, he was competing against sixteen other candidates, and was considered to have little chance against the more nationally known politicians such as Wallace.[97] His name recognition was very low, and his opponents derisively asked \"Jimmy Who?\".[98] In response to this, Carter began to emphasize his name and what he stood for, stating \"My name is Jimmy Carter, and I'm running for president.\"[99] This strategy proved successful. By mid-March 1976, Carter was not only far ahead of the active contenders for the presidential nomination, but led incumbent Republican president Gerald Ford by a few percentage points.[100] As the Watergate scandal was still fresh in the voters' minds, Carter's position as an outsider, distant from Washington, D.C. proved helpful. He promoted government reorganization. In June, Carter published a memoir titled Why Not the Best? to help introduce himself to the American public.[101] Carter became the front-runner early on by winning the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary. His strategy involved reaching a region before another candidate could extend influence there, traveling over 50,000 miles (80,000 kilometres), visiting 37 states, and delivering over 200 speeches before any other candidate had entered the race.[102] In the South, he tacitly conceded certain areas to Wallace and swept them as a moderate when it became clear Wallace could not win the region. In the North, Carter appealed largely to conservative Christian and rural voters. While he did not achieve a majority in most Northern states, he won several by building the largest singular support base. Although Carter was initially dismissed as a regional candidate, he would clinch the Democratic nomination.[103] In 1980, Lawrence Shoup noted that the national news media discovered and promoted Carter, and stated: What Carter had that his opponents did not was the acceptance and support of elite sectors of the mass communications media. It was their favorable coverage of Carter and his campaign that gave him an edge, propelling him rocket-like to the top of the opinion polls. This helped Carter win key primary election victories, enabling him to rise from an obscure public figure to President-elect in the short space of 9 months.[104] During an interview in April 1976, Carter said, \"I have nothing against a community that is... trying to maintain the ethnic purity of their neighborhoods.\"[105] His remark was intended as supportive of open housing laws, but specifying opposition to government efforts to \"inject black families into a white neighborhood just to create some sort of integration\".[105] Carter's stated positions during his campaign included public financing of congressional campaigns,[106] his support for the creation of a federal consumer protection agency,[107] creating a separate cabinet-level department for education,[108] signing a peace treaty with the Soviet Union to limit nuclear weapons,[109] reducing the defense budget,[110] a tax proposal implementing \"a substantial increase toward those who have the higher incomes\" alongside a levy reduction on taxpayers with lower and middle incomes,[111] making multiple amendments to the Social Security Act,[112] and having a balanced budget by the end of his first term of office.[113] On July 15, 1976, Carter chose U.S. senator Walter Mondale as his running mate.[114] Carter and Ford faced off in three televised debates,[115] the first United States presidential debates since 1960.[115][116] For the November 1976 issue of Playboy, which hit newsstands a couple of weeks before the election, Robert Scheer interviewed Carter. While discussing his religion's view of pride, Carter said: \"I've looked on a lot of women with lust. I've committed adultery in my heart many times.\"[117][118] This response and his admission in another interview that he did not mind if people uttered the word \"fuck\" led to a media feeding frenzy and critics lamenting the erosion of boundary between politicians and their private intimate lives.[119] Carter once had a sizable lead over Ford in national polling, but by late September his lead had narrowed to only several points.[120][121] In the final days before the election, several polls showed that Ford had tied Carter, and one Gallup poll found that he was now slightly ahead.[122] Most analysts agreed that Carter was going to win the popular vote, but some argued Ford had an opportunity to win the electoral college and thus the election.[123][124] Carter ultimately won, receiving 297 electoral votes and 50.1% of the popular vote to Ford's 240 electoral votes and 48.0% of the popular vote.[125] Carter's victory was attributed in part[126] to his overwhelming support among black voters in states decided by close margins, such as Louisiana, Texas, Pennsylvania, Missouri, Mississippi, Wisconsin, and Ohio.[127] In Ohio and Wisconsin, where the margin between Carter and Ford was under two points, the black vote was crucial for Carter; if he had not won both states, Ford would have won the election.[127][128] Ford phoned Carter to congratulate him shortly after the race was called. He was unable to concede in front of television cameras due to bad hoarse voice, and so First Lady Betty did so for him.[129] Vice President Nelson Rockefeller oversaw the certification of election results on January 6, 1977. Although Ford carried Washington, Mike Padden, an elector from there, cast his vote for Ronald Reagan, the then-governor of California and Carter's eventual successor.[130] Preliminary planning for Carter's presidential transition had already been underway for months before his election.[131][132] Carter had been the first presidential candidate to allot significant funds and a significant number of personnel to a pre-election transition planning effort, which then became standard practice.[133] He set a mold that influenced all future transitions to be larger, more methodical and more formal than they were.[133][132] On November 22, 1976, Carter conducted his first visit to Washington, D.C. after being elected, meeting with director of the Office of Management James Lynn and United States secretary of defense Donald Rumsfeld at the Blair House, and holding an afternoon meeting with President Ford at the White House.[134] The next day, he conferred with congressional leaders, saying that his meetings with cabinet members had been \"very helpful\" and that Ford had offered his assistance if he needed anything.[135] Relations between Ford and Carter were relatively cold during the transition.[136] During his transition, Carter announced the selection of numerous designees for positions in his administration.[137] A few weeks before his inauguration, Carter moved his peanut business into the hands of trustees to avoid a potential conflict of interest.[138] He also asked incoming members of his administration to divest themselves of assets through blind trusts.[139] Carter was inaugurated as the 39th president on January 20, 1977.[140] One of Carter's first acts was the fulfillment of a campaign promise by issuing an executive order declaring unconditional amnesty for Vietnam War-era draft evaders, Proclamation 4483.[141][142] Carter's tenure in office was marked by an economic malaise, a time of continuing inflation and recession and a 1979 energy crisis. Under Carter, the U.S. experienced its first ever government shutdown in May 1980, though it affected only the Federal Trade Commission.[143] Carter attempted to calm various conflicts around the world, most visibly in the Middle East with the signing of the Camp David Accords;[144] giving back the Panama Canal to Panama; and signing the SALT II nuclear arms reduction treaty with Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev. His final year was marred by the Iran hostage crisis, which contributed to his losing the 1980 election to Ronald Reagan.[145] Whistleblowers have alleged, most recently in 2023, that people working on the Reagan campaign's behalf convinced Iran to prolong the crisis to reduce Carter's chance of reelection.[146] Carter's presidency had a troubled economic history of two roughly equal periods. The first two years were a time of intense stagflation, primarily due to recovery from a previous recession that had left fixed investment at extreme lows and unemployment at 9%.[147] Under Carter, the unemployment rate declined from 8.1% when he took office to 5.7% by July 1978,[148][149] but during the early 1980s recession it returned to its pre-1977 level.[150] The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) measured a 6.6% unemployment rate average during the Carter administration.[151] His last two years were marked by double-digit inflation, very high interest rates,[152] oil shortages, and slow economic growth.[153] Due to economic stimulus legislation, such as the Public Works Employment Act of 1977, proposed by Carter and passed by Congress, real household median income had grown by 5.2%, with a projection of 6.4% for the next quarter.[154] The 1979 energy crisis ended this period of growth, and as inflation and interest rates rose, economic growth, job creation and consumer confidence declined sharply.[152] Federal Reserve Board chairman G. William Miller's relatively loose monetary policy had already contributed to somewhat higher inflation,[155] rising from 5.8% in 1976 to 7.7% in 1978. The sudden doubling of crude oil prices by OPEC, the world's leading oil exporting cartel,[156] forced inflation to double-digit levels, averaging 11.3% in 1979 and 13.5% in 1980.[147] The sudden shortage of gasoline as the 1979 summer vacation season began exacerbated the problem and came to symbolize the crisis to the general public;[152] the acute shortage, originating in the shutdown of Amerada Hess refining facilities, led the federal government to sue the company that year.[157] In 1978, Carter declared a federal emergency in the neighborhood of Love Canal in the city of Niagara Falls, New York. More than 800 families were evacuated from the neighborhood, which had been built on top of a toxic waste landfill. The Superfund law was created in response to the situation.[158] Federal disaster money was appropriated to demolish the approximately 500 houses, the 99th Street School, and the 93rd Street School, which had been built on top of the dump; and to remediate the dump and construct a containment area for the hazardous wastes. This was the first time that such a process had been undertaken. Carter acknowledged that several more \"Love Canals\" existed across the country, and that discovering such hazardous dumpsites was \"one of the grimmest discoveries of our modern era\".[159] Moralism typified much of Carter's action.[160] On April 18, 1977, he delivered a televised speech declaring that the current energy crisis was the \"moral equivalent of war\". He encouraged energy conservation and installed solar water heating panels on the White House.[161][162] He wore sweaters to offset turning down the heat in the White House.[163] On August 4, 1977, Carter signed the Department of Energy Organization Act of 1977, forming the Department of Energy, the first new cabinet position in eleven years.[164] Carter emphasized that the House of Representatives had \"adopted almost all\" of the energy proposal he had made five months earlier and called the compromise \"a turning point in establishing a comprehensive energy program.\"[165] The following month, on October 13, Carter stated he believed in the Senate's ability to pass the energy reform bill and identified energy as \"the most important domestic issue that we will face while I am in office.\"[166] On January 12, 1978, during a press conference, Carter said the continued discussions about his energy reform proposal had been \"long and divisive and arduous\" as well as hindering to national issues that needed to be addressed with the implementation of the law.[167] In an April 11, 1978, news conference, Carter said his biggest surprise \"in the nature of a disappointment\" since becoming president was the difficulty Congress had in passing legislation, citing the energy reform bill in particular: \"I never dreamed a year ago in April when I proposed this matter to the Congress that a year later it still would not be resolved.\"[168] The Carter energy legislation was approved by Congress after much deliberation and modification on October 15, 1978. The measure deregulated the sale of natural gas, dropped a longstanding pricing disparity between intra- and interstate gas, and created tax credits to encourage energy conservation and the use of non-fossil fuels.[169] On March 1, 1979, Carter submitted a standby gasoline rationing plan per the request of Congress.[170] On April 5, he delivered an address in which he stressed the urgency of energy conservation and increasing domestic production of energy sources such as coal and solar.[171] During an April 30 news conference, he said it was imperative that the House commerce committee approve the standby gasoline rationing plan and called on Congress to pass the several other standby energy conservation plans he had proposed.[172] On July 15, 1979, Carter delivered a nationally televised address in which he identified what he believed to be a \"crisis of confidence\" among American people,[173] under the advisement of pollster Pat Caddell who believed Americans faced a crisis in confidence from events of the 1960s and 1970s, before his presidency.[174] Some later called this his \"malaise speech\",[173] memorable for mixed reactions[175][176] and his use of rhetoric.[174] The speech's negative reception centered on a view that he did not emphasize his own efforts to address the energy crisis and seemed too reliant on Americans.[177] Carter typically refused to conform to Washington's rules.[178] He avoided phone calls from members of Congress and verbally insulted them. He was unwilling to return political favors. His negativity led to frustration in passing legislation.[179] During a press conference on February 23, 1977, Carter stated that it was \"inevitable\" that he would come into conflict with Congress and added that he had found \"a growing sense of cooperation\" with Congress and met in the past with congressional members of both parties.[180] Carter developed a bitter feeling following an unsuccessful attempt at having Congress enact the scrapping of several water projects,[181] which he had requested during his first 100 days in office and received opposition from members of his party.[182] As a rift ensued between the White House and Congress afterward, Carter noted that the Democratic Party's liberal wing opposed his policies the most ardently, attributing this to Ted Kennedy's wanting the presidency.[183] Thinking he had support from 74 Congressmen, Carter issued a \"hit list\" of 19 projects that he claimed were \"pork barrel\" spending that he said he would veto if they were included in legislation.[184] He found himself again at odds with Congressional Democrats, as House Speaker Tip O'Neill found it inappropriate for a president to pursue what had traditionally been the role of Congress. Carter was also weakened by signing a bill that contained many of the \"hit list\" projects he had intended to veto.[185] In an address to a fundraising dinner for the Democratic National Committee on June 23, 1977, Carter said, \"I think it's good to point out tonight, too, that we have evolved a good working relationship with the Congress. For eight years we had government by partisanship. Now we have government by partnership.\"[186] At a July 28 news conference, assessing the first six months of his presidency, Carter spoke of his improved understanding of Congress: \"I have learned to respect the Congress more in an individual basis. I've been favorably impressed at the high degree of concentrated experience and knowledge that individual members of Congress can bring on a specific subject, where they've been the chairman of a subcommittee or committee for many years and have focused their attention on this particular aspect of government life which I will never be able to do.\"[187] On May 10, 1979, the House voted against giving Carter authority to produce a standby gas rationing plan.[188] The following day, Carter delivered remarks in the Oval Office describing himself as shocked and embarrassed for the American government by the vote and concluding \"the majority of the House Members are unwilling to take the responsibility, the political responsibility for dealing with a potential, serious threat to our Nation.\" He furthered that a majority of House members were placing higher importance on \"local or parochial interests\" and challenged the lower chamber of Congress with composing their own rationing plan in the next 90 days.[189] Carter's remarks were met with criticism by House Republicans, who accused his comments of not befitting the formality a president should have in their public remarks. Others pointed to 106 Democrats voting against his proposal and the bipartisan criticism potentially coming back to haunt him.[190] At the start of a news conference on July 25, 1979, Carter called on believers in the future of the U.S. and his proposed energy program to speak with Congress as it bore the responsibility to impose his proposals.[191] Amid the energy proposal opposition, The New York Times commented that \"as the comments flying up and down Pennsylvania Avenue illustrate, there is also a crisis of confidence between Congress and the President, sense of doubt and distrust that threatens to undermine the President's legislative program and become an important issue in next year's campaign.\"[192] In 1977, Carter appointed Alfred E. Kahn to lead the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB). He was part of a push for deregulation of the industry, supported by leading economists, leading think tanks in Washington, a civil society coalition advocating the reform (patterned on a coalition earlier developed for the truck-and-rail-reform efforts), the head of the regulatory agency, Senate leadership, the Carter administration, and even some in the airline industry. This coalition swiftly gained legislative results in 1978.[193] Carter signed the Airline Deregulation Act into law on October 24, 1978. The main purpose of the act was to remove government control over fares, routes and market entry (of new airlines) from commercial aviation. The Civil Aeronautics Board's powers of regulation were to be phased out, eventually allowing market forces to determine routes and fares. The Act did not remove or diminish the FAA's regulatory powers over all aspects of airline safety.[194] In 1979, Carter deregulated the American beer industry by making it legal to sell malt, hops, and yeast to American home brewers for the first time since the effective 1920 beginning of prohibition in the United States.[195] This deregulation led to an increase in home brewing over the 1980s and 1990s that by the 2000s had developed into a strong craft microbrew culture in the United States, with 9,118 microbreweries, brewpubs, and regional craft breweries in the United States by the end of 2021.[196] In the late 1970s, the Chrysler Cooperation‚Äîone of the \"Big Three\" automobile manufacturers in the U.S.‚Äîfaced near-certain bankruptcy as it projected a loss of $1 billion.[197] Carter proposed that the company forgo salary increases and bonuses, implying that it would be done \"without decimating the company or putting it on its knees\", but the company had already frozen wage increases and bonuses months before, to no avail.[198] In December 1979, Congress passed H.R. 5860, the Chrysler Corporation Loan Guarantee Act of 1979, to bail Chrysler out with $3.5 billion (equivalent to $10.9 billion in 2023) in aid.[199] The bill turned over $162 million in stock to Chrysler's workers, eliminated around $125 million in wage increases, and gave Chrysler $500 million in bank loans.[197] Carter signed it into law in January, saying that the bill saved thousands of jobs.[197] During his presidential campaign, Carter embraced healthcare reform akin to the Ted Kennedy-sponsored bipartisan universal national health insurance.[200] Carter's proposals on healthcare while in office included an April 1977 mandatory health care cost proposal,[201] and a June 1979 proposal that provided private health insurance coverage.[202] Carter saw the June 1979 proposal as a continuation of progress in American health coverage. President Harry S. Truman proposed a designation of health care as a basic right of Americans and Medicare and Medicaid were introduced under President Lyndon B. Johnson.[203][204] The April 1977 mandatory health care cost proposal was passed in the Senate,[205] but later defeated in the House.[206] During 1978, he met with Kennedy over a compromise healthcare law that proved unsuccessful.[207] He later said Kennedy's disagreements thwarted his plan to provide a comprehensive American health care system.[208] In 1980, Carter signed into law the Mental Health Systems (MHSA) Act, which allocated block grants to states to bolster the establishment and growth of community health services and provided funding to states to create and implement community-based health services. The MHSA was considered landmark legislation in mental health care.[209] By September 1981, the Reagan administration had repealed most of the law.[210] Early into his term, Carter collaborated with Congress to fulfill his campaign promise to create a cabinet level education department. In an address from the White House on February 28, 1978, Carter argued \"Education is far too important a matter to be scattered piecemeal among various government departments and agencies, which are often busy with sometimes dominant concerns.\"[211] On February 8, 1979, the Carter administration released an outline of its plan to establish an education department and asserted enough support for the enactment to occur by June.[212] On October 17, the same year, Carter signed the Department of Education Organization Act into law,[213] establishing the United States Department of Education.[214] Carter expanded the Head Start program with the addition of 43,000 children and families,[215] while the percentage of nondefense dollars spent on education was doubled.[216] Carter was complimentary of the presidency of Lyndon B. Johnson and the 89th United States Congress for having initiated Head Start.[217] In a speech on November 1, 1980, Carter stated his administration had extended Head Start to migrant children and was \"working hard right now with Senator Bentsen and with Kika de la Garza to make as much as $45 million available in federal money in the border districts to help with the increase in school construction for the number of Mexican school children who reside here legally\".[218] During Carter's administration, the United States Foreign Service \"lifted its ban on gay and lesbian personnel\". In 1977, Jimmy Carter's administration became the first American presidential administration to invite gay male and lesbian rights activists to the White House to discuss federal policy with regard to ending employment discrimination in federal employment on the basis of sexual orientation and related issues (presidential advisor Midge Costanza having issued the invitation).[219] From the onset of his presidency, Carter attempted to mediate the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict.[220] After a failed attempt to seek a comprehensive settlement between the two nations in 1977 (through reconvening the 1973 Geneva conference),[221] Carter invited the Egyptian president Anwar Sadat and Israeli prime minister Menachem Begin to the presidential lodge Camp David in September 1978, in hopes of creating a definitive peace. While the two sides could not agree on Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank, the negotiations resulted in Egypt formally recognizing Israel, and the creation of an elected government in the West Bank and Gaza. This resulted in the Camp David Accords, which ended the war between Israel and Egypt.[222] The accords were a source of great domestic opposition in both Egypt and Israel. Historian J√∏rgen Jensehaugen argues that by the time Carter left office in January 1981, he was \"in an odd position‚Äîhe had attempted to break with traditional U.S. policy but ended up fulfilling the goals of that tradition, which had been to break up the Arab alliance, sideline the Palestinians, build an alliance with Egypt, weaken the Soviet Union and secure Israel.\"[223] In an address to the African officials at the United Nations on October 4, 1977, Carter stated the U.S.'s interest to \"see a strong, vigorous, free, and prosperous Africa with as much of the control of government as possible in the hands of the residents of your countries\" and pointed to their unified efforts on \"the problem of how to resolve the Rhodesian, Zimbabwe question.\"[224] At a news conference later that month, Carter outlined that the U.S. wanted to \"work harmoniously with South Africa in dealing with the threats to peace in Namibia and in Zimbabwe in particular\", as well as do away with racial issues such as apartheid, and for equal opportunities in other facets of society in the region.[225] Despite human rights concerns, Carter continued U.S. support for Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire.[226] Zaire received nearly half the foreign aid Carter allocated to sub-Saharan Africa.[227] Under Carter an allyship with Liberia's Samuel Doe who had come to power in a 1980 coup was pursued.[228] Carter visited Nigeria from March 31 to April 3, 1978, to improve relations;[229] the first U.S. president to do so.[230] He reiterated interest in convening a peace conference on Rhodesia that involved all parties and said the U.S. was moving as it could.[231] The elections of Margaret Thatcher as prime minister of the United Kingdom[232] and Abel Muzorewa for Prime Minister of Zimbabwe Rhodesia,[233] South Africa turning down a plan for South West Africa's independence, and domestic opposition in Congress were seen as a heavy blow to the Carter administration's policy toward South Africa.[234] On May 16, 1979, the Senate voted in favor of lifting economic sanctions against Rhodesia, seen by some Rhodesians and South Africans as a potentially fatal blow to joint diplomacy efforts the United States and Britain had pursued in the region for three years and any compromise between the Salisbury leaders and guerrillas.[235] On December 3, Secretary of State Cyrus Vance promised Senator Jesse Helms that when the British governor arrived in Salisbury to implement an agreed Lancaster House settlement and the electoral process began, the President would take prompt action to lift sanctions against Zimbabwe Rhodesia.[236] Carter sought closer relations with the People's Republic of China (PRC), continuing the Nixon administration's drastic policy of rapprochement. The two countries increasingly collaborated against the Soviet Union, and the Carter administration tacitly consented to the Chinese invasion of Vietnam. In December 1978, he announced the United States' intention to formally recognize and establish full diplomatic relations with the PRC starting on January 1, 1979, while severing ties with Taiwan, including revoking a mutual defense treaty with the latter.[237][238] In 1979, Carter extended formal diplomatic recognition to the PRC for the first time. This decision led to a boom in trade between the United States and the PRC, which was pursuing economic reforms under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping.[239] Carter supported the China-allied Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia fighting the Soviet-backed Vietnamese invasion.[240] After the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, Carter allowed the sale of military supplies to China and began negotiations to share military intelligence.[241] In January 1980, Carter unilaterally revoked the Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty with the Republic of China (ROC), which had lost control of mainland China to the PRC in 1949, but retained control of the island of Taiwan. Conservative Republicans challenged Carter's abrogation of the treaty in court, but the Supreme Court ruled that the issue was a non-justiciable political question in Goldwater v. Carter. The U.S. continued to maintain diplomatic contacts with the ROC through the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act.[242] During Carter's presidency, the U.S. continued to support Indonesia under Suharto as a cold war ally, despite human rights violations in East Timor. The violations followed Indonesia's December 1975 invasion and occupation of East Timor. Under Carter's administration military assistance to Indonesia increased, peaking in 1978.[243][244] This was antithetical to Carter's stated policy of \"not selling weapons if it would exacerbate a potential conflict in a region of the world\".[245][246] During a news conference on March 9, 1977, Carter reaffirmed his interest in having a gradual withdrawal of American troops from South Korea and said he wanted South Korea to eventually have \"adequate ground forces owned by and controlled by the South Korean government to protect themselves against any intrusion from North Korea.\"[247] On May 19, The Washington Post quoted Chief of Staff of U.S. forces in South Korea John K. Singlaub as criticizing Carter's withdrawal of troops from the Korean peninsula. Later that day, Press Secretary Rex Granum announced that Carter had summoned Singlaub to the White House, and confirmed that Carter had seen the Washington Post article.[248] Carter relieved Singlaub of his duties on May 21 after a meeting between the two.[249][250] During a news conference on May 26, 1977, Carter said South Korea could defend itself with reduced American troops in case of conflict.[251] From June 30 to July 1, 1979, Carter held meetings with president of South Korea Park Chung Hee at the Blue House for a discussion on relations between the U.S. and South Korea as well as Carter's interest in preserving his policy of worldwide tension reduction.[252] On April 21, 1978, Carter announced a reduction in American troops in South Korea scheduled to be released by the end of the year by two-thirds, citing lack of action by Congress in regard to a compensatory aid package for the South Korean government.[253] Carter supported South Korean President Chun Doo-hwan during the suppression of the Gwangju Uprising in May 1980.[254] South Korean pro-democracy activist Kim Dae-jung was sentenced to death in September 1980, but his sentence was commuted after the intervention of Presidents Carter and Reagan.[255] On November 15, 1977, Carter pledged that his administration would continue positive relations between the U.S. and Iran, calling its contemporary status \"strong, stable and progressive\".[256] On December 31, 1977, he called Iran under the Shah an \"island of stability\" made possible by the \"admiration and love your people give to [the Shah]\".[257][258] Carter praised the Shah's \"great leadership\" and spoke of \"personal friendship\" between them.[259] American support for the unpopular Shah increased anti-American sentiment in Iran, which intensified after the Shah, who was dying of cancer, left Iran for the last time in January 1979 and Carter allowed him to be admitted to the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York on October 22, 1979.[260] On November 4, 1979, a group of Iranian students took over the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. The students belonged to the Muslim Student Followers of the Imam's Line and supported the Iranian Revolution.[261] Fifty-two American diplomats and citizens were held hostage for the next 444 days. They were freed immediately after Ronald Reagan succeeded Carter as president on January 20, 1981. During the crisis, Carter remained in isolation in the White House for more than 100 days, until he left to participate in the lighting of the National Menorah on the Ellipse.[262] A month into the affair, Carter announced his commitment to resolving the dispute without \"any military action that would cause bloodshed or arouse the unstable captors of our hostages to attack them or to punish them\".[263] On April 7, 1980, he issued Executive Order 12205, imposing economic sanctions against Iran,[264] and announced further government measures he deemed necessary to ensure a safe release.[265][266] On April 24, 1980, Carter ordered Operation Eagle Claw to try to free the hostages. The mission failed, leaving eight American servicemen dead and two aircraft destroyed.[267][268] The failure led Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, who had opposed the mission, to resign.[269] Released in 2017, a declassified memo produced by the CIA in 1980 concluded \"Iranian hardliners‚Äîespecially Ayatollah Khomeini\" were \"determined to exploit the hostage issue to bring about President Carter's defeat in the November elections.\" Additionally, Tehran in 1980 wanted \"the world to believe that Imam Khomeini caused President Carter's downfall and disgrace.\"[270] On February 8, 1977, Carter said he had urged the Soviet Union to align with the U.S. in forming \"a comprehensive test ban to stop all nuclear testing for at least an extended period of time\", and that he was in favor of the Soviet Union ceasing deployment of the RSD-10 Pioneer.[271] During a June 13 press conference, he said that at the beginning of the week, the U.S. would \"work closely with the Soviet Union on a comprehensive test ban treaty to prohibit all testing of nuclear devices underground or in the atmosphere\", and Paul Warnke would negotiate demilitarization of the Indian Ocean with the Soviet Union beginning the following week.[272] At a December 30 news conference, Carter said that during \"the last few months, the United States and the Soviet Union have made great progress in dealing with a long list of important issues, the most important of which is to control the deployment of strategic nuclear weapons\", and that the two countries sought to conclude SALT II talks by the spring of the next year.[273] The talk of a comprehensive test ban treaty materialized with the signing of the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty II by Carter and Leonid Brezhnev on June 18, 1979.[274][275] In 1979, the Soviets intervened in the Second Yemenite War. The Soviet backing of South Yemen constituted a \"smaller shock\", in tandem with tensions that were rising due to the Iranian Revolution. This played a role in making Carter's stance on the Soviet Union more assertive, a shift that finalized with the impending Soviet-Afghan War.[276] In his 1980 State of the Union Address, Carter emphasized the significance of relations between the two regions: \"Now, as during the last 3¬Ω decades, the relationship between our country, the United States of America, and the Soviet Union is the most critical factor in determining whether the world will live at peace or be engulfed in global conflict.\"[277] Communists under the leadership of Nur Muhammad Taraki seized power in Afghanistan on April 27, 1978.[278] The new regime signed a treaty of friendship with the Soviet Union in December of that year.[278][279] Due to the regime's improvement of secular education and redistribution of land coinciding with mass executions and political oppression, Taraki was deposed by rival Hafizullah Amin in September.[278][279][280] Amin was considered a \"brutal psychopath\" by foreign observers and had lost control of much of the country, prompting the Soviet Union to invade Afghanistan on December 24, 1979, execute Amin, and install Babrak Karmal as president.[278][279] In the West, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan was considered a threat to global security and the oil supplies of the Persian Gulf, as well as the existence of Pakistan.[279][281] These concerns led Carter to expand collaboration between the CIA and Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), which had begun in July 1979, when the CIA started providing $695,000 worth of non-lethal assistance (e.g., \"cash, medical equipment, and radio transmitters\") to the Afghan mujahideen.[282] The modest scope of this early collaboration was likely influenced by the understanding, later recounted by CIA official Robert Gates, \"that a substantial U.S. covert aid program\" might have \"raise[d] the stakes\", thereby causing \"the Soviets to intervene more directly and vigorously than otherwise intended.\"[281][283] According to a 2020 review of declassified U.S. documents by Conor Tobin in the journal Diplomatic History: \"The primary significance of this small-scale aid was in creating constructive links with dissidents through Pakistan's ISI that could be utilized in the case of an overt Soviet intervention ... The small-scale covert program that developed in response to the increasing Soviet influence was part of a contingency plan if the Soviets did intervene militarily, as Washington would be in a better position to make it difficult for them to consolidate their position, but not designed to induce an intervention.\"[282] On December 28, 1979, Carter signed a presidential finding explicitly allowing the CIA to transfer \"lethal military equipment either directly or through third countries to the Afghan opponents of the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan\" and to arrange \"selective training, conducted outside of Afghanistan, in the use of such equipment either directly or via third country intermediation.\"[282] His finding defined the CIA's mission as \"harassment\" of Soviet troops; at the time, \"this was not a war the CIA expected to win outright on the battlefield,\" in the words of Steve Coll.[284] Carter was determined to respond harshly to what he considered a dangerous provocation. In a televised speech on January 23, 1980, he announced sanctions on the Soviet Union, promised renewed aid and registration to Pakistan and the Selective Service System, and committed the U.S. to the Persian Gulf's defense.[281][283][285][286] Carter imposed an embargo on grain shipments to the USSR, tabled SALT II, requested a 5% annual increase in defense spending,[287][288] and called for a boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, which was ultimately joined by 65 other nations.[289][290][291] British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher enthusiastically backed Carter's tough stance.[281] National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski played a major role in organizing Carter's policies on the Soviet Union as a grand strategy.[292] In early 1980, Carter determined the thrust of U.S. policy for the duration of the war: he initiated a program to arm the mujahideen through Pakistan's ISI and secured a pledge from Saudi Arabia to match U.S. funding for this purpose. Despite huge expenditure, the Soviet Union was unable to quell the insurgency and withdrew from Afghanistan in 1989 amid the economic, political, and social turmoil within the USSR, precipitating its collapse two years later.[293][281] The routing of U.S. aid through Pakistan led to some controversy, as weapons sent to Karachi were frequently controlled by Pakistan, whose government influenced which rebels received assistance. Despite this, Carter has expressed no regret over his decision to support what he still considers the Afghan freedom fighters.[281] Carter made twelve international trips to 25 countries as president.[294] He was the first president to make a state visit to Sub-Saharan Africa when he went to Nigeria in 1978.[230] His travel also included trips to Europe, Asia, and Latin America. He made several trips to the Middle East to broker peace negotiations. His visit to Iran from December 31, 1977, to January 1, 1978, took place less than a year before the overthrow of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.[295] The September 21, 1977, resignation of Bert Lance, who was director of the office of management and budget in the Carter administration, came amid allegations of improper banking activities before his tenure and was an embarrassment to Carter.[296] Carter became the first sitting president to testify under oath as part of an investigation of him,[297][298] as a result of United States Attorney General Griffin Bell appointing Paul J. Curran as a special counsel to investigate loans made to the peanut business Carter owned by a bank controlled by Lance and Curran's position as special counsel not allowing him to file charges on his own.[299][d] Curran announced in October 1979 that no evidence had been found to support allegations that funds loaned from the National Bank of Georgia had been diverted to Carter's 1976 presidential campaign, ending the investigation.[300] Carter's reelection campaign was based primarily on attacking Ronald Reagan. The campaign frequently pointed out and mocked Reagan's proclivity for gaffes, using his age and perceived lack of connection to his native California voter base against him.[301] Later, the campaign used similar rhetoric as Lyndon Johnson's 1964 presidential campaign, portraying Reagan as a warmonger who could not be trusted with the nuclear arsenal.[302] Carter attempted to deny the Reagan campaign $29.4 million (equivalent to $91 million in 2023) in campaign funds, due to dependent conservative groups already raising $60 million to get him elected‚Äîan amount that exceeded the limit of campaign funds. Carter's attempt was later denied by the Federal Election Commission.[303] Carter announced his reelection campaign in December 1979.[304] A month earlier, Senator Ted Kennedy had announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination.[305] During the Democratic presidential primaries, questions about Kennedy were a frequent subject of Carter's press conferences.[306][307] Despite winning key states such as California and New York, Kennedy surprised his supporters by running a weak campaign. Carter won most of the primaries and secured renomination. He later wrote that the strongest opposition to his policies came from the Democratic Party's liberal wing, which he attributed to Kennedy's ambition to replace him as president.[308] Kennedy had mobilized the liberal wing, which weakened Carter's support in the general election.[309] Carter and Mondale were formally nominated at the 1980 Democratic National Convention in New York City.[310] Carter delivered a speech notable for its tribute to the late Hubert Humphrey, whom he initially called \"Hubert Horatio Hornblower\",[311] and Kennedy made \"The Dream Shall Never Die\" speech, in which he criticized Reagan and did not endorse Carter.[312] Along with Reagan and Kennedy, Carter was opposed by centrist John B. Anderson, who had previously contested the Republican presidential primaries, and upon losing to Reagan, reentered the race as an independent. Anderson advertised himself as a more liberal alternative to Reagan's conservatism.[313] As the campaign went on, Anderson's polling numbers dropped and his base was gradually pulled to Carter or Reagan.[314] Carter had to run against his own \"stagflation\"-ridden economy, while the hostage crisis in Iran dominated the news every week. He was attacked by conservatives for failing to \"prevent Soviet gains\" in less-developed countries, as pro-Soviet governments had taken power in countries including Angola, Ethiopia, Nicaragua and Afghanistan.[315] His brother, Billy Carter, caused controversy due to his association with Muammar Gaddafi's regime in Libya.[316] Carter alienated many liberal college students, who were expected to be one of his strongest support bases, by reactivating the Selective Service System on July 2, 1980, reinstating registration for the military draft. His campaign manager and former appointments secretary, Timothy Kraft, stepped down five weeks before the general election amid what turned out to be an uncorroborated allegation of cocaine use.[317] On October 28, Carter and Reagan participated in the sole presidential debate of the election cycle in which they were both present, due to Carter refusing to participate in debates that included Anderson.[318] Though initially trailing Carter by several points,[319] Reagan experienced a surge in polling after the debate.[320] This was in part influenced by Reagan deploying the phrase \"There you go again\", which became the election's defining phrase.[321] It was later discovered that in the final days of the campaign, Reagan's team acquired classified documents Carter used to prepare for the debate.[322] Reagan defeated Carter in a landslide, winning 489 electoral votes. The Senate went Republican for the first time since 1952.[323] In his concession speech, Carter admitted that he was hurt by the outcome of the election but pledged \"a very fine transition period\" with President-elect Reagan.[324] Shortly after losing reelection, Carter told the White House press corps that he intended to emulate the retirement of Harry S. Truman and not use his subsequent public life to enrich himself.[325] Diplomacy was a large part of Carter's post-presidency. These diplomatic efforts began in the Middle East, with a September 1981 meeting with prime minister of Israel Menachem Begin,[326] and a March 1983 tour of Egypt that included meeting with members of the Palestine Liberation Organization.[327] In 2018, official files revealed that, in January 1993, Carter had been suggested for a Northern Ireland peace process role by president-elect Bill Clinton amid speculation that Clinton would appoint a special envoy for Northern Ireland.[328] In 1994, president Clinton sought Carter's assistance in a North Korea peace mission, during which Carter negotiated an understanding with Kim Il Sung.[329][330] Carter outlined a treaty with Kim, which he announced to CNN without the Clinton administration's consent to spur American action.[331] In March 1999, Carter visited Taiwan and met with President Lee Teng-hui. During the meeting, Carter praised the progress Taiwan made in democracy, human rights, economy, culture, science and technology.[332] In 2003, Carter championed a plan to hold elections in Venezuela amid protests aimed at doing so.[333] Ultimately, no elections were held. In 2006, Carter stated his disagreements with Israel's domestic and foreign policy while saying he supported the country,[334][335] extending his criticisms to Israel's policies in Lebanon, the West Bank, and Gaza.[336] In July 2007, Carter joined Nelson Mandela in Johannesburg, South Africa, to announce his participation in The Elders, a group of independent global leaders who work together on peace and human rights issues.[337][338] After the announcement, Carter participated in visits to Darfur,[339] Sudan,[340][341] Cyprus, the Korean Peninsula, and the Middle East, among others.[342] He attempted to travel to Zimbabwe in November 2008, but was stopped by President Robert Mugabe's government.[343] In December 2008, Carter met with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad,[344][345] and in a June 2012 call with Jeffery Brown, stressed that Egyptian military generals could take full executive and legislative power to form a new constitution favoring themselves if their announced intentions came true.[346] On August 10, 2010, Carter traveled to North Korea to secure the release of Aijalon Gomes, successfully negotiating his release.[347][348] Throughout the latter part of 2017, as tensions between the U.S. and North Korea persisted, Carter recommended a peace treaty between the two nations,[349] and confirmed that he had volunteered to the Trump administration to be a diplomatic envoy to North Korea.[350] Carter began his first year out of office with a pledge not to critique the Reagan administration, saying it was \"too early\".[351] He sided with Reagan on issues like building neutron arms after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan,[352] but frequently spoke out against his administration, denouncing many of its actions in the Middle East;[353] in 1987, Carter said that Reagan was incapable of preserving peace in the Middle East.[354] He condemned the handling of the Sabra and Shatila massacre,[355] the lack of efforts to rescue and retrieve four American businessmen from West Beirut in 1984,[356] Reagan's support of the Strategic Defense Initiative in 1985,[357] and his claim of an international conspiracy on terrorism.[358] In 1987 he criticized Reagan for conceding to terrorist demands,[359] nominating Robert Bork for the Supreme Court,[360] and his handling of the Persian Gulf crisis.[361] On January 16, 1989, before the inauguration of George H. W. Bush, Carter told Gerald Ford that Reagan had experienced a media honeymoon, saying that he believed Reagan's immediate successor would be less fortunate.[362] Carter had a mostly poor relationship with Bill Clinton, who snubbed him from his inauguration ceremony. He doubted the morality of the Clinton administration, particularly with respect to the Monica Lewinsky scandal and the pardon of Marc Rich.[363] In July 2001, Carter said he was \"disappointed in almost everything\" President George W. Bush had done, but after the September 11 attacks, he offered only praise, calling on Americans to support Bush with \"complete unity\".[364] Later, Carter opposed the Iraq War[365] and what he considered an attempt by Bush and Tony Blair to oust Saddam Hussein with \"lies and misinterpretations\".[366] In 2004, Carter said that he believed Bush exploited the September 11 attacks and blamed the media for not criticizing him.[367] In 2007, Carter said the Bush administration \"has been the worst in history\" on foreign affairs;[368] he later said he was just comparing Bush's tenure to Nixon's.[369] Tony Fratto responded to Carter's comments on the Bush administration's behalf by saying that the comments increased Carter's irrelevance.[370] By the end of Bush's second term, Carter considered Bush's tenure disappointing, as he told Forward Magazine of Syria.[371] Though he praised President Barack Obama in the early part of his tenure,[372] Carter stated his disagreement with using drone strikes against suspected terrorists, Obama's choice to keep Guantanamo Bay detention camp open,[373] and the federal surveillance programs Edward Snowden revealed.[374][375] During Donald Trump's presidency, Carter spoke favorably of the chance for immigration reform[376] and criticized Trump for his handling of the U.S. national anthem protests.[377] In October 2017, he defended Trump in an interview with The New York Times, criticizing the media's coverage of him as harsher \"than any other president certainly that I've known about\".[378][379] In 2019, Trump called Carter and expressed concern that China was \"getting ahead\" of the United States. Carter agreed, saying that China's strength came from its lack of involvement in armed conflict and calling the U.S. \"the most warlike nation in the history of the world.\"[380] Carter was considered a potential candidate in the 1984 presidential election,[381][382] but did not run and instead endorsed Walter Mondale for the Democratic nomination.[383][384] After Mondale secured the nomination, Carter critiqued the Reagan campaign,[385] spoke at the 1984 Democratic National Convention, and advised Mondale.[386] After the election, in which Reagan defeated Mondale, Carter said the loss was predictable because Mondale's platform included raising taxes.[387] In the 1988 presidential election, Carter ruled himself out as a candidate and predicted Vice President George H. W. Bush would be the Republican nominee.[388] Carter foresaw unity at the 1988 Democratic National Convention,[389] where he delivered an address.[390] After the election, which Bush won, Carter said Bush would have a more difficult presidency than Reagan because he was not as popular.[391] During the 1992 presidential election, Carter met with Senator Paul Tsongas, who sought his advice.[392] Carter spoke favorably of former governor of Arkansas Bill Clinton,[393] and criticized Ross Perot, a Texas billionaire who was running as an independent.[394] As the primary concluded, Carter spoke of the need for the 1992 Democratic National Convention to address certain issues not focused on in the past,[395] and campaigned for Clinton after he became the Democratic nominee,[396] publicly stating his expectation to be consulted during Clinton's presidency.[397] Carter endorsed Vice President Al Gore days before the 2000 presidential election,[398] and in subsequent years voiced his opinion that Gore won the election,[399] despite Bush's eventual victory following the Supreme Court's ruling in Bush v. Gore.[400] In the 2004 presidential election, Carter endorsed John Kerry and spoke at the 2004 Democratic National Convention.[401] He also voiced concern about another voting mishap in Florida.[402] During the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries, it was speculated that Carter would endorse Barack Obama over his main primary rival Hillary Clinton, as Carter spoke favorably of Obama, as did other members of the Carter family.[403][404] Carter also commented on Clinton ending her bid when superdelegates voted after the June 3 primary.[405] Carter criticized the Republican nominee, John McCain.[406][407] Carter warned Obama against selecting Clinton as his running mate.[408] Carter endorsed Republican Mitt Romney for the Republican nomination during the primary season of the 2012 presidential election, though he clarified that his backing of Romney was due to him considering the former Massachusetts governor the candidate that could best assure a victory for President Obama.[409] Carter delivered a videotape address at the 2012 Democratic National Convention.[410] Carter was critical of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump shortly after the latter entered the primary, predicting that he would lose.[411][412] As the primary continued, Carter said he would prefer Trump to his main rival, Ted Cruz,[413] though he rebuked the Trump campaign in remarks during the primary[414] and in his address to the 2016 Democratic National Convention. Carter believed that Trump would not have been elected without Russia's interference in the 2016 election,[415] and \"that Trump didn't actually win the election in 2016. He lost the election, and he was put into office because the Russians interfered on his behalf.\" When questioned, he agreed that Trump is an \"illegitimate president\".[416][417] In a 2017 discussion with Senator Bernie Sanders, Carter revealed he voted for Sanders in the 2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries.[418] Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter delivered a recorded audio message endorsing Joe Biden for the virtual 2020 Democratic National Convention. On January 6, 2021, following the U.S. Capitol attack, along with the other three still living former presidents, Barack Obama, George W. Bush, and Bill Clinton,[419] Jimmy Carter denounced the attack, releasing a statement saying that he and his wife were \"troubled\" by the events, also stating that what had occurred was \"a national tragedy and is not who we are as a nation\", and adding that \"having observed elections in troubled democracies worldwide, I know that we the people can unite to walk back from this precipice to peacefully uphold the laws of our nation\".[420] Carter delivered a recorded audio message for the inauguration of Joe Biden on January 20, 2021, as the Carters were unable to attend the ceremony in person.[421] In November 2022, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit overruled a three-judge panel of the court and scheduled a rehearing of the case against the Trump administration-proposed land swap in Alaska to allow a road through the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge. In an unusual action, Carter had filed an opinion in support of the suit by environmental groups, saying the swap violated the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (Anilca) passed in 1980 near the end of Carter's term. Carter said the act \"may be the most significant domestic achievement of my political life\" at the time of his filing.[422] In August 2024, Carter's son Chip said his father wanted to live to 100 to vote for Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.[423] He achieved this on October 16, the second day of early voting in Georgia.[424][425] Carter criticized the Bush administration's handling of Hurricane Katrina,[426] and built homes in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy.[427] He also partnered with former presidents to work with One America Appeal to help the victims of Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma in the Gulf Coast and Texas communities,[428] in addition to writing op-eds about the goodness seen in Americans who assist each other during natural disasters.[429] In 1982, Carter founded the Carter Center,[430] a non-governmental and non-profit organization with the purpose of advancing human rights and alleviating human suffering,[431] including helping improve the quality of life for people in more than 80 countries.[432] Among these efforts has been the contribution of the Carter Center working alongside the World Health Organization to the near-eradication of dracunculiasis, also called Guinea worm disease. The incidence of this disease has decreased from 3.5 million cases in the mid-1980s, to 25 cases in 2016,[433][434] and four in the first seven months of 2024, according to the Carter Center's statistics.[435] Carter attended the dedication of his presidential library[436] and those of Presidents Ronald Reagan,[437] George H. W. Bush,[438] Bill Clinton,[439][440] and George W. Bush.[441] He delivered eulogies at the funerals of Coretta Scott King,[442] Gerald Ford,[443][444] and Theodore Hesburgh.[445] In 2007, Carter founded the New Baptist Covenant organization for social justice.[446][447] As of August 2019[update], Carter was Honorary Chair for the World Justice Project[448] and formerly served as one for the Continuity of Government Commission.[449] He continued to occasionally teach Sunday school at Maranatha Baptist Church as of 2019.[450] Carter also taught at Emory University in Atlanta, and in June 2019 was awarded tenure for 37 years of service.[451] Carter's Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid, a New York Times Best Seller book, published in 2006, generated controversy for characterizing Israel's policies in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip as amounting to apartheid.[452] In an interview, Carter defined apartheid as the \"forced separation of two peoples in the same territory with one of the groups dominating or controlling the other.\"[453] In remarks broadcast over radio, he said that Israel's policies amounted to an apartheid worse than South Africa's:[454] When Israel does occupy this territory deep within the West Bank, and connects the 200-or-so settlements with each other, with a road, and then prohibits the Palestinians from using that road, or in many cases even crossing the road, this perpetrates even worse instances of apartness, or apartheid, than we witnessed even in South Africa.[454] Carter defended himself against accusations of antisemitism by saying \"the hope is that my book will at least stimulate a debate, which has not existed in this country. There's never been any debate on this issue, of any significance.\"[454] He expressed his opinion that Israel will not have peace until it agrees to withdraw from the occupied territories, adding, \"the greatest commitment in my life has been trying to bring peace to Israel.\"[454] In his 2010 book We Can Have Peace in the Holy Land, Carter cites Israel's unwillingness to withdraw from the territories and settlement expansion as the primary obstacle to peace in the Middle East.[455] The Carter family experienced another family peanut business dilemma when it accumulated a one-million-dollar debt in 1981. Former President Carter began writing books to pay off this debt. As of July 2019, he had \"published more than 30, from a children's book to reflections on his presidency\".[456] Carter's hobbies included painting,[457] fly fishing, woodworking, cycling, tennis, and skiing.[458] He also had an interest in poetry, particularly the works of Dylan Thomas.[459] During a state visit to the UK in 1977, Carter suggested that Thomas should have a memorial in Poets' Corner at Westminster Abbey;[460] this later came to fruition in 1982.[459][461] Carter was a personal friend of Elvis Presley, whom he and Rosalynn met on June 30, 1973, before Presley was to perform onstage in Atlanta.[462] They remained in contact by telephone two months before Presley's sudden death in August 1977. Carter later recalled an abrupt phone call received in June 1977 from Presley who sought a presidential pardon from Carter, to help George Klein's criminal case; at the time Klein had been indicted for only mail fraud, and was later found guilty of conspiracy.[463][464] According to Carter, Presley was almost incoherent because of barbiturates; although he phoned the White House several times again, this was the last time they spoke.[465] The day after Presley's death, Carter issued a statement and explained how he had \"changed the face of American popular culture\".[466] Carter filed a report with both the International UFO Bureau and the National Investigations Committee On Aerial Phenomena,[467] stating that he sighted an unidentified flying object in October 1969.[468][469][470] From a young age, Carter showed a deep commitment to evangelical Christianity.[471][472] Carter taught Sunday school at Maranatha Baptist Church in Plains, Georgia.[473] At a private inauguration worship service, the preacher was Nelson Price, the pastor of Roswell Street Baptist Church of Marietta, Georgia.[474] An evangelical Christian, Carter appealed to voters after the scandals of the Nixon Administration, and is credited with popularizing the term \"born again\" into American lexicon during the 1976 American presidential campaign.[472][475][476][477] As president, Carter prayed several times a day, and professed that Jesus was the driving force in his life. He was greatly influenced by a sermon he had heard as a young man that asked: \"If you were arrested for being a Christian, would there be enough evidence to convict you?\"[478] In 2000, after the Southern Baptist Convention announced it would no longer permit women to become pastors, he renounced his membership, saying: \"I personally feel that women should play an absolutely equal role in service of Christ in the church.\"[479] He remained a member of the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship.[471] Carter's support for the Equal Rights Amendment[480] led many evangelical conservatives to leave the Democratic Party, contributing to the development of the Christian right in American politics.[481] Carter had three younger siblings, all of whom died of pancreatic cancer: sisters Gloria Spann (1926‚Äì1990) and Ruth Stapleton (1929‚Äì1983), and brother Billy Carter (1937‚Äì1988).[482] He was first cousin to politician Hugh Carter and a distant cousin to the Carter family of musicians.[483] He was related to Motown founder Berry Gordy by way of their white great-grandfather James Thomas Gordy, who fathered a child with a black woman he enslaved.[484] Carter married Rosalynn Smith on July 7, 1946, in the Plains Methodist Church, the church of Rosalynn's family.[485] They had three sons, Jack, James III \"Chip\", and Donnel; one daughter, Amy; nine grandsons (one of whom is deceased), three granddaughters, five great-grandsons, and eight great-granddaughters.[486] Mary Prince (an African American woman wrongly convicted of murder, and later pardoned) was their daughter Amy's nanny for most of the period from 1971 until Jimmy Carter's presidency ended.[487][488][489] Carter had asked to be designated as her parole officer, thus helping to enable her to work in the White House.[488][e] The Carters celebrated their 77th anniversary on July 7, 2023. On October 19, 2019, they became the longest-wed presidential couple, having overtaken George and Barbara Bush at 26,765 days.[492] After Rosalynn's death on November 19, 2023, Carter released the following statement: Rosalynn was my equal partner in everything I ever accomplished. She gave me wise guidance and encouragement when I needed it. As long as Rosalynn was in the world, I always knew somebody loved and supported me.[493] The Carters' eldest son, Jack Carter, was the 2006 Democratic nominee for U.S. Senate in Nevada and lost to Republican incumbent John Ensign. Jack's son Jason Carter is a former Georgia state senator,[494] and in 2014 was the Democratic nominee for governor of Georgia, losing to the Republican incumbent, Nathan Deal. On December 20, 2015, while teaching a Sunday school class, Carter announced that his 28-year-old grandson Jeremy Carter had died of unspecified causes.[495] On August 3, 2015, Carter underwent an elective surgery to remove a small mass on his liver, and his prognosis for a full recovery was initially said to be excellent. On August 12, he announced he had been diagnosed with cancer that had metastasized, without specifying where the cancer had originated.[496] On August 20, Carter disclosed that melanoma had been found in his brain and liver, and that he had begun treatment with the immunotherapy drug pembrolizumab and was about to start radiation therapy. His healthcare was managed by Emory Healthcare of Atlanta. His family history of cancer includes both of his parents and all three of his siblings.[497] On December 5, he announced that his medical scans no longer showed any cancer.[498] Carter broke his hip in a fall at his Plains home on May 13, 2019, and underwent surgery the same day at the Phoebe Sumter Medical Center in Americus, Georgia.[499] On October 6, an injury above his left eyebrow received in another fall at home required 14 stitches[500] and resulted in a black eye.[501] On October 21, Carter was admitted to the Phoebe Sumter Medical Center after sustaining a minor pelvic fracture from falling at home for the third time in 2019.[502] He was able to resume teaching Sunday school at Maranatha Baptist Church on November 3.[503][504] On November 11, 2019, Carter was hospitalized at the Emory University Hospital in Atlanta for a procedure to relieve pressure on his brain caused by bleeding connected with his falls.[505][506] He was released from the hospital on November 27.[507][505] On December 2, 2019, Carter was readmitted to the hospital for a urinary tract infection. He was released on December 4.[508][509] On February 18, 2023, the Carter Center announced that following a \"series of short hospital stays\", Carter decided to \"spend his remaining time at home with his family\" in Plains to \"receive hospice care instead of additional medical intervention\"[510][511] for an unspecified illness.[512][513] At 100 years old, Carter was the longest-lived former U.S. president, a title he held until his passing.[514] He was the earliest-serving living former president since Gerald Ford's death in 2006. In 2012, he surpassed Herbert Hoover as the longest-retired president. In 2017 and 2021, Carter became the first president to live to the 40th anniversary of his inauguration and post-presidency respectively. In 2017, Carter, then 92, became the oldest former president ever to attend an American presidential inauguration.[515][516] On March 22, 2019, he became the longest-lived U.S. president, surpassing George H. W. Bush, who died a few months earlier at the age of 94 years, 171 days.[517] He said in a 2019 interview with People that he never expected to live as long as he had and that the best explanation for longevity was a good marriage.[518] Carter entered hospice care six months before celebrating his 99th birthday at his home.[519] The Carter Center announced Jimmy Carter 100: A Celebration in Song, an event concert to celebrate Carter's 100th birthday that featured appearances by musicians and celebrities. The event took place on September 17, 2024, at the Fox Theatre in Atlanta, Georgia.[520] On October 1, 2024, Carter turned 100, the first president to do so.[521] Local events to celebrate his birthday included a F-18 Super Hornet flyover formation by eight Navy pilots from Naval Air Station Oceana, which Carter viewed from his backyard, and a naturalization ceremony for 100 new citizens at Plains High School, which Chip Carter attended.[522][523] Carter made arrangements to be buried in front of his home at 209 Woodland Drive in Plains. In 2006, he said that a funeral in Washington, D.C., with visitation at the Carter Center, was also planned.[524] Carter asked President Biden to deliver his eulogy.[525] Carter died at his home in Plains, Georgia, on December 29, 2024, at the age of 100. His son, James E. Carter III, announced his death that afternoon.[526][527][528] This followed his February 2023 decision to enter hospice care.[529] Shortly after the announcement, President Joe Biden released a statement honoring Carter's legacy, calling him a \"man of principle, faith, and humility.\" The Biden administration also announced plans to hold an official state funeral, and a day of mourning for him on January 9, 2025.[530] When Carter left office in 1981, scholars and even many Democrats viewed his presidency as a failure.[531][532][533][534] Betty Glad, a political scientist at the University of Illinois, summarized the public consensus on Carter: \"he didn't have a well-developed political philosophy and gave people a feeling he didn't quite know where he was headed.\"[535] Historians have ranked Carter's presidency as below average.[536][537] After leaving office, he told allies he predicted history would be kinder to him than voters were in the 1980 election.[535] In a 1982 Chicago Tribune survey, when 49 historians and scholars were asked to rank the best and worst U.S. presidents, Carter was ranked the tenth worst.[538] In 2006, conservative British historian Andrew Roberts ranked Carter the worst U.S. president.[539] Yet some of Carter's policy accomplishments have been more favorably received.[540] The 2009 documentary Back Door Channels: The Price of Peace credits Carter's efforts at Camp David, which brought peace between Israel and Egypt, with bringing the only meaningful peace to the Middle East.[541][542] Stuart E. Eizenstat, who served as Carter's chief White House domestic policy adviser, wrote, \"Carter's accomplishments at home and abroad were more extensive and longer lasting than those of almost all modern presidents.\"[543] While historians generally consider Carter a below-average president, his post-presidency activities have been universally praised, including his peacekeeping and humanitarian efforts.[536][537] The Independent wrote in 2009, \"Carter is widely considered a better man than he was a president.\"[544] In exit polls from the 1976 presidential election, many voters still held Ford's pardon of Nixon in 1974 against him.[545] By comparison, Carter was viewed as a sincere, honest, and well-meaning southerner.[544] During his presidency, polls generally showed that most Americans saw Carter as likable and \"a man of high moral principles\".[546] In the 1980 election, Reagan projected an easy self-confidence, in contrast to Carter's serious and introspective temperament. Carter was portrayed as more pessimistic and indecisive than Reagan, who was known for his charm and delegation of tasks to subordinates.[547] Reagan used the economic issues, the Iran hostage crisis, and the lack of Washington cooperation to portray Carter as a weak and ineffectual leader. Carter was the first elected incumbent president since Herbert Hoover in 1932 to lose a reelection bid.[548] Carter began his presidency with an approval rating between 66% and 75%.[549][550] He maintained approval ratings above 50% until March 1978,[550] and the following month his approval rating fell to 39%,[551] primarily due to the declining economy.[552] His ratings briefly rebounded after the Camp David Accords in late 1978[553] but dipped during the 1979 energy crisis and got as low as 28% in July 1979.[554] At the beginning of the Iran hostage crisis, his approval rating surged to 61%, up 23 points from his pre-crisis rating.[555] Polls also found that up to 77% of Americans approved of Carter's initial response to the crisis,[555] but by June 1980, amid heated criticism from across the political spectrum[556] for his failure to free the hostages, his approval rating slumped to 33%; that same month Reagan surpassed Carter in pre-1980 election polling.[557] As Carter was leaving office, a Gallup poll found that 48% of Americans thought he had been an \"average\" or \"above average\" president, 46% said he had been \"below average\" or \"poor\", and only 3% thought he had been \"outstanding\".[558] His average approval rating during his entire presidency was 46%,[559][560] and he left office as one of the most unpopular U.S. presidents in history.[561] In a 1990 Gallup survey, 45% of respondents said they approved of the overall job Carter did as president, leaving only Nixon and Lyndon B. Johnson with lower ratings.[562] In a 2006 poll, 61% of respondents said they approved of the job Carter did as president, his highest rating since 1979.[563] The next year, a Gallup survey found that 69% of respondents had a favorable opinion of Carter.[564] Carter received the American Academy of Achievement's Golden Plate Award in 1984.[144] The Jimmy Carter Library and Museum was opened in 1986.[565] The following year, the Jimmy Carter National Historical Park was established as a National Historic Site[566] and in 2021, renamed as a national historical park.[567] In 1991, Carter was made an honorary member of Phi Beta Kappa at Kansas State University,[568] and was elected to the American Philosophical Society.[569] In 1998, the U.S. Navy named the third and final Seawolf-class submarine USS Jimmy Carter, honoring Carter and his service as a submarine officer.[570] Carter received the United Nations Prize in the Field of Human Rights, given in honor of human rights achievements,[571] and the Hoover Medal, recognizing engineers who have contributed to global causes.[572] Carter's 2002 Nobel Peace Prize[573] was partially a response to president George W. Bush's threats of war against Iraq and Carter's criticism of the Bush administration.[574] In 2009, the Souther Field Airport in Americus, Georgia, was renamed Jimmy Carter Regional Airport.[575] Carterpuri, a village in Haryana, India was renamed in the honour of Carter after his visit in January 1978.[576] In November 2024, Carter received his 10th nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album for audio recordings of his books. He has won three times‚Äîfor Our Endangered Values: America's Moral Crisis (2007), A Full Life: Reflections at 90 (2016), and Faith: A Journey For All (2018).[577][578][579][580][581][582] On February 21, 2024, the White House Historical Association unveiled its official 2024 White House Christmas ornament honoring Carter's naval service and efforts for peace. This was the first time a president being honored was alive at the time of the unveiling.[583]",

                "content": "James Earl Carter Jr. (October 1, 1924 ‚Äì December 29, 2024) was an American politician and philanthropist. He was the 39th president of the United States from 1977 to 1981. He was a member of the Democratic Party. Before becoming president, Carter was a Georgia state senator from 1963 to 1967 and the 80th governor of Georgia from 1971 to 1975. He was born and grew up in Plains, Georgia. Carter graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1946 with a Bachelor of Science degree and joined the United States Navy. In 1953, Carter left the military and returned home to Georgia to take charge of the family's peanut-growing business. Carter was against racial segregation and supported the growing civil rights movement. He became an activist in the Democratic Party. From 1963 to 1967, Carter was in the Georgia State Senate, and in 1970, he was elected as Governor of Georgia. He was governor until 1975. At first, he was not seen as a serious presidential candidate as not many people knew him outside of Georgia. Carter eventually won the 1976 Democratic presidential nomination and was elected president, beating then-Republican President Gerald Ford. On his second day in office, Carter pardoned all the Vietnam War draft evaders. During Carter's term as president, he created the Department of Energy and the Department of Education. He also created a national energy policy that included conservation, price control, and new technology. In foreign affairs, Carter helped create the Camp David Accords, the Panama Canal Treaties, the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT II), and the return of the Panama Canal Zone to Panama. However, the economy during his presidency was bad as it had stagflation, high inflation, high unemployment and slow economic growth. The end of his presidential term was remembered for the 1979‚Äì1981 Iran hostage crisis, the 1979 energy crisis, the Three Mile Island nuclear accident, and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. In 1980, Carter ran against Senator Ted Kennedy in the Democratic primaries and won re-nomination at the 1980 Democratic National Convention. Carter lost the 1980 presidential election. He lost to the Republican nominee Ronald Reagan, who won in a huge victory. Polls of historians and political scientists usually see Carter as an below-average president. He became more popular for his humanitarian work after leaving office. In 1982, Carter created the Carter Center to focus on human rights across the world. He traveled around the world to support peace talks, look over elections, and supported ending deadly diseases. In 2002, he won the Nobel Peace Prize. Carter was seen as an important person in the Habitat for Humanity charity. He wrote over 30 books from memoirs to poetry. Carter was the longest-lived president, the longest-retired president, the first to live forty years after their inauguration, and the first former president to reach the age of 100. Carter died on December 29, 2024 while in hospice care in Plains. Carter was born on October 1, 1924, at Lillian Carter Health and Rehabilitation in Plains, Georgia.[1] Carter was the first U.S. president to be born in a hospital.[2] He was the oldest son of Bessie Lillian (n√©e Gordy) and James Earl Carter Sr.[3] The family moved many times when Carter was an infant.[4] The Carters settled on a dirt road in nearby Archery.[5] His family eventually had three more children: Gloria, Ruth, and Billy.[6] Carter had a good relationship with his parents even though his mother worked long hours, about twenty hours every day.[7] His father supported segregation, which allowed Carter to become friends with his family farm's Black workers.[8] Carter went to Plains High School from 1937 to 1941.[9] He also joined the Future Farmers of America and liked woodworking.[10][11] He also played basketball during his high school years.[8] After high school, Carter went to Georgia Southwestern College, in Americus, Georgia.[12] He took extra math classes at Georgia Tech.[13] In 1943, Carter was accepted to the United States Naval Academy.[14] While at the academy, Carter fell in love with Rosalynn Smith.[15] The two married shortly after his graduation in 1946.[15] He was a sprint football player for the Navy Midshipmen.[16] Carter graduated 60th out of 820 midshipmen in the class of 1946 with a Bachelor of Science degree and became an ensign.[17][18] From 1946 to 1953, Carter and Rosalynn lived in Virginia, Hawaii, Connecticut, New York and California, during his time in the Atlantic and Pacific fleets.[18] In 1948, he began officers' training for being in a submarine.[18] He was promoted to lieutenant junior grade in 1949.[18] In 1952, Carter began his work with the US Navy's nuclear submarine program.[19] He was sent to the Naval Reactors Branch of the Atomic Energy Commission in Washington, D.C. for three month.[20] During this time, Rosalynn moved with their children to Schenectady, New York.[19][20] In March 1953, Carter began nuclear power school at Union College in Schenectady.[21] Carter's father died and he was released from active duty to allow him to take over the family peanut business.[22] Carter left active duty on October 9, 1953.[22] He was not active at the Navy Reserve until 1961, and left the service as a lieutenant.[23] His awards included the American Campaign Medal, World War II Victory Medal, China Service Medal, and National Defense Service Medal.[24] Carter's father, James died after having recently been elected to the Georgia House of Representatives.[25] For a year, Jimmy, Rosalynn, and their three sons lived in public housing in Plains.[26] Carter is the only U.S. president to have lived in public housing before he took office.[26] Carter wanted to expand the family's peanut-growing business.[27] His first-year harvest failed because of droughts, however Carter wanted to open many bank lines of credit to keep the farm going.[27] He also took classes and read on agriculture while Rosalynn learned accounting to manage the business.[28] Even though they struggled at first, the Carters grew the peanut business and became successful.[27][28] Carter, who was against racial segregation, was inspired to run for office over the racial tensions in the country.[29] By 1961 he was a known member of the Plains community and the Baptist Church as well as chairman of the Sumter County school board.[30] At the school board, Carter spoke against racial segregation in public schools.[30] In 1962, Carter announced his run for a seat in the Georgia State Senate.[31] At first, the results showed Carter losing, but this was the result of fraudulent voting done by the Democratic Party chairman in Quitman County.[32] Carter challenged the results; when fraud was confirmed, a new election was held, which he won.[31] Beginning in 1962, Americus was known where black protesters were hit and abused.[33] Carter did not say anything about this at first.[34] He did speak about some race issues such as giving speeches against literacy tests and against a change to the state constitution.[34] When President John F. Kennedy was assassinated, Carter called it \"the greatest blow that I had suffered since my father died\".[35] Two years later, Carter was in charge of the Democratic Executive Committee, where he helped rewrite the state party's rules.[36] He became chairman of the West Central Georgia Planning and Development Commission.[36] When Bo Callaway was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in November 1964, Carter wanted to run against him in the next election.[37] The two had fought over which two-year college would be expanded to a four-year college.[37] Carter wanted it to go to his alma mater, Georgia Southwestern College, but Callaway wanted the funding to go to downtown Columbus.[37] Carter was re-elected in 1964 to a second two-year term.[38] For a time in the State Senate, he was in charge of its Education Committee and also was part of the Appropriations Committee toward the end of his second term.[39] Before his term ended he worked on a bill expanding statewide education funding and getting Georgia Southwestern a four-year program.[40] The last day of the term, he announced his run for the United States House of Representatives.[41] Carter ran for the United States House of Representatives for Georgia's 3rd district in 1966 against Bo Callaway.[37] However, Callaway ended his campaign to run for Governor of Georgia.[37] Callaway became a Republican in 1964.[42] Carter later wanted to run for governor against Callaway.[37] In the Democratic primary, he ran against the liberal former Governor Ellis Arnall and the conservative Lester Maddox.[43] Governor Maddox was not allowed to run for a second term as governor in 1970.[44] Carter had to run against Carl Sanders in the 1970 Democratic primary.[45] Carter was more conservative than before during this primary election.[46] That September, Carter was beating Sanders in the first round by 49% to 38%.[47] Since no one won more than half the vote, they went into a second round.[47] Carter won the Democratic nomination with 59% of the vote against Sanders's 40%.[48] In the general election, Carter beat Republican candidate Hal Suit, winning 59% of the vote against Suit's 40%.[49] Carter became the 76th Governor of Georgia on January 12, 1971.[50] In his inaugural speech, he said that \"the time of racial discrimination is over. ... No poor, rural, weak, or black person should ever have to bear the additional burden of being [without] the opportunity for an education, a job or simple justice\".[50] Time ran a story on the progressive \"New South\" governors elected that year in a May 1971 cover.[51] The cover of the magazine had Carter.[51] Lester Maddox, who Carter replaced as governor, became lieutenant governor.[50] Richard Russell Jr., then President pro tempore of the United States Senate, died in office during Carter's second week in office.[52] Carter picked David H. Gambrell, state Democratic Party chair, to replace Russell's in the United States Senate.[52] Carter wanted to grow the governor's power while making the state government easier to run.[53] He supported a bill that could give him the power of executive restructuring and to force a vote on it.[53][54] The plan was not popular in the state legislature.[53] But after two weeks of talking about the plan, it was passed.[53] He lowered the number of state agencies from 300 to 22.[55] In April 1971, while on television, Carter was asked if he supported the idea of governor and lieutenant governor running together.[56] He said, \"I've never really thought we needed a lieutenant governor in Georgia. The lieutenant governor is part of the executive branch of government and I've always felt‚Äîever since I was in the state Senate‚Äîthat the executive branches should be separate\".[56] In July 1971, while in Columbus, Georgia, Carter created a Georgia Human Rights Council that would help solve issues in the state of any possible violence.[57] In January 1972, Carter wanted to give state money for an Early Childhood Development Program and prison reform programs.[58] In April 1972, Carter went to Latin and South America for a possible trade deal with Georgia.[59] Carter said that he had met with Brazilian President Em√≠lio Garrastazu M√©dici.[59] Many said he was acting like President Kennedy.[59] The number of black state workers, judges, and board members grew when Carter was governor.[60] He put paintings of Martin Luther King Jr. in the capitol building, while the Ku Klux Klan were at the ceremony protesting.[61] While on television with Governor of Florida Reubin Askew in January 1973, Carter said he supported a constitutional amendment to ban busing and to make desegregation in schools faster.[62] He supported an anti-busing plan with George Wallace at the 1971 National Governors Conference.[63][64] Carter signed a new death penalty law after the United States Supreme Court rejected it.[65] Carter later said he did not support the death penalty, saying, \"I didn't see the injustice of it as I do now\".[65] Carter wanted to give equal state aid to schools in the rich and poor areas of Georgia.[66] He helped create centers for mentally handicapped children and education programs for convicts.[67][68] He also wrote a program that made picking federal judges based on their experience over their political party possible.[69][70] In an unpopular move,[71] Carter rejected a plan to build a dam on Georgia's Flint River.[72] He said that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers was not giving the right numbers on the project's cost and possible harm on the region.[72] The veto became popular with environmentalists across the country.[72] Carter was not allowed to run for re-election because of term limits.[73] Wanting to run for president, Carter was active in national politics and public appearances.[74] He was a delegate to the 1972 Democratic National Convention, where Carter hoped he would be George McGovern's vice presidential pick.[74] He supported Senator Henry \"Scoop\" Jackson, to not support George Wallace.[75][76] In May 1973, Carter told the Democratic Party to not make the Watergate scandal a political issue.[77] On December 12, 1974, Carter announced his candidacy for President of the United States at National Press Club in Washington, D.C.[78] He talked about inequality, optimism, and change.[79][80] When Carter first announced his presidential run for the Democratic Party presidential nomination, he was seen as having little chances against better-known politicians.[81] However, by March 1976 Carter was doing better in polls against other candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination.[81] He was also ahead of President Ford by a few percentage points.[81] Carter wrote Why Not the Best? in June 1976 to help make his name known for the American public.[82] Carter won the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary.[81] In the South, Carter ran as a moderate and in the North, Carter ran as a conservative Christian.[83] He had visited 37 states, and gave over 200 speeches before any other candidate entered the race.[84] Carter ended up winning 30 states, with a total of 6,235,609 (39.2%) of the popular vote.[85] He was officially nominated as the Democratic nominee at the national convention.[86] He picked U.S. Senator Walter Mondale from Minnesota as his vice president pick.[86] During his presidential campaign in April 1976, Carter said to an interviewer, \"I have nothing against a community that is ... trying to maintain the ethnic purity of their neighborhoods\".[87] Carter said he understood why some neighborhoods were against desegregation.[87] However, he also supported open-housing laws that make it illegal not to sell or rent a house or apartment to a person based on their race.[87] His comments were unpopular with many Americans.[87] Carter's campaign supported congressional campaigns using public financing,[88] creating a federal agency for consumer protection,[89] creating a separate department for education,[90] signing an agreement that would stop the Soviet Union from using nuclear weapons,[91] lowering money given to the military,[92] increasing taxes for the rich and lowering them for the middle class,[93] supporting the Social Security Act,[94] and having a budget that would give money to government resources.[95] Carter and President Gerald Ford were in three televised debates during the 1976 election.[96] The debates were the first presidential debates since 1960.[96][97] Carter was interviewed by Robert Scheer of Playboy for the November 1976 issue, which hit the newsstands a couple of weeks before the election.[98] While discussing his religion's view of pride, Carter said: \"I've looked on a lot of women with lust. I've committed adultery in my heart many times\".[98][99] He also said in another interview that he did not mind if people said the word \"fuck\".[100] This led to a media to criticize the idea if politicians should be separated from their political campaigns and their private intimate lives.[100] Carter began the race with a lead over Ford, who narrowed the gap during the campaign, but lost to Carter in by a small margin on November 2, 1976.[101] Carter won the popular vote by 50.1 percent to 48.0 percent for Ford, and received 297 electoral votes to Ford's 240.[102] Carter won fewer states than Ford, with Carter winning 23 states compared to Ford winning 27.[102] Carter was inaugurated as president on January 20, 1977.[3] On April 18, 1977, Carter gave a televised speech saying that the U.S. energy crisis during the 1970s was like war.[103] He supported energy conservation by all Americans and added solar water heating panels on the White House.[104][105] He wore sweaters because he turned down the heat in the White House.[106] On August 4, 1977, Carter created the Department of Energy.[107] During the signing event, Carter said the current \"crisis of energy shortages\" made him create the Department of Energy.[108] Carter said that the House of Representatives had created many energy saving ideas.[109] A month later, on October 13, Carter stated he believed in the Senate's power to pass the energy reform bill.[110] He said that \"the most important domestic issue that we will face while I am in office\" was the energy crisis.[110] On January 12, 1978, during a press conference, Carter said plans about his energy reform proposal were not being made and that Congress was not being respectful.[111] In April 1978, Carter said his biggest surprise since becoming president was the how hard it was for Congress to pass an energy reform bill.[112] On March 1, 1979, Carter wanted to create a gasoline rationing plan with Congress approving it.[113] On April 5, he talked about how important energy conservation is.[114] At the end of the month, Carter said it was important that the Congress pass his gas rationing plan.[115] On July 15, 1979, Carter said the crisis was a \"crisis of confidence\" among the American people.[116][117] Many did not like Carter's speech.[118][119][120] People thought Carter for not doing enough to solve the crisis.[121] Many believed he wanted Americans to do most of the work instead of the government.[121] In 1978, Carter said the Love Canal accident in the city of Niagara Falls, New York was a federal emergency.[122] During the 1940s, the canal was used as the site to dump chemical products from dyes, perfumes, and solvents for rubber and synthetic resins.[123] More than 800 families were evacuated from the neighborhood, which was built on top of a toxic waste landfill.[122] The Superfund law was created because of Love Canal.[124] Carter said that many places like \"Love Canals\" existed across the country.[125] He said that discovering hazardous dumpsites was \"one of the [saddest] discoveries of our modern era\".[125] In 1979, the Environmental Protection Agency said that people living near the Love Canal accident were at risk for leukemia.[126][127][128] Carter had many problems with the economy when he became president.[129] He tried to continue the recovery from the severe 1973‚Äì75 recession.[130] His economy also had high inflation, with very high interest rates, oil shortages, and slow economic growth.[129] In his first two years, Carter created millions of new jobs.[131][132] The 1979 energy crisis ended job growth, however, and both inflation and interest rates rose.[133] Economic growth, job creation, and consumer confidence quickly went down.[133] There was also not a lot of gasoline because of the oil crisis.[134] Carter signed the Airline Deregulation Act into law on October 24, 1978.[135] The main purpose was to remove government control over fees, routes and airline market from commercial aviation.[135] The Civil Aeronautics Board's powers of regulation were removed.[135] The act did not remove the FAA's powers over airline safety.[136] In 1979, Carter deregulated the American beer industry by making it legal to sell malt, hops, and yeast to American home brewers for the first time since the beginning of Prohibition in the United States.[137] This led to an increase in home brewing over the 1980s and 1990s that by the 2000s.[138] During his presidential campaign, Carter wanted to fix healthcare in the country.[139] Carter's plans on healthcare included an April 1977 mandatory health care cost proposal,[140] and a June 1979 plan that gave private health insurance coverage.[141] Carter saw the June 1979 plan as a growing part of Medicare and Medicaid.[142][143] The April 1977 mandatory health care cost plan was passed in the Senate,[144] and later was not approved in the House.[145] During 1978, Carter also had meetings with Kennedy for a healthcare law that did not pass the U.S. House.[146] Carter later blamed Kennedy for his healthcare plans not being approved in Congress.[147] Carter worked with Congress to create an education department.[148] In February 1978, Carter said that education is very important and should not be in control over many departments.[149] On February 8, 1979, Carter released a plan to create an education department.[148] On October 17, 1979, Carter signed a law that created the United States Department of Education.[150] Carter grew the Head Start program by adding 43,000 children and families.[151] In a November 1980 speech, Carter said he would allow the Head Start to migrant children and wanted to increase building schools near the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border in Texas.[152] In September 1977, Carter and General Omar Torrijos signed the Panama Canal Treaty.[153] The treaties would give Panama control of the Panama Canal after 1999.[153] This would remove United States control of the canal.[153] The second treaty said that Panama would have full control of the canal.[153] The treaty was not popular with conservatives.[153] In September 1978, Carter created many political agreements between Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin at Camp David.[154] The two agreements were signed at the White House.[154] The second of these frameworks helped create the 1979 Egypt‚ÄìIsrael Peace Treaty.[155] Carter spoke to African officials at the United Nations about his support of democratic elections and power in African countries.[156] Carter later said his plans for wanting \"to work with South Africa in dealing with the threats to peace in Namibia and in Zimbabwe\" and to end racial issues like apartheid.[157] Carter visited Nigeria from March 31 to April 3, 1978, trying to fix relations with the country.[158] He was the first U.S. president to visit Nigeria.[159] Carter wanted to create peace in Rhodesia.[160] On May 16, 1979, the Senate voted in favor of President Carter ending economic sanctions against Rhodesia.[161] In November 1977, Carter said he wanted to have a good partnership between the United States and Iran.[162] In November 1979, a group of Iranian students took over the United States Embassy in Tehran.[163] The students were in support of the Iranian Revolution.[163] 52 Americans were held hostage for the next 444 days until they were freed on January 20, 1981.[164] They were freed on the day Ronald Reagan replaced Carter as president.[164] During the crisis, Carter never left the White House for more than 100 days.[165] In December 1979, Carter said he wanted to solve the issue without using the military or violence.[166] On April 7, 1980, Carter passed Executive Order 12205, adding economic sanctions against Iran[167] and announced more action to make sure the hostages were released safely.[168][169] On April 24, 1980, Carter pushed for Operation Eagle Claw to try to free the hostages.[170] The mission failed as military helicopters crashed killing eight American military people.[170][171] Whistleblowers have said that people working on Ronald Reagan's campaign convinced Iran to not release the hostages to make sure Carter was not re-elected.[172] On February 8, 1977, Carter said he had wanted the Soviet Union to work with the United States to stop nuclear testing.[173] During a June 13 meeting, Carter said that the United States would begin to talk to the Soviet Union about demilitarization of the Indian Ocean.[174] On December 30, Carter said that the United States and the Soviet Union have made great progress on talking about important issues.[175] These talks helped create the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty II by Carter and Leonid Brezhnev on June 18, 1979.[176][177] Nur Muhammad Taraki and other Communists took power in Afghanistan on April 27, 1978.[178] Following an uprising in April 1979, Taraki was removed by Khalq rival Hafizullah Amin in September.[179] By December, Amin's government had lost control of much of the country.[178] This caused the Soviet Union to invade Afghanistan.[178] Carter was surprised by the invasion.[180] The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan was seen as a threat and Carter saw the Soviet Union as dangerous.[181] Carter announced sanctions on the Soviet Union.[181][182] He created an embargo on grain to the Soviet Union.[183][184] Carter also supported not taking part of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow.[185] British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher supported Carter's actions towards the Soviet Union.[186] In early 1980, Carter created a program to arm the mujahideen.[187] The Soviets were unable to fight off them off and left Afghanistan in 1989.[187] In March 1977, Carter supported removing American troops from South Korea.[188] He wanted South Korea to have their own military forces to protect themselves from North Korea.[188] Carter's move to remove the troops was unpopular with military officials.[189] In May, Carter said he believed South Korea would be able to defend themselves without as many American troops.[190] From June 30 to July 1, 1979, Carter had meetings with President of South Korea Park Chung-hee at the Blue House.[191] Carter said that the liberal part of the Democratic Party did not support his policies the most.[192] He said they were caused by Senator Ted Kennedy's plan to replace him as president.[192] Kennedy announced his plans to run for president in November 1979.[193][194][195] Kennedy did not run a good campaign and Carter won most of the primaries.[196] Carter won the Democratic re-nomination, however, Kennedy gave Carter weak support from the Liberal Democrats in the general election.[196] Carter and Vice President Walter Mondale were nominated at the Democratic National Convention in New York City.[197] Carter's campaign for re-election in 1980 was not easy as he ran against Republican Ronald Reagan.[198] His campaign manager and former appointments secretary, Timothy Kraft, left the campaign five weeks before the election because of possible cocaine use.[199] On October 28, Carter and Reagan had the only presidential debate of the election.[200] Reagan was losing to Carter at first,[201] but after the debates, Reagan became popular.[202] Carter lost his re-election to Reagan in a landslide victory.[198] Reagan won 489 of the electoral votes and Carter won 49.[198] After the election, Carter said that he was hurt by the outcome of the election.[203] Shortly after losing his re-election bid, Carter told the White House press corps that he wanted his retirement to be similar than that of Harry S. Truman and not use his public life to make himself rich.[204] In October 1986, his presidential library was opened in Atlanta, Georgia.[205] At aged 88, Carter built homes in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy,[206] and partnered with former presidents to work with One America Appeal to help the victims of Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma in the Gulf Coast and Texas communities.[207] Carter went to the opening ceremonies of his presidential library[205] and those of Presidents Ronald Reagan,[208] George H. W. Bush,[209] Bill Clinton,[210][211] and George W.

Bush, Carter was against the Iraq War.[249] He believed Bush wanted to remove Saddam Hussein by using lies.[250] In May 2007, Carter stated the Bush administration \"has been the worst in history\" in terms of its impact in foreign affairs,[251] Carter did not support Bush administration's handling of Hurricane Katrina.[252] Though he supported President Barack Obama in the early part of his presidency,[253] Carter criticized his use of drone strikes against suspected terrorists, Obama's choice to keep Guantanamo Bay detention camp open,[254] and use of surveillance programs.[255][256] In July 2016, Carter announced his support of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's presidential nomination during the 2016 Democratic National Convention.[257] Carter said that the 2016 election would \"define the US for a generation\".[257] He originally supported Vermont U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders and voted for him during the primaries in 2016.[258] During the Donald Trump presidency, Carter supported immigration reform through Congress,[259] and did not support Trump's response during the national anthem protests.[260] In September 2019, Carter said he would support an \"age-limit\" for presidential candidates.[258] In August 2020, he supported former Vice President Joe Biden for president during a video played at the 2020 Democratic National Convention.[261] In October 2024, weeks after turning 100, Carter voted for Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election by absentee ballot.[262] Carter and Rosalynn Smith had three sons, one daughter, eight grandsons, three granddaughters, and two great-grandsons.[263][264][265] Carter and Rosalynn were well known for their work as volunteers with Habitat for Humanity.[266] Carter's hobbies included painting,[267] fly-fishing, woodworking, cycling, tennis, and skiing.[268] He also liked poetry.[269] Carter was also a personal friend of Elvis Presley.[270] Carter and Rosalynn met him on June 30, 1973, before Presley was to perform onstage in Atlanta.[270] The day after Presley's death, Carter issued a statement and explained how he had \"changed the face of American popular culture\".[271] In 2000, Carter ended his membership with the Southern Baptist Convention, saying the group's ideas did not support with his Christian beliefs.[272] Carter became the oldest to ever attend a presidential inauguration in 2017, at age 92, and the first to live to the 40th anniversary of their own.[273][274] Two years later, on March 22, 2019, he became the nation's longest-lived president.[275] On October 1, 2019, Carter became the first U.S. president to live to the age of 95.[276] In May 2023, it was announced that his wife Rosalynn had dementia.[277][278] She entered hospice care alongside her husband on November 17, 2023,[279] and died two days later at the age of 96.[280] He went to her funeral in Atlanta on November 28 alongside all living former first ladies, former President Bill Clinton and President Joe Biden.[281] She was buried at their home that they built, where Carter also planned to be buried.[282] On October 1, 2024, Carter turned 100, the first president to do so.[283][284] On August 3, 2015, Carter had surgery to remove \"a small mass\" on his liver. On August 12, however, Carter announced he had been diagnosed with cancer that had metastasized.[285] On August 20, he said that melanoma had been found in his brain and liver.[286] On December 6, 2015, Carter said that his medical scans no longer showed any cancer.[287] On May 13, 2019, Carter broke his hip at his Plains home and had surgery in Americus, Georgia.[288] On October 6, 2019, Carter got 14 stitches above his left eyebrow after injuring it during another fall at home.[289] A few weeks later, Carter was hospitalized after having a minor pelvic fracture after falling again at home.[290] A month after his fall, Carter was hospitalized in November at the Emory University Hospital in Atlanta to relieve pressure on his brain.[291] The surgery was successful, and Carter was released from the hospital on November 27.[292][293] In February 2021, it was announced that Carter and his wife both received their doses of the COVID-19 vaccine.[294] In late February 2023, Carter stopped medical treatment and started hospice care at home.[295] He was being treated for an \"aggressive form\" of melanoma.[296] On March 13, 2023 it was revealed by President Joe Biden that Carter had asked him to deliver his eulogy after his death.[297] His grandson said in June 2024 that Carter is no longer awake every day.[298] Two months later, Carter said he hoped to vote for the Democratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, in the 2024 presidential election.[299] Later that month, his grandson said that Carter was really sick, although he hoped to turn 100 years old and vote to in the 2024 election.[300] Carter died at his home in Plains on December 29, 2024, almost three months after his 100th birthday.[301][302][303] Shortly after his death, President Joe Biden honored Carter's legacy, calling him a \"man of principle, faith, and humility.\"[304] President-elect Donald Trump and former Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama also paid tribute to Carter after his death.[305] A state funeral will be held on January 9, 2025 at the Washington National Cathedral.[306][307] Carter will be buried at his home in Plains next to his wife Rosalynn.[307] Carter's presidency was at first seen as unpopular in historical rankings of American presidents.[308][309][310] Although his presidency was unpopular, his peace and humanitarian works since he left office have made Carter one of the most popular former presidents in American history.[311][312] Carter's presidency was seen by scholars and many Democrats as a failure.[313][314][315][316] In a 1982 Chicago Tribune survey, when 49 historians and scholars were asked to rank the best and worst U.S. presidents, Carter was ranked the 10th worst.[317][318] The documentary Back Door Channels: The Price of Peace (2009) says that Carter's works at Camp David, which brought peace between Israel and Egypt, with bringing the only meaningful peace to the Middle East.[319][320] His post-presidency activities have been more popular with The Independent saying that \"Carter is widely considered a better man than he was a president.\"[321] His presidential approval numbers was just 31 percent before the 1980 election, but 64 percent approved of his presidency in a 2009 poll.[322] In Gallup's ratings of previous U.S. presidents, Carter's presidency had a favorability rating of 45% in 1990, which was below most other presidents and left only Richard Nixon and Lyndon B. Johnson with lower ratings.[323] In a 2018 retrospective poll, Carter's presidency received a 55% favorability rating, its highest since 1980.[324] Carter has had many awards since his presidency. In 1998, the U.S. Navy named the third and last Seawolf-class submarine honoring former President Carter and his service as a submariner officer.[325] That year he also received the United Nations Human Rights Prize, given in honor of human rights achievements,[326] and the Hoover Medal.[327] He won the 2002 Nobel Peace Prize.[328] Carter has been nominated ten times for the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album for audio recordings of his books, and has won three times in 2007, 2016 and 2019.[329][330][331][332] In November 2024, at age 100, Carter got his tenth nomination.[333] This made him the oldest nominee ever.[333] The Souther Field Airport in Americus, Georgia was renamed Jimmy Carter Regional Airport in 2009.[334] Death and state funeral of Jimmy Carter Dunant / Passy (1901) ¬∑ Ducommun / Gobat (1902) ¬∑ Cremer (1903) ¬∑ IDI (1904) ¬∑ Suttner (1905) ¬∑ Roosevelt (1906) ¬∑ Moneta / Renault (1907) ¬∑ Arnoldson / Bajer (1908) ¬∑ Beernaert / Estournelles de Constant (1909) ¬∑ IPB (1910) ¬∑ Asser / Fried (1911) ¬∑ Root (1912) ¬∑ La Fontaine (1913) ¬∑ International Committee of the Red Cross (1917) ¬∑ Wilson (1919) ¬∑ Bourgeois (1920) ¬∑ Branting / Lange (1921) ¬∑ Nansen (1922) ¬∑ Chamberlain / Dawes (1925) Briand / Stresemann (1926) ¬∑ Buisson / Quidde (1927) ¬∑ Kellogg (1929) ¬∑ S√∂derblom (1930) ¬∑ Addams / Butler (1931) ¬∑ Angell (1933) ¬∑ Henderson (1934) ¬∑ Ossietzky (1935) ¬∑ Lamas (1936) ¬∑ Cecil (1937) ¬∑ Nansen Office (1938) ¬∑ International Committee of the Red Cross (1944) ¬∑ Hull (1945) ¬∑ Balch / Mott (1946) ¬∑ QPSW / AFSC (1947) ¬∑ Boyd Orr (1949) ¬∑ Bunche (1950) Jouhaux (1951) ¬∑ Schweitzer (1952) ¬∑ Marshall (1953) ¬∑ UNHCR (1954) ¬∑ Pearson (1957) ¬∑ Pire (1958) ¬∑ Noel‚ÄëBaker (1959) ¬∑ Lutuli (1960) ¬∑ Hammarskj√∂ld (1961) ¬∑ Pauling (1962) ¬∑ International Committee of the Red Cross / League of Red Cross Societies (1963) ¬∑ King (1964) ¬∑ UNICEF (1965) ¬∑ Cassin (1968) ¬∑ ILO (1969) ¬∑ Borlaug (1970) ¬∑ Brandt (1971) ¬∑ Kissinger / Le (1973) ¬∑ MacBride / Sato (1974) ¬∑ Sakharov (1975) B.Williams / Corrigan (1976) ¬∑ AI (1977) ¬∑ Sadat / Begin (1978) ¬∑ Mother Teresa (1979) ¬∑ Esquivel (1980) ¬∑ UNHCR (1981) ¬∑ Myrdal / Garc√≠a Robles (1982) ¬∑ Wa≈Çƒôsa (1983) ¬∑ Tutu (1984) ¬∑ IPPNW (1985) ¬∑ Wiesel (1986) ¬∑ Arias (1987) ¬∑ UN Peacekeeping Forces (1988) ¬∑ Dalai Lama (1989) ¬∑ Gorbachev (1990) ¬∑ Suu Kyi (1991) ¬∑ Mench√∫ (1992) ¬∑ Mandela / de Klerk (1993) ¬∑ Arafat / Peres / Rabin (1994) ¬∑ Pugwash Conferences / Rotblat (1995) ¬∑ Belo / Ramos-Horta (1996) ¬∑ ICBL / J.Williams (1997) ¬∑ Hume / Trimble (1998) ¬∑ M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res (1999) ¬∑ Kim (2000) UN / Annan (2001) ¬∑ Carter (2002) ¬∑ Ebadi (2003) ¬∑ Maathai (2004) ¬∑ IAEA / ElBaradei (2005) ¬∑ Yunus / Grameen Bank (2006) ¬∑ Gore / IPCC (2007) ¬∑ Ahtisaari (2008) ¬∑ Obama (2009) ¬∑ Xiaobo (2010) ¬∑ Sirleaf / Gbowee / Karman (2011) ¬∑ EU (2012) ¬∑ Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (2013) ¬∑ Yousafzai / Satyarthi (2014) ¬∑ Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet (2015) ¬∑ Juan Manuel Santos (2016) ¬∑ International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (2017) ¬∑ Mukwege / Murad (2018) ¬∑ Ahmed (2019) ¬∑ World Food Programme (2020) ¬∑ Ressa / Muratov (2021) ¬∑ Bialiatski / Memorial / Center for Civil Liberties (2022) ¬∑ Mohammadi (2023) ¬∑ Nihon Hidankyo (2024)",

                "content": "The White House 1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW Washington, DC 20500 The 39th President of the United States The biography for President Carter and past presidents is courtesy of the White House Historical Association. Jimmy Carter served as the 39th President of the United States from 1977 to 1981. He was awarded the 2002 Nobel Peace Prize for work to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts, to advance democracy and human rights, and to promote economic and social development. Jimmy Carter aspired to make Government ‚Äúcompetent and compassionate,‚Äù responsive to the American people and their expectations. His achievements were notable, but in an era of rising energy costs, mounting inflation, and continuing tensions, it was impossible for his administration to meet these high expectations. Carter, who has rarely used his full name‚ÄìJames Earl Carter, Jr.‚Äìwas born October 1, 1924, in Plains, Georgia. Peanut farming, talk of politics, and devotion to the Baptist faith were mainstays of his upbringing. Upon graduation in 1946 from the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, Carter married Rosalynn Smith. The Carters have three sons, John William (Jack), James Earl III (Chip), Donnel Jeffrey (Jeff), and a daughter, Amy Lynn. After seven years‚Äô service as a naval officer, Carter returned to Plains. In 1962 he entered state politics, and eight years later he was elected Governor of Georgia. Among the new young southern governors, he attracted attention by emphasizing ecology, efficiency in government, and the removal of racial barriers. Carter announced his candidacy for President in December 1974 and began a two-year campaign that gradually gained momentum. At the Democratic Convention, he was nominated on the first ballot. He chose Senator Walter F. Mondale of Minnesota as his running mate. Carter campaigned hard against President Gerald R. Ford, debating with him three times. Carter won by 297 electoral votes to 241 for Ford. Carter worked hard to combat the continuing economic woes of inflation and unemployment. By the end of his administration, he could claim an increase of nearly eight million jobs and a decrease in the budget deficit, measured in percentage of the gross national product. Unfortunately, inflation and interest rates were at near record highs, and efforts to reduce them caused a short recession. Carter could point to a number of achievements in domestic affairs. He dealt with the energy shortage by establishing a national energy policy and by decontrolling domestic petroleum prices to stimulate production. He prompted Government efficiency through civil service reform and proceeded with deregulation of the trucking and airline industries. He sought to improve the environment. His expansion of the national park system included protection of 103 million acres of Alaskan lands. To increase human and social services, he created the Department of Education, bolstered the Social Security system, and appointed record numbers of women, blacks, and Hispanics to Government jobs. In foreign affairs, Carter set his own style. His championing of human rights was coldly received by the Soviet Union and some other nations. In the Middle East, through the Camp David agreement of 1978, he helped bring amity between Egypt and Israel. He succeeded in obtaining ratification of the Panama Canal treaties. Building upon the work of predecessors, he established full diplomatic relations with the People‚Äôs Republic of China and completed negotiation of the SALT II nuclear limitation treaty with the Soviet Union. There were serious setbacks, however. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan caused the suspension of plans for ratification of the SALT II pact. The seizure as hostages of the U. S. embassy staff in Iran dominated the news during the last 14 months of the administration. The consequences of Iran‚Äôs holding Americans captive, together with continuing inflation at home, contributed to Carter‚Äôs defeat in 1980. Even then, he continued the difficult negotiations over the hostages. Iran finally released the 52 Americans the same day Carter left office.

In the Navy he became a submariner, serving in both the Atlantic and Pacific fleets and rising to the rank of lieutenant. Chosen by Admiral Hyman Rickover for the nuclear submarine program, he was assigned to Schenectady, New York, where he took graduate work at Union College in reactor technology and nuclear physics and served as senior officer of the pre-commissioning crew of the Seawolf, the second nuclear submarine. On July 7, 1946, he married Rosalynn Smith of Plains. When his father died in 1953, he resigned his naval commission and returned with his family to Georgia. He took over the Carter farms, and he and Rosalynn operated Carter's Warehouse, a general-purpose seed and farm supply company in Plains. He quickly became a leader of the community, serving on county boards supervising education, the hospital authority, and the library. In 1962 he won election to the Georgia Senate.

He championed human rights throughout the world. On the domestic side, the administration's achievements included a comprehensive energy program conducted by a new Department of Energy; deregulation in energy, transportation, communications, and finance; major educational programs under a new Department of Education; and major environmental protection legislation, including the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, which doubled the size of the national park system and tripled the wilderness areas.

                "content": "Love would find Heath in the end zone just a few minutes later and the Packers had a real chance after cutting the lead to two in the final couple minutes of the game. MIN got the ball back and made a couple of gutsy calls to pass on plays that moved the chains and kept the clock running until the were able to kneel it and move to 14-2 on the year. That sets up an all or nothing finish to the regular season next week against the Detroit Lions. It's this simple: The winner gets the one seed and home field advantage, while the other gets the Wild Card and will most likely have to play all of their games on the road. The Packers turned it on in the final few minutes but it was much too little too late. Emanuel Wilson punched in the TD to give the Packers hope with just over 6 minutes to go. The Vikings responded with a professional drive to take back control of the game and stretch the lead back to a three possession game. Former Packer, Aaron Jones, carried the Vikes down field and set up this 9 yard TD for Cam Akers on the screen pass. Jones had 47 yards on 12 carries and Darnold finished the day with 3 TDs in another game that he had a +100 rating. Josh Jacobs was the only one producing on the offensive end for the Packers in the first three quarters, and he finally got into the end zone just a few plays after the Vikings only TO of the game. He ended the night with 69 yards, but almost all of those came in the first half. Just when it seemed like the Vikes were going to run away with it, Darnold made his only mistake of the game. He got picked off by Carrington Valentine and that gave the Packers a glimmer of hope for the final quarter and a half. The Packers would get held out of the end zone for the first 30 minutes and the Vikings stretched the lead out to 10 before the break. Coming out of the break, Minnesota stretched the lead out to a three possession advantage with another perfect pass from Darnold, this time to Jordan Addison. For some reason there are a lot of people who were doubting the Vikings, myself included. Maybe it's because they have a QB who has never been in this situation before, but Sam Darnold continues to show up in big games and in big moments and make big plays. He hit Jalen Nailor on the opening TD of the game with this beautiful 31 yard dime. The Minnesota Vikings are still in the hunt for the top seed in the NFC after a narrow win over the Green Bay Packers. Sam Darnold threw for 377 yards and 3 TDs in the 27-25 win.

They do this often, lets see if they can get a quick TD early on. While all of the spotlight has been on Saquon Barkley and Derrick Henry who swapped teams this offseason, Josh Jacobs should be getting just as much love. He is the fourth leading rusher in the league, with 1,216 yards and has 13 rushing TDs which is tied for second most in the league. The Packers let Aaron Jones go and picked up the league‚Äôs former leading rusher and it looks like the gamble is paying off. Sam Darnold was a forgotten quarterback after years of voyaging around the NFL for years. He was named the starter and no one could have expected him to have as much success as he‚Äôs having this year. He has thrown for 3,776 yards which is good enough for 7th in the league and his 32 TDs are 5th in the league but more importantly he has the Vikings in prime position to get the one seed in the NFC. We had no clue what to expect from the Vikings after letting Kirk Cousins go, but they put Sam Darnold in at QB1. All they did was be the last undefeated team in the league going 5-0 to start the season, but would lose two in a row against the Lions and the Rams and everyone thought the Vikings dream season was over. Since then they have won eight straight, but five of those came in one possession games. For a two win team, there are still some doubts surrounding this team, but if they win out in their final two games against the Packers and the Lions they get the top seed in the NFC. There was a lot expected of the Packers coming into this season after Green Bay went to the playoffs in Jordan Love‚Äôs first season as the QB1. They went to Brazil to start the game and lost to the Eagles and lost Love for a couple weeks to injury but Malik Willis manned the ship and led them to two wins his absence. Love returned for the Vikings game in Week 4, but they would lose that game by just 2 points. They would win 7 of their next 8 losing to the Lions once during that span and then again three weeks ago. The Packers have shown they are a good team but they have yet to beat a top team in the NFC. All four of their losses came to teams that are ahead of them in the NFC. Minnesota went in to Seattle and went back and forth with the Seahawks until the final tick of the clock. Sam Darnold threw two first half TDs to Jordan Addison and Justin Jefferson but Geno Smith matched that with a couple TD passes of his own but Minnesota went to half with a 17-14 lead. After a couple field goals on each side the Vikings led 20-17 heading into the 4th quarter, but Smith would put the home side up 24-20 with just 4:21 to go, but Sam Darnold would answer with a 39 yard bomb to Justin Jefferson just a minute later. Seattle would get two chances to tie or take the lead but they missed a field goal and Smith got intercepted for the second time to end the game. It was a bloodbath in the Frozen Tundra as the Packers hosted an injury plagued New Orleans team. Green Bay received the ball to start the game and dominated from the start to finish. They scored on their first three drives of the night going up 21-0 and didn‚Äôt look back from there. Jordan Love had 182 yards and a TD on 16/28 passing and the ground game combined for 188 yards as the starters got to sit and watch most of the 4th quarter as the Pack cruised to a 34-0 win. Hello everyone and welcome to Minnesota where both of these two teams are in the playoffs, but both are looking to improve their playoff position in the final two weeks of the season. The Vikings have chance for one seed if they win out but they have two tough games to finish the season starting with today‚Äôs match up against the Packers. Green Bay are coming off of their most complete game of the season and the first shutout of the NFL season against a banged up Saints team, but today‚Äôs matchup in Minnesota is going to be a whole other ball game. We have a massive matchup with all sorts of playoff implications from US Bank Stadium this afternoon. Two top teams in the conference, two division rivals and two teams gearing up for a deep postseason run will meet in Minnesota where there will be a playoff like atmosphere. It‚Äôs the Vikings hosting the Green Bay Packers and AS English will be with you all day long providing live coverage, stats, highlights and analysis of today‚Äôs Game of the Week on this penultimate Sunday of the season.",

                "title": "Game recap: 5 takeaways from Packers‚Äô loss to Vikings",
                "content": "packers.com editor MINNEAPOLIS ‚Äì The Packers fell way behind and then rallied late, but it wasn't enough in a 27-25 defeat to the Vikings on Sunday at U.S. Bank Stadium. Here are five takeaways from the tough loss: Because the Vikings, after the Packers scored two touchdowns for 15 points to cut a 17-point deficit to two, got two first downs to run out the clock. The second one was converted on a third-and-3, the Packers' last chance to get the ball back, and QB Sam Darnold floated a pass in the flat that running back Cam Akers caught above his shoetops while falling backwards. The Vikings went into victory formation and the comeback went for naught. \"Our guys continue to fight and scratch and claw, but we just can't put ourselves in a hole like that,\" Head Coach Matt LaFleur said. \"It took too long to get going offensively, and that was the result.\" A fumble on the game's opening drive, a failed fourth down in scoring territory, two illegal formation flags that wiped out first downs, a 12-men-in-the-huddle penalty, and an offside on a missed field goal that gave the Vikings another crack at the kick on the final play of the first half ‚Ä¶ it all added up to a frustrating afternoon and, in the end, too much to overcome. LaFleur clearly disagreed with one of the illegal formation calls, as well as the offside on the field goal, but to no avail. Those occurred on back-to-back possessions late in the first half that helped end a Green Bay drive and give Minnesota three points for a 13-3 lead at intermission. The deficit then got worse when the Vikings scored a TD to open the second half. \"I'm not going to make excuses for it,\" LaFleur said of the flags. \"They saw it differently.\" Green Bay's defense was already shorthanded in the secondary due to injuries and then lost safety Zayne Anderson to a concussion early from a tackle on kickoff coverage. The thinning depth in the back end wasn't helped by a pass rush that struggled to get to Darnold, who was rarely pressured and sacked just once in 43 pass attempts. He completed an efficient 33 for 377 yards and three TDs, with one INT, for a 116.1 rating, generating several big gains downfield. \"You've got to get pressure on these guys if they're going to drop back that many times,\" LaFleur said. \"If you don't, it's going to be a long day. \"They've got a lot of weapons.\" Indeed, on a day the Packers stopped the Vikings' ground game for the most part (23 carries for 72 yards, not including kneel-downs), four pass catchers each compiled 68 or more yards for Darnold, led by Justin Jefferson with eight catches for 92 yards. Cornerback Carrington Valentine's interception in the third quarter set up running back Josh Jacobs' rushing touchdown to make it 20-10. Jacobs, who overcame the early fumble to gain 69 yards on 17 carries, scored a rushing TD for the seventh straight game, tying Paul Hornung's franchise record set in 1960. But the Vikings came right back with a touchdown to resume their 17-point lead. The Packers finally got going on offense, but it was sitting with just those 10 points through 3¬Ω quarters that they most regret. LaFleur and QB Jordan Love discussed the Vikings playing more man coverage than they anticipated and the Packers being slow to adjust. But the other mistakes factored into missed chances, too, and the Packers were well under 200 yards of total offense until their two fourth-quarter TD drives. \"It's tough,\" said Love, who was 19-of-30 for 185 yards with a TD (to Malik Heath) and 91.7 rating. \"Obviously it ended up being a close game, but we know it's hard when you put yourself in a hole and are down early and shooting yourself in the foot. \"It's hard to get out of that hole, and when it's a good team like the Vikings that makes it even tougher.\" The loss dropped the Packers to 11-5 and took the No. 5 seed out of play for Green Bay. The Vikings improved to 14-2 and have a shot at the NFC's No. 1 seed and first-round bye when they play the Lions in the regular-season finale. Green Bay's seed will be determined, in part, by how Washington fares. The Commanders are also 11-5 following their Sunday night overtime win over the Falcons, and if they win in Week 18 over the Cowboys, they will be the No. 6 seed and the Packers will get the No. 7. If the Packers win and the Commanders lose, Green Bay gets the No. 6 seed. Regardless, the Packers already knew they'd have to be road warriors in the postseason, and that won't change no matter what happens against the Bears next week. \"That's going to be our reality,\" Love said. \"We're going to have to find ways when the playoffs start to go into these road atmospheres and win.\" Regrets galore upon return from Minnesota Week 18 to determine Green Bay's playoff seeding Team knows it's up to them to change the narrative after fourth division loss Green Bay's second-half rally not enough vs. Vikings It's almost do-or-die time Late rally by Green Bay comes up short Follow the Green Bay Packers vs. Minnesota Vikings game with live updates from U.S. Bank Stadium Team will rotate captains on a weekly basis Rookie safety back after missing last two games for Packers Green Bay Packers vs. Minnesota Vikings channel listing, radio & streaming options Green Bay announces roster move ahead of Sunday's matchup vs. Vikings COPYRIGHT ¬© GREEN BAY PACKERS, INC.",

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. MINNEAPOLIS -- The Minnesota Vikings got a big lead on the rival Green Bay Packers back in September, going up 28-0 before nearly coughing up the advantage entirely. Three months later, they offered up a sequel for the U.S. Bank Stadium crowd, nearly surrendering a 27-10 fourth-quarter lead before outlasting their NFC North rivals for a critical 27-25 victory, their ninth straight on the 2024 season. Sam Darnold turned in an MVP-caliber performance to help Minnesota dominate much of the afternoon, while Brian Flores' defense suffocated Jordan Love and Co. until the final quarter, when Green Bay surged back to life thanks to a couple of surgical drives through the air. Vikings kicker Will Reichard also contributed to the game's close finish, missing two of four field goals while also failing to hit the landing zone on a kickoff, granting the Packers favorable field position. Sunday's anticipated showdown started slowly, with both sides trading stingy defensive stands, but Darnold settled in after feeding speedy wide receiver Jalen Nailor, who saw an uptick in opportunities with Green Bay zeroing in on star pass catcher Justin Jefferson. From there, he had little trouble spreading the ball to the array of weapons in Kevin O'Connell's lineup, with Jefferson, Jordan Addison and T.J. Hockenson all corralling at least five catches against a \"D\" missing star corner Jaire Alexander. Flores' group, meanwhile, all but rendered the Packers' pass game a non-factor early. Missing deep threat Christian Watson, Love managed just 45 yards through the air in the game's first two quarters, and while bruising back Josh Jacobs had a heavy workload up the middle, Green Bay spent most of the rematch playing catch-up. Things finally clicked late, with Love guiding a pair of fourth-quarter touchdown drives while feeding Romeo Doubs, but it was too little, too late. The win bumps the Vikings to 14-2 on the season and sets up a winner-take-all against the Lions in Week 18 for the NFC North title and home-field advantage. It also drops the Packers to 11-5 in the North. Take your pick of Darnold's pretty throws, basically. This one to Addison helped give Minnesota a 20-3 advantage, showcasing the quarterback's steadiness as a pocket-climber and downfield thrower: The Vikings (14-2) will close their 2024 season with a pivotal Week 18 rematch in Detroit, where they'll fight the Lions (13-2) for the No. 1 seed in the NFC playoffs, plus the NFC North crown. The Packers (11-5), meanwhile, will finish their regular season against the Chicago Bears (4-12), who fell to the Seattle Seahawks in an ugly 6-3 contest in Week 17. It wasn't pretty late, but Minnesota pulls it off, sealing the deal by getting a first down on a Sam Darnold-to-Cam Akers dump-off. Jordan Love's late-game heroics were strong, but it was too little, too late for Green Bay. The Vikings officially improve to 14-2, while the Packers drop to 11-5. What a finish. Wow. Down 20-3 earlier, the Packers are suddenly within two points after Jordan Love orchestrates a beautiful nine-play scoring series. Feeding his entire makeshift receiving corps, including Romeo Doubs, Bo Melton and Dontayvion Wicks, he ultimately hits Malik Heath over the middle for the score. It's now 27-25 Vikings, and Minnesota has a chance to seal it by moving the chains on the ensuing drive. But things suddenly look tight, and the Vikings' errors on the margins could come back to bite them; they had 12 men on the field on the Packers' score, and kicker Will Reichard's two field goal misses look even more glaring now. Don't turn this one off just yet. The Vikings have been dominating, but seemingly out of nowhere Matt LaFleur produces a nine-play, 67-yard scoring series headlined by a couple of long strikes from Jordan Love -- first to Bo Melton, then to Tucker Kraft. Josh Jacobs and Emanuel Wilson then share touches on the ground, with the latter powering forward for the score. It's 27-18 after Love finds Romeo Doubs for the two-point try, meaning Green Bay isn't done yet. Brian Flores' secondary nowhere to be found on this drive. The Vikings have a chance to go up 30-10, but Will Reichard bangs a 43-yard field goal off the uprights. He's now missed two of four field goal tries on the day. Probably the only blemish for Minnesota thus far. Green Bay has nowhere to run, nowhere to hide. Down 27-10 with the clock ticking in the fourth, Jordan Love's pocket collapses and Andrew Van Ginkel sandwiches him for the sack to force a punt. That means the Packers went backwards two yards on their six-play series. They have just nine first downs on the day. We can't call this one yet, because the Pack did threaten a comeback against these Vikings despite falling behind 28-0 in their September meeting, but boy does this one look good for Minnesota. Sam Darnold is 21 of 22 on passes between the numbers against the Packers, per ESPN. In other words, the Vikings are absolutely killing it over the middle of the field. Green Bay not having Quay Walker and Jaire Alexander hasn't helped. It's partly why everything's coming up purple in this one. Everybody eats in Minnesota! Sam Darnold slings another beauty to Jordan Addison, who's up to six catches on the day, and after a couple of Aaron Jones tosses, Cam Akers gets the dump-off screen, fighting through a few would-be tacklers to reach the end zone and put the Vikings up 27-10. The Packers have no answers for the wide array of weapons. Minnesota now has 22 first downs to Green Bay's eight, and owns the time-of-possession battle 27:33 to 16:36. It's been a one-sided affair except for the one Darnold pick. Four plays after Carrington Valentine's interception of Sam Darnold, the Packers score their first touchdown of the day, feeding Josh Jacobs at the goal line. It's now 20-10 Vikings, and we've got ourselves a ballgame. Jeff Hafley's \"D\" had struggled to get off the field for a while, so perhaps this will turn the tide. Absolutely desperate for a big play, Green Bay gets one on the defensive side, baiting Sam Darnold into a sideline shot. Aiming for T.J. Hockenson with pressure in his face, Darnold instead zips it to Packers cornerback Carrington Valentine, with star safety Xavier McKinney also in the area. The much-needed takeaway puts Green Bay in scoring range about halfway through the third. Christian Watson's injury-related absence is being felt by the Packers offense. Jordan Love has just a single pass completion over 10 yards in this game. Nobody's really separating downfield, and while Matt LaFleur's focus has been on wearing down Minnesota with Josh Jacobs, that approach isn't necessarily ideal when you're down 20-3. The Packers need a splash play in a hurry. Jordan Love may have the most gifted arm in the NFC North, but it's yet to matter today. After finding Jalen Nailor for another big gain, Sam Darnold stands tall amid pressure off the edge and threads a perfect downfield end-zone shot to Jordan Addison, making up for an earlier deep shot that got broken up. Rookie safety Javon Bullard is on the wrong end of the pass coverage for Green Bay, and all of a sudden Minnesota leads this by three scores. That's passing touchdown No. 34 for Darnold on the year. Will Reichard misses from 55 yards out on a last-second field goal try, but the Packers get flagged for offsides, giving the Vikings a second chance at extra points. Reichard delivers from 50, and we go into the break with Minnesota up 10 points, owning a 13-3 advantage. Credit to Brian Flores' defense for really limiting the Jordan Love-led aerial attack thus far. Sam Darnold also looks especially sharp, even with Justin Jefferson blanketed by the Green Bay secondary, zipping some chain-moving darts into tight windows. Jalen Nailor is up to 59 yards on four catches as Sam Darnold's top target in lieu of Justin Jefferson drawing extra attention from the Packers. His latest reception, a 16-yarder, comes in a tight window and helps set up a 25-yard Will Reichard field goal, and we've got ourselves a 10-3 ballgame in favor of Minnesota. That scoring drive goes 69 yards over 10 plays. Halftime is fast approaching. Josh Jacobs gets a big workload on Green Bay's latest series, and the Packers push the rock to the Vikings 23, but on fourth-and-3, Jordan Love gets jumpy in the pocket and can't quite connect with Jayden Reed over the middle. Reed has yet to secure a catch on the day, and the ball goes back to Minnesota. Love is 7 of 11 for 45 yards so far, and only Dontayvion Wicks has more than one catch. Most of Matt LaFleur's attack has centered on Jacobs' bruising ground game. The Vikings are toughing it out. Injury alert: Vikings edge rusher Pat Jones II walks off after taking a shot to the knee from Packers tight end Tucker Kraft. Required some attention from trainers before limping his way to the sidelines. Justin Jefferson is getting almost no looks as the Packers focus their attention on the Vikings' top pass catcher, but that opens the door for Jalen Nailor, who outraces the entire Green Bay secondary for a 31-yard score. That's Sam Darnold's 33rd touchdown pass of the year, and it puts the Vikes up 7-3 in this one. Josh Jacobs rumbles into Minnesota territory with another strong dose of touches, but the Vikings hold firm inside the 10, with Josh Metellus stuffing Luke Musgrave on third down. So Green Bay goes up first but settles for a 22-yard field goal from Brandon McManus. It's 3-0 Packers at U.S. Bank Stadium. This one's been a gritty defensive affair thus far, with Brian Flores and Jeff Hafley both showcasing strong stuff. Jordan Addison burns Keisean Nixon on the outside for a potential score, but Sam Darnold floats it high rather than with velocity, and Nixon makes a leaping recovery to break up the connection. Then Will Reichard boots a field goal try from 57 yards out, and it bounces off the crossbar. So we're still at 0-0 here. Darnold is facing some heat up the middle from the Packers front. Green Bay takes to the air on its second series, perhaps as a response to Josh Jacobs' early fumble, and Jordan Love tries for three straight downfield shots, nearly connecting with Dontayvion Wicks. But the passes are just off, and the last one is nearly picked by Harrison Smith over the middle. So it's a punt, and the Vikings are back in control. Three drives so far, and three defensive stands. Josh Jacobs' fumble put Minnesota in a great position near midfield, but Jeff Hafley's defense shows up, putting pressure in Sam Darnold's face on back-to-back plays to force a punt. Kenny Clark got the first pressure, and Rashan Gary nearly came up with a sack on third down. Green Bay starts strong with a couple of tough Josh Jacobs carries and a quick first-down catch by Dontayvion Wicks, but then Jacobs coughs up the ball on a hit from Jerry Tillery. Vikings safety Cam Bynum (who else?) jumps on it, and we've got out first turnover already. Former Vikings Pro Bowl defensive lineman Pat Williams shows up at U.S. Bank Stadium to blow the pregame Gjallarhorn ahead of the opening kickoff. A \"Skol\" chant follows, and we're ready to go. The Packers win the coin toss and elect to receive the ball. It's Jordan Love up first in Minnesota. The fake snow is falling inside U.S. Bank Stadium as the Vikings and Packers prepare to take the field. Live from U.S. Bank Stadium, we've got you covered with all the key notes and analysis from today's matchup. First up: The Packers are without some big names in Minnesota, with Jaire Alexander, Christian Watson and Quay Walker among notable inactives. ¬© 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

Washington's offense went 70 yards in seven minutes and culminated in quarterback Jayden Daniels finding tight end Zach Ertz for the game-winning 2-yard touchdown pass. Daniels had a historic night, completing 24 of 36 passes for 227 yards, three touchdowns, and an interception. He also led the Commanders with 127 rushing yards on 16 carries. Daniels broke the rookie quarterback rushing yards record, previously held by former Washington quarterback Robert Griffin III, in the third quarter. Washington took control early by converting an interception by Falcons rookie quarterback Michael Penix Jr. to a touchdown. Atlanta scored 17 unanswered points by halftime, though, and a 10-point deficit was the biggest Washington's faced all season at the break. Atlanta running back Bijan Robinson scored two rushing touchdowns in the first half and finished the night with 17 carries for 90 yards and two scores. NFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more. The Commanders came out strong in the second half with a 15-play drive that took up nearly eight minutes of time in the third quarter. Daniels found Ertz for his fifth touchdown of the season to cut the deficit to 17-14. Washington chewed another seven minutes of clock on their ensuing drive capped off by a go-ahead touchdown run by Chris Rodriguez. Their ensuing drive took 5:30 off the clock but finished off with a field goal. Atlanta fought back on their next drive as Penix Jr. threw his first NFL touchdown pass to tight end Kyle Pitts on 4th-and-goal and tie the game 24-24. A quick stop by the Falcons' defense gave the Penix Jr. and company the ball back with 40 seconds to go. They got into field goal range but Riley Patterson couldn't hit the 56-yard attempt. Penix Jr. completed 19 of 35 passes for 223 yards, one touchdown, and an interception in his second career start. Washington began overtime on offense and didn't let Atlanta's offense back on the field. Daniels repeatedly went to former Falcons wide receiver Olamide Zaccheaus on the night as Atlanta cornerback A.J. Terrell blanketed Terry McLaurin, his typical top target. Zaccheaus tied a career-high with eight catches for 85 yards and a touchdown, but had a critical drop on their final drive of regulation. Both teams had more success on the ground. Washington had 216 yards rushing and Atlanta tallied 126 by the final whistle. Washington overcame multiple miscues, including Daniels' interception and 108 yards in penalties, for their 11th win of the season. The Commanders (11-5) close out the regular season on the road next week against the Dallas Cowboys (7-9). This loss moves Atlanta (8-8) one game back from NFC South leader Tampa Bay (9-7). The Falcons head home for their regular season finale against the Carolina Panthers (4-12) and need the Buccaneers to lose to the New Orleans Saints to have a chance to win the division and make the playoffs. NFL PLAYOFF PICTURE: Where things stand in the AFC and NFC DO YOU LIKE FOOTBALL? Then you'll enjoy getting our NFL newsletter delivered to your inbox Jayden Daniels' 2-yard touchdown pass to tight end Zach Ertz gave the Commanders the win in overtime. More importantly, the win secured the Commanders' first playoff berth since the 2020 season. It also clinched a postseason spot for the Los Angeles Rams, who are NFC West winners due to a strength of victory tiebreaker over the Seattle Seahawks. Washington's gone 68 yards in more than seven minutes to take it deep into the red zone. Washington is facing third-and-goal from the 2-yard line with 2:45 to go in overtime. Washington won the coin toss and elected to receive the ball and start overtime on offense. Atlanta's Riley Patterson attempted a 56-yard field goal but it fell well short and \"Sunday Night Football\" is headed to overtime. A zero-yard sack and two incomplete passes meant the Commanders took just 39 seconds off the clock before punting back to the Falcons. Atlanta gets the ball back on its own 19-yard line with 40 seconds to go and two timeouts. After a 21-yard loss on first-and-goal on a botched snap, the Falcons were able to battle back and score on a Michael Penix Jr. pass to tight end Kyle Pitts on fourth-and-goal. The 13-yard touchdown pass is Penix Jr.'s first as an NFL quarterback and Riley Patterson's extra point is good to tie the game with 1:19 to go in the fourth quarter. Facing first-and-goal from the Washington 5-yard line, the Falcons tried a direct snap to running back Bijan Robinson but it went through his hands and back for a 21-yard loss. The Falcons will be facing second-and-goal from the Commanders' 26-yard line after the two-minute warning. Washington took more than five minutes to drive 52 yards for their third scoring drive of the second half. A holding call on third-and-goal nullified a touchdown pass from Jayden Daniels to Olamide Zaccheaus to keep the Falcons in contention and force a field goal. Zane Gonzalez knocked it through from 31 yards out to give Washington a seven-point lead with 4:32 to go. The rookie quarterback rushed for 7 yards on first-and-10 from the Falcons' 48-yard line in the fourth quarter, giving him 820 rushing yards on the season. That mark breaks the previous record of 815 yards held by fellow Washington quarterback Robert Griffin III set in the 2012 NFL season. Atlanta's offense picked up a first down to pass midfield but Commanders defensive lineman Dorance Armstrong sacked Michael Penix Jr. for an eight-yard loss on 3rd-and-10. The Falcons punt for the second time in a row in the second half and Washington's offense takes over from their own 36-yard line with 10:02 to go in the game. The Commanders took another seven minutes off the clock with a 14-play, 70-yard drive culminating in a 2-yard touchdown run by second-year running back Chris Rodriguez. Zane Gonzalez's extra point is good and Washington takes the lead again for the first time since the first quarter. Quarterback Jayden Daniels used his legs on the drive multiple times, scrambling for 39 yards and two first downs on the drive. He also found Jeremy McNichols for a key conversion on fourth-and-5 in Falcons territory. Washington's dominated time of possession in the third frame. The Commanders out-gained the Falcons 125 yards to minus-1 in the quarter. Washington's offense has the ball at the Falcons' 14-yard line facing second-and-5 to open the final quarter of the game. Atlanta managed just five yards before Washington defensive lineman Dante Fowler Jr. got a strip sack on third-and-5. Michael Penix Jr. recovered the ball, but the Falcons had to punt for just the second time all game. Washington's offense gets the ball back at its own 30-yard line with 5:06 to go in the third quarter. Washington's offense took nearly eight full minutes off the clock in their opening drive of the second half. Jayden Daniels fired a pass to tight end Zach Ertz on third-and-8 for a 10-yard touchdown. Zane Gonzalez's extra point is good as the Commanders make it a one-score game. Multiple key plays kept the drive going at crucial moments. An illegal contact penalty on the Falcons' defense on 3rd-and-22 kept Washington's offense on the field. Ertz had a 37-yard catch-and-run ‚Äî his longest catch in three seasons ‚Äî to get Washington past midfield. Daniels' 4-yard run on fourth-and-1 from the Falcons' 16-yard line gave the Commanders a new set of downs and closer to the end zone. Atlanta's field goal with two seconds to go sealed a two-score lead after the first half. After Washington's opening drive touchdown, the Falcons have clamped down on defense. The Commanders kicked two punts and threw and interception on their three drives after their first touchdown. Atlanta's pass rush has sacked Jayden Daniels twice and both quarterbacks have thrown one interception through the first two quarters. Washington will get the ball to start the third quarter. The Falcons went 51 yards in less than two minutes to make it a two-score game behind a 39-yard field goal by Liam McCullough. Michael Penix Jr. completed 3 of 5 passes for 32 yards on the drive. A holding penalty and 10-yard sack on consecutive plays forced the Washington offense into a third-and-30 from their own 35-yard line. The Commanders couldn't overcome that and will settle for a punt on the other side of the two-minute warning. Atlanta will have a chance to score before halftime with all three timeouts. Atlanta's offense capitalized on the interception by marching 72 yards in 11 plays for a go-ahead touchdown. Bijan Robinson's second-and-2 run from the Commanders' 4-yard line was initially ruled a touchdown run but was called back due to the ball going out of bounds before crossing the plane of the end zone. Two plays later, he made good on that miss with a 1-yard score. The Falcons ran the ball eight times on the drive for 49 yards. After a holding penalty backed the Commanders out of the red zone, Jayden Daniels dropped back and threw an interception to Falcons linebacker Kaden Elliss. Elliss had a short return to give the ball back to the Falcons offense at their own 29-yard line with 10:37 to go in the second quarter. Facing third-and-6 from their own 33-yard line, Falcons quarterback Michael Penix Jr. dropped back and threw deep for running back Bijan Robinson, who had a step on his defender. The pass fell incomplete and the Falcons were forced to punt. Washington takes over at its own 28-yard line with less than a minute to go in the first quarter. Falcons rookie linebacker JD Bertrand got to Jayden Daniels for a 13-yard sack on second-and-10 and Washington's offense couldn't recover. The Commanders punted for the first time tonight and the Falcons will take over at their own 27-yard line with 2:48 to go in the first quarter. Two key penalties against the Commanders kept the Falcons alive for a 10-play, 70-yard drive capped off by a rushing touchdown by Bijan Robinson off a direct snap. Liam McCullough's extra point is good and the game is tied with 5:10 to go in the first quarter. The Falcons were lined up for a field goal on fourth-and-4 from the Washington 28-yard line. But rookie cornerback Mike Sainristil was lined up offsides and a 5-yard penalty gives Atlanta another shot near the red zone. Following the turnover, the Commanders made the most of a short field with a seven-play touchdown drive in a matter of three minutes. Rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels faked a handoff and rolled out to his left before finding Olamide Zaccheaus for a 7-yard touchdown on fourth-and-2. Zane Gonzalez's extra point is good and Washington takes the first lead of the game with 9:33 to go in the first quarter. The rookie dropped back for his third pass of the game and threw it to Commanders safety Quan Martin. Washington's offense takes over at the Falcons' 38-yard line with 12:45 to go in the first quarter. Rookie quarterback Michael Penix Jr. will have the first drive of the game in his second start of the season.

But the other rookie quarterback in the game, Michael Penix Jr. of the Atlanta Falcons, was also fantastic in rallying his team to overtime with a great game-tying drive in regulation. Daniels‚Äô season will continue into the postseason. The Commanders clinched a playoff berth with the 30-24 overtime win. Washington won the coin toss to start OT and took the first drive into the end zone to end the game before Penix ever had a chance to get a possession. Daniels looked like a veteran in moving his team downfield in a pressure situation. On third-and-goal, Daniels hit Zach Ertz for a 2-yard touchdown for the walk-off win. The win also clinched the NFC West title for the Los Angeles Rams due to tiebreakers. The Falcons now need help to win the NFC South. Atlanta needs to beat the Carolina Panthers in Week 18 while the Tampa Bay Buccaneers need to lose to the New Orleans Saints to give the Falcons a division title. The silver lining for the Falcons in a loss that likely will cost them a shot at the division crown was that they should have a lot of excitement over their quarterback going forward. All five first-round rookie quarterbacks who have started games have had flashes of brilliance, or in Daniels‚Äô case, a historic rookie season. The question for Falcons head coach Raheem Morris in the offseason might be why he didn‚Äôt pull the plug on Kirk Cousins and turn to Penix sooner. The first half wasn‚Äôt about either rookie quarterback. It was about Bijan Robinson and the Falcons' defense. Robinson had 82 rushing yards before halftime and two touchdowns. Meanwhile, the Falcons did a solid job of stopping Washington‚Äôs run game and limiting Daniels. The Commanders scored just once in the first half and trailed 17-7 at halftime. That changed quickly in the second half. Daniels started running more and the Commanders‚Äô offense came alive. Washington scored quickly, on a Daniels touchdown pass to Ertz, and the Falcons‚Äô lead was down to 17-14. The Commanders' offense stayed hot on its next drive, and Chris Rodriguez Jr. scored on a 2-yard touchdown run to give Washington the lead early in the fourth quarter. The Falcons' offense couldn‚Äôt get in any rhythm, and Daniels and the Commanders rarely let Atlanta have the ball. By the time the Commanders extended their lead to 24-17, the Commanders had run 39 second-half plays to just nine for Atlanta, and Washington had a 20:20 to 5:08 edge in time of possession. It looked like the Commanders had taken over the game and would escape with a win behind Daniels‚Äô great second half. But Penix wasn‚Äôt backing down. The Falcons trailed 24-17 in a game they likely needed in the NFC South race, and that‚Äôs not a great spot for a rookie in his second career start. But Penix never looked like he was in just his second start. Penix was impressive in driving the Falcons downfield in the final minutes, including a big fourth-and-11 completion to Drake London for 31 yards. On first-and-goal a direct snap to Robinson was high and mishandled, and even though Robinson recovered, he was tackled at the 26-yard line, putting Atlanta in a ridiculous second-and-goal position. After that disaster, the rookie completed a 13-yard pass to London on second down and a 13-yard touchdown to Kyle Pitts on fourth down to tie it with 1:19 to go. Daniels was excellent in the second half, as he has been most of the season. But in that crucial drive, the Falcons learned a lot about their own rookie quarterback. After the score, Daniels threw a nice pass to Olamide Zaccheaus on third down but Zaccheaus dropped it and the Commanders punted, giving the ball right back to the Falcons with less than a minute to go. Penix rallied the team downfield and with two seconds left he escaped the rush and threw downfield, which led to a pass interference call on the Commanders. That gave the Falcons a shot at a field goal as time expired. But Riley Patterson‚Äôs 56-yard attempt was short and the game went to overtime. The Commanders got the ball first and Daniels continued to make plays. He had a great scramble for a first down on a crucial third-and-2. The drive kept moving inside the 10-yard line. The Commanders faced a third-and-goal from the 2-yard line, knowing a touchdown would clinch a playoff spot. Daniels hit Ertz for the touchdown, and Washington got its biggest win in years. Washington is heading to the playoffs. It seems like the rookie quarterback class of 2024 has plenty of postseason berths in its future.

It would have been a career-best for Patterson, who is in for the injured Younghoe Koo, and the game heads to overtime. Twelve penalties for 103 yards for Washington tonight.

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. The Washington Commanders are back in the playoffs. Despite an inspired performance by Falcons rookie quarterback Michael Penix Jr., Washington prevailed in overtime after their rookie quarterback, Jayden Daniels, hit tight end Zach Ertz for the game-winning score in the extra session. Washington (11-5) has clinched its first playoff berth since 2020 with Sunday night's 30-24 win. The Commanders also clinched a playoff berth for the Los Angeles Rams. Conversely, Atlanta (8-8) lost control of its own playoff destiny. The Commanders scored 17 unanswered points after trailing 17-7 at halftime, but Atlanta forced overtime after Penix hit Kyle Pitts on a 13-yard touchdown pass with 1:19 left in regulation. The Falcons could have won it in regulation, but Riley Patterson's 56-yard field goal try at the buzzer was short. In overtime, Daniels led the Commanders on a 12-play, 70-yard drive that was punctuated by his third touchdown pass of the night. Daniels also led both teams with 127 yards on 16 carries. Penix threw for 223 yards with a touchdown and a pick in a losing effort. Here's a closer look at how Washington punched its playoff ticket. Without taking anything away from Atlanta, Washington's win was largely the result of Dan Quinn's team not getting in its own way as much in the second half and in overtime after committing several costly errors in the first half. One of those mistakes was a special teams penalty on a Falcons punt that extended the drive and ultimately led to a touchdown for the visiting team. The Commanders were flagged a whopping 13 times for 108 yards, but Daniels largely overcame the sloppy play with breathtaking plays. Daniels' night also included some history; he broke former Washington quarterback Robert Griffin III's rookie record for rushing yards by a quarterback. With A.J. Terrell following Terry McLaurin's every move, Commanders wideout Olamide Zaccheaus stepped up with eight grabs for 85 yards that included his 7-yard touchdown catch on Washington's first drive. Defensively, the Commanders set up the game's first score after picking off Penix on the game's fifth play. In the second half, Washington was able to get Atlanta's offense off the field on its first two possessions. The Falcons had run just nine plays prior to their game-tying touchdown drive in the final moments of regulation. The Falcons sacked Daniels five times, but they weren't able to bring him down when it mattered most. They also were unable to come up with a fourth-down stop, as the Commanders converted on all three of their fourth-down tries. While the loss surely hurts, Falcons fans should take solace in Penix's performance. After a shaky opening drive, Penix quickly found his rhythm, leading the Falcons on three scoring drives in the first half. Two of those drives ended with touchdowns by running back Bijan Robinson, who rushed or 82 yards on 13 carries in the game's first 30 minutes. Penix then led an improbable, game-tying drive near the end of regulation that included a 31-yard completion to Drake London (who caught seven passes for 106 yards) on a fourth-and-11 play. His touchdown pass to Pitts was on a fourth-and-13 play. Speaking of Robinson, his lack of involvement in the second half loomed large in the loss. He had just eight yards on four carries in the second half after being an integral part of the Falcons' success in the first half. One of Washington's most important plays of the night took place on a fourth-and-5 on the Falcons' 39-yard line late in the third quarter. On the play, Daniels threw a short pass to running back Jeremy McNichols, who was initially short of the first-down market before fighting for the necessary yardage. The 6-yard gain helped set up the Commanders' go-ahead touchdown at the start of the fourth quarter. Daniels' game-winning touchdown pass was a dart that corralled by Ertz, who caught six passes for 72 yards and two scores. \"I like our teams' chances against anyone.\" -- Daniels with NBC Sports afterward when asked about Washington's playoff prospects Atlanta will play host to the Panthers in their regular-season finale. The Falcons need to win and have the Buccaneers lose to the Saints in order to capture the NFC South division title and the playoff berth that comes with it. The Commanders will wrap up the regular season in Dallas against the rival Cowboys. Washington clinches the playoff spot and right now is the No. 6 seed ahead of the Packers due to the conference record tiebreaker. That'll be settled next week. Atlanta now needs the Buccaneers to lose next week in order to win the NFC South. For the second week in a row, Jayden Daniels leads a game-winning, walk-off drive. This time, he sends the Commanders to the playoffs with a strike to Zach Ertz over the middle of the field. That drive was basically all Daniels the whole way. What a performance: 24 of 36 for 227 yards, 3 touchdowns and 1 interception, plus 16 (SIXTEEN) carries for 127 yards. WOW. Daniels' escapability is just unreal. Riley Patterson's 56-yard field goal came up way short, so the Davis penalty escapes ignominy. We're headed to an extra period. This penalty on Michael Davis being pass interference rather than holding may have just won Atlanta the game. Wow. Noah Igbinoghene may have gotten away with illegal contact on that last throw to Drake London. Their feet got tangled so it wasn't pass interference, but Igbinoghene had hands on London farther than 5 yards downfield. EXTREMELY suspect time management from the Falcons. Wow. They let the clock run all the way down to 12 seconds when they still had an extra timeout. Wow. Might have just cost themselves a chance to win the game. AJ Terrell got away with a pretty obvious pass interference on second down and Olamide Zaccheus had a ball hit him in the facemask on third, and now the Falcons will have 40 seconds to drive for the game-winning score, with two timeouts still in their pocket. And Penix comes back on the very next snap and makes up for it with his best throw of the night. Fantastic job by Kyle Pitts to make the contested catch over the middle. Extra point tied it up. What a drive. Yikes. Second time Penix has missed an open corner route for a touchdown. Absolutely massive loss for the Falcons on a bad snap on first-and-goal results in a 21-yard loss. It'll be second-and-goal from the 26-yard line after the two-minute warning. Atlanta tried to go with the direct snap to Bijan again and it backfired in a big way. Penix has made two really nice throws to the wide left side of the field to extend this drive. Falcons still have a shot to tie. Washington tacked on a field goal after the Cosmi penalty, and now leads by 7. The Falcons have 4:32 to drive the field for a game-tying touchdown, armed with two timeouts. Oh boy, that could be a huge penalty. Holding on Sam Cosmi wipes a Zaccheus TD off the board and now it'll be third-and-goal from the 13 with Washington up by 4 points. Daniels just broke the record for rushing yards by a rookie quarterback. It was, of course, previously held by Robert Griffin III for this same Washington franchise. Second time tonight that Penix has gotten stripped but the Falcons have recovered the fumble. He's got to have better ball security in the pocket, especially when he's trying to step up and through the rush. What a move by Ray-Ray McCloud! Stayed on his feet through a pair of tacklers on third down and created a whole bunch of yards after the catch by himself. Moved the Falcons into plus territory as they try to take the lead here. Another fantastic drive from Washington culminates with a trip to the end zone. This time it's Chris Rodriguez scoring on a pitch play from 2 yards out to cap a 14-play, 70-yard drive that again took more than 7 minutes off the clock. Really nice coverage from A.J. Terrell on a third-down deep shot to Terry McLaurin forced Washington into fourth-and-5. Naturally, Daniels converted it again, this time with a checkdown over the middle to Jeremy McNichols. He was nearly stood up just before the line to gain but appeared to reach out and convert it at the last second. Atlanta got away with one on third down, as Penix got stripped of the ball but fell on it himself before a defender could recover the fumble. Washington will get it back with a chance to tie or take the lead. Big drive for Zach Ertz. He had the huge gain earlier and now he steps up on third-and-long inside the red zone and makes a great contested grab in the front of the end zone to get Washington back within one score. 15 plays, 79 yards and a touchdown in a drive that took more than half the third quarter. Second fourth-down conversion of the night for Washington. Now 18 of 21 on the year. Zach Ertz has basically been a catch-and-fall guy for years now, He just had a MASSIVE catch and run for a huge gain on a scramble-drill play after Daniels evaded pressure in the pocket. Washington's offensive line is getting totally bowled over here. Just got bailed out by an illegal contact penalty. Some really, really bad clock management from Atlanta on this final drive, and then Penix airmailed an open corner route on third down, so the Falcons settled for a Riley Patterson field goal to take a 10-point lead into the break. Washington gets the ball to begin the third quarter. It looked like the second score of the night for Bijan Robinson, but apparently the ball was behind him as he went through the front corner of the end zone, so they took the score off the board. Michael Penix then got stopped on a QB sneak from inside the 1-yard line. Falcons still trying to punch it in. And then Bijan took it into the end zone anyway, bouncing it outside the tackle box and easily jumping into the end zone to give the Falcons their first lead of the night. Really undisciplined performance from the Washington defense so far. Already three penalties to extend drives. After a penalty set Washington's drive back inside the red zone, Kaden Elliss came up with a huge play to shut down the scoring opportunity. Looks like Daniels got fooled by the coverage and never saw Elliss dropping into his zone, and just threw the ball right into the defender's chest. Former Falcons WR Olamide Zaccheus has 5-53-1 against his former team less than 5 minutes into the second quarter. One of the best games of his career already. That looked like the third miscommunication of the game for the Falcons already. The snap operation isn't on the same page, and neither are the receivers. ¬© 2004-2024 CBS Interactive.
