                "content": "The Premier League is a professional association football league in England and the highest level of the English football league system. Contested by 20 clubs, it operates on a system of promotion and relegation with the English Football League (EFL). Seasons usually run from August to May, with each team playing 38 matches: two against each other team, one home and one away.[1] Most games are played on weekend afternoons, with occasional weekday evening fixtures.[2] The competition was founded as the FA Premier League on 20 February 1992, following the decision of First Division (the top-tier league from 1888 until 1992) clubs to break away from the English Football League. However, teams may still be relegated to and promoted from the EFL Championship. The Premier League is a corporation managed by a chief executive, with member clubs acting as shareholders.[3] The Premier League takes advantage of a £5 billion television rights deal, with Sky and BT Group securing the domestic rights to broadcast 128 and 32 games, respectively.[4][5] This deal will rise to £6.7 billion for the four seasons from 2025 to 2029.[6] The league is projected to earn $7.2 billion in overseas TV rights from 2022 to 2025.[7] Clubs were apportioned central payment revenues of £2.4 billion in 2016–17, with a further £343 million in solidarity payments to EFL clubs.[8] The Premier League is the most-watched sports league in the world, broadcast in 212 territories to 643 million homes, with a potential TV audience of 4.7 billion people.[9][10] For the 2023–24 season, the average Premier League match attendance was 38,375,[11] second to the German Bundesliga's 39,512,[12] whilst aggregated attendance across all matches in a 38-game season is the highest of any association football league.[13] Most stadium occupancies are near capacity.[14] As of 2023[update], the Premier League is ranked first in the UEFA coefficient rankings based on performances in European competitions over the past five seasons, ahead of Spain's La Liga.[15] The English top-flight has produced the second-highest number of European Cup / UEFA Champions League titles, with a record six English clubs having won fifteen European championships in total.[16] Fifty-one clubs have competed in the Premier League since its inception in 1992: 49 from England and 2 from Wales. Seven of them have won the title: Manchester United (13), Manchester City (8), Chelsea (5), Arsenal (3), Blackburn Rovers (1), Leicester City (1), and Liverpool (1).[17] Only six clubs have played in every season to date: Arsenal, Chelsea, Everton, Liverpool, Manchester United, and Tottenham Hotspur.[18] Despite significant European success in the 1970s and early 1980s, the late 1980s marked a low point for English football. Stadiums were deteriorating, supporters endured poor facilities, hooliganism was rife, and English clubs had been banned from European competition for five years following the Heysel Stadium disaster between the fans of Liverpool Football Club and the fans of Juventus in 1985.[19] The Football League First Division, the top level of English football since 1888, was behind leagues such as Italy's Serie A and Spain's La Liga in attendance and revenues, and several top English players had moved abroad.[20] By the turn of the 1990s, the downward trend was starting to reverse. At the 1990 FIFA World Cup, England reached the semi-finals; UEFA, European football's governing body, lifted the five-year ban on English clubs playing in European competitions in 1990, resulting in Manchester United lifting the Cup Winners' Cup in 1991. The Taylor Report on stadium safety standards, which proposed expensive upgrades to create all-seater stadiums in the aftermath of the Hillsborough disaster; between the fans of Liverpool and the fans of Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield, Yorkshire on 15 April 1989, was published in January 1990.[21] During the 1980s, major English clubs began to transform into business ventures, applying commercial principles to club administration to maximise revenue. Martin Edwards of Manchester United, Irving Scholar of Tottenham Hotspur, and David Dein of Arsenal were among the leaders in this transformation.[22] The commercial imperative led to the top clubs seeking to increase their power and revenue: the clubs in Division One threatened to break away from the Football League, and in doing so, they managed to increase their voting power and gain a more favourable financial arrangement, taking a 50% share of all television and sponsorship income in 1986.[22] They demanded that television companies should pay more for their coverage of football matches,[23] and revenue from television grew in importance. The Football League received £6.3 million for a two-year agreement in 1986, but by 1988, in a deal agreed with ITV, the price rose to £44 million over four years, with the leading clubs taking 75% of the cash.[24][25] According to Scholar, who was involved in the negotiations of television deals, each of the First Division clubs received only around £25,000 per year from television rights before 1986, this increased to around £50,000 in the 1986 negotiation, then to £600,000 in 1988.[26] The 1988 negotiations were conducted under the threat of ten clubs leaving to form a \"super league\", but they were eventually persuaded to stay, with the top clubs taking the lion's share of the deal.[24][27][28] The negotiations also convinced the bigger clubs that, in order to receive enough votes, they needed to take the whole of the First Division with them instead of a smaller \"super league\".[29] By the beginning of the 1990s, the big clubs again considered breaking away, especially now that they had to fund the cost of stadium upgrades as proposed by the Taylor Report.[30] In 1990, the managing director of London Weekend Television (LWT), Greg Dyke, met with the representatives of the \"big five\" football clubs in England (Manchester United, Liverpool, Tottenham Hotspur, Everton, and Arsenal) over a dinner.[31] The meeting was to pave the way for a breakaway from the Football League.[32] Dyke believed that it would be more lucrative for LWT if only the larger clubs in the country were featured on national television and wanted to establish whether the clubs would be interested in a larger share of television rights money.[33] The five clubs agreed with the suggestion and decided to press ahead with it; however, the league would have no credibility without the backing of the Football Association, and so David Dein of Arsenal held talks to see whether the FA were receptive to the idea. The FA did not have an amicable relationship with the Football League at the time and considered it a way to weaken the Football League's position.[34] The FA released a report in June 1991, Blueprint for the Future of Football, that supported the plan for the Premier League, with the FA as the ultimate authority that would oversee the breakaway league.[29] At the close of the 1990–1991 season, a proposal was tabled for the establishment of a new league that would bring more money into the game overall. The Founder Members Agreement, signed on 17 July 1991, by the game's top-flight clubs, established the basic principles for setting up the FA Premier League.[35] The newly formed top division was to have commercial independence from the Football Association and the Football League, giving the FA Premier League licence to negotiate its own broadcast and sponsorship agreements. The argument given at the time was that the extra income would allow English clubs to compete with teams across Europe.[20] Although Dyke played a significant role in the creation of the Premier League, he and ITV (of which LWT was part) lost out in the bidding for broadcast rights: BSkyB won with a bid of £304 million over five years, with the BBC awarded the highlights package broadcast on Match of the Day.[31][33] Luton Town, Notts County, and West Ham United were the three teams relegated from the old First Division at the end of the 1991–92 season, and did not take part in the inaugural Premier League season. They were replaced by Ipswich Town, Middlesbrough, and Blackburn Rovers, promoted from the old Second Division.[36] The 22 First Division clubs resigned en masse from the Football League in 1992, and on 27 May that year, the FA Premier League was formed as a limited company, working out of an office at the Football Association's then headquarters in Lancaster Gate.[20] The 22 inaugural members of the new Premier League were:[37] This meant a break-up of the 104-year-old Football League that had operated until then with four divisions; the Premier League would operate with a single division and the Football League with three. There was no change in competition format; the same number of teams competed in the top flight, and promotion and relegation between the Premier League and the new First Division remained the same as the old First and Second Divisions, with three teams relegated from the league and three promoted.[28] The league held its first season in 1992–93. It was composed of 22 clubs for that season (reduced to 20 in the 1995–96 season). The first Premier League goal was scored by Brian Deane of Sheffield United in a 2–1 win against Manchester United.[38] Manchester United won the inaugural edition of the new league, ending a twenty-six year wait to be crowned champions of England. Bolstered by this breakthrough, United immediately became the competition's dominant team, winning seven of the first nine trophies, two League and FA Cup 'doubles' and a European treble, initially under a team of hardened veterans such as Bryan Robson, Steve Bruce, Paul Ince, Mark Hughes, and Eric Cantona, before Cantona, Bruce, and Roy Keane led a young, dynamic new team filled with the Class of 92, a group of young players including David Beckham who came through the Manchester United Academy. Between 1993 and 1997, Blackburn Rovers and Newcastle United came close to challenging Manchester United's early dominance; Blackburn won the 1994–95 FA Premier League and Newcastle led the title charge over United for much of the 1995–96 season. As the decade closed, Arsenal replicated Manchester United's dominance by winning the League and FA Cup double in 1997–98, and together they would form a duopoly over the league between 1997 and 2003. The 2000s saw the rise of Liverpool alongside the \"Big 2\", followed by Chelsea finally breaking the Arsenal–Man United duopoly by winning the league in 2004–05. The dominance of the so-called \"Big Four\" clubs – Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, and Manchester United[39][40] – saw them finish at the top of the table for most of the decade, thereby guaranteeing qualification for the UEFA Champions League. Only three other clubs managed to qualify for the competition during this period: Newcastle United (2001–02 and 2002–03), Everton (2004–05), and Tottenham Hotspur (2009–10) – each occupying the final Champions League spot, with the exception of Newcastle in the 2002–03 season, who finished third. Following the 2003–04 season, Arsenal acquired the nickname \"The Invincibles\" as they became the first and, to date, only club to complete a Premier League campaign without losing a single game.[41][42] In May 2008, Kevin Keegan stated that \"Big Four\" dominance threatened the division: \"This league is in danger of becoming one of the most boring but great leagues in the world.\"[43] Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore said in defence: \"There are a lot of different tussles that go on in the Premier League depending on whether you're at the top, in the middle, or at the bottom that make it interesting.\"[44] Between 2005 and 2012, there was a Premier League representative in seven of the eight Champions League finals, with only the \"Big Four\" clubs reaching that stage. Liverpool (2005), Manchester United (2008), and Chelsea (2012) won the competition during this period, with Arsenal (2006), Liverpool (2007), Chelsea (2008), and Manchester United (2009 and 2011) all losing Champions League finals.[45] Leeds United were the only non-\"Big Four\" side to reach the semi-finals of the Champions League, in the 2000–01 season. There were three Premier League teams in the Champions League semi-finals in 2006–07, 2007–08, and 2008–09, a feat only ever achieved five times (along with Serie A in 2002–03 and La Liga in 1999–2000). Additionally, between the 1999–2000 and 2009–10 seasons, four Premier League sides reached the UEFA Cup or Europa League finals, with only Liverpool managing to win the competition in 2001. Arsenal (2000), Middlesbrough (2006), and Fulham (2010) all lost their finals.[46] Although the group's dominance was reduced to a degree after this period with the emergence of Manchester City and Tottenham, in terms of all-time Premier League points won, they remain clear by some margin. As of the end of the 2021–22 season – the 30th season of the Premier League – Liverpool, in fourth place in the all-time points table, were over 300 points ahead of the next team, Tottenham Hotspur. They are also the only teams to maintain a winning average of over 50% throughout their entire Premier League tenures.[47] The years following 2009 marked a shift from the \"Big Four\" with Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester City breaking into the top four places on a regular basis, turning the \"Big Four\" into the \"Big Six\".[48] In the 2009–10 season, Tottenham finished fourth and became the first new team to finish in the top four since Everton five years prior.[49] Criticism of the gap between an elite group of \"super clubs\" and the majority of the Premier League has continued, nevertheless, due to their increasing ability to spend more than the other Premier League clubs.[50] Manchester City won the title in the 2011–12 season, becoming the first club outside the \"Big Four\" to win since Blackburn Rovers in the 1994–95 season. That season also saw two of the \"Big Four\" (Chelsea and Liverpool) finish outside the top four places for the first time since that season.[48] With only four UEFA Champions League qualifying places available in the league, greater competition for qualification now exists, albeit from a narrow base of six clubs. In the five seasons following the 2011–12 campaign, Manchester United and Liverpool both found themselves outside of the top four three times, whilst Chelsea finished 10th in the 2015–16 season. Arsenal finished 5th in 2016–17, ending their record run of 20 consecutive top-four finishes.[51] In the 2015–16 season, underdogs Leicester City won the Premier League. With 5000/1 odds of winning the league at the beginning of the season, Leicester became the first club outside the \"Big Six\" to win the Premier League since Blackburn Rovers in the 1994–95 season.[52] Off the pitch, the \"Big Six\" wield significant financial power and influence, with these clubs arguing that they should be entitled to a greater share of revenue due to the greater stature of their clubs globally and the attractive football they aim to play.[53] Objectors argue that the egalitarian revenue structure in the Premier League helps to maintain a competitive league which is vital for its future success.[54] The 2016–17 Deloitte Football Money League report showed the financial disparity between the \"Big Six\" and the rest of the division. All of the \"Big Six\" had revenues greater than €350 million, with Manchester United having the largest revenue in the league at €676.3 million. Leicester City was the closest club to the \"Big Six\" in terms of revenue, recording a figure of €271.1 million for that season – helped by participation in the Champions League. The eighth-largest revenue generator, West Ham – who did not play in European competition – had revenues of €213.3 million, less than half of those of the club with the fifth-largest revenue, Liverpool (€424.2 million).[55] A substantial part of the clubs' revenue by then came from television broadcast deals, with the biggest clubs each taking from around £150 million to nearly £200 million in the 2016–17 season from such deals.[56] In Deloitte's 2019 report, all the \"Big Six\" were in the top ten of the world's richest clubs.[57] From the 2019–20 season, video assistant referees were used in the league.[58] The 2019–20 season saw Liverpool win their first Premier League trophy, their first top-flight trophy in 30 years.[59] Project Big Picture was announced in October 2020 that described a plan to reunite the top Premier League clubs with the English Football League, proposed by leading Premier League clubs Manchester United and Liverpool.[60] It has been criticised by the Premier League leadership and the UK government's Department for Culture, Media and Sport.[61] On 26 April 2021, play was stopped during a match between Leicester City and Crystal Palace to allow players Wesley Fofana and Cheikhou Kouyaté to break Ramadan fast. It is believed to be the first time in Premier League history that a game was paused to allow Muslim players to eat and drink after the sun had set in accordance with the rules of the faith.[62] The 2022–23 season was the first to take a six-week break between November and December 2022 to allow for the first winter World Cup,[63] with a return for the Boxing Day fixtures.[64] The Premier League players decided to take the knee at selected \"significant moments\". They assured to \"remain resolutely committed to eradicate racial prejudice\".[65] That season was notable for Newcastle United and Brighton & Hove Albion breaking the traditional \"Big Six\" as they finished fourth and sixth, respectively, whilst \"Big Six\" teams Tottenham and Chelsea finished eighth and twelfth.[66][67] Meanwhile, 2015–16 champions Leicester City were relegated, becoming the second league-winning club to suffer relegation since 1992, after Blackburn Rovers in the 2011–12 season.[68] In the 2023–24 season, Manchester City won the Premier League for the sixth time in seven years to become the first top-flight team to win four consecutive league titles in English football history.[69] Meanwhile, non-Big Six club Aston Villa finished fourth and qualified for the 2024–25 UEFA Champions League.[70] The Football Association Premier League Ltd (FAPL)[71][72][73] is operated as a corporation and is owned by the 20 member clubs. Each club is a shareholder, with one vote each on issues such as rule changes and contracts. The clubs select a chairman, chief executive, and board of directors to oversee the daily operations of the league.[74] The Football Association is not directly involved in the day-to-day operations of the Premier League, but has veto power as a special shareholder during the election of the chairman and chief executive and when new rules are adopted by the league.[75] The current chief executive is Richard Masters, who was appointed in December 2019.[76] The chair is currently Alison Brittain, who took over the role in early 2023.[77] The Premier League sends representatives to UEFA's European Club Association, the number of clubs and the clubs themselves chosen according to UEFA coefficients. For the 2023–24 season, the Premier League has 13 representatives in the Association: Arsenal, Aston Villa, Brighton & Hove Albion, Chelsea, Everton, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United, Newcastle United, Nottingham Forest, Tottenham Hotspur, West Ham United, and Wolverhampton Wanderers.[78] The European Club Association is responsible for electing three members to UEFA's Club Competitions Committee, which is involved in the operations of UEFA competitions such as the Champions League and UEFA Europa League.[79] The Premier League has faced criticism of its governance due to an alleged lack of transparency and accountability. Following the Premier League's blocking of the attempted takeover of Newcastle United by a PIF-backed consortium through the league's Owners' and Directors' test, many MPs, Newcastle United fans and related parties to the deal denounced the Premier League for its perceived lack of transparency and accountability throughout the process.[80][81][82] On 6 July 2021, consortium member Amanda Staveley of PCP Capital Partners said that \"fans surely deserve absolute transparency from the regulators across all their processes – to best ensure that they act responsibly. They (the Premier League) are performing a function like that of a government regulator – but without the same systems for accountability.\"[82] On 22 July 2021, Tracey Crouch MP – chair of the fan-led review into the UK's football governance – announced in the review's interim findings that the Premier League had \"lost the trust and confidence\" of fans. The review also recommended that a new independent regulator be created to oversee matters such as club takeovers.[83][84] Premier League chief executive Richard Masters had earlier spoken out against the implementation of an independent regulator, saying in May 2021, \"I don't think that the independent regulator is the answer to the question. I would defend the Premier League's role as regulator of its clubs over the past 30 years.\"[85] [The Premier League] is very tough and is different. If you compare this league to another league, it's like playing another sport. In [The Premier League] you never really know what is going to happen, there is very little between the teams. There are 20 clubs in the Premier League. During the course of a season (from August to May) each club plays the others twice (a double round-robin system), once at their home stadium and once at that of their opponents, for 38 games. Teams receive three points for a win and one point for a draw. No points are awarded for a loss. Teams are ranked by total points, then goal difference, and then goals scored. If still equal, teams are deemed to occupy the same position. If there is a tie for the championship, for relegation, or for qualification to other competitions, the head-to-head record between the tied teams is taken into consideration (points scored in the matches between the teams, followed by away goals in those matches.) If two teams are still tied, a play-off match at a neutral venue decides rank.[88] A system of promotion and relegation exists between the Premier League and the EFL Championship. The three lowest placed teams in the Premier League are relegated to the Championship, and the top two teams from the Championship promoted to the Premier League,[89] with an additional team promoted after a series of play-offs involving the third, fourth, fifth and sixth placed clubs.[90] The number of clubs was reduced from 22 to 20 in 1995, when four teams were relegated from the league and only two teams promoted.[91][92] The top flight had only been expanded to 22 teams at the start of the 1991–92 season – the year prior to the formation of the Premier League.[92] On 8 June 2006, FIFA requested that all major European leagues, including Italy's Serie A and Spain's La Liga, be reduced to 18 teams by the start of the 2007–08 season. The Premier League responded by announcing their intention to resist such a reduction.[93] Ultimately, the 2007–08 season kicked off again with 20 teams.[94] Video assistant referee (VAR), was introduced to the Premier League at the beginning of the 2019–20 season. It uses technology and officials to assist the referee in making decisions on the pitch.[95] However, its use has been met with mixed receptions from fans and pundits, with some praising its accuracy whilst others criticise its impact on the flow of the game and consistency of decision-making. The on-field referee still makes the final decision, but VAR can assist the referee in the decision-making process. VAR can only be used for four types of decisions: goals, penalty decisions, direct red card incidents, and cases of mistaken identity. VAR officials review the video footage and communicate with the on-field referee via a headset. The VAR officials are located in a central control room, which is equipped with multiple camera angles and the ability to replay footage at various speeds. A study evaluating fan reception of VAR in the Premier League was made by Otto Kolbinger and Melanie Knopp and was done by analysing Twitter data.[96] The researchers used sentiment analysis to measure the overall positive or negative attitudes towards VAR, as well as topic modelling to identify specific issues that fans are discussing related to VAR. The study found that the reception of VAR on Twitter is largely negative, with fans expressing frustration and criticism of the technology's impact on the flow of the game and the inconsistency of decisions. The researchers also identified specific issues, such as handball and offside decisions, that fans are particularly critical of. The study concludes that VAR has not been well received by fans in the Premier League, and that efforts to improve the technology and increase transparency in decision-making are needed to address these concerns. Fifty-one clubs have played in the Premier League from its inception in 1992, up to and including the 2023–24 season.[97] Titles won by club (%) Italics indicate former Premier League champions that are currently outside the Premier League. Twenty clubs are competing in the 2024–25 season – top seventeen from the previous season and three promoted from the Championship. In 2011, after Swansea City gained promotion, a Welsh club participated in the Premier League for the first time.[98][99] The first Premier League match to be played outside England was Swansea City's home match at Liberty Stadium against Wigan Athletic on 20 August 2011.[100] The number of Welsh clubs in the Premier League increased to two in 2013–14, as Cardiff City gained promotion,[101] but they were relegated after their maiden season.[102] Cardiff were promoted again in 2017–18 but the number of Welsh clubs remained the same for the 2018–19 Premier League season, as Swansea City had been relegated from the Premier League in 2017–18.[103] Following Cardiff City's relegation after the 2018–19 season, there are currently no Welsh clubs participating in the Premier League.[104] Because they are members of the Football Association of Wales (FAW), the question of whether clubs like Swansea should represent England or Wales in European competitions has caused long-running discussions in UEFA. Swansea took one of England's three available places in the Europa League in 2013–14 by winning the League Cup in 2012–13.[105] The right of Welsh clubs to take up such English places was in doubt until UEFA clarified the matter in March 2012, allowing them to participate.[106] Participation in the Premier League by some Scottish or Irish clubs has sometimes been discussed, but without result. The idea came closest to reality in 1998, when Wimbledon received Premier League approval to relocate to Dublin, Ireland, but the move was blocked by the Football Association of Ireland.[107][108][109][110] Additionally, the media occasionally discusses the idea that Scotland's two biggest teams, Celtic and Rangers, should or will take part in the Premier League, but nothing has come of these discussions.[111] The top four teams in the Premier League qualify automatically for the subsequent season's UEFA Champions League league phase. The champions of the Champions League and UEFA Europa League may earn an additional qualification for the subsequent season's Champions League league phase if did not finish in the top four. If this means six Premier League teams qualify, then the fourth-placed team in the Premier League is instead entered in the Europa League, as any single nation is limited to a maximum of five teams in the Champions League. However, starting from the 2024–25 UEFA Champions League there are additional berths for the two best associations in the previous season's ranking, which may result in a maximum of six teams from one association in the Champions League. The fifth-placed team in the Premier League, as well as the winners of the FA Cup, qualify for the subsequent season's Europa League league phase, but if the winner of the FA Cup also finishes in the top five places in the Premier League or has won one of UEFA's major tournaments, then this place reverts to the team that finished sixth. The winner of the EFL Cup qualifies for the subsequent season's UEFA Conference League, but if the winner had already qualified for a UEFA competition via their performance in another competition, then this place reverts to the team that finished sixth in the Premier League, or seventh if the FA Cup result had already caused the sixth-placed team to qualify.[112] The number of places allocated to English clubs in UEFA competitions is dependent upon the position the country holds in the UEFA coefficient rankings, which are calculated based on the performance of teams in UEFA competitions over the previous five years. Currently, England is ranked first, ahead of Spain. As of 26 September 2024, the coefficients for are as follows (only top five European leagues are shown):[113][114] An exception to the usual European qualification system happened in 2005, after Liverpool won the Champions League the season before, but did not finish in a Champions League qualification place in the Premier League. UEFA gave special dispensation for Liverpool to enter the Champions League, giving England five qualifiers.[115] The governing body subsequently ruled that the defending champions qualify for the competition the following year regardless of their domestic league placing. However, for those leagues with four entrants in the Champions League, this meant that if the Champions League winners finished outside the top four in its domestic league, it would qualify at the expense of the fourth-placed team. At that time, no association could have more than four entrants in the Champions League.[116] This occurred in 2012, when Chelsea – who had won the Champions League that summer, but finished sixth in the league – qualified for the 2012–13 Champions League in place of Tottenham Hotspur, who went into the Europa League.[117] From 2015–16, the Europa League champions qualify for the Champions League, increasing the maximum number of participants per country to five.[118] This took effect in England in 2016–17, when Manchester United finished sixth in the Premier League and won the Europa League, giving England five Champions League entrants for 2017–18.[119] In these instances, any Europa League berth vacated is not handed down to the next-best Premier League finisher outside of a qualifying place. If both Champions League and Europa League winners are of the same association and both finish outside the top four, then the fourth-placed team is transferred to the Europa League. With 48 continental trophies won, English clubs are the third-most successful in European football, behind Italy (50) and Spain (67). In the top-tier UEFA Champions League, a record six English clubs have won a total of 15 titles and lost a further 11 finals, behind Spanish clubs with 20 and 11, respectively.[120] In the second-tier UEFA Europa League, English clubs are third, with nine victories and eight losses in the finals.[121] In the former second-tier UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, English teams won a record eight titles and had a further five finalists.[122] In the non-UEFA organised Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, English clubs provided four winners and four runners-up, the second-most behind Spain with six and three, respectively.[123] In the newly created third-tier UEFA Conference League, English clubs have won a joint-record one title so far.[124] In the former fourth-tier UEFA Intertoto Cup, England won four titles and had a further final appearance, placing it fifth in the rankings, although English clubs were notorious for treating the tournament with disdain, either sending \"B\" squads or withdrawing from it altogether.[125][126][127] In the one-off UEFA Super Cup, England has ten winners and ten runners-up, the second-most behind Spain with 17 and 15, respectively.[128] Similarly to the Intertoto Cup, English teams did not take the former Intercontinental Cup seriously enough, despite its international status of the Club World Championship. They a made a total of six appearances in the one-off competition, winning only one of them, and withdrew a further three times.[129] English clubs have won the FIFA-organised Club World Cup four times, tied for the second-most with Brazil, and behind only Spain, with eight.[130][127] After an inaugural season with no sponsorship, the Premier League was sponsored by Carling from 1993 until 2001, during which time it was known as the FA Carling Premiership. In 2001, a new sponsorship deal with Barclaycard saw the league rebranded the FA Barclaycard Premiership, which was changed to the FA Barclays Premiership in time for the 2004–05 season. For the 2007–08 season, the league was rebranded the Barclays Premier League.[131][132] Barclays' deal with the Premier League expired at the end of the 2015–16 season. The organisation announced on 4 June 2015 that it would not pursue any further title sponsorship deals for the Premier League, arguing that they wanted to build a \"clean\" brand for the competition more in line with those of major U.S. sports leagues.[134] As well as sponsorship for the league itself, the Premier League has a number of official partners and suppliers.[135] The official ball supplier for the league is Nike who have had the contract since the 2000–01 season when they took over from Mitre.[136] Under its Merlin brand, Topps held the licence to produce collectables for the Premier League between 1994 and 2019 including stickers (for their sticker album) and trading cards.[137] Launched in the 2007–08 season, Topps' Match Attax, the official Premier League trading card game, is the best selling boys collectable in the UK, and is also the biggest selling sports trading card game in the world.[137][138] In October 2018, Panini were awarded the licence to produce collectables from the 2019–20 season.[139] The chocolate company Cadbury has been the official snack partner of the Premier League since 2017, and sponsored the Golden Boot, Golden Glove and Playmaker of the Season awards from the 2017–18 season to 2019–20 season.[140][141] The Coca-Cola Company (under its Coca-Cola Zero Sugar product line) sponsored these awards during the 2020–21 season with Castrol being the current sponsor as of the 2021–22 season.[142] The Premier League has the highest revenue of any association football league in the world, with total club revenues of €2.48 billion in 2009–10.[143][144] In 2013–14, due to improved television revenues and cost controls, the Premier League clubs collectively made a net profit in excess of £78 million, exceeding all other football leagues.[145] In 2010 the Premier League was awarded the Queen's Award for Enterprise in the International Trade category for its outstanding contribution to international trade and the value it brings to English football and the United Kingdom's broadcasting industry.[146] The Premier League includes some of the richest football clubs in the world. Deloitte's \"Football Money League\" listed seven Premier League clubs in the top 20 for the 2009–10 season,[147] and all 20 clubs were in the top 40 globally by the end of the 2013–14 season, largely as a result of increased broadcasting revenue.[148] In 2019, the league generated around £3.1 billion per year in domestic and international television rights.[4] Premier League clubs agreed in principle in December 2012, to radical new cost controls. The two proposals consist of a break-even rule and a cap on the amount clubs can increase their wage bill by each season. With the new television deals on the horizon, momentum has been growing to find ways of preventing the majority of the cash going straight to players and agents.[149] Central payments for the 2016–17 season amounted to £2,398,515,773 across the 20 clubs, with each team receiving a flat participation fee of £35,301,989 and additional payments for TV broadcasts (£1,016,690 for general UK rights to match highlights, £1,136,083 for each live UK broadcast of their games and £39,090,596 for all overseas rights), commercial rights (a flat fee of £4,759,404) and a notional measure of \"merit\" which was based upon final league position.[8] The merit component was a nominal sum of £1,941,609 multiplied by each finishing place, counted from the foot of the table (e.g., Burnley finished 16th in May 2017, five places counting upwards, and received 5 × £1,941,609 = £9,708,045 merit payment).[8] Since its split with the Football League, established clubs in the Premier League have a funding disparity from counterparts in lower leagues. Revenue from television rights between the leagues has played a part in this.[150] Promoted teams have found it difficult to avoid relegation in their first Premier League season. One Premier League newcomer has been relegated back to the Football League every season, save the 2001–02, 2011–12, 2017–18 & 2022–23 seasons. In the 1997–98 and 2023–24 seasons, all three promoted clubs were relegated by the season's end.[151] The Premier League distributes a portion of its television revenue as \"parachute payments\" to relegated clubs for adjustment to television revenue loss. The average Premier League team receives £41 million[152] whilst the average Championship club receives £2 million.[153] Starting with the 2013–14 season, these payments are in excess of £60 million over four seasons.[154] Critics maintain that the payments widen the gap between teams that have reached the Premier League and those that have not,[155] leading to the common occurrence of teams \"bouncing back\" soon after their relegation. Clubs which have failed to win immediate promotion back to the Premier League have seen financial problems, in some cases administration or liquidation. Further relegations down the footballing ladder have occurred for multiple clubs unable to cope with the gap.[156][157] Television has played a major role in the history of the Premier League. The League's decision to assign broadcasting rights to Sky in 1992 was at the time a radical decision, but one that has paid off. At the time, paid television was an almost untested proposition in the UK market as was charging fans to watch live televised football. However, a combination of Sky's strategy, the quality of Premier League football and the public's appetite for the game has seen the value of the Premier League's TV rights soar.[25] The Premier League sells its television rights on a collective basis. This is in contrast to some other European leagues, including La Liga, in which each club sells its rights individually, leading to a much higher share of the total income going to the top few clubs.[159] The money is divided into three parts:[160] half is divided equally between the clubs; one quarter is awarded on a merit basis based on final league position, the top club getting twenty times as much as the bottom club, and equal steps all the way down the table; the final quarter is paid out as facilities fees for games that are shown on television, with the top clubs generally receiving the largest shares of this. The income from overseas rights is divided equally between the twenty clubs.[161] Not all Premier League matches are televised in the United Kingdom, as the league upholds the long-standing prohibition on telecasts of any association football match (domestic or otherwise) that kicks off between 2:45 p.m. and 5:15 p.m. on Saturday matchdays.[162][163][164] The first Sky television rights agreement was worth £304 million over five seasons.[165] The next contract, negotiated to start from the 1997–98 season, rose to £670 million over four seasons.[165] The third contract was a £1.024 billion deal with BSkyB for the three seasons from 2001 to 2004. The league brought in £320 million from the sale of its international rights for the three-year period from 2004 to 2007. It sold the rights itself on a territory-by-territory basis.[166] Sky's monopoly was broken from August 2006 when Setanta Sports was awarded rights to show two out of the six packages of matches available. This occurred following an insistence by the European Commission that exclusive rights should not be sold to one television company. Sky and Setanta paid £1.7 billion, a two-thirds increase which took many commentators by surprise as it had been widely assumed that the value of the rights had levelled off following many years of rapid growth. Setanta also hold rights to a live 3 pm match solely for Irish viewers. The BBC retained the rights to show highlights for the same three seasons (on Match of the Day) for £171.6 million, a 63 per cent increase on the £105 million it paid for the previous three-year period.[167] Sky and BT Group (via its new channel BT Sport, now TNT Sports) agreed to jointly pay £84.3 million for delayed television rights to 242 games (that is the right to broadcast them in full on television and over the internet) in most cases for a period of 50 hours after 10 p.m. on matchday.[168] Overseas television rights fetched £625 million, nearly double the previous contract.[169] The total raised from those deals was more than £2.7 billion, giving Premier League clubs an average media income from league games of around £40 million-a-year from 2007 to 2010.[170] The TV rights agreement between the Premier League and Sky faced accusations of being a cartel, and a number of court cases arose as a result.[171] An investigation by the Office of Fair Trading in 2002 found BSkyB to be dominant within the pay TV sports market, but concluded that there were insufficient grounds for the claim that BSkyB had abused its dominant position.[172] In July 1999 the Premier League's method of selling rights collectively for all member clubs was investigated by the UK Restrictive Practices Court, which concluded that the agreement was not contrary to the public interest.[173] The BBC's highlights package on Saturday and Sunday nights, as well as other evenings when fixtures justify, ran until 2016.[174] Television rights alone for the period 2010 to 2013 were purchased for £1.782 billion.[175] On 22 June 2009, due to troubles encountered by Setanta Sports after it failed to meet a final deadline over a £30 million payment to the Premier League, ESPN was awarded two packages of UK rights containing 46 matches that were available for the 2009–10 season as well as a package of 23 matches per season from 2010 to 2013.[176] On 13 June 2012, the Premier League announced that BT had been awarded 38 games a season for the 2013–14, 2014–15 and 2015–16 seasons at £246 million-a-year. The remaining 116 games were retained by Sky, which paid £760 million-a-year. The total domestic rights raised £3.018 billion, an increase of 70.2% over the 2010–11 to 2012–13 rights.[177] The value of the licensing deal rose by another 70.2% in 2015, when Sky and BT paid £5.136 billion to renew their contracts with the Premier League for another three years up to the 2018–19 season.[178] A new rights cycle began in the 2019–20 season, with the domestic package increasing to 200 matches overall; in February 2018, BT were awarded the package of 32 lunchtime fixtures on Saturdays, whilst Sky was awarded four of the seven packages, covering the majority of weekend fixtures (including eight new prime time fixtures on Saturdays), as well as Monday and Friday matches. Two remaining packages of 20 fixtures each were to be sold at a later date, including three rounds of mid-week fixtures and a bank holiday round. As Sky already owned the maximum number of matches it could hold without breaching a 148-match cap, it was speculated that at least one of the new packages could go to a new entrant, such as a streaming service. The five packages sold to BT and Sky were valued at £4.464 billion.[179] In June 2018, it was announced that Amazon Prime Video and BT had acquired the remaining two packages; Amazon acquired rights to 20 matches per-season, covering a mid-week round in December, and all Boxing Day fixtures.[180] The Amazon telecasts are produced in association with Sunset + Vine and BT Sport.[181] With the resumption of play in the 2019–20 Premier League due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom, the Premier League announced that all remaining matches would be carried on British television, split primarily across Sky, BT, and Amazon. A large number of these matches were also scheduled for free-to-air broadcasts, with Sky airing 25 on Pick, Amazon streaming its four matches on Twitch, and the BBC – for the first time in league history – carrying four live matches.[182][183][184][185] As matches would continue to be played without spectators upon the start of the 2020–21 Premier League, its clubs voted on 8 September to continue broadcasting all matches through at least September (with the BBC and Amazon each holding one additional match), and \"appropriate arrangements\" being made for October.[186][187] It was later announced that matches not selected for broadcast would be carried on pay-per-view via BT Sport Box Office and Sky Box Office at a cost of £14.95 per-match. The PPV scheme was poorly received; the Football Supporters' Federation felt that the price was too high, and there were concerns that it could encourage piracy. There were calls from supporters to boycott the pay-per-views, and make donations to support charitable causes instead (with Newcastle's \"Charity Not PPV\" campaign raising £20,000 for a local food bank, and Arsenal fans raising £34,000 for Islington Giving). On 13 November, amid the reintroduction of measures across the UK, the Premier League officially announced that the non-televised matches would be assigned to its main broadcast partners, and again including additional matches for the BBC and Amazon Prime.[188][189][190][191] The next cycle of rights between 2022–23 and 2024–25 season was renewed without tender due to compelling and exceptional circumstances in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, rights remained as they were since the 2019–20 season.[192] UK highlights In August 2016, it was announced the BBC would be creating a new magazine-style show for the Premier League entitled The Premier League Show.[193] The Premier League is the most-watched football league in the world, broadcast in 212 territories to 643 million homes and a potential TV audience of 4.7 billion people.[9] The Premier League's production arm, Premier League Productions, is operated by IMG Productions and produces content for its international television partners.[194] On 22 November 2024, the Premier League announced plans to end its agreement with IMG and take Premier League Productions in-house beginning in 2026–27.[195] The Premier League is the most widely distributed sports programme in Asia.[196] In the Indian subcontinent, the matches are broadcast live on STAR Sports.[197] In MENA region, BeIN Sports holds exclusive rights to the Premier League.[198] In China, the broadcast rights were awarded to iQiyi, Migu and CCTV that began in the 2021–22 season.[199][200][201] SCTV broadcast the matches for Indonesia, and Astro for Malaysia. In Australia, Optus telecommunications holds exclusive rights to the Premier League, providing live broadcasts and online access (Fox Sports formerly held rights).[202] As of the 2022–23 season, Canadian media rights to the Premier League are owned by FuboTV,[203] after having been jointly owned by Sportsnet and TSN, and most recently DAZN.[204] The Premier League is broadcast in the United States by NBC Sports, a division of Sky parent Comcast.[205] Acquiring the rights to the Premier League in 2013 (replacing Fox Soccer and ESPN), NBC Sports has been widely praised for its coverage.[206][207][208] NBC Sports reached a six-year extension with the Premier League in 2015 to broadcast the league until the end of the 2021–22 season in a deal valued at $1 billion (£640 million).[209][210] In November 2021, NBC reached another six-year extension through 2028 in a deal valued at $2.76 billion (£2 billion).[211][212] The Premier League is broadcast by SuperSport across sub-Saharan Africa.[213] Broadcasters to continental Europe until 2025 include Canal+ for France,[214] Sky Sport Germany for Germany and Austria,[215] Match TV for Russia,[216] Sky Sport Italy for Italy,[217] Eleven Sports for Portugal,[218] DAZN for Spain,[219] beIN Sports Turkey to Turkey,[220] Digi Sport for Romania,[221] and NENT to Nordic countries (Sweden, Denmark and Norway),[222] Poland and the Netherlands.[223] In South America, ESPN covers much of the continent,[224] with coverage in Brazil shared between ESPN Brasil and ESPN4.[225][226] Paramount+ broadcasts the league in Central America.[227] As of the 2023–24 season, Premier League football has been played in 61 stadiums since the formation of the division.[228] The Hillsborough disaster in 1989 and the subsequent Taylor Report saw a recommendation that standing terraces should be abolished. As a result, all stadiums in the Premier League are all-seater.[229][230] Since the formation of the Premier League, football grounds in England have seen constant improvements to capacity and facilities, with some clubs moving to new-build stadiums.[231] Eleven stadiums that have seen Premier League football have now been demolished. The stadiums for the 2023–24 season show a large disparity in capacity. For example, Old Trafford, the home of Manchester United, has a capacity of 74,031 whilst Dean Court, the home of Bournemouth, has a capacity of 11,307. The combined total capacity of the Premier League in the 2023–24 season is 787,002 with an average capacity of 39,350. Stadium attendances are a significant source of regular income for Premier League clubs.[232] For the 2022–23 season, average attendances across the league clubs were 40,235 for Premier League matches with an aggregate attendance of 15,289,340.[233] This represents an increase of 19,109 from the average attendance of 21,126 recorded in the Premier League's first season (1992–93).[234] However, during the 1992–93 season, the capacities of most stadiums were reduced as clubs replaced terraces with seats in order to meet the Taylor Report's 1994–95 deadline for all-seater stadiums.[235][236] The 2022–23 season also set a competition record for total attendance with more than 15 million spectators, with average attendance also reaching record levels, surpassing the previous record of 39,989 set in the 2021–22 season, which in turn broke over 70 years old record set in 1948–49 season.[237] In October 2024 it was reported that the government is planning to grant the independent regulator authority to stop Premier League clubs from selling their stadiums to affiliated or third-party companies.[238] I have never known this level before. Of course, there are managers in Germany, Italy, and Spain, but in the Premier League, these are the best managers, the elite managers. The quality, the preparation. The level is so high. Managers in the Premier League are involved in the day-to-day running of the team, including the training, team selection and player acquisition. Their influence varies from club-to-club and is related to the ownership of the club and the relationship of the manager with fans.[240] Managers are required to have a UEFA Pro Licence which is the final coaching qualification available, and follows the completion of the UEFA 'B' and 'A' Licences.[241] The UEFA Pro Licence is required by every person who wishes to manage a club in the Premier League on a permanent basis (i.e., more than 12 weeks, the amount of time an unqualified caretaker manager is allowed to take control).[242] Caretaker appointments are managers that fill the gap between a managerial departure and a new appointment. Several caretaker managers have gone on to secure a permanent managerial post after performing well as a caretaker, including Paul Hart at Portsmouth, David Pleat at Tottenham Hotspur and Ole Gunnar Solskjær at Manchester United. Arsène Wenger is the longest-serving manager, having been in charge of Arsenal in the Premier League from 1996 to his departure at the conclusion of the 2017–18 season, and holds the record for most matches managed in the Premier League with 828, all with Arsenal. He broke the record set by Alex Ferguson, who had managed 810 matches with Manchester United from the Premier League's inception to his retirement at the end of the 2012–13 season. Ferguson was in charge of Manchester United from November 1986 until his retirement at the end of the 2012–13 season, meaning he was manager for the last five years of the old Football League First Division and all of the first 21 seasons of the Premier League.[243] Notably, since its creation the Premier League has never been won by an English manager. There have been several studies into the reasoning behind, and effects of, managerial sackings. Most famously, Sue Bridgewater of the University of Liverpool and Bas ter Weel of the University of Amsterdam, performed two separate studies which helped to explain the statistics behind managerial sackings. Bridgewater's study found clubs generally sack their managers upon dropping below an average of one point per match.[244] Player transfers may only take place within transfer windows set by the Football Association. The two transfer windows run from the last day of the season to 31 August and from 31 December to 31 January. Player registrations cannot be exchanged outside these windows except under specific licence from the FA, usually on an emergency basis.[246] As of the 2010–11 season, the Premier League introduced new rules mandating that each club must register a maximum 25-man squad of players aged over 21, with the squad list only allowed to be changed in transfer windows or in exceptional circumstances.[247][248] This was to enable the \"home grown\" rule to be enacted, whereby the Premier League would also from 2010 require at least eight members of the named 25-man squad to be \"home-grown players\".[247] At the inception of the Premier League in 1992–93, just 11 players named in the starting line-ups for the first round of matches hailed from outside of the United Kingdom or Ireland.[249] By 2000–01, the number of foreign players participating in the Premier League was 36% of the total. In the 2004–05 season, the figure had increased to 45%. On 26 December 1999, Chelsea became the first Premier League side to field an entirely foreign starting line-up,[250] and on 14 February 2005, Arsenal were the first to name a completely foreign 16-man squad for a match.[251] By 2009, under 40% of the players in the Premier League were English.[252] By February 2020, 117 different nationalities had played in the Premier League, and 101 nationalities had scored in the competition.[253] In 1999, in response to concerns that clubs were increasingly passing over young English players in favour of foreign players, the Home Office tightened its rules for granting work permits to players from countries outside of the European Union.[254] A non-EU player applying for the permit must have played for his country in at least 75 per cent of its competitive 'A' team matches for which he was available for selection during the previous two years, and his country must have averaged at least 70th place in the official FIFA world rankings over the previous two years. If a player does not meet those criteria, the club wishing to sign him may appeal.[255] Following the implementation of Brexit in January 2021, new regulations were introduced which require all foreign players to obtain a Governing Body Endorsement (GBE) in order to play football in the United Kingdom, regardless of EU status.[256] Italics denotes players still playing professional football,Bold denotes players still playing in the Premier League. The Premier League Golden Boot is awarded each season to the top scorer in the division. Former Blackburn Rovers and Newcastle United striker Alan Shearer holds the record for most Premier League goals with 260.[258] Thirty-three players have reached the 100-goal mark.[259] Since the first Premier League season in 1992–93, 23 players from 11 clubs have won or shared the top scorer title.[260] Thierry Henry won his fourth overall scoring title by scoring 27 goals in the 2005–06 season. Erling Haaland holds the record for most goals in a Premier League season (38 matches) with 36 goals as of 15 May 2023.[261] Ryan Giggs of Manchester United holds the record for scoring goals in consecutive seasons, having scored in the first 21 seasons of the league.[262] Giggs also holds the record for the most Premier League assists, with 162.[263] There is no team or individual salary cap in the Premier League. As a result of the increasingly lucrative television deals, player wages rose sharply following the formation of the Premier League, when the average player wage was £75,000 per year.[264] In the 2018–19 season the average annual salary stood at £2.99 million. The total salary bill for the 20 Premier League clubs in the 2018–19 season was £1.62 billion; this compares to £1.05 billion in La Liga, £0.83 billion in Serie A, £0.72 billion in Bundesliga, and £0.54 billion in Ligue 1. The club with the highest average wage is Manchester United at £6.5 million. This is smaller than the club with the highest wage bill in Spain (Barcelona £10.5 million) and Italy (Juventus £6.7 million), but higher than in Germany (Bayern Munich £6.4 million) and France (Paris Saint-Germain £6.1 million). For the 2018–19 season, the ratio of the wages of the highest-paid team to lowest-paid in the Premier League is 6.82 to 1. This is much lower than in La Liga (19.1 to 1), Serie A (16 to 1), Bundesliga (20.5 to 1), and Ligue 1 (26.6 to 1). Because of the lower differential between team wage bills in the Premier League, it is often regarded as being more competitive than other top European leagues.[265] The record transfer fee for a Premier League player has risen steadily over the lifetime of the competition. Before the start of the first Premier League season, Alan Shearer became the first British player to command a transfer fee of more than £3 million.[266] The record has increased steadily and Enzo Fernández is now the most expensive transfer fee paid by a Premier League club at £106.8 million, whilst Philippe Coutinho is the biggest transfer involving a Premier League club at £105 million. The Premier League maintains two trophies – the genuine trophy (held by the reigning champions) and a spare replica. Two trophies are held for the purpose of making the award within minutes of the title being secured, in the event that on the final day of the season two clubs are still within reach of winning the League.[293] In the rare event that more than two clubs are vying for the title on the final day of the season, a replica won by a previous club is used.[294] The current Premier League trophy was created by Royal Jewellers Garrard & Co/Asprey of London and was designed in house at Garrard & Co by Trevor Brown and Paul Marsden. It consists of a trophy with a golden crown and a malachite plinth base. The plinth weighs 33 pounds (15 kg) and the trophy weighs 22 pounds (10.0 kg).[295] The trophy and plinth are 76 cm (30 in) tall, 43 cm (17 in) wide and 25 cm (9.8 in) deep.[296] Its main body is solid sterling silver and silver gilt, whilst its plinth is made of malachite, a semi-precious stone. The plinth has a silver band around its circumference, upon which the names of the title-winning clubs are listed. The green of the malachite represents the green field of play.[296] The design of the trophy is based on the heraldry of Three Lions that is associated with English football. Two of the lions are found above the handles on either side of the trophy – the third is symbolised by the captain of the title-winning team as he raises the trophy, and its gold crown, above his head at the end of the season.[297] The ribbons that drape the handles are presented in the team colours of the league champions that year.

                "content": "Men's Team Pep Guardiola’s defending champions had most of the ball but couldn’t take advantage against a resilient and dogged Toffees. Our only goal came after 14 minutes when Bernardo Silva swept home from a tight angle. Iliman Ndiaye then levelled out of the blue for the visitors before the first half was out. Erling Haaland had the chance to put us back ahead early in the second period but saw his penalty saved by Jordan Pickford. City pushed until the end but weren’t able to force a winner against Sean Dyche’s side. It means we won 18 of our 27 home matches in all competitions in 2024, scoring 65 goals. As with every final home game of the calendar year, the afternoon began with our annual pre-match ceremony to remember all connected with the club who have passed away over the previous 12 months. Once play got under way, City went straight on the front foot and could have had the lead inside three minutes when Josko Gvardiol’s towering header clattered into the near post. Everton set up in a defensive 4-5-1 formation, with City dominating possession and territory. And our pressure told in the 14th minute, when Jeremy Doku cut in from the left and played a pass in behind for Bernardo Silva to flick beyond Jordan Pickford on the slide. Picture Special We didn’t hold up there, quickly looking to add a second. That could have come as Erling Haaland rounded Pickford but, with the angle rapidly narrowing, he dug out a shot that was blocked by the covering Jarrad Branthwaite. Bernardo could and perhaps should have doubled the lead just after the half hour mark when Haaland and Foden linked up on the edge of the box to supply the tireless Portuguese midfielder. His shot, taken with the outside of his left foot, instead flew just wide of the far post. Despite City’s dominance, there was obvious frustration from Bernardo and Pep Guardiola on the touchline that the game wasn’t already beyond the visitors. The need to be clinical was emphasised a few moments later, as a rare Everton foray forward ended with their standout player Iliman Ndiaye arrowing a shot into the top corner from 15 yards out. City piled on the pressure in the closing stages of the first half, but determined last ditch defending in front of the Everton goal kept the scores level at the break. We started the second half as we had the first and Savinho was at the heart of our best work. The Brazilian winger first gave Vitaliy Mykolenko twisted blood before crossing in for Haaland, who couldn’t head on target, before a powerful half volley was blocked. When a player is in that mood, you give them the ball over and over. With his third run at the Everton defence in as many minutes, the 20-year-old was felled by Mykolenko and referee Simon Hooper awarded a penalty. Haaland stepped up but Pickford guessed correctly and when the rebound was crossed in for our No.9 to nod home, he was stood in an offside position. Everton rallied and could have taken the lead themselves as the game entered its final quarter when Abdoulaye Doucoure’s volley was deflected inches wide of Stefan Ortega Moreno‘s post. Hearts were in mouths all around the Etihad again in the 83rd minute when midfielder Orel Mangala stepped on to the ball 20 yards out and hit a low shot that Manuel Akanji deflected wide. The match ended frantically, with both sides attacking at pace but lacking the finishing touch to take all three points. CITY XI: Ortega Moreno, Lewis, Akanji, Ake (Simpson-Pusey 85), Gvardiol, Kovacic (Gundogan 85), Bernardo (C), Savinho, Foden, Doku (De Bruyne 75), Haaland Subs: Carson, Brits, Mubama, Alleyne, O’Reilly, McAtee EVERTON XI: Pickford, Coleman (c) (Patterson 90), Tarkowski, Branthwaite, Mykolenko, Mangala, Gana, Doucoure, Ndiaye (Lindstrom 81), Harrison, Calvert-Lewin (Broja 70) Subs: Virginia, Keane, Beto, O’Brien, Chermiti, Armstrong “We played really good but we are in the period right now that is what happens, we create, we concede the first time arrive. But yeah, keep going. “The performance against that team was really good offensively and defensively. We shot a lot inside the 18 yard box but unfortunately couldn’t get the result we wanted. “Now is time to recover and go there [Leicester] with the best mentality as possible. That is what we have to do.” “I don’t think we deserved this result no, I think we did a lot more in the game than Everton. “We created a lot of chances, but unfortunately we were only be able to score one goal and then we conceded a goal, out of basically nothing, but that’s how football is. “I think this was a game that we were able to score three, four goals, but the shots didn’t want to go in. “We need to believe until the last moment that we can win the match, but it wasn’t possible today.” Bernardo Silva - Always full of endeavour and a warrior on the pitch throughout his time at the Etihad. Guardiola famously said he feels ‘safer’ with his No.20 involved and with City far from our free-flowing best at the moment, Bernardo‘s intangible qualities have made him even more necessary to the boss than usual. A supremely gifted talent with the ball at his feet, it’s instead been his tireless energy that we’ve needed during a testing couple of months. His goal here was a fine example of the potential rewards from lung-bursting runs into the box. We have 28 points from 18 matches and, ahead of the rest of the Premier League playing over the next two days, move to sixth in the table. We travel to Leicester City for a 14:30 (UK) kick-off on Sunday 29 December in our final match of 2024.

Pep Guardiola's reigning Premier League champions have now won just one in their past 13 games across all competitions but started with plenty of verve and led in the 14th minute when Bernardo Silva slid home Jeremy Doku's pass via a deflection off Jarrad Branthwaite. Silva, captaining City as Kyle Walker sat out this one through illness to compound a weighty absentees list, should have doubled the lead after the half-hour when Phil Foden set him up to drive a venomous shot past the post. As they have so often during their remarkable downturn, Guardiola's team were made to pay for their profligacy. Manuel Akanji and Rico Lewis were unable to deal with a cross Abdoulaye Doucoure had an age to make and Iliman Ndiaye produced a delightful finish with the outside of his right boot. Venue: Etihad Stadium, ManchesterReferee: Simon Hooper Keep track of every game and every goal via SN's live Premier League scoreboard Starting Lineups: Man City (3-2-4-1, right to left): 18.

Jesper Lindstrom) Latest live updates | Team news and lineups | Where to watch where you are City began the second half in an attacking frenzy and looked set to be rewarded when the haphazard Vitaliy Mykolenko brought down Savinho in the 51st minute. The Ukraine full-back not receiving a second booking looked like it might be Everton's biggest reprieve of that flashpoint but Pickford outwitted Haaland, guessing correctly to his right to keep out a well-struck kick that was not close enough to the corner. Haaland headed home when Savinho got to the rebound but had strayed offside and the Norwegian's aerial play in the area was perplexing thereafter following another confidence-sapping moment. The torpid state of City's self-belief was on show as the more they strained for a winner, the more they left themselves exposed to an Everton sucker punch. Doucoure and Orel Mangala had effort deflated just wide and Jack Harrison passed up a great counter-attacking opportunity in stoppage time. Guardiola's quest for answers goes on. Latest live updates | Team news and lineups | Where to watch where you are Jordan Pickford's save from Erling Haaland's second-half penalty was the pivotal moment in this 1-1 draw. The City striker is the first player down the tunnel, he looks absolutely bereft. City were pretty good up until that point, with Iliman Ndiaye's fine equaliser coming against the run of play. But after the penalty miss all the collapsing confidence and mounting doubt from their slumpo of one win in 13 was on show. A more incisive opponent probably would have punished it, but Sean Dyche would gladly have taken a point apiece from their recent run of games against Arsenal, Chelsea and City when the fixtures came out. 90+5 mins: Everton break. They have men over! Ajkanji stands up to Harrison's shot. 90+4 mins: Foden looks to flip a ball over the Everton defence. Branthwaite deals with it and Foden makes absolutely sure Broja won't break by almost pulling his shorts down. A slapstick booking. 90+3 mins: Everton break. Here's Gueye. His cross is deflected behind. Offside. Stand down. City have the ball again. 90+1 mins: Lewis lets fly from outside the box but it's over. 90 mins: Six added minutes for either team to find a winner as Everton clear another City corner. 87 mins: Branthwaite clatters through Savinho, advantage played but De Bruyne can't make the cross with Haaland and Foden queueing up. 85 mins: Simpson-Pusey and Gundogan on for Ake and Kovacic for City. 83 mins: ALMOST 2-1 TO EVERTON! A thundering strike from Mangala takes a wicked deflection and flies wide with Ortega rooted. The corner is deep towards Tarkowski and teh City goalkeeper claims his header. 76 mins: Branthwaite makes a brilliant and vital tackle on Haaland on halfway but he's down in pain. It looked like City's No. 9 inadvertently trod on him. Quite frankly, that an awful lot of human to put their weight on you. 74 mins: Gvardiol has a shot blocked from outside the box. That looked like a team running out of ideas. Handily for City, here comes Kevin De Bruyne - a man with plenty of them. His compatriot Jeremy Doku makes way. Looks like Foden will come out to play on the left wing. 69 mins: Almost 2-1 to Everton! A well-constructed break ends with Harrison's cross finding Doucoure, who back-post effort is deflected behind by Lewis. The corner is absolutely rubbish and almost goes out for a throw. The excellent Calvert-Lewin makes way for Broja. The City fans sing for Kevin De Bruyne. 68 mins: Haaland grapples successfully with Branthwaite to keep a City attack alive. Lewis slides a pass towards the No. 9 but he's not on the same wavelength. 66 mins: Foden finds Haaland in the box but again he lacks his usual conviction. They come again but Savinho duffs a tame shot over the far post. City are playing well despite grappling with their own vanishing self-belief. It all makes for quite compelling viewing. 64 mins: Ake makes a brilliant last-ditch take as Calvert-Lewin looks to dart through on goal. This game is being played more and more in transitions and that suits Everton. 63 mins: Kovacic shoots but it's blocked because he wanted too many touches. 61 mins: Doku goes on a FIFA dribble entirely outside of this game's context and pierces into the Everton box. They scramble away as far as Silva, whose shot is blocked. 60 mins: Savinho seems to want Mykolenko for a second Christmas lunch. He wins a corner off the beleaguered full-back. Gvardiol prods over at the near post on the volley. Kevin De Bruyne is warming up. 58 mins: Tarkowski fouls Silva and that's a bit of a waste from an Everton point of view. 57 mins: Nice combination play from Ndiaye and Calvert-Lewin. Ake is equal to it. Everton corner. 53 mins: PICKFORD SAVES!!!!!!!!! The shot is hard and low but not in the corner and Pickford saves down to his right. The punchline for City? Savinho gets to the rebound, diverts it across goal for Haaland to head home... he's offside. 51 mins: PENALTY TO CITY! Mykolenko has been on the waltzers against Savinho all afternoon and brings him down. No second booking, Haaland to take. 50 mins: Silva wins a corner and takes it quickly. Haaland up at the back post, falls to Savinho... brilliant save from Pickford with his boot. Now Kovacic... just wide. 49 mins: Haaland gets up to Savinhos latest cross but can only nod across goal. City camped around the Everton box. 47 mins: Gvardiol gets a glancing touch on Foden's latest corner but Everton are able to hack out of the goalmouth. Silva who opened the scoring, gets us back underway. The next goal in this one feels huge. Gvardiol blocks Harrison's cross behind with his face. Not pleasant on a cold day. Calvert-Lewin heads over and that's that. City have been pretty good here, have gone ahead again but are no longer winning. The sort of stuff that gnaws at a the confidence of a team in their predicament and Everton have definitely warmed to their task. 45 mins: Kovacic...Haaland...Foden! Coleman slides in heroically. Another corner. This one is straight into Pickford's gloves. We'll have one added minute. 44 mins: The ball falls to Savinho from the set piece, who hits a rasping one that's blocked. 43 mins: Free-kiock into the wall. Akanji lumps a dicey pass to Lewis, who does well to keep his cool. Forward come the hosts again. Coleman thwarts Doku, now it's another corner. 42 mins: Brainless from Everton as a free-kick is clumped from halfway, Haaland wins the header and Silva releases Doku. He's fouled on the edge of the box by Mykolenko, who's booked. Foden over it. 41 mins: Ndiaye now gets all the way back to the left-back position and does as good a job of defending Savinho as anyone has today. He's had some five minutes. 40 mins: Everton come forward again, sensing the suffocating nervousness inside the Etihad. Ndiaye drives across goal but it comes to nought. 36 mins: GOOOOOAAAAAAALLLLLL!!!!!!! Iliman Ndiaye!!!!!!!! And that's what happens when you don't take your chances! City deal with the initial cross from Coleman but Everotn keep the attack alive. Doucoure's cross gets a a faint touch from Akanji, which takes Lewis out of the equation and Ndiaye finds an accomplished finish for his third Premier League goal of the season and first since mid-October. A special finish!Iliman Ndiaye has Everton level at the Etihad! 👀#PLonPrime #MCIEVE pic.twitter.com/RJhXeDq0YK 33 mins: OH, SHOULD BE 2-0 TO CITY! Haaland does well to collect a second ball, Foden squares to Silva, who is suddenly in oceans of space. He looks to drive a lavish outside-of-the-foot finish across Pickford, who looks on and pays and sees the ball whistle just past his left upright. Pep Guardiola's reaction to this Bernardo Silva chance says it all! 😲#PLonPrime #MCIEVE pic.twitter.com/SRL6gAe2EH 30 mins: Savinho on the charge again. He shoots this time as the Everton bodies converge and Pickford collects a looping ball near his goalline. It's impressive from the Brazil winger but he still needs to be more decisive in the final third. 28 mins: Everton corner from very little. Ndiaye's left-wing delivery is cleared at the near post. Gueye catches a shot sweetly from the edge of the box but Ortega is behind it all the way. 26 mins: Silva pings one over the Everton line for Haaland. He can't quite get it under his spell and Pickford does superbly. That said, you sense that a Haaland anywhere near top form would have probably made it 2-0. 23 mins: Foden slips a pass through to Haaland. There's maybe a bit too much on it, he rounds Pickford but the angle is then prohibitive and Branthwaite clears behind. Foden over the corner and Ake heads over at the near post. 21 mins: That's what Ecerton want. Calvert-Lewin smartly chests down a long ball forward, brining the support attackers into play. Ndiaye lays the ball back to Mangala 25 yards out. The midfielder curls high and wide of the target. 19 mins: Foden over a City free-kick. He drops an absolutely doozy of a Christmas gift onto the six-yard line. Ribbon, glittery paper, all sorts. No one is there to convert. 14 mins: GOOOOOOAAAAAAALLLLLLLLL!!!!!! Bernardo Silva!!!!!! Doku pulls out to the touchline and plays a wall pass to Silva. A classic Guardiola team move. The Portugal midfielder's scrapping qualities come to the fore as a he slides with the hulking Branthwaite and diverts a finish beyond Pickford into the far corner. Perfectly-timed run, and a fortuitous Bernardo Silva finish! ⚽️🔵Man City score the first goal of Boxing Day!#PLonPrime #MCIEVE pic.twitter.com/Et0IRU7nyL 13 mins: Savinho darting inside once more but he won't cut the trigger, much to the crowd's chagrin. At the other end, Gvardiol just played the hosts into a spot of bother, which gave Ake a chance to test his recently repaired hamstring. Something he may or may not appreciate. 12 mins: Lewis feeds Savinho, who leaves Mykolenko on his backside, The ball breaks for Haaland but onto his weaker right foot and the shot is blocked. 10 mins: This has perhaps predictably settled into attacks vs. defence, cat-and-mouse fayre. Everton packed behind the ball but their defensive line leaving just enough encouragement for City to try a little chip over for Haaland. Here's one and Pickford gathers. 6 mins: Silva is twice careless in possession in midfield and Everton get away the second time. Calvert-Lewin can't get on the end of Harrison's searching cross as he is well marshalled by Akanji and Ake. 4 mins: Now some fancy footwork from Savinho before Pickford pouches his low cross. The home faithful provide a full-throated response. 3 mins: Both City full-backs are pegged wide, leaving Mateo Kovacic to deal with the base of the midfield alone. The Croatian does that tidily before Savinho has a shot blocked. Coleman concedes a corner. Taken short, Foden dinks a cross... Gvardiol heads against the post! 2 mins: Everton look to go direct when a City attack breaks down following Gvardiol's misplaced pass but Calvert-Lewin is offside. We just observed a minute's silence for those associated with both clubs who have passed away during 2024, including ex-Everton striker Kevin Campbell and former City boss Sven-Goran Eriksson. Everton to kickoff and Gueye gets us underway. 5 mins before kickoff: Here they come, out into the cold and drizzle. Can City warm their fans spirits with a much-needed win or are Everton about to frustrate another of the Premier League's big hitters? 10 mins before kickoff: It's a foul day in east Manchester. Kickoff not far away but plenty of fans in both the bome and away sections appear to be sheltering indoors until the last possible moment. 🏡🩵 pic.twitter.com/EoF7cv45r0 30 mins before kickoff: Erling Haaland was pretty scathing of his own performances after City suffered their latest defeat at Aston Villa last time out. The big Norwegian has scored just three times in his past 12 Premier League games, while Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford has kept five clean sheets in his past six matches to lead the Golden Glove standings. Haaland scored both goals as City battled to a 2-0 win over an obdurate Everton in this fixture last season and it feels inevitable that he and Pickford will have a key say over the destination of the points this afternoon. 1 hour before kickoff: Here's the Everton side in full. Ashley Young's suspension means a first start since August for club captain Seamus Coleman. Doku and Savinho each starting for City with their capacity to switch wings could mean a lively lunchtime for the veteran. I'm sure he'll take it all in his stride. Your Toffees to face @ManCity!🔵 #MCIEVE pic.twitter.com/khQ4ayhIbK 1 hr 15 mins before kickoff: The teams are in and City have more fitness woes. Jack Grealish has a minor injury and Kyle Walker is ill. Both are not involved. Nathan Ake is back from a hamstring straight and starts, which feels risky for his long-term fitness, but needs must. Savinho and Jeremy Doku each start on the wings to prospectively add a little more verve and service Erling Haaland with a working supply line.

Of course, the City manager would never say that it loud and, in his programme notes for today's game, discussed the toughness and threat his side will face from Everton in glowing terms. However, his head-to-head with Dyche across the latter's spells with Burnley and Everton reads P17 W16 D1 L0 with 52 goals scored. Some of those games were tight, such as City's suffocatingly tense 1-0 win at Turf Moor during the 2018/19 title run-in, but some...weren't. There are four 5-0s in this selection and a couple of 4-1s. FULL-TIME Burnley 0-1 Man CitySergio Aguero’s 20th #PL goal of the season gets the champions over the line and back on top of the table#BURMCI pic.twitter.com/JoemAmvYgb 1 hr 40 mins before kickoff: Everton boss Sean Dyche has seen his team shutout title-chasing Arsenal and Chelsea in their past two games. Unsurprisingly, he fancies the assignment against a City team who have become increasingly gunshy around the opposition box and brittle at the other end during their sapping slump. Speaking before the match, Dyche tapped into the creeping end-of-empire feel that has started to gather around the Etihad Stadium over these hard winter months. You go there to win anyway but when the facts and stats start ­changing they add belief. That’s just the way sport works. If a team starts suffering a little bit then it adds belief to whoever is going there. Remember under Sir Alex when people went to Old Trafford? Even when they were down you would think they’d score in Fergie time. But once that started to break down a little bit people started to believe they could have a go. It’s not down to one team or one result, it’s down to that feel, and that is what changes. If we can capitalise on that then great, but it’s not that easy. They are still a top-class bunch of players. 2 hours before kickoff: Welcome to another blockbuster Boxing Day! Man City trained on Christmas Day in a bid to be primed and ready for the visit of Everton, with Guardiola and his players desperate for an upturn in performances and results. 💬 @ErlingHaaland's post-match reflection. The match kicks off in Manchester, UK at 12:30 p.m. local time. Here's how that time translates across some of the major territories: City are without Ruben Dias and John Stones, meaning Nathan Ake (hamstring) is the latest man to be haphazardly rushed back into a light and creaking backline. Goalkeeper Ederson missed the Villa Park trip — Guardiola said he did \"not feel good\" — and Matheus Nunes is also still out. They are joined on the sidelines by Kyle Walker (illness) and Jack Grealish (knock). Kevin De Bruyne did not get off the bench last time out and is among the substitutes again, where he and Ilkay Gundogan account for almost all of the senior football experience at Guardiola's disposla.

Apple iPad 10th Gen ($279, originally $349): This iPad is one of the best tablets you can buy, period.

And you can revamp your arsenal for a steal: We're seeing lots of post-Christmas sales on some of the most sought-after appliance and cookware brands, from KitchenAid stand mixers to the Yahoo editor-approved Our Place Always Pan (celebs love it too). That gets a resounding, \"Yes, Chef!\" KitchenAid 5.5-Quart Bowl-Lift Stand Mixer ($280, originally $450): Need a more industrial option? Here ya go!

Our Place Always Pan 2.0 ($99, originally $150): This multi-use, nonstick beauty might become your most-reached-for piece of cookware, thanks to its thoughtful design. It took the internet by storm a few years ago and quickly became a favorite of home cooks and celebs alike.

Whether you're dreaming of a closet overhaul or just need a new pair of boots, now is the time to scoop up some serious style steals. Why so many markdowns? Retailers are trying to clear their e-racks to make room for spring looks, which translates to big savings on cold weather essentials — and with at least two more months of winter chill, we're there for it.

Here are some we have our eye on: Gloria Vanderbilt Classic High Rise Amanda Tapered Jeans ($20, originally $48): If you're looking for denim that's designed to fit women of all shapes and sizes, the Amanda jeans definitely fit the bill (pun intended). They're a classic high-rise pair that sits at your natural waist and will go with just about anything. Colorfulkoala Women's Dreamlux Leggings ($29, originally $35): Not only do these leggings boast thousands of 5-star reviews, senior deals writer Britt penned her own love letter to her pair: \"If you're looking for leggings that are comparable to Lululemon, Colorfulkoala Dreamlux leggings are an affordable alternative (though they're supremely comfortable in their own right). You can stock up on several colors for less than half the price of many high-end brands, which I'd very much advise doing.\" Cozy Earth Long-Sleeve Bamboo Pajama Set ($117, originally $195): This pajama set is a favorite of Oprah’s for a reason: It's made nearly entirely from bamboo, plus it's super stretchy, doesn't pill and feels cool on the skin.

Elegant and classic, it's right at home alongside everything from jeans and a white tee to a polished office look or date night 'fit. You can even match it up with the marshmallowiest of winter puffer coats and it'd still be cute. Fantaslook Plaid Flannel Shirt ($17, originally $70): Stride out for flannel season in style!

Apple AirTag 4-Pack ($70, originally $99): Keep tabs on your essentials with ease using these sleek trackers.

                "content": "The Seattle Seahawks are a professional American football team based in Seattle. The Seahawks compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the National Football Conference (NFC) West division. The club entered the NFL as an expansion team in 1976 in the NFC. From 1977 to 2001, Seattle was assigned to the American Football Conference (AFC) West; the team rejoined the NFC in 2002. They have played their home games at Lumen Field in Seattle's SoDo neighborhood since 2002, having previously played home games in the Kingdome (1976–1999) and Husky Stadium (1994 and 2000–2001).[a] Seahawks fans have been referred to collectively as the \"12s\" (formerly the \"12th Man\"),[11][12][13] or the \"12th Fan\".[14][15][16][17][18] The team's fans twice set the Guinness World Record for the loudest crowd noise at a sporting event within the span of a few months, first registering 136.6 decibels during a game against the San Francisco 49ers in September 2013,[19] and later registering 137.6 dB during a Monday Night Football game against the New Orleans Saints that December.[20][21] As the only NFL team based in the Pacific Northwest region of North America, the Seahawks attract support from a wide geographical area that includes parts of the U.S. states of Alaska, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and Utah, as well as the Canadian province of British Columbia.[22] The Seahawks have won 11 division titles and three conference championships, and are the only team to have played in both the AFC and NFC Championship Games. They have reached three Super Bowls, losing 21–10 to the Pittsburgh Steelers at Super Bowl XL, defeating the Denver Broncos 43–8 for their first championship at Super Bowl XLVIII, and losing 28–24 to the New England Patriots at Super Bowl XLIX. Players Kenny Easley, Walter Jones, Steve Hutchinson, Cortez Kennedy, and Steve Largent have been voted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame primarily or wholly for their accomplishments as Seahawks. In addition, players Dave Brown, Jacob Green, Dave Krieg, Curt Warner, Jim Zorn, Matt Hasselbeck and Shaun Alexander have been inducted into the Seahawks Ring of Honor, along with head coaches Chuck Knox, and Mike Holmgren, radio announcer Pete Gross, and franchise owner Paul Allen. As per one of the agreed parts of the 1970 AFL–NFL merger, the NFL began planning to expand from 26 to 28 teams.[23] In June 1972, Seattle Professional Football Inc., a group of Seattle business and community leaders, announced their intention to acquire an NFL franchise for the city of Seattle.[24] In June 1974, the NFL gave the city an expansion franchise.[25] That December, NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle announced the official signing of the franchise agreement by Lloyd W. Nordstrom, representing the Nordstrom family as majority partners for the consortium.[26] In March 1975, John Thompson, former executive director of the NFL Management Council and a former Washington Huskies executive, was hired as the general manager of the new team. The name Seattle Seahawks (\"seahawk\" is another name for osprey) was selected on June 17, 1975, after a public naming contest which drew more than 20,000 entries and over 1,700 names.[27] These include skippers, pioneers, and lumberjacks.[28] Thompson recruited and hired Jack Patera, a Minnesota Vikings assistant coach, to be the first head coach of the Seahawks; the hiring was announced on January 3, 1976. The expansion draft was held March 30–31, 1976, with Seattle and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers alternating picks for rounds selecting unprotected players from the other 26 teams in the league.[29] The Seahawks were awarded the 2nd overall pick in the 1976 draft, a pick they used on defensive tackle Steve Niehaus. The team took the field for the first time on August 1, 1976, in a pre-season game against the San Francisco 49ers in the then newly opened Kingdome. The Seahawks are the only NFL team to switch conferences twice in the post-merger era.[33] The franchise began play in 1976 in the aforementioned NFC West but switched conferences with the Buccaneers after one season and joined the AFC West. This realignment was dictated by the league as part of the 1976 expansion plan, so that both expansion teams could play each other twice and every other NFL franchise once (the ones in their conference at the time) during their first two seasons. The Seahawks won both matchups against the Buccaneers in their first two seasons, the former of which was the Seahawks' first regular season victory.[34][35] In 1983, the Seahawks hired Chuck Knox as head coach. Finishing with a 9–7 record, the Seahawks made their first post-season appearance, defeating the Denver Broncos in the Wild Card Round, and then the Miami Dolphins, before losing in the AFC Championship to the eventual Super Bowl champion Los Angeles Raiders. The following season, the Seahawks had their best season to that point, finishing 12–4; it would remain the best win–loss record in franchise history until their 2005 season.[36] Knox won the NFL Coach of the Year Award.[37] In 1988, Ken Behring and partner Ken Hofmann purchased the team for a reported $80 million.[38][39][40] The Seahawks won their first division title in 1988, but would miss the playoffs for the following three seasons, after which Knox left the team.[41] For most of the 1990s, the Seahawks continued to struggle. They saw three consecutive losing seasons (1992–1994) under head coach Tom Flores, including a franchise worst 2–14 season in 1992. Following the 1994 season, Flores was fired from the team and Dennis Erickson was brought in as head coach.[42][43][44][45][46] In 1996, Behring and Hoffman transferred the team's operations to Anaheim, California–a widely criticized move, although the team continued to play in Seattle. The team almost relocated, and was in bankruptcy for a short period. The NFL threatened Behring with fining him $500,000 a day if he did not move the team's operations back to Seattle;[47] with this, Behring and Hoffman sold the team to Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen in 1997 for $200 million.[48] Erickson's tenure as head coach ended after the 1998 season; the Seahawks missed the playoffs for all four of his seasons with the team, extending their \"playoff drought\" to ten consecutive seasons.[49] In 1999, Mike Holmgren was hired as head coach.[50] He would coach for 10 seasons.[51] The Seahawks won their second division title, as well as a wild card berth in the playoffs, losing to the Miami Dolphins 20–17. In 2002, the Seahawks returned to the NFC West as part of an NFL realignment plan that gave each conference four balanced divisions of four teams each. This realignment restored the AFC West to its initial post-merger roster of original AFL teams Denver, San Diego, Kansas City, and Oakland.[52] That same year, the team opened its new home stadium, Seahawks Stadium, after spending the last two seasons at Husky Stadium after the Kingdome's implosion in 2000.[53] In the 2005 season, the Seahawks had their best season in franchise history (a feat that would later be matched in 2013) with a record of 13–3,[54] which included a 42–0 rout of the Philadelphia Eagles in a Monday Night Football game.[55] The 13–3 record earned them the number one seed in the NFC.[54] They defeated the Washington Redskins in the Divisional Round and won the NFC Championship Game against the Carolina Panthers, but lost in Super Bowl XL against the Pittsburgh Steelers. The loss was controversial; NFL Films has Super Bowl XL at number 8 on its top ten list of games with controversial referee calls.[56] Referee Bill Leavy later admitted that he missed calls that altered the game.[57] Before 2005, the Seahawks had not won a playoff game since the 1984 season, a streak of 21 years (five teams had ever had a drought of twenty years at the time, with their six straight losses being tied for third-most in history). That drought was ended with a 20–10 win over the Washington Redskins in the 2005 playoffs.[58] In the 2006 season, the Seahawks finished 9–7 and won the NFC West.[59] The defeated the Dallas Cowboys 21–20 in the Wild Card Round before losing to the Chicago Bears 27–24 in the Divisional Round.[60][61] In the 2007 season, the Seahawks finished 10–6 and won the NFC West.[62] The team defeated Washington in the Wild Card Round 35–14 before losing to the Green Bay Packers in the Divisional Round 42–20.[63][64] The 2008 season saw the team go 4–12 and finish third in the NFC West.[65] Holmgren departed from the team after the 2008 season, following the end of his contract.[66] Defensive backs coach Jim L. Mora was named as Holmgren's successor.[67] In 2009, the Seahawks finished 3rd in the NFC West with a 5–11 record.[68] Shortly after, Mora was fired on January 8, 2010 [69] and Pete Carroll was hired. In the 2010 NFL season, the Seahawks made history by making it into the playoffs despite having a 7–9 record.[70] They had the best record in a division full of teams with losing seasons (Seahawks 7–9, Rams 7–9, 49ers 6–10, Cardinals 5–11) and won the decisive season finale against the Rams (not only by overall record, but by division record, as both teams coming into the game had a 3–2 division record).[71] In the playoffs, the Seahawks beat the defending Super Bowl XLIV champs, the New Orleans Saints, 41–36. The Seahawks made even more history during the game with Marshawn Lynch's 67-yard run, breaking 9 tackles, to clinch the victory. After the run, the fans reacted so loudly that a small earthquake (a bit above 2 on the Richter Scale) was recorded by seismic equipment around Seattle.[72] Lynch's run would be nicknamed the \"Beast Quake\". The Seahawks lost to the Bears in their second game, 35–24.[73] The 2011 season saw the team go 7–9 once again, but they were not able to get into the postseason with a third-place finish in the NFC West.[74] The 2012 NFL season started with doubt, as the Seahawks lost their season opener against the Arizona Cardinals. The highly touted Seattle defense gave up a go-ahead score late in the fourth quarter, and rookie quarterback Russell Wilson failed to throw the game-winning touchdown after multiple attempts in the red-zone. However, Russell Wilson and the Seahawks went 4–1 in their next five games en route to an 11–5 overall record (their first winning record since 2007). Their 2012 campaign included big wins over the Green Bay Packers, New England Patriots, and San Francisco 49ers. The Seahawks went into the playoffs as the No. 5 seed and the only team that season to go undefeated at home. In the Wild Card Round, the Seahawks overcame a 14-point deficit to defeat the Washington Redskins.[75] This was the first time since the 1983 Divisional Round that the Seahawks won a playoff game on the road.[76] However, in the 2012 Divisional Round, overcoming a 20-point, fourth-quarter deficit would not be enough to defeat the #1 seed Atlanta Falcons. An ill-advised timeout and a defensive breakdown late in the game cost the Seahawks their season, as they lost, 30–28.[77] Quarterback Russell Wilson won the 2012 Pepsi MAX Rookie of the Year award.[78] In the 2013 NFL season, the Seahawks continued their momentum from the previous season, finishing tied with the Denver Broncos for an NFL-best regular season record of 13–3, while earning the NFC's #1 playoff seed.[79][80] Their 2013 campaign included big wins over the Carolina Panthers, New Orleans Saints, and the San Francisco 49ers.[81] Six Seahawks players were named to the Pro Bowl: Quarterback Russell Wilson, center Max Unger, running back Marshawn Lynch, cornerback Richard Sherman, free safety Earl Thomas, and strong safety Kam Chancellor.[82] However, none of them were able to play in the Pro Bowl, as the Seahawks defeated the New Orleans Saints 23–15 and the San Francisco 49ers 23–17, in the playoffs to advance to Super Bowl XLVIII against the Denver Broncos.[83][84] On February 2, 2014, the Seahawks won the franchise's only Super Bowl Championship, defeating Denver 43–8.[85] The Seahawks' defense performance in 2013 was acclaimed as one of the best in the Super Bowl era.[86] The 2014 campaign saw the team lose some key pieces, including wide receiver Golden Tate to free agency and wide receiver Sidney Rice and defensive end Chris Clemons to retirement. Percy Harvin was also let go mid-season after several underachieving weeks and clashes with the rest of the locker room.[87] Despite starting 3–3, they rallied to a 12–4 record, good enough once again for the #1 seed in the NFC Playoffs.[88][89] After dispatching the Carolina Panthers handily in the Divisional Round 31–17,[90] they faced the Green Bay Packers in the NFC Championship Game. Despite five turnovers and trailing 19–7 late in the contest, the Seahawks prevailed in overtime to reach Super Bowl XLIX against the New England Patriots,[91] but an ill-fated interception at the 1-yard line late in the championship game stymied a comeback attempt and thwarted the Seahawks' bid to be the first repeat Super Bowl champions since the Patriots had won Super Bowls XXXVIII and XXXIX.[92] The Seahawks returned to the playoffs in both 2015 and 2016, but despite winning the Wild Card game in both years they failed to win either Divisional round game on the road.[93][94][95][96] The 2017 iteration of the team missed the playoffs for the first time in six years, as injuries to their core players coupled with disappointing acquisitions of running back Eddie Lacy and kicker Blair Walsh failed them in a competitive NFC.[97] The team cut ties with most of the remaining players that had been part of their meteoric rise and turnover both their Offensive and Defensive coaching staff in 2018, and an influx of young talent helped propel the team to a 10–6 record and another playoff berth that ultimately ended in a loss in the Wild Card game to the Dallas Cowboys.[98][99] In October 2018, owner Paul Allen died after a prolonged fight with cancer.[100] In 2019, the Seahawks put up their best record since their last trip to the Super Bowl at 11–5, but they still lost 3 out of their last 4 games and lost their chance to win the NFC West.[101] A likely explanation for their sloppy finish is because many of their players were injured late in the season. After defeating the Philadelphia Eagles 17–9 in the Wild Card game,[102] they lost to the Green Bay Packers in the Divisional round, failing another attempt at a second Super Bowl.[103] The 2020 season saw the Seahawks win their first five games, a franchise-best for a start to a season.[104] Despite the Seahawks losing three of their next four games, the Seahawks finished strong, earning twelve victories for the first time since their Super Bowl season in 2014, and winning the division for the first time in four years.[105] However, despite the 12–4 record and the division title, the Seahawks' season ended the following week against the Los Angeles Rams, who never trailed in a 30–20 victory.[106] The Seahawks struggled and started the 2021 season 3–8. Russell Wilson had an injured finger missing 3 games and the Seahawks were shut out the first time in the Wilson era in Week 10 against the Green Bay Packers.[107] This was their worst first half of a season since 2009, under then-head coach Jim Mora. The Seahawks were eliminated from playoff contention on December 26 in a loss to the Chicago Bears, and they finished last in their division for the first time since 1996.[108][109] With wins over the Detroit Lions and the Arizona Cardinals they finished 7–10.[110] Following the 2021 season was an offseason of continuing change, punctuated with the trade of quarterback Russell Wilson to the team he and the Seahawks beat in Super Bowl XLVIII, the Denver Broncos, on March 6, 2022. The Broncos traded quarterback Drew Lock, tight end Noah Fant, defensive end Shelby Harris, two first round picks (for that year's draft, No. 9 overall, and 2023's), two second round picks (that year's, No. 40 overall, and 2023's) and a 2022 fifth round selection to the Seahawks for Wilson and a 2022 fourth round pick. Another hallmark franchise player from the Super Bowl-winning Seahawks, former All-Pro linebacker Bobby Wagner, was also cut by the team that same day, a move that saves them $16.6 million in cap space. The Seahawks also took on $26 million in dead money by trading Wilson; ESPN Stats & Information research revealed it to be the second-most dead money a team has ever incurred, trailing the $33.8 million the Philadelphia Eagles ate in their trade of Carson Wentz the previous year.[111] In the 2022 season, the Seahawks finished with a 9–8 record and made the playoffs.[112] The team's season ended in the Wild Card round with a 41–23 loss to the San Francisco 49ers.[113] The 2023 season saw the Seahawks finish 9–8 and miss the postseason.[114] Carroll was fired from his head coaching position after the 2023 season.[115] Carroll remained with the team in an unspecified advisory role.[116] Mike Macdonald, formerly defensive coordinator of the Baltimore Ravens, was hired as the new head coach.[117] When the Seahawks debuted in 1976, the team's logo was a stylized royal blue and forest green osprey's head based on Kwakwakaʼwakw art masks.[118] The helmet and pants were silver while the home jerseys were royal blue with white and green sleeve stripes and white numerals and names. The road jersey was white, with white, blue and green sleeve stripes and had blue numerals and names. The socks were blue and had the same green and white striping pattern seen on the blue jerseys. Black shoes were worn for the first four seasons, one of the few NFL teams that did so in the late 1970s, at a time when most teams were wearing white shoes. They would switch to white shoes in 1980.[119][120] In 1983, coinciding with the arrival of Chuck Knox as head coach, the uniforms were updated slightly. The striping on the arms now incorporated the Seahawks logo, and the TV numbers, previously located on the sleeves, moved onto the shoulders. The helmet facemasks changed from gray to blue. Also, the socks went solid blue at the top, and white on bottom.[121] In the 1985 season, the team wore 10th Anniversary patches on the left side of their pants. It had the Seahawks logo streaking through the number 10. In 1994, the year of the NFL's 75th Anniversary, the Seahawks changed the style of their numbering to something more suitable for the team; Pro Block from then until 2001. That same year, the Seahawks wore a vintage jersey for select games resembling the 1976–82 uniforms. However, the helmet facemasks remained blue. The logos also became sewn on instead of being screen-printed. In 2000, Shaun Alexander's rookie year and Cortez Kennedy's last, the Seattle Seahawks celebrated their 25th Anniversary; the logo was worn on the upper left chest of the jersey. In 2001, the Seahawks switched to the new Reebok uniform system still in their then-current uniforms after that company signed a 10-year deal to be the exclusive uniform supplier to the NFL, but it would be their last in this uniform after the season ended. Prior to this, various companies made the team's uniforms. On March 1, 2002, to coincide with the team moving to the NFC as well as the opening of Seahawks Stadium (later renamed Qwest, CenturyLink, and currently Lumen Field), both the logo and the uniforms were heavily redesigned. The Wordmark was designed by Mark Verlander and the logo was designed by NFL Properties in-house design team. The colors were modified to a lighter \"Seahawks Blue\", a darker \"Seahawks Navy\" and lime green piping. The helmets also were changed from silver to the lighter \"Seahawks Blue\" color after a fan poll was conducted. Silver would not be seen again until 2012. The logo artwork was also subtly altered, with an arched eyebrow and a forward-facing pupil suggesting a more aggressive-looking bird. At first, the team had planned to wear silver helmets at home and blue helmets on the road, but since NFL rules forbid the use of multiple helmets, the team held the fan poll to decide which color helmet would be worn. The team had usually worn all blue at home and all white on the road since 2003, but late in the 2009 season, the Seahawks wore the white jersey-blue pants combo. The blue jersey and white pants combo has been worn for only one regular-season game, the 2005 season opener at the Jacksonville Jaguars, while the white jersey and blue pants combination has not been worn regularly since late in the 2002 season, with the exception of late in the 2009 season. In 2009, the Seahawks once again wore the white jersey and blue pants combination for road games against Minnesota (November 22), St. Louis (November 29), Houston (December 13), and Green Bay (December 27). The Seahawks wore their home blue jerseys during Super Bowl XL despite being designated as the visitor, since the Pittsburgh Steelers, the designated home team, elected to wear their white jerseys. On September 27, 2009, the Seahawks wore lime green jerseys for the first time, paired with new dark navy blue pants in a game against the Chicago Bears. The jerseys matched their new sister team, the expansion Seattle Sounders FC of Major League Soccer who wear green jerseys with blue pants. On December 6, 2009, the Seahawks wore their Seahawks blue jersey with the new dark navy blue pants for the first time, in a game against the San Francisco 49ers. The Seahawks broke out the same combo two weeks later against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and two weeks after that in the 2009 regular-season finale against the Tennessee Titans. In December 2009, then-coach Jim Mora announced that the new lime green jerseys were being retired because the team did not win in them, because he liked the standard blue home jerseys better, and added that the home jersey is a better match for the navy pants.[122] In the same press conference, he stated that the new navy pants \"felt better\" on players as opposed to the Seahawks blue pants. For the 2010 season, Seattle returned to the traditional all \"Seahawks Blue\" at home and all white on the road. On April 3, 2012, Nike, which took over as the official uniform supplier for the league from Reebok, unveiled new uniform and logo designs for the Seahawks for the 2012 season. The new designs incorporate a new accent color, \"Wolf Grey\", and the main colors are \"College Navy\" and \"Action Green\".[5][6] The uniforms incorporate \"feather trims\", multiple feathers on the crown of the helmet, twelve feathers printed on the neckline and down each pant leg to represent the \"12th Man\", referring to the team's fans.[123][124] The Seahawks have three different jersey colors: navy blue, white, and an alternate grey jersey. The Seahawks will have three different pants: navy blue with green feathers, gray with navy blue feathers, and white with navy blue feathers. Their new logo replaces the Seahawk blue with wolf grey. Altogether, there are nine different uniform combinations possible. The Seahawks wore their Nike home blue jerseys for the first regular-season game on September 16, 2012, against the Dallas Cowboys. The uniform Marshawn Lynch wore in that game is preserved at the Pro Football Hall of Fame.[125] On September 9, 2012, the Seahawks wore their Nike white away jerseys for the first regular-season game against the Arizona Cardinals; on October 14, 2012, with the Carolina Panthers wearing white at home, they wore their blue jerseys with gray pants (and would do so again against the Miami Dolphins seven weeks later); and on December 16, 2012, they wore their Alternate Wolf Grey jerseys for the first time against the Buffalo Bills.[126] The all-navy ensemble is the Seahawks' current primary uniform option for home games. Initially, the Seahawks paired their navy uniforms with gray pants on select road games in which the home team wore white jerseys, but on December 5, 2021, the Seahawks wore this combination at home for the first time in a game against the San Francisco 49ers. On the road, the Seahawks primarily pair their white uniforms with the navy pants (that combination was used during their Super Bowl XLVIII win), although they also pair the white uniforms with either white or gray pants on occasion. The all-gray uniforms were worn occasionally on the road, mainly against the Arizona Cardinals. In 2016, the Seahawks unveiled their NFL Color Rush uniform, an all-Action Green ensemble.[127] They first wore the uniform on December 16 against the Los Angeles Rams at home, marking the first time they wore green uniforms since 2009. The Seahawks continue to wear the Color Rush set as an alternate uniform alongside the all-gray combination. During a home matchup with the Vikings on December 3, 2019, the Seahawks wore their Color Rush green tops and regular navy pants.[128] The combination was used again on October 11, 2020, also against the Vikings, and then again on November 19, against the Arizona Cardinals. It was used once in 2021, on Thursday Night Football vs. the Rams. In July 2023, the Seahawks introduced a throwback uniform set inspired by the team's 1983–2001 design. These uniforms were worn in Week 8 against the Cleveland Browns.[129] Consequently, the gray alternate tops were retired due to NFL regulations restricting teams to two alternate jerseys.[130] Prior to 2023, the Seahawks were the only NFL team to have never worn white jerseys in a home game.[131] However, on September 24, 2023, the Seahawks wore their white jerseys at home for the first time, doing so against the Carolina Panthers. The game served as the 10th anniversary of the Seahawks' first Super Bowl victory, as the current team wore the same white jersey/navy pants combination from Super Bowl XLVIII.[132] The rivalry between the Seahawks and Los Angeles Rams came into existence in 2002 following the Seahawks' relocation to the NFC West. The first notable matchup between the two clubs occurred in the 2004 NFC Wild card round when the Rams managed to defeat the Seahawks in Seattle 27–20 and currently hold the streak for the only two wins against the Seahawks at home during the postseason. Much of the intensity waned as the Rams declined in competition throughout the 2000s and early 2010s, but several notable matchups between the two clubs would still occur. The rivalry saw new life as the Rams' Mob Squad-era teams regularly clashed with Seattle's Legion of Boom era teams, often escalating into bitter grudge matches for control of the division.[133][134] Following the Rams' return to Los Angeles in 2016, and subsequent playoff success (most recently with a Super Bowl victory in 2022); the rivalry has increased in intensity; especially as Seattle's Legion of Boom era teams waned in competition.[135] Due to the recent dominance by the Rams under Sean McVay and former defensive tackle Aaron Donald, Seahawks fans have recently viewed the Rams as their divisional arch rival.[136] Tensions especially ran high during the 2021 Wild Card game following a widely publicized taunt from Safety Jamal Adams during a postgame conference after a tough win over the Rams during week 16. The Rams would go onto decimate the Seahawks in the wild card game, with cornerback Jalen Ramsey and quarterback Jared Goff expressing their satisfaction to get retribution following Adams' comments and cigar gesture.[137] As of the 2023 season, the Seahawks lead the series 27–26, but the Rams have won both playoff meetings.[138] From 2011 to 2014, the Seahawks and the San Francisco 49ers emerged as two of the best teams in the NFC, and developed a rivalry as a result. The 49ers head coach at the time, Jim Harbaugh, had a contentious history with Seahawks coach Pete Carroll due to Harbaugh's previous job as coach at Stanford against Carroll's USC Trojans. Harbaugh's 49ers won the first three head-to-head contests but lost Week 16 of 2012. Both teams reached the playoffs that year, however the 49ers reached Super Bowl XLVII, which they lost. In 2013, the Seahawks won in a Week 2 contest, but the 49ers would triumph in Week 14. The Seahawks would beat the 49ers in the 2013 season NFC Championship Game 23–17 in a controversial win. The Seahawks went on to win the next 10 matchups, sweeping the regular season series against the 49ers from 2014 to 2018. Since then, however, the 49ers have won the last five contests against the Seahawks, winning the 2022 season regular season series, and a playoff matchup, as well as the 2023 regular season series. As of the 2023 season, the Seahawks lead the series 30–22.[139] The Arizona Cardinals and Seahawks became divisional rivals after both were relocated to the NFC West as a result of the league's realignment in 2002. This rivalry has become one of the NFL's more bitter in recent years, as the mid-to-late 2010s often saw the Seahawks and Cardinals squaring off for NFC West supremacy. The rivalry hit its peak as the Cardinals frequently clashed with the Legion Of Boom-era Seahawks led by Russell Wilson and head coach Pete Carroll, although Seattle shares more intense rivalries with the Rams and 49ers. Seattle leads the series 27–22–1, and the two teams have yet to meet in the playoffs.[140] Since moving to the NFC, the Seahawks have faced the Green Bay Packers several times in the playoffs, developing an intense rivalry as well. Some notable moments include the clubs' first playoff meeting in 2003 in which Seahawks quarterback Matt Hasselbeck threw a game-losing pick-six in overtime after guaranteeing a game-winning drive,[141] the Fail Mary, and Russell Wilson overcoming four interceptions and a 16–0 Packers lead to lead Seattle to a 28–22 overtime win to advance to Super Bowl XLIX.[142] As of the 2023 season, the Packers lead the all-time series 15–9.[143] From the 1980s to the 2002 league realignment, the Denver Broncos were a major rival for the Seahawks.[144][145] As of the 2023 season, the Broncos lead 35–23 against the Seahawks with Seattle having won both postseason meetings.[146] Since 2002, Denver has won three of five interconference meetings, and the teams met in Super Bowl XLVIII on February 2, 2014, where the Seahawks won 43–8.[147] On March 8, 2022, the Seattle Seahawks agreed to trade Russell Wilson and a 2022 fourth-round pick to the Denver Broncos for quarterback Drew Lock, tight end Noah Fant, defensive lineman Shelby Harris, two first-round picks (2022—No. 9 overall—and 2023), two second-round picks (2022—No. 40 overall—and 2023) and a 2022 fifth-round selection.[148] Russell Wilson's first game against the Seattle Seahawks as a member of the Denver Broncos was played September 12, 2022, on Monday Night Football, where the Seahawks won 17–16.[149] The Raiders and Seahawks played many times being old members of the AFC West. Seattle's move to the NFC has made the matchup occur much less frequently, playing only five times since the end of the 2002 season. The Raiders lead the all-time series 30–26.[150] During the Seahawks' first ten seasons (1976–85), the team's headquarters was in Kirkland at the southern end of the Lake Washington Shipyard (now Carillon Point), on the shores of Lake Washington.[151] The summer training camps were held across the state at Eastern Washington University in Cheney, southwest of Spokane. When the team's new headquarters across town in Kirkland was completed in 1986, the Seahawks held training camp at home for the next eleven seasons (1986–96), staying in the dormitories of the adjacent Northwest College. In 1997, Dennis Erickson's third season as head coach, the team returned to the hotter and more isolated Cheney for training camp, which continued through 2006. In 2007, training camp returned to the Seahawk's Kirkland facility because of the scheduled China Bowl (NFL) game, which was later canceled. In 2008, the Seahawks held the first three weeks of camp in Kirkland, then moved to the new 19-acre (77,000 m2) Virginia Mason Athletic Center (VMAC) on August 18 for the final week of training camp, where the team has held their training camps since. The new facility, adjacent to Lake Washington in Renton, has four full-size practice fields: three natural grass outdoors and one FieldTurf indoors.[152] As of the end of the 2023 season, the Seattle Seahawks have competed in 48 NFL seasons, dating back to their expansion year of 1976. The team has compiled a 392–366–1 (.517) regular-season record and a 17–19 (.472) record in the playoffs, for an overall record of 409–385–1 and a .515 winning percentage.[153] Seattle has reached the playoffs in 20 separate seasons, including in the 2005 season when they lost Super Bowl XL to the Pittsburgh Steelers, the 2013 season when they defeated the Denver Broncos to win Super Bowl XLVIII, and the 2014 season when they lost Super Bowl XLIX to the New England Patriots. In the 2010 season, the Seahawks became the first team in NFL history to earn a spot in the playoffs with a losing record (7–9, .438) in a full season; this was by winning the division. The Seahawks would go on to defeat the reigning Super Bowl champion New Orleans Saints in the Wild Card round, becoming the first team ever to win a playoff game with a losing record. Until Week 7 of the 2016 season against the Arizona Cardinals, the Seahawks had never recorded a tied game in their history.[154] Running backs (RB) Wide receivers (WR) Tight ends (TE) Defensive linemen (DL) Defensive backs (DB) Special teams Reserve 53 active, 7 reserve, 15 practice squad (+3 exempt) The 35th Anniversary team was voted upon by users on Seahawks.com and announced in 2010.[155] Bold indicates those elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. The Seahawks have retired five numbers in franchise history.[156] Note: Although Mike McCormack served as head coach, president, and general manager for the Seahawks, he is only listed in the Pro Football Hall of Fame for his contributions as a tackle for the New York Yanks and the Cleveland Browns. → Coaching staff → Front office → More NFL staffs The Seahawks have had nine head coaches in franchise history.[165] The 12s (formerly the 12th man) refers to the fan support of the Seahawks.[166] The team's first home stadium, the Kingdome, was one of the loudest and most disruptive environments in the NFL.[167] Opponents were known to practice with rock music blaring at full blast to prepare for the often painfully high decibel levels generated at games in the Kingdome. In 2002, the Seahawks began playing at what is now Lumen Field. Every regular season and playoff game at Lumen Field since the second week of the 2003 season has been played before a sellout crowd. Like the Kingdome before it, Lumen Field is one of the loudest stadiums in the league. The stadium's partial roof and seating decks trap and amplify the noise and reflect it back down to the field. This noise has caused problems for opposing teams, causing them to commit numerous false-start penalties. From 2002 through 2012, there have been 143 false-start penalties on visiting teams in Seattle, second only to the Minnesota Vikings.[168] The Seahawks' fans have twice set the Guinness World Record for the loudest crowd noise at a sporting event, first on September 15, 2013, registering 136.6 dB during a game against the San Francisco 49ers[19] and again on December 2, 2013, during a Monday Night Football game against the New Orleans Saints, with a roar of 137.6 dB.[20][21] As of September 29, 2014, the record of 142.2 dB is held in Arrowhead Stadium by fans of the Kansas City Chiefs.[169] Prior to kickoff of each home game, the Seahawks salute their fans by raising a giant #12 flag at the south end of the stadium.[170] Current and former players, coaches, local celebrities, prominent fans including Patti Hammond, Seattle-area athletes, and former owner Paul Allen have raised the flag. Earlier, the Seahawks retired the #12 jersey on December 15, 1984, as a tribute to their fans.[157] Before their Super Bowl win, the Seahawks ran onto the field under a giant 12th Man flag. In September 1990, Texas A&M University filed, and was later granted, a trademark application for the \"12th Man\" term, based on their continual usage of the term since the 1920s. In January 2006, Texas A&M filed suit against the Seattle Seahawks to protect the trademark and in May 2006, the dispute was settled out of court. In the agreement, which expired in 2016, Texas A&M licensed the Seahawks to continue using the phrase, in exchange for a licensing fee, public acknowledgement of A&M's trademark when using the term, a restriction in usage of the term to seven states in the Northwest United States, and a prohibition from selling any \"12th Man\" merchandise.[171][172][173] Once the agreement expired, the Seahawks were allowed to continue using the number \"12\" but were no longer permitted to use the \"12th Man\" phrase.[174] In August 2015, the Seahawks decided to drop their signage of the \"12th Man\" term and shifted towards referring to their fans as the \"12s\" instead.[175] Starting in the 1998 season, Blitz has been the Seahawks' official mascot.[176] Prior to the 2014 NFL season, Blitz was given a new look and a sidekick; a secondary mascot named Boom was introduced to appeal to and interact with younger children.[177][178] In the 2003 and 2004 seasons, a hawk named Faith would fly around the stadium just before the team came out of the tunnel. However, because of her relatively small size and an inability to be trained to lead the team out of the tunnel, Faith was replaced by an augur hawk named Taima before the start of the 2005 NFL season. Taima started leading the team out of the tunnel in September 2006.[179][180] A group of female and male cheerleaders known as the Seahawks Dancers rallies the crowd from the sidelines and performs a halftime routine during home games at Lumen Field. The group was an all-female squad called the Sea Gals prior to admitting male members and re-branding ahead of the 2019 NFL season.[181][182] During the off-season, a select performing group from the Dancers travels to parades and other events, as well as with other NFL Cheerleaders on the road. Beginning in 2004, the Seahawks introduced their drum line, the Blue Thunder.[183] The group plays at every home game as well as over 100 events in the Seattle community.

The current announcers are former Seahawks players Steve Raible (who was the team's color commentator from 1982 to 2003) and Dave Wyman.[187] The Raible-Wyman regular season pairing has been together since the final four games of 2017 but became full time starting in 2018. On local television broadcast preseason games are split between former Seahawks Paul Moyer, Sam Adkins, and Brock Huard. Pete Gross, who called the games from 1976 until just days before his death from cancer in 1992, is a member of the team's Ring of Honor. Other past announcers include Steve Thomas from 1992 to 1997, Lee Hamilton (also known as \"Hacksaw\") from 1998 to 1999, Brian Davis from 2000 to 2003, and former Seahawk Warren Moon from 2004 to 2017. Preseason games not shown on national networks were produced in-house by Seahawks Broadcasting and televised by KING-TV, channel 5 (and, in 2008, also on sister station KONG-TV since KING, an NBC affiliate, was committed to the Summer Olympics in China). Kate Scott became the announcer for Seahawks TV preseason games in 2023, replacing Curt Menefee (the host of Fox NFL Sunday) who had been the Seahawks TV voice since the 2009 preseason. KCPQ-TV, which airs most of the Seahawks' regular-season games (as the Seattle-Tacoma area's Fox affiliate), became the television partner for the team in 2012 and replaced KING-TV as broadcaster for preseason games, but KING-TV regained the partnership in 2022; simulcasts of any Seahawks games on ESPN's Monday Night Football air (as of the 2018 season) on CBS affiliate KIRO-TV.[188][189] In addition, any Saturday or Sunday afternoon games broadcast by CBS (usually—but not always—with the Seahawks hosting an AFC opponent) will air on KIRO-TV.

                "content": "Jimmy Butler III (born September 14, 1989) is an American professional basketball player for the Miami Heat of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Nicknamed \"Jimmy Buckets\", he is a six-time NBA All-Star, a five-time All-NBA Team member, and a five-time NBA All-Defensive Team member. He won a gold medal as a member of the 2016 U.S. Olympic team. Butler played one year of college basketball for Tyler Junior College before transferring to Marquette University. He was selected with the 30th overall pick in the 2011 NBA draft by the Chicago Bulls. In 2015, he was named the NBA Most Improved Player. After six seasons in Chicago, he was traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves in June 2017, and was then again traded in November 2018, this time to the Philadelphia 76ers. In July 2019, he signed with the Heat. During his first season with the team, Butler reached the NBA Finals. In 2021, he led the league in steals. In 2023, Butler and the eighth-seeded Heat played in the 2023 NBA Finals, their second appearance in four years.[1][2] Butler was born in Houston on September 14, 1989.[3][4] His father, Jimmy Butler Jr., left the family when Butler was an infant. When he was 13 years old and living in the Houston suburb of Tomball, his mother kicked him out of the house. As Butler remembered it in a 2011 interview, she told him, \"I don't like the look of you. You gotta go.\" He moved between the homes of various friends, staying for a few weeks at a time before moving to another house.[5] Butler maintains a relationship with his parents, saying, \"I don't hold grudges. I still talk to my family. My mom. My father. We love each other. That's never going to change.\"[6][7] In a summer basketball league before his senior year at Tomball High School, he was noticed by Jordan Leslie, a freshman football and basketball player at the school, who challenged him to a three-point shooting contest. The two became friends, and Butler stayed at Leslie's house for a few months, Leslie's mother and stepfather had six other children between them. Butler would later say, \"They accepted me into their family. And it wasn't because of basketball. She [Michelle Lambert, Leslie's mother] was just very loving. She just did stuff like that. I couldn't believe it.\"[5] As a junior at Tomball High, Butler averaged 10 points per game. As a senior and team captain in 2006–07, Butler averaged 19.9 points and 8.7 rebounds per game and was subsequently voted his team's most valuable player. Butler was not recruited coming out of high school and chose to attend Tyler Junior College in Tyler, Texas. After his freshman season at Tyler Junior College, where he had averaged 18.1 points, 7.7 rebounds, and 3.1 assists per game, Butler received interest from Division I programs. Considered a two-star recruit by 247Sports.com,[8] he was listed as the No. 127 junior college prospect in 2008.[9] Butler accepted an athletic scholarship to attend Marquette, where, as a sophomore in the 2008–09 season, he averaged 5.6 points and 3.9 rebounds per game and recorded a free-throw percentage of 76.8%.

Butler ended with 11 rebounds as the Bulls overcame a seven-point deficit in the final three minutes.[44] On January 2, 2017, Butler scored 52 points in a 118–111 win over the Charlotte Hornets. He was a point shy of his career high and scored 20 points in the first half and 17 in the game's final four minutes.

He finished with three points on 1-for-13 shooting.[49] On February 25, 2017, he recorded his third career triple-double with 18 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists in a 117–99 win over the Cleveland

usual starters.[69] When a trade was not achieved prior to the start of the regular season, Butler opted to play for Minnesota in 2018–19.[68] He appeared in 10 of the Timberwolves' first 13 games

He cites Paris Saint Germain as his favorite team and Neymar as his favorite player.[152] [153] Butler and his girlfriend have two children.[154] He did not make his Heat debut until the fourth game of the 2019–20 NBA season, as he was on paternity leave after the birth of his first child.[155] In the NBA Bubble, Butler opened Big Face Coffee, a side business which he operated out of his hotel room using his French press coffee brewer, charging $20 per cup.[156] A year later, he officially launched his coffee brand, and planned to dedicate his time into the coffee roastery business post-retirement.[157] During the 2023 NBA playoffs, Butler filed a trademark on the name \"Himmy Butler\" for the purpose of launching his own clothing and beverage brand. The nickname \"Himmy\" came from the meme phrase \"he's him\", which rose in popularity during the Heat's Butler-led run during that postseason.[158][159] Butler is a Christian.[160] Butler is featured in the Netflix documentary series, \"Starting 5\", which followed Butler, Anthony Edwards, LeBron James, Domantas Sabonis, and Jayson Tatum through the 2023–24 NBA season and playoffs.[161] Butler's father died on February 8, 2024.[162]",

                "content": "Editorial Intern Ravens fans got a Christmas gift as the Ravens demolished the Houston Texans, 31-2, Wednesday night in Houston. Lamar Jackson and Derrick Henry dominated as Baltimore played its most complete game of the season. With the win and Steelers' loss to the Chiefs earlier in the day, the Ravens now control their own destiny in the AFC North race. All Baltimore needs is a victory in Week 18 over the Browns or a Steelers loss to the Bengals. Here's how the Ravens came away with the Christmas victory: Moments after a Texans safety injected life into the Houston crowd, the Texans were threatening again deep inside Baltimore territory. The Ravens defense held strong, however, and on fourth-and-goal as Ar'Darius Washington walloped Texans running back Joe Mixon near the pylon for a turnover on downs. Then the Ravens went 99 yards on six plays, highlighted by a 67-yard catch and run from Mark Andrews and an unreal touchdown pass from Jackson to Isaiah Likely. The sequence gave the Ravens a 17-2 lead heading into halftime. Right after Beyoncé performed, the show continued for the Ravens. Leading by 15, Kyle Hamilton opened the second half with his first interception of the season, and Jackson took it from there. On Baltimore's second play of the drive, Jackson faked a handoff to Derrick Henry and broke free for a 48-yard touchdown thanks to strong blocks from Andrews and Likely. Offensive Stats Defensive Stats Team Stats S Kyle Hamilton Hamilton might petition to play every Christmas. After hauling in two interceptions on Dec. 25 last season, Hamilton got his first interception of the season against the Texans. Hamilton continues to elevate the defense since his switch to more of a traditional deep safety role. RB Derrick Henry The Ravens rode Henry to start the game, and the Texans couldn't stop him. Henry had 10 carries for 86 rushing yards and a touchdown in the first quarter as Baltimore got out to a quick 10-0 lead. Henry finished the game with 27 rushes for 147 yards and a score. QB Lamar Jackson Jackson continues to make a case for his third MVP. He finished Wednesday's game with 168 passing yards 87 rushing yards, scoring three total touchdowns as he passed Michael Vick for the most career rushing yards for a quarterback in NFL history. He made a couple ridiculous plays, like his touchdown pass to Likely, where he held the ball for more than eight seconds, and his 48-yard run. Ravens Defense The Baltimore defense had its best game of the season, pitching a shutout on the road. The Texans had just 10 first downs and 211 total yards in the loss while five different Ravens had sacks. Since Week 11, the Ravens defense has turned into a strength after having a difficult start to the season. The Ravens return to M&T Bank Stadium for their regular-season finale against the Cleveland Browns (3-12) on either Jan. 4 (Sat.) or Jan. 5 (Sun.). The Ravens fell to the Browns in Week 8, but since then quarterback Jameis Winston has been benched for Dorian Thompson-Robinson. A Ravens win clinches back-to-back AFC North titles. Zach Orr couldn't contain his excitement after Baltimore's goal line stand. Here's what the Texans said after falling to the Ravens, 31-2. The Ravens have a one-game lead over the Steelers in AFC North heading into the final week. Pundits believe Lamar Jackson may have flipped some MVP voters with performance vs. Houston. Defense continues its stellar improvement. Baltimore's defense came up with a fourth-down goal-line stop, an interception, and five sacks against the Texans. Ravens QB Lamar Jackson is now the most accomplished rushing quarterback in NFL history. Mark Andrews scored a touchdown in his fifth consecutive game, sparking a donation from McAfee. The Ravens are one win away from clinching the AFC North. Lamar Jackson is putting a different spin on spectacular. Baltimore's defense is peaking when it matters most. Lamar Jackson had a wholesome exchange with a young Ravens fan in Houston, and seemingly handed a chain to Eric DeCosta. The Ravens game against the Texans on Christmas will be aired on Netflix.

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. The Baltimore Ravens have taken over first place in the AFC North, and Lamar Jackson made his statement for his third MVP award in a Christmas Day blowout of the Houston Texans. Jackson threw for 168 yards and two touchdowns while rushing for 87 yards -- and passing Michael Vick for the most rushing yards by a quarterback in NFL history -- in the blowout victory. Jackson passed Vick on a 6-yard run with 7:16 remaining in the third quarter to give him 6,110 rushing yards in his career, passing Vick's mark of 6,109. He had 87 of his yards on just four carries and amassed 73 yards on his first two carries -- including a 48-yard touchdown run in the third quarter that put him within striking distance of Vick. Derrick Henry rushed for 147 yards as the Ravens finished with 251 rushing yards in the win. The Ravens defense also didn't allow a point, as the Texans' points came off a safety in the second quarter. C.J. Stroud finished 17 of 31 for 185 yards and an interception. Baltimore needs a win in Week 18 to wrap up the AFC North and the No. 3 seed in the playoffs. Houston appears locked into the No. 4 seed in the AFC with the loss, needing a lot to happen to improve its playoff standing. Takeaways and a recap of this Christmas Day blowout can be found in the live blog below. The Ravens were just better than the Texans in every facet of this game, but the biggest discrepancy ended up being the rushing totals. Baltimore set the tone on the first possession by rushing for 51 yards on an eight-play, 75-yard touchdown drive to kick off the game -- and never relented. Baltimore had 115 rushing yards to Houston's eight after the first quarter, and the Ravens finished with 228 rushing yards to the Texans' 45. Henry had 143 rushing yards and Jackson had 87 on four carries. Just the Ravens doing what they do very well. The Texans are just not on the same level as the Ravens, and were underwhelming in a lot of areas. The defense allowed the Ravens to average 7.7 yards per play and 6.5 yards per carry when the starters were in. The Ravens also scored touchdowns on four of their nine possessions when the starters were in. Stroud and the offense were shut out as well, with the only points coming via the defense (a safety). The Texans quarterback was inaccurate early in the game, which led to them getting into a hole. Houston was also 3 of 13 on third down and 0 of 2 on fourth down when the starters were in. Just a poor showing by the Texans. The Texans were facing a fourth-and-goal at the 4-yard line late in the second quarter, but failed to convert a touchdown and get back in the game. Stroud threw a pass underneath to Joe Mixon that only got three yards. The Texans turned the ball over on down, and that was the closest they got to scoring anything on offense. The Ravens responded with a six-play drive that went 99 yards, capped with a Jackson 9-yard touchdown pass to Isaiah Likely that was an MVP-type throw. Baltimore took a 17-2 lead, and the game felt out of reach at that point. The Texans needed a touchdown on that fourth-and-goal. There were plenty of plays from Jackson that could qualify for this list, but let's go with the Likely touchdown that put Baltimore up 17-2. Jackson took a read-option and rolled to his right, pump faked twice and saw nothing open, so he bought himself more time along the sideline. Jackson had Texans pass rusher Danielle Hunter on skates as he moved backwards and faked him out several times before pointing to Likely in the end zone. He fired to Likely in the middle of the field for the 9-yard touchdown that showcased why Jackson will likely win MVP. This was on the same day Jackson broke the rushing yardage record for quarterbacks. Just another amazing play for Jackson in a career full of them. The Ravens (11-5) close their regular season against the Browns, while the Texans (9-7) end their season against the Jaguars. Both teams are going to the playoffs. The Ravens are going to take over first in the AFC North. They'll clinch the division with a win or Steelers loss next week. Ravens 31, Texans 2 Jackson has 166 passing yards and 2 TD. He has 87 rushing yards on four carrie. The Ravens have 216 rushing yards. Give Lamar the MVP at this rate. Jackson has passed Michael Vick for the most rushing yards by a quarterback in NFL history. Jackson passed Vick on a 6-yard run with 7:16 remaining in the third quarter to give him 6,110 rushing yards in his career, passing Vick's mark of 6,109. C.J. Stroud throws an interception to Kyle Hamilton on the Texans first drive of the second half. On the first play of Baltimore's ensuing possession, Lamar Jackson runs for 48 yards and a score. Jackson is 13 yards away from passing Michael Vick for the most rushing yards ever by a QB. The Ravens are cruising. Enjoy your Christmas dinner. Ravens 24, Texans 2 Looks like Stroud has a leg injury. He'll get it looked at on the sidelines, but missed just one play. Great sign for the Texans. Ravens halted at midfield and Texans will punt. Houston gets ball to start the second half. Hard to see them try to score with 21 seconds left in the half. Texans go 3-and-out. Baltimore has just over a minute to get more points. All three timeouts left. Let's see what Lamar can do. At a loss of words for this Lamar Jackson TD pass to Isaiah Likely. Just an incredible QB. Watch and enjoy. Ravens 17, Texans 2 The reigning MVP doing MVP things. Lamar went to his left, eluded a sack, and threw past the right hashmark to Andrews for 67-yard reception. Andrews almost broke it and scored, but Ravens are inside the 10 at the 2:00 warning. Jackson is 4-of-6 for 110 yards. The Texans decide to go for it on 4th-and-goal at the 3, but Stroud's pass to Joe Mixon only gets one yard. Turnover on downs. Ar'Darius Washington with the stop as the Texans get nothing. Ravens still up 10-2 late in the 2nd Stroud's pass is high to Robert Woods on 4th-and-3 at the BAL 30, but certainly didn't think that warranted a PI call. That may have been a missed call by the officials. That looked like Humphrey was playing the football. Texans get a break. Derrick Henry was tackled in the end zone by Kamari Lassiter for a four-yard loss and a safety. Henry has lost 8 yards in his last 2 carries, but the Texans are on the board. The Texans get the ball back. The 70-yard punt by Tommy Townsend set that up. Ravens 10, Texans 2 Odofe Oweh sacks Stroud for a 13-yard loss. The sack was really bad since it was 3rd-and-2 from the Texans 45. This was easily 4-down territory prior to the sack. Just not a good start for Stroud. Houston held Derrick Henry to -4 yards, then Keaton Mitchell to -6 yards. Lamar Jackson had nothing on 3rd-and-20. The Ravens punt for the first time, but are still up 10-0. Down to 105 rushing yards now. Henry has 10 carries for 86 yards after the first quarter. The Ravens are ahead in rushing yards 115-8. They are up 10-0. Three straight misses for Stroud to end the drive. Stroud missed Dalton Schultz for an easy first down on 3rd-and-10, which would have been a huge gain. Texans put again down 10-0 to Ravens. Stroud is 3-of-6 for 30 yards to start. The Ravens had another impressive drive, but the biggest development was 52-yard Justin Tucker FG. Very encouraging sign for the Ravens, although we need to see Tucker hit that outdoors. Now 6-for-11 on kicks from 50+ this year. Ravens 10, Texans 0 -- Baltimore with 83 rushing yards Baltimore gets a sack on 3rd down. C.J. Stroud taken down by Kyle Van Noy on 3rd down and Houston will punt. The Ravens defense has come alive over the past month, allowing just 187.3 yards per game -- 1st in NFL. Derrick Henry scored on a 2-yard touchdown run on an easy 8-play, 75-yard TD drive for the Ravens. 51 rushing yards for the Ravens on the drive as Lamar Jackson had a 27-yard pass to Zay Flowers and a 25-yard run. Texans had 10-men on the field on the Henry TD. Ravens 7, Texans 0 The Texans are the 1st team ever to win back-to-back division titles with a QB-HC duo each in their 1st 2 NFL seasons -- C.J. Stroud and DeMeco Ryans. Ravens -- First place in AFC North (right now in first with Steelers loss) Texans -- No. 3 seed (would have conference-record tiebreaker over Steelers) A look at the Christmas Day jerseys: Santa Claus is coming to Houston. The Ravens enter the field in front of the Texans crowd. WR Nelson Agholor is among those out on Christmas Day The Texans are without C Juice Scruggs (foot) and G Nick Broeker against the Ravens defense. Good afternoon everyone and Merry Christmas! We got you covered for Ravens and Texans in Houston today. Perhaps maybe there will be some Beyonce halftime updates as well. Excited to watch Lamar Jackson again, and see how C.J. Stroud faces in his first matchup with the Ravens since the AFC Divisional Playoff loss last year. Should be a fun one! © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

MVP candidate Lamar Jackson was sensational, completing 10 of 15 passes for 168 yards and two touchdowns. He also ran for 87 yards and another score. Jackson was aided by a dominant rushing attack. Derrick Henry carried the ball 27 times for 147 yards and a touchdown. The Ravens as a team ran 43 times for 251 yards. C.J. Stroud struggled for the Texans. He completed 17 of 31 passes for only 185 yards with no touchdowns and one interception. Stroud was also sacked five times. Baltimore began the game with an eight-play, 75-yard drive for a touchdown. After a Houston punt, the Ravens took a 10-0 lead with a field goal on their next drive. The Texans’ only score in the first half came on a safety in the second quarter. But they turned the ball over on downs on their next possession, and Baltimore answered with a 99-yard scoring drive to take a 17-2 lead the team into halftime. Beyoncé performs ‘Cowboy Carter’ hits during Christmas NFL halftime show on Netflix In the third quarter, Stroud was intercepted on Houston’s first drive, leading to a Ravens touchdown. After a Texans three-and-out, Baltimore added another touchdown on a 10-play drive to go up 31-2. With the Pittsburgh Steelers losing earlier, the Ravens moved into first place in the AFC North and third place in the conference overall. Their final game of the season is against the Cleveland Browns. Houston fell to 9-7 with the loss, but the team has already clinched the AFC South. The Texans finish their regular season with a game against the Tennessee Titans. NBC News Rohan Nadkarni That’s all for the NFL on Christmas! The Ravens dominated the Texans in the late, shutting down their offense while Lamar Jackson made MVP-caliber play after MVP-caliber play. Baltimore is now in first place in the AFC North after today’s win. Rohan Nadkarni The Ravens are punting again, but more importantly for them they took over seven minutes off the clock with their 31-2 lead. The Texans’ offense us back on the field with 3:23 to go and Davis Mills is in for C.J. Stroud. Rohan Nadkarni Lamar Jackson has been taken out of the game with the Ravens leading 31-2. He’s already signing autographs for fans to give you an idea of how over this game is. Rohan Nadkarni ...And the Texans can’t do anything after the Ravens punt, going three-and-out and punting the ball right back. The Ravens will take over with 10:24 left in the fourth and presumably trying to run out the clock. Rohan Nadkarni The Ravens punted after eight plays. Don’t think they’re sweating it very hard with their 31-2 lead, though. Rohan Nadkarni The Ravens have dominated this game from the jump and they’ll take a big lead into the fourth quarter. Baltimore has been impressive on both sides of the ball, and Lamar Jackson has made play after play. The Ravens will have a 1st-and-10 on their own 23 when the fourth begins. Rohan Nadkarni After a sack on third down, C.J. Stroud threw too short of the sticks on 4th-and-7, only picking up six yards. It needed a replay to be overturned to the right call, but the Texans turned the ball over on downs. Their offense has been pitiful today. Stroud is under 200 yards on 29 attempts and he’s been sacked five times. The Ravens take over with a 31-2 lead with 2:15 left in the third quarter. Rohan Nadkarni With his four carries for 87 yards today, Lamar Jackson became the NFL’s all-time leading rusher for a quarterback, overtaking Michael Vick. Jackson is currently ahead of Vick by one yard, with 6,110 career rushing yards. Only 27, Jackson is in his seventh year with the Ravens. Rohan Nadkarni Lamar Jackson is making an MVP statement today. After a rushing touchdown on the Ravens’ last drive, Jackson found Mark Andrews from one yard out for his second touchdown pass of the game. Jackson is now up to 163 yards passing in addition 87 yards rushing and three total touchdowns. Baltimore is dominating and now leading 31-2. Saba Hamedy If you want to rewatch Beyoncé's Christmas halftime show, do it now. A replay will only be available for a few hours, Variety previously reported. In the U.S., both Christmas games will expire on Netflix three hours after the livestreams end, as per terms of the agreement between Netflix and the NFL. Meanwhile, outside the U.S., viewers have 24 hours after the livestream ends to catch the games (or performances). Rohan Nadkarni After C.J. Stroud was sacked on second down, he was pressured on 3rd-and-16 and forced to throw well short of the sticks. The Texans punted for the fifth time as their offense continues to struggle. The Ravens take over on their own 33 leading 24-2. Rohan Nadkarni Wow! Two plays after Kyle Hamilton’s interception, the Ravens are in the end zone. Lamar Jackson took a designed run 49 yards to the house for a score. Jackson now has 73 yards rushing on only two carries. Baltimore leads 24-2. Rohan Nadkarni The Texans’ first drive of the second half ends in disaster. On 3rd-and-3, C.J. Stroud threw into double coverage and was intercepted by Kyle Hamilton. The Ravens will now take over on the Houston 39 with a 17-2 lead. Rohan Nadkarni I’m not sure how the Ravens and Texans will follow up that Beyoncé performance, but they have no choice with the third quarter underway. C.J. Stroud and Houston are on the field first trailing 17-2. Doha Madani Beyoncé opened the show by entering NRG Stadium on horseback singing \"16 Carriages,\" dressed in all white with a \"Cowboy Carter\" sash. She dismounted in the tunnels of the stadium as she transitioned into her cover of The Beatles' \"Blackbird,\" which was also featured on the album. On the field, she changed outfits and upped the tempo with \"Ya-Ya.\" The stage set up was surrounded by performers in all white cowboy hats, chaps, boots and \"Cowboy Carter\" sashes. Shaboozey and Post Malone made appearances to sing their collaborations with her from the album, \"Sweet Honey Buckin\" and \"Levii's Jeans.\" Beyoncé ended the show dancing side-by-side with 12-year-old daughter Blue Ivy as she performed her hit single \"Texas Hold 'Em.\" Saba Hamedy Beyoncé was joined by several familiar faces during the show, including Tiera Kennedy, Tanner Adell, Brittney Spencer and Reyna Roberts. Doha Madani This is Texas and Beyoncé Knowles Carter effortlessly holds our attention. Beyoncé takes the stage at NRG Stadium, gracing her hometown of Houston with the first performances from her \"Coach Carter\" country album. Rohan Nadkarni The Ravens dominated the first half, taking a 17-2 lead into the break. After Baltimore ran all over the Texans in the first quarter, Lamar Jackson made some big plays in the second. Houston’s only score came via safety as C.J. Stroud has struggled. And now it’s time for Beyoncé! Rohan Nadkarni The Ravens couldn’t get over midfield on their final drive before halftime, as Lamar Jackson threw incomplete on 3rd-and-10 from his own 48. Baltimore punted, and the Texans have 21 seconds and three timeouts to maybe try something crazy. Rohan Nadkarni After two straight incomplete throws from C.J. Stroud with only two yards needed for a first down, the Texans punted on 4th-and-2 from the Baltimore 43. Not a sharp game from Stroud so far. The Ravens are up 17-2 with a chance to add to their lead before halftime. Rohan Nadkarni Beautiful drive by the Ravens, who needed only six plays to go 99 yards for their second touchdown of the game. Lamar Jackson made all kinds of plays, including a nice scramble-turned-pass to Mark Andrews for a 67-yard gain. Then Jackson extended a play for several seconds inside the 10 to find Isaiah Likely for a score. Baltimore now leads 17-2. Rohan Nadkarni The Texans went for it on 4th-and-3 and picked up a first down via a pass interference penalty on Marlon Humphrey. That was...a tough call. There was minimal contact by Humphrey, and even Netflix rules analyst Gene Steratore (a former ref) disagreed with the flag. The conversion set up Houston inside the Baltimore 5-yard line. Rohan Nadkarni Wow! The Ravens escape harm after the Texans converted a 4th-and-3 via penalty to get to the 10-yard line. After two runs and an incomplete pass, C.J. Stroud threw to Joe Mixon on 4th-and-goal, but Mixon was tackled one yard short of the end zone. That’s a massive stop by Baltimore, which was on defense after the offense gave up a safety. The Ravens will now take over on their own 1 hoping to avoid another one. Rohan Nadkarni Whoa! The Texans’ first points on Christmas come via their defense, as Derrick Henry was tackled in the end zone for a safety. After running for 86 yards on his first 10 carries, Henry has lost eight yards on his last two. Houston will now get possession of the ball trailing 10-2. Rohan Nadkarni On 3rd-and-2, C.J Stroud couldn’t run away from Odafe Oweh and was sacked for a 13-yard loss, leading to the Texans’ third straight punt. Stroud has now been sacked twice in the first half. The Ravens take over inside their own 5-yard line after the punt. Rohan Nadkarni After dominating on the ground in the first quarter, the Ravens’ first two runs of the second quarter both went backward. That set up a 3rd-and-20, and Lamar Jackson threw incomplete, setting up a Baltimore punt. The Texans take over on their own 18 trailing 10-0. Rohan Nadkarni The Ravens lead 10-0 after one quarter, and they’ve been especially dominant on the ground. Derrick Henry has already carried the ball 10 times for 86 yards, as well as the game’s only touchdown. Overall, Baltimore rushed 13 times for 115 yards in the first quarter. It will be a long day for the Texans if they can’t slow down the run. Rohan Nadkarni The Texans picked up a first down on the first play of their second drive, but C.J. Stroud threw incomplete on the next three plays, leading to a punt. Stroud missed a wide-open Dalton Schultz on third down on what could have potentially been a big gain. The Ravens take over their own 23 with a 10-0 lead after a penalty on the punt. Rohan Nadkarni After a nice run stuff by the Texans on second down, Lamar Jackson threw incomplete to Zay Flowers on 3rd-and-9, leading to a Justin Tucker field-goal attempt. Tucker was good from 52 yards out, giving the Ravens a 10-0 lead with 2:47 left in the first quarter. Rohan Nadkarni On 3rd-and-4 from the Baltimore 48, C.J. Stroud was sacked by Kyle Van Noy, ending the Texans’ first drive after only six plays. The Ravens take over on their own 30 leading 7-0. Rohan Nadkarni What an opening drive by the Ravens. Baltimore went 75 yards in eight plays, picking up 51 of those yards on the ground. Derrick Henry capped the drive with a two-yard touchdown run. The Ravens lead 7-0. Saba Hamedy It's been smooth sailing for Netflix so far. The streaming giant has experienced little to no issues during today's broadcast of both games. Wonder if that'll change with Beyonce's expected halftime performance, coming up in a few hours. Rohan Nadkarni The Ravens received the opening kickoff and their first play from scrimmage was a Derrick Henry run for six yards. Saba Hamedy Netflix loves Mariah Carey so much they played her pre-recorded \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" performance again before game 2. The segment played after a cappella group Pentatonix performed the National Anthem. Greg Rosenstein With Pittsburgh losing to the Kansas City Chiefs earlier today, Baltimore could take over first place in the AFC North with a win against Houston. A win today and a win against Cleveland next week will wrap up the division. Greg Rosenstein Greg Rosenstein The Texans lost 27-19 at the Chiefs in Week 16. They are only 4-5 in the last nine games after starting the season 5-1. Maybe the addition of a new wide receiver will help? After losing Tank Dell to a knee injury, the Texans claimed Diontae Johnson off waivers after Baltimore released him. Greg Rosenstein Baltimore has two straight wins since returning from Week 14 Bye and losing to the Eagles in Week 13. The Ravens clinched a playoff berth with win over Steelers in Week 16. They are outscoring opponents 69-31 during the two-game wining streak (34+ points scored in each win). Baltimore is looking to win three straight games for the first time since winning five straight from Weeks 3-7. Greg Rosenstein This is a rematch of last season’s Divisional Round matchup, won by Baltimore 34-10. Baltimore is 12-2 all-time vs Houston (including playoffs) … but both losses came in Houston.

After the Chiefs blew out the Steelers in the early game, the Ravens embarrassed the Texans in the second. Baltimore dominated Houston 31-2 behind another MVP-caliber performance from Lamar Jackson. Houston recorded a safety with 10 minutes left in the second quarter, getting within eight points of Baltimore, but the Texans were held off the scoreboard for the rest of the game. The Ravens run game was on full display. Derrick Henry wasn't thrown off his game by being tackled in the end zone for the early safety, ending with 147 yards and a touchdown on 27 carries.

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. The Baltimore Ravens have taken over first place in the AFC North, and Lamar Jackson made his statement for his third MVP award in a Christmas Day blowout of the Houston Texans. Jackson threw for 168 yards and two touchdowns while rushing for 87 yards -- and passing Michael Vick for the most rushing yards by a quarterback in NFL history -- in the blowout victory. Jackson passed Vick on a 6-yard run with 7:16 remaining in the third quarter to give him 6,110 rushing yards in his career, passing Vick's mark of 6,109. He had 87 of his yards on just four carries and amassed 73 yards on his first two carries -- including a 48-yard touchdown run in the third quarter that put him within striking distance of Vick. Derrick Henry rushed for 147 yards as the Ravens finished with 251 rushing yards in the win. The Ravens defense also didn't allow a point, as the Texans' points came off a safety in the second quarter. C.J. Stroud finished 17 of 31 for 185 yards and an interception. Baltimore needs a win in Week 18 to wrap up the AFC North and the No. 3 seed in the playoffs. Houston appears locked into the No. 4 seed in the AFC with the loss, needing a lot to happen to improve its playoff standing. Takeaways and a recap of this Christmas Day blowout can be found in the live blog below. The Ravens were just better than the Texans in every facet of this game, but the biggest discrepancy ended up being the rushing totals. Baltimore set the tone on the first possession by rushing for 51 yards on an eight-play, 75-yard touchdown drive to kick off the game -- and never relented. Baltimore had 115 rushing yards to Houston's eight after the first quarter, and the Ravens finished with 228 rushing yards to the Texans' 45. Henry had 143 rushing yards and Jackson had 87 on four carries. Just the Ravens doing what they do very well. The Texans are just not on the same level as the Ravens, and were underwhelming in a lot of areas. The defense allowed the Ravens to average 7.7 yards per play and 6.5 yards per carry when the starters were in. The Ravens also scored touchdowns on four of their nine possessions when the starters were in. Stroud and the offense were shut out as well, with the only points coming via the defense (a safety). The Texans quarterback was inaccurate early in the game, which led to them getting into a hole. Houston was also 3 of 13 on third down and 0 of 2 on fourth down when the starters were in. Just a poor showing by the Texans. The Texans were facing a fourth-and-goal at the 4-yard line late in the second quarter, but failed to convert a touchdown and get back in the game. Stroud threw a pass underneath to Joe Mixon that only got three yards. The Texans turned the ball over on down, and that was the closest they got to scoring anything on offense. The Ravens responded with a six-play drive that went 99 yards, capped with a Jackson 9-yard touchdown pass to Isaiah Likely that was an MVP-type throw. Baltimore took a 17-2 lead, and the game felt out of reach at that point. The Texans needed a touchdown on that fourth-and-goal. There were plenty of plays from Jackson that could qualify for this list, but let's go with the Likely touchdown that put Baltimore up 17-2. Jackson took a read-option and rolled to his right, pump faked twice and saw nothing open, so he bought himself more time along the sideline. Jackson had Texans pass rusher Danielle Hunter on skates as he moved backwards and faked him out several times before pointing to Likely in the end zone. He fired to Likely in the middle of the field for the 9-yard touchdown that showcased why Jackson will likely win MVP. This was on the same day Jackson broke the rushing yardage record for quarterbacks. Just another amazing play for Jackson in a career full of them. The Ravens (11-5) close their regular season against the Browns, while the Texans (9-7) end their season against the Jaguars. Both teams are going to the playoffs. The Ravens are going to take over first in the AFC North. They'll clinch the division with a win or Steelers loss next week. Ravens 31, Texans 2 Jackson has 166 passing yards and 2 TD. He has 87 rushing yards on four carrie. The Ravens have 216 rushing yards. Give Lamar the MVP at this rate. Jackson has passed Michael Vick for the most rushing yards by a quarterback in NFL history. Jackson passed Vick on a 6-yard run with 7:16 remaining in the third quarter to give him 6,110 rushing yards in his career, passing Vick's mark of 6,109. C.J. Stroud throws an interception to Kyle Hamilton on the Texans first drive of the second half. On the first play of Baltimore's ensuing possession, Lamar Jackson runs for 48 yards and a score. Jackson is 13 yards away from passing Michael Vick for the most rushing yards ever by a QB. The Ravens are cruising. Enjoy your Christmas dinner. Ravens 24, Texans 2 Looks like Stroud has a leg injury. He'll get it looked at on the sidelines, but missed just one play. Great sign for the Texans. Ravens halted at midfield and Texans will punt. Houston gets ball to start the second half. Hard to see them try to score with 21 seconds left in the half. Texans go 3-and-out. Baltimore has just over a minute to get more points. All three timeouts left. Let's see what Lamar can do. At a loss of words for this Lamar Jackson TD pass to Isaiah Likely. Just an incredible QB. Watch and enjoy. Ravens 17, Texans 2 The reigning MVP doing MVP things. Lamar went to his left, eluded a sack, and threw past the right hashmark to Andrews for 67-yard reception. Andrews almost broke it and scored, but Ravens are inside the 10 at the 2:00 warning. Jackson is 4-of-6 for 110 yards. The Texans decide to go for it on 4th-and-goal at the 3, but Stroud's pass to Joe Mixon only gets one yard. Turnover on downs. Ar'Darius Washington with the stop as the Texans get nothing. Ravens still up 10-2 late in the 2nd Stroud's pass is high to Robert Woods on 4th-and-3 at the BAL 30, but certainly didn't think that warranted a PI call. That may have been a missed call by the officials. That looked like Humphrey was playing the football. Texans get a break. Derrick Henry was tackled in the end zone by Kamari Lassiter for a four-yard loss and a safety. Henry has lost 8 yards in his last 2 carries, but the Texans are on the board. The Texans get the ball back. The 70-yard punt by Tommy Townsend set that up. Ravens 10, Texans 2 Odofe Oweh sacks Stroud for a 13-yard loss. The sack was really bad since it was 3rd-and-2 from the Texans 45. This was easily 4-down territory prior to the sack. Just not a good start for Stroud. Houston held Derrick Henry to -4 yards, then Keaton Mitchell to -6 yards. Lamar Jackson had nothing on 3rd-and-20. The Ravens punt for the first time, but are still up 10-0. Down to 105 rushing yards now. Henry has 10 carries for 86 yards after the first quarter. The Ravens are ahead in rushing yards 115-8. They are up 10-0. Three straight misses for Stroud to end the drive. Stroud missed Dalton Schultz for an easy first down on 3rd-and-10, which would have been a huge gain. Texans put again down 10-0 to Ravens. Stroud is 3-of-6 for 30 yards to start. The Ravens had another impressive drive, but the biggest development was 52-yard Justin Tucker FG. Very encouraging sign for the Ravens, although we need to see Tucker hit that outdoors. Now 6-for-11 on kicks from 50+ this year. Ravens 10, Texans 0 -- Baltimore with 83 rushing yards Baltimore gets a sack on 3rd down. C.J. Stroud taken down by Kyle Van Noy on 3rd down and Houston will punt. The Ravens defense has come alive over the past month, allowing just 187.3 yards per game -- 1st in NFL. Derrick Henry scored on a 2-yard touchdown run on an easy 8-play, 75-yard TD drive for the Ravens. 51 rushing yards for the Ravens on the drive as Lamar Jackson had a 27-yard pass to Zay Flowers and a 25-yard run. Texans had 10-men on the field on the Henry TD. Ravens 7, Texans 0 The Texans are the 1st team ever to win back-to-back division titles with a QB-HC duo each in their 1st 2 NFL seasons -- C.J. Stroud and DeMeco Ryans. Ravens -- First place in AFC North (right now in first with Steelers loss) Texans -- No. 3 seed (would have conference-record tiebreaker over Steelers) A look at the Christmas Day jerseys: Santa Claus is coming to Houston. The Ravens enter the field in front of the Texans crowd. WR Nelson Agholor is among those out on Christmas Day The Texans are without C Juice Scruggs (foot) and G Nick Broeker against the Ravens defense. Good afternoon everyone and Merry Christmas! We got you covered for Ravens and Texans in Houston today. Perhaps maybe there will be some Beyonce halftime updates as well. Excited to watch Lamar Jackson again, and see how C.J. Stroud faces in his first matchup with the Ravens since the AFC Divisional Playoff loss last year. Should be a fun one! © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

                "title": "Texan English - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Texan English is the array of American English dialects spoken in Texas, primarily falling under Southern U.S. English. As one nationwide study states, the typical Texan accent is a \"Southern accent with a twist\".[1] The \"twist\" refers to inland Southern U.S., older coastal Southern U.S., and South Midland U.S. accents mixing together, due to Texas's settlement history, as well as some lexical (vocabulary) influences from Mexican Spanish.[1] In fact, there is no single accent that covers all of Texas and few dialect features are unique to Texas alone. The newest and most innovative Southern U.S. accent features are best reported in Lubbock, Odessa, somewhat Houston and variably Dallas, though general features of this same dialect are found throughout the state, with several exceptions:[2] Abilene and somewhat Austin, Corpus Christi, and El Paso appear to align more with Midland U.S. accents than Southern ones. After Mexico gained independence in 1821, Mexican Texas legally permitted an influx of American settlers from the United States (mainly the Southern United States),[3] who within a decade outnumbered Hispanics in Texas,[4] making English as common as Spanish in central and north Texas. After Texas became an independent republic in 1836, English, with its distinct Southern influences, became the predominant language. After the Mexican Revolution of 1910–1920, a great number of Spanish-speaking Mexicans immigrated to Texas,[5][6] slowing down in the mid-20th century only to increase massively since 1990,[4] driving the development of a young Spanish-influenced dialect of Texan English: Tejano English. Some linguists draw dialect boundaries based upon phonological (sound-pattern) differences and others on lexical (word-usage) differences, leading to various views on how to classify dialects in Texas, often by dividing the state into an eastern versus a western dialect region.[7] 20th-century lexical research delimited Texas into two \"layers\": a southern Texas layer along the Mexican border with several Spanish loanwords and a central Texas layer settled by speakers of German and other European languages amidst a dominant Anglo-American settlement.[8][9] 21st-century phonological research reveals accents in Texas grouped in a way not easy to demarcate in terms of simple geographical boundaries,[10] and ongoing research reveals an urban–rural divide within Texas becoming more significant than a region-wide divide. Some linguists propose that urbanization, geographic and social mobility, and the mass media have homogenized the speech of the United States to a national norm.[11] Due to rapid urbanization, increasing dominance of high tech industries, and massive migrations, Texan speech has been reshaped as well, especially since 1990.[4] The general tendency in the phonology of Texas English is that mergers expand at the expense of distinctions, although traditional Southern-style Texan English preserved older phonemic distinctions.[11] Since much of the traditional regional vocabulary concerned farming and rural life, these terms are now disappearing or being replaced by technical terms.[11] As stated above, an internal rural–urban split is emerging within Texan English, meaning that most traditionally Southern (or stereotypically Texan) features remain strong in rural areas but tend to disappear in large urban areas and small cities.[4] The urban-rural linguistic split mainly affects Southern-style phonological phenomena like the pen-pin merger, the loss of the offglide in /aɪ/, and upgliding diphthongs, all of which are now recessive in metropolitan areas.[4] Meanwhile, some traditional grammatical features like y'all and fixin' to are expanding to non-natives in metropolitan areas as well as to the Hispanic population.[4] Essentially all Texas English phonologically falls under the Southeastern super-dialect region of the United States and often specifically the Southern dialect region, though noticeably not the cities of El Paso, Abilene, and Austin, and not particularly Houston and Corpus Christi.[2] Moreover, as of 21st-century research, the accents of Dallas show enormous variability.[10] Texas English may use many grammatical constructions typically associated with Southern U.S. English, including fixin' to,[19] multiple modals like might could and should oughta (reportedly used by every social class and, as of the 1980s Linguistic Atlas of the Gulf States, predominately in Upper and Lower East Texas), and plural verbal -s as in Our father and mother helps used by both Black and (somewhat less commonly) white Texans.[20] Many of these lexical terms are shared with the Midland and Southern dialects generally: Due to Spain's past influence in Texas, the vocabulary of Texas is much more influenced by Spanish than the vocabulary of other states. Some of the Texan terms that originated from Spanish are listed below.[22] Texan English frequently shows up in the media. In the 1950s and 1960s, many Hollywood western movies like Giant, Hud, and The Alamo were set in Texas. In those movies, Hollywood stars like James Dean, Rock Hudson, Dennis Hopper, Paul Newman, and Patricia Neal first had to learn how to speak Texan English and were instructed by native Texans. Also the famous TV series Dallas was often characterized by Texan English. Texas Instruments sometimes uses Texan English in its products. The TIFORM software for its TI-990 minicomputer sometimes displayed \"Shut 'er Down Clancey She's a-Pumping Mud\" as a humorous error message.[28] The Texan accent gained nationwide fame with the presidency of native Texan Lyndon B. Johnson. A lifelong resident of the Texas Hill Country, Johnson's thick accent was a large part of his personality and brought attention and fame to the dialect.[4][29] The Texan dialect gained fame again when George W. Bush started to serve as president. He had moved to West Texas at the age of two and has since retained the Texan dialect. In his speech, words like \"America\" sometimes sound like \"Amur-kah\" or even just like \"Mur-kah\".[4][30] Former U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson also speaks with a distinctively Texan accent.[31][32] Due to hundreds of years of Spanish and later Mexican intermingling, around 6 million (ca. 29%) people in Texas speak Spanish as the first language.[33] Recent data shows that Spanish is still increasing.[34] Since there are so many Spanish speakers in Texas, Spanish has a high impact on the English dialect spoken in Texas.[35] Many Mexican Americans in Texas speak their own variety of English which has many Spanish features (terms, phonology, etc.), Tejano English, a Chicano English dialect mostly spoken by working-class Mexican Americans. A very distinctive feature of that dialect is the /-t,d/-deletion in words which contain a /t/ or /d/ in the final position.[36]",

                "content": "Beyoncé Giselle Knowles-Carter (/biˈɒnseɪ/ ⓘ, bee-ON-say;[6] born September 4, 1981)[7] is an American singer, songwriter, and businesswoman. Regarded as one of the most influential cultural figures in music history,[8] she has transformed the sound of popular music with her vocal ability, live performances and artistic innovations. Her work is considered to be amongst the greatest of all time.[9] As a child, Beyoncé began performing through various singing and dancing competitions. She debuted in the late 1990s and rose to fame as a member of Destiny's Child, one of the best-selling girl groups of all time. Her debut solo album, Dangerously in Love (2003), became one of the best-selling albums of the 21st century and spawned the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles \"Crazy in Love\" and \"Baby Boy\". Beyoncé's commercial success continued with the albums B'Day (2006), I Am... Sasha Fierce (2008) and 4 (2011), all of which featured hit singles including \"Irreplaceable\", \"Check on It\", \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on it)\", \"If I Were a Boy\", \"Halo\", \"Run the World (Girls)\" and \"Love On Top\". She has also ventured into acting, with leading roles in the films Dreamgirls (2006), Cadillac Records (2008) and Obsessed (2009). Beyoncé's career shifted after forming her own management company Parkwood Entertainment, creating monocultural events through acclaimed concept albums.[10] She explored personal and sociopolitical themes on Beyoncé (2013) and Lemonade (2016), which are credited with popularizing the surprise album and visual album. The former inspired setting Friday as the Global Release Day, while the latter became the best-selling album of 2016 worldwide. Her ongoing trilogy project – currently consisting of queer-inspired dance album Renaissance (2022) and Americana epic Cowboy Carter (2024) – has highlighted the contributions of Black pioneers to American musical and cultural history, spawning the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles \"Break My Soul\" and \"Texas Hold 'Em\". Beyoncé is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold 200 million records worldwide, making her the most Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA)-certified female artist in history.[11][12][13] Her accolades include the most Grammy Awards (32), NAACP Image Awards (25), BET Awards (32) and Soul Train Music Awards (25) of any artist. Billboard ranked her as the greatest pop star of the 21st century and Rolling Stone named her among the best singers of all time.[14][15] She was repeatedly named artist of the decade for both the 2000s and 2010s, including recognition as the RIAA's Top Certified Artist of the Decade and Pollstar's Touring Artist of the Decade.[16] She is the only female artist to debut all of her eight solo albums at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200, and she is the only artist to release new Billboard Hot 100 number-one hits in four different decades (including group achievements).[17] She is a ubiquitous figure within popular culture and has influenced various other artists. Beyoncé Giselle Knowles was born on September 4, 1981, at the Park Plaza Hospital[18] in Houston, Texas, to Tina Knowles (née Beyoncé), a hairdresser and salon owner, and Mathew Knowles, a Xerox sales manager.[19] Tina is Louisiana Creole and Mathew is African American.[20][21][22][23] Beyoncé's younger sister, Solange Knowles, is also a singer and a former backup dancer for Destiny's Child. Solange and Beyoncé are the first sisters to have both had number one solo albums.[24] Beyoncé's maternal grandparents, Lumis Albert Beyincé and Agnéz Deréon (daughter of Odilia Broussard and Eugène DeRouen),[25] were French-speaking Louisiana Creoles, with roots in New Iberia;[26][25][27] She is a descendant of Acadian militia officer Joseph Broussard, who was exiled to French Louisiana after the expulsion of the Acadians, and of the French military officer and Abenaki chief Jean-Vincent d'Abbadie, Baron de Saint-Castin.[21][28] She has additional Breton heritage. Beyoncé's fourth great-grandmother, Marie-Françoise Trahan, was born in 1774 in Bangor, located on Belle Île, France. Trahan was a daughter of Acadians who had taken refuge on Belle Île after the Acadian expulsion. The Estates of Brittany had divided the lands of Belle Île to distribute them among 78 other Acadian families and the already settled inhabitants. The Trahan family lived on Belle Île for over ten years before migrating to Louisiana, where she married a Broussard descendant.[29] Beyoncé researched her ancestry and discovered that she is descended from a slave owner who married his slave.[30] Her mother is also of distant Irish and Jewish ancestry.[31][32][33][26] Beyoncé also has Belgian ancestry from Hainaut Province, Wallonia and is related to a former mayor of Froidchapelle, Belgium.[34][35] Beyoncé was raised with multiple religious traditions, attending St. John's United Methodist Church in Houston as well as St. Mary of the Purification Catholic Church.[36][37][38] She went to St. Mary's Catholic Montessori School in Houston and enrolled in dance classes there.[39] Her singing ability was discovered when dance instructor Darlette Johnson began humming a song and Beyoncé finished it, able to hit the high-pitched notes.[40] Beyoncé's interest in music and performing continued after winning a school talent show at age seven, singing John Lennon's \"Imagine\" to beat 15/16-year-olds.[41][42] In the fall of 1990, Beyoncé enrolled in Parker Elementary School, a music magnet school in Houston, where she performed with the school's choir.[43] She also attended the High School for the Performing and Visual Arts[44] and later Alief Elsik High School.[20][45] Beyoncé was also a member of the choir at St. John's United Methodist Church where she sang her first solo and was a soloist for two years.[37][46] When Beyoncé was eight, she met LaTavia Roberson at an audition for an all-girl entertainment group.[47] They were placed into a group called Girl's Tyme with three other girls, and rapped and danced on the talent show circuit in Houston.[48] After seeing the group, R&B producer Arne Frager brought them to his Northern California studio and placed them in Star Search, the largest talent show on national TV at the time. Girl's Tyme failed to win, and Beyoncé later said the song they performed was not good.[49][50] In 1995, Beyoncé's father, Mathew, resigned from his job to manage the group.[51] The move reduced the family's income by half, and Beyoncé's parents were forced to sell their house and cars and move into separated apartments.[20][52] Mathew cut the original line-up to four and the group continued performing as an opening act for other established R&B girl groups.[47] The girls auditioned before record labels and were finally signed to Elektra Records, moving to Atlanta Records briefly to work on their first recording, only to be cut by the company.[20] This put further strain on the family, and Beyoncé's parents separated. On October 5, 1995, Dwayne Wiggins's Grass Roots Entertainment signed the group. In 1996, the girls began recording their debut album under an agreement with Sony Music, the Knowles family reunited, and shortly after, the group got a contract with Columbia Records with the assistance of Columbia talent scout Teresa LaBarbera Whites.[41] The group changed their name to Destiny's Child in 1996, based upon a passage in the Book of Isaiah.[53] In 1997, Destiny's Child released their major label debut song \"Killing Time\" on the soundtrack to the 1997 film Men in Black.[50] In November, the group released their debut single and first major hit, \"No, No, No\". They released their self-titled debut album in February 1998, which established the group as a viable act in the music industry.[47] The group released their Multi-Platinum second album The Writing's on the Wall in 1999. The record features songs such as \"Bills, Bills, Bills\", the group's first number-one single, \"Jumpin' Jumpin'\" and \"Say My Name\", which became their most successful song at the time, and would remain one of their signature songs. \"Say My Name\" won the Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals and the Best R&B Song at the 43rd Annual Grammy Awards.[47] The Writing's on the Wall sold more than eight million copies worldwide.[49] During this time, Beyoncé recorded a duet with Marc Nelson, an original member of Boyz II Men, on the song \"After All Is Said and Done\" for the soundtrack to the 1999 film, The Best Man, as well as \"Ways To Get Cut Off\", a collaboration with fellow Columbia Records signee JoJo Robinson that was later shelved.[54][55] The remaining band members recorded \"Independent Women Part I\", which appeared on the soundtrack to the 2000 film Charlie's Angels. It became their best-charting single, topping the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart for eleven consecutive weeks.[47] In early 2001, while Destiny's Child was completing their third album, Beyoncé landed a major role in the MTV made-for-television film, Carmen: A Hip Hopera, starring alongside American actor Mekhi Phifer. Set in Philadelphia, the film is a modern interpretation of the 19th-century opera Carmen by French composer Georges Bizet.[56] When the third album Survivor was released in May 2001, Luckett and Roberson filed a lawsuit claiming that the songs were aimed at them.[47] The album debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200, with first-week sales of 663,000 copies sold.[57] The album spawned other number-one hits, \"Bootylicious\" and the title track, \"Survivor\", the latter of which earned the group a Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals.[58] After releasing their holiday album 8 Days of Christmas in October 2001, the group announced a hiatus to further pursue solo careers.[47] In July 2002, Beyoncé made her theatrical film debut, playing Foxxy Cleopatra alongside Mike Myers in the comedy film Austin Powers in Goldmember,[59] which spent its first weekend atop the U.S. box office and grossed $73 million.[60] Beyoncé released \"Work It Out\" as the lead single from its soundtrack album which entered the top ten in the UK, Norway, and Belgium.[61] In 2003, Beyoncé starred opposite Cuba Gooding Jr. in the musical comedy The Fighting Temptations as Lilly, a single mother with whom Gooding's character falls in love.[62] The film received mixed reviews from critics but grossed $30 million in the U.S.[63][64] Beyoncé released \"Fighting Temptation\" as the lead single from the film's soundtrack album, with Missy Elliott, MC Lyte, and Free which was also used to promote the film.[65] Another of Beyoncé's contributions to the soundtrack, \"Summertime\", fared better on the U.S. charts.[66] Beyoncé's first solo recording was a feature on Jay-Z's song \"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\" that was released in October 2002, peaking at number four on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart.[68] On June 14, 2003, Beyoncé premiered songs from her first solo album Dangerously in Love during her first solo concert and the pay-per-view television special, \"Ford Presents Beyoncé Knowles, Friends & Family, Live From Ford's 100th Anniversary Celebration in Dearborn, Michigan\".[69] The album was released on June 24, 2003, after Michelle Williams and Kelly Rowland had released their solo efforts.[70] The album sold 317,000 copies in its first week, debuted atop the Billboard 200,[71] and has since sold 11 million copies worldwide.[72] The album's lead single, \"Crazy in Love\", featuring Jay-Z, became Beyoncé's first number-one single as a solo artist in the US.[73] The single \"Baby Boy\" also reached number one,[67] and singles, \"Me, Myself and I\" and \"Naughty Girl\", both reached the top-five.[74] The album earned Beyoncé a then record-tying five awards at the 46th Annual Grammy Awards; Best Contemporary R&B Album, Best Female R&B Vocal Performance for \"Dangerously in Love 2\", Best R&B Song and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration for \"Crazy in Love\", and Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals for \"The Closer I Get to You\" with Luther Vandross. During the ceremony, she performed with Prince.[75] In November 2003, she embarked on the Dangerously in Love Tour in Europe and later toured alongside Missy Elliott and Alicia Keys for the Verizon Ladies First Tour in North America.[76] On February 1, 2004, Beyoncé performed the American national anthem at Super Bowl XXXVIII, at the Reliant Stadium in Houston, Texas.[77] After the release of Dangerously in Love, Beyoncé had planned to produce a follow-up album using several of the left-over tracks. However, this was put on hold so she could concentrate on recording Destiny Fulfilled, the final studio album by Destiny's Child.[78] Released on November 15, 2004, in the U.S.[79] and peaking at number two on the Billboard 200,[80][81] Destiny Fulfilled included the singles \"Lose My Breath\" and \"Soldier\", which reached the top five on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.[82] Destiny's Child embarked on a worldwide concert tour, Destiny Fulfilled... and Lovin' It sponsored by McDonald's Corporation,[83] and performed songs such as \"No, No, No\", \"Survivor\", \"Say My Name\", \"Independent Women\" and \"Lose My Breath\". In addition to renditions of the group's recorded material, they also performed songs from each singer's solo careers, including numbers from Dangerously in Love. During the last stop of their European tour, in Barcelona on June 11, 2005, Rowland announced that Destiny's Child would disband following the North American leg of the tour.[84] The group released their first compilation album Number 1's on October 25, 2005, in the U.S.[85] and accepted a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in March 2006.[86] The group has sold 60 million records worldwide.[87][88] Beyoncé's second solo album B'Day was released on September 4, 2006, in the U.S., to coincide with her twenty-fifth birthday.[89] It sold 541,000 copies in its first week and debuted atop the Billboard 200, becoming Beyoncé's second consecutive number-one album in the United States.[90] The album's lead single \"Déjà Vu\", featuring Jay-Z, reached the top five on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.[74] The second international single \"Irreplaceable\" was a commercial success worldwide, reaching number one in Australia, Hungary, Ireland, New Zealand and the United States.[74][91] B'Day also produced three other singles; \"Ring the Alarm\",[92] \"Get Me Bodied\",[93] and \"Green Light\" (released in the United Kingdom only).[94] At the 49th Annual Grammy Awards (2007), B'Day was nominated for five Grammy Awards, including Best Contemporary R&B Album, Best Female R&B Vocal Performance for \"Ring the Alarm\" and Best R&B Song and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration\"for \"Déjà Vu\"; the Freemasons club mix of \"Déjà Vu\" without the rap was put forward in the Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical category. B'Day won the award for Best Contemporary R&B Album.[95] The following year, B'Day received two nominations – for Record of the Year for \"Irreplaceable\" and Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals for \"Beautiful Liar\" (with Shakira), also receiving a nomination for Best Compilation Soundtrack Album for Motion Pictures, Television or Other Visual Media for her appearance on Dreamgirls: Music from the Motion Picture (2006).[96] Her first acting role of 2006 was in the comedy film The Pink Panther starring opposite Steve Martin,[97] grossing $158.8 million at the box office worldwide.[98] Her second film Dreamgirls, the film version of the 1981 Broadway musical[99] loosely based on The Supremes, received acclaim from critics and grossed $154 million internationally.[100][101][102] In it, she starred opposite Jennifer Hudson, Jamie Foxx, and Eddie Murphy playing a pop singer based on Diana Ross.[103] To promote the film, Beyoncé released \"Listen\" as the lead single from the soundtrack album.[104] In April 2007, Beyoncé embarked on The Beyoncé Experience, her first worldwide concert tour, visiting 97 venues[105] and grossed over $24 million.[b] Beyoncé conducted pre-concert food donation drives during six major stops in conjunction with her pastor at St. John's and America's Second Harvest. At the same time, B'Day was re-released with five additional songs, including her duet with Shakira \"Beautiful Liar\".[107] I Am... Sasha Fierce was released in November 2008 and formally introduced Beyoncé's alter ego Sasha Fierce.[108] It was met with mixed reviews from critics,[109] but sold 482,000 copies in its first week, debuting atop the Billboard 200, and giving Beyoncé her third consecutive number-one album in the U.S.[110] The album featured her fourth UK number-one single \"If I Were a Boy\" and her fifth U.S. number-one song \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\".[111] \"Halo\" achieved the accomplishment of becoming her longest-running Hot 100 single in her career,[112] \"Halo\"'s success in the U.S. helped Beyoncé attain more top-ten singles on the list than any other woman during the 2000s.[113] The music video for \"Single Ladies\" has been parodied and imitated around the world, spawning the \"first major dance craze\" of the Internet age according to the Toronto Star.[114] At the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, the video won three categories, including Video of the Year.[115] In March 2009, Beyoncé embarked on the I Am... Tour, her second headlining worldwide concert tour, consisting of 108 shows, grossing $119.5 million.[116] Beyoncé further expanded her acting career, starring as blues singer Etta James in the 2008 musical biopic Cadillac Records. Her performance in the film received praise from critics,[117] and she garnered several nominations for her portrayal of James, including a Satellite Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress, and an NAACP Image Award nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress.[118][119] Beyoncé donated her entire salary from the film to Phoenix House, an organization of rehabilitation centers for heroin addicts around the country.[120] Beyoncé starred opposite Ali Larter and Idris Elba in the thriller, Obsessed. She played Sharon Charles, a mother and wife whose family is threatened by her husband's stalker. The film received negative reviews from critics,[121] and did well at the U.S. box office, grossing $68 million – $60 million more than Cadillac Records[122] – on a budget of $20 million.[123] At the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards, Beyoncé received ten nominations, tying with Lauryn Hill for most Grammy nominations in a single year by a female artist.[124] Beyoncé went on to win six of those nominations, breaking a record she previously tied in 2004 for the most Grammy awards won in a single night by a female artist with six. In 2010, Beyoncé provide guest vocals on Lady Gaga's single \"Telephone\".[125][126] The song topped the U.S. Pop Songs chart, becoming the sixth number-one for both Beyoncé and Gaga, tying them with Mariah Carey for most number-ones since the Nielsen Top 40 airplay chart launched in 1992.[127] Beyoncé announced a hiatus from her music career in January 2010, heeding her mother's advice, \"to live life, to be inspired by things again\".[128][129] During the break, she and her father parted ways as business partners.[130][131] Beyoncé's musical break lasted nine months and saw her visit multiple European cities, the Great Wall of China, the Egyptian pyramids, Australia, English music festivals and various museums and ballet performances.[128][132] \"Eat, Play, Love\", a cover story written by Beyoncé for Essence that detailed her 2010 career break, won her a writing award from the New York Association of Black Journalists.[133] On June 26, 2011, she became the first solo female artist to headline the main Pyramid stage at the 2011 Glastonbury Festival in over twenty years.[134][135] The performance was lauded, with several publications noting an ascension in Knowles' capabilities as a live performer. Other publications discussed the polarized attitude of the UK music establishment in response to a Black woman performing on the same stages and to the same crowd sizes that were past reserved for legacy rock acts.[136][137] Her fourth studio album 4 was released two days prior in the U.S.[138] 4 sold 310,000 copies in its first week and debuted atop the Billboard 200 chart, giving Beyoncé her fourth consecutive number-one album in the U.S. The album was preceded by two of its singles \"Run the World (Girls)\" and \"Best Thing I Never Had\".[74][125][139] The fourth single \"Love on Top\" spent seven consecutive weeks at number one on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, while peaking at number 20 on the Billboard Hot 100, the highest peak from the album.[140] In late 2011, she took the stage at New York's Roseland Ballroom for four nights of special performances:[141] the 4 Intimate Nights with Beyoncé concerts saw the performance of her 4 album to a standing room only.[141] On August 1, 2011, the album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), having shipped 1 million copies to retail stores.[142] By December 2015, it reached sales of 1.5 million copies in the U.S.[143] The album reached one billion Spotify streams on February 5, 2018, making Beyoncé the first female artist to have three of their albums surpass one billion streams on the platform.[144] In June 2012, she performed for four nights at Revel Atlantic City's Ovation Hall to celebrate the resort's opening, her first performances since giving birth to her daughter.[145][146] In January 2013, Beyoncé performed the American national anthem singing along with a pre-recorded track at President Obama's second inauguration in Washington, D.C.[147][148] The following month, Beyoncé performed at the Super Bowl XLVII halftime show, held at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans.[149] The performance stands as the second most tweeted about moment in history at 268,000 tweets per minute.[150] Her feature-length documentary film, Life Is But a Dream, first aired on HBO on February 16, 2013.[151] The film was co-directed by Beyoncé herself.[152] Beyoncé embarked on The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour on April 15 in Belgrade, Serbia; the tour included 132 dates that ran through to March 2014.

The album debuted atop the Billboard 200 chart, giving Beyoncé her fifth consecutive number-one album in the U.S.[157] This made her the first woman in the chart's history to have her first five studio albums debut at number one.[158] Beyoncé received critical acclaim[159] and commercial success, selling one million digital copies worldwide in six days;[160] Musically an electro-R&B album, it concerns darker themes previously unexplored in her work, such as \"bulimia, postnatal depression [and] the fears and insecurities of marriage and motherhood\".[161] The single \"Drunk in Love\", featuring Jay-Z, peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.[162] According to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), Beyoncé sold 2.3 million units worldwide, becoming the tenth best-selling album of 2013.[163] The album also went on to become the twentieth best-selling album of 2014.[164] As of November 2014[update], Beyoncé has sold over 5 million copies worldwide and has generated over 1 billion streams, as of March 2015[update].[165] At the 57th Annual Grammy Awards in February 2015, Beyoncé was nominated for six awards, ultimately winning three: Best R&B Performance and Best R&B Song for \"Drunk in Love\", and Best Surround Sound Album for Beyoncé.[166][167] In April 2014, Beyoncé and Jay-Z officially announced their On the Run Tour.

The appearance was considered controversial as it appeared to reference the 50th anniversary of the Black Panther Party and the NFL forbids political statements in its performances.[171][172][173] Immediately following the performance, Beyoncé announced The Formation World Tour, which highlighted stops in both North America and Europe.[174][175] It marked the first ever all-stadium tour by a female artist and ended on October 7, with Beyoncé bringing out her husband Jay-Z, Kendrick Lamar, and Serena Williams for the last show.[176] The tour went on to win Tour of the Year at the 44th American Music Awards.[177] In April 2016, Beyoncé released a teaser clip for a project called Lemonade. A one-hour film which aired on HBO on April 23, a corresponding album with the same title was released on the same day exclusively on Tidal.[178] Lemonade debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200, making Beyoncé the first act in Billboard history to have their first six studio albums debut atop the chart; she broke a record previously tied with DMX in 2013.[179] With all 12 tracks of Lemonade debuting on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, Beyoncé also became the first female act to chart 12 or more songs at the same time.[180] Lemonade was streamed 115 million times through Tidal, setting a record for the most-streamed album in a single week by a female artist in history.[181] It was 2016's third highest-selling album in the U.S. with 1.554 million copies sold in that time period within the country[182] as well as the best-selling album worldwide with global sales of 2.5 million throughout the year.[183] Lemonade became the most critically acclaimed work of her career.[184] Several music publications included the album among the best of 2016, including Rolling Stone, which listed Lemonade at number one.[185] The album's visuals were nominated in 11 categories at the 2016 MTV Video Music Awards, the most ever received by Beyoncé in a single year, and went on to win 8 awards, including Video of the Year for \"Formation\".[186][187] The eight wins made Beyoncé the most-awarded artist in the history of the VMAs (24), surpassing Madonna (20).[188] Beyoncé occupied the sixth place for Time magazine's 2016 Person of the Year.[189] In January 2017, it was announced that Beyoncé would headline the Coachella Music and Arts Festival. This would have made Beyoncé only the second female headliner of the festival since it was founded in 1999.[190] It was later announced on February 23, 2017, that Beyoncé would no longer be able to perform at the festival due to doctor's concerns regarding her pregnancy. The festival owners announced that she would instead headline the 2018 festival.[191] Upon the announcement of Beyoncé's departure from the festival lineup, ticket prices dropped by 12%.[192] At the 59th Grammy Awards in February 2017, Lemonade led the nominations with nine, including Album, Record, and Song of the Year for Lemonade and \"Formation\" respectively.[193] and ultimately won two, Best Urban Contemporary Album for Lemonade and Best Music Video for \"Formation\".[194] In September 2017, Beyoncé collaborated with J Balvin and Willy William, to release a remix of the song \"Mi Gente\". Beyoncé donated all proceeds from the song to hurricane charities for those affected by Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma in Texas, Mexico, Puerto Rico, and other Caribbean Islands.[195] On November 10, Eminem released \"Walk on Water\" featuring Beyoncé as the lead single from his album Revival. On November 30, Ed Sheeran announced that Beyoncé would feature on the remix to his song \"Perfect\".[196] \"Perfect Duet\" was released on December 1, 2017. The song reached number-one in the United States, becoming Beyoncé's sixth song of her solo career to do so.[197] On January 4, 2018, the music video of Beyoncé and Jay-Z's 4:44 collaboration, \"Family Feud\" was released.[198] It was directed by Ava DuVernay. On March 1, 2018, DJ Khaled released \"Top Off\" as the first single from his forthcoming album Father of Asahd featuring Beyoncé, husband Jay-Z, and Future.[199] On March 5, 2018, a joint tour with Knowles's husband Jay-Z, was leaked on Facebook.[200] Information about the tour was later taken down. The couple announced the joint tour officially as On the Run II Tour on March 12[201] and simultaneously released a trailer for the tour on YouTube.[202] On April 14, 2018, Beyoncé played the first of two weekends as the headlining act of the Coachella Music Festival. Her performance of April 14, attended by 125,000 festival-goers, was immediately praised, with multiple media outlets describing it as historic. The performance became the most-tweeted-about performance of weekend one, as well as the most-watched live Coachella performance and the most-watched live performance on YouTube of all time. The show paid tribute to black culture, specifically historically black colleges and universities and featured a live band with over 100 dancers. Destiny's Child also reunited during the show.[203][204] On June 6, 2018, Beyoncé and husband Jay-Z kicked-off the On the Run II Tour in Cardiff, United Kingdom. Ten days later, at their final London performance, the pair unveiled Everything Is Love, their joint studio album, credited under the name The Carters, and initially available exclusively on Tidal. The pair also released the video for the album's lead single, \"Apeshit\", on Beyoncé's official YouTube channel.[205][206] Everything Is Love received generally positive reviews,[207] and debuted at number two on the U.S. Billboard 200, with 123,000 album-equivalent units, of which 70,000 were pure album sales.[208] On December 2, 2018, Beyoncé alongside Jay-Z headlined the Global Citizen Festival: Mandela 100 which was held at FNB Stadium in Johannesburg, South Africa.[209] Their 2-hour performance had concepts similar to the On the Run II Tour and Beyoncé was praised for her outfits, which paid tribute to Africa's diversity.[210] Homecoming: A Film by Beyoncé, a documentary and concert film focusing on Beyoncé's historic 2018 Coachella performances, was released by Netflix on April 17, 2019.[211][212] The film was accompanied by the surprise live album Homecoming: The Live Album.[213] It was later reported that Beyoncé and Netflix had signed a $60 million deal to produce three different projects, one of which is Homecoming.[214] Homecoming: A Film by Beyoncé received six nominations at the 71st Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards.[215] Beyoncé starred as the voice of Nala in the remake The Lion King, which was released in July 2019.[216] Beyoncé is featured on the film's soundtrack, released on July 11, 2019, with a remake of the song \"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\" alongside Donald Glover, Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen, which was originally composed by Elton John.[217] An original song from the film by Beyoncé, \"Spirit\", was released as the lead single from both the soundtrack and The Lion King: The Gift – a companion album released alongside the film, produced and curated by Beyoncé.[218][219] Beyoncé called The Lion King: The Gift a \"sonic cinema\". She stated that the album is influenced by everything from R&B, pop, hip hop, gqom and Afro Beat.[218][220] The songs were produced by African producers, which Beyoncé said was because \"authenticity and heart were important to [her]\", since the film is set in Africa.[218] In September of the same year, a documentary chronicling the development, production and early music video filming of The Lion King: The Gift entitled \"Beyoncé Presents: Making The Gift\" was aired on ABC.[221] In March 2020, a photograph Beyoncé captured of her swimming pool was used as the album cover for rapper Jay Electronica's highly anticipated debut album A Written Testimony.[222] In April of the same year, Beyoncé was featured on the remix of Megan Thee Stallion's song \"Savage\", marking her first music release for the year.[223] The song peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, marking Beyoncé's eleventh song to do so across all acts.[224] On June 19, 2020, Beyoncé released the nonprofit charity single \"Black Parade\".[225] On June 23, she followed up the release of its studio version with an a cappella version exclusively on Tidal.[226] Black Is King, a visual album based on the music of The Lion King: The Gift, premiered globally on Disney+ on July 31, 2020. Produced by Disney and Parkwood Entertainment, the film was written, directed and executively produced by Beyoncé. The film was described by Disney as \"a celebratory memoir for the world on the Black experience\".[227] Beyoncé received the most nominations (9) at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards and the most awards (4), which made her the most-awarded singer, most-awarded female artist, and second-most-awarded artist in Grammy history.[228] In 2021, Beyoncé wrote and recorded a song titled \"Be Alive\" for the biographical drama film King Richard.[229] She received her first Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song at the 94th Academy Awards for the song, alongside co-writer Dixson.[230] On March 27, 2022, Beyoncé performed \"Be Alive\" at the 94th Academy Awards. Choreographed by friend and past collaborator Fatima Robinson, Beyoncé was applauded for choosing to perform on the Compton tennis courts Venus and Serena Williams practiced on in their childhood instead of at the venue.[231][232] On June 9, 2022, Beyoncé removed her profile pictures across various social media platforms, causing speculation that she would be releasing new music.[233] Days later, Beyoncé caused further speculation via her nonprofit BeyGood's Twitter account hinting at her upcoming seventh studio album.[234] On June 15, 2022, Beyoncé officially announced her seventh studio album, titled Renaissance.[235] The lead single of Renaissance, \"Break My Soul\", was released on June 20, 2022.[236] The album was released on July 29, 2022.[237][238] \"Break My Soul\" became Beyoncé's 20th top ten single on the Billboard Hot 100, which made her join Paul McCartney and Michael Jackson as the only artists in Hot 100 history to achieve at least twenty top tens as a solo artist and ten as a member of a group.[239] As Renaissance was released, Beyoncé announced that the album was the first installment of a trilogy she conceived and recorded over three years during the COVID-19 pandemic. A time she found to be her \"most creative [period].\"[240][235] The three recorded projects are designated into acts under Roman numerals.[241] Upon release, Renaissance received universal acclaim from critics.[242] Renaissance debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart, making her the first female artist to have her first seven studio albums debut at number one in the United States.[243] \"Break My Soul\" concurrently rose to number-one on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming the twelfth song to do so across her career discography.[244] The song \"Heated\", which was co-written with Canadian rapper Drake, originally included the lyrics \"Spazzin' on that ass / spazz on that ass\". Critics, including a number of disability charities and activists, argued that the word \"spaz\" represented a derogatory term for spastic diplegia, a form of cerebral palsy. In response, in August 2022, a representative for Beyoncé issued a statement and explained that \"The word, not used intentionally in a harmful way, will be replaced\".[245][246] On January 21, 2023, Beyoncé performed in Dubai at a private show.[247] The performance, which was her first full concert in more than four years, was delivered to an audience of influencers and journalists.[248] Beyoncé was reportedly paid $24 million to perform.[249] Beyoncé faced criticism for her decision to perform in the United Arab Emirates where homosexuality is illegal.[249][248][250] On February 1, Beyoncé announced the Renaissance World Tour with dates in North America and Europe,[251] becoming for a short-span, the highest-grossing tour by a female artist.[252] On July 28, Beyoncé appeared on \"Delresto (Echoes)\", the second single from rapper Travis Scott's album Utopia, eventually becoming her 100th career appearance on the Billboard Hot 100 chart (encompassing Destiny's Child, her solo career, and musical duo The Carters).[253] On November 30, 2023, Beyoncé released documentary concert film Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé written, directed, and produced by her in collaboration with film distributor AMC Theatres. The film chronicles the development and execution of Beyoncé's Renaissance World Tour, and contained new song \"My House\" in the end credits.[254] In February 2024, Beyoncé launched her hair care brand Cécred.[255] On February 11, 2024, immediately following a partner commercial with Verizon for the Super Bowl LVIII, she announced the second installment of her trilogy project and released its first two songs, \"Texas Hold 'Em\" and \"16 Carriages\".[256] \"Texas Hold 'Em\" became her highest chart debut in her career, her ninth solo number-one and her thirteenth across all credits on the Billboard Hot 100. On March 12, 2024, she announced the album's title, Cowboy Carter.[257][258] A country and gospel-tinged record, it was released on March 29 to universal acclaim from critics, and includes collaborations with artists including Tanner Adell and her daughter Rumi Carter, Miley Cyrus, Tiera Kennedy, Willie Jones, Post Malone, Linda Martell, Willie Nelson, Shaboozey, Brittney Spencer, Dolly Parton, and Reyna Roberts.[259] In July 2024, NBC released two promotional commercials featuring Beyoncé for their coverage of the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, France.[260] Set to Cowboy Carter songs \"Ya Ya\" and \"Just For Fun\", she introduced the entire USA Olympic Team and Gold-medal gymnast Simone Biles, respectively.[261][262] On August 20, Beyoncé announced SirDavis, a whiskey in collaboration with Moët Hennessy developed for years prior and co-founded with master distiller Dr. Bill Lumsden.[263] In October 2024, Levi's launched a four-part global campaign with Beyoncé titled \"Reiimagine\" that will stretch into 2025 and focus on women's history of the company, using Cowboy Carter track \"Levii's Jeans\".[264] The first commercial starring Beyoncé amassed 2.4 billion impressions in under a month.[265] Beyoncé reprised her role as Nala for Mufasa: The Lion King, a prequel to the 2019 remake, released in December 2024.[266] On December 25, 2024, Beyoncé headlined the first ever NFL Christmas Gameday Halftime Show.[267] With \"Single Ladies\", clearly I'd just gotten married, and people want to get married every day – then there was the whole Justin Timberlake thing [recreating the video] on Saturday Night Live, and it was also the year YouTube blew up. With \"Irreplaceable\", the aggressive lyrics, the acoustic guitar, and the 808 drum machine – those things don't typically go together, and it sounded fresh. \"Crazy in Love\" was another one of those classic moments in pop culture that none of us expected. I asked Jay to get on the song the night before I had to turn my album in – thank God he did. It still never gets old, no matter how many times I sing it. Critics have described Beyoncé's voice as being mezzo-soprano.[269][270] Jody Rosen highlights her tone and timbre as particularly distinctive, describing her voice as \"one of the most compelling instruments in popular music\".[271] Her vocal abilities mean she is identified as the centerpiece of Destiny's Child.[272] Jon Pareles of The New York Times commented that her voice is \"velvety yet tart, with an insistent flutter and reserves of soul belting\".[273] Rosen notes that the hip hop era highly influenced Beyoncé's unique rhythmic vocal style, but also finds her quite traditionalist in her use of balladry, gospel and falsetto.[271] Other critics praise her range and power, with Chris Richards of The Washington Post saying she was \"capable of punctuating any beat with goose-bump-inducing whispers or full-bore diva-roars.\"[274] On the 2023 Rolling Stone's list of the 200 Greatest Singers of all time, Beyoncé ranked at number 8, with the publication noting that \"in [her] voice lies the entire history of Black music\".[275] Beyoncé's music is generally R&B,[276][277] pop[276][278] and hip hop[279] but she also incorporates soul and funk into her songs. 4 demonstrated Beyoncé's exploration of 1990s-style R&B, as well as further use of soul and hip hop than compared to previous releases.[268] While she almost exclusively releases English songs, Beyoncé recorded several Spanish songs for Irreemplazable (re-recordings of songs from B'Day for a Spanish-language audience), and the re-release of B'Day. To record these, Beyoncé was coached phonetically by American record producer Rudy Perez.[280] Beyoncé has received co-writing credits for most of her songs.[281] Her early songs with Destiny's Child were personally driven and female-empowerment themed compositions like \"Independent Women\" and \"Survivor\", but after the start of her relationship with Jay-Z, she transitioned to more man-tending anthems such as \"Cater 2 U\".[282] Beyoncé's songwriting process is also known for combining parts of different tracks, resulting in alteration of song structures. Sia, who co-wrote \"Pretty Hurts\", called Beyoncé \"very Frankenstein when she comes to songs\";[283] Diana Gordon, who co-wrote \"Don't Hurt Yourself\" called her a \"scientist of songs\";[284] Caroline Polachek who co-wrote \"No Angel\", called her a \"genius writer and producer for this reason. She's so good at seeing connections.\"[285] In 2001, she became the first Black woman and second female lyricist to win the Pop Songwriter of the Year award at the ASCAP Pop Music Awards.[20][286] Beyoncé was the third woman to have writing credits on three number-one songs (\"Irreplaceable\", \"Grillz\" and \"Check on It\") in the same year, after Carole King in 1971 and Mariah Carey in 1991. She is tied with American lyricist Diane Warren at third with nine songwriting credits on number-one singles.[287] The latter wrote her song \"I Was Here\" for 4, which was motivated by the September 11 attacks.[288] In May 2011, Billboard magazine listed Beyoncé at number 17 on their list of the Top 20 Hot 100 Songwriters for having co-written eight singles that hit number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. She was one of only three women on that list, along with Alicia Keys and Taylor Swift.[289] Beyoncé has received criticism, including from journalists and musicians, for the extensive writing credits on her songs.[281] The controversy surrounding her songwriting credits began with interviews in which she attributed herself as the songwriter for songs in which she was a co-writer[290] or for which her contributions were marginal.[281] In a cover story for Vanity Fair in 2005, she claimed to have \"written\" several number-one songs for Destiny's Child, contrary to the credits, which list her as a co-writer among others.[290] During a 2007 interview with Barbara Walters, she claimed to have conceived the musical idea for the Destiny's Child song \"Bootylicious\",[291] which provoked the song's producer Rob Fusari to call her father and then-manager Mathew Knowles in protest over the claim. In 2010, Fusari told Billboard: \"[Knowles] explained to me, in a nice way, he said, 'People don't want to hear about Rob Fusari, producer from Livingston, N.J. No offense, but that's not what sells records. What sells records is people believing that the artist is everything.'\"[292] However, in an interview for Entertainment Weekly in 2016, Fusari said Beyoncé \"had the 'Bootylicious' concept in her head. That was totally her. She knew what she wanted to say. It was very urban pop angle that they were taking on the record.\"[293] I am really passionate about all of the steps [during] the production [...] I love to stack vocals, and I love to create my own little Oreo with arrangements, sometimes it can be thousands of vocals [and then] I go back and then kind of piece things together, because usually the songs are way too long [...] I go back and edit the structure of the song. [I] make sure that [...] every section has an intention, so that takes months. [...] I hear certain elements of things that go with things that are opposites. I am rarely happy with one track, it's usually four or five things put together that again don't really go together. I am so excited when I'm able to adjust the tempo and key and mute certain elements that don't complement and put opposites together. Sometimes it's just like the EQ of a synth or the warmth of a bass or the distortion of a bass that's on a different song and I can hear like, 'Ah! That's exactly what is missing to make the track full and complete!' Beyoncé's collaborators frequently mention her talent and involvement in the record production of her songs,[295][296] sometimes describing her as a genius in the skill.[297] She is known to have favorite saturation and distortion plug‑ins, intentionality about stereo imaging and concentration on individual elements of her songs as a \"focal point\" in production.[298] Beyoncé names Michael Jackson as her major musical influence.[299][300] Aged five, Beyoncé attended her first ever concert where Jackson performed and she claims to have realized her purpose.[301] When she presented him with a tribute award at the World Music Awards in 2006, Beyoncé said, \"if it wasn't for Michael Jackson, I would never ever have performed.\"[302] Beyoncé was heavily influenced by Tina Turner, and once said \"Tina Turner is someone that I admire, because she made her strength feminine and sexy\".[303][304] She admires Diana Ross as an \"all-around entertainer\",[305] and Whitney Houston, who she said \"inspired me to get up there and do what she did.\"[306][307] Beyoncé cited Madonna as an influence \"not only for her musical style, but also for her business sense\",[308] saying that she wanted to \"follow in the footsteps of Madonna and be a powerhouse and have my own empire.\"[309] She also credits Mariah Carey's singing and her song \"Vision of Love\" as influencing her to begin practicing vocal runs as a child.[310][311] Her other musical influences include Rachelle Ferrell,[312] Aaliyah,[313] Janet Jackson,[314] Prince,[315] Lauryn Hill,[305] Sade Adu,[316] Donna Summer,[317] Fairuz,[318][319] Mary J. Blige,[320] Selena,[321] Anita Baker, and Toni Braxton.[305] The feminism and female empowerment themes on Beyoncé's second solo album B'Day were inspired by her role in Dreamgirls[322] and by singer Josephine Baker.[323] Beyoncé paid homage to Baker by performing \"Déjà Vu\" at the 2006 Fashion Rocks concert wearing Baker's trademark mini-hula skirt embellished with fake bananas.[324] Beyoncé's third solo album, I Am... Sasha Fierce, was inspired by Jay-Z and especially by Etta James, whose \"boldness\" inspired Beyoncé to explore other musical genres and styles.[325] Her fourth solo album, 4, was inspired by Fela Kuti, 1990s R&B, Earth, Wind & Fire, DeBarge, Lionel Richie, Teena Marie, The Jackson 5, New Edition, Adele, Florence and the Machine, and Prince.[268] Beyoncé has stated that she is personally inspired by Michelle Obama (the 44th First Lady of the United States), saying \"she proves you can do it all\",[326] and has described Oprah Winfrey as \"the definition of inspiration and a strong woman.\"[305] She has also discussed how Jay-Z is a continuing inspiration to her, both with what she describes as his lyrical genius and in the obstacles he has overcome in his life.[327] Beyoncé has expressed admiration for the artist Jean-Michel Basquiat, posting in a letter \"what I find in the work of Jean-Michel Basquiat, I search for in every day in music ... he is lyrical and raw\".[328][329] Beyoncé has also cited Cher as a fashion inspiration.[330] In 2006, Beyoncé introduced her all-female tour band Suga Mama (also the name of a song on B'Day) which includes bassists, drummers, guitarists, horn players, keyboardists and percussionists.[331] Her background singers, The Mamas, consist of Montina Cooper-Donnell, Crystal Collins and Tiffany Moniqué Riddick. They made their debut appearance at the 2006 BET Awards and re-appeared in the music videos for \"Irreplaceable\" and \"Green Light\".[280] The band have supported Beyoncé in most subsequent live performances, including her 2007 concert tour The Beyoncé Experience, I Am... Tour (2009–2010), The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour (2013–2014) and The Formation World Tour (2016). Beyoncé has received praise for her stage presence and voice during live performances. According to Barbara Ellen of The Guardian, Beyoncé is the most in-charge female artist she's seen onstage.[332] Similarly, Alice Jones of The Independent wrote she \"takes her role as entertainer so seriously she's almost too good.\"[333] The ex-President of Def Jam L.A. Reid has described Beyoncé as the greatest entertainer alive.[334] Jim Farber of the Daily News and Stephanie Classen of The StarPhoenix both praised her strong voice and her stage presence.[335][336] I choose to invest my time and energy only in projects that I am passionate about. Once I've committed, I give it all of me. I start with identifying my intention and making sure that I am aligned with the collaborators for the same purpose. It takes enormous patience to rock with me. My process is tedious. I review every second of footage several times and know it backwards and forwards. I find every ounce of magic and then I deconstruct it. I keep building more layers and repeat this editing process for months. I won't let up until it's undeniably reached its full potential. I believe my strength is understanding how storytelling, music, lighting, angles, fashion, art direction, history, dance, and editing work together. They are all equally important. Beyoncé's stage outfits have been met with criticism from many countries, such as Malaysia, where she has postponed or cancelled performances due to the country's strict laws banning revealing costumes.[338] Beyoncé has worked with numerous directors for her music videos throughout her career, including Melina Matsoukas, Jonas Åkerlund, and Jake Nava. Bill Condon, director of Beauty and the Beast, stated that the Lemonade visuals in particular served as inspiration for his film, commenting, \"You look at Beyoncé's brilliant movie Lemonade, this genre is taking on so many different forms ... I do think that this very old-school break-out-into-song traditional musical is something that people understand again and really want.\"[339] Described as being \"sexy, seductive and provocative\" when performing on stage, Beyoncé has said that she originally created the alter ego \"Sasha Fierce\" to keep that stage persona separate from who she really is. She described Sasha Fierce as being \"too aggressive, too strong, too sassy [and] too sexy\", stating, \"I'm not like her in real life at all.\"[340] Sasha was conceived during the making of \"Crazy in Love\", and Beyoncé introduced her with the release of her 2008 album, I Am... Sasha Fierce. In February 2010, she announced in an interview with Allure magazine that she was comfortable enough with herself to no longer need Sasha Fierce.[341] However, Beyoncé announced in May 2012 that she would bring her back for her Revel Presents: Beyoncé Live shows later that month.[342] Beyoncé has been described as having sex appeal, with music journalist Touré writing that since the release of Dangerously in Love, she has \"become a crossover sex symbol\".[343] When off stage, Beyoncé says that while she likes to dress sexily, her onstage dress \"is absolutely for the stage\".[344] Due to her curves and the term's catchiness, in the 2000s, the media often used the term \"bootylicious\" (a portmanteau of the words \"booty\" and \"delicious\") to describe Beyoncé,[345][346] the term popularized by the single of the same name by her group Destiny's Child. In 2006, it was added to the Oxford English Dictionary.[347] In September 2010, Beyoncé made her runway modelling debut at Tom Ford's Spring/Summer 2011 fashion show.[348] She was named the \"World's Most Beautiful Woman\" by People[349] and the \"Hottest Female Singer of All Time\" by Complex in 2012.[350] In January 2013, GQ placed her on its cover, featuring her atop its \"100 Sexiest Women of the 21st Century\" list.[351][352] VH1 listed her at number 1 on its 100 Sexiest Artists list.[353] Several wax figures of Beyoncé are found at Madame Tussauds Wax Museums in major cities around the world.[354] According to Italian fashion designer Roberto Cavalli, Beyoncé uses different fashion styles to work with her music while performing.[355] Her mother co-wrote a book, published in 2002, titled Destiny's Style,[356] an account of how fashion affected the trio's success.[357] The B'Day Anthology Video Album showed many instances of fashion-oriented footage, depicting classic to contemporary wardrobe styles.[358] In 2007, Beyoncé was featured on the cover of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue, becoming the second African American woman after model and television personality Tyra Banks,[359] and People magazine recognized Beyoncé as the best-dressed celebrity.[360] Beyoncé has been nicknamed \"Queen Bey\" by publications over the years. The term is a reference to the common phrase \"queen bee\", a term used for the leader of a group of females. The nickname also refers to the Queen bee of a beehive, with her fan base being named \"BeyHive\". BeyHive was previously titled \"The Beyontourage\", (a portmanteau of Beyoncé and entourage), but was changed after online petitions on Twitter and online news reports during competitions.[361] In 2006, the animal rights organization People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), criticized Beyoncé for wearing and using fur in her clothing line House of Deréon.[362] Emmett Price, a professor of music at Northeastern University, wrote in 2007 that he thinks race plays a role in many criticisms of Beyoncé's image, saying white celebrities who dress similarly do not attract as many comments.[363] In 2008, the French personal care company L'Oréal was accused of whitening her skin in their Feria hair color advertisements, responding that \"it is categorically untrue\",[364][365] and in 2013, Beyoncé herself criticized H&M for their proposed \"retouching\" of promotional images of her, and according to Vogue requested that only \"natural pictures be used\".[366] Beyoncé has been a vocal advocate for the Black Lives Matter movement. The release of \"Formation\" on February 6, 2016, saw her celebrate her Sub-Saharan Black African ancestry, with the song's music video featuring pro-black imagery and a shot of wall graffiti that says \"Stop shooting us\". The day after the song's release, she performed it at the 2016 Super Bowl halftime show with back up dancers dressed to represent the Black Panther Party. This incited criticism from conservative politicians and police officers, with some police boycotting Beyoncé's then upcoming Formation World Tour.[367] Beyoncé responded to the backlash by releasing tour merchandise that said \"Boycott Beyoncé\",[368][369][370] and later clarified her sentiment, saying: \"Anyone who perceives my message as anti-police is completely mistaken. I have so much admiration and respect for officers and the families of officers who sacrifice themselves to keep us safe,\" Beyoncé said. \"But let's be clear: I am against police brutality and injustice. Those are two separate things.\"[371] In 2002, Beyoncé and Jay-Z collaborated on the song \"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\",[372] which appeared on his seventh album The Blueprint 2: The Gift & The Curse (2002).[373] Beyoncé appeared as Jay-Z's girlfriend in the music video for the song, fueling speculation about their relationship.[374] On April 4, 2008, Beyoncé and Jay-Z married without publicity.[375] As of April 2014[update], the couple had sold a combined 300 million records together.[168] They are known for their private relationship, although they have appeared to become more relaxed since 2013.[376] Both have acknowledged difficulty that arose in their marriage after Jay-Z had an affair.[377][378] Beyoncé miscarried around 2010 or 2011, describing it as \"the saddest thing\" she had ever endured.[379] She returned to the studio and wrote music to cope with the loss. In April 2011, Beyoncé and Jay-Z traveled to Paris to shoot the album cover for 4, and she unexpectedly became pregnant in Paris.[380] In August, the couple attended the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, at which Beyoncé performed \"Love On Top\" and ended the performance by revealing she was pregnant.[381] Her appearance helped that year's MTV Video Music Awards become the most-watched broadcast in MTV history, pulling in 12.4 million viewers;[382] the announcement was listed in Guinness World Records for \"most tweets per second recorded for a single event\" on Twitter,[383] receiving 8,868 tweets per second[384] and \"Beyonce pregnant\" was the most Googled phrase the week of August 29, 2011.[385] On January 7, 2012, Beyoncé gave birth to a daughter, Blue Ivy, at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.[386] Following the release of Lemonade, which included the single \"Sorry\", in 2016, speculations arose about Jay-Z's alleged infidelity with a mistress referred to as \"Becky\". Jon Pareles in The New York Times pointed out that many of the accusations were \"aimed specifically and recognizably\" at him.[387] Similarly, Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone noted the lines \"Suck on my balls, I've had enough\" were an \"unmistakable hint\" that the lyrics revolve around Jay-Z.[388] On February 1, 2017, she revealed on her Instagram account that she was expecting twins. Her announcement gained over 6.3 million likes within eight hours, breaking the world record for the most liked image on the website at the time.[389] On July 13, 2017, Beyoncé uploaded the first image of herself and the twins onto her Instagram account, confirming their birth date as a month prior, on June 13, 2017,[390] with the post becoming the second most liked on Instagram, behind her own pregnancy announcement.[391] The twins, a daughter named Rumi and a son named Sir, were born at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in California via caesarean section. She wrote of her pregnancy and its aftermath in the September 2018 issue of Vogue, in which she had full control of the cover, shot at Hammerwood Park by photographer Tyler Mitchell.[392][393] Beyoncé performed \"America the Beautiful\" at President Barack Obama's 2009 presidential inauguration, as well as \"At Last\" during the first inaugural dance at the Neighborhood Ball two days later.[394] The couple held a fundraiser at Jay-Z's 40/40 Club in Manhattan for President Obama's 2012 presidential campaign[395] which raised $4 million.[396] Beyoncé voted for Obama in the 2012 presidential election.[397] She performed the American national anthem \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" at his second inauguration in January 2013.[147] The Washington Post reported in May 2015, that Beyoncé attended a major celebrity fundraiser for 2016 presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.[398] She also headlined for Clinton in a concert held the weekend before Election Day the next year. In this performance, Beyoncé and her entourage of backup dancers wore pantsuits; a clear allusion to Clinton's frequent dress-of-choice. The backup dancers also wore \"I'm with her\" tee shirts, the campaign slogan for Clinton. In a brief speech at this performance Beyoncé said, \"I want my daughter to grow up seeing a woman lead our country and knowing that her possibilities are limitless.\"[399] She endorsed the bid of Beto O'Rourke during the 2018 United States Senate election in Texas.[400] In July 2024, Beyoncé gave Vice President Kamala Harris permission to use Lemonade promotional single \"Freedom\" as the official song for her 2024 presidential campaign.[401][402] Harris subsequently launched a digital ad in support of her candidacy featuring the song.[403] In October 2024, Beyoncé, alongside her mother Tina and Kelly Rowland endorsed Harris for president at a campaign rally in her hometown of Houston.[404] In a 2013 interview with Vogue, Beyoncé stated that she considered herself to be \"a modern-day feminist\".[405] She would later align herself more publicly with the movement, sampling \"We should all be feminists\", a speech delivered by Nigerian author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie at a TEDx talk in April 2013, in her song \"Flawless\", released later that year.[406] The next year she performed live at the MTV Video Awards in front a giant backdrop reading \"Feminist\".[407] Her self-identification incited a circulation of opinions and debate about whether her feminism is aligned with older, more established feminist ideals. Annie Lennox, celebrated artist and feminist advocate, referred to Beyoncé's use of her word feminist as 'feminist lite'.[408] Adichie responded with \"her type of feminism is not mine, as it is the kind that, at the same time, gives quite a lot of space to the necessity of men.\"[409] Adichie expands upon what \"feminist lite\" means to her, referring that \"more troubling is the idea, in Feminism Lite, that men are naturally superior but should be expected to 'treat women well'\" and \"we judge powerful women more harshly than we judge powerful men. And Feminism Lite enables this.\"[410] Beyoncé responded about her intent by utilizing the definition of feminist with her platform was to \"give clarity to the true meaning\" behind it. She says to understand what being a feminist is, \"it's very simple. It's someone who believes in equal rights for men and women.\" She advocated to provide equal opportunities for young boys and girls, men and women must begin to understand the double standards that remain persistent in our societies and the issue must be illuminated in effort to start making changes.[411] She has also contributed to the Ban Bossy campaign, which uses TV and social media to encourage leadership in girls.[412] Following Beyoncé's public identification as a feminist, the sexualized nature of her performances and the fact that she championed her marriage was questioned.[413] In December 2012, Beyoncé along with a variety of other celebrities teamed up and produced a video campaign for \"Demand A Plan\", a bipartisan effort by a group of 950 U.S. mayors and others[414] designed to influence the federal government into rethinking its gun control laws, following the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.[415] Beyoncé publicly endorsed same-sex marriage on March 26, 2013, after the Supreme Court debate on California's Proposition 8.[416] She spoke against North Carolina's Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act, a bill passed (and later repealed) that discriminated against the LGBT community in public places in a statement during her concert in Raleigh as part of the Formation World Tour in 2016.[417] She has condemned police brutality against black Americans. She and Jay-Z attended a rally in 2013 in response to the acquittal of George Zimmerman for the killing of Trayvon Martin.[418] The film for her sixth album Lemonade included the mothers of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown and Eric Garner, holding pictures of their sons in the video for \"Freedom\".[419] In a 2016 interview with Elle, Beyoncé responded to the controversy surrounding her song \"Formation\" which was perceived to be critical of the police. She clarified, \"I am against police brutality and injustice. Those are two separate things. If celebrating my roots and culture during Black History Month made anyone uncomfortable, those feelings were there long before a video and long before me\".[420] In February 2017, Beyoncé spoke out against the withdrawal of protections for transgender students in public schools by Donald Trump's presidential administration. Posting a link to the 100 Days of Kindness campaign on her Facebook page, Beyoncé voiced her support for transgender youth and joined a roster of celebrities who spoke out against Trump's decision.[421] Beyoncé has been documented pursuing many passions, sometimes being described as a renaissance woman.[422][423] Some of these include canvas painting,[424] video editing,[425] poetry,[426] scriptwriting,[427] lighting and stage design,[428] animation and clothes design,[429] photography,[222] cultural historiography[430] and beekeeping (with around 80,000 bees).[337] I started painting portraits of women [in 2002], while filming Austin Powers [...] I got hooked and wouldn't sleep. I made this special room with saris and pillows. I would light candles, play Miles Davis and Björk, and paint all night. It was very therapeutic. Whenever I finish one of my paintings, I try to figure out what it represents in my life. I'll be like, 'It's dark behind her and light in front of her, so a dark period must be coming to an end. Something light and beautiful is going to happen.' Forbes magazine began reporting on Beyoncé's earnings in 2008, calculating that the $80 million earned between June 2007 to June 2008, for her music, tour, films and clothing line made her the world's best-paid music personality at the time, above Madonna and Celine Dion.[431][432] It placed her fourth on the Celebrity 100 list in 2009[433] and ninth on the \"Most Powerful Women in the World\" list in 2010.[434] The following year, the magazine placed her eighth on the \"Best-Paid Celebrities Under 30\" list, having earned $35 million in the past year for her clothing line and endorsement deals. In 2012, Forbes placed Beyoncé at number 16 on the Celebrity 100 list, twelve places lower than three years ago yet still having earned $40 million in the past year for her album 4, clothing line and endorsement deals.[435][436] In 2012, Beyoncé and Jay-Z placed at number one on the \"World's Highest-Paid Celebrity Couples\", for collectively earning $78 million.[437] The couple made it into the previous year's Guinness World Records as the \"highest-earning power couple\" for collectively earning $122 million in 2009.[438] For the years 2009 to 2011, Beyoncé earned an average of $70 million per year, and earned $40 million in 2012.[439] In 2013, Beyoncé's endorsements of Pepsi and H&M made her and Jay-Z the world's first billion-dollar couple in the music industry.[440] That year, Beyoncé was listed as the fourth-most-powerful celebrity in the Forbes rankings.[441] In June 2014, Beyoncé ranked at number one on the Forbes Celebrity 100 list, earning an estimated $115 million throughout June 2013 – June 2014. This in turn was the first time she had topped the Celebrity 100 list as well as being her highest yearly earnings to date.[442] In 2016, Beyoncé ranked at number 34 on the Celebrity 100 list with earnings of $54 million. She and Jay-Z also topped the highest-paid celebrity couple list, with combined earnings of $107.5 million.[443] Beyoncé is one of the wealthiest musical artists. As of 2018[update], Forbes calculated her net worth to be $355 million, and in June of the same year, ranked her as the 35th-highest-earning celebrity, with annual earnings of $60 million. This tied Beyoncé with Madonna as the only two female artists to earn more than $100 million within a single year twice.[444][445] As a couple, Beyoncé and Jay-Z have a combined net worth of $1.16 billion.[446] In July 2017, Billboard announced that Beyoncé was the highest-paid musician of 2016, with an estimated total of $62.1 million.[447] By December 2023, Forbes estimated Beyoncé's net worth to be $800 million.[448] In 2023, the couple bought a house in Malibu, California, designed by the architect Tadao Ando, for $200 million. It established a record for the most expensive residence sold in the state of California.[449] Beyoncé's success has led to her becoming a cultural icon and earning her the nickname \"Queen Bey\".[450] Constance Grady wrote for Vox, \"The transformation of Beyoncé from well-liked pop star to cultural icon came in three phases, punctuated by the self-titled Beyoncé album of 2013, 2016's Lemonade, and 2018's Homecoming concert at Coachella.\"[451] In The New Yorker, music critic Jody Rosen described Beyoncé as \"the most important and compelling popular musician of the twenty-first century ... the result, the logical end point, of a century-plus of pop.\"[452] She topped NPR list of the \"21st Century's Most Influential Women Musicians\".[453] James Clear, in his book Atomic Habits (2018), draws a parallel between Beyoncé's success and the dramatic transformations in modern society: \"In the last one hundred years, we have seen the rise of the car, the airplane, the television, the personal computer, the internet, the smartphone, and Beyoncé.\"[454] The Observer named her Artist of the Decade (2000s) in 2009.[455] Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Alex Suskind opined that Beyoncé was the decade's (2010s) defining pop star, stating \"no one dominated music in the 2010s like Queen Bey\", explaining that her \"songs, album rollouts, stage presence, social justice initiatives, and disruptive public relations strategy have influenced the way we've viewed music since 2010.\"[456] Based on Billboard rankings of chart success and sales, Beyonce was ranked 9th on the Top R&B and Hip Hop artists of the 2010s decade chart, behind the likes of Drake, Rihanna, Chris Brown, Nicki Minaj, Post Malone, The Weeknd, Kendrick Lamar and Lil Wayne in ranks 1 through 8, respectively.[457] British publication NME also shared similar thoughts on her impact in the 2010s, including Beyoncé on their list of the \"10 Artists Who Defined The Decade\".[458] In 2018, Rolling Stone included her on its Millennial 100 list.[459] Music critics have often credited Beyoncé with the invention of the staccato rap-singing style that has since dominated pop, R&B, and rap music. Lakin Starling of The Fader wrote that Beyoncé's innovative implementation of the delivery style on Destiny's Child's 1999 album The Writing's on the Wall invented a new form of R&B.[460] The staccato rap-singing style continued to be used in the music industry in the late 2010s and early 2020s; Aaron Williams of Uproxx described Beyoncé as the \"primary pioneer\" of the rapping style that dominates the music industry today, with many rappers implementing Beyoncé's rap-singing.[461] Michael Eric Dyson agrees, saying in 2019 that Beyoncé \"changed the whole genre\" and has become the \"godmother\" of mumble rappers, who use the staccato rap-singing cadence. Dyson added: \"She doesn't get credit for the remarkable way in which she changed the musical vocabulary of contemporary art.\"[462] Beyoncé has been credited with reviving the album as an art form in an era dominated by singles and streaming. This started with her 2011 album 4; while mainstream R&B artists were forgoing albums-led R&B in favor of singles-led EDM, Beyoncé aimed to place the focus back on albums as an art form and re-establish R&B as a mainstream concern.[463] This remained a focus of Beyoncé's, and in 2013, she made her eponymous album only available to purchase as a full album on iTunes, rather than being able to purchase individual tracks or consume the album via streaming. Kaitlin Menza of Marie Claire wrote that this made listeners \"experience the album as one whole sonic experience, the way people used to, noting the musical and lyrical themes\".[464] Jamieson Cox for The Verge described how Beyoncé's 2013 album initiated a gradual trend of albums becoming more cohesive and self-referential, and this phenomenon reached its endpoint with Lemonade, which set \"a new standard for pop storytelling at the highest possible scale\".[465] Megan Carpentier of The Guardian wrote that with Lemonade, Beyoncé has \"almost revived the album format\" by releasing an album that can only be listened to in its entirety.[466] Myf Warhurst on Double J's \"Lunch With Myf\" explained that while most artists' albums consist of a few singles plus filler songs, Beyoncé \"brought the album back\", changing the art form of the album \"to a narrative with an arc and a story and you have to listen to the entire thing to get the concept\".[467] She is known for coining popular phrases such as \"put a ring on it\", a euphemism for marriage proposal, \"I woke up like this\", which started a trend of posting morning selfies with the hashtag #iwokeuplikethis, and \"boy, bye\", which was used as part of the Democratic National Committee's campaign for the 2020 election.[468][469] Similarly, she also came up with the phrase \"visual album\" following the release of her fifth studio album, which had a video for every song. This has been recreated by many other artists since, such as Frank Ocean and Melanie Martinez.[470] The album also popularized surprise releases, with many artists releasing songs, videos or albums with no prior announcement, such as Taylor Swift, Nicki Minaj, Eminem, Frank Ocean, Jay-Z and Drake.[471] In January 2012, research scientist Bryan Lessard named Scaptia beyonceae, a species of horse-fly found in Northern Queensland, Australia after Beyoncé due to the fly's unique golden hairs on its abdomen.[472] Beyoncé has received numerous awards and is the most-awarded female artist of all time.[473] Having sold over 200 million records worldwide (a further 60 million additionally with Destiny's Child), Beyoncé is one of the best-selling music artists of all time.[474] The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) listed Beyoncé as the top certified artist of the 2000s decade, with a total of 64 certifications.[475][476] In 2009, Billboard named her the Top Female Artist and Top Radio Songs Artist of the Decade.[477][478][479] In 2010, Billboard named her in their Top 50 R&B/Hip-Hop Artists of the Past 25 Years list at number 15.[480] In 2012, VH1 ranked her third on their list of the \"100 Greatest Women in Music\", behind Mariah Carey and Madonna.[481] In 2002, she received Songwriter of the Year from American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers becoming the First African American woman to win the award. In 2004 and 2019, she received NAACP Image Award for Entertainer of the Year and the Soul Train Music Award for Sammy Davis Jr. – Entertainer of the Year. In 2005, she also received APEX Award at the Trumpet Award honoring the achievements of Black African Americans. In 2007, Beyoncé received the International Artist of Excellence award by the American Music Awards. She also received Honorary Otto at the Bravo Otto. The following year, she received the Legend Award for Outstanding Contribution to the Arts at the World Music Awards[482] and Career Achievement Award at the LOS40 Music Awards. In 2010, she received the Award of Honor for Artist of the Decade at the NRJ Music Award.[483] At the 2011 Billboard Music Awards, Beyoncé received the inaugural Billboard Millennium Award.[484] Beyoncé received the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award at the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards and was honored as Honorary Mother of the Year at the Australian Mother of the Year Award in Barnardo's Australia for her Humanitarian Effort in the region and the Council of Fashion Designers of America Fashion Icon Award in 2016. In 2019, alongside Jay-Z, she received GLAAD Vanguard Award which is presented to a member of the entertainment community who does not identify as LGBT but who has made a significant difference in promoting equal rights for LGBT people.[485] In 2020, she was awarded the BET Humanitarian Award. Consequence named her the 30th best singer of all time.[486] Beyoncé has won 32 Grammy Awards, both as a solo artist and member of Destiny's Child and The Carters, making her the most honored individual by the Grammys.[487][488] She is also the most nominated artist in Grammy Award history with a total of 88 nominations.[489] \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\" won Song of the Year in 2010 while \"Say My Name\",[47] \"Crazy in Love\" and \"Drunk in Love\" have each won Best R&B Song. Dangerously in Love, B'Day and I Am... Sasha Fierce have won Best Contemporary R&B Album, while Lemonade has won Best Urban Contemporary Album. Beyoncé set the record for the most Grammy awards won by a female artist in one night in 2010 when she won six awards, breaking the tie she previously held with Alicia Keys, Norah Jones, Alison Krauss, and Amy Winehouse, with Adele equaling this in 2012.[490] Beyoncé has won 30 MTV Video Music Awards, making her the joint most-decorated artist in Video Music Award history.[491] She won 26 awards as a solo artist, two awards each with The Carters and Destiny's Child, making her lifetime total of 30 VMAs.[492] \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\" and \"Formation\" won Video of the Year in 2009 and 2016 respectively. Beyoncé tied the record set by Lady Gaga in 2010 for the most VMAs won in one night for a female artist with eight in 2016.[188] She is also the most-awarded and nominated artist in BET Award history,[493] winning 36 awards (including two with Destiny's Child) from over 80 nominations,[494] the most-awarded artist of the Soul Train Music Awards with 25 wins (21 as a soloist and four with Destiny's child),[495] and the most-decorated artist at the NAACP Image Awards with 25 wins as a solo artist and five with Destiny's Child.[496][497] Following her role in Dreamgirls, Beyoncé was nominated for Best Original Song for \"Listen\" and Best Actress at the Golden Globe Awards,[498] and Outstanding Actress in a Motion Picture at the NAACP Image Awards.[499] Beyoncé won two awards at the Broadcast Film Critics Association Awards 2006; Best Song for \"Listen\" and Best Original Soundtrack for Dreamgirls: Music from the Motion Picture.[500] According to Fuse in 2014, Beyoncé is the second-most award-winning artist of all time, after Michael Jackson.[501][502] Lemonade won a Peabody Award in 2017.[503] In 2022, \"Be Alive\" was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song,[504] the Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Song,[505] and the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song.[506] She was named on the 2016 BBC Radio 4 Woman's Hour Power List as one of seven women judged to have had the biggest impact on women's lives over the past 70 years, alongside Margaret Thatcher, Barbara Castle, Helen Brook, Germaine Greer, Jayaben Desai and Bridget Jones,[507] She was named the Most Powerful Woman in Music on the same list in 2020.[508] In the same year, Billboard named her with Destiny's Child the third Greatest Music Video artists of all time, behind Madonna and Michael Jackson.[509] In June 2021, Beyoncé won the award of \"top touring artist\" of the decade (2010s) at the Pollstar Awards.[510] In that same month, Beyoncé was inducted into the Black Music & Entertainment Walk of Fame as a member of the inaugural class.[511] In 2010, Beyoncé founded her own entertainment company Parkwood Entertainment which formed as an imprint based from Columbia Records, the company began as a production unit for videos and films in 2008. Parkwood Entertainment is named after a street in Houston, Texas where Beyoncé once lived.[512] With headquarters in New York City, the company serves as an umbrella for the entertainer's various brands in music, movies, videos, and fashion. The staff of Parkwood Entertainment have experiences in arts and entertainment, from filmmaking and video production to web and fashion design. In addition to departments in marketing, digital, creative, publicity, fashion design and merchandising, the company houses a state-of-the-art editing suite, where Beyoncé works on content for her worldwide tours, music videos, and television specials. Parkwood Entertainment's first production was the musical biopic Cadillac Records (2008), in which Beyoncé starred and co-produced.[513] The company has distributed Beyoncé's albums such as her self-titled fifth studio album (2013), Lemonade (2016) and The Carters, Everything is Love (2018). Beyoncé has signed other artists to Parkwood such as Chloe x Halle, who performed at Super Bowl LIII in February 2019.[514] In February 2024, Beyoncé launched Cécred, a hair care product line developed to fit different hair textures.[255] Following its launch, she established an annual grant in collaboration with BeyGood. This is an effort to provide financial support to cosmetology students and professional hair stylists within the beauty industry.[515] A yearly $500,000 is funding cosmetology school scholarships and salon business grants across five cities chosen for their large, diverse community of hair stylists: Atlanta, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles and Clementon.[c][516] Beyoncé has worked with Pepsi since 2002,[517] and in 2004 appeared in a Gladiator-themed commercial with Britney Spears, Pink, and Enrique Iglesias.[518] In 2012, Beyoncé signed a $50 million deal to endorse Pepsi.[519] The Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPINET) wrote Beyoncé an open letter asking her to reconsider the deal because of the unhealthiness of the product and to donate the proceeds to a medical organisation.[520] Nevertheless, NetBase found that Beyoncé's campaign was the most talked about endorsement in April 2013, with a 70 percent positive audience response to the commercial and print ads.[521] Beyoncé has worked with Tommy Hilfiger for the fragrances True Star (singing a cover version of \"Wishing on a Star\")[522] and True Star Gold;[523] she also promoted Emporio Armani's Diamonds fragrance in 2007.[524] Beyoncé launched her first official fragrance, Heat, in 2010.[525] In February 2011, Beyoncé launched her second fragrance, Heat Rush.[526] Beyoncé's third fragrance, Pulse, was launched in September 2011.[527] In 2013, The Mrs. Carter Show Limited Edition version of Heat was released.[528] The six editions of Heat are the world's best-selling celebrity fragrance line,[528] with sales of over $400 million.[529] The release of a video-game Starpower: Beyoncé was cancelled after Beyoncé pulled out of a $100 million deal with GateFive who alleged the cancellation meant the sacking of 70 staff and millions of pounds lost in development.[530] It was settled out of court by her lawyers in June 2013 who said that they had cancelled because GateFive had lost its financial backers.[531] Beyoncé also has had deals with American Express,[432] Nintendo DS[532] and L'Oréal since the age of 18.[533] In March 2015, Beyoncé became a co-owner, with other artists, of the music streaming service Tidal. The service specializes in lossless audio and high definition music videos. Beyoncé's husband Jay-Z acquired the parent company of Tidal, Aspiro, in the first quarter of 2015.[534] Including Beyoncé and Jay-Z, sixteen artist stakeholders (such as Kanye West, Rihanna, Madonna, Chris Martin, Nicki Minaj and more) co-own Tidal, with the majority owning a 3% equity stake.[535] The idea of having an all artist owned streaming service was created by those involved to adapt to the increased demand for streaming within the current music industry.[536] In November 2020, Beyoncé formed a multi-year partnership with exercise equipment and media company Peloton. The partnership was formed to celebrate homecoming season in historically black colleges and universities, providing themed workout experiences inspired by Beyoncé's 2019 Homecoming film and live album after 2020's homecoming celebrations were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of the partnership, Beyoncé and Peloton are donating free memberships to all students at 10 HBCUs, and Peloton are pursuing long-term recruiting partnerships at the HCBUs. Gwen Bethel Riley, head of music at Peloton, said: \"When we had conversations with Beyoncé around how critical a social impact component was to all of us, it crystallized how important it was to embrace Homecoming as an opportunity to celebrate and create dialogue around Black culture and music, in partnership with HBCUs.\"[537] Upon news of the partnership, a decline in Peloton's shares reversed, and its shares rose by 8.6%.[538] In 2021, Beyoncé and Jay-Z partnered with Tiffany & Co. for the company's \"About Love\" campaign. Beyoncé became the fourth woman, and first Black woman, to wear the 128.54-carat Tiffany Yellow Diamond.[539] The campaign featured a robin egg blue painting by Jean-Michel Basquiat titled Equals Pi (1982).[540] Both Beyonce and the brand faced significant backlash for the campaign, as the Tiffany Yellow Diamond, which was discovered in the Kimberley diamond mines in South Africa in 1877, is classified as a blood diamond and viewed as a symbol of British colonialism over Africa.[541][542][543] Beyoncé and her mother introduced House of Deréon, a women's fashion line, in 2005.[544] The concept is inspired by three generations of women in their family, with the name paying tribute to Beyoncé's grandmother, Agnèz Deréon, a respected seamstress.[545][546] According to Tina, the overall style of the line best reflects her and Beyoncé's taste and style. Beyoncé and her mother founded their family's company Beyond Productions, which provides the licensing and brand management for House of Deréon, and its junior collection, Deréon.[544] House of Deréon pieces were exhibited in Destiny's Child's shows and tours, during their Destiny Fulfilled era.[547][548] The collection features sportswear, denim offerings with fur, outerwear and accessories that include handbags and footwear, and are available at department and specialty stores across the U.S. and Canada.[544] In 2005, Beyoncé teamed up with House of Brands, a shoe company, to produce a range of footwear for House of Deréon.[549] In January 2008, Starwave Mobile launched Beyoncé Fashion Diva, a \"high-style\" mobile game with a social networking component, featuring the House of Deréon collection.[544] In July 2009, Beyoncé and her mother launched a new junior apparel label, Sasha Fierce for Deréon, for back-to-school selling. The collection included sportswear, outerwear, handbags, footwear, eyewear, lingerie and jewelry.[550] It was available at department stores including Macy's and Dillard's, and specialty stores Jimmy Jazz and Against All Odds.[550] In May 2010, Beyoncé teamed up with clothing store C&A to launch Deréon by Beyoncé at their stores in Brazil.[551] The collection included tailored blazers with padded shoulders, little black dresses, embroidered tops and shirts and bandage dresses.[551] In October 2014, Beyoncé signed a deal to launch an activewear line of clothing with British fashion retailer Topshop.[552][553] The 50–50 venture is called Ivy Park and was launched in April 2016. The brand's name is a nod to Beyoncé's daughter and her favorite number four (IV in Roman numerals), and also references the park where she used to run in Texas.[554] She has since bought out Topshop owner Philip Green from his 50% share after he was alleged to have sexually harassed, bullied and racially abused employees.[555] She now owns the brand herself.[556] In April 2019, it was announced that Beyoncé would become a creative partner with Adidas and further develop her athletic brand Ivy Park with the company. Knowles will also develop new clothes and footwear for Adidas. Shares for the company rose 1.3% upon the news release.[557] In December 2019, they announced a launch date of January 18, 2020.[558] Beyoncé uploaded a teaser on her website and Instagram.[559] The collection was previewed on the upcoming Elle January 2020 issue, where Beyoncé is seen wearing several garments, accessories and footwear from the first collection.[560] In February 2023, The Wall Street Journal reported that the line was struggling financially with revenue falling by more than 50% over the past fiscal year to $40 million; well short of the company's $250 million projected forecast.[561] In March 2023, it was announced that Beyoncé and Adidas reached a mutual decision to end their partnership.[562][563] In March 2023, Olivier Rousteing, the creative director of Balmain, announced that he and Beyoncé collaborated on a couture collection complete with sixteen looks corresponding to the sixteen tracks on her album Renaissance. This \"Renaissance Couture\" collection marked the first time that a Black woman oversaw the development of a collection from a Parisian couture house.[564] In September 2024, Beyoncé partnered with Levi Strauss & Co. to remake a classic '80s 'Launderette' campaign.[565] Michelle Gass, the CEO of Levis Strauss & Co., shared insights regarding the advantages of the company's collaboration with Beyoncé, emphasizing that the advertising campaign could significantly enhance sales in the women's clothing segment.[566] In 2002, Beyoncé, Kelly Rowland and Tina Knowles built the Knowles-Rowland Center for Youth, a community center in Downtown Houston. After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Beyoncé and Rowland founded the Survivor Foundation to provide transitional housing to displaced families and provide means for new building construction, to which Beyoncé contributed an initial $250,000.[567] The foundation has since expanded to work with other charities in the city,[568] and also provided relief following Hurricane Ike three years later.[569] Beyoncé also donated $100,000 to the Gulf Coast Ike Relief Fund.[570] In 2007, Beyoncé founded the Knowles-Temenos Place Apartments, a housing complex offering living space for 43 displaced individuals. As of 2016, Beyoncé had donated $7 million for the maintenance of the complex.[571] After starring in Cadillac Records in 2009 and learning about Phoenix House, a non-profit drug and alcohol rehabilitation organization, Beyoncé donated her full $4 million salary from the film to the organization. Beyoncé and her mother subsequently established the Beyoncé Cosmetology Center, which offers a seven-month cosmetology training course helping Phoenix House's clients gain career skills during their recovery.[572] In January 2010, Beyoncé participated in George Clooney and Wyclef Jean's Hope for Haiti Now: A Global Benefit for Earthquake Relief telethon,[573] donated a large sum to the organization,[574] and was named the official face of the limited edition Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) \"Fashion For Haiti\" T-shirt.[575] In April 2011, Beyoncé joined forces with U.S. First Lady Michelle Obama and the National Association of Broadcasters Education Foundation, to help boost the latter's campaign against child obesity[576] by reworking her single \"Get Me Bodied\".[577] Following the death of Osama bin Laden, Beyoncé released her cover of the Lee Greenwood song \"God Bless the U.S.A.\", as a charity single to help raise funds for the New York Police and Fire Widows' and Children's Benefit Fund.[578] Beyoncé became an ambassador for the 2012 World Humanitarian Day campaign donating her song \"I Was Here\" and its music video, shot in the UN, to the campaign.[579][580] In 2013, it was announced that Beyoncé would work with Salma Hayek and Frida Giannini on a Gucci \"Chime for Change\" campaign that aims to spread female empowerment. The campaign, which aired on February 28, was set to her new music.[581] A concert for the cause took place on June 1, 2013, in London.[582] With help of the crowdfunding platform Catapult, visitors of the concert could choose between several projects promoting education of women and girls.[583][584] Beyoncé also took part in \"Miss a Meal\", a food-donation campaign,[585] and supported Goodwill Industries through online charity auctions at Charitybuzz that support job creation throughout Europe and the U.S.[586][587] Beyoncé and Jay-Z secretly donated tens of thousands of dollars to bail out Black Lives Matter protesters in Baltimore and Ferguson, as well as funded infrastructure for the establishment of Black Lives Matter chapters across the U.S.[588] Before Beyoncé's Formation World Tour show in Tampa, her team held a private luncheon for more than 20 community leaders to discuss how Beyoncé could support local charitable initiatives, including pledging on the spot to fund 10 scholarships to provide students with financial aid. Tampa Sports Authority board member Thomas Scott said: \"I don't know of a prior artist meeting with the community, seeing what their needs are, seeing how they can invest in the community. It says a lot to me about Beyoncé. She not only goes into a community and walks away with (money), but she also gives money back to that community.\"[589] In June 2016, Beyoncé donated over $82,000 to the United Way of Genesee County to support victims of the Flint water crisis. Beyoncé additionally donated money to support 14 students in Michigan with their college expenses.[590] In August 2016, Beyoncé and Jay-Z donated $1.5 million to civil rights groups including Black Lives Matter, Hands Up United and Dream Defenders.[591] After Hurricane Matthew, Beyoncé and Jay-Z donated $15 million to the Usain Bolt Foundation to support its efforts in rebuilding homes in Haiti.[592] During Hurricane Harvey in August 2017, Beyoncé launched BeyGOOD Houston to support those affected by the hurricane in Houston. The organization donated necessities such as cots, blankets, pillows, baby products, feminine products and wheelchairs, and funded long-term revitalization projects.[593] On September 8, Beyoncé visited Houston, where she sponsored a lunch for 400 survivors at her local church, visited the George R Brown Convention Center to discuss with people displaced by the flooding about their needs, served meals to those who lost their homes, and made a significant donation to local causes.[594][595] Beyoncé additionally donated $75,000 worth of new mattresses to survivors of the hurricane.[596] Later that month, Beyoncé released a remix of J Balvin and Willy William's \"Mi Gente\", with all of her proceeds being donated to disaster relief charities in Puerto Rico, Mexico, the U.S. and the Caribbean after hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, and the Chiapas and Puebla earthquakes.[597] In April 2020, Beyoncé donated $6 million to the National Alliance in Mental Health, UCLA and local community-based organizations in order to provide mental health and personal wellness services to essential workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. BeyGOOD also teamed up with local organizations to help provide resources to communities of color, including food, water, cleaning supplies, medicines and face masks.[598] The same month Beyoncé released a remix of Megan Thee Stallion's \"Savage\", with all proceeds benefiting Bread of Life Houston's COVID-19 relief efforts, which includes providing over 14 tons of food and supplies to 500 families and 100 senior citizens in Houston weekly.[599] In May 2020, Beyoncé provided 1,000 free COVID-19 tests in Houston as part of her and her mother's #IDidMyPart initiative, which was established due to the disproportionate deaths in African-American communities. Additionally, 1,000 gloves, masks, hot meals, essential vitamins, grocery vouchers and household items were provided.[600] In July 2020, Beyoncé established the Black-Owned Small Business Impact Fund in partnership with the NAACP, which offers $10,000 grants to black-owned small businesses in need following the George Floyd protests.[601] All proceeds from Beyoncé's single \"Black Parade\" were donated to the fund.[602] In September 2020, Beyoncé announced that she had donated an additional $1 million to the fund.[603] As of December 31, 2020, the fund had given 715 grants to black-owned small businesses, amounting to $7.15 million donated.[604] In October 2020, Beyoncé released a statement that she has been working with the Feminist Coalition to assist supporters of the End SARS movement in Nigeria, including covering medical costs for injured protestors, covering legal fees for arrested protestors, and providing food, emergency shelter, transportation and telecommunication means to those in need.

                "content": "Beyoncé Giselle Knowles-Carter (bee-YON-say) (born September 4, 1981), known mononymously as Beyoncé, is an American singer, songwriter, record producer, actress, businesswoman, dancer and model. She is known as a lead singer of female R&B group Destiny's Child. She released her first solo album, Dangerously in Love, in 2003, when Destiny's Child was on a break. Since then, she has released six more albums, which have all produced hit singles. She has sold over 250 million records worldwide as a solo artist, and as the lead singer of the world's best-selling female group of all time, selling over 100 million records worldwide. She is the most awarded musicians in Grammys of all time, with 32 wins during her career, as well as her nominations.[6][7] Beyoncé Giselle Knowles was born at Park Plaza Hospital in Houston, Texas.[8] Her mother is Tina Knowles (née Beyincé; currently Lawson) and has Creole descent, which means she has some African and French roots. Her father is Mathew Knowles, who is African American. Knowles went to several performing arts schools, and took part in singing and dancing competitions as a child. Her younger sister, Solange, is also a musician. In her youth, she started the girl group Girls Tyme. Her father Mathew became her manager. Knowles became very famous in the late 1990s. She became the lead singer of the R&B girl group Destiny's Child. The group became the world's best-selling girl group of all time, selling over 85 million records worldwide. Destiny's Child took a break from recording music. Knowles released her solo debut album, Dangerously in Love, in 2003. Two singles from the album—\"Crazy in Love\" and \"Baby Boy\"—reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The album became one of the most successful albums of that year. Dangerously in Love was given five Grammy Awards. After Destiny's Child split, Knowles released her second album. B'Day was released in 2006, and its singles \"Déjà Vu\", \"Irreplaceable\" and \"Beautiful Liar\" reached the top ten in the United States. Her third album I Am... Sasha Fierce was released in 2008. \"If I Were a Boy\", \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\", \"Halo\" and \"Sweet Dreams\" became hit singles for Knowles. \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\" became another number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100. The album earned six Grammys in 2010, the most Grammys won by a woman in one night. Only Adele would do this again at the 2012 Grammys. Her next album, 4 (2011), became her fourth number one album on the Billboard 200 chart. She became the third artist in history to have her first four albums debut at number one. Beyoncé released her fifth album Beyoncé on iTunes on December 13, 2013. The public did not know about the album before it was released. The album has fourteen songs and 17 videos.[9] It has been given good reviews. It entered the Billboard 200 at number one. This made her the first female artist in the history of the chart to have her first five albums enter the chart at the top.[10] Knowles performed \"Drunk in Love\" with JAY-Z at the 2014 Grammy Awards. She was nominated for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration for \"Part II (On the Run)\" with JAY-Z.[11] In February 2016, Beyoncé was a guest performer at Super Bowl 50. She performed \"Formation\", the lead single from her sixth studio album, Lemonade. The performance was controversial, as it had elements of the #BlackLivesMatter movement along with influences from the Black Panthers.[12] She announced The Formation World Tour in a commercial after the Super Bowl performance. In April 2016, an hour-long film, Lemonade, was shown on HBO. After the film aired, the Lemonade album was released. The album became her best-reviewed of her career. It entered the charts at number one in the US and Canada. Lemonade features the singles \"Formation\", \"Sorry\", and \"Hold Up\". It won the Grammy Award for Best Urban Contemporary Album in 2017, while the music video for \"Formation\" won the award for Best Music Video. In 2017, Beyoncé released the promotional single \"Die with You\". She later contributed to the remix of \"Mi Gente\" by J Balvin and Willy William. This caused the song to jump to number three on the Billboard Hot 100. On December 1, 2017, an acoustic duet between Beyoncé and Ed Sheeran of Sheeran's song \"Perfect\" was released and was at the top of the iTunes charts in 32 countries.[13] The song became Beyoncé's sixth US number-one as a solo artist and her tenth number-one song in the US including songs with Destiny's Child. Knowles was featured on a remix of rapper Megan Thee Stallion's song \"Savage\"; it became Knowles’ seventh number-one song in the US.[14] On June 20, 2022, she released \"Break My Soul\", the lead single from her seventh studio album, Renaissance and the album was released on July 29, 2022. \"Break My Soul\" became her eighth solo US number-one (twelfth overall), while the album's next single, \"Cuff It\", reached number ten on the Hot 100.[15] Knowles has a three octave mezzo-soprano vocal range. Other sources state that she possesses a contralto vocal range at age of 30s. Jon Pareles of The New York Times commented that her voice is \"velvety yet tart, with an insistent flutter and reserves of soul belting\". Jody Rosen notes that the hip hop era highly influenced Knowles' unique rhythmic vocal style, but also finds her quite traditionalist in her use of balladry, gospel and falsetto. Her first role in a movie was for the musical Carmen: A Hip Hopera (2001). Her first major movie was Austin Powers in Goldmember (2002). The movie Dreamgirls (2006) was nominated for two Golden Globe Awards. Her other movies Cadillac Records (2008) and Obsessed (2009) did not do so well. In 2019, she starred as Nala in the 2019 drama-live action remake The Lion King. In 2005, Knowles and her mother created a fashion line called House of Deréon. In 2016, she also introduced a fitness-wear collection called Ivy Park.[16] In 2010, she released her first perfume which she called Heat. In 2013, Knowles became H&M's new swimwear model since she gave birth to her daughter Blue Ivy just a year prior. She became a spokesperson for L'Oréal, Pepsi, Tommy Hilfiger, Nintendo, and Vizio. In 2010, Knowles was ranked first on Forbes list of the \"100 Most Powerful and Influential Musicians in the World\",[17] and second on its list of the \"100 Most Powerful and Influential Celebrities in the World\".[18] In 2012, she was named \"World's Most Beautiful Woman\" by People magazine.[19] Many of Knowles' recordings and movies were given many nominations, with many winning them. These include 32 Grammy Awards, 24 [MTV Video Music Awards], three [American Music Awards], a Billboard Millennium Award, and a star on the [Hollywood Walk of Fame] with Destiny's Child. In 2009, [Billboard (magazine)|Billboard] named her the Top Radio Songs Artist of the 2000s decade. They also ranked her 4th for Artist of the Decade.[20][21] The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), named Knowles as the Top Certified Artist of the 2000s.[22][23] In the US, she has sold over 17 million copies as of May 2014. She has sold more than 30.4 million digital singles as of January 2012.[24] Worldwide, she has sold 245 million records. This makes her one of the best-selling music artists of all time.[25] Knowles appeared on [VH1]'s 2010 list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\".[26] They ranked her third on their \"100 Greatest Women in Music\" list in 2012. In 2000, Knowles met Jay-Z and proposed her on his 38th birthday on December 4, 2007. The couple married on April 4, 2008. On January 7, 2012, she gave birth to their first daughter, Blue Ivy Carter, via natural birth in Lennox Hill Hospital, New York. Knowles is a feminist. In the February 2013 issue of GQ magazine she said, \"You know, equality is a myth, and for some reason, everyone accepts the fact that women don’t make as much money as men do. I don’t understand that. Why do we have to take a backseat? I truly believe that women should be financially independent from their men. And let’s face it, money gives men the power to run the show. It gives men the power to define value. They define what’s sexy. And men define what’s feminine. It’s ridiculous.\"[27] Knowles joined the Ban Bossy campaign in 2014.[28] In December 2013, it was revealed that she and her husband Jay-Z were longtime vegans.[29] She wrote the foreword to the book The 22-Day Revolution by trainer Marco Borges, which was released in April 2015.[30] On February 1, 2017, Knowles announced via Instagram that she was expecting twins.[31] She gave birth to a daughter, Rumi and a son, Sir on June 13, 2017 via cesarean section.[32][33]",

                "content": "Our editors will review what you’ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article. Beyoncé and her husband, JAY-Z (Shawn Carter), have three children. Their eldest daughter was born in 2012 and is named Blue Ivy. Their twins, a boy and a girl, were born in 2017 and are named Sir and Rumi, respectively. Beyoncé achieved fame in the late 1990s as the lead singer of the R&B group Destiny’s Child and then launched a hugely successful solo career. Her hit solo albums included Dangerously in Love (2003), B’Day (2006), I Am…Sasha Fierce (2008), 4 (2011), Beyoncé (2013), and Lemonade (2016). By 2019 Beyoncé had won 23 Grammy Awards and was the most-nominated female artist in Grammy history, with 62 nominations. She first won the award as a member of the R&B group Destiny’s Child in 2000. Beyoncé (born September 4, 1981, Houston, Texas, U.S.) is an American singer-songwriter and actress who achieved fame in the late 1990s as the lead singer of the R&B group Destiny’s Child and then launched a hugely successful solo career. In 2023 she broke the record for most Grammy Awards won by an artist, with 32 Grammy wins over the course of her career. Beyoncé was born Beyoncé Giselle Knowles to Tina (née Beyoncé) and Mathew Knowles (divorced 2011). She has a younger sister, Solange, who also became a successful recording artist. At age nine Beyoncé formed the singing-rapping girl group Destiny’s Child (originally called Girl’s Tyme) in 1990 with childhood friends. In 1992 the group lost on the Star Search television talent show, and three years later it was dropped from a recording contract before an album had been released. In 1997 Destiny’s Child’s fortunes reversed with a Columbia recording contract and then an eponymous debut album that yielded the hit single “No, No, No Part 2.” Its follow-up album, The Writing’s on the Wall (1999), earned the group two Grammy Awards and sold more than eight million copies in the United States. Survivor (2001), the group’s third album, reached the number one spot on the Billboard 200 chart. By this time the group’s lineup, which had seen several personnel changes, was composed of Beyoncé, Kelly Rowland, and Michelle Williams. With her powerful voice and charisma, Beyoncé was clearly the leader of the group and wrote hit songs for Destiny’s Child, such as the saucy “Bootylicious.” Eventually, the group parted ways to pursue individual projects. Beyoncé used her songwriting talents to pen her first solo album, Dangerously in Love (2003). The album debuted to rave reviews, and, aided by the exuberant single “Crazy in Love,” which features rapper Jay-Z, it topped charts around the world. In 2004 Beyoncé won five Grammy Awards, including best contemporary R&B album and best female R&B vocal performance. Destiny’s Child reunited in 2004 to release Destiny Fulfilled. While generally not as acclaimed as the group’s previous efforts, the album sold more than seven million copies worldwide and spawned several hit singles. The trio embarked on a world tour in 2005, during which they announced that the group would officially disband. That same year they released #1’s, a collection of well-known songs and number one hits. In 2006 Beyoncé released her second solo studio album, B’Day, which features several coproducers, including the hit-making duo the Neptunes. Although much of the album carried echoes of 1970s-style funk, the pop ballad “Irreplaceable” became its most successful single. In 2008 she and Jay-Z married, and the union made them one of the top-earning couples in the entertainment industry. Later that year Beyoncé released the double album I Am…Sasha Fierce. Whereas the first half (I Am) captures an introspective mood, the second (Sasha Fierce) contains songs better suited to the dance floor. The album as a whole generated several hits, including the assertive “Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It),” and it contributed to Beyoncé’s dominance of the 2010 Grammy Awards. Her six awards, which included those for song of the year, best female pop vocal performance, and best contemporary R&B album, amounted to the most Grammys collected by a female artist in a single night. (The record was matched by pop singer Adele in 2012.) Days after a triumphant headlining performance at England’s Glastonbury Festival, Beyoncé released 4 (2011), a genre-bending mix of ballads and dance tracks that evokes influences ranging from Motown-era torch songs to the audio collages of rapper M.I.A. In early 2013 Destiny’s Child reunited for a halftime appearance at the Super Bowl and released a new song, “Nuclear.” Shortly thereafter Beyoncé collected a Grammy for her single “Love on Top.” She returned later in the year with the confidently sensuous and expressive Beyoncé, which boasts brand-name producers and appearances from, among others, the Nigerian author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie and the singer’s toddler daughter, Blue Ivy. The record, initially offered exclusively on iTunes, was promoted as a “visual album,” with music videos made to accompany each track. The single “Drunk in Love,” which features Jay-Z, was awarded several Grammys, including best R&B song. On the expansive and musically variegated Lemonade (2016), Beyoncé focused on themes of betrayal and perseverance. Conceived as another visual album, it debuted as an HBO television special. Lemonade attracted considerable acclaim, and it netted Beyoncé two Grammys, including a best music-video award for the anthemic “Formation.” In 2018 Beyoncé and Jay-Z released a collaborative album, Everything Is Love, credited to the Carters, and it took the Grammy for best urban contemporary album. That same year Beyoncé became the first Black woman to headline the Coachella Valley Festival in Indio, California. Her highly acclaimed performance, which featured marching bands from historically Black colleges, was the subject of Homecoming, a Netflix documentary and live album released in 2019. Although Beyoncé worked on a number of projects between studio albums, fans were left waiting for a new solo album. In 2022 she finally delivered with act i: RENAISSANCE. It received four Grammys, including best dance/electronic music album, and with those awards, Beyoncé surpassed classical music conductor Georg Solti for the most Grammy wins (32). Her world concert tour in 2023 broke the record, previously held by Madonna, for the highest grossing concert tour by a female artist. It also broke the record for the highest grossing tour of all time, until it was surpassed by Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour, which began in 2023. In February 2024 Beyoncé appeared in a commercial during the Super Bowl telecast to announce that she was releasing new music. Immediately after the game, she dropped two singles, “Texas Hold ’Em” and “16 Carriages,” on the music streaming service Tidal. Both songs feature a country music sound, leading her fans to guess that her new album, which she teased right after the Super Bowl on her Instagram page, would be a country album. The following month she revealed the album’s name, Cowboy Carter, confirming her fans’ guess. In the meantime, “Texas Hold ’Em” went to number one on the Billboard country chart, marking the first time in history that a Black woman had topped that chart. It was not her first foray into country music; in 2016 she performed her song “Daddy Lessons” with the Dixie Chicks (now known as the Chicks) at the Country Music Awards. In another Instagram post, Beyoncé revealed that the backlash she received after that performance spurred her to “dive into the history of Country music” as a future project. She also asserted, “This ain’t a Country album. This is a ‘Beyoncé album.’ ” The album’s release in late March prompted a long-overdue discourse about the African American roots of country music. Cowboy Carter’s impressive roster of guest artists includes singers Miley Cyrus and Linda Martell, folk musician Rhiannon Giddens, and singer-songwriters Dolly Parton and Willie Nelson. Parton’s classic song “Jolene” is reimagined with new lyrics by Beyoncé, and country singer Tanner Adell is among several vocalists who join in on a cover of the Beatles’ “Blackbird.” In 2001 Beyoncé made her acting debut in the television movie Carmen: A Hip Hopera, which aired on MTV. Her role as Foxxy Cleopatra in Austin Powers in Goldmember (2002) made her a film star and led to parts in The Fighting Temptations (2003) and The Pink Panther (2006). In 2006 she played Deena Jones in Dreamgirls, the film adaptation of the 1981 Broadway musical about a 1960s singing group. Beyoncé’s performance was nominated for a Golden Globe Award and her song “Listen” for an Academy Award. She later starred in Cadillac Records (2008), in which she portrayed singer Etta James, and the thriller Obsessed (2009) before providing the voice of a fairylike forest queen in the animated Epic (2013). For the 2019 remake of Disney’s The Lion King, Beyoncé voiced the character of Nala and performed several songs on the soundtrack, including “Spirit,” an original song she cowrote, and a rendition of “Can You Feel the Love Tonight.” She also concurrently released an album inspired by the movie, The Lion King: The Gift. Songs from that record were later featured in the visual album Black Is King (2020), which aired on the streaming service Disney+. For the single “Black Parade,” Beyoncé earned the Grammy for best R&B performance in 2021. That year she received three other awards to set the record for most Grammys (28) won by a female artist, surpassing bluegrass musician and singer Alison Krauss. Beyoncé later cowrote and performed “Be Alive” for the film King Richard (2021), and it received an Oscar nomination for best original song.",

            {
                "title": "Nosferatu (word) - Wikipedia",
                "content": "\"Nosferatu\" has been presented as an archaic Romanian word[1] synonymous with \"vampire\". It was largely popularized in the late 19th and early 20th centuries by Western fiction such as the gothic novel Dracula (1897) and the German expressionist film Nosferatu (1922). One of the suggested etymologies of the term is that it is derived from the Romanian Nesuferitu (\"the offensive one\" or \"the insufferable one\"). The etymology of the word nosferatu is undetermined. There is no doubt that it achieved currency through Bram Stoker's 1897 novel Dracula and its unauthorised first cinematic adaptation, Nosferatu (1922). Stoker identified his source for the term as 19th-century British author and speaker Emily Gerard. It is commonly thought that Gerard introduced the word into print in an 1885 magazine article, \"Transylvanian Superstitions\",[2] and in her travelogue The Land Beyond the Forest[3] (\"Transylvania\" is Latin for \"[the land] across/beyond the forest\"). She merely refers to \"Nosferatu\" as the Romanian word for vampire:[4] More decidedly evil, however, is the vampire, or nosferatu, in which every Romanian peasant believes as firmly as he does in heaven or hell. There are two sorts of vampires-—living and dead. The living vampire is in general the illegitimate offspring of two illegitimate persons, but even a flawless pedigree will not ensure anyone against the intrusion of a vampire into his family vault, since every person killed by a nosferatu becomes likewise a vampire after death, and will continue to suck the blood of other innocent people till the spirit has been exorcised, either by opening the grave of the person suspected and driving a stake through the corpse, or firing a pistol shot into the coffin. In very obstinate cases it is further recommended to cut off the head and replace it in the coffin with the mouth filled with garlic, or to extract the heart and burn it, strewing the ashes over the grave.[2] However, the word had already appeared in an 1865 German-language article by Wilhelm Schmidt.[5] Schmidt's article discusses Transylvanian customs and appeared in an Austro-Hungarian magazine, which Gerard could have encountered as a reviewer of German literature living in Austria-Hungary. Schmidt's article also mentions the legendary Scholomance by name, which parallels Gerard's \"Transylvanian Superstitions\".[2] Schmidt does not identify the language explicitly, but he puts the word nosferatu in a typeface which indicates it to be a language other than German. Schmidt's description is unambiguous in identifying nosferatu as a \"Vampyr\". At this point, I come to the vampire – nosferatu. It is this, the illegitimate offspring of two illegitimately begotten people or the unfortunate spirit of one killed by a vampire, who can appear in the form of dog, cat, toad, frog, louse, flea, bug, in any form, in short, and plays his evil tricks on newly engaged couples as incubus or succubus – zburatorul – by name, just like the Old Slavonic or Bohemian Blkodlak [sic], Vukodlak or Polish Mora and Russian Kikimora. That which was believed about this and used as a defense[6] more than 100 years ago is still true today, and there can hardly dare to be a village which would not be in a position to present a personal experience or at least hearsay with firm conviction of the veracity.[7] Schmidt expanded on his 1865 article in an 1866 monograph, adding the observation that the vampire was the \"uncanniest spawn of national-slavic fantasy\" and that his description was the Romanian perception.[8] However, nosferatu in that form does not appear to be a standard word in any known historical phase of Romanian (aside from that introduced by the novel and the films).[9] Internal evidence in Dracula suggests that Stoker believed the term meant \"not dead\" in Romanian, and thus he may have intended the word undead to be its calque.[10] Peter Haining identifies an earlier source for nosferatu as Roumanian Superstitions (1861) by Heinrich von Wlislocki.[11] However, Wlislocki seems only to have written in German, and according to the Magyar Néprajzi Lexikon, Wlislocki was born in 1856 (d. 1907), which makes his authorship of an English-titled 1861 source doubtful. Certain details of Haining's citation also conflict with David J. Skal,[9] so this citation seems unreliable. Skal identifies a similar reference to the word \"nosferat\" in an article by Wlislocki dating from 1896.[12] Since this postdates Gerard and has a number of parallels to Gerard's work, Skal considers it likely that Wlislocki is derivative from Gerard. There is also evidence to suggest that Haining derived his citation for Roumanian Superstitions from a confused reading of an extract in Ernest Jones's book, On the Nightmare (1931).[13] Wlislocki's later description of \"der Nosferat\" is more extensive than either Schmidt's or Gerard's. The former two German-language sources particularly emphasize the dual role of the creature as both blood-drinker and incubus/succubus. Wlislocki's nosferat is said to drink the blood of older people, while seeking to have sexual intercourse with young people and especially newlyweds, often being blamed for illegitimate children (who become moroi), impotence, and infertility. From the description by Wlislocki, who was a half-Saxon native of Kronstadt (Hungarian Brassó, Romanian Brașov, one of Saxon Transylvania's \"seven cities\"), it is difficult not to get the impression that both the term and the idea must have been quite well known in his community, which makes the inability to confirm its existence in Romanian literature rather puzzling. One proposed etymology of nosferatu is that the term originally came from the Greek nosophoros (Greek: νοσοφόρος), meaning \"disease-bearing\".[14] F. W. Murnau's film Nosferatu (1922) strongly emphasizes this theme of disease, and Murnau's creative direction in the film may have been influenced by this etymology (or vice versa).[15] There are several difficulties with this etymology. Schmidt, Gerard, and Wlislocki, all three sometime residents of Transylvania, identified the word as Romanian, and even proponents of the \"nosophoros\" etymology (as well as most other commentators) seem to have little doubt that this is correct; Wlislocki particularly was regarded as an expert in Transylvanian languages and folklore and was a prolific author on the subjects. Curiously, in Wlislocki's 1896 article, he presents a parenthetical analysis of the related Romanian term solomonar but has nothing to say regarding the origin and connections of the term nosferat, despite having normalized the spelling of both relative to Schmidt's earlier account. If this Romanian identification is taken to be correct, the first objection to the \"nosophoros\" etymology is that Romanian is a Romance language. While Romanian does have some words borrowed from Greek, as do most European languages, Greek is generally considered to be only a minor contributor to the Romanian vocabulary—absent any other information, any given Romanian word is much more likely to be of Latin origin than Greek. Second, the word appears to be quite rare in Greek. One instance of a Greek word similar to νοσοφόρος, νοσηφόρος (\"nosēphoros\"), is attested in fragments from a 2nd-century AD work by Marcellus Sidetes on medicine plus another of the Ionic dialect variant νουσοφόρος (\"nousophoros\") from the Palatine Anthology.[16] These two variant forms are subsumed as examples of the main νοσοφόρος lemma in the definitive Liddel-Scott Greek–English Lexicon, but examples of the normalized form itself seem to be lacking. In any event, supporting evidence for a relationship between this rare and obscure Greek term and nosferatu appears weak. In some versions of the \"nosophoros\" etymology, an intermediate form *nesufur-atu,[15] or sometimes *nosufur-atu is presented[14] but both the original source for this and the justification for it are unclear. This form is often indicated to be Slavonic or Slavic. It is likely that either Old Church Slavonic or the protolanguage Proto-Slavic is intended. As with νοσοφόρος, this supposed Slavonic word does not appear to be attested in primary sources, which severely undermines the credibility of the argument. Another common etymology suggests that the word meant \"not breathing\", which appears to be attempting to read a derivative of the Latin verb spirare (\"to breathe\") as a second morpheme in nosferatu, with the closest hypothetical Romanian word being *nuspirândul. Skal notes that this is \"without basis in lexicography\", viewing all these etymologies (including the widely repeated nosophoros etymology) with skepticism.[9] A final possibility is that the form given by Gerard and the German folklorists is a well-known Romanian term without the benefit of normalized spelling, or possibly a misinterpretation of the sounds of the word due to Gerard's limited familiarity with the language, or possibly a dialectal variant of the word. The standardization of Romanian was rather incomplete in the 19th century, as can be seen in Dictionariulu Limbei Romane of 1871, which in a highly Latinized orthography defines incubu (\"incubus\") as \"unu spiritu necuratu\" compared to the modern standard \"un spirit necurat\". Three candidate words that have been put forth are necurat (\"unclean\", usually associated with the occult, compare a avea un spirit necurat, to have an evil spirit, be possessed),[dubious – discuss][17][18] nesuferit[dubious – discuss],[9] and nefârtat (\"enemy\", lit. \"unbrothered\").[19] The nominative masculine definite form of a Romanian noun in the declension to which these words belong takes the ending \"-ul\" or even the shortened \"u\", as in Romanian \"l\" is usually lost in the process of speaking, so the definite forms nefârtatu, necuratu and nesuferitu are commonly encountered.",

                "content": "Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror (German: Nosferatu – Eine Symphonie des Grauens) is a 1922 silent German Expressionist vampire film directed by F. W. Murnau and starring Max Schreck as Count Orlok, a vampire who preys on the wife (Greta Schröder) of his estate agent (Gustav von Wangenheim) and brings the plague to their town. Nosferatu was produced by Prana Film and is an unauthorized and unofficial adaptation of Bram Stoker's 1897 novel Dracula. Various names and other details were changed from the novel, including Count Dracula being renamed Count Orlok then finally Nosferatu, an archaic Romanian word with a suggested etymology of Nesuferitu`, meaning \"the offensive one\" or \"the insufferable one\". Although those changes are often represented as a defense against copyright infringement,[3] the original German intertitles acknowledged Dracula as the source. Film historian David Kalat states in his commentary track that since the film was \"a low-budget film made by Germans for German audiences... setting it in Germany with German-named characters makes the story more tangible and immediate for German-speaking viewers\".[4] Even with several details altered, Stoker's heirs sued over the adaptation, and a court ruling ordered all copies of the film to be destroyed. However, several prints of Nosferatu survived,[1] and the film came to be regarded as an influential masterpiece of cinema and the horror genre.[5][6] Critic and historian Kim Newman declared it as a film that set the template for the genre of horror film.[7] In 1838, in the fictional German town of Wisborg,[1][8] Thomas Hutter is sent to Transylvania by his employer, estate agent Herr Knock, to visit a new client, Count Orlok, who is planning on buying a house across from Hutter's own residence. While embarking on his journey, Hutter stops at an inn in which the locals are frightened by the mere mention of Orlok's name. Hutter rides on a coach to Orlok's castle in the Carpathian Mountains, where he is welcomed by Orlok himself. When he is eating dinner and accidentally cuts his thumb, Orlok tries to suck the blood out, but his repulsed guest pulls his hand away. Hutter wakes up the morning after to find fresh punctures on his neck, which he attributes to mosquitoes. That night, Orlok signs the documents to purchase the house and notices on the table a miniature portrait of Hutter's wife, Ellen, an image that the young man carries with him in a small circular frame. Admiring the portrait, the count remarks that she has a \"lovely neck.\" Reading a book about vampires that he took from the inn, Hutter begins to suspect that Orlok is indeed a vampire. With no way to bar the door to his bedroom, Hutter desperately tries to hide as midnight approaches. Suddenly, the door begins to slowly open by itself; and, as Orlok enters, a terrified Hutter hides under the bedcovers and falls unconscious. Meanwhile, back in Wisborg, Ellen arises from her own bed and sleepwalks to the railing of her bedroom's balcony. She starts walking on top of the railing, which gets the attention of her friend Harding in the adjacent room. When the doctor arrives, Ellen shouts Hutter's name and envisions Orlok in his castle threatening her unconscious husband. The next day, Hutter explores the castle, only to retreat back into his room after he finds the coffin in which Orlok is resting dormant in the crypt. Hours later, Orlok piles up coffins on a coach and climbs into the last one before the coach departs; Hutter rushes home after learning of this. The coffins are taken aboard a schooner, where the sailors discover rats in the coffins. All of the crewmen later die, and Orlok takes control of the vessel. When the ship arrives in Wisborg, Orlok leaves unobserved, carries one of his coffins and moves into the house that he purchased. Many deaths in the town follow after Orlok's arrival, which the local doctors blame on an unspecified plague caused by the rats from the ship. Ellen reads the book that Hutter found; it claims that a vampire can be defeated if a pure-hearted woman distracts the vampire with her beauty and offers him her blood of her own free will; she decides to sacrifice herself. Ellen opens her window to invite Orlok in and pretends to fall ill so that she can send Hutter to fetch Professor Bulwer, a physician. After he leaves, Orlok enters and drinks her blood, but the sun rises, which causes Orlok to vanish in a puff of smoke. Ellen lives just long enough to be embraced by her grief-stricken husband. Orlok's castle is later shown destroyed. Nosferatu has been noted for its themes regarding fear of the Other, as well as for possible antisemitic undertones,[1] both of which may have been partially derived from the Bram Stoker novel Dracula, upon which the film was based.[9] The physical appearance of Count Orlok, with his hooked nose, long claw-like fingernails, and large bald head, has been compared to stereotypical caricatures of Jewish people from the time in which Nosferatu was produced.[10] His features have also been compared to those of a rat or a mouse, the former of which Jews were often equated with.[11][12] Orlok's interest in acquiring property in the German town of Wisborg, a shift in locale from the Stoker novel's London, has also been analyzed as preying on the fears and anxieties of the German public at the time.[13] Professor Tony Magistrale wrote that the film's depiction of an \"invasion of the German homeland by an outside force [...] poses disquieting parallels to the anti-Semitic atmosphere festering in Northern Europe in 1922.\"[13] When the foreign Orlok arrives in Wisborg by ship, he brings with him a swarm of rats which, in a deviation from the source novel, spread the plague throughout the town.[12][14] This plot element further associates Orlok with rodents and the idea of the \"Jew as disease-causing agent\".[10][12] It is also notable that Orlok's accomplice in conspiracy Knock is a Jewish realtor, who acts as the vampire's fifth column in the Biedermeier town of Wisborg.[15] There were other views – writer Kevin Jackson has noted that director F. W. Murnau \"was friendly with and protective of a number of Jewish men and women\" throughout his life, including Jewish actor Alexander Granach, who plays Knock in Nosferatu.[16] Additionally, Magistrale wrote that Murnau, being a homosexual, would have been \"presumably more sensitive to the persecution of a subgroup inside the larger German society\".[12] As such, it has been said that perceived associations between Orlok and antisemitic stereotypes are unlikely to have been conscious decisions on the part of Murnau.[12][16] Murnau and Grau gave Orlok in the film a demonic lineage and an occult origin: Orlok is the creation of Belial, one of the Satanic archdemons. Belial in Psalm 41:8–10 is also associated with pestilence, with Orlok in film being the very manifestation of contagion, rats pouring out of his coffins onto the streets of Wisborg, spreading Black Death.[17] Orlok's link to Belial is also highly significant because Belial is \"one of the demons traditionally summoned by Goetic magicians\" – making Orlok someone who practiced dark sorcery before becoming a vampire.[18] Orlok and his servant Knock are communicating in occult language – the documents between Orlok and Knock are written in the Enochian language, a constructed language said to be that of the angels, which was recorded in the private journals of English occultist John Dee and his colleague English alchemist Edward Kelley in late 16th-century Elizabethan England.[19][20] The character of Professor Bulwer in the film is named in reference to English occult novelist Edward Bulwer-Lytton.[20] The idea of astral entities, arising from the dark thoughts of human beings, responsible for epidemics that call for blood sacrifices in order to prevent them, is also closely linked to that of the alchemist Paracelsus, whose figure is partly embodied in the film in the character of Professor Bulwer (who is mentioned in the film to be Paracelsian himself). This is made concrete in the film in the plague epidemic that spreads through the city of Wisborg, which cannot be remedied by scientific methods, but by the blood sacrifice of a woman, thus destroying forever the dark being responsible for this catastrophic situation.[21] The idea for making this vampire film saw its genesis in the war-time experience of producer Albin Grau. Grau served in the German army during World War I on the Serbian front. While in Serbia Grau encountered a local farmer who told him of his father, who the farmer believed had become an undead vampire. F. W. Murnau, director of the film, also saw considerable action in World War I – not only as a company commander in the trenches of the Eastern Front, but also later in the air after he transferred to the German air service. He survived at least eight crashes. Max Schreck who portrayed Count Orlok also served in the trenches with the German army. Little is known of his war-time experience, but there are some signs he may have dealt with some form of post-traumatic stress disorder. Colleagues commented that he preferred to keep to himself. He was known to take long walks in the forest alone, often times disappearing for hours at a time. He once stated that he lived in \"a remote and incorporeal world\". Thus it is considered that the turmoil of 1920s Germany and the war-time experiences of those who produced the film left their marks on the production of the film.[22] As Lotte Eisner, a dedicated occultist, wrote: \"Mysticism and magic, the dark forces to which Germans have always been more than willing to commit themselves, had flourished in the face of death on the battlefields\" – these forces were intrinsic to the shaping of cinema's first vampires. Albin Grau himself also linked the war and vampires: \"this monstrous event that is unleashed across the earth like a cosmic vampire to drink the blood of millions and millions of men\". Belial as well is the link between war and contagion, as Orlok is linked directly to the Black Death and many critics have linked Nosferatu's disease-bearing rodents to the transmissible sickness associated with trench warfare in which rats flourished. As noted by Ernest Jones in his psychoanalytic study of nightmares, vampire legends proliferate in periods of mass contagion.[23] The studio behind Nosferatu, Prana Film, was a short-lived silent-era German film studio founded in 1921 by Enrico Dieckmann and occultist artist Albin Grau,[1] named after a Theosophical journal which was itself named for the Hindu concept of prana.[4] Although the studio's intent was to produce occult- and supernatural-themed films, Nosferatu was its only production,[24] as it declared bankruptcy shortly after the film's release. Grau claimed he was inspired to shoot a vampire film by a war experience: in Grau's apocryphal tale, during the winter of 1916, a Serbian farmer told him that his father was a vampire and one of the undead.[25] As a lifelong student of the occult and member of Fraternitas Saturni, under the magical name of Master Pacitius, Grau was able to imbue Nosferatu with hermetic and mystical undertones. One example in particular was the cryptic contract that Count Orlok and Knock exchanged, which was filled in Enochian, hermetic and alchemical symbols. Grau was also a strong influence on Orlok's verminous and emaciated look[26] and he also designed the film’s sets, costumes, make-up and the letter with the Enochian symbols. He also was responsible for film's advertising campaign, creating movie posters and advertisements. Grau’s visual style was also deeply influenced by work of the artist Hugo Steiner-Prag who had illustrated other texts with esoteric subjects such as Gustav Meyrink’s Golem and E. T. A. Hoffmann’s Die Elixiere des Teufels (1907).[27] Diekmann and Grau gave Henrik Galeen, a disciple of Hanns Heinz Ewers, the task to write a screenplay inspired by the Dracula novel, although Prana Film had not obtained the film rights. Galeen was an experienced specialist in dark romanticism; he had already worked on The Student of Prague (1913), and the screenplay for The Golem: How He Came into the World (1920). Galeen set the story in the fictional north German harbour town of Wisborg. He changed the characters' names and added the idea of the vampire bringing the plague to Wisborg via rats on the ship. Galeen's Expressionist style screenplay was poetically rhythmic, without being so dismembered as other books influenced by literary Expressionism, such as those by Carl Mayer. Lotte Eisner described Galeen's screenplay as \"voll Poesie, voll Rhythmus\" (\"full of poetry, full of rhythm\").[28] Actor Conrad Veidt was offered the role of Count Orlok, having previously worked with Murnau, but had to decline for scheduling reasons. In the search for an alternative the choice finally fell on the then-still-unknown actor Max Schreck.[29] Filming began in July 1921, with exterior shots in Wismar. A take from Marienkirche's tower over Wismar marketplace with the Wasserkunst Wismar [de] served as the establishing shot for the Wisborg scene. Other locations were the Wassertor [de], the Heiligen-Geist-Kirche yard and the harbour. In Lübeck, the abandoned Salzspeicher served as Nosferatu's new Wisborg house, the one of the churchyard of the Aegidienkirche served as Hutter's, and down the Depenau a procession of coffin bearers bore coffins of supposed plague victims. Many scenes of Lübeck appear in the hunt for Knock, who ordered Hutter in the Yard of Füchting to meet Count Orlok. Further exterior shots followed in Lauenburg, Rostock and on Sylt. The exteriors of the film set in Transylvania were actually shot on location in northern Slovakia, including the High Tatras, Vrátna dolina, Orava Castle, the Váh River, and Starý Castle [sk].[30] The team filmed interior shots at the JOFA studio in Berlin's Johannisthal locality and further exteriors in the Tegel Forest.[1] For cost reasons, cameraman Fritz Arno Wagner only had one camera available, and therefore there was only one original negative.[31] The director followed Galeen's screenplay carefully, following handwritten instructions on camera positioning, lighting, and related matters.[28] Nevertheless, Murnau completely rewrote 12 pages of the script, as Galeen's text was missing from the director's working script. This concerned the last scene of the film, in which Ellen sacrifices herself and the vampire dies in the first rays of the sun.[32][33] Murnau prepared carefully; there were sketches that were to correspond exactly to each filmed scene, and he used a metronome to control the pace of the acting.[34] The original score was composed by Hans Erdmann and performed by an orchestra at the film's Berlin premiere. However, most of the score has been lost, and what remains is only a partial adapted suite.[1] Thus, throughout the history of Nosferatu screenings, many composers and musicians have written or improvised their own soundtrack to accompany the film. For example, James Bernard, composer of the soundtracks of many Hammer horror films in the late 1950s and 1960s, wrote a score for a reissue.[1][35] Bernard's score was released in 1997 by Silva Screen Records. A version of Erdmann's original score reconstructed by musicologists and composers Gillian Anderson and James Kessler was released in 1995 by BMG Classics, with multiple missing sequences composed anew, in an attempt to match Erdmann's style. An earlier reconstruction by German composer Berndt Heller has many additions of unrelated classical works.[1] In 2022, the New York Times wrote about Dutch composer Jozef van Wissem's new score and record release for Nosferatu. Beginning with a solo played on the lute, his performance incorporates electric guitar and distorted recordings of extinct birds, graduating from subtlety to gothic horror. \"My soundtrack goes from silence to noise over the course of 90 minutes,\" he said, culminating in \"dense, slow death metal.\"[36] A new score for full orchestra and piano was commissioned by the Louisville Orchestra from its former composer-in-residence Sebastian Chang. It premiered, played live with the film in October 2023.[37] Shortly before the premiere, an advertisement campaign was placed in issue #21 of the magazine Bühne und Film, with a summary, scene and work photographs, production reports, and essays, including a treatment on vampirism by Albin Grau.[39] Nosferatu opened in the Netherlands on 16 February 1922 at the Hague Flora and Olympia cinemas.[40] Nosferatu premiered in Germany on 4 March 1922 in the Marmorsaal of the Berlin Zoological Garden. This was planned as a large society evening entitled Das Fest des Nosferatu (Festival of Nosferatu), and guests were asked to arrive dressed in Biedermeier costume. The German cinema premiere itself took place on 15 March 1922 at Berlin's Primus-Palast.[1] The 1930s sound version Die zwölfte Stunde – Eine Nacht des Grauens (The Twelfth Hour: A Night of Horror), which is less commonly known, was a completely unauthorized and re-edited version of the film. It was released in Vienna, Austria on 16 May 1930 with sound-on-disc accompaniment and a recomposition of Hans Erdmann's original score by Georg Fiebiger, a German production manager and composer of film music. It had an alternative ending lighter than the original and the characters were renamed again; Count Orlok's name was changed to Prince Wolkoff, Knock became Karsten, Hutter and Ellen became Kundberg and Margitta, and Annie was changed to Maria.[1] This version, of which Murnau was unaware, contained many scenes filmed by Murnau but not previously released. It also contained additional footage not filmed by Murnau but by a cameraman, Günther Krampf, under the direction of Waldemar Roger [de] (also known as Waldemar Ronger),[41] supposedly also a film editor and lab chemist.[citation needed] The name of director F. W. Murnau is no longer mentioned in the credits.[citation needed] This version, lasting approximately 80 minutes, was presented on 5 June 1981 at the Cinémathèque Française.[42] Nosferatu brought Murnau into the public eye, especially when his film Der brennende Acker (The Burning Soil) was released a few days later. The press reported extensively on Nosferatu and its premiere. With the laudatory votes, there was also occasional criticism that the technical perfection and clarity of the images did not fit the horror theme. The Filmkurier of 6 March 1922 said that the vampire appeared too corporeal and brightly lit to appear genuinely scary. Hans Wollenberg described the film in photo-Stage No. 11 of 11 March 1922 as a \"sensation\" and praised Murnau's nature shots as \"mood-creating elements.\"[43] In the Vossische Zeitung of 7 March 1922, Nosferatu was praised for its visual style.[44] Nosferatu was also the first film to show a vampire dying from exposure to sunlight. Previous vampire novels such as Dracula had shown them being uncomfortable with sunlight, but not undeath-threateningly so.[45] The film has received overwhelmingly positive reviews. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 97% based on 63 reviews, with an average rating of 9.05/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"One of the silent era's most influential masterpieces, Nosferatu's eerie, gothic feel – and a chilling performance from Max Schreck as the vampire – set the template for the horror films that followed.\"[46] In 1995, the Vatican included Nosferatu on a list of 45 important films that people should watch.[47] It was ranked twenty-first in Empire magazine's \"The 100 Best Films of World Cinema\" in 2010.[48] In 1997, critic Roger Ebert added Nosferatu to his list of The Great Movies, writing: Here is the story of Dracula before it was buried alive in clichés, jokes, TV skits, cartoons and more than 30 other films. The film is in awe of its material. It seems to really believe in vampires. ...Is Murnau's Nosferatu scary in the modern sense? Not for me. I admire it more for its artistry and ideas, its atmosphere and images, than for its ability to manipulate my emotions like a skillful modern horror film. It knows none of the later tricks of the trade, like sudden threats that pop in from the side of the screen. But Nosferatu remains effective: It doesn't scare us, but it haunts us.[49] Nosferatu only entered the public domain worldwide by the end of 2019. Despite this, the film had already been subject to widespread circulation via a sped-up, unrestored black and white bootleg copy.[50] Beginning in 1981, the film has had various different official restorations, several of which have been issued on home video in the U.S., Europe and Australia. These versions, which are all tinted, speed-corrected and have specially recorded scores, are separately copyrighted with respect to new copyrightable elements.[1] The most recent restoration, completed in 2005/2006, has been released on DVD and Blu-ray throughout the world, and features a reconstruction of Hans Erdmann's original score by Berndt Heller.[51] In 1977, Spanish amateur filmmaker José Ernesto Díaz Noriega added humorous and iconoclastic dialogues to the film. His adaptation or détournement, titled Manuscrito encontrato en Zarazwela or Nos fera tu la pugnete, was based on a S8 mm print of the English version. \"Observing the curious coincidence of the fiction that is related in the film with history\",[52] Díaz Noriega adapted Nosferatu's plot to the years of the Spanish transition to democracy: Prime Minister Arias Navarro becomes Draculas Navarro and Juan Carlos de Borbón becomes Jonathan Carolus (prince of Franconia). The original Transylvania becomes Galitzia and the Pazo de Meirás becomes the vampire's castle. All Murnau's characters find equivalence in the political actors of the Spanish transition to democracy.[53] A 1979 adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel Dracula by director Werner Herzog, Nosferatu the Vampyre, starred Klaus Kinski (as Count Dracula, not Count Orlok).[54] The film is a remake of the 1922 film with character names that are faithful to the novel. A remake by director David Lee Fisher was in development after being successfully funded on Kickstarter on 3 December 2014.[55] On 13 April 2016, it was reported that Doug Jones had been cast as Count Orlok in the film and that filming had begun. The film would use green screen to insert colorized backgrounds from the original film atop live-action, a process Fisher previously used for his remake The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (2005).[56][1] In November 2023, it premiered at the Emagine Theater in Novi.[57] It was later released on video on demand via Amazon Prime Video in September 2024 and on streaming though Apple TV+ on 18 October 2024.[58] In July 2015, a remake was announced with Robert Eggers writing and directing.[59] It was reported in September 2022 that Eggers' remake would be distributed by Focus Features, with Bill Skarsgård set to star as Orlok and Lily-Rose Depp as Ellen Hutter. Willem Dafoe, Nicholas Hoult, and Emma Corrin also appear.[60] The film wrapped principal photography on 19 May 2023.[61] The film's first teaser trailer was released on 24 June 2024, and it confirmed that the film will be released on 25 December 2024.[62]",

                "content": "In 1887, a vampire wakes up and seeks to quench his thirst for blood. Brave men and women ally to destroy him  but to do so, they will have to thwart the plot of Renfeld, his faithful servant. Nosferatu is a card game mixing tactics, bluffing, and team play, with the vampire and Renfeld facing off against the vampire hunters. At the start of the game, everyone knows who Renfeld is, and Renfield knows which of the hunters is actually a vampire (as he chooses how to distribute the character cards), but the vampire's identity is hidden from everyone else. The hunters must identify the vampire and kill him with the ancestral stake before he can play five bite cards; if the hunters accidentally stake one of their own, then demoralized and weakened they lose the game. Components  Rules  8 Character Cards  49 Library Cards  11 Clock Cards  5 Ritual Cards  1 Ancestral Stake CardEach player other than Renfield starts with two cards from the library, which is comprised of rumors, components, bites and night cards. Three ritual cards  silver mirror, blood transfusion, and time distortion  are placed face-up on the table. Renfield takes the \"Eternal Darkness\" card, while one hunter holds the ancestral stake. Renfield creates a \"clock\" by taking one night card for each player and shuffling it with a dawn card. The game lasts a number of rounds, with the rounds continuing until one of the winning conditions is met. At the start of a round, players take turns doing the following: Drawing two cards from the library, discarding one card face-up, placing one card face-down in an action pile, then drawing a card from the clock. As soon as a player draws the dawn card or each player has played once, this part of the round ends. Renfield shuffles all the cards in the action pile, then reveals them. If the pile contains only components, the player holding the stake chooses one of the rituals, takes its action  forcing Renfield to reveal a character card, removing a bite from a hunter, or removing a night card from the clock  then turns the ritual face-down. Once all three rituals have been used, they're turned face-up and can be used again. If the deck contains bite cards, then Renfield applies the bites to the hunters, with a hunter losing one card in his stock for each bite; a hunter can have at most two bites. Night cards in the pile are added to the clock, thereby giving the vampire more time to work in future rounds, while making it tougher for players to achieve rituals. If the dawn card was revealed, the holder of the ancient stake can stab someone, thereby ending the game with victory for one side or the other, or pass the stake to another player. (If dawn didn't break, then the stake passes to another player with no opportunity for stabbing.) Once a hunter is bitten, Renfield flips the \"Eternal Darkness\" card to its \"Darkness Master\" side. If the library runs out and the \"Darkness Master\" side is face-up, you flip the card, shuffle the library, and start a new round. If, however, \"Eternal Darkness\" still shows (i.e., no one was bitten during this pass through the library), then the stake holder must reveal someone's character card, possibly unveiling the vampire for all to see.

                "content": "Travis Michael Kelce (/ˈkɛlsi/ ⓘ KEL-see;[a] born October 5, 1989) is an American professional football tight end for the Kansas City Chiefs of the National Football League (NFL). He was selected by the Chiefs in the third round of the 2013 NFL draft and later won Super Bowls LIV, LVII, and LVIII with the team. He played college football for the University of Cincinnati Bearcats football program. Considered one of the greatest tight ends of all time,[11][12] Kelce is a nine-time Pro Bowler and a seven-time All-Pro, with four first-team and three second-team selections. He holds the NFL records for most consecutive and most overall seasons with 1,000 receiving yards by a tight end: seven.[4] He holds the record for most receiving yards by a tight end in a single season with 1,416 in 2020, despite playing in only 15 games.[5][13] During the 2022 season, Kelce became the fifth NFL tight end to reach 10,000 career receiving yards and reached the milestone faster than any tight end in NFL history.[4] Kelce was named to the NFL 2010s All-Decade Team.[14][15] During the 2023 season, he surpassed Jerry Rice in career playoff receptions en route to Super Bowl LVIII, his fourth Super Bowl appearance in five seasons. Outside of football, Kelce has appeared on reality and scripted television, including being the namesake of the dating show Catching Kelce on E!, hosting the March 5, 2023, episode of Saturday Night Live, and in advertisements. He co-hosts the podcast New Heights with his brother Jason, covering topics from football to popular culture. The show was ranked as the 8th most popular show in the US on Apple Podcasts in 2024.[16] Kelce's relationship with singer-songwriter Taylor Swift has drawn massive media coverage and stimulated viewership and revenue for his team and its league. Kelce was born on October 5, 1989, in Westlake, Ohio. His father, Ed Kelce, is a former sales representative in the steel industry, and his mother, Donna, is a former bank executive. Kelce's older brother Jason played center for the Philadelphia Eagles for 13 seasons.[17] Kelce attended Cleveland Heights High School in his hometown of Cleveland Heights, Ohio, where he played football, basketball, and baseball.[18] He was a three-year letter winner as quarterback for the Tigers. As a senior in 2007, he ran for 1,016 yards and 10 touchdowns and threw for 1,523 yards, 21 touchdowns, and eight interceptions. His 2,539 yards of total offense garnered him All-Lake Erie League honors.[19][20] Considered a two-star recruit by Rivals.com, Kelce accepted a scholarship offer from the University of Cincinnati over offers from Akron, Eastern Michigan, and Miami (OH).[21] He joined his brother, Jason Kelce, who was the starting left guard for the Bearcats. After redshirting in 2008, he appeared in 11 games in 2009, playing at tight end and quarterback out of the Wildcat formation. He tallied eight rushes for 47 yards and two touchdowns and had one reception for three yards.[22] He was suspended for the 2010 season after testing positive for marijuana, a violation of team rules.[23][24] Returning for the 2011 season, he played tight end, recording 13 catches totaling 150 yards and two touchdowns.[25] In 2012, his last collegiate season, he set personal season highs in receptions (45), receiving yards (722), yards per receptions (16.0), and receiving touchdowns (8). Kelce earned first-team all-conference honors[26] and in March 2013, was named the College Football Performance Awards Tight End of the Year.[27] Kelce graduated in 2022 with a Bachelor of Interdisciplinary Studies degree,[28] he received his diploma during an April 2024 podcast event at the Fifth Third Arena with his brother Jason.[29] Kelce was selected by the Kansas City Chiefs in the third round (63rd pick overall) of the 2013 NFL draft.[33] The Chiefs had hired Andy Reid as their new head coach during the off-season. Reid was familiar with Kelce, having drafted and coached his brother, Jason Kelce, in 2011 during his time as the head coach of the Eagles.[34][35] On June 6, 2013, the Chiefs signed Kelce to a four-year, $3.12 million rookie contract that also included a signing bonus of $703,304.[36] Kelce injured his knee in the preseason. The injury was later diagnosed as a bone bruise. After being limited the first two weeks of the season due to the injury and being inactive the next three games, Kelce was placed on injured reserve on October 12, 2013, after having a microfracture surgery performed on his knee.[37] He only played one snap, on special teams in the Chiefs' Week 2 game against the Dallas Cowboys.[38] During Week 3 against the Miami Dolphins, Kelce recorded his first NFL touchdown on a 20-yard reception from quarterback Alex Smith.[39] On November 30, he was fined $11,025 for \"unsportsmanlike conduct\" during a 29–16 loss to the Denver Broncos. Kelce made an inappropriate hand gesture and motion at Broncos linebacker Von Miller. Chiefs' head coach Andy Reid later called this \"immature\".[40] In the next game against the Arizona Cardinals, Kelce had seven receptions for 110 yards for his first NFL game with over 100 receiving yards.[41] In the regular-season finale against the San Diego Chargers, he had an offensive fumble recovery for a touchdown in the 19–7 victory.[42] Kelce was the Chiefs' leading receiver during the 2014 season, totaling 862 yards off 67 receptions.[43] Kelce began the 2015 season with his first NFL multiple touchdown game, with six receptions for 106 yards and two touchdowns in the 27–20 victory over the Houston Texans.[44] It was his only 100-plus-yard game, but he had at least one reception in all 16 games,[45] and was ranked a top-five tight end by ESPN.[46] He started all 16 regular season games and recorded 72 catches for 875 yards and five touchdowns, earning his way to his first Pro Bowl.[47][48] The Chiefs finished the regular season with an 11–5 record and made the playoffs.[49] In his first NFL playoff game, Kelce had eight receptions for 128 yards in a 30–0 Wild Card Round victory over the Texans.[50] In the Divisional Round against the New England Patriots, Kelce had six receptions for 23 yards as the Chiefs lost 27–20.[51] He was ranked 91st by his peers on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2016.[52] On January 29, 2016, Kelce signed a five-year, $46 million contract extension.[53] He was ranked 91st by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2016.[52] During Week 8 against the Indianapolis Colts, Kelce had seven receptions for 101 yards and a touchdown.[54] In the next game against the Jacksonville Jaguars, he was ejected after receiving two unsportsmanlike conduct penalties after arguing with two officials over not having a pass interference penalty called.[55] The second resulted from him sarcastically throwing his towel at field judge Mike Weatherford in a flagging motion due to being upset about the first penalty. He was later fined $24,309 for his outburst.[56] During Week 13 against the Atlanta Falcons, he had eight receptions for 140 yards.[57] In the next game, Kelce recorded 101 receiving yards against the Oakland Raiders, his fourth consecutive game topping 100.[58] He joined Jimmy Graham and former Chiefs tight end Tony Gonzalez as the only NFL tight ends ever to do so.[59] In a Christmas Day win over the Broncos, Kelce had career bests of 11 receptions for 160 yards and a career-long 80-yard touchdown on a screen pass.[45] He finished the season with career highs in yards (1,125) and receptions (85).[60] His 1,125 receiving yards led the league among tight ends and his 85 receptions were second among tight ends behind Dennis Pitta of the Baltimore Ravens. Kelce's 634 yards after the catch also led all NFL tight ends.[61] He was named as a starter in his second career Pro Bowl, held on December 20, 2016.[62] He was also named First-team All-Pro.[63] He was ranked 26th by his fellow players, and second among tight ends, on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2017.[64] The Chiefs finished atop the AFC West with a 12–4 record and earned a first-round bye in the playoffs.[65] In the Divisional Round against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Kelce had five receptions for 77 yards in the 18–16 loss.[66] During Week 2 against the Eagles, Kelce had eight receptions for 103 yards and a touchdown in the 27–20 victory.[67] After just one reception for one yard in Week 3 against the Los Angeles Chargers, Kelce recorded seven receptions for 111 yards and a touchdown in Week 4 against the Washington Redskins followed by eight for 98 in Week 5 against the Texans.[68][69][70] During Week 8, Kelce had seven receptions for 133 yards to pass Zach Ertz as the NFL's leading tight end in both categories,[71] along with a touchdown. During Week 13 against the New York Jets, Kelce opened the game with spectacular fashion, scoring two receiving touchdowns on 90 receiving yards in the first 2 minutes and 46 seconds of regulation. He finished the game with 94 receiving yards on four receptions in the 38–31 loss.[72] On December 19, 2017, Kelce was named to his third straight Pro Bowl.[73] Kelce finished the season with a career-high eight receiving touchdowns.[74] He finished second among tight ends with 1,038 receiving yards, only trailing Gronkowski's 1,084 receiving yards.[75] He was ranked 24th by his peers on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2018.[76] The 10–6 Chiefs[77] entered the Wild Card Round of the playoffs against the Tennessee Titans, where Kelce finished with four receptions for 66 yards and a touchdown in the 21–22 defeat.[78] He was not able to finish the game as he suffered a concussion in the first half on a hit to his helmet.[79] In the 2018 season, Kelce benefited from the rise of new quarterback Patrick Mahomes, who was named NFL MVP at the end of the season.[80] After being held to a lone reception for six yards in the season opener against the Chargers, he rebounded with seven receptions for 106 yards and two touchdowns in a Week 2 road victory over the Steelers.[81] In two of the next three games, he was able to reach 100 receiving yards against the San Francisco 49ers and the Jaguars.[82][83] He added 99 yards and two touchdowns in a Week 9 win over the Cleveland Browns, and went into the Week 12 bye with 10 receptions for 127 yards and a touchdown in an offensively spectacular 54–51 loss to the Los Angeles Rams. In the Week 13 win over the Raiders, Kelce had career-bests of 12 receptions and 168 yards, including two short touchdowns in the first half.[84] At this point, he was well on his way to an NFL record, but his production tapered off; over the final four weeks, Kelce averaged six receptions for 63.5 yards and had only one touchdown reception.[45] In Week 17, Kelce indeed broke the NFL record for most receiving yards by a tight end in a single season, but 49ers tight end George Kittle passed him to claim the record less than an hour later.[85] Kelce ended the regular season at 10th in the NFL in receptions with 103 and receiving yards with 1,336, and sixth in receiving touchdowns with 10.[86] He was named to the 2018 Pro Bowl and was named first-team All-Pro.[87] The Chiefs finished atop the AFC West with a 12–4 record and earned a first-round bye.[88] In the Divisional Round against the Colts, he had seven receptions for 108 yards in the 31–13 victory.[89] In the AFC Championship against the Patriots, he had three receptions for 23 yards and a receiving touchdown in the 37–31 overtime loss.[90] He was ranked 21st by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2018.[91] During Week 2 against the Raiders, Kelce caught seven passes for 107 yards and a touchdown of the season as the Chiefs won by a score of 28–10.[92] Despite injuries to Patrick Mahomes and just two touchdowns, at the midpoint of the season Kelce led all tight ends and Chiefs players in receiving yards with 604.[93][94] During Week 11 against the Chargers on Monday Night Football in Mexico, Kelce caught seven passes for 92 yards and a touchdown in the 24–17 win.[95] During Week 14 against the Patriots, Kelce caught seven passes for 66 yards and rushed the ball once for a one-yard touchdown during the 23–16 road victory.[96] In the next game against the Broncos, Kelce finished with 11 catches for 142 receiving yards as the Chiefs won 23–3.[97] In the next game against the Chicago Bears on Sunday Night Football, he caught eight passes for 74 yards and a touchdown in the 26–3 win. During the game, he became the fastest tight end in NFL history to record 500 career receptions.[98] Kelce finished the 2019 season with 97 receptions for 1,229 receiving yards and five receiving touchdowns to go along with his one rushing touchdown.[99] Kelce became the first tight end in NFL history to record four consecutive seasons with at least 1,000 receiving yards.[100] He was named to his fifth Pro Bowl for his 2019 season.[101] In the Divisional Round against the Texans, the Chiefs began the game with a 24–0 deficit. The Chiefs then went on a 51–7 run, including 41 unanswered points, to win 51–31. After a drop on third down on the Chiefs first drive that would have been a first down if it had been caught, Kelce caught 10 passes for 134 yards and three touchdowns (all in the second quarter) as he helped lead the Chiefs to their second consecutive conference championship game.[102] In the AFC Championship Game against the Titans, Kelce caught three passes for 30 yards during the 35–24 win.[103] In Super Bowl LIV against the San Francisco 49ers, Kelce caught six passes for 43 receiving yards and a receiving touchdown and had one carry for two rushing yards during the 31–20 win.[104] He was ranked 18th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2020.[105] Following the release of long-time Chiefs punter Dustin Colquitt in the offseason, Kelce became tied with Anthony Sherman and fellow 2013 draftee Eric Fisher as the team's longest tenured members.[106] On August 14, 2020, Kelce signed a four-year, $57 million contract extension with the Chiefs through the 2025 season.[107] In Week 6, he caught two touchdowns in a 26–17 victory over the Buffalo Bills.[108] In Week 8 against the Jets, Kelce dunked the ball through the goal posts after scoring a touchdown, paying homage to former Chiefs tight end Tony Gonzalez. He was penalized for unsportsmanlike conduct and was fined $12,500.[109] In Week 9, against the Carolina Panthers, he had ten receptions for 159 receiving yards in the 33–31 victory.[110] In Week 11 against the Las Vegas Raiders on Sunday Night Football, Kelce recorded eight catches for 127 yards and scored the game-winning touchdown in a 35–31 win.[111] In Week 13 against the Broncos on Sunday Night Football, he caught eight passes for 136 yards and a touchdown during the 22–16 win.[112] In the following game against the Dolphins, he again posted eight catches for 136 yards and a touchdown in a 33–27 victory.[113] In Week 16, Kelce became the first tight end with two 100-catch seasons.[13][5] Kelce caught seven passes, giving him a career-high 105 for the season. Kelce set the single-season yardage record for a tight end with 1,416, topping George Kittle's 1,377 in 2018.[13][5][114] His yardage ranked second overall in the 2020 NFL season (behind Stefon Diggs' 1,535), while his total receptions ranked fifth in the NFL and second among tight ends (behind Darren Waller's 107).[115] He was named to his sixth Pro Bowl and earned First-team All-Pro honors.[116][117] In the Divisional Round of the playoffs against the Browns, Kelce caught eight passes for 109 yards and a touchdown during the 22–17 win.[118] In the AFC Championship against the Bills, Kelce recorded 13 catches for 118 yards and two touchdowns in a 38–24 win to advance to Super Bowl LV.[119] In the Super Bowl, he caught 10 passes for 133 yards—a record for receiving yards by a tight end in the championship game—but the Chiefs did not score a touchdown in the 31–9 loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.[120][121] He was ranked fifth by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2021.[122] After Fisher was released and Sherman retired in the offseason, Kelce became the longest-tenured member of the Chiefs.[106] In the Chiefs' second game of the season, against the Ravens, he became the fastest tight end in NFL history to record 8,000 career yards, surpassing Rob Gronkowski's record in 113 games.[123] In the Chiefs' week-15 game against the Chargers, Kelce set a career high for receiving yards in a game with 191 yards. He also caught two touchdowns, including the game-winning 34-yard touchdown in overtime.[124] Kelce was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week for his performance.[125] The game also put him over 1,000 yards for the season, his NFL record (among tight ends) extending sixth consecutive 1,000-yard season. It also extended Kelce's record for most 1,000-yard seasons by a tight end with six. He was placed on the Reserve/COVID-19 list on December 20, 2021.[126] Kelce was activated on December 25, 2021.[127] However, due to NFL protocols for COVID-19, since he tested positive for the virus and did not test negative before the day of the game, he was ruled out for the Chiefs' week 16 game against the Steelers. It was the first game Kelce had missed due to injury or illness since his rookie season.[128] In the regular season-ending game against the Broncos, Kelce became the fastest tight end in NFL history to reach 9,000 career yards in just 127 games, a record also previously held by Gronkowski with 140 games.[129] He finished the season with 92 receptions for 1,125 receiving yards and nine touchdowns. He was named Second-Team All-Pro by the AP, his sixth overall All-Pro selection. He was also named to his seventh consecutive Pro Bowl.[130] In the Wild Card Round against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Kelce had five receptions for 108 yards and a receiving touchdown to go along with a two-yard touchdown pass to Byron Pringle in the 42–21 victory.[131] In the Divisional Round against the Bills, he had eight receptions for 96 yards and the game-winning touchdown in the 42–36 overtime victory.[132] Kelce was wearing an NFL Films microphone for the game, and audio footage from the two offensive plays of the 13-second drive revealed that Kelce instructed Tyreek Hill to run the route which led to the success of the first completion, and revealed him suggesting to Mahomes that he might improvise his own route on the second offensive play if the Bills' defensive scheme didn't change. Prior to the snap, Mahomes realized Kelce's suggested improvised route would work and shouted \"Do it, Kelce!\", before finding his tight-end for a completion of 25 yards.[133] In the AFC Championship against the Cincinnati Bengals, he had 10 receptions for 95 yards and a touchdown in the 27–24 overtime loss.[134] He was ranked tenth by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2022.[135] In Week 5, Kelce had four receiving touchdowns in the 30–29 victory over the Raiders.[136] Kelce tied the franchise record for receiving touchdowns in a game.[137][138] In the Chiefs' Week 11 game against the Chargers, he recorded his NFL record-breaking (among tight ends) 33rd 100-yard receiving game with 115 yards.

                "content": "Editions: En/nfl/kansas-city-chiefs Will it catch on in the Chiefs locker room? Travis Kelce, the Kansas City Chiefs' star tight end, has recently embraced a new nickname among his friends: \"The Kansas City Stallion.\" This revelation comes with the fact that the Super Bowl winner has developed a huge affection for Italian culture, a passion that has blossomed alongside his relationship with music star Taylor Swift. The couple's shared love for Italy became evident after a romantic getaway to Lake Como earlier this year. Their Italian escapades have been well-documented, with reports suggesting they are considering purchasing a residence in the picturesque region. Additionally, Swift reportedly rented the iconic Monza F1 race track to celebrate Kelce's 35th birthday, further cementing their connection to Italian culture. Related: Kelce's immersion into all things Italian has not gone unnoticed by his inner circle. Friends have observed his frequent use of Italian phrases \"We have been calling him the Kansas City Stallion,\" an insider told The U.S. Sun. \"He loves Sylvester Stallone - one of his favorite actors and a childhood idol. He's even started using Italian words like 'Grazzie! Tutto bene!' \"Travis now loves Italy and Italian things so much that he is learning and loving brands and items from there, and Taylor knows it!\" His growing appreciation for Italy does not stop there though. Friends claim he has also developed an affection for Italian fashion and cuisine. In light of this, they affectionately dubbed him \"The Kansas City Stallion,\" a nod to both his admiration for actor Sylvester Stallone and the Italian word for stallion, \"stallone.\" Taylor Swift has embraced Kelce's newfound enthusiasm, playfully participating in the jest. For his recent birthday, she gifted him luxury items from renowned Italian brands like Armani and Ferragamo, along with vintage Italian wines, aligning with his refined tastes. The couple's Italian adventures offer them a respite from their high-profile lives. According to sources close to them, these cultural escapades provide a significant departure from the limelight, allowing them to enjoy quality time together. Kelce, currently focused on securing another Super Bowl victory with the Chiefs, eagerly anticipates returning to Italy with Swift once the NFL season concludes. And more importantly, Swift is said to find the nickname quite endearing. Their shared experiences and mutual appreciation for Italian culture have only strengthened their bond, with Swift joining in the light-hearted teasing. Time will tell if the \"The Kansas City Stallion\" nickname also spreads in the Chiefs' locker room, as these things so often do in the sports world. © Unidad Editorial Información Deportiva, S.L.U.

                "title": "Hanukkah - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Hanukkah[a] (/ˈhænəkə/, /ˈhɑːnəkə/; חֲנֻכָּה‎ Ḥănukkā listenⓘ) is a Jewish festival commemorating the recovery of Jerusalem and subsequent rededication of the Second Temple at the beginning of the Maccabean Revolt against the Seleucid Empire in the 2nd century BCE.[3][4] Hanukkah is observed for eight nights and days,[5] starting on the 25th day of Kislev according to the Hebrew calendar, which may occur at any time from November 28 to December 27 in the Gregorian calendar. The festival is observed by lighting the candles of a candelabrum with nine branches, commonly called a menorah or hanukkiah. One branch is typically placed above or below the others and its candle is used to light the other eight candles. This unique candle is called the shammash (שַׁמָּשׁ‎, \"attendant\"). Each night, one additional candle is lit by the shammash until all eight candles are lit together on the final night of the festival.[6] Other Hanukkah festivities include singing Hanukkah songs, playing the game of dreidel and eating oil-based foods, such as latkes and sufganiyot (similar to jelly donuts), and dairy foods. Since the 1970s, the worldwide Chabad Hasidic movement has initiated public menorah lightings in open public places in many countries.[7] Originally instituted as a feast \"in the manner of Sukkot (Booths)\", it does not come with the corresponding obligations, and is therefore a relatively minor holiday in strictly religious terms. Nevertheless, Hanukkah has attained major cultural significance in North America and elsewhere, especially among secular Jews, due to often occurring around the same time as Christmas during the festive season.[8] The name \"Hanukkah\" derives from the Hebrew verb \"חנך‎\", meaning \"to dedicate\". On Hanukkah, the Maccabean Jews regained control of Jerusalem and rededicated the Temple.[9][10] Many homiletical explanations have been given for the name:[11] In Hebrew, the word Hanukkah is written חֲנֻכָּה‎ or חֲנוּכָּה‎ (Ḥănukā). It is most commonly transliterated to English as Hanukkah or Chanukah. The spelling Hanukkah, which is based on using characters of the English alphabet as symbols to re-create the word's correct spelling in Hebrew,[14] is the most common[15] and the preferred choice of Merriam–Webster,[16] Collins English Dictionary, the Oxford Style Manual, and the style guides of The New York Times and The Guardian.[17] The sound represented by Ch ([χ], similar to the Scottish pronunciation of loch) is not native to the English language.[18] Furthermore, the letter ḥeth (ח‎), which is the first letter in the Hebrew spelling, is pronounced differently in modern Hebrew (voiceless uvular fricative) from in classical Hebrew (voiceless pharyngeal fricative [ħ]), and neither of those sounds is unambiguously representable in English spelling. However, its original sound is closer to the English H than to the Scottish Ch, and Hanukkah more accurately represents the spelling in the Hebrew alphabet.[14] Moreover, the 'kaf' consonant is geminate in classical (but not modern) Hebrew. Adapting the classical Hebrew pronunciation with the geminate and pharyngeal Ḥeth can lead to the spelling Hanukkah, while adapting the modern Hebrew pronunciation with no gemination and uvular Ḥeth leads to the spelling Chanukah.[19][20][21] In Modern Hebrew, Hanukkah may also be called the Festival of Lights (חַג הַאוּרִים‎, Ḥag HaUrim), based on a comment by Josephus in Antiquities of the Jews, καὶ ἐξ ἐκείνου μέχρι τοῦ δεῦρο τὴν ἑορτὴν ἄγομεν καλοῦντες αὐτὴν φῶτα \"And from then on we celebrate this festival, and we call it Lights\". The first Hebrew translation of Antiquities (1864) used (חַג הַמְּאֹרוֹת‎) \"Festival of Lamps\", but the translation \"Festival of Lights\" (חַג הַאוּרִים‎) appeared by the end of the nineteenth century.[22] The story of Hanukkah is told in the books of the First and Second Maccabees, which describe in detail the rededication of the Temple in Jerusalem and the lighting of the menorah. These books, however, are not a part of the canonized Masoretic Text version of the Tanakh (Hebrew and Aramaic language Jewish Bible) used and accepted by normative Rabbinical Judaism and therefore modern Jews (as copied, edited and distributed by a group of Jews known as the Masoretes between the 7th and 10th centuries of the Common Era). However, the books of Maccabees were included among the deuterocanonical books added to the Septuagint, a Jewish scholarly Greek-language translation of the Hebrew Bible originally compiled in the mid-3rd century BCE. The Roman Catholic and Orthodox Churches consider the books of Maccabees as a canonical part of the Old Testament.[23] The eight-day rededication of the temple is described in 1 Maccabees,[24] though the miracle of the oil does not appear here. A story similar in character, and older in date, is the one alluded to in 2 Maccabees[25] according to which the relighting of the altar fire by Nehemiah was due to a miracle which occurred on the 25th of Kislev, and which appears to be given as the reason for the selection of the same date for the rededication of the altar by Judah Maccabee.[26] The above account in 1 Maccabees, as well as 2 Maccabees[27] portrays the feast as a delayed observation of the eight-day Feast of Booths (Sukkot); similarly 2 Maccabees explains the length of the feast as \"in the manner of the Feast of Booths\".[28] Megillat Taanit (1st century) contains a list of festive days on which fasting or eulogizing is forbidden. It specifies, \"On the 25th of [Kislev] is Hanukkah of eight days, and one is not to eulogize\" and then references the story of the rededication of the Temple.[29] The Mishna (late 2nd century) mentions Hanukkah in several places,[30] but never describes its laws in detail and never mentions any aspect of the history behind it. To explain the Mishna's lack of a systematic discussion of Hanukkah, Nissim ben Jacob postulated that information on the holiday was so commonplace that the Mishna felt no need to explain it.[31] Modern scholar Reuvein Margolies suggests that as the Mishnah was redacted after the Bar Kochba revolt, its editors were reluctant to include explicit discussion of a holiday celebrating another relatively recent revolt against a foreign ruler, for fear of antagonizing the Romans.[32] The miracle of the one-day supply of oil miraculously lasting eight days is described in the Talmud, committed to writing about 600 years after the events described in the books of Maccabees.[33] The Talmud says that after the forces of Antiochus IV had been driven from the Temple, the Maccabees discovered that almost all of the ritual olive oil had been profaned. They found only a single container that was still sealed by the High Priest, with enough oil to keep the menorah in the Temple lit for a single day. They used this, yet it burned for eight days (the time it took to have new oil pressed and made ready).[34] The Talmud presents three options:[35] Except in times of danger, the lights were to be placed outside one's door, on the opposite side of the mezuza, or in the window closest to the street. Rashi, in a note to Shabbat 21b, says their purpose is to publicize the miracle. The blessings for Hanukkah lights are discussed in tractate Succah, p. 46a.[36] Megillat Antiochus (probably composed in the 2nd century[37]) concludes with the following words: ...After this, the sons of Israel went up to the Temple and rebuilt its gates and purified the Temple from the dead bodies and from the defilement. And they sought after pure olive oil to light the lamps therewith, but could not find any, except one bowl that was sealed with the signet ring of the High Priest from the days of Samuel the prophet and they knew that it was pure. There was in it [enough oil] to light [the lamps therewith] for one day, but the God of heaven whose name dwells there put therein his blessing and they were able to light from it eight days. Therefore, the sons of Ḥashmonai made this covenant and took upon themselves a solemn vow, they and the sons of Israel, all of them, to publish amongst the sons of Israel, [to the end] that they might observe these eight days of joy and honour, as the days of the feasts written in [the book of] the Law; [even] to light in them so as to make known to those who come after them that their God wrought for them salvation from heaven. In them, it is not permitted to mourn, neither to decree a fast [on those days], and anyone who has a vow to perform, let him perform it.[38] The Al HaNissim prayer is recited on Hanukkah as an addition to the Amidah prayer, which was formalized in the late 1st century.[39] Al HaNissim describes the history of the holiday as follows: The Jewish historian Titus Flavius Josephus narrates in his book, Jewish Antiquities XII, how the victorious Judas Maccabeus ordered lavish yearly eight-day festivities after rededicating the Temple in Jerusalem that had been profaned by Antiochus IV Epiphanes.[40] Josephus does not say the festival was called Hanukkah but rather the \"Festival of Lights\": In the New Testament, John 10:22–23 says, \"Then came the Festival of Dedication at Jerusalem. It was winter, and Jesus was in the temple courts walking in Solomon's Colonnade\" (NIV). The Greek noun used appears in the neuter plural as \"the renewals\" or \"the consecrations\" (Ancient Greek: τὰ ἐγκαίνια; ta enkaínia).[42] The same root appears in 2 Esdras 6:16 in the Septuagint to refer specifically to Hanukkah. This Greek word was chosen because the Hebrew word for 'consecration' or 'dedication' is Hanukkah (חנכה). The Aramaic New Testament uses the Aramaic word hawdata (a close synonym), which literally means 'renewal' or 'to make new'.[43] After the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BCE, Judea became part of the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt until 200 BCE, when King Antiochus III the Great of Syria defeated King Ptolemy V Epiphanes of Egypt at the Battle of Panium. Judea then became part of the Seleucid Empire of Syria.[44] King Antiochus III the Great, wanting to conciliate his new Jewish subjects, guaranteed their right to \"live according to their ancestral customs\" and to continue to practice their religion in the Temple of Jerusalem.[45] The Seleucids, like the Ptolemies before them, held a suzerainty over Judea, where they respected Jewish culture and protected Jewish institutions. This policy was drastically reversed by Antiochus IV Epiphanes, the son of Antiochus III, seemingly after what was either a dispute over leadership of the Temple in Jerusalem and the office of High Priest, or possibly a revolt whose nature was lost to time after being crushed.[46] In 175 BCE, Antiochus IV invaded Judea at the request of the sons of Tobias.[47] The Tobiads, who led the Hellenizing Jewish faction in Jerusalem, were expelled to Syria around 170 BCE when the high priest Onias and his pro-Egyptian faction wrested control from them. The exiled Tobiads lobbied Antiochus IV Epiphanes to recapture Jerusalem. As Flavius Josephus relates: The king being thereto disposed beforehand, complied with them, and came upon the Jews with a great army, and took their city by force, and slew a great multitude of those that favored Ptolemy, and sent out his soldiers to plunder them without mercy. He also spoiled the temple, and put a stop to the constant practice of offering a daily sacrifice of expiation for three years and six months. When the Second Temple in Jerusalem was looted and services stopped, Judaism was outlawed. In 167 BCE, Antiochus ordered an altar to Zeus erected in the Temple. He banned brit milah (circumcision) and ordered pigs to be sacrificed at the altar of the temple.[49] Antiochus's actions provoked a large-scale revolt. Mattathias (Mattityahu), a Jewish priest, and his five sons Jochanan, Simeon, Eleazar, Jonathan, and Judah led a rebellion against Antiochus. It started with Mattathias killing first a Jew who wanted to comply with Antiochus's order to sacrifice to Zeus, and then a Greek official who was to enforce the government's behest (1 Mac. 2, 24–25[50]). Judah became known as Yehuda HaMakabi (\"Judah the Hammer\"). By 166 BCE, Mattathias had died, and Judah took his place as leader. By 164 BCE, the Jewish revolt against the Seleucid monarchy was successful. The Temple was liberated and rededicated. The festival of Hanukkah was instituted to celebrate this event.[51] Judah ordered the Temple to be cleansed, a new altar to be built in place of the polluted one and new holy vessels to be made.[26] According to the Talmud, \"For when the Greeks entered the Sanctuary, they defiled all the oils therein, and when the Hasmonean dynasty prevailed against and defeated them, they made search and found only one cruse of oil which lay with the seal of the kohen gadol (high priest), but which contained sufficient [oil] for one day's lighting only; yet a miracle was wrought therein, and they lit [the lamp] therewith for eight days. The following year these [days] were appointed a Festival with [the recital of] Hallel and thanksgiving.\" —Shabbat 21b Tertiary sources in the Jewish tradition make reference to this account.[52] Maimonides (12th century) described Hanukkah as follows: When, on the twenty-fifth of Kislev, the Jews had emerged victorious over their foes and destroyed them, they re-entered the Temple where they found only one jar of pure oil, enough to be lit for only a single day; yet they used it for lighting the required set of lamps for eight days, until they managed to press olives and produce pure oil. Because of this, the sages of that generation ruled that the eight days beginning with the twenty-fifth of Kislev should be observed as days of rejoicing and praising the Lord. Lamps are lit in the evening over the doors of the homes, on each of the eight nights, so as to display the miracle. These days are called Hanukkah, when it is forbidden to lament or to fast, just as it is on the days of Purim. Lighting the lamps during the eight days of Hanukkah is a religious duty imposed by the sages.[53] Some modern scholars, following the account in 2 Maccabees, observe that the king was intervening in an internal civil war between the Maccabean Jews and the Hellenized Jews in Jerusalem.[54][55][56][57] These competed violently over who would be the High Priest, with traditionalists with Hebrew/Aramaic names like Onias contesting with Hellenizing High Priests with Greek names like Jason and Menelaus.[58] In particular, Jason's Hellenistic reforms would prove to be a decisive factor leading to eventual conflict within the ranks of Judaism.[59] Other authors point to possible socioeconomic reasons in addition to the religious reasons behind the civil war.[60] What began in many respects as a civil war escalated when the Hellenistic kingdom of Syria sided with the Hellenizing Jews in their conflict with the traditionalists.[61] As the conflict escalated, Antiochus took the side of the Hellenizers by prohibiting the religious practices the traditionalists had rallied around. This may explain why the king, in a total departure from Seleucid practice in all other places and times, banned a traditional religion.[62] The miracle of the oil is widely regarded as a legend and its authenticity has been questioned since the Middle Ages.[63] However, given the famous question Joseph Karo (1488–1575) posed concerning why Hanukkah is celebrated for eight days when the miracle was only for seven days (since there was enough oil for one day),[64] it was clear that writing in the 16th century CE, he believed it to be a historical event. This belief has been adopted by most of Orthodox Judaism, in as much as Karo's Shulchan Aruch is a main code of Jewish Law. Selected battles between the Maccabees and the Seleucid Syrian-Greeks: Hanukkah is celebrated with a series of rituals that are performed every day throughout the eight-day holiday, some are family-based and others communal. There are special additions to the daily prayer service, and a section is added to the blessing after meals.[79] Hanukkah is not a \"Sabbath-like\" holiday, and there is no obligation to refrain from activities that are forbidden on the Sabbath, as specified in the Shulkhan Arukh.[80][81] Adherents go to work as usual but may leave early in order to be home to kindle the lights at nightfall. There is no religious reason for schools to be closed, although in Israel schools close from the second day for the whole week of Hanukkah.[82][83] Many families exchange gifts each night, such as books or games, and \"Hanukkah Gelt\" is often given to children. Fried foods—such as latkes (potato pancakes), jelly doughnuts (sufganiyot) and Sephardic bimuelos—are eaten to commemorate the importance of oil during the celebration of Hanukkah. Some also have a custom of eating dairy products to remember Judith and how she overcame Holofernes by feeding him cheese, which made him thirsty, and giving him wine to drink. When Holofernes became very drunk, Judith cut off his head.[84] Each night throughout the eight-day holiday, a candle or oil-based light is lit. As a universally practiced \"beautification\" (hiddur mitzvah) of the mitzvah, the number of lights lit is increased by one each night.[85] An extra light called a shammash, meaning \"attendant\" or \"sexton\",[86] is also lit each night, and is given a distinct location, usually higher, lower, or to the side of the others.[81] Among Ashkenazim the tendency is for every male member of the household (and in many families, girls as well) to light a full set of lights each night,[87][88] while among Sephardim the prevalent custom is to have one set of lights for the entire household.[89] The purpose of the shammash is to adhere to the prohibition, specified in the Talmud,[90] against using the Hanukkah lights for anything other than publicizing and meditating on the Hanukkah miracle. This differs from Sabbath candles which are meant to be used for illumination and lighting. Hence, if one were to need extra illumination on Hanukkah, the shammash candle would be available, and one would avoid using the prohibited lights. Some, especially Ashkenazim, light the shammash candle first and then use it to light the others.[91] So altogether, including the shammash, two lights are lit on the first night, three on the second and so on, ending with nine on the last night, for a total of 44 (36, excluding the shammash). It is Sephardic custom not to light the shammash first and use it to light the rest. Instead, the shammash candle is the last to be lit, and a different candle or a match is used to light all the candles. Some Hasidic Jews follow this Sephardic custom as well.[92] The lights can be candles or oil lamps.[91] Electric lights are sometimes used and are acceptable in places where open flame is not permitted, such as a hospital room, or for the very elderly and infirm; however, those who permit reciting a blessing over electric lamps only allow it if it is incandescent and battery operated (an incandescent flashlight would be acceptable for this purpose), while a blessing may not be recited over a plug-in menorah or lamp. Most Jewish homes have a special candelabrum referred to as either a Hanukkah menorah (the traditional name, menorah being Hebrew for 'lamp') or a Chanukiah (the modern Israeli term). Some families use an oil lamp menorah (traditionally filled with olive oil) for Hanukkah; like the candle version, it has eight wicks to light plus the additional shammash light.[93] In the United States, Hanukkah became a more visible festival in the public sphere from the 1970s when Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson called for public awareness and observance of the festival and encouraged the lighting of public menorahs.[94][95][96][97] The reason for the Hanukkah lights is not for the \"lighting of the house within\", but rather for the \"illumination of the house without\", so that passersby should see it and be reminded of the holiday's miracle (i.e. that the sole cruse of pure oil found which held enough oil to burn for one night actually burned for eight nights). Accordingly, lamps are set up at a prominent window or near the door leading to the street. It is customary amongst some Ashkenazi Jews to have a separate menorah for each family member (customs vary), whereas most Sephardi Jews light one for the whole household. Only when there was danger of antisemitic persecution were lamps supposed to be hidden from public view, as was the case in Persia under the rule of the Zoroastrians,[26] or in parts of Europe before and during World War II. However, most Hasidic groups light lamps near an inside doorway, not necessarily in public view. According to this tradition, the lamps are placed on the opposite side from the mezuzah, so people passing through the door are surrounded by the holiness of mitzvot (the commandments).[98] Generally, women are exempt in Jewish law from time-bound positive commandments, although the Talmud requires that women engage in the mitzvah of lighting Hanukkah candles \"for they too were involved in the miracle.\"[99][100] Some Jews in North America and Israel have taken up environmental concerns in relation to Hanukkah's \"miracle of the oil\", emphasizing reflection on energy conservation and energy independence. An example of this is the Coalition on the Environment and Jewish Life's renewable energy campaign.[101][102][103] Hanukkah lights should usually burn for at least half an hour after it gets dark.[104] Many light at sundown, while most Hasidim and many other communities light later, generally around nightfall.[105] Many Hasidic Rebbes light much later to fulfill the obligation of publicizing the miracle by the presence of their Hasidim when they kindle the lights.[106] Inexpensive small wax candles sold for Hanukkah burn for approximately half an hour so should be lit no earlier than nightfall.[104] Friday night presents a problem, however. Since candles may not be lit on Shabbat itself, the candles must be lit before sunset.[104] However, they must remain lit through the lighting of the Shabbat candles. Therefore, the Hanukkah menorah is lit first with larger candles than usual,[104] followed by the Shabbat candles. At the end of the Shabbat, there are those who light the Hanukkah lights before Havdalah and those who make Havdalah before the lighting Hanukkah lights.[107] If for whatever reason one didn't light at sunset or nightfall, the lights should be kindled later, as long as there are people in the streets.[104] Later than that, the lights should still be kindled, but the blessings should be recited only if there is at least somebody else awake in the house and present at the lighting of the Hannukah lights.[108] Typically two blessings (brachot; singular: brachah) are recited during this eight-day festival when lighting the candles. On the first night only, the shehecheyanu blessing is added, making a total of three blessings.[109] The first blessing is recited before the candles are lit, and while most recite the other blessing(s) beforehand as well, some have the custom to recite them after. On the first night of Hanukkah one light (candle or oil) is lit on the right side of the menorah, on the following night a second light is placed to the left of the first but it is lit first, and so on, proceeding from placing candles right to left but lighting them from left to right over the eight nights.[110] Transliteration: Barukh ata Adonai Eloheinu, melekh ha'olam, asher kid'shanu b'mitzvotav v'tzivanu l'hadlik ner Hanukkah. Translation: \"Blessed are You, LORD our God, King of the universe, Who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to kindle the Hanukkah light[s].\" Transliteration: Barukh ata Adonai Eloheinu, melekh ha'olam, she'asa nisim la'avoteinu ba'yamim ha'heim ba'z'man ha'ze. Translation: \"Blessed are You, LORD our God, King of the universe, Who performed miracles for our ancestors in those days at this time...\" After the lights are kindled the hymn Hanerot Halalu is recited. There are several different versions; the version presented here is recited in many Ashkenazic communities:[112] In the Ashkenazi tradition, each night after the lighting of the candles, the hymn Ma'oz Tzur is sung. The song contains six stanzas. The first and last deal with general themes of divine salvation, and the middle four deal with events of persecution in Jewish history, praising God for survival despite these tragedies (the exodus from Egypt, the Babylonian captivity, the miracle of the holiday of Purim, the Hasmonean victory) and expressing a longing for the days when Judea will finally triumph over Rome.[113] The song was composed in the thirteenth century by a poet only known through the acrostic found in the first letters of the original five stanzas of the song: Mordechai. The familiar tune is most probably a derivation of a German Protestant church hymn or a popular folk song.[114] After lighting the candles and Ma'oz Tzur, singing other Hanukkah songs is customary in many Jewish homes. Some Hasidic and Sephardi Jews recite Psalms, such as Psalm 30, Psalm 67, and Psalm 91. In North America and in Israel it is common to exchange presents or give children presents at this time. In addition, many families encourage their children to give tzedakah (charity) in lieu of presents for themselves.[115][116] \"We thank You also for the miraculous deeds and for the redemption and for the mighty deeds and the saving acts wrought by You, as well as for the wars which You waged for our ancestors in ancient days at this season. In the days of the Hasmonean Mattathias, son of Johanan the high priest, and his sons, when the iniquitous Greco-Syrian kingdom rose up against Your people Israel, to make them forget Your Torah and to turn them away from the ordinances of Your will, then You in your abundant mercy rose up for them in the time of their trouble, pled their cause, executed judgment, avenged their wrong, and delivered the strong into the hands of the weak, the many into the hands of few, the impure into the hands of the pure, the wicked into the hands of the righteous, and insolent ones into the hands of those occupied with Your Torah. Both unto Yourself did you make a great and holy name in Thy world, and unto Your people did You achieve a great deliverance and redemption. Whereupon your children entered the sanctuary of Your house, cleansed Your temple, purified Your sanctuary, kindled lights in Your holy courts, and appointed these eight days of Hanukkah in order to give thanks and praises unto Your holy name.\" An addition is made to the \"hoda'ah\" (thanksgiving) benediction in the Amidah (thrice-daily prayers), called Al HaNissim (\"On/about the Miracles\").[118] This addition refers to the victory achieved over the Syrians by the Hasmonean Mattathias and his sons.[119][120][26] The same prayer is added to the grace after meals. In addition, the Hallel (praise) Psalms[121] are sung during each morning service and the Tachanun penitential prayers are omitted.[119][122] The Torah is read every day in the shacharit morning services in synagogue, on the first day beginning from Numbers 6:22 (according to some customs, Numbers 7:1), and the last day ending with Numbers 8:4. Since Hanukkah lasts eight days it includes at least one, and sometimes two, Jewish Sabbaths (Saturdays). The weekly Torah portion for the first Sabbath is almost always Miketz, telling of Joseph's dream and his enslavement in Egypt. The Haftarah reading for the first Sabbath Hanukkah is Zechariah 2:14 – Zechariah 4:7. When there is a second Sabbath on Hanukkah, the Haftarah reading is from 1 Kings 7:40–50. The Hanukkah menorah is also kindled daily in the synagogue, at night with the blessings and in the morning without the blessings.[123] The menorah is not lit during Shabbat, but rather prior to the beginning of Shabbat as described above and not at all during the day. During the Middle Ages \"Megillat Antiochus\" was read in the Italian synagogues on Hanukkah just as the Book of Esther is read on Purim. It still forms part of the liturgy of the Yemenite Jews.[124] The last day of Hanukkah is known by some as Zot Hanukkah and by others as Chanukat HaMizbeach, from the verse read on this day in the synagogue Numbers 7:84, Zot Hanukkat Hamizbe'ach: \"This was the dedication of the altar\". According to the teachings of Kabbalah and Hasidism, this day is the final \"seal\" of the High Holiday season of Yom Kippur and is considered a time to repent out of love for God. In this spirit, many Hasidic Jews wish each other Gmar chatimah tovah (\"may you be sealed totally for good\"), a traditional greeting for the Yom Kippur season. It is taught in Hasidic and Kabbalistic literature that this day is particularly auspicious for the fulfillment of prayers.[125] It is customary for women not to work for at least the first half-hour of the candles' burning, and some have the custom not to work for the entire time of burning. It is also forbidden to fast or to eulogize during Hanukkah.[81] Some Hasidic scholars teach that the Hanukkah is in fact the final conclusion of God's judgment extending High Holy Days of Rosh Hashana when humanity is judged and Yom Kippur when the judgment is sealed: Hanukkah songs (in Hebrew except where indicated) include \"Ma'oz Tzur\" (Rock of Ages), \"Latke'le Latke'le\" (Yiddish: \"Little Latke, Little Latke\"), \"Hanukkiah Li Yesh\" (\"I Have a Hanukkah Menorah\"), \"Ocho Kandelikas\" (Judeo-Spanish: \"Eight Little Candles\"), \"Kad Katan\" (\"A Small Jug\"), \"S'vivon Sov Sov Sov\" (\"Dreidel, Spin and Spin\"), \"Haneirot Halolu\" (\"These Candles Which We Light\"), \"Mi Yimalel\" (\"Who Can Retell\") and \"Ner Li, Ner Li\" (\"I have a Candle\"). Among the best known songs in English-speaking countries are \"Dreidel, Dreidel, Dreidel\"[127] and \"Oh Chanukah\".[128] In the Nadvorna Hasidic dynasty, it is customary for the rebbes to play violin after the menorah is lit.[129] Penina Moise's Hannukah Hymn published in the 1842 Hymns Written for the Use of Hebrew Congregations was instrumental in the beginning of Americanization of Hanukkah.[130][131][132] There is a custom of eating foods fried or baked in oil (preferably olive oil) to commemorate the miracle of a small flask of oil keeping the Second Temple's Menorah alight for eight days.[133] Traditional foods include potato pancakes, known as latkes in Yiddish, especially among Ashkenazi families. Sephardi, Polish, and Israeli families eat jam-filled doughnuts (Yiddish: פּאָנטשקעס pontshkes), bimuelos (fritters) and sufganiyot which are deep-fried in oil. Italkim and Hungarian Jews traditionally eat cheese pancakes known as \"cassola\" or \"cheese latkes\".[134] Latkes are not popular in Israel, having been largely replaced by sufganiyot due to local economic factors, convenience and the influence of trade unions.[135] Bakeries in Israel have popularized many new types of fillings for sufganiyot besides the traditional strawberry jelly filling, including chocolate cream, vanilla cream, caramel, cappuccino and others.[136] In recent years, downsized, \"mini\" sufganiyot containing half the calories of the regular, 400-to-600-calorie version, have become popular.[137] Rabbinic literature also records a tradition of eating cheese and other dairy products during Hanukkah.[138] This custom, as mentioned above, commemorates the heroism of Judith during the Babylonian captivity of the Jews and reminds us that women also played an important role in the events of Hanukkah.[139] The deuterocanonical book of Judith (Yehudit or Yehudis in Hebrew), which is not part of the Tanakh, records that Holofernes, an Assyrian general, had surrounded the village of Bethulia as part of his campaign to conquer Judea. After intense fighting, the water supply of the Jews was cut off and the situation became desperate. Judith, a pious widow, told the city leaders that she had a plan to save the city. Judith went to the Assyrian camps and pretended to surrender. She met Holofernes, who was smitten by her beauty. She went back to his tent with him, where she plied him with cheese and wine. When he fell into a drunken sleep, Judith beheaded him and escaped from the camp, taking the severed head with her (the beheading of Holofernes by Judith has historically been a popular theme in art). When Holofernes' soldiers found his corpse, they were overcome with fear; the Jews, on the other hand, were emboldened and launched a successful counterattack. The town was saved, and the Assyrians defeated.[140] Roast goose has historically been a traditional Hanukkah food among Eastern European and American Jews, although the custom has declined in recent decades.[141] Indian Jews traditionally consume gulab jamun, fried dough balls soaked in a sweet syrup, similar to teiglach or bimuelos, as part of their Hanukkah celebrations. Italian Jews eat fried chicken, cassola (a ricotta cheese latke almost similar to a cheesecake), and fritelle de riso par Hanukkah (a fried sweet rice pancake). Romanian Jews eat pasta latkes as a traditional Hanukkah dish, and Syrian Jews consume Kibbet Yatkeen, a dish made with pumpkin and bulgur wheat similar to latkes, as well as their own version of keftes de prasa spiced with allspice and cinnamon.[142] After lighting the candles, it is customary to play (or spin) the dreidel. The dreidel, or sevivon in Hebrew, is a four-sided spinning top that children play with during Hanukkah. Each side is imprinted with a Hebrew letter which is an abbreviation for the Hebrew words נס גדול היה שם (Nes Gadol Haya Sham, \"A great miracle happened there\"), referring to the miracle of the oil that took place in the Beit Hamikdash. The fourth side of some dreidels sold in Israel are inscribed with the letter פ (Pe), rendering the acronym נס גדול היה פה (Nes Gadol Haya Po, \"A great miracle happened here\"), referring to the fact that the miracle occurred in the land of Israel, although this is a relatively recent[when?] innovation. Stores in Haredi neighborhoods sell the traditional Shin dreidels as well, because they understand \"there\" to refer to the Temple and not the entire Land of Israel, and because the Hasidic Masters ascribe significance to the traditional letters.[143][144] Chanukkah gelt (Yiddish for \"Chanukkah money\"), known in Israel by the Hebrew translation Hebrew: דְּמֵי חֲנֻכָּה, romanized: dmei Hanukkah, is often distributed to children during the festival of Hanukkah. The giving of Hanukkah gelt also adds to the holiday excitement. The amount is usually in small coins, although grandparents or relatives may give larger sums. The tradition of giving Chanukah gelt dates back to a long-standing East European custom of children presenting their teachers with a small sum of money at this time of year as a token of gratitude. One minhag favors the fifth night of Hanukkah for giving Hanukkah gelt.[145] Unlike the other nights of Hanukkah, the fifth does not ever fall on the Shabbat, hence never conflicting with the Halachic injunction against handling money on the Shabbat.[146] The earliest Hanukkah link with the White House occurred in 1951 when Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion presented United States President Harry Truman with a Hanukkah menorah. In 1979 President Jimmy Carter took part in the first public Hanukkah candle-lighting ceremony of the National Menorah held across the White House lawn. In 1989, President George H. W. Bush displayed a menorah in the White House. In 1993, President Bill Clinton invited a group of schoolchildren to the Oval Office for a small ceremony.[95] The United States Postal Service has released several Hanukkah-themed postage stamps. In 1996, the United States Postal Service (USPS) issued a 32 cent Hanukkah stamp as a joint issue with Israel.[147] In 2004, after eight years of reissuing the menorah design, the USPS issued a dreidel design for the Hanukkah stamp. The dreidel design was used through 2008. In 2009 a Hanukkah stamp was issued with a design featured a photograph of a menorah with nine lit candles.[148] In 2008, President George W. Bush held an official Hanukkah reception in the White House where he linked the occasion to the 1951 gift by using that menorah for the ceremony, with a grandson of Ben-Gurion and a grandson of Truman lighting the candles.[149] In December 2014, two Hanukkah celebrations were held at the White House. The White House commissioned a menorah made by students at the Max Rayne school in Israel and invited two of its students to join U.S. President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama as they welcomed over 500 guests to the celebration. The students' school in Israel had been subjected to arson by extremists. President Obama said these \"students teach us an important lesson for this time in our history. The light of hope must outlast the fires of hate. That's what the Hanukkah story teaches us. It's what our young people can teach us – that one act of faith can make a miracle, that love is stronger than hate, that peace can triumph over conflict.\"[150] Rabbi Angela Warnick Buchdahl, in leading prayers at the ceremony commented on the how special the scene was, asking the President if he believed America's founding fathers could possibly have pictured that a female Asian-American rabbi would one day be at the White House leading Jewish prayers in front of the African-American president.[151] The dates of Hanukkah are determined by the Hebrew calendar. Hanukkah begins at the 25th day of Kislev and concludes on the second or third day of Tevet (Kislev can have 29 or 30 days). The Jewish day begins at sunset. Hanukkah dates for recent and upcoming: In 2013, on 28 November, the American holiday of Thanksgiving fell during Hanukkah for only the third time since Thanksgiving was declared a national holiday by President Abraham Lincoln. The last time was 1899, and due to the nature of the Gregorian and Jewish calendars being slightly out of sync with each other, it will not happen again in the foreseeable future.[152] This rare convergence prompted the creation of the neologism Thanksgivukkah.[153][154][155] Major Jewish holidays are those when all forms of work are forbidden, and that feature traditional holiday meals, kiddush, holiday candle-lighting, etc. Only biblical holidays fit these criteria, and Chanukah was instituted some two centuries after the Hebrew Bible was completed. Nevertheless, though Chanukah is of rabbinic origin, it is traditionally celebrated in a major and very public fashion. The requirement to position the menorah, or Chanukiah, at the door or window, symbolizes the desire to give the Chanukah miracle a high-profile.[156] Moreover, Hallel (a set of Psalms expressing praise that is recited on significant Jewish holidays) is recited on all eight days of Hanukkah, which signifies Hanukkah's importance on the Jewish calendar. While not considered the most significant holiday, the recitation of Hallel on Hanukkah highlights its importance in Jewish tradition.[157] Some Jewish historians suggest a different explanation for the rabbinic reluctance to laud the militarism.[clarification needed] First, the rabbis wrote after Hasmonean leaders had led Judea into Rome's grip and so may not have wanted to offer the family much praise. Second, they clearly wanted to promote a sense of dependence on God, urging Jews to look toward the divine for protection. They likely feared inciting Jews to another revolt that might end in disaster, as the Bar Kochba revolt did.[158] \"Hanukkah is an ancient holiday, but a modest one. The holiday of the Hasmoneans is new, yet it is full of spiritual exaltation and national joy. What was Hanukkah forty years ago? 'Al ha-nissim' and Hallel; a short reading in the synagogue; lighting the tiny, slender wax candles or oil lights; at home, levivot [latkes-potato pancakes], cards for the older children, and sevivonim [dreidels-spinning tops] for the little ones. But what is Hanukkah today? The holiday of the Hasmoneans. A holiday of salvation. A great national holiday, celebrated in all the countries of the Diaspora with dances and speeches, melody and song, outings and parades, as if a new soul has been breathed into the ancient holiday, another spirit renewed within it. One thing is clear: if those tiny, modest candles had been extinguished in Diaspora times, if our grandparents had not preserved the traditions of Hanukkah in the synagogue and at home . .., the holiday of the Hasmoneans could never have been created. There would have been nothing to change, nothing to renew. The new soul of our times would not have found a body in which to envelop itself.\" The emergence of Jewish nationalism and the Zionist movement in the late 19th and early 20th centuries had a profound impact on the celebration and reinterpretation of Jewish holidays. These developments resulted in increased emphasis on certain Jewish celebrations, of which Hanukkah and Tu BiShvat are prominent examples.[161] Hanukkah took on renewed meaning following the rise of Jewish nationalism as a nationalist holiday, symbolizing the struggle of the Jewish people against foreign oppression and their desire for national re-creation [162] (although the struggle of Jews against foreign oppression has always been a core componant of Hanukkah, as shown by the Al HaNissim, which has been part of Jewish liturgy since at least 700 CE).[163] Hanukkah served as a common ground where both religious and secular Zionists could unite around their nationalist agenda. Rabbi Shmuel Mohilever, an early religious Zionist, proposed making Hanukkah the official holiday of the proto-Zionist organization Hovevei Zion in Russia in 1881. Public celebrations of Hanukkah gained prominence in the early 20th century, with parades and public events becoming common. Schools in Mandate Palestine played an early role in promoting these celebrations.[164] With the advent of Zionism and the state of Israel, the themes of militarism were reconsidered. In modern Israel, the national and military aspects of Hanukkah became, once again, more dominant.[165][166] In North America, Hanukkah in the 21st century has taken a place equal to Passover as a symbol of Jewish identity. Both the Israeli and North American versions of Hanukkah emphasize resistance, focusing on some combination of national liberation and religious freedom as the defining meaning of the holiday.[167][8] Diane Ashton attributed the increased visibility and reinvention of Hanukkah by some of the American Jewish community as a way to adapt to American life, re-inventing the festival in \"the language of individualism and personal conscience derived from both Protestantism and the Enlightenment\".[130] In North America, Hanukkah became increasingly important to many Jewish individuals and families during the latter part of the 20th century, including a large number of secular Jews, who wanted to celebrate a Jewish alternative to the Christmas celebrations which frequently overlap with Hanukkah.[168][169] Diane Ashton argues that Jewish immigrants to America raised the profile of Hanukkah as a kid-centered alternative to Christmas as early as the 1800s.[170] This in parts mirrors the ascendancy of Christmas, which like Hanukkah increased in importance in the 1800s.[171] During this time period, Jewish leaders (especially Reform) such as Max Lilienthal and Isaac Mayer Wise made an effort to rebrand Hanukkah and started creating Hanukkah celebration for kids at their synagogues, which included candy and singing songs.[170][172] By the 1900s, it started to become a commercial holiday like Christmas, with Hanukkah gifts and decorations appearing in stores and Jewish Women's magazines printing articles on holiday decorations, children's celebrations, and gift giving.[170] Ashton says that Jewish families did this in order to maintain a Jewish identity which is distinct from mainline Christian culture, on the other hand, the mirroring of Hanukkah and Christmas made Jewish families and kids feel that they were American.[170] Though it was traditional for Ashkenazi Jews to give \"gelt\" or money to children during Hanukkah, in many families, this tradition has been supplemented with the giving of other gifts so that Jewish children can enjoy receiving gifts just like their Christmas-celebrating peers do.[173] Children play a big role in Hanukkah, and Jewish families with children are more likely to celebrate it than childless Jewish families, and sociologists hypothesize that this is because Jewish parents do not want their kids to be alienated from their non-Jewish peers who celebrate Christmas.[168] Recent celebrations have also seen the presence of the Hanukkah bush, which is considered a Jewish counterpart to the Christmas tree. Today, the presence of Hanukkah bushes is generally discouraged by most rabbis.[174] In December 2022, New York City Mayor Eric Adams, Reverends Al Sharpton and Conrad Tillard, businessman Robert F. Smith, Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, and Elisha Wiesel joined to celebrate Hanukkah and Kwanzaa together, and combat racism and antisemitism, at Carnegie Hall.[175][176][177][178]",

                "content": "The Jewish Festival of Lights is an eight-day celebration that commemorates the rededication of the Second Temple of Jerusalem. It is one of the most popular holidays in Judaism and is marked by the lighting of the menorah. For many English speakers, the festival is also known for confusion over the spelling of its name: Is it Hanukkah or Chanukah? The answer is that both are considered correct, though Hanukkah is the most widely used spelling, while Chanukah is more traditional. In addition, more than 20 other variations are recorded. Why so many spellings? Transliteration. Hebrew does not use the Latin alphabet, which is the standard script of many languages, including English. Thus, when used in an English context, the sounds of the different Hebrew characters must be converted, or transliterated, into Latin letters. However, the Hebrew word for the holiday uses sounds that aren’t found in the Latin alphabet. The difficulty begins with the very first letter of the word, which is the eighth letter of the Hebrew alphabet—ḥet, or chet. It is pronounced with a guttural sound that is similar to the /ch/ in loch. So, when the Hebrew word was transliterated in the 17th century, the ḥet became ch (Chanukah). However, when the English ch appears at the beginning of a word, it sounds quite different than the Hebrew ḥet (compare loch and chair). Thus, in the 18th century another spelling appeared—Hanukkah—even though the h doesn’t really sound like ḥet either. Transliteration issues also arose over the use of other letters—such as one or two k’s—resulting in many spelling variations.",

Find out why and learn about what people do to celebrate this special holiday. Do the preparation task first. Then read the article and do the exercises. Matching_MjI5Njk= Hanukkah, or the Festival of Lights, is a Jewish celebration. Its date changes from year to year, but it always takes place either in November or December. It lasts for eight days and is celebrated by Jews around the world. The most important part of Hanukkah is the lighting of the menorah (a special candleholder used in Jewish ceremonies). For Hanukkah, there is a special menorah with nine candles. Eight of the candles represent the eight days of the festival. The ninth candle is used to light the other eight. On the first day, only one candle is lit, on the second day, two candles, and so on, until all the candles are lit on the last day. The candles are lit at sunset and should burn for at least half an hour. They are usually put at a door or a window so that people can see them from outside. The festival celebrates when a group of Jews won back a temple from the Greeks in the second century BC. They made a new menorah to replace the one that had been broken. But when they went to light it, they could only find one small bowl of the special oil they needed. There was only enough oil to last one night but they knew it would take them eight days to prepare more. They lit the lamps with the oil on that first night, thinking it would burn for just one night. But the oil lasted for another seven nights and this event gave birth to Hanukkah, the Festival of Lights. Oil is an important part of the Hanukkah celebrations and all kinds of food made with oil are eaten on the eight days. In central and eastern Europe they make latke, fried potato pancakes, that they eat with apple sauce or sour cream. The favourite treat in Israel is sufganiyot (doughnuts filled with strawberry jam). Other popular festival foods include apple cakes and pretzels (bread made in the shape of a knot). Family and friends are very important during the festival. It's traditional to invite people to your home to have dinner and to play games together. The most traditional game is played with a dreidel, a wooden spinning top with four sides. There are four Hebrew letters on the four sides and, depending on which letter your top lands on, you win or lose. The game is usually played with nuts and dried fruit and sweets. Lots of families give presents during the festival, especially to children. These are often games that the whole family can play together or books and other small gifts. It is also a tradition to give money to children (Hanukkah gelt) and to encourage them to donate some of their money to good causes.

Also, we have to clean houses and take a bath. Around 6 or 7 PM after we prepare a table with white tablecloth and putted food (also we put a plate and make a space for the people which died from our family and lit the candle), we all gather, pray, break the scarecrow \"Plotkelė\" and eat in quite. After some time we talk. After we done, we leave the table with the left food which is left for people who died and they could come at night and feel welcomed.

My favourite one is \"The three kings\", the arrival of the three kings is celebrated on 6th January and takes place in Mexico and Spain. It is said that three wise men came to visit and left special gifts to anyone who still believed in this legend. In Mexico, children believe in this story and before this day, they have already written a letter with their best wishes, sometimes this letter is sent by a balloon or by the postman. This tradition is so special because is related to our childhood and makes us feel a little bit nostalgic and cheerful. After opening the gifts in the afternoon everyone is ready to eat and to share the famous \"Three Kings bread\" with hot chocolate. Mexican Parents try to keep this tradition alive due to it is important to dream and desire something special as children always do.

I am likely to write about the holidays or cultural observances that mean the most to you as they occur throughout the year. Please let me know if you want to learn my plans about a holiday that is specifically important to you. Starting Sunday, Dec. 22, and concluding Monday, Dec. 30, millions of individuals and families worldwide will celebrate the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah (sometimes spelled Chanukah). The holiday is widely known as the Festival of Lights. The Hebrew word Chanukah means “dedication,” and this holiday commemorates the rededication of the Holy Temple in Jerusalem. In 164 BC, a band of Jewish fighters called Maccabees, under the command of a man named Judah of the Maccabees, defeated the Greek (Seleucid) army that had captured the city of Jerusalem in 200 BC. Judah and his compatriots reclaimed the Holy Temple in Jerusalem and sought to re-light its menorah (an oil-based candelabrum). They found only enough purified oil to keep the menorah lit for one day. However, the oil kept the menorah alight for 8 days, after which ritually purified oil was available. To commemorate these events, the annual holiday of Hanukkah was created. Similar to the Jewish holiday of Passover, Hanukkah celebrates freedom from oppression. It also supports and celebrates freedom of religious expression. Hanukkah begins on the 25th day of Kislev, the 9th month of the Jewish ecclesiastical year. This date can occur from late November to late December of the Gregorian calendar, which is the civil calendar we follow in the United States. A centerpiece of Hanukkah is the lighting of the menorah. It contains eight candles, plus a central slot for the shamash (“servant”), which is used to light the other eight candles. On the first night of Hanukkah, a single candle is lit. Each succeeding night, an additional candle is lit, so all eight are burning on the final night. Families and friends will often gather and recite traditional blessings or sing songs together as they light the menorah. To commemorate the miraculous oil from which the holiday originated, it is traditional to serve foods fried in oil. Latkes, or potato cakes, are a common food, as are sufganiyot, or jelly donuts. Gifts of money (gelt), other kinds of gifts, or traditional treats such as nuts and raisins, are given to children. Giving to charity is encouraged for children and adults. Another venerated tradition is a game children often play with a dreidel, a four-sided spinner that contains letters of the Hebrew alphabet. The letters are nun, gimmel, hey, and shin, an acronym for “nes gadol hayah sham,” which means “a great miracle happened there.” Each player puts one piece of candy or a penny into the pot, or takes pieces from the pot, depending on their spin of the dreidel. When the dreidel stops spinning, the letter facing up signifies what the player must do. Shin = add one piece to the pot, hey = take half the pot, gimel = take the pot, nun = do nothing. Hanukkah is not specified in the Torah, thus its religious significance is minor for some, but it remains a popular and venerated holiday in Jewish culture. Communities will sometimes gather to light large outdoor menorahs, to sing together, and to share meals. To all who celebrate: Hanukkah sameach! Russ Kavalhuna President President@hfcc.edu",

The interrelationships of ethnicity, language and culture in the Celtic world are unclear and debated;[8] for example over the ways in which the Iron Age people of Britain and Ireland should be called Celts.[5][8][9][10] In current scholarship, 'Celt' primarily refers to 'speakers of Celtic languages' rather than to a single ethnic group.[11] The history of pre-Celtic Europe and Celtic origins is debated. The traditional \"Celtic from the East\" theory, says the proto-Celtic language arose in the late Bronze Age Urnfield culture of central Europe, named after grave sites in southern Germany,[12][13] which flourished from around 1200 BC.[14] This theory links the Celts with the Iron Age Hallstatt culture which followed it (c. 1200–500 BC), named for the rich grave finds in Hallstatt, Austria,[14][15] and with the following La Tène culture (c. 450 BC onward), named after the La Tène site in Switzerland. It proposes that Celtic culture spread westward and southward from these areas by diffusion or migration.[16] A newer theory, \"Celtic from the West\", suggests proto-Celtic arose earlier, was a lingua franca in the Atlantic Bronze Age coastal zone, and spread eastward.[17] Another newer theory, \"Celtic from the Centre\", suggests proto-Celtic arose between these two zones, in Bronze Age Gaul, then spread in various directions.[11] After the Celtic settlement of Southeast Europe in the 3rd century BC, Celtic culture reached as far east as central Anatolia, Turkey. The earliest undisputed examples of Celtic language are the Lepontic inscriptions from the 6th century BC.[18] Continental Celtic languages are attested almost exclusively through inscriptions and place-names. Insular Celtic languages are attested from the 4th century AD in Ogham inscriptions, though they were being spoken much earlier. Celtic literary tradition begins with Old Irish texts around the 8th century AD. Elements of Celtic mythology are recorded in early Irish and early Welsh literature. Most written evidence of the early Celts comes from Greco-Roman writers, who often grouped the Celts as barbarian tribes. They followed an ancient Celtic religion overseen by druids. The Celts were often in conflict with the Romans, such as in the Roman–Gallic wars, the Celtiberian Wars, the conquest of Gaul and conquest of Britain. By the 1st century AD, most Celtic territories had become part of the Roman Empire. By c. 500, due to Romanisation and the migration of Germanic tribes, Celtic culture had mostly become restricted to Ireland, western and northern Britain, and Brittany. Between the 5th and 8th centuries, the Celtic-speaking communities in these Atlantic regions emerged as a reasonably cohesive cultural entity. They had a common linguistic, religious and artistic heritage that distinguished them from surrounding cultures.[19] Insular Celtic culture diversified into that of the Gaels (Irish, Scots and Manx) and the Celtic Britons (Welsh, Cornish, and Bretons) of the medieval and modern periods.[2][20][21] A modern Celtic identity[22] was constructed as part of the Romanticist Celtic Revival in Britain, Ireland, and other European territories such as Galicia.[23] Today, Irish, Scottish Gaelic, Welsh, and Breton are still spoken in parts of their former territories, while Cornish and Manx are undergoing a revival. The first recorded use of the name 'Celts' – as Κελτοί (Keltoi) in Ancient Greek – was by Greek geographer Hecataeus of Miletus in 517 BC,[24] when writing about a people living near Massilia (modern Marseille), southern Gaul.[25] In the fifth century BC, Herodotus referred to Keltoi living around the source of the Danube and in the far west of Europe.[26] The etymology of Keltoi is unclear. Possible roots include Indo-European *kʲel 'to hide' (seen also in Old Irish ceilid, and Modern Welsh celu), *kʲel 'to heat' or *kel 'to impel'.[27] It may come from the Celtic language. Linguist Kim McCone supports this view and notes that Celt- is found in the names of several ancient Gauls such as Celtillus, father of Vercingetorix. He suggests it meant the people or descendants of \"the hidden one\", noting the Gauls claimed descent from an underworld god (according to Commentarii de Bello Gallico), and linking it with the Germanic Hel.[28] Others view it as a name coined by Greeks; among them linguist Patrizia de Bernardo Stempel, who suggests it meant \"the tall ones\".[29] In the first century BC, Roman leader Julius Caesar reported that the Gauls called themselves 'Celts', Latin: Celtae, in their own tongue.[30] Thus whether it was given to them by others or not, it was used by the Celts themselves. Greek geographer Strabo, writing about Gaul towards the end of the first century BC, refers to the \"race which is now called both Gallic and Galatic\", though he also uses Celtica as another name for Gaul. He reports Celtic peoples in Iberia too, calling them Celtiberi and Celtici.[31] Pliny the Elder noted the use of Celtici in Lusitania as a tribal surname,[32] which epigraphic findings have confirmed.[33][34] A Latin name for the Gauls, Galli (pl.), may come from a Celtic ethnic name, perhaps borrowed into Latin during the Celtic expansion into Italy from the early fifth century BC. Its root may be Proto-Celtic *galno, meaning \"power, strength\" (whence Old Irish gal \"boldness, ferocity\", Welsh gallu \"to be able, power\"). The Greek name Γαλάται (Galatai, Latinized Galatae) most likely has the same origin, referring to the Gauls who invaded southeast Europe and settled in Galatia.[35] The suffix -atai might be a Greek inflection.[36] Linguist Kim McCone suggests it comes from Proto-Celtic *galatis (\"ferocious, furious\"), and was not originally an ethnic name but a name for young warrior bands. He says \"If the Gauls' initial impact on the Mediterranean world was primarily a military one typically involving fierce young *galatīs, it would have been natural for the Greeks to apply this name for the type of Keltoi that they usually encountered\".[28] Because Classical writers did not call the inhabitants of Britain and Ireland Κελτοί (Keltoi) or Celtae,[5][8][9] some scholars prefer not to use the term for the Iron Age inhabitants of those islands.[5][8][9][10] However, they spoke Celtic languages, shared other cultural traits, and Roman historian Tacitus says the Britons resembled the Gauls in customs and religion.[11] For at least 1,000 years the name Celt was not used at all, and nobody called themselves Celts or Celtic, until from about 1700, after the word 'Celtic' was rediscovered in classical texts, it was applied for the first time to the distinctive culture, history, traditions, language of the modern Celtic nations – Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Cornwall, Brittany, and the Isle of Man.[37] 'Celt' is a modern English word, first attested in 1707 in the writing of Edward Lhuyd, whose work, along with that of other late 17th-century scholars, brought academic attention to the languages and history of the early Celtic inhabitants of Great Britain.[38] The English words Gaul, Gauls (pl.) and Gaulish (first recorded in the 16–17th centuries) come from French Gaule and Gaulois, a borrowing from Frankish *Walholant, 'Roman-land' (see Gaul: Name), the root of which is Proto-Germanic *walha-, 'foreigner, Roman, Celt', whence the English word Welsh (Old English wælisċ). Proto-Germanic *walha comes from the name of the Volcae,[39] a Celtic tribe who lived first in southern Germany and central Europe, then migrated to Gaul.[40] This means that English Gaul, despite its superficial similarity, is not actually derived from Latin Gallia (which should have produced *Jaille in French),[citation needed] though it does refer to the same ancient region. Celtic refers to a language family and, more generally, means 'of the Celts' or 'in the style of the Celts'. Several archaeological cultures are considered Celtic, based on unique sets of artefacts. The link between language and artefact is aided by the presence of inscriptions.[41] The modern idea of a Celtic cultural identity or \"Celticity\" focuses on similarities among languages, works of art, and classical texts,[42] and sometimes also among material artefacts, social organisation, homeland and mythology.[43] Earlier theories held that these similarities suggest a common \"racial\" (race is now a contested concept) origin for the various Celtic peoples, but more recent theories hold that they reflect a common cultural and linguistic heritage more than a genetic one. Celtic cultures seem to have been diverse, with the use of a Celtic language being the main thing they had in common.[5] Today, the term 'Celtic' generally refers to the languages and cultures of Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Cornwall, the Isle of Man, and Brittany; also called the Celtic nations. These are the regions where Celtic languages are still spoken to some extent. The four are Irish, Scottish Gaelic, Welsh, and Breton; plus two recent revivals, Cornish (a Brittonic language) and Manx (a Goidelic language). There are also attempts to reconstruct Cumbric, a Brittonic language of northern Britain. Celtic regions of mainland Europe are those whose residents claim a Celtic heritage, but where no Celtic language survives; these include western Iberia, i.e. Portugal and north-central Spain (Galicia, Asturias, Cantabria, Castile and León, Extremadura).[44] Continental Celts are the Celtic-speaking people of mainland Europe and Insular Celts are the Celtic-speaking people of the British and Irish islands, and their descendants. The Celts of Brittany derive their language from migrating Insular Celts from Britain and so are grouped accordingly.[45] The Celtic languages are a branch of the Indo-European languages. By the time Celts are first mentioned in written records around 400 BC, they were already split into several language groups, and spread over much of western mainland Europe, the Iberian Peninsula, Ireland and Britain. The languages developed into Celtiberian, Goidelic and Brittonic branches, among others.[46][47] The mainstream view during most of the twentieth century is that the Celts and the proto-Celtic language arose out of the Urnfield culture of central Europe around 1000 BC, spreading westward and southward over the following few hundred years.[14][48][49][50] The Urnfield culture was preeminent in central Europe during the late Bronze Age, circa 1200 BC to 700 BC. The spread of iron-working led to the Hallstatt culture (c. 800 to 500 BC) developing out of the Urnfield culture in a wide region north of the Alps. The Hallstatt culture developed into the La Tène culture from about 450 BC, which came to be identified with Celtic art.[citation needed] In 1846, Johann Georg Ramsauer unearthed an ancient grave field with distinctive grave goods at Hallstatt, Austria. Because the burials \"dated to roughly the time when Celts are mentioned near the Danube by Herodotus, Ramsauer concluded that the graves were Celtic\".[51] Similar sites and artifacts were found over a wide area, which were named the 'Hallstatt culture'. In 1857, the archaeological site of La Tène was discovered in Switzerland.[51] The huge collection of artifacts had a distinctive style. Artifacts of this 'La Tène style' were found elsewhere in Europe, \"particularly in places where people called Celts were known to have lived and early Celtic languages are attested. As a result, these items quickly became associated with the Celts, so much so that by the 1870s scholars began to regard finds of the La Tène as 'the archaeological expression of the Celts'\".[51] This cultural network was overrun by the Roman Empire, though traces of La Tène style were still seen in Gallo-Roman artifacts. In Britain and Ireland, the La Tène style survived precariously to re-emerge in Insular art.[citation needed] The Urnfield-Hallstatt theory began to be challenged in the latter 20th century, when it was accepted that the oldest known Celtic-language inscriptions were those of Lepontic from the 6th century BC and Celtiberian from the 2nd century BC. These were found in northern Italy and Iberia, neither of which were part of the 'Hallstatt' nor 'La Tène' cultures at the time.[11] The Urnfield-Hallstatt theory was partly based on ancient Greco-Roman writings, such as the Histories of Herodotus, which placed the Celts at the source of the Danube. However, Stephen Oppenheimer shows that Herodotus seemed to believe the Danube rose near the Pyrenees, which would place the Ancient Celts in a region which is more in agreement with later classical writers and historians (i.e. in Gaul and Iberia).[52] The theory was also partly based on the abundance of inscriptions bearing Celtic personal names in the Eastern Hallstatt region (Noricum). However, Patrick Sims-Williams notes that these date to the later Roman era, and says they suggest \"relatively late settlement by a Celtic-speaking elite\".[11] In the late 20th century, the Urnfield-Hallstatt theory began to fall out of favour with some scholars, which was influenced by new archaeological finds. 'Celtic' began to refer primarily to 'speakers of Celtic languages' rather than to a single culture or ethnic group.[11] A new theory suggested that Celtic languages arose earlier, along the Atlantic coast (including Britain, Ireland, Armorica and Iberia), long before evidence of 'Celtic' culture is found in archaeology. Myles Dillon and Nora Kershaw Chadwick argued that \"Celtic settlement of the British Isles\" might date to the Bell Beaker culture of the Copper and Bronze Age (from c. 2750 BC).[53][54] Martín Almagro Gorbea (2001) also proposed that Celtic arose in the 3rd millennium BC, suggesting that the spread of the Bell Beaker culture explained the wide dispersion of the Celts throughout western Europe, as well as the variability of the Celtic peoples.[55] Using a multidisciplinary approach, Alberto J. Lorrio and Gonzalo Ruiz Zapatero reviewed and built on Almagro Gorbea's work to present a model for the origin of Celtic archaeological groups in Iberia and proposing a rethinking of the meaning of \"Celtic\".[56] John T. Koch[57] and Barry Cunliffe[58] have developed this 'Celtic from the West' theory. It proposes that the proto-Celtic language arose along the Atlantic coast and was the lingua franca of the Atlantic Bronze Age cultural network, later spreading inland and eastward.[11] More recently, Cunliffe proposes that proto-Celtic had arisen in the Atlantic zone even earlier, by 3000 BC, and spread eastwards with the Bell Beaker culture over the following millennium. His theory is partly based on glottochronology, the spread of ancient Celtic-looking placenames, and thesis that the Tartessian language was Celtic.[11] However, the proposal that Tartessian was Celtic is widely rejected by linguists, many of whom regard it as unclassified.[59][60] Celticist Patrick Sims-Williams (2020) notes that in current scholarship, 'Celt' is primarily a linguistic label. In his 'Celtic from the Centre' theory, he argues that the proto-Celtic language did not originate in central Europe nor the Atlantic, but in-between these two regions. He suggests that it \"emerged as a distinct Indo-European dialect around the second millennium BC, probably somewhere in Gaul [centered in modern France] ... whence it spread in various directions and at various speeds in the first millennium BC\". Sims-Williams says this avoids the problematic idea \"that Celtic was spoken over a vast area for a very long time yet somehow avoided major dialectal splits\", and \"it keeps Celtic fairly close to Italy, which suits the view that Italic and Celtic were in some way linked\".[11] The Proto-Celtic language is usually dated to the Late Bronze Age.[14] The earliest records of a Celtic language are the Lepontic inscriptions of Cisalpine Gaul (Northern Italy), the oldest of which pre-date the La Tène period. Other early inscriptions, appearing from the early La Tène period in the area of Massilia, are in Gaulish, which was written in the Greek alphabet until the Roman conquest. Celtiberian inscriptions, using their own Iberian script, appear later, after about 200 BC. Evidence of Insular Celtic is available only from about 400 AD, in the form of Primitive Irish Ogham inscriptions.[citation needed] Besides epigraphic evidence, an important source of information on early Celtic is toponymy (place names).[61] Arnaiz-Villena et al. (2017) demonstrated that Celtic-related populations of the European Atlantic (Orkney Islands, Scottish, Irish, British, Bretons, Basques, Galicians) shared a common HLA system.[clarification needed][62] Other genetic research does not support the notion of a significant genetic link between these populations, beyond the fact that they are all West Europeans. Early European Farmers did settle Britain (and all of Northern Europe) in the Neolithic; however, recent genetics research has found that, between 2400 and 2000 BC, over 90% of British DNA was overturned by European Steppe Herders in a migration that brought large amounts of Steppe DNA (including the R1b haplogroup) to western Europe.[63] Modern autosomal genetic clustering is testament to this fact, as both modern and Iron Age British and Irish samples cluster genetically very closely with other North Europeans, and less so with Galicians, Basques or those from the south of France.[64][65] The concept that the Hallstatt and La Tène cultures could be seen not just as chronological periods but as \"Culture Groups\", entities composed of people of the same ethnicity and language, had started to grow by the end of the 19th century. At the beginning of the 20th century the belief that these \"Culture Groups\" could be thought of in racial or ethnic terms was held by Gordon Childe, whose theory was influenced by the writings of Gustaf Kossinna.[66] As the 20th century progressed, the ethnic interpretation of La Tène culture became more strongly rooted, and any findings of La Tène culture and flat inhumation cemeteries were linked to the Celts and the Celtic language.[67] In various[clarification needed] academic disciplines the Celts were considered a Central European Iron Age phenomenon, through the cultures of Hallstatt and La Tène. However, archaeological finds from the Halstatt and La Tène culture were rare in Iberia, southwestern France, northern and western Britain, southern Ireland and Galatia[68][69] and did not provide enough evidence for a culture like that of Central Europe. It is equally difficult to maintain that the origin of the Iberian Celts can be linked to the preceding Urnfield culture. This has resulted in a newer theory that introduces a 'proto-Celtic' substratum and a process of Celticisation, having its initial roots in the Bronze Age Bell Beaker culture.[70] The La Tène culture developed and flourished during the late Iron Age (from 450 BC to the Roman conquest in the 1st century BC) in eastern France, Switzerland, Austria, southwest Germany, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary. It developed out of the Hallstatt culture without any definite cultural break, under the impetus of considerable Mediterranean influence from Greek, and later Etruscan civilisations. A shift of settlement centres took place in the 4th century. The western La Tène culture corresponds to historical Celtic Gaul. Whether this means that the whole of La Tène culture can be attributed to a unified Celtic people is difficult to assess; archaeologists have repeatedly concluded that language and material culture do not necessarily run parallel. Frey notes that in the 5th century, \"burial customs in the Celtic world were not uniform; rather, localised groups had their own beliefs, which, in consequence, also gave rise to distinct artistic expressions\".[71] Thus, while the La Tène culture is certainly associated with the Gauls, the presence of La Tène artefacts may be due to cultural contact and does not imply the permanent presence of Celtic speakers.[citation needed] The Greek historian Ephorus of Cyme in Asia Minor, writing in the 4th century BC, believed the Celts came from the islands off the mouth of the Rhine and were \"driven from their homes by the frequency of wars and the violent rising of the sea\". Polybius published a history of Rome about 150 BC in which he describes the Gauls of Italy and their conflict with Rome. Pausanias in the 2nd century AD says that the Gauls \"originally called Celts\", \"live on the remotest region of Europe on the coast of an enormous tidal sea\". Posidonius described the southern Gauls about 100 BC. Though his original work is lost, later writers such as Strabo used it. The latter, writing in the early 1st century AD, deals with Britain and Gaul as well as Hispania, Italy, and Galatia. Caesar wrote extensively about his Gallic Wars in 58–51 BC. Diodorus Siculus wrote about the Celts of Gaul and Britain in his 1st-century history.[citation needed] Diodorus Siculus and Strabo both suggest that the heartland of the people they call Celts was in southern Gaul. The former says that the Gauls were to the north of the Celts, but that the Romans referred to both as Gauls (linguistically the Gauls were certainly Celts). Before the discoveries at Hallstatt and La Tène, it was generally considered that the Celtic heartland was southern Gaul, see Encyclopædia Britannica for 1813.[citation needed] The Romans knew the Celts then living in present-day France as Gauls. The territory of these peoples probably included the Low Countries, the Alps and present-day northern Italy. Julius Caesar in his Gallic Wars described the 1st-century BC descendants of those Gauls.[citation needed] Eastern Gaul became the centre of the western La Tène culture. In later Iron Age Gaul, the social organisation resembled that of the Romans, with large towns. From the 3rd century BC the Gauls adopted coinage. Texts with Greek characters from southern Gaul have survived from the 2nd century BC.[72] Greek traders founded Massalia about 600 BC, with some objects (mostly drinking ceramic vessels) being traded up the Rhône valley. But trade became disrupted soon after 500 BC and re-oriented over the Alps to the Po valley in the Italian peninsula. The Romans arrived in the Rhone valley in the 2nd century BC and encountered a mostly Celtic-speaking Gaul. Rome wanted land communications with its Iberian provinces and fought a major battle with the Saluvii at Entremont in 124–123 BC. Gradually Roman control extended, and the Roman province of Gallia Transalpina developed along the Mediterranean coast.[73][74] The Romans knew the remainder of Gaul as Gallia Comata, 'Long-haired Gaul'.[75] In 58 BC, the Helvetii planned to migrate westward but Julius Caesar forced them back. He then became involved in fighting the various tribes in Gaul, and by 55 BC had overrun most of Gaul. In 52 BC, Vercingetorix led a revolt against Roman occupation but was defeated at the Battle of Alesia and surrendered.[76] Following the Gallic Wars of 58–51 BC, Caesar's Celtica formed the main part of Roman Gaul, becoming the province of Gallia Lugdunensis. This territory of the Celtic tribes was bounded on the south by the Garonne and on the north by the Seine and the Marne.[77] The Romans attached large swathes of this region to neighbouring provinces Belgica and Aquitania, particularly under Augustus.[78] Place- and personal-name analysis and inscriptions suggest that Gaulish was spoken over most of what is now France.[79][80] Until the end of the 19th century, traditional scholarship dealing with the Celts did acknowledge their presence in the Iberian Peninsula[81][82] as a material culture relatable to the Hallstatt and La Tène cultures. However, since according to the definition of the Iron Age in the 19th century Celtic populations were supposedly rare in Iberia and did not provide a cultural scenario that could easily be linked to that of Central Europe, the presence of Celtic culture in that region was generally not fully recognised. Modern scholarship, however, has proven that Celtic presence and influences were most substantial in what is today Spain and Portugal (with perhaps the highest settlement saturation in Western Europe), particularly in the central, western and northern regions.[83][84] In addition to Gauls infiltrating from the north of the Pyrenees, the Roman and Greek sources mention Celtic populations in three parts of the Iberian Peninsula: the eastern part of the Meseta (inhabited by the Celtiberians), the southwest (Celtici, in modern-day Alentejo) and the northwest (Gallaecia and Asturias).[85] A modern scholarly review[86] found several archaeological groups of Celts in Spain: The origins of the Celtiberians might provide a key to understanding the Celticisation process in the rest of the Peninsula. The process of Celticisation of the southwestern area of the peninsula by the Keltoi and of the northwestern area is, however, not a simple Celtiberian question. Recent investigations about the Callaici[91] and Bracari[92] in northwestern Portugal are providing new approaches to understanding Celtic culture (language, art and religion) in western Iberia.[93] John T. Koch of Aberystwyth University suggested that Tartessian inscriptions of the 8th century BC might be classified as Celtic. This would mean that Tartessian is the earliest attested trace of Celtic by a margin of more than a century.[94] In Germany by the late Bronze Age, the Urnfield culture (c. 1300 BC – c. 750 BC) had replaced the Bell Beaker, Unetice and Tumulus cultures in central Europe,[97] whilst the Nordic Bronze Age had developed in Scandinavia and northern Germany. The Hallstatt culture, which had developed from the Urnfield culture, was the predominant Western and Central European culture from the 12th to 8th centuries BC and during the early Iron Age (8th to 6th centuries BC). It was followed by the La Tène culture (5th to 1st centuries BC). The people who had adopted these cultural characteristics in central and southern Germany are regarded as Celts. Celtic cultural centres developed in central Europe during the late Bronze Age (c. 1200 BC until 700 BC). Some, like the Heuneburg, the oldest city north of the Alps,[98] grew to become important cultural centres of the Iron Age in Central Europe, that maintained trade routes to the Mediterranean. In the 5th century BC the Greek historian Herodotus mentioned a Celtic city at the Danube – Pyrene, that historians attribute to the Heuneburg. Beginning around 700 BC (or later), Germanic peoples (Germanic tribes) from southern Scandinavia and northern Germany expanded south and gradually replaced the Celtic peoples in Central Europe.[99][100][101][102][103][104] The Canegrate culture represented the first migratory wave of the proto-Celtic[105][106] population from the northwest part of the Alps that, through the Alpine passes, had already penetrated and settled in the western Po valley between Lake Maggiore and Lake Como (Scamozzina culture). It has also been proposed that a more ancient proto-Celtic presence can be traced back to the beginning of the Middle Bronze Age, when North Westwern Italy appears closely linked regarding the production of bronze artefacts, including ornaments, to the western groups of the Tumulus culture.[107] La Tène cultural material appeared over a large area of mainland Italy,[108] the southernmost example being the Celtic helmet from Canosa di Puglia.[109] Italy is home to Lepontic, the oldest attested Celtic language (from the 6th century BC).[110] Anciently spoken in Switzerland and in Northern-Central Italy, from the Alps to Umbria.[111][112][113][114] According to the Recueil des Inscriptions Gauloises, more than 760 Gaulish inscriptions have been found throughout present-day France – with the notable exception of Aquitaine – and in Italy,[115][116] which testifies the importance of Celtic heritage in the peninsula.[citation needed] In 391 BC, Celts \"who had their homes beyond the Alps streamed through the passes in great strength and seized the territory that lay between the Apennine Mountains and the Alps\" according to Diodorus Siculus. The Po Valley and the rest of northern Italy (known to the Romans as Cisalpine Gaul) was inhabited by Celtic-speakers who founded cities such as Milan.[117] Later the Roman army was routed at the battle of Allia and Rome was sacked in 390 BC by the Senones.[118] At the battle of Telamon in 225 BC, a large Celtic army was trapped between two Roman forces and crushed.[119] The defeat of the combined Samnite, Celtic and Etruscan alliance by the Romans in the Third Samnite War sounded the beginning of the end of the Celtic domination in mainland Europe, but it was not until 192 BC that the Roman armies conquered the last remaining independent Celtic kingdoms in Italy.[citation needed] The Celts also expanded down the Danube river and its tributaries. One of the most influential tribes, the Scordisci, established their capital at Singidunum (present-day Belgrade, Serbia) in the 3rd century BC. The concentration of hill-forts and cemeteries shows a dense population in the Tisza valley of modern-day Vojvodina, Serbia, Hungary and into Ukraine. Expansion into Romania was however blocked by the Dacians.[citation needed] The Serdi were a Celtic tribe[120] inhabiting Thrace. They were located around and founded Serdika (Bulgarian: Сердика, Latin: Ulpia Serdica, Greek: Σαρδῶν πόλις), now Sofia in Bulgaria,[121] which reflects their ethnonym. They would have established themselves in this area during the Celtic migrations at the end of the 4th century BC, though there is no evidence for their existence before the 1st century BC. Serdi are among traditional tribal names reported into the Roman era.[122] They were gradually Thracianized over the centuries but retained their Celtic character in material culture up to a late date.[when?][citation needed] According to other sources they may have been simply of Thracian origin,[123] according to others they may have become of mixed Thraco-Celtic origin. Further south, Celts settled in Thrace (Bulgaria), which they ruled for over a century, and Anatolia, where they settled as the Galatians (see also: Gallic Invasion of Greece). Despite their geographical isolation from the rest of the Celtic world, the Galatians maintained their Celtic language for at least 700 years. St Jerome, who visited Ancyra (modern-day Ankara) in 373 AD, likened their language to that of the Treveri of northern Gaul.[citation needed] For Venceslas Kruta, Galatia in central Turkey was an area of dense Celtic settlement.[citation needed] The Boii tribe gave their name to Bohemia, Bologna and possibly Bavaria, and Celtic artefacts and cemeteries have been discovered further east in what is now Poland and Slovakia. A Celtic coin (Biatec) from Bratislava's mint was displayed on the old Slovak 5-crown coin.[citation needed] As there is no archaeological evidence for large-scale invasions in some of the other areas, one current school of thought holds that Celtic language and culture spread to those areas by contact rather than invasion.[124] However, the Celtic invasions of Italy and the expedition in Greece and western Anatolia, are well documented in Greek and Latin history.[125][126] There are records of Celtic mercenaries in Egypt serving the Ptolemies. Thousands were employed in 283–246 BC and they were also in service around 186 BC. They attempted to overthrow Ptolemy II.[127] All living Celtic languages today belong to the Insular Celtic languages, derived from the Celtic languages spoken in Iron Age Britain and Ireland.[128] They separated into a Goidelic and a Brittonic branch early on. By the time of the Roman conquest of Britain in the 1st century AD, the Insular Celts were made up of the Celtic Britons, the Gaels (or Scoti), and the Picts (or Caledonians).[citation needed] The renown of insular Celts has caused a popular belief that Celtic clans only lived in the British Isles.[129] Linguists have debated whether a Celtic language came to the British Isles and then split, or whether the two branches arrived separately. The older view was that Celtic influence in the Isles was the result of successive migrations or invasions from the European mainland by diverse Celtic-speaking peoples over several centuries, accounting for the P-Celtic vs. Q-Celtic isogloss. This view has been challenged by the hypothesis that the islands' Celtic languages form an Insular Celtic dialect group.[130] In the 19th and 20th centuries, scholars often dated the \"arrival\" of Celtic culture in Britain (via an invasion model) to the 6th century BC, corresponding to archaeological evidence of Hallstatt influence and the appearance of chariot burials in what is now England. Cunliffe and Koch propose in their newer 'Celtic from the West' theory that Celtic languages reached the Isles earlier, with the Bell Beaker culture c.2500 BC, or even before this.[131][132] More recently, a major archaeogenetics study uncovered a migration into southern Britain in the Bronze Age from 1300 to 800 BC.[133] The newcomers were genetically most similar to ancient individuals from Gaul.[133] From 1000 BC, their genetic marker swiftly spread through southern Britain,[134] but not northern Britain.[133] The authors see this as a \"plausible vector for the spread of early Celtic languages into Britain\".[133] There was much less immigration during the Iron Age, so it is likely that Celtic reached Britain before then.[133] Cunliffe suggests that a branch of Celtic was already spoken in Britain, and the Bronze Age migration introduced the Brittonic branch.[135] Like many Celtic peoples on the mainland, the Insular Celts followed an Ancient Celtic religion overseen by druids. Some of the southern British tribes had strong links with Gaul and Belgica, and minted their own coins. During the Roman occupation of Britain, a Romano-British culture emerged in the southeast. The Britons and Picts in the north, and the Gaels of Ireland, remained outside the empire. During the end of Roman rule in Britain in the 400s AD, there was significant Anglo-Saxon settlement of eastern and southern Britain, and some Gaelic settlement of its western coast. During this time, some Britons migrated to the Armorican peninsula, where their culture became dominant. Meanwhile, much of northern Britain (Scotland) became Gaelic. By the 10th century AD, the Insular Celtic peoples had diversified into the Brittonic-speaking Welsh (in Wales), Cornish (in Cornwall), Bretons (in Brittany) and Cumbrians (in the Old North); and the Gaelic-speaking Irish (in Ireland), Scots (in Scotland) and Manx (on the Isle of Man).[citation needed] Classical writers did not call the inhabitants of Britain and Ireland Celtae or Κελτοί (Keltoi),[5][8][9] leading some scholars to question the use of the term 'Celt' for the Iron Age inhabitants of those islands.[5][8][9][10] The first historical account of the islands was by the Greek geographer Pytheas, who sailed around what he called the \"Pretannikai nesoi\" (the \"Pretannic isles\") around 310–306 BC.[136] In general, classical writers referred to the Britons as Pretannoi (in Greek) or Britanni (in Latin).[137] Strabo, writing in Roman times, distinguished between the Celts and Britons.[138] However, Roman historian Tacitus says the Britons resembled the Celts of Gaul in customs and religion.[11] Under Caesar the Romans conquered Celtic Gaul, and from Claudius onward the Roman empire absorbed parts of Britain. Roman local government of these regions closely mirrored pre-Roman tribal boundaries, and archaeological finds suggest native involvement in local government.[citation needed] The native peoples under Roman rule became Romanised and keen to adopt Roman ways. Celtic art had already incorporated classical influences, and surviving Gallo-Roman pieces interpret classical subjects or keep faith with old traditions despite a Roman overlay.[citation needed] The Roman occupation of Gaul, and to a lesser extent of Britain, led to Roman-Celtic syncretism. In the case of the continental Celts, this eventually resulted in a language shift to Vulgar Latin, while the Insular Celts retained their language.[citation needed] There was also considerable cultural influence exerted by Gaul on Rome, particularly in military matters and horsemanship, as the Gauls often served in the Roman cavalry. The Romans adopted the Celtic cavalry sword, the spatha, and Epona, the Celtic horse goddess.[139][140] To the extent that sources are available, they depict a pre-Christian Iron Age Celtic social structure based formally on class and kingship, although this may only have been a particular late phase of organisation in Celtic societies. Patron-client relationships similar to those of Roman society are also described by Caesar and others in the Gaul of the 1st century BC.[citation needed] In the main, the evidence is of tribes being led by kings, although some argue that there is also evidence of oligarchical republican forms of government eventually emerging in areas which had close contact with Rome. Most descriptions of Celtic societies portray them as being divided into three groups: a warrior aristocracy; an intellectual class including professions such as druid, poet, and jurist; and everyone else. In historical times, the offices of high and low kings in Ireland and Scotland were filled by election under the system of tanistry, which eventually came into conflict with the feudal principle of primogeniture in which succession goes to the first-born son.[citation needed] Little is known of family structure among the Celts. Patterns of settlement varied from decentralised to urban. The popular stereotype of non-urbanised societies settled in hillforts and duns,[141] drawn from Britain and Ireland (there are about 3,000 hill forts known in Britain)[142] contrasts with the urban settlements present in the core Hallstatt and La Tène areas, with the many significant oppida of Gaul late in the first millennium BC, and with the towns of Gallia Cisalpina.[citation needed] Slavery, as practised by the Celts, was very likely similar to the better documented practice in ancient Greece and Rome.[143] Slaves were acquired from war, raids, and penal and debt servitude.[143] Slavery was hereditary,[144] though manumission was possible. The Old Irish and Welsh words for 'slave', cacht and caeth respectively, are cognate with Latin captus 'captive' suggesting that the slave trade was an early means of contact between Latin and Celtic societies.[143] In the Middle Ages, slavery was especially prevalent in the Celtic countries.[145] Manumissions were discouraged by law and the word for 'female slave', cumal, was used as a general unit of value in Ireland.[146] There are only very limited records from pre-Christian times written in Celtic languages. These are mostly inscriptions in the Roman and sometimes Greek alphabets. The ogham script, an Early Medieval alphabet, was mostly used in early Christian times in Ireland and Scotland (but also in Wales and England), and was only used for ceremonial purposes such as inscriptions on gravestones. The available evidence is of a strong oral tradition, such as that preserved by bards in Ireland, and eventually recorded by monasteries. Celtic art also produced a great deal of intricate and beautiful metalwork, examples of which have been preserved by their distinctive burial rites.[147] In some regards the Atlantic Celts were conservative: for example, they still used chariots in combat long after they had been reduced to ceremonial roles by the Greeks and Romans. However, despite being outdated, Celtic chariot tactics were able to repel the invasions of Britain attempted by Julius Caesar.[148] According to Diodorus Siculus: The Gauls are tall of body with rippling muscles and white of skin and their hair is blond, and not only naturally so for they also make it their practice by artificial means to increase the distinguishing colour which nature has given it. For they are always washing their hair in limewater and they pull it back from the forehead to the nape of the neck, with the result that their appearance is like that of Satyrs and Pans since the treatment of their hair makes it so heavy and coarse that it differs in no respect from the mane of horses. Some of them shave the beard but others let it grow a little; and the nobles shave their cheeks but they let the moustache grow until it covers the mouth. During the later Iron Age the Gauls generally wore long-sleeved shirts or tunics and long trousers (called braccae by the Romans).[149] Clothes were made of wool or linen, with some silk being used by the rich. Cloaks were worn in the winter. Brooches[150] and armlets were used, but the most famous item of jewellery was the torc, a neck collar of metal, sometimes gold. The horned Waterloo Helmet in the British Museum, which long set the standard for modern images of Celtic warriors, is in fact a unique survival, and may have been a piece for ceremonial rather than military wear.[151] Archaeological evidence suggests that the pre-Roman Celtic societies were linked to the network of overland trade routes that spanned Eurasia. Archaeologists have discovered large prehistoric trackways crossing bogs in Ireland and Germany. Due to their substantial nature, these are believed to have been created for wheeled transport as part of an extensive roadway system that facilitated trade.[152] The territory held by the Celts contained tin, lead, iron, silver and gold.[153] Celtic smiths and metalworkers created weapons and jewellery for international trade, particularly with the Romans.[154] The myth that the Celtic monetary system consisted of wholly barter is a common one, but is in part false. The monetary system was complex and is still not understood (much like the late Roman coinages), and due to the absence of large numbers of coin items, it is assumed that \"proto-money\" was used. This included bronze items made from the early La Tène period and onwards, which were often in the shape of axeheads, rings, or bells. Due to the large number of these present in some burials, it is thought they had a relatively high monetary value, and could be used for \"day to day\" purchases. Low-value coinages of potin, a bronze alloy with high tin content, were minted in most Celtic areas of the continent and in South-East Britain prior to the Roman conquest of these lands. Higher-value coinages, suitable for use in trade, were minted in gold, silver, and high-quality bronze. Gold coinage was much more common than silver coinage, despite being worth substantially more, as while there were around 100 mines in Southern Britain and Central France, silver was more rarely mined. This was due partly to the relative sparsity of mines and the amount of effort needed for extraction compared to the profit gained. As the Roman civilisation grew in importance and expanded its trade with the Celtic world, silver and bronze coinage became more common. This coincided with a major increase in gold production in Celtic areas to meet the Roman demand, due to the high value Romans put on the metal. The large number of gold mines in France is thought to be a major reason why Caesar invaded.[155] Very few reliable sources exist regarding Celtic views on gender roles, though some archaeological evidence suggests their views may have differed from those of the Greco-Roman world, which tended to be less egalitarian.[156][157] Some Iron Age burials in northeastern Gaul suggest women may have had roles in warfare during the earlier La Tène period, but the evidence is far from conclusive.[158] Celtic individuals buried with both female jewellery and weaponry have been found, such as the Vix Grave in northeastern Gaul, and there are questions about the gender of some individuals buried with weaponry. However, it has been suggested that the weapons indicate high social rank rather than masculinity.[159] Most written accounts of the Ancient Celts are from the Romans and Greeks, though it is not clear how accurate these are. Roman historians Ammianus Marcellinus and Tacitus mentioned Celtic women inciting, participating in, and leading battles.[160] Plutarch reports that Celtic women acted as ambassadors to avoid a war among Celtic chiefdoms in the Po valley during the 4th century BC.[161] Posidonius' anthropological comments on the Celts had common themes, primarily primitivism, extreme ferocity, cruel sacrificial practices, and the strength and courage of their women.[162] Cassius Dio suggests there was great sexual freedom among women in Celtic Britain:[163] ... a very witty remark is reported to have been made by the wife of Argentocoxus, a Caledonian, to Julia Augusta. When the empress was jesting with her, after the treaty, about the free intercourse of her sex with men in Britain, she replied: \"We fulfill the demands of nature in a much better way than do you Roman women; for we consort openly with the best men, whereas you let yourselves be debauched in secret by the vilest\". Such was the retort of the British woman. Barry Cunliffe writes that such references are \"likely to be ill-observed\" and meant to portray the Celts as outlandish \"barbarians\".[164] Historian Lisa Bitel argues the descriptions of Celtic women warriors are not credible. She says some Roman and Greek writers wanted to show that the barbarian Celts lived in \"an upside-down world ... and a standard ingredient in such a world was the manly warrior woman\".[165] The Greek philosopher Aristotle wrote in his Politics that the Celts of southeastern Europe approved of male homosexuality. Greek historian Diodorus Siculus wrote in his Bibliotheca historica that although Gaulish women were beautiful, the men had \"little to do with them\" and it was a custom for men to sleep on animal skins with two younger males. He further claimed that \"the young men will offer themselves to strangers and are insulted if the offer is refused\". His claim was later repeated by Greco-Roman writers Athenaeus and Ammianus.[166] H. David Rankin, in Celts and the Classical World, suggests some of these claims refer to bonding rituals in warrior groups, which required abstinence from women at certain times,[167] and says it probably reflects \"the warlike character of early contacts between the Celts and the Greeks\".[168] Under Brehon Law, which was written down in early Medieval Ireland after conversion to Christianity, a woman had the right to divorce her husband and gain his property if he was unable to perform his marital duties due to impotence, obesity, homosexual inclination or preference for other women.[169][170][failed verification] Celtic art is generally used by art historians to refer to art of the La Tène period across Europe, while the Early Medieval art of Britain and Ireland, that is what \"Celtic art\" evokes for much of the general public, is called Insular art in art history. Both styles absorbed considerable influences from non-Celtic sources, but retained a preference for geometrical decoration over figurative subjects, which are often extremely stylised when they do appear; narrative scenes only appear under outside influence. Energetic circular forms, triskeles and spirals are characteristic. Much of the surviving material is in precious metal, which no doubt gives a very unrepresentative picture, but apart from Pictish stones and the Insular high crosses, large monumental sculpture, even with decorative carving, is very rare; possibly it was originally common in wood. Celts were also able to create developed musical instruments such as the carnyces, these famous war trumpets used before the battle to frighten the enemy, as the best preserved found in Tintignac (Gaul) in 2004 and which were decorated with a boar head or a snake head.[171] The interlace patterns that are often regarded as typical of \"Celtic art\" were characteristic of the whole of the British Isles, a style referred to as Insular art, or Hiberno-Saxon art. This artistic style incorporated elements of La Tène, Late Roman, and, most importantly, animal Style II of Germanic Migration Period art. The style was taken up with great skill and enthusiasm by Celtic artists in metalwork and illuminated manuscripts. Equally, the forms used for the finest Insular art were all adopted from the Roman world: Gospel books like the Book of Kells and Book of Lindisfarne, chalices like the Ardagh Chalice and Derrynaflan Chalice, and penannular brooches like the Tara Brooch and Roscrea Brooch. These works are from the period of peak achievement of Insular art, which lasted from the 7th to the 9th centuries, before the Viking attacks sharply set back cultural life.[citation needed] In contrast the less well known but often spectacular art of the richest earlier Continental Celts, before they were conquered by the Romans, often adopted elements of Roman, Greek and other \"foreign\" styles (and possibly used imported craftsmen) to decorate objects that were distinctively Celtic. After the Roman conquests, some Celtic elements remained in popular art, especially Ancient Roman pottery, of which Gaul was actually the largest producer, mostly in Italian styles, but also producing work in local taste, including figurines of deities and wares painted with animals and other subjects in highly formalised styles. Roman Britain also took more interest in enamel than most of the Empire, and its development of champlevé technique was probably important to the later Medieval art of the whole of Europe, of which the energy and freedom of Insular decoration was an important element. Rising nationalism brought Celtic revivals from the 19th century.[citation needed] The Coligny calendar, which was found in 1897 in Coligny, Ain, was engraved on a bronze tablet, preserved in 73 fragments, that originally was 1.48 metres (4 feet 10 inches) wide and 0.9 metres (2 feet 11 inches) high (Lambert p. 111). Based on the style of lettering and the accompanying objects, it probably dates to the end of the 2nd century.[172] It is written in Latin inscriptional capitals, and is in Gaulish. The restored tablet contains 16 vertical columns, with 62 months distributed over 5 years.[citation needed] French archaeologist J. Monard speculated that it was recorded by druids wishing to preserve their tradition of timekeeping in a time when the Julian calendar was imposed throughout the Roman Empire. However, the general form of the calendar suggests the public peg calendars (or parapegmata) found throughout the Greek and Roman world.[173] Tribal warfare appears to have been a regular feature of Celtic societies. While epic literature depicts this as more of a sport focused on raids and hunting rather than organised territorial conquest, the historical record is more of tribes using warfare to exert political control and harass rivals, for economic advantage, and in some instances to conquer territory.[citation needed] The Celts were described by classical writers such as Strabo, Livy, Pausanias, and Florus as fighting like \"wild beasts\", and as hordes. Dionysius said that their:[174] [175] manner of fighting, being in large measure that of wild beasts and frenzied, was an erratic procedure, quite lacking in military science. Thus, at one moment they would raise their swords aloft and smite after the manner of wild boars, throwing the whole weight of their bodies into the blow like hewers of wood or men digging with mattocks, and again they would deliver crosswise blows aimed at no target, as if they intended to cut to pieces the entire bodies of their adversaries, protective armour and all. Polybius (2.33) indicates that the principal Celtic weapon was a long bladed sword which was used for hacking edgewise rather than stabbing. Celtic warriors are described by Polybius and Plutarch as frequently having to cease fighting in order to straighten their sword blades. This claim has been questioned by some archaeologists, who note that Noric steel, steel produced in Celtic Noricum, was famous in the Roman Empire period and was used to equip the Roman military.[176][177] However, Radomir Pleiner, in The Celtic Sword (1993) argues that \"the metallographic evidence shows that Polybius was right up to a point\", as around one third of surviving swords from the period might well have behaved as he describes.[178] In addition to these long bladed slashing swords, spears and specialized javelins were also used.[179] Polybius also asserts that certain of the Celts fought naked: \"The appearance of these naked warriors was a terrifying spectacle, for they were all men of splendid physique and in the prime of life.\"[180] According to Livy, this was also true of the Celts of Asia Minor.[181] Celts had a reputation as head hunters.[182] Paul Jacobsthal says: \"Amongst the Celts the human head was venerated above all else, since the head was to the Celt the soul, centre of the emotions as well as of life itself, a symbol of divinity and of the powers of the other-world.\"[183] Writing in the first century BC, Greek historians Posidonius and Diodorus Siculus said Celtic warriors cut off the heads of enemies slain in battle, hung them from the necks of their horses, then nailed them up outside their homes.[182] Strabo wrote in the same century that Celts embalmed the heads of their most esteemed enemies in cedar oil and put them on display.[182] Roman historian Livy wrote that the Boii beheaded a defeated Roman general after the Battle of Silva Litana, covered his skull in gold, and used it as a ritual cup.[182] Archaeologists have found evidence that heads were embalmed and displayed by the southern Gauls.[184][185] In another example, at the southern Gaulish site of Entremont, there stood a pillar carved with skulls, within which were niches where human skulls were kept, nailed into position.[186] Roquepertuse nearby has similar carved heads and skull niches. Many lone carved heads have been found in Celtic regions, some with two or three faces.[187] Examples include the Mšecké Žehrovice Head and the Corleck Head. Severed heads are a common motif in Insular Celtic myths, and there are many tales in which 'living heads' preside over feasts or speak prophecies.[182][187] The beheading game is a motif in Irish myth and Arthurian legend, most famously in the tale Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, where the Green Knight picks up his own severed head after Gawain has struck it off. There are also many legends in Celtic regions of saints who carry their own severed heads. In Irish myth, the severed heads of warriors are called the mast or nuts of the goddess Macha.[188] Like other European Iron Age societies, the Celts practised a polytheistic religion and believed in an afterlife.[189][190][unreliable source] Celtic religion varied by region and over time, but had \"broad structural similarities\",[189] and there was \"a basic religious homogeneity\" among the Celtic peoples.[191] Because the ancient Celts did not have writing, evidence about their religion is gleaned from archaeology, Greco-Roman accounts, and literature from the early Christian period.[192] The names of over two hundred Celtic deities have survived (see list of Celtic deities), although it is likely that many of these were alternative names, regional names or titles for the same deity.[189] Some deities were venerated only in one region, but others were more widely known.[189] According to Miranda Aldhouse-Green, the Celts were also animists, believing that every part of the natural world had a spirit.[192] The Celts seem to have had a father god, who was often a god of the tribe and of the dead (Toutatis probably being one name for him); and a mother goddess who was associated with the land, earth and fertility[193] (Dea Matrona probably being one name for her). The mother goddess could also take the form of a war goddess as protectress of her tribe and its land.[193] There also seems to have been a male celestial god—identified with Taranis—associated with thunder, the wheel, and the bull.[193] There were gods of skill and craft, such as the pan-regional god Lugus, and the smith god Gobannos.[193] Celtic healing deities were often associated with sacred springs,[193] such as Sirona and Borvo. Other pan-regional deities include the horned god Cernunnos, the horse and fertility goddess Epona, the divine son Maponos, as well as Belenos, Ogmios, and Sucellos.[189][192] Caesar says the Gauls believed they all descended from a god of the dead and underworld.[189] Triplicity is a common theme in Celtic cosmology, and a number of deities were seen as threefold,[194] for example the Three Mothers.[195] Celtic religious ceremonies were overseen by priests known as druids, who also served as judges, teachers, and lore-keepers. Other classes of druids performed sacrifices for the perceived benefit of the community.[196] There is evidence that ancient Celtic peoples sacrificed animals, almost always livestock or working animals. It appears some were offered wholly to the gods (by burying or burning), while some were shared between gods and humans (part eaten and part offered).[197] There is also some evidence that ancient Celts sacrificed humans, and some Greco-Roman sources claim the Gauls sacrificed criminals by burning them in a wicker man.[198] The Romans said the Celts held ceremonies in sacred groves and other natural shrines, called nemetons.[189] Some Celtic peoples built temples or ritual enclosures of varying shapes (such as the Romano-Celtic temple and viereckschanze), though they also maintained shrines at natural sites.[189] Celtic peoples often made votive offerings: treasured items deposited in water and wetlands, or in ritual shafts and wells, often in the same place over generations.[189] Modern clootie wells might be a continuation of this.[199] Most surviving Celtic mythology belongs to the Insular Celtic peoples: Irish mythology has the largest written body of myths, followed by Welsh mythology. These were written down in the early Middle Ages, mainly by Christian scribes. The supernatural race called the Tuatha Dé Danann are believed to represent the main Celtic gods of Ireland. Their traditional rivals are the Fomóire, whom they defeat in the Battle of Mag Tuired.[200] Barry Cunliffe says the underlying structure in Irish myth was a dualism between the male tribal god and the female goddess of the land.[189] The Dagda seems to have been the chief god and the Morrígan his consort, each of whom had other names.[189] One common motif is the sovereignty goddess, who represents the land and bestows sovereignty on a king by marrying him. The goddess Brigid was linked with nature as well as poetry, healing and smithing.[194] Some figures in medieval Insular Celtic myth have ancient continental parallels: Irish Lugh and Welsh Lleu are cognate with Lugus, Goibniu and Gofannon with Gobannos, Macán and Mabon with Maponos, while Macha and Rhiannon may be counterparts of Epona.[201] In Insular Celtic myth, the Otherworld is a parallel realm where the gods dwell. Some mythical heroes visit it by entering ancient burial mounds or caves, by going under water or across the western sea, or after being offered a silver apple branch by an Otherworld resident.[202] Irish myth says that the spirits of the dead travel to the house of Donn (Tech Duinn), a legendary ancestor; this echoes Caesar's comment that the Gauls believed they all descended from a god of the dead and underworld.[189] Insular Celtic peoples celebrated four seasonal festivals, known to the Gaels as Beltaine (1 May), Lughnasa (1 August), Samhain (1 November) and Imbolc (1 February).[189] The Roman invasion of Gaul brought a great deal of Celtic peoples into the Roman Empire. Roman culture had a profound effect on the Celtic tribes which came under the empire's control. Roman influence led to many changes in Celtic religion, the most noticeable of which was the weakening of the druid class, especially religiously; the druids were to eventually disappear altogether. Romano-Celtic deities also began to appear: these deities often had both Roman and Celtic attributes, combined the names of Roman and Celtic deities, or included couples with one Roman and one Celtic deity. Other changes included the adaptation of the Jupiter Column, a sacred column set up in many Celtic regions of the empire, primarily in northern and eastern Gaul. Another major change in religious practice was the use of stone monuments to represent gods and goddesses. The Celts had probably only created wooden cult images (including monuments carved into trees, which were known as sacred poles) before the Roman conquest.[195] While the regions under Roman rule adopted Christianity along with the rest of the Roman empire, unconquered areas of Ireland and Scotland began to move from Celtic polytheism to Christianity in the 5th century. Ireland was converted by missionaries from Britain, such as Saint Patrick. Later missionaries from Ireland were a major source of missionary work in Scotland, Anglo-Saxon parts of Britain, and central Europe (see Hiberno-Scottish mission). Celtic Christianity, the forms of Christianity that took hold in Britain and Ireland at this time, had for some centuries only limited and intermittent contact with Rome and continental Christianity, as well as some contacts with Coptic Christianity. Some elements of Celtic Christianity developed, or retained, features that made them distinct from the rest of Western Christianity, most famously their conservative method of calculating the date of Easter. In 664, the Synod of Whitby began to resolve these differences, mostly by adopting the current Roman practices, which the Gregorian Mission from Rome had introduced to Anglo-Saxon England.[citation needed] Genetic studies on the limited amount of material available suggest continuity between Iron Age people from areas considered Celtic and the earlier Bell Beaker culture of Bronze Age Western Europe.[206][207][208] Like the Bell Beakers, ancient Celts carried a substantial amount of Western Steppe Herders ancestry, which is derived from Yamnaya pastoralists who expanded westwards from the Pontic–Caspian steppe during the late Neolithic and the early Bronze Age and associated with the initial spread of Indo-European languages.[209] This ancestry was particularly prevalent among Celts of Northwest Europe.[208] Examined individuals overwhelmingly carry types of the paternal haplogroup R-M269,[203][204][205] while the maternal haplogroups H and U are frequent.[210][211] These lineages are associated with steppe ancestry.[203][210] The spread of Celts into Iberia and the emergence of the Celtiberians is associated with an increase in north-central European ancestry in Iberia, and may be connected to the expansion of the Urnfield culture.[212] The paternal haplogroup haplogroup I2a1a1a has been detected among Celtiberians.[213] There appears to have been significant gene flow among Celtic peoples of Western Europe during the Iron Age.[214][208] While the Gauls of southern France display genetic links with the Celtiberians, the Gauls of northern France display links with Great Britain and Sweden.[215] Modern populations of Western Europe, particularly those who still speak Celtic languages, display substantial genetic continuity with the Iron Age populations of the same areas.[216][217][218] Geography Organisations",

                "title": "Pronunciation of Celtic: Why are there two ways? | Merriam-Webster",
                "content": "Celtic refers to Irish culture and heritage, along with the historical people who migrated from the British Isles throughout much of Europe. While the early pronunciation was with an /s/ sound, reflecting its nearest origin in French, the modern standard is a hard \"c\" sound like /k/. This is because language historians desired the word to better reflect its Greek and Classical Latin origins. The soft \"c\" sound is usually reserved for sports teams now, like the Boston Celtics. Be it in the pub or in the halls of academia, whenever the topic of Irish culture, language, music, literature—basically, anything Irish—is brought up, the words Celt and Celtic are bound to be heard. In modern-day English, those words are commonly used in reference to the Irish people and their widely-accepted traditions (of course everybody is Irish on St. Patrick's Day; the Celtic cross or knot is a popular tattoo; the Claddagh ring makes a nice gift). The \\k\\ pronunciation for Celt and Celtic dates to the 18th century. The \\k\\ pronunciation for Celt and Celtic dates to the 18th century. The \\k\\ pronunciation for Celt and Celtic dates to the 18th century. The etymology of the noun Celt—from which the adjective Celtic is derived—is straightforward. It's a 16th-century borrowing of the French word Celte, which itself is from Latin Celta, the singular of Celtae, which is the name for a member of an early Indo-European people from antiquity who spread over much of Europe from the British Isles and Spain to Asia Minor. The Latin name is derived from Greek Keltoi, and both the Latin and Greek words referred to the Gauls, the Celtic people who occupied the region that is now France and Belgium. See? Straightforward. With that history laid out, we're wondering how you pronounced all the capital 'c' and 'k' words, especially if you're unfamiliar with French, Latin, Greek, and even English Celt and Celtic, for that matter. The question: is the 'c' sounded \\s\\ or \\k\\? Following its French and Latin predecessors, early pronunciation of Celt was actually \\SELT\\. (In French and Latin, the 'c' is pronounced \\s\\, as in the last name of the French painter Paul Cézanne and in Latin century.) The pronunciation \\KELT\\ started being heard as early as the 18th century, which, in time, ushered in the variant spelling Kelt. The variants were introduced by language and history academics who believed that the pronunciation of Celt should reflect the initial \\k\\ sound in the ancient Greek Keltoi and the Classical Latin Celtae. (It wasn't until the Middle Ages that the letter 'c' in Latin began being pronounced before vowels as the combination \\ts\\—prior, it was pronounced \\k\\; English speakers subsequently reduced the Latin 'c' to a simple \\s\\.) Outside of academia, the variant Kelt never caught on, and it is rarely if ever used today; however, the \\k\\ pronunciation for Celt and Celtic has since flourished. Another influence on pronouncing Celt and Celtic with a soft 'c' is English's phonetic rule for 'c' when followed by 'e' (or 'i,' as in circus or Cicero), which says that, in such cases, the 'c' is usually pronounced as \\s\\. Think cell, cereal, ceiling, and dance. Nevertheless, English speakers, especially those who wanted to sound knowledgeable about things Celtic, grew to prefer the hard 'c' pronunciation, which harkened back to the words' ancient roots. From the 18th century onward, more and more people began sounding the words with an initial \\k\\. By the mid-20th century, \\k\\ became the norm, which is fitting since the pronunciation is in line with that of the Celtic family of languages that include Irish, Scottish Gaelic, Welsh, Breton, and the now-extinct (or, depending on who you talk to, nearly extinct) languages Manx and Cornish. Apparently, people appreciated the ethnic pronunciation. This shift in the pronunciation of Celt is fully evinced when comparing H. W. Fowler's 1926 Dictionary of Modern English with Robert Burchfield's 1996 revised edition. Here's what Fowler had to say about Celt(ic): \"The spelling C-, & the pronunciation s-, are the established ones, & no useful purpose seems to be served by the substitution of k-.\" Decades later, Burchfield observes a different trend: \"Except for the football club Celtic (in Glasgow), which is pronounced [SEL-tik], both Celt and Celtic are pronounced with initial \\k\\ in standard English.\" Burchfield is referring to the Scottish Celtic Football Club, founded in 1887. In America, there is basketball's Boston Celtics, founded in 1946, whose name is also pronounced with an initial \\s\\. The European away support that Celtic enjoys is phenomenal. Few clubs have a fanbase that travels in such numbers or makes as much noise, all the more remarkable when you consider the poor record that the club has away from home in recent times.— Liam Kelly, The Celtic Star, 20 Feb. 2020 Aside from this use of the initial soft 'c' in sports teams' names, Celtic with a hard 'c' is the standard; however, you might still sometimes hear the 'c' softly sounded by those who are uninitiated in the history and etymology of Celt and Celtic as well as those who are unfamiliar with the words and resort to the phonetic rules of English. (And, as happens so often in English, those phonetic rules let them down.) See Definitions and Examples » Get Word of the Day daily email! Learn a new word every day.

                "title": "Why don't we pronounce the Boston Celtics with a hard 'C'?",
                "content": "By Conor Ryan Bostonians have a notorious track record of forging their own path when it comes to pronunciations and labels. The accent sure doesn’t do us any favors, most notably when adding R’s that shouldn’t be there onto the end of words. And we’re also at the epicenter of a region that has christened new terms such as “bubblah,” “frappe,” “jimmies,” “packie,” and “parlor.” Thankfully, though, our trademark drawl doesn’t severely reshuffle our pronunciation of the Red Sox, Patriots, Bruins, or Celtics. But what about the start of the word “Celtics”? Since Walter A. Brown first founded the Celtics in 1946, we’ve always referred to them as the “Sel-tics,” following a similar script as another sports franchise in Celtic F.C. in Glasgow. The avenue of pronunciation has been ingrained in Bostonians since the days of Bill Russell, Bob Cousy, and Tommy Heinsohn. But anyone familiar with the culture rooted in the Emerald Isle knows that the “Seltic” diction more or less stands as an outlier, especially beyond the realm of sports. So why is there a discrepancy in terms of the pronunciation of “Celtic” — and are the Boston “Seltics” just another example of Bostonians (and Glasgow residents) taking an established linguistic practice and tossing it out the window? To seek some clarity on which pronunciation is correct, we spoke with professor Catherine McKenna, the Margaret Brooks Robinson Professor of Celtic Languages and Literatures at Harvard University. The verdict? “It’s just a distinction,” she said. “You could say in a sense that the K- sound is more correct. But it’s not a big deal.” In terms of basic English phonology, the “Keltic” method stands as a deviation from the standard pronunciation of other English words that begin with “ce” — with words like ceiling, cereal, and cement all beginning with that “soft” C sound. But the origins of the word “Celtic” were set in the ground long before English took hold, as McKenna notes. “In academia, we say ‘Keltic,’ because we first get the word — it first occurs in Greek, and it’s spelled with a Kappa, with a K,” she said. “So we know they said Keltoi, and then we get it from Julius Caesar, spelled with a C, but we know that Latin at that point would have said Celtae (with a hard C pronunciation). “So that’s the way it is. That’s the name. We also know that the Celtic languages always use C to spell the ‘Kuh’ sound, not a ‘Sa’ sound. So that takes care of, yes, technically, ‘Keltic’ is correct.” Even though both the Greek Keltoi and Latin Celtae might appear different, Merriam-Webster notes in their breakdown on the differences between the “Celtic” pronunciation that it wasn’t until the Middle Ages that the letter C in Latin started to be pronounced before vowels as the combination \\ts\\. Before that, they stuck with that hard C sound. However, things started to change when the Celts resurfaced in history, especially as other languages started to take hold across the globe. “But what happens is, we know about Celts in ancient times from the fifth century BC, right through sort of the second or third century,” McKenna explained. “And then they kind of disappear from history until the 18th century. And when the idea of ‘Keltic’ or ‘Seltic’ comes back, it comes back strong, first of all, in France. So they write C-E-L-T-I-Q-U-E, because that’s how you would pronounce it in French. “So then that gets picked up in English — in England and Ireland and Scotland — and everybody is saying ‘Seltic,’ right? So that’s what gets picked up in Glasgow. Celtic (F.C.) goes back to the late 19th century … And then there’s a New York Celtics team that dies out and then Boston sort of picks up that name because of the Irish heritage and so on. And by that time, ‘Seltic’ is really common.” That resurfacing of the “Celtic” word in French offered up the deviation that we now find in basketball and soccer. As is the case with the pronunciation of French painter Paul Cézanne (say-ZAN) or the classic phrase “c’est la vie,” those start with the soft C, rather than the hard “Kuh” sound. At one point, the “Seltic” pronunciation was viewed as the established pronunciation, as noted by Merriam-Webster. This shift in the pronunciation of Celt is fully evinced when comparing H. W. Fowler’s 1926 Dictionary of Modern English with Robert Burchfield’s 1996 revised edition. Here’s what Fowler had to say about Celt(ic): “The spelling C-, & the pronunciation s-, are the established ones, & no useful purpose seems to be served by the substitution of k-.” Decades later, Burchfield observes a different trend: “Except for the football club Celtic (in Glasgow), which is pronounced [SEL-tik], both Celt and Celtic are pronounced with initial \\k\\ in standard English.” Ultimately, the “Keltic” pronunciation has resurfaced in recent times as language historians opted for the word to better reflect its origins in Greek and Classical Latin. But there is no major gaffe or faux pas found in opting for the French-based, “Seltic” pronunciation that was commonly accepted for centuries. As McKenna notes, “it’s not a big deal.” So we’ve broken down the origin of the word “Celtic” and its different pronunciations. But what about the origin of the Boston Celtics’ name itself? Referencing former Boston Herald Traveler sportswriter George Sullivan’s comprehensive account of the Celtics’ first 50 years, Richard Johnson — curator of The Sports Museum — revealed that Walter Brown didn’t exactly need to delve very deep for inspiration. “[Sullivan] talked to Howie McHugh, who was the first publicist of the team. And the quote from Howie, who was there at the time — Walter Brown said, ‘Wait, I’ve got it: The Celtics. We’ll call them the Boston Celtics. The name has a great basketball tradition. And Boston is full of Irishmen. Yes, that’s it. We’ll put them in green uniforms and call them the Boston Celtics.’” It shouldn’t come as much surprise that Brown honed in on the Irish-American populace in Boston. But as McKenna noted earlier, the Celtics also paid homage to another basketball club when it came to their appointed moniker. “Celtics also refers to the team, the Original Celtics, who were a team that played out of New York City in the barnstorming days of professional basketball,” Johnson noted. “So for once, we appropriated something from New York from a sporting standpoint instead of it being the other way around. “So they named their team both as a practical measure — because of this being a very Irish-American hotbed, and then the fact that there was a team not too long before that, probably 20 years before the founding of the Celtics, that were the Original Celtics. So it worked.” Well, that answers that. As for why Boston’s baseball team is called the “Red Sox” instead of the “Red Socks”? Well, that’s a Wickedpedia piece for another day.
