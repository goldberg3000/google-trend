                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Through 30 minutes of football, the San Francisco 49ers and Los Angeles Rams are tied 3-3 on Thursday night in a football matchup that's been significantly impacted by weather in the first half. The Rams defense forced a three-and-out to start things off and the 49ers defense responded by forcing L.A. to go three-and-out as well. The first two possessions were a sign of things to come, as the two have swapped punts for the majority of this matchup. There have been 11 punts -- the most in a first half in any NFL game this season -- and no trips to the red zone for either team. The Niners were first on the board, thanks to a 53-yard field goal from Jake Moody. It took until nearly the end of the second quarter, but the Rams responded with a field goal of their own, a 48-yarder from Joshua Karty. The play of the game thus far goes to Puka Nacua, who pulled a David Tyree by catching a pass with the help of a helmet. He completed the catch by putting the ball against 49ers cornerback Charvarius Ward's helmet. Stay tuned for more updates from the second half of a close divisional prime-time matchup. For the first time tonight, a team has reached the red zone. The Rams are in the midst of their best drive of the game, having picked up over 50 yards on this possession. The Rams didn't get to the 49ers' 37-yard line just to kick a field goal. Sean McVay keeps his offense on the field on fourth-and-1, and Stafford pushes up the middle for two yards. Stafford's Over/Under for rushing yards was 0.5. He has 13 rushing yards now. Deebo Samuel with an absolutely HORRIFIC drop on third-and-10. It would have been a first down. Instead Jake Moody comes on to hit a 47-yard field goal. 49ers retake the lead after going 34 yards on nine plays. SF 6 LAR 38:23 remaining in the third quarter 49ers have already picked up three first downs on their first possession of the third quarter. They are in field goal range. The Rams offense didn't improve after the halftime break, as Stafford's unit went three-and-out to begin the third quarter. Kyren Williams picked up five yards on two straight carries, but Stafford just threw the ball away on third-and-5. Rolling right, he decided not to take a chance for one of his receivers. Was a little puzzling, but nothing was open downfield. 6 points, 11 punts, 9 first downs, 0 TD, 0 turnovers First downs: LAR 4 SF 5Third downs: LAR 2-8 SF 2-9Total yards: LAR 89 SF 108TOP: LAR 15:35 SF 14:25Punts: LAR 5 SF 6 Matthew Stafford 4/12 23 yardsBrock Purdy 9/19 96 yards Kyren Williams 14 rushes 44 yardsIsaac Guerendo 8 rushes 17 yardsDeebo Samuel 2 rushes 3 yards Puka Nacua 3 catches 19 yardsKyren Williams 1 catch 4 yardsGeorge Kittle 2 catches 43 yardsJauan Jennings 2 catches 31 yardsDeebo Samuel 3 catches 16 yards Kobie Turner 6 total tackles, 2 sacksDre Greenlaw (first game this year) 9 total tackles 49ers go three-and-out, picking up six yards on three plays. There's 29 seconds remaining in the second quarter, so I'm not sure Stafford and Co. can get anything going at their own 22-yard line. The 49ers have three timeouts, and are going fast trying to get down the field into scoring position. Rams get the ball to start the second half. The Rams are finally on the board thanks to the right leg of Joshua Karty. He's good from 48 yards out -- successfully capping a 20-yard, seven-play drive for the Rams. Both teams are now 2-8 on third downs. LAR 3 SF 31:05 remaining in the second quarter Kobie Turner's second sack of the game ends the 49ers drive. He's been a monster in this one: 5 tackles and 2 sacks. Rams have great field position at the 50-yard line with just over four minutes remaining in the first half. A 10-yard completion to Kittle moves the chains for the 49ers on third-and-8. Kittle has two catches for 43 yards. Something to note: Matthew Stafford has been high on multiple throws so far. The rain may be playing a role in that. 49ers star linebacker Fred Warner has returned to the game after exiting earlier in the opening quarter From CBS Sports Research: The Rams had zero first downs in their first four drives for the first time since 2013 The 49ers converted the first third down of the game thanks to an 18-yard Jauan Jennings catch on a third-and-9, but the 20-yard, six-play drive came to an end at midfield for San Francisco. SF 3 LAR 012:58 remaining in the second quarter The Rams and 49ers are a combined 0-8 on third downs! Here comes the seventh punt of the game with 1:23 remaining in the first quarter. According to CBS Sports Research, the seven punts are the most in a first quarter in any game this season. Rain playing a factor. The 49ers star linebacker has left the game after being twisted down awkwardly. Remember, he's playing through a broken bone in his ankle. The Rams punted just twice all game vs. the Buffalo Bills last week. Ethan Evans has already had to punt thrice in this matchup. Move over David Tyree, check out this helmet catch from Puka! The 49ers are on the board thanks to a Moody 53-yard field goal kicked on fourth-and-4. The George Kittle 33-yard catch made up most of that five-play, 39-yard drive. SF 3 LAR 010 minutes remaining in the first quarter First big play of the game goes to Mr. George Kittle streaking across the middle of the field Not a high-flying start in this divisional affair! Kyren Williams picked up five yards on his first carry, then an Alaric Jackson holding penalty moved the Rams back 10 yards. Stafford missed on his next two pass attempts (both to Kupp) and the Rams had to punt the ball away. Purdy's first pass attempt to Samuel fell incomplete on first down, Guerendo rushed for 1 yard on second down and Purdy overthrew Kittle deep left on third down. A bad start for the SF offense. The 49ers went straight to Deebo Samuel on a slant off play action on first-and-10 following his complaints. Incomplete. LAR: 6-7 ATS, Over is 7-6SF: 5-8 ATS, Over is 7-6 Sean McVay: 23-11 SU, 23-10-1 ATS in December in coaching career The Rams are 0-4 SU & ATS on the road in prime time since 2022 The 49ers are 0-4 ATS in their last four home divisional games, but are 4-0 SU & ATS in the last four games on Thursday Both teams, and even some of their children, showing love to the Levi's Stadium fans: © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive.

                "content": "NFL Advertisement live Updated 59s ago Register for The Athletic — our Rams and 49ers reporters will provide up-to-the-minute news, analysis and updates on their respective teams. The Rams (7-6), looking to stay in the NFC playoff picture, are tied at halftime against the 49ers (6-7) on \"Thursday Night Football.\" How to watch: Prime Video Get the best ticket deals on Stubhub. This Rams drive is the first red zone possession for either team tonight. Advertisement Q3 3:22 Rams 3, 49ers 6 Puka Nacua comes underneath on second-and-10 on the slant route to complete the 13-yard reception. First down Rams! The drive stays alive. Q3 5:06 Rams 3, 49ers 6 On fourth-and-1, Matthew Stafford sneaks forward to pick up the first down. Massive fourth-down conversion for the Rams! Los Angeles' drive keeps going in San Francisco territory. To get an idea of just how bad the fantasy scoring has been in this game, note that San Francisco kicker Jake Moody’s nine points leads all players. Dee Winters, not Dre Greenlaw, was in at weak side LB in the 49ers' first defensive possession of the second half. We reported earlier today that Greenlaw would be on a snap count tonight as he was eased back onto the field, and that still appears to be the case even after a team-high nine tackles in the first half. Moody hit another field goal, this one from 47 yards, but the big (non-) play was a third-down drop by Deebo Samuel. Brock Purdy’s pass was on target as Samuel cut across the field but he may have tried to take off before the pass was secure. A reception would have resulted in a first down and a possible touchdown. Fullback Kyle Juszczyk was a potential downfield blocker on the play. Advertisement Q3 8:23 Rams 3, 49ers 6 Brock Purdy, on third-and-10 from the Rams 29, throws a perfect pass to Deebo Samuel on the slant route. But the 49ers receiver drops the catchable ball. The 49ers settle for a field goal as Jake Moody hits a 47-yarder through the uprights. San Francisco retakes the lead! Q3 10:33 Rams 3, 49ers 3 Brock Purdy sneaks up the middle for three yards on third-and-1 to get the first down. San Francisco's drive keeps going. Q3 12:00 Rams 3, 49ers 3 Brock Purdy slings a pass to Isaac Guerendo on the flat, who runs for 11 yards to get the first down. The 49ers are moving down the field and in Rams territory. According to the Amazon Prime Vision alt-cast, Matthew Stafford was 0-for-5 passing when pressured in the pocket in the first half, and just missed another throw when flushed out of the pocket on the first drive of the third quarter. Let's see if the 49ers can continue turning up the heat on Stafford with their four-man rush. Q3 13:29 Rams 3, 49ers 3 The 49ers rush four on third-and-5. Matthew Stafford scrambles and can't find anyone to throw to, so passes it out of bounds. The Rams have a three-and-out, punt 46 yards back to San Francisco. The 49ers start at their 37-yard line. Advertisement Q3 15:00 Rams 3, 49ers 3 The second half is underway with the Rams getting the ball. For the moment, the rain stopped at Levi's Stadium. Getty Images Six first-half points is the lowest-scoring half of a Rams-49ers game since 2009. Getty Images The 49ers started this game as a 3-point favorite at BetMGM. With the score tied 3-3, San Francisco starts the second half as a 1.5-point favorite. The over/under started at 49 points and is now down to 28.5 points. This shows the betting public still expects some scoring in the second half, but don’t be surprised if that number plummets if there isn’t an early score in the third quarter. The most fatigued of any player in the first half of Thursday night’s game? It had to be Rams punter Ethan Evans, who punted five times in the first two quarters. The Rams had four consecutive offensive drives without a first down. What started as a light mist turned into a much steadier rainfall as the second quarter continued, and both offenses struggled to sustain drives. Sean McVay avoided a second first-half shutout this season (Week 13 at New Orleans) when kicker Josh Karty hit a 48-yard field goal, impressive off a high snap and in the rain. Defensive lineman and team captain Kobie Turner was a bright spot for the Rams in the first half, with six tackles and two sacks (both sacks on third down). The Rams: Three points, 89 net yards, ran 30 plays, punted five times. The 49ers: Three points, 108 net yards, ran 31 plays, punted six times. Halftime! With 80-year-old sportscasting legend Al Michaels’ contract expiring at the end of the season, both he and Amazon Prime Video are expecting him to return next year, sources briefed on the discussions told The Athletic. Michaels’ original three-year deal that pays him in the neighborhood of Joe Buck’s $15 million per season ESPN contract concludes after this year. Prime Video has an opening round playoff game this year that Michaels and his game analyst Kirk Herbstreit are scheduled to call. Read more below. GO FURTHER Amazon Prime expecting Al Michaels to return on year-by-year basis after contract expires at end of season: Sources Advertisement The 49ers were counting on a big emotional lift on defense from Dre Greenlaw’s return and they’ve gotten that – plus a strong performance from Greenlaw. The linebacker, playing his first game since rupturing an Achilles tendon in the Super Bowl, leads the 49ers with 10 tackles at halftime. To put that in perspective, the next highest count for a 49er is four for fellow linebacker Fred Warner. Another recent returnee, Talano Hufanga, also has added a spark to a 49ers defense that has forced five punts and held the Rams to 81 yards. Greenlaw supposedly is on a pitch count in the game. But he’s only come off the field occasionally in a half in which the Rams ran 30 plays. Both Greenlaw and Hufanga are scheduled to be free agents in March, which makes tonight’s prime-time game a good showcase for them.

Kenneth P: C'mon Shanahan. Under center, play action, throw for the end zone. ... Never mind. Andrew R: Wouldn’t mind seeing Purdy take off on some runs. Zigr11: We need some rhythm on offense.

                "content": "The Game Awards 2024 has arrived and is set to once again not only celebrate the best games of the past year, but also give fans an exciting glimpse of the future of video games. Anything can happen at The Game Awards, and we're here to gather all the biggest and best announcements, trailers, reveals, and more from one of the biggest shows of the year! We'll also be updating this roundup throughout the show, so make sure to keep refreshing and checking back! We're also updating our The Game Awards 2024 Winners list live so you can see who takes home the biggest honors of the night! CD Projekt Red has officially unveiled The Witcher 4 with a gorgeous six-minute trailer that puts Ciri center stage as the new protagonist instead of Geralt of Rivia. While we didn't get a release date or window, we did learn the trailer was pre-rendered in a custom build of Unreal Engine 5 and that it will indeed still be a single-player game. IGN has a ton more coverage of The Witcher 4 for you to check out right now, including a look inside the game's development, why CD Projekt chose Ciri over Geralt, 12 vital trailer details, the lore you need to know about the game, and how the studio plans to avoid a Cyberpunk 2077-esque launch disaster this time around. It turns out our adventures in the Lands Between are not over as FromSoftware has just announced Elden Ring Nightreign - a standalone co-op spin-off set in a world parallel to Elden Ring. The game will let players team up with up to two friends and explore a condensed map of Elden Ring's Limgrage area, which will be infested with random enemies and structures at the start of each session. Elden Ring Nightreign will be released on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC in 2025. To help with the wait, we're excited to reveal more with our exclusive hands-on preview of Elden Ring: Nightreign. You can also read our interview with game director Junya Ishizaki to learn why this game exists, if George R.R. Martin was involved, and why fans shouldn't think of this as a live service game. Fumito Ueda, the developer best known for such games as Ico and Shadow of the Colossus, has revealed a first look at his next project, which is codenamed Project Robot. The quick look at this project was a stunning one, with a person climbing a humanoid mech as a distorted voice counted down the time until a shockwave hit. Right before the shockwave did arrive, the player entered the mech's head and disconnected it from its body to avoid certain death. There is no release window or further details as of yet, but it's an exciting look at a project that will surely capture the hearts and minds of many when it is released. It Takes Two developer Hazelight Studios has officially unveiled Split Fiction at The Game Awards. This new adventure is once again a split-screen co-op title, but this time it stars two aspiring writers who wind up inside the same simulation of one of their stories. Each level will jump between a sci-fi world and a fantasy world, and the pair will need to figure out how to escape through \"the very worlds they created.\" Split Fiction will be releaed on March 6, 2025, and you can check out our hands-on preview of Split Fiction right here to learn more. After years of fan outcry, Capcom is finally bringing back Onimusha in 2026. While we didn't get to see too much of the game, fans of Onimusha were treated to a look at the new adventure that will be here before we know it. After a bit of a hiatus, The Outer Worlds 2 has returned with the gift of a brand-new gameplay trailer and a confirmation that it will be released on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC in 2025. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is officially headed to PC on January 23, 2025, which will end up being less than a year from its launch on PS5. The PC version will include numerous enhancements over its console counterpart and will obviously open the door to mods and more. Gearbox Software has revealed the first gameplay footage of Borderlands 4, which included an epic battle, Claptrap, a potential look at the playable characters, and much more. The Game Awards was the place that confirmed Virtua Fighter is officially coming back and that fans can learn a ton more on a dedicated showcase that will take place tomorrow, December 13. This is a big deal, especially as we haven't seen a new mainline entry in the franchise since 2006's Virtua Fighter 6. Yakuza / Like a Dragon developer Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has revealed Project Century, a new action game that is set in 1915 and looks to play very much like Yakuza / Like a Dragon. However, it does look to be a bit gorier and seems to include some sort of alt-history angle. Turok fans, rejoice! The beloved franchise is returning as a co-op dinosaur-hunting action game called Turok: Origins, which is being described as a \"new evolution\" of the series. In this new rendition, Turok: Origins will feature third-person action instead of first-person and multiplayer will be fully integrated into the campaign. Yes, that means you can bring up to three friends with you on this adventure. Furthermore, players will get to don a \"biomorphic suit\" that can capture DNA from enemies to gain powers like lightning and more. Ninja Gaiden is returning in Summer 2025 as a 2D side-scroller called Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound. Instead of Ryu Hayabusa, players will take on the role of Kenji Mozu and face off against a demonic army. The much-anticipated Slay the Spire 2 has received a brand-new gameplay trailer and a confirmation it is still on track to be released into Early Access in 2025. Secret Level's Pac-Man episode is getting its very own game called Shadow Labyrinth, and it look to tell more of the story of this darker and edgier version of the iconic arcade character. Players will still be running around a maze and trying to eat to stay alive like the original, but this time around it looks to be more of a Metroidvania-style game. Shadow Labyrinth is set to be released in 2025 and Tekken producer Katsuhiro Harada is one of the talented individuals on the team. Sloclap's next game is one not many could have expected as its an online multiplayer soccer game called Rematch. This new game is planned to be released in Summer 2025 on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S, and a beta is getting ready to begin in the spring. The soccer action will take place in third-person and will see teams of five playes face off for a chance at glory. Furthermore, the game is set in caged virtual reality arenas and has no fouls or penalties or out of bounds. Palworld's next expansion is called Feybreak and it will be released on December 23, 2024. At The Game Awards, Pocketpair also revealed a new trailer that shows more of this expansion and the game's \"largest, harshest, and most mysterious\" island added to Palworld so far. It's also said to be six times bigger than Sakurajima. Dave the Diver is headed to the jungle in a brand new expansion set to arrive in late 2025.

                "content": "LeBron Raymone James Sr. (/ləˈbrɒn/;[1] lə-BRON; born December 30, 1984) is an American professional basketball player for the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Nicknamed \"King James\", he is widely recognized as one of the best players in the sport's history and is often compared with Michael Jordan in debates on the greatest basketball player of all time.[a] James has won four NBA championships from 10 NBA Finals appearances, having made eight consecutive appearances between 2011 and 2018.[2] He also won the inaugural NBA Cup in 2023 with the Lakers and three Olympic gold medals as a member of the U.S. national team and won the Olympics MVP in the 2024 Summer Olympics. In addition to being the NBA's all-time leading scorer and ranking fourth in NBA career assists and eighth in NBA career steals, James holds several individual honors: four NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) Awards, four NBA Finals MVP Awards, the NBA Rookie of the Year Award, three NBA All-Star Game MVP Awards, and the inaugural NBA Cup MVP award. He has been named an NBA All-Star a record 20 times, selected to the All-NBA Team a record 20 times (including a record 13 First Team selections)[3][4] and the All-Defensive Team six times (including five First Team selections), and was a runner-up for the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award twice in his career.[5][6] The oldest active player in the NBA, he is tied with Vince Carter for the record for the most seasons played in league history, with 22. James grew up playing basketball for St. Vincent–St. Mary High School in his hometown of Akron, Ohio. He was heavily touted by the national media as a future NBA superstar for his all-around scoring, passing, athleticism and playmaking abilities.[7] A prep-to-pro, James was selected by the Cleveland Cavaliers with the first overall pick of the 2003 NBA draft. Named the 2004 NBA Rookie of the Year,[8] he soon established himself as one of the league's premier players, leading the Cavaliers to their first NBA Finals appearance in 2007 and winning the NBA MVP award in 2009 and 2010.[5] James left in 2010 as a free agent to join the Miami Heat;[9] this was announced in a nationally televised special titled The Decision and is among the most controversial free agency moves in sports history. James won his first two NBA championships while playing for the Heat in 2012 and 2013; in both of these years, he additionally earned the league's MVP and Finals MVP awards. After his fourth season with the Heat in 2014, James opted out of his contract and returned to the Cavaliers. In 2016, he led the Cavaliers to victory over the Golden State Warriors in the Finals by coming back from a 3–1 deficit, delivering the team's first championship and ending the Cleveland sports curse and won his third Finals MVP.[10] In 2018, James exercised his contract option to leave the Cavaliers and signed with the Lakers, where he won the 2020 NBA championship and his fourth Finals MVP.[11] On February 7, 2023, James surpassed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to become the leading scorer in league history, and the following year, he became part of the first father-son teammate duo in NBA history, playing alongside his son Bronny with the Lakers. Off the court, James has earned further wealth and fame from numerous endorsement contracts. He is the first player in NBA history to accumulate $1 billion in earnings as an active player.[12] James has been featured in books, documentaries (including winning three Sports Emmy Awards as an executive producer), and television commercials. He was among Time's 100 most influential people in the world in 2005, 2013, 2017, and 2019 – the most selections for a professional athlete. James has won 20 ESPY Awards, hosted Saturday Night Live, and starred in the sports film Space Jam: A New Legacy (2021). He has been a part-owner of Liverpool F.C. since 2011 and leads the LeBron James Family Foundation, which has opened an elementary school, housing complex, retail plaza, and medical center in Akron, Ohio.[13][14] James was born on December 30, 1984, in Akron, Ohio, to Gloria Marie James, who was only 16 at the time of his birth.[15]: 22 His father, Anthony McClelland, has an extensive criminal record and was not involved in his life.[16][17][18] When James was growing up, life was often a struggle for the family, as they moved from apartment to apartment in the seedier neighborhoods of Akron while Gloria struggled to find steady work.[19] Realizing that her son would be better off in a more stable family environment, Gloria allowed him to move in with the family of Frank Walker, a local youth football coach who introduced James to basketball when he was nine years old.[15]: 23 James began playing organized basketball in the fifth grade.[20] He later played Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) basketball for the Northeast Ohio Shooting Stars.[19] The team enjoyed success on a local and national level, led by James and his friends Sian Cotton, Dru Joyce III, and Willie McGee.[15]: 24 The group dubbed themselves the \"Fab Four\" and promised each other that they would attend high school together.[15]: 27 In a move that stirred local controversy, they chose to attend St. Vincent–St. Mary High School, a private Catholic school with predominantly white students.[21] As a 6-foot-2-inch (1.88 m) tall freshman, James averaged 18 points and 6.2 rebounds per game for the St. Vincent–St. Mary varsity basketball team.[22] The Fighting Irish went 27–0 en route to the Division III state title, making them the only boys high school team in Ohio to finish the season undefeated.[23] As a sophomore, James averaged 25.3 points and 7.4 rebounds, along with 5.5 assists and 3.7 steals per game.[24] For some home games during the season, St. Vincent–St. Mary played at the University of Akron's 5,492-seat Rhodes Arena to satisfy ticket demand from alumni, fans, as well as college and NBA scouts who wanted to see James play.[25] The Fighting Irish finished the season 26–1 and repeated as state champions.[22] For his outstanding play, James was named Ohio Mr. Basketball and selected to the USA Today All-USA First Team, becoming the first sophomore to do either.[22] In 2001, during the summer before his junior year, James was the subject of a feature article in Slam magazine in which writer Ryan Jones lauded the 16-year-old James, who had grown to 6 feet 7 inches (2.01 m), as \"[possibly] the best high school basketball player in America right now\".[26] During the season, James also appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated, becoming the first high school basketball underclassman to do so.[15]: 104 With averages of 28 points, 8.9 rebounds, 6 assists, and 3 steals per game, he was again named Ohio Mr. Basketball and selected to the USA Today All-USA First Team,[22] and became the first junior to be named male basketball Gatorade National Player of the Year.[15]: 117 St. Vincent–St. Mary finished the year with a 23–4 record, ending their season with a loss in the Division II championship game.[15]: 114 Following the loss, James unsuccessfully petitioned for a change to the NBA's draft eligibility rules in an attempt to enter the 2002 NBA draft.[27][28] During this time, he used marijuana, which he said was to help cope with the stress that resulted from the constant media attention he was receiving.[29] Throughout his senior year, James and the Fighting Irish traveled across the country to play a number of nationally ranked teams, including a game on December 12, 2002, against Oak Hill Academy that was nationally televised on ESPN2.[15]: 142 Time Warner Cable, looking to capitalize on James's popularity, offered St. Vincent–St. Mary's games to Ohio-based subscribers for $7.95 per game on a pay-per-view basis throughout the season, but ended up not being profitable.[15]: 143 [30] For the year, James averaged 30.4 points, 9.7 rebounds, 4.9 assists, and 2.9 steals per game,[22] was named Ohio Mr. Basketball and selected to the USA Today All-USA First Team for an unprecedented third consecutive year,[15]: 178 and was named Gatorade National Player of the Year for the second consecutive year.[22] He participated in three year-end high school basketball all-star games—the EA Sports Roundball Classic, the Jordan Brand Capital Classic, and the McDonald's All-American Game—losing his National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) eligibility and making it official that he would enter the 2003 NBA draft.[31] Also during his senior year, James was the centerpiece of several controversies. For his 18th birthday, James skirted state amateur bylaws by accepting a Hummer H2 as a gift from his mother, who had secured a loan for the vehicle by utilizing James's future earning power as an NBA player.[32] This prompted an investigation by the Ohio High School Athletic Association (OHSAA) because its guidelines stated that no amateur may accept any gift valued over $100 as a reward for athletic performance. James was cleared of any wrongdoing because he had accepted the luxury vehicle from a family member and not from an agent or any outside source.[31] Later in the season, James accepted two throwback jerseys worth $845 from an urban clothing store in exchange for posing for pictures, officially violating OHSAA rules and resulting in his being stripped of his high school sports eligibility.[31] James appealed the ruling and his penalty was eventually dropped to a two-game suspension, allowing him to play the remainder of the year. The Irish were also forced to forfeit one of their wins, their only official loss that season.[33] In his first game back after the suspension, James scored a career-high 52 points.[34] St. Vincent–St. Mary went on to win the Division II championship, marking their third division title in four years.[35] As an underclassman, James played wide receiver for St. Vincent–St. Mary's football team.[15]: 51 He was recruited by some Division I programs, including Notre Dame.[36] At the end of his second year, James was named first team all-state, and as a junior, he helped lead the Fighting Irish to the state semifinals.[24] James did not play during his senior year because of a wrist injury that he sustained in an AAU basketball game.[37] Some sports analysts, football critics, high school coaches, as well as former and current professional players have speculated that James could have played in the National Football League (NFL).[b] James was selected by his hometown team, the Cleveland Cavaliers, as the first overall pick of the 2003 NBA draft.[42] In his first regular season game, James scored 25 points in a 106–92 loss to the Sacramento Kings, setting an NBA record for the most points scored by a prep-to-pro player in his debut performance.[43] At the conclusion of the 2003–2004 season, James became the first Cavalier to receive the NBA Rookie of the Year Award.[8] With final averages of 20.9 points, 5.5 rebounds, and 5.9 assists per game,[44] he also became the third player in league history to average at least 20 points, five rebounds, and five assists per game as a rookie.[45] Cleveland ultimately finished the season 35–47, failing to make the playoffs despite an 18-game improvement over the previous year.[46] In the 2004–2005 season, James earned his first NBA All-Star Game selection, contributing 13 points, 8 rebounds, and 6 assists in a winning effort for the Eastern Conference.[47] Around the league, teams took note of his rapid development, and Denver Nuggets coach George Karl told Sports Illustrated: \"It's weird talking about a 20-year-old kid being a great player, but he is a great player ... He's the exception to almost every rule.\"[48] On March 20, James scored 56 points against the Toronto Raptors, setting Cleveland's new single-game points record.[49] With final averages of 27.2 points, 7.4 rebounds, 7.2 assists, and 2.2 steals per game, he was named to his first All-NBA Team.[24] Despite a 30–20 record to start the year,[49] the Cavaliers again failed to make the playoffs, finishing the season 42–40.[50] At the 2006 All-Star Game, James led the East to victory with 29 points and was named the NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player.[51] Behind final season averages of 31.4 points, 7.0 rebounds, and 6.6 assists per game,[5] he also finished second in overall NBA Most Valuable Player Award voting to Steve Nash.[52] Under James' leadership, the Cavaliers qualified for the playoffs for the first time since 1998.[53] In his postseason debut, James recorded a triple-double in a winning effort over the Washington Wizards.[54] In Game 3 of the series, he made the first game-winning shot of his career, and made another in Game 5.[55] Cleveland would go on to defeat the Wizards before being ousted by the Detroit Pistons in the second round.[56] In the 2006–2007 season, James finished the regular season averaging 27.3 points, 6.7 rebounds, 6.0 assists, and 1.6 steals per game.[24] With a starting five featuring James, Larry Hughes, Drew Gooden, Aleksandar Pavlović, and Zydrunas Ilgauskas, the Cavaliers finished the season with 50 wins for the second consecutive year and entered the playoffs as the #2-seed in the Eastern Conference.[59] In the first two rounds of the playoffs, LeBron led the team to wins over the Washington Wizards and New Jersey Nets. The Cavaliers then faced the Detroit Pistons in the Eastern Conference Finals. In Game 5 of the Eastern Conference Finals, he logged 48 points with nine rebounds and seven assists. His performance is considered one of the greatest playoff performances of all time as he scored 29 of Cleveland's last 30 points, including 25 straight, and the game-winning layup with two seconds left. The Cavaliers won 109–107 double-overtime victory over the Detroit Pistons.[60] After the game, play-by-play announcer Marv Albert called the performance \"one of the greatest moments in postseason history\" and color commentator Steve Kerr described it as \"Jordan-esque\".[61] In 2012, ESPN ranked the performance the fourth greatest in modern NBA playoff history.[62] The Cavaliers went on to win Game 6 and claim their first-ever Eastern Conference championship, earning them a matchup with the San Antonio Spurs in the Finals.[63] The Spurs at the time were coached by Gregg Popovich and featured a prime Tim Duncan, Tony Parker, Manu Ginóbili, and Bruce Bowen. With no other significant scoring threats, the Spurs built its defense around stopping James from getting into the paint. As James did not have a reliable jump shot yet nor another offensive weapon on his team, he struggled against the Spurs' zone defense.[64] He averaged 22 points, 7.0 rebounds, and 6.8 assists per game on just 35.6 percent shooting,[65] as Cleveland was eliminated in a four-game sweep.[66] In February of the 2007–2008 season, James was named All-Star Game MVP for the second time behind a 27-point, eight-rebound, and nine-assist performance.[67] On March 21, he moved past Brad Daugherty as the Cavaliers' all-time leading scorer in a game against the Toronto Raptors, doing so in over 100 fewer games than Daugherty.[68] James' 30 points per game were also the highest in the league, marking his first scoring title.[69] Despite his individual accomplishments, Cleveland's record fell from the year before to 45–37.[70] Seeded fourth in the East entering the playoffs, the Cavaliers defeated the Wizards in the first round for the third consecutive season before being eliminated in seven games by the eventual-champion Boston Celtics in the next round.[71] During the decisive seventh game in Boston, James scored 45 points and Paul Pierce scored 41 in a game the Associated Press described as a \"shootout\".[72] At the end of the 2008–2009 season, James finished second in NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award voting and made his first NBA All-Defensive Team,[73] posting 23 chase-down blocks and a career-high 93 total blocks.[74] James also became only the fourth postmerger player to lead his team in points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks in a single season.[75] Behind his play and the acquisition of All-Star guard Mo Williams, Cleveland went a franchise record 66–16 and fell just one game short of matching the best home record in league history.[76] With final averages of 28.4 points, 7.6 rebounds, 7.2 assists, 1.7 steals, and 1.2 blocks per game, James became the first Cavalier to win the MVP Award.[77] Reflecting on James' performance for ESPN, John Hollinger later wrote: \"He's having what is arguably the greatest individual season in history, and it's time we gave him his due for it.\"[78] In the playoffs, Cleveland swept the Detroit Pistons and the Atlanta Hawks to earn a matchup with the Orlando Magic in the Eastern Conference Finals.[79] In Game 1 of the series, James scored 49 points on 66 percent shooting in a losing effort for the Cavaliers.[62] In Game 2, he hit a game-winner to tie the series at 1–1.[80] Cleveland would lose the series in six games, and following the loss in Game 6, James immediately left the floor without shaking hands with his opponents, which was an act that many media members viewed as unsportsmanlike.[81][82] For the series, James averaged 38.5 points, 8.3 rebounds, and 8.0 assists per game,[83] finishing the postseason with a career playoff-high 35.3 points per game.[5] In February of the 2009–10 season, James was forced into a temporary point guard role following a series of injuries to players in the Cavaliers' backcourt.[84] Behind his leadership, Cleveland lost no momentum, finishing the year with the best record in the league for the second consecutive season.[85] Despite only playing 39 minutes per game, James increased his statistical production, averaging 29.7 points, 7.3 rebounds, 8.6 assists, 1.6 steals, and 1.0 block per game on 50 percent shooting en route to another MVP Award.[86] To open the playoffs, Cleveland advanced past the Chicago Bulls to earn a matchup with the Boston Celtics in the second round.[87] James was heavily criticized for not playing well in Game 5 of the series, shooting only 20 percent on 14 shots and scoring 15 points.[88] The team suffered its worst loss in franchise history, and at the conclusion of the game, James walked off the court to a smattering of boos from Cleveland's home crowd.[89] The Cavaliers were officially eliminated from the postseason in Game 6, with James posting 27 points, 19 rebounds, and 10 assists in the losing effort.[87] James became an unrestricted free agent at 12:01 a.m. EDT on July 1, 2010.[91] During this time, he was contacted by several teams, including the Bulls, Los Angeles Clippers, Miami Heat, New York Knicks, New Jersey Nets, and Cavaliers.[92] On July 8, James announced on a live ESPN special titled The Decision that he would sign with the Heat.[93] The telecast was broadcast from the Boys & Girls Club of Greenwich, Connecticut and raised $2.5 million for the charity. An additional $3.5 million was raised from advertising revenue, which was donated to other charities.[94] The day before the special, fellow free agents Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade also announced that they would sign with Miami;[95] reports later arose that back in 2006 the trio had discussed among themselves their upcoming 2010 free agencies.[96] James decided to join with Bosh and Wade in part so that he could shoulder less of the offensive load; James thought that his improved teammates would give him a better chance of winning an NBA championship than had he stayed in Cleveland.[97] Heat president Pat Riley played a major role in selling James on the idea of playing with Bosh and Wade.[98] James would be relieved of the burden of scoring, and he thought he could be the first player since Oscar Robertson to average a triple-double in a season.[97] Upon leaving the Cavaliers, James drew intense criticism from sports analysts, executives, fans, and current and former players. The Decision itself was also scrutinized and viewed as unnecessary. Many thought that the prolonged wait for James' choice was unprofessional as not even the teams courting him were aware of his decision until moments before the show.[99] Upon learning that James would not be returning to Cleveland, Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert published an open letter to fans in which he aggressively denounced James' actions.[100] Some angry fans of the team recorded videos of themselves burning his jersey.[101] Former NBA players, including Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson, were also critical of James, condemning him for forming a superteam with Bosh and Wade in Miami and not trying to win a championship in Cleveland, though Jordan did acknowledge that the options players had at the time were much more expansive than those he and others had in the 1980s and 1990s.[102][103][104] Some commentators did defend James' decision to join the Miami Heat by noting the Cavaliers' inability to build a strong supporting cast around him. They argued that other NBA greats had benefitted from talented teammates: Magic Johnson had Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and James Worthy, Larry Bird had Kevin McHale (basketball) and Robert Parish on the Celtics, and Michael Jordan had Scottie Pippen with the Bulls.[105] James drew further criticism in a September interview with CNN when he claimed that race might have been a factor in the fallout from The Decision.[106][107] As a result of his actions during the 2010 free agency period, James quickly gained a reputation as one of America's most disliked athletes, which marked a radical change from prior years.[108][109] The phrase \"taking my talents to South Beach\" became a punch line for critics.[110][111] In retrospect, James has expressed some regret over his handling of The Decision.[109][112][113] James officially signed a 6-year, $110 million contract with the Heat on July 10, 2010, through a sign-and-trade deal which sent two second- and two first-round draft picks to the Cavaliers and gave the team the option to swap first round picks with the Heat in 2012.[114][115] As part of the first player-created NBA superteam[116] he became only the third reigning MVP to change teams and the first since Moses Malone in 1982.[117] That evening, the Heat threw a welcome party for their new \"Big Three\" at the American Airlines Arena, an event that took on a rock concert atmosphere.[118] During the gathering, James predicted a dynasty for the Heat and alluded to multiple championships.[119][120] Outside of Miami, the spectacle was not well-received, furthering the negative public perception of James.[121] Throughout the 2010–11 season, the media and opposing fanbases treated James and the Heat as villains.[122] To begin the year, they struggled to adjust to these new circumstances, going only 9–8 after 17 games.[123] James later admitted that the constant negativity surrounding the team made him play with an angrier demeanor than in years past.[122] On December 2, James faced the Cleveland Cavaliers in Cleveland for the first time since departing as a free agent.[124] He scored 38 points and led Miami to a victory while being booed every time he touched the ball.[125] The Heat eventually turned their season around and finished as the East's second seed,[126] with James averaging 26.7 points, 7.5 rebounds, and 7.0 assists per game on 51 percent shooting.[5] In the Eastern Conference Semifinals, James and his teammates found themselves matched up with the Boston Celtics for the second consecutive year.[127] In Game 5, he scored Miami's last 10 points to help seal a series-clinching win.[128] After the final buzzer, James famously knelt on the court in an emotional moment, later telling reporters that it was an extremely personal victory for him and the team.[129] The Heat eventually advanced to the Finals, where they lost to the Dallas Mavericks in six games.[127] James received the brunt of the criticism for the loss, averaging only three points in fourth quarters in the series and scored just eight points in Game 4, a game Miami lost by just three points.[130] His Finals scoring average of 17.8 points per game signified an 8.9-point drop from the regular season, the largest point drop-off in league history.[131] The 2011–2012 season was delayed by a lockout, and during that extended summer, James worked with Hakeem Olajuwon in order to improve his post up game.[132][123][133] Humbled by the Heat's loss to the Mavericks, the experience inspired James to leave behind the villain role that he had been embracing, which helped James regain a sense of joy on the court.[122] Behind his expanded skillset,[133] Miami began the year with a franchise-best 18–6 record.[134] James was eventually named MVP for the third time, finishing with averages of 27.1 points, 7.9 rebounds, 6.2 assists, and 1.9 steals per game on 53 percent shooting.[135] In the second round of the playoffs, Miami temporarily lost Bosh to an abdominal injury and found themselves trailing the Indiana Pacers 2–1.[137] James responded with a 40-point, 18-rebound, and nine-assist outing in Game 4 to help even the series.[138] To compensate for Bosh's absence, the Heat embraced a small-ball lineup with James at power forward, which they retained even after Bosh's return in the conference finals against the Boston Celtics.[139][140] Facing elimination in Game 6, James recorded 45 points and 15 rebounds to lead the Heat to victory in what The New York Times called a \"career-defining performance\".[141] Miami won Game 7 to advance to the Finals, earning them a matchup with the Oklahoma City Thunder and James' budding rival Kevin Durant.[142] Late in Game 4 of the series, James hit a three-pointer to give the Heat a lead, helping them win the game despite missing time with leg cramps.[143] In Game 5, he registered a triple-double as Miami defeated Oklahoma City for their second-ever championship and James' first championship.[144] James was unanimously voted the Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player with averages of 28.6 points, 10.2 rebounds, and 7.4 assists per game.[145] His full postseason run, in which James averaged 30.3 points, 9.7 rebounds, and 5.6 assists per game, was later ranked the second best in modern NBA history by ESPN.[146] In February of the 2012–13 season, James averaged 29.7 points and 7.8 assists per game while setting multiple shooting efficiency records.[147][148] That same month, the Heat also began a 27-game winning streak, which is the third longest in NBA history.[149] Based on these accomplishments, James' performance was described as a \"month for the ages\" by Sports Illustrated.[150] Miami eventually finished the year with a franchise and league best 66–16 record,[151] and James was named MVP for the fourth time, falling just one vote shy of becoming the first player in NBA history to win the award unanimously.[152] His final season averages were 26.8 points, 8.0 rebounds, 7.3 assists, and 1.7 steals per game on 56.5 percent shooting.[5] In Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Finals, James scored a buzzer-beating layup to give Miami a one-point victory against the Pacers.[153] Throughout the series, his supporting cast struggled significantly, and his added scoring load prompted James to compare his responsibilities to those of his \"Cleveland days\".[154] Despite these struggles, the Heat advanced to the Finals for a meeting with the San Antonio Spurs,[155] signifying a rematch for James from his first Finals six years earlier.[156] At the beginning of the series, he was criticized for his lack of aggressiveness and poor shot selection as Miami fell behind 2–3.[83][155][157] In Game 6, James recorded his second triple-double of the series, including 16 fourth quarter points, to lead the Heat to a comeback victory.[158] In Game 7, he tied the Finals record for most points scored in a Game 7 victory, leading Miami over San Antonio with 37 points.[159] James was named Finals MVP for the second straight season, averaging 25.3 points, 10.9 rebounds, 7.0 assists, and 2.3 steals per game for the championship round.[160] On March 3 of the 2013–14 season, James scored a career-high and franchise-record 61 points in a game against the Charlotte Bobcats.[161] He converted on his first eight three-point field goal attempts through three quarters, setting a new record for the most three-point field goals made in a 60-point game. James also set the record for most points in a single game while wearing a mask. Throughout the year, he was one of the few staples for a Heat roster that used 20 different starting lineups due to injuries,[162] finishing with averages of 27.1 points, 6.9 rebounds, and 6.4 assists per game on 56.7 percent shooting.[5] In the second round of the playoffs, James tied a career postseason-high by scoring 49 points in Game 4 against the Brooklyn Nets.[163] In the next round, Miami defeated the Pacers to earn their fourth consecutive Finals berth, becoming one of only four teams in NBA history to do so.[164] In Game 1 of the NBA Finals, James missed most of the fourth quarter because of leg cramps, helping the San Antonio Spurs take an early series lead.[165] In Game 2, he led the Heat to a series-tying victory with 35 points on a 64 percent shooting rate.[166] San Antonio eventually eliminated the Heat in five games, ending Miami's quest for a three-peat.[167] For the Finals, James averaged 28.2 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 2.0 steals per game.[168] On June 25, 2014, James opted out of his contract with the Heat, and on July 1, he officially became an unrestricted free agent.[169] On July 11, James revealed via a first-person essay in Sports Illustrated that he intended to return to the Cavaliers.[170] In contrast to The Decision, his announcement to return to Cleveland was well received.[171][172][173] The next day, James officially signed with the team,[174] who had compiled a league-worst 97–215 record in the four seasons following his departure.[175] A month after James' signing, the Cavaliers acquired Kevin Love from the Minnesota Timberwolves, forming a new star trio along with Kyrie Irving.[176] In January of the 2014–2015 season, James missed two weeks due to left knee and lower back strains, which at the time represented the longest stretch of missed games in his career.[179] In total, James played a then career-low 69 games and his final averages were 25.3 points, 6.0 rebounds, and 7.4 assists per game.[5] In the second round of the playoffs, he hit a baseline jumper at the buzzer to give Cleveland a 2–2 series tie with the Chicago Bulls.[180] In the Eastern Conference Finals, the Cavaliers defeated the Atlanta Hawks to advance to the NBA Finals, making James the first player since the 1960s to play in five consecutive Finals.[181] For most of the Finals against the Golden State Warriors, Irving and Love were sidelined due to injury, giving James more offensive responsibilities.[181] Behind his leadership, the Cavaliers opened the series with a 2–1 lead before losing in six games.[182] Despite the loss, he received serious consideration for the Finals MVP Award,[183] averaging 35.8 points, 13.3 rebounds, and 8.8 assists per game.[182] During the 2015–16 season, James was criticized for his role in several off-court controversies, including the midseason firing of Cavaliers' coach David Blatt.[184][185] Despite these distractions, Cleveland finished the year with 57 wins and the best record in the East.[186] James' final averages were 25.3 points, 7.4 rebounds, and 6.8 assists per game on 52 percent shooting.[5] In the playoffs, the Cavaliers advanced comfortably to the NBA Finals, losing only two games en route to a rematch with the Golden State Warriors,[186] who were coming off a record-setting 73-win season.[187] To begin the series, Cleveland fell behind 3–1, including two blowout losses.[188] James responded by registering back-to-back 41-point games in Games 5 and 6, leading the Cavaliers to two consecutive wins to stave off elimination.[189] In Game 7, he posted a triple-double and made a number of key plays, including a chasedown block on Andre Iguodala's go-ahead layup attempt,[190] as Cleveland emerged victorious, winning the city's first professional sports title in 52 years and becoming the first team in NBA history to come back from a 3–1 series deficit in the Finals.[10] James became just the third player to record a triple-double in an NBA Finals Game 7,[191] and behind series averages of 29.7 points, 11.3 rebounds, 8.9 assists, 2.3 blocks, and 2.6 steals per game,[188] he also became the first player in league history to lead both teams in all five statistical categories for a playoff round, culminating in a unanimous Finals MVP selection.[192] The 2016–17 season was marred by injuries and unexpected losses for the Cavaliers;[193] James later described it as one of the \"strangest\" years of his career.[194] Following a January defeat to the New Orleans Pelicans, James publicly criticized Cleveland's front office for constructing a team that he felt was too \"top heavy\", for which he received countercriticism.[195] The Cavaliers finished the season as the East's second seed, with James averaging 26.4 points and career highs in rebounds (8.6), assists (8.7), and turnovers (4.1) per game.[5] In Game 3 of the first round of the playoffs, he registered 41 points, 13 rebounds, and 12 assists against the Indiana Pacers, leading Cleveland to a comeback victory after trailing by 25 points at halftime, representing the largest halftime deficit overcome in NBA playoff history.[196] In Game 5 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the Boston Celtics, James scored 35 points and surpassed Michael Jordan as the league's all-time postseason scoring leader.[197] The Cavaliers won the game and the series, advancing to the NBA Finals for the third consecutive time against the Golden State Warriors, who had signed James' rival Kevin Durant during the off-season.[198] Behind averages of 33.6 points, 12.0 rebounds, and 10.0 assists per game, James became the first player to average a triple-double in the Finals, but Cleveland was defeated in five games.[199] Prior to the start of the 2017–18 season, the Cavaliers overhauled their roster by trading Kyrie Irving to the Boston Celtics, who requested a trade in part because he no longer wanted to play with James.[200] After a slow start to the year, Cleveland rebounded by winning 18 of 19 games in December.[201] Their turnaround began with a victory over the Wizards on November 3 where James scored 57 points, which represented the second-highest point total of his career and tied a franchise record.[202] In January, the Cavaliers had a losing record, and James was criticized for his lackluster effort.[203] The next month, James won his third All-Star Game MVP Award, after posting 29 points, 10 rebounds, eight assists, and several key plays to help Team LeBron win over Team Curry.[204] Following another round of trades in February, Cleveland returned to form and James reached a number of historical milestones; on March 30, he set an NBA record with 867 straight games scoring in double digits.[205] James eventually finished the season with averages of 27.5 points, 8.6 rebounds, 9.2 assists, and 4.2 turnovers per game.[5] In the playoffs, James guided the Cavaliers to another Finals rematch with the Golden State Warriors.[206] Along the way, he had some of the most memorable moments of his career, including a game-winning shot against the Pacers and another against the Raptors, after which a new nickname, \"LeBronto\" was popularized.[207][208] In Game 1 of the NBA Finals, James scored a playoff career-high 51 points, but Cleveland lost 124–114 in overtime.[209] Following the loss, James injured his hand after punching a wall in the locker room, which hindered his effectiveness for the remainder of the series.[210] The Cavaliers lost the series in four games, with James averaging 34 points, 8.5 rebounds, and 10.0 assists per game for the Finals.[211] On June 29, 2018, James opted out of his contract with the Cavaliers and became an unrestricted free agent.[212] Two days later, his management company, Klutch Sports, announced that he would sign with the Los Angeles Lakers;[213] the deal was officially completed on July 9.[214] In an interview with Sports Illustrated, James's agent Rich Paul explained: \"In 2010, when he went to Miami, it was about championships. In 2014, when he went back to Cleveland, it was about delivering on a promise. In 2018, it was just about doing what he wants to do.\"[215] Reaction to the move was more positive than his original departure from the Cavaliers, albeit still mixed, as some onlookers felt that Los Angeles was not his optimal destination.[216] The Lakers expected James to immediately transform them into a championship contender after having missed the playoffs since 2014 and not appearing in the Finals since 2010.[217][218] Following his signing, the team rounded out their roster with a controversial collection of playmakers and veterans. To begin the 2018–19 season, the Lakers struggled to find effective lineups and recorded only two wins through their first seven games.[219] In November, they began a turnaround, which included two of James's strongest performances of the season. On November 14, he registered 44 points, 10 rebounds, and nine assists in a victory against the Portland Trail Blazers.[220] Four days later, James scored a season-high 51 points in a victory over the Heat.[221] After blowing out the Golden State Warriors on Christmas Day, Los Angeles improved their record to 20–14, but James suffered a groin injury,[222] the first major injury of his career.[223] James missed a then career-high 17 consecutive games, and the Lakers fell out of playoff contention without him,[222] marking the first time that James missed the playoffs since 2005.[224] In March, the Lakers announced that James would begin a minutes restriction,[225] and he was later officially ruled out for the rest of the season.[226] James' final averages were 27.4 points, 8.5 rebounds, and 8.3 assists per game.[5] Despite his inconsistent campaign, James was named to the All-NBA Third Team, marking the first time in twelve years that he did not make the All-NBA First Team.[227] \"Kobe is a brother to me. From the time I was in high school watching him from afar, to getting in this league at 18 and watching him up close, all the battles that we had throughout my career, the one thing that we always shared was that determination to just want to win, to just want to be great. The fact that I'm here now means so much to me. I want to continue, along with my teammates, his legacy. Not only for this year, but for as long as we can play this game of basketball that we love, because that's what Kobe Bryant would want. So in the words of Kobe Bryant, 'Mamba out'. But in the words of us, 'not forgotten' Live on, brother.\" During the offseason, the Lakers hired Frank Vogel as their new head coach, and traded the majority of their young core to the Pelicans for superstar big man Anthony Davis.[229] James immediately embraced the team's much-improved roster by transforming his playing style, moving to full-time point guard, and competing with a more consistent defensive effort.[230] Behind James' leadership, the Lakers opened the 2019–20 season with a 17–2 record, matching the best start in franchise history.[231] On January 25, James scored his 33,644th career point, passing Kobe Bryant for third on the all-time regular season scoring list.[232] The following day, Bryant died in a helicopter crash in Calabasas, California.[233] James delivered an improvised eulogy in honor of Bryant at Staples Center, before a January 31 game against the Portland Trail Blazers.[234] In early March, before the season was suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic, James led the Lakers to a victory over the Milwaukee Bucks in a matchup of conference leaders, followed by a streak-breaking victory over the Los Angeles Clippers.[235] Regular season play resumed in July and concluded in August within the confined NBA Bubble, where James ended the regular season as the league leader in assists for the first time in his career, averaging 10.2 assists per game.[236] He earned a record 16th All-NBA Team selection as part of the First Team, extending his record First Team selections to 13.[237] The Lakers entered the playoffs as the top seed in the West and advanced to the NBA Finals convincingly, with only three total losses along the way.[238] In Game 5 of the Western Conference Finals against the Denver Nuggets, James helped clinch the conference championship by scoring a game-high 38 points, including 16 in the fourth quarter.[239] In the Finals, James and his teammates found themselves matched up with his former team, the Miami Heat, and quickly took control of the series with a 2–0 lead.[240] In Game 5, James had his best statistical performance of the Finals with 40 points, 13 rebounds, and seven assists in a memorable duel with Miami's Jimmy Butler, but Los Angeles was ultimately defeated in a three-point game.[241] The Lakers eliminated the Heat in Game 6, which earned James, who averaged 29.8 points, 11.8 rebounds, and 8.5 assists per game during the series,[242] his fourth NBA championship and fourth Finals MVP award.[11] At 35 years and 287 days old, James became the second-oldest player in league history to win the award,[243] and the only player in NBA history to win the award with three different franchises.[244] James and teammate Danny Green also became the third and fourth players in NBA history to win at least one championship with three different teams each.[245] The 2020–2021 season, reduced to 72 games for each team and starting on December 22, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, began after the shortest offseason in NBA history with a 116–109 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers.[246] On December 31, James became the first player in NBA history to score 10 points or more in 1,000 consecutive games in a 121–107 victory over the San Antonio Spurs.[247] On February 18, 2021, James became the third player in NBA history with 35,000 career points, joining Hall of Famers Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Karl Malone; aged 36 years and 50 days, he was the youngest player to reach the milestone.[248] On March 20, James sprained his ankle against the Atlanta Hawks,[249] but was able to hit a three-point shot afterwards to keep his 10-points streak alive before exiting the game.[250] By March, the Lakers were No. 2, two games behind the Utah Jazz, but they went 14–16 without Davis and 6–10 without James, falling to No. 5.[251] James returned on April 30 after missing 20 games, the longest absence of his career.[252] In May, James was sidelined again after leaving a game against the Toronto Raptors,[253] but he returned for the final two games,[254][255] and finished the season with averages of 25.0 points, 7.7 rebounds, and 7.8 assists on 51.3 percent shooting in 45 out of 72 games;[256] this was his 17th consecutive season averaging at least 25 points per game, the most in NBA history.[257] In an injury-laden season, the Lakers ended with a 42–30 record, finishing No. 7 due to tiebreakers and facing the No. 8-seed Warriors in the play-in tournament.[258] The Lakers won 103–100 after James scored the go-ahead, three-point shot in the final minute, posting a triple-double with 22 points, 11 rebounds, and 10 assists, along with two steals and a block.[259] His 34-foot (10 m) shot over Stephen Curry before the shot clock buzzer was his longest basket of the season as well as his longest go-ahead shot in the closing three minutes of a game in his career.[260][261] In the first round of the playoffs, the Lakers faced the No. 2 Phoenix Suns. This marked the first time in James' career that he did not have home court advantage in the opening series.[262][263] They were up 2–1 before Davis suffered a strained groin in Game 4, in which James finished with a game-high 25 points on 10-for-21 shooting, 12 rebounds, and 6 assists.[264] The Lakers lost to the Suns in six games, marking the first time James lost in the first round in his career.[262] James finished the series averaging 23.3 points, his fourth-lowest scoring output for a series over his career and his lowest mark since averaging 22.8 in the 2014 Eastern Conference finals.[265] He made his 17th consecutive All-NBA Team selection,[3] extending the record for most selections in NBA history,[266] being named for the third time to the All-NBA Second Team.[267] For the 2021–22 season, James was joined by Carmelo Anthony and Russell Westbrook.[268] In a game against the Pistons on November 21, James was ejected in the third quarter after getting into a scuffle with Isaiah Stewart during the 121–116 victory. This was the second time in his career that he was ejected from a game,[269] and James was suspended for one game due to his actions.[270] In his next 16 games, James averaged 30.4 points, 8.9 rebounds, 6.3 assists, 1.6 steals, and 1.4 blocks on 54 percent shooting, also achieving his 100th triple-double,[271] while becoming the third player in NBA history to surpass 36,000 career points;[272] during this period, James played 35 percent of his minutes at center.[273][274] From December 19 to February 26, 2022, playing 23 out of 27 games, he had a streak of 23 consecutive 25-point games.[275] In December, James became the second player in NBA history (after Michael Jordan) to post 40 points and no turnovers at age 35 or older.[276] In January, James met the minimum criteria for points per game by playing at least 70 percent of his team's games, averaging 28.6 points, and became the oldest player to average 25+ points per game, having already been the youngest to do so, as James averaged 27.6 points per game in his sophomore season at 20 years old.[277] He also became the oldest player in NBA history to record at least 25 points in ten straight games, doing so at 37 years old.[278] By January 20, James became the fifth player in NBA history to record at least 30,000 career points and 10,000 career rebounds; he is the first player to record at least 30,000 career points, 10,000 career rebounds, and 9,000 career assists.[279][280][281] In the same period, he surpassed Oscar Robertson for 4th all-time free throws made,[282] and Alvin Robertson for 10th all-time in career steals.[283][284] In February, James surpassed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for the most points scored in both the regular season and playoffs;[285] by March, he passed Karl Malone for second in the all-time minutes and regular season scoring lists.[286][287][288] At the 2022 NBA All-Star Game held in Cleveland, James was celebrated among the other 74 players for the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.[289] James led all players in fan votes with his 18th All-Star selection, tying Bryant and just one behind Abdul-Jabbar;[290] his team achieved its fifth consecutive All-Star victory,[291] defeating Team Durant 163–161,[292] with James hitting the game-winning dagger shot in front of his hometown crowd.[293][294] In March, James recorded two 50-point games, which were also his Lakers' career-high,[295][296] becoming the oldest player to have multiple 50-point games in a season, as well as the first Lakers player since Bryant in 2008 to have back-to-back 50-point home games; it was James' 15th 50-point game in his 19-year career, including the postseason.[297] He also recorded his 10,000th career assist, becoming the only player in NBA history to record at least 10,000 points, 10,000 rebounds, and 10,000 assists.[298][299] On March 27, James became just the second player in NBA history to score 37,000 points.[300] Due to an ankle injury in late March, he missed out on a close three-players run for the NBA scoring title,[301][302][303] having only played 56 games, two less than the necessary to qualify;[304] aged 37, James would have broken Jordan's record of oldest scoring leader at 34.[305] For The Athletic, Bill Oram wrote that James' ankle injury felt like \"the moment that might signal the end of the Lakers season\".[306][307] On April 5, the Lakers were eliminated from both playoff and play-in contention for the first time since 2019 (James's first season with the Lakers) after a 121–110 loss to the Phoenix Suns.[308] It marked the fourth time in James' career that he missed the playoffs.[309] James was ruled out the rest of the season due to soreness in his left ankle.[310] He finished the season with a 7.6 box plus–minus (first among players in his age group) and averages of 30.3 points (first by 6.9 points among players in his age range), 8.2 rebounds, 6.2 assists, 2.9 threes, 1.3 steals, and 1.1 blocks per game on 52–35–75 shooting ranges.[311] On May 24, James was named to the All-NBA Third Team for the second time; it was his 18th consecutive All-NBA Team selection, extending the record for most selections in NBA history.[312] On August 18, 2022, James re-signed with the Lakers on a two-year, $97.1 million contract.[313][314] The contract extension made him the highest-paid athlete in NBA history at $528.9 million, surpassing Kevin Durant in all-time earnings.[315] On October 20, James made his 2,144th three-pointer in a game against the Los Angeles Clippers, surpassing Paul Pierce for tenth in all-time three-pointers made.[316] On October 28, James posted 28 points, seven rebounds, five assists, and four steals in an 111–102 loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves.

During the ceremony, he received the game ball from Abdul-Jabbar.[333] James also gave a speech and then embraced Abdul-Jabbar, as well as his family.[334][335] James missed the following three games due to left ankle soreness.[336][337] On February 19, Team LeBron lost the 2023 NBA All-Star Game 184–175 to Team Giannis, marking the first time that James lost an All-Star game as a captain.[c] Prior to the game, he had been undefeated (5–0) as a captain, and since the format was changed in 2018.[339] During the game, James suffered a right hand contusion and was ruled out for the entire 2nd half.[340] On February 26, James sustained a right foot injury during a game against the Dallas Mavericks.

We definitely know that now.\"[400] At the Olympics, Team USA went unbeaten, winning their first gold medal since 2000.[401] In the final game, James' statistics were – 14 points, six rebounds, and three assists against Spain.[402] James did not play at the 2010 FIBA World Championship but rejoined Team USA for the 2012 Olympics in London, England.[403] He became the leader of the team, with Bryant, who would soon be 34, stepping back.[404] James facilitated the offense from the post and perimeter, called the defensive sets, and provided scoring when needed.[405] During a game against Australia, he recorded the first triple-double in U.S. Olympic basketball history with 11 points, 14 rebounds, and 12 assists.[d] Team USA went on to win their second straight gold medal, again defeating Spain in the final game.[407] James contributed 19 points in the victory, becoming the all-time leading scorer in U.S. men's basketball history.[391][407] He also joined Michael Jordan as the only players to win an NBA MVP award, NBA championship, NBA Finals MVP, and Olympic gold medal in the same year.[408] Afterwards, Krzyzewski said: \"[James] is the best player, he is the best leader and he is as smart as anybody playing the game right now.\"[409] After a 12-year gap, James rejoined the national team on the 2024 Olympic squad in Paris as Team Captain at 39 years old.[410] Voted by the entire 592-strong U.S. delegation, James was named as one of the two Team USA flag-bearers for the opening ceremony of the games, becoming the first male basketball player to be so honored.[411][412] James led the team in rebounds and assists. He recorded his second Olympic triple double in a comeback win in the semi-final against Serbia with 16 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists.[413] James became the first player in Olympic history with two triple doubles.[414] Team USA went on to win their fifth straight gold medal, defeating France 98–87 in the final game,[415] with James recording 14 points, 6 rebounds and 10 assists. At the conclusion of the tournament with averages of 14.2 points, 6.8 rebounds and 8.5 assists, James was named the FIBA Men's Olympics MVP and was selected to the FIBA Men's Olympics All-Star Five.[416] James became the third male basketball player to win three gold medals at the Olympics. Standing 6 feet 9 inches (2.06 m) tall and weighing 250 pounds (113 kg),[417] James has played the majority of his career at the small forward and power forward positions,[5] but he has also been deployed at the other positions when necessary.[418] His playing style, which is athletic and versatile,[133] has drawn comparisons to Basketball Hall of Famers Oscar Robertson, Magic Johnson, and Michael Jordan.[419][420][421] Through the 2023–24 season, James' career averages are 27.1 points, 7.5 rebounds, 7.4 assists, 1.5 steals, and 0.7 blocks per game.[5] Throughout the 2010s, he was usually ranked as the best player in the NBA each season by ESPN and Sports Illustrated.[422][423] As an 18-year-old rookie, James led the Cavaliers in scoring.[425] He holds numerous \"youngest to\" distinctions,[426][427] including being the youngest player to score 30,000 career points.[428] During his first stint in Cleveland, James was primarily used as an on-ball point forward, and although his shooting tendencies were perimeter-oriented,[133] he established himself as one of the best slashers and finishers in basketball.[429][430] His combination of speed, quickness, and size often created matchup problems for opposing teams because James was capable of blowing by larger defenders and overpowering smaller ones.[431] These qualities became more apparent in transition, where he developed a reputation for grabbing defensive rebounds and then beating the defense downcourt for highlight reel baskets.[432] Around this time, James was frequently criticized for not having a reliable jump shot or post game.[433] Teams would try to exploit these weaknesses by giving him space in the half court and forcing him to settle for three-pointers and long two-pointers, a strategy famously used by Spurs coach Gregg Popovich in the 2007 Finals, where James converted on only 36 percent of his field goals in four games.[434] In Miami, Heat coach Erik Spoelstra changed James' role to a more unconventional one.[133] James spent more time in the post and improved his shot selection and accuracy on jump shots.[133][435] He also learned how to work as an off-ball cutter in the Heat's \"pass-happy\" offense.[436] Behind these improvements, James' overall scoring efficiency rose to historically great levels.[437] During this time, ESPN's Tom Haberstroh called James's free-throw shooting his biggest weakness, describing it as \"average\".[438] Upon returning to the Cavaliers, James began to experience subtle age-related declines in productivity,[439] posting his lowest scoring averages since his rookie season in 2015 and 2016.[5][440] His shooting also temporarily regressed, and James briefly ranked as the NBA's worst high-volume shooter from outside the paint.[441] Despite these changes, he remained an elite offensive player who beat defenses with body control, strength, and varying attacking speeds.[431] For most of his career, James has controlled the offense as the primary ball handler on his team.[442] His playmaking ability is generally considered one of his premier skills, and some analysts rank him among the greatest passers in NBA history.[443] By exploiting his size, vision, and the attention James garners from opposing defenses,[444] he creates easy points for his teammates with accurate assists.[445] James executes unconventional passes, including after leaving his feet and through defensive traffic.[446] His uncanny tendency to find the open man has helped force NBA teams to incorporate some elements of zone into their schemes to better cover the weak side of the court and prevent James from passing to open shooters.[431] Early in his career, James was criticized for overpassing in pressure situations, in particular for passing instead of shooting in the waning seconds of close games;[447][448] however, as his career progressed, James' clutch performance was viewed more favorably.[449] At the beginning of his NBA career, James was considered a poor defensive player,[450] but he improved steadily through the years. In 2009, James became proficient at the chase-down block, which involves coming in from behind the opposition in transition to block the shot.[74] In Miami, he developed into a more versatile defensive player, and the Heat relied on him to guard all five positions.[451] Along with Shane Battier and Dwyane Wade, Miami used James in an ultra-aggressive defensive scheme,[452] with James cheating off the ball to help out inside or get into rebounding position.[453] Beginning in 2014, some analysts reported a regression in his defensive impact, stemming from a lack of effort and expected age-related declines.[454][455] During his second stint in Cleveland, James' defense progressively declined. After missed drives on offense, he often dawdled back on defense while complaining to the referees; he provided less help off the ball, and was less aggressive in switching.[456] James himself admitted to taking plays off at times, referring to this approach as \"chill mode\".[457] He eventually developed a reputation for raising his defensive level in the playoffs, which some analysts referred to as \"Playoff LeBron\".[458] James left high school as one of the most hyped prospects in NBA history.[e] Upon entering the NBA, he made an immediate impact and was voted Rookie of the Year in his debut season.[464] As of 2024, James has been named to 20 All-NBA Teams, including 13 times to the First Team, which are both NBA records.[3] His four MVP awards are matched only by Michael Jordan, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Wilt Chamberlain, and Bill Russell; James and Russell are the only players to win four MVP awards in a five-year span.[465] James has also won four Finals MVP Awards, which is the second-most all-time,[466] and earned All-Defensive honors every season from 2009 to 2014.[5] While James has never won the Defensive Player of the Year Award, he has finished second in the voting twice and lists it as one of his main goals.[73][467] His teams have appeared in the Finals ten times and won four championships; his 10 Finals appearances are tied for third all-time.[f] Some analysts have criticized him for not having a better Finals record, while others have countered that James usually performed well but his team was defeated by superior competition.[469][470][471] On the basis of his career longevity and on-court performances, sports publications have consistently included James in rankings of the best basketball players in history,[g] and he was named the Associated Press Male Athlete of the Decade for the 2010s.[479] This has resulted in frequent comparisons to Michael Jordan.[a] In a 2016 interview with Sports Illustrated, James acknowledged that his motivation was surpassing Jordan as the greatest.[480] In February 2018, The Ringer spent an entire week devoted to both players, with Bill Simmons ultimately concluding that Jordan was still ahead.[481] In polls, James has ranked second behind Jordan.[482][483][484] The results strongly correlate with age, with older voters more commonly choosing Jordan.[483][484] Davis et al. of Business Insider stated: \"The data would suggest that younger, more-engaged NBA fans lean toward James, as he's still playing. Older generations who watched Jordan play and tune in less today lean toward Jordan.\"[484] Referring to James as the best challenger to Jordan's status as the greatest basketball player of all time, Sam Quinn of CBS Sports stated that \"the margin for error where Jordan is involved is overwhelmingly slim\" and that \"in the rings-obsessed basketball discourse\", Jordan having more titles and an \"unblemished Finals record holds significant weight\".[480] In addition to praising James' on-court accomplishments, analysts have also noted his influence on player empowerment throughout the NBA, which stemmed from his willingness to change teams during free agency. Ben Golliver of The Washington Post opined that James' move to the Heat in 2010 \"defined a decade of player movement\", and that he \"fundamentally flipped the power balance between stars and their organizations.\"[485] James' fellow players have also remarked on his influence, such as Warriors forward Draymond Green, who reflected: \"We've taken control of our destiny. And I think a lot of people hate that ... I think the doors that he's opened for athletes and especially basketball players is his biggest accomplishment.\"[486] Multiple current and former NBA players have suggested James' free agency decisions catalyzed the leaguewide trend in \"superteams\" in the 21st century.[487][488][489][490][491] In 2022, James voiced his desire to play into his forties potentially alongside or against his sons Bronny and Bryce.[492] This eventually happened when Bronny was selected by the Lakers 55th overall in the 2024 NBA draft, making them the first father-son duo in NBA history.[493] James married his high school sweetheart, Savannah James, on September 14, 2013, in San Diego, California.[494] They have three children: sons Bronny and Bryce, and daughter Zhuri.[492][495] Bronny was a standout high school basketball player, being named a McDonald's All-American in 2023, 20 years after James's selection.[496] During his stint with the Heat, James resided in Coconut Grove, where he bought a $9 million three-story mansion overlooking Biscayne Bay.[497] In November 2015, James bought a 9,350 square-foot (870 m2) East Coast-style mansion in Brentwood, Los Angeles, for about $21 million.[498] He purchased another home in Brentwood in December 2017 for $23 million.[499] In September 2020, he purchased a third home in Los Angeles, this one in Beverly Hills for $36.75 million.[500] James also owns a 30,000 square foot mansion in Akron, Ohio that he custom built in 2003 on his property and spent $2.1 million on it.[501] James's best friends in the NBA are Carmelo Anthony, Chris Paul, and former Heat teammate Dwyane Wade. The four have been referred to as the \"banana boat crew\". During an excursion to the Bahamas, James rescued Anthony from the water when Anthony was carried away from the boat by the current. During an Instagram Live session, Anthony later recounted: \"He saved my life\". When asked about how much danger Anthony was in prior to the rescue, James responded: \"I don't really know what to say, to be honest. I'm just happy he's still here, obviously.\"[502] James also maintains a friendship with fellow NBA player Draymond Green.[503] James invests heavily in his health, reportedly spending $1.5 million a year to pay for personal chefs, athletic trainers, and physical therapies for recovery. Kyle Korver has described James's fitness as being on \"another level\". However, James' routine is not perfectly clean; he drinks wine every night, believing it to be good for his heart,[504] while Tristan Thompson has stated that James eats desserts with every meal.[505] In January 2009, doctors at the Cleveland Clinic discovered a growth in the right side of James's jaw. Biopsy results showed that James developed a benign jaw tumor, specifically in his parotid gland,[506] which required a five-hour surgery to remove on June 2 after the end of the Cavaliers' run in the 2009 playoffs.[507] James is considered by fellow NBA players, media tabloids, and popular culture to be the \"face of the NBA\", often alongside Warriors superstar Stephen Curry.[508][509] His opinions have yielded significant influence on people who make important league decisions; for example, in 2014, James asked commissioner Adam Silver to increase the duration of the All-Star break, and the request was granted the following season.[510] On February 13, 2015, James was elected the first vice president of the National Basketball Players Association (NBPA).[511] Throughout his career, James has been ranked by Forbes as one of the world's most influential athletes,[h] and has been listed by Time as one of the 100 most influential people in the world.[514] During his first stint with the Cavaliers, James was adored by local fans, and Sherwin-Williams displayed a giant Nike-produced banner of James on its world headquarters.[515] Despite their affection for James, Cleveland fans and critics were frequently annoyed when he sported a Yankees hat when he attended Cleveland Indians baseball games against the New York Yankees.[516] Following his actions during the 2010 free agency period and The Decision, James was listed as one of the most disliked athletes in the United States.[517] By 2013, his image had mostly recovered and he was reported by ESPN as the most popular player in the NBA for the second time in his career.[518] In 2014, James was named the most popular male athlete in America by the Harris Poll.[519] He has led the league in jersey sales six times.[520] Memorabilia associated with James is highly sought after; two of James' rookie cards are among the most expensive basketball cards ever sold at auction, and one of those cards also briefly held the record for the most expensive modern-day sports card when it sold for $1.8 million at auction in July 2020.[523] A Mike Trout rookie card broke the record for a modern-day card the following month.[524] All jerseys worn in the 2020 NBA All-Star Game were auctioned by the NBA and NBPA to raise funds for charity; James' jersey sold for $630,000, setting a record for a modern-day sports jersey.[525] In March 2008, James became the first black man, as well as the third man overall after Richard Gere and George Clooney, to appear on the cover of Vogue, when he posed with Gisele Bündchen.[526] In response, ESPN columnist Jemele Hill considered the cover offensive and \"memorable for the wrong reasons\", describing the demeanor of James and his holding Bündchen as a reference to classic imagery of the movie monster King Kong, a dark savage capturing his fair-skinned love interest.[521][522] James has maintained close ties to his hometown of Akron, Ohio, which is also where his charity foundation, the LeBron James Family Foundation (LJFF), is based.[527] Since 2005, the foundation has held an annual bike-a-thon to raise money for various causes.[528] In 2015, James announced a partnership with the University of Akron to provide scholarships for as many as 2,300 children beginning in 2021.[529] In 2017, he received the J. Walter Kennedy Citizenship Award from the NBA for his \"outstanding service and dedication to the community.\"[530] In November 2017, the Akron School Board approved the I Promise School, a public elementary school created in a partnership with the LJFF to help struggling elementary school students stay in school.[531] The school officially opened on July 30, 2018, with James reflecting that it was his most important professional accomplishment.[532] Other noteworthy public and charitable initiatives undertaken by James in Akron include the I Promise Institute at the University of Akron,[533] I Promise Village (housing complex),[534] House Three-Thirty (community center/retail plaza),[535] and I Promise Health Quarters (medical center).[14] James is also an active supporter of various non-profit organizations, including After-School All-Stars, Boys & Girls Clubs of America, and Children's Defense Fund.[536][537][538] In 2016, he donated $2.5 million to the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture to support an exhibit on Muhammad Ali.[539] Throughout his career, James has taken public stances on controversial issues, and has mentioned a feeling of obligation to effect change using his status.[540] Those include the War in Darfur,[541] the killing of Trayvon Martin,[542] the now-former NBA owner Donald Sterling's racist comments in 2014,[540] the Michael Brown verdict,[543] the death of Eric Garner,[544] the U.S. national anthem kneeling protests,[545] the shooting of Breonna Taylor,[546] the death of Ma'Khia Bryant,[547] Kyle Rittenhouse,[548] and the ruling of Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization that overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.[549] On August 27, 2020, James and his Lakers teammates, as well as the Bucks, began boycotting the 2020 NBA playoffs to protest the shooting of Jacob Blake.[550] In response, senior White House advisor Jared Kushner stated that he was planning to reach out to James regarding the boycott. Following a players' committee to discuss the boycott, James and others reached out to former president Barack Obama, who reportedly advised them to continue playing and finish that year's NBA season.[551] During the 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests, a statement James made about a since-deleted tweet by Daryl Morey,[552] in which Morey expressed support for the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong, became the subject of controversy. James said Morey was \"misinformed\".[553] His statement drew backlash from protesters in the movement.[554][555] In February 2022, political commentator Bill Maher called James hypocritical for not taking a critical stance towards the Chinese government's human rights abuses.[556] James had taken various other stands on issues regarding sports, such as the Kaepernick controversy and the Houston Astros sign stealing scandal.[557][558] In October 2023, in response to the 2023 Israel–Hamas war, James voiced his support for Israel on Instagram.[559] His statement drew backlash for its omission of the Palestinians affected by the crisis, including from Palestinian-American leader and activist Omar Suleiman.[560][561][562] In June 2008, James donated $20,000 to a committee in support of Barack Obama for the 2008 U.S. presidential election.[563] Later that year, James gathered almost 20,000 people at the then-called Quicken Loans Arena for a viewing of Obama's 30-minute American Stories, American Solutions television advertisement.[564] The advertisement was shown on a large screen above the stage, where Jay-Z later held a free concert.[564] In November 2016, James endorsed and campaigned for Hillary Clinton for the 2016 U.S. presidential election.[565] Following a racist incident at his Los Angeles home in 2017, James expressed that \"being black in America is tough. We got a long way to go for us as a society and for us as African Americans until we feel equal in America.\"[566] Later on that year, in the aftermath of the Unite the Right rally, James questioned the \"Make America Great Again\" slogan and said: \"It's sad what's going on in Charlottesville. Is this the direction our country is heading? Make America Great Again huh? Our youth deserve better!!\"[567] James also called President Donald Trump a \"bum\" after the president rescinded a White House invitation to Stephen Curry.[568] During a 2018 interview with CNN journalist Don Lemon, James then accused Trump of attempting to divide the country with sports, suggesting that \"sports has never been something that divides people it's always been something that brings someone together.\" He declared that he would \"never sit across from him. I'd sit across from Obama though.\"[569][570] In response, Trump tweeted: \"LeBron James was just interviewed by the dumbest man on television, Don Lemon. He made LeBron look smart, which isn't easy to do.\"[571] On August 19, 2020, James announced his intentions to support the Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign and that of his running-mate Kamala Harris in advance of the 2020 U.S. presidential election.[572] James spoke in support of the More Than a Vote movement and encouraged members of the African-American community to vote,[573] saying, \"People in our community have been just lied to for so many years. We have people that have had convictions in the past, that've been told they cannot vote because they got a conviction. That is voter suppression.\"[574] On October 31, 2024, James announced his support for the Kamala Harris 2024 presidential campaign in the 2024 U.S. presidential election.[575] According to Forbes, in May 2023, James became the first active NBA player to become a billionaire.[576] James' biography LeBron was published on April 11, 2023, by Jeff Benedict. The biography is based on three years of research and more than 250 interviews.[577] James has signed numerous endorsement contracts; some of the companies that he has done business with are AT&T,[578] Audemars Piguet,[579] Beats by Dre,[580] Blaze Pizza,[581] Coca-Cola,[582] Dunkin' Brands,[583] Intel,[584] Kia,[585] McDonald's,[586] Nike,[582]PepsiCo,[587] State Farm,[588] and Taco Bell.[589] Coming out of high school, James was the target of a three-way bidding war among Nike, Reebok, and Adidas,[590] eventually signing a seven-year deal with Nike in 2003[591] for approximately $90 million.[592] His signature shoes have performed well for Nike.[593] In 2011, Fenway Sports Group became the sole global marketer of his rights, and as part of the deal, James was granted a minority stake in the English Premier League football club Liverpool,[594] who he has claimed his support for.[595] As a result of his endorsement money and NBA salary, James has been listed as one of the world's highest-paid athletes.[596] In 2013, he surpassed Bryant as the highest paid basketball player in the world, with earnings of $56.5 million.[597] In 2014, James realized a profit of more than $30 million as part of Apple's acquisition of Beats Electronics; he had originally struck a deal to get a small stake in the company at its inception in exchange for promoting its headphones.[598] In 2015, James was ranked the sixth highest earning sportsperson,[599] and third highest in 2016 (after Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi).[600] James has stated that he would like to own an NBA team in the future, albeit in a hands-off capacity.[601] In 2011, James co-founded the designer retail store UNKNWN in Miami, Florida.[602] During Super Bowl LVI in 2022, James appeared in a Crypto.com advertisement, where he conversed with a CGI version of his younger self, offering advice about the future. The commercial, produced by James' SpringHill Company and directed by Calmatic, did not directly promote the service, sparked social media buzz, and inspired a series of memes centered on the advice he could have offered.[603] Subsequently, Crypto.com launched an NFT airdrop campaign, distributing 5,550 tokens featuring the NBA champion. Participants were chosen randomly from those who scanned a QR code in the Super Bowl ad.[604] Also, in 2022, James' charity LeBron James Family Foundation, partnered with Crypto.com to educate underserved Akron communities with blockchain-related knowledge and Web3 tools, aiming to ensure inclusive advancement in the digital age.[605][606] James and comedian Jimmy Kimmel co-hosted the 2007 ESPY Awards.[607] In other comedic pursuits, he hosted the 33rd-season premiere of Saturday Night Live.[608] James has also tried his hand at acting, appearing in a cameo role on the HBO series Entourage.[609] In 2015, he played himself in the Judd Apatow film Trainwreck,[610] receiving positive reviews for his performance.[611] That same year, James' digital video company Uninterrupted raised $15.8 million from Warner Bros. Entertainment and Turner Sports to help expand the company's efforts to bring athlete-created content to fans. It is hosted on Bleacher Report and is used by several other athletes including Tampa Bay Buccaneers tight end Rob Gronkowski and cornerback Richard Sherman.[612] James and his business partner Maverick Carter own production company SpringHill Entertainment,[613] whose first work was the Lions Gate documentary More Than a Game, which was released in 2009 and chronicled James' high school years.[614] Series produced by SpringHill include the NBC game show The Wall,[615] the Disney XD sports documentary show Becoming,[616] the Starz sitcom Survivor's Remorse,[617] and the animated web series The LeBrons.[618] In 2016, CNBC aired an unscripted series hosted by James called Cleveland Hustles, where four up-and-coming Northern Ohio entrepreneurs will be financed on the condition of revitalizing a neighborhood in Cleveland.[619] In the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival, a 60-minute Vince Carter documentary entitled The Carter Effect was executive produced by James and Maverick Carter along with rapper Drake and Future the Prince.[620][621] In February 2018, it was announced that James' production company will produce a new film in the House Party series with James expected to make a cameo.[622] Later that month, Fox News host Laura Ingraham told James to \"shut up and dribble\" as a response to his political agendas.[623] This largely contributed to James creating a documentary film series looking at the changing role of athletes in the current political and cultural climate, aptly named, Shut Up and Dribble on Showtime.[624] James partnered with Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2018 to found Ladder, a company that developed nutritional supplements to help athletes with severe cramps after dealing with that issue during the 2014 Finals.[625] In February 2019, it was revealed that James would executive produce rapper 2 Chainz's new album Rap or Go to the League.[626] A Def Jam press release said the intent of the album is \"celebrating black excellence and focusing on the power of education and entrepreneurship.\" The press release also says the title \"challenges the notion that the only way out of the inner city is either to become a rapper or a ball player.\"[627] As of June 2023, James is the most followed basketball player on Instagram, with over 155 million followers.[628] In June 2022, it was announced James was launching a media company in partnership with professional tennis player Naomi Osaka and Maverick Carter. The production and content creation company will be named Hana Kuma, which means \"flower\" and \"bear\" in Japanese.[629] In March 2024, James and JJ Redick launched a podcast called Mind the Game, where the two have \"pure conversations about basketball.\"[630][631][632] In 2012, James, Carter and Paul Wachter made an investment of less than $1 million in the Pasadena-based fast casual chain Blaze Pizza; their investment had grown to $25 million by 2017.[633] James later became a spokesman for the company and began appearing in advertisements after ending his contract with McDonald's.[633] During the 2019 offseason, James filed for a trademark through a shell company on the term \"Taco Tuesday\" for use in downloadable audio/visual works, podcasts, social media, online marketing, and entertainment services.[634] This was related to James's use of the term on Instagram for his family's taco dinners. The request was denied by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, stating that Taco Tuesday was \"a commonplace term, message or expression widely used by a variety of sources that merely conveys an ordinary, familiar, well-recognized concept or sentiment.\"[635] In November 2020, James became an angel investor of the tequila and mezcal company Lobos 1707.[636] After personal frustration with comments on the Black Lives Matter movement made by Republican U.S. senator Kelly Loeffler, who at the time was the owner of the WNBA's Atlanta Dream, James assisted Dream player Renee Montgomery in her ultimately successful bid to buy the team in March 2021.[637] That same year, James joined Fenway Sports Group as a partner, making him a part-owner of the Boston Red Sox, New England Sports Network, RFK Racing, and Liverpool F.C., the latter of which he already owned a two-percent share in individually.[638] The investment made James and Carter the company's first black partners.[638] James has expressed his interest in owning an NBA team once he finishes playing basketball, specifically a team located in Las Vegas, Nevada, either through expansion or relocation.[639] In August 2022, James, alongside Canadian musician Drake, became part owners of the Italian football club A.C. Milan.[640] James is also a part owner of the Pittsburgh Penguins of the National Hockey League (NHL).[641] James is represented by agent Rich Paul of Klutch Sports.[642] His first agent was Aaron Goodwin, whom he left in 2005 for Leon Rose. Rose joined Creative Artists Agency (CAA) in 2007, and he worked with fellow CAA agent Henry Thomas, who represented Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh, to bring James to Miami in 2010. James left CAA for Paul in 2012.[643] James, Paul, Maverick Carter, and Randy Mims—all childhood friends—formed agent and sports-marketing company LRMR after James left Goodwin. LRMR handles James's marketing, including the marketing of The Decision, for which it was criticized.[644][645] Throughout his career, James has taken a unique approach to his NBA contracts, usually opting to sign shorter-term deals in order to maximize his earnings potential and flexibility;[115][646][647] in 2006, James and the Cavaliers negotiated a three-year, $60 million contract extension instead of the four-year maximum as it allotted him the option of seeking a new contract worth more money as an unrestricted free agent following the 2010 season.[648] This move ultimately allowed James, Dwyane Wade, and Chris Bosh to sign together with the Heat.[649] During the 2011 NBA lockout, James received contract offers to play professional football from the Dallas Cowboys and Seattle Seahawks,[650] which he gave serious consideration to and even began training with it in mind.[651] During his second stint in Cleveland, based on a negotiation strategy devised by NBA agent Mark Termini, who worked with Paul and specialized in contract negotiation and construction,[652] James began opting out,[653] or re-signing,[654][655] on new contracts after each season in order to take advantage of higher salaries resulting from the NBA's rising salary cap.[174] In 2016, he signed with the Cavaliers on a three-year deal,[656] becoming the highest-paid player in the league for the first time in his career.[657]",

                "content": "LeBron Raymone James Sr. (born December 30, 1984[2]) is an American professional basketball player who plays in the National Basketball Association (NBA) on the Los Angeles Lakers with 17 titles. He is married with Savannah Brinson James and has 3 children. They are Bronny James, Bryce James, and Zhuri James. He is also a film producer and a business man. Among the best basketball players of the twenty-first century, he has a lot of experience. Both Space Jam: A New Legacy and Trainwreck featured him as himself. He is the proprietor of the SpringHill Company. The Cleveland Cavaliers picked him in the 2003 NBA Draft with the first pick in the draft, not only for his athletics ability but for the revenue he could bring to the team and city. James did not play college basketball, and entered the NBA Draft immediately after high school. He went to high school in Akron, Ohio. James played with the Cavaliers for his first seven seasons. During that time, he was one of the NBA's top scorers. He was selected as an All-Star several times. In 2007, he led Cleveland to the NBA Finals. He was the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the NBA for the 2008-09 NBA season and 2009-10 NBA season. On July 8, 2010, on a show in ESPN called \"The Decision\" LeBron said that he would next play for the Miami Heat.[3] On December 2, 2010, James played in Cleveland for the first time since leaving, scoring 38 points for the Heat as they beat the Cavaliers, 118-90. Many fans angry at James for leaving Cleveland booed him throughout the game and held up signs with negative statements against James.[4] In the 2011 season the Miami Heat came in second place right behind the Chicago Bulls lead by Derrick Rose in the NBA. They made it to the finals of the NBA and lost in six games to the Dallas Mavericks [5] This caused celebration in Cleveland because they hated LeBron for what he did to them.[6] In the 2012 Finals, LeBron James won his first championship after the Miami Heat defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder 4-1 games, after battling with the Boston Celtics 4-3 games the previous round. The next year, LeBron James won his second title when the Heat defeated the San Antonio Spurs in seven games. In both years he won the MVP title of finals and of regular season. In 2014, James competed a good season but he wasn't the MVP. In the 2014 Finals, the Heat's Finals streak ended after being defeated by the San Antonio Spurs in five games (4-1).[7] Shortly after those Finals had ended, LeBron James said he would use an early termination option in his contract, leaving the Miami Heat and becoming a free agent. He said this on June 24, 2014.[8] Then, on June 25, 2014, in a first-person essay in Sports Illustrated, he said he would return to the Cleveland Cavaliers. On July 12, 2014, James signed a two-year, $42.1 million contract to return to the Cavaliers. The deal also contains an option to become a free agent again after the 2014–15 NBA season.[9] LeBron now plays on the Los Angeles Lakers. In 2015, he took the Cleveland Cavaliers to the NBA Finals, without Kevin Love but lost to the Golden State Warriors in 6 games after losing Kyrie Irving after he had an ankle injury. He led the Cleveland Cavaliers to an NBA championship after being down 3-1 games to their first-ever title in 2016 and later played a crucial role in bringing glory to the Los Angeles Lakers.[10] No team had ever come back from a 3-1 deficit in the Finals before. He had a historic moment where he blocked Andre Iguodala on possibly the game winning layup. The Cavaliers went on to lose to the Golden State Warriors the following season. Now with the Lakers he passed Kobe Bryant. On August 18, 2022, James re-signed with the Los Angeles Lakers on a two-year, $97.1M deal.[11][12] The contract extension made James the highest-paid athlete in NBA history at $528.9M, surpassing Kevin Durant in all-time earnings.[13] In 2021, James starred in Space Jam: A New Legacy where he played a version of himself. LeBron is widely considered to be the greatest basketball player of all time, as well as one of the most influential athletes and sports players in the world.[14] On February 7, 2023, James surpassed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's 38,387-point total during a game against the Oklahoma City Thunder. Currently, LeBron is staying at 40,474, which is 2087 higher than Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. He was the youngest player to reach this point. He is also well known for his assists, and with 10,759, he is now the player with the fourth-most assistances. James and Michael Jordan are the only players to win an NBA MVP award, NBA title, NBA Finals MVP, and Olympic gold medal in the same calendar year. The USA would go on to win the Olympics twice.[15] Since even before he made his NBA debut, James has been associated with Nike. They In 2003, he agreed to a seven-year contract with the business that was worth little under $90 million. Many people at the time questioned whether Nike put a little too much faith in an 18-year-old who had never played a professional game. LeBron became one of the biggest players in the NBA and a four-time MVP as a result of the risk, which paid off brilliantly. James has been a success for Nike off the court as well, in addition to on it. Until now the sales of his signature sneaker reached $340 million between February 2014 and January 2015, making him the highest-paid employee at the company.[16]",

LeBron James is an American professional basketball player who is widely considered one of the greatest all-around basketball players of all time. James has won four National Basketball Association championships with three different teams, and he has been named NBA MVP four times. In 2023 he became the NBA’s all-time leading scorer, and in 2024 he became the first NBA player to score 40,000 points. James has also won gold medals at the Olympics, in 2008 and 2012. LeBron James, who was born in 1984 in Akron, Ohio, became a locally known basketball prodigy while in elementary school. James led Akron’s St. Vincent–St. Mary High School to three state championships in four years. He was named Ohio’s Mr. Basketball—the high-school player of the year—three times during 2001–03. LeBron James was selected first overall in the 2003 National Basketball Association draft by the Cleveland Cavaliers. He played for the Cavaliers through the end of the 2009–10 season. He then signed with the Miami Heat but returned to the Cavaliers in 2014. James joined the Los Angeles Lakers in 2018. He won NBA championships with all three teams. LeBron James has won four National Basketball Association championships. He won his first two championships with the Miami Heat in 2012 and 2013. He won a third championship with the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2016. His fourth championship came with the Los Angeles Lakers in 2020. LeBron James (born December 30, 1984, Akron, Ohio, U.S.) is an American professional basketball player who is widely considered one of the greatest all-around players of all time and who won National Basketball Association (NBA) championships with the Miami Heat (2012 and 2013), the Cleveland Cavaliers (2016), and the Los Angeles Lakers (2020). In 2023 he became the NBA’s all-time leading scorer, breaking the record (38,387) previously held by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. His dominance continued when in 2024, he recorded his 40,000 point scored. Find out where he ranks in our list of the greatest basketball players. A locally known basketball prodigy since elementary school, James was named Ohio’s Mr. Basketball (high-school player of the year) three times while leading Akron’s St. Vincent–St. Mary High School to three Ohio state championships in his four years on the team. He became a national media sensation in his junior year after appearing on the cover of Sports Illustrated, where he was billed by the magazine as “The Chosen One.” James was the consensus national high-school player of the year in his senior season, and he was selected by the Cleveland Cavaliers with the first overall selection of the 2003 NBA draft. Additionally, he signed an unprecedented $90 million endorsement contract with the Nike shoe company before he ever played a professional game. Despite the pressures brought on by these singular circumstances, James led the Cavaliers in scoring, steals, and minutes played over the course of the 2003–04 season, winning the league’s Rookie of the Year award in the process. A 6-foot 9-inch (2.06-meter) “point forward” who was as adept at bringing the ball down the court as at playing near the basket, James presented a unique challenge for opposing teams; his unmatched athleticism and well-muscled body would not have been out of place in the National Football League. His game progressed over the following years. He was voted one of the starting forwards on the Eastern Conference All-Star team during his second season, and in his third season he led the Cavaliers to their first playoff berth in nine years. These accomplishments were exceeded during the 2006–07 season, when James guided Cleveland to the franchise’s first berth in the NBA finals. After the Cavaliers upset the favored Detroit Pistons in the Eastern Conference finals, the Cavaliers were swept by the San Antonio Spurs in the NBA finals, but James’s impressive postseason play led many observers to place him among the very best players in the league. He led the NBA in scoring during the 2007–08 season and earned first team All-NBA honors, but the Cavaliers lost to the eventual champion Boston Celtics in a dramatic seven-game series in the Eastern Conference semifinals. James piloted the Cavaliers to a team-record 66 wins during the 2008–09 season, which helped to earn him the league’s Most Valuable Player (MVP) award. The following season James averaged nearly 30 points per game as he was again named MVP. At the end of the 2009–10 season, James became arguably the most sought-after free agent in NBA history when his contract with the Cavaliers expired, and he began a prolonged courtship process with a number of teams that had in some cases been planning for his free agency for over two years. In an unprecedented hour-long television special, criticized by many for its undue grandiosity, James announced that he was signing with the Heat. He helped Miami reach the NBA finals in his first year with the team, but the Heat lost the championship to the Dallas Mavericks. In the 2011–12 season James averaged 27.1 points per game and won his third MVP award while helping Miami advance to its second consecutive NBA finals appearance. Backed by his stellar play—James was named the finals MVP—the Heat defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder to win the championship. He had arguably his greatest individual season in 2012–13, as he averaged 26.8 points, 7.3 assists, and a career-high 8.0 rebounds per game while posting a .565 field-goal percentage, a remarkable rate of made shots for someone who so frequently played away from the basket. James also helped Miami win 27 consecutive games that season (the second longest such streak in NBA history), and he was rewarded with his fourth league MVP award. In the following postseason, the Heat defeated the San Antonio Spurs in a seven-game series to win the NBA championship, and James was again named the finals MVP. He continued his stellar play in the following season, even increasing his shooting percentage by .002, and he again led the Heat to an appearance in the NBA finals. However, Miami lost that rematch with the Spurs in a five-game series. After that finals loss, James opted out of his contract with the Heat, leaving an aging Miami roster, and—after a week of frenzied speculation among fans and media—he decided to return to Cleveland. Although his 25.3 points per game was James’s lowest scoring average since his rookie season, he nevertheless guided a young and inexperienced Cavaliers roster to the second best record in the Eastern Conference in 2014–15. In the following postseason he led an injury-laden Cleveland team to just two playoff losses en route to a berth in the NBA finals. There James had one of the greatest individual performances in finals history, averaging 35.8 points, 13.3 rebounds, and 8.8 assists per game while leading the undermanned Cavaliers to the franchise’s first two finals victories before ultimately losing a six-game series to the Golden State Warriors. James had another strong regular season in 2015–16 but, once again, truly shined in the playoffs. He led the Cavaliers to a rematch against the Warriors, who had set a league record with 73 wins during the regular season, in the NBA finals. There the Cavaliers became the first team to come back from a 3–1 finals deficit to capture the first title in franchise history and end a 52-year title drought for Cleveland professional sports teams. James averaged 29.7 points, 11.3 rebounds, 8.9 assists, 2.6 steals, and 2.3 blocks per game in the finals—becoming the first person to lead all five statistical categories for players on both teams in the finals—and was unanimously named finals MVP. In 2016–17 James had arguably his best regular season by setting career highs with averages of 8.7 assists and 8.6 rebounds per game while still scoring 26.4 points per game. He sustained his excellence in the Eastern Conference playoffs, scoring 32.5 points per game (which included his 5,988th career postseason point, breaking Michael Jordan’s all-time NBA playoff scoring record) while leading the Cavaliers to a third consecutive match-up against the Warriors in the NBA finals. There Cleveland could not overcome the team James referred to as a “juggernaut,” losing to the Warriors in five games despite James becoming the first player in NBA history to average a triple-double over the course of the finals (with 33.6 points, 12 rebounds, and 10 assists per game). In 2017–18 he played a full 82-game regular season for the first time in his career and led the NBA in minutes played per game (36.9) while averaging 27.5 points, 8.6 rebounds, and a new career-high 9.1 assists per game. James again excelled in the following playoffs, scoring more than 40 points seven times in the team’s 18 Eastern Conference postseason games (which included two seven-game series) to lead the Cavaliers to their fourth straight NBA finals series against the Warriors. He continued his strong individual play in the finals, but it was not enough to overcome Golden State’s overwhelming talent advantage, and the Warriors swept the series. In the following off-season, James, a free agent, joined the Los Angeles Lakers. He continued to play at a high level, averaging 27.4 points, 8.5 rebounds, and 8.3 assists per game, but he missed significant playing time because of an injury (a strained groin) for the first time in his career. The Lakers struggled in his absence and ultimately finished the 2018–19 season with a 37–45 record, ending James’s personal playoff streak at 13 seasons. The following season was disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused a four-month suspension. Play resumed in July 2020 with a shortened schedule, and the Lakers ultimately defeated the Miami Heat to claim the franchise’s 17th NBA title. James’s dominating performance—he averaged 29.8 points, 11.8 rebounds, and 8.5 assists per game—earned him his fourth finals MVP award. In addition to his achievements in the NBA, James was a member of the U.S. men’s Olympic basketball teams that won the bronze medal at the 2004 Games, the gold medal at the 2008 Games, and the gold at the 2012 Games. James did not return to Olympic competition until the 2024 Paris Games, and there he led the U.S. team to a fifth consecutive gold medal and was named the tournament’s MVP. Off the court, James occasionally acted, notably appearing as himself in Judd Apatow’s comedy Trainwreck (2015). In 2021 he appeared in the live-action/animated Space Jam: A New Legacy. James also published a memoir, Shooting Stars (2009; cowritten with Buzz Bissinger), that chronicles his years as a high-school standout.",

Watch the 2024 Olympics on Peacock Team USA relied on James to avoid two potential exhibition losses in the week leading up to the Summer Games. He netted 23 points against South Sudan—including the game-winning layup with 8 seconds remaining—on July 20 and scored the final 11 points in a 92-88 win over Germany two days later. James earned an additional honor at the Games: leading the U.S. delegation as the male flag bearer in the opening ceremony along the Seine River on July 26. “It’s special to get an opportunity to represent your country in another fashion. I understand how prestigious this moment is,” James said. Joining him as the female flag bearer is tennis player Coco Gauff. Basketball player LeBron James is the NBA’s all-time leading scorer who currently plays for the Los Angeles Lakers. James first garnered national attention as the top high school basketball player in the country before being drafted by the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2003. With his unique combination of size, athleticism, and court vision, he became a four-time NBA MVP. After leading the Miami Heat to titles in 2012 and 2013, James returned to the Cavaliers and helped the franchise claim its first championship in 2016. Since joining Los Angeles in 2018, he has won an additional NBA championship and became the all-time leading scorer in league history. FULL NAME: LeBron Raymone JamesBORN: December 30, 1984BIRTHPLACE: Akron, OhioSPOUSE: Savannah James (2013-present)CHILDREN: LeBron Jr., Bryce, and ZhuriASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Capricorn LeBron Raymone James was born on December 30, 1984, in Akron, Ohio. At an early age, he showed a natural talent for basketball. James was recruited by St. Vincent-St. Mary High School to join their basketball team in 1999. As a freshman, James averaged 18 points per game. He helped the team to a Division III state title by scoring 25 points in the championship game. Word of his advanced basketball skills spread, and James received several honors for his performance. As a high school sophomore, James was chosen for the USA Today All-USA First Team. He was the first sophomore ever selected for this award. His team also won the Division III state title for the second year in a row. The following school year, James was named Parade magazine’s High School Boys Basketball Player of the Year and Gatorade Player of the Year. Following the end of his junior year, James was such a strong player that he contemplated going pro. Deciding to finish his education, James had a tremendous senior year on the court. He averaged 31.6 points per game, helping his team clinch their third state title. The St. Vincent-St. Mary High School team also earned the top national ranking that year. Throughout his high school playing career, James totaled 2,657 points, 892 rebounds, and 523 assists. He would soon emerged as one of the NBA’s leading players. With his impressive record, it was no surprise that James was the first player picked in the 2003 NBA Draft straight out of high school. The Cleveland Cavaliers signed the powerful young forward, and he proved to be a valuable addition to the then-struggling franchise. The team had ended the previous season in eighth place in the Eastern Conference. During the 2003-04 season, James made history when he became the first member of the Cavalier franchise to win the NBA Rookie of the Year Award. At only 20 years old, he also became the youngest player to receive this honor. Additionally, James averaged 20 points per game at this time and became one of only three rookies to accomplish this feat, putting him in the same company as Michael Jordan and Oscar Robertson. James continued to excel professionally in the NBA the following season, upping his average points per game to 27.2. He made NBA history again in 2005 when he became the youngest player to score more than 50 points in one game. In 2006, James helped the Cleveland Cavaliers defeat the Washington Wizards in the first round of playoff action. From there, his team took on the Detroit Pistons in the Eastern Conference semifinals. James scored an average of 26.6 per game in this postseason matchup, but it wasn’t enough to secure victory. While the Cavaliers weren’t at the top of the rankings, James continued to receive special recognition for his individual abilities. Also that year, James reached a new contract agreement with the Cavaliers. The team proved to be stronger competitors the following season, defeating Detroit to win the Eastern Conference. In the NBA Finals against the San Antonio Spurs, however, the Cavaliers lost their championship bid in four consecutive games. During the 2007-08 season, James continued to help the Cavaliers improve their standing in the Eastern Conference. The team made it to the semifinals, where they were defeated by the Boston Celtics in seven games. In terms of individual performance, James had a stellar year, outperforming such rival players as Kobe Bryant and Allen Iverson, by scoring an average of 30 points per game, the highest average in the NBA regular season. Early in the 2008-09 season, sports journalists and fans began talking about James’ future in the sport. He had the option to become a free agent in 2010, and there was much discussion as to where James would end up. Some journalists identified the New York Knicks as a potential suitor for the rising player. James made several references to his impending free-agent status, but he was sure to downplay the matter. “I am focused on the team that I am on right now and winning a championship... I don’t think about making a change at this point,” James told reporters. Shortly after becoming a free agent, James announced that he would be joining the Miami Heat for the 2010-11 season. His fans in Cleveland were less than pleased, and many considered his departure a betrayal to his hometown. Soon after James’ announcement, Cleveland Cavaliers majority owner Dan Gilbert wrote an open letter declaring James’ decision as “selfish,” “heartless” and a “cowardly betrayal.” Unfazed, James finished second in the league during his first season with the Heat, scoring 26.7 points per game. The 2011-12 season saw major success for James and the Miami Heat. With his team’s victory over the Oklahoma City Thunder in the NBA Finals, the superstar forward finally earned his first title. In the clinching Game 5, James scored 26 points and had 11 rebounds and 13 assists. “I made a difficult decision to leave Cleveland, but I understood what my future was about,” James told Fox Sports following the game. “I knew we had a bright future [in Miami].” During the 2012-13 season, James made NBA history yet again: On January 16, 2013, at age 28, he became the youngest player to score 20,000 points, succeeding Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers—who accomplished this feat when he was 29—and becoming only the 38th player in NBA history to achieve this distinction. James made a jump shot the final seconds of the game, bringing his scoring total 20,001 and leading the Heat to a 92-75 victory over the Golden State Warriors. Success followed the Heat to the end of the 2012-13 season: Following a hard-fought, six-game series against the Indiana Pacers to win the Eastern Conference, Miami outlasted the San Antonio Spurs in seven games to win its second consecutive NBA championship. At the culmination of the 2013-14 season, Miami returned to the NBA Finals to face off against the Spurs again, this time losing to San Antonio after five games. In July 2014, after opting out of his contract with the Heat and considering other teams, James announced that he was returning to the Cavaliers. Hampered by back and knee problems, James missed 13 of 82 regular-season games in 2014-15. However, he was as dominant as ever when healthy, averaging 25.3 points and 7.4 assists per game. James led the Cavaliers to the NBA Finals, becoming the first player in nearly 50 years to reach the championship round in five consecutive seasons. However, injuries to star teammates Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving damaged his hopes of claiming a third title, and the Cavaliers lost to the Golden State Warriors in six games. Over the course of 2015-16, the Cavs overcame the distraction of a mid-season coaching change and breezed through the playoffs to earn a rematch with the Warriors, marking the sixth straight NBA Finals appearance for “King James.” In perhaps the crowning achievement of his career, he led his team back from a 3-1 deficit, scoring 41 points in both Games 5 and 6, before recording a triple-double in Game 7 to give the Cavs their first championship in franchise history. Voted Finals MVP, James said: “I came back to bring a championship to our city. I knew what I was capable of doing. I knew what I learned in the last couple years that I was gone, and I knew if I had to—when I came back—I knew I had the right ingredients and the right blueprint to help this franchise get back to a place that we’ve never been. That’s what it was all about.” The following year, James again paced himself and took charge when necessary, driving the Cavs through the Eastern Conference to make an incredible seventh consecutive appearance in the NBA Finals. This time, with former MVP Kevin Durant added to the mix, the Warriors proved too formidable for James and his teammates, who lost the championship in five games. For all his accomplishments, James achieved another first early in the 2017-18 NBA season: After yelling at a referee during a late November win over the Heat, he was ejected for the first time in 1,082 career games. The superstar likely felt like yelling often during the course of a frustrating campaign, as an offseason trade that sent Irving to Boston for Isaiah Thomas failed to bear fruit and forced the Cavs to make another major deal before the All-Star break. After averaging a career-best 9.1 assists in the regular season, James had to dig deep just to get the team out of the first round of the playoffs, delivering a brilliant 45-point effort to sink the Pacers in Game 7. The Cavs were again pushed to the limit two rounds later by the scrappy Boston Celtics, but James scored 81 points over the last two games to pull out the series win and make his eighth straight NBA Finals appearance. Game 1 of the rematch against Golden State went down to the wire, thanks to James’ 51-point outburst, but Cleveland guard J.R. Smith inexplicably dribbled out the clock with the game tied in regulation before the Warriors pulled away for the win in overtime. That represented the Cavs’ best chance to get a leg up on their opponents, as the Warriors won the next three games handily to claim their third title in four years. Afterward, with questions swirling about his future with the team, James revealed that he had played out the series with a broken right hand after punching a whiteboard in the aftermath of the Game 1 loss. On July 1, 2018, James announced that he was moving on to the next chapter of his career by signing a four-year, $153.3 million contract with the Los Angeles Lakers, a storied franchise that counted Kobe Bryant, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Magic Johnson among its all-time greats. The good vibes had worn off by midseason, as the Lakers sputtered through a 17-game stretch without their injured star. With the team still struggling in late February 2019, James accused his teammates of losing focus over trade rumors, saying, “If you’re still allowing distractions to affect the way you play, this is the wrong franchise to be a part of and you should just come in and be like, ‘Listen, I can’t do this.’” When the Lakers were officially eliminated from playoff contention in March 2019, it snapped James’ personal marks of 13 consecutive postseasons and eight straight NBA Finals appearances. Capping a difficult first season in Los Angeles, the Lakers announced that their star would miss the final six games because of his lingering groin injury. Things got off to a much better start the following season, thanks in large part to the addition of athletic big man Anthony Davis to the roster. Spearheading the Lakers’ rise to the top of the standings was James, who became the first player to record a triple-double against all 30 NBA teams in November 2019. The following month, James added another accolade to his ever-growing list by earning AP Male Athlete of the Decade honors. James won his fourth championship in 2020, when the Lakers defeated the Miami Heat in a special playoff tournament held at the Walt Disney World resort following the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic. James was selected for the NBA All-Star Game for the first time in 2005 and has earned a spot in the annual showcase in each of the next 19 seasons—an NBA record streak. In January 2018, the league announced James and Golden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry had topped the ballots and would serve as captains for that year’s All-Star Game. In 2006, James was named MVP in the NBA All-Star Game, a feat he repeated in 2008 and 2018. James has also been named NBA MVP in four seasons: 2008-09, 2009-10, 2011-12, and 2012-13. In January 2018, at age 33, James surpassed Kobe Bryant as the youngest player to accumulate 30,000 career points and became the seventh player in NBA history to achieve that milestone. The feat put him just more than 8,000 points shy of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s all-time record of 38,387 points. James continued to surpass other legends in ensuing seasons, topping Michael Jordan’s career tally of 32,292 points in 2019 to move into fourth place all-time. In January 2020, he eclipsed Bryant’s total of 33,643 points to move into third place, one night before his predecessor’s shocking death in a helicopter accident. Then, on February 7, 2023, James scored 38 points in a loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder—setting the all-time mark with Abdul-Jabbar sitting courtside. “I didn’t set this as a goal, so that’s probably why it’s so surreal and so weird to me,” James said. “I never talked about being the all-time scorer in NBA history… until my numbers started getting closer and closer, and I was like, ‘Oh wow, this is crazy. This is weird, but I guess I’m doing it.’” As of July 2024, James is also fourth in league history in assists (11,009) and eighth in steals (2,275). After 21 NBA seasons, James’ stats include regular season per-game averages of: James has competed on the U.S. Olympic basketball team during four Summer Olympic Games: in 2004, 2008, 2012, and 2024. He made his Olympic debut at the 2004 Summer Games in Athens, Greece. He and his teammates won bronze medals after defeating Lithuania. Argentina took home the gold after beating Italy in the finals. In the summer of 2008, James traveled to Beijing to play with the likes of Kobe Bryant, Jason Kidd, and Dwyane Wade on Team USA. This time around the Americans brought home the gold after defeating Spain in the final round. James competed at his third Olympic Games in 2012, at the Summer Olympics in London, along with Kevin Durant, Bryant, Carmelo Anthony, and several other top players. The U.S. basketball team took the gold medal again, marking James’ second consecutive Olympic gold. After sitting out the 2016 and 2020 Games, James is competing for his third gold medal at the Paris Olympics this year. He was also selected to serve as the male flag bearer for the entire U.S. delegation at the opening ceremony. As of July 2024, Celebrity Net Worth estimates James’ total fortune at around $800 million. According to ESPN, he is currently the sixth-highest paid player in the NBA, earning just under $50 million for the upcoming season. James’ fortune largely stems from his playing salary and a series of lucrative endorsements. The NBA superstar previously signed a four-year, $153.3 million contract with the Lakers in July 2018. Off the court, James has inked several partnerships since turning pro, including a deal with Nike for $90 million that could net him over $1 billion over his lifetime. Some of his other endorsements have included Intel, Verizon, Coca-Cola, Beats by Dre, and Kia Motors. James is also an investor in Blaze Pizza. On January 1, 2012, James proposed to his high school sweetheart, Savannah Brinson. The couple married in a private ceremony with about 200 guests in San Diego on September 14, 2013. LeBron and Savannah have two sons and one daughter together. In October 2004, they welcomed their first son, LeBron Jr., nicknamed “Bronny.” On June 14, 2007, Savannah gave birth to their second son, Bryce. Their daughter, Zhuri, was born on October 22, 2014. Like his father, Bronny became a basketball phenom as a teenager and one of the most sought-after recruits in the country while attending the Sierra Canyon School. He played collegiately at the University of Southern California during the 2023-24 season before entering the NBA draft. The Lakers selected Bronny with the 55th overall pick, pairing him with his father in Los Angeles. “I’m going to hold him accountable, and he should hold me accountable when I do things not right. I can separate dad from teammate,” LeBron told Today. “And, I think, as he continues to grow, and as he continues to learn, I hope he’s able to separate son from teammate, as well.” Outside of the NBA, James has worked to help others. He established the LeBron James Family Foundation in 2004, along with his mother, Gloria, to help out children and single-parent families in need. Among its many programs, the organization builds playgrounds in economically disadvantaged areas and hosts an annual bike-a-thon. One of the world’s most recognizable athletes, James hasn’t been shy about expressing his views on social media. Among other issues, he displayed his support for Trayvon Martin after the teen’s death in 2012, and he has clashed with President Donald Trump. James waded into delicate territory in October 2019, after Houston Rockets GM Daryl Morey posted a tweet in support of Hong Kong’s pro-democracy protesters that ignited a Chinese media boycott of NBA preseason games in the country. James said he believed Morey was “misinformed” about the situation, though he later tweeted that he mainly took issue with the executive posting comments that could have exposed traveling players to danger. The basketball superstar has also shown a playful side on social media, such as when he posted a picture of cartoon character Arthur clenching his first during the Cavaliers’ slow start to the 2017-18 season. Like many pro athletes before him, James parlayed his popularity into opportunities on the big and small screen. On television, James has had guest roles on the popular cartoons The Simpsons (2005), SpongeBob SquarePants (2009), and The Cleveland Show (2011), and appeared as himself on the HBO drama Entourage in 2009. James made his major movie with a supporting role in 2015’s Trainwreck, a comedy starring Amy Schumer and Bill Hader. He later starred in Space Jam 2, the 2021 sequel to the hit 1996 live-action and cartoon hybrid starring Michael Jordan. “The Space Jam collaboration is so much more than just me and the Looney Tunes getting together and doing this movie,” James told The Hollywood Reporter. “It’s so much bigger. I’d just love for kids to understand how empowered they can feel and how empowered they can be if they don’t just give up on their dreams.” In 2020, the basketball great co-founded a production company called SpringHill Entertainment.

                "content": "Manchester United Football Club, commonly referred to as Man United (often stylised as Man Utd) or simply United, is a professional football club based in Old Trafford, Greater Manchester, England. They compete in the Premier League, the top tier of English football. Nicknamed the Red Devils, they were founded as Newton Heath LYR Football Club in 1878, but changed their name to Manchester United in 1902. After a spell playing in Clayton, Manchester, the club moved to their current stadium, Old Trafford, in 1910. Domestically, Manchester United have won a record 20 top-flight league titles, 13 FA Cups, 6 League Cups and a record 21 FA Community Shields. Additionally, in international football, they have won the European Cup/UEFA Champions League three times, and the UEFA Europa League, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, the UEFA Super Cup, the Intercontinental Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup once each.[7][8] Appointed as manager in 1945, Matt Busby built a team with an average age of just 22 nicknamed the Busby Babes that won successive league titles in the 1950s and became the first English club to compete in the European Cup. Eight players were killed in the Munich air disaster, but Busby rebuilt the team around star players George Best, Denis Law and Bobby Charlton – known as the United Trinity. They won two more league titles before becoming the first English club to win the European Cup in 1968. After Busby's retirement, Manchester United were unable to produce sustained success until the arrival of Alex Ferguson, who became the club's longest-serving and most successful manager, winning 38 trophies including 13 league titles, five FA Cups and two Champions League titles between 1986 and 2013.[9] In the 1998–99 season, under Ferguson, the club became the first in the history of English football to achieve the continental treble of the Premier League, FA Cup and UEFA Champions League.[10] In winning the UEFA Europa League under José Mourinho in 2016–17, they became one of five clubs to have won the original three main UEFA club competitions (the Champions League, Europa League and Cup Winners' Cup). Manchester United are one of the most widely supported football clubs in the world[11][12] and have rivalries with Liverpool, Manchester City, Arsenal and Leeds United. Manchester United were the highest-earning football club in the world for 2016–17, with an annual revenue of €676.3 million,[13] and the world's third-most-valuable football club in 2019, valued at £3.15 billion ($3.81 billion).[14] After being floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1991, the club was taken private in 2005 after a purchase by American businessman Malcolm Glazer valued at almost £800 million, of which over £500 million of borrowed money became the club's debt.[15] From 2012, some shares of the club were listed on the New York Stock Exchange, although the Glazer family retains overall ownership and control of the club. Manchester United were formed in 1878 as Newton Heath LYR Football Club by the Carriage and Wagon department of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (LYR) depot at Newton Heath.[16] The team initially played games against other departments and railway companies, but on 20 November 1880, they competed in their first recorded match; wearing the colours of the railway company – green and gold – they were defeated 6–0 by Bolton Wanderers' reserve team.[17] By 1888, the club had become a founding member of The Combination, a regional football league. Following the league's dissolution after only one season, Newton Heath joined the newly formed Football Alliance, which ran for three seasons before being merged with The Football League. This resulted in the club starting the 1892–93 season in the First Division, by which time it had become independent of the railway company and dropped the \"LYR\" from its name.[16] After two seasons, the club was relegated to the Second Division.[16] In January 1902, with debts of £2,670 – equivalent to £370,000 in 2024[nb 1] – the club was served with a winding-up order.[18] Captain Harry Stafford found four local businessmen, including John Henry Davies (who became club president), each willing to invest £500 in return for a direct interest in running the club and who subsequently changed the name;[19] on 24 April 1902, Manchester United was officially born.[20][nb 2] Under Ernest Mangnall, who assumed managerial duties in 1903, Manchester United finished as Second Division runners-up in 1906 and secured promotion to the First Division, which they won in 1908 – the club's first league title. The following season began with victory in the first ever Charity Shield[21] and ended with the club's first FA Cup title. Mangnall was considered a significant influence behind the team's move to Old Trafford in 1910, and Manchester United won the First Division for the second time in 1911.[22] At the end of the following season, however, Mangnall left the club to join Manchester City.[23] In 1922, three years after the resumption of football following the First World War, the club was relegated to the Second Division, where it remained until regaining promotion in 1925. Relegated again in 1931, Manchester United became a yo-yo club, achieving its all-time lowest position of 20th place in the Second Division in 1934, under secretary-manager Scott Duncan, narrowly avoiding relegation to the Third Division. Two years later, Duncan led the club to promotion before another relegation followed in 1937, which led to his resignation in November of that year. Following the death of principal benefactor John Henry Davies in October 1927, the club's finances deteriorated to the extent that Manchester United would likely have gone bankrupt had it not been for James W. Gibson, who, in December 1931, invested £2,000 and assumed control of the club.[24] In the 1938–39 season, the last year of football before the Second World War, the club finished 14th in the First Division.[24] In October 1945, the impending resumption of football after the war led to the managerial appointment of Matt Busby, who demanded an unprecedented level of control over team selection, player transfers and training sessions.[25] Busby led the team to second-place league finishes in 1947, 1948 and 1949, and to FA Cup victory in 1948. In 1952, the club won the First Division, its first league title for 41 years.[26] They then won back-to-back league titles in 1956 and 1957; the squad, who had an average age of 22, were nicknamed \"the Busby Babes\" by the media, a testament to Busby's faith in his youth players.[27] In 1957, Manchester United became the first English team to compete in the European Cup, despite objections from The Football League, who had denied Chelsea the same opportunity the previous season.[28] En route to the semi-final, which they lost to Real Madrid, the team recorded a 10–0 victory over Belgian champions Anderlecht, which remains the club's biggest victory on record.[29] The following season, on the way home from a European Cup quarter-final victory against Red Star Belgrade, the aircraft carrying the Manchester United players, officials and journalists crashed while attempting to take off after refuelling in Munich, Germany. The Munich air disaster of 6 February 1958 claimed 23 lives, including those of eight players – Geoff Bent, Roger Byrne, Eddie Colman, Duncan Edwards, Mark Jones, David Pegg, Tommy Taylor and Billy Whelan – and injured several more.[30][31] Assistant manager Jimmy Murphy took over as manager while Busby recovered from his injuries and the club's makeshift side reached the FA Cup final, which they lost to Bolton Wanderers. In recognition of the team's tragedy, UEFA invited the club to compete in the 1958–59 European Cup alongside eventual League champions Wolverhampton Wanderers. Despite approval from The Football Association, The Football League determined that the club should not enter the competition, since it had not qualified.[32][33] Busby rebuilt the team through the 1960s by signing players such as Denis Law and Pat Crerand, who combined with the next generation of youth players – including George Best – to win the FA Cup in 1963. Busby rested several key players for the League game before the Cup Final which gave Dennis Walker the chance to make his debut against Nottingham Forest on 20 May. Walker thus became the first Black player to represent United.[34] The following season, they finished second in the league, then won the title in 1965 and 1967. In 1968, Manchester United became the first English club to win the European Cup, beating Benfica 4–1 in the final[35] with a team that contained three European Footballers of the Year: Bobby Charlton, Denis Law and George Best.[36] They then represented Europe in the 1968 Intercontinental Cup against Estudiantes of Argentina, but defeat in the first leg in Buenos Aires meant a 1–1 draw at Old Trafford three weeks later was not enough to claim the title. Busby resigned as manager in 1969 before being replaced by the reserve team coach, former Manchester United player Wilf McGuinness.[37] Following an eighth-place finish in the 1969–70 season and a poor start to the 1970–71 season, Busby was persuaded to temporarily resume managerial duties, and McGuinness returned to his position as reserve team coach. In June 1971, Frank O'Farrell was appointed as manager, but lasted less than 18 months before being replaced by Tommy Docherty in December 1972.[39] Docherty saved Manchester United from relegation that season, only to see them relegated in 1974; by that time the trio of Best, Law, and Charlton had left the club.[35] The team won promotion at the first attempt and reached the FA Cup final in 1976, but were beaten by Southampton. They reached the final again in 1977, beating Liverpool 2–1. Docherty was dismissed shortly afterwards, following the revelation of his affair with the club physiotherapist's wife.[37][40] Dave Sexton replaced Docherty as manager in the summer of 1977. Despite major signings, including Joe Jordan, Gordon McQueen, Gary Bailey, and Ray Wilkins, the team failed to win any trophies; they finished second in 1979–80 and lost to Arsenal in the 1979 FA Cup final. Sexton was dismissed in 1981, even though the team won the last seven games under his direction.[41] He was replaced by Ron Atkinson, who immediately broke the British record transfer fee to sign Bryan Robson from his former club West Bromwich Albion. Under Atkinson, Manchester United won the FA Cup in 1983 and 1985 and beat rivals Liverpool to win the 1983 Charity Shield. In 1985–86, after 13 wins and two draws in its first 15 matches, the club was favourite to win the league but finished in fourth place. The following season, with the club in danger of relegation by November, Atkinson was dismissed.[42] Alex Ferguson and his assistant Archie Knox arrived from Aberdeen on the day of Atkinson's dismissal,[43] and guided the club to an 11th-place finish in the league.[44] Despite a second-place finish in 1987–88, the club was back in 11th place the following season.[45] Reportedly on the verge of being dismissed, Ferguson's job was saved by victory over Crystal Palace in the 1990 FA Cup final.[46][47] The following season, Manchester United claimed their first UEFA Cup Winners' Cup title. That triumph allowed the club to compete in the European Super Cup for the first time, where United beat European Cup holders Red Star Belgrade 1–0 at Old Trafford. The club appeared in two consecutive League Cup finals in 1991 and 1992, beating Nottingham Forest 1–0 in the second to win that competition for the first time as well.[42] In 1993, in the first season of the newly founded Premier League, the club won their first league title since 1967, and a year later, for the first time since 1957, they won a second consecutive title – alongside the FA Cup – to complete the first \"Double\" in the club's history.[42] United then became the first English club to do the Double twice when they won both competitions again in 1995–96,[48] before retaining the league title once more in 1996–97 with a game to spare.[49] In the 1998–99 season, Manchester United became the first team to win the Premier League, FA Cup and UEFA Champions League – \"The Treble\" – in the same season.[50] Trailing 1–0 going into injury time in the 1999 UEFA Champions League final, Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar Solskjær scored late goals to claim a dramatic victory over Bayern Munich, in what is considered one of the greatest comebacks of all time.[51] That summer, Ferguson received a knighthood for his services to football.[52] In November 1999, the club became the only British team to ever win the Intercontinental Cup with a 1–0 victory over the strong 1999 Copa Libertadores winners Palmeiras in Tokyo. The Red Devils counted on an unexpected goalkeeper fail by future 2002 FIFA World Cup winner Marcos and a disallowed goal scored by Alex to win the game.[53] Manchester United won the league again in the 1999–2000 and 2000–01 seasons, becoming only the fourth club to win the English title three times in a row. The team finished third in 2001–02, before regaining the title in 2002–03.[55] They won the 2003–04 FA Cup, beating Millwall 3–0 in the final at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff to lift the trophy for a record 11th time.[56] In the 2005–06 season, Manchester United failed to qualify for the knockout phase of the UEFA Champions League for the first time in over a decade,[57] but recovered to secure a second-place league finish and victory over Wigan Athletic in the 2006 Football League Cup final. The club regained the Premier League title in the 2006–07 season, before completing the European double in 2007–08 with a 6–5 penalty shoot-out victory over Chelsea in the 2008 UEFA Champions League final in Moscow to go with their 17th English league title. Ryan Giggs made a record 759th appearance for the club in that game, overtaking previous record holder Bobby Charlton.[58] In December 2008, the club became the first British team to win the FIFA Club World Cup after beating LDU Quito 1–0 in the final. Manchester United followed this with the 2008–09 Football League Cup, and its third successive Premier League title.[59][60] That summer, forward Cristiano Ronaldo was sold to Real Madrid for a world record £80 million.[61] In 2010, Manchester United defeated Aston Villa 2–1 at Wembley to retain the League Cup, its first successful defence of a knockout cup competition.[62] After finishing as runners-up to Chelsea in the 2009–10 season, United achieved a record 19th league title in 2010–11, securing the championship with a 1–1 away draw against Blackburn Rovers on 14 May 2011.[63] This was extended to 20 league titles in 2012–13, securing the championship with a 3–0 home win against Aston Villa on 22 April 2013.[64] On 8 May 2013, Ferguson announced that he was to retire as manager at the end of the football season, but would remain at the club as a director and club ambassador.[65][66] He retired as the most decorated manager in football history.[67][68] The club announced the next day that Everton manager David Moyes would replace him from 1 July, having signed a six-year contract.[69][70][71] Ryan Giggs took over as interim player-manager 10 months later, on 22 April 2014, when Moyes was sacked after a poor season in which the club failed to defend their Premier League title and failed to qualify for the UEFA Champions League for the first time since 1995–96.[72] They also failed to qualify for the UEFA Europa League, the first time Manchester United had not qualified for a European competition since 1990.[73] On 19 May 2014, it was confirmed that Louis van Gaal would replace Moyes as Manchester United manager on a three-year deal, with Giggs as his assistant.[74] Malcolm Glazer, the patriarch of the family that owns the club, died on 28 May 2014.[75] Under Van Gaal, United won a 12th FA Cup, but a disappointing slump in the middle of his second season led to rumours of the board sounding out potential replacements.[76] Van Gaal was ultimately sacked just two days after the cup final victory, with United having finished fifth in the league.[77] Former Porto, Chelsea, Inter Milan and Real Madrid manager José Mourinho was appointed in his place on 27 May 2016.[78] Mourinho signed a three-year contract, and in his first season won the FA Community Shield, EFL Cup and UEFA Europa League. Wayne Rooney scored his 250th goal for United, a stoppage-time equaliser in a league game against Stoke City in January 2017, surpassing Sir Bobby Charlton as the club's all-time top scorer.[79] The following season, United finished second in the league – their highest league placing since 2013 – but were still 19 points behind rivals Manchester City. Mourinho also guided the club to a 19th FA Cup final, but they lost 1–0 to Chelsea. On 18 December 2018, with United in sixth place in the Premier League table, 19 points behind leaders Liverpool and 11 points outside the Champions League places, Mourinho was sacked after 144 games in charge. The following day, former United striker Ole Gunnar Solskjær was appointed as caretaker manager until the end of the season.[80] On 28 March 2019, after winning 14 of his first 19 matches in charge, Solskjær was appointed permanent manager on a three-year deal.[81] On 18 April 2021, Manchester United announced they were joining 11 other European clubs as founding members of the European Super League, a proposed 20-team competition intended to rival the UEFA Champions League.[82] The announcement drew a significant backlash from supporters, other clubs, media partners, sponsors, players and the UK Government, forcing the club to withdraw just two days later.[83][84][85][86][87] The failure of the project led to the resignation of executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward, while resultant protests against Woodward and the Glazer family led to a pitch invasion ahead of a league match against Liverpool on 2 May 2021, which saw the first postponement of a Premier League game due to supporter protests in the competition's history.[88][89] On the pitch, United equalled their own record for the biggest win in Premier League history with a 9–0 win over Southampton on 2 February 2021,[90] but ended the season with defeat on penalties in the UEFA Europa League final against Villarreal, going four straight seasons without a trophy.[91] On 20 November 2021, Solskjær left his role as manager.[92] Former midfielder Michael Carrick took charge for the next three games, before the appointment of Ralf Rangnick as interim manager until the end of the season.[93] On 21 April 2022, Erik ten Hag was appointed as the manager from the end of the 2021–22 season, signing a contract until June 2025 with the option of extending for a further year.[94] Under Ten Hag, Manchester United won the 2022–23 EFL Cup, defeating Newcastle United in the final to end their longest period without a trophy since a six-year span between 1977 and 1983.[95][96] On 5 March 2023, the club suffered their joint-heaviest defeat, losing 7–0 to rivals Liverpool at Anfield.[97] At the end of the following season, the club finished eighth in the Premier League, their lowest league finish since the 1989–90 season, but went on to beat cross-city rivals Manchester City 2–1 in the FA Cup final, to win their 13th FA Cup title.[98] On 28 October 2024, Manchester United sacked Erik ten Hag after the club managed just three wins in the opening nine games of the Premier League season.[99] On 1 November 2024, Manchester United announced that they would be appointing Sporting CP boss Ruben Amorim as their new head coach from 11 November 2024.[100] The club crest is derived from the Manchester City Council coat of arms, although all that remains of it on the current crest is the ship in full sail.[101] The devil stems from the club's nickname \"The Red Devils\" inspired from Salford Rugby Club;[102][103] it was included on club programmes and scarves in the 1960s, and incorporated into the club crest in 1970, although the crest was not included on the chest of the shirt until 1971.[101] In 1975, the red devil (\"A devil facing the sinister guardant supporting with both hands a trident gules\") was granted as a heraldic badge by the College of Arms to the English Football League for use by Manchester United.[104] In 2023, the Red Devil motif alone, which had been used in promotional items and merchandise previously, was used as the sole badge on the Manchester United third kit. The existing crest remains on the home and away kits. Newton Heath's uniform in 1879, four years before the club played its first competitive match, has been documented as 'white with blue cord'.[105] A photograph of the Newton Heath team, taken in 1892, is believed to show the players wearing red-and-white quartered jerseys and navy blue knickerbockers.[106] Between 1894 and 1896, the players wore green and gold jerseys[106] which were replaced in 1896 by white shirts, which were worn with navy blue shorts.[106] After the name change in 1902, the club colours were changed to red shirts, white shorts, and black socks, which has become the standard Manchester United home kit.[106] Very few changes were made to the kit until 1922 when the club adopted white shirts bearing a deep red \"V\" around the neck, similar to the shirt worn in the 1909 FA Cup final. They remained part of their home kits until 1927.[106] For a period in 1934, the cherry and white hooped change shirt became the home colours, but the following season the red shirt was recalled after the club's lowest ever league placing of 20th in the Second Division and the hooped shirt dropped back to being the change.[106] The black socks were changed to white from 1959 to 1965, where they were replaced with red socks up until 1971 with white used on occasion, when the club reverted to black. Black shorts and white socks are sometimes worn with the home strip, most often in away games, if there is a clash with the opponent's kit. For 2018–19, black shorts and red socks became the primary choice for the home kit.[107] Since 1997–98, white socks have been the preferred choice for European games, which are typically played on weeknights, to aid with player visibility.[108] The current home kit is a red shirt with Adidas' trademark three stripes in red on the shoulders, white shorts, and black socks.[109] The Manchester United away strip has often been a white shirt, black shorts and white socks, but there have been several exceptions. These include an all-black strip with blue and gold trimmings between 1993 and 1995, the navy blue shirt with silver horizontal pinstripes worn during the 1999–2000 season,[110] and the 2011–12 away kit, which had a royal blue body and sleeves with hoops made of small midnight navy blue and black stripes, with black shorts and blue socks.[111] An all-grey away kit worn during the 1995–96 season was dropped after just five games; in its final outing against Southampton, Alex Ferguson instructed the team to change into the third kit during half-time. The reason for dropping it being that the players claimed to have trouble finding their teammates against the crowd, United failed to win a competitive game in the kit in five attempts.[112] In 2001, to celebrate 100 years as \"Manchester United\", a reversible white and gold away kit was released, although the actual match day shirts were not reversible.[113] The club's third kit is often all-blue; this was most recently the case during the 2014–15 season.[114] Exceptions include a green-and-gold halved shirt worn between 1992 and 1994, a blue-and-white striped shirt worn during the 1994–95 and 1995–96 seasons and once in 1996–97, an all-black kit worn during the Treble-winning 1998–99 season, and a white shirt with black-and-red horizontal pinstripes worn between 2003–04 and 2005–06.[115] From 2006–07 to 2013–14, the third kit was the previous season's away kit, albeit updated with the new club sponsor in 2006–07 and 2010–11, apart from the 2008–09 season, when an all-blue kit was launched to mark the 40th anniversary of the 1967–68 European Cup success.[116] Newton Heath initially played on a field on North Road, close to the railway yard; the original capacity was about 12,000, but club officials deemed the facilities inadequate for a club hoping to join The Football League.[117] Some expansion took place in 1887, and in 1891, Newton Heath used its minimal financial reserves to purchase two grandstands, each able to hold 1,000 spectators.[118] Although attendances were not recorded for many of the earliest matches at North Road, the highest documented attendance was approximately 15,000 for a First Division match against Sunderland on 4 March 1893.[119] A similar attendance was also recorded for a friendly match against Gorton Villa on 5 September 1889.[120] In June 1893, after the club was evicted from North Road by its owners, Manchester Deans and Canons, who felt it was inappropriate for the club to charge an entry fee to the ground, secretary A. H. Albut procured the use of the Bank Street ground in Clayton.[121] It initially had no stands, by the start of the 1893–94 season, two had been built; one spanning the full length of the pitch on one side and the other behind the goal at the \"Bradford end\". At the opposite end, the \"Clayton end\", the ground had been \"built up, thousands thus being provided for\".[121] Newton Heath's first league match at Bank Street was played against Burnley on 1 September 1893, when 10,000 people saw Alf Farman score a hat-trick, Newton Heath's only goals in a 3–2 win. The remaining stands were completed for the following league game against Nottingham Forest three weeks later.[121] In October 1895, before the visit of Manchester City, the club purchased a 2,000-capacity stand from the Broughton Rangers rugby league club, and put up another stand on the \"reserved side\" (as distinct from the \"popular side\"); however, weather restricted the attendance for the Manchester City match to just 12,000.[122] When the Bank Street ground was temporarily closed by bailiffs in 1902, club captain Harry Stafford raised enough money to pay for the club's next away game at Bristol City and found a temporary ground at Harpurhey for the next reserves game against Padiham.[123] Following financial investment, new club president John Henry Davies paid £500 for the erection of a new 1,000-seat stand at Bank Street.[124] Within four years, the stadium had cover on all four sides, as well as the ability to hold approximately 50,000 spectators, some of whom could watch from the viewing gallery atop the Main Stand.[124] Following Manchester United's first league title in 1908 and the FA Cup a year later, it was decided that Bank Street was too restrictive for Davies' ambition;[124] in February 1909, six weeks before the club's first FA Cup title, Old Trafford was named as the home of Manchester United, following the purchase of land for around £60,000. Architect Archibald Leitch was given a budget of £30,000 for construction; original plans called for seating capacity of 100,000, though budget constraints forced a revision to 77,000.[125][126] The building was constructed by Messrs Brameld and Smith of Manchester. The stadium's record attendance was registered on 25 March 1939, when an FA Cup semi-final between Wolverhampton Wanderers and Grimsby Town drew 76,962 spectators.[127] Bombing in the Second World War destroyed much of the stadium; the central tunnel in the South Stand was all that remained of that quarter. After the war, the club received compensation from the War Damage Commission in the amount of £22,278. While reconstruction took place, the team played its \"home\" games at Manchester City's Maine Road ground; Manchester United was charged £5,000 per year, plus a nominal percentage of gate receipts.[128] Later improvements included the addition of roofs, first to the Stretford End and then to the North and East Stands. The roofs were supported by pillars that obstructed many fans' views, and they were eventually replaced with a cantilevered structure. The Stretford End was the last stand to receive a cantilevered roof, completed in time for the 1993–94 season.[37] First used on 25 March 1957 and costing £40,000, four 180-foot (55 m) pylons were erected, each housing 54 individual floodlights. These were dismantled in 1987 and replaced by a lighting system embedded in the roof of each stand, which remains in use today.[129] The Taylor Report's requirement for an all-seater stadium lowered capacity at Old Trafford to around 44,000 by 1993. In 1995, the North Stand was redeveloped into three tiers, restoring capacity to approximately 55,000. At the end of the 1998–99 season, second tiers were added to the East and West Stands, raising capacity to around 67,000, and between July 2005 and May 2006, 8,000 more seats were added via second tiers in the north-west and north-east quadrants. Part of the new seating was used for the first time on 26 March 2006, when an attendance of 69,070 became a new Premier League record.[130] The record was pushed steadily upwards before reaching its peak on 31 March 2007, when 76,098 spectators saw Manchester United beat Blackburn Rovers 4–1, with just 114 seats (0.15 per cent of the total capacity of 76,212) unoccupied.[131] In 2009, reorganisation of the seating resulted in a reduction of capacity by 255 to 75,957.[132][133] Manchester United has the second highest average attendance among European football clubs, behind only Borussia Dortmund.[134][135][136] In 2021, United co-chairman Joel Glazer said that \"early-stage planning work\" for the redevelopment of Old Trafford was underway. This followed \"increasing criticism\" over the lack of development of the ground since 2006.[137] After the club's takeover by Sir Jim Ratcliffe in 2024, it emerged that plans were being made for the construction of a new, 100,000-capacity stadium near Old Trafford and that the current stadium would be downsized to serve as the home for the women's team and the club's academy.[138] In November 2024, it was revealed that the majority of fans surveyed are in favour of a new-build rather than redevelopment.[139] Manchester United is one of the most popular football clubs in the world, with one of the highest average home attendances in Europe.[140] The club states that its worldwide fan base includes more than 200 officially recognised branches of the Manchester United Supporters Club (MUSC), in at least 24 countries.[141] The club takes advantage of this support through its worldwide summer tours. Accountancy firm and sports industry consultants Deloitte estimate that Manchester United has 75 million fans worldwide.[11] The club has the third highest social media following in the world among sports teams (after Barcelona and Real Madrid), with over 82 million Facebook followers as of July 2023.[12][142] A 2014 study showed that Manchester United had the loudest fans in the Premier League.[143] Supporters are represented by two independent bodies; the Independent Manchester United Supporters' Association (IMUSA), which maintains close links to the club through the MUFC Fans Forum,[144] and the Manchester United Supporters' Trust (MUST). After the Glazer family's takeover in 2005, a group of fans formed a splinter club, F.C. United of Manchester. The West Stand of Old Trafford – the \"Stretford End\" – is the home end and the traditional source of the club's most vocal support.[145] Manchester United has high-profile rivalries with Liverpool and local neighbours Manchester City. The club has also had rivalries throughout its history with the likes of Arsenal, Leeds United and Chelsea.[146][147] The matches against Manchester City are known as the Manchester derby, as they are the two most important teams in the city of Manchester. It is considered one of the biggest local derbies in British football,[148] particularly after City's rise to prominence in the 2010s and the two clubs fighting for trophies, such as the league title in 2012 and 2013, as well as two consecutive FA Cup finals in 2023 and 2024.[149] The rivalry with Liverpool is rooted in competition between the cities during the Industrial Revolution, when Manchester was famous for its textile industry while Liverpool was a major port.[150] The two clubs are the most successful in the history of English football; between them they have won 39 league titles, 9 European Cups, 21 FA Cups, 16 League Cups, 4 UEFA Cup/Europa Leagues, 2 FIFA Club World Cups, 1 Intercontinental Cup, 37 FA Community Shields and 5 UEFA Super Cups.[7][151][152] Ranked the two biggest clubs in England by France Football magazine based on metrics such as fanbase and historical importance,[153] matches between Manchester United and Liverpool are considered to be the most famous fixture in English football and one of the biggest rivalries in the football world.[154][155][156][157] No player has been transferred between the clubs since 1964.[158] Former Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson said in 2002, \"My greatest challenge was knocking Liverpool right off their fucking perch\".[159] The \"Roses Rivalry\" with Leeds stems from the Wars of the Roses, fought between the House of Lancaster and the House of York, with Manchester United representing Lancashire and Leeds representing Yorkshire.[160] The rivalry with Arsenal arose from the numerous times the two teams battled for the Premier League title, especially under managers Alex Ferguson and Arsène Wenger, who also had a heated personal rivalry.[161] With 33 titles between them (20 for Manchester United, 13 for Arsenal), the fixture has been described as a \"blockbuster\" and the \"greatest\" rivalry in the history of the Premier League.[162][163] Manchester United has been described as a global brand; a 2011 report by Brand Finance, valued the club's trademarks and associated intellectual property at £412 million – an increase of £39 million on the previous year, valuing it at £11 million more than the second best brand, Real Madrid – and gave the brand a strength rating of AAA (Extremely Strong).[164] In July 2012, Manchester United was ranked first by Forbes magazine in its list of the ten most valuable sports team brands, valuing the Manchester United brand at $2.23 billion.[165] The club is ranked third in the Deloitte Football Money League (behind Real Madrid and Barcelona).[166] In January 2013, the club became the first sports team in the world to be valued at $3 billion.[167] Forbes magazine valued the club at $3.3 billion – $1.2 billion higher than the next most valuable sports team.[167] They were overtaken by Real Madrid for the next four years, but Manchester United returned to the top of the Forbes list in June 2017, with a valuation of $3.689 billion.[168] The core strength of Manchester United's global brand is often attributed to Matt Busby's rebuilding of the team and subsequent success following the Munich air disaster, which drew worldwide acclaim.[145] The \"iconic\" team included Bobby Charlton and Nobby Stiles (members of England's World Cup winning team), Denis Law and George Best. The attacking style of play adopted by this team (in contrast to the defensive-minded \"catenaccio\" approach favoured by the leading Italian teams of the era) \"captured the imagination of the English footballing public\".[169] Busby's team also became associated with the liberalisation of Western society during the 1960s; George Best, known as the \"Fifth Beatle\" for his iconic haircut, was the first footballer to significantly develop an off-the-field media profile.[169] As the second English football club to float on the London Stock Exchange in 1991, the club raised significant capital, with which it further developed its commercial strategy. The club's focus on commercial and sporting success brought significant profits in an industry often characterised by chronic losses.[170] The strength of the Manchester United brand was bolstered by intense off-the-field media attention to individual players, most notably David Beckham (who quickly developed his own global brand). This attention often generates greater interest in on-the-field activities, and hence generates sponsorship opportunities – the value of which is driven by television exposure.[171] During his time with the club, Beckham's popularity across Asia was integral to the club's commercial success in that part of the world.[172] Because higher league placement results in a greater share of television rights, success on the field generates greater income for the club. Since the inception of the Premier League, Manchester United has received the largest share of the revenue generated from the BSkyB broadcasting deal.[173] Manchester United has also consistently enjoyed the highest commercial income of any English club; in 2005–06, the club's commercial arm generated £51 million, compared to £42.5 million at Chelsea, £39.3 million at Liverpool, £34 million at Arsenal and £27.9 million at Newcastle United. A key sponsorship relationship was with sportswear company Nike, who managed the club's merchandising operation as part of a £303 million 13-year partnership between 2002 and 2015.[174] Through Manchester United Finance and the club's membership scheme, One United, those with an affinity for the club can purchase a range of branded goods and services. Additionally, Manchester United-branded media services – such as the club's dedicated television channel, MUTV – have allowed the club to expand its fan base to those beyond the reach of its Old Trafford stadium.[11] In an initial five-year deal worth £500,000, Sharp Electronics became the club's first shirt sponsor at the beginning of the 1982–83 season, a relationship that lasted until the end of the 1999–2000 season, when Vodafone agreed a four-year, £30 million deal.[176] Vodafone agreed to pay £36 million to extend the deal by four years, but after two seasons triggered a break clause in order to concentrate on its sponsorship of the Champions League.[176] To commence at the start of the 2006–07 season, American insurance corporation AIG agreed a four-year £56.5 million deal which in September 2006 became the most valuable in the world.[177][178] At the beginning of the 2010–11 season, American reinsurance company Aon became the club's principal sponsor in a four-year deal reputed to be worth approximately £80 million, making it the most lucrative shirt sponsorship deal in football history.[179] Manchester United announced their first training kit sponsor in August 2011, agreeing a four-year deal with DHL reported to be worth £40 million; it is believed to be the first instance of training kit sponsorship in English football.[180][181] The DHL contract lasted for over a year before the club bought back the contract in October 2012, although they remained the club's official logistics partner.[182] The contract for the training kit sponsorship was then sold to Aon in April 2013 for a deal worth £180 million over eight years, which also included purchasing the naming rights for the Trafford Training Centre.[183] The club's first kit manufacturer was Umbro, until a five-year deal was agreed with Admiral Sportswear in 1975.[184] Adidas won the contract in 1980,[185] before Umbro started a second spell in 1992.[186] That sponsorship lasted for ten years, followed by Nike's record-breaking £302.9 million deal, which lasted until 2015; 3.8 million replica shirts were sold in the first 22 months with the company.[187][188] In addition to Nike and Chevrolet, the club also has several lower-level \"platinum\" sponsors, including Aon and Budweiser.[189] On 30 July 2012, United signed a seven-year deal with American automotive corporation General Motors, which replaced Aon as the shirt sponsor from the 2014–15 season. The new $80m-a-year shirt deal is worth $559m over seven years and features the logo of General Motors brand Chevrolet.[190][191] Nike announced that they would not renew their kit supply deal with Manchester United after the 2014–15 season, citing rising costs.[192][193] Since the start of the 2015–16 season, Adidas has manufactured Manchester United's kit as part of a world-record 10-year deal worth a minimum of £750 million.[194][195] Plumbing products manufacturer Kohler became the club's first sleeve sponsor ahead of the 2018–19 season.[196] Manchester United and General Motors did not renew their sponsorship deal, and the club subsequently signed a five-year, £235 million sponsorship deal with TeamViewer ahead of the 2021–22 season.[197] At the end of the 2023–24 season, TeamViewer were replaced by Snapdragon, who agreed a deal worth more than £60 million a year to take over as the club's main sponsor.[198] In August 2024, Snapdragon's parent company Qualcomm triggered an option to extend the deal by two years, taking it through to 2029.[199] Originally funded by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company, the club became a limited company in 1892 and sold shares to local supporters for £1 via an application form.[19] In 1902, majority ownership passed to the four local businessmen who invested £500 to save the club from bankruptcy, including future club president John Henry Davies.[19] After his death in 1927, the club faced bankruptcy yet again, but was saved in December 1931 by James W. Gibson, who assumed control of the club after an investment of £2,000.[24] Gibson promoted his son, Alan, to the board in 1948,[200] but died three years later; the Gibson family retained ownership of the club through James' wife, Lillian,[201] but the position of chairman passed to former player Harold Hardman.[202] Promoted to the board a few days after the Munich air disaster, Louis Edwards, a friend of Matt Busby, began acquiring shares in the club; for an investment of approximately £40,000, he accumulated a 54 per cent shareholding and took control in January 1964.[203] When Lillian Gibson died in January 1971, her shares passed to Alan Gibson who sold a percentage of his shares to Louis Edwards' son, Martin, in 1978; Martin Edwards went on to become chairman upon his father's death in 1980.[204] Media tycoon Robert Maxwell attempted to buy the club in 1984, but did not meet Edwards' asking price.[204] In 1989, chairman Martin Edwards attempted to sell the club to Michael Knighton for £20 million, but the sale fell through and Knighton joined the board of directors instead.[204] Manchester United was floated on the stock market in June 1991 (raising £6.7 million),[205] and received yet another takeover bid in 1998, this time from Rupert Murdoch's British Sky Broadcasting Corporation. This resulted in the formation of Shareholders United Against Murdoch – now the Manchester United Supporters' Trust – who encouraged supporters to buy shares in the club in an attempt to block any hostile takeover. The Manchester United board accepted a £623 million offer,[206] but the takeover was blocked by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission at the final hurdle in April 1999.[207] A few years later, a power struggle emerged between the club's manager, Alex Ferguson, and his horse-racing partners, John Magnier and J. P. McManus, who had gradually become the majority shareholders. In a dispute that stemmed from contested ownership of the horse Rock of Gibraltar, Magnier and McManus attempted to have Ferguson removed from his position as manager, and the board responded by approaching investors to attempt to reduce the Irishmen's majority.[208] In May 2005, Malcolm Glazer purchased the 28.7 per cent stake held by McManus and Magnier, thus acquiring a controlling interest through his investment vehicle Red Football Ltd in a highly leveraged takeover valuing the club at approximately £800 million (then approx. $1.5 billion).[209] Once the purchase was complete, the club was taken off the stock exchange.[210] Much of the takeover money was borrowed by the Glazers; the debts were transferred to the club. As a result, the club went from being debt-free to being saddled with debts of £540 million, at interest rates of between 7% and 20%.[15][211][212] In July 2006, the club announced a £660 million debt refinancing package, resulting in a 30 per cent reduction in annual interest payments to £62 million a year.[213][214] In January 2010, with debts of £716.5 million ($1.17 billion),[215] Manchester United further refinanced through a bond issue worth £504 million, enabling them to pay off most of the £509 million owed to international banks.[216] The annual interest payable on the bonds – which were to mature on 1 February 2017 – is approximately £45 million per annum.[217] Despite restructuring, the club's debt prompted protests from fans on 23 January 2010, at Old Trafford and the club's Trafford Training Centre.[218][219] Supporter groups encouraged match-going fans to wear green and gold, the colours of Newton Heath. On 30 January, reports emerged that the Manchester United Supporters' Trust had held meetings with a group of wealthy fans, dubbed the \"Red Knights\", with plans to buying out the Glazers' controlling interest.[220] The club's debts reached a high of £777 million in June 2007.[221] In August 2011, the Glazers were believed to have approached Credit Suisse in preparation for a $1 billion (approx. £600 million) initial public offering (IPO) on the Singapore stock exchange that would value the club at more than £2 billion;[222] however, in July 2012, the club announced plans to list its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange instead.[223] Shares were originally set to go on sale for between $16 and $20 each, but the price was cut to $14 by the launch of the IPO on 10 August, following negative comments from Wall Street analysts and Facebook's disappointing stock market debut in May. Even after the cut, Manchester United was valued at $2.3 billion, making it the most valuable football club in the world.[224] The New York Stock Exchange allows for different shareholders to enjoy different voting rights over the club. Shares offered to the public (\"Class A\") had 10 times lesser voting rights than shares retained by the Glazers (\"Class B\").[225] Initially in 2012, only 10% of shares were offered to the public.[226] As of 2019, the Glazers retain ultimate control over the club, with over 70% of shares, and even higher voting power.[227] In 2012, The Guardian estimated that the club had paid a total of over £500 million in debt interest and other fees on behalf of the Glazers,[228] and in 2019, reported that the total sum paid by the club for such fees had risen to £1 billion.[212] At the end of 2019, the club had a net debt of nearly £400 million.[229] In 2023, the Glazers began soliciting bids for the sale of the club, and several bids were received. Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who owns Ineos, and Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani, a Qatari sheikh, were the only bidders who had publicly declared their interest in a controlling share of the club.[230] In March 2023, Finnish entrepreneur Thomas Zilliacus also made his interest in Manchester United public.[231] On 24 December 2023, it was announced that Ratcliffe had purchased 25 per cent of Manchester United, and that his Ineos Sport company was taking control of football operations.[232] The Glazers remain as majority shareholders.

Manchester United is one of the most successful clubs in Europe in terms of trophies won.[271] The club's first trophy was the Manchester Cup, which they won as Newton Heath LYR in 1886.[272] In 1908, the club won their first league title, and won the FA Cup for the first time the following year. Since then, they have gone on to win a record 20 top-division titles – including a record 13 Premier League titles – and their total of 13 FA Cups is second only to Arsenal (14). Those titles have meant the club has appeared a record 30 times in the FA Community Shield (formerly the FA Charity Shield), which is played at the start of each season between the winners of the league and FA Cup from the previous season; of those 30 appearances, Manchester United have won a record 21, including four times when the match was drawn and the trophy shared by the two clubs. The club had a successful period under the management of Matt Busby, starting with the FA Cup in 1948 and culminating with becoming the first English club to win the European Cup in 1968, winning five league titles and two FA Cups in the intervening years. The club's most successful decade, however, came in the 1990s under Alex Ferguson; five league titles, four FA Cups, one League Cup, five Charity Shields (one shared), one UEFA Champions League, one UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, one UEFA Super Cup and one Intercontinental Cup. The club has won the Double (winning the Premier League and FA Cup in the same season) three times; the second in 1995–96 saw them become the first club to do so twice, and it became referred to as the \"Double Double\".[273] United became the sole British club to win the Intercontinental Cup in 1999 and are one of only three British clubs to have won the FIFA Club World Cup, in 2008. In 1999, United became the first English club to win the Treble.[50] In 2017, United won the 2016–17 UEFA Europa League, beating Ajax in the final. In winning that title, United became the fifth club to have won the \"European Treble\" of European Cup/UEFA Champions League, Cup Winners' Cup, and UEFA Cup/Europa League after Juventus, Ajax, Bayern Munich and Chelsea.[274][275] The club's most recent trophy is the 2023–24 FA Cup.[276] Short competitions – such as the FA Charity/Community Shield, Intercontinental Cup (now defunct), FIFA Club World Cup or UEFA Super Cup – are not generally considered to contribute towards a Double or Treble.[277] Manchester United Supporters Club Ladies began operations in the late 1970s and was unofficially recognised as the club's senior women's team. They became founding members of the North West Women's Regional Football League in 1989.[278] The team made an official partnership with Manchester United in 2001, becoming the club's official women's team; however, in 2005, following Malcolm Glazer's takeover, the club was disbanded as it was seen to be \"unprofitable\".[279] In 2018, Manchester United formed a new women's football team, which entered the second division of women's football in England for their debut season. The women's football team won their first trophy on 12 May 2024 as they lifted the Women's FA Cup as they defeated Tottenham Hotspur 4–0.",

Manchester United, in full Manchester United Football Club, is an English professional football (soccer) team based in Manchester, England. It is one of the richest and best-supported football clubs not only in England but in the entire world. The club has won the English top-division league championship a record 20 times and the Football Association Cup 12 times. Manchester United was formed as Newton Heath LYR in 1878 by workers from the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway. It was renamed Manchester United in 1902. Manchester United (Man U) is nicknamed “the Red Devils” for its distinctive red jerseys. Manchester United was struck by tragedy in 1958 when an aircraft carrying the team crashed in Munich, Germany, killing 23 of the 44 people onboard. In 1968 Manchester United became the first English club to win the European Cup (now known as the Champions League) with a 4–1 victory over Benfica of Portugal in the final.

Nicknamed “the Red Devils” for its distinctive red jerseys, it is one of the richest and best-supported football clubs not only in England but in the entire world. The club has won the English top-division league championship a record 20 times and the Football Association (FA) Cup 12 times. The club was formed as Newton Heath LYR in 1878 by workers from the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway. Renamed Manchester United in 1902, the club won its first English league championship in 1907–08. In 1910 the club moved from its old Bank Street ground into Old Trafford stadium, which has served as the team’s home ever since. Manchester United’s history since World War II has been dominated by two long-serving managers. Sir Matthew Busby was appointed manager in 1945 and over the next 24 years steered the club to five English league and two FA Cup victories. The club had to contend with tragedy in 1958 when an aircraft carrying the team crashed in Munich, killing 23 of the 44 onboard. In the 1960s the team, rebuilt by Busby, included the highly talented attacking trio of Bobby Charlton, George Best, and Denis Law. In 1968 this team became the first English club to win the European Cup (now known as the Champions League) with a 4–1 victory over Benfica of Portugal in the final. The former coach of the Scottish team Aberdeen, Alex Ferguson, managed the club from 1986 to 2013 and presided over an unparalleled spell of dominance in the English league. Manchester United has won 12 Premier League titles since that league’s inaugural season in 1992–93. In the 1998–99 season the club secured the first “treble” in English football history by winning the Premier League, the FA Cup, and the Champions League. A second Champions League victory came in the 2007–08 season. Dramatically, the club lost another possible title on the last day of the 2011–12 season, when the other top Premier League team in the city, Manchester City FC, snatched the league title on point difference. The two Premier League clubs have elevated the city’s status worldwide. Manchester United is renowned for its youth team program, which has generated many notable homegrown players who later performed for the club’s first team, including David Beckham. The club has also brought in a number of major transfer signings over the years, such as Wayne Rooney, Rio Ferdinand, Andy Cole, Roy Keane, Eric Cantona, Patrice Evra, Dimitar Berbatov, and Cristiano Ronaldo.",

                "content": "Kari Lake Halperin[1][2] (née Lake; /ˈkɛəri/ KAIR-ee; born August 23, 1969)[3] is an American political figure and former television news anchor. She was the Republican Party's nominee in Arizona's 2022 gubernatorial and 2024 United States Senate elections. Beginning her media career in the early 1990s, Lake was the anchor for the Phoenix television station KSAZ-TV from 1999 to 2021.[4] She stepped down from her anchor role shortly before announcing her gubernatorial candidacy, winning the Republican nomination with the endorsement of former president Donald Trump.[5][6] Her campaign was marked by various controversies, including promoting false claims of Trump winning the 2020 presidential election and calling for the imprisonment of those who accepted Trump's defeat, including her Democratic opponent, Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs.[7][8][9] Lake narrowly lost the election to Hobbs in what was the closest gubernatorial race that year, but refused to concede. Lake's lawsuit challenging the gubernatorial election result lasted nearly two years and was rejected at three levels of Arizona state courts.[16] In October 2023, Lake announced her candidacy for the 2024 United States Senate election in Arizona. In July 2024, she won the Republican nomination but lost the general election to Ruben Gallego. On December 11, 2024, President-elect Trump announced that Lake would be appointed as the next director of Voice of America.[17][18] Kari Lake was born in 1969, in Rock Island, Illinois, to Larry and Sheila Lake, who were natives of the Wisconsin communities of Richland and Appleton. Larry taught social studies and was a basketball and football coach at North Scott High School, while Sheila was a nurse.[19][20][21][22] She is the youngest of nine children.[22] Lake grew up in Iowa.[23] She graduated from North Scott Senior High School in Eldridge, Iowa,[24][25] and then received a Bachelor of Arts in communications and journalism from the University of Iowa.[23] In May 1991, Lake began working as an intern at KWQC-TV in Davenport, Iowa, while attending the University of Iowa.[26] She later became production assistant before joining WHBF-TV in Rock Island to be a daily reporter and weekend weathercaster in 1992.[26] In August 1994, Lake was hired by KPNX in Phoenix, Arizona, to be the weekend weather anchor.[27] She later became evening anchor at KPNX before relocating to work for WNYT in Albany, New York in the summer of 1998 when she replaced Chris Kapostasy.[28][29][30] Lake returned to Arizona in 1999 and became an evening anchor for KSAZ-TV (Fox 10 Phoenix).[31][32] While at KSAZ, Lake interviewed President Barack Obama in 2016 and President Donald Trump in 2020.[33][34] In her last years working in the media, Lake shared false and unverified information on social media, prompting criticism[35] and acquiring a reputation as a provocateur.[25] In 2018, she opposed the Red for Ed movement, which sought more funding for education through strikes and protests, claiming that movement was a \"big push to legalize pot\"; she later apologized for the statement (saying that she \"made an incorrect conclusion\")[35][36] and, according to the station's regional human resources director, subsequently took an unexpected month-long leave from her position at the station.[25] In July 2019, Lake was caught on \"hot mic\" footage promoting her account on the web platform Parler.[25] She shared COVID-19 misinformation on Twitter and Facebook in April 2020.[25] Lake's statements and actions made her a divisive figure among colleagues in her last years at the station.[25] In March 2021, she announced her departure from KSAZ, one day after FTVLive, a television news industry website, published a video clip of Lake at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Orlando, Florida; the website questioned whether Lake was there as a journalist or as a member of a movement.[35] In June 2021, she announced her campaign for governor.[35] Lake was a member of the Republican Party until November 3, 2006,[37] when she changed her registration to become an independent. She registered as a Democrat on January 4, 2008, the day after the Iowa Democratic presidential caucuses were won by Obama.[37] Lake returned to being a Republican on January 31, 2012. She explained leaving the Republican Party in 2006 as a reaction to the then-ongoing Iraq and Afghanistan wars. She had supported John Kerry in 2004 and Barack Obama in 2008.[37] She also made several donations to Democratic presidential candidates.[37][38] After launching her campaign for governor in 2021, Lake cited Trump, Ronald Reagan, and Arizona Republican Party chair Kelli Ward, all former Democrats, as precedent for her party-switching.[39] Lake filed paperwork in June 2021 to seek the Republican nomination for governor of Arizona in the 2022 election to succeed incumbent governor Doug Ducey, who was term-limited.[40] Four candidates sought the Republican nomination: Lake; former real estate developer and Arizona Board of Regents member Karrin Taylor Robson; Paola Tulliani Zen, and Scott Neely.[41] Lake and Robson were the front-runners, leading in polling and fundraising.[41] A fifth Republican candidate, ex-congressman Matt Salmon, dropped out of the race after trailing in polls and endorsed Robson.[41] Throughout her campaign, Lake was described as \"a champion of the far-right\" movement in the United States.[42][43][44] Lake received Donald Trump's endorsement in September 2021.[45] The primary was seen as a \"battle\" between Republicans aligned with Trump and establishment Republicans. Robson was supported by figures such as former Vice President Mike Pence, governor Ducey, and former New Jersey governor Chris Christie.[46] By the end of 2021, Lake had raised $1.4 million from 12,000 sources.[47] Lake centered her campaign on promoting the false claim that the 2020 presidential election in Arizona and nationwide was \"rigged and stolen\"; Boris Epshteyn, a former Trump White House aide who promoted Trump's efforts to overturn the election results, attributed her victory in the Republican primary, despite being \"outspent 10-to-1,\" to that stance.[45] Lake won the Republican primary in Arizona on August 2, 2022, winning in all counties.[48] After winning the Republican primary, Lake said that \"we're all big boys and big girls\", urging people to \"come together\"; however, within a week of that victory, Lake said: \"We drove a stake through the heart of the McCain machine\".[49] Later in early November, Lake participated in a campaign event where she told \"McCain Republicans\" to \"get the hell out!\"[50] Lake also called the traditional Republican Party \"the party of McCain\", and then stated: \"Boy, Arizona has delivered some losers, haven't they?\"[50] Her statements were in contrast to her past description of John McCain (Arizona's former Republican senator) four years earlier, after his death, as \"courageous\", \"a war hero, icon and a force to be reckoned with\".[50] Democratic gubernatorial candidate Katie Hobbs refused to debate Lake during the election.[51] However, both attended a gubernatorial candidate forum in September 2022, held by the Arizona Chamber of Commerce and Industry, where they separately answered questions.[52] On November 7, 2022, Lake's campaign stated that on November 6, a campaign staffer \"opened an envelope delivered to our campaign office that contained suspicious white powder. It was one of two envelopes that were confiscated by law enforcement\" for testing.[53] On November 11, the Phoenix Police Department said that the Arizona state laboratory had tested the items turned over to them by Lake's campaign, and found \"no substance\" inside.[54] After this revelation, Lake's campaign stated that there actually had been three envelopes, with the first envelope being opened by the staffer having \"a white powdery substance along with a hateful letter\", but that the staffer threw the first envelope away, and that the trash was emptied before police were informed, with police being handed the other two envelopes.[55] In August 2021, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Lake led anti-mask rallies,[56] calling on Arizona State University students to go against the university's mask mandates.[56] Lake said that as governor she would not tolerate mask and vaccine mandates.[57] In November 2021, Lake told a group of Republican retirees that she was taking hydroxychloroquine to prevent COVID-19 infection. She stated that, as governor, she would work to have hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin produced in the state to \"make it easier for us to get these lifesaving drugs\".[58] Lake questioned the science behind COVID-19 vaccines[59] and said that she had not been vaccinated.[60] Lake had been a leading proponent of the false claim that the 2020 presidential election was \"stolen\" from Trump.[7] During her campaign, she aligned herself with Trump[56] and centered her candidacy on promoting election lies.[7][61][62] Lake claimed President Joe Biden did not receive 81 million votes and that Arizona (which was won by Biden in the 2020 presidential election) was actually won by Trump.[7][63] After the 2021 Maricopa County presidential ballot audit found no evidence of election fraud, she demanded the election be \"decertified\" – a legal impossibility,[7] as such a process does not exist.[64] Lake tweeted quotes made by Sidney Powell on Lou Dobbs Tonight falsely asserting there was a sweeping election fraud conspiracy. She has advocated imprisoning Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, her Democratic opponent in the gubernatorial race, on baseless and unspecified allegations of criminality related to the 2020 election.[7] Lake also called for imprisoning journalists.[7] Lake repeatedly claimed that defendants arrested in connection with the January 6 United States Capitol attack were \"being held in prison without being charged\".[65][66] Trump endorsed Lake's candidacy,[67] as did pro-Trump Republican figures such as Arizona congressman Paul Gosar and former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn.[68][better source needed] By contrast, Lake's main primary opponent, Robson, was endorsed by outgoing Republican governor Doug Ducey,[69] as well as Arizona Senate president Karen Fann and Americans for Prosperity.[64] Lake attacked Robson for failing to endorse false claims of election fraud.[61] Lake attended events headed by My Pillow founder Mike Lindell, a prominent promoter of false claims regarding fraud in the 2020 election.[56] During her 2021 campaign for governor, she said that she would not have certified Biden's 2020 election victory in Arizona if she had been governor at the time.[70] During a June 2022 debate among candidates for the Republican nomination, Lake continued to make baseless claims the 2020 presidential election was \"stolen\" and \"corrupt\".[61] Fox News reported in July 2022 that nine days before the 2017 Inauguration of Donald Trump, Lake had posted a meme on Facebook that declared the inauguration a \"national day of mourning and protest\", in which she asked her followers how they would react to Trump's inauguration. She asked \"Will you be protesting the inauguration?\" and how they might protest. The post was deleted after Fox News asked Lake's campaign about it.[71][72] In February 2023, Lake said: \"We've got great candidates on the Republican Party and on our side. We've got so many great candidates that if our elections were really fair, I believe the ranks of Congress, the Senate, I think a White House, I think all the state governorships would be Republican if elections were fair\".[73] In October 2022, Lake twice refused to say that she will accept the result if she lost the election: \"I'm going to win the election, and I will accept that result.\"[74] Multiple media outlets projected on November 14, 2022, that Lake had narrowly lost the gubernatorial election to Hobbs.[75][76] Lake's reaction to this was tweeting that \"Arizonans know BS when they see it.\"[77] On November 17, Lake still refused to concede her loss, and announced she was assembling a legal team to challenge the results.[78][79] Arizona's election results were certified on December 5, with Lake losing to Hobbs by a margin of over 17,000 votes: Lake received 1,270,774 votes, while Hobbs received 1,287,891 votes.[80][81] A January 2023 analysis by a trio of election data experts, collectively known as the Audit Guys, concluded that in Maricopa County, over 33,000 voters who voted Republican in down-ballot races chose to vote for Hobbs instead of Lake, while nearly 6,000 Republican leaning voters did not vote in the gubernatorial election or wrote in another candidate instead of Lake; together, these voters could have flipped the result of the election had they voted for Lake.[82] Conversely, the analysis found that Lake received fewer than 6,000 votes from Democrat-leaning voters in Maricopa County.[82] Meanwhile, the Associated Press reported in February 2023 that its survey of over 3,200 voters estimated that 11% of Arizona Republicans had voted for Hobbs, while 4% of Arizona Democrats voted for Lake.[83] Lake alleged voter disfranchisement due to ballot printing problems and long waiting lines in Maricopa County, which had elections run by local Republican officials.[78][84] In 70 out of 223 Maricopa County polling sites, voting machine ballots were printed too lightly to be read by tabulators; the problem was caused by a printer setting which had not shown widespread issues during prior testing.[78][85] If voters did not want to wait in line for the issue to be fixed, they could leave to vote at another Maricopa County polling site, with wait times for polling sites being shown online, and many polling sites had little to no waiting lines, stated Maricopa County election officials.[78][79][86] Alternatively, voters could drop their ballots into a secure box (\"Box 3\"), with these ballots being later tabulated at Maricopa County's elections headquarters, under monitoring from observers from both parties; ultimately, around 17,000 Maricopa County ballots were dropped into Box 3.[78][79][87] The Arizona secretary of state's office spokesperson said that \"Every voter who went to one of the voting locations affected was still able to cast their ballot\", and voting rights experts agreed.[88] Bill Gates, the Republican chair of Maricopa's Board of Supervisors, partially blamed the long lines on Arizona Republican Party chairwoman Kelli Ward for discouraging voters from using Box 3; she had claimed that Box 3 should not be used as \"Maricopa County is not turning on their tabulators downtown today\".[78][89] Lake herself told her supporters to stay in line to vote, while a lawyer for Lake's campaign assuaged concerns about using Box 3 to vote.[89] Lake's campaign filed a lawsuit on Election Day to extend voting for another three hours, but Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Tim Ryan declined to do so, stating: \"The court doesn't have any evidence that any voter was precluded from their right to vote\".[90] While Lake alleged that Republican-dominated areas in Maricopa County were disproportionately affected by the printing problems, The Washington Post found that the percentage of registered Republicans in affected precincts (37%) was very close to the percentage of registered Republicans across Maricopa County (35%), and also found that some Democrat-dominated areas also faced the printing problems.[85][91] Meanwhile, The New York Times analyzed 45 claims of irregularities reported by voters, finding that in 34 of these 45 claims, the voters were able to cast their vote despite an inconvenience; while for the others, three raised problems with voter registration; seven gave unclear accounts as to what exactly happened; and only one said she had been denied the opportunity to vote, though she acknowledged she had arrived at her polling place at the time it closed.[89] Lake self-identified as a \"proud election denying deplorable\" in December 2022.[92] Hobbs was sworn in as governor on January 2, 2023.[93] Later in January 2023, Lake posted on Twitter 16 voter signatures, mostly from 2020, suggesting that these were from illegal ballots because the signatures did not match; Arizona law states that \"records containing a voter's signature ... shall not be ... reproduced by any person other than the voter\", with the exception of those working for the county recorder.[94] She also posted a false claim that almost 250,000 voting attempts failed during the 2022 Arizona elections, without proving that the votes were not counted; during the elections, votes that could not be initially scanned were later counted at another location.[95] Lake's campaign raised $2.6 million from Election Day until the end of 2022, while taking in even more money from a non-profit fundraising group started by Lake's advisers in December 2022; this group became Lake's main fundraising outlet by February 2023, and is not required to publish donation details.[83] The Arizona Mirror found in January 2023 that less than 10% of the funds raised by Lake after the election were paid to lawyers, despite Lake claiming that the funds were meant for contesting election results.[96] The results of an independent investigation into the 2022 election's printing problems was published in April 2023; the investigation was led by a retired chief justice of the Arizona Supreme Court, Ruth McGregor, who concluded that \"the primary cause of the election day failures was equipment failure\", and that no evidence gathered gave \"clear indication that the problems should have been anticipated\". McGregor also detailed: \"Two-thirds of the general election vote centers reported no issues with misprinted ballots; approximately 94 percent of election day ballots were not faulty\".[97][98] In February 2024, Lake was questioned about her claims about the 2022 gubernatorial election, to which she replied: \"I don't know who exactly stole the election, but there are a lot of people who are running elections poorly, and we've seen the results.\"[99] In June 2023, Maricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer sued Lake for defamation. Richer alleged that Lake had defamed him by repeatedly accusing him of intentionally sabotaging the 2022 election by printing wrong-sized ballots and injecting 300,000 illegal votes into the Maricopa County vote count; he alleged that Lake's statements caused threats against him and his family, and resulted in him being ostracized from Republican donors and networks.[100] In December 2023, a Maricopa County judge denied Lake's motion to dismiss, ruling that Lake's statements were not \"rhetorical hyperbole\" and would not be protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution if they were proven to be false.[101][102] In 2024, the Arizona Court of Appeals and the Arizona Supreme Court both rejected Lake's appeal, clearing the way for a trial.[103][104] In March 2024, Lake requested a hearing for a default judgment against herself in the defamation case, deciding not to contest the defamation claim, and asking for the trial to proceed to the amount of damages she would have to pay Richer.[105] Within days, Judge Adleman ruled that Lake could no longer claim in court that she had not defamed Richer, because under \"well-established Arizona law – a defaulted party loses all rights to litigate the merits of the cause of action\".[106] In November 2024, the court stated that Lake and Richer had settled the defamation case.[107] In April 2022, Lake and Mark Finchem sued state officials, seeking to ban electronic voting machines from being used in her 2022 election.[108] In August 2022, U.S. District Judge John Tuchi dismissed the suit, writing that Lake and Finchem \"articulated only conjectural allegations of potential injuries\" and thus lacked standing.[109] In his ruling, Tuchi also cited the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution, as well as the Purcell principle.[110][111] In December 2022, Tuchi sanctioned Lake's lawyers in this suit, including Alan Dershowitz, for making \"false, misleading, and unsupported\" assertions during the case, and making claims without \"an adequate factual or legal basis grounded in a reasonable pre-filing inquiry\"; he ordered the plaintiffs to pay the defendants' attorney fees.[108] Tuchi said the sanctions would show that the court does not tolerate litigants \"furthering false narratives that baselessly undermine public trust at a time of increasing disinformation about, and distrust in, the democratic process\".[108] The sanction amount was set by Tuchi to be roughly $122,000.[112] Finchem and Lake's appeal, aimed at banning electronic voting machines, was rejected in October 2022 by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which highlighted that \"counsel for plaintiffs conceded that their arguments were limited to potential future hacking, and not based on any past harm\", and voiced agreement \"with the district court that plaintiffs' speculative allegations that voting machines may be hackable are insufficient to establish an injury\".[113] Finchem and Lake in March 2024 appealed to the United States Supreme Court, which rejected their lawsuit in April 2024.[114][115] Finchem and Lake then appealed again to the Ninth Circuit, which tersely denied the appeal in June 2024.[116] On December 9, 2022, after Arizona certified the election results, Lake filed a new suit in state court, seeking a court order to either overturn Hobbs' victory and declare Lake as the winner of the election, or redo the election in Maricopa County.[8][117] Lake's complaint alleged that there were hundreds of thousands of illegal votes in the election, but provided no evidence in support of these claims.[118] On December 19, Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Peter Thompson, who was appointed by Republican governor Jan Brewer, dismissed eight of ten counts of Lake's lawsuit (specifically, her claims of invalid signatures on mail-in ballots, incorrect certification, inadequate remedy, and violations of freedom of speech, equal protection, due process, the secrecy clause, and constitutional rights).[9][119] The judge allowed the remaining two counts (Lake's claim that election officials intentionally interfered with Maricopa County ballot printers and with the chain of custody of Maricopa County ballots) to go to trial,[120] specifying that Lake would need to prove at trial that the allegations were true and that the alleged actions actually changed the election.[121] During the two-day trial, Northrop Grumman information security officer Clay Parikh, a witness called by Lake, testified that some ballots had printing errors that would cause tabulation issues, but these misprinted ballots would ultimately be counted after duplicates were made.[122][123] On December 24, Judge Thompson dismissed Lake's remaining case,[124][123] writing: \"Every single witness before the Court disclaimed any personal knowledge of such [intentional] misconduct. The Court cannot accept speculation or conjecture in place of clear and convincing evidence\".[125][126] The judge further ruled that \"printer failures did not actually affect the results of the election\", noting that a witness called by Lake testified that \"printer failures were largely the result of unforeseen mechanical failure.\"[123][125] A day after the ruling was issued, Lake's Twitter page attacked the judge in this case, linking to a Townhall article to baselessly claim that \"his decision was ghostwritten\" by \"top left-wing attorneys like Marc Elias.'\" No evidence supported the tweet's claim, and the tweet was deleted the next day, after Secretary Hobbs filed a motion to sanction Lake.[127][128][129] On December 27, Judge Thompson ordered Lake to pay Hobbs $33,000 in fees for expert witnesses and a ballot inspector due to the lawsuit, but did not sanction Lake for filing the lawsuit.[130][131] Lake appealed the dismissal and the order directing her to pay $33,000 in fees.[132] A three-judge panel of the Arizona Court of Appeals unanimously rejected Lake's appeal on February 16, 2023.[10][133] The court found that \"Lake’s only purported evidence\" that long lines at voting centers \"had any potential effect on election results was, quite simply, sheer speculation\";[134] that \"Lake presented no evidence that voters whose ballots were unreadable by on-site tabulators were not able to vote\" (and, indeed, that Lake's own cybersecurity expert testified to the contrary);[133] and that the evidence in the trial record showed that \"voters were able to cast their ballots, that votes were counted correctly and that no other basis justifies setting aside the election results\".[135] Lake sought to appeal to the Arizona Supreme Court.[11] On March 22, 2023, the Court denied Lake's request to hear her lawsuit.[136] The Court issued a five-page order ruling that the lower courts had correctly dismissed six of Lake's seven legal claims, determining that these challenges were \"insufficient to warrant the requested relief under Arizona or federal law.\"[12][136] For Lake's remaining legal claim (on signature verification), the Arizona Supreme Court ruled that the lower courts incorrectly interpreted her challenge as pertaining to signature verification policies themselves, instead of the application of such policies, and remanded (sent back) the remaining claim to the trial court.[12] After a three-day trial, Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Peter Thompson ruled against Lake for her remaining claim on May 22, 2023, thus re-affirming Hobbs' election.[13] Thompson wrote that Lake had not provided \"clear and convincing evidence or a preponderance of evidence\" of misconduct in the election, while there was \"ample evidence that – objectively speaking – a comparison between voter records and signatures was conducted in every instance [Lake] asked the Court to evaluate.\"[13][137] Thompson noted that Lake's attorneys earlier argued that Maricopa County did not perform signature verification, but later argued that signature verification was performed, but done too quickly.[13] Thompson concluded that it was possible for signature verification to be done quickly and properly when \"looking at signatures that, by and large, have consistent characteristics\".[138] Lake was not sanctioned by Thompson for her final claim, as he ruled that while there was no clear or convincing evidence for this claim, it was not necessarily \"groundless\".[139] The Arizona Supreme Court in May 2023 ruled that it was employing \"the extraordinary remedy of a sanction\" on Lake's lawyers, imposing a $2,000 fine on them for making \"false factual statements to the Court\".[140][141] Lake's lawyers had falsely claimed in legal filings that it was an \"undisputed fact that 35,563 unaccounted for ballots were added to the total of ballots [at] a third party processing facility;[142] in imposing its sanction, the Arizona Supreme Court stated that \"no evidence\" supported the claim that 35,563 ballots were added, and that Lake's claim had been disputed by the other side, making the claim of an \"undisputed\" fact \"unequivocally false\".[140] During Lake's appeal of Thompson's ruling against her final claim, she tried to appeal directly to the Arizona Supreme Court, which denied her motion to do so in July 2023, citing \"no good cause\" for Lake to skip appealing to the Arizona Court of Appeals.[143] Lake's appeal was rejected by the Arizona Court of Appeals in June 2024, with Judge Sean Brearcliffe stating that Lake had claimed \"8,000 uncounted votes\", but this could not overcome her loss margin of over 17,000 votes to Hobbs, and while Lake claimed she had new evidence to present, Brearcliffe found that she already possessed the evidence previously, but did not \"analyze\" it.[14] Lake appealed to the Arizona Supreme Court in July 2024, which declined in November 2024 to hear Lake's appeal, ensuring that the lower courts' rulings were maintained, which ended Lake's legal challenge against the 2022 result.[144][15] In April 2023, Lake sued Maricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer, seeking to compel him to produce 1.3 million ballot affidavit envelopes, containing voters' signatures, names, addresses, and phone numbers. After a September 2023 trial, Maricopa County Superior Court Judge John Hannah ruled against Lake in November 2023. The court ruled that release of voters' personal information would bring a \"significant risk of widespread voter fraud where none now exists\"; would expose voters to harassment, loss of privacy, and identity theft; and had the potential to discourage voting.[145][146] In March 2024, Lake abandoned her appeal of Hannah's ruling.[147] Lake announced her candidacy for the 2024 United States Senate election in Arizona on October 10, 2023.[148] In November 2023, Politico noted that Lake had pivoted from the fire-and-brimstone approach of her gubernatorial campaign to a more diplomatic approach, seeking to mend relationships with Republicans she had previously attacked.[149] The Hill also noted that Lake \"sought to strike a more conciliatory tone with Republicans\" compared to her 2022 campaign.[150] In January 2024, Lake publicly called for Arizona Republican Party chair Jeff DeWit to resign for being \"corrupt and compromised\", with DeWit resigning a day later.[151] Before the resignation, a recording of Lake and DeWit conversing in March 2023 had been published by right-wing talk show host Garret Lewis.[151] In the recording, DeWit told Lake that \"back east\", \"there are very powerful people who want to keep you out\" of the 2024 Arizona Senate race and \"they're willing to put their money where their mouth is, in a big way\", for Lake to \"take a pause for a couple of years\", while Lake responded: \"I can't be bought.\"[151][152][153] Lake called the incident a \"bribery scandal\", while DeWit accused Lake acting in a \"deceptive\" manner by releasing \"a selectively edited audio recording\" made when Lake was employed by DeWit.[151][153] According to DeWit, he had previously advised Lake to \"postpone her campaign and aim for the Governor's position in two years\".[154] DeWit explained his resignation as due to \"Lake's team\" demanding it or he would \"face the release of a new, more damaging recording\".[153] In response, two of Lake's advisors denied having \"threatened or blackmailed\" DeWit.[151] In February 2024, she spoke at CPAC, saying she was \"tired of beta men\" and wanted \"some alpha men.\"[155] In April, when discussing the 2024 election campaign, Lake said that the \"next six months are going to be difficult. If you are not ready for action, and I have a feeling with as many veterans and former law enforcement, active law enforcement ... you guys are ready for it [...] they're going to come after us with everything. That's why the next six months is going to be intense. [...] We are going to put on the armor of God. And maybe strap on a Glock on the side of us just in case.\"[156] Lake was defeated by Democratic nominee Ruben Gallego in the November 2024 general election.[157] Lake received around 80,000 fewer votes compared to Gallego.[158] In mid-November 2024, as vote counting was still ongoing, The Washington Post contrasted how Lake was losing by 2% in Arizona when fellow Republican Donald Trump was simultaneously winning by almost 6% in Arizona.[159] Lake identifies as a conservative Republican[37] and described herself in 2022 as a \"Trump candidate\".[25] She accused President Joe Biden and Democrats of harboring a \"demonic agenda\".[25] In 2022, Lake said that she considers abortion to be \"the ultimate sin\".[160] She praised the June 2022 Supreme Court decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, which held that there was no federal right to abortion under the U.S. Constitution, and overturned Roe v. Wade.[161] In 2022, Lake repeatedly expressed support for an 1864 law from the Arizona Territory period that prohibited abortion in Arizona except to save the life of a mother (saying she was \"incredibly thrilled that we are going to have a great law that's already on the books\"), and she called for other states to adopt similar laws.[162][163][164] In November 2023, Lake reaffirmed her support for the 1864 abortion ban.[165] After Democrats enjoyed electoral success by campaigning for abortion rights, Lake began to distance herself from the law.[162] In early 2024, Lake shifted positions; her website said that she \"does not support a federal ban on abortion\"[164] and in a March 2024 interview she denounced the 1864 anti-abortion law.[163] Lake instead supported Arizona's abortion restriction after 15 weeks.[165] On April 11, 2024, after the Arizona Supreme Court ruled in favor of enforcing the 1864 territorial law, Lake said the law was \"out of step with Arizonans\" and urged Arizonan legislators to \"come up with an immediate common sense solution that Arizonans can support\"; she described abortion as \"a personal and private issue.\"[163][166] Days later, on April 16, she discussed people's ability to sidestep the 1864 law in Arizona by traveling to neighboring states: \"Even if we have a restrictive law here ... you can go three hours that way, three hours that way, and you're going to be able to have an abortion\".[167] Thereafter, on April 20, 2024, Lake changed her position again, returning to her earlier position of supporting the 1864 law, after Governor of Arizona Katie Hobbs and Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes indicated that they would not prosecute offenders of the 1864 law. Lake said: \"The Arizona Supreme Court said this is the law of Arizona. But unfortunately the people running our state have said we're not going to enforce it. So, it's really political theater. [...] We don't have that law, as much as many of us wish we did.\"[168][169] In an op-ed for the Independent Journal Review, Lake wrote that as governor she would deport illegal immigrants that enter Arizona without seeking federal approval and complete unfinished portions of the Trump wall on the Mexico–United States border.[170] Lake was criticized for deeming drag queens as being potentially harmful to children despite having attended drag events herself in the past.[171][172] Following the criticism, she clarified that she supports adults being able to attend drag shows, while Lake's campaign spokesperson, Ross Trumble, also did acknowledge that Lake's daughter, a minor at the time, attended a private event where a drag queen \"showed up as a Marilyn Monroe impersonator.\"[173] In 2015, Lake stated on social media that she supported an adult's and young person's right to gender transition, but later reversed that position saying in 2022 that both gender and sex are determined at birth.[174][175] After her election loss, she was listed as an honoree and presenter at Mar-a-Lago for the December 15, 2022, \"Spirit of Lincoln Gala,\" an event held by the Log Cabin Republicans, a political action committee for LGBTQ Republicans.[176][177] In 2024, the Log Cabin Republicans endorsed Lake's Senate campaign.[178][179] In an interview with 60 Minutes Australia journalist Liam Bartlett, Lake asserted that Australians \"have no freedom\" due to strict Australian gun laws.[180] Lake has been married to Jeff Halperin since August 1998.[30] They have two children.[181] She was previously married to Tracy Finnegan, an electrical engineer.[182] Lake grew up as a Catholic.[183] She previously identified as a Buddhist before 2015 according to her friends.[184] As of 2022, Lake identifies as an Evangelical Christian.[183][184]",

                "title": "Fierce Trump ally Kari Lake tapped to lead Voice of America",
                "content": "President-elect Donald Trump said he wants Kari Lake, a fierce ally who has denied the results of the 2020 US presidential election, to lead Voice of America - a federally funded global news outlet. Donald Trump made the announcement on Wednesday night, writing on his social media platform Truth Social that Lake would be appointed by and work closely with the next head of the US Agency for Global Media, which oversees all non-military, US international broadcasting. He said he would announce a pick for the head \"soon\". Lake left her long-time post as a news anchor in 2021 for failed Republican bids for an Arizona seat in the US Senate and to serve as the state's governor. She became a vocal critic of the media in her brief political career and has referred to journalists as \"monsters\". Trump said Lake would \"ensure that the American values of Freedom and Liberty are broadcast around the World FAIRLY and ACCURATELY\". In response on X, Lake wrote she was \"honoured\" by Trump's selection. \"Under my leadership, the VOA will excel in its mission: chronicling America's achievements worldwide. Thank you for putting your trust in me,\" she wrote. The VOA is an organisation with a nearly $267.5m (£211m) budget and more than 2,000 employees, according to the New York Times. Founded in 1942, the organisation's congressional charter protects the editorial independence and integrity of its programming. VOA broadcasts in nearly 50 languages and reaches more than 326 million people weekly, \"providing comprehensive coverage of the news and telling audiences the truth\", according to its website. During Trump's first administration, he was a staunch VOA critic, saying in 2020 that the \"things they say are disgusting toward our country\". That year, Trump appointed Michael Pack to run the agency that oversees VOA - the US Agency for Global Media - which ran into a series of legal troubles. Pack was accused of turning VOA into a pro-Trump propaganda machine and a federal judge ruled that Pack had violated journalists' First Amendment rights. When Biden took office in 2021, he moved quickly to remove a number of senior officials aligned with Trump from VOA. Lake worked at a local Fox News affiliate in Phoenix for 22 years before ending her career in 2021 to run for Arizona governor on the Republican ticket. On the campaign trail, she caught Trump's attention while vigorously denying his 2020 election loss and repeating his claims of fraud. Lake also denied the results of her own gubernatorial race, filing several failed lawsuits seeking to overturn her loss, and making election fraud claims that resulted in her being sued for defamation. Her combative political style paved the way for an even bigger election loss in 2024 during her Senate bid. Lake also made controversial remarks about the media, including the suggestion: \"Let's defund the press\". She told a gaggle of camera operators and reporters in 2022 that, if elected, \"I'm going to be your worst fricking nightmare\". Her appointment to lead VOA would be \"significant\", George Washington University political science professor Quardricos Driskell said, and to some a cause for \"alarm\". \"The alarm here is when you have a person who is making threatening comments towards this idea of a free press,\" he said, referring to Lake's past \"fake news\" remarks. The current VOA director is Michael Abramowitz, a former Washington Post White House correspondent and member of the Council on Foreign Relations. Trump also announced a spate of other appointments on Wednesday night, including Florida personal injury attorney Dan Newlin to be US ambassador to Colombia and physician and Republican donor Peter Lamelas to be US ambassador to Argentina. Mr Timmerman told CBS that he was detained upon entering Syria seven months ago. Dozens of drone sightings have been reported, so far leaving the FBI baffled. The White House says it is the highest number of presidential acts of clemency in a single day. Ryan Borgwardt \"returned on his own\" roughly four months after he vanished on a fishing trip, police said.

                "title": "Kari Lake, Donald Trump's Pick for Voice Of America, Has Vowed to Be Reporters' “Worst Frickin' Nightmare” | Vanity Fair",
                "content": "President-elect Donald Trump continued his hit parade of political appointments for extended family, Fox News alums, and other assorted goobers Wednesday night on Truth Social, announcing Kari Lake as his pick for director of Voice of America, the government-funded international news outlet. There’s just one (several) tiny (significant) problem(s): The VOA, which is part of the U.S. Agency for Global Media, is government-funded, not government-run. The outlet was created in 1942 to push back against Nazi propaganda and deliver clear-eyed, objective news from the U.S. around the world. It currently broadcasts in 48 languages, with an estimated weekly reach of 326 million adults globally across its platforms. Appointees of both VOA and its parent agency are subject to several layers of approvals, as well as a “firewall” for the organization to ensure that the government isn’t inserting its own agendas and biases into VOA’s output. But by suggesting Lake to run the outlet, Trump certainly appears to be trying to do just that, with hopes of the Voice of America acting as, well, the Voice of Trump, as if he hasn’t already said enough. Lake is a former news anchor who, much like Trump, has frequently expressed her disdain for the mainstream media, and joined him in publicly denying that the results of the 2020 election were valid. According to Trump, Lake will “ensure that the American values of Freedom and Liberty are broadcast around the World FAIRLY and ACCURATELY, unlike the lies spread by the Fake News Media.” His congratulatory post continued with his signature creative capitalization: “Kari was a beloved News Anchor in Arizona, which supported me by record margins, for over 20 years.” For her part, Lake said she was “honored” to be put up for the gig. “Under my leadership, the VOA will excel in its mission: chronicling America’s achievements worldwide,” she wrote on social media. Her news anchor days behind her, Lake has turned her attention to unsuccessfully grasping for political office. She ran (and was defeated) in the 2022 gubernatorial race in Arizona, the results of which she refused to accept for quite some time, and more recently had a failed Senate bid for the state in November. In 2022, she told journalists that she would be their “worst frickin' nightmare” if elected, and has called to “defund the press,” whom she has also referred to as “monsters.” Trump clashed with the Agency for Global Media and its mission, which is antithetical to Trump’s goals of promoting his own agenda. More than 30 whistleblowers within VOA complained about Michael Pack, Trump’s first-term appointee. An anonymous VOA employee told CNN that “many of us are very disturbed” by Trump’s intention to place Lake in the position. The president is not able to unilaterally install personnel at the outlet: The head of VOA must be approved by a seven-person committee that includes the Secretary of State; the other six members, which must be split between Democrats and Republicans, must also be approved by the Senate. That might seem to spell disaster for Lake, but Pete Hegseth still stands a chance of being confirmed as Defense Secretary, cats and dogs have been known to live together in harmony, and who can even say what’s real anymore. Lake is already on a roll of twisting and tilting something similar to the truth into something that fits her agenda while also passing as “fact” if you squint your eyes and don’t think about it too much: In a social media post Thursday morning reacting to Trump being named Time’s Person of the Year for 2024, the second time the publication has granted him the title, she shared a picture of the cover with the commentary, “FINALLY, Time magazine, got it right. (Except America is NOT divided. We are United to put America First!)” The cover she shared was from 2016. Oops. This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. She posted the newer 2024 cover on her Instagram account later, writing, “Trump should have been the Person of the Year every year for the last decade. He will go down as one of the most consequential leaders in history.

                "content": "US president-elect names supporter known for denying the results of the 2020 presidential election. United States President-elect Donald Trump has named Kari Lake, a former television news anchor who mounted unsuccessful Senate and gubernatorial campaigns in Arizona, as his pick to run the state-funded global media organisation Voice of America (VOA). Trump said on Wednesday that Lake, who has attracted criticism for espousing hardline views on immigration and denying the results of the 2020 presidential election, would work closely with the yet-to-be-announced next head of the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM). In her role, Lake will ensure “that the American values of Freedom and Liberty are broadcast around the World FAIRLY and ACCURATELY, unlike the lies spread by the Fake News Media”, Trump said in a statement on his platform Truth Social. In a post expressing gratitude to Trump on X, Lake said VOA was a “vital international media outlet dedicated to advancing the interests of the United States by engaging directly with people across the globe and promoting democracy and truth”. “Under my leadership, the VOA will excel in its mission: chronicling America’s achievements worldwide,” Lake said. During her bid for the Arizona governorship, Lake repeatedly echoed Trump’s false claims that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. After narrowly losing the race, Lake refused to concede to her Democrat opponent Katie Hobbs and levelled unsubstantiated claims of election fraud. Yaqiu Wang, research director for China at the nonprofit Freedom House, described Trump’s choice of Lake as “deeply concerning”. “Despite its flaws, VOA has been a vital source for human rights news in China, and for the global Chinese-language audience to understand the US and global politics. VOA is not CGTN precisely because it does real journalism,” Wang said on X, referring to China’s English-language broadcaster. VOA, which is funded by the US Congress and carries news online, on radio and TV, operates in more than 40 languages and claims a weekly audience of more than 354 million people worldwide. During Trump’s first term as president, reports that political appointees at the USAGM launched an investigation into the VOA’s then-White House Bureau Chief Steve Herman for alleged bias against the former president drew condemnation from media freedom organisations. “These actions violate the First Amendment as well as a statutory firewall intended to make the US Agency for Global Media impervious to political interference in order to maintain ‘the highest standards of professional journalism,'” the Asian American Journalists Association said in a statement at the time. In 2020, a bipartisan group of senators said they would review USAGM’s funding after then-CEO Michael Pack, a Trump-appointed conservative documentary filmmaker, fired or reassigned numerous senior staff and network heads. Last year, a report by the independent Office of Special Counsel found that Pack had breached regulations meant to prevent political interference in editorial decision-making and abused his authority.

                "content": "Chelsea is an English given name derived from the Old English place name ċealc hȳð,[1] or the modern Celcyth, meaning chalk landing place. The name evolved to Chelsea, a location on the River Thames that became a London borough known for its wealthy, socially influential residents. Many locations have been named after the English place name Chelsea.[2] The given name, a transferred use of the place name, was in use for boys in the New England region of the United States by the late 18th century and was first used for American girls in the 1840s.[2] The name was first popularized for girls in larger numbers in the United States by American comedian Chelsea Brown, who was born Lois Brown but chose Chelsea as a stage name. After Brown began appearing on the American television program Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In in 1968, the name quadrupled in use for American girls to 48 uses that year. The name debuted among the 1,000 most popular names for American girls in 1969, in 702nd place. Chelsea Morning, a 1969 hit song written about mornings in Chelsea, Manhattan by Canadian singer Joni Mitchell and later performed by Judy Collins, further popularized the name for girls with its descriptive lyrics such as \"the light poured in like butterscotch.\"[2] The name of Chelsea Clinton, daughter of American President Bill Clinton and former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, was inspired by the song when she was born in 1980. The name Chelsea increased further in popularity in the 1980s due to its use for film and television characters, such as Chelsea Thayer Wayne, a character played by Jane Fonda in the 1981 American film On Golden Pond and Chelsea Reardon, a character played by Kassie DePaiva on the American soap opera Guiding Light beginning in 1986. In 1992, the name reached peak popularity in the United States and would have been the eighth most popular name for American girls in that year if all spellings of the name were combined. The name dramatically declined in use in 1993, during the first year of Bill Clinton's presidency. At the time, it was out of fashion in the United States to name children after politicians and those who were associated with them. The name has continued to decline in use, but remained among the 1,000 most popular names for American girls in 2023.[2] Spelling variants in use in the United States include Chelsey, Chelsi, Chelsie, and Chelsy.[2] The name has also been in regular use throughout the Anglosphere, including Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, as well as in Belgium, France and Netherlands.[3]",

He competed in the sixth season of The Voice, originally as a member of Usher's team, but later as a member of Adam Levine's team. After being eliminated in the playoffs of that season, he signed to Panacea Records, releasing his debut EP, Stand Alone, in 2015. In 2016, Wallen signed to Big Loud, releasing his debut album, If I Know Me, in 2018. The album includes the singles \"Up Down\" featuring Florida Georgia Line, \"Whiskey Glasses\", and \"Chasin' You\". If I Know Me reached No. 1 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart. Wallen's second album, Dangerous: The Double Album, was released in January 2021, and in February 2021 became the only country album in the 64-year history of the Billboard 200 to spend its first seven weeks at No. 1.[4] It spent its first ten weeks at number one, the first album to do so since Whitney Houston's Whitney in 1987.[5] The album included singles \"More Than My Hometown\", \"7 Summers\", and \"Wasted on You\".[6] His third studio album, One Thing at a Time (2023), topped the Billboard 200 for 19 non-consecutive weeks, with all of its 36 tracks entering the Billboard Hot 100. This broke the record for most songs by an artist on the chart at one time.[7] The single \"Last Night\" peaked atop the Hot 100 in 2023, becoming Wallen's first single to do so, and later set the record for the most weeks at number one for a non-collaboration song (sixteen weeks), as well as tying for the second most weeks of all time and topping the year-end chart. He has received several awards including an Academy of Country Music Award and fourteen Billboard Music Awards.[8] He won Entertainer of the Year at the 58th Annual Country Music Association Awards.[9] Morgan Cole Wallen was born on May 13, 1993, in Sneedville, Tennessee, to Tommy and Lesli Wallen.[10] Tommy served for a time as a local church pastor,[11] while Lesli worked as a teacher. In his teens, the family moved south to Knox County, where he graduated from Gibbs High School.[12] He was a pitcher and shortstop for the school's baseball team, and hoped to continue in college, but tore his ulnar collateral ligament his senior year.[13] As a child, Wallen took piano and violin lessons. He was raised on a diverse musical playlist, with his father exposing him to classic rock mainstays. In his teens, he gravitated towards bands like Breaking Benjamin and Nickelback, as well as rappers like Lil Wayne.[14] Wallen has characterized his early adulthood as adrift; he worked in landscaping after high school and was disappointed by his inability to continue his baseball career.[11] He re-approached his interest in music and began learning guitar.[14] He had grown to love country music, especially artists like Keith Whitley and Eric Church, and he modeled his sound after that lineage.[14] In 2014, Wallen competed on season 6 of the music competition program The Voice. He auditioned with the song \"Collide\" by Howie Day. Judges Shakira and Usher complimented his stylings, and Wallen joined Usher's team. He was later taken by Adam Levine's team after his second round, and later eliminated during the playoffs.[13] Wallen later said of his experience on the show, \"Some things in life are out of your control. Being the best you can be isn't. I didn't feel like I was the best I could have been. So I practiced harder\".[14] The Voice was instrumental in raising Wallen's profile, and he began to establish connections in the music industry.[12] While in California to appear on The Voice, Wallen began working with Sergio Sanchez of Atom Smash, a vocal coach on the program. Wallen relocated to Nashville to further his career, and he and Sanchez started a temporary band: Morgan Wallen & Them Shadows.[12] Sanchez introduced Wallen to Bill Ray and Paul Trust of Panacea Records.[15] In 2015, Wallen signed to Panacea Records where he was joined by Dominic Frost on guitar and released the Stand Alone (EP) on August 24, 2015. \"Spin You Around\" was Wallen's debut single under Panacea Records; it was later certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 2021.[16] In 2015, Wallen's manager, Dirk Hemsath of Working Group Artist Management, sent a demo of Wallen to record executive Seth England, who had Wallen audition for Big Loud, an independent record label. They signed Wallen to the label and the publishing company,[15] who began pairing his songs with other artists. That year, he released his debut single \"The Way I Talk\";[17] his first music video for the song followed in 2017.[18] Wallen co-wrote the A Thousand Horses's single \"Preachin' to the Choir\",[13] Dallas Smith's \"The Fall\",[19] as well as Jason Aldean's \"You Make It Easy\" with Florida Georgia Line's Tyler Hubbard, Brian Kelley, and Jordan Schmidt.[20] He joined Florida Georgia Line on their Dig Your Roots Tour.[13] He collaborated with the group on the single \"Up Down\", his first song to reach the top five of Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart.[21] At the outset of his career, Wallen underwent a personal stylistic shift, adopting a distinctive mullet and a look that Kelefa Sanneh, profiling Wallen's rise in a piece for The New Yorker, described as \"Everyman rock star\" and \"not just a singer but a character\".[11] Wallen had decided to adopt the retro hairdo after seeing a younger photo of his father with the cut.[14] Wallen's debut studio album, If I Know Me, was released on April 27, 2018,[22] with its third single, \"Whiskey Glasses\", becoming his biggest success yet.[23] The song reached the top spot on both the Hot Country Songs and Country Airplay charts; it also marked his top 40 appearance on the all-genre Hot 100 ranking, where it placed at number 17. It was Billboard's 2019 top Hot Country song and Top Country Airplay song.[24] Sanneh characterized \"Whiskey Glasses\" as his signature song and a \"perfectly constructed ode to a woman and a drink, lost and found, respectively\".[11] In 2019, Wallen joined Florida Georgia Line on their Can't Say I Ain't Country Tour.[25] His next single, \"Chasin' You\", was serviced to radio in July 2019 and peaked at number two on the Hot Country Songs chart;[26][6] like its predecessor, it captured the top spot on the overall year-end tally for 2020.[14] In August 2020, If I Know Me reached No. 1 on the Top Country Albums chart after a record-breaking 114 weeks. Wallen's profile continued to rise, with a growing following on platforms like TikTok, and he developed into an unwitting sex symbol.[11] Wallen appeared on the cover of Billboard, whose headline read: \"Is Morgan Wallen Country's Next Global Star?\"[14] At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, Wallen found himself with more time to write and record material, which developed into his sophomore album, the double-disc Dangerous: The Double Album (2021),[27] which showcases a mix of country and R&B/pop balladry.[12] Dangerous was an immediate blockbuster: it debuted atop the US Billboard 200 and the Canadian Albums Chart;[28][29] it would remain atop the Canadian chart for four consecutive weeks, and the US chart for six consecutive weeks, marking the first new album from a country artist to do that since Garth Brooks' The Chase in 1992.[30][31][32][33] Its singles—\"More Than My Hometown\", \"7 Summers\", \"Sand in My Boots\" and \"Wasted on You\"—were record-breaking hit songs that pushed Wallen farther into the national conversation. \"7 Summers\" earned him his first top 10 on the Hot 100, debuting and peaking at number six,[34] and was also chosen by Time as one of the best songs of the year.[35] Wallen soon became the first artist to ever chart six songs within the top 10 of Hot Country Songs chart at the same time in the week after his album's release;[36] likewise, the album charted 23 tracks on the Canadian Hot 100,[37] and 19 tracks on the Hot 100 in the US.[38] On February 2, 2021, TMZ released a video recorded on January 31 showing Wallen using the racial slur \"nigger\" to one of his friends after a night out.[39][40] He issued a statement shortly after and apologized.[41] Several radio stations temporarily removed Wallen's music from airplay on their stations, and his songs were removed from Apple Music, Pandora and Spotify featured playlists.[42][43] CMT and the Country Music Association removed Wallen's appearances from their platforms, and his record label Big Loud (and partner Republic Records) suspended its recording contract with him indefinitely.[44][45] The Academy of Country Music announced that Wallen and the album Dangerous: The Double Album would be ineligible for the 56th Annual Academy of Country Music Awards.[46][47] On February 10, Wallen shot an apology video in which he asked his fans not to defend him.[48] In April 2021, Wallen donated $300,000 to the Black Music Action Coalition in the names of 20 people who had counseled him following the incident. Those individuals were given the option to funnel their respective $15,000 donations to a charity of their choice, or keep the money within the BMAC.[49] Wallen publicly spoke of his comments on Good Morning America on July 23, where he said that \"he was around some of his friends, and they say dumb stuff together\" and said that \"he was wrong\" to express those words.[50] Wallen's songs returned to country radio in August when his single \"Sand in My Boots\" was released.[51] He was nominated for Favorite Male Country Artist and Favorite Country Album for the 2021 American Music Awards, but was not invited to attend the ceremony, and was consequently unable to accept any awards if he won, which he did not.[52] Though his public image took a hit, Wallen’s popularity increased.[53] In the week following the controversy, album sales of Dangerous surged. In some cases, the physical as well as digital album sales went up over 100% in the week following the controversy.[54] He remained atop the Billboard charts for seven more weeks; If I Know Me even entered the top 10 for the first time.[55] Over the ensuing years, Dangerous remained a juggernaut; Ben Sisario, writing in The New York Times, dubbed it \"an unusually enduring hit\".[56] It has continued to break chart records:[30] it was the best-performing album of 2021,[57] and in 2022, the album broke the record for the most weeks in the top 10 on the Billboard 200 chart among albums by a singular artist, surpassing a goal set a half-century before.[58] Dangerous was awarded Album of the Year at the Academy of Country Music;[59] Wallen also won Favorite Male Artist and Favorite Album at the inaugural Country Now Awards.[60] Wallen has continued to release new music, and has remained a popular draw on the road. The Dangerous Tour of arenas and amphitheaters was completely sold-out.[57][61] His single \"You Proof\" became his second Hot 100 hit and first to reach the top five; both \"You Proof\" and \"Thought You Should Know\" topped the country charts. Wallen also collaborated with rapper Lil Durk on the song \"Broadway Girls\", a top-15 hit on the Hot 100; he also performed the song live with Durk at MLK Freedom Fest in Nashville.[62] Wallen was a co-writer on the Tyler Joe Miller single \"Wild as Her\", released in February 2022, and the Keith Urban single \"Brown Eyes Baby, released in July 2022.[63][64] In December 2022, Wallen released a sampler EP titled One Thing at a Time, featuring three songs he had been working on up until this point, titled \"One Thing at a Time\", \"Tennessee Fan\" and \"Days That End in Why\".[65] In 2023, Wallen expanded to stadiums with his One Night at a Time World Tour.[66] Wallen released his third studio album One Thing at a Time on March 3, 2023.[67] On April 23, 2023, at Vaught–Hemingway Stadium in Oxford, Mississippi, just minutes before he was set to perform, Wallen announced that he could not perform due to losing his voice. Fans were directed to receive refunds at their points of purchase.[68] In May 2023, Wallen was featured on the song \"Stand by Me\" from Lil Durk's eighth studio album, Almost Healed. Wallen was a co-writer on the 2023 single \"Fixer Upper\" by Dallas Smith.[69][70] On January 26, 2024, Panacea Records released a deluxe 10th anniversary edition of Morgan Wallen's 2015 EP Stand Alone that included eight previously unreleased songs. These songs were recorded in the same sessions as the original Stand Alone songs. Before the release of the 10th anniversary album, Wallen released a statement on his Instagram page saying that the release of this album was happening \"against his wishes\".[71] Wallen released \"Spin You Around (1/24)\", an acoustic re-recording of the original, in response to the album's release.[72] On March 3, 2024, he shared performances as part of his Abbey Road Sessions and performed a new song titled \"Lies Lies Lies\".[73] On May 2, 2024, Wallen announced his next single entitled \"I Had Some Help\" with Post Malone, which was released on May 10.[74] In September 2024, Wallen announced his second single from his upcoming fourth studio album, \"Love Somebody\", which was released on October 18.[75] It debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.[76] Wallen was nominated for seven awards at the 58th Annual Country Music Association Awards, with his only win being the prestigious Entertainer of the Year award. Wallen was not in attendance to accept and the presenter, Jeff Bridges, jokingly accepted on his behalf.[77] In May 2020, Wallen was arrested and charged with public intoxication and disorderly conduct after leaving Kid Rock's bar in Nashville, Tennessee after reportedly kicking glass items inside the bar when he was told to leave, as well as getting into multiple verbal altercations with passersby outside.[78] He turned to Twitter the next day to publicly apologize, writing, \"I went out downtown last night with a few old friends. After a couple bar stops, we were horse-playing with each other. We didn't mean any harm, and we want to say sorry to any bar staff or anyone that was affected. Thank you to the local authorities for being so professional and doing their job with class.\"[79] The case was later settled in a court hearing.[80] In October 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, multiple videos were posted on TikTok showing Wallen ignoring CDC guidelines in bars and other locations in the Tuscaloosa, Alabama, area after attending a University of Alabama football game. Wallen was shown partying maskless, not following social distancing guidelines, and kissing several women in these videos. Wallen was criticized for his conduct, partly as his ex-girlfriend had recently given birth. As a result of his actions, Wallen was cancelled as the musical guest on that week's episode of Saturday Night Live; he ultimately performed in an episode two months later hosted by actor Jason Bateman, in which Bateman, Wallen, and several cast members parody the incident and resulting fallout.[81][82][83][84] On April 7, 2024, Wallen was arrested after allegedly throwing a chair off the roof of Eric Church's newly-opened bar on Broadway in Nashville, Chief's. He was charged with three counts of felony reckless endangerment and one count of misdemeanor disorderly conduct after the projectile landed near two police officers on the ground.[85] Two weeks later, Wallen spoke out about the incident on Twitter, writing, \"I didn't feel right publicly checking in until I made amends with some folks. I've touched base with Nashville law enforcement, my family, and the good people at Chief's. I'm not proud of my behavior, and I accept responsibility. I have the utmost respect for the officers working every day to keep us all safe.\"[86] In December 2024, Wallen pled guilty to two misdemeanor counts of reckless endangerment, with the other two charges being dismissed, and was sentenced to serve seven days in a DUI education center, and two consecutive years of supervised probation.[87] In 2016, Wallen began a relationship with influencer KT Smith, and the couple got engaged several months later.[88][89] In 2019, they separated, allegedly due to Wallen's infidelity, and welcomed a son, Indigo (b. 2020), together several months after their breakup.[90][91][89] Smith is now married to another man.[89] Wallen has also been romantically linked with influencer Paige Lorenze,[92] and fellow country singer Megan Moroney, who allegedly wrote her breakout song \"Tennessee Orange\" about him.[93][94][95] On June 1, 2024, Wallen opened Morgan Wallen's This Bar & Tennessee Kitchen, a six-story bar, restaurant and music venue, in downtown Nashville.[96] Headlining Opening",

                "content": "Red One is a 2024 American Christmas fantasy action adventure comedy film directed by Jake Kasdan and written by Chris Morgan, from an original story by Hiram Garcia. It stars Dwayne Johnson, Chris Evans, Lucy Liu, J. K. Simmons, Kiernan Shipka, Bonnie Hunt, Nick Kroll, Kristofer Hivju, and Wesley Kimmel. In the film, Callum Drift (Johnson), the head of North Pole security, teams up with the hacker Jack O'Malley (Evans) to locate a kidnapped Santa Claus (Simmons) on Christmas Eve. Produced by Amazon MGM Studios, Seven Bucks Productions, Chris Morgan Productions, and The Detective Agency,[7][8] Red One is seen as the first of a Christmas-themed action film franchise. Principal photography for the film began in October 2022 and concluded in February 2023, with filming locations including Atlanta. Red One was first released theatrically by Warner Bros. Pictures internationally on November 6, 2024, and in the United States by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on November 15.[9] The film was a box-office bomb, grossing only $165.9 million worldwide on a budget of $200–$250 million, and has received mostly negative reviews from critics. M.O.R.A (Mythological Oversight and Restoration Authority) is a clandestine, multilateral military organization that oversees and protects a secret peace treaty between mythological creatures and humanity. Callum Drift, commander of ELF (Enforcement Logistics and Fortification), head of Santa Claus's security detail, requests to retire after one last Christmas run, as he has become disillusioned with increased naughty behavior in the world, exemplified by the growth of Santa's Naughty List. On Christmas Eve, a black ops team breaks into the North Pole complex and kidnaps Santa. Callum notifies Director Zoe Harlow about the kidnapping, and her team discovers that the North Pole's secret location was compromised by Jack O'Malley, a mercenary black-hat hacker who claims to be able to find anything in the world. Zoe apprehends Jack for questioning. A longtime Santa skeptic, Jack did not know the information he hacked was related to Santa and merely sent it to an anonymous buyer. Zoe offers to double Jack's payment if he helps them find Santa but places a tracker inside him. Callum reluctantly teams up with Jack to find Santa by tracking the broker who arranged the deal between Jack and the kidnapper in Aruba. The broker tells them the kidnapper is the winter witch, Grýla. Grýla becomes aware of their conversation and sends her snowmen to eliminate them; though Callum and Jack defeat them, the broker is iced in the scuffle. Callum suspects that Grýla might be working with Krampus, Santa's estranged adoptive brother, who is also Grýla's ex-lover and the one who created the Naughty List. Callum and Jack break into Krampus' lair but are captured. Callum appeals to Krampus to help his brother, who misses him, but Krampus refuses. He reveals that Grýla came to him to recover the glaskafig, a magical imprisoning snow globe. Despite being allowed to leave, Jack stays and persuades Krampus to play Krampusschlap with Callum, during which Jack recovers Callum's magic gauntlet and returns it to him, allowing the pair to escape. Grýla and her sons keep Santa in a vault that siphons his magic, knocking him unconscious. Grýla duplicates the glaskafig and intends to rid the world of every naughty child who has ever been on the Naughty List by imprisoning them forever. She tests the snow globes on Jack and his estranged son Dylan. She sends each of them a snow globe that imprisons them and returns to her lair. Jack and Dylan, inside their snow globes next to each other, have a heartfelt conversation that, by making them \"nicer\", causes the snow globes to break and free them. Zoe and Callum find Jack at the North Pole complex after using a tracker inside him. They realize that Grýla, her team, and Santa never left the North Pole. They also learn that Grýla's team of shapeshifters has taken over the complex. They go to the North Pole and free the imprisoned Mrs. Claus and other security staff. In Santa's old workshop, they find Jack and Dylan and the toy-duplicating equipment that Grýla used to mass-produce the snow globes. Because the North Pole equipment relies on Santa's powers, Grýla prepares to leave with an unconscious Santa using his sleigh to distribute the snow globes. A fight ensues, and Grýla is stopped by Callum and Jack, with an assist from Krampus, who arrives to help. Santa recovers and acknowledges his brother, while Grýla is sealed inside one of her snow globes and turned over to Zoe's custody. With Grýla defeated, everyone rapidly prepares for the night's Christmas Eve run. Santa invites Jack and Dylan to accompany him, which they accept. During the successful run, Callum watches Jack regain his wonder and build a relationship with Dylan; this convinces him to not retire. Hiram Garcia at Seven Bucks Productions conceived the idea for the film,[11] which was developed into a screenplay by Chris Morgan for Jake Kasdan to direct.[12] Chris Evans joined the cast in January 2022.[13] In September 2022, Kiernan Shipka was added to the cast.[14] Lucy Liu, Mary Elizabeth Ellis, J. K. Simmons, Nick Kroll, Kristofer Hivju, Wesley Kimmel and Bonnie Hunt joined the cast the following month, with Ellis revealing her and Simmons' involvement on Instagram.[15][16][17][18] Dwayne Johnson was paid $50 million for his involvement.[19] Filming began in October 2022 in Atlanta and wrapped in February 2023.[16][20] Filming ran into issues with Johnson, who was an average of seven to eight hours late to film his scenes and missed several days of shooting. These delays reportedly increased the budget by $50 million to a total of $250 million, which Garcia disputed.[4] Johnson later admitted to frequent tardiness as well as urinating in bottles on set, but Evans and Kasdan defended him.[21][22] Red One was originally scheduled to be released on Prime Video worldwide in time for Christmas 2023.[23] The release was delayed from December 20, 2023, until November 15, 2024, due to the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike, along with the film getting a worldwide theatrical release.[24][25] Johnson pushed for Red One to be released in IMAX after watching an IMAX screening of Oppenheimer while Red One's principal photography was still underway. Johnson thought that Red One in the IMAX format would be \"game over\".[26] Amazon MGM Studios handled the distribution in the United States, while Warner Bros. Pictures handled the film's international release.[27] In the United Kingdom and Ireland, it was released on November 6, 2024.[28] In Latin America, it was released on November 7, 2024.[29] with pre-release advance screenings starting October 31, 2024.[30] Footage of Red One was first shown at CinemaCon in April 2024 to journalists selected by Johnson's publicist, but they were not allowed to write about what they saw.[4] Red One was released on Prime Video on December 12, 2024. As of December 10, 2024[update], Red One has grossed $87.1 million in the United States and Canada, and $78.8 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $165.9 million.[6][5] In the United States and Canada, Red One was projected to gross $30–35 million from 4,032 theaters, with some independent sources predicting a debut as low as $25 million or as high as $40 million.[3][31] The film made $10.9 million on its first day, including $3.7 million from Sunday and Thursday night previews. It went on to debut to $32.1 million, topping the box office.[2] Following the film's weak previews performance, Variety concluded that, \"With a massive budget of $250 million, plus marketing costs, it'll take a Christmas miracle for Red One to become a profitable hit at the box office.\"[32][33] In its second box office weekend, the film dropped 59% to $13.3 million, finishing in third behind newcomers Wicked and Gladiator II.[34] In its third weekend the film made $12.9 million (and a total of $18.7 million over the five day Thanksgiving frame), dropping just 2.5% from the previous weekend and finishing in fourth behind Gladiator ll, Wicked and Moana 2.[35] On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 31% of 163 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 4.4/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Wrapped in slick packaging but wholly lacking in holiday magic, Red One is a ho-ho-hum action-adventure.\"[36] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 34 out of 100, based on 35 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable\" reviews.[37] Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A–\" on an A+ to F scale, while those polled by PostTrak gave it a 78% overall positive score, with 57% saying they would definitely recommend it.[2] Peter Bradshaw, writing for The Guardian, gave the film one star out of five, describing it as \"profoundly depressing and blandly sentimental\" and concluding \"this commercial and formulaic slice of content is a toy destined to be forgotten, not by Boxing Day, but mid-November.\"[38] Glenn Garner of Deadline Hollywood said the film \"blends genres for some family-friendly holiday fun with a generous dose of self-aware absurdity\" and wrote: \"Yes, it's cheesy, but this movie is best when it leans heavily into the cheese. If that makes your eyes roll, keep in mind this is a Christmas movie ultimately intended for kids who've made it all the way through the MCU on Disney+ twice and their parents now need a reprieve. There are still some jokes aimed at the cold-hearted adult who will inevitably be dragged along on the family cinema outing.\"[39]",

Rookie running back Isaac Guerendo is expected to play through a foot sprain tonight against the Los Angeles Rams, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter. Guerendo is the 49ers' third starting running back of the season -- Christian McCaffrey and Jordan Mason both are on Injured Reserve. So the 49ers need Guerendo tonight to have any chance to win. Guerendo made his first career start last week against the Bears, and had 128 yards from scrimmage and two touchdowns. He was terrific, both as a runner and as a receiver. But in the fourth quarter when the 49ers were up big, Mason sprained his foot, left the game and did not return. That was just a few days ago. Now, Guerendo says his foot is \"fine.\" What else is he supposed to say? The 49ers' season is on the line tonight and they need him to play even if he's not 100 percent healthy, which he probably isn't. So he's playing. But can he cut on his sprained foot? Is he still as fast as he usually is? We'll find out. His backup will be Patrick Taylor Jr., is a tough, solid inside runner, but he's not the home run threat or the receiver Guerendo is. Another option is Deebo Samuel, who was a good running back in the past. This season, he's averaging just 2.9 yards per carry, which means he has become one of the worst running backs in the league.

Nearly every notable name on the offense has missed time at some point this season. The two most significant injuries were Brandon Aiyuk and Christian McCaffrey, who combined to appear in just 11 games and did not share the field for a single snap all year. The position group that has been hit the hardest has undoubtedly been running back. Starter Christian McCaffrey (knee) is amid his second IR stint, and his backup, Jordan Mason, is also on IR with a high-ankle sprain. With their top two options sidelined, the expectation was that rookie Isaac Guerendo would lead the backfield for the remainder of the regular season. Well, Guerendo suffered an injury of his own last week and is in danger of missing a Thursday night matchup with the Rams. WEEK 15 FANTASY FOOTBALL RANKINGSQBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | D/ST | Kickers After spraining his foot last week, Guerendo has been labeled as day-to-day. After not practicing to open the week, he was upgraded to limited participation during Wednesday's practice. Following his spotty participation, the team has listed Gurendo as \"questionable\" for Thursday's game. 49ers ruled out LT Trent Williams (ankle) and S Malik Mustapha (chest, shoulder) for Thursday night’s game vs. the Rams.DE Nick Bosa (hip, oblique), RB Isaac Guerendo (foot) and LB Dre Greenlaw (Achilles) are listed as questionable. Considering Guerendo has not practiced in full at any point this week, it's truly a toss-up as to whether he'll be able to suit up. There's a decent chance his status is unknown until inactives are due 90 minutes before kickoff. Guerendo continues to maintain that he is going to play. He has been listed as questionable and will test his injury during pre-game warm-ups, but the notion in the morning is that the running back will play. With the fantasy football playoffs starting tonight:49ers rookie RB Isaac Guerendo plans to play Thursday night vs. the Rams despite his sprained foot that has left him being listed as questionable, per sources. Guerendo insists he “feels good.” pic.twitter.com/WClJ52lva3 Check back here often, as we'll be providing updates on Guerendo's status as they become available. Considering Guerendo is the RB3 in San Francisco, they'll be reaching deep down the depth chart if he's unable to play. When Guerendo left late in the game last week, the coaching staff turned to Patrick Taylor to close out the game. He'd likely function as the lead back in Guerendo's absence. If Guerendo is unable to play, don't be surprised if one (or both) of Ke'Shawn Vaughn or Israel Abanikanda mix in with Taylor to some degree. Both are relatively new to the team, but they could be used to spell Taylor throughout the game. Week 15 FANTASY FOOTBALL ROSTER MANAGEMENTLessons Learned | Stock Watch | Sleepers | Busts | Start 'Em, Sit 'Em | Usage Report Gurendo acted as a bell cow last week, ceding just one carry to Patrick Taylor before getting hurt, and he was incredibly effective in this role. Unsurprisingly, a running back with size (6-0, 221 pounds) and speed (4.33 40-yard dash) performed well in Kyle Shanahan's offense. The rookie finished with 26.8 PPR points on 17 touches and was set up to be a true league winner. Assuming Guerendo is able to play, he may be limited in some capacity, but he's well worth the start. His fantasy value as the 49ers' lead back was cemented last week. Otherwise, Patrick Taylor becomes a terrific spot start if Guerendo can't take the field. If you didn't pick up Taylor on waivers, be sure to consult the Sporting News' RB rankings and sleepers to find a worthwhile replacement for Guerendo.

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Guerendo (foot) remains listed as questionable for Thursday's game against the Rams but insists he \"feels good\" and plans to play, sources tell Adam Schefter of ESPN. After Christian McCaffrey (knee) and Jordan Mason (ankle) were moved to injured reserve last week, Guerendo stepped in as the 49ers' starting running back in this past Sunday's 38-13 win over the Bears. He turned in a big performance, rushing 15 times for 78 yards and two scores while chipping in two catches for 50 yards before exiting late in the contest with a sprained foot. The 49ers listed Guerendo as a non-participant on injury reports released Monday and Tuesday, but after upgrading to limited activity in Wednesday's walk-through session, the rookie looks like he could be tracking toward playing against the Rams. Official word on Guerendo's status will come when the 49ers release their inactive list 90 minutes before Thursday's 8:15 p.m. ET kickoff, but even if he's cleared to play, the 49ers could aim to limit his workload on a short week. Patrick Taylor and Israel Abanikanda are already on the roster as backup options behind Guerendo, and the 49ers could also elevate Ke'Shawn Vaughn from the practice squad to provide another healthy body out of the backfield. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive.

                "content": "The White House 1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW Washington, DC 20500 Today, I signed a pardon for my son Hunter. From the day I took office, I said I would not interfere with the Justice Department’s decision-making, and I kept my word even as I have watched my son being selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted. Without aggravating factors like use in a crime, multiple purchases, or buying a weapon as a straw purchaser, people are almost never brought to trial on felony charges solely for how they filled out a gun form. Those who were late paying their taxes because of serious addictions, but paid them back subsequently with interest and penalties, are typically given non-criminal resolutions. It is clear that Hunter was treated differently. The charges in his cases came about only after several of my political opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose my election. Then, a carefully negotiated plea deal, agreed to by the Department of Justice, unraveled in the court room – with a number of my political opponents in Congress taking credit for bringing political pressure on the process. Had the plea deal held, it would have been a fair, reasonable resolution of Hunter’s cases. No reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter’s cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son – and that is wrong. There has been an effort to break Hunter – who has been five and a half years sober, even in the face of unrelenting attacks and selective prosecution. In trying to break Hunter, they’ve tried to break me – and there’s no reason to believe it will stop here. Enough is enough. For my entire career I have followed a simple principle: just tell the American people the truth. They’ll be fair-minded. Here’s the truth: I believe in the justice system, but as I have wrestled with this, I also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice – and once I made this decision this weekend, there was no sense in delaying it further. I hope Americans will understand why a father and a President would come to this decision. ### Executive Grant of ClemencyJoseph R. Biden, Jr.President of the United States of America To All to Whom These Presents Shall Come, Greeting: Be It Known, That This Day, I, Joseph R. Biden, Jr., President of the United States, Pursuant to My Powers Under Article II, Section 2, Clause 1, of the Constitution, Have Granted Unto ROBERT HUNTER BIDEN A Full and Unconditional Pardon For those offenses against the United States which he has committed or may have committed or taken part in during the period from January 1, 2014 through December 1, 2024, including but not limited to all offenses charged or prosecuted (including any that have resulted in convictions) by Special Counsel David C.

The amnesty will be extended to roughly 1,500 people who were placed on home confinement during the COVID pandemic and 39 others who were convicted of nonviolent crimes, especially drug crimes, who have \"shown successful rehabilitation,\" according to a White House press release. Biden said in the statement he would \"take more steps in the weeks ahead\" and continue to review clemency petitions to advance \"equal justice under the law, promote public safety, support rehabilitation and reentry, and provide meaningful second chances.\" The White House said the pardoned individuals include a decorated military veteran, a nurse who helped spearhead vaccination efforts during the COVID-19 pandemic and an addiction counselor who volunteers to help young people. The actions come less than two weeks after Biden pardoned his son, Hunter, for gun and tax felonies, igniting bipartisan backlash. Pardons, explained: What is a presidential pardon?

                "content": "The White House 1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW Washington, DC 20500 Today’s announcement will commute the sentences of close to 1,500 individuals who were placed on home confinement and will pardon 39 individuals convicted of non-violent crimes Today, President Biden announced that he is granting clemency to nearly 1,500 Americans – the most ever in a single day – who have shown successful rehabilitation and a strong commitment to making their communities safer. The President is commuting the sentences of close to 1,500 individuals who were placed on home confinement during the COVID-19 pandemic and who have successfully reintegrated into their families and communities. He is also pardoning 39 individuals who were convicted of non-violent crimes. These actions represent the largest single-day grant of clemency in modern history. Together, these actions build on the President’s record of criminal justice reform to help reunite families, strengthen communities, and reintegrate individuals back into society. The President has issued more sentence commutations at this point in his presidency than any of his recent predecessors at the same point in their first terms. He is also the first President ever to issue categorical pardons to individuals convicted of simple use and possession of marijuana, and to former LGBTQI+ service members convicted of private conduct because of their sexual orientation. In the coming weeks, the President will take additional steps to provide meaningful second chances and continue to review additional pardons and commutations. Americans receiving relief today include: As the President has said, the United States is a nation of second chances. The President recognizes how the clemency power can advance equal justice under law and remedy harms caused by practices of the past. The nearly 1,500 individuals who received commutations today have been serving their sentences at home for at least one year under the COVID-era CARES Act. These Americans have been reunited with their families and shown their commitment to rehabilitation by securing employment and advancing their education. The 39 individuals receiving pardons today were convicted of non-violent crimes, including drug offenses, and have turned their lives around. These individuals are parents, veterans, health care professionals, teachers, advocates, and engaged members of their communities. Many of them have used their experiences in the criminal justice system to inspire and encourage others. Individual Clemency Actions Throughout the Biden-Harris Administration The President is intent on granting clemency to individuals convicted of non-violent crimes who were sentenced under outdated laws, policies, and practices that left them with longer sentences than if the individuals were sentenced today. To address these injustices, President Biden has taken several bold clemency actions throughout his Administration, including: These individual actions have helped to transform these individuals’ lives and positively impact their communities. Federal convictions make it difficult to secure housing, jobs, educational opportunities, benefits, and health care; all essential to living a healthy and productive life. Through his use of the clemency power, President Biden has taken steps to unlock doors of opportunity that would have otherwise remained closed to these recipients, who deserve a second chance. Categorical Clemency Actions throughout the Biden-Harris Administration In addition to these individual clemency actions, President Biden has issued a number of categorical pardons to certain groups of people. The President has used categorical clemency more than any of his predecessors, which has allowed him to widely and systemically respond to historic injustices. His bold and unprecedented categorical actions, broadly outlined below, include the following: The President’s categorical approach to clemency has also inspired leaders across the country to take similar action. Over ten states and localities, including Maryland and Massachusetts, have issued categorical clemency for marijuana convictions, impacting hundreds of thousands of people and allowing individuals to move past their convictions and move on with their daily lives. While today’s announcement marks important progress, there is more to come. President Biden will continue to review clemency petitions and deliver criminal justice reform in a manner that advances equity and justice, promotes public safety, supports rehabilitation and reentry, and provides meaningful second chances. ### We'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.

                "title": "No good deed goes unpunished - Wikipedia",
                "content": "The phrase \"No good deed goes unpunished\" is a sardonic commentary on the frequency with which acts of kindness backfire on those who offer them. In other words, those who help others are doomed to suffer as a result of their helpfulness. The phrase is first attested in Walter Map's 12th-century De nugis curialium, in whose fourth chapter the character Eudo adhered to inverted morality \"left no good deed unpunished, no bad one unrewarded\".[1][2] Conventional moral wisdom holds that evil deeds are punished by divine providence and good deeds are rewarded by divine providence:[1] For as punishment is to the evil act, so is reward to a good act. Now no evil deed is unpunished, by God the just judge. Therefore no good deed is unrewarded, and so every good deed merits some good.[a] This is related to the concepts of Hell and of karma. The modern expression \"No good deed goes unpunished\" is an ironic twist on this conventional morality.[1] The ironic usage of the phrase appears to be[weasel words] a 20th-century invention, found for example in Brendan Gill's 1950 novel The Trouble of One House.[3] It is also featured prominently in the song \"No Good Deed\", from the 2003 hit Broadway musical Wicked.[4] A satirical poem by Franklin Pierce Adams with the title \"No Good Deed Goes Unpunished (So Shines a Good Deed in a Naughty World)\" also exists.[5] In 2005, author David Helvarg introduced the concept that the punishment may be a form of retaliation, in a piece he wrote for Grist Magazine, \"Remember that sign they hung up in an EPA office during the Reagan administration, 'No good deed goes unpunished'? Under George Bush, no good science goes unpunished.\"[6]",

I am sure that most of you have heard the old phrase, “No good deed goes unpunished.” You also know by now that Ol’ Dutch likes to include some background of the origin of such phrases here so that you, my readers, will have some intellectual-sounding fodder to bring up at the next social meeting you attend. So, I went to the source for everything, aka The Internet, and there seems to be some schism about who came up with such wisdom. One source swears up and down it was first attributed to old Walter Map's 12th-century De nugis curialium where a character is said to have, \"left no good deed unpunished, no bad one unrewarded\". But another search engine attests the phrase to one Oscar Wilde, a famous Irish poet and playwright born way back in 1854. Miss Trixie upon hearing his birthdate thought it pertinent to ask Ol’ Dutch if he knew old Oscar since she thinks I may be older than dirt after my last birthday. Moving on, O.W. did say \"no good deed goes unpunished\" in its purest form so we will chalk one up for the Irish and let him have the credit this time. What it means is whenever a person does a good deed for someone just out of the abundance of their heart let us say, somehow the doer many times gets the short end of the deal. Take for instance one of your friends gets stranded in a broken-down car. You put on your Good Samaritan shirt and shoes, rush out there, spend all day helping them tow them to town. And that is all well and good but what can happen is while you are out there a truck goes by and dumps a whole passel of nails on the road and you end up ruining four tires. Now this does not mean you should curtail your good deeds as they may help you get in the Pearly Gates, if you are short on good conduct credits. So, Ol’ Dutch found himself in the perfect spot – so I thought — to help some poor soul along life's highway last Sunday. Having shuttled some fishermen up the river, I decided that it was time for me to wet a line and went up to an area lake to fly fish the stream coming into it. I was doing good just minding my own business – which I should have kept doing – when two young boys began trying to fly fish beside me. It was a pathetic display of whipping and pounding the water and Ol’ Dutch decided to teach them a few things about casting a fly. They were overjoyed to learn how to throw and soon I had them tossing loop after loop across the stream. And Ol’ Dutch was feeling prouder than a peacock in Spring until I stepped back and fell into a hidden beaver den. Down I went sloshing and thrashing into the cold morass and looking to the boys for a hand up, but all I saw were four eyes staring back at this old man in total disbelief at what they were seeing. I did finally extract myself from the watery grave but not before filling both boots, all my pockets and my wallet with ice cold rocky mountain spring water. I do have to admit I laughed all the way back to the truck at the sight I must have been as I went down like a trap door had been pulled out from underneath me. It was the first time I have fallen in probably in 10 years, so I still feel pretty good about that, albeit a tad soggy. Last week was not all bad, as I was able to assist in the rescue of a woman from the river as my good deed and that deed had no bad payback. So, I guess I will keep trying to help others. My mother always told us that when you do a good turn for someone that God will repay you and so far, she has been right. And when you take that attitude then you never have to feel as though you got shorted in any situation. So, get out there this week and help a friend, neighbor, and if you are Godly enough, help an enemy. God keeps score, you can bet on that and who better to reward you for your deeds than Him.

A venerated image on a cloak (tilmahtli) associated with the apparition is enshrined in the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico City. Pope Leo XIII granted the image a decree of canonical coronation on February 8, 1887, and it was pontifically crowned on October 12, 1895. The basilica is the most-visited Catholic shrine in the world, and the world's third most-visited sacred site.[2][3] According to the Nican Mopohua, included in the 17th-century Huei tlamahuiçoltica, written in Nahuatl, the Virgin Mary appeared four times to Juan Diego, a Chichimec peasant, and once to his uncle, Juan Bernardino. The first apparition occurred on the morning of Saturday, December 9, 1531 (Julian calendar, which is December 19 on the (proleptic) Gregorian calendar in present use). Juan Diego experienced a vision of a young woman at a place called the Hill of Tepeyac, which later became part of Villa de Guadalupe, in a suburb of Mexico City.[4] According to the accounts, the woman, speaking to Juan Diego in Nahuatl, his first language and the language of the former Aztec Empire, identified herself as the Mary, \"mother of the very true deity\".[5] She was said to have asked for a church to be erected at that site in her honor.[4] Based on her words, Juan Diego then sought the Archbishop of Mexico City, Juan de Zumárraga, to tell him what had happened. Not unexpectedly, the Archbishop did not believe Diego. Later the same day, Juan Diego saw the young woman again (the second apparition), and she asked him to continue insisting.[4] The next day, Sunday, December 10, 1531, in the Julian calendar, Juan Diego spoke to the Archbishop a second time. The latter instructed him to return to Tepeyac and to ask the woman for a truly acceptable, miraculous sign to prove her identity. Later that day, the third apparition appeared when Juan Diego returned to Tepeyac; encountering the same woman, he reported to her the Archbishop's request for a sign, which she consented to provide on the next day (December 11).[6] On Monday, December 11, however, Juan Diego’s uncle fell ill and he was obliged to attend to him. In the early hours of Tuesday, December 12, as Juan Bernardino's condition deteriorated, Juan Diego journeyed to Tlatelolco in search of a Catholic priest to hear Juan Bernardino's confession and help minister to him on his deathbed.[4] To avoid being delayed by the Virgin and ashamed at having failed to meet her on Monday as agreed, Juan Diego chose another route around Tepeyac Hill, yet the Virgin intercepted him and asked where he was going (fourth apparition); Juan Diego explained what had happened and the Virgin gently chided him for not having made recourse to her. In the words which have become the most famous phrase of the Guadalupe apparitions and are inscribed above the main entrance to the Basilica of Guadalupe, she asked \"¿No estoy yo aquí que soy tu madre?\" (\"Am I not here, I who am your mother?\"). She assured him that Juan Bernardino had now recovered and told him to gather flowers from the summit of Tepeyac Hill, which was normally barren, especially in the cold of December. Juan Diego obeyed her instruction and he found Castilian roses, not native to Mexico, blooming there.[4] According to the story, the Virgin arranged the flowers in Juan Diego's tilmàtli or cloak, and when Juan Diego opened his cloak later that day before Archbishop Zumárraga, the flowers fell to the floor, revealing on the fabric the image of the Virgin.[4] The next day, December 13, Juan Diego found his uncle fully recovered as the Virgin had assured him, and Juan Bernardino recounted that he also had seen her after praying at his bedside (fifth apparition); that she had instructed him to inform the Archbishop of this apparition and of his miraculous cure; and that she had told him she desired to be known under the title of \"Guadalupe\".[4] The Archbishop kept Juan Diego's mantle, first in his private chapel and then in the church on public display, where it attracted great attention. On December 26, 1531, a procession formed to transfer the miraculous image back to Tepeyac Hill where it was installed in a small, hastily erected chapel.[7] During this procession, the first miracle was allegedly performed when a native was mortally wounded in the neck by an arrow shot by accident during some stylized martial displays performed in honor of the Virgin. In great distress, the natives carried him before the Virgin's image and pleaded for his life. Upon the arrow being withdrawn, the victim fully and immediately recovered.[8] The shrine to Our Lady of Guadalupe in Guadalupe, Cáceres, in Extremadura, Spain, was the most important of the shrines to the Virgin Mary in the medieval Kingdom of Castile.[9] It is one of the many Black Madonnas in Spain and is revered in the Monastery of Santa María de Guadalupe, in the town of Guadalupe, from which numerous Spanish conquistadors stem. The most popular etymology of the name \"Guadalupe\" is from the Arabic \"Wadi\" (river) and the Latin word \"lupus\" (wolf). Some find it unlikely that Arabic and Latin would be combined in this way, and suggest as an alternative the Arabic \"Wadi-al-lub\", signifying a river with black stones in its bed.[10] The shrine houses a statue reputed to have been carved by Luke the Evangelist and given to Archbishop Leander of Seville by Pope Gregory I. According to local legend, when Seville was taken by the Moors in 712, a group of priests fled northward and buried the statue in the hills near the Guadalupe River.[11] At the beginning of the 14th century, the Virgin appeared one day to a humble cowboy named Gil Cordero who was searching for a missing animal in the mountains.[12] Cordero claimed that Mary had appeared to him and ordered him to ask priests to dig at the site of the apparition. Excavating priests rediscovered the hidden statue and built a small shrine around it which became the great Guadalupe monastery.[11] Following the Conquest in 1519–1521, the Marian cult was brought to the Americas and Franciscan friars often leveraged syncretism with existing religious beliefs as an instrument for evangelization. What is purported by some to be the earliest mention of the miraculous apparition of the Virgin is a page of parchment, the Codex Escalada from 1548, which was discovered in 1995 and, according to investigative analysis, dates from the sixteenth century.[13] This document bears two pictorial representations of Juan Diego and the apparition, several inscriptions in Nahuatl referring to Juan Diego by his Aztec name, and the date of his death: 1548, as well as the year that the then named Virgin Mary appeared: 1531. It also contains the glyph of Antonio Valeriano; and finally, the signature of Fray Bernardino de Sahagun which was authenticated by experts from the Banco de Mexico and Charles E. Dibble.[14] Historians Alberto Peralta and Stafford Poole questioned the authenticity of the document.[15][16] A more complete early description of the apparition occurs in a 16-page manuscript called the Nican mopohua, which has been reliably dated in 1556 and was acquired by the New York Public Library in 1880. This document, written in Nahuatl, tells the story of the apparitions and the supernatural origin of the image. It was probably composed by a native Aztec man, Antonio Valeriano, who had been educated by Franciscans. The text of this document was later incorporated into a printed pamphlet which was widely circulated in 1649.[17][18][19][20] In spite of these documents, there are no known 16th century written accounts of the Guadalupe vision by the archbishop Juan de Zumárraga.[21] In particular, the canonical account of the vision features archbishop Juan de Zumárraga as a major player in the story, but, although Zumárraga was a prolific writer, there is nothing in his extant writings that can confirm the indigenous story.[22] The written record suggests the Catholic clergy in 16th century Mexico were deeply divided as to the orthodoxy of the native beliefs springing up around the image of Our Lady of Guadalupe, with the Franciscan order (who then had custody of the chapel at Tepeyac) being strongly opposed to the outside groups, while the Dominicans supported it.[23] The main promoter of the story was the Dominican Alonso de Montúfar, who succeeded the Franciscan Juan de Zumárraga as archbishop of Mexico. In a 1556 sermon Montúfar commended popular devotion to \"Our Lady of Guadalupe\", referring to a painting on cloth (the tilma) in the chapel of the Virgin Mary at Tepeyac, where certain miracles had also occurred. Days later, Fray Francisco de Bustamante, local head of the Franciscan order, delivered a sermon denouncing the native belief and believers. He expressed concern that the Catholic Archbishop was promoting a superstitious regard for an indigenous image:[24] The devotion at the chapel... to which they have given the name Guadalupe was prejudicial to the Indians because they believed that the image itself worked miracles, contrary to what the missionary friars had been teaching them, and because many were disappointed when it did not. Archbishop Montúfar opened an inquiry into the matter at which the Franciscans repeated their position that the image encouraged idolatry and superstition, and four witnesses testified to Bustamante's statement that the image was painted by an Indian, with one witness naming him \"the Indian painter Marcos\".[25] This could refer to the Aztec painter Marcos Cipac de Aquino, who was active at that time.[26][27] Prof. Jody Brant Smith, referring to Philip Serna Callahan's examination of the tilma using infrared photography in 1979, wrote: \"if Marcos did, he apparently did so without making a preliminary sketches – in itself then seen as a near-miraculous procedure... Cipac may well have had a hand in painting the Image, but only in painting the additions, such as the angel and moon at the Virgin's feet.\"[28] Ultimately Archbishop Montúfar, himself a Dominican, decided to end Franciscan custody of the shrine.[29] From then on the shrine was kept and served by diocesan priests under the authority of the archbishop.[30] Moreover, Archbishop Montúfar authorized the construction of a much larger church at Tepeyac, in which the tilma was later mounted and displayed.[31] In the late 1570s, the Franciscan historian Bernardino de Sahagún denounced the cult at Tepeyac and the use of the name \"Tonantzin\" or to call her Our Lady in a personal digression in his General History of the Things of New Spain, also known as the \"Florentine Codex\": At this place [Tepeyac], [the Indians] had a temple dedicated to the mother of the gods, whom they called Tonantzin, which means Our Mother. There they performed many sacrifices in honor of this goddess ... And now that a church of Our Lady of Guadalupe is built there, they also called her Tonantzin, being motivated by those preachers who called Our Lady, the Mother of God, Tonantzin. While it is not known for certain where the beginning of Tonantzin may have originated, but this we know for certain, that, from its first usage, the word refers to the ancient Tonantzin. And it was viewed as something that should be remedied, for their having [native] name of the Mother of God, Holy Mary, instead of Tonantzin, but Dios inantzin. It appears to be a Satanic invention to cloak idolatry under the confusion of this name, Tonantzin. And they now come to visit from very far away, as far away as before, which is also suspicious, because everywhere there are many churches of Our Lady and they do not go to them. They come from distant lands to this Tonantzin as in olden times.[32] Sahagún's criticism of the indigenous group seems to have stemmed primarily from his concern about a syncretistic application of the native name Tonantzin to the Catholic Virgin Mary. However, Sahagún often used the same name in his sermons as late as the 1560s.[33] One of the first printed accounts of the history of the apparitions and image occurs in Imagen de la Virgen Maria, Madre de Dios de Guadalupe, published in 1648 by Miguel Sánchez, a diocesan priest of Mexico City.[34] Another account is the Codex Escalada, dating from the sixteenth century, a sheet of parchment recording apparitions of the Virgin Mary and the figure of Juan Diego, which reproduces the glyph of Antonio Valeriano alongside the signature of Fray Bernardino de Sahagún. It contains the following glosses: \"1548 Also in that year of 1531 appeared to Cuahtlatoatzin our beloved mother the Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico. Cuahtlatoatzin died worthily\"[35] The next printed account was a 36-page tract in the Nahuatl language, Huei tlamahuiçoltica (\"The Great Event\"), which was published in 1649. This tract contains a section called the Nican mopohua (\"Here it is recounted\"), which has been already touched on above. The composition and authorship of the Huei tlamahuiçoltica is assigned by a majority of those scholars to Luis Laso de la Vega, vicar of the sanctuary of Tepeyac from 1647 to 1657.[36] Nevertheless, the most important section of the tract, the Nican Mopohua, appears to be much older. It has been attributed since the late 1600s to Antonio Valeriano (c. 1531–1605), a native Aztec man who had been educated by the Franciscans and who collaborated extensively with Bernardino de Sahagún.[17] A manuscript version of the Nican Mopohua, which is now held by the New York Public Library,[37] appears to be dated to c. 1556, and may have been the original work by Valeriano, as that was used by Laso in composing the Huei tlamahuiçoltica. Most authorities agree on the dating and on Valeriano's authorship.[18][19][20] On the other hand, in 1666, the scholar Luis Becerra Tanco published in Mexico a book about the history of the apparitions under the name Origen milagroso del santuario de Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe, which was republished in Spain in 1675 as Felicidad de Mexico.[38] In the same way, in 1688, Jesuit Father Francisco de Florencia published La Estrella del Norte de México, giving the history of the same apparitions.[39] Two separate accounts, one in Nahuatl from Juan Bautista del Barrio de San Juan from the 16th century,[40] and the other in Spanish by Servando Teresa de Mier[41] date the original apparition and native celebration on September 8 of the Julian calendar, but the latter also says that the Spaniards celebrate it on December 12 instead.[42] According to the document Informaciones Jurídicas de 1666, a Catholic feast day in name of Our Lady of Guadalupe was requested and approved, as well as the transfer of the date of the feast of the Virgin of Guadalupe from September 8 to December 12, the latest date on which the Virgin supposedly appeared to Juan Diego. The initiative to perform them was made by Francisco de Siles who proposed to ask the Church of Rome, a Mass itself with allusive text to the apparitions and stamping of the image, along with the divine office itself, and the precept of hearing a Catholic Mass on December 12, the last date of the apparitions of the Virgin to Juan Diego as the new date to commemorate the apparitions (which until then was on September 8, the birth of the Virgin).[43] In 1666, the Church in México began gathering information from people who reported having known Juan Diego, and in 1723 a formal investigation into his life was ordered, where more data was gathered to support his veneration. Because of the Informaciones Jurídicas de 1666 in the year 1754, the Sacred Congregation of Rites confirmed the true and valid value of the apparitions, and granted celebrating Mass and Office for the then Catholic version of the feast of Guadalupe on December 12.[44][45] These published accounts of the origin of the image already venerated in Tepeyac, then increased interest in the identity of Juan Diego, who was the original recipient of the prime vision. A new Catholic Basilica church was built to house the image. Completed in 1709, it is now known as the Old Basilica.[46] The image[which?] had originally featured a 12-point crown on the Virgin's head, but this disappeared in 1887–88. The change was first noticed on February 23, 1888, when the image was removed to a nearby church.[48] Eventually a painter confessed on his deathbed that he had been instructed by a clergyman to remove the crown. This may have been motivated by the fact that the gold paint was flaking off of the crown, leaving it looking dilapidated. But according to the historian David Brading, \"the decision to remove rather than replace the crown was no doubt inspired by a desire to 'modernize' the image and reinforce its similarity to the nineteenth-century images of the Immaculate Conception which were exhibited at Lourdes and elsewhere... What is rarely mentioned is that the frame which surrounded the canvas was adjusted to leave almost no space above the Virgin's head, thereby obscuring the effects of the erasure.\"[49] A different crown was installed to the image. On February 8, 1887, a Papal bull from Pope Leo XIII granted permission a Canonical Coronation of the image, which occurred on October 12, 1895.[50] Since then the Virgin of Guadalupe has been proclaimed \"Queen of Mexico\", \"Patroness of the Americas\", \"Empress of Latin America\", and \"Protectress of Unborn Children\" (the latter two titles given by Pope John Paul II in 1999).[51][52] On November 14, 1921, a bomb hidden within a basket of flowers and left under the tilma by an anti-Catholic secularist exploded and damaged the altar of the Basilica that houses the original image, but the tilma was unharmed. A brass standing crucifix, bent by the explosion, is now preserved at the shrine's museum and is believed to be miraculous by devotees.[53][54] Under Pope John Paul II the move to beatify Juan Diego intensified. John Paul II took a special interest in non-European Catholics and saints. During his leadership, the Congregation for the Causes of Saints declared Juan Diego \"venerable\" (in 1987), and the pope himself announced his beatification on May 6, 1990, during a Mass at the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico City, declaring him \"protector and advocate of the indigenous peoples\", with December 9 established as his feast day.[55] At that time historians revived doubts as to the quality of the evidence regarding Juan Diego. The writings of bishop Zumárraga, into whose hands Juan purportedly delivered the miraculous image, did not refer to him or the event. The record of the 1556 ecclesiastical inquiry omitted him, and he was not mentioned in documentation before the mid-17th century. In 1996 the 83-year-old abbot of the Basilica of Guadalupe, Guillermo Schulenburg, was forced to resign following an interview published in the Catholic magazine Ixthus, in which he was quoted as saying that Juan Diego was \"a symbol, not a reality\", and that his canonization would be the \"recognition of a cult. It is not recognition of the physical, real existence of a person.\"[56] In 1883 Joaquín García Icazbalceta, historian and biographer of Zumárraga, in a confidential report on the Lady of Guadalupe for Bishop Labastida, had been hesitant to support the story of the vision. He concluded that Juan Diego had not existed.[57] In 1995, Father Xavier Escalada, a Jesuit whose four volume Guadalupe encyclopedia had just been published, announced the existence of a sheet of parchment (known as Codex Escalada), which bore an illustrated account of the vision and some notations in Nahuatl concerning the life and death of Juan Diego. Previously unknown, the document was dated 1548. It bore the signatures of Antonio Valeriano and Bernardino de Sahagún, which are considered to verify its contents. The codex was the subject of an appendix to the Guadalupe encyclopedia, published in 1997.[15][pages needed][58] Some scholars remained unconvinced, one describing the discovery of the Codex as \"rather like finding a picture of St. Paul's vision of Christ on the road to Damascus, drawn by St. Luke and signed by St. Peter.\"[59] Skeptics, both from within the Catholic Church[60] as well as outside it, have doubted the historical veracity of the account of the Lady of Guadalupe, and it has been said[61] that \"[a]lmost every aspect of the story of Juan Diego has been called into question\". In particular, there is no contemporary documentary evidence for the apparition.[62] The main source, the Huei tlamahuiçoltica, was published in 1649; its time of writing is not known with certainty, but a formal inquiry into the image of Guadalupe was made in 1556 and does not mention the legend or its central character Juan Diego.[63] This has been cited in support of the claim that the Huei tlamahuiçoltica and the legend it narrates date to after that time.[64] The report of the 1556 investigation stated that the image had been painted by a native artist the previous year,[65][66] which would directly contradict the hypothesis of a supernatural origin in 1531. In the earliest account of the apparition, the Nican Mopohua, the Virgin de Guadalupe, later called as if the Virgin Mary tells Juan Bernardino, the uncle of Juan Diego, that the image left on the tilma is to be known by the name \"the Perfect Virgin, Holy Mary of Guadalupe\".[67] There have been various efforts to find a pre-Hispanic origin in the cult, including attempts to find a Nahuatl etymology to the name. The first theory to promote this Nahuatl origin was that of Luis Becerra Tanco.[68] In his 1675 work Felicidad de Mexico, Becerra Tanco said that Juan Bernardino and Juan Diego would not have been able to understand the name Guadalupe because the \"d\" and \"g\" sounds do not exist in Nahuatl.[68] He proposed two Nahuatl alternative names that sound similar to \"Guadalupe\", Tecuatlanopeuh [tekʷat͡ɬaˈnopeʍ], which he translates as \"she whose origins were in the rocky summit\", and Tecuantlaxopeuh [tekʷant͡ɬaˈʃopeʍ], \"she who banishes those who devoured us.\"[68] Ondina and Justo González suggest that the name is a Spanish version of the Nahuatl term, Coātlaxopeuh [koaːt͡ɬaˈʃopeʍ], which they interpret as meaning \"the one who crushes the serpent\", and that it may seem to be referring to the feathered serpent Quetzalcoatl. In addition, the Virgin Mary was portrayed in European art as crushing the serpent of the Garden of Eden.[69] Sahagún claimed that the Aztecs had previously worshiped the goddess Tonantzin (sometimes identified with Coatlícue or Cihuacoatl) at Tepeyac. He believed that the shrine to Our Lady of Guadalupe allowed them to continue their worship of Tonantzin, since they neglected other Marian shrines to come to Tepeyac.[70] The theory promoting the Spanish origin of the name says that: The image of Our Lady of Guadalupe is of a life-sized, dark-haired, olive-skinned young woman, standing with her head slightly inclined to her right, eyes downcast, and her hands held before her in prayer. She wears a pink dress ornamented with a floral design, a dark ribbon tied above her waist, and a blue-green mantle over all. The mantle is edged with gold and has golden stars throughout. She stands on a crescent moon, which is supported by an angel with eagle wings. She is surrounded by a golden sunburst.[71][72][73] The tilma now measures approximately 1.72 meters by 1.07 meters,[74] though sources vary by a few centimeters, and it shows signs of having been trimmed from the original size. It is made of two pieces of fabric sewn together with cotton thread.[75] There is a large crack running vertically through the middle of the image, as well as smaller horizontal cracks, caused by the image being folded at some point.[76] The image is currently housed in a golden frame above the main altar of the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico City, where it has been since the new basilica was completed in 1976.[77] The iconography of the Virgin is fully Catholic:[78] Miguel Sánchez, the author of the 1648 tract Imagen de la Virgen María, described her as the Woman of the Apocalypse from the New Testament's Revelation 12:1, \"clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars.\" She is described as a representation of the Immaculate Conception.[59] Virgil Elizondo says the image also had layers of meaning for the indigenous people of Mexico who associated her image with their polytheistic deities, which further contributed to her popularity.[79][80] Her blue-green mantle was the color reserved for the divine couple Ometecuhtli and Omecihuatl;[81] her belt is interpreted as a sign of pregnancy; and a cross-shaped image, symbolizing the cosmos and called nahui-ollin, is inscribed beneath the image's sash.[82] She was called \"mother of maguey\",[83] the source of the sacred beverage pulque.[84] Pulque was also known as \"the milk of the Virgin\".[85] The rays of light surrounding her are seen to also represent maguey spines.[83] The image and tilma have been examined numerous times over the years. In 1662, canons of the cathedral in Mexico City began the process of asking for a proper liturgy for Our Lady of Guadalupe on December 12. As part of this request, Rome asked for a canonical investigation into the apparitions. The canons carried out this investigation from 1665–1666,[86] including an examination of the image in March 1666.[87] On March 13, 1666, seven painters examined the image, accompanied by the viceroy and several clerics. The painters unanimously agreed that it was \"impossible that any artist could paint and work something so beautiful, clean, and well-formed on a fabric which is as rough as is the tilma\",[88][87] and that the image must therefore be miraculous. They also noted the degree of preservation of the image and tilma, and that the tilma had not been prepared for painting.[89] On March 28, three members of the protomédico of New Spain also examined the image. They also noted how well-preserved the image was given the local climate, and saw this as evidence of the image's supernatural origin.[90] In contrast, the silver of the moon and the gold on the sunburst, which had both been added to the original, were faded.[87] On April 30, 1751, a group of eight painters headed by José de Ibarra were allowed to examine the image. On April 15, 1752, one of the painters, Miguel Cabrera, was again allowed access to the image in order to create three copies.[91][92] In 1756, Cabrera published his account of the image, approved by the other painters, entitled Maravilla Americana.[92] Like the previous report, Cabrera noted the preservation of the image despite the climate. He said that the tilma was two pieces of cloth sewn together, and that it felt soft, probably made of ayate fibers rather than the coarser maguey, as others had claimed. He discovered signs of four different painting techniques which he claimed had never been used in combination before. He said that the image had not been sized, and thus the image could be seen through the back of the cloth, though all but a small portion of the back was covered with silver at the time.[93][94] In 1787, another group of painters examined the image at the request of José Ignacio Bartolache [es], a doctor and mathematician. They confirmed Cabrera's opinion that the fabric of the tilma was not coarse, but determined that it was of palm fibers. Contrary to Cabrera, however, they claimed that the image had been sized beforehand, and was not visible from behind; however, four years later, two of the painters claimed that they had never seen the back of the image and did not know if it had been sized.[95] The artists came to the conclusion that the parts of the image that were original were of divine origin, though they noted that there were some touch-ups that were clearly the work of human hands, the first study to so note.[95][92] Art restorer José Antonio Flores Gómez was hired by the abbot of the basilica to work on the image in 1947 and 1973. In a 2002 interview with the magazine Proceso, he spoke about his experience. He noted that he had not been required to keep silent about his work, but had done so of his own accord.[76] When he examined the image in 1947, he saw a large crack in the paint running vertically through the middle of the image, as well as some smaller horizontal cracks, which he thought were caused by the image having been folded. He also saw signs that others had touched up the image at various points. The necessity of touching up the image convinced him that it was of human origin.[76] Like others, Flores Gómez noted the softness of the tilma, which seemed to him more like cotton than the rougher agave traditionally claimed. He also said that the paints used in the image came from natural pigments, such as from the cochineal.[76] In 1981, Philip Serna Callahan and Jody Brant Smith examined the image under infrared light, a common technique in art analysis. They were unable to find any trace of sizing or sketching underneath the paint. They concluded that, while there had been additions to and touch-ups of the image, which were in a poor state, there was no explanation for the original parts of the image or their preservation.[96] In 1982, Guillermo Schulenburg, abbot of the basilica, hired José Sol Rosales of the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes y Literatura to study the image. Sol Rosales thought that the tilma was made of linen and hemp, and not either agave or cotton. Contrary to previous claims, he said that the fabric had been prepared with white paint before the image had been painted. He saw several different styles of tempera throughout the image. He held that the paints were made from various natural pigments, and further noted that all of these pigments were commonly available in 16th-century Mexico. Like Flores Gómez, Sol Rosales saw various touch-ups and repainting throughout the image.[97] Sol Rosales concluded that the image was of human origin. He claimed that others, like Cabrera, had had similar findings, but concluded that the image was divine due to social pressures.[97] Sol Rosales and his team were supervised during the investigation by Schulenburg and others. Schulenburg sent the results of this study to the Vatican, cautioning against the canonization of Juan Diego.[76] Several studies have examined the eyes of the image. The authors of these studies claim that they have found images in the eyes corresponding to the people believed to have been present when Juan Diego opened his tilma before the bishop. The eyes are also claimed to contain Purkinje images exactly where they would be expected to be found in living eyes.[98] Critics of these studies liken the figures to inkblots in which proponents see what they hope to see.[99] Juan Diego's tilma has become Mexico's most popular religious and cultural symbol, and has received widespread ecclesiastical and popular veneration. In the 19th century it became the rallying cry of the Spaniards born in America, in what they denominated 'New Spain'. They said they considered the apparitions as legitimizing their own indigenous Mexican origin. They infused it with an almost messianic sense of mission and identity, thereby also justifying their armed rebellion against Spain.[100][101] Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe became a recognized symbol of Catholic Mexicans. Miguel Sánchez, the author in 1648 of the first published account of the vision, identified Guadalupe as Revelation's Woman of the Apocalypse, and said: ... this New World has been won and conquered by the hand of the Virgin Mary ... who had prepared, disposed, and contrived her exquisite likeness in this, her Mexican land, which was conquered for such a glorious purpose, won that there should appear so Mexican an image.[59] Throughout the Mexican national history of the 19th and 20th centuries, the Guadalupan name and image have been unifying national symbols; the first President of Mexico (1824–1829) changed his name from José Miguel Ramón Adaucto Fernández y Félix to Guadalupe Victoria in honor of the Virgin of Guadalupe.[102] Father Miguel Hidalgo, in the Mexican War of Independence (1810), and Emiliano Zapata, in the Mexican Revolution (1910), led their respective armed forces with Guadalupan flags emblazoned with an image of Our Lady of Guadalupe.[103] In 1999, the Church officially proclaimed her the Patroness of the Americas, the Empress of Latin America, and the Protectress of Unborn Children.[104] In 1810, Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla initiated the bid for Mexican independence with his Grito de Dolores, with the cry \"Death to the Spaniards and long live the Virgin of Guadalupe!\" When Hidalgo's mestizo-indigenous army attacked Guanajuato and Valladolid, they placed \"the image of the Virgin of Guadalupe, which was the insignia of their enterprise, on sticks or on reeds painted different colors\" and \"they all wore a print of the Virgin on their hats.\"[102] After Hidalgo's death, leadership of the revolution fell to a mestizo priest named José María Morelos, who led insurgent troops in the Mexican south. Morelos adopted the Virgin as the seal of his Congress of Chilpancingo, inscribing her feast day into the Chilpancingo constitution and declaring that Guadalupe was the power behind his victories: New Spain puts less faith in its own efforts than in the power of God and the intercession of its Blessed Mother, who appeared within the precincts of Tepeyac as the miraculous image of Guadalupe that had come to comfort us, defend us, visibly be our protection.[102] Simón Bolívar noticed the Guadalupan theme in these uprisings, and shortly before Morelos's execution in 1815 wrote: \"the leaders of the independence struggle have put fanaticism to use by proclaiming the famous Virgin of Guadalupe as the queen of the patriots, praying to her in times of hardship and displaying her on their flags... the veneration for this image in Mexico far exceeds the greatest reverence that the shrewdest prophet might inspire.\"[59] In 1912, Emiliano Zapata's peasant army rose out of the south against the government of Francisco Madero. Though Zapata's rebel forces were primarily interested in land reform—\"tierra y libertad\" ('land and liberty') was the slogan of the uprising—when his peasant troops penetrated Mexico City, they carried Guadalupan banners.[105] More recently, the contemporary Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN) named their \"mobile city\" in honor of the Virgin: it is called Guadalupe Tepeyac. EZLN spokesperson Subcomandante Marcos wrote a humorous letter in 1995 describing the EZLN bickering over what to do with a Guadalupe statue they had received as a gift.[106] Harringon argues that: The Aztecs... had an elaborate, coherent symbolic system for making sense of their lives. When this was destroyed by the Spaniards, something new was needed to fill the void and make sense of New Spain ... the image of Guadalupe served that purpose.[107] According to the traditional account, the name of Guadalupe, as the name was heard or understood by Spaniards, was chosen by the Virgin herself when she appeared on the hill outside Mexico City in 1531, ten years after the Conquest.[108] Guadalupe continues to be a mixture of the cultures which blended to form Mexico, both racially and religiously,[109] \"the first mestiza\",[110] or \"the first Mexican\",[111] \"bringing together people of distinct cultural heritages, while at the same time affirming their distinctness.\"[112] As Jacques Lafaye wrote in Quetzalcoatl and Guadalupe, \"as the Christians built their first churches with the rubble and the columns of the ancient pagan temples, so they often borrowed pagan customs for their own cult purposes.\"[113] The author Judy King asserts that Guadalupe is a \"common denominator\" uniting Mexicans. Writing that Mexico is composed of a vast patchwork of differences—linguistic, ethnic, and class-based—King says \"The Virgin of Guadalupe is the rubber band that binds this disparate nation into a whole.\"[111] The Mexican novelist, Carlos Fuentes, once said that \"you cannot truly be considered a Mexican unless you believe in the Virgin of Guadalupe.\"[114] Nobel Literature laureate Octavio Paz wrote in 1974 that \"The Mexican people, after more than two centuries of experiments and defeats, have faith only in the Virgin of Guadalupe and the National Lottery.\"[115] The shrine of the Virgin of Guadalupe is the most visited Catholic pilgrimage destination in the world. Over the Friday and Saturday of December 11 to 12, 2009, a record number of 6.1 million pilgrims visited the Basilica of Guadalupe in Mexico City to commemorate the anniversary of the apparition.[116] Religious imagery of Our Lady of Guadalupe appears in Roman Catholic parishes, especially those with Latin American heritage.[117] In addition, due to the growth of Hispanic communities in the United States, religious imagery of Our Lady of Guadalupe has started appearing in some Anglican, Lutheran, and Methodist churches.[117] The Virgin of Guadalupe is considered the Patroness of Mexico and the Continental Americas; she is also venerated by Native Americans, on the account of the devotion calling for the conversion of the Americas.[118] Due to Mary's appearance as a pregnant mother and her claims as mother of all in the apparition, the Blessed Virgin Mary, under this title is popularly invoked as Patroness of the Unborn and a common image for the Pro-Life movement.[119][120][121] Due to her association as a crusader of social justice, the image of Our Lady of Guadalupe has been utilized as a symbol across regions to advance political movements and mobilize the masses. For instance, the image has most notably been utilized in Mexico's Independence movement in the early 19th century, the United Farm Worker Movement in the U.S. in the 20th century and in contemporary political causes like immigration.[135][136] In Mexico's Independence, the image of Our Lady of Guadalupe became associated with the movement after Father Miguel Hidalgo rallied and united insurgents under her banner. In fact, the first president of the Mexican republic, José Miguel Ramón Adaucto Fernández y Félix, who was heavily involved in Mexico's Independence war, changed his name as to Guadalupe Victoria as a sign of devotion.[137][136] In the United Farm Workers Union (UFW), its leader, Cesar Chavez, was a devout Catholic who drew on his religious beliefs to demand for better wages and labor practices for farm workers in the U.S.[138] He incorporated his religious beliefs in the movement by holding masses in the picket lines and prayers before meetings, and leading a pilgrimage from Delano to Sacramento in 1966 during Lent.[138] Similarly to Mexico's Independence movement, the famous pilgrimage in 1966 that drew national attention to the cause was lead under a banner with the image of Our Lady of Guadalupe.[139] The image of Our Lady of Guadalupe is also present in the contemporary political discussion on immigration. Artists like Ester Hernandez and Consuelo Jimenez Underwood embed or reimagine her image on artworks that comment on immigration politics. For instance, Ester Hernandez's screen print titled Wanted (2010) and Consuelo Jimenez Underwood's Sacred Jump (1994) and Virgen de los Caminos (1994).[140][141][136] One notable reference in literature to the image and its alleged predecessor, the Aztec Earth goddess Tonantzin, is in Sandra Cisneros' short story \"Little Miracles, Kept Promises\", from her collection Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories (1991). Cisneros' story is constructed out of brief notes that people give Our Lady of Guadalupe in thanks for favors received, which in Cisneros' hands becomes a portrait of an extended Chicano community living throughout Texas. \"Little Miracles\" ends with an extended narrative (pp. 124–129) of a feminist artist, Rosario \"Chayo\" de León, who at first did not allow images of La Virgen de Guadalupe in her home because she associated her with subservience and suffering, particularly by Mexican women. But when she learns that Guadalupe's shrine is built on the same hill in Mexico City that had a shrine to Tonantzin, the Aztec Earth goddess and serpent destroyer, Chayo comes to understand that there's a deep, syncretic connection between the Aztec goddess and the Mexican saint; together they inspire Chayo's new artistic creativity, inner strength, and independence. In Chayo's words, \"I finally understood who you are. No longer Mary the mild, but our mother Tonantzin. Your church at Tepeyac built on the site of her temple\" (128).[142] The image and its alleged apparition was investigated several times, including in the 2013 documentary The Blood & The Rose, directed by Tim Watkins.[143] Drawing on the significance of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Chicano culture, many Chicano artists revere her image and visually reimagine the religious figure within a feminist and contemporary context.[144][145][141] More than just a religious symbol, Chicano artists view Our Lady of Guadalupe as an empowering feminist icon and a proclamation of Indigenous pride. However, these re-envisioned artworks have not been without controversy, as many artists have faced intense backlash from Catholic groups who view these artworks as \"disrespectful and irreverent\".[146] One of the most famous controversies was sparked by Alma López's Our Lady digital collage, which later led to a book titled Our Lady of Controversy: Alma López's Irreverent Apparition.[147][148] Despite this, Chicano artists such as Yolanda López, Alma López, Margarita 'Mita' Cuaron, Ester Hernández, and Consuelo Jimenez Underwood, among others, have used Our Lady of Guadalupe's portrait to explore themes of repression, feminine strength, and to uplift women.[149][150]",

                "content": "Our editors will review what you’ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article. Our Lady of Guadalupe, in Roman Catholicism, the Virgin Mary in her appearance before St. Juan Diego in four visions in 1531. The name also refers to the Marian apparition itself. Our Lady of Guadalupe holds a special place in the religious life of Mexico and is one of the most popular religious devotions. Her image, of a woman of mixed Indigenous and European features (mestiza) wearing a turquoise-colored mantle surrounded by a sunburst, has played an important role as a national symbol of Mexico. According to tradition, Mary appeared to Juan Diego, who was an Aztec convert to Christianity, on four occasions between December 9 and December 12, 1531. During her first apparition she requested that a shrine to her be built on the spot where she appeared, Tepeyac Hill (now in a suburb of Mexico City). However, the local bishop hesitated to act on this request. Mary appeared to Juan Diego a second time on December 9 after his meeting that day with the bishop and told him to return and try again. On December 10 Juan Diego met with the bishop, who this time demanded a sign before he would approve construction of a church. Mary then appeared a third time to Juan Diego, who told her of the bishop’s demand for a sign. On December 12, she made her fourth appearance, ordering Juan Diego to collect roses from the hill and bring them to the bishop. Miraculously, there were roses blooming on the hill, despite it being winter. Moreover, the roses were native to Castile, a region in Spain that was the homeland of the bishop. In his audience with the bishop on that day, Juan Diego opened his tilma (cloak), letting dozens of roses fall to the floor and revealing the image of Mary imprinted on the inside of the cloak—the image that is now venerated in the Basilica of Guadalupe. Mary is also said to have appeared to Juan Diego’s dying uncle, Juan Bernardino, and restored him to health. The traditional view has been questioned by various scholars and ecclesiastics, including the former abbot of the Basilica of Guadalupe. The primary objection is that there is no documentary evidence for the apparition until 1648; critics claim that documents purporting to be from the 16th century are actually from the 17th. Critics have also noted that the bishop approached by Juan Diego was not consecrated until 1534, and he makes no mention of Juan Diego or of Our Lady of Guadalupe in his writings. Defenders of the Virgin of Guadalupe—including Pope John Paul II, who canonized Juan Diego and declared Our Lady of Guadalupe the patroness of the Americas—accept the authenticity of the early documents and point also to various oral accounts of the apparition. John Paul II’s actions were only the latest in a series of developments affirming the importance of Our Lady of Guadalupe. A shrine to the Virgin has existed on the site since at least 1556, when the archbishop of New Spain promoted devotion to the image of Mary at a chapel in Tepeyac. The image was described by an English prisoner in Mexico City in 1568, and by the end of the 16th century Our Lady of Guadalupe formed part of a wide network of shrines to the Virgin throughout Mexico. The story of Mary’s appearance to Juan Diego was codified in the work of Miquel Sánchez in 1648, and an account in the Indigenous language (Nahuatl) was published in 1649 and widely accepted as accurate. The devotion continued to grow, especially after Our Lady of Guadalupe was credited with ending a deadly epidemic of hemorrhagic fever that ravaged Mexico City in 1736–37. In 1737 Our Lady of Guadalupe was proclaimed patroness of Mexico City, and in 1746 her patronage was accepted by all the territories of New Spain, which included part of present-day California as well as Mexico and regions as far south as Guatemala and El Salvador. In 1754 Pope Benedict XIV approved her patronage and granted her a proper feast and mass for December 12. Pope Pius X proclaimed her patroness of Latin America in 1910, and in 1935 Pius XI approved her patronage over the Philippines. Veneration of Our Lady of Guadalupe has been particularly strong among women, especially in Mexico, and since at least the early 18th century the devotion was spread throughout the world by the Jesuits and other religious. Our Lady of Guadalupe’s role in Mexican history is not limited to religious matters; she has played an important role in Mexican nationalism and identity. In 1810 Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla promoted her as the patroness of the revolt he led against the Spanish. The image of the Virgin of Guadalupe appeared on the rebels’ banners, and the rebels’ battle cry was “Long Live Our Lady of Guadalupe.” During a religious revival in Mexico in the late 19th century, preachers declared that the foundation of Mexico could be dated to the time of the apparition of Our Lady of Guadalupe, because she freed the people from idolatry and reconciled the Spanish and Indigenous peoples in a common devotion. Emiliano Zapata’s peasant rebels carried the banner of Our Lady when they entered Mexico City in 1914, and, during the civil war in Mexico in 1926–29, the banners of the rebels bore her image. Our Lady of Guadalupe’s continuing significance as a religious and national symbol is attested by the hundreds of thousands of pilgrims who visit her shrine in Mexico City every year. Additionally, the image of her that appears on St. Juan Diego’s tilma has been interpreted by some scholars as containing elements that hold particular meaning to Mexican and Indigenous people. Notably, these elements combine European Roman Catholic symbolism with imagery from the Aztec religion.",

Alphabet-owned YouTube is hiking the price of its popular TV streaming service, which has more than 8 million subscribers. Beginning in January, the cost of the platform will jump to $82.99 per month, up from $72.99. The latest price increase for YouTube TV stems from rising content costs, the company said. \"We don't make these decisions lightly, and we realize this has an impact on our members. We are committed to bringing you features that are changing the way we watch live TV,\" YouTube TV said in part in an email to subscribers Thursday. The price hike will be reflected in members' first billing cycle after January 13. Subscribers can check the plan they subscribe to by checking their account membership settings. YouTube acknowledged that some viewers might drop their subscriptions in light of the price hike, and reminded customers that they may do so at any time. YouTube follows other major streaming services in raising prices for consumers this year. In August, Disney upped the price of both its ad-supported and ad-free Disney+ services by $2. An ad-supported subscription costs $9.99, while the ad-free version costs $15.99 monthly. It also hiked the price of its Hulu + Live TV bundle. Apple TV+, Disney+ and Paramount+ have also either raised their prices, offered new service tiers or cracked down on password sharing (CBS News is owned by Paramount Global, which offers the streaming service Paramount+.) And more and more streamers have also tapped into bundles to get in on the live action. YouTube TV's new $82.99 price is the same as that advertised for Disney's Hulu + Live TV bundle. YouTube TV has boosted its price repeatedly since launching in 2017, when a subscription ran $35 a month. By 2019, the monthly cost was $50. YouTube last increased the charge in March 2023 to $72.99.

                "content": "Sections About Connect With Us 1 / 0 By WYATTE GRANTHAM-PHILIPS AP Business Writer NEW YORK (AP) — Are you a YouTube TV subscriber? Your monthly bills are about to get more expensive again. On Thursday, YouTube announced that it’s upping the price of its streaming service’s base plan by $10 — citing “the rising cost of content” and other investments. The new $82.99 a month price tag will go into effect starting Jan. 13 for existing subscribers, and immediately for new customers who sign up going forward. “We don’t make these decisions lightly, and we realize this impacts our members,” YouTube wrote on X. Google’s video giant also directed customers to an online FAQ for more information. Those who currently pay discounted prices, for example, won’t see the change until their trial or promotional has elapsed. YouTube TV has rolled out a series of price hikes over the years. When launched back in 2017, the going price of its streaming package was $35 a month. By 2019, that fee rose to $50 — and has climbed higher and higher since. The last time YouTube TV raised its base price, then to $72.99, was in March 2023. Earlier increases arrived as YouTube TV added more and more channels for subscribers to stream live. But licensing disputes have also added pressures — and YouTube has instead attributed its more recent hikes, like those announced both Thursday and last year, to rising operational costs. YouTube TV currently advertises more than 100 channels from broadcast, cable and regional sports networks, a DVR with unlimited storage and up to six accounts per household with three concurrent streams. And the platform says its latest price increase won’t change any of that. While YouTube TV’s live offerings are much different than individual online libraries seen from other popular streamers today, it’s no secret that streaming is getting more expensive overall — particularly as consumers juggle multiple subscriptions to access all the content they want. In recent years, big names like Netflix, Apple TV+ and Disney+ have all either hikes their prices or added things like ad-supported tiers and password limits. And more and more streamers have also tapped into bundles to get in on the live action. YouTube TV’s new $82.99 price is the same as that advertised for Disney’s Hulu + Live TV bundle.

He won one team and two individual gold medals at the 45th Chess Olympiad in 2024, as well as a bronze team medal. Gukesh is also a silver medalist at the Asian Games.[3] At the 2024 World Chess Championship, Gukesh defeated Ding Liren 7+1⁄2 to 6+1⁄2 to become the 18th World Chess Champion, winning 3 games out of 14. At the junior level, he is a multiple-gold medalist at the World Youth Championship and the Asian Youth Chess Championship. Gukesh was born on 29 May 2006 in Chennai into a Telugu family.[4][5] His father, Rajinikanth, is an ENT surgeon, and his mother, Padma, is a microbiologist.[6] He learned to play chess at the age of seven.[7] He studied at the Velammal Vidyalaya school, Mel Ayanambakkam, Chennai.[8] Gukesh began practicing and playing chess in 2013 for one hour, three days a week. After his good performance was acknowledged by his chess teachers, he began to participate more often and play tournaments on weekends.[9] Gukesh won the Under-9 section of the Asian School Chess Championships in 2015[10] and the World Youth Chess Championships in 2018 in the Under 12 category.[11] He also won five gold medals at the 2018 Asian Youth Chess Championships in the U-12 individual rapid and blitz, U-12 team rapid and blitz and U-12 individual classical formats.[12] He completed the requirements for the title of International Master in March 2017 at the 34th Cappelle-la-Grande Open.[13] On 15 January 2019, at the age of 12 years, 7 months, and 17 days, Gukesh became the then second-youngest grandmaster in history,[14] only surpassed by Sergey Karjakin by 17 days.[15] The record has since been beaten by Abhimanyu Mishra, making Gukesh the third-youngest.[16][17] In June 2021, he won the Julius Baer Challengers Chess Tour, Gelfand Challenge, scoring 14 out of 19 points.[18] In August 2022, he played the 44th Chess Olympiad and initially had a perfect score of 8/8, notably defeating US No. 1 Fabiano Caruana in the eighth match. He finished with a score of 9 out of 11, earning the gold medal on the 1st board and his team India-2 finished third in the tournament. In September 2022, Gukesh reached a rating of over 2700 for the first time, with a rating of 2726.[19] This made him the third-youngest player to pass 2700, after Wei Yi and Alireza Firouzja.[20] In October 2022 during the Aimchess Rapid tournament, Gukesh became the youngest player to beat Magnus Carlsen since the latter became World Champion.[21] In the August 2023 rating list, Gukesh became the youngest player ever to reach a rating of 2750.[22] Gukesh participated in the Chess World Cup 2023. He defeated Misratdin Iskandarov, S. L. Narayanan, Andrey Esipenko, and Wang Hao to qualify for the quarterfinals, where he was defeated by world No. 1 Magnus Carlsen.[23] In the September 2023 rating list, Gukesh officially surpassed Viswanathan Anand as the top-ranked Indian player, marking the first time in 37 years that Anand was not the top-ranked Indian player.[24][25] In December 2023, with the end of the FIDE Circuit, Gukesh qualified for the 2024 Candidates Tournament.[26] Gukesh had placed second in the Circuit, but Fabiano Caruana, the winner, had already qualified through the World Cup.[27] He became the third youngest player to qualify for a Candidates tournament, behind Bobby Fischer and Magnus Carlsen.[28][29] In January 2024, Gukesh participated in the Tata Steel Chess Tournament 2024. He scored 8.5/13 to finish in a 4-way tie for first place. In the twelfth round, he had a winning position against R Praggnanandhaa, but blundered into a threefold repetition. In tiebreaks, he defeated Anish Giri in semifinals but lost to Wei Yi in the finals.[30] In April 2024, Gukesh participated in the 2024 Candidates Tournament. Gukesh won games against R Praggnanandhaa and Vidit Gujrathi playing as black, Alireza Firouzja playing as white, and Nijat Abasov playing as both black and white.[31] His only loss was his game with black against Firouzja. This gave him five wins, one loss and eight draws, for a score of 9/14, winning the tournament and qualifying for the 2024 World Championship match against Ding Liren.[32] He is the youngest ever winner of the Candidates.[33][34][35] In September 2024, Gukesh took part in the Chess Olympiad in Budapest as part of the Indian team. He showcased a dominant performance on board one, defeating Wei Yi, Parham Maghsoodloo, and Fabiano Caruana and finishing with 9 points in 10 rounds. He had the highest performance rating of 3056 among all players in the tournament. His performance earned him an individual gold medal on board one, and helped India to their first ever team gold medal at the Olympiad.[36] Gukesh entered the FIDE world top-five for the first time on 1 October 2024.[37][38] Gukesh became the 18th World Chess Champion on 12 December 2024 after defeating Ding Liren in the last game and winning the World Chess Championship by 7.5–6.5.[39] The win made him the youngest undisputed World Chess Champion, with only Ruslan Ponomariov, the winner of the 2002 World Chess Championship, a knock-out style tournament during the period where there was a title split in the chess world, being younger.[40]",

The 18-year-old from Chennai broke the record held by the Russian Garry Kasparov for nearly four decades. With his victory against the defending champion, which came after 58 moves, Gukesh took his points tally to 7.5 points. That was the requirement for a player to win the World title. If the 14th game had ended in a draw, a series of tie-breaker games of speed chess were scheduled to be played on Friday (December 13, 2024).

There was no coming back for the Chinese Grandmaster after that. Game 14 | FIDE World Championship, presented by Google.◽️White: Ding Liren 🇨🇳 ◾️Black: Gukesh D 🇮🇳 ⚔️ Result: 0-1♟ Match score: 6½ - 7½ (for Gukesh D)↔️ Game length: 58 moves📖 Opening: Zukertort Opening ⚙️ Variation: Reversed Grunfeld#DingGukeshpic.twitter.com/nfqKTlPoAG This was the first-ever World championship match contested by two Asian countries. And it was a match between the players from India and China, the world’s two most populous countries and the continent’s superpowers. Gukesh is only the third Asian to win the World championship. Viswanathan Anand, who is now a mentor for Gukesh, was the first, and Ding the second. Gukesh is also only the 18th World champion in history, which dates back to 1886. That there have been only 17 undisputed World champions before him puts into perspective the enormity of the achievement. EDITORIAL | ​A legend, made: On D. Gukesh, the world’s youngest chess champion His campaign had begun on the wrong foot, though. He lost the first game, despite having white pieces (considered slightly advantageous usually). The second game was drawn, and Gukesh won the third to equalise the match at 1.5-1.5. All the following seven games were drawn. Then Gukesh won the 11th game to take the lead for the first time in the match, but Ding struck back immediately to draw level. That meant the match would go to the bitter end, contrary to the expectations of most top players, who had tipped Gukesh as the clear favourite, based on current form. By virtue of being the champion, Ding, who defeated Russia’s Ian Nepomniachtchi in last year’s World title match, had booked his flight ticket to Singapore. Gukesh qualified for the World championship by winning the qualifying tournament — the Candidates, which was held earlier this year in Toronto. Gukesh was well-prepared and the player who played the best won the match. His victory caps a phenomenal year for India. Combined with Olympiad dominance, chess has returned to its cradle and the era of \"Vishy's children\" is truly upon us! There were two other Indians in the Candidates (R. Praggnanandhaa and Vidit Gujrathi), as well as two in the Women’s event (Koneru Humpy and R. Vaishali). After that, Gukesh went on to play a major role in India’s stunning twin triumph at the Chess Olympiad in Budapest. India’s men’s and women’s teams won the team gold. Only two other countries had done it before — the erstwhile Soviet Union and China. Gukesh played on the top-board (where every country would usually field its best player) and won the individual gold. Back in 2022, he had clinched the same medal at the Chennai Chess Olympiad, winning an incredible eight games in a row. That was the turning point in his career.

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. The Liga MX Apertura is coming to a close as Club America and CF Monterrey will face off with the tile on the line. While they may not have topped the table before playoffs started, these are two of the most experienced sides in navigating the playoffs with 20 Liga MX titles between them. Club America have a record 15 but in recent years, Monterrey have grown as a force. Now they'll have a home and away leg to see who will take this current version and there will be American involvement. Alex Zendejas scored for America in their most recent match while Brandon Vazquez came off the bench to do the same for Monterrey. Here are our storylines, how you can watch the match and more: Monterrey: Earning a seeded place in the playoffs after finishing fifth, Rayados have proceeded to let the goals fly in their matches so far hanging six on Pumas and six more on San Luis en route to making the final. The defense may be a concern allowing six goals but this is one of the most dangerous attacks in Liga MX led by German Berterame but there are contributions through the entire squad. Club America: They've grinded through more matches than Monterrey allowing only three goals in the playoffs so far but all of those goals came at the hands of league leaders Cruz Azul during a wild 4-3 victory that saw two players sent off with red cards deep into stoppage time after Rodrigo Aguirre's 94th minute penalty broke the deadlock in the match. Monterrey: Going up against America's tough defense, it will be a chance to see how good Monterrey's attack is. While a team doesn't make it to the final by accident, the stakes are different when facing Mexico's most successful team. Not being able to keep clean sheets will make Monterrey's job harder but that also makes for quite a watchable final. Monterrey predicted XI: Luis Cardenas, Stefan Medina, Hector Moreno, Gerardo Arteaga, Sergio Canales, Oliver Torres, Jorge Rodriguez, Iker Jareth Fimbres Ochoa, Lucas Ocampos, Roberto de la Rosa, German Berterame Club America: Aguirre may have scored the winner to see off Cruz Azul but after being red carded, Andre Jardine will need to figure out what to do without one of his strikers being available. It will put more pressure on Henry Martin and Zendejas, but when this game could be a close one, depth off the bench will be critical. Club America predicted XI: Luis Malagon, Cristian Borja, Sebastian Caceres, Ramon Juarez Del Castillo, Israel Reyes, Alvaro Fidalgo, Jonathan dos Santos, Richard Sanchez, Henry Martin, Alex Zendejas It'll be a first leg that leaves us wanting more which is good since these teams will play again on Sunday to decide the final.

Developed by FromSoftware, Inc. and published by Bandai Namco Entertainment Inc., the upcoming game, ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN will thrust players into co-op multiplayer PVE combat against a harsh and unforgiving world.

Players take on the night together in an all-new experience from the team at FromSoftware.

Players must choose from eight unique characters, each with their own unique abilities and powerful Ultimates. Their journeys take them to Limveld, where they will have to make split-second decisions when it comes to combat and exploration in the face of a night cycle that shrinks the map with the coming Night’s Tide. At the end of each night, players will face a powerful boss and, if victorious, awaken to bigger challenges. Each session will culminate in the third night when they must face off against the chosen Nightlord. Individuals can fight the night alone, but strength will come in numbers. Nightfarers must learn to cooperate to take down these challenges, combining their unique abilities together for an unparalleled experience in the ELDEN RING universe. All is not lost for those who fall in defeat. Unsuccessful runs will grant players relics to allow them to customize and upgrade their characters tailored to their personal play styles. ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN is unlike any experience created before by FromSoftware. In this condensed action RPG, players will never experience the same journey twice as enemies, rewards and Limveld itself are ever-shifting and evolving each session in the realm of the Nightlord, Defeating greater enemies and venturing into the more dangerous parts of the map will uncover more powerful weapons and greater Rune rewards.

                "title": "Elden Ring: Nightreign hands-on: 6 hours with FromSoftware's wild new co-op roguelike action RPG remix | PC Gamer",
                "content": "We played the new Elden Ring spin-off and talked with FromSoftware about what to expect from the 2025 game. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. FromSoftware producer Yasuhiro Kitao asks us to forgive him if he seems nervous. He doesn't, but I'd have already sweated through my socks if I was in his shoes—he's about to let us play FromSoftware's next game a full week before the rest of the world learns it exists with a surprise trailer at The Game Awards. After the 25-million-selling phenomenon of Elden Ring, this follow-up is the last thing any of us expect. Because it looks—and I say this with zero shade—kinda like a mod. Modders delight in remixing FromSoftware's RPGs into games that are easier (or harder), sillier (or scarier). The Seamless Co-Op mod for Elden Ring has been downloaded by more than 2.5 million PC gamers. Randomizers that shuffle Souls games' items and enemy locations are mainstays of speedrunning events. So who says FromSoftware can't get in on the fun by modding its own game? Well, crank the speed up to 150%, ditch fall damage, throw in a ton of random loot and some other roguelikey variables, and you've pretty much got Elden Ring: Nightreign. I'll admit I didn't take to it right away. But about four hours into an all-day playtest in a conference room in Tokyo, blinds drawn against the sun until it dropped below the nearby office towers, I started to feel it: that raw animal thrill of a great roguelike build. The chest-thumping glory of slicing a six-foot katana through the guts of Margit the Fell Omen, proccing a bleed that chunked off 10% of his health bar, and then mashing my character's special ability to double all the damage I just dealt. Glorious. Nightreign is simultaneously part Elden Ring, and part totally new ground for a studio that's gotten very comfortable making a certain type of RPG over the last decade. Nightreign is Elden Ring Turbo, a condensed three-player roguelike with a lil' dash of Monster Hunter to it This spin-off makes a perplexing first impression, treating Elden Ring's weapons, enemy types, and starting zone Limgrave as an all-you-can-reuse asset store. The vibes get even stranger when you see a battle royale-style wall of deadly rain encircling the map, and characters dashing around on foot like they're set to permanent fast-forward, now nimbly mantling cliffs and walls. It seems almost sacrilegious to take the pieces of a game that was so microscopically assembled and go hog wild with them. If Da Vinci wanted to repaint the Mona Lisa doing a Gene Simmons tongue thing, well, sure, he earned it. But it'd be an adjustment, you know? Playing Nightreign reminded me that in the '90s Capcom balked at the sudden popularity of bootleg, hacked versions of Street Fighter 2 arcade machines that sped up the combat and added wild special moves like mid-air fireballs… until they went out and played them. Then they knew there was clearly no going back. Precision game balance be damned, the speed was just too much fun. Their resulting official upgrade kit Street Fighter 2 Turbo: Hyper Fighting—literally a mod!—set the pace for every iteration of Street Fighter that followed. Nightreign is Elden Ring Turbo, a condensed three-player roguelike with a lil' dash of Monster Hunter to it, as you choose a final boss to face at the end of each 30-ish minute run. That's assuming you survive two \"days\" of the circle shrinking to a focal point somewhere in alt-Limgrave, each night culminating in its own tough boss battle. When I started my first session by dropping onto the map from a spectral bird, the entrance was so Fortnite-coded I wondered if FromSoftware was joining the live service party with a battle pass, seasonal events and $20 epic skins. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. But that's not Nightreign, despite all appearances. \"We wanted to have a game that felt like a complete package out of the box on the day of purchase, so everything is unlockable... it's not what we'd consider a 'live service' game,\" says director Junya Ishizaki, who served as the battle director on Elden Ring and has been with FromSoftware since the original Dark Souls. Nightreign will get some post-release balance updates, as Elden Ring itself did, but beyond that? \"We're still in the process of thinking about the possibilities,\" he says. Nightreign is Ishizaki's baby: via an interpreter he told me that he'd been brewing game ideas when president Hidetaka Miyazaki suggested he try directing. He put together the pitch and got a green light. \"The one [bit of guidance] that sticks out is that he basically said, 'do it as you please' for this project,\" Ishizaki says. It's a lean and unusually straightforward game for FromSoftware—no PvP elements at all, no invasions, no esoteric multiplayer covenants a la Dark Souls. \"We wanted to have a sense of accomplishment from each defeat and each success, and we wanted this to be different from Elden Ring and past titles,\" Ishizaki says. Win or lose, you'll end a run with relics you can equip in future sessions, offering a range of buffs to HP, or magic attacks, or even your basic actions. I found one relic that made my healing flask also heal my allies, a huge benefit when we each only had four to quaff before running dry. Preset \"heroes\" with unique attributes replace the character creator. The lithe Duchess, for example, has a tiny HP pool but dodges attacks with a Bloodborne-style quick step instead of the usual roll. The characters are cool, and so are their abilities—empowering additions to a combat system that's always been more deliberate than razzle-dazzle. Still, there's something odd about this mashup that plucks bits and pieces from roguelikes and battle royales and even hero shooters and uses them for seasoning in a boiled down pot o' Elden Ring. I ask Ishizaki what he'd say to players who view the changes as FromSoftware simply copying what's popular in other games. \"The focus was condensing this experience down—the RPG elements, the exploration, the character building and leveling. We wanted that to feel like it was all coming together and culminating in a boss fight but in a more concentrated form,\" he says. \"For this new sense of accomplishment that you wouldn't quite find with Elden Ring or our previous titles, we felt like we needed some new mechanics and some new elements to add into that mix. We've never really held the stance 'let's absolutely not do anything that other companies are doing or not follow any trends.' So we didn't really see this as chasing a trend, but we saw these as interesting elements that could work well within our multiplayer-focused session-based gameplay.\" My favorite thing about Nightreign, almost immediately, is the addition of two unique abilities per character that totally change how I play. The characters themselves aren't quite classes, but the Duchess is a clear glass cannon DPS, able to double the damage she and her allies have just dished with her Restage ability. By the end of the day I was yelling \"Run it back!\" to my co-op squadmate playing Duchess when I used the knight character Wylder's grappling hook to zip towards a boss, then drop his ult, a fiery charged explosion that deals immense damage at close range. As with Street Fighter 2 Turbo, the bombastic new moves are thrilling, even if they feel slightly bolted on to an existing combat system. (Does Wylder only have a grappling hook because FromSoftware already had the physics code for that exact mechanic ready to go from Sekiro?) The default controls, at least currently, are a bit awkward—instead of getting their own dedicated buttons, the abilities require first hitting Y/Triangle on a gamepad at the same time as one of the triggers. This mostly worked fine but the occasional mispress had me swapping to a two-handed sword grip instead of using my ult at a key moment. As the all-rounder knight archetype, Wylder is emblematic of how different Nightreign feels from the usual singleplayer Souls game; the quick cooldown on his grappling hook gives him a huge agility boost over the usual \"default\" plodding sword-and-board playstyle.There's also a mage, a tanky heavy knight, and four other characters I didn't set eyes on, but broadly speaking any character can use almost any weapon, from a staff to a colossal greatsword. Weapons come with random buffs attached, including passives that are in effect as long as you keep them in your limited inventory. I've always lamented how rarely I end up changing builds in a Souls campaign, so being forced to make do with what I find on the field—while also benefitting from what I choose to keep in my pocket—is a delightful change. Like my favorite roguelikes, Nighreign seems eager to pepper gear with stats that compound in ways that range from 'ooh this will change my build' to 'I am now more powerful than god,' When I first drop onto Nightreign's map, I don't know how to decide where to go, so I dash towards the nearest fort and immediately get in over my head. At level 1 you're extremely squishy, but there's always a low-level camp not far away that serves as an easy source of runes to farm for 1-2 levels and a couple weapon pickups. Sites of grace dot the map to refill your flasks and let you level up all your stats in one go—no RPG picking and choosing—but they no longer provide a completely safe haven. After a few minutes of free exploration, the circle starts closing, pushing me towards the eventual first night's boss fight. We die to the Demihuman swordsman and queen, a pair of Elden Ring bosses we'll be absolutely curb stomping within a few hours. As with most roguelikes, knowledge and familiarity will take you a long way in Nightreign. Four hours after starting, my co-op squad had our strategy down to a science. Land, hit the nearest outpost just to grab a couple levels and any weapons with useful passive skills, then beeline for the nearest church, which will present us with an extra healing flask each. Stop along the way only for easy fights. Stay grouped up if anyone encounters a field boss we think we can take, like the weak sauce perfumer who dies in a few hits as long as you avoid his one lazy fire attack. If we have time, we rush to a second church before the end of day one; our goal is to get at least three of the four that are spaced around the edges of the map by the end of day two. Calling out targets and abilities is key. Against night one's boss we gang up on the fast-but-weak demihuman swordsman while ignoring the lumbering queen. Our Guardian uses his ult, an AOE divebomb, to revive one of us when we go down—you heal your allies in Nightreign by simply attacking them. By the time we fight Margit the Fell Omen on night two we're arguably overleveled, having cleared out a fortress, deleted a dragon thanks to a massive bleed hit doubled by Duchess's Restage, and even stopped by an item vendor to grab some smithing stones to upgrade our weapons one tier. We're nearly at what we think is the game's level cap of 15 when we fight the final boss for our run, a cerberus stand-in with some fiery bad breath. The first time we face it we're nervous, but it proves easier than one of the potential night two bosses, a Tree Sentinel flanked by two other heavily armored riders. The second time we barely break a sweat dodging a familiar set of FromSoft boss stomps, divebombs, and fire blasts. After some discouraging defeats at the hands of bosses who seemingly had overly-tuned health pools, those back-to-back wins felt good. Real good—in that way that roguelikes make you want to start all over again and experience the same rush with a new build, or see if you can recreate that exact combination of items that just made you feel invincible. Like my favorite roguelikes, Nighreign seems eager to pepper gear with stats that compound in ways that range from 'ooh this will change my build' to 'I am now more powerful than god,' but it was hard to judge those combinations in this preview. Much of the game's English text was not yet inserted, with often unhelpful fragments of item descriptions. This ultimately left me uncertain about the thing Nightreign has to get just right: its map. Nightreign's map is peppered with familiar outposts, ruins and forts full of enemies, caves and gaols (which weren't functioning in the build we played) and churches. While the bosses and enemies you encounter in these locations vary from run to run, I am a bit worried that retracing my steps across the mostly unchanging topography dozens of times will get old even with that peppering of change. But Ishizaki says the map will sometimes see \"large-scale changes to terrain in the form of procedurally appearing volcanos or swamps or forests,\" and hinted at some degree of meta progression that will apply to the storylines of the hero characters and the map evolving in some way as you play more of the game. \"We wanted the map itself to be a giant dungeon, so players have the chance to traverse and explore a different way every time they play,\" he says. \"You have to choose the boss you want to face at the end of the third day. Once you've made that choice, maybe you have an idea of how you want to strategize against that boss, and this might change how you approach the map. We wanted to offer players that agency to decide 'okay, I need to go after a poison weapon this time to face this boss. Maybe that will take me to an area I don't usually go, or an enemy I don't usually want to fight.' Hopefully this gives a little more variation between runs as well.\" Without complete item descriptions or tooltips to help me interpret the map's many tiny icons, I can't say I developed any strategies more sophisticated than \"get more healing flasks.\" And that worked so well, it makes me a little uneasy about how much Nightreign will really demand more thought from me. The wizard towers, for example, seem painfully simple, with the \"puzzles\" to enter them never varying from a couple possible locations for a well-telegraphed hidden object to be waiting for a sword swipe. I was already sick of reenacting the same rote solution and the same climb to the top of the tower for a treasure chest after a couple hours. These simply need to be more complex, and more varied, to stay interesting for more than a couple hours of play, which is worrying in a game meant to be played over and over again. I hope those sorts of issues are merely a symptom of this early build, and not indicative of what will hopefully be a richer, more varied strategic playspace in the final game, which will be out sometime in 2025. The thrill of the higher pace will only work for so long, and when it wears off, Nightreign needs something to fill the void left by the lack of FromSoft's famously intricate level design. Or it simply needs more maps—FromSoft has indicated this is the map, with nothing beyond the confines of this reimagined Limgrave. Discovering there's actually a remixed Caelid, and remixed Liurnia, and so on and so forth would certainly assuage my worry that the terrain itself will prove a weak link. But as drastically different as Nightreign is from Elden Ring itself, I did get the sense that one thing is the same as it ever was: FromSoftware's still holding tight to plenty of secrets.

                "content": "FromSoftware isn’t done with Elden Ring yet. The hit open-world RPG that just got a GOTY-nominated expansion is coming back with a completely new spin-off in 2025. It’s called Elden Ring: Nightreign and it’s a co-op action adventure that looks as excellent as the game it’s based on. The standalone game takes place in a world parallel to the one in the 2022 game and will pit players against randomized encounters in a smaller version of the map every time they pick up and play. The challenges will scale through a day-night cycle with players facing a Nightlord boss on the third night. It’ll be on PlayStation 5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC. FromSoftware says players will never experience the same playthrough twice. Take a look: Multiple players will be able to band together against tough enemies and brutal bosses in what seems almost like a live-service roguelite. They’ll explore dangerous parts of the map for better weapons and greater Rune rewards and uncover Sites of Grace to level up heroes. Each run will get players closer to unravelling the story and bestow lasting stat bonuses. There also seems to be more flexibility and versatility in how characters move, suggesting combat might be a little more twitchy and arcade-y than that in the original Elden Ring. The smaller scale of the world might also allow Nightreign to explore some design elements more deeply than the first game. FromSoftware director Hidetaka Miyazaki previously said that the studio had no plans to work on an Elden Ring sequel but that multiple other projects exploring other genres were in production. Nightreign certainly fits that description, and probably means that even though we’re getting more Elden Ring, we won’t be getting a direct sequel after all anytime soon. The studio’s majority owner, Kadokawa Corporation, is currently looking at a potential merger with Sony. While the acquisition seems targeted at the parent company’s vast media holdings, which include anime, manga, and online streaming distribution, the maker of Elden Ring and Dark Souls joining the larger PlayStation portfolio is no doubt part of the appeal. .",

Don’t miss this chance to elevate your leadership and strengthen your union! In a historic vote, the House of Representatives has voted to repeal WEP/GPO and restore fairness to Social Security. Today, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 82, the Social Security Fairness Act, by a vote of 327 to 75. H.R. 82 has been a top priority for the IAFF. The bill eliminates the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO), provisions that unfairly punish retired fire fighters, police officers, teachers, and other public servants. “Today’s vote was a major step toward ensuring fire fighters and other public servants receive the full retirement they’ve earned and paid for,” said General President Edward A. Kelly. “While we’re proud of the work our team did to get this bill through the House, this is only half the battle. Now it’s time for Senators to step up and send this bill to the President’s desk.” The vote on the House floor was the culmination of a multi-year effort by the IAFF, which worked closely with lawmakers and their staff to stress the impact these unfair penalties have on fire fighters and emergency medical workers. Despite H.R. 82 being one of the most bipartisan bills introduced in the 118th Congress, the bill has been stalled in the powerful House Ways and Means Committee for nearly two years. Many believed that the bill’s detractors would successfully prevent it from coming up for a vote of the whole House. In September, the IAFF, along with Rep. Abigail Spanberger (D-V.A.) and Rep. Garret Graves (R-L.A.) – the bill’s leading sponsors – led a successful discharge petition on H.R. 82. Discharge efforts give lawmakers a chance to bypass the committee of jurisdiction and send a bill directly to the House floor. While discharge petitions are rarely successful, 171 Democrats and 47 Republicans agreed to discharge the Social Security Fairness Act. While we’re proud of the work our team did to get this bill through the House, this is only half the battle. Now it’s time for Senators to step up and send this bill to the President’s desk. Now that H.R. 82 has passed the House, the bill moves to the Senate. Unlike the House, where the majority party can move legislation through the body relatively quickly if they have the votes, the Senate gives each Senator unique powers to slow down the legislative process. These powers include the right to offer amendments to legislation, and the right to speak on a bill. Because of this, the Senate must vote to end debate on a bill before it can be finally voted on and passed. This process, known as invoking cloture, requires a 60-vote threshold. Currently, the Senate version of the Social Security Fairness Act has 62 co-sponsors, meaning if all those who have co-sponsored the bill vote to invoke cloture, a vote on final passage would be guaranteed. The IAFF is asking all members to join the fight to pass WEP/GPO repeal. Senators need to hear directly from those most impacted by these unfair penalties. “Now is the time to make our voices heard to the Senate,” said Kelly. “Our fire fighters, emergency medical workers, and other dedicated public servants deserve to retire with dignity. Repealing the WEP/GPO helps ensure that.” Contact your Senators through the IAFF’s Advocacy Center and tell them to support the Social Security Fairness Act. Privacy Policy | © 2024 IAFF.

                "title": "Senate begins final push to expand Social Security benefits for millions of people",
                "content": "Manage your account WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate is pushing toward a vote on legislation that would provide full Social Security benefits to millions of people, setting up potential passage in the final days of the lame-duck Congress. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Thursday he would begin the process for a final vote on the bill, known as the Social Security Fairness Act, which would eliminate policies that currently limit Social Security payouts for roughly 2.8 million people. Schumer said the bill would “ensure Americans are not erroneously denied their well-earned Social Security benefits simply because they chose at some point to work in their careers in public service.” See for yourself — The Yodel is the go-to source for daily news, entertainment and feel-good stories. By signing up, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Policy. The legislation passed the House on a bipartisan vote, and a Senate version of the bill introduced last year gained 62 cosponsors. But the bill still needs support from at least 60 senators to pass Congress. It would then head to President Biden. At least one GOP senator who signed onto similar legislation last year, Sen. Mike Braun of Indiana, said he was still “weighing” whether to vote for the bill next week. “Nothing ever gets paid for, so if it's further indebtedness, I don't know,” he said. Decades in the making, the bill would repeal two federal policies — the Windfall Elimination Provision and the Government Pension Offset — that broadly reduce payments to two groups of Social Security recipients: people who also receive a pension from a job that is not covered by Social Security and surviving spouses of Social Security recipients who receive a government pension of their own. The bill would add more strain on the Social Security Trust funds, which were already estimated to be unable to pay out full benefits beginning in 2035. It would add an estimated $195 billion to federal deficits over 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget also estimates that if passed, the policy would hasten the Social Security program's insolvency date by about half a year as well as reduce lifetime Social Security benefits by an additional $25,000 for a typical dual-income couple retiring in 2033. Sen. John Thune, the no. 2 Republican in leadership, acknowledged that the policy has strong bipartisan support, but said some Republicans also want to see it “fixed in the context of a broader Social Security reform effort.” Conservatives have opposed the bill, decrying its cost. “Even for something that people consider to be a good cause, it shows a lack of concern for the future of the country, so I think it would be a big mistake,” said Sen. Rand Paul, a Republican from Kentucky. Still, other Republicans have pushed Schumer to bring it up for a vote. Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., said last month that the current federal limitations “penalize families across the country who worked a public service job for part of their career with a separate pension. We’re talking about police officers, firefighters, teachers, and other public employees who are punished for serving their communities.” He predicted the bill would pass. ___",

                "content": "19°29′04″N 99°07′02″W﻿ / ﻿19.48444°N 99.11722°W﻿ / 19.48444; -99.11722 Our Lady of Guadalupe (Spanish: Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe), also known as the Virgin of Guadalupe (Spanish: Virgen de Guadalupe), is a Catholic title of Mary, mother of Jesus associated with a series of four Marian apparitions to a Mexican peasant named Juan Diego and one to his uncle, Juan Bernardino, which are believed to have occurred in December 1531, when the Mexican territories were part of the Spanish Empire. A venerated image on a cloak (tilmahtli) associated with the apparition is enshrined in the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico City. Pope Leo XIII granted the image a decree of canonical coronation on February 8, 1887, and it was pontifically crowned on October 12, 1895. The basilica is the most-visited Catholic shrine in the world, and the world's third most-visited sacred site.[2][3] According to the Nican Mopohua, included in the 17th-century Huei tlamahuiçoltica, written in Nahuatl, the Virgin Mary appeared four times to Juan Diego, a Chichimec peasant, and once to his uncle, Juan Bernardino. The first apparition occurred on the morning of Saturday, December 9, 1531 (Julian calendar, which is December 19 on the (proleptic) Gregorian calendar in present use). Juan Diego experienced a vision of a young woman at a place called the Hill of Tepeyac, which later became part of Villa de Guadalupe, in a suburb of Mexico City.[4] According to the accounts, the woman, speaking to Juan Diego in Nahuatl, his first language and the language of the former Aztec Empire, identified herself as the Mary, \"mother of the very true deity\".[5] She was said to have asked for a church to be erected at that site in her honor.[4] Based on her words, Juan Diego then sought the Archbishop of Mexico City, Juan de Zumárraga, to tell him what had happened. Not unexpectedly, the Archbishop did not believe Diego. Later the same day, Juan Diego saw the young woman again (the second apparition), and she asked him to continue insisting.[4] The next day, Sunday, December 10, 1531, in the Julian calendar, Juan Diego spoke to the Archbishop a second time. The latter instructed him to return to Tepeyac and to ask the woman for a truly acceptable, miraculous sign to prove her identity. Later that day, the third apparition appeared when Juan Diego returned to Tepeyac; encountering the same woman, he reported to her the Archbishop's request for a sign, which she consented to provide on the next day (December 11).[6] On Monday, December 11, however, Juan Diego’s uncle fell ill and he was obliged to attend to him. In the early hours of Tuesday, December 12, as Juan Bernardino's condition deteriorated, Juan Diego journeyed to Tlatelolco in search of a Catholic priest to hear Juan Bernardino's confession and help minister to him on his deathbed.[4] To avoid being delayed by the Virgin and ashamed at having failed to meet her on Monday as agreed, Juan Diego chose another route around Tepeyac Hill, yet the Virgin intercepted him and asked where he was going (fourth apparition); Juan Diego explained what had happened and the Virgin gently chided him for not having made recourse to her. In the words which have become the most famous phrase of the Guadalupe apparitions and are inscribed above the main entrance to the Basilica of Guadalupe, she asked \"¿No estoy yo aquí que soy tu madre?\" (\"Am I not here, I who am your mother?\"). She assured him that Juan Bernardino had now recovered and told him to gather flowers from the summit of Tepeyac Hill, which was normally barren, especially in the cold of December. Juan Diego obeyed her instruction and he found Castilian roses, not native to Mexico, blooming there.[4] According to the story, the Virgin arranged the flowers in Juan Diego's tilmàtli or cloak, and when Juan Diego opened his cloak later that day before Archbishop Zumárraga, the flowers fell to the floor, revealing on the fabric the image of the Virgin.[4] The next day, December 13, Juan Diego found his uncle fully recovered as the Virgin had assured him, and Juan Bernardino recounted that he also had seen her after praying at his bedside (fifth apparition); that she had instructed him to inform the Archbishop of this apparition and of his miraculous cure; and that she had told him she desired to be known under the title of \"Guadalupe\".[4] The Archbishop kept Juan Diego's mantle, first in his private chapel and then in the church on public display, where it attracted great attention. On December 26, 1531, a procession formed to transfer the miraculous image back to Tepeyac Hill where it was installed in a small, hastily erected chapel.[7] During this procession, the first miracle was allegedly performed when a native was mortally wounded in the neck by an arrow shot by accident during some stylized martial displays performed in honor of the Virgin. In great distress, the natives carried him before the Virgin's image and pleaded for his life. Upon the arrow being withdrawn, the victim fully and immediately recovered.[8] The shrine to Our Lady of Guadalupe in Guadalupe, Cáceres, in Extremadura, Spain, was the most important of the shrines to the Virgin Mary in the medieval Kingdom of Castile.[9] It is one of the many Black Madonnas in Spain and is revered in the Monastery of Santa María de Guadalupe, in the town of Guadalupe, from which numerous Spanish conquistadors stem. The most popular etymology of the name \"Guadalupe\" is from the Arabic \"Wadi\" (river) and the Latin word \"lupus\" (wolf). Some find it unlikely that Arabic and Latin would be combined in this way, and suggest as an alternative the Arabic \"Wadi-al-lub\", signifying a river with black stones in its bed.[10] The shrine houses a statue reputed to have been carved by Luke the Evangelist and given to Archbishop Leander of Seville by Pope Gregory I. According to local legend, when Seville was taken by the Moors in 712, a group of priests fled northward and buried the statue in the hills near the Guadalupe River.[11] At the beginning of the 14th century, the Virgin appeared one day to a humble cowboy named Gil Cordero who was searching for a missing animal in the mountains.[12] Cordero claimed that Mary had appeared to him and ordered him to ask priests to dig at the site of the apparition. Excavating priests rediscovered the hidden statue and built a small shrine around it which became the great Guadalupe monastery.[11] Following the Conquest in 1519–1521, the Marian cult was brought to the Americas and Franciscan friars often leveraged syncretism with existing religious beliefs as an instrument for evangelization. What is purported by some to be the earliest mention of the miraculous apparition of the Virgin is a page of parchment, the Codex Escalada from 1548, which was discovered in 1995 and, according to investigative analysis, dates from the sixteenth century.[13] This document bears two pictorial representations of Juan Diego and the apparition, several inscriptions in Nahuatl referring to Juan Diego by his Aztec name, and the date of his death: 1548, as well as the year that the then named Virgin Mary appeared: 1531. It also contains the glyph of Antonio Valeriano; and finally, the signature of Fray Bernardino de Sahagun which was authenticated by experts from the Banco de Mexico and Charles E. Dibble.[14] Historians Alberto Peralta and Stafford Poole questioned the authenticity of the document.[15][16] A more complete early description of the apparition occurs in a 16-page manuscript called the Nican mopohua, which has been reliably dated in 1556 and was acquired by the New York Public Library in 1880. This document, written in Nahuatl, tells the story of the apparitions and the supernatural origin of the image. It was probably composed by a native Aztec man, Antonio Valeriano, who had been educated by Franciscans. The text of this document was later incorporated into a printed pamphlet which was widely circulated in 1649.[17][18][19][20] In spite of these documents, there are no known 16th century written accounts of the Guadalupe vision by the archbishop Juan de Zumárraga.[21] In particular, the canonical account of the vision features archbishop Juan de Zumárraga as a major player in the story, but, although Zumárraga was a prolific writer, there is nothing in his extant writings that can confirm the indigenous story.[22] The written record suggests the Catholic clergy in 16th century Mexico were deeply divided as to the orthodoxy of the native beliefs springing up around the image of Our Lady of Guadalupe, with the Franciscan order (who then had custody of the chapel at Tepeyac) being strongly opposed to the outside groups, while the Dominicans supported it.[23] The main promoter of the story was the Dominican Alonso de Montúfar, who succeeded the Franciscan Juan de Zumárraga as archbishop of Mexico. In a 1556 sermon Montúfar commended popular devotion to \"Our Lady of Guadalupe\", referring to a painting on cloth (the tilma) in the chapel of the Virgin Mary at Tepeyac, where certain miracles had also occurred. Days later, Fray Francisco de Bustamante, local head of the Franciscan order, delivered a sermon denouncing the native belief and believers. He expressed concern that the Catholic Archbishop was promoting a superstitious regard for an indigenous image:[24] The devotion at the chapel... to which they have given the name Guadalupe was prejudicial to the Indians because they believed that the image itself worked miracles, contrary to what the missionary friars had been teaching them, and because many were disappointed when it did not. Archbishop Montúfar opened an inquiry into the matter at which the Franciscans repeated their position that the image encouraged idolatry and superstition, and four witnesses testified to Bustamante's statement that the image was painted by an Indian, with one witness naming him \"the Indian painter Marcos\".[25] This could refer to the Aztec painter Marcos Cipac de Aquino, who was active at that time.[26][27] Prof. Jody Brant Smith, referring to Philip Serna Callahan's examination of the tilma using infrared photography in 1979, wrote: \"if Marcos did, he apparently did so without making a preliminary sketches – in itself then seen as a near-miraculous procedure... Cipac may well have had a hand in painting the Image, but only in painting the additions, such as the angel and moon at the Virgin's feet.\"[28] Ultimately Archbishop Montúfar, himself a Dominican, decided to end Franciscan custody of the shrine.[29] From then on the shrine was kept and served by diocesan priests under the authority of the archbishop.[30] Moreover, Archbishop Montúfar authorized the construction of a much larger church at Tepeyac, in which the tilma was later mounted and displayed.[31] In the late 1570s, the Franciscan historian Bernardino de Sahagún denounced the cult at Tepeyac and the use of the name \"Tonantzin\" or to call her Our Lady in a personal digression in his General History of the Things of New Spain, also known as the \"Florentine Codex\": At this place [Tepeyac], [the Indians] had a temple dedicated to the mother of the gods, whom they called Tonantzin, which means Our Mother. There they performed many sacrifices in honor of this goddess ... And now that a church of Our Lady of Guadalupe is built there, they also called her Tonantzin, being motivated by those preachers who called Our Lady, the Mother of God, Tonantzin. While it is not known for certain where the beginning of Tonantzin may have originated, but this we know for certain, that, from its first usage, the word refers to the ancient Tonantzin. And it was viewed as something that should be remedied, for their having [native] name of the Mother of God, Holy Mary, instead of Tonantzin, but Dios inantzin. It appears to be a Satanic invention to cloak idolatry under the confusion of this name, Tonantzin. And they now come to visit from very far away, as far away as before, which is also suspicious, because everywhere there are many churches of Our Lady and they do not go to them. They come from distant lands to this Tonantzin as in olden times.[32] Sahagún's criticism of the indigenous group seems to have stemmed primarily from his concern about a syncretistic application of the native name Tonantzin to the Catholic Virgin Mary. However, Sahagún often used the same name in his sermons as late as the 1560s.[33] One of the first printed accounts of the history of the apparitions and image occurs in Imagen de la Virgen Maria, Madre de Dios de Guadalupe, published in 1648 by Miguel Sánchez, a diocesan priest of Mexico City.[34] Another account is the Codex Escalada, dating from the sixteenth century, a sheet of parchment recording apparitions of the Virgin Mary and the figure of Juan Diego, which reproduces the glyph of Antonio Valeriano alongside the signature of Fray Bernardino de Sahagún. It contains the following glosses: \"1548 Also in that year of 1531 appeared to Cuahtlatoatzin our beloved mother the Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico. Cuahtlatoatzin died worthily\"[35] The next printed account was a 36-page tract in the Nahuatl language, Huei tlamahuiçoltica (\"The Great Event\"), which was published in 1649. This tract contains a section called the Nican mopohua (\"Here it is recounted\"), which has been already touched on above. The composition and authorship of the Huei tlamahuiçoltica is assigned by a majority of those scholars to Luis Laso de la Vega, vicar of the sanctuary of Tepeyac from 1647 to 1657.[36] Nevertheless, the most important section of the tract, the Nican Mopohua, appears to be much older. It has been attributed since the late 1600s to Antonio Valeriano (c. 1531–1605), a native Aztec man who had been educated by the Franciscans and who collaborated extensively with Bernardino de Sahagún.[17] A manuscript version of the Nican Mopohua, which is now held by the New York Public Library,[37] appears to be dated to c. 1556, and may have been the original work by Valeriano, as that was used by Laso in composing the Huei tlamahuiçoltica. Most authorities agree on the dating and on Valeriano's authorship.[18][19][20] On the other hand, in 1666, the scholar Luis Becerra Tanco published in Mexico a book about the history of the apparitions under the name Origen milagroso del santuario de Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe, which was republished in Spain in 1675 as Felicidad de Mexico.[38] In the same way, in 1688, Jesuit Father Francisco de Florencia published La Estrella del Norte de México, giving the history of the same apparitions.[39] Two separate accounts, one in Nahuatl from Juan Bautista del Barrio de San Juan from the 16th century,[40] and the other in Spanish by Servando Teresa de Mier[41] date the original apparition and native celebration on September 8 of the Julian calendar, but the latter also says that the Spaniards celebrate it on December 12 instead.[42] According to the document Informaciones Jurídicas de 1666, a Catholic feast day in name of Our Lady of Guadalupe was requested and approved, as well as the transfer of the date of the feast of the Virgin of Guadalupe from September 8 to December 12, the latest date on which the Virgin supposedly appeared to Juan Diego. The initiative to perform them was made by Francisco de Siles who proposed to ask the Church of Rome, a Mass itself with allusive text to the apparitions and stamping of the image, along with the divine office itself, and the precept of hearing a Catholic Mass on December 12, the last date of the apparitions of the Virgin to Juan Diego as the new date to commemorate the apparitions (which until then was on September 8, the birth of the Virgin).[43] In 1666, the Church in México began gathering information from people who reported having known Juan Diego, and in 1723 a formal investigation into his life was ordered, where more data was gathered to support his veneration. Because of the Informaciones Jurídicas de 1666 in the year 1754, the Sacred Congregation of Rites confirmed the true and valid value of the apparitions, and granted celebrating Mass and Office for the then Catholic version of the feast of Guadalupe on December 12.[44][45] These published accounts of the origin of the image already venerated in Tepeyac, then increased interest in the identity of Juan Diego, who was the original recipient of the prime vision. A new Catholic Basilica church was built to house the image. Completed in 1709, it is now known as the Old Basilica.[46] The image[which?] had originally featured a 12-point crown on the Virgin's head, but this disappeared in 1887–88. The change was first noticed on February 23, 1888, when the image was removed to a nearby church.[48] Eventually a painter confessed on his deathbed that he had been instructed by a clergyman to remove the crown. This may have been motivated by the fact that the gold paint was flaking off of the crown, leaving it looking dilapidated. But according to the historian David Brading, \"the decision to remove rather than replace the crown was no doubt inspired by a desire to 'modernize' the image and reinforce its similarity to the nineteenth-century images of the Immaculate Conception which were exhibited at Lourdes and elsewhere... What is rarely mentioned is that the frame which surrounded the canvas was adjusted to leave almost no space above the Virgin's head, thereby obscuring the effects of the erasure.\"[49] A different crown was installed to the image. On February 8, 1887, a Papal bull from Pope Leo XIII granted permission a Canonical Coronation of the image, which occurred on October 12, 1895.[50] Since then the Virgin of Guadalupe has been proclaimed \"Queen of Mexico\", \"Patroness of the Americas\", \"Empress of Latin America\", and \"Protectress of Unborn Children\" (the latter two titles given by Pope John Paul II in 1999).[51][52] On November 14, 1921, a bomb hidden within a basket of flowers and left under the tilma by an anti-Catholic secularist exploded and damaged the altar of the Basilica that houses the original image, but the tilma was unharmed. A brass standing crucifix, bent by the explosion, is now preserved at the shrine's museum and is believed to be miraculous by devotees.[53][54] Under Pope John Paul II the move to beatify Juan Diego intensified. John Paul II took a special interest in non-European Catholics and saints. During his leadership, the Congregation for the Causes of Saints declared Juan Diego \"venerable\" (in 1987), and the pope himself announced his beatification on May 6, 1990, during a Mass at the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico City, declaring him \"protector and advocate of the indigenous peoples\", with December 9 established as his feast day.[55] At that time historians revived doubts as to the quality of the evidence regarding Juan Diego. The writings of bishop Zumárraga, into whose hands Juan purportedly delivered the miraculous image, did not refer to him or the event. The record of the 1556 ecclesiastical inquiry omitted him, and he was not mentioned in documentation before the mid-17th century. In 1996 the 83-year-old abbot of the Basilica of Guadalupe, Guillermo Schulenburg, was forced to resign following an interview published in the Catholic magazine Ixthus, in which he was quoted as saying that Juan Diego was \"a symbol, not a reality\", and that his canonization would be the \"recognition of a cult. It is not recognition of the physical, real existence of a person.\"[56] In 1883 Joaquín García Icazbalceta, historian and biographer of Zumárraga, in a confidential report on the Lady of Guadalupe for Bishop Labastida, had been hesitant to support the story of the vision. He concluded that Juan Diego had not existed.[57] In 1995, Father Xavier Escalada, a Jesuit whose four volume Guadalupe encyclopedia had just been published, announced the existence of a sheet of parchment (known as Codex Escalada), which bore an illustrated account of the vision and some notations in Nahuatl concerning the life and death of Juan Diego. Previously unknown, the document was dated 1548. It bore the signatures of Antonio Valeriano and Bernardino de Sahagún, which are considered to verify its contents. The codex was the subject of an appendix to the Guadalupe encyclopedia, published in 1997.[15][pages needed][58] Some scholars remained unconvinced, one describing the discovery of the Codex as \"rather like finding a picture of St. Paul's vision of Christ on the road to Damascus, drawn by St. Luke and signed by St. Peter.\"[59] Skeptics, both from within the Catholic Church[60] as well as outside it, have doubted the historical veracity of the account of the Lady of Guadalupe, and it has been said[61] that \"[a]lmost every aspect of the story of Juan Diego has been called into question\". In particular, there is no contemporary documentary evidence for the apparition.[62] The main source, the Huei tlamahuiçoltica, was published in 1649; its time of writing is not known with certainty, but a formal inquiry into the image of Guadalupe was made in 1556 and does not mention the legend or its central character Juan Diego.[63] This has been cited in support of the claim that the Huei tlamahuiçoltica and the legend it narrates date to after that time.[64] The report of the 1556 investigation stated that the image had been painted by a native artist the previous year,[65][66] which would directly contradict the hypothesis of a supernatural origin in 1531. In the earliest account of the apparition, the Nican Mopohua, the Virgin de Guadalupe, later called as if the Virgin Mary tells Juan Bernardino, the uncle of Juan Diego, that the image left on the tilma is to be known by the name \"the Perfect Virgin, Holy Mary of Guadalupe\".[67] There have been various efforts to find a pre-Hispanic origin in the cult, including attempts to find a Nahuatl etymology to the name. The first theory to promote this Nahuatl origin was that of Luis Becerra Tanco.[68] In his 1675 work Felicidad de Mexico, Becerra Tanco said that Juan Bernardino and Juan Diego would not have been able to understand the name Guadalupe because the \"d\" and \"g\" sounds do not exist in Nahuatl.[68] He proposed two Nahuatl alternative names that sound similar to \"Guadalupe\", Tecuatlanopeuh [tekʷat͡ɬaˈnopeʍ], which he translates as \"she whose origins were in the rocky summit\", and Tecuantlaxopeuh [tekʷant͡ɬaˈʃopeʍ], \"she who banishes those who devoured us.\"[68] Ondina and Justo González suggest that the name is a Spanish version of the Nahuatl term, Coātlaxopeuh [koaːt͡ɬaˈʃopeʍ], which they interpret as meaning \"the one who crushes the serpent\", and that it may seem to be referring to the feathered serpent Quetzalcoatl. In addition, the Virgin Mary was portrayed in European art as crushing the serpent of the Garden of Eden.[69] Sahagún claimed that the Aztecs had previously worshiped the goddess Tonantzin (sometimes identified with Coatlícue or Cihuacoatl) at Tepeyac. He believed that the shrine to Our Lady of Guadalupe allowed them to continue their worship of Tonantzin, since they neglected other Marian shrines to come to Tepeyac.[70] The theory promoting the Spanish origin of the name says that: The image of Our Lady of Guadalupe is of a life-sized, dark-haired, olive-skinned young woman, standing with her head slightly inclined to her right, eyes downcast, and her hands held before her in prayer. She wears a pink dress ornamented with a floral design, a dark ribbon tied above her waist, and a blue-green mantle over all. The mantle is edged with gold and has golden stars throughout. She stands on a crescent moon, which is supported by an angel with eagle wings. She is surrounded by a golden sunburst.[71][72][73] The tilma now measures approximately 1.72 meters by 1.07 meters,[74] though sources vary by a few centimeters, and it shows signs of having been trimmed from the original size. It is made of two pieces of fabric sewn together with cotton thread.[75] There is a large crack running vertically through the middle of the image, as well as smaller horizontal cracks, caused by the image being folded at some point.[76] The image is currently housed in a golden frame above the main altar of the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico City, where it has been since the new basilica was completed in 1976.[77] The iconography of the Virgin is fully Catholic:[78] Miguel Sánchez, the author of the 1648 tract Imagen de la Virgen María, described her as the Woman of the Apocalypse from the New Testament's Revelation 12:1, \"clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars.\" She is described as a representation of the Immaculate Conception.[59] Virgil Elizondo says the image also had layers of meaning for the indigenous people of Mexico who associated her image with their polytheistic deities, which further contributed to her popularity.[79][80] Her blue-green mantle was the color reserved for the divine couple Ometecuhtli and Omecihuatl;[81] her belt is interpreted as a sign of pregnancy; and a cross-shaped image, symbolizing the cosmos and called nahui-ollin, is inscribed beneath the image's sash.[82] She was called \"mother of maguey\",[83] the source of the sacred beverage pulque.[84] Pulque was also known as \"the milk of the Virgin\".[85] The rays of light surrounding her are seen to also represent maguey spines.[83] The image and tilma have been examined numerous times over the years. In 1662, canons of the cathedral in Mexico City began the process of asking for a proper liturgy for Our Lady of Guadalupe on December 12. As part of this request, Rome asked for a canonical investigation into the apparitions. The canons carried out this investigation from 1665–1666,[86] including an examination of the image in March 1666.[87] On March 13, 1666, seven painters examined the image, accompanied by the viceroy and several clerics. The painters unanimously agreed that it was \"impossible that any artist could paint and work something so beautiful, clean, and well-formed on a fabric which is as rough as is the tilma\",[88][87] and that the image must therefore be miraculous. They also noted the degree of preservation of the image and tilma, and that the tilma had not been prepared for painting.[89] On March 28, three members of the protomédico of New Spain also examined the image. They also noted how well-preserved the image was given the local climate, and saw this as evidence of the image's supernatural origin.[90] In contrast, the silver of the moon and the gold on the sunburst, which had both been added to the original, were faded.[87] On April 30, 1751, a group of eight painters headed by José de Ibarra were allowed to examine the image. On April 15, 1752, one of the painters, Miguel Cabrera, was again allowed access to the image in order to create three copies.[91][92] In 1756, Cabrera published his account of the image, approved by the other painters, entitled Maravilla Americana.[92] Like the previous report, Cabrera noted the preservation of the image despite the climate. He said that the tilma was two pieces of cloth sewn together, and that it felt soft, probably made of ayate fibers rather than the coarser maguey, as others had claimed. He discovered signs of four different painting techniques which he claimed had never been used in combination before. He said that the image had not been sized, and thus the image could be seen through the back of the cloth, though all but a small portion of the back was covered with silver at the time.[93][94] In 1787, another group of painters examined the image at the request of José Ignacio Bartolache [es], a doctor and mathematician. They confirmed Cabrera's opinion that the fabric of the tilma was not coarse, but determined that it was of palm fibers. Contrary to Cabrera, however, they claimed that the image had been sized beforehand, and was not visible from behind; however, four years later, two of the painters claimed that they had never seen the back of the image and did not know if it had been sized.[95] The artists came to the conclusion that the parts of the image that were original were of divine origin, though they noted that there were some touch-ups that were clearly the work of human hands, the first study to so note.[95][92] Art restorer José Antonio Flores Gómez was hired by the abbot of the basilica to work on the image in 1947 and 1973. In a 2002 interview with the magazine Proceso, he spoke about his experience. He noted that he had not been required to keep silent about his work, but had done so of his own accord.[76] When he examined the image in 1947, he saw a large crack in the paint running vertically through the middle of the image, as well as some smaller horizontal cracks, which he thought were caused by the image having been folded. He also saw signs that others had touched up the image at various points. The necessity of touching up the image convinced him that it was of human origin.[76] Like others, Flores Gómez noted the softness of the tilma, which seemed to him more like cotton than the rougher agave traditionally claimed. He also said that the paints used in the image came from natural pigments, such as from the cochineal.[76] In 1981, Philip Serna Callahan and Jody Brant Smith examined the image under infrared light, a common technique in art analysis. They were unable to find any trace of sizing or sketching underneath the paint. They concluded that, while there had been additions to and touch-ups of the image, which were in a poor state, there was no explanation for the original parts of the image or their preservation.[96] In 1982, Guillermo Schulenburg, abbot of the basilica, hired José Sol Rosales of the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes y Literatura to study the image. Sol Rosales thought that the tilma was made of linen and hemp, and not either agave or cotton. Contrary to previous claims, he said that the fabric had been prepared with white paint before the image had been painted. He saw several different styles of tempera throughout the image. He held that the paints were made from various natural pigments, and further noted that all of these pigments were commonly available in 16th-century Mexico. Like Flores Gómez, Sol Rosales saw various touch-ups and repainting throughout the image.[97] Sol Rosales concluded that the image was of human origin. He claimed that others, like Cabrera, had had similar findings, but concluded that the image was divine due to social pressures.[97] Sol Rosales and his team were supervised during the investigation by Schulenburg and others. Schulenburg sent the results of this study to the Vatican, cautioning against the canonization of Juan Diego.[76] Several studies have examined the eyes of the image. The authors of these studies claim that they have found images in the eyes corresponding to the people believed to have been present when Juan Diego opened his tilma before the bishop. The eyes are also claimed to contain Purkinje images exactly where they would be expected to be found in living eyes.[98] Critics of these studies liken the figures to inkblots in which proponents see what they hope to see.[99] Juan Diego's tilma has become Mexico's most popular religious and cultural symbol, and has received widespread ecclesiastical and popular veneration. In the 19th century it became the rallying cry of the Spaniards born in America, in what they denominated 'New Spain'. They said they considered the apparitions as legitimizing their own indigenous Mexican origin. They infused it with an almost messianic sense of mission and identity, thereby also justifying their armed rebellion against Spain.[100][101] Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe became a recognized symbol of Catholic Mexicans. Miguel Sánchez, the author in 1648 of the first published account of the vision, identified Guadalupe as Revelation's Woman of the Apocalypse, and said: ... this New World has been won and conquered by the hand of the Virgin Mary ... who had prepared, disposed, and contrived her exquisite likeness in this, her Mexican land, which was conquered for such a glorious purpose, won that there should appear so Mexican an image.[59] Throughout the Mexican national history of the 19th and 20th centuries, the Guadalupan name and image have been unifying national symbols; the first President of Mexico (1824–1829) changed his name from José Miguel Ramón Adaucto Fernández y Félix to Guadalupe Victoria in honor of the Virgin of Guadalupe.[102] Father Miguel Hidalgo, in the Mexican War of Independence (1810), and Emiliano Zapata, in the Mexican Revolution (1910), led their respective armed forces with Guadalupan flags emblazoned with an image of Our Lady of Guadalupe.[103] In 1999, the Church officially proclaimed her the Patroness of the Americas, the Empress of Latin America, and the Protectress of Unborn Children.[104] In 1810, Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla initiated the bid for Mexican independence with his Grito de Dolores, with the cry \"Death to the Spaniards and long live the Virgin of Guadalupe!\" When Hidalgo's mestizo-indigenous army attacked Guanajuato and Valladolid, they placed \"the image of the Virgin of Guadalupe, which was the insignia of their enterprise, on sticks or on reeds painted different colors\" and \"they all wore a print of the Virgin on their hats.\"[102] After Hidalgo's death, leadership of the revolution fell to a mestizo priest named José María Morelos, who led insurgent troops in the Mexican south. Morelos adopted the Virgin as the seal of his Congress of Chilpancingo, inscribing her feast day into the Chilpancingo constitution and declaring that Guadalupe was the power behind his victories: New Spain puts less faith in its own efforts than in the power of God and the intercession of its Blessed Mother, who appeared within the precincts of Tepeyac as the miraculous image of Guadalupe that had come to comfort us, defend us, visibly be our protection.[102] Simón Bolívar noticed the Guadalupan theme in these uprisings, and shortly before Morelos's execution in 1815 wrote: \"the leaders of the independence struggle have put fanaticism to use by proclaiming the famous Virgin of Guadalupe as the queen of the patriots, praying to her in times of hardship and displaying her on their flags... the veneration for this image in Mexico far exceeds the greatest reverence that the shrewdest prophet might inspire.\"[59] In 1912, Emiliano Zapata's peasant army rose out of the south against the government of Francisco Madero. Though Zapata's rebel forces were primarily interested in land reform—\"tierra y libertad\" ('land and liberty') was the slogan of the uprising—when his peasant troops penetrated Mexico City, they carried Guadalupan banners.[105] More recently, the contemporary Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN) named their \"mobile city\" in honor of the Virgin: it is called Guadalupe Tepeyac. EZLN spokesperson Subcomandante Marcos wrote a humorous letter in 1995 describing the EZLN bickering over what to do with a Guadalupe statue they had received as a gift.[106] Harringon argues that: The Aztecs... had an elaborate, coherent symbolic system for making sense of their lives. When this was destroyed by the Spaniards, something new was needed to fill the void and make sense of New Spain ... the image of Guadalupe served that purpose.[107] According to the traditional account, the name of Guadalupe, as the name was heard or understood by Spaniards, was chosen by the Virgin herself when she appeared on the hill outside Mexico City in 1531, ten years after the Conquest.[108] Guadalupe continues to be a mixture of the cultures which blended to form Mexico, both racially and religiously,[109] \"the first mestiza\",[110] or \"the first Mexican\",[111] \"bringing together people of distinct cultural heritages, while at the same time affirming their distinctness.\"[112] As Jacques Lafaye wrote in Quetzalcoatl and Guadalupe, \"as the Christians built their first churches with the rubble and the columns of the ancient pagan temples, so they often borrowed pagan customs for their own cult purposes.\"[113] The author Judy King asserts that Guadalupe is a \"common denominator\" uniting Mexicans. Writing that Mexico is composed of a vast patchwork of differences—linguistic, ethnic, and class-based—King says \"The Virgin of Guadalupe is the rubber band that binds this disparate nation into a whole.\"[111] The Mexican novelist, Carlos Fuentes, once said that \"you cannot truly be considered a Mexican unless you believe in the Virgin of Guadalupe.\"[114] Nobel Literature laureate Octavio Paz wrote in 1974 that \"The Mexican people, after more than two centuries of experiments and defeats, have faith only in the Virgin of Guadalupe and the National Lottery.\"[115] The shrine of the Virgin of Guadalupe is the most visited Catholic pilgrimage destination in the world. Over the Friday and Saturday of December 11 to 12, 2009, a record number of 6.1 million pilgrims visited the Basilica of Guadalupe in Mexico City to commemorate the anniversary of the apparition.[116] Religious imagery of Our Lady of Guadalupe appears in Roman Catholic parishes, especially those with Latin American heritage.[117] In addition, due to the growth of Hispanic communities in the United States, religious imagery of Our Lady of Guadalupe has started appearing in some Anglican, Lutheran, and Methodist churches.[117] The Virgin of Guadalupe is considered the Patroness of Mexico and the Continental Americas; she is also venerated by Native Americans, on the account of the devotion calling for the conversion of the Americas.[118] Due to Mary's appearance as a pregnant mother and her claims as mother of all in the apparition, the Blessed Virgin Mary, under this title is popularly invoked as Patroness of the Unborn and a common image for the Pro-Life movement.[119][120][121] Due to her association as a crusader of social justice, the image of Our Lady of Guadalupe has been utilized as a symbol across regions to advance political movements and mobilize the masses. For instance, the image has most notably been utilized in Mexico's Independence movement in the early 19th century, the United Farm Worker Movement in the U.S. in the 20th century and in contemporary political causes like immigration.[135][136] In Mexico's Independence, the image of Our Lady of Guadalupe became associated with the movement after Father Miguel Hidalgo rallied and united insurgents under her banner. In fact, the first president of the Mexican republic, José Miguel Ramón Adaucto Fernández y Félix, who was heavily involved in Mexico's Independence war, changed his name as to Guadalupe Victoria as a sign of devotion.[137][136] In the United Farm Workers Union (UFW), its leader, Cesar Chavez, was a devout Catholic who drew on his religious beliefs to demand for better wages and labor practices for farm workers in the U.S.[138] He incorporated his religious beliefs in the movement by holding masses in the picket lines and prayers before meetings, and leading a pilgrimage from Delano to Sacramento in 1966 during Lent.[138] Similarly to Mexico's Independence movement, the famous pilgrimage in 1966 that drew national attention to the cause was lead under a banner with the image of Our Lady of Guadalupe.[139] The image of Our Lady of Guadalupe is also present in the contemporary political discussion on immigration. Artists like Ester Hernandez and Consuelo Jimenez Underwood embed or reimagine her image on artworks that comment on immigration politics. For instance, Ester Hernandez's screen print titled Wanted (2010) and Consuelo Jimenez Underwood's Sacred Jump (1994) and Virgen de los Caminos (1994).[140][141][136] One notable reference in literature to the image and its alleged predecessor, the Aztec Earth goddess Tonantzin, is in Sandra Cisneros' short story \"Little Miracles, Kept Promises\", from her collection Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories (1991). Cisneros' story is constructed out of brief notes that people give Our Lady of Guadalupe in thanks for favors received, which in Cisneros' hands becomes a portrait of an extended Chicano community living throughout Texas. \"Little Miracles\" ends with an extended narrative (pp. 124–129) of a feminist artist, Rosario \"Chayo\" de León, who at first did not allow images of La Virgen de Guadalupe in her home because she associated her with subservience and suffering, particularly by Mexican women. But when she learns that Guadalupe's shrine is built on the same hill in Mexico City that had a shrine to Tonantzin, the Aztec Earth goddess and serpent destroyer, Chayo comes to understand that there's a deep, syncretic connection between the Aztec goddess and the Mexican saint; together they inspire Chayo's new artistic creativity, inner strength, and independence. In Chayo's words, \"I finally understood who you are. No longer Mary the mild, but our mother Tonantzin. Your church at Tepeyac built on the site of her temple\" (128).[142] The image and its alleged apparition was investigated several times, including in the 2013 documentary The Blood & The Rose, directed by Tim Watkins.[143] Drawing on the significance of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Chicano culture, many Chicano artists revere her image and visually reimagine the religious figure within a feminist and contemporary context.[144][145][141] More than just a religious symbol, Chicano artists view Our Lady of Guadalupe as an empowering feminist icon and a proclamation of Indigenous pride. However, these re-envisioned artworks have not been without controversy, as many artists have faced intense backlash from Catholic groups who view these artworks as \"disrespectful and irreverent\".[146] One of the most famous controversies was sparked by Alma López's Our Lady digital collage, which later led to a book titled Our Lady of Controversy: Alma López's Irreverent Apparition.[147][148] Despite this, Chicano artists such as Yolanda López, Alma López, Margarita 'Mita' Cuaron, Ester Hernández, and Consuelo Jimenez Underwood, among others, have used Our Lady of Guadalupe's portrait to explore themes of repression, feminine strength, and to uplift women.[149][150]",

                "content": "Our editors will review what you’ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article. Our Lady of Guadalupe, in Roman Catholicism, the Virgin Mary in her appearance before St. Juan Diego in four visions in 1531. The name also refers to the Marian apparition itself. Our Lady of Guadalupe holds a special place in the religious life of Mexico and is one of the most popular religious devotions. Her image, of a woman of mixed Indigenous and European features (mestiza) wearing a turquoise-colored mantle surrounded by a sunburst, has played an important role as a national symbol of Mexico. According to tradition, Mary appeared to Juan Diego, who was an Aztec convert to Christianity, on four occasions between December 9 and December 12, 1531. During her first apparition she requested that a shrine to her be built on the spot where she appeared, Tepeyac Hill (now in a suburb of Mexico City). However, the local bishop hesitated to act on this request. Mary appeared to Juan Diego a second time on December 9 after his meeting that day with the bishop and told him to return and try again. On December 10 Juan Diego met with the bishop, who this time demanded a sign before he would approve construction of a church. Mary then appeared a third time to Juan Diego, who told her of the bishop’s demand for a sign. On December 12, she made her fourth appearance, ordering Juan Diego to collect roses from the hill and bring them to the bishop. Miraculously, there were roses blooming on the hill, despite it being winter. Moreover, the roses were native to Castile, a region in Spain that was the homeland of the bishop. In his audience with the bishop on that day, Juan Diego opened his tilma (cloak), letting dozens of roses fall to the floor and revealing the image of Mary imprinted on the inside of the cloak—the image that is now venerated in the Basilica of Guadalupe. Mary is also said to have appeared to Juan Diego’s dying uncle, Juan Bernardino, and restored him to health. The traditional view has been questioned by various scholars and ecclesiastics, including the former abbot of the Basilica of Guadalupe. The primary objection is that there is no documentary evidence for the apparition until 1648; critics claim that documents purporting to be from the 16th century are actually from the 17th. Critics have also noted that the bishop approached by Juan Diego was not consecrated until 1534, and he makes no mention of Juan Diego or of Our Lady of Guadalupe in his writings. Defenders of the Virgin of Guadalupe—including Pope John Paul II, who canonized Juan Diego and declared Our Lady of Guadalupe the patroness of the Americas—accept the authenticity of the early documents and point also to various oral accounts of the apparition. John Paul II’s actions were only the latest in a series of developments affirming the importance of Our Lady of Guadalupe. A shrine to the Virgin has existed on the site since at least 1556, when the archbishop of New Spain promoted devotion to the image of Mary at a chapel in Tepeyac. The image was described by an English prisoner in Mexico City in 1568, and by the end of the 16th century Our Lady of Guadalupe formed part of a wide network of shrines to the Virgin throughout Mexico. The story of Mary’s appearance to Juan Diego was codified in the work of Miquel Sánchez in 1648, and an account in the Indigenous language (Nahuatl) was published in 1649 and widely accepted as accurate. The devotion continued to grow, especially after Our Lady of Guadalupe was credited with ending a deadly epidemic of hemorrhagic fever that ravaged Mexico City in 1736–37. In 1737 Our Lady of Guadalupe was proclaimed patroness of Mexico City, and in 1746 her patronage was accepted by all the territories of New Spain, which included part of present-day California as well as Mexico and regions as far south as Guatemala and El Salvador. In 1754 Pope Benedict XIV approved her patronage and granted her a proper feast and mass for December 12. Pope Pius X proclaimed her patroness of Latin America in 1910, and in 1935 Pius XI approved her patronage over the Philippines. Veneration of Our Lady of Guadalupe has been particularly strong among women, especially in Mexico, and since at least the early 18th century the devotion was spread throughout the world by the Jesuits and other religious. Our Lady of Guadalupe’s role in Mexican history is not limited to religious matters; she has played an important role in Mexican nationalism and identity. In 1810 Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla promoted her as the patroness of the revolt he led against the Spanish. The image of the Virgin of Guadalupe appeared on the rebels’ banners, and the rebels’ battle cry was “Long Live Our Lady of Guadalupe.” During a religious revival in Mexico in the late 19th century, preachers declared that the foundation of Mexico could be dated to the time of the apparition of Our Lady of Guadalupe, because she freed the people from idolatry and reconciled the Spanish and Indigenous peoples in a common devotion. Emiliano Zapata’s peasant rebels carried the banner of Our Lady when they entered Mexico City in 1914, and, during the civil war in Mexico in 1926–29, the banners of the rebels bore her image. Our Lady of Guadalupe’s continuing significance as a religious and national symbol is attested by the hundreds of thousands of pilgrims who visit her shrine in Mexico City every year. Additionally, the image of her that appears on St. Juan Diego’s tilma has been interpreted by some scholars as containing elements that hold particular meaning to Mexican and Indigenous people. Notably, these elements combine European Roman Catholic symbolism with imagery from the Aztec religion.",

                "content": "By Francesca Merlo The Virgin of Guadalupe, like the shroud of Turin, appears on a piece of fabric. Both are sacred objects, hundreds of years old, and both depict an image said to be miraculous. The Virgin of Guadalupe was declared Queen of Mexico and is Patron of the Americas. Our Lady of Guadalupe first introduced herself as the Mother of God and the mother of all humanity when she appeared on the hill of Tepeyac in Mexico in 1531. An indigenous peasant, Juan Diego, saw a glowing figure on the hill. After she had identified herself to him, Our Lady asked that Juan build her a shrine in that same spot, in order for her to show and share her love and compassion with all those who believe. Afterwards, Juan Diego visited Juan de Zumárraga, who was Archbishop of what is now Mexico City. Zumárraga dismissed him in disbelief and asked that the future Saint provide proof of his story and proof of the Lady’s identity. Juan Diego returned to the hill and encountered Our Lady again. The Virgin told him to climb to the top of the hill and pick some flowers to present to the Archbishop. Although it was winter and nothing should have been in bloom, Juan Diego found an abundance of flowers of a type he had never seen before. The Virgin bundled the flowers into Juan's cloak, known as a tilma. When Juan Diego presented the tilma of exotic flowers to Zumárraga, the flowers fell out and he recognised them as Castilian roses, which are not found in Mexico. What was even more significant, however, was that the tilma had been miraculously imprinted with a colorful image of the Virgin herself. This actual tilma, preserved since that date and showing the familiar image of the Virgin Mary with her head bowed and hands together in prayer, represents the Virgin of Guadalupe. It remains perhaps the most sacred object in all of Mexico. The story is best known from a manuscript written in the Aztec’s native language Nahuatl by the scholar Antonio Valeriano. It was written sometime after 1556. Over 20 million people visit the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe each year, now situated on the very same hill on which she appeared. In 1990, Pope Saint John Paul II visited Mexico and beatified Juan Diego. 10 years later, in the year 2000, he was declared a Saint. Thank you for reading our article.

                "content": "The Story of Our Lady of Guadalupe The feast in honor of Our Lady of Guadalupe goes back to the 16th century. Chronicles of that period tell us the story. A poor Indian named Cuauhtlatohuac was baptized and given the name Juan Diego. He was a 57-year-old widower, and lived in a small village near Mexico City. On Saturday morning December 9, 1531, he was on his way to a nearby barrio to attend Mass in honor of Our Lady. Juan was walking by a hill called Tepeyac when he heard beautiful music like the warbling of birds. A radiant cloud appeared, and within it stood an Indian maiden dressed like an Aztec princess. The lady spoke to him in his own language and sent him to the bishop of Mexico, a Franciscan named Juan de Zumarraga. The bishop was to build a chapel in the place where the lady appeared. Eventually the bishop told Juan to have the lady give him a sign. About this same time Juan’s uncle became seriously ill. This led poor Juan to try to avoid the lady. Nevertheless the lady found Juan, assured him that his uncle would recover, and provided roses for Juan to carry to the bishop in his cape or tilma. On December 12, when Juan Diego opened his tilma in the bishop’s presence, the roses fell to the ground, and the bishop sank to his knees. On the tilma where the roses had been appeared an image of Mary exactly as she had appeared at the hill of Tepeyac. Reflection Mary’s appearance to Juan Diego as one of his people is a powerful reminder that Mary—and the God who sent her—accept all peoples. In the context of the sometimes rude and cruel treatment of the Indians by the Spaniards, the apparition was a rebuke to the Spaniards and an event of vast significance for the indigenous population. While a number of them had converted before this incident, they now came in droves. According to a contemporary chronicler, nine million Indians became Catholic in a very short time. In these days when we hear so much about God’s preferential option for the poor, Our Lady of Guadalupe cries out to us that God’s love for and identification with the poor is an age-old truth that stems from the Gospel itself.
