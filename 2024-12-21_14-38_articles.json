                "content": "The Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team is the college football team representing the University of Notre Dame in Notre Dame, Indiana, north of the city of South Bend, Indiana. The team plays its home games at the campus's Notre Dame Stadium, which has a capacity of 77,622. Notre Dame is one of three schools that competes as an Independent at the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) level; however, they play five games a year against opponents from the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), of which Notre Dame is a member in all other sports except ice hockey.[5] The Fighting Irish are among the most prestigious college football teams of all time. Since their inaugural season in 1887, Notre Dame has claimed 11 national championships, including 8 from the major wire-service: AP Poll and/or Coaches' Poll.[6] Seven Notre Dame players have won the Heisman Trophy. Notre Dame has 948 official victories, with an additional 21 having been vacated by the NCAA in 2016 for self-reported academic misconduct.[7] Notre Dame has had 22 undefeated seasons including 12 perfect seasons.[8] Notre Dame home games have been televised by NBC since 1991.[9][10] Football did not have an auspicious beginning at the University of Notre Dame. In their inaugural game on November 23, 1887, the Irish lost to Michigan by a score of 8–0.[11] Their first win came in the final game of the 1888 season when the Irish defeated Harvard Prep School of Chicago by a score of 20–0.[12] At the end of the 1888 season, they had a record of 1–3 with all three losses being at the hands of Michigan. Between 1887 and 1899, Notre Dame compiled a record of 31 wins, 15 losses, and 4 ties against a diverse variety of opponents ranging from local high school teams to other universities.[13] In 1894, James L. Morrison was hired as Notre Dame's first head football coach.[14] Notre Dame took a significant step toward respectability, prominence, and stability when they hired Morrison.[15] He wrote an acquaintance after his first day on the job: \"I arrived here [Notre Dame] this morning and found about as green a set of football players that ever donned a uniform... They want to smoke, and when I told them that they would have to run and get up some wind, they thought I was rubbing it in on them. \"One big, strong cuss remarked that it was too much like work. Well, maybe you think I didn't give him hell! I bet you a hundred no one ever makes a remark like that again.\"[15] In 1908, the win over Franklin saw end Fay Wood catch the first touchdown pass in Notre Dame history.[16] Notre Dame continued its success near the turn of the century and achieved their first victory over Michigan in 1909 by the score of 11–3, after which Michigan refused to play Notre Dame again for 33 years. By the end of the 1912 season they had amassed a record of 108 wins, 31 losses, and 13 ties.[17] Jesse Harper became head coach in 1913, coaching for five years until retiring in 1917.[18] During his tenure, the Irish began playing only intercollegiate games and posted a record of 34 wins, five losses, and one tie.[19] This period would also mark the beginning of the rivalry with Army and the continuation of rivalry with Michigan State.[20][21] In an effort to gain respect for a regionally successful but small-time Midwestern football program, Harper scheduled games in his first season with national powerhouses Texas, Penn State, and Army.[22] That year, Notre Dame burst into the national consciousness and helped to transform the collegiate game in a single contest. On November 1, 1913, the Notre Dame squad stunned the Black Knights of the Hudson 35–13 in a game played at West Point.[23] Led by quarterback Gus Dorais and end Knute Rockne, the Notre Dame team attacked the Cadets with an offense that featured both the expected powerful running game but also long and accurate downfield forward passes from Dorais to Rockne. This game has been miscredited as the invention of the forward pass.[24] Prior to this contest, receivers would come to a full stop and wait on the ball to come to them, but in this contest, Dorais threw to Rockne in stride, changing the forward pass from a seldom-used play into the dominant ball-moving strategy that it is today.[24][23] Irish assistant Knute Rockne became head coach in 1918.[25] During his 13 years, the Irish won three national championships, had five undefeated seasons, won the Rose Bowl in 1925,[26] and produced players such as George Gipp and the \"Four Horsemen\".[27] Rockne's offenses employed the Notre Dame Box and his defenses ran a 7–2–2 scheme.[28][29] Rockne took over in the war-torn season of 1918[30] He made his coaching debut on September 28, 1918, against Case Tech in Cleveland, Ohio, and earned a 26–6 victory.[31] Leonard Bahan, George Gipp, and Curly Lambeau were in the backfield.[32][33] With Gipp, Rockne had an ideal handler of the forward pass.[34][35] The Irish posted a 3–1–2 record for the season, losing only to the Michigan Agricultural Aggies. The 1919 team had Rockne handle the line and Gus Dorais handle the backfield.[36] The Irish went undefeated and were one of four teams to be selected for the national championship, although Notre Dame does not claim it.[37][38] Gipp died at age 25 on December 14, 1920,[39] just two weeks after Walter Camp elected him as Notre Dame's first All-American.[40][39] Gipp likely contracted strep throat and pneumonia while giving punting lessons after his final game on November 20 against Northwestern.[40] Since antibiotics were not available in the 1920s, treatment options for such infections were limited and they could be fatal even to young, healthy individuals.[41] Rockne was speaking to Gipp on his hospital bed when he was purported to have delivered the famous \"Win one for the Gipper\" line.[42][39][43][44][45] John Mohardt led the 1921 Notre Dame team to a 10–1 record with 781 rushing yards, 995 passing yards, 12 rushing touchdowns, and nine passing touchdowns.[46] Grantland Rice wrote that \"Mohardt could throw the ball to within a foot or two of any given space\" and noted that the 1921 Notre Dame team \"was the first team we know of to build its attack around a forward passing game, rather than use a forward passing game as a mere aid to the running game.\"[47] Mohardt had both Eddie Anderson and Roger Kiley at end to receive his passes.[48][49] The national champion 1924 team included the \"Four Horsemen\" backfield of Harry Stuhldreher, Don Miller, Jim Crowley, and Elmer Layden.[50][51] The line was known as the \"Seven Mules\".[52] The Irish capped an undefeated, 10–0 season with a victory over Stanford in the Rose Bowl.[26] The 1926 team beat Army and was led by Christie Flanagan,[53][54] but was undone by a loss to Carnegie Tech in the penultimate game of the season. In this game, Rockne made what an Associated Press writer called \"one of the greatest coaching blunders in history\" by traveling to Chicago for the Army–Navy Game to \"write newspaper articles about it, as well as select an All-America football team.\" Carnegie Tech used the coach's absence as motivation for a 19–0 win; the upset likely cost the Irish a chance for a national title.[55] The 1928 team lost to national champion Georgia Tech.[56] \"I sat at Grant Field and saw a magnificent Notre Dame team suddenly recoil before the furious pounding of one man–Peter Pund,\" said Rockne. \"Nobody could stop him. I counted 20 scoring plays that this man ruined.\"[57] Among the events that occurred during Rockne's tenure none may be more famous than the Rockne's \"Win one for the Gipper\" speech.[58] Army came into the 1928 matchup undefeated and was the clear favorite.[59] Notre Dame, on the other hand, was having their worst season under Rockne's leadership and entered the game with a 4–2 record.[59] At the end of the half Army was leading and looked to be in command of the game. Rockne entered the locker room and gave his account of Gipp's final words: \"I've got to go, Rock. It's all right. I'm not afraid. Some time, Rock, when the team is up against it, when things are going wrong and the breaks are beating the boys, tell them to go in there with all they've got and win just one for the Gipper. I don't know where I'll be then, Rock. But I'll know about it, and I'll be happy.\"[60] The speech inspired the team and they went on to upset Army and win the game 12–6.[61] The 1929 and 1930 teams both went undefeated,[62][63] winning national championships,[64][65] and the 1930 team was led by the likes of Frank Carideo, Joe Savoldi, Marchy Schwartz and Marty Brill.[65] It featured the first and only example of all four members of a backfield being named to an All-American team during the same season. The 1929 team played all of its games on the road while the new Notre Dame Stadium was being built.[66] In 1930, \"Jumping Joe\" Savoldi scored the first Notre Dame touchdown in the new stadium on a 98-yard kickoff return.[67] Savoldi is also known as \"the first hero in the lore of Notre Dame's Stadium\" based on scoring three touchdowns in the official stadium dedication game against Navy the following week.[68] Rockne coached his last game on December 14, 1930, when he led a group of Notre Dame all-stars against the New York Giants in New York City.[69][70] The game raised funds for the Mayor's Relief Committee for the unemployed and needy of the city.[71] 50,000 fans turned out to see the reunited \"Four Horsemen\" along with players from Rockne's other championship teams take the field against the pros.[72] On March 31, 1931, Rockne died at age 43 in the crash of a Transcontinental & Western Air airliner in Kansas; he was on his way to help in the production of the film The Spirit of Notre Dame.[73][74][75] The crash site is located in a remote expanse of Kansas known as the Flint Hills and now features a Rockne Memorial.[76] As Notre Dame's head coach from 1918 to 1930, Rockne posted what has remained for decades the all-time highest winning percentage (.881) for a football coach in the NCAA's flagship FBS division.[77][78] During his 13-year tenure as head coach of the Fighting Irish, Rockne collected 105 victories, 12 losses, 5 ties and 3 national championships.[79][80] Rockne also coached Notre Dame to 5 undefeated and untied seasons.[79][80] Through game broadcasts during the Golden Age of Radio, Notre Dame football gained a nationwide following of \"subway alumni\", Catholics who became fans whether or not they attended the university.[81] Former Saint Louis head coach Heartley \"Hunk\" Anderson was promoted from assistant coach and took the helm of the Irish after Knute Rockne's death, leading them to a record of 16 wins, nine losses, and two ties.[82] Anderson was a former Irish player under Rockne and was serving as an assistant coach at the time of Rockne's death. Notre Dame finished 6–2–1 in 1931.[83] The Irish lost a heartbreaker by a score of 16–14 to USC on November 21 that snapped the program's 26-game unbeaten streak.[84] 1933 was a tough year for the Irish as they finished with a 3–5–2 record, the first losing season for the program since 1888. ND suffered a four-game losing streak, failing to score a point in all four losses to Carnegie Tech, Pittsburgh, Navy, and Purdue.[85] Anderson resigned as Irish head coach after the 1933 season to accept the position of head football coach at NC State.[86] Anderson was replaced by Elmer Layden, who was one of Rockne's \"Four Horsemen\" in the 1920s. After graduating, Layden played professional football for one year and then began a coaching career.[87] Layden's 1935 squad posted one of the greatest wins in school history by rallying to defeat Ohio State by a score of 18–13 in a game billed as the \"Game of the Century\".[88][89] His 1938 team finished 8–1, losing only to USC in the season finale.[90] This loss cost them a possible consensus national championship, but the team was named national champion by the Dickinson System.[91] Like Rockne before him, Layden was a goodwill ambassador for Notre Dame during his time as head coach.[92][93] He was able to schedule a home-and-home series with Michigan after meeting with Fielding H. Yost, healing a rift between the two schools.[94] The two teams had not met since 1909, when, after eight straight losses to the Wolverines, the Irish posted their first win.[95][96] They were scheduled to meet again in 1910, but Michigan canceled the game and refused to play the Irish again.[96] By the time they met again in 1943, Layden had left Notre Dame and Frank Leahy had taken his place.[96] The Irish posted a record of 47 wins, 13 losses, and three ties in seven years under Layden,[97] the most successful record of a Notre Dame coach not to win a national championship.[98] He left Notre Dame after the 1940 season to become Commissioner of the National Football League.[98][87] Boston College head coach Frank Leahy was hired by Notre Dame to take over for Layden in 1941 and was another former Irish player who played during the Rockne era. After graduating from Notre Dame, Leahy held several coaching positions, including line coach of the Seven Blocks of Granite of Fordham University that helped that team win all but two of their games between 1935 and 1937.[99] He then coached the Boston College Eagles to a win in the 1941 Sugar Bowl and a share of the national championship.[100][101] His move to Notre Dame began a new period of gridiron success for the Irish and ensured Leahy's place among the winningest coaches in the history of college football.[102] Leahy coached the team for 11 seasons from 1941 to 1943 and 1946 to 1953.[99] After finishing in the AP top 10 each of his first two seasons, Leahy's 1943 team went 9–1 and captured Notre Dame's fourth national championship (and first since the advent of the AP Poll). Quarterback Angelo Bertelli became Notre Dame's first Heisman Trophy winner. From 1944 to 1945, Leahy served in the U.S. Navy during World War II and was honorably discharged as a captain.[103] Edward McKeever, Leahy's assistant coach, became interim head coach when Leahy left for the Navy.[104] During 1944, his one year at the helm, the Irish managed 8 wins and 2 losses.[105] McKeever left Notre Dame in 1945 to take over as head coach of Cornell.[106] For the 1945 season, he was replaced by Hugh Devore, who led the Irish to a 7–2–1 record.[107] Upon Leahy's return in 1946 and due to his status as a veteran himself, the Irish heavily recruited returning veterans who were often much older than incoming freshmen. Largely thanks to this influx of talent, Notre Dame went four consecutive seasons after World War II without losing a game, winning the 1946, 1947, and 1949 national championships in the process.[108] The 1946 game against Army, ending in a 0–0 tie, pitted two of the greatest teams of all time against each other and included three consecutive Heisman Trophy winners (Army's Doc Blanchard and Glenn Davis and Notre Dame's Johnny Lujack, who quarterbacked the 1946 and 1947 Irish). The 1948 team missed out on a national championship due only to a 14–14 tie at USC in the final game of the season. In 1949, Notre Dame went unbeaten and untied for the second time in three seasons behind Heisman Trophy-winning end Leon Hart, who would later be selected first overall in the 1950 NFL Draft. A fifth national championship was lost because of a 1953 tie against Iowa, in a game that featured 1953 Heisman Trophy winner Johnny Lattner[109] that caused a minor scandal at the time, when it appeared that some Irish players had faked injuries to stop the clock, leading some to nickname those players the \"Fainting Irish\".[110][111][112] Leahy retired in 1954 reportedly due to health issues.[113] Perhaps the best example of this occurred during the Georgia Tech game in 1953. Leahy fell ill during the game, which led to him collapsing during halftime.[114][self-published source] The situation was so dire that a priest was called in to give Leahy Catholic last rites.[115] However, Leahy recovered, and the consequent diagnosis was that he was suffering from nervous tension and pancreatitis.[116] Leahy has the second highest winning percentage (.864) of any college coach in history. He led the Irish to a record of 87 wins, 11 losses, and nine ties including 39 consecutive games without a loss (37–0–2), four national championships, and six undefeated seasons.[102][117] The departure of Frank Leahy ushered in a downward slope in Notre Dame's performance.[118] 25-year old assistant coach Terry Brennan was hired as Frank Leahy's successor as the Notre Dame head coach in 1954 and would stay until 1958. Brennan was a former player under Leahy. Before joining the Irish, he had coached the Mount Carmel High School team in Chicago.[119] His first two seasons the Irish were ranked fourth and ninth respectively in the AP poll, with a loss to Purdue the only blemish on the 1954 team's schedule.[119][120] It was the 1956 season that began to darken Brennan's reputation, for it became one of the most dismal in the team's history and saw them finish the season with a mere two wins, including losses to Michigan State, Oklahoma, and Iowa.[121] One bright spot in the 1956 season was the awarding of the Heisman Trophy to Paul Hornung, who would go on to a legendary NFL career with the Green Bay Packers. Hornung is the only Heisman winner to win the award while playing for a team that had a losing record.[122] The Irish would recover the following season, posting a record of 7–3[123] and including in their wins a stunning upset of Oklahoma, in Norman, Oklahoma, that ended the Sooners' still-standing record of 47 consecutive wins.[124] In Brennan's final season, though, the Irish finished 6–4,[125] leading to Brennan's firing in mid-December.[126] Brennan's tenure can only be properly framed with the understanding that in a time of zero scholarship limitations in college football, Notre Dame's administration inexplicably began a process of de-emphasizing football, severely cutting scholarships and hindering Brennan from building a roster of any meaningful depth.[127] He departed with a total of 32 wins and 18 losses.[128] Former San Francisco, Chicago Cardinals and Washington Redskins head coach Joe Kuharich took the head coaching position at Notre Dame in 1959, realizing a longtime ambition to return to his alma mater.[129][130] He had earlier been courted by Notre Dame after the 1956 season, after the Irish finished 2–8, but before he had a chance to accept an offer, Terry Brennan was given a reprieve.[131] Kuharich brought a professional touch to Irish football, putting shamrocks on the players' helmets and shoulder stripes on their jerseys.[131][132] However, his tenure became one of the worst stretches in program history, including a school-record eight-game losing streak in 1960, a year in which the Irish finished 2–8.[133] The consensus opinion was that Kuharich never made the adjustment from pro football to college football, attempting to use complicated pro coaching techniques with collegiate players, and never adapted to the limited substitution rules in effect at the time, having big, immobile linemen playing both ways in an era where smaller, quicker players were preferred. He often said, \"You win some and you lose some\", and seemed perfectly content finishing 5–5 every year. This did not sit well with the Irish faithful, who expected Notre Dame to beat everybody.[134] When the pressure of winning became too much to bear, Kuharich resigned in the spring of 1963 and assumed the post of supervisor of NFL officials.[131] Because it was so late in the spring, the freshman team's coach Hugh Devore was named head coach for the 1963 season while the search for a permanent replacement was being conducted.[135] Kuharich compiled a 17–23 record over four non-winning seasons and remains to this day the only coach ever to have an overall losing record at Notre Dame. Despite his unsuccessful tenure, Kuharich remains the only Irish coach to post back-to-back shutouts over their greatest rival, the USC Trojans, in 1960 (17–0) and 1961 (30–0).[136] In 1964, Ara Parseghian left his job as the Northwestern head football coach when he was hired to take over the coaching duties at Notre Dame.[137] He immediately brought the team back to a level of success in Irish football history that was comparable only to Rockne and Leahy. These three coaches have an 80% or greater winning percentage while at Notre Dame – Rockne at .881, Leahy at .864, and Parseghian at .836. Parseghian's teams never won fewer than seven nor lost more than three games during the ten-game regular seasons of the era.[138] In his first year, the Irish improved their record to 9–1 behind Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback John Huarte, but they lost any hope for a national championship in the last game of the season at USC when Craig Fertig connected with a touchdown pass to Rod Sherman.[139] Parseghian earned coach of the year honors from the American Football Coaches Association, the Football Writers Association, and The Sporting News, as well as several others, and a cover story in Time magazine.[140][141] The 1966 team did finish unbeaten, finishing #1 in the AP Poll and winning the national championship in the process. The Irish had six shutout wins, each by 30 or more points. This includes a season-ending 51-0 win at #10 USC, the largest margin of victory by either side in the rivalry's history. This season is most remembered for a 10–10 tie at #2 Michigan State in the \"Game of the Century\" in which the injury-plagued Irish played for a tie rather than risking a loss.[142] It was under Parseghian as well that Notre Dame lifted its 40-plus year-old \"no bowl games\" policy,[143] beginning with the season of 1969, after which the Irish played the #1 Texas Longhorns in the Cotton Bowl Classic, losing in the final minutes in a closely contested game.[144] The following year, Parseghian's 9–1 squad[145] ended Texas' Southwest Conference record 30-game winning streak in the Cotton Bowl.[144] In 1971, Cliff Brown became the first African-American quarterback to start a game for the program.[146] The Irish returned to glory by winning Parseghian's second national championship in 1973, sweeping through their regular-season schedule 10–0 and defeating #1 Alabama 24-23 in the Sugar Bowl by taking advantage of a fourth-quarter missed extra point by the Crimson Tide. Due to health issues, Parseghian was forced to retire from coaching after another bowl win over Alabama to conclude the 1974 season.[147] During Parseghian's eleven-year career, the Irish amassed a record of 95–17–4 and captured two national championships. The Irish finished in the AP Top 10 nine times and never ranked lower than #14 at the end of a season. Parseghian was also named coach of the year by several selectors in his national championship years of 1966 and 1973 and was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1980.[148][149] Dan Devine was hired to take over as head coach upon Parseghian's retirement from Notre Dame in 1975.[150] Devine was already a highly successful coach and had led Arizona State, Missouri, and the NFL's Green Bay Packers.[150] Devine had been a leading candidate for the head coaching job at Notre Dame in 1964, when Ara Parseghian was hired.[151] When approached for the job following Parseghian's resignation, Devine accepted immediately, joking that it was probably the shortest job interview in history.[152] When he arrived at Notre Dame he already had a college coaching record of 120 wins, 40 losses, and eight ties and had led his teams to victory in four bowl games.[153] At Notre Dame he would lead the Irish to 53 wins, 16 losses, and a tie as well as three bowl victories.[153] His lasting achievement came midway through this run, when the 1977 Notre Dame team won the national championship, led by junior quarterback Joe Montana.[154] Before the game against USC, played at home on October 22, Devine changed the team's jerseys from navy blue & white to kelly green & gold, later known as the \"green jersey game\", resulting in a 49–19 victory over the Trojans.[155] The Irish continued to wear green for the rest of Devine's tenure at the school.[155] The championship season climaxed with a 38–10 win in the 1978 Cotton Bowl Classic over previously top-ranked Texas, led by Heisman Trophy winner Earl Campbell.[156] The win vaulted the Irish from fifth to first in the polls. The following season, the Irish lost their first two games including a shocking 3–0 loss to Missouri in South Bend, but would recover to finish the regular season 8–3 and earn a berth in the Cotton Bowl against Houston. The Irish used three Montana touchdowns (two passing, one rushing) to recover from a 22-point deficit in the fourth quarter and win 35–34, the largest fourth-quarter comeback in college football history at the time. The game became known as the \"Chicken Soup Game\" after Montana ate a bowl of chicken soup at halftime while battling the flu.[157] The 1979 and 1980 Irish did not live up to the standards set by earlier Devine teams, although the former season did see Vagas Ferguson set the single-season program rushing record (1,437 yards) that still stands today. Because he had the unenviable task of following a legend, Devine came under heavy scrutiny while at Notre Dame and it was felt that he was never fully embraced by the Notre Dame community, despite winning a national championship.[158] After a 5–2 start in his first season, rumors of incompetence were circulated and that Devine would be dismissed and replaced by Don Shula or even Ara Parseghian (who went so far as to say he would not return to Notre Dame under any circumstances).[159] Even on the day of the 1977 USC game, \"Dump Devine\" bumper stickers were being sold outside Notre Dame Stadium.[159] On August 15, 1980, Devine announced that he would be leaving Notre Dame at the end of season, saying he wanted to be able to spend more time with his wife.[158] Gerry Faust was a surprise choice when hired to replace Devine in 1981.[160] Prior to Notre Dame, Faust had been one of the more successful high school football coaches in the country. As coach of Moeller High School in Cincinnati he amassed a 174–17–2 record over 19 seasons.[161] Many of his players had gone on to play for Notre Dame; indeed, when he arrived in South Bend, he was reunited with nine of his former players from Moeller. Despite his success in the high school ranks, Faust's success at Notre Dame was mixed. In his first season, the Irish finished 5–6.[162] In Faust's second season, Notre Dame improved slightly to 6–4–1.[163] The most successful years under Faust were the 1983 and 1984 campaigns where the Irish finished 7–5 and made trips to the Liberty Bowl and Aloha Bowl respectively.[164][165] His final record at Notre Dame was 30–26–1.[166] To avoid being fired, Faust resigned at the end of the 1985 season.[167][168] He announced his resignation prior to the final game of the year, where Notre Dame suffered a humiliating 58–7 loss at Miami; Allen Pinkett scored the Irish TD. Faust proceeded to take over as head coach at Akron.[169] Lou Holtz had 17 years of head coaching experience by the time he was hired to lead the Irish.[170] He had previously been head coach of William & Mary, North Carolina State, the NFL's New York Jets, Arkansas, and Minnesota.[170] In contrast to Faust, Holtz was well known as a master motivator and a strict disciplinarian.[171][172] The tone was set with Holtz's first meeting with his team as Irish head coach in 1986, immediately demanding his players sit up straight in their chairs and look him in the eye as he spoke.[173] Holtz began in 1986 where his predecessor left off in 1985, finishing with an identical record of 5–6.[174] However, unlike the 1985 squad, which was generally outcoached and outplayed, Holtz's 1986 edition was competitive in nearly every game, losing five out of those six games by a combined total of 14 points. That would be his only losing season as he posted a record of 95–24–2 over the next ten seasons adding up to a 100–30–2 record overall.[175][176] In 1987, Holtz led the Irish to an 8–4 record.[177] Notre Dame's best player was star wide receiver Tim Brown, who would win the Heisman Trophy that season and is Notre Dame's seventh and most recent Heisman winner.[178][179] The 1988 campaign began with high hopes, as former Notre Dame coaches Rockne, Leahy, Parseghian, and Devine all won their first national championship in their third season with the program. The Irish defeated their first five opponents, ascending to the #4 ranking in the lead-up to a visit from the reigning national champion Miami Hurricanes. In a game which became known as Catholics vs. Convicts due to a popular T-shirt design on Notre Dame's campus, the Irish upset the Hurricanes 31–30 when Pat Terrell knocked down Steve Walsh's two-point conversion attempt with no time on the clock. When star players Ricky Watters and Tony Brooks showed up late for dinner right before the then top-ranked Irish played second-ranked USC in the final regular season game of 1988,[180] in a controversial move, Holtz took his 10–0 Irish squad to Los Angeles without them.[181] His move was vindicated when the Irish defeated USC anyway.[182] Holtz was named national coach of the year,[170] and a win over No. 3 West Virginia in the Fiesta Bowl captured the Irish's 11th-all time national championship.[183] 1988 remains Notre Dame's most recent undefeated season and national championship.[184][185] In 1989, Holtz led the Irish to a 12–1 record. The Irish began the season in the Kickoff Classic game in East Rutherford, New Jersey, against Virginia.[186] The Irish won by a score of 36–13 and ascended to the #1 spot in the AP Poll.[187] Next, top-ranked Notre Dame defeated #2 Michigan by a score of 24–19.[188] After nine more consecutive victories to begin the season 11–0, the Irish would lose to #7 Miami in the final week of the season, ending Notre Dame's 23-game winning streak.[189] Holtz would lead the Irish to a victory in the Orange Bowl over #1 Colorado to end the season, finishing #2 in the AP poll behind Miami.[190] After beginning the 1990 season with a #1 ranking and a victory over #4 Michigan by a score of 28–24 and two more wins for a 3–0 start, the Irish took their first loss of the season, losing to Stanford by a score of 36–31. The Irish would ascend back to #1 on the strength of a home win over #2 Miami, a game that saw the end of the series between the two until 2010.[191] However, late-season losses to Penn State and Colorado in the Orange Bowl would eliminate the Irish from national championship contention.[192] The 1991 Fighting Irish began the season 8-1, but lost back-to-back games for the first time since 1987 when they again lost to Penn State. The Irish would receive a berth in the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans, Louisiana, where they defeated Florida by a score of 39–28.[193][194] In 1992, Notre Dame finished 10–1–1. After defeating Northwestern to start the season,[195] the Fighting Irish tied #5 Michigan, their first tie of the Holtz era.[196] This season saw the Irish's largest win in history against Purdue, a 48–0 win at Notre Dame Stadium, and a 28–3 Cotton Bowl against previously unbeaten #4 Texas A&M.[197][198] The Irish enjoyed another successful season in 1993, finishing the season at 11–1. After scoring 27 points in wins over Northwestern and #2 Michigan to start the season, the Irish defeated their next six opponents to enter a matchup with undefeated #1 Florida State 8–0 and ranked just behind the Seminoles at #2. For the first time, ESPN's College GameDay decided to make a visit to campus to host the show live on Saturday morning.[199] In a classic, the Irish defeated the Seminoles 31–24, ascending to the #1 ranking a day later. However, a loss to #17 Boston College on a game-winning field goal as time expired by a score of 41–39 ended the Irish's national championship aspirations.[200] The Irish would face a rematch with #6 Texas A&M in the Cotton Bowl to finish the season, a game the Irish won by a score of 24–21.[201][202] Controversially, Notre Dame finished #2 in the AP poll behind a team in Florida State it had beaten. In 1994, Holtz led Notre Dame to a 6–5–1 record, the Irish's worst record since Holtz's first season in 1986.[203] The team lost three of four games midseason to drop out of the rankings for the first time since 1986. The Irish would improve to 9–3 in 1995, but lost to #8 Florida State in the Orange Bowl.[204][205] Lou Holtz's final season at Notre Dame in 1996 resulted in an 8–3 record. The season notably saw Notre Dame's first participation in the Emerald Isle Classic in Ireland, a 54–27 win over Navy, and an overtime loss to USC, snapping the Irish's 13-game non-losing streak against the Trojans.[206][207] Holtz's option offense, which helped catapult Notre Dame to many victories in the late 1980s and early 1990s, also helped rack up impressive recruiting classes. During the 1989 season, Holtz had the following future NFL players on offense: QB Rick Mirer, RB Ricky Watters, RB Anthony Johnson, RB Rodney Culver RB Dorsey Levens, and WR Raghib Ismail. In 1990, he added RB Jeff Burris (who would later move to safety), FB Jerome Bettis and TE Irv Smith. 1991 saw the additions of RB Reggie Brooks and FB Ray Zellars. 1992 saw the addition of WR Derrick Mayes. For 1993, he added FB Marc Edwards. In 1995, he added RB Autry Denson. From the 1987–1995 NFL Drafts, there were a total of 65 Notre Dame players selected.[208] Overall, Holtz took Notre Dame to one undefeated season, nine consecutive New Year's Day bowl games, and top 10 finishes in the AP poll in five seasons,[209] as well as overseeing the majority of the longest winning streak against USC in program history (11 games). Holtz retired from Notre Dame following the 1996 season,[210] but would unretire in 1999 to accept the head coaching position at South Carolina where he would serve until the completion of the 2004 season.[211][212] Bob Davie, who had been Holtz's defensive coordinator from 1994 to 1996, was promoted to head coach when Holtz retired.[213] Davie, who turned down a head coaching offer from Purdue to accept the Irish's head coaching position,[214] was a well-respected defensive mind who had also served as defensive coordinator at Tulane and Texas A&M.[215] Davie had also filled in as head coach for one game during the 1995 season when Lou Holtz was dealing with a health issue.[216] One of his first major decisions was to fire long-time offensive line coach Joe Moore, who then successfully sued the university for age discrimination.[217] On Davie's watch, the team suffered three bowl game losses (1997 Independence Bowl,[218] 1999 Gator Bowl,[219] and 2001 Fiesta Bowl),[220] and it failed to qualify for a bowl game in two others (1999 and 2001). The highlight of Davie's tenure was a 36–20 upset win in 1998 over #5 Michigan, the defending national champions.[221][222] On December 17, 1999, Notre Dame was placed on probation by the NCAA. The association's Committee on Infractions found two series of violations. The New York Times reported \"the main one involved the actions of a booster, Kimberly Dunbar, who lavished gifts on football players with money she later pleaded guilty to embezzling.\" In the second series of events, a football player was accused of trying to sell several complimentary game tickets and of using others as repayment of a loan. The player was also said \"to have been romantically involved with a woman (not Dunbar), a part-time tutor at the university, who wrote a term paper for another player for a small fee and provided players with meals, lodging and gifts.\"[223] The Dunbar violation began while Lou Holtz was head coach: \"According to the NCAA committee report, Dunbar, the woman at the center of the more serious violations, had become romantically involved with several Notre Dame football players from June 1995 to January 1998 and had a child with one, Jarvis Edison.\"[223] Notre Dame was placed on probation for two years and lost one of its 85 football scholarships each year in what the Times termed \"minor\" penalties.[223][224] Davie nearly defeated top-ranked Nebraska in 2000, with the Irish comeback bid falling short in overtime 27–24.[225] The aforementioned 2001 Fiesta Bowl was Notre Dame's first invitation to the Bowl Championship Series. The Irish lost by 32 points to Oregon State,[226] but would finish No. 15 in the AP Poll, Davie's highest ranking as head coach. Despite Davie's rocky tenure, new athletic director Kevin White gave the coach a contract extension following the 2000 season,[227] then saw the team start 0–3 in 2001 – the first such start in school history.[228] Disappointed by the on-field results, coupled with the Joe Moore and Kim Dunbar scandals, the administration decided to dismiss Davie after the 2001 season.[229] His final record at Notre Dame was 35–25.[230] On December 9, 2001, Notre Dame hired George O'Leary, the head coach at Georgia Tech, to replace Davie.[231] However, while researching a story on O'Leary, New Hampshire Union Leader reporter Jim Fennell uncovered misrepresentations in O'Leary's resume that had influenced the administration's decision to hire him.[232] The resulting media scandal embarrassed Notre Dame officials and tainted O'Leary; he resigned five days later, before coaching a single practice, recruiting a single player, or hiring a single assistant coach.[233] O'Leary's tenure is the shortest of any head coach in FBS history.[234] O'Leary would go on to become the head football coach at the University of Central Florida.[235] Once again in need of a new head coach, the school turned to Tyrone Willingham, the head coach at Stanford.[236] Willingham's hiring made him the first African American head coach in Notre Dame football history.[237] Bringing a feeling of change and excitement to campus, Willingham led the 2002 squad to a 10–2 regular season record, including an 8–0 start with wins over #7 Michigan and #11 Florida State, and a #4 ranking. This great early start, however, would be the lone highlight of Willingham's tenure, as Notre Dame finished the year with a loss to Boston College, then lopsided losses to USC and North Carolina State in the Gator Bowl.[238] The program faltered over the next two seasons under Willingham, compiling an 11–12 record.[239] During this time, Notre Dame lost a game by at least 30 points on five occasions. Furthermore, Willingham's 2004 recruiting class was judged by analysts to be the worst at Notre Dame in more than two decades.[240] Citing Notre Dame's third consecutive four-touchdown loss to arch-rival USC[241] compounded by another year of subpar recruiting efforts, the Willingham era ended on November 30, 2004 (after the conclusion of the 2004 season) when the university chose to terminate him and pay out the remainder of Willingham's six-year contract.[242] After Willingham's firing, Notre Dame initially pursued Utah head coach Urban Meyer, who had been an Irish assistant from 1996 to 2000 and had a clause in his Utah contract that stated he could take the Notre Dame head coaching job without paying a buyout.[243][244] After Meyer accepted the Florida head coaching position and turned down the Irish,[245] Charlie Weis left the NFL's New England Patriots, where he won three Super Bowls as offensive coordinator,[246] to become head football coach for the Irish beginning with the 2005 season.[247] A first-time head coach when he was hired by Notre Dame,[248] Weis was officially introduced on December 12, 2004.[249] Weis' hiring as the Irish's 30th head football coach made him the first Notre Dame graduate to hold the football head coaching position on a full-fledged basis since Joe Kuharich.[250] Weis signed a six-year contract worth about $2 million annually excluding incentives.[251][252][253] To kick off his inaugural season, Weis led the Irish to back-to-back road wins over ranked teams, the first time that had been done by a Notre Dame coach since Knute Rockne. On September 25, Weis and the Irish traveled to Seattle to face Washington and former head coach Tyrone Willingham, who was hired by the Huskies to be their head coach two weeks after getting fired at Notre Dame.[254] The Irish won by a score of 36–17.[255] Entering the rivalry game with USC, defending national champions and owners of a 27-game winning streak, the Irish had risen to #9 in the AP Poll. In one of the most famous games in the rivalry's history, USC defeated Notre Dame 34–31. The game is most remembered for Trojan running back and eventual Heisman winner Reggie Bush, who had already scored three touchdowns that day, illegally pushing quarterback Matt Leinart into the end zone on the final play of the game, in a play now known as the \"Bush Push\". The Irish won their remaining five games to earn an appearance in the Fiesta Bowl. There, they were defeated by the Ohio State Buckeyes 34–20[256] to finish the season 9–3 and #9 in the AP poll, their highest final ranking since 1993. Quarterback Brady Quinn broke numerous team passing records that season and became a top Heisman Trophy contender.[257] Wide receiver Jeff Samardzija was the team's leading receiver and also broke Notre Dame's single-season records for receiving yards and touchdowns.[258] During the 2005 season, Notre Dame signed Weis to a big raise and ten-year contract extension that was set to keep the coach in South Bend through the 2015 season.[259][260] Weis and the Irish went into the 2006 season with a No. 2 preseason ranking in the ESPN/Coaches Poll.[261] They finished the regular season with a 10–2 record, losing only to Michigan and USC. Notre Dame accepted a bid to the 2007 Sugar Bowl, losing to LSU 41–14. This marked their ninth consecutive postseason loss, the longest drought in NCAA history.[262] As a result, Notre Dame dropped to #17 in the final rankings.[263][264] In the wake of a graduating class that sent eleven players to the NFL,[265] the 2007 season included various negative milestones: the most losses in a single year (9);[266] two of the ten worst losses in program history (38–0 losses to both Michigan[267] and USC);[268] and the first 6-game losing streak for home games.[269] The Naval Academy recorded their first win over the Irish since 1963, breaking Notre Dame's NCAA-record 43-game win streak.[270] In 2008, the Irish started 4–1, but completed the regular season with a 6–6 record,[271] including a 24–23 home loss to Syracuse, the first time that Notre Dame had fallen to an eight-loss team.[272] Quarterback Jimmy Clausen was the team's star player, completing over 60% of his passes.[273][274] Despite speculation the university might fire Weis, it was announced he would remain head coach.[275] Weis's Notre Dame squad ended the season breaking the Irish's NCAA bowl losing streak by beating Hawaii, 49–21, in the Hawaii Bowl.[276] Weis entered the 2009 season with the expectation from the Notre Dame administration that his team would be in position to compete for a BCS Bowl berth.[277] Notre Dame started the first part of the season 4–2, with close losses to Michigan and USC. Sitting at 6–2, however, Notre Dame lost to Navy for the second time in three years,[278] which became the first loss in a four-game losing streak to finish the season. Quarterback Jimmy Clausen and wide receiver Golden Tate would forgo their senior seasons and enter the NFL Draft.[279] Weis was fired on November 30, 2009.[280] According to Weis' buyout, he was to be paid $6 million then $2.05 million annually until the contract ran out in December 2015 for a total of about $19 million.[281] During that time, Weis made more money annually not to coach the Irish than his successor, Brian Kelly, made to coach the team.[282] On December 10, 2009, Cincinnati head coach Brian Kelly became the 31st head coach of the Fighting Irish after leading the Bearcats to a 12–0 record and BCS bowl-game berth, but he left the team before the bowl game.[283][284] Kelly's hiring surprised very few as he was a northern Irish Catholic who was considered one of college football's rising stars.[285] In his first season, Kelly led the Fighting Irish to an 8–5 record.[286] Tragedy struck early in the season when Declan Sullivan, a junior working for the athletic department, died while filming a practice on a scissor lift in dangerously high winds.[287] Dayne Crist started the season at quarterback but was injured for a second consecutive year, this time in the Tulsa game, which the Irish lost.[288] Kelly turned to freshman quarterback Tommy Rees, who led the Irish to victories in the last three games against #15 Utah, Army in Yankee Stadium, and breaking an eight-year losing streak to USC in the LA Coliseum. Kelly guided the Irish to a 33–17 win over Miami (FL) in the 2010 Sun Bowl to finish 2010 with an 8–5 record.[289] With senior wideout Michael Floyd returning for his senior season and an outstanding recruiting class that included several highly touted defensive linemen,[290] Kelly and the Irish looked to improve on their 8–5 record from the prior year. However, an early season upset to a Skip Holtz-led South Florida team and a last-second loss to Michigan in Ann Arbor, games in which the Irish committed 10 total turnovers, left the Irish at 0–2 to start the season. The Irish bounced back to beat #15 Michigan State and had two 4-game winning streaks, with the only loss during that stretch coming at the hands of USC.[291] The Irish also broke Navy's 2-game winning streak over Notre Dame. Notre Dame lost 18–14 to Florida State in the 2011 Champs Sports Bowl, concluding the 2011 campaign with an 8–5 record overall, identical to the 2010 season.[292] In the team's losses, multiple turnovers from the quarterback position were often the culprit, and as a whole turnovers at critical times in the game often derailed potential Irish comebacks. On September 12, 2012, during the football program's 125th season, Notre Dame announced that it would leave the Big East Conference for the Atlantic Coast Conference, excluding the football and hockey programs.[293] This move became official on July 1, 2013. While the Fighting Irish football team remained an FBS independent, it agreed to play five games per season against ACC teams starting with the 2014 football season. In return, Notre Dame became eligible to participate in the ACC's sub-BCS level bowl arrangements.[294] The 2012 season was another entry in historic third seasons for Notre Dame head coaches. The Irish began the season 7–0, including wins over ranked rivals in Michigan State, Michigan, and Stanford. The game against the Cardinal required a goal-line stand against running back Stepfan Taylor in overtime to preserve the win for the Irish.[295] The season's signature win came at #8 Oklahoma with ESPN's College GameDay in town. On November 18, after a loss by #1 Oregon, Notre Dame became ranked #1 in the nation in both the AP and Coaches' polls after reaching 11–0 during the regular season for the first time since 1993, also ranking #1 in the BCS standings for the first time in the 14-year history of the selection system.[296] After defeating USC on November 24,[297] Notre Dame concluded its first 12–0 regular season, and the Irish were soon formally named to appear in the BCS National Championship Game for the first time. In that game, on January 7, 2013, the Irish lost to Alabama 42–14.[298] The strength of the 2012 Fighting Irish was its defense, captained by senior leader Manti Te'o, who broke the school record for interceptions by a linebacker with 7 and finished second to Johnny Manziel in Heisman Trophy voting. Coming off the previous year's national title game appearance, the Fighting Irish were dealt a blow when 2012 starting quarterback, Everett Golson, was suspended from the University due to an academic violation.[299] Senior Tommy Rees then took over. Notre Dame's 2013 season ended with a record of 9–4,[300] a victory over Rutgers in the Pinstripe Bowl, and a #20 AP poll ranking.[301][302] The 2014 season started off with 6 straight victories and a #5 national ranking heading into a showdown with #2 Florida State in Tallahassee, Florida. FSU won that game 31–27, on a controversial offensive pass interference call that brought back a last-second Notre Dame touchdown. The Fighting Irish bounced back with a win against Navy before dropping their final 4 games of the season. They did win the Music City Bowl by defeating the LSU Tigers and finished the season at an 8–5 record.[303] The 2015 Fighting Irish began its season with another new offensive coordinator, Mike Sanford Jr.[304] Led for most of the year by sophomore quarterback DeShone Kizer, the Irish had fourteen plays of over 50 yards during the season, which was a school record, including two touchdowns of over 90 yards (a 91-yard touchdown run by C. J. Prosise and a 98-yard touchdown run by Josh Adams). The Irish only had two in the previous 126 years of Notre Dame football. They finished the regular season averaging 34 points per game, including a 62-point effort against UMass, the most points in a game since 1996. The Irish began the season 10–1 and were in position for a College Football Playoff appearance, but lost a last-second game to Stanford to finish with a 10–2 record and a berth in the Fiesta Bowl.[305] Star linebacker Jaylon Smith was injured early in the game which became a loss to Ohio State.[306] The 2016 season ended with a 4–8 record, Brian Kelly's worst win–loss record at Notre Dame. The tone for the season was set early, with a heartbreaking double overtime loss to Texas in the season opener.[307] Just 4 games into the season, Brian Kelly fired defensive coordinator Brian VanGorder.[308] At the end of the season, starting quarterback DeShone Kizer declared for the NFL Draft[309] and backup quarterback Malik Zaire announced he would be transferring in the winter after graduation.[310][311] Amidst speculation that Kelly's job was in jeopardy and that Kelly was looking to leave Notre Dame, athletics director Jack Swarbrick announced that Kelly would return for the 2017 season.[312] The 2017 season was one of Kelly's strongest seasons at ND. An early one-point loss to #2 Georgia was the only blemish on an 8-1 start, keyed by a 49-14 blowout over rival USC. The tough running of running back Josh Adams behind an experienced and talented offensive line, which included future top-10 picks Quenton Nelson and Mike McGlinchey and won the Joe Moore Award as the best offensive line in that nation, allowed Notre Dame to string together 6 consecutive 20+ point victories. However, when #3 Notre Dame visited #7 Miami in South Florida on November 7, an embarrassing 41-8 loss effectively ended the Irish hopes of a playoff run. They ended the season with a win over LSU in the Music City Bowl.[313] The Irish opened the 2018 season at home against Michigan and won, 24–17.[314] After benching quarterback Brandon Wimbush in favor of Ian Book, the Irish then won the remainder of their regular season games, including victories over #7 Stanford, #24 Virginia Tech, #12 Syracuse, and Northwestern.[315] This led to Notre Dame's first undefeated regular season since 2012.[316] They were ranked #3 in the nation by the College Football Playoff committee and selected to play in the College Football Playoff semifinal at the Cotton Bowl against Clemson.[317] Notre Dame's undefeated streak came to an end after losing to the eventual national champions 30–3 to finish the season at 12–1.[318] Kelly was named AP Coach of the Year and Home Depot Coach of the Year for the 2018 season.[319][320] Kelly and the Fighting Irish started off the 2019 season with a #9 ranking in the AP Poll. Notre Dame won their first two games before dropping a 23–17 result to #3 Georgia. Notre Dame won their next three games before dropping a 45–14 game to #19 Michigan. Notre Dame closed out the regular season with victories in their last five games, followed by a win in the Camping World Bowl 33–9 over Iowa State.[321] In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the cancellation of regular season scheduled games, Notre Dame joined the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) in football for a single season in 2020 and played a full slate of conference matches.[322] The Irish won all ten of their games, including a mid-season contest against perennial conference power and top-ranked Clemson. The Fighting Irish defeated the Tigers 47–40 in double overtime. However, Clemson defeated the Irish in a rematch in the ACC Championship Game 34–10. Notre Dame qualified for the College Football Playoff as the #4 seed.[323] In the College Football Playoff Semifinals against Alabama at the Rose Bowl, Notre Dame lost 31–14 to finish with a 10–2 record.[324] In what would become Kelly's final season as head coach in 2021, the Fighting Irish were ranked #9 to begin the season, but struggled in their first two games, beating Florida State 41–38 and Toledo 32–29. Following a 24–13 loss to #7 Cincinnati, Kelly helped lead the Fighting Irish to a seven-game winning streak to finish the regular season 11–1 and earn a berth in the Fiesta Bowl.[325] On November 29, 2021, Kelly resigned as Notre Dame head coach to accept a ten-year, $95 million contract offer to become head coach at LSU.[326] In so doing, Kelly became the first Irish head coach since Thomas A. Barry in 1907 to leave Notre Dame for another coaching job.[327] Kelly left the Irish as the program's all-time winningest head coach.[328][329] On December 3, 2021, Notre Dame's defensive coordinator Marcus Freeman was promoted to the head coaching position to replace Brian Kelly, becoming the 32nd head coach in program history.[330][331] The second African American head coach in the history of the Irish football program, Freeman signed a five-year contract worth $4 million annually excluding incentives.[332][333][334] Freeman took control immediately, coaching the Irish in their Fiesta Bowl loss to Oklahoma State.[335][336] Freeman opened the 2022 season with losses to Ohio State (his alma mater) and Marshall, thus becoming first head coach in Notre Dame history to start his tenure with three losses.[337] He gained his first win the following week against the California.[338][339] Freeman's Irish would go on to finish the regular season ranked 19th with a record of 8-4, including an upset win over No. 5 Clemson.[340][341] They were awarded a berth in the Gator Bowl where they defeated South Carolina 45–38.[342][343] For the 2023 season, Freeman guided the Notre Dame program to a 10-win season. Safety Xavier Watts received the Bronko Nagurski Trophy for college football's best defensive player and the team earned victories over #17 Duke, #10 USC and #19 Oregon State in the Sun Bowl. Notre Dame finished the year ranked #14 in the final AP Top 25. Freeman and the Fighting Irish held their first home game of the 2024 season against the Northern Illinois Huskies as the #5 ranked team in the AP Top 25 and as a 28.5-point favorite to win. They fell to the Huskies 16-14, throwing two interceptions and giving up two blocked field goals. It was the second early-season home loss for the Irish against a heavy underdog in three years (following the 2022 loss to Marshall), was the first-ever win by a Mid-American Conference football program against a top 5 team, the first-ever Huskie win against a top 10 team, and one of the largest point-spread upsets in modern college football.[344] The Irish went on to complete the regular season 11-1 and will host a home game in the first year of the expanded college football playoffs. Notre Dame's 11 claimed national championships are: Following its appearance in the 1925 Rose Bowl, Notre Dame did not play in a post-season game for 44 consecutive years (1925–1968), including after many of the team's most successful seasons from the Rockne era in the 1920s and the Leahy era in the 1940s. The university's stated reasons for its self-imposed hiatus were that bowl games were \"glorified exhibitions\" that played no part in national championship selections and that they extended the season too far to the detriment of players' academic progress.[351] Notre Dame has made 874 appearances in the Associated Press poll over 71 seasons. Notre Dame has spent 591 weeks in the Top 10, 318 weeks in the Top 5, and 98 weeks at No. 1.[352] Notre Dame has finished the year ranked in the final Associated Press poll of the season 56 times: Notre Dame has participated in eleven \"No. 1 vs No. 2\" matchups since the AP poll began in 1936.[369] They have a record of 5–3–2 in such games, with a 4–1–1 record as the No. 1 team in such matchups. Here's a list of such games: Notre Dame has played in many regular season games that have been widely regarded by both the media[370] and sports historians[371] as historic or famous games. Notre Dame has played in many games labeled \"Game of the Century\" as well as several No. 1 vs No. 2 matchups.[372] Notre Dame has also played in several bowl games considered by many sportswriters to be among the best bowl games played:[384][385] Notre Dame's all-time record after the 2023 season stands at 948 wins, 338 losses, and 42 ties. † George O'Leary did not coach a single practice or game, resigning five days after being hired for misrepresenting his academic credentials.‡ Kent Baer served as interim head coach for one game at the 2004 Insight Bowl after Tyrone Willingham was fired. Notre Dame has made 41 bowl game appearances, winning 20 and losing 21, with one game vacated.[387] After an initial appearance in a postseason contest in the 1925 Rose Bowl, the Fighting Irish refused to participate in bowl games for more than four decades;[388] Sports Illustrated's Dan Jenkins speculated that Notre Dame might have gone to as many as twenty bowl games during the self-imposed forty-five-year hiatus.[388] From 1994 to the 2006 football seasons, Notre Dame lost 9 consecutive bowl games, tied with Northwestern for the most in NCAA history. That streak ended with a 49–21 win over Hawaii in the 2008 Hawaii Bowl. In the process, Notre Dame scored its highest point total in postseason play. The record of 9 consecutive bowl losses was later tied by Northwestern in 2011, then that streak was snapped a year later. Currently, the Fighting Irish are in a skid with winless 0-8 record in BCS/Playoff games and 0-10 in their last 10 major bowl games. Notre Dame's last major bowl win came against Texas A&M in the 1994 Cotton Bowl. Between 2009 and 2016, and resuming again in 2018, Notre Dame has hosted an annual off-site home football game known as the Shamrock Series. The series promotes Notre Dame's athletic and academic brand, and has brought the Fighting Irish to San Antonio, New York, Greater Washington, D.C., Chicago, Indianapolis, Boston and the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex. Notre Dame has yet to lose a game in the Shamrock Series with a record of 11-0 (including the later-vacated win over Arizona State in the 2013 season). Prior to the 2012 season, Notre Dame Athletic Director Jack Swarbrick announced at a news conference of plans to continue the series through 2016. He confirmed after his news conference that New York is expected to fall in that rotation and then continue to be the one consistently repeating venue for Shamrock Series games. The Shamrock Series was not held in 2017, but resumed in 2018. One of the unique aspects of the Shamrock Series is its inclusion of academic and other non-football activities in the area of that year's host city the days and hours leading up to the game, which include pep rallies, drummers' circles, and academic lectures.[389][390][391] The Shamrock Series held in Las Vegas was the largest crowd for a college athletic event in Nevada history.[392] Seven Notre Dame football players have won the Heisman Trophy, which ties them with the University of Oklahoma for the second most by any university. (Ohio State also has seven trophies that were won by only six players, while USC has the most winners with eight). Heisman voting:[394] 50 former Notre Dame players and 6 coaches have been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame, located in Atlanta, Georgia.[364] Notre Dame leads all universities in players inducted. Notre Dame's home jersey is navy blue with white numerals, gold outlining, and a small interlocking \"ND\" logo on each sleeve. The away jersey is white with navy numerals, gold outlining, and the interlocking \"ND\" on the sleeves. These uniforms were introduced by Lou Holtz in 1986 and retained during the tenures of Bob Davie (1997-2001) and Tyrone Willingham (2002–04). In 2005, Charlie Weis removed the interlocking \"ND\" from the sleeves, replacing it with the player's number, the first time the Irish had worn \"TV numbers\" since 1986, when they were located on the shoulders. These jerseys remained throughout Weis' tenure. When Brian Kelly succeeded Weis in 2010, the interlocking \"ND\" returned to the sleeves, and it has remained since. The Irish traditionally have not worn player names on their jerseys during regular season games, but they were included during the coaching tenures of Dan Devine (1975–80) and Gerry Faust (1981-85). When Notre Dame appeared in the 1970 Cotton Bowl Classic, its first bowl game in 45 years, Ara Parseghian had player names placed on the backs of the jerseys, a tradition which was retained for four other bowl appearances under Parseghian. Holtz, Davie, Willingham and Weis (in the 2006 Fiesta Bowl and 2007 Sugar Bowl) did not adhere to this tradition for bowl games they coached, but it returned under Weis for the 2008 Hawaii Bowl and has been continued by Kelly and Marcus Freeman. Notre Dame's helmets are solid gold with gray facemasks, the gold being emblematic of the University's famed \"Golden Dome\". Notre Dame's tradition for the team's student managers to spray-paint the team's helmets prior to each game ended in 2011 when the football equipment staff, along with Notre Dame Athletics Director Jack Swarbrick and head coach Brian Kelly outsourced the painting process to Hydro Graphics Inc. During Gerry Faust's tenure (1981–85), Notre Dame's blue jerseys switched from the traditional navy (although Notre Dame wore green jerseys full-time between the 1977 game vs. USC and the end of the 1980 season) to royal blue with gold and white stripes on the sleeves (they also wore a green jersey with sleeve stripes for the 1983 game vs. USC). The navy blue jerseys returned for the 1984 season (the Irish wore a redesigned white jersey during the 1983 Liberty Bowl without sleeve stripes and navy blue names and numbers which was carried over to 1984). No uniform numbers have been retired by Notre Dame. Upon being issued a number, each player is given a card that lists some of the more famous players who have worn that particular number. Number 3 is perhaps the most famous number in Irish football history, having been worn by Ralph Guglielmi, George Izo, Daryle Lamonica, Coley O'Brien, Joe Montana, Michael Floyd, Rick Mirer and Ron Powlus, among others.[425] Number 5 is also notable, as it is the only number to be worn by one of the Four Horsemen (Elmer Layden) a Heisman Trophy Winner (Paul Hornung) and a National Title winning Quarterback (Terry Hanratty).[425] Number 7 has been worn by such Irish greats as 1964 Heisman Trophy winner John Huarte, 1970 Heisman runner-up Joe Theismann, Steve Beuerlein, Jimmy Clausen and Jarious Jackson.[425] In 2011, both Michigan and Notre Dame wore throwback uniforms in their game against each other. For each Shamrock Series game, Notre Dame wears specially-designed helmets, jerseys, and pants. Champion supplied football jerseys for Notre Dame for over 50 years until the Irish switched to Adidas in 2001. On July 1, 2014, the Notre Dame athletic department began wearing uniforms and footwear supplied by Under Armour. Over the years, Notre Dame has occasionally worn green instead of blue as its home jersey, sometimes adopting the jersey for an entire season – or more – at a time. Notre Dame is confirmed to have worn green as far back as 1926 against Penn State, and in 1942 they officially became an alternate color for the team.[426] Currently, Notre Dame reserves its green jerseys for special occasions. Sometimes on such occasions, the Irish will take the field for warmups dressed in blue, only to switch to green when they go back to the locker room before kickoff. This tradition was started by Dan Devine in 1977 before the USC game. Notre Dame has also been known to switch jerseys at halftime, as during the 1985 USC game and in the loss to Nile Kinnick-led Iowa in 1939, although this was to help avoid confusion between their navy uniforms and Iowa's black ones. The current design of the jersey is kelly green with gold numbers and white outlining. For the 2006 Army game, Coach Charlie Weis broke out the green jerseys as a reward to his senior players and in an attempt to end the string of losses by the Irish when wearing green. Notre Dame wore throwback green jerseys in 2007 against USC in honor of the 30th anniversary of the 1977 National Championship team but lost the game 38-0.[427] As of 2023, Notre Dame's record in green is 42-15-1, going back to 1975.[426] On at least one occasion (1992 Sugar Bowl) Notre Dame has worn an away variant of the jersey, a white jersey with green numbers. Notre Dame Stadium is the home football stadium for the University of Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team. Located on the southeast part of the university's campus in Notre Dame, Indiana and with a seating capacity of 77,622, Notre Dame Stadium is one of the most renowned venues in college football.[428] The Sporting News ranks Notre Dame Stadium as #2 on its list of \"College Football Cathedrals\".[429] and the stadium experience evokes a more traditional feel. Notre Dame Stadium is used for football-related activities and for Commencement (since 2010). Notre Dame Stadium had no permanent lighting until the expansion project in 1997. NBC paid for the lighting as they have televised all Notre Dame home football games since 1991. On April 12, 2014, it was announced during the annual Blue-Gold Spring Game that a FieldTurf synthetic surface would replace the grass field after the 2014 Commencement Weekend. In November 2014 the University of Notre Dame embarked on a $400 million stadium expansion called the Crossroads Campus Project, which was completed in time for the 2017 season. Cartier Field was the original playing field of the Fighting Irish. In 1930, it was replaced by Notre Dame Stadium, due to the growing popularity of ND football. Known by fans as \"The Gug\" (pronounced \"goog\"), The Guglielmino Athletics Complex is Notre Dame's football headquarters. The Gug houses the offices for all team staff members, an auditorium, a weight room, a training room, the equipment room, the practice locker room, a brand new napping room, and various other spaces for the football team to utilize. The complex was underwritten by Don F. Guglielmino and his family. The indoor practice facility has a synthetic turf field and a video board at midfield for replay and graphics. On the second level of the facility, there is a 1,600-square-foot recruiting lounge. In all, the facility totals 111,400 square feet, and the ceiling is 95 feet at its peak. Notre Dame has rivalries with several universities. Although the Fighting Irish competes as an Independent, they play a national schedule that includes annual or otherwise regularly scheduled rivalry games. Army, Boston College, Michigan, Michigan State, Navy, Northwestern, Pittsburgh, Purdue, Stanford, and USC are among Notre Dame's rivals. Notre Dame and the Miami Hurricanes first met during the 1955 college football season.[430] They met three times during the 1960s (1960, 1965, and 1967) and proceeded to play each other annually from 1971 to 1990 (except in 1986). Notre Dame consistently dominated the series in the 1970s, but in the 1980s, Miami began to dominate as the once docile rivalry intensified significantly. Both teams were national contenders in the later part of the decade, and both teams cost each other at least one national championship. Hostilities were fueled when the Hurricanes routed the Fighting Irish in the 1985 season finale 58–7, with Miami widely accused of running up the score in the second half. The rivalry gained national attention and both teams played their most famous games from 1988 to 1990. The game known as Catholics vs. Convicts in South Bend was won by the Fighting Irish 31–30. The following year, Miami ended Notre Dame's 23-game winning streak with a 27–10 victory. The rivalry ended after the Fighting Irish dashed #2 Miami's hopes for a repeat national championship with a 29–20 victory in South Bend. Notre Dame dropped Miami from its schedule due to the intensified rivalry. The two teams are next scheduled to meet during a yet to specified date during the 2025 season. They also will play each other in yet to be scheduled dates in the 2031, 2032, 2034, and 2037 seasons.[431] The first meeting between Notre Dame and Michigan was in 1887, the first official football game in Notre Dame's history.[432] The two schools have met 44 times in total, the latest matchup in 2019. Through the 2021 season, the two schools are both in the top five in all-time Division I winning percentage, with Notre Dame fourth and Michigan third Meeting for the first time in 1897, Notre Dame and Michigan State play for the Megaphone Trophy. The two schools played in 64 out of 70 seasons from 1948 to 2017, but have not met since. Their next scheduled game is in 2026.[433] Notable games in the series include the 1966 \"Game of the Century\". Through the 2023 season, Notre Dame leads the all-time series 48–28–1 and the trophy series 33–27–1.[434] Navy and Notre Dame played 93 games without interruption from 1927 to 2019. Notre Dame had a 43-game win streak during this time frame, the longest streak by one team over another in Division I-A football, which ended in 2007.[435] While the 2020 contest was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the series resumed in 2021. Through the 2024 season, Notre Dame leads the series 83–13–1.[436] USC is Notre Dame's primary rival, and the schools compete annually for the Jeweled Shillelagh. The rivalry has produced 39 national championships,[437]: 113–118 15 Heisman Trophy winners,[438] and 184 Consensus All-Americans through the 2021 season.[439] It is considered one of the most prominent rivalries in college football,[440][441][442][443] and has been called the greatest rivalry not dictated by conference affiliation or geography.[444] The teams have played each other annually since 1926, except from 1943 to 1945 and 2020. Notable games in the series include the 1977 \"Green Jersey\" game and the 2005 \"Bush Push\" game. Through the 2024 season, Notre Dame leads the all-time series 50–37–5 and the trophy series 35–30–3.[445] Due to its long and storied history, Notre Dame football boasts many traditions unique to Notre Dame. Some of these are: Since the NFL began drafting players in 1936, 495 Notre Dame football players have been selected by NFL teams. Additionally, Notre Dame has had 65 players selected in the first round of the NFL draft, including five overall number one picks. Of the 46 Super Bowls competed, as of 2012, only 14 teams have won the event without an Irish player on the roster.[457] Looking at both participating team rosters, there have only been five Super Bowls that did not feature at least one former Notre Dame player on either team's roster – Denver vs. Atlanta, 1999; Dallas vs. Buffalo, 1994; Washington vs. Denver, 1988; Dallas vs. Denver, 1978; and Baltimore vs. Dallas, 1971.[457] Eleven former players have won multiple Super Bowls: Mark Bavaro, Rocky Bleier, Nick Buoniconti, Eric Dorsey, Dave Duerson, David Givens, Terry Hanratty, Bob Kuechenberg, Joe Montana, Steve Sylvester and Justin Tuck.[457] 13 former Notre Dame players, plus 1 non-player alumnus, have been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, tying it for first with USC among all college football programs.[458][459] *McNally graduated from St. John's (MN), but started his career at Notre Dame and is listed as a hall of famer under both schools in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.[460] The Fighting Irish are the only team, professional or collegiate, to have all their games broadcast nationally on the radio and their home games on television.[462] Notre Dame famously left the College Football Association, a consortium that administered television broadcast rights on behalf of over 64 schools, in 1990, in order to establish its own broadcasting deal with NBC. From 1968 to 2007, Westwood One served as the official radio partner for the Irish, broadcasting their games for 40 consecutive years.[463] Until the 2006 Air Force game, Notre Dame had a record 169 consecutive games broadcast nationally on either NBC, ABC, ESPN, or CBS.[464] The 2006 ND vs. Air Force game was broadcast on CSTV, a college sports channel owned by CBS who had an exclusive contract with the Mountain West Conference, of which Air Force is a member. Radio rights to the Fighting Irish are held by Skyview Networks, who began distributing the broadcasts as part of a multi-sport arrangement in 2020.[465] NBC has been televising Notre Dame Home football games since the 1991 season.[9] In addition to TV broadcasts, NBC also maintains several dedicated websites to ND football and Notre Dame Central,[466] which provides complete coverage, full game replays and commentary of the Notre Dame team. NBC's television contract with Notre Dame was renewed in April 2013 and was set to continue through the 2025 football season,[467] before another contract renewal was made in 2023. NBC is now set to be the home of Notre Dame football through the 2029 season. It also aired football games on NBC's streaming service Peacock started in the 2021 season, with the home opener on September 11, 2021, against Toledo aired exclusively on the streaming service.[468][469] Internationally Sky Sports has been covering Notre Dame Football home games in the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, Italy and Germany since 2018 as a result of Comcast's takeover of Sky Although the Notre Dame football program is not a full member of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), it has an agreement to play an average of five ACC schools per season. In return Notre Dame has access to the non-College Football Playoff ACC bowl line-up.[470][471] Notre Dame utilizes a format of six home games in South Bend, five away games, and one major metropolitan area neutral site \"Shamrock Series\" home game for scheduling.[389] This includes preserving traditional yearly rivalries with USC, Stanford, and Navy,[472] five rotating ACC opponents (two away ACC games will coincide in even years with away games at Navy and three away ACC games will coincide in odd years with home games against Navy),[473] two home and home series (one home game and one away game), one one-time opponent home game, and the traveling \"Shamrock Series\" home game.[474][475] TBA: 1 additional ACC away game will be scheduled. TBA: 1 additional ACC home game and 1 additional non-ACC home game will be scheduled. TBA: 1 additional ACC game and 3 additional non-ACC games will be scheduled. TBA: 1 additional ACC game and 2 additional non-ACC games will be scheduled. TBA: 1 additional ACC game and 2 additional non-ACC games will be scheduled. TBA: 1 additional ACC game and 3 additional non-ACC games will be scheduled. TBA: 2 additional non-ACC games will be scheduled.

                "title": "Notre Dame finally clears a hurdle, but the one that will change its narrative of big-game shortcomings awaits - CBSSports.com",
                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. There was a hurdle to clear Friday in South Bend. On this stage, for too long, Notre Dame had been exposed. The hurdle was figurative, but there was definitely a bar to get over in the minds of the Fighting Irish. If it didn't, something was wrong. The spectacle was nice for the first ever College Football Playoff game on campus. The weather was football-perfect with snow earlier in the day. But the story was in waking the championship echoes that had been asleep for too long. The big-game failures have piled up for a while. The last time the Irish won a major bowl -- Notre Dame 24, Texas A&M 21 in the 1994 Cotton Bowl -- the BCS didn't even exist yet. It's a streak of 10 straight losses, eight of which have come in the BCS/CFP era, dating back more than 30 years to when Lou Holtz was the coach. The Irish did a fine job of getting a participation trophy during that stretch. It was on the losing end of one of the least competitive national titles in the 16-year history of the BCS (42-14 to Alabama in 2013). In two recent CFP games against Alabama and Clemson (2018 and 2021, respectively), the Irish were outscored by a combined 44 points. And while Friday's historic 27-17 win over Indiana wasn't a bowl and the result was expected, all of it was definitely needed for the Notre Dame psyche. While major bowls mean something totally different these days in the CFP, that's the point. Notre Dame showed well in the opening of this new era of expanded win-or-go-home games. The season continues in the Sugar Bowl quarterfinal 12 days from now against No. 2 seed Georgia. That's another, bigger hurdle. But first things first. Remember when the season was over after that Week 2 loss to Northern Illinois? Not as much as you used to. Since then, the Irish are on a roll that demands our attention. They've won 11 in a row, tying Boise State for the second-longest winning streak in the country. Friday marked the continuation of an Irish rebound that has lasted three months. Quarterback Riley Leonard told The Players' Tribune this week his depression after the NIU loss was such that he asked a cop for a ride home from Notre Dame Stadium that day. \"I didn't want to show my face outside the building,\" he said. \"My phone,\" he told reporters this week, \"is still shut off.\" That's sad, but the subsequent play has reflected mass concentration. Notre Dame has a complete team now for reasons that extended beyond its raucous home Friday night. The Irish aren't as flashy as Oregon. They might not have the talent level of Ohio State. But with clear minds and full hearts following Friday's win, they can have a meaningful look at this thing. Michigan won a national championship last season flipping the modern championship script. It played defense and ran the ball. The Wolverines were downright boring at times with their physicality. Notre Dame has that same look. Too soon? Probably. Indiana's magic this season will definitely be questioned. But that's less of a story than what lies ahead for the Irish. Georgia suddenly looks gettable with quarterback Carson Beck likely to miss the Sugar Bowl with arm surgery. And Notre Dame suddenly looks like the squad that can bow up and knock off the Dawgs. There are other reasons to make that case on Friday. Indiana came into the game with the nation's best run defense (70.8 yards per game). Notre Dame tailback Jeremiyah Love ran 98 yards for a touchdown on the Irish's third snap. That tied a school record and set the tone. Notre Dame rushed for 193 yards overall. With 39 minutes left in the game, Notre Dame took over on its own 20. It was already up 14-0 and it felt like Indiana would never see the ball again. Leonard stayed in the rhythm he perfected at Duke and refined at Notre Dame. The short passing game was numbingly effective as Notre Dame piled up 20 first downs and held the ball for more than 35 minutes. Leonard didn't have to run that much with Love and two other tailbacks averaging more than seven yards per carry. He later broke a Notre Dame record for quarterbacks with his 15th rushing touchdown on the season The first breakout star of the expanded playoff might be sophomore receiver Jordan Faison. He had caught only 16 passes all season. Against Indiana, Faison caught seven passes for 89 yards, five of them for first downs. The last catch for 44 yards to the Indiana 1-yard line set up Notre Dame's final touchdown. Marcus Freeman also coached like a budding star, looking completely comfortable. Those whispers of job security in September evolved into a contract extension this week. Freeman turned his top-10 defense loose in the best possible sense. A first-quarter interception tied James Madison for the national lead in turnovers forced (29). Say what you want about Notre Dame's schedule since NIU, but it did beat four ranked teams (Louisville, Navy, Army and now Indiana) by a combined 89 points. That's a picture of a winning streak. That's definitely concentration after a crippling loss. We can talk about what Indiana was or wasn't all offseason. Notre Dame deserves to be here now. \"It's crazy to think that this same team lost that game early in the year,\" Leonard said on the field on a night after those echoes woke up just a little bit. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive.

                "content": "Get Your Copy! Order Your Almanac Today! When is the first day of winter? In 2024, the winter solstice date is Saturday, December 21. So, what is the winter solstice, and why does it happen? Learn all about the shortest day of the year—and tell us what winter means to you! The first day of winter in the Northern Hemisphere is marked by the winter solstice, which occurs on Saturday, December 21, 2024, at 4:21 A.M. (EST). For the Northern Hemisphere, the winter solstice occurs every year on December 21 or 22. (The Southern Hemisphere’s winter solstice occurs in June.) The winter solstice is the day with the fewest hours of sunlight throughout the year, making it the “shortest day” of the year. Thankfully, after we reach the winter solstice, the days begin to grow longer and longer again until we reach the summer solstice—the first day of summer and the longest day of the year. Think of it this way: Although the winter solstice means the start of winter, it also means the return of more sunlight. It only gets brighter from here! Due to time zone differences, the solstice may technically occur +/- one day in some regions. The winter solstice marks the official beginning of astronomical winter (as opposed to meteorological winter, which starts about 3 weeks before the solstice). It occurs once a year in each hemisphere: once in the Northern Hemisphere (in December) and once in the Southern Hemisphere (in June). It marks the start of each hemisphere’s winter season. When one hemisphere is experiencing its winter solstice, the other is simultaneously experiencing its summer solstice! This is all thanks to Earth’s tilted axis, which means that at the solstice, half of Earth is pointed away from the Sun, and the other half is pointed towards it. We often think of the winter solstice as an event that spans an entire calendar day, but the solstice actually lasts only a moment. Specifically, it’s the exact moment when a hemisphere is tilted as far away from the Sun as possible. This is shown in the diagram below. The winter solstice is significant across various cultures, signaling the changing of the seasons. Some ancient peoples even marked the solstice using huge stone structures, like Newgrange in Ireland. In some cultures, the solstice traditionally marked the midway point of the season rather than the start of it, which explains why holidays such as Midsummer Day are celebrated around the first day of summer. On the day of the winter solstice, we are tilted as far away from the Sun as possible, which means that the Sun’s path across the sky is as low in the sky as it can be. Think about the daily path of the Sun: It rises in the east and sets in the west, arcing across the sky overhead. During the summer, the Sun arcs high in the sky, but during the winter, it arcs lower, closer to the horizon. How can we observe the effects of solstice ourselves? On the solstice day, stand outside at noon and look at your shadow. It’s the longest shadow that you’ll cast all year! Do this again on the day of the summer solstice, and you’ll see almost no shadow. Another way to think of this is that on the day of the solstice, the Sun’s path reaches its most southerly point in the sky. For those of us in the Northern Hemisphere, this means that the Sun’s path is as low in the sky as it can get—even at “high noon.” In the Southern Hemisphere, it’s the opposite: The Sun’s path will be high in the sky on the winter solstice—directly overhead at noon at the latitude called the Tropic of Capricorn, which is an imaginary line that circles the Earth, running through parts of South America, southern Africa, and Australia. The word solstice comes from the Latin sol (“sun”) and sistere (“to stand still). So, loosely translated, it means “sun stands still.” Why? The Sun’s path across the sky appears to freeze for a few days before and after the solstice. The change in its noontime elevation is so slight that the Sun’s path seems to stay the same or stand still. The day after the winter solstice, the Sun’s path begins to advance northward again, eventually reaching its most northerly point on the day of the summer solstice. Then, as summer advances toward winter, the points on the horizon where the Sun rises and sets advance southward each day; the high point in the Sun’s daily path across the sky, which occurs at local noon, also moves southward each day. It’s a never-ending cycle! → Observe the changing day length in your area with our Sunrise and Sunset Times Calculator. When we reach the summer solstice on June 20, 21, or 22, the Sun will reach its most northerly spot, directly overhead at the Tropic of Cancer (which runs through Mexico, northern Africa, and southern Asia). The summer solstice is the longest day of the year (the day with the most daylight hours) and marks the beginning of summer. Learn more about the summer solstice! You may also be familiar with the term “equinox.” In the spring (March) and the fall (September), the Sun’s path brings it directly above Earth’s equator. Equinox means “equal,” as day and night on the equinoxes are of roughly equal length. See our SEASONS page for a diagram and the dates for all seasons. The day of the winter solstice is the shortest day of the year, which means that it’s the day in which we experience the least amount of daylight. Logically, it would make sense to assume that this is also the coldest day of the year since we are exposed to less warmth-giving sunlight on this day than at any other time. But this is not true. Many factors affect a location’s temperature on any given day, including altitude, snow cover, and large-scale weather patterns. Snow cover, for example, partially blocks solar radiation from being absorbed by the Earth, resulting in less heat being released and an overall drop in temperature. Because of these factors, it’s impossible to point to the same date year after year and call it the coldest day. In the United States, the coldest days of the year tend to occur between mid-December and late January, so while it’s certainly possible that the coldest day of the year could also be the day of the winter solstice, that’s not usually the case! There is not a black-and-white answer to this question—it depends on which definition of “winter” you follow: Because an almanac is traditionally defined as a “calendar of the heavens,” we at The Old Farmer’s Almanac follow the astronomical definition of the seasons, which states that each of the four seasons starts on a solstice or equinox. Learn more about the Reasons for the Seasons. However, that doesn’t mean that the meteorological definition is incorrect. It is important for meteorologists to be able to compare climatological statistics for a particular season from 1 year to the next—for agriculture, commerce, and a variety of other purposes. Thus, meteorologists break the seasons down into groupings of three months. Meteorological winter starts on December 1 and includes December, January, and February. Did you know? For the ancient Celts, the calendar was based around the solstices and equinoxes, marking the Quarter Days, with the mid-points called Cross-Quarter Days. Learn more about the Celtic calendar. One famous ancient marker is Stonehenge in England. Due to the alignment of the stones, experts acknowledge that the design appears to correspond with the solstices. One theory is that the area was used as a temple to worship the Sun and/or as a type of astronomical observatory. Read more about Ancient Sites Aligned with the Solstice and Equinox. Here at the Almanac, we love our weather folklore. Here are just a few (of the many) proverbs that we have collected in our archives: Read more winter weather folklore. Cultures around the world have celebrated the solstice since ancient times. From the Roman feast of Saturnalia to the pre-Christian festival of Norse jól or Juul observed in Scandinavia, our ancestors honored the first day of winter in many ways. Learn more about “Winter Solstice: Our Ancestors’ Customs and Traditions.” Winter inspires both joy and woe. Some people can’t wait for the cooler weather, snow, skiing, and ice skating, curling up by a fire, and the holiday spirit. You’ll notice a peaceful silence when you walk through the woods—a muffled quiet. Other people dislike the frigid temperatures, blizzards, and wild weather (for good reason). In colder regions, winter often means shoveling, snow blowing, dealing with bad roads, and sometimes unbearable temperatures. In warmer regions, the winter temperatures become very mild or cool, and places such as Florida fill up with people escaping the harshness of a northern winter. What does winter mean to you? Let us know in the comments! Brrrr! What about that winter weather? Colder temperatures will arrive soon (if they’re not here already).

They made it difficult to get through. Thanks. Kirsten Hughson (not verified) 4 weeks ago Last night, the first snow of the season fell! There’s probably seven or eight inches of snow outside right now. I just put the birdfeeders out and the deer are walking around the yard looking for things to eat. The woods outside my window are the most gorgeous they ever are. I love this season! Winter is coming (I know, Ned) and I couldn’t be happier!

                "content": "The science and astronomy behind the shortest day of the year The winter solstice is the day of the year with the fewest hours of daylight. In the northern hemisphere this date falls in December every year. In 2024 the winter solstice will occur on Saturday 21 December. Learn more about the astronomy behind the solstice with Royal Observatory Greenwich. Sign up to our space newsletter for monthly astronomy guides, special events and exclusive news from Royal Observatory Greenwich. The apparent position of the Sun in the sky changes throughout the year. During the summer months it rises higher in the sky and is above the horizon for longer. In the winter the Sun's position is lower and its time in the sky is shorter. This variation happens because the Earth orbits at an angle: it is tilted 23.4 degrees on its axis. During summer in the northern hemisphere the North Pole is tilted towards the Sun, and therefore this part of the Earth receives more direct sunlight and longer daylight hours. During winter in the northern hemisphere the North Pole is tilted away from the Sun, resulting in fewer daylight hours. This animation shows how the tilt of the Earth's axis influences the seasons. For more great astronomy explainers and resources, check out the Royal Observatory's schools pages. The winter solstice occurs at the point when this tilt away is at its maximum and the Sun is lowest in the sky. This is what gives us the shortest day and the longest night of the year. If you're in the southern hemisphere the opposite is true: in December the South Pole is tilted towards the Sun, making it summertime 'Down Under'. This image, a composite of dozens of photographs taken by Astronomy Photographer of the Year 2021 entrant György Soponyai, shows the changing arcs of the Sun throughout the year. The smallest arc at the bottom marks the winter solstice, and the largest one at the top the summer solstice. The band in the middle is the 'equinox', with roughly equal hours of day and night. The actual moment of the solstice in 2024 will occur at 9.21am GMT in the UK, but most people concentrate on the whole solstice day, which has been recognised by holidays and festivals in many cultures around the world. The shortest day lasts 7 hours 49 minutes and 42 seconds in London. This means that the length of the day during the winter solstice is 8 hours, 49 minutes shorter than the summer solstice. After the shortest day, the days start getting longer and the nights shorter. At the spring and autumnal equinoxes the day and night hours are around the same length, each lasting around 12 hours. The number of daylight hours peaks at summer solstice. The world 'solstice' comes from the Latin 'solstitium', meaning 'Sun stands still' – because the apparent movement of the Sun's path north or south stops before changing direction. It depends. If you're talking about 'astronomical winter' then yes, the solstice is the first day of winter. However, if you're referring to 'meteorological winter' then the first day of winter is 1 December. This is because meteorologists (scientists who study weather and climate patterns) split the year evenly, with three months for each of the four seasons. Whichever definition you use, it might not 'feel' like winter straight away. The coldest temperatures during the day are generally felt some time after the shortest day has passed. Winter solstice is an important time for cultures across the globe. Under the old Julian Calendar, the winter solstice occurred on 25 December. With the introduction of the Gregorian calendar the solstice slipped to the 21st, but the Christian celebration of Jesus’s birth continued to be held on 25 December. Here are some of the festivals celebrated internationally, past and present: The pre-Christian festival, the Feast of Juul, was observed in Scandinavia at the time of the December solstice. Fires would be lit to symbolise the heat and light of the returning Sun and a Yule log was gathered and burnt in the hearth as a tribute to the Norse god Thor. Present-day Christmas customs and traditions such as the Yule log, Yule boar, Yule singing, and others stem from pagan Juul. Today the event is celebrated in some forms of Modern Paganism. In Ancient Rome, the festival of Saturnalia began on 17 December and lasted for seven days. As the name suggests, the festival was celebrated in honour of Saturn, the father of the gods – the same deity after which the sixth planet in our solar system is named. People would make sacrifices at the Temple of Saturn before banqueting and giving gifts. The usual law and order would be suspended, schools and businesses would close, and quarrels would be forgotten. In China and East Asia, the Dongzhi Festival is one of the most important times of the year. It celebrates the return of longer daylight hours and ultimately an increase of positive energy. The festival’s origins can be traced back to the yin and yang philosophy of balance and harmony. During this time for getting together, families in southern China often make and eat tangyuan: balls of glutinous rice, occasionally brightly coloured, cooked in a sweet or savoury broth. Shab-e Yalda ‘Yalda night’ or Shab-e Chelleh ‘night of forty’ is an Iranian festival celebrated on the ‘longest and darkest night of the year’. Friends and family get together to eat, drink and read poetry until the early hours. Pomegranates and watermelons are particularly significant. Today, people from the UK and beyond visit the ancient site of Stonehenge to celebrate the winter and summer solstices. One reason why this is a popular site to visit is that it's possible to glimpse the Sun’s rays through the stones, which are positioned to align with the path of the Sun. Most people arrive late on the night of the solstice to catch the sunrise.",

                "content": "– in Europe (light green & dark grey)– in the European Union (light green) Germany,[e] officially the Federal Republic of Germany,[f] is a country in Central Europe. It lies between the Baltic and North Sea to the north and the Alps to the south. Its sixteen constituent states have a total population of over 82 million in an area of 357,596 km2 (138,069 sq mi), making it the most populous member state of the European Union. It borders Denmark to the north, Poland and the Czech Republic to the east, Austria and Switzerland to the south, and France, Luxembourg, Belgium, and the Netherlands to the west. The nation's capital and most populous city is Berlin and its main financial centre is Frankfurt; the largest urban area is the Ruhr. Settlement in the territory of modern Germany began in the Lower Paleolithic, with various tribes inhabiting it from the Neolithic onward, chiefly the Celts. Various Germanic tribes have inhabited the northern parts of modern Germany since classical antiquity. A region named Germania was documented before AD 100. In 962, the Kingdom of Germany formed the bulk of the Holy Roman Empire. During the 16th century, northern German regions became the centre of the Protestant Reformation. Following the Napoleonic Wars and the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, the German Confederation was formed in 1815. Formal unification of Germany into the modern nation-state commenced on 18 August 1866 with the North German Confederation Treaty establishing the Prussia-led North German Confederation, which became the German Empire in 1871. After World War I and the German Revolution of 1918–1919, the Empire was replaced by the Weimar Republic. The Nazi rise to power in 1933 led to the establishment of a totalitarian dictatorship, World War II, and the Holocaust. In 1949, after the war and a period of Allied occupation, Germany was organized into two separate polities with limited sovereignty: the Federal Republic of Germany, or West Germany, and the German Democratic Republic, or East Germany. Berlin continued its de jure Four Power status. The Federal Republic of Germany was a founding member of the European Economic Community and the European Union, while the German Democratic Republic was a communist Eastern Bloc state and member of the Warsaw Pact. After the fall of the communist led-government in East Germany, German reunification saw the former East German states join the Federal Republic of Germany on 3 October 1990. Germany has been described as a great power with a strong economy; it has the largest economy in Europe by nominal GDP. As a global power in industrial, scientific and technological sectors, it is both the world's third-largest exporter and importer. As a developed country, it offers social security, a universal health care system, and tuition-free university education. Germany is a member of the United Nations, Council of Europe, NATO and OECD, and a founding member of the European Union, G7 and G20. It has the third-highest number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites, 54, of which 51 are cultural. The English word Germany derives from the Latin Germania, which came into use after Julius Caesar adopted it for the peoples east of the Rhine.[12] The German term Deutschland, originally diutisciu land ('the German lands'), is derived from deutsch (cf. Dutch), descended from Old High German diutisc 'of the people' (from diot or diota 'people'), originally used to distinguish the language of the common people from Latin and its Romance descendants. This in turn descends from Proto-Germanic *þiudiskaz 'of the people' (see also the Latinised form Theodiscus), derived from *þeudō, descended from Proto-Indo-European *tewtéh₂- 'people', from which the word Teutons also originates.[13] Pre-human ancestors, the Danuvius guggenmosi, who were present in Germany over 11 million years ago, are theorized to be among the earliest ones to walk on two legs.[14] Ancient humans were present in Germany at least 600,000 years ago.[15] The first non-modern human fossil (the Neanderthal) was discovered in the Neander Valley.[16] Similarly dated evidence of modern humans has been found in the Swabian Jura, including 42,000-year-old flutes which are the oldest musical instruments ever found,[17] the 40,000-year-old Lion Man,[18] and the 41,000-year-old Venus of Hohle Fels.[19][20] The Nebra sky disk, created during the European Bronze Age, has been attributed to a German site.[21] The Germanic peoples are thought to have emerged from the Jastorf culture during the Nordic Bronze Age or early Iron Age.[22][23] From southern Scandinavia and northern Germany, they expanded south, east, and west, coming into contact with the Celtic, Iranian, Baltic, and Slavic tribes.[24][25] Southern Germany was inhabited by Celtic-speaking peoples, who belonged to the wider La Tène culture. They were later assimilated by the Germanic conquerors.[26] Under Augustus, the Roman Empire began to invade lands inhabited by the Germanic tribes, creating a short-lived Roman province of Germania between the Rhine and Elbe rivers. In 9 AD, three Roman legions were defeated by Arminius in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest.[27] The outcome of this battle dissuaded the Romans from their ambition of conquering Germania and is thus considered one of the most important events in European history.[28] By 100 AD, when Tacitus wrote Germania, Germanic tribes had settled along the Rhine and the Danube (the Limes Germanicus), occupying most of modern Germany. However, Baden-Württemberg, southern Bavaria, southern Hesse and the western Rhineland had been incorporated into Roman provinces.[29][30][31] Around 260, Germanic peoples broke into Roman-controlled lands.[32] After the invasion of the Huns in 375, and with the decline of Rome from 395, Germanic tribes moved farther southwest: the Franks established the Frankish Kingdom and pushed east to subjugate Saxony and Bavaria. Areas of what is today eastern Germany were inhabited by Western Slavic tribes.[29] Charlemagne founded the Carolingian Empire in 800; it was divided in 843.[33] The eastern successor kingdom of East Francia stretched from the Rhine in the west to the Elbe river in the east and from the North Sea to the Alps.[33] Subsequently, the Holy Roman Empire emerged from it. The Ottonian rulers (919–1024) consolidated several major duchies.[34] In 996, Gregory V became the first German Pope, appointed by his cousin Otto III, whom he shortly after crowned Holy Roman Emperor. The Holy Roman Empire absorbed northern Italy and Burgundy under the Salian emperors (1024–1125), although the emperors lost power through the Investiture controversy.[35] Under the Hohenstaufen emperors (1138–1254), German princes encouraged German settlement to the south and east (Ostsiedlung).[36] Members of the Hanseatic League, mostly north German towns, prospered in the expansion of trade.[37] The population declined starting with the Great Famine in 1315, followed by the Black Death of 1348–1350.[38] The Golden Bull issued in 1356 provided the constitutional structure of the Empire and codified the election of the emperor by seven prince-electors.[39] Johannes Gutenberg introduced moveable-type printing to Europe, laying the basis for the democratization of knowledge.[40] In 1517, Martin Luther incited the Protestant Reformation and his translation of the Bible began the standardization of the language; the 1555 Peace of Augsburg tolerated the \"Evangelical\" faith (Lutheranism), but also decreed that the faith of the prince was to be the faith of his subjects (cuius regio, eius religio).[41] From the Cologne War through the Thirty Years' Wars (1618–1648), religious conflict devastated German lands and significantly reduced the population.[42][43] The Peace of Westphalia ended religious warfare among the Imperial Estates.[42] The legal system initiated by a series of Imperial Reforms (approximately 1495–1555) provided for considerable local autonomy and a stronger Imperial Diet.[44] The House of Habsburg held the imperial crown from 1438 until the death of Charles VI in 1740. Following the War of the Austrian Succession and the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, Charles VI's daughter Maria Theresa ruled as empress consort when her husband, Francis I, became emperor.[45][46] From 1740, dualism between the Austrian Habsburg monarchy and the Kingdom of Prussia dominated German history. In 1772, 1793, and 1795, Prussia and Austria, along with the Russian Empire, agreed to the Partitions of Poland.[47][48] During the period of the French Revolutionary Wars, the Napoleonic era and the subsequent final meeting of the Imperial Diet, most of the Free Imperial Cities were annexed by dynastic territories; the ecclesiastical territories were secularised and annexed. In 1806 the Imperium was dissolved; France, Russia, Prussia, and the Habsburgs (Austria) competed for hegemony in the German states during the Napoleonic Wars.[49] Following the fall of Napoleon, the Congress of Vienna founded the German Confederation, a loose league of 39 sovereign states. The appointment of the emperor of Austria as the permanent president reflected the Congress's rejection of Prussia's rising influence. Disagreement within restoration politics partly led to the rise of liberal movements, followed by new measures of repression by Austrian statesman Klemens von Metternich.[50][51] The Zollverein, a tariff union, furthered economic unity.[52] In light of revolutionary movements in Europe, intellectuals and commoners started the revolutions of 1848 in the German states, raising the German question. King Frederick William IV of Prussia was offered the title of emperor, but with a loss of power; he rejected the crown and the proposed constitution, a temporary setback for the movement.[53] King William I appointed Otto von Bismarck as the Minister President of Prussia in 1862. Bismarck successfully concluded the war with Denmark in 1864; the subsequent decisive Prussian victory in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 enabled him to create the North German Confederation which excluded Austria. After the defeat of France in the Franco-Prussian War, the German princes proclaimed the founding of the German Empire in 1871. Prussia was the dominant constituent state of the new empire; the King of Prussia ruled as its Kaiser, and Berlin became its capital.[54][55] In the Gründerzeit period following the unification of Germany, Bismarck's foreign policy as chancellor of Germany secured Germany's position as a great nation by forging alliances and avoiding war.[55] However, under Wilhelm II, Germany took an imperialistic course, leading to friction with neighbouring countries.[56] A dual alliance was created with the multinational realm of Austria-Hungary; the Triple Alliance of 1882 included Italy. Britain, France and Russia also concluded alliances to protect against Habsburg interference with Russian interests in the Balkans or German interference against France.[57] At the Berlin Conference in 1884, Germany claimed several colonies including German East Africa, German South West Africa, Togoland, and Kamerun.[58] Later, Germany further expanded its colonial empire to include holdings in the Pacific and China.[59] The colonial government in South West Africa (present-day Namibia), from 1904 to 1907, carried out the annihilation of the local Herero and Namaqua peoples as punishment for an uprising;[60][61] this was the 20th century's first genocide.[61] The assassination of Austria's crown prince on 28 June 1914 provided the pretext for Austria-Hungary to attack Serbia and trigger World War I. After four years of warfare, in which approximately two million German soldiers were killed,[62] a general armistice ended the fighting. In the German Revolution (November 1918), Wilhelm II and the ruling princes abdicated their positions, and Germany was declared a federal republic. Germany's new leadership signed the Treaty of Versailles in 1919, accepting defeat by the Allies. Germans perceived the treaty as humiliating, which was seen by historians as influential in the rise of Adolf Hitler.[63] Germany lost around 13% of its European territory and ceded all of its colonial possessions in Africa and the Pacific.[64] On 11 August 1919, President Friedrich Ebert signed the democratic Weimar Constitution.[65] Communists briefly seized power in Bavaria and a few larger cities, while conservative elements failed to overthrow the central government in the 1920 Kapp Putsch. The occupation of the Ruhr by Belgian and French troops and a period of hyperinflation followed. A plan to restructure Germany's war reparations and the creation of a new currency in 1924 helped stabilise the government and ushered in the Golden Twenties, an era of artistic innovation and liberal cultural life.[66][67][68] The worldwide Great Depression hit Germany in 1929, and by 1932 the unemployment rate had risen to 24%.[69] The Nazi Party led by Adolf Hitler became the largest party in the Reichstag after the election of July 1932, and President Hindenburg appointed Hitler chancellor on 30 January 1933.[70] After the Reichstag fire, a decree abrogated basic civil rights, and the first Nazi concentration camp opened.[71][72] On 23 March 1933, the Enabling Act gave Hitler unrestricted legislative power, overriding the constitution,[73] and marked the beginning of Nazi Germany. His government established a centralised totalitarian state, withdrew from the League of Nations, and dramatically increased the country's rearmament.[74] A government-sponsored programme for economic renewal focused on public works, the most famous of which was the Autobahn.[75] In 1935, the regime withdrew from the Treaty of Versailles and introduced the Nuremberg Laws which targeted Jews and other minorities.[76] Germany also reacquired control of the Saarland in 1935,[77] remilitarised the Rhineland in 1936, annexed Austria in 1938, annexed the Sudetenland in 1938 with the Munich Agreement, and in violation of the agreement occupied Czechoslovakia in March 1939.[78] Kristallnacht (Night of Broken Glass) saw the burning of synagogues, the destruction of Jewish businesses, and mass arrests of Jewish people.[79] In August 1939, Hitler's government negotiated the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact that divided Eastern Europe into German and Soviet spheres of influence.[80] On 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland, beginning World War II in Europe;[81] Britain and France declared war on Germany on 3 September.[82] In the spring of 1940, Germany conquered Denmark and Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and France, forcing the French government to sign an armistice. The British repelled German air attacks in the Battle of Britain in the same year. In 1941, German troops invaded Yugoslavia, Greece and the Soviet Union. By 1942, Germany and its allies controlled most of continental Europe and North Africa, but following the Soviet victory at the Battle of Stalingrad, the Allied reconquest of North Africa and invasion of Italy in 1943, German forces suffered repeated military defeats. In 1944, the Soviets pushed into Eastern Europe; the Western allies landed in France and entered Germany despite a final German counteroffensive. Following Hitler's suicide during the Battle of Berlin, Germany signed the surrender document on 8 May 1945, ending World War II in Europe[81][83] and Nazi Germany. Following the end of the war, surviving Nazi officials were tried for war crimes at the Nuremberg trials.[84][85] In what later became known as the Holocaust, the German government persecuted minorities, including interning them in concentration and death camps across Europe. The regime systematically murdered 6 million Jews, at least 130,000 Romani, 275,000 disabled, thousands of Jehovah's Witnesses, thousands of homosexuals, and hundreds of thousands of political and religious opponents.[86] Nazi policies in German-occupied countries resulted in the deaths of an estimated 2.7 million Poles,[87] 1.3 million Ukrainians, 1 million Belarusians and 3.5 million Soviet prisoners of war.[88][84] German military casualties have been estimated at 5.3 million,[89] and around 900,000 German civilians died.[90] Around 12 million ethnic Germans were expelled from across Eastern Europe, and Germany lost roughly one-quarter of its pre-war territory.[91] After Nazi Germany surrendered, the Allies de jure abolished the German state and partitioned Berlin and Germany's remaining territory into four occupation zones. The western sectors, controlled by France, the United Kingdom, and the United States, were merged on 23 May 1949 to form the Federal Republic of Germany (German: Bundesrepublik Deutschland); on 7 October 1949, the Soviet Zone became the German Democratic Republic (GDR) (German: Deutsche Demokratische Republik; DDR). They were informally known as West Germany and East Germany.[92] East Germany selected East Berlin as its capital, while West Germany chose Bonn as a provisional capital, to emphasise its stance that the two-state solution was temporary.[93] West Germany was established as a federal parliamentary republic with a \"social market economy\". Starting in 1948 West Germany became a major recipient of reconstruction aid under the American Marshall Plan.[94] Konrad Adenauer was elected the first federal chancellor of Germany in 1949. The country enjoyed prolonged economic growth (Wirtschaftswunder) beginning in the early 1950s.[95] West Germany joined NATO in 1955 and was a founding member of the European Economic Community.[96] On 1 January 1957, the Saarland joined West Germany.[97] East Germany was an Eastern Bloc state under political and military control by the Soviet Union via occupation forces and the Warsaw Pact. Although East Germany claimed to be a democracy, political power was exercised solely by leading members (Politbüro) of the communist-controlled Socialist Unity Party of Germany, supported by the Stasi, an immense secret service.[98] While East German propaganda was based on the benefits of the GDR's social programmes and the alleged threat of a West German invasion, many of its citizens looked to the West for freedom and prosperity.[99] The Berlin Wall, built in 1961, prevented East German citizens from escaping to West Germany, becoming a symbol of the Cold War.[100] Tensions between East and West Germany were reduced in the late 1960s by Chancellor Willy Brandt's Ostpolitik.[101] In 1989, Hungary decided to dismantle the Iron Curtain and open its border with Austria, causing the emigration of thousands of East Germans to West Germany via Hungary and Austria. This had devastating effects on the GDR, where regular mass demonstrations received increasing support. In an effort to help retain East Germany as a state, the East German authorities eased border restrictions, but this actually led to an acceleration of the Wende reform process culminating in the Two Plus Four Treaty under which Germany regained full sovereignty. This permitted German reunification on 3 October 1990, with the accession of the five re-established states of the former GDR.[102] The fall of the Wall in 1989 became a symbol of the Fall of Communism, the dissolution of the Soviet Union, German reunification and Die Wende (\"the turning point\").[103] United Germany was considered the enlarged continuation of West Germany so it retained its memberships in international organisations.[104] Based on the Berlin/Bonn Act (1994), Berlin again became the capital of Germany, while Bonn obtained the unique status of a Bundesstadt (federal city) retaining some federal ministries.[105] The relocation of the government was completed in 1999, and modernisation of the East German economy was scheduled to last until 2019.[106][107] Since reunification, Germany has taken a more active role in the European Union, signing the Maastricht Treaty in 1992 and the Lisbon Treaty in 2007,[108] and co-founding the eurozone.[109] Germany sent a peacekeeping force to secure stability in the Balkans and sent German troops to Afghanistan as part of a NATO effort to provide security in that country after the ousting of the Taliban.[110][111] In the 2005 elections, Angela Merkel became the first female chancellor. In 2009, the German government approved a €50 billion stimulus plan.[112] Among the major German political projects of the early 21st century are the advancement of European integration, the energy transition (Energiewende) for a sustainable energy supply, the debt brake for balanced budgets, measures to increase the fertility rate (pronatalism), and high-tech strategies for the transition of the German economy, summarised as Industry 4.0.[113] During the 2015 European migrant crisis, the country took in over a million refugees and migrants.[114] Germany is the seventh-largest country in Europe.[4] It borders Denmark to the north, Poland and Czechia to the east, Austria and Switzerland to the south, and France, Luxembourg, Belgium, and the Netherlands to the west. Germany is also bordered by the North Sea and, at the north-northeast, by the Baltic Sea. German territory covers 357,596 km2 (138,069 sq mi).[6] Elevation ranges from the mountains of the Alps (highest point: the Zugspitze at 2,963 metres or 9,721 feet) in the south to the shores of the North Sea (Nordsee) in the northwest and the Baltic Sea (Ostsee) in the northeast. The forested uplands of central Germany and the lowlands of northern Germany (lowest point: in the municipality Neuendorf-Sachsenbande, Wilstermarsch at 3.54 metres or 11.6 feet below sea level[115]) are traversed by such major rivers as the Rhine, Danube and Elbe. Significant natural resources include iron ore, coal, potash, timber, lignite, uranium, copper, natural gas, salt, and nickel.[4] Most of Germany has a temperate climate, ranging from oceanic in the north and west to continental in the east and southeast. Winters range from the cold in the Southern Alps to cool and are generally overcast with limited precipitation, while summers can vary from hot and dry to cool and rainy. The northern regions have prevailing westerly winds that bring in moist air from the North Sea, moderating the temperature and increasing precipitation. Conversely, the southeast regions have more extreme temperatures.[116] From February 2019 – 2020, average monthly temperatures in Germany ranged from a low of 3.3 °C (37.9 °F) in January 2020 to a high of 19.8 °C (67.6 °F) in June 2019.[117] Average monthly precipitation ranged from 30 litres per square metre in February and April 2019 to 125 litres per square metre in February 2020.[118] Average monthly hours of sunshine ranged from 45 in November 2019 to 300 in June 2019.[119] The territory of Germany can be divided into five terrestrial ecoregions: Atlantic mixed forests, Baltic mixed forests, Central European mixed forests, Western European broadleaf forests, and Alps conifer and mixed forests.[120] As of 2016[update], 51% of Germany's land area is devoted to agriculture, while 30% is forested and 14% is covered by settlements or infrastructure.[121] Plants and animals include those generally common to Central Europe. According to the National Forest Inventory, beeches, oaks, and other deciduous trees constitute just over 40% of the forests; roughly 60% are conifers, particularly spruce and pine.[122] There are many species of ferns, flowers, fungi, and mosses. Wild animals include roe deer, wild boar, mouflon (a subspecies of wild sheep), fox, badger, hare, and small numbers of the Eurasian beaver.[123] The blue cornflower was once a German national symbol.[124] The 16 national parks in Germany include the Jasmund National Park, the Vorpommern Lagoon Area National Park, the Müritz National Park, the Wadden Sea National Parks, the Harz National Park, the Hainich National Park, the Black Forest National Park, the Saxon Switzerland National Park, the Bavarian Forest National Park and the Berchtesgaden National Park.[125] In addition, there are 17 Biosphere Reserves,[126] and 105 nature parks.[127] More than 400 zoos and animal parks operate in Germany.[128] The Berlin Zoo, which opened in 1844, is the oldest in Germany, and claims the most comprehensive collection of species in the world.[129] Germany is a federal, parliamentary, representative democratic republic. Federal legislative power is vested in the parliament consisting of the Bundestag (Federal Diet) and Bundesrat (Federal Council), which together form the legislative body. The Bundestag is elected through direct elections using the mixed-member proportional representation system. The members of the Bundesrat represent and are appointed by the governments of the sixteen federated states.[4] The German political system operates under a framework laid out in the 1949 constitution known as the Grundgesetz (Basic Law). Amendments generally require a two-thirds majority of both the Bundestag and the Bundesrat; the fundamental principles of the constitution, as expressed in the articles guaranteeing human dignity, the separation of powers, the federal structure, and the rule of law, are valid in perpetuity.[130] The president, currently Frank-Walter Steinmeier, is the head of state and invested primarily with representative responsibilities and powers. He is elected by the Bundesversammlung (federal convention), an institution consisting of the members of the Bundestag and an equal number of state delegates.[4] The second-highest official in the German order of precedence is the Bundestagspräsident (President of the Bundestag), who is elected by the Bundestag and responsible for overseeing the daily sessions of the body.[131] The third-highest official and the head of government is the chancellor, who is appointed by the Bundespräsident after being elected by the party or coalition with the most seats in the Bundestag.[4] The chancellor, currently Olaf Scholz, is the head of government and exercises executive power through his Cabinet.[4] Since 1949, the party system has been dominated by the Christian Democratic Union and the Social Democratic Party of Germany. So far every chancellor has been a member of one of these parties. However, the smaller liberal Free Democratic Party and the Alliance 90/The Greens have also been junior partners in coalition governments. Since 2007, the democratic socialist party The Left has been a staple in the German Bundestag, though they have never been part of the federal government. In the 2017 German federal election, the right-wing populist Alternative for Germany gained enough votes to attain representation in the parliament for the first time.[132][133] Germany is a federation and comprises sixteen constituent states which are collectively referred to as Länder.[134] Each state (Land) has its own constitution,[135] and is largely autonomous in regard to its internal organisation.[134] As of 2017[update], Germany is divided into 401 districts (Kreise) at a municipal level; these consist of 294 rural districts and 107 urban districts.[136] Germany has a civil law system based on Roman law with some references to Germanic law.[140] The Bundesverfassungsgericht (Federal Constitutional Court) is the German Supreme Court responsible for constitutional matters, with power of judicial review.[141] Germany's specialized supreme court system includes the inquisitorial Federal Court of Justice for civil and criminal cases, along with the Federal Labour Court, Federal Social Court, Federal Fiscal Court, and Federal Administrative Court for other matters.[142] Criminal and private laws are codified on the national level in the Strafgesetzbuch and the Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch respectively. The German penal system seeks the rehabilitation of the criminal and the protection of the public.[143] With the exceptions of petty crimes, tried by a single professional judge, and of serious political crimes, all charges are adjudicated by mixed tribunals where lay judges (Schöffen) and professional judges preside together.[144][145] As of 2016, Germany's murder rate stood at a low of 1.18 murders per 100,000.[146] In 2018, the overall crime rate fell to its lowest since 1992.[147] Same-sex marriage has been legal in Germany since 2017, and LGBT rights are generally protected in the nation.[148] Germany has a network of 227 diplomatic missions abroad[149] and maintains relations with more than 190 countries.[150] Germany is a member of NATO, the OECD, the G7, the G20, the World Bank and the IMF. It has played an influential role in the European Union since its inception and has maintained a strong alliance with France and all neighbouring countries since 1990. Germany promotes the creation of a more unified European political, economic and security apparatus.[151][152][153] The governments of Germany and the United States are close political allies.[154] Cultural ties and economic interests have crafted a bond between the two countries resulting in Atlanticism. [155] After 1990, Germany and Russia worked together to establish a \"strategic partnership\" in which energy development became one of the most important factors. As a result of the cooperation, Germany imported most of its natural gas and crude oil from Russia.[156][157] Germany's development policy functions as a distinct sector within its foreign policy framework. It is formulated by the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development and carried out by the implementing organisations. The German government sees development policy as a joint responsibility of the international community.[158] It was the world's second-biggest aid donor in 2019 after the United States.[159] Germany's military, the Bundeswehr (Federal Defence), is organised into the Heer (Army and special forces KSK), Marine (Navy), Luftwaffe (Air Force) and Cyber- und Informationsraum (Cyber and Information Domain Service) branches.[160] In absolute terms, German military spending in 2023 was the seventh-highest in the world.[161] In response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced that German military expenditure would be increased past the NATO target of 2%, along with a one-time 2022 infusion of 100 billion euros, representing almost double the 53 billion euro military budget for 2021.[162][163] In 2023, military spending according to NATO criteria amounted to $73.1 billion, or 1.64% of the country's GDP, well below the NATO target of 2%. In 2024, Germany reported $97.7 billion to NATO, exceeding the NATO target of 2% at 2.12% of GDP.[164] As of May 2024[update], the Bundeswehr has a strength of 180,215 active soldiers and 80,761 civilians.[165] Reservists are available to the armed forces and participate in defence exercises and deployments abroad.[166] Until 2011, military service was compulsory for men at age 18, but this has been officially suspended and replaced with a voluntary service.[167][168] Since 2001 women may serve in all functions of service without restriction.[169] According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, Germany was the fifth-largest exporter of major arms in the world from 2019 to 2023.[170] In peacetime, the Bundeswehr is commanded by the Minister of Defence. In state of defence, the Chancellor would become commander-in-chief of the Bundeswehr.[171] The role of the Bundeswehr is described in the Constitution of Germany as defensive only. But after a ruling of the Federal Constitutional Court in 1994, the term \"defence\" has been defined not only to include protection of the borders of Germany, but also crisis reaction and conflict prevention, or more broadly as guarding the security of Germany anywhere in the world. As of 2017,[update] the German military has about 3,600 troops stationed in foreign countries as part of international peacekeeping forces, including about 1,200 supporting operations against Daesh, 980 in the NATO-led Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan, and 800 in Kosovo.[172][173] Germany has a social market economy with a highly skilled labour force, a low level of corruption,[175] and a high level of innovation.[176] It is the world's third-largest exporter and third-largest importer,[4] and has the largest economy in Europe by nominal GDP, which is also the world's third-largest economy by nominal GDP[177] and sixth-largest by PPP-adjusted GDP.[178] Its GDP per capita measured in purchasing power standards amounts to 121% of the EU27 average.[179] The country's service sector contributes approximately 69% of the total GDP, industry 31%—with Germany having the largest manufacturing sector in Europe—and agriculture 1% as of 2017[update].[4] The unemployment rate published by Eurostat amounts to 3.2% as of January 2020[update], which is the fourth-lowest in the EU.[180] Germany is part of the European single market which represents more than 450 million consumers.[181] In 2017, the country accounted for 28% of the eurozone economy according to the International Monetary Fund.[182] Germany introduced the common European currency, the euro, in 2002.[183] Its monetary policy is set by the European Central Bank, which is headquartered in Frankfurt.[184][174] The automotive industry in Germany is regarded as one of the most competitive and innovative in the world,[185] and is the sixth-largest by production as of 2021. Germany is home to Volkswagen Group, the world's second-largest automotive manufacturer by vehicle production.[186] The top ten exports of Germany are vehicles, machinery, chemical goods, electronic products, electrical equipments, pharmaceuticals, transport equipments, basic metals, food products, and rubber and plastics.[188] Of the world's 500 largest stock-market-listed companies measured by revenue in 2023, the Fortune Global 500, 32 are headquartered in Germany.[189] 30 major Germany-based companies are included in the DAX, the German stock market index which is operated by Frankfurt Stock Exchange.[190] Well-known international brands include Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Volkswagen, Audi, Porsche, Opel, Siemens, Allianz, Adidas, Puma, Hugo Boss, SAP SE, Bosch and Deutsche Telekom.[191] Berlin is a hub for startup companies and has become the leading location for venture capital-funded firms in the European Union.[192] Germany is recognised for its large portion of specialised small and medium enterprises, known as the Mittelstand model.[193] These companies represent 48% of the global market leaders in their segments, labelled hidden champions.[194] Research and development efforts form an integral part of the German economy,[195] with the country ranking fourth in research and development expenditure since 2005.[196] In 2018, Germany ranked fourth globally in terms of number of science and engineering research papers published[197] and third in the quality-adjusted Nature Index in 2023.[198] Research institutions in Germany include the Max Planck Society, the Helmholtz Association, and the Fraunhofer Society and the Leibniz Association.[199] Germany is the largest contributor to the European Space Agency.[200] Germany was ranked 9th in the Global Innovation Index in 2024.[201] With its central position in Europe, Germany is a transport hub for the continent.[202] Its road network is among the densest in Europe.[203] The motorway (Autobahn) is widely known for having no general federally mandated speed limit for some classes of vehicles.[204] The Intercity Express or ICE train network serves major German cities as well as destinations in neighbouring countries with speeds up to 300 km/h (190 mph).[205] The largest German airports are Frankfurt Airport, Munich Airport and Berlin Brandenburg Airport.[206] The Port of Hamburg is the third-busiest port in Europe and one of the twenty largest container ports in the world.[207] In 2019[update], Germany was the world's seventh-largest consumer of energy.[208] All nuclear power plants were phased out in 2023.[209] Germany meets its power demands using 40% renewable sources, and has been called an \"early leader\" in solar and offshore wind.[210][211] The country is committed to the Paris Agreement and several other treaties promoting biodiversity, low emission standards, and water management.[212][213][214] Germany's household recycling rate is among the highest in the world—at around 65%.[215] The country's greenhouse gas emissions per capita were the ninth-highest in the EU in 2018[update], but these numbers have been trending downward.[216][217] The German energy transition (Energiewende) is the recognised move to a sustainable economy by means of energy efficiency and renewable energy, with the country being called \"the world's first major renewable energy economy\".[218][219][211] Germany has reduced its primary energy consumption by 11% between 1990 and 2015[220] and set itself goals of reducing it by 30% by 2030 and by 50% by 2050.[221] Domestic and international travel and tourism combined directly contribute over €105.3 billion to German GDP. Including indirect and induced impacts, the industry supports 4.2 million jobs.[222] As of 2022, Germany is the eighth-most-visited country.[223] Its most popular landmarks include Cologne Cathedral, the Brandenburg Gate, the Reichstag, the Dresden Frauenkirche, Neuschwanstein Castle, Heidelberg Castle, the Wartburg, and Sanssouci Palace.[224] The Europa-Park near Freiburg is Europe's second-most popular theme park resort.[225] With a population of 84.7 million according to the 2023 German census,[226] Germany is the most populous country in the European Union, the second-most populous country in Europe after Russia,[4][g] and the nineteenth-most populous country in the world. Its population density stands at 227 inhabitants per square kilometre (590 inhabitants/sq mi). The fertility rate of 1.57 children born per woman (2022 estimates) is below the replacement rate of 2.1 and is one of the lowest fertility rates in the world.[4] Since the 1970s, Germany's death rate has exceeded its birth rate. However, Germany is witnessing increased birth rates and migration rates since the beginning of the 2010s. Germany has the third oldest population in the world, with an average age of 47.4 years.[4] Four sizeable groups of people are referred to as national minorities because their ancestors have lived in their respective regions for centuries:[228] There is a Danish minority in the northernmost state of Schleswig-Holstein;[228] the Sorbs, a Slavic population, are in the Lusatia region of Saxony and Brandenburg; the Roma and Sinti live throughout the country; and the Frisians are concentrated in Schleswig-Holstein's western coast and in the north-western part of Lower Saxony.[228] After the United States, Germany is the second-most popular immigration destination in the world.[229] In 2015, following the 2015 refugee crisis, the Population Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs listed Germany as host to the second-highest number of international migrants worldwide, about 5% or 12 million of all 244 million migrants.[230] Refugee crises have resulted in substantial population increases;[231] for example, the major influx of Ukrainian immigrants following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, meaning over 1.06 million refugees from Ukraine were recorded in Germany as of April 2023.[232] As of 2019[update], Germany ranks seventh among EU countries in terms of the percentage of migrants in the country's population, at 13.1%.[233] In 2022, there were 23.8 million people, 28.7 percent of the total population, who had a migration background.[234] Germany has a number of large cities. There are 11 officially recognised metropolitan regions. The country's largest city is Berlin, while its largest urban area is the Ruhr.[235] According to the 2022 census, Christianity is the largest religion at 49.7% of the population; 23.1% identified as Protestant and 25.1% as Catholic.[237] Islam is the second-largest religion in the country.[238] In the 2011 census, 1.9% of respondents (1.52 million people) gave their religion as Islam, but this figure is deemed unreliable because a disproportionate number of adherents of this faith (and other religions, such as Judaism) are likely to have made use of their right not to answer the question.[239] In 2019, there were an estimated 5.3–5.6 million Muslims with a migrant background[h] (6.4–6.7% of the population), in addition to an unknown number of Muslims without a migrant background.[240] Most of the Muslims are Sunnis and Alevis from Turkey, but there are a small number of Shi'ites, Ahmadiyyas and other denominations. Other religions each comprise less than one percent of Germany's population.[238] In 2011, formal members of the Jewish community represented no more than 0.2% of the total German population, and 60% of them resided in Berlin.[241] An estimated 80 to 90 percent of these Jews in Germany are Russian-speaking immigrants from the former Soviet Union, who came to Germany from the 1980s onwards.[242][243] A study in 2023 estimated that 46.2% of the population are not members of any religious organization or denomination.[244] Irreligion in Germany is strongest in the former East Germany, which used to be predominantly Protestant before the enforcement of state atheism, and in major metropolitan areas.[245][246] German is the official and predominantly spoken language in Germany.[247] It is one of 24 official and working languages of the European Union, and one of the three procedural languages of the European Commission, alongside English and French.[248] German is the most widely spoken first language in the European Union, with around 100 million native speakers.[249] Recognised native minority languages in Germany are Danish, Low German, Low Rhenish, Sorbian, Romani, North Frisian and Saterland Frisian; they are officially protected by the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. The most used immigrant languages are Turkish, Arabic, Kurdish, Polish, Italian, Greek, Spanish, Serbo-Croatian, Bulgarian and other Balkan languages, as well as Russian. Germans are typically multilingual: 67% of German citizens claim to be able to communicate in at least one foreign language and 27% in at least two.[247] Responsibility for educational supervision in Germany is primarily organised within the individual states. Optional kindergarten education is provided for all children between three and six years old, after which school attendance is compulsory for at least nine years depending on the state. Primary education usually lasts for four to six years.[250] Secondary schooling is divided into tracks based on whether students pursue academic or vocational education.[251] A system of apprenticeship called Duale Ausbildung leads to a skilled qualification which is almost comparable to an academic degree. It allows students in vocational training to learn in a company as well as in a state-run trade school.[250] This model is well regarded and reproduced all around the world.[252] Most of the German universities are public institutions, and students traditionally study without fee payment.[253] The general requirement for attending university is the Abitur. According to an OECD report in 2014, Germany is the world's third leading destination for international study.[254] The established universities in Germany include some of the oldest in the world, with Heidelberg University (established in 1386), Leipzig University (established in 1409) and the University of Rostock (established in 1419) being the oldest.[255] The Humboldt University of Berlin, founded in 1810 by the liberal educational reformer Wilhelm von Humboldt, became the academic model for many Western universities.[256][257] In the contemporary era Germany has developed eleven Universities of Excellence. Germany's system of hospitals, called Krankenhäuser, dates from medieval times, and today, Germany has the world's oldest universal health care system, dating from Bismarck's social legislation of the 1880s.[259] Since the 1880s, reforms and provisions have ensured a balanced health care system. The population is covered by a health insurance plan provided by statute, with criteria allowing some groups to opt for a private health insurance contract. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Germany's health care system was 77% government-funded and 23% privately funded as of 2013[update].[260] In 2014, Germany spent 11.3% of its GDP on health care.[261] Germany ranked 21st in the world in 2019 in life expectancy with 78.7 years for men and 84.8 years for women according to the WHO, and it had a very low infant mortality rate (4 per 1,000 live births). In 2019[update], the principal cause of death was cardiovascular disease, at 37%.[262] Obesity in Germany has been increasingly cited as a major health issue. A 2014 study showed that 52 percent of the adult German population was overweight or obese.[263] Culture in German states has been shaped by major intellectual and popular currents in Europe, both religious and secular, and its scientists, writers and philosophers have played a significant role in the development of Western thought.[264] Global opinion polls from the BBC revealed that Germany is recognised for having the most positive influence in the world in 2013 and 2014.[265][266] Germany is well known for such folk festivals as the Oktoberfest and Christmas customs, which include Advent wreaths, Christmas pageants, Christmas trees, Stollen cakes, and other practices.[267][268] As of 2024[update], UNESCO inscribed 54 properties in Germany on the World Heritage List.[269] There are a number of public holidays in Germany determined by each state; 3 October has been a national day of Germany since 1990, celebrated as the Tag der Deutschen Einheit (German Unity Day).[270] German classical music includes works by some of the world's most well-known composers. Dieterich Buxtehude, Johann Sebastian Bach and Georg Friedrich Händel were influential composers of the Baroque period. Ludwig van Beethoven was a crucial figure in the transition between the Classical and Romantic eras. Carl Maria von Weber, Felix Mendelssohn, Robert Schumann and Johannes Brahms were significant Romantic composers. Richard Wagner was known for his operas. Richard Strauss was a leading composer of the late Romantic and early modern eras. Karlheinz Stockhausen and Wolfgang Rihm are important composers of the 20th and early 21st centuries.[271] In 2013, Germany was the second-largest music market in Europe, and fourth-largest in the world.[272] German popular music of the 20th and 21st centuries includes the movements of Neue Deutsche Welle, pop, Ostrock, heavy metal/rock, punk, pop rock, indie, Volksmusik (folk music), schlager pop and German hip hop. German electronic music gained global influence, with Kraftwerk and Tangerine Dream pioneering in this genre.[273] DJs and artists of the techno and house music scenes of Germany have become well known (e.g. Paul van Dyk, Felix Jaehn, Paul Kalkbrenner, Robin Schulz and Scooter).[274] German painters have influenced Western art. Albrecht Dürer, Hans Holbein the Younger, Matthias Grünewald and Lucas Cranach the Elder were important German artists of the Renaissance, Johann Baptist Zimmermann of the Baroque, Caspar David Friedrich and Carl Spitzweg of Romanticism, Max Liebermann of Impressionism and Max Ernst of Surrealism. Several German art groups formed in the 20th century; Die Brücke (The Bridge) and Der Blaue Reiter (The Blue Rider) influenced the development of expressionism in Munich and Berlin. The New Objectivity arose in response to expressionism during the Weimar Republic. After World War II, broad trends in German art include neo-expressionism and the New Leipzig School.[275] German designers became early leaders of modern product design.[276] The Berlin Fashion Week and the fashion trade fair Bread & Butter are held twice a year.[277] Architectural contributions from Germany include the Carolingian and Ottonian styles, which were precursors of Romanesque. Brick Gothic is a distinctive medieval style that evolved in Germany. Also in Renaissance and Baroque art, regional and typically German elements evolved (e.g. Weser Renaissance).[275] Vernacular architecture in Germany is often identified by its timber framing (Fachwerk) traditions and varies across regions, and among carpentry styles.[278] When industrialisation spread across Europe, classicism and a distinctive style of historicism developed in Germany, sometimes referred to as Gründerzeit style. Expressionist architecture developed in the 1910s in Germany and influenced Art Deco and other modern styles. Germany was particularly important in the early modernist movement: it is the home of Werkbund initiated by Hermann Muthesius (New Objectivity), and of the Bauhaus movement founded by Walter Gropius.[275] Ludwig Mies van der Rohe became one of the world's most renowned architects in the second half of the 20th century; he conceived of the glass façade skyscraper.[279] Renowned contemporary architects and offices include Pritzker Prize winners Gottfried Böhm and Frei Otto.[280] German literature can be traced back to the Middle Ages and the works of writers such as Walther von der Vogelweide and Wolfram von Eschenbach. Well-known German authors include Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Friedrich Schiller, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing and Theodor Fontane. The collections of folk tales published by the Brothers Grimm popularised German folklore on an international level.[281] The Grimms also gathered and codified regional variants of the German language, grounding their work in historical principles; their Deutsches Wörterbuch, or German Dictionary, sometimes called the Grimm dictionary, was begun in 1838 and the first volumes published in 1854.[282] Influential authors of the 20th century include Gerhart Hauptmann, Thomas Mann, Hermann Hesse, Heinrich Böll, and Günter Grass.[283] The German book market is the third-largest in the world, after the United States and China.[284] The Frankfurt Book Fair is the most important in the world for international deals and trading, with a tradition spanning over 500 years.[285] The Leipzig Book Fair also retains a major position in Europe.[286] German philosophy is historically significant: Gottfried Leibniz's contributions to rationalism; the enlightenment philosophy by Immanuel Kant; the establishment of classical German idealism by Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling; Arthur Schopenhauer's composition of metaphysical pessimism; the formulation of communist theory by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels; Friedrich Nietzsche's development of perspectivism; Gottlob Frege's contributions to the dawn of analytic philosophy; Martin Heidegger's works on Being; Oswald Spengler's historical philosophy; and the development of the Frankfurt School have all been very influential.[287] The largest internationally operating media companies in Germany are Bertelsmann, Axel Springer SE and ProSiebenSat.1 Media. Germany's television market is the largest in Europe, with over 38 million TV households as of 2012.[288] Around 90% of German households have cable or satellite TV, with a variety of free-to-view public and commercial channels.[289] There are more than 300 public and private radio stations in Germany; Germany's national radio network is the Deutschlandradio and the public Deutsche Welle is the main German radio and television broadcaster in foreign languages.[289] Germany's print market of newspapers and magazines is the largest in Europe.[289] The papers with the highest circulation are Bild, Süddeutsche Zeitung, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung and Die Welt.[289] The largest magazines include ADAC Motorwelt and Der Spiegel.[289] Germany has a large video gaming market, with over 34 million players nationwide.[290] The Gamescom is the world's largest gaming convention.[291] German cinema has made major technical and artistic contributions to film. The first works of the Skladanowsky Brothers were shown to an audience in 1895. The renowned Babelsberg Studio in Potsdam was established in 1912, thus being the first large-scale film studio in the world. Early German cinema was particularly influential with German expressionists such as Robert Wiene and Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau. Director Fritz Lang's Metropolis (1927) is referred to as the first major science-fiction film. After 1945, many of the films of the immediate post-war period can be characterised as Trümmerfilm (rubble film). East German film was dominated by the state-owned film studio DEFA, while the dominant genre in West Germany was the Heimatfilm (\"homeland film\").[292] During the 1970s and 1980s, New German Cinema directors such as Volker Schlöndorff, Werner Herzog, Wim Wenders, and Rainer Werner Fassbinder brought West German auteur cinema to critical acclaim. The Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film (\"Oscar\") went to the German production The Tin Drum (Die Blechtrommel) in 1979, to Nowhere in Africa (Nirgendwo in Afrika) in 2002, and to The Lives of Others (Das Leben der Anderen) in 2007. Various Germans won an Oscar for their performances in other films. The annual European Film Awards ceremony is held every other year in Berlin, home of the European Film Academy. The Berlin International Film Festival, known as \"Berlinale\", awarding the \"Golden Bear\" and held annually since 1951, is one of the world's leading film festivals. The \"Lolas\" are annually awarded in Berlin, at the German Film Awards.[293] German cuisine varies from region to region and often neighbouring regions share some culinary similarities, including with the southern regions of Bavaria and Swabia, Switzerland, and Austria. International varieties such as pizza, sushi, Chinese food, Greek food, Indian cuisine, and doner kebab are also popular. Bread is a significant part of German cuisine and German bakeries produce about 600 main types of bread and 1,200 types of pastries and rolls (Brötchen).[294] German cheeses account for about 22% of all cheese produced in Europe.[295] In 2012 over 99% of all meat produced in Germany was either pork, chicken or beef. Germans produce their ubiquitous sausages in almost 1,500 varieties, including Bratwursts and Weisswursts.[296] The national alcoholic drink is beer.[297] German beer consumption per person stands at 110 litres (24 imp gal; 29 US gal) in 2013 and remains among the highest in the world.[298] German beer purity regulations date back to the 16th century.[299] Wine has become popular in many parts of the country, especially close to German wine regions.[300] In 2019, Germany was the ninth-largest wine producer in the world.[301] The 2018 Michelin Guide awarded eleven restaurants in Germany three stars, giving the country a cumulative total of 300 stars.[302] Football is the most popular sport in Germany. With more than 7 million official members, the German Football Association (Deutscher Fußball-Bund) is the largest single-sport organisation worldwide,[303] and the German top league, the Bundesliga, attracts the second-highest average attendance of all professional sports leagues in the world.[304] The German men's national football team won the FIFA World Cup in 1954, 1974, 1990, and 2014,[305] the UEFA European Championship in 1972, 1980 and 1996,[306] and the FIFA Confederations Cup in 2017.[307] Germany is one of the leading motor sports countries in the world. Constructors like BMW and Mercedes are prominent manufacturers in motor sport. Porsche has won the 24 Hours of Le Mans race 19 times, and Audi 13 times (as of April 2024[update]).[308] The driver Michael Schumacher has set many motor sport records during his career, having won seven Formula One World Drivers' Championships.[309] Sebastian Vettel is also among the most successful Formula One drivers of all time.[310] German athletes historically have been successful contenders in the Olympic Games, ranking third in an all-time Olympic Games medal count when combining East and West German medals prior to German reunification.[311] In 1936 Berlin hosted the Summer Games and the Winter Games in Garmisch-Partenkirchen. Munich hosted the Summer Games of 1972.[312][313] Sources 51°N 9°E﻿ / ﻿51°N 9°E﻿ / 51; 9",

The country's full name is sometimes shortened to the FRG (or the BRD, in German). To the north of Germany are the North and Baltic Seas, and the kingdom of Denmark. To the east of Germany are the countries of Poland and the Czech Republic. To the south of Germany are the countries of Austria and Switzerland. To the west of Germany are the countries of France, Luxembourg, Belgium, and the Netherlands. The total area of Germany is 357,021 square kilometres (137,847 square miles). Most of Germany has warm summers and cold winters. In March 2021, Germany had a population of 83.1 million people, the second-largest in Europe after Russia.[10] After the United States, Germany is the second most popular country for migration in the world.[11] Before it was called Germany, it was called Germania. In the years A.D. 900 – 1806, Germany was part of the Holy Roman Empire. From 1949 to 1990, Germany was made up of two countries called the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) and the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). During this time, the capital city of Berlin was divided into a west and an east part. On 13 August 1961, East Germany started building the Berlin Wall between the two parts of Berlin. West Germany was one of the countries that started the European Union.[12] Germany gained importance as the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation, which was the first Reich (this word means empire). It was started by Charlemagne who became the first Holy Roman Emperor in 800 AD, and it lasted until 1806, the time of the Napoleonic Wars.[13] After, German nation-states were made sovereign in Central Europe. During the mid-1800s, Prussia was led by Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, who is sometimes known as the \"Father of Germany\". He led a process to bring the German people together under one country. In 1866, Prussia won a war against Austria and their allies. During this time, Prussia founded the North German Confederation. The treaty of unification of Germany was made in Versailles after Germany won the Franco-Prussian War in 1871.[14] This began the Second Reich. The biggest state in the new German Empire was Prussia. The rulers were called Kaisers or \"German Emperors\", but they did not call themselves \"Emperors of Germany\". There were many smaller states in the Empire, but not Austria. Germany stayed an empire for 50 years. It joined the other European empires in the Scramble for Africa and fought wars to make large parts of Africa and Oceania its colonies.[15] It killed many Nama and Herero people who did not want to be ruled by Germany.[15][16] Today, those colonies have become seven states: Togo, Cameroon, Namibia, Rwanda, Burundi, Tanzania, and Papua New Guinea.[15] Germany was in World War I with their ally Austria-Hungary, and again declared war on France.[14] The war became slow in the west and became trench warfare. Many men were killed on both sides without winning or losing. In the Eastern Front the soldiers fought with the Russian Empire and won there after the Russians gave up. The war ended in 1918 because the Germans could not win in the west and gave up. Germany's emperor also had to give up his power, and most of Germany's African colonies were taken by other European empires.[14][17] France took Alsace from Germany and Poland got the Danzig corridor. After a revolution, the Second Reich ended, and the democratic Weimar Republic began. After the war, there were a lot of problems with money in Germany because of the Peace Treaty of Versailles, which made Germany pay for the costs of World War I and the worldwide Great Depression.[18] The Third Reich was Nazi Germany; it lasted 12 years, from 1933 to 1945.[19] It started after Adolf Hitler became the head of government. On 23 March 1933, the Reichstag (parliament) passed the Enabling Act, which let Hitler's government command the country without help from the Reichstag and the presidency. This gave him total control of the country and the government.[20] Hitler, in effect, became a dictator. Hitler wanted to unify all Germans in one state and did this by taking over places where Germans lived, such as Austria and Czechoslovakia; Hitler also wanted the land in Poland that Germany had owned before 1918, but Poland refused to give it to him. He then invaded Poland. This started World War II on 1 September 1939. In the beginning of the war, Germany was winning and even successfully invaded France. It managed to take over much of Europe. However, Germany attacked the Soviet Union in 1941 and after the Battle of Kursk, the German Eastern Front began a slow retreat until war's end. On 8 May 1945, Germany gave up after Berlin was captured, Hitler had killed himself a week earlier. Because of the war, Germany lost a lot of German land east of the Oder-Neiße line, and for 45 years, Germany was split into West Germany and East Germany. Other events happened during the war in Nazi Germany, including the Holocaust, the mass genocide of Jews and other peoples, for which some Nazis were punished in the Nuremberg Trials. After World War II Germany was occupied by the allies and in 1949 it was divided into 2 states: West Germany and East Germany, who were stuck in the Cold War. The capital city of Berlin was divided between the two by the Berlin Wall. In 1989 there was a process of reforms in East Germany, which lead to the opening of the Berlin Wall and to the end of socialist rule in Germany. These events are known as the Wende or the Friedliche Revolution (Peaceful Revolution) in Germany. After that, East Germany joined West Germany in 1990.[21] The new Germany is a part of the European Union.[22] Germany is a constitutional federal democracy.[23] Its political rules come from the 'constitution' called Basic Law (Grundgesetz), written by West Germany in 1949. It has a parliamentary system, and the parliament elects the head of government, the Federal Chancellor (Bundeskanzler). The current Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, is a man who used to live in West Germany. The people of Germany vote for the parliament, called the Bundestag (Federal Assembly), every four years.[24] Government members of the 16 States of Germany (Bundesländer) work in the Bundesrat (Federal Council). The Bundesrat can help make some laws.[25] The head of state is the Bundespräsident (Federal President). This person has no real powers but can order elections for the Bundestag. The current president is Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD). The judiciary branch (the part of German politics that deals with courts) has a Bundesverfassungsgericht (Federal Constitutional Court). It can stop any act by the law-makers or other leaders if they feel they go against Germany's constitution. The opposition parties are the CDU, CSU, Die Linke and the AfD. Germany is one of the largest countries in Europe. It stretches from the North Sea and Baltic Sea in the north to the high mountains of the Alps in the south. The highest point is the Zugspitze on the Austrian border, at 2,962 metres (9,718 ft).[25] Germany's northern part is very low and flat (lowest point: Neuendorf-Sachsenbande at −3.54 m or −11.6 ft). In the middle, there are low mountain ranges covered in large forests. Between these and the Alps, there is another plain created by glaciers during the ice ages. Germany also contains parts of Europe's longest rivers, such as the Rhine (which makes up a part of Germany's western border, while Oder River is on its eastern border), the Danube and the Elbe.[25] In Germany there are sixteen states (Bundesländer): In these states there are 301 Kreise (districts) and 114 independent cities, which do not belong to any district. Germany has a mostly continental climate, but the northern German coast has an oceanic climate. The highest temperature ever recorded in Germany was 41.2 °C (106.2 °F), on 25 July 2019 in Duisburg and Tönisvorst.[27] The lowest temperature ever recorded in Germany was −45.9 °C (−50.6 °F), on 24 December 2001 in Funtensee.[28] Germany has one of the world's largest technologically powerful economies. Bringing West and East Germany together and making their economy work is still taking a long time and costing a lot of money.[29] Germany is the largest economy in Europe and the fourth-largest in the world by nominal gross domestic product (GDP).[30] In September 2011, the inflation rate in Germany was 2.5%. The unemployment rate of Germany was 5.5% as of October 2011.[31] Germany is one of the G8 countries. The main industry area is the Ruhr area.[32] The country has companies like BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, Porsche, Siemens, Bosch, SAP, BASF and more. Germany's most exported products are cars.[33] Nearly all German companies are small- or medium-sized.[30] Most of the people in Germany are ethnically Germans, but the country also has many ethnic minorities. There are at least seven million people from other countries living in Germany. Some have political asylum, and some are guest workers (Gastarbeiter). Many people from poor or dangerous countries go to Germany for safety. Many others move to Germany without permission. About 50,000 ethnic Danish people live in Schleswig-Holstein, in the north. About 60,000 Sorbs (a Slavic people) live in Germany too, in Saxony and Brandenburg. About 12,000 people in Germany speak Frisian; this language is the closest language to English that is still spoken today. In northern Germany, people outside towns speak Low Saxon. Most of the people who have come to Germany are from Turkey. Germany has about 1.9 million Turkish immigrants and they own many businesses there. Turkish people introduced the Doner kebab and became a popular fast food in Germany. Other small groups of people in Germany are Croats (0.2 million), Italians (0.6 million), Greeks (0.4 million), Russians, and Poles (0.3 million). There are also some ethnic Germans who lived in the old Soviet Union (1.7 million), Poland (0.7 million), and Romania (0.3 million). These people have German passports, so they are not counted as foreigners. A lot of these people do not speak German at home.[25] Christianity is the biggest religion; Protestants are 38% of the people (mostly in the north) and Catholics are 34% of the people (mostly in the south).[25] There are also many Muslims, while the other people (26.3%) are either not religious, or belong to smaller religious groups.[25] In the eastern regions, the former territory of the GDR (known as the DDR in German), only one fifth of the population is religious. Germany has one of the world's highest levels of schooling, technology, and businesses. The number of young people who attend universities is now three times more than it was after the end of World War II, and the trade and technical schools of Germany are some of the best in the world. German income is, on average, $25,000 a year, making Germany a highly middle class society. A large social welfare system gives people money when they are ill, unemployed, or similarly disadvantaged. Millions of Germans travel outside of their country each year. The four recognized minorities in Germany are Danes 50,000 (concentrated in Schleswig-Holstein state), Frisians 60,000-70,000 (based in Eastern and Northern Frisia), Sorbs 60,000 (primarily in Saxony and Brandenburg) and Romani and Sinti.[34] Germany is a very densely populated country, and especially in cities the housing situation is difficult and rents are high. Already in 2014 there were 39,000 homeless people in Germany and 339,000 people without an apartment.[35] Here is a link to a German video report[36] from a German news magazine. The video is about refugees, who have been living in a sports gym in Berlin for over a year with no privacy. In the video people discuss amongst others why there are problems to find living space in containers. The containers are similar to those in Zaatari refugee camp. Germany's constitution says that all people can believe in any religion they want to, and that no one is allowed to discriminate against somebody because of the person's religion. In ancient times, Germany was largely pagan. Roman Catholicism was the biggest religion in Germany up to the 15th century, but a major religious change called the Reformation changed this. In 1517, Martin Luther said that the Catholic Church used religion to make money. Luther started Protestantism, which is as big as the Catholic religion in Germany today. Before World War II, about two-thirds of the German people were Protestant and one-thirds were Roman Catholic. In the north and northeast of Germany, there were a lot more Protestants than Catholics. Today, about two-thirds of German people (more than 55 million people) call themselves Christian, but most of them do not practice it. About half of them are Protestants and about half are Roman Catholics.[37] Most German Protestants are members of the Evangelical Church in Germany. The previous Pope, Benedict XVI, was born in Germany. Before World War II, about one percent of the country's people were German Jews. Today, Germany has the fastest-growing group of Jewish people in the world. Many of them are in Berlin. Ten thousand Jews have moved to Germany since the fall of the Berlin Wall; many came from countries that were in the Soviet Union. Schools teaching about the things that happened when the Nazis were in power, as well as teaching against the ideas of the Nazis, has helped to make Germany very tolerant towards other people and cultures, and now many people move there from countries that may not be so tolerant. About three million Muslims live in Germany, 3.7% of the total population.[37][38] The country also has a large atheist and agnostic population, and there are also large about 0.6 million Hinduism follower and some small group of Jain, Buddhist and Zoroastrian communities. The 20th century has also seen a neopagan revival. Germany has a long history of poets, thinkers, and artists. There are 240 supported theaters, hundreds of orchestras, thousands of museums and over 25,000 libraries in Germany. Millions of tourists visit these attractions every year. Some of the greatest classical musicians including Johann Sebastian Bach, Ludwig van Beethoven and possibly Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart were German. Some of the most revered scientists today like Albert Einstein are German. Artists like Marc Engelhard are active in the 21st century.[39][40][41] Germany has created a high level of gender equality, disability rights, and accepts homosexuality. Gay marriage has been legal in Germany since 2017. Doner kebab is often considered a popular German-Turkish fast food. But more traditional foods of German cuisine are sausage based such as Bratwurst and Currywurst. German food varies from region to region. For example, in the southern regions, such as Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg, they share their type of food with Switzerland and Austria. Everywhere in Germany, meat is eaten as a sausage. Even though wine use is increasing, the national alcoholic drink is beer. The number of Germans who drink beer is one of the highest in the world. German restaurants are often rated the second-best, with France rated first place. Football (soccer) is the most popular sport in Germany. The national team has won the FIFA World Cup 4 times, and appears in the finals a lot. The top football league in Germany is Bundesliga. Also, the German Football Association (Deutscher Fußball-Bund) is the largest in the world. A lot of big football teams are from Germany, like FC Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund, RB Leipzig and many others. Some of the world's best footballers come from Germany too. These would include Mesut Özil, Manuel Neuer, Serdar Tasci, Michael Ballack, Bastian Schweinsteiger, Franz Beckenbauer, and so on. Plus, many tournaments have taken place in Germany. The most recent was the 2006 FIFA World Cup, and the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup. The Audi Cup takes place in Germany every year in Munich. Germany is also known for its motor sports. Successful German racing drivers include Michael Schumacher and Sebastian Vettel. Successful tennis players have also come from Germany, including Steffi Graf and Boris Becker. More recently, Sabine Lisicki reached the Women's Singles final at Wimbledon in 2013. Lastly, Germany is one of the best countries in the Olympic Games. Germany is the third in the list of the most Olympic Games medals in history (mixed with West and East Germany medals). The country finished first place in the 2006 Winter Olympics, second place in the 2010 Winter Olympics. Germany also got fifth place in the 2008 Summer Olympics.

                "title": "Tulane Green Wave vs. Florida Gators Live Score and Stats - December 20, 2024 Gametracker - CBSSports.com",
                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. TAMPA, Fla. (AP) DJ Lagway and Florida put together a strong finish to a difficult season. They closed it out in the Gasparilla Bowl. Lagway shook off a mistake-filled first half to throw for 305 yards and a touchdown in Florida's sloppy 33-8 victory over Tulane on Friday. Trey Smack kicked a Gasparilla Bowl-record four field goals for the Gators (8-5), who also got a late TD run from walk-on running back Anthony Rubio, son of U.S. Senator Marco Rubio, in their fourth consecutive victory. “Great to finish the right way,” Florida coach Billy Napier said. Tulane (9-5), which played without starting quarterback Darian Mensah, was outgained 529 yards to 194 and didn't score until Ty Thompson threw a TD pass in the final minute. A true freshman who sparked Florida's turnaround from a 3-3 start to the season, Lagway finished 22-of-35 passing with two interceptions that contributed to the Gators only leading 6-0 at halftime. Late in the game, Lagway mishandled a snap on fourth-and-1 only to have running back KD Daniels scoop up the ball and run 25 yards for a touchdown. Rubio, a 5-foot-9 redshirt freshman from Miami who had not appeared in a college game, entered in the fourth quarter. With 449-pound defensive lineman Desmond Watson lined up in the backfield in front of him, he ran for 8 yards on his first carry and eventually finished a nine-play drive with a 9-yard run that increased Florida's lead to 33-0. Watson, a 6-foot-5 senior who wears No. 21, gained 1 yard for a first down on the only carry of his career. “You saw the sideline light up when he ran on the field,” Napier said, adding the plan to use Watson in a goal-line or short-yardage situation was hatched one day on the practice field. Initially, he was to be used exclusively as a blocker or a decoy in the passing game. Watson was elated when a play was added to give him an opportunity to run the ball. “I can do it all,” the nose tackle said, smiling. The Gators won five of seven after their disappointing start, with most of the surge coming after athletic director Scott Strickin guaranteed Napier would return in 2025. Lagway became the starting quarterback after Graham Mertz was lost to a season-ending knee injury in October. Tulane, which lost its last three games, played without Mensah, who entered the transfer portal and decided to continue his career at Duke after leading the Green Wave to an appearance in the American Athletic Conference championship game, where they lost to Army. A loss in the regular-season finale to Memphis knocked Tulane out of the Top 25. “I hate the way it ended,” Tulane coach Jon Sumrall said. Thompson, who transferred to Tulane from Oregon in 2024, made his first college start - and possibly played his final game for the Green Wave. He also has entered the transfer portal, with the intent of finding a team that wants him to start full-time, though he hasn't ruled out the possibility of returning to the Green Wave. Tulane avoided a shutout when Thompson tossed a 16-yard TD pass to Mario Williams. The Green Wave quarterback finished 11 of 29 for 125 yards and three interceptions. Lagway showed flashes of why Florida feels good about its future with him running the offense, but also made some poor decisions with the ball. His end-zone interception cost the Gators at least three points, and he also was unable to get the ball into the end zone after a 38-yard completion to Chimere Dike gave Florida a first down at the Tulane 3 early in the third quarter. Thompson's audition for a shot at the Green Wave's starting job did not go well. The junior generally is a better runner than passer, however he wasn't effective doing either against the Gators. Florida opens next season at home against LIU, while Tulane hosts Northwestern. Both teams begin Aug. 30. --- Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season. Sign up here.

                "title": "Party City Closing Over 700 Stores: What we Know - Newsweek",
                "content": "Party City is closing all of its stores, according to a corporate meeting that CNN first reported on. Newsweek reached out to Party City's press team for comment via email. Party City has over 700 stores across North American and has been in business for nearly 40 years. CEO Barry Litwin told corporate employees on Friday that Party City would be \"winding down\" operations immediately. Friday is the employees' last day. \"That is, without question, the most difficult message that I've ever had to deliver,\" Litwin said at the meeting, which was conducted over video conference. Litwin pointed to financial challenges, adding that the company's \"very best efforts have not been enough to overcome\" them. \"It's really important for you to know that we've done everything possible that we could to try to avoid this outcome,\" Litwin said. \"Unfortunately, it's necessary to commence a wind-down process immediately.\" A judge signed off on Party City's reorganization plans in September of 2023, which brought the chain out of bankruptcy. Party City filed for bankruptcy in January of 2023, when it had $1.7 billion in debt. The reorganization plan approved in September canceled nearly $1 billion of debt and closed some stores. But Party City was still $800 million in debt after that. In a press release from the end of October, Party City called itself \"a global leader in celebrations industry\" and \"North America's largest party goods retailer.\" Shopping giant Party City has over 700 company-owned and franchise store locations throughout North America. As of 2021, the chain employed 6,400 full-time and 10,100 part-time workers. In a filing from August, Party City's financial adviser, Moelis & Co, estimated that the company was worth between $450 million and $775 million. The company also operates Amscan, which designs, manufactures and distributes celebration products like costumes, decor and tableware. Litwin was hired as Party City's new CEO four months ago, according to a LinkedIn post he wrote at the time. \"Our main priority is to strengthen our financial health, and there is work ahead of us,\" Litwin said in the post. \"However, our success is rooted in our people and culture.\" Litwin has not posted about the closing. His last LinkedIn post was a month ago, in which he touted \"Party City's impressive traffic growth during the crucial Halloween drive period.\" He also still lists himself as the CEO of Party City, as of the time this story was published. Party City has not posted to its X (formerly Twitter) account since October 26, 2023. According to a company press release from October, Party City has over 700 stores in North America. The CEO told employees December 20 is their last day. The closures are effective immediately. The national retailer Big Lots also announced that it is going out of business. Newsweek reached out to Big Lots' press team over email for comment. The company put out a press release December 19 stating saying it is \"preparing to commence going out of business sales at all remaining Big Lots store locations.\" The news release said Big Lots \"does not anticipate completing its previously announced asset purchase agreement with Nexus Capital Management.\" The sale will start in the coming days and the company said its goal is to complete a sale by early January. \"We all have worked extremely hard and have taken every step to complete a going concern sale,\" CEO Bruce Thorn said in the press release. \"While we remain hopeful that we can close an alternative going concern transaction, in order to protect the value of the Big Lots estate, we have made the difficult decision to begin the GOB process.\" Bruce Millard, senior vice president and chief marketing officer at Big Lots, on LinkedIn: \"Yesterday was a tough day at Big Lots. We're starting the process to close all remaining stores. While the news is tough to take, it's not due to a lack of talent in the marketers and merchants on the team. This is one of the strongest groups I've ever had the opportunity to work with!\" Griffin Gold, senior assistant store manager at Spencer's and former Big Lots employee, on LinkedIn: \"I found out about Big Lots closing while at my former store today. While I worked there, this store had a strong sense of community. It's terrible that this is happening less than a week before christmas. I can't even imagine how employees are feeling right now and the stress of losing a job during this time of the year, not to mention in this particular job market.\" Betsy Petrovic, marketing manager at CQL, on LinkedIn: \"Not surprising, but still very sad - and a sign of the increased competition from other retailers and eCommerce. Party City announced today that all employees are terminated and stores are closing. This follows on the heels of BigLots announcing its closure on Thursday. I truly pray for our economy and for those struggling with being out of work, especially during right before the holidays.\" Party City will close effective immediately, and Big Lots will begin holding its going out of business sales at all locations.

                "content": "Our editors found last-minute holiday gifts for everyone on your list Sections Shows More Follow today More Brands After nearly four decades of supplying celebrations, the confetti has finally settled for Party City. The company announced this week that it will box up its stores for good, according to CNN. On Dec. 20, Party City CEO Barry Litwin informed corporate employees via video conference that the company was closing and that the day would be their last day of work. The employees were also informed that severance pay would not be provided. On the same day as the meeting, some employees received letters notifying them that stores would close on Feb. 28, 2025, after which staff would be terminated. TODAY.com has reached out to Party City for comment but did not immediately hear back. CNN viewed the announcement to employees and reports that Litwin emphasized towards the end of the meeting that the news was “without question the most difficult message that I’ve ever had to deliver.” Litwin cited the party suppliers' ongoing financial challenges as the reason for the closure, saying the company's “very best efforts have not been enough to overcome.” The CEO, who was appointed four months ago, cited inflation driving down consumer spending as the company's greatest challenge. “It’s really important for you to know that we’ve done everything possible that we could to try to avoid this outcome,” Litwin added. “Unfortunately, it’s necessary to commence a winddown process immediately.” The retailer, which is based out of New Jersey, exited bankruptcy one month after Litwin’s arrival after filing in January 2023 to address $1.7 billion in debt. The report underscored employee reaction, noting that many expressed “fury” over the lack of transparency in internal Microsoft Teams chats. Many expressed that they’d been blindsided by the news, noting that there had been no hints of financial troubles from management during town hall meetings. Instead, they had expressed a bright outlook regarding Party City’s overall performance.

                "content": "Solána Imani Rowe (born November 8, 1989), known professionally as SZA (/ˈsɪzə/ SIZ-ə), is an American singer-songwriter. She first gained recognition through her self-released EPs See.SZA.Run (2012) and S (2013), which helped her become the first female artist to sign with Top Dawg Entertainment. Her third EP, Z (2014), was her first project to be released to digital retailers and reached the top-ten on the U.S. Independent Albums chart. After signing a joint recording contract with RCA Records, SZA released her debut studio album, Ctrl (2017). It was met with critical and commercial success, earning four Grammy Award nominations and becoming the second longest-charting R&B album by a female artist on the Billboard 200.[1] The following year, SZA was nominated for the Golden Globe and Academy Awards for Best Original Song via her collaboration with Kendrick Lamar on the U.S. and UK top-ten single \"All the Stars\".[2] Her featured appearance on Doja Cat's \"Kiss Me More\" broke the record for the longest-running all-female collaboration within the U.S. top ten,[3] and won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance. SZA's second album, SOS (2022), spent ten non-consecutive weeks atop the Billboard 200 and broke the record for the largest streaming week for an R&B album in the U.S. Supported by six singles, including the top-ten songs \"Good Days\",[4] \"I Hate U\",[5] \"Nobody Gets Me\" and \"Snooze\", SZA earned her first number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100 with \"Kill Bill\" in 2023. She later earned her second chart-topping single of the year with her guest appearance on Drake's \"Slime You Out\". She will start her acting debut in the Issa Rae-produced film One of Them Days (2025). SZA has received several accolades in her career, including four Grammy Awards, a Brit Award, an American Music Award, a Guild of Music Supervisors Award, and two Billboard Women in Music awards (including Woman of the Year). As a songwriter, she has co-written songs for Nicki Minaj, Beyoncé, Travis Scott, Schoolboy Q, and Rihanna. In 2024, she was honored with the Hal David Starlight Award from the Songwriters Hall of Fame.[6] Solána Imani Rowe was born on November 8, 1989, in St. Louis, Missouri. She grew up in Maplewood, New Jersey, often returning to St. Louis to visit her mother's family.[7][8][9][10] Her father was an executive producer at CNN, while her mother was an executive at AT&T. Rowe has an older half-sister, Panya Jamila.[8][11] Her mother is Christian and her father is Muslim.[11] She was raised as a Muslim and continues to follow Islam.[8] It's like the belief in one God, all the pillars of Islam et cetera, and I think those are ideas that will never leave me, those make sense in my spirit. It's the way that I connect with God; it has always made sense to me. I think I would love to wear my hijab but I feel like I don't wanna wear my hijab and talk crazy on stage and be in videos with Travis Scott. Like I don't wanna be disrespectful because I have too much love and respect for the religion, for my father, and for myself.[12] She attended a Muslim prep school every day after her regular schooling, where she used to wear hijab. After the September 11 attacks, Rowe was subjected to bullying in 7th grade, leading her to stop wearing one.[8][13] Rowe attended Columbia High School, where she was active in sports, including gymnastics and cheerleading.[14][12] After graduating from high school in 2008,[15] Rowe later went to three separate colleges, finally settling at Delaware State University to study marine biology.[8][11] She eventually dropped out in her last semester, taking on a variety of jobs in order to make money.[11][16][17] Rowe formed her stage name from the Supreme Alphabet, taking influence from rapper RZA of the Wu-Tang Clan. The last two letters in her name stand for Zig-Zag and Allah, while the first letter S can mean either savior or sovereign.[8] SZA first met members of Top Dawg Entertainment during the CMJ New Music Report in 2011, when her boyfriend's clothing company sponsored a show in which Kendrick Lamar was performing. Her early music was given to TDE president Terrence \"Punch\" Henderson, who was surprised with the quality of the material.[18] The two stayed in touch, and after SZA began generating buzz with the release of her two EPs, TDE stepped in to sign her in 2013, making her the label's first female artist. SZA's early music was recorded with her friends and neighbors in which they \"stole a bunch of beats off the Internet\".[16] On October 29, 2012, SZA self-released her debut EP See.SZA.Run.[19] On April 10, 2013, SZA released her second EP, S, which was met with positive reviews from music critics.[20][21] SZA promoted the extended play with the release of a music video for the song \"Ice Moon\", directed by Lemar & Dauley.[22] On July 14, 2013, Top Dawg signed SZA.[23] In October 2013, SZA went on a four show tour with Swedish band Little Dragon; starting on October 17 at the El Rey Theater in Los Angeles and ending on October 24 at the Music Hall of Williamsburg, Brooklyn, NY.[24] In December 2013, SZA released the song \"Teen Spirit\" which was followed by the release of a remix featuring American rapper 50 Cent, along with a music video directed by APlusFilmz.[25] In 2014, SZA featured on a variety of songs from her label-mates albums including two songs for Isaiah Rashad's debut EP Cilvia Demo as well as featuring on Schoolboy Q's first album Oxymoron.[26][27] On March 26, 2014, she released the single \"Child's Play\" featuring Chance the Rapper and produced by Dae One & XXYYXX.[28] A studio EP, Z, was released on April 8, 2014; the lead single, \"Babylon\" was accompanied with a music video directed by APlusFilmz.[29] To promote Z, SZA performed at several performance showcases at the SXSW Music Festival in Austin, Texas.[29] SZA made her chart debut in the UK, where Z charted at number thirty-two on the R&B Charts, during the week ending April 19, 2014.[30] Z debuted on the U.S. Billboard 200 at number thirty nine, selling 6,980 copies in its opening week; the album also peaked at number nine on the Billboard Hip hop/R&B chart.[31] SZA subsequently began recording her fourth EP, A.[32] In July 2014, SZA featured on Kitty Cash's single \"Moodring\".[33] Later that month, SZA released a collaboration with Jill Scott called \"Divinity\".[34] On July 11, 2014, SZA released a video for her song \"Julia\" from Z.[35] In December SZA and The Internet supported Aiko's \"Enter The Void\" tour.[36] On November 18, 2014, SZA released a song called \"Sobriety\".[37] Whilst working on A, (now repackaged as her debut album[38] and later retitled Ctrl), SZA began writing songs for other women including Beyoncé and Rihanna. Along with Rihanna and Tyran Donaldson, SZA co-wrote \"Consideration\" for Rihanna's album Anti (2016); besides writing, SZA also appeared on the track and later performed \"Consideration\" with Rihanna live at the 2016 Brit Awards on February 24, 2016.[39][40] After signing a contract with RCA Records on April 28, 2017,[41][42] SZA released Ctrl, her debut studio album, on June 9. Originally scheduled for 2015, the release was marred by several delays rooted in disagreements between SZA and Top Dawg executives. She had been stressing over curating the right tracks and erasing any perceived imperfections from the album that one day, in 2016, she posted on Twitter to say she would quit music and let Punch release Ctrl. Sometime in mid-2017, an unknown person took the hard drive that contained the music.[43] Ctrl was released to universal acclaim from music critics, scoring an 86 out of 100 rating on Metacritic.[44] It also debuted at number three on the U.S. Billboard 200,[45] with 125,000 album-equivalent units, of which 80,000 were pure album sales. The album was supported by several singles; the first, \"Drew Barrymore\", was released in January 2017.[46] The second, \"Love Galore\", peaked in the Top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100 chart and was later certified platinum.[47] Ctrl was ranked as the best album of 2017 by Time.[48] From August 2017 to February 2018, SZA promoted the album on a North American and Oceanic concert tour consisting of more than fifty shows.[49] SZA opened for the European portion of Bryson Tiller's \"Set It Off Tour\" in support of his album True to Self from October 17, 2017, to November 30, 2017, separate from SZA's tour.[50] In August 2017, SZA collaborated with American pop rock band Maroon 5 on their single \"What Lovers Do\" from their sixth studio album Red Pill Blues. The single reached number 9 on the Billboard Hot 100. This marked SZA's first top-ten hit as a featured artist on the Hot 100. The following month SZA released \"Quicksand\", which appeared on the soundtrack for HBO's Insecure,[51] and, alongside Khalid and Post Malone, was featured on the remix version of Lorde's single \"Homemade Dynamite\", from her second studio album Melodrama.[52] Also in 2017, SZA worked on a joint album with Mark Ronson and Tame Impala.[53] On November 28, 2017, SZA received five Grammy nominations including one for Best New Artist. She received the most nominations of any women artist for the 2018 Awards and was the fourth most nominated artist in total.[54] Despite this, she did not end up winning any of the awards she was nominated for.[55] In January 2018, SZA featured with Kendrick Lamar on the track \"All the Stars\", which was released as the lead single to the soundtrack album of the film Black Panther.[56][57] The single peaked at number 7 on the Billboard Hot 100, and this made SZA's second top-ten hit on the chart, after Maroon 5, \"What Lovers Do\" which peaked at number 9 on the chart. SZA collaborated with Cardi B on the track \"I Do\" for Cardi's album Invasion of Privacy.[58] In May 2019, SZA featured on DJ Khaled's eleventh studio album, Father of Asahd, on the track \"Just Us\". A music video was later released for the song.[59] On February 26, 2020, SZA and Justin Timberlake released \"The Other Side\", a song part of the Trolls World Tour soundtrack, alongside its music video.[60] In March 2020, SZA signed with WME for representation in all areas.[61][62] SZA performed, together with artists such as Bruce Springsteen, Bon Jovi and Halsey, a benefit concert for the state of New Jersey, in support of the state's work fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. It took place on April 22, 2020, through at-home performances and the revenue will go to the New Jersey Pandemic Relief Fund.[63][64] On May 25, 2020, SZA showed interest on Twitter in releasing \"a music dump\" of previously unreleased material, potentially containing 20 songs.[65] In August 2020, SZA tweeted and deleted, \"At this point y'all gotta ask punch\", referring to Terrence \"Punch\" Henderson, who is president of Top Dawg Entertainment. In another tweet, SZA indicated that \"all [Punch] says to her\" about releasing new music is \"soon\".[66] This revealed that her relationship with her label owner Punch (Top Dawg Entertainment) has been hostile since the delays of her second album which was last announced back in an interview in 2019.[67] SZA came back with her first release as a lead artist since 2017 on September 4, 2020, with \"Hit Different\", featuring Ty Dolla Sign, and production from The Neptunes.[67][68] On December 25, 2020, SZA released \"Good Days\" on streaming platforms as a single after it originally debuted as a snippet in the outro of the \"Hit Different\" music video.[69] English singer Jacob Collier provided background vocals for the single.[70] The song hit its peak of number 9 on the Billboard Hot 100,[71] making it SZA's first top-ten single as a solo artist, despite SZA herself revealing that it was not initially planned to be a single.[72] Both tracks were expected to appear on her then upcoming second studio album, with only \"Good Days\" eventually making the final cut.[73] On April 9, 2021, SZA was featured on the Doja Cat single \"Kiss Me More\". It became a number-one hit in New Zealand and reached the Top 40 in over a dozen countries, further having earned top-ten placements in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, Ireland and Lithuania. The song also has a music video which premiered the same day as the single and was directed by Warren Fu. In late 2021, SZA's cover of \"The Anonymous Ones\" was released. It is a song written for the soundtrack of the 2021 film adaptation of Dear Evan Hansen. Her version of the song also plays during the closing credits of the film itself.[74] A collaboration from SZA with Summer Walker, \"No Love\" was released on November 5, 2021, after previously being teased back in late June via Walker's Instagram.[75] After its success on the R&B charts, it later became an official single when the extended version was released in March the following year, along with a music video. On December 3, 2021, SZA released the song \"I Hate U\", after it went viral on TikTok; it was originally released exclusively on SoundCloud in August 2021.[76] SZA confirmed after the 64th Annual Grammy Awards that she had finished her second album and is planning on releasing it \"soon\".[77] On June 9, 2022, SZA released a deluxe version of her debut studio album Ctrl to commemorate its 5-year anniversary. It featured 7 previously unreleased songs, such as \"2AM\", \"Jodie\", \"Percolator\", and an alternative version of \"Love Galore\" without Travis Scott. On October 28, 2022, a new single titled \"Shirt\" was released alongside a music video starring actor LaKeith Stanfield.[78] The song was originally teased by SZA in late-2020 and after it gained popularity on TikTok because of a viral challenge, a snippet appeared as an outro at the end of the official music video of \"Good Days\".[79] SZA teased another snippet of a song at the end of the \"Shirt\" music video, which she revealed to be called \"Blind\".[80][81] On her 33rd birthday on November 8, 2022, SZA released a teaser titled \"PSA\" on her Instagram. The video ends with a morse code for \"S.O.S.\", sparking speculations about an upcoming project.[82][83] On November 16, 2022, Billboard officially confirmed that her second studio album is titled SOS and was set for a December release date.[84] On November 30, 2022, SZA posted the cover of her upcoming album SOS to her Instagram account.[85] After performing \"Shirt\" and \"Blind\" on NBC's Saturday Night Live, SZA announced that the album would be released on December 9, 2022.[86] The album spent its first seven weeks atop the Billboard 200 Albums Chart in the United States, becoming the longest-running number-one woman album of the decade and the first R&B album to spend its first seven weeks atop the chart since Whitney Houston's Whitney (1987).[87] To promote the album, SZA embarked on an arena tour in 2023—the SOS Tour.[88][89] The tour consists of 54 shows across North American and Europe.[90] Omar Apollo, d4vd and Raye served as the opening acts.[91][92] On November 22, 2024, labelmate Kendrick Lamar released his sixth studio album GNX. SZA was prominently featured on its third track, \"Luther\", providing vocals on two verses as well as its chorus. She also appeared on the album's closing track, \"Gloria\", performing the chorus and outro.[93] On November 25, 2024, SZA announced she would release a new album before the end of the year on Kai Cenat's Mafiathon 2 Twitch stream that also featured Lizzo. She also did a interview with British Vogue where she said that she had 'projects in development'.[94] She will make her acting debut in the Issa Rae-produced film One of Them Days (2025), alongside Keke Palmer. Growing up, SZA was exposed by her family to artists from different genres, which were formative influences for her music.[95] Her mother enjoyed R&B and church music,[96] her father was a fan of jazz and funk musicians like Miles Davis, Billie Holiday, and John Coltrane,[13][97] and her sister listened to melodic rap and hip hop artists like Tupac Shakur.[1][95] SZA listens to Ella Fitzgerald for vocal influence[98] and has said that Lauryn Hill is one of her personal influences.[99] SZA has expressed admiration for singer Ashanti, citing her as a major inspiration and someone she has loved since childhood.[100] SZA also cites Meelah, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, LFO, Macy Gray, Common, Björk, Jamiroquai, and \"a lot of Wu, Nas, Mos Def, Hov\" as inspirations.[8] Speaking on her influences, SZA said: \"[My] personal influences came from dancing with American Ballet Theatre and doing pieces to Björk [music]. That's the only time I had really any outside influence to music. So, the people that I fell in love with on a musical level were always much older. Jamiroquai is just, like, the shit for me.\"[101] In an interview for Live Nation Entertainment, SZA described the meeting she had with Beyoncé for the writing of the song \"Feeling Myself\", affirming \"Beyoncé might be the most perfect, beautiful being I've ever met in my whole life. She's the most inspirational woman on earth, next to my mother\". SZA also spoke about Rihanna, admiring her strong and confident attitude, of someone who does only the music she wants to do, and that if there's anybody that she could imagine singing her words, it would be Rihanna.[102] SZA's songs are built over \"layers of sliced, delayed, and reversed vocals\" and contains \"twists and mutates\",[103][19] and her vocal style has been described as taking on the \"lilt\" of a jazz singer.[104] SZA is known as TDE's first woman signee and first singer, which also drew attention during the early stages of her career.[105] According to Marissa G. Muller of Rolling Stone magazine, SZA's vocals alternate between a \"vapory husk and a sky-high falsetto\".[106] Jordan Sargent of Pitchfork magazine labeled SZA's vocals as being \"chillwave\" and \"ethereal\".[107] SZA began writing songs due to being \"passionate\" about writing, and enjoyed poetry; when writing lyrics, SZA \"freestyles\" them in order to express whatever comes to her \"mind\", noting that it does not always make sense to herself.[16] Thematically, SZA's work contains \"unravelling lyrics\", that touch upon themes of sexuality, nostalgia, and abandonment.[103] Critics have frequently described SZA as an R&B singer-songwriter,[108][109] a narrative for which she has expressed disdain[110] consistently since the beginning of her career.[111][112] The label felt disrespectful and lazy to her.[113] For her second studio album, SOS, she wanted to prove her versatility beyond R&B, disillusioned with how Black artists have been historically segregated from White artists through pigeonholing Black artists strictly within R&B music.[114][115] Other critics have written she combines R&B with rap[116][117] or pop music in her works,[118] and their attempts to pin her down to genres outside R&B has had SZA confused. She grew up listening to an eclectic combination of pop, rock, jazz, folk, and rap artists[115][119] and, as such, prefers to be labeled as someone who makes music and nothing more. She said: \"when you try to label it, you remove the option for it to be limitless. It diminishes the music.\"[119] \"Genre agnosticism\" was how Michael Madden of Consequence described SZA's musical style.[120] During an interview, SZA said she is less inspired by strictly music, and more inspired by creating art in general; she has looked up to people who were not \"typical artists\" including her \"favorite gymnast, ice-skater, saxophonist, painter, or movie director\", continuing to say she was particularly inspired by film director Spike Lee.[101] During an interview with W, SZA spoke on her style influences, saying a large amount of her style inspiration comes from movies, including Wes Anderson films, praising his use of \"pantone color palette\" and that she \"would love to dress like a character from Moonrise Kingdom. Or perhaps Bill Murray in The Life Aquatic.\"[121] Along with her music, SZA's image has been compared to neo-soul artists Lauryn Hill and Erykah Badu.[105] SZA's hair became a point of interest during the early stages of her career and she discussed it in interviews with Vogue and Harper's Bazaar.[99] During her performances, SZA tends to wear \"free-flowing\" clothes that are easy to move around in and wears pajamas or baggy clothing onstage.[122] SZA has been open about her struggles with mental health and anxiety, calling the music industry \"one of the most stressful, psychosis-inducing industries\".[123] She experienced suicidal depression after three ex-boyfriends died in quick succession, and says she worked toward self-acceptance by praying and creating music.[11] SZA dated Canadian rapper and singer Drake in 2009,[124] and was in a relationship with a fashion designer for eleven years, being engaged for five.[125] Headlining Co-headlining Supporting In her career, SZA has received four Grammy Awards, a Golden Globe nomination, and an Academy Award nomination. She has earned one American Music Award, six Billboard Music Award, four MTV Video Music Awards, six BET Awards, including Best New Artist in 2018 and Album of the Year in 2023. She received the \"Rulebreaker Award\" and \"Women of the Year\" at the Billboard Women in Music event in 2018 and 2022 respectively. SZA has also won the Soul Train Music Award for Best New Artist in 2017. In September 2022, SZA was applauded as one of the rising stars on the TIME 100 Next List.[126] At the 2022 Grammy Awards, SZA won Best Pop Duo/Group Performance with Doja Cat for their hit collaboration \"Kiss Me More\".[127] In 2023, Rolling Stone ranked SZA at number 180 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.[128]",

                "content": "The Penn State Nittany Lions team represents the Pennsylvania State University in college football. The Nittany Lions compete in the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision as a member of the Big Ten Conference, which they joined in 1993 after playing as an Independent from 1892 to 1992.[3][4][5] Established in 1887, the Nittany Lions have achieved numerous on-field successes, including two consensus national championships in 1982 and 1986; four Big Ten Conference Championships in 1994, 2005, 2008, and 2016; 13 undefeated seasons in 1887, 1894, 1909, 1911, 1912, 1920, 1921, 1947, 1968, 1969, 1973, 1986 and 1994; and 53 appearances in college bowl games, with an all-time post-season bowl record of 31–20–2. The team ranks seventh among NCAA Division I college football programs in all-time total wins.[6] The Nittany Lions play their home games at Beaver Stadium, located on-campus in University Park, Pennsylvania. The first recorded game in Penn State football history occurred on November 12, 1881, when Penn State traveled to Lewisburg, Pennsylvania to play Bucknell, known until 1886 as the University at Lewisburg. Penn State won 9–0, which was nine goals to none. At the time, this was really a game of \"American rugby\". The father of American football, Walter Camp, did not develop the \"scrimmage\", the \"first down\" and the \"gridiron\" (yard markings) until 1882. Although this game was reported in two State College newspapers and the Mirror (University at Lewisburg campus newspaper), Bucknell denies that this game ever happened. Penn State did not field teams from 1882 through 1886. Penn State played its first season in 1887,[7] but had no head coach for their first five years, from 1887 to 1891.[7] The teams played its home games on the Old Main lawn on campus in State College, Pennsylvania. They compiled a 12–8–1 record in these seasons, playing as an independent from 1887 to 1890. In 1891, the Pennsylvania Intercollegiate Football Association (PIFA) was formed. It consisted of Bucknell (University at Lewisburg), Dickinson, Franklin & Marshall, Haverford, Penn State and Swarthmore. Lafayette and Lehigh were excluded because it was felt they would dominate the Association. Penn State won the championship with a 4–1–0 record. Bucknell's record was 3–1–1 (losing to Franklin & Marshall and tying Dickinson). The Association was dissolved prior to the 1892 season.[7] George W. Hoskins was the first head football coach at Penn State.[8] He posted a 17–4–4 record in his from 1892 to 1895 as head coach, and his .760 winning percentage ranks highest in program history.[8] His first team played its home game on the Old Main lawn on campus in State College, Pennsylvania, before the 500-seat Beaver Field opened in 1893.[8] He was succeeded by Samuel B. Newton,[citation needed] who posted a 12–14 (.462) record in three seasons, 1896–1898.[9] Sam Boyle coached for only one year in 1899 and compiled a 4–6–1 record (.409).[10] Pop Golden coached the Nittany Lions for three seasons from 1900 to 1902, tallying a record of 16–12–1 (.569).[11] Daniel A. Reed took over for the 1903 season and went 5–3 (.625).[12] Tom Fennell coached the Nittany Lions for five seasons from 1904 to 1908, posting a 33–17–1 (.657) record.[13] In 1907 the school adopted the Nittany Lion mascot, a mountain lion named after nearby Mount Nittany.[14][page needed] An early mascot was \"Old Coaly\", a mule that hauled stone for the original Old Main (completed in 1863 and demolished in 1929). Bill Hollenback took over the Nittany Lions as head coach for the 1909 season and went undefeated at 5–0–2,[15] but left for Missouri for 1910.[16] Bill's older brother Jack Hollenback took over for the 1910 season and went 5–2–1 (.688),[17] but Bill returned to Penn State from 1911 to 1914.[citation needed] Bill went 23–9–2 in his second tenure for a combined record of 28–9–4 (.732).[15] In 1911 and 1912, his teams went 8–0–1 and 8–0 and were awarded retroactive national championships by the National Championship Foundation which are recognized by the NCAA.[15] Head coach Dick Harlow brought a new form of defense, trying to go in-between or around offensive blockers rather than try to overpower them.[18][non-primary source needed] Harlow's Nittany Lions compiled a 20–8 (.714) record in his three seasons (1915–1917)[19] and was later inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach for his accomplishments.[18] Hugo Bezdek was Penn State's head football coach for 12 seasons[20] and was the Nittany Lions' first athletics director.[21] Bezdek posted a 65–30–11 record,[20] which included two undefeated seasons and a berth in the 1922 Rose Bowl, a game they lost.[20] Bezdek's Nittany Lions posted a losing record in only two of Bezdek's seasons, going 1–2–1 in 1918 and 3–5–1 in 1928.[20] Bezdek retired after the 1929 season and was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1954.[21] Bob Higgins returned to his alma mater and served as Penn State's head football coach for 19 seasons.[22] He compiled a 91–57–11 overall record, which included 11 winning seasons and only five losing seasons.[22] Higgins' 1947 team tied SMU in the Cotton Bowl.[23] Higgins was forced to retire due to poor health following the 1948 season.[23] He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1954.[23] For one season, Joe Bedenk, also a Penn State alum, served as the Nittany Lions' head football coach.[24] He was promoted from offensive line coach after the retirement of his predecessor.[25] Bedenk posted a 5–4 record in his 1949,[24] his lone season as head coach, before requesting to return to his previous post as offensive line coach.[25] Rip Engle came to Penn State from Brown.[26][27] Engle posted a 104–48–4 record during his 16-season tenure as head coach and developed a game known as Angleball as a way for his players to maintain fitness in the off-season.[26][27] Engle never had a losing season at Penn State, and his 5–5 final season was his only non-winning season.[28] His 1959 and 1960 Nittany Lions teams won the Liberty Bowl, while his 1961 and 1962 teams reached the Gator Bowl, winning the first and losing the second.[28] Engle retired following the 1965 season and was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1973.[26] Penn State assistant Joe Paterno was promoted to head coach following the retirement of Engle.[25] Paterno spent 46 seasons as the head football coach, the longest tenure of any head coach in the FBS, and 16 more seasons as an assistant, making his 62 total years coaching at Penn State the most of any coach at any school.[25] Under Paterno, Penn State played as an Independent from 1966 to 1992,[25] and he continued to coach them when they joined the Big Ten Conference in 1993–2011.[25] He also served as Penn State's athletic director from 1980 to 1982. His final record is 409–136–3.[29] His teams won national championships in 1982 and 1986,[29] posted non-losing records in all seasons but five,[29] and appeared in 37 bowl games with 24 wins.[29] His teams also won the Orange Bowl in 1968, 1969, 1973 and 2005;[29] the Fiesta Bowl in 1977, 1980, 1981, 1986, 1991 and 1996;[29] the Sugar Bowl in 1982; and the Rose Bowl in 1994.[29] In June 1990,[30] Penn State's athletics program, after a century as a Division I-A independent, joined the Big Ten Conference. Beaver Stadium was expanded six times during Paterno's tenure. He was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 2006 and was a major reason why the longtime rule of waiting until retirement to be inducted into the Hall of Fame was changed to any coach over 75 years of age.[25] Players including Kerry Collins, Charlie Zapiec, Matt Millen, Shane Conlan, Jack Ham, Dennis Onkotz, Franco Harris, Greg Buttle, Keith Dorney, John Cappelletti, Curt Warner, Larry Johnson, LaVar Arrington and Ted Kwalick played collegiately for him.[31] He won numerous coaching and sportsman honors during his long run at Penn State.[29] Paterno has the most wins in FBS football (409). Following the Pennsylvania Attorney General's release of a grand jury summary of child sexual abuse charges involving former assistant Jerry Sandusky,[32] the Penn State board of trustees fired Paterno in November 2011.[32][33] Defensive coordinator Tom Bradley finished out the 2011 season as interim head coach after Paterno's ouster.[34] In July 2012, the NCAA decided to vacate all of the team's wins from 1998 to 2011. Paterno's statue outside Beaver Stadium was also taken down.[35] The revised record dropped Paterno from first to twelfth on the all-time wins list,[36] but on January 16, 2015, the NCAA restored Paterno's vacated wins, and thus his record as the winningest FBS football coach.[37] To many he is \"The best Penn State head coach ever.\"[38] New England Patriots offensive coordinator Bill O'Brien was hired as the 15th head football coach at Penn State, taking over the Nittany Lions football program in January 2012.[39] Early in O'Brien's tenure, the NCAA sanctioned Penn State with a four-season postseason ban and a loss of 40 scholarships due to the child sex abuse scandal.[40] O'Brien posted an 8–4 record in his first season as head coach of the Nittany Lions.[41] O'Brien's 2013 Nittany Lions team posted a 7–5 record in the second of four years they were ineligible for the postseason.[42] In January 2014, Bill O'Brien left Penn State to accept the head coaching position with the NFL's Houston Texans.[43] On January 11, 2014, Vanderbilt head coach James Franklin was hired as the 16th Penn State head football coach.[44] He is the first African American head football coach at Penn State.[45] In Franklin's first year, the NCAA lifted Penn State's postseason ban and the Nittany Lions were bowl eligible. The Nittany Lions were named to the Pinstripe Bowl where they won against Boston College on December 27, 2014, at Yankee Stadium.[46] To start off the 2015 season, Penn State lost to Temple 27–10, its first loss to the Owls since 1941. The loss was followed by victories against Buffalo, Rutgers, San Diego State, Army and Indiana. The Nittany Lions then lost to Ohio State 38–10 in Columbus before winning, 31–30, at Maryland. The victory against Maryland brought the Nittany Lions to six wins, making them bowl eligible for the second year since the postseason ban was lifted. Penn State then shut out the Illinois 39–0 in the second to last home game of the 2015 season. They then lost to Michigan in Happy Valley 28–16 and to Michigan State 55–16 at MSU. The win–loss record for Penn State in the 2015 regular season was 7–5, and 7–6 after a loss to Georgia in the Taxslayer Bowl in Jacksonville. The 2016 season featured an upset over No. 2 Ohio State during a \"White-Out\" in State College. Following the win, Penn State was ranked 24th in the AP Poll, its first ranking since 2011.[47] Penn State finished the regular season 10–2, 8–1 in Big Ten play. After winning a tiebreaker against rivals Ohio State, Penn State went on to claim the Big Ten East title and a spot in the Big Ten Championship game in Indianapolis against Big Ten West champion Wisconsin, which they won after trailing 28–14 in the first half. They outscored the Badgers 24–3 in the second half to take home the Nittany Lions' fourth Big Ten Title.[48] On August 18, 2017, Penn State announced that Franklin signed a six-year contract extension worth $5.738 million a year.[49] That deal includes retention bonuses paid at the end of each year of the contract. \"My family and I are very thankful to be a part of the Penn State community,\" Franklin said in a statement. \"I am pleased with the progress our program has made in the community, in the classroom and on the field. I look forward to diligently working with President Barron and Director of Athletics Sandy Barbour on implementing a plan that puts our University and our student-athletes in the best position to compete on the field and in life.\"[50] In addition to the guaranteed money, Franklin's contract extension has incentives including $800,000 for a national title, $400,000 for a College Football Playoff appearance and $350,000 for winning the Big Ten Championship Game. His incentives are capped at $1 million per year.[51] Penn State went to 7–0 to begin the 2017 season, before losing on consecutive weekends to Ohio State and Michigan State. Penn State finished the regular season with wins over Rutgers Nebraska and Maryland. Penn State capped the 2017 season at the Fiesta Bowl, beating Washington, 35–28.[52] In 2018 the Lions went 9–4 with a loss to Kentucky in the Citrus Bowl. The 2019 season was spectacular for Penn State going 11–2 with the losses only to Minnesota by 26–31 and to Ohio State and beat American Athletic Conference Champion Memphis who at that time was 12–1. Penn State beat Memphis 53–39 in the Cotton Bowl. The 2020 season was James Franklin's first losing season with the Nittany Lions. They started off the season with COVID-19 pandemic spring cancelations. Penn State traveled to Bloomington to take on Indiana where they lost in overtime 35–36 with Michael Penix Jr.'s pendulum touch two-point conversion winning the Game for Indiana. The Nittany Lions took on Ohio State at home with no whiteout due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Penn State lost 25–38. The Nittany Lions took on Maryland who they had not lost to since 2014. The Terrapins beat Penn State 19–35 in Beaver Stadium. The Nittany Lions traveled to Nebraska to take on the Nebraska Cornhuskers where the Nittany Lions comeback fell short and lost 23–30. The Nittany Lions fought the Iowa Hawkeyes but lost 21–41 giving Penn State its first ever 0–5 start in its history. The Nittany Lions, determined to win, traveled to Ann Arbor to defeat the Michigan Wolverines. Penn State got its first victory of the season 27–17 going 1–5. Penn State took on the Rutgers Scarlet Knights in Piscataway where they won again 23–7 thus giving them a 2–5 record. Penn State went home to take on the Michigan State. They trailed 10–21 at halftime but rallied back to win 39–24 getting a 3–5 record. For the Big Ten Championship week Penn State hosted the Fighting Illini at home. Penn State won in rout 56–21 going to a 4–5 record. Penn State players voted to not accept a bowl invitation so their final record was 4–5. A major offseason change was replacing first-year offensive coordinator Kirk Ciarrocca with Texas offensive coordinator Mike Yurcich. James Franklin is currently under a ten-year $75,000,000 contract (as of 2021). In 2021, Penn State improved upon its lackluster 2020 season going 7–6. The Nittany Lions finished the season unranked and with a 4–5 Big Ten Conference record. They went 2–3 on the road while maintaining a winning 5–2 record at Beaver Stadium. The season started strong on September 4, 2021, when Penn State defeated the #12 ranked Wisconsin Badgers football team. They won their next 4 games including a 28–20 win over the #22 Auburn Tigers football team. Then they began to struggle after a close 23–20 loss to the #3 Iowa Hawkeyes on the road October 9, 2021. On October 23, 2021, Penn State battled the Illinois Fighting Illini through an NCAA record 9 overtimes, eventually losing 20–18. The teams both scored fieldgoals in the first 2 overtimes, tying the score 16–16. Neither team scored until the 8th overtime when Illinois finally broke the stalemate, quickly followed by a run from Penn State's Noah Cain. Penn State did not score during its first conversion attempt in overtime 9, leaving the door open for Illinois to eventually score and win the game.[53] The Nittany Lions' only subsequent wins came against Maryland (31–14) and Rutgers (28–0). They closed out the 2021 season playing Arkansas at the Outback Bowl, losing the game 24–10.[54] Penn State has a strong 2022 campaign losing to only Michigan and Ohio State and defeating Pac 12 champion Utah in the 2023 Rose Bowl. Penn State has also been named national champions on seven occasions by NCAA-designated major selectors.[55][56]: 111–115 Penn State claims the 1982 and 1986 championships under Joe Paterno's tenure,[57] both of which are consensus national championships.[56]: 120 Historically, Penn State played as an independent from 1887 through 1890, then in 1891 as a member of the Pennsylvania Intercollegiate Football Association Penn State won the PIFA championship with a 4–1–0 PIFA record, losing only to Bucknell (Bucknell's record was 3–1–1). The PIFA dissolved prior to the 1892 season. Penn State then played as an independent again until joining the Big Ten Conference in 1990 and beginning play in 1993. Penn State then won its first Big Ten championship in 1994, they won two more in 2005 and 2008, and they won a fourth under James Franklin in 2016. † Co-champions † Co-champions Before the 2006 season, Beaver Stadium was updated and seasons of note were honored by being listed in front of the suite façade.[58] The following seasons are highlighted; Penn State has earned invitations to 53 bowl games. The Nittany Lions have compiled a bowl record of 31–20–2 (.604), including a 17–7–1 (.700) record in the major bowls (Rose, Orange, Sugar, Fiesta, and Cotton).[59] Coach Joe Paterno was responsible for most of these bids and victories, compiling more appearances (37) than any other coach in college football en route to his bowl record of 24–12–1 (.662). Paterno also has a record of 14–5 (.737) in \"major\" bowls and is the only coach to have won all five major college bowls during his career. James Franklin is the head coach of Penn State since the 2014 season.[60] Penn State and Maryland met in briefly interrupted stretches between 1917 and 1993, with a near-consecutive run played all but three years (1976, 1981, and 1983) between 1960 and 1993. However, the one-sided record belies what was often a competitive matchup until its final years. While Maryland only compiled one win and one tie, numerous games were narrowly lost by missed field goals and turnovers. In 1975, a field goal attempt by kicker Mike Sochko hit the upright with under a minute left, and Maryland lost 15–13. Ten years later, the Terps missed three field goals to eventually lose 20–18. After the Nittany Lions' move to the Big Ten Conference in 1993, the series was canceled. However, Maryland ended up joining the Big Ten as well, in 2014, reinstating the rivalry after more than 2 decades of being dormant. Maryland would win the first matchup by a point (20–19) after infamously declining to shake hands with Penn State captains at midfield during the coin toss at Beaver Stadium. The second meeting as conference foes would be played in Baltimore at M&T Bank Stadium and would again be decided by a point, this time a Penn State win 31–30. The last four matchups (2016–2019), all victories for Penn State have seen the Nittany Lions outscore the Terrapins by a combined score of 201–20 (38–14, 66–3, 38–3, 59–0). The latest match up was played on November 30, 2024, at Beaver Stadium, with Penn State winning 44–7. Penn State leads the series 44–3–1 through the 2024 season.[61] Prior to 1993, Penn State had never played against Michigan, but since then many of the games have been competitive duels with shots at a Big Ten title at stake, and subsequently a national championship. Michigan leads the series, 17–10.[62] Since 1993, Penn State has played Michigan State for the Land Grant Trophy. Penn State holds possession of the trophy after winning the 2023 contest. Penn State leads the series, 19–18–1 as of 2024.[63] When Penn State joined the Big Ten in 1993, Minnesota was the first conference opponent they played. To commerate this, the governors of both states commissioned a trophy called the Governor's Victory Bell to landmark this event. Since then, the trophy has traveled hands between the winners of each contest. Penn State leads the series, 11–6.[64] The rivalry began before Penn State was a member of the Big Ten. Penn State won the first four meetings of the series, which were held between 1912 and 1964. Then Ohio State won in 1975 in a game held in Columbus, Ohio and again in 1976 during the first ever matchup between the two teams in State College, Pennsylvania. Penn State and Ohio State would meet again in 1980 in their first and only postseason bowl, the 1980 Fiesta Bowl, which Penn State won. After the Fiesta Bowl, the two teams would not meet again until Penn State joined the Big Ten in 1993. Since then, the Nittany Lions and Buckeyes have played each other annually. Ohio State leads the series 25–14 through the 2024 season.[65] This is a long-standing series between in-state rivals Penn State and Pittsburgh. The rivalry, once one of the fiercest and most important in college football north of the Mason–Dixon line, began on November 6, 1893, at the inaugural game of Beaver Field in State College, and Penn State won the contest 32–0.[66] The first two decades of the series was dominated by Penn State taking 12 of 15 matchups between 1893 and 1912. From 1913 to 1949 Pitt would hold a 26–6–2 advantage, before Rip Engle took over as head coach for Penn State in 1950. With Joe Paterno as an assistant coach, Engle led Penn State to a 9–6–1 record against the Panthers from 1950 to 1965. When Paterno was named head coach in 1965, the next 31 games would swing heavily in the Nittany Lion's favor, holding a 23–7–1 advantage from 1966 to 2000.[67] The rivalry went on a 15-year hiatus prior to the scheduling of a 4-game series in 2011[68] that would see Penn State travel to Pittsburgh in 2016 & 2018 with Pitt returning to Happy Valley in 2017 & 2019. The series was branded the Keystone Classic in 2016,[69] which saw Pitt hold on for a thrilling 42–39[70] victory fending off a fierce fourth quarter comeback that fell short on an interception late in the 4th quarter.[71] The Nittany Lions would take the final three games, winning 33–13 in 2017, 51–6 in 2018, and most recently 17–10[72] in Beaver Stadium in 2019.[73] There are no future games scheduled between the two schools, although there is talk of a potential neutral site matchup sometime in the future.[74] The Nittany Lions and Panthers have met on the football field 100 times. Penn State holds a 10-win advantage in the series, 53–43–4, through the 2024 season.[75] The rivalry started in 1922, when Syracuse fought Penn State to a scoreless tie. But it was during the 1950s and 1960s that the rivalry intensified, as it enjoyed a competitive and often controversial string of contests. Syracuse football was led by Ben Schwartzwalder, and Penn State by Rip Engle, then Joe Paterno. From 1950 to 1970, Syracuse won 11 games to Penn State's 10. After Schwartzwalder retired in 1973, Syracuse floundered. Penn State won 16 straight from 1971 to 1986. Conference realignment and scheduling disagreements also dampened the intensity of the rivalry. Penn State fans and players increasingly turned their attention to the rivalry with Pittsburgh. In 1987, Coach Dick MacPherson finally led Syracuse to a resounding 48–21 victory over the Nittany Lions in the Carrier Dome. Syracuse won again the following year in Happy Valley but lost the last two games before the series was suspended in 1991. The rivalry has since been renewed three times since the series suspension — in 2008, 2009, and 2013. The Nittany Lions won all three of these contests. Penn State leads the series 43–23–5 with the most recent game played in 2013. Next meeting between the two teams is scheduled for September 4, 2027.[76] Penn State and West Virginia have played each other 59 times. The first game was in 1904 when Penn State won that game 34–0. In their most recent encounter on August 31, 2024, Penn State won 34–12 in Morgantown. This series has been dominated by the Nittany Lions who lead the series 50–9–2.[77] Though the Crimson Tide are not as much of a traditional opponent for the Nittany Lions, the two teams are still often considered among the best in the country, claim a combined 20 national titles, and have met in a bowl game three times. The series began on December 19, 1959, in that year's edition of the Liberty Bowl, a 7–0 win for No. 12 Penn State. Sixteen years later, the Nittany Lions and Crimson Tide met in the 1975 Sugar Bowl, resulting in a 13–6 Tide victory in New Orleans. Perhaps the most notable game between these two teams came four years later, in a 1979 Sugar Bowl rematch, resulting in another Alabama victory. The rivalry was intensified during the 1980s, when the Lions and Tide met in 10 consecutive seasons, all during regular season play. After this time, the rivalry went dormant for two decades before being renewed for a 2-game home-and-home series in 2010 and 2011. Alabama leads the series 10–5 with the last game played in 2011.[78] This White Out tradition dates back to a student section white out in 2004 (against Purdue) and has become one of the most eagerly anticipated games during the football season. In recent years, Penn State students have donned white clothes, paint - anything white - to show their solidarity and support for the Nittany Lions. Forming a mass of bouncing and infectious enthusiasm, the students have \"Whited Out\" Beaver Stadium, the Bryce Jordan Center and other sports venues, making them some of the noisiest and most intimidating stadiums in America.[79] Beano Cook of ESPN says, \"If you aren't impressed with the White Out, you're probably one of those people who think the moon landing was faked.\"[80] Originally named \"Paternoville\", Nittanyville is a student camp out that occurs every week of a Penn State home football game. The students camp out to support the team and to acquire the best possible seats for the weekend's upcoming game, since seating is first-come, first serve for students. While the name \"Paternoville\" came about during Penn State's 2005 football season, students have long camped out for first row seats. Prior to 1993, the university distributed non-seat-specific tickets. Starting the same year Penn State football began competition in the Big Ten Conference, students were assigned seats on a first-come-first-serve basis, so that the first students to pass through \"Gate A\" at the south-east corner of the stadium would be assigned first row seats, and so on down the line.[81] Since then, students have camped out in small to massive numbers in order to guarantee themselves a front row seat to a Penn State home football game. The 2005 season saw the naming of the tent-city. In anticipation of the 2005 contest between No. 16 Penn State and No. 6 Ohio State, students began camping six days in advance of the game outside the gate so that they would get a first row seat for, arguably, the biggest game of the 2005 season for Penn State. On Tuesday of the week preceding the game, \"Paternoville\" first appeared. Credited with the naming, freshman Dan Clark and the other students camping with him created a banner reading \"Paternoville\".[82] The name stuck, and on Wednesday morning, October 5, 2005, newspapers were already referring to the campsite as \"Paternoville\". State-wide, regional, and even national media outlets began paying attention to the show in front of Gate A. Local businesses printed t-shirts up for the students, brought truckloads of food, and distributed various things like magazines and small footballs to keep the students occupied. Throughout the week, players, coaches, and many alumni and media personalities paid visits to Paternoville.[83] On Friday, ESPN's \"Cold Pizza\" morning show was broadcast from in front of the Bryce Jordan Center, across from the stadium, with some of the cast walking through Paternoville interviewing students and taping their activities, despite the constant drizzle. The next day, ESPN's College Gameday also was broadcast in front of the Bryce Jordan Center, hours before the showdown between the cross-border rivals.[84] Before noon, the tents were packed away and hundreds of students began to line up for entry into the stadium. That night, in a historic game, the Nittany Lions upset the No. 6 ranked Buckeyes 17–10 in front of a crowd of almost 110,000. The game being decided on a fumble by Ohio State quarterback and future Heisman Trophy winner Troy Smith, caused by Penn State defensive end Tamba Hali and recovered by defensive tackle Scott Paxson. After the final whistle, the students rushed the field.[85] The Paternoville name continued after the game. Since the original \"Paternoville\", two other games have garnered comparable camp-outs. They were the 2005 game against the University of Wisconsin Badgers, which was Senior Day for the 2005 season,[86] and the 2006 contest against University of Michigan Wolverines. However, students camp out for every game, not solely the \"big\" games. On average, about 10–15 tents appear for every game, while the number of tents for the 2005 Ohio State and Wisconsin games and the 2006 Michigan game exceeded 100.[87] Prior to the 2006 season, the university placed several markers around Beaver Stadium commemorating various traditions related to Penn State football. To the left of Gate A there is a marker for the Penn State \"student section\" and to the right of the gate there is a marker for \"Paternoville\".[88] Since 2006, the practice of camping out has grown every year until 2009, when over 2,000 different students camped out for one or multiple games throughout the season. In 2011, the record was broken because of Penn State's high-powered home schedule, which included SEC powerhouse Alabama and new in-conference foe Nebraska, amongst other teams.[89] In the summer of 2012, \"Paternoville\" officially became \"Nittanyville\". As Coach Paterno was no longer the coach of Penn State's football team, the organization decided that since it was unlikely another coach would stay as long as Coach Paterno had, changing the name for each new coach would be impractical. However, aside from the name, nothing was changed and students continued to support the team and camp out for the primary seats.[90] Joe Paterno was widely known for his \"grand experiment\" in which he challenged his players to be successful both on the field and in the classroom.[91] In 2011, the Nittany Lion football team posted an 87% graduation rate, tied with Stanford for No. 10 overall among the nation's 120 Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) institutions, above the national average of 67%.[92] The June 2012 conviction of former assistant coach Jerry Sandusky on multiple counts of child sexual abuse marred the \"Success with Honor\" image.[93] President Rodney Erickson, athletics director Dave Joyner, and head football coach Bill O'Brien, all of whom accepted their jobs in the wake of the scandal, have made statements in which they express commitment to maintaining integrity at the university and within the athletics programs.[94] In 2012, a group of alumni and supporters established a non-profit organization [501(c)(3) and registered trademark] that will build upon the \"Success with Honor\" motto. Their mission is to promote and support charitable endeavors as well as to inspire others to \"Get in the Game.\" Success with Honor is a Social Network Community that has identified more than 60+ charities. Success with Honor helps individuals to identify and connect with causes they would like to volunteer their skills, time, and/or money to. Similarly, SWH assists charities in finding individuals to meet their current needs.[95] The team is widely noted for their simple game uniforms. They only wear white pants, and the jerseys are simple blue for home games, and white for away games.[96] The team is only allowed to wear simple black Nike shoes with white calf socks for game days, though blue tights are permitted underneath the white socks for cold weather games. The helmet is white with a blue stripe down the center, and a blue on white \"Penn State\" sticker covers up the forehead helmet logo. No team logos, conference logos, numbers, or other stickers are permitted on the helmet, though two Nike logos are on facemask visors that some players choose to wear. Penn State has started to wear bowl decals only starting with 1997 Fiesta Bowl. Before that, Penn State always declined the decals so they can play out of their simple game uniforms. The blue and white uniforms replaced the school's original colors, pink and black, in 1890 after a student referendum. A common legend of the color change is that the original colors faded in the sun. Black became a hue of navy blue and the pink became such a light hue that it appeared white. The historicity of this, however, is very questionable, as evidence of it being the root cause is scarce.[97] The uniforms became even simpler for the 2011 season, as the white cuffs and collars on the home jerseys and the corresponding blue cuffs and collars on the road jerseys were eliminated, leaving the jerseys solid blue and white, respectively. In 2012 Penn State started wearing names on their uniforms for the first time as a way to note the players who stuck with the school through the scandal and a blue ribbon in support the victims of child abuse.[98] In 2013, the Nittany Lion logo was added to the base of the jersey collar along with the Big Ten logo on the right side of the jersey. Starting in 2015, the names that were added throughout the 2012–14 seasons to honor those who stayed with the program were removed and the team reverted to the traditional nameless jerseys while still retaining the Nittany Lion logo at the base of the jersey collar. The team also began sporting new Nike Elite 51 jerseys which feature a new design on the collars.[99] In addition, the team added the words \"Nittany Lions\" onto the back of the football helmets. For the 2017 homecoming game against the Indiana Hoosiers, Penn State broke tradition by donning throwback jerseys in what was dubbed the \"Generations of Greatness\" game. These uniforms integrated elements from past uniforms, including: numbers on helmets' sides, block uniform numbers, white stripes on sleeves, blue stripes on pants, striped socks, gray facemasks, white cleats, and a few other subtle changes.[100] Captains are chosen by the team, with the head coach's approval. Being named a captain is an honor almost always given to a senior, but there are some notable exceptions: Linebacker Sean Lee was named a captain in the beginning of Spring practice in 2008, the beginning of his 4th year with the team. However, he suffered a torn ACL during spring practice, redshirted in 2008, and returned as a captain again in 2009. The most recent example of a \"true\" junior being named was Paul Posluszny, who was named a captain in both 2005 and 2006, his junior and senior years, respectively. The last time a junior was named captain before Posluszny was in 1968, when Steve Smear and Mike Reid were named captains during their junior years.[101] In 2014, Christian Hackenberg became the first true sophomore to be named team captain.[102] Penn State is referred to as Linebacker U for its reputation of producing outstanding linebackers.[103][better source needed] The scandal centered on then retired Penn State football assistant coach Jerry Sandusky's sexual assault of two underage boys on or near university property. After a grand jury investigation, Sandusky was indicted on 52 counts of child molestation dating from 1994.[110] The trial started on June 11, 2012, at the Centre County Courthouse in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania,[111][112] and ended on June 22, when the jury found Sandusky guilty on 45 counts.[113][114] On October 9, 2012, Sandusky was sentenced to 30–60 years in prison.[115] Several high-level school officials were charged with perjury,[116] suspended, or dismissed for allegedly covering up the incidents or failing to notify authorities. School president Graham Spanier was forced to resign, and head football coach Joe Paterno was fired without cause late in the season, while Sandusky maintained his innocence.[117] Former FBI director Louis Freeh, whose firm was hired by the Penn State Board of Trustees to conduct an investigation, concluded, after ostensibly conducting 400 interviews and reviewing 3.5 million documents, that Paterno, Spanier, Curley and Schultz had \"repeatedly concealed critical facts relating to Sandusky's abuse from the authorities, the Board of Trustees, Penn State community, and the public at large.\"[118][119][120] In an interview on 60 Minutes Sports, the former Chief Deputy Attorney General of Pennsylvania, Frank Fina, who investigated and prosecuted Sandusky, stated he found no evidence that Paterno participated in a cover-up.[121] In July 2012, NCAA announced it had fined the Penn State football program $60 million, levied a 4-year ban from bowl games and vacated all the program's 112 wins from 1998 to 2011. The program was originally scheduled to lose 10 scholarships from incoming classes in 2013–16, which would have been a loss of 40 scholarships.[122] In September 2013, the NCAA announced they were restoring 25 of the 40 scholarships to Penn State \"[d]ue to Penn State University's continued progress toward ensuring athletics integrity\". After losing 10 scholarships from the 2013–2014 incoming class and only having 75 total players on scholarship, Penn State gained five scholarships back for 2014–15, bringing in 20 new players with 80 total on scholarship. Full scholarships were regained for 2016–17. In total they lost only 15 scholarships.[123] The decision to return the scholarships was by the executive committee of the NCAA following a recommendation from former US Sen. George Mitchell. The NCAA had appointed Mitchell to monitor progress of Penn State's reforms to enhance their \"security, ethics, governance and compliance structure\". The decision was based upon the belief the restored scholarships would provide benefits to student-athletes.[124] Lawsuits were filed against NCAA related to the levy of penalties. In 2014 the NCAA, under the auspices of favorable reports from Mitchell, announced that Penn State would be eligible for the 2014 postseason and all scholarships restored in 2015.[125] The team's wins and records that had been vacated were restored, pending full approval, as part of a legal settlement in 2015.[126][127] Penn State is one of 11 schools with five or more inductees in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.[144] Including former head coach Joe Paterno, 26 Nittany Lion players and coaches have been selected for the College Football Hall of Fame.[145] [146][147]",

                "content": "The Six Triple Eight is a 2024 American war drama film written and directed by Tyler Perry, on the 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion, an all-black and all-female battalion, in World War II.[2] The film features an ensemble cast which includes Kerry Washington, Ebony Obsidian, Milauna Jackson, Kylie Jefferson, Shanice Shantay, Sarah Jeffery, Pepi Sonuga, Moriah Brown, Gregg Sulkin, Susan Sarandon, Dean Norris, Sam Waterston and Oprah Winfrey. The Six Triple Eight was released in select cinemas on December 6, 2024, before its streaming debut by Netflix on December 20, 2024. The film is based on the 2019 WWII History magazine article, \"Fighting a Two-Front War\", by Kevin M. Hymel on the contributions of the 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion, an all-black and all-female battalion, in World War II. It was announced in December 2022 that Tyler Perry would be writing and directing the film Six Triple Eight for Netflix.[3] The film is based on historian Kevin M. Hymel's article, \"Fighting a Two-Front War\", published in the February 2019 issue of WWII History magazine.[4] In January 2023, the cast, including Kerry Washington, Sam Waterston, Susan Sarandon and Oprah Winfrey was announced, with Washington also joining as an executive producer.[5] Filming began on January 17, 2023, in Atlanta.[6] Production also occurred in Little Germany, Bradford and at Imperial War Museum Duxford in February.[7][8] Filming took place in Cedartown, Georgia on March 28, 2023.[9] In February 2024, Six Triple Eight was reported to be part of Netflix's 2024 release calendar, with a specific date yet to be announced.[10][11][12] In August 2024, it was announced that the film, now titled The Six Triple Eight, would be released in a limited theatrical release on December 6, 2024, with a streaming release two weeks later on December 20 on Netflix.[13] The Six Triple Eight received mixed reviews from critics. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 44% of 25 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.1/10.[14] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 56 out of 100, based on nine critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews.[15] Film critic Peter Debruge from Variety gave it a positive review, writing: \"The Six Triple Eight gives Perry his best and most substantial feature to date (only 2010’s ensemble melodrama For Colored Girls comes close)... The film boasts a large enough cast to launch a dozen or so careers, and yet, one performance stands head and shoulders above the others: That would be Washington’s forceful turn as Adams, who holds her own against arrogant white officers.\"[16] Frank Scheck from The Hollywood Reporter also gave it a positive review, praising Obsidian and Washington' performances.[17] Jesse Hassenger from The Guardian gave it 2/5 stars, writing: \"Kerry Washington hams it up in the writer-director’s stodgy ode to a battalion of women in the second world war who deserve far better\".[18]",

                "content": "Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. (/ˈrɒbɪnɪt ˈbaɪdən/ ⓘ ROB-in-it BY-dən; born November 20, 1942) is an American politician who has been the 46th and current president of the United States since 2021. A member of the Democratic Party, he served as the 47th vice president from 2009 to 2017 under President Barack Obama and represented Delaware in the U.S. Senate from 1973 to 2009. Born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, Biden moved with his family to Delaware in 1953. He received a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Delaware in 1965 and a Juris Doctor from Syracuse University in 1968. He was elected to the New Castle County Council in 1970 and the U.S. Senate in 1972. As a senator, Biden drafted and led the effort to pass the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act and the Violence Against Women Act. He also oversaw six U.S. Supreme Court confirmation hearings, including the contentious hearings for Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas. Biden ran unsuccessfully for the 1988 and 2008 Democratic presidential nominations. In 2008, Obama chose Biden as his running mate, and he was a close counselor to Obama during his two terms as vice president. In the 2020 presidential election, the Democratic Party nominated Biden for president. He selected Kamala Harris as his running mate, and they defeated Republican incumbents Donald Trump and Mike Pence. He became the oldest president in U.S. history and the first to serve with a female vice president. As president, Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent recession. He signed bipartisan bills on infrastructure and manufacturing. He proposed the Build Back Better Act, which failed in Congress, but aspects of which were incorporated into the Inflation Reduction Act that he signed into law in 2022. Biden appointed Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court. He worked with congressional Republicans to resolve the 2023 debt-ceiling crisis by negotiating a deal to raise the debt ceiling. In his foreign policy, Biden restored America's membership in the Paris Agreement. He oversaw the complete withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan that ended the war in Afghanistan, leading to the collapse of the Afghan government and the Taliban seizing control. He responded to the Russian invasion of Ukraine by imposing sanctions on Russia and authorizing civilian and military aid to Ukraine. During the Israel–Hamas war, Biden condemned the actions of Hamas as terrorism and sent military aid to Israel, as well as limited humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip. In April 2023, Biden announced his reelection campaign and, after the Democratic primaries, became the party's presumptive nominee in the 2024 presidential election. Concerns about Biden's age and health persisted throughout his term, with renewed scrutiny after his performance during the first presidential debate on June 27. On July 21, he withdrew his candidacy, becoming the first U.S. president to decline to seek reelection after securing enough delegates to win renomination. Biden endorsed Vice President Harris to be the Democratic presidential nominee. Harris won the nomination but lost the general election to Trump. Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. was born on November 20, 1942,[1] at St. Mary's Hospital in Scranton, Pennsylvania,[2] to Catherine Eugenia \"Jean\" Biden (née Finnegan; 1917–2010) and Joseph Robinette Biden Sr. (1915–2002)[3][4] The oldest child in a Catholic family of mostly Irish descent, along with English and French; he has a sister, Valerie, and two brothers, Francis and James. The Biden surname traces back to William Biden, an ancestor of his who emigrated from England to Maryland around 1820.[5] Biden's father had been wealthy and the family purchased a home in the affluent Long Island suburb of Garden City in the fall of 1946,[6] but he suffered business setbacks around the time Biden was seven years old,[7][8][9] and for several years the family lived with Biden's maternal grandparents in Scranton.[10] Scranton fell into economic decline during the 1950s and Biden's father could not find steady work.[11] Beginning in 1953 when Biden was ten,[12] the family lived in an apartment in Claymont, Delaware, before moving to a house in nearby Mayfield, Delaware.[13][14][8][10] Biden Sr. later became a successful used-car salesman, maintaining the family in a middle-class lifestyle.[10][11][15] At Archmere Academy in Claymont,[16] Biden played baseball and was a standout halfback and wide receiver on the high school football team.[10][17] Though a poor student, he was class president in his junior and senior years.[18][19] He graduated in 1961.[18] At the University of Delaware in Newark, Biden briefly played freshman football,[20][21] and, as an unexceptional student,[22] received a Bachelor of Arts degree with a double major in history and political science in 1965.[23][24] Biden had a stutter and has mitigated it since his early twenties.[25] He has described his efforts to reduce it by reciting poetry before a mirror.[19][26] Biden married Neilia Hunter, a student at Syracuse University, on August 27, 1966,[23][27] after overcoming her parents' disinclination for her to wed a Catholic. Their wedding was held in a Catholic church in Skaneateles, New York.[28] They had three children: Joseph R. \"Beau\" Biden III, Robert Hunter Biden, and Naomi Christina \"Amy\" Biden.[23] Biden earned a Juris Doctor from Syracuse University College of Law in 1968. In his first year of law school, he failed a course because he plagiarized a law review article for a paper he wrote, but the failing grade was later stricken. His grades were relatively poor, and he graduated 76th in a class of 85 students.[22] He was admitted to the Delaware bar in 1969.[1] Biden clerked at a Wilmington law firm headed by prominent local Republican William Prickett in 1968 and, he later said, \"thought of myself as a Republican\".[29][30] He disliked incumbent Democratic Delaware governor Charles L. Terry's conservative racial politics and supported a more liberal Republican, Russell W. Peterson, who defeated Terry in 1968.[29] Local Republicans attempted to recruit Biden, but he registered as an Independent because of his distaste for Republican presidential candidate Richard Nixon.[29] In 1969, Biden practiced law, first as a public defender and then at a law firm headed by a locally active Democrat,[31][29] who named him to the Democratic Forum, a group trying to reform and revitalize the state party;[32] Biden subsequently reregistered as a Democrat.[29] He and another attorney also formed a law firm.[31] Corporate law did not appeal to him, and criminal law did not pay well.[10] He supplemented his income by managing properties.[33] Biden ran for the 4th district seat on the New Castle County Council in 1970 on a liberal platform that included support for public housing in the suburbs.[34][35] The seat had been held by Republican Henry R. Folsom, who was running in the 5th District following a reapportionment of council districts.[36][37][38] Biden won the general election, defeating Republican Lawrence T. Messick, and took office on January 5, 1971.[39][40] He served until January 1, 1973, and was succeeded by Democrat Francis R. Swift.[41][42] During his time on the county council, Biden opposed large highway projects, which he argued might disrupt Wilmington neighborhoods.[42] Biden had not openly supported or opposed the Vietnam War until he ran for Senate and opposed Richard Nixon's conduct of the war.[43] While studying at the University of Delaware and Syracuse University, Biden obtained five student draft deferments at a time when most draftees were sent to the war. Based on a physical examination, he was given a conditional medical deferment in 1968; in 2008, a spokesperson for Biden said his having had \"asthma as a teenager\" was the reason for the deferment.[44] Biden defeated Republican incumbent J. Caleb Boggs to become the junior U.S. senator from Delaware in 1972. He was the only Democrat willing to challenge Boggs and, with minimal campaign funds, he was thought to have no chance of winning.[31][10] Family members managed and staffed the campaign, which relied on meeting voters face-to-face and hand-distributing position papers,[45] an approach made feasible by Delaware's small size.[33] He received help from the AFL-CIO and Democratic pollster Patrick Caddell.[31] His platform focused on the environment, withdrawal from Vietnam, civil rights, mass transit, equitable taxation, health care and public dissatisfaction with \"politics as usual\".[31][45] A few months before the election, Biden trailed Boggs by almost thirty percentage points,[31] but his energy, attractive young family, and ability to connect with voters' emotions worked to his advantage,[15] and he won with 50.5% of the vote.[45] A few weeks after Biden was elected senator, his wife Neilia and one-year-old daughter Naomi were killed in an automobile accident while Christmas shopping in Hockessin, Delaware, on December 18, 1972.[23][46] Neilia's station wagon was hit by a semi-trailer truck as she pulled out from an intersection. Their sons Beau (aged 3) and Hunter (aged 2) were in the car and were taken to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, Beau with a broken leg and other wounds and Hunter with a minor skull fracture and other head injuries.[47] Biden considered resigning to care for them,[15] but Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield persuaded him not to.[48] Biden contemplated suicide and was filled with anger and religious doubt.[49][50] He wrote that he \"felt God had played a horrible trick\" on him[51] and had trouble focusing on work.[52][53] Biden met teacher Jill Tracy Jacobs in 1975 on a blind date.[54] They married at the United Nations chapel in New York on June 17, 1977,[55][56] and spent their honeymoon at Lake Balaton in the Hungarian People's Republic.[57][58] Biden credits her with the renewal of his interest in politics and life.[59] The couple attends Mass at St. Joseph's on the Brandywine in Greenville, Delaware.[60][61][62] In 1981, the couple had a daughter, Ashley Biden.[23] She is a social worker and married to physician Howard Krein.[63] Jill helped raise her stepsons, Hunter and Beau, who were seven and eight respectively at the time of her marriage. Hunter has worked as a Washington lobbyist and investment adviser; his business dealings, personal life, and legal troubles have come under significant scrutiny during his father's presidency. In December 2024, Biden pardoned Hunter following his conviction on gun and tax charges despite repeated promises that he would not do so.[64][65][66][67] Beau became an Army judge-advocate in Iraq and later Delaware attorney general;[68] he died of brain cancer in 2015.[69][70] From 1991 to 2008, as an adjunct professor, Biden co-taught a seminar on constitutional law at Widener University School of Law.[71][72] He sometimes flew back from overseas to teach the class.[73][74][75] Secretary of the Senate Francis R. Valeo swore Biden in at the Delaware Division of the Wilmington Medical Center in January 1973.[76][47] Present were his sons Beau (whose leg was still in traction from the automobile accident) and Hunter and other family members.[76][47] At age 30, he was the seventh-youngest senator in U.S. history.[77] To see his sons, Biden traveled by train between his Delaware home and D.C.[78]—74 minutes each way—and maintained this habit throughout his 36 years in the Senate.[15] Elected to the U.S. Senate in 1972, Biden was reelected in 1978, 1984, 1990, 1996, 2002, and 2008, regularly receiving about 60% of the vote.[79] He was junior senator to William Roth, who was first elected in 1970, until Roth was defeated in 2000.[80] As of 2024[update], he was the 19th-longest-serving senator in U.S. history.[81] During his early years in the Senate, Biden focused on consumer protection and environmental issues and called for greater government accountability.[82] In a 1974 interview, he described himself as liberal on civil rights and liberties, senior citizens' concerns and healthcare, but conservative on other issues, including abortion and military conscription.[83] Biden was the first U.S. senator to endorse Jimmy Carter for president in the 1976 Democratic primary.[84] Carter went on to win the Democratic nomination and defeat incumbent Republican President Gerald Ford in the 1976 election. Biden also worked on arms control.[85][86] After Congress failed to ratify the SALT II Treaty signed in 1979 by Soviet general secretary Leonid Brezhnev and President Jimmy Carter, Biden met with Soviet foreign minister Andrei Gromyko to communicate American concerns and secured changes that addressed the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's objections.[87] He received considerable attention when he excoriated Secretary of State George Shultz at a Senate hearing for the Reagan administration's support of South Africa despite its continued policy of apartheid.[29] In a congressional hearing in 1984, he objected to the Strategic Defense Initiative plan to construct autonomous systems of ICBM defense.[88][89] In the mid-1970s, Biden was one of the Senate's strongest opponents of race-integration busing. His Delaware constituents strongly opposed it, and such opposition nationwide later led his party to mostly abandon school integration policies.[90] In his first Senate campaign, Biden had expressed support for busing to remedy de jure segregation, as in the South, but opposed its use to remedy de facto segregation arising from racial patterns of neighborhood residency, as in Delaware; he opposed a proposed constitutional amendment banning busing entirely.[91] Biden supported a 1976 measure forbidding the use of federal funds for transporting students beyond the school closest to them.[90] He co-sponsored a 1977 amendment closing loopholes in that measure, which President Carter signed into law in 1978.[92] Biden became ranking minority member of the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1981. He was a Democratic floor manager for the successful passage of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act in 1984. His supporters praised him for modifying some of the law's worst provisions, and it was his most important legislative accomplishment to that time.[93] In 1994, Biden helped pass the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, which included a ban on assault weapons,[94][95] and the Violence Against Women Act,[96] which he has called his most significant legislation.[97] The 1994 crime law was unpopular among progressives and criticized for resulting in mass incarceration;[98][99] in 2019, Biden called his role in passing the bill a \"big mistake\", citing its policy on crack cocaine and saying that the bill \"trapped an entire generation\".[100] Biden voted for a 1993 provision that deemed homosexuality incompatible with military life, thereby banning gay people from serving in the armed forces.[101][102] In 1996, he voted for the Defense of Marriage Act, which prohibited the federal government from recognizing same-sex marriages, thereby barring people in such marriages from equal protection under federal law and allowing states to do the same.[103] In 2015, the act was ruled unconstitutional in Obergefell v. Hodges.[104] Biden was critical of Independent Counsel Ken Starr during the 1990s Whitewater controversy and Lewinsky scandal investigations, saying \"it's going to be a cold day in hell\" before another independent counsel would be granted similar powers.[105] He voted to acquit during the impeachment of President Clinton.[106] During the 2000s, Biden sponsored bankruptcy legislation sought by credit card issuers.[15] Clinton vetoed the bill in 2000, but it passed in 2005 as the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act,[15] with Biden being one of only 18 Democrats to vote for it, while leading Democrats and consumer rights organizations opposed it.[107] As a senator, Biden strongly supported increased Amtrak funding and rail security.[79][108] In February 1988, after several episodes of increasingly severe neck pain, Biden underwent surgery to correct a leaking intracranial berry aneurysm.[109][110] While recuperating, he suffered a pulmonary embolism, a serious complication.[110] After a second aneurysm was surgically repaired in May,[110][111] his recuperation kept him away from the Senate for seven months.[112] Biden was a longtime member of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary. He chaired it from 1987 to 1995 and was a ranking minority member from 1981 to 1987 and again from 1995 to 1997.[113] As chair, Biden presided over two highly contentious U.S. Supreme Court confirmation hearings.[15] When Robert Bork was nominated in 1988, Biden reversed his approval‍—‌given in an interview the previous year‍—‌of a hypothetical Bork nomination. Conservatives were angered,[114] but at the hearings' close Biden was praised for his fairness, humor, and courage.[114][115] Rejecting the arguments of some Bork opponents,[15] Biden framed his objections to Bork in terms of the conflict between Bork's strong originalism and the view that the U.S. Constitution provides rights to liberty and privacy beyond those explicitly enumerated in its text.[115] Bork's nomination was rejected in the committee by a 5–9 vote[115] and then in the full Senate, 42–58.[116] During Clarence Thomas's nomination hearings in 1991, Biden's questions on constitutional issues were often convoluted to the point that Thomas sometimes lost track of them,[117] and Thomas later wrote that Biden's questions were akin to \"beanballs\".[118] After the committee hearing closed, the public learned that Anita Hill, a University of Oklahoma law school professor, had accused Thomas of making unwelcome sexual comments when they had worked together.[119][120] Biden had known of some of these charges, but initially shared them only with the committee because Hill was then unwilling to testify.[15] The committee hearing was reopened and Hill testified, but Biden did not permit testimony from other witnesses, such as a woman who had made similar charges and experts on harassment.[121] The full Senate confirmed Thomas by a 52–48 vote, with Biden opposed.[15] Liberal legal advocates and women's groups felt strongly that Biden had mishandled the hearings and not done enough to support Hill.[121] In 2019, he told Hill he regretted his treatment of her, but Hill said afterward she remained unsatisfied.[122] Biden was a longtime member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He became its ranking minority member in 1997 and chaired it from June 2001 to 2003 and 2007 to 2009.[123] His positions were generally liberal internationalist.[85][124] He collaborated effectively with Republicans and sometimes went against elements of his own party.[123][124] During this time he met with at least 150 leaders from 60 countries and international organizations, becoming a well-known Democratic voice on foreign policy.[125] Biden voted against authorization for the Gulf War in 1991,[124] siding with 45 of the 55 Democratic senators. He said the U.S. was bearing almost all the burden in the anti-Iraq coalition.[126] Biden became interested in the Yugoslav Wars after hearing about Serbian abuses during the Croatian War of Independence in 1991.[85] Once the Bosnian War broke out, Biden was among the first to call for the \"lift and strike\" policy.[85][123] The George H. W. Bush administration and Clinton administration were both reluctant to implement the policy, fearing Balkan entanglement.[85][124] In April 1993, Biden held a tense three-hour meeting with Serbian leader Slobodan Milošević.[127] Biden worked on several versions of legislative language urging the U.S. toward greater involvement.[127] Biden has called his role in affecting Balkan policy in the mid-1990s his \"proudest moment in public life\" related to foreign policy.[124] In 1999, during the Kosovo War, Biden supported the 1999 NATO bombing of FR Yugoslavia.[85] He and Senator John McCain co-sponsored the McCain-Biden Kosovo Resolution, which called on Clinton to use all necessary force, including ground troops, to confront Milošević over Yugoslav actions toward ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.[124][128] Biden was a strong supporter of the War in Afghanistan, saying, \"Whatever it takes, we should do it.\"[129] As head of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he said in 2002 that Iraqi president Saddam Hussein was a threat to national security and there was no other option than to \"eliminate\" that threat.[130] In October 2002, he voted in favor of the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq, approving the U.S. invasion of Iraq.[124] As chair of the committee, he assembled a series of witnesses to testify in favor of the authorization. They gave testimony grossly misrepresenting the intent, history, and status of Saddam and his secular government, which was an avowed enemy of al-Qaeda, and touted Iraq's fictional possession of weapons of mass destruction.[131] Biden eventually became a critic of the war and called his vote and role a \"mistake\", but did not push for withdrawal.[124][127] He supported the appropriations for the occupation, but argued that the war should be internationalized, that more soldiers were needed, and that the Bush administration should \"level with the American people\" about its cost and length.[123][128] By late 2006, Biden's stance had shifted considerably. He opposed the troop surge of 2007,[124][127] saying General David Petraeus was \"dead, flat wrong\" in believing the surge could work.[132] Biden instead advocated dividing Iraq into a loose federation of three ethnic states.[133] Rather than continue the existing approach or withdrawing, the plan called for \"a third way\": federalizing Iraq and giving Kurds, Shiites, and Sunnis \"breathing room\" in their own regions.[134] In September 2007, a non-binding resolution endorsing the plan passed the Senate,[135] but the idea failed to gain traction.[132] Biden formally declared his candidacy for the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination on June 9, 1987.[136] He was considered a strong candidate because of his moderate image, his speaking ability, his high profile as chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee at the upcoming Robert Bork Supreme Court nomination hearings, and his appeal to Baby Boomers; he would have been the second-youngest person elected president, after John F. Kennedy.[29][137][138] He raised more in the first quarter of 1987 than any other candidate.[137][138] By August his campaign's messaging had become confused due to staff rivalries,[139] and in September, he was accused of plagiarizing a speech by British Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock.[140] Biden's speech had similar lines about being the first person in his family to attend university. Biden had credited Kinnock with the formulation on previous occasions,[141][142] but did not on two occasions in late August.[143]: 230–232 [142] Kinnock himself was more forgiving; the two men met in 1988, forming an enduring friendship.[144] Earlier that year, Biden had also used passages from a 1967 speech by Robert F. Kennedy (for which his aides took blame) and a short phrase from John F. Kennedy's inaugural address; two years earlier he had used a 1976 passage by Hubert Humphrey.[145] Biden responded that politicians often borrow from one another without giving credit, and that one of his rivals for the nomination, Jesse Jackson, had called him to point out that he (Jackson) had used the same material by Humphrey that Biden had used.[15][22] A few days later, an incident was publicized in which, while in law school, Biden had taken text from a Fordham Law Review article with inadequate citations.[22] He was required to repeat the course and passed with high marks.[146] At Biden's request the Delaware Supreme Court's Board of Professional Responsibility reviewed the incident and concluded that he had violated no rules.[147] Biden has made several false or exaggerated claims about his early life: that he had earned three degrees in college, that he attended law school on a full scholarship, that he had graduated in the top half of his class,[148][149] and that he had marched in the civil rights movement.[150] The limited amount of other news about the presidential race amplified these disclosures[151] and on September 23, 1987, Biden withdrew his candidacy, saying it had been overrun by \"the exaggerated shadow\" of his past mistakes.[152] After exploring the possibility of a run in several previous cycles, in January 2007, Biden declared his candidacy in the 2008 elections.[79][153][154] During his campaign, Biden focused on the Iraq War, his record as chairman of major Senate committees, and his foreign-policy experience.[155] Biden was noted for his one-liners during the campaign; in one debate he said of Republican candidate Rudy Giuliani, \"There's only three things he mentions in a sentence: a noun, and a verb and 9/11.\"[156] Biden had difficulty raising funds, struggled to draw people to his rallies, and failed to gain traction against the high-profile candidacies of Obama and Senator Hillary Clinton.[157] He never rose above single digits in national polls of the Democratic candidates. In the first contest on January 3, 2008, Biden placed fifth in the Iowa caucuses, garnering slightly less than one percent of the state delegates.[158] He withdrew from the race that evening.[159] Despite its lack of success, Biden's 2008 campaign raised his stature in the political world.[160]: 336 In particular, it changed the relationship between Biden and Obama. Although they had served together on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, they had not been close: Biden resented Obama's quick rise to political stardom,[132][161] while Obama viewed Biden as garrulous and patronizing.[160]: 28, 337–338 Having gotten to know each other during 2007, Obama appreciated Biden's campaign style and appeal to working-class voters, and Biden said he became convinced Obama was \"the real deal\".[161][160]: 28, 337–338 Shortly after Biden withdrew from the presidential race, Obama privately told him he was interested in finding an important place for Biden in his administration.[162] In early August, Obama and Biden met in secret to discuss the possibility,[162] and developed a strong personal rapport.[161] On August 22, 2008, Obama announced that Biden would be his running mate.[163] The New York Times reported that the strategy behind the choice reflected a desire to fill out the ticket with someone with foreign policy and national security experience.[164] Others pointed out Biden's appeal to middle-class and blue-collar voters.[165][166] Biden was officially nominated for vice president on August 27 by voice vote at the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver.[167] Biden's vice-presidential campaigning gained little media attention, as the press devoted far more coverage to the Republican nominee, Alaska governor Sarah Palin.[168][169] Under instructions from the campaign, Biden kept his speeches succinct and tried to avoid offhand remarks, such as one he made about Obama's being tested by a foreign power soon after taking office, which had attracted negative attention.[170][171] Privately, Biden's remarks frustrated Obama. \"How many times is Biden gonna say something stupid?\", he asked.[160]: 411–414, 419 Obama campaign staffers called Biden's blunders \"Joe bombs\" and kept Biden uninformed about strategy discussions, which in turn irked Biden.[172] Relations between the two campaigns became strained for a month, until Biden apologized on a call to Obama and the two built a stronger partnership.[160]: 411–414 As the 2007–2008 financial crisis reached a peak in September 2008, and the proposed Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 became a major factor in the campaign, Biden voted for the $700 billion Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, which passed in the Senate, 74–25.[173] On October 2, he participated in the vice-presidential debate with Palin at Washington University in St. Louis. Post-debate polls found that while Palin exceeded many voters' expectations, Biden had won the debate overall. [174] On November 4, Obama and Biden were elected with 53% of the popular vote and 365 electoral votes to McCain and Palin's 173.[175][176][177] At the same time Biden was running for vice president, he was also running for reelection to the Senate,[178] as permitted by Delaware law.[79] On November 4, he was reelected to the Senate, defeating Republican Christine O'Donnell.[179] Having won both races, Biden made a point of not resigning from the Senate before he was sworn in for his seventh term in January 2009.[180] He cast his last Senate vote on January 15, supporting the release of the second $350 billion for the Troubled Asset Relief Program,[181] and resigned from the Senate later that day, after which Ted Kaufman took office as his successor.[182][183] In October 2010, Biden said Obama had asked him to remain as his running mate for the 2012 presidential election,[184] but with Obama's popularity on the decline, White House Chief of Staff William M. Daley conducted some secret polling and focus group research in late 2011 on the idea of replacing Biden on the ticket with Hillary Clinton.[185] The notion was dropped when the results showed no appreciable improvement for Obama,[185] and White House officials later said Obama himself had never entertained the idea.[186] Biden's May 2012 statement that he was \"absolutely comfortable\" with same-sex marriage gained considerable public attention in comparison to Obama's position, which had been described as \"evolving\".[187] Biden made his statement without administration consent, and Obama and his aides were quite irked, since Obama had planned to shift position several months later, in the build-up to the party convention.[172][188][189] Gay rights advocates seized upon Biden's statement,[188] and within days, Obama announced that he too supported same-sex marriage, an action in part forced by Biden's remarks.[190] Biden apologized to Obama in private for having spoken out,[191][192] while Obama acknowledged publicly it had been done from the heart.[188] The Obama campaign valued Biden as a retail-level politician, and he had a heavy schedule of appearances in swing states as the reelection campaign began in earnest in spring 2012.[193][194] An August 2012 remark before a mixed-race audience that Republican proposals to relax Wall Street regulations would \"put y'all back in chains\" once again drew attention to Biden's propensity for colorful remarks.[193][195][196] In the first presidential debate of the general election, President Obama's performance was considered surprisingly lackluster.[197] Time magazine's Joe Klein called it \"one of the most inept performances I've ever seen by a sitting president\".[198] Over the next few days, Obama's lead over Romney collapsed,[199] putting pressure on Biden to stop the bleeding with a strong showing against the Republican vice-presidential nominee, Paul Ryan.[200][201] Some political analysts considered Biden's performance against Ryan in the October 11 vice-presidential debate one of the best of his career[202][203] and a key factor in Obama's rebound in the polls and eventual victory over Romney.[204][205] The debate also became memorable for the popularization of Biden's use of the phrase \"a bunch of malarkey\" in response to an attack by Ryan on the administration's response to the September 11, 2012, attacks on the U.S. embassy in Benghazi.[206][207] Biden reused the phrase during his 2020 presidential campaign.[208] On November 6, Obama and Biden won reelection[209] over Romney and Ryan with 332 of 538 Electoral College votes and 51% of the popular vote.[210] Biden said he intended to eliminate some explicit roles assumed by George W. Bush's vice president, Dick Cheney, and did not intend to emulate any previous vice presidency.[211] He was sworn in as the 47th vice president of the United States on January 20, 2009.[212] He was the first vice president from Delaware[213] and the first Roman Catholic vice president.[214][215] Obama was soon comparing Biden to a basketball player \"who does a bunch of things that don't show up in the stat sheet\".[216] Biden visited Kosovo in May and affirmed the U.S. position that its \"independence is irreversible\".[217] Biden lost an internal debate to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton about sending 21,000 new troops to Afghanistan,[218][219] but his skepticism was valued,[220] and in 2009, Biden's views gained more influence as Obama reconsidered his Afghanistan strategy.[221] Biden visited Iraq about every two months,[132] becoming the administration's point man in delivering messages to Iraqi leadership about expected progress there.[220] More generally, overseeing Iraq policy became Biden's responsibility: Obama was said to have said, \"Joe, you do Iraq.\"[222] By 2012, Biden had made eight trips there, but his oversight of U.S. policy in Iraq receded with the exit of U.S. troops in 2011.[194][223] Biden oversaw infrastructure spending from the Obama stimulus package intended to help counteract the ongoing recession.[224] During this period, Biden was satisfied that no major instances of waste or corruption had occurred,[220] and when he completed that role in February 2011, he said the number of fraud incidents with stimulus monies had been less than one percent.[225] Biden's off-message response to a question in late April 2009, during the beginning of the swine flu outbreak, led to a swift retraction by the White House.[226] The remark revived Biden's reputation for gaffes.[227][221][228] Confronted with rising unemployment through July 2009, Biden acknowledged that the administration had \"misread how bad the economy was\", but maintained confidence the stimulus package would create many more jobs once the pace of expenditures picked up.[229] A hot mic picked up Biden telling Obama that his signing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was \"a big fucking deal\" on March 23, 2010. Despite their different personalities, Obama and Biden formed a friendship, partly based around Obama's daughter Sasha and Biden's granddaughter Maisy, who attended Sidwell Friends School together.[172] Members of the Obama administration said Biden's role in the White House was to be a contrarian and force others to defend their positions.[230] Rahm Emanuel, White House chief of staff, said that Biden helped counter groupthink.[216] Obama said, \"The best thing about Joe is that when we get everybody together, he really forces people to think and defend their positions, to look at things from every angle, and that is very valuable for me.\"[220] The Bidens maintained a relaxed atmosphere at their official residence in Washington, often entertaining their grandchildren, and regularly returned to their home in Delaware.[231] Biden campaigned heavily for Democrats in the 2010 midterm elections, maintaining an attitude of optimism in the face of predictions of large-scale losses for the party.[184] Following big Republican gains in the elections and the departure of White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel, Biden's past relationships with Republicans in Congress became more important.[232][233] He led the successful administration effort to gain Senate approval for the New START treaty.[232][233] In December 2010, Biden's advocacy for a middle ground, followed by his negotiations with Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell, were instrumental in producing the administration's compromise tax package that included a temporary extension of the Bush tax cuts.[233][234] The package passed as the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010. Obama delegated Biden to lead negotiations with Congress in March 2011 to resolve federal spending levels for the rest of the year and avoid a government shutdown.[235] The U.S. debt ceiling crisis developed over the next few months, but Biden's relationship with McConnell again proved key in breaking a deadlock and bringing about a deal to resolve it, in the form of the Budget Control Act of 2011, signed on August 2, 2011, the same day an unprecedented U.S. default had loomed.[236][237][238] Some reports suggest that Biden opposed proceeding with the May 2011 U.S. mission to kill Osama bin Laden,[194][239] lest failure adversely affect Obama's reelection prospects.[240][241] Obama named Biden to head the Gun Violence Task Force, created to address the causes of school shootings and consider possible gun control to implement in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, in December 2012.[242] Later that month, during the final days before the United States fell off the \"fiscal cliff\", Biden's relationship with McConnell again proved important as the two negotiated a deal that led to the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 being passed at the start of 2013.[243][244] It made many of the Bush tax cuts permanent but raised rates on upper income levels.[244] Biden was inaugurated to a second term on January 20, 2013, at a small ceremony at Number One Observatory Circle, his official residence, with Justice Sonia Sotomayor presiding (a public ceremony took place on January 21).[245] Biden played little part in discussions that led to the October 2013 passage of the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2014, which resolved the federal government shutdown of 2013 and the debt-ceiling crisis of 2013. This was because Senate majority leader Harry Reid and other Democratic leaders cut him out of any direct talks with Congress, feeling Biden had given too much away during previous negotiations.[246][247][248] Biden's Violence Against Women Act was reauthorized again in 2013. The act led to related developments, such as the White House Council on Women and Girls, begun in the first term, as well as the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault, begun in January 2014 with Biden and Valerie Jarrett as co-chairs.[249][250] He talked about sexual violence while introducing Lady Gaga at the 88th Academy Awards in 2016, receiving a standing ovation from the audience.[251] Biden favored arming Syria's rebel fighters.[252] As the ISIL insurgency in Iraq intensified in 2014, renewed attention was paid to the Biden-Gelb Iraqi federalization plan of 2006, with some observers suggesting Biden had been right all along.[253][254] Biden himself said the U.S. would follow ISIL \"to the gates of hell\".[255] Biden had close relationships with several Latin American leaders and was assigned a focus on the region during the administration; he visited the region 16 times during his vice presidency, the most of any president or vice president.[256] In August 2016, Biden visited Serbia, where he met with the Serbian Prime Minister, Aleksandar Vučić, and expressed his condolences for civilian victims of the bombing campaign during the Kosovo War.[257] Biden never cast a tie-breaking vote in the Senate, making him the longest-serving vice president with this distinction.[258] During his second term, Biden was often said to be preparing for a bid for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination.[259] With his family, many friends, and donors encouraging him in mid-2015 to enter the race, and with Hillary Clinton's favorability ratings in decline at that time, Biden was reported to again be seriously considering the prospect and a \"Draft Biden 2016\" PAC was established.[259][260][261] By late 2015, Biden was still uncertain about running. He felt his son Beau's recent death had largely drained his emotional energy, and said, \"nobody has a right ... to seek that office unless they're willing to give it 110% of who they are.\"[262] On October 21, speaking from a podium in the Rose Garden with his wife and Obama by his side, Biden announced his decision not to run for president in 2016.[263][264][265] After leaving the vice presidency, Biden became an honorary professor at the University of Pennsylvania, developing the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement. Biden remained in that position into 2019, before running for president.[266][267] In 2017, Biden wrote a memoir, Promise Me, Dad, and went on a book tour.[268] By 2019, he and his wife reported that they had earned over $15 million since the end of his vice presidency from speaking engagements and book sales.[269] Biden remained in the public eye, endorsing candidates while continuing to comment on politics, climate change, and the presidency of Donald Trump.[270][271][272] He also continued to speak out in favor of LGBT rights, continuing advocacy on an issue he had become more closely associated with during his vice presidency.[273][274] In 2018, he gave a eulogy for Senator John McCain, praising McCain's embrace of American ideals and bipartisan friendships.[275] Biden continued to support cancer research.[276] Between 2016 and 2019, media outlets often mentioned Biden as a likely candidate for president in 2020.[277] When asked if he would run, he gave varied and ambivalent answers, saying \"never say never\".[278] A political action committee known as Time for Biden was formed in January 2018, seeking Biden's entry into the race.[279] He finally launched his campaign on April 25, 2019,[280] saying he was prompted to run because he was worried by the Trump administration and felt a \"sense of duty\".[281] As the 2020 campaign season heated up, voluminous public polling showed Biden as one of the best-performing Democratic candidates in a head-to-head matchup against President Trump.[282][283][284] With Democrats keenly focused on \"electability\" for defeating Trump,[285] this boosted his popularity among Democratic voters.[286] It also made Biden a frequent target of Trump.[287][288] In September 2019, it was reported that Trump had pressured Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy to investigate alleged wrongdoing by Biden and his son Hunter Biden.[289] Despite the allegations, no evidence was produced of any wrongdoing by the Bidens.[290][291][292] Trump's pressure to investigate the Bidens was perceived by many as an attempt to hurt Biden's chances of winning the presidency.[293] Trump's alleged actions against Biden resulted in a political scandal[294] and Trump's impeachment by the House of Representatives for abuse of power and obstruction of congress.[295] In March 2019 and April 2019, eight women accused Biden of previous instances of inappropriate physical contact, such as embracing, touching or kissing.[296] Biden had previously called himself a \"tactile politician\" and admitted this behavior had caused trouble for him.[297] Journalist Mark Bowden described Biden's lifelong habit of talking close, writing that he \"doesn't just meet you, he engulfs you... scooting closer\" and leaning forward to talk.[298] In April 2019, Biden pledged to be more \"respectful of people's personal space\".[299] Throughout 2019, Biden stayed generally ahead of other Democrats in national polls.[300][301] Despite this, he finished fourth in the Iowa caucuses, and eight days later, fifth in the New Hampshire primary.[302][303] He performed better in the Nevada caucuses, reaching the 15% required for delegates, but still finished 21.6 percentage points behind Bernie Sanders.[304] Making strong appeals to Black voters on the campaign trail and in the South Carolina debate, Biden won the South Carolina primary by more than 28 points.[305] After the withdrawals and subsequent endorsements of candidates Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar, he made large gains in the March 3 Super Tuesday primary elections. Biden won 18 of the next 26 contests, putting him in the lead overall.[306] Elizabeth Warren and Mike Bloomberg soon dropped out, and Biden expanded his lead with victories over Sanders in four states on March 10.[307] In late March 2020, Tara Reade, one of the eight women who in 2019 had accused Biden of inappropriate physical contact, accused Biden of having sexually assaulted her in 1993.[308] There were inconsistencies between Reade's 2019 and 2020 allegations.[308][309] Biden and his campaign denied the sexual assault allegation.[310][311] When Sanders suspended his campaign on April 8, 2020, Biden became the Democratic Party's presumptive nominee for president.[312] On April 13, Sanders endorsed Biden in a live-streamed discussion from their homes.[313] Former president Barack Obama endorsed Biden the next day.[314] On August 11, Biden announced U.S. senator Kamala Harris of California as his running mate, making her the first African American and first South Asian American vice-presidential nominee on a major-party ticket.[315] On August 18, 2020, Biden was officially nominated at the 2020 Democratic National Convention as the Democratic Party nominee for president in the 2020 election.[316][317] Biden was elected the 46th president of the United States in November 2020. He defeated the incumbent, Donald Trump, becoming the first candidate to defeat a sitting president since Bill Clinton defeated George H. W. Bush in 1992. Trump refused to concede, insisting the election had been \"stolen\" from him through \"voter fraud\", challenging the results in court and promoting numerous conspiracy theories about the voting and vote-counting processes, in an attempt to overturn the election results.[318] Biden's transition was delayed by several weeks as the White House ordered federal agencies not to cooperate.[319] On November 23, General Services Administrator Emily W. Murphy formally recognized Biden as the apparent winner of the 2020 election and authorized the start of a transition process to the Biden administration.[320] On January 6, 2021, during Congress's electoral vote count, Trump told supporters gathered in front of the White House to march to the Capitol and refused to concede the election.[321] Soon after, some of his supporters attacked the Capitol. During the attack, Biden addressed the nation, calling the events \"an unprecedented assault unlike anything we've seen in modern times\".[322][323] After the Capitol was cleared, Congress resumed its joint session and officially certified the election results with Vice President Mike Pence, in his capacity as President of the Senate, declaring Biden and Harris the winners.[324] Biden was inaugurated as the 46th president of the United States on January 20, 2021.[325][326] At 78, he was the oldest person to have assumed the office.[325][327] He is the second Catholic president (after John F. Kennedy)[328][329] and the first president whose home state is Delaware.[330] He is also the first man since George H. W. Bush to have been both vice president and president, and the second non-incumbent vice president (after Richard Nixon in 1968) to be elected president.[331] He is also the first president from the Silent Generation.[332][333] Biden's inauguration was \"a muted affair unlike any previous inauguration\" due to COVID-19 precautions as well as massively increased security measures because of the January 6 United States Capitol attack. Trump did not attend, becoming the first outgoing president since 1869 to not attend his successor's inauguration.[334] In his first two days as president, Biden signed 17 executive orders. By his third day, orders had included rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement, ending the state of national emergency at the border with Mexico, directing the government to rejoin the World Health Organization, face mask requirements on federal property, measures to combat hunger in the United States,[335][336][337][338] and revoking permits for the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline.[339][340][341] On March 11, the first anniversary of COVID-19 having been declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization, Biden signed into law the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, a $1.9 trillion economic stimulus and relief package that he had proposed to support the United States' recovery from the economic and health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.[342] The package included direct payments to most Americans, an extension of increased unemployment benefits, funds for vaccine distribution and school reopenings, and expansions of health insurance subsidies and the child tax credit. Biden's initial proposal included an increase of the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour, but after the Senate parliamentarian determined that including the increase in a budget reconciliation bill would violate Senate rules, Democrats declined to pursue overruling her and removed the increase from the package.[343][344][345] Also in March, amid a rise in migrants entering the U.S. from Mexico, Biden told migrants, \"Don't come over.\" In the meantime, migrant adults \"are being sent back\", Biden said, in reference to the continuation of the Trump administration's Title 42 policy for quick deportations.[346] Biden earlier announced that his administration would not deport unaccompanied migrant children; the rise in arrivals of such children exceeded the capacity of facilities meant to shelter them (before they were sent to sponsors), leading the Biden administration in March to direct the Federal Emergency Management Agency to help.[347] On April 14, Biden announced that the United States would delay the withdrawal of all troops from the war in Afghanistan until September 11, signaling an end to the country's direct military involvement in Afghanistan after nearly 20 years.[348] In February 2020, the Trump administration had made a deal with the Taliban to completely withdraw U.S. forces by May 1, 2021.[349] Biden's decision met with a wide range of reactions, from support and relief to trepidation at the possible collapse of the Afghan government without American support.[350] On April 22–23, Biden held an international climate summit at which he announced that the U.S. would cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 50%–52% by 2030 compared to 2005 levels. Other countries also increased their pledges.[351][352] On April 28, the eve of his 100th day in office, Biden delivered his first address to a joint session of Congress.[353] On June 17, Biden signed the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act, which officially declared Juneteenth a federal holiday.[354] Juneteenth is the first new federal holiday since 1983.[355][356][357] In July 2021, amid a slowing of the COVID-19 vaccination rate in the country and the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant, Biden said that the country has \"a pandemic for those who haven't gotten the vaccination\" and that it was therefore \"gigantically important\" for Americans to be vaccinated.[358] In 2022, Biden endorsed a change to the Senate filibuster to allow for the passing of the Freedom to Vote Act and John Lewis Voting Rights Act, on both of which the Senate had failed to invoke cloture.[359] The rules change failed when two Democratic senators, Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, joined Senate Republicans in opposing it.[360] In April 2022, Biden signed into law the bipartisan Postal Service Reform Act of 2022 to revamp the finances and operations of the United States Postal Service agency.[361] In the summer of 2022, several other pieces of legislation Biden supported passed Congress. The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act aimed to address gun reform issues following the Robb Elementary School shooting in Uvalde, Texas.[362] The act's gun control provisions include extended background checks for gun purchasers under 21, clarification of Federal Firearms License requirements, funding for state red flag laws and other crisis intervention programs, further criminalization of arms trafficking and straw purchases, and partial closure of the boyfriend loophole.[363][364][365] Biden signed the bill on June 25, 2022.[366] The Honoring our PACT Act of 2022 was introduced in 2021 and signed into law by Biden on August 10, 2022.[367] The act intends to significantly improve healthcare access and funding for veterans who were exposed to toxic substances, including burn pits, during military service.[368] In 2022, Biden signed the Respect for Marriage Act, which repealed the Defense of Marriage Act and requires the federal government to recognize the validity of same-sex and interracial marriages.[369] In June 2024, Biden issued an executive action offering amnesty to unauthorized immigrants married to American citizens. The program included a pathway to U.S. residency and citizenship and was expected to initially affect about 500,000 people. It was later struck down due to a lack of legislation empowering the president to enact the program.[370][371] Biden entered office nine months into a recovery from the COVID-19 recession and his first year in office was characterized by robust growth in real GDP, employment, wages, and stock market returns, amid significantly elevated inflation. Real GDP grew 5.9%, the fastest rate in 37 years.[372][373] Amid record job creation, the unemployment rate fell at the fastest pace on record during the year.[374][375][376] By the end of 2021, inflation reached a nearly 40-year high of 7.1%, which was partially offset by the highest nominal wage and salary growth in at least 20 years.[377][378][379][380] In his third month in office, Biden signed an executive order to increase the minimum wage for federal contractors to $15 per hour, an increase of nearly 37%. The order went into effect for 390,000 workers in January 2022.[381][382] Amid a surge in inflation and high gas prices, Biden's approval ratings declined, with his disapproval rating surpassing his approval rating in early 2022.[384][385][386] After 5.9% growth in 2021, real GDP growth cooled in 2022 to 2.1%, after slightly negative growth in the first half spurred recession concerns. Job creation and consumer spending remained strong through the year, as the unemployment rate fell to match a 53-year low of 3.5% in December. Inflation peaked at 9.1% in June before easing to 3.2% by October 2023. Stocks had had their worst year since 2008[387][388][389] before recovering. Widespread predictions of an imminent recession did not materialize in 2022 or 2023, and by late 2023 indicators showed sharply lower inflation with economic acceleration. GDP growth hit 4.9% in the third quarter of 2023 and the year ended with stocks near record highs, with robust holiday spending.[390][391][392] Biden signed numerous major pieces of economic legislation in the 117th Congress, including the American Rescue Plan, Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, CHIPS and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act.[393] He signed the CHIPS and Science Act into law on August 9, 2022.[394] It provided billions of dollars in new funding to boost domestic research on and manufacture of semiconductors, to compete economically with China.[395] In 2022, Biden blocked a national railroad strike planned by multiple labor unions.[396] During the United Auto Workers strike, he expressed support for the workers in negotiations.[397] Biden joined striking UAW workers' picket line in Michigan, becoming the first president to join a picket line.[398] He refused to block a port strike from the International Longshoremen's Association in October 2024.[399] Over the course of five days in March 2023, three small- to mid-size U.S. banks failed, triggering a sharp decline in global bank stock prices and swift response by regulators to prevent potential global contagion. After Silicon Valley Bank collapsed, the first to do so, Biden expressed opposition to a bailout by taxpayers.[400] He claimed that the partial rollback of Dodd-Frank regulations contributed to the bank's failure.[401] At the beginning of the 118th Congress, Biden and congressional Republicans engaged in a standoff after the U.S. hit its debt limit, which raised the risk that the U.S. would default on its debt.[402] Biden and House speaker Kevin McCarthy struck a deal to raise the debt limit, the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, which suspended the debt limit until January 2025. Biden signed it on June 3, averting a default.[403] The deal was generally seen as favorable to Biden.[404][405] Biden extended the COVID-19 student loan pause through September 2023, with an \"on ramp\" period that extended some of the pause's protections against credit reporting, collection efforts, and late payment fees through September 30, 2024.[406] The Biden administration's attempts to implement student loan forgiveness and relief programs have faced legal challenges from a coalition of Republican-led states.[407] By the end of 2021, 40 of Biden's nominees to the federal judiciary had been confirmed, more than any president in his first year in office since Ronald Reagan.[408] Biden has prioritized diversity in his judicial appointments more than any president in U.S. history, with most of his appointees being women and people of color.[409] In January 2022, Supreme Court justice Stephen Breyer, a moderate liberal nominated by Bill Clinton, announced his intention to retire from the Supreme Court. During his 2020 campaign, Biden vowed to nominate the first Black woman to the Supreme Court if a vacancy occurred,[410] a promise he reiterated after Breyer announced his retirement.[411] On February 25, Biden nominated federal judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court.[412] She was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on April 7[413] and sworn in on June 30.[414] By May 2024, Biden had confirmed more than 200 federal judges, about two-thirds of them women.[415] In July 2024, during a speech at the LBJ Presidential Library, Biden expressed interest in judicial term limits and a binding ethics code for Supreme Court justices.[416] As part of Biden's Build Back Better agenda, in late March 2021, he proposed the American Jobs Plan, a $2 trillion package addressing issues including transport infrastructure, utilities infrastructure, broadband infrastructure, housing, schools, manufacturing, research and workforce development.[417][418] After months of negotiations among Biden and lawmakers, in August 2021 the Senate passed a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill called the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act,[419][420] while the House, also in a bipartisan manner, approved that bill in early November 2021, covering infrastructure related to transport, utilities, and broadband.[421] Biden signed the bill into law in mid-November 2021.[422] The other core part of the Build Back Better agenda was the Build Back Better Act, a $3.5 trillion social spending bill that expands the social safety net and includes major provisions on climate change.[423][424] The bill did not have Republican support, so Democrats attempted to pass it on a party-line vote through budget reconciliation, but struggled to win the support of Senator Joe Manchin, even as the price was lowered to $2.2 trillion.[425] After Manchin rejected the bill,[426] the Build Back Better Act's size was reduced. It was comprehensively reworked into the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, covering deficit reduction, climate change, healthcare, and tax reform.[427] The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was introduced by senators Chuck Schumer and Joe Manchin.[428][429] The package aimed to raise $739 billion and authorize $370 billion in spending on energy and climate change, $300 billion in deficit reduction, three years of Affordable Care Act subsidies, prescription drug reform to lower prices, and tax reform.[430] According to an analysis by the Rhodium Group, the bill will lower U.S. greenhouse gas emissions between 31 percent and 44 percent below 2005 levels by 2030.[431] On August 7, 2022, the Senate passed the bill (as amended) on a 51–50 vote, with all Democrats voting in favor, all Republicans opposed, and Vice President Kamala Harris breaking the tie. The bill was passed by the House on August 12[431] and was signed by Biden on August 16.[432][433] Before and during the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26), Biden promoted an agreement that the U.S. and the European Union cut methane emissions by a third by 2030 and tried to add dozens of other countries to the effort.[434] Biden pledged to double climate funding to developing countries by 2024.[435] Also at COP26, the U.S. and China reached a deal on greenhouse gas emission reduction. The two countries are responsible for 40 percent of global emissions.[436] In July 2023, when the 2023 heat waves hit the U.S., Biden announced several measures to protect the population and said the heat waves were linked to climate change.[437][438] In April 2024, Biden unveiled a plan to protect and restore natural water sources (3.2 million hectares of wetlands and 161,000 km of rivers and streams).[439] Illegal border crossings at the Mexico–United States border began to surge in 2021 when Biden assumed office,[440][441][442][443] following a pandemic-era lull, amid a global rise in migration. From 2021 to 2023, they increased to record highs, reaching an all-time monthly high in December 2023.[444][445] Throughout 2024, crossings began to significantly decline from the December record, after Biden implemented restrictions on asylum claims from migrants who cross the border between ports of entry and urged Mexico to crack down on migrants.[446][447][448] The United States also increased its deportations in the last year of Biden's presidency. Deportations from October 2023 to September 2024 reached the highest level since 2014.[449] Biden used humanitarian parole to an unprecedented degree to mitigate illegal border crossings, allowing migrants to fly into the U.S. or schedule their entries through official entry points in the U.S.-Mexico border. Over a million migrants had been admitted to the U.S. under humanitarian parole as of January 2024.[450][451][452] In January 2024, Biden expressed support for a proposed bipartisan immigration deal led by Senators Kyrsten Sinema and James Lankford.[453][454] The proposed bill would allow DHS to close the border when encounters reach a seven-day average of 5,000 or exceed 8,500 in a single day.[455][456] In addition, the bill mandates the detention of migrants seeking asylum and undergoing asylum interviews, with those failing the process repatriated to their home countries.[457] While not addressing the status of \"Dreamers\", it would change immigration law to allow the children of those with H-1B visas to get work authorizations and freeze their legal ages while waiting for green cards, rather than face deportation once they hit age 21, and would provide additional funding for immigration judges.[458] In late January, former president Donald Trump announced his opposition to the legislation, calling on Congressional Republicans to oppose it; subsequently, leaders such as Speaker of the House Mike Johnson announced their opposition, halting further legislative action.[459][460] As a result of continued high immigration levels throughout his tenure, some lawmakers and pundits have criticized Biden's handling of the southern border.[461][462][463] Criticism of the bill and broader immigration policy continued to be expressed by both sides, with some liberals considering his policies too harsh while some conservatives considered them too lax.[464][465] In the final year of his presidency, the Biden administration worked to extend at least 14 contracts with private prison companies to run immigrant detention centers, despite his 2020 campaign promise to end the practice.[466] On October 6, 2022, Biden pardoned all Americans convicted of \"small\" amounts of cannabis possession under federal law.[467] On December 22, 2023, he pardoned Americans for cannabis use or possession on federal lands regardless of whether they had been charged or prosecuted.[468][469] On December 12, 2024, in the largest single-day clemency act in history, Biden granted clemency to about 1,500 nonviolent felons in home confinement who had previously been released from prison.[470][471] The act generated controversy, as it included felons such as Michael Conahan, a judge involved in the kids for cash kickback scandal, and Rita Crundwell, a comptroller responsible for the single largest municipal fraud in U.S. history. The Biden administration said the offenders who received clemency \"deserve a second chance\" and were selected based on meeting certain criteria in a uniform decision.[472][473] On December 1, 2024, Biden issued a \"full and unconditional\" pardon to Hunter Biden that covered all federal offenses Hunter committed or may have committed between January 1, 2014, and December 1, 2024. The pardon's sweeping extent was \"unprecedented\",[474] with legal experts citing Richard Nixon as the only other person given similar terms for a pardon, for his tenure as president from 1969 to 1974.[475][476][477][64] According to Reason magazine, Hunter Biden's pardon was even more far-reaching than Nixon's or other \"controversial\"[474] pardons: The Hunter pardon is far more comprehensive...in that it covered not just his convictions for drug-related activities and tax fraud, but any other criminal behavior since 2014—the year that Hunter joined the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma. It has been alleged that Hunter's job was essentially to trade on the family name and sell his access to dad. This may not have been illegal, but it does mean that the pardon is clearly designed to offer preemptive protection not just to Hunter, but to Joe Biden himself. These features make the pardon unprecedented, though perfectly in line with the president's executive powers. Hunter had been convicted on charges related to tax and gun offenses, after which Joe made numerous promises not to pardon him. He and his staff continued to say that Hunter would not be pardoned as late as November, although internal staff discussions affirmed that the option remained on the table even as Biden said otherwise.[478][479][64] Biden and his family finalized the decision to pardon Hunter without consulting senior staff.[480] In a statement announcing the pardon, Biden said he believed his son was \"selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted\", blaming \"political pressure\" for the collapse of a plea bargain. The plea bargain actually fell apart after the presiding judge asked about its unusual construction.[67][481][482] Biden's pardon came amid incoming December sentencing dates for Hunter for his convictions and concerns about the succeeding Trump administration potentially targeting political rivals for prosecution.[480] No future president can rescind the pardon.[483] Biden also said, \"I hope Americans will understand why a father and a president would come to this decision.\"[483] Critics called out the pardon for seeming self-serving and corrupt.[484][485] On September 2, 2022, in a nationally broadcast Philadelphia speech, Biden called for a \"battle for the soul of the nation\". Off camera, he called Trump supporters \"semi-fascists\", which Republican commentators denounced.[486][487][488] A predicted Republican wave election did not materialize and the race for U.S. Congress control was much closer than expected, with Republicans securing a slim majority of 222 seats in the House of Representatives,[489][490][491][492] and the Democratic caucus keeping control of the U.S. Senate, with 51 seats, a gain of one seat from the last Congress.[493][b] It was the first midterm election since 1986 in which the party of the incumbent president achieved a net gain in governorships, and the first since 1934 in which the president's party lost no state legislative chambers.[497] Democrats credited Biden for their unexpectedly favorable performance,[498] and he celebrated the results as a strong day for democracy.[499] In June 2021, Biden took his first trip abroad as president. In eight days he visited Belgium, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. He attended a G7 summit, a NATO summit, and an EU summit, and held one-on-one talks with Russian president Vladimir Putin.[500] In September 2021, Biden announced AUKUS, a security pact between Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States, to ensure \"peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific over the long term\"; the deal included nuclear-powered submarines built for Australia's use, undercutting a prior Australian contract for submarines with France.[501] In February 2021, the Biden administration announced that the United States was ending its support for the Saudi-led bombing campaign in Yemen and revoked the designation of Yemen's Houthis as terrorists.[502][503] In early February 2022, Biden ordered the counterterrorism raid in northern Syria that resulted in the death of Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurashi, the second leader of the Islamic State.[504] In late July, Biden approved the drone strike that killed Ayman al-Zawahiri, the second leader of Al-Qaeda, and an integral member in the planning of the September 11 attacks.[505] The 2022 OPEC+ oil production cut caused a diplomatic spat with Saudi Arabia, widening the rift between the two countries, and threatening a longstanding alliance.[506][507] In August 2024, Biden negotiated and oversaw the 2024 Ankara prisoner exchange, the largest prisoner exchange since the end of the Cold War. It involved the release of 26 people, including American journalist Evan Gershkovich and former United States Marine Paul Whelan. In November 2024, the Biden administration announced that it had helped broker a ceasefire agreement in the Israel–Hezbollah conflict. American forces began withdrawing from Afghanistan in 2020, under the provisions of a February 2020 US-Taliban agreement that set a May 1, 2021, deadline.[508] The Taliban began an offensive on May 1.[509][510] By early July, most American troops in Afghanistan had withdrawn.[349] Biden addressed the withdrawal in July, saying, \"The likelihood there's going to be the Taliban overrunning everything and owning the whole country is highly unlikely.\"[349] On August 15, the Afghan government collapsed under the Taliban offensive, and Afghan President Ashraf Ghani fled the country.[349][511] Biden reacted by ordering 6,000 American troops to assist with evacuating American personnel and Afghan allies.[512] He faced bipartisan criticism for the manner of the withdrawal,[513] with the evacuations described as chaotic and botched.[514][515][516] On August 16, Biden addressed the \"messy\" situation, taking responsibility for it, and admitting that the situation \"unfolded more quickly than we had anticipated\".[511][517] He defended his decision to withdraw, saying that Americans should not be \"dying in a war that Afghan forces are not willing to fight for themselves\".[517][518] On August 26, a suicide bombing at the Kabul airport killed 13 U.S. service members and 169 Afghans. On August 27, an American drone strike killed two ISIS-K targets, who were \"planners and facilitators\", according to a U.S. Army general.[519] On August 29, another American drone strike killed ten civilians, including seven children. The Defense Department initially claimed the strike was conducted on an Islamic State suicide bomber threatening Kabul Airport, but admitted the suspect was harmless on September 17, calling its killing of civilians \"a tragic mistake\".[520] The U.S. military completed withdrawal from Afghanistan on August 30. Biden called the extraction of over 120,000 Americans, Afghans and other allies \"an extraordinary success\".[521] He acknowledged that up to 200 Americans who wanted to leave did not, despite his August 18 pledge to keep troops in Afghanistan until all Americans who wanted to leave had left.[522] After the withdrawal, the U.S. continued to send aid to Afghanistan, remaining the country's biggest aid donor as of August 2024 and spending at least $20.7 billion post-withdrawal. U.S. funding has helped support the Taliban government and stabilize Afghanistan's economy.[523][524] In February 2022, the Russian Armed Forces under President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. After warning for several weeks that an attack was imminent, Biden responded to the invasion by imposing severe sanctions on Russia and authorizing over $8 billion in weapons shipments to Ukraine.[525][526][527] On April 29, he asked Congress for $33 billion for Ukraine,[528][529] but lawmakers later increased it to about $40 billion.[530][531][532] Biden blamed Putin for the emerging energy and food crises.[533][534][535] On February 20, 2023, four days before the anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Biden visited Kyiv and met with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.[536] While there, he promised more military aid to Ukraine and denounced the war.[537][538][539] In 2022, Congress approved about $113 billion in aid to Ukraine.[540] In October 2023, the Biden administration requested an additional $61.4 billion in aid for Ukraine for the year ahead,[541] but delays in the passage of further aid by the House of Representatives inhibited progress, with the additional $61 billion in aid to Ukraine added in April 2024.[542][543][544] Throughout the conflict, Biden has consistently refused Ukrainian requests to allow them to utilize weapons against Russian military targets inside Russia. An exception was granted in May 2024 for targets in the vicinity of Kharkiv for \"counter-fire\" purposes.[545][546][547][548] The Solomon Islands-China security pact caused alarm in late 2022, as China could build military bases across the South Pacific. Biden sought to strengthen ties with Australia and New Zealand in the wake of the deal, as Anthony Albanese succeeded to the premiership of Australia and Jacinda Ardern's government took a firmer line on Chinese influence.[549][550][551] In a September 2022 interview with 60 Minutes, Biden said that U.S. forces would defend Taiwan in the event of \"an unprecedented attack\" by the Chinese,[552] which is in contrast to the long-standing U.S. policy of \"strategic ambiguity\" toward China and Taiwan.[553][554][555] The September comments came after three previous comments by Biden that the U.S. would defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion.[556] Amid increasing tension with China, Biden's administration has repeatedly walked back his statements and asserted that U.S. policy toward Taiwan has not changed.[556][557][553] In late 2022, Biden issued several executive orders and federal rules designed to slow Chinese technological growth, and maintain U.S. leadership over computing, biotech, and clean energy.[558] On February 4, 2023, Biden ordered the United States Air Force to shoot down a suspected Chinese surveillance balloon off the coast of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.[559][560] The State Department said the balloon carried antennas and other equipment capable of geolocating communications signals, and similar balloons from China have flown over more than 40 nations.[561] The Chinese government denied that the balloon was a surveillance device, instead claiming it was a civilian (mainly meteorological) airship that had blown off course.[562][563] Secretary of State Antony Blinken postponed his planned visit to China as the incident further damaged U.S.-China relations.[564][565][566] In May 2024, the Biden administration doubled tariffs on solar cells imported from China and more than tripled tariffs on lithium-ion electric vehicle batteries imported from China.[567] It also raised tariffs on imports of Chinese steel, aluminum, and medical materials.[567] In October 2023, Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel that devolved into an intensified conflict, jeopardizing the administration's push to normalize relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia.[568] Biden stated his unequivocal support for Israel and condemned the attack by Hamas.[569] He deployed aircraft carriers in the region to deter others from joining the war,[570] and called for an additional $14 billion in military aid to Israel.[571] He later began pressuring Israel to address the growing humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip.[572] Biden rejected calls for a ceasefire but said he supported \"humanitarian pauses\" to deliver aid to the people of the Gaza Strip.[573] He asked Israel to pause its invasion of Gaza for at least three days to allow for hostage negotiations; Israel agreed to daily four-hour pauses.[574] He also directed the U.S. military to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Gaza.[575] Biden has said he is a Zionist.[576][577] He has faced criticism for his unwavering support for Israel. Officials have urged him to take a harder stance against Israel, criticizing his administration's leniency and support despite the Israeli government's contentious offensive, which has led to significant civilian casualties and humanitarian crises.[578][579][580] Following the killing of Palestinian civilians receiving food aid on February 29, 2024, Biden said the current level of aid flowing into Gaza was insufficient.[581] On March 3, the U.S. military began airdropping food aid into Gaza.[582] Several experts called the U.S. airdrops performative and said they would do little to alleviate the famine in Gaza.[583] As of May 2024, Biden has continued to support Israel during the course of the war despite significant domestic opposition to American involvement in it and subsequent widespread protests. A March 2024 Gallup poll found that a strong majority of Americans disapproved of Israeli conduct during the war.[584] It found that 36% approved \"of the military action Israel has taken in Gaza\" and 55% disapproved.[584] Young Americans have been significantly less supportive of Israel than older generations.[585][586] Beginning in April 2024, widespread Israel–Hamas war protests emerged on university campuses, denouncing Biden.[587] On May 31, 2024, Biden announced his support for an Israeli ceasefire proposal, saying that Hamas was \"no longer capable\" of another large-scale attack.[588][589][590] The proposal, which would establish a permanent ceasefire, release all hostages, and reconstruct the Gaza Strip, was supported by Hamas officials after mediation by Egypt and Qatar.[591][592] The Netanyahu administration responded that Israel's goals regarding \"the destruction of Hamas military and governing capabilities\" had not changed and that conditions would need to be met before it would agree to a ceasefire.[593][594][595] In the first year of the war, it was estimated that the Biden administration had sent Israel at least $17.9 billion in military aid, a record.[596] In about the same period, it sent Palestinians $1.2 billion in humanitarian aid.[597] Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Biden expressed support for expanding NATO to cover Sweden and Finland.[598][599] On August 9, 2022, he signed the instruments of ratification stipulating U.S. support for the two countries' entry into NATO.[600][601] Finnish ascension occurred on April 4, 2023, but opposition by Turkey and Hungary to Swedish entry led to a stalemate.[602] Biden led diplomatic talks resulting in formal Swedish ascension into NATO on March 7, 2024.[603][604] He has also expressed openness to Ukrainian entry into NATO following the end of the conflict,[605] supporting an expedited timetable in its ascension and the removal of steps such as the Membership Action Plan typically required for NATO entry.[606][607] On November 2, 2022, while packing files at the Penn Biden Center, Biden's attorneys found classified documents dating from his vice presidency in a \"locked closet\".[608][609] According to the White House, the documents were reported that day to the U.S. National Archives, which recovered them the next day.[609] On November 14, Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed U.S. attorney John R. Lausch Jr. to conduct an investigation.[610][611] On December 20, a second batch of classified documents was discovered in the garage of Biden's Wilmington, Delaware residence.[612] The findings broke news on January 9, 2023, after CBS News published an article on the Lausch investigation.[609][613][614] On January 12, Garland appointed Robert K. Hur as special counsel to investigate \"possible unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents or other records\".[615] On January 20, after a 13-hour consensual search by FBI investigators, six more items with classified markings were recovered from Biden's Wilmington residence.[616] FBI agents searched Biden's home in Rehoboth Beach on February 1 and collected papers and notes from his time as vice president, but did not find any classified information.[617] On February 8, 2024, Hur concluded the special counsel investigation and announced that no charges would be brought against Biden.[618] On January 11, 2023, the House of Representatives launched an investigative committee into the foreign business activities of Biden's son, Hunter, and brother, James.[619] The committee's chair, Representative James Comer, simultaneously investigated alleged corruption related to the Hunter Biden laptop controversy.[620] On September 12, House speaker Kevin McCarthy initiated a formal impeachment inquiry against Biden, saying that the recent House investigations \"paint a picture of corruption\" by Biden and his family.[621][622][623][624] Congressional investigations, most notably by the House Oversight committee, have discovered no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden as of December 2023.[625][626][627][628] On December 13, 2023, the House of Representatives voted 221–212 to formalize an impeachment inquiry into Biden.[629][630][631] In February 2024, Alexander Smirnov, a former intelligence informant who was prominent in the bribery allegations against Biden, was charged with making false statements to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).[632] Smirnov admitted he had publicized a false story given to him by Russian intelligence officials with the goal of damaging Biden's reelection campaign.[633][634][635] Ending months of speculation,[636][637] on April 25, 2023, Biden confirmed he would run for reelection as president in the 2024 election, with Harris again as his running mate. The campaign launched four years to the day after the start of his 2020 presidential campaign.[638] On the day of his announcement, a Gallup poll found that Biden's approval rating was 37 percent, with most of those surveyed saying the economy was their biggest concern.[639] During his campaign, Biden promoted higher economic growth and recovery following the COVID-19 pandemic.[640][641] He frequently stated his intention to \"finish the job\" as a political rallying cry.[638][642][643] U.S. Representative Dean Phillips ran against Biden in the 2024 Democratic presidential primaries.[644] Biden was not on the ballot in the January 23 New Hampshire primary, but won it in a write-in campaign with 63.8% of the vote to Phillips's 19.6%.[645] He had wanted South Carolina to be the first primary, and won that state on February 3 with 96.2% of the vote.[646] Biden received 89.3% of the vote in Nevada and 81.1% of the vote in Michigan, with \"none of these candidates\" and \"uncommitted\" coming in second in each state, respectively. On March 5 (\"Super Tuesday\"), he won 15 of 16 primaries, netting 80% or more of the vote in 13 of them.[647][648] On March 6, Phillips suspended his campaign and endorsed Biden.[649] On March 12, Biden reached more than the 1,968 delegates needed to win the Democratic nomination, becoming the presumptive nominee.[650][651] The first presidential debate was held on June 27, 2024, between Biden and Trump. Biden's performance was widely criticized, with commentators saying he frequently lost his train of thought and gave meandering answers.[652][653][654] Several newspaper columnists declared Trump the winner,[655][656][657][658] and polling indicated the majority of debate watchers believed Trump won.[659] After the debate raised questions about his health and age, Biden faced calls to withdraw from the race, including from fellow Democrats[660] and the editorial boards of several major news outlets.[661][662] Biden initially insisted that he would remain a candidate,[663] but on July 21, he withdrew his candidacy, writing that this was \"in the best interest of my party and the country\".[664][665] He endorsed Harris as his successor.[666][667] His announcement came 29 days before the beginning of the 2024 Democratic National Convention.[668][669] On August 6, 2024, Harris was confirmed as the Democratic presidential nominee after securing 99% of the delegates in a virtual roll call vote.[670] This was the first time an eligible incumbent had declined to run for reelection since Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968.[671] In the general election, Trump defeated Harris, flipping six states Biden had won in 2020. The Senate went Republican for the first time since 2018. In a nationally televised speech after the election, Biden congratulated Trump and promised a \"peaceful and orderly\" transition of power.[672] As a senator, Biden was regarded as a moderate Democrat.[673] As a presidential nominee, Biden's platform had been called the most progressive of any major party platform in history, although not within his party's ideological vanguard.[674] Biden says his positions are deeply influenced by Catholic social teaching.[675][676][677] According to political scientist Carlo Invernizzi Accetti, \"it has become second nature to describe his politics with such ready-made labels as centrist or moderate.\"[678] Accetti says that Biden represents an Americanized form of Christian democracy, taking positions characteristic of both the center-right and center-left.[678] Biden has cited the Catholic philosopher Jacques Maritain, credited with starting the Christian democratic movement, as immensely influential in his thinking.[679] Other analysts have likened his ideology to traditional liberalism, \"a doctrine of liberty, equality, justice and individual rights that relies, in the modern age, on a strong federal government for enforcement\".[680][681] Such analysts distinguish liberals, who believe in a regulated market economy, from the left, who believe in greater economic intervention or a planned economy.[680][681] In 2022, journalist Sasha Issenberg wrote that Biden's \"most valuable political skill\" was \"an innate compass for the ever-shifting mainstream of the Democratic Party\".[682] Biden has proposed partially reversing the corporate tax cuts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, saying that doing so would not hurt businesses' ability to hire.[683][684] He supported raising the corporate tax only up to 28% from the 21% established in the 2017 bill, not back to 35%, the corporate tax rate until 2017.[685] He voted for the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).[686] as well as the Trans-Pacific Partnership.[687] Biden is a staunch supporter of the Affordable Care Act (ACA).[688][689] He has promoted a plan to expand and build upon it, paid for by revenue gained from reversing some Trump administration tax cuts.[688] Biden's plan aims to expand health insurance coverage to 97% of Americans, including by creating a public health insurance option.[690] Biden did not support national same-sex marriage rights while in the Senate and voted for the Defense of Marriage Act,[691] but opposed proposals for constitutional amendments that would have banned same-sex marriage nationwide.[692] Biden has supported same-sex marriage since 2012.[103][693] As a senator, Biden forged deep relationships with police groups and was a chief proponent of a Police Officer's Bill of Rights measure that police unions supported but police chiefs opposed.[694][695] In 2020, Biden also ran on decriminalizing cannabis,[696] after advocating harsher penalties for drug use as a U.S. senator.[697][698] Biden believes action must be taken on climate change. As a senator, he co-sponsored the Boxer–Sanders Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act, the most stringent climate bill in the United States Senate.[699] Biden supports nature conservation. According to a report from the Center for American Progress, he broke several records in this domain.[700] He took steps to protect old-growth forests.[701] Biden opposes drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.[702] He wants to achieve a carbon-free power sector in the U.S. by 2035 and stop emissions completely by 2050.[703] His program includes reentering the Paris Agreement, green building and more.[704] Biden supports environmental justice, including climate justice and ocean justice.[705][706] A major step is increasing energy efficiency, water efficiency and resilience to climate disasters in low-income houses for mitigate climate change, reduce costs, improve health and safety.[707][708] Biden has called global temperature rise above the 1.5 degree limit the \"only existential threat humanity faces even more frightening than a nuclear war\".[709] Despite his clean energy policies and congressional Republicans characterizing them as a \"War on American Energy\", domestic oil production reached a record high in October 2023.[710] Biden has said the U.S. needs to \"get tough\" on China, calling it the \"most serious competitor\" that poses challenges to the United States' \"prosperity, security, and democratic values\".[711][712] Biden has spoken about human rights abuses in the Xinjiang region to the Chinese Communist Party leader Xi Jinping, pledging to sanction and commercially restrict Chinese government officials and entities who carry out repression.[713][714] Biden has said he is against regime change but is for providing non-military support to opposition movements.[715] He opposed direct U.S. intervention in Libya,[716][230] voted against U.S. participation in the Gulf War,[717] voted in favor of the Iraq War,[718] and supports a two-state solution in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.[719] Biden has pledged to end U.S. support for the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen and to reevaluate the United States' relationship with Saudi Arabia.[271] Biden supports extending the New START arms control treaty with Russia to limit the number of nuclear weapons deployed by both sides.[720][721] In 2021, Biden officially recognized the Armenian genocide, becoming the first U.S. president to do so.[722][c] Biden has supported abortion rights throughout his presidency, though he personally opposes abortion because of his Catholic faith.[725][726] In 2019, he said he supported Roe v. Wade and repealing the Hyde Amendment.[727][728] After Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, he criticized near-total bans on abortion access passed in a majority of Republican-controlled states,[729] and took measures to protect abortion rights in the United States.[730] He has vowed to sign a bill codifying the protections of Roe into federal law; such a bill passed the House in 2022, but was unable to clear the Senate filibuster.[731][732] Biden was consistently ranked one of the least wealthy members of the Senate,[733][734] which he attributed to having been elected young.[735] Feeling that less-wealthy public officials may be tempted to accept contributions in exchange for political favors, he proposed campaign finance reform measures during his first term.[93] As of November 2009[update], Biden's net worth was $27,012.[736] By November 2020[update], the Bidens were worth $9 million, largely due to sales of Biden's books and speaking fees after his vice presidency.[737][738] Political columnist David S. Broder wrote that Biden has grown over time: \"He responds to real people—that's been consistent throughout. And his ability to understand himself and deal with other politicians has gotten much, much better.\"[33] Journalist James Traub has written that \"Biden is the kind of fundamentally happy person who can be as generous toward others as he is to himself\".[132] In recent years, especially after the 2015 death of his elder son Beau, Biden has been noted for his empathetic nature and ability to communicate about grief.[739][740] In 2020, CNN wrote that his presidential campaign aimed to make him \"healer-in-chief\", while The New York Times described his extensive history of being called upon to give eulogies.[741] Journalist and TV anchor Wolf Blitzer has called Biden loquacious;[742] journalist Mark Bowden has said that he is famous for \"talking too much\", leaning in close \"like an old pal with something urgent to tell you\".[298] He often deviates from prepared remarks,[743] and sometimes \"puts his foot in his mouth\".[168][744][745] Biden has a reputation for being prone to gaffes,[746] and in 2018 called himself \"a gaffe machine\".[747][748] The New York Times wrote that Biden's \"weak filters make him capable of blurting out pretty much anything\".[168] According to The New York Times, Biden often embellishes elements of his life or exaggerates, a trait also noted by The New Yorker in 2014.[749][750] For instance, he has claimed to have been more active in the civil rights movement than he actually was, and has falsely recalled being an excellent student who earned three college degrees.[749] The Times wrote, \"Mr. Biden's folksiness can veer into folklore, with dates that don't quite add up and details that are exaggerated or wrong, the factual edges shaved off to make them more powerful for audiences.\"[750] Biden is the oldest sitting president in U.S. history.[751] During his presidency, Republicans and media pundits have raised questions about his cognitive health in reaction to his public speaking. These narratives were amplified and widely covered by the media after his weak performance in a June 2024 presidential debate.[752] Biden has repeatedly said he is fit for the presidency.[753] On July 21, 2022, Biden tested positive for COVID-19 with reportedly mild symptoms.[754][755] According to the White House, he was treated with Paxlovid.[755][756] He worked in isolation in the White House for five days[757] and returned to isolation when he tested positive again on July 30, 2022.[758][759] On July 17, 2024, Biden again tested positive for COVID-19.[760][761] According to Morning Consult polling, Biden maintained an approval rating above 50% during his presidency's first eight months. In August 2021, it began to decline, reaching the low forties by December.[762] This was attributed to the Afghanistan withdrawal, increasing hospitalizations from the Delta variant, high inflation and gas prices, disarray within the Democratic Party, and a general decline in popularity customary in politics.[763][764][765][766] In 2023, Biden's approval rating was the lowest of any modern[d] U.S. president's after three years in office.[767] The Gallup Organization found Biden's approval ratings to be consistently above 50% during his first few months in office,[768][769] but by August his ratings began to decline.[770] He had a 98% approval rating from Democrats in February 2021, but by December only 78% approved of his presidency.[771][768] By October 2023, his rating among Democrats had reached a record low of 75%.[767][772] His approval rating among Republicans has been consistently in the single digits, aside from his first few months in office.[771] Additionally, Gallup noted that Biden's public support eroded each year he was in office: he averaged 49% approval in his first year,[773] 41% in his second,[774] and 40% in his third.[775] In July 2024, just before he withdrew from the 2024 presidential election, Gallup found his approval rating had fallen to an all-time low of 36%.[776] Nine men have portrayed Biden on Saturday Night Live, starting with Kevin Nealon in 1991. Jason Sudeikis portrayed Biden during the 2008 election season and reprised the role many times. During the 2020 election season, Biden was played by John Mulaney, Alex Moffat, Mikey Day, Woody Harrelson, and Jim Carrey. In 2024, Dana Carvey played the role.[777][778] In 2016, Greg Kinnear portrayed Biden in the HBO television film Confirmation, about the Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination hearings.[779]",

                "content": "Joseph Robinette Biden, Jr. was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, the first of four children of Catherine Eugenia Finnegan Biden and Joseph Robinette Biden, Sr. In 1953, the Biden family moved to Claymont, Delaware. President Biden graduated from the University of Delaware and Syracuse Law School and served on the New Castle County Council. At age 29, President Biden became one of the youngest people ever elected to the United States Senate. Just weeks after his Senate election, tragedy struck the Biden family when his wife Neilia and daughter Naomi were killed, and sons Hunter and Beau were critically injured, in an auto accident. Biden was sworn into the U.S. Senate at his sons’ hospital bedsides and began commuting from Wilmington to Washington every day, first by car, and then by train, in order to be with his family. He would continue to do so throughout his time in the Senate. Biden married Jill Jacobs in 1977, and in 1980, their family was complete with the birth of Ashley Blazer Biden. A lifelong educator, Jill earned her doctorate in education and returned to teaching as an English professor at a community college in Virginia. Beau Biden, Attorney General of Delaware and Joe Biden’s eldest son, passed away in 2015 after battling brain cancer with the same integrity, courage, and strength he demonstrated every day of his life. Beau’s fight with cancer inspires the mission of President Biden’s life — ending cancer as we know it. As a Senator from Delaware for 36 years, President Biden established himself as a leader in facing some of our nation’s most important domestic and international challenges. As Chairman or Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee for 16 years, Biden is widely recognized for his work writing and spearheading the Violence Against Women Act — the landmark legislation that strengthens penalties for violence against women, creates unprecedented resources for survivors of assault, and changes the national dialogue on domestic and sexual assault. As Chairman or Ranking Member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for 12 years, Biden played a pivotal role in shaping U.S. foreign policy. He was at the forefront of issues and legislation related to terrorism, weapons of mass destruction, post-Cold War Europe, the Middle East, Southwest Asia, and ending apartheid. As Vice President, Biden continued his leadership on important issues facing the nation and represented our country abroad. Vice President Biden convened sessions of the President’s Cabinet, led interagency efforts, and worked with Congress in his fight to raise the living standards of middle-class Americans, reduce gun violence, address violence against women, and end cancer as we know it. Biden helped President Obama pass and then oversaw the implementation of the Recovery Act — the biggest economic recovery plan in the history of the nation and our biggest and strongest commitment to clean energy. The President’s plan prevented another Great Depression, created and saved millions of jobs, and led to 75 uninterrupted months of job growth by the end of the administration. And Biden did it all with less than 1% in waste, abuse, or fraud — the most efficient government program in our country’s history. President Obama and Vice President Biden also secured the passage of the Affordable Care Act, which reduced the number of uninsured Americans by 20 million by the time they left office and banned insurance companies from denying coverage due to pre-existing conditions. He served as the point person for U.S. diplomacy throughout the Western Hemisphere, strengthened relationships with our allies both in Europe and the Asia-Pacific, and led the effort to bring 150,000 troops home from Iraq. In a ceremony at the White House, President Obama awarded Biden the Presidential Medal of Freedom with Distinction — the nation’s highest civilian honor. Joe Biden and Barack Obama both in dark suits, holding each other and smilingBarack Obama announces Biden as his vice-presidential running mate in Springfield, Illinois After leaving the White House, the Bidens continued their efforts to expand opportunity for every American with the creation of the Biden Foundation, the Biden Cancer Initiative, the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement, and the Biden Institute at the University of Delaware. On April 25, 2019, Biden announced his candidacy for President of the United States. Biden’s candidacy was built from the beginning around 3 pillars: the battle for the soul of our nation, the need to rebuild our middle class — the backbone of our country, and a call for unity, to act as One America. It was a message that would only gain more resonance in 2020 as we confront a pandemic, an economic crisis, urgent calls for racial justice, and the existential threat of climate change.

                "title": "Ohio State Buckeyes football - Wikipedia",
                "content": "The Ohio State Buckeyes football team competes as part of the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision, representing Ohio State University in the Big Ten Conference. Ohio State has played its home games at Ohio Stadium in Columbus, Ohio, since 1922.[3] The Buckeyes are recognized by the university and NCAA as having won eight national championships,[4] including six from the major wire-service selectors: AP Poll and/or Coaches' Poll. The program has also captured 41 conference championships (2 OAC and 39 Big Ten), 10 division championships, and has compiled 10 undefeated seasons, including six perfect seasons (no losses or ties). Seven players have received the Heisman Trophy (second all-time), with the program holding the distinction of having the only two-time winner (Archie Griffin) of the award. As of 2017, the football program is valued at $1.5–2 billion,[5][6] the highest valuation of any such program in the country. NCAA's first millionaire student-athlete (Quinn Ewers) became such using NIL while in the program. After early attempts at forming a team in 1886 (led by future Nebraska governor Chester Hardy Aldrich) and 1887, football was ultimately established at the university in 1890.[7] On the site of the first OSU game, on the campus of Ohio Wesleyan University in Delaware, Ohio, on May 3, 1890, the Delaware County Historical Society has set an historical marker.[8] Some histories of Ohio State football credit George Cole, an undergraduate, and Alexander S. Lilley with introducing the sport to the campus. More recent research has challenged that claim, stating that George Cole did not persuade Lilley to coach the football team until after its first full season began that fall.[8] OSU's first home game took place at 2:30 p.m. on November 1, 1890. They played the University of Wooster on the site that was then called Recreation Park. Just east of historic German Village, the park occupied the north side of Schiller (now Whittier), between Ebner and Jaeger, in what is now Schumacher Place. OSU lost the game, 64–0. Over the next eight years, under a number of coaches, the team played to a cumulative record of 31 wins, 39 losses, and 2 ties. The first game against the University of Michigan, in Ann Arbor, was a 34–0 loss in 1897, a year that saw the low point in Buckeye football history with a 1–7–1 record. Jack Ryder was Ohio State's first paid coach, earning $150 per season, and lost his first game, against Oberlin College and John Heisman, on October 15, 1892.[9] In 1899 the university hired John Eckstorm to bring professional coaching skills to the program and immediately went undefeated.[10] In 1901, however, center John Sigrist was fatally injured in a game against Western Reserve University and the continuation of football at Ohio State was in serious question. Although the school's athletic board let the team decide its future, Eckstorm resigned.[11] In 1912, football underwent a number of developments that included joining the Western Conference, making football as part of a new Department of Athletics, and hiring Lynn W. St. John to be athletic director. Chic Harley attended East High in Columbus and was regarded as one of the greatest players to attend an Ohio high school. A well-rounded player, Harley came to Ohio State in 1916 and instantly became a fan favorite. Harley and the Buckeyes won the first Big Ten championship in school history in 1916, finishing 7–0. The team would repeat in 1917 finishing 8–0–1. In 1918, Harley left to be a pilot in the U.S. Army Air Service during World War I. With Harley's return in 1919, the Buckeyes would only lose one game, to Illinois. Harley left OSU with a career record of 22–1–1. At the time, OSU played at the small Ohio Field and Harley brought such record crowds it became necessary to open Ohio Stadium in 1922. The stadium was built entirely on fan donations and several stadium drives around the city where Harley would often appear. In 1951, when the College Football Hall of Fame opened, Harley was inducted as an inaugural member. Ohio State's first rival was Kenyon College, a small liberal arts college in Gambier, roughly 50 miles to the northeast. The Buckeyes first played them in their first season in 1890 on Nov 27, Kenyon won the first two meetings; however, Ohio State won 15 in a row and the rivalry diminished. Kenyon made it their season goal to defeat OSU. After the Bucks joined the Big Ten they stopped playing Kenyon. The all-time record stands at 17–6, OSU.[12] In hiring Francis Schmidt in March 1934 to coach its football team, Ohio State moved its program to a \"big-time\" level of competition. Schmidt was a well-established coach and an acknowledged offensive innovator. His offensive schemes were a \"wide-open\" style called \"razzle-dazzle\" and led him to be the first Buckeye football coach granted a multi-year contract. Schmidt's first four seasons saw victories over archrival Michigan, all by shut-out. The 1935 squad went 7–1, its sole loss was to Notre Dame, 18–13, in the first contest between the programs. However Schmidt's remaining seasons were less successful, except in 1939 when the Buckeyes won the Big Ten championship, and his popularity faded for a number of reasons.[13] On December 17, 1940, he resigned. Ohio State hired the coach of Massillon Washington High School football team, Paul Brown, to succeed Schmidt.[14][15] Brown's Tigers had just won their sixth straight state championship. Brown immediately changed Ohio State's style of offense, planned and organized his program in great detail, and delegated to his assistant coaches using highly structured practices. In 1942, Ohio State lost 22 veteran players to military service as the United States joined World War II, and with a team of mostly sophomores went on to lose only once in winning its first national championship. Brown accepted a commission in the United States Navy in 1944, ending his coaching run prior to the season. When Brown went into the Navy, he directed his assistant Carroll Widdoes to head the team in his absence. The 1944 team fielded 31 freshmen but went undefeated and untied, including a victory over Paul Brown's Great Lakes Navy team. Ohio State finished second in the national rankings behind Army and Les Horvath became the first Buckeye to be awarded the Heisman Trophy. Also prominent on the 1942–44 teams was the first Buckeye African American star, Bill Willis. Brown chose not to return to Ohio State after the war, going into professional football instead. Widdoes, despite having the highest two-year winning percentage of any Buckeye coach, asked to return to an assistant's position. Offensive coordinator Paul Bixler and Widdoes switched positions, and Bixler endured a mediocre 4–3–2 season. Bixler resigned and talk of Ohio State being a \"graveyard of coaches\" became commonplace, a reputation that lingered for decades.[16] Wes Fesler became head coach in 1947 but finished last in the Big Ten for the only time in team history. Ohio State improved greatly in 1948, winning 6 and losing 3, then in 1949 enjoyed a successful season due to the play of sophomore Vic Janowicz. Ohio State received the Rose Bowl invitation, where they came from behind to defeat California. In 1950, Fesler, rumored to be resigning because of pressures associated with the position and abuse of his family by anonymous critics, returned to coach the Buckeyes, who won six games in a row to move into the top ranking in the AP poll. However, the season fell apart as the Buckeyes lost to Michigan during a blizzard, a game that came to be known as the \"Snow Bowl\". Two weeks later, citing concerns about his health and family, Fesler resigned. Wayne Woodrow \"Woody\" Hayes beat out Paul Brown,[17] among others, to be named head coach on February 18, 1951. He instituted a demanding practice regimen and was both aggressive and vocal in enforcing it, alienating many players accustomed to Fesler's laid-back style. The 1951 Buckeyes won 4, lost 3, and tied 2, leaving many to question the ability of the new coach. In 1952, the team improved to 6–3 and recorded their first victory over Michigan in eight years, but after a 1953 loss to Michigan, critics called for the replacement of Hayes. In 1954, the Buckeyes were picked to finish no higher than 10th in the Big Ten. Hayes, however, had the talents of Howard \"Hopalong\" Cassady, and a historic goal-line stand against Michigan propelled Ohio State to a perfect season. Hayes led the powerhouse Buckeyes to a shared national championship (his first and the team's second). In 1955 the team again won the Big Ten, set an attendance record, and won in Ann Arbor for the first time in 18 years, while Hopalong Cassady was securing the Heisman Trophy. Ohio State passed only three times against Michigan (the sole reception was the only completion in the final three games of the year), leading to the characterization of Hayes' style of offensive play as \"three yards and a cloud of dust\". In a 1955 article in Sports Illustrated, Hayes admitted to making small personal loans to financially needy players.[18] The article resulted in a furor over possible violations of NCAA rules, and the faculty council, followed by the Big Ten and NCAA, conducted lengthy investigations. Big Ten Commissioner Kenneth \"Tug\" Wilson found Hayes and the program guilty of violations and placed it on a year's probation in 1956. In 1957, Ohio State won all of its remaining games after an opening loss to claim the Big Ten championship, then won the Rose Bowl over Oregon, and shared a national title with Auburn, for which Hayes was named Coach of the Year. In 1961, the team went undefeated to be named national champions by the FWAA but a growing conflict between academics and athletics over Ohio State's reputation as a \"football school\" resulted in a faculty council vote to decline an invitation to the Rose Bowl, resulting in much public protest and debate.[19] Over the next 6 seasons, Ohio State finished no higher than 2nd and had a losing season in 1966, and public speculation that Hayes would be replaced as a coach grew to its highest point since 1953. In 1968, Ohio State defeated the number one-ranked Purdue Boilermakers and continued to an undefeated season including a 50–14 rout of Michigan and a Rose Bowl victory over the USC Trojans that resulted in the national championship. The Class of 1970 became known as the \"super sophomores\" in 1968 and might have gone on to three consecutive national championships except for what may have been the most bitter loss in Buckeye history. The winning streak reached 22 games as Ohio State traveled to Michigan. The Buckeyes were 17-point favorites but directed by first-year coach Bo Schembechler, Michigan shocked the Buckeyes in a 24–12 upset. The 1969 loss to Michigan initiated what came to be known as \"The Ten Year War\", in which the rivalry, which pitted some of OSU's and UM's strongest teams ever, rose to the uppermost level of all sports and the competition between Schembechler and Hayes became legendary.[20] Four times between 1970 and 1975, Ohio State and Michigan were both ranked in the top five of the AP Poll before their matchup. The Wolverines entered every game during those years undefeated and won only once, a 10–7 victory in Ann Arbor on November 20, 1971. Both teams used the annual game as motivation for entire seasons and after the initial win by Michigan, played dead even at four wins and a tie apiece. Hayes had the upper hand during the first part of the war, in which Ohio State won the conference championship and went to the Rose Bowl four straight years, while Michigan won the final three. It was also an era in which through television Ohio State football again came to the forefront of national attention. Hayes set the tone in spring practice in 1970, placing a rug at the entrance to the Buckeye dressing room emblazoned with the words: \"1969 MICH 24 OSU 12 — 1970 MICH:__ OSU:__\" as a constant reminder of their objective.[21] The \"super sophomores\", now seniors, used a strong fullback-oriented offense to smash their way through the season undefeated, struggling only with Purdue the week before the Michigan game. The return match in Columbus found both teams undefeated and untied, a \"first\" in the history of the rivalry, with Michigan, ranked fourth and Ohio State fifth. Ohio State combined a powerful defense that held Michigan to only 37 yards rushing, a rushing offense employing two tight ends as blockers, and a 26-yard touchdown pass from Kern to Bruce Jankowski to win 20–9. The Buckeyes returned to the Rose Bowl to be upset by Stanford 27–17. The \"super sophomores\" had garnered a record of 27–2, the best winning percentage of any three-year period in team history, and won or shared the Big Ten title all three years. The National Football Foundation named Ohio State as a national co-champion, along with Texas, for 1970 and awarded the teams joint possession of the MacArthur Bowl. 1971 was less successful than the preceding seasons, but the middle four years of the 10-year war saw the greatest success for Hayes against Michigan, although the teams fell short of repeating their 1968 national championship. Archie Griffin began his college football career in 1972, taking advantage of new NCAA eligibility rules that allowed freshmen to compete at the varsity level. In his second game, sent in against North Carolina late in the first quarter, Griffin set a new Buckeye rushing record with 239 yards and led the team in rushing for the season with 867. The following season, Hayes installed an I-formation attack with Griffin at tailback and fellow sophomore Cornelius Greene at quarterback. The Buckeyes went undefeated with a powerful offense and impenetrable defense, achieving an average margin of victory of 31 points a game. The only blemish on their record was a 10–10 tie with Michigan after both teams had entered the game unbeaten. (The tie was more galling for the Wolverines, however, as the Big Ten selected Ohio State to represent the conference in the Rose Bowl.) Despite soundly defeating defending national champion USC, however, the tie with Michigan resulted in the Buckeyes finishing second to Notre Dame in the final AP rankings. Griffin, Randy Gradishar, Van DeCree, and John Hicks were named All-Americans; Hicks, an offensive tackle, not only won both the Outland and Lombardi Trophies but placed second in the Heisman Trophy competition. 1974 and 1975 were seasons of both elation and frustration. The Buckeyes twice more defeated Michigan, and went to two Rose Bowls, but lost both. The 1974 team seemed bound for another national championship when it was derailed by a loss to unranked Michigan State (Ohio State lost only twice in the regular season during Griffin's four-year career, both to the Spartans), and the next year, the No. 1-ranked Bucks lost 23–10 to 11th-ranked UCLA in the 1976 Rose Bowl. In all, the Buckeyes were 40–5–1 from 1972 to 1975, winning the Big Ten all four years and never losing to Michigan, but it was the losses and ties that proved important to Ohio State missing out on achieving a national championship. At any rate, Archie Griffin rushed for 5,589 yards combined in his four seasons at Ohio State while winning the Heisman Trophy in 1974 (1,695 yards rushed) and 1975 (1,450 yards).[22] The falloff in the success of Hayes' last three years was not great. His teams forged records of 9–2–1, 9–3, and 7–4–1, and made bowl appearances in all three years (the rules had changed to allow appearances in other than the Rose Bowl). However, frustrations in losing three straight years to Michigan, and other factors, resulted in growing criticism of Hayes and his methods, particularly his on-the-field fits of temper. Even so, his downfall was sudden and shocking when near the end of the nationally televised Gator Bowl, Hayes punched Clemson middle guard Charlie Bauman after Bauman intercepted a pass to kill Ohio State's last chance to win.[23] Hayes was fired after the game by Ohio State president Harold Enarson and athletic director Hugh Hindman.[24] Hayes was replaced by a former protégé, Iowa State head coach Earle Bruce.[25] Bruce inherited a strong team led by sophomore quarterback Art Schlichter but that had also lost 11 starters, and the 1979 squad exceeded pre-season expectations, ending the 3-year loss drought against Michigan and going to the Rose Bowl with an opportunity once again to be national champions. The Buckeyes lost both by a single point, 17–16, but Bruce was named Coach of the Year. His success was hailed by those in the media who saw it as a rebuke of Hayes and the start of a \"new era\".[26] 1980, however, saw the start of a trend that eventually brought criticism to Bruce, when Ohio State finished with a 9–3 record, the first of six consecutive years at 9–3. Though each of these seasons, and the 10–3 season that followed them, culminated in a bowl game, Ohio State did not appear to be any closer to a national championship than during the end of the Hayes era. Bruce's teams were not without impact players, however. All-Americans and future National Football League stars included Keith Byars, Cris Carter, Chris Spielman, John Frank, Jim Lachey, Tom Tupa, Marcus Marek, and Pepper Johnson. His program was also known for the number of notable assistant coaches on staff, including Jim Tressel, Glen Mason, Pete Carroll, Nick Saban, Urban Meyer and Dom Capers. For the first time since 1922, the Buckeyes lost three in a row in Ohio Stadium in 1982, including rematches with Stanford and Florida State, and for the second year in a row to Wisconsin, but then won seven straight, the last over BYU in the Holiday Bowl. Sophomore running back Keith Byars had a stand-out season in 1983, rushing for 1,199 yards, and Ohio State defeated the Oklahoma Sooners in Norman, but three losses in conference meant a 4th-place finish. 1984 witnessed what Bruce called \"the greatest comeback after the worst start\" when Ohio State fell behind Illinois 24–0 at home but roared back on 274 yards rushing and five touchdowns by Byars to win 45–38. Ohio State also defeated Michigan to win an outright Big Ten championship. Byars led the nation in rushing and scoring but finished second in Heisman balloting. In 1986, Bruce received a 3-year contract, the first for the modern program but the team opened with two losses, which had not occurred in over 90 years. The Buckeyes then won 9 in a row before Michigan took a close game when kicker Matt Frantz missed a field goal with a minute to play. After the season Bruce was offered the position of head coach at the University of Arizona with a 5-year contract but was persuaded to stay at his alma mater by Athletic Director Rick Bay. Hopes for a standout season in 1987 suffered a serious setback when All-American wide receiver Cris Carter was dropped from the team for signing with an agent. Indiana defeated Ohio State for the first time since 1951, 31–10, in a game that came to be known as the \"darkest day\",[27] and Ohio State lost three conference games in a row going into the Michigan game. On the Monday of Michigan week, after a weekend of rumors and speculation, Ohio State President Edward Jennings fired Bruce but tried to keep the dismissal secret until after the end of the season. Bay, who had been instrumental in keeping Bruce at Ohio State, disregarded Jennings' orders and announced the firing and his own resignation in protest. Jennings made his own situation worse by refusing to give a reason for the firing and the circumstances have been the subject of controversy since.[28] The Buckeyes enjoyed an emotional come-from-behind victory over Michigan in Ann Arbor after the entire team wore headbands bearing the word \"EARLE\", then declined an invitation to play in the Sun Bowl. John Cooper was hired as the 21st football head coach at Ohio State before the end of 1987 and before he had coached his last game at Arizona State University.[29] Cooper's coaching record at ASU and at Tulsa prior to that stood out among his credentials, as did a victory over Michigan in the 1987 Rose Bowl.[30] Cooper's 13 years as the Buckeye head coach are largely remembered in the litany of negative statistics associated with him: a notorious 2–10–1 record against Michigan, a 3–8 record in bowl games, a 5-year losing streak to Illinois to start his term and a 6–7 record overall, and blowing a 15-point 3rd quarter lead in a 28–24 loss to unranked Michigan State when the Buckeyes were the top-ranked team in the nation and en route to a national championship. However, his record also has many positives: back-to-back victories over Notre Dame, two finishes second-ranked in the polls, and three Big Ten championships (albeit shared). Cooper also recruited 15 players who were first-round draft picks in the National Football League.[31] Both 1988 and 1989 began identically: a season-opening win followed by an embarrassing loss to a highly regarded team (Pitt and USC); a rebound win against two other highly regarded programs (LSU and Boston College) followed by a loss to Illinois in the conference opener. However, 1988 saw Ohio State lose its first three conference games and a close game at home against Michigan for a 4–6–1 record, its first losing season in 22 years. In 1989 the Buckeyes won 6 consecutive Big Ten games before losing its last two to go 8–4. The most noteworthy victory occurred in Minneapolis when Ohio State overcame a 31–0 deficit to Minnesota to win 41–37. 1990 continued the pattern with a 2-win 2-loss start and an overall 7–4–1 record that included an embarrassing loss to Air Force in the Liberty Bowl. 1991 was 8–4, notable primarily as the season that sophomore running back Robert Smith quit the team. 1992, with senior Kirk Herbstreit at quarterback, and Smith back on the team was 8–3–1, but the losing string to Michigan was broken with a 13–13 tie. Persistent rumors that Cooper would resign or be fired were laid to rest when University President Gordon Gee announced he would be back in 1993.[32] The next six seasons were very successful, winning 10 or more games in five out of six, and sharing the conference championship in three. Eddie George won the Heisman Trophy in 1995 after a tremendous senior season, Ohio State defeated Notre Dame in 1995 and 1996, and won half its bowl games. But in three seasons (1993, 1995, and 1996) the Buckeyes entered the Michigan game undefeated, with the possibility of a national championship in at least one, and lost all three to underdog Wolverine teams. Ohio State had won 62 games and lost only 12, but a third of those were to Michigan. After renewing his contract and becoming a member of the \"million dollar coaching club\",[33] Cooper started sophomore Austin Moherman against the Miami Hurricanes in the nationally televised Kickoff Classic and was soundly beaten. That presaged a mediocre season in which the Buckeyes finished 6–6, ending their successful 90's run. The 2000 team was more successful, going 8–4, but criticism of Cooper among fans had risen to a clamor again and touched on many areas of the program beyond specific game records. The negative publicity rose to a peak in the days leading up to Ohio State's matchup with South Carolina in the Outback Bowl, when wide receiver Reggie Germany was suspended for having a 0.0 GPA, team captain Matt Wilhelm publicly criticized fellow player Ken-Yon Rambo, and one Buckeye lineman sued another.[34] On January 3, 2001, Cooper was fired.[35] His loss in the Outback Bowl to a team that had not even won a single game the year before was a factor in his subsequent firing, as was negative publicity regarding player behavior before and during the game. Other contributing factors included the record against Michigan (which was actually considered by most people to be the biggest reason for his firing), a reputation of inability to win \"big games\", the lack of a national championship, the perception of him as an outsider by many alumni, the poor bowl game record, and finally a perceived lack of discipline on the team. Ohio State quickly sought a replacement for Cooper and after a nationwide search hired Jim Tressel.[36] With four NCAA Division I-AA National Championships at Youngstown State University, Tressel, formerly an assistant coach for Earle Bruce, was an Ohioan who was considered to be appreciative of Buckeye football traditions. Although there were some doubts as to whether or not Tressel could repeat his earlier success at the Division 1A level, most fans and alumni met the coaching change with enthusiasm. On the day of his hiring, Jim Tressel, speaking to fans and students at a Buckeye basketball game, made a prophetic implication that he would lead the Buckeyes to beat Michigan in Ann Arbor the following November.[37] Tressel's first season was difficult as the Buckeyes finished 7–5 (all but one loss was by a touchdown or less), but he made good on his promise, beating Michigan in Ann Arbor. While its fans were optimistic about the chance for success of the 2002 team, most observers were surprised by Ohio State's National Championship.[38][39] Ohio State used strong defense, ball-control play-calling, and field position tactics to win numerous close games, a style of play characterized as \"Tresselball\",[40] and disparaged by detractors as \"the Luckeyes\".[41] The 2006 and 2007 regular seasons ended with just one combined loss and consecutive appearances in the national championship game. The Buckeyes lost both by wide margins. On January 1, 2010, the Buckeyes defeated the Oregon Ducks in The Rose Bowl Game by a score of 26–17. This ended a 3-game BCS losing streak for Ohio State, having lost 2 national championships and one Tostitos Fiesta Bowl. Terrelle Pryor was named MVP of the contest with 2 touchdown passes for a career-high 266 passing yards. In addition, he had more total yards than the entire Oregon Ducks team. In December 2010, it was announced that five student-athletes on the football team would be suspended for the first five games of the 2011 season for NCAA violations. The punishments stemmed from an incident when some of the Buckeye players received tattoos for their autographs, according to news reports. Other violations committed by the players included the selling of several items given to them by the university, such as Big Ten championship rings.[42] On December 22, 2010, the NCAA announced that five players would be suspended for the first five games of the 2011 season due to receiving improper benefits. Mike Adams, Dan Herron, DeVier Posey, Solomon Thomas, and quarterback Terrelle Pryor were found to have signed autographs in return for tattoos, as well as selling memorabilia given to them by the university.[43] In addition, Jordan Whiting was suspended for the season opener for his involvement. The scandal originated at Fine Line Tattoos and Piercings in Columbus, whose owner, Edward Rife, was being investigated for felony drug trafficking. On January 4, 2011, with all the players allowed to participate by the NCAA, the Buckeyes defeated the Arkansas Razorbacks in the Sugar Bowl by a margin of 31–26.[44] The win, along with every other one from the 2010 season, would later be vacated due to the scandal. The Buckeyes finished the season 12–1, with their only official game being a loss to Wisconsin. On March 8, 2011, OSU suspended head coach Jim Tressel for the first 2 games of the 2011 season and fined him $250,000 for not informing the university and the NCAA that he had knowledge of his players receiving improper benefits. Coach Tressel's suspension would later be increased to 5 games by the university. On May 30, 2011, Jim Tressel resigned as head coach of the Buckeyes.[45] On June 6, 2011, a story in Sports Illustrated reported that at least 28 players, including Rob Rose, T. J. Downing, Louis Irizarry, Chris Vance, C. J. Barnett, Dorien Bell, Jamaal Berry, Bo DeLande, Zach Domicone, Storm Klein, Etienne Sabino, John Simon, Nathan Williams, Jermale Hines, Devon Torrence, Donald Washington, Thaddeus Gibson, Jermil Martin, Lamaar Thomas, and Doug Worthington traded team memorabilia or used equipment for tattoos or other merchandise or services between 2002 and 2010. The report alleged that Tressel had violated NCAA bylaw 10.1, unethical conduct, three times by not acting when told of the tattoo improprieties, by signing a statement saying he knew of no violations, and for withholding information on what was going on from university officials.[46] On July 8, 2011, Ohio State University decided to vacate all victories from the 2010 football season as self-imposed punishment for major NCAA violations.[47] Former coach Jim Tressel received more than $52,000 from the university and didn't have to pay a $250,000 fine for his involvement in the scandal. His status was also changed from \"Resigned\" to \"Retired\" in keeping with his wishes to \"remain a Buckeye for life\".[48] Ohio State named Luke Fickell interim head coach for the 2011 season following Tressel's resignation, and Fickell coached the 2011 Buckeyes to a 6–7 record; going 6–6 in the regular season and losing in the Gator Bowl to Florida. On November 28, 2011, former University of Florida head coach and ESPN college football analyst Urban Meyer accepted the position of Buckeyes head coach.[49] Meyer assumed head coaching responsibilities following the Buckeyes' January 2012 Gator Bowl appearance. Meyer's first season at Ohio State did not include a postseason contest, as the Buckeyes were sanctioned with a one-year bowl ban on December 20, 2011. The NCAA sanctions also included the loss of three scholarships each year for the following three years and three years' probation to end on December 19, 2014. Ohio State was required to vacate all wins from the 2010 season, the 2010 Big Ten Conference championship and their win in the 2011 Sugar Bowl. The school's share of the Sugar Bowl proceeds was forfeited as well.[50] In Meyer's first year, the Buckeyes went a perfect 12–0, winning the 2012 Big Ten Leaders Division, though the previously mentioned sanctions kept them from playing in the 2012 Big Ten Football Championship Game and a postseason bowl game.[50] On November 23, 2013, the Buckeyes clinched their second straight Leaders Division Championship, after defeating Indiana 42–14. With the victory over Indiana, Ohio State set a team record for all-time consecutive wins, with 23. The following week, Ohio State defeated Michigan 42–41 in Ann Arbor, to increase the streak to 24. The streak ended with Ohio State's 34–24 loss to Michigan State in the 2013 Big Ten Conference Championship game on December 7, marking Meyer's first loss as the Buckeyes' head coach. On January 3, 2014, the Buckeyes were defeated by Clemson in the Orange Bowl 40–35. On November 22, 2014, the Buckeyes clinched the first-ever Big Ten East Division Championship when they defeated Indiana 42–27, earning a berth in the 2014 Big Ten Championship Game, where they defeated West Division champion Wisconsin 59–0 to win the Big Ten Conference Championship and qualified for the four-team playoff to decide the National Champion. OSU defeated Alabama in the Sugar Bowl 42–35, on January 1, 2015, to qualify for the National Championship Game against Rose Bowl winner Oregon on January 12 (the Rose and Sugar Bowls were the designated semifinal games in 2014). OSU claimed the first-ever College Football Playoff National Championship by defeating Oregon 42–20.[51][52][53] The 2015 season for the Buckeyes began with a 10–0 start before losing on a last-second field goal to Michigan State on November 21, ending the Buckeyes' quest to repeat as National Champions. However, the Buckeyes recovered their 2 next games with dominating wins over Michigan and then over Notre Dame in the Fiesta Bowl to finish the season at 12–1. The 2016 season started off great with 6 straight victories, including a win over the Oklahoma Sooners, but the streak came to an end as the team lost a heart-breaker to the Penn State Nittany Lions. The Buckeyes went on to win the rest of their regular-season games, finishing 11–1. They did not play in the Big Ten Championship as Penn State took the division. In a controversial call, the College Football Playoff committee gave Ohio State a spot in the Playoff. Ohio State lost in the Fiesta Bowl to the Clemson Tigers in an embarrassing 31–0 loss, ending the season 11–2. The 2017 season started out on a high note with a victory over the Indiana Hoosiers, but the next week the Buckeyes fell to the Oklahoma Sooners. The Buckeyes won the next 6 games, including a win over No. 2 Penn State in a revenge game of sorts. The Buckeyes suffered an embarrassing defeat against the Iowa Hawkeyes. The Buckeyes ended the season 12–2 overall, winning the rest of their games including a Big Ten Championship victory over Wisconsin and a Cotton Bowl victory over USC. Urban Meyer was suspended for the first three games of the 2018 season for mishandling domestic violence allegations against then-wide receivers coach Zach Smith. Co-Offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach Ryan Day served as interim coach and led the Buckeyes to a 3–0 start. Meyer returned to the sidelines and coached the team to four more victories before the team suffered a loss on October 20 to Purdue, 49–20. The Buckeyes won their last four games of the regular season, including a 62–39 win over archrival Michigan, in Columbus. The win gave the Buckeyes a share of the Big Ten East Division title, and the right to face Northwestern in the Big Ten Championship Game, which Ohio State won for its second consecutive Big Ten Championship. Ohio State would go on to win the Rose Bowl over Pac-12 Champion Washington 28–23, giving Ohio State their 8th Rose Bowl win. On December 4, 2018, the university announced that Meyer would retire after the 2019 Rose Bowl and be replaced by co-offensive coordinator Ryan Day.[54][55] In Day's first year, the Buckeyes went a perfect 13–0, including a win over archrival Michigan by a score of 56–27 and defeating Wisconsin for the Big Ten Championship. They would earn a spot in the College Football Playoff but would lose to Clemson 29–23 in the 2019 Fiesta Bowl. In Day's second year, the Big Ten season didn't start until late October due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Buckeyes would only play five out of a scheduled eight games due to several virus-related cancellations - including the Michigan game. Nevertheless, the Buckeyes would go 5–0 in the regular season, win the East Division title, and go on to beat Northwestern 22–10 in the Big Ten Championship Game, giving Day his second straight conference title. On January 1, 2021, the Buckeyes defeated Clemson 49–28 to win the Sugar Bowl in a rematch of the 2019 Fiesta Bowl to advance to the CFP National Championship Game against Alabama on January 11, which they lost 52–24. On September 11, 2021, he suffered his first regular season loss as head coach when the Oregon Ducks defeated the Buckeyes 35–28 in the 2nd game of the season. Ohio State's streak of defeating Michigan also came to an end on November 27, 2021, in Ann Arbor, when Ohio State lost 42–27.[56] They then won the 2022 Rose Bowl against Utah 48–45 on January 1, 2022. In 2022, Day led the team to an 11–0 record and was ranked #2 going into the Michigan game, which #3 Michigan would win 45–23 on November 26, 2022 (outscoring the Buckeyes 28–3 in the second half), in Ohio State's first loss to Michigan in Columbus since 2000, and first back–to–back losses to Michigan since 1999–2000. The Buckeyes would go on to play the defending national champion Georgia Bulldogs in the 2022 national semifinal game on New Year's Eve, taking a 14-point lead into the fourth quarter, but ultimately seeing their season come to an end with a 42–41 loss.[57] Kicker Noah Ruggles' would-be game-winning field goal attempt sailed wide left just as the clock struck midnight on New Year's Day, 2023. In 2023, Day led the team to an 11–0 record and was ranked #2 going into the Michigan game for the second consecutive year. This time, Michigan won by six points 30–24 on November 25, 2023. This marked the first three game losing streak to Michigan since 1995–97. The Buckeyes were then invited to the 2023 Cotton Bowl, where they lost to the Missouri Tigers 14–3 on December 29, 2023. Ohio State recognizes eight national championships from NCAA-designated \"consensus\" selectors,[58][59] including six (1942, 1954, 1957, 1968, 2002, 2014) from the major wire-service: AP Poll and/or Coaches' Poll.[59][60] The following is a list of Ohio State's claimed national championships: Ohio State has also been selected an additional seven times by various NCAA-designated \"major selectors\", in 1933, 1944, 1969, 1973, 1974, 1975, and 2006.[59][63][64] However, the Buckeyes do not recognize any of those championships. Ohio State joined the Big Ten in 1912; before that they were a member of the Ohio Athletic Conference (OAC) and won two OAC titles. Ohio State has won a championship in the Big Ten 39 times, second-most in the conference.[65] † Co-champions From 2011 to 2023, Big Ten had divisions to decide who would play for the conference championship. The divisions were known as Legends and Leaders from 2011 to 2013. In 2014, the divisions were realigned geographically into East and West. The divisional format ended for the 2024 season. † Co-champions Ohio State has played in 55 bowl games in which they are 27–29–0.[66] The Buckeyes have been to the Rose Bowl 16 times. Below are the team's most recent bowl games. † Vacated Ohio State University Marching Band[68] is the most visible and possibly best-known tradition of Ohio State football.[69] Home games are preceded by four marching band traditions:[70] The series versus Illinois began in 1902 and became the longest continuous series in 2002 when the schools played in their 89th consecutive year. In 2007, Ohio State was given their only defeat of the regular season by the Illini. Through the 2019 season, Ohio State leads the series 68–30–4.[71] Ohio State's first game with Michigan dates to 1897. Michigan leads the series 62–51–6 through the 2024 season.[72]This rivalry is considered to be Buckeyes' biggest rivalry. All the appearances of the letter M in Ohio Stadium are crossed out with red tape. Halftime shows during OSU games often feature something bad happening to the Michigan logo. When Penn State was added to the Big Ten conference football play in 1993, every member was given two designated rivals, teams to be played every year, with the other conference teams rotated out of the schedule at regular intervals. For geographic convenience, the Big Ten named Penn State as Ohio State's new designated rival in addition to Michigan. Ohio State leads the series 25–14 through the 2024 season.[73] The Buckeyes have had 24 head coaches in their 121-year history. Of the team's eight national championships to date, Woody Hayes won five, with Paul Brown, Jim Tressel, and Urban Meyer each having one. Roster Last update: August 22, 2024 [74] This table reflects the results of Big Ten match-ups when both OSU and its opponent were members of the conference through November 9, 2019.[75] Ohio State began Big Ten play in 1913. Examples of excluded results are Chicago after 1939, Michigan between 1907 and 1916, Michigan State before 1953, Penn State before 1993, and Nebraska before 2011 (see Big Ten History for further information). Ohio State's vacated wins from 2010 are not included (see 2010 Ohio State Buckeyes football team for further information). Through the 2006 season, Ohio State players have by a significant margin won more trophies than any other NCAA Division 1A program. Ohio State players have won 34 of the listed major awards, with the next closest being 26 (Oklahoma). Ohio State is the only university to have received each of the awards at least once. Of the five awards created prior to 1980 (Heisman, Lombardi, Maxwell, Outland, and Walter Camp), Ohio State has received the most with 25 (Notre Dame follows with 23). Although these numbers are cited as \"retired\" on Ohio State website,[76] they are considered enshrined rather than retired, and are available to be worn. All previously retired jersey numbers remain retired.[77] In 2020, the NCAA approved the use of the No. 0.[78] In order to further pay tribute to Bill Willis, Coach Day decided to start a new tradition and choose the player who will wear the number each season.[79] Note: Due to number restrictions, Thayer Munford could not wear number 0. Instead, he wore his regular number and honored the award with a patch. Two head coaches have also been honored by the Buckeyes, with banners at Ohio Stadium: Ohio State players have won the Heisman Trophy seven times, which ties Notre Dame and Oklahoma for the second most awards for any school, behind only USC with eight. Archie Griffin is the only two-time recipient in the history of the award.[80] Ohio State players have won the Lombardi Award six times: Four Ohio State players have won the Maxwell Award: Four Ohio State players have won the Outland Trophy: Ohio State players have won the Walter Camp Award four times: Ohio State Players have won the Fred Biletnikoff Award twice: Ohio State Players have won the Bronko Nagurski Trophy award twice: Ohio State players have won the Dick Butkus Award twice: Ohio State players have won the Jim Thorpe Award twice: Ohio State players have won the Dave Rimington Trophy four times: Ohio State players have won the Chicago Tribune Silver Football award 23 times: Ohio State players have won the Graham–George Offensive Player of the Year 13 times: Ohio State players have won the Nagurski–Woodson Defensive Player of the Year 11 times: Through 2017, 199 Buckeyes have been named first team All-Americans since 1914. Of those 85 have been consensus picks. 388 have been named to the All-Big Ten team, and 16 have won the Chicago Tribune Silver Football, the Big Ten's Most Valuable Player award, including Troy Smith for 2006. The Athletic Directors of the Big Ten Conference voted Eddie George Big Ten-Jesse Owens Athlete of the Year for 1996.

                "content": "Christian Dickson Walker (born March 28, 1991) is an American professional baseball first baseman who is a free agent. He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Baltimore Orioles and Arizona Diamondbacks. Walker played college baseball for the South Carolina Gamecocks and won the College World Series in 2010 and 2011. Walker was selected in the fourth round of the 2012 MLB draft by the Orioles and made his MLB debut with the team in 2014. He was later claimed off waivers in 2017 by the Diamondbacks and became their regular first baseman after Paul Goldschmidt was traded following the 2018 season. Walker is a three-time Gold Glove Award winner and helped the Diamondbacks win the National League pennant in 2023. Walker attended Kennedy-Kenrick Catholic High School in Norristown, Pennsylvania.[1] He was drafted by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 49th round of the 2009 Major League Baseball draft, but did not sign. Walker attended the University of South Carolina and played college baseball for the South Carolina Gamecocks from 2010 to 2012. While there, he helped the Gamecocks win the College World Series in 2010 and 2011. He also helped the team reach the 2012 College World Series, where they lost to the Arizona Wildcats. He finished tied with Dustin Ackley for most career hits in the College World Series.[2] Overall in his career at South Carolina, he played in 206 games and hit 336/.427/.533 with 30 home runs and 137 runs batted in. In 2011, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Harwich Mariners of the Cape Cod Baseball League.[3] The Baltimore Orioles selected Walker in the fourth round of the 2012 Major League Baseball draft.[4][5] He made his debut for the Aberdeen IronBirds. He played in 22 games and hit .284/.376/.420 with two home runs. Walker started 2013 with the Delmarva Shorebirds.[6] In May he was promoted to the Frederick Keys.[7] In July he played in the All-Star Futures Game.[8] After the game he was promoted to the Double-A Bowie Baysox. He finished the year playing in 103 games and hit .300/.362/.453 with 11 home runs. Walker started 2014 back with Bowie.[9][10] On September 17, 2014, Walker was called up to the Orioles from the Triple–A Norfolk Tides.[11] He made his major league debut later that day. Facing Toronto Blue Jays pitcher J. A. Happ, Walker hit a double for his first major league hit.[12] On September 20, he had his first multi-hit game, including his first career major league home run, off Boston Red Sox starter, Rubby De La Rosa.[13] On February 21, 2017, the Orioles designated Walker for assignment.[14] On March 6, 2017, the Cincinnati Reds claimed Walker off waivers. The Atlanta Braves also put a waiver claim on Walker, but lost due to the order.[15] On March 28, 2017, Walker was waived by the Reds and claimed by the Arizona Diamondbacks who assigned him to the Reno Aces of the Pacific Coast League (PCL). He was selected as the 2017 PCL Most Valuable Player.[16] Walker was called up again and played in 11 games in 2017 for the Diamondbacks, batting .250 with 2 homers. He played in 37 games in 2018, for a .163 average with 3 home runs. In 2019, Walker hit .259/.348/.476 with 29 home runs and 73 RBIs. He had a 9 Defensive Runs Saved (DRS) rating, the best in the National League among first basemen, and led all major league first basemen with 139 assists.[17][18] In the pandemic-shortened 2020 season, he hit .271/.333/.459 with 7 home runs and 34 RBIs. In 2021, Walker batted .244/.315/.382 with 10 home runs and 46 RBIs in 115 games. The following year, he hit a career-high 36 home runs and drove in 94 runs while winning his first career Gold Glove Award. On January 13, 2023, Walker agreed to a one-year, $6.5 million contract with the Diamondbacks, avoiding salary arbitration.[19] That season, he set career highs in RBIs (103), total bases (289), and slugging percentage (.497) and won his second consecutive Gold Glove Award. He helped lead the Diamondbacks to the 2023 World Series, where they lost to the Texas Rangers.",

Unpopular on the Left for his noncompliance, loved by his followers for his originality and authenticity, Christian is nothing short of captivating. Read our interview with Christian for his perspective on all the hottest topics, from Black Lives Matter to fashion. You’re a rising star within the conservative movement. What forces in your life have influenced your conservative beliefs? What inspired you to voice your conservative viewpoints on social media? So, I live in Los Angeles, where it’s very unpopular to be a “conserva-Trumper,” and I had not voiced my political opinions in years. I was in the process of transferring to UCLA and was beginning an acting career. Coronavirus hit at the worst possible timing for my career and scholastic endeavors. I was heartbroken, but it wasn’t too big of a deal, as many of my plans were simply being pushed back. That was until the Black Lives Matter riots started. In a matter of a week, the whole country was on fire. In Los Angeles, specifically, the riots started downtown but eventually came to West LA. I watched from my roof as eight helicopters flew around the city, cop cars were lit on fire, and rioters broke into my local bakery. It seriously seemed like a scene out of a movie. As bad as all that was, it wasn’t what finally pushed me over the edge. It was the fact that as the country burned, as our police officers were attacked, as people were denouncing western civilization (the freest society in world history), people were saying nothing. If black squares were a word, that’s all anyone was saying! The insanity was too much to handle, and I knew people wanted to speak out but felt like they couldn’t. So, I started using my voice loudly. And, it seems to have attracted a lot of attention because of how frustrated people are with pop culture, and more specifically, how politics has infiltrated every part of our culture. The Left has now demonized people who don’t believe exactly what the “mainstream brainwashers” tell you to. Anyhow, I’d say it’s a mix of my faith, research, and knowledge of history that’s culminated together and created my conservative values. At this point, conservatism simply means: “hi, I love my country and my freedom to say, do, and think what I want.” Saying you’re not conservative basically means: “I don’t really know the history of the world and how communism infiltrates political institutions, so I’ll just pretend transgender pronouns are more important than freedom.” You’re a college student, yet you’ve already cultivated a widespread following on social media. What’s the best part of being a social media influencer? How do you handle the hate that comes along with being an outspoken conservative? I love being a voice for people who genuinely feel like they’ve lost their voice. People feel as though they’ll lose their job or their livelihood simply for being open about their views. The Left claims that minorities (whether that be skin color, gender, or sexuality) are the “voiceless” right now, but that is absolutely not the truth. We’re yelled at all day by radical Leftists announcing their victimhood badge. The true “voiceless” in our society right now are conservatives. Furthermore, we’ve reached the point where people are demonized if they don’t act like the Left expects them to. So, I like standing up to the bully Left. I like setting an example and showing people that there’s nothing wrong with having your own opinions and perspective. The love I receive outweighs the hate, but if I’m being called a “halloween-eyed horseface house slave” by a Leftist, then that means I must have an argument that they can’t disprove (which is always). You frequently speak out against the progressive agenda that has infiltrated the American education system. Do you believe our education system has contributed to the rise of radicalism and anti-Americanism that has taken root in our generation? Public schools and colleges have turned into Leftists indoctrination centers. There’s no “tolerance” for any perspective other than the one that the professor is pumping into you. I’m in a class right now on globalization, and the professor basically talks for 45-minutes about how much she hates Trump, then assigns us articles that are 3000% anti-Trump. We’re learning about “how great” neoliberal trade is, but the same policies that this woman is pushing are the same neoliberal policies that failed middle-America during Obama’s Presidency. Globalization, in the way it is being discussed in my class, specifically favored coastal elites and hurt average Americans. Yet, we’re not learning about any of the downsides. This indoctrination is further seen in how colleges are coddling Marxist ideas and teaching students about “the upsides of communism.” Can we talk to the 100 million-plus people who died as a direct result communism, and then maybe circle back to the upsides? The Left infiltrated our school systems and our culture, and now children are put through these Leftist factories and come out as full-on America haters. They don’t know proper history, they don’t know how to make fact- based arguments, and they don’t know how to deal with people with different perspectives. It’s extremely dangerous, and the Left is wicked for doing it. You are a vocal critic of the Black Lives Matter movement, labeling it as a “radical terrorist organization.” Most of your criticism lies in BLM’s political motivations, as you’ve called the movement “hypocritical,” “anti-American,” and “Marxist.” Why do you believe that BLM’s political aspirations are detrimental to American society, and the black community specifically? I’d have to write a book about this to fully express my opinions. Between BLM’s hatred for the nuclear family (father absence is the number one issue affecting the black community), and hatred of anyone who thinks differently than them, we wouldn’t have enough time to go over everything. But, the best way I can sum it up is in two points: culture and western civilization. We have certain ideals that we value in our country, the main one being freedom. BLM has said, themselves, that they hate western civilization. They hate our autonomy, they hate that we don’t judge based on identity, and they hate the idea of accountability. This leads me into culture. BLM has taken individual circumstances and labeled them as representative of the whole country, even though, when looked at statistically, it is far from true. Black America’s issue is culture. It is the degradation of women in rap songs. It is the promotion of disrespect. It is the lack of respect for people in careers that require an education. And it is the defense of criminals. Black America refuses to analyze this perspective and instead act as though the whole world is against them— BLM has capitalized off of that sense of victimhood. It’s dangerous to tell a portion of the population that they are victims, and then egg them on to act out violently. It is the same sort of coup d’etat behavior we saw in the Bolshevik Revolution. “Identity politics” is at the forefront of American culture. What is your perspective regarding identity politics? Do you believe in the notion that emphasizing one’s “identity” rather than one’s “ideas” is dangerous? Are five scoops of vanilla ice cream that’s five different colors diverse? Or are five scoops of white ice cream with five different flavors (coconut, pina colada, vanilla, birthday cake, and sugar cookie) more diverse? I’m going with the latter. The Left is saying, “Look at us, we have a transgender, a Latino immigrant who identifies as non-binary, and a black person. They all think exactly the same but screw you, we’re diverse!” That’s not diversity to me. Just like the vanilla ice cream that’s 5 different colors tastes the same. Diversity, in my opinion, is diversity of thought. It is being able to think for yourself and come to your own conclusions. The Left likes to pretend we’re in the 1920s where people aren’t accepted for who they are, and it’s simply not the truth. They’ve used this to create fringe groups (silicon valley, lgbtq+, the black community, immigrants) in which you’re forced to all think the same and identify as liberal. People are scared to think outside of the cage the Left has locked them in to. This sort of thinking is dangerous for a country that is founded in thinking for yourself, and having the freedom to do so. You break down many stereotypes. What do you think are the most prominent misconceptions liberals hold against conservatives? Liberals have too many labels for conservatives to even count, and in my opinion, it’s because they know that we are all about thought-processes and not our identity. When you’re unwilling to think for yourself, it’s clearly easier to be accepted into a way of thinking that accepts you simply for your identification. It’s group-think, you don’t have to do a thing except be. Conservatism requires one to leave their identifications at the front door, and bring their brain and logic into the room. Many times, “racist,” “misogynistic,” “homophobic,” “white supremacist,” “transphobic,” “Islamophobe,” and “anti-immigrant” are just terms to scare people from hearing logic based arguments that make sense. It has become increasingly difficult for conservatives to voice their opinions. Many conservatives feel that they will lose friends, become unemployable, and get marked down in the classroom. What is your advice to young conservatives navigating these challenging times while trying to stay true to who they are? I think you have to approach each situation very differently. For friends, cut the friendships off that can’t handle you having a different opinion. It sounds a bit harsh, especially if you have a close relationship, but you will find out sooner or later that they weren’t a true friend if they can’t handle disagreement. And, if the Communist Left ever takes over, they’ll turn you into the government anyways! A friend who requires 24/7 agreement is just a gossiper waiting to talk about you. I’m lucky that I don’t have to worry about employment right now, so I would advise you to be wise but still exercise your First Amendment right. You must remember that we have our rights laid out in the Constitution— don’t let someone scare you out of your rights. The classroom can be a bit more difficult. I would encourage you to constantly challenge the professor in class but approach assignments from a non-biased perspective. Never bow to the mob! You’re a fashionista. How would you describe your style, and who is your style icon? I love “California grunge”— jeans and a designer shirt, “laid back,” sweatpants/baggy jeans and a crop top, and cool sneakers. If my style was a day, it would be “It’s 75 degrees and I’m going to grab an iced coffee, write my schedule for the next week, then take an insta pic at golden hour.” My style is extremely California-ish, and kind of always has been! Don’t necessarily have an icon. It’s been a journey of trial and error and seeing what looks best on my body. What’s your dream job? Do you see yourself going into politics? What can we expect from Christian Walker in the future? It’s changed so drastically in the last two months that it’s hard to say. But, I think at this point that without a doubt, it involves political commentary. I love it. I get to use my brain and unleash my personality. It’s the most fulfilling combination that I didn’t know existed for me and didn’t know I wanted. I don’t see myself running for any office because I’d rather yell about corrupt politicians and advise Americans on how not to let the Left turn us into a third world hell-hole! You can definitely expect to see me keep going, and going big at that.

                "title": "Florida Gators football - Wikipedia",
                "content": "The Florida Gators football program represents the University of Florida (UF) in American college football. Florida competes in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and the Southeastern Conference (SEC) They play their home games on Steve Spurrier-Florida Field at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium on the university's Gainesville campus. Florida's football program was established along with the university in 1906. It took on the \"Gators\" nickname in 1911, began playing in newly constructed Florida Field in 1930, and joined the Southeastern Conference as a founding member in 1932. On the field, the Gators found intermittent success during the first half of the 20th century, with a highlight being the 1928 squad that went 8–1 and led the nation in scoring. Florida football enjoyed its first sustained success in the 1960s under head coach Ray Graves. After having appeared in only two sanctioned bowl games up to that time, Grave's Gators won four during the decade, and quarterback Steve Spurrier became the school's first Heisman Trophy winner in 1966. Spurrier returned to his alma mater as the Gators' \"head ball coach\" in 1990, and the program has been among the top in college football since then. Since 1990, Florida has won three national championships (in 1996 under Spurrier and in 2006 and 2008 under Urban Meyer), eight conference titles, fifteen SEC East division titles, and sixteen bowl games, and Florida squads have finished the season ranked in the top-10 fifteen times. In addition, quarterbacks Danny Wuerffel and Tim Tebow won the Heisman in 1996 and 2007, respectively. The University of Florida was established in Gainesville in 1906 and fielded its first official varsity football team that fall. Since then, Florida Gator football squads have played in over 40 bowl games; won three national championships (1996, 2006 and 2008) and eight Southeastern Conference championships (1991, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 2000, 2006 and 2008) and have produced three Heisman Trophy winners, over 90 first-team All-Americans and 50 National Football League (NFL) first-round draft choices. Discounting interim coaches, there have been twenty-five head coaches in program history, including three who were inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame for their coaching success. Florida's first head coach was Pee Wee Forsythe, and the current coach is Billy Napier. Florida competed for its first several seasons as an independent before joining the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association in 1912. They moved to the Southern Conference in 1922, then joined with a dozen other schools to establish the Southeastern Conference (SEC) in 1932, where it has remained ever since. The SEC allowed considerable leeway with regard to conference schedules for several decades after its founded in 1932. Like most members, Florida played a few conference foes every season but would not play other schools for several years at a time until the conference attempted to balance schedules by establishing a rotation of sorts in the late 1960s. Schedules were further standardized in 1992 when the SEC expanded to twelve teams, established two divisions, and set eight team conference schedule plus a championship game between the two division winners. Florida was placed in the SEC Eastern Division and played every division foe every season. From 2012 until 2023, the Gators' annual conference slate consisted of Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri and Vanderbilt along with permanent Western Division opponent LSU plus another Western Division team on a rotating schedule. In 2024, the SEC expanded to 16 schools and abolished divisions, though it kept the eight game conference slate and retained most annual rivalries for at least one season as member schools worked to establish a new scheduling system.[3] Historically, Florida's key conference rivals include Georgia (played in Jacksonville usually around Halloween), Tennessee (historically played in mid-September), and LSU, though other conference rivalries have resulted in memorable games over the years. Florida has played in-state rival Florida State every year since 1958 except for the pandemic-altered 2020 season. The Gators and Seminoles have faced off around Thankgiving since the 1970s, and their emergence as perennial football powers during the 1990s helped build the Florida–Florida State rivalry into a game that often had national-title implications. In-state rival Miami was once another annual opponent. However, the rivalry was dropped when the SEC expanded its yearly schedule in the late 1980s, and the Florida–Miami rivalry has been renewed on an infrequent basis since then. The remaining dates on Florida's regular schedule are filled by non-conference opponents which vary from year to year. The University of Florida's campus did not include sports facilities when it opened in 1906, so UF's first several football and baseball squads played their home games at The Ballpark, a primitive municipal facility near downtown Gainesville. In 1911, the school purchased the bleachers from the city and moved them to University Athletic Field, a newly-cleared patch of land on the west side of campus along University Avenue. Larger bleachers were installed in 1915, when the facility was renamed Fleming Field.[4] The football program first gained national recognition in the late 1920s, prompting UF president John J. Tigert to initiate plans for a modern stadium. A shallow ravine just south of Fleming Field was the chosen site, and 20,000 seat Florida Field opened in 1930. The facility underwent major expansions in the mid-1960s, early 1980s, and early 1990s to increase stadium capacity to about 90,000, the largest in the state.[5] Its name was extended to \"Florida Field at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium\" in 1989 to honor UF benefactor Ben Hill Griffin, and the field was rechristened \"Steve Spurrier-Florida Field\" in 2016 to honor Gator player and coach Steve Spurrier. Spurrier also coined the stadium's nickname of \"The Swamp\" in 1992, early in his tenure as head football coach.[6] Florida's football program is a charter member of the Southeastern Conference, which began play in 1933. Before that, the Gators were affiliated with two different conferences after having founded the program without a conference affiliation.[7][8][9][10] The Florida Gators have been named national champions five times by NCAA-designated major selectors.[11] Florida claims three national championships, for the 1996, 2006 and 2008 seasons. At the end of each season the Gators were ranked No. 1 in both the final AP and Coaches polls and were recognized as consensus national champions after winning a designated national championship bowl game. Florida has been named national champion by NCAA-designated \"major selectors\" in two additional years, 1984 and 1985. Partially because the football program was on NCAA probation in the mid-1980s, the university has never claimed a share of the national championship for either season.[15] Florida has won eight officially recognized SEC football championships. The Gators won their first championship with a conference record of 5–0–1 in 1984, but the title was vacated several months after the season by the SEC university presidents because of NCAA infractions by the Florida coaching staff under Charley Pell. The 1985 and 1990 teams also finished atop the standings with conference records of 5–1 and 6–1, respectively, but Florida was ineligible for the championship due to its NCAA probation for rule violations by previous coaching staffs. The Gators won their first official SEC football championship in 1991.[16] With the addition of Arkansas and South Carolina to the Southeastern Conference in 1992, the conference split into eastern and western divisions and a game between the division winners determined the SEC champion. Florida has made thirteen appearances in the SEC Championship Game, most recently in 2020. The Gators have a 7–6 record all-time in SEC Championship Games as of 2020. With the additions of Texas and Oklahoma to the SEC in 2024, the conference eliminated divisions that year. †Florida tied with Georgia atop the SEC east during the 1992 season and played in the 1992 SEC Championship Game by virtue of its head-to-head victory. Florida, Georgia, and Tennessee ended the regular season in a 3-way tie in 2003, but Georgia advanced to the 2003 SEC Championship Game due to its higher BCS ranking. Florida and Georgia again tied atop the SEC East in 2012 but Georgia advanced to the 2012 SEC Championship Game by virtue of its head-to-head victory. Los Angeles Chargers – Assistant secondary coach(2023) FAU – Wide receivers (2022) New York Giants – Offensive Assistant (2021) South Carolina – Outside linebackers (2016–2021) Auburn – Defensive coordinator (2023) Florida has appeared in 49 NCAA-sanctioned bowl games, garnering a 24–24 record. This includes a streak of 22 consecutive bowl-game appearances from 1991 through 2012, the fifth-longest in college football history.[30] Four of their bowl games were for a National Championship, with two under the Bowl Alliance and two in the Bowl Championship Series. Florida is 3–1 in national championship games. † The 1912 Bacardi Bowl held in Havana, Cuba was not sanctioned by the NCAA and was intended to be one half of a two-game event which was not completed due to a dispute over the rules of the game. As such, the University of Florida Athletic Association does not include the contest in the Gators' official bowl record.[16] ‡ Coalition, Alliance, BCS or New Year's Six Bowl game. [failed verification] Florida's season records are from the record books of the university's athletic association. Through the end of the 2022 season, Florida has compiled an overall record of 784 wins, 469 losses, and 37 ties (including post-season bowl games).[60] Florida traditionally played SEC East opponents Kentucky, Tennessee, Vanderbilt, Missouri, Georgia, and South Carolina along with SEC West foe LSU on an annual basis. The other SEC West teams were played on a six-year rotation, with the added possibility of meeting in the SEC Championship Game. Beginning in the 2024 season, the SEC will abolish the east and west division format.[76] The University of Florida's athletic program operated with a limited budget for the first several years after its establishment in 1906. To reduce travel costs, early Florida football teams played limited slates of games, mostly against squads from nearby schools. Local scheduling resulted in the development of gridiron rivalries with several in-state private colleges, most notably Stetson, Florida Southern, and Rollins. Of those early opponents, Florida Southern and Rollins no longer sponsor intercollegiate football programs and, after dropping the sport for half a century, the Stetson Hatters compete in a lower division of college football. Florida also scheduled occasional games against teams organized by local athletic clubs or nearby military bases during the first half of the 20th century, particularly during the two world wars. However, the Gators have not played a non-collegiate squad since 1945.[60] In more modern times, Florida began an annual rivalry with the University of Miami Hurricanes in 1938 that continued uninterrupted until 1987. The teams have met on an occasional basis since then and are still considered rivals. Florida State (FSU) established a football program in 1947 and first faced Florida in 1958, beginning a series that was uninterrupted until the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 resulted in both schools playing conference-only schedules. The Gators have also scheduled occasional contests against several Florida schools with newer football programs, usually in Gainesville. All records accurate as of the conclusion of the 2021 season[60] Although the series started in 1916, many consider the rivalry between Florida and Alabama to have started in 1992, with the advent of the SEC Championship Game.[77] Florida has appeared in 13 of the 30 conference championship games with Alabama appearing in 14. 10 of those matches were against each other, the most common matchup so far. Alabama leads the conference championship match-up 6–4, following the most recent match-up between both programs, the 2020 SEC Championship Game, which saw Alabama beat Florida 52–46.[78] Alabama leads the series 28–14 since the end of the 2021 season.[79] Auburn and Florida played annually from 1945 to 2002.[63] In the overall series won-lost record, Auburn is Florida's most evenly-matched SEC opponent. Beginning in the 1980s, one team was usually highly ranked coming into the game and it had conference- and national-title implications.[80][81] The series has had several notable upsets. Auburn defeated previously-unbeaten Florida teams in 1993, 1994, 2001, 2006 and 2007, although the Gators won SEC championships in 1993, 1994 and 2006.[16] The annual series ended in 2002, when the SEC adjusted its football schedules so each team played one permanent and two rotating opponents from the opposite SEC division every year (instead of one rotating and two permanent teams).[82] When Texas A&M and Missouri joined the conference in 2012, the schedule was changed again; each team played one permanent and one rotating opponent from the opposite division every year. LSU was designated as Florida's annual SEC Western Division opponent, and Florida and Auburn play two regular-season games every 12 years. Auburn leads the series 43–39–2 through the 2023 season.[83] The University of Florida and the Florida State College for Women became co-educational in 1947.[84] The new Florida State Seminoles football team began playing small colleges, moving up to the major-college ranks in 1955.[85] Almost immediately, Florida State students and supporters called for the teams of Florida's two largest universities to play each other annually.[86] Contrary to popular belief, Florida's state legislature did not decree that Florida and Florida State should meet on the field; a bill mandating the game was rejected by the Florida Senate.[87] Prodding by Florida governor LeRoy Collins facilitated an agreement between the two universities to begin an annual series in 1958.[88] Due to Florida State's smaller stadium, the first six games were played at Florida Field. The series has alternated between the campuses since 1964, when Doak Campbell Stadium in Tallahassee was expanded.[89] The Florida–Florida State game has had national-championship implications since 1990, and both teams have entered the game with top-10 rankings thirteen times.[90] Among these was the Sugar Bowl rematch at the end of the 1996 season, when Florida avenged its only regular-season loss and won its first national championship 52–20.[91] Florida dominated the early series with a 16–2–1 record through 1976. Both teams have produced significant winning streaks, and the series is nearly tied over the past four decades; Florida State holds a 21–20–1 advantage since 1980. Since 2000, the teams share 10-10 records against one another. Florida leads the all-time series 37–28–2 through the 2023 season.[92] Historically, Florida's most hated and fierce rival has been the Georgia Bulldogs. Previously known as \"The World's Largest Outdoor Cocktail Party,\" and now most commonly called the \"Florida–Georgia game\" by Gator fans, this rivalry often decides the SEC East and has national implications.[93] The game is held at EverBank Stadium in Jacksonville, Florida, usually on the last Saturday in October or the first Saturday in November.[94] The designated \"home\" team alternates, with ticket distribution split evenly between the schools.[95] Since 2009, the Okefenokee Oar has been awarded to the winner of the Florida-Georgia game.[96] In the rivalry's early years, games rotated among locations in Savannah, Tampa, Jacksonville and, occasionally, Gainesville and Athens.[97] Since 1933 the game has been played in Jacksonville, except for 1994 and 1995 (when the teams played a pair of home-and-home games at their respective stadiums).[97] Georgia had early success in the rivalry, winning the first six games and holding a 21–5–1 series lead before 1950.[97] After the 2018 game Florida has won 21 out of the most-recent 29 games, and holds a 38–30–1 advantage in the series since 1950.[97] Georgia lead the series overall 56–44–2 through the 2024 season.[98] When the Southeastern Conference split into geographical divisions in 1992,[99] Florida and Kentucky were both placed in the SEC East. This guarantees that both teams play each other every season, which they have done consecutively since 1967. The Gators and Wildcats will meet in 2024 despite the end of SEC divisions after the 2023 season.[100] The two teams have played 74 times, with Florida holding a 53–21 lead in the series. From 1987 to 2017, Florida won every single game between the two schools. This 31-year streak was the third longest in FBS history, and the longest in the Southeastern Conference's history. Since 2017, the series has become incredibly competitive with a 4–3 split between the two teams with the winning margin being 11.4 points on average. Because of these factors, this rivalry is relatively new even though the series dates back to 1917. Former Florida head coach Steve Spurrier was notable for having a particular disdain for Kentucky. During his tenure at Florida, he was known for running up the score in non-competitive games. In his 12 years coaching the Gators, Spurrier never lost to Kentucky, winning by an average score of 32.7 points. Spurrier was famous for the comments he made about his opponents (often referred to as \"Spurrierisms\")[101][102] but he poked fun at Kentucky the most.[103] Even after leaving Florida, Steve Spurrier would go out of his way to make comments at Kentucky's expense. In November 2004, Steve Spurrier accepted the head coaching job at the University of South Carolina.[104][105] In 2006, the South Carolina Gamecocks upset their rival, the Clemson Tigers. In the following week, Clemson would go on to lose to Kentucky in the 2006 Music City Bowl. Following the bowl game, Steve Spurrier said\" \"We thought we had done something good beating Clemson. And then Kentucky beat 'em.\"[106] Florida and LSU first met on the football field in 1937, and have been annual opponents since 1971.[66] Since 1992, LSU has been Florida's permanent inter-divisional rival from the SEC Western Division. The winner of the Florida–LSU game went on to win the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) national championship game in the 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2019 seasons. This rivalry has been known recently for close games, with both teams highly ranked. Florida leads the all-time series 34–31–3 through the 2024 season. Three LSU wins were vacated in 2023.[107] Miami is Florida's only pre-World War II in-state rival that still plays major college football. The schools first met on the gridiron in 1938 and again every season until 1987, when the SEC's expansion of its conference schedule to seven games precluded the annual matchup.[108] A contract to renew the annual rivalry in the 1990s fell through when the SEC expanded its schedule again to eight games, and the Florida and Miami did not play again until the 2001 Sugar Bowl.[109] The home and home series briefly resumed in 2002 and 2003, and they played again in the 2004 Peach Bowl.[110] Since then, the schools have played intermittently during the regular season, with home and home series split across several years. Miami leads the series 30–27 through the 2024 season.[111] The next scheduled matchup between the schools will be in Miami Gardens on September 20, 2025. Although Florida and Tennessee are charter members of the SEC, irregular conference scheduling resulted in the teams meeting infrequently for many years. Tennessee won the first ten games between 1916 and 1954, when Florida finally defeated the Volunteers.[112] In 1969, Florida hired Tennessee head coach (and former Florida quarterback) Doug Dickey to replace the retiring Ray Graves immediately after their teams met in the Gator Bowl.[113] The rivalry reached a peak during the 1990s. In 1992, the SEC expanded to twelve schools and split into two divisions.[114][115] Florida and Tennessee (in the Eastern Division) have met every year since, usually in mid-September for both teams' first conference game of the season.[112] Led by coaches Steve Spurrier and Phillip Fulmer and featuring players such as Danny Wuerffel and Peyton Manning, both teams were regularly ranked in the top 10 when they met, giving the rivalry conference and national title implications. Florida and Tennessee combined to win six SEC titles and two national championships during the 1990s.[116] Since becoming annual opponents in 1992, the Gators and Volunteers have combined to represent the Eastern Division in the SEC Championship Game 16 times. Florida had an 11-game winning streak against Tennessee (2005–2015) and leads the series 31–20 following the 2021 season.[117] Thirteen people associated with Florida have been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame, four as head coaches and ten as players. Since Florida's first season in 1906, 89 players have received one or more selections as first-team All-Americans.[16] This includes 32 consensus All-Americans, of which six were unanimous.[150] The first Florida first-team All-American was end Dale Van Sickel, a member of the 1928 team.[151] Florida's first consensus All-American was quarterback Steve Spurrier, the winner of the Heisman Trophy for the 1966 Gators.[16][152] Since 1994, the Southeastern Conference has annually designated one former football player from each SEC member school as an \"SEC Legend.\" Through 2023, the following Gators have been named SEC Legends: The Fergie Ferguson Award is given in memory of one of the University of Florida's finest athletes, Forest K. Ferguson. Ferguson was an All-SEC end for Florida in 1941 and state boxing champion in 1942. Subsequently, a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army, he led an infantry platoon during the D-Day landings in Normandy on June 6, 1944.[153] Ferguson helped clear the way for his troops to advance on the Axis position, and was severely wounded leading his men in the assault.[153] A recipient of the Distinguished Service Cross for his actions,[153] he died from war-related injuries in 1954. The award, a trophy, is given to the senior football player who most displays \"leadership, character, and courage.\"[154] The University of Florida Athletic Association established the Florida Football Ring of Honor in 2006 to recognize the program's greatest players and coaches during the 100th year of Gator football. (The Gators do not have any retired jersey numbers. Although Steve Spurrier's (11) and Scot Brantley's (55) numbers were retired in the 1970s, Spurrier reissued them when he was Florida's head coach, and numbers worn by all members of the Ring of Honor are available for use by current players.)[155] Originally, members of the Ring of Honor had their jersey painted on the endzone facade at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium. When expanded video screens were installed in that location a few years later, inductees were each recognized with an 18-foot wide sign perched atop the north endzone grandstand.[156] Five honorees were inducted in 2006 and 2007, with Tim Tebow added in 2018.[157] To date, the only person who meets the Ring of Honor criteria and has not yet been inducted is two-time national championship winning former head coach Urban Meyer.[158] To be considered for induction into the Ring of Honor, a former player or coach must be absent from the university for five seasons, be in good standing, and meet at least one of the following criteria:[159] A Florida Football All-Time Team was compiled by the Florida Alumnus, the official publication of the Florida alumni, in 1927.[160] First team QB – Rammy Ramsdell HB – Dummy Taylor HB – Ed Jones FB – Bill Middlekauff E – Ferdinand H.

The most notable exception was a decade-long period from 1979 until 1989, when at the suggestion of coach Charlie Pell, the Gators switched to orange home jerseys.[163] For road games, Florida wears white jerseys with blue, orange, or white pants, depending on the colors of the opponent or the choice of the players that week. Steve Spurrier restored the home blue jerseys when he became the Gators' head ball coach in 1990.[164] From 1990 until 2014, Florida's primary home uniforms were blue jerseys with white pants, with blue pants an option for high-profile games, especially at night. Former coach Jim McElwain usually allowed his senior players to decide which uniform combination the team wore for each game. Since this practice began during the 2015 season, the Gators have worn many different combinations of blue or orange jerseys along with blue, orange, or white pants.[165][166] Florida has occasionally worn alternative uniforms, which are usually similar to current or former uniforms and used an orange and blue color scheme. One exception were the \"swamp green\" uniforms used at a home game against Texas A&M in October 2017. These used a dark green theme for the entire uniform from shoes to helmet that was inspired by the appearance of actual alligators. The uniform marked the 25th anniversary of former coach Steve Spurrier introducing the Swamp nickname for Florida Field.[167] For the first time in program history, Florida debuted an all black uniform on November 4th, 2023 in its contest against the Arkansas Razorbacks to honor members of the armed forces, veterans and local first responders. In lieu of their names, each player's nameplate displayed one of five words that are \"synonymous with the principles embodied by those who serve.\" The five words were Commitment, Courage, Excellence, Honor and Integrity. Florida has had a number of helmet designs, especially early in the program's history. Since the end of the leather helmet era, base colors have alternated between orange, white, and (occasionally) blue, and logos have included the “Gators” script font, an interlocking \"UF\", a simple \"F\", and the player number.[168] From 1979 until 2006, Florida wore orange helmets with a script \"Gators\" logo in all contests. To commemorate the 100th year of the football program in 2006, the Gators played one game wearing throwback uniforms modeled after their mid-1960s uniforms which included white helmets with a simple \"F\" logo.[169] In 2009 the Gators participated in Nike's Pro Combat uniform campaign, wearing specially-designed blue uniforms and white helmets with a slant-F logo.[170] These uniforms were worn for the last regular-season game against Florida State, and the white helmets were worn again the following week against Alabama in the SEC Championship Game with white jerseys and pants.[171] Florida introduced a different white alternative helmet in 2015 which featured the script \"Gators\" logo on one side and the slant-F logo on the other, and in 2018 replaced the slant-F with script \"Gators\" on both sides. In 2017, the Gators wore \"swamp green\" helmets for one game. These dark green helmets featured a color-altered Gator head logo on one side and the player's number in orange on the other. For the 2019 homecoming game versus Auburn, Florida wore the same mid-1960s throwback uniforms, including the white helmets with the blue \"F\" logo within an orange circular outline. The Gators wore the blue helmets for two games in 2020: the tweaked 1960s version with the orange \"F\" logo within an orange circular outline for their home game against Missouri, and the traditional version with the \"Gators\" script in orange font for their road game at Tennessee. The team wore the 1960s throwback uniforms again for their 2021 homecoming game versus Vanderbilt, but with orange helmets including the interlocking \"UF\" logo. To commemorate the 20th anniversary of the September 11 attacks, the Gators wore white helmets with the red, white, and blue American flag styled \"Gators\" script for their 2021 road contest at the University of South Florida. From 1992 to 2023, Florida played in the East Division of the SEC and played each opponent in the division each year along with several teams from the West Division. The SEC will expand the conference to 16 teams and will eliminate its two divisions in 2024, causing a new scheduling format for the Gators to play against the other members of the conference.[172] Only the 2024 conference schedule was announced on June 14, 2023, while the conference still considers a new format for the future.[173] Florida has played a continuous series against in-state rival Florida State (FSU) since 1958. While the eight game SEC slate plus the annual matchup with FSU are set years in advance, the schedule allows for two or three additional non-conference games against various opponents that are usually played in Gainesville for revenue purposes. In recent years, Florida has been also invited to participate in several season opening non-conference neutral-site games which do not count against the NCAA cap on regular season games. Announced opponents and dates are as of August 4, 2024.[174]",

                "content": "The Florida Gators are the intercollegiate athletic teams that represent the University of Florida, located in Gainesville. The University of Florida, its athletic program, its alumni and its sports fans are often collectively referred to as the \"Gator Nation.\" The Gators compete in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and the Southeastern Conference (SEC) and are consistently ranked among the top college sports programs in the United States. The University of Florida currently fields teams in nine men's sports and twelve women's sports.[2] All Florida Gators sports teams compete in NCAA Division I,[3] and 20 of the 21 Gators teams compete in the SEC.[4] The sole University of Florida sports team that does not play in the SEC is the women's lacrosse team, which plays a sport the SEC has never sponsored. That team joined the Big 12 Conference in 2024 in advance of that conference's first women's lacrosse season in spring 2025.[5] The Gators joined the Big 12 after having been a single-sport member of the American Athletic Conference since the 2019 lacrosse season.[6] The University of Florida was one of the thirteen charter members who joined to form the new Southeastern Conference in 1932.[7] Previously, the university was a member of the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association from 1912 to 1921[8] and the Southern Conference from 1922 until the SEC began play in the fall of 1933.[9] All Florida Gators sports teams have on-campus facilities, and most are located on or near Stadium Road on the north side of campus, including Steve Spurrier-Florida Field at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium for football;[10] the Exactech Arena at the Stephen C. O'Connell Center for basketball,[11][12] gymnastics,[13] swimming and diving,[14] indoor track and field,[15] and volleyball;[16] and James G. Pressly Stadium for outdoor track and field.[17] The Katie Seashole Pressly Softball Stadium, the Condron Ballpark, and the Donald R. Dizney Stadium for soccer[18] and lacrosse are located on Hull Road on the southwestern side of the campus.[19][20][21] The Mark Bostick Golf Course and Scott Linder Stadium for tennis are located on S.W. Second Avenue on the northwestern side of the campus.[22][23][24] The Florida Gators athletic program is administered by the University Athletic Association, Inc. (UAA), a private non-profit corporation that reports to the president of the university and its board of trustees.[25] For the 2014–15 school year, the UAA had an operating budget of $103,310,001, projected revenues of $104,064,487, and made a $3.5 million contribution to the university's general fund.[26] Scott Stricklin has been Florida's athletic director since 2016. Beginning in the early 1990s, the Florida Gators has been recognized as one of the premier athletic programs in the Southeastern Conference (SEC) and one of the best in the nation. The SEC has awarded an All-Sports Trophy to the best overall sports program in the conference since 1984, and Florida has won the award 28 times as of 2023. Florida is the only school in the SEC and one of four schools nationally to have won a national championship in the football, men's basketball, and baseball. Every year since 1993, the National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics (NACDA) has recognized the Gators athletic program as one of the ten best overall Division I athletic programs in the country in its annual NACDA Directors' Cup standings, including as runners-up on four occasions.[27] The men's athletic program was also the winner of the 2010–11 and 2011–12 Capital One Cup; the women's athletic program won the Capital One Cup in 2013–14, and both programs have placed in the top five in the standings on several other occasions. Among the Gators' recent national championships, the Florida Gators men's basketball team won the 2006 and 2007 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournaments, and the Florida Gators football team won 2007 BCS National Championship Game in football, all in the span of 366 days.[28] Florida is the only school in NCAA Division I history to hold the outright men's basketball and football championships during the same school year. In January 2009, the Gators football team won the 2009 BCS National Championship Game with a 24–14 victory over the Oklahoma Sooners.[29] The Florida Gators baseball team took home its first championship at the 2017 NCAA championship, defeating rival SEC foe the LSU Tigers in two games. The Gators won the NCAA men's indoor track and field championship in three consecutive seasons in 2010, 2011 and 2012,[30] the NCAA women's swimming and diving team national championship in 2010,[31][32] the NCAA women's tennis championship in 2011, 2012 and 2017,[33] the NCAA men's outdoor track and field championship in 2012, 2013 and 2016, the NCAA women's gymnastics championship in 2013, 2014 and 2015, and the NCAA softball championships in 2014 and 2015.[34] Individual Gator athletes have won 279 individual NCAA championships in boxing, golf, gymnastics, swimming and diving, tennis, and track and field. In 2017, Florida won the baseball national championship for the first time. The Gators swept LSU in the best of three national title series. This earned the university a total of 39 national team championships. Additionally, this put the University of Florida in exclusive company. With the 2017 baseball national championship, Florida became only the fourth school in history to win national championships in football, men's basketball, and baseball. Florida, along with Michigan, Ohio State, and UCLA are the only schools to ever achieve triple crown status. This also put Florida in a category by itself. Florida is the only Southeastern Conference school to accomplish this feat, as well, Florida is the only school in history to have achieved triple crown status in such a short span of time. Florida's first national championships in each of the big three sports (football, men's basketball, and baseball) were won in the span of just 21 years.[35] The University of Florida has been ranked among the nation's top ten NCAA Division I athletic programs every year since 1983–84, an overall ranking that includes both men's and women's sports – the only college sports program ranked in the top ten in the United States for the last 39 consecutive years.[36] The National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics (NACDA) has recognized the University of Florida as ranking among the top seven Division I programs in its NACDA Directors' Cup standings every year since the NACDA and USA Today began awarding the cup in 1993–94. The 2022–23 academic year marked the Gators' 39th consecutive year ranked among the nation's top ten best overall collegiate athletic programs, and the twenty-second consecutive year ranked among the top seven Division I programs in the NACDA Directors' Cup standings.[27] Only one other Division I athletic program has matched that feat, and Florida has achieved this record while fielding fewer sports teams than many of the other perennially top-ranked collegiate athletic programs.[27] In the 29 years of the NACDA Directors' Cup, the Gators have finished fifth or better in 22 years, and have never finished lower than seventh; the only other program ranked among the top ten Division I programs every year since 1993–94 is the Stanford Cardinal sports program of Stanford University. NCAA Division I all-sports rankings[27] Through the end of the 2022–23 school year, the Florida Gators have won 261 Southeastern Conference (SEC) team championships, the most in conference history.[37][38] The SEC All-Sports Trophy began in 1973 as the Bernie Moore Trophy and tabulated the league's best men's sports program.[39] In 1983, the SEC also began recognizing the best women's sports program in the conference, as well as the best overall SEC sports program.[40] In 1994, the New York Times Regional Newspaper Group assumed responsibility for awarding the trophies.[41] In the 50-year history of the awards, Florida has won 24 women's trophies, 22 men's trophies, and 28 overall SEC All-Sports trophies.[41] SEC rival Georgia won the overall 2005–06 All-Sports Trophy to snap Florida's record streak at fourteen straight (1990–91 through 2004–05).[41] Florida reclaimed the SEC All-Sports Trophy for the 2006–07 school year, and the Gators have held on to the overall all-sports trophies in every year until Texas A&M ended their streak in 2018–19.[41] The Gators are the first of two SEC sports programs to earn the overall, men's, and women's all-sports trophies in a single year (the other being Tennessee in the 2022–23 season), and have swept all three trophies sixteen times.[41] In their history of intercollegiate competition, the University of Florida's varsity athletic teams have won 48 national championships (including 42 sponsored by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), two by the Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW), two by the Bowl Championship Series (BCS), and one by the Bowl Alliance).[35][42][43] Florida is one of only two Division I schools to hold both major men's championships (football and men's basketball) at the same time (as the 2006 BCS football champions and the 2006 and 2007 NCAA men's basketball champions), and was the first to do so.[b][44] Men's national championships (26) Women's national championships (22) All of the national championships listed above were sponsored by the NCAA other than football in 1996 (Bowl Alliance), football in 2006 and 2008 (BCS), women's gymnastics in 1982 (AIAW), and women's swimming and diving in 1979 (AIAW).[54] Athletes at UF have won 353 individual and relay NCAA national championships.[54][55] Men's individual and relay championships (157) Women's individual and relay championships (196) The University of Florida is a founding member of the Southeastern Conference (SEC), one of the nation's premier intercollegiate sports conferences, and 20 of the 21 Gators sports teams compete in the SEC. Since the SEC began play in 1933, Florida's varsity athletic teams have won 261 SEC team championships, more than any other conference member.[38][56] The women's lacrosse team played its first four seasons in the now-defunct American Lacrosse Conference (ALC), followed by four seasons in the Big East Conference and six in the American Athletic Conference before joining the Big 12 Conference for the 2025 season (2024–25 school year) and beyond. All of Florida's conference championships are from the SEC unless otherwise stated. Men's conference championships Women's conference championships † Wrestling is no longer offered at the varsity level at UF since 1979. For purposes of counting \"official\" SEC team championships in baseball, men's and women's basketball, soccer, softball, men's and women's tennis, and volleyball, the SEC currently only includes regular season team championships, not tournament championships. The Gators have won an additional 66 SEC tournament titles in these sports which are not included in Florida's total of 261 SEC team championships. [77] Coach Andy Lopez took over the Gators baseball program in 1994, one season after leading the Pepperdine Waves to their first College World Series championship. In 1996, he coached the Gators to a fifty-win season and a College World Series bid. By 2000, the program had seemingly hit a plateau and Lopez was replaced. Pat McMahon became the Gators' head coach in 2001 after coaching the Mississippi State Bulldogs. The Gators' 2005 baseball season was the most successful to date, with the team winning the SEC title, and earning a place in the College World Series for the fifth time in school history. The team advanced to the championship round against the Texas Longhorns, ultimately losing two games to none. Following their 2005 College World Series run, the Gators opened the 2006 season ranked number one in the polls, but struggled to finish 28–28 record (10–20 SEC), and failed to qualify for the NCAA Regionals. After missing the NCAA Regionals again in 2007, McMahon was dismissed.[78] Former Clemson Tigers associate head coach Kevin O'Sullivan became the Gators' new head baseball coach on June 13, 2007.[79] O'Sullivan's Gator teams showed immediate improvement and the Gators finished the 2008 regular season with a 30–24 record (17–13 SEC), and received an invitation to the NCAA Regional in Tallahassee. The 2009 squad finished the regular season with a 38–18 record (19–11 SEC), won the NCAA Regional in Gainesville, and advanced to the Super Regional before losing to the Southern Mississippi Golden Eagles. O'Sullivan's 2010 and 2011 Gators finished their SEC regular season play with identical 22–8 records, won the program's eleventh and twelfth SEC championships, earned a berth in the College World Series in both years, and advanced to the College World Series final in 2011 before getting swept by SEC foe South Carolina in two games. The Gators returned to the College World Series in 2012, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2023, and 2024. In June 2017, Florida won their first College World Series championship, sweeping fellow SEC rival LSU in two games in the best-of-three finals.[80] In the CWS championship rematch six years later, the Gators, though they set a new program record with 54 wins, lose to the Tigers in three games. Since 2021, the Gators baseball team plays its home games at Condron Ballpark at Alfred A. McKethan Field.[20] Florida enjoyed limited success in men's basketball before the mid-1980s. Coach Norm Sloan's Gators were invited to the National Invitation tournament (NIT)—only the second time the team had been invited to a post-season tournament. They returned to the NIT in 1985 and 1986, and made their first appearance in the NCAA basketball tournament in 1987, when guard Vernon Maxwell led the team to the NCAA Sweet Sixteen. The Gators received invitations to the NCAA tournament in 1988 and 1989, but Sloan was forced to resign at the outset of the 1989–90 season as a result of NCAA infractions. Coach Lon Kruger brought renewed success, and his Gators reached the NIT final four in 1991–92. During the 1993–94 season, Andrew DeClercq and Dametri Hill led the Gators to their first NCAA tournament Final Four following a dramatic overtime victory over the Connecticut Huskies in the NCAA regional semifinal, and a 74–66 win over Boston College in the NCAA Regional Final. Athletic Director Jeremy Foley hired Billy Donovan as Kruger's replacement in 1996. Donovan's recruiting prowess was evident early, as he landed recruiting classes with future NBA players Mike Miller, Udonis Haslem and Matt Bonner. Donovan's Gators advanced to the NCAA tournament final before losing to the Michigan State Spartans in 2000, and demonstrated a consistency previously unknown to the program as they received invitations to the NCAA tournament every year from 1999 through 2007, a team-record eight-year streak. Under Donovan, Florida won its first SEC men's basketball tournament in 2005, when they beat the Kentucky Wildcats in the SEC title game. The 2005–06 team's 17–0 start was the best in team history, surprising many with a young, selfless squad led by four sophomores. The team began the season unranked, but won its second consecutive SEC Tournament championship. On April 3, 2006, the Gators defeated the UCLA Bruins 73–57 in the NCAA tournament championship game to win Florida's first men's national basketball championship. Within days, all five starters announced they would return for another season to try to win back-to-back championships. At the outset of the 2006–07 season, the Gators were ranked No. 1 in both major polls for the first time. The Gators won their second consecutive NCAA national men's basketball championship on April 2, 2007, defeating the Ohio State Buckeyes 84–75. They became the first team since Duke in 1991–92 to win back-to-back tournaments and the first in NCAA history to do so with the same starting line-up. Afterward, Florida's four-star juniors—Joakim Noah, Al Horford, Taurean Green, and Corey Brewer—announced their decision to enter the NBA draft.[81] Donovan's Gators returned to championship form in 2010–11, winning the program's fifth regular season SEC championship and fighting their way to the NCAA regional semifinals (the \"Elite Eight\") before losing 74–71 to the Butler Bulldogs in overtime. In 2011–12, the Gators received a No. 7 seed in the NCAA tournament, exceeded expectations, and advanced to the Elite Eight, headlined by the play of star freshman Bradley Beal and point guard Erving Walker, before falling to Louisville. During the 2013–14 season, the Gators were ranked No. 1 in the nation, won the SEC championship with 36 straight wins during the regular season and tournament games, went on a school-record 30 game winning streak, and advanced to the NCAA Final Four, headlined by the play of four senior veterans: Patric Young, Scottie Wilbekin, Will Yeguete and Casey Prather. The Gators men's basketball team is currently led by coach Todd Golden and plays its home games in the O'Connell Center.[11] Women's basketball was approved as a new women's varsity sport by Florida in March 1972, but began play in 1973 as a club team. In 1975, the Lady Gators debuted as a varsity program under head coach Dr. Paula Welch. The Gators made local headlines in 1976 by winning the \"state championship\", beating the other three women's college teams located in the state at that time.[82] While traditionally being overshadowed by conference and national basketball powers Tennessee and Georgia, the Lady Gators have made several NCAA tournament appearances and sent players to the WNBA, including DeLisha Milton-Jones. Carol Ross compiled more wins than any other women's basketball coach in Florida's history, and guided the team for twelve seasons from 1991 to 2003, but left to accept the head coaching job at her alma mater, Ole Miss. From 2002 through 2006, the women's basketball team was coached by Carolyn Peck, a former WNBA coach who won a national title with Purdue. Peck was fired midway through the 2006 season (though allowed to finish the season) after enduring the worst losing streak of any Gator sport. Former Gator player and previous Charlotte coach Amanda Butler was named the new women's basketball coach on April 13, 2007. During the 2008–09 season, the Lady Gators received an NCAA tournament bid, and won a first-round game before being defeated by eventual tournament champion Connecticut in the second round. Butler resigned after the 2016–17 season. The Gators women's basketball team is currently coached by Kelly Rae Finley, and plays its home games in the O'Connell Center.[12] The Florida Gators men's cross country team has won three Southeastern Conference championships (SEC), and has competed in eight National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) tournaments. The women's cross country team has also won five SEC Championships (including the most recent), and competed in ten NCAA tournaments. In 2009, the Lady Gators placed seventh at the NCAA cross country championship; in 2010, they won the SEC championship for the second consecutive year. Coach Mike Holloway is the head coach of the men's and women's cross country teams. The University of Florida fielded an official varsity football team for the first time in 1906, defeating the Gainesville Athletic Club 6–0 in its first game. Since then, the Gators have played in thirty-seven bowl games, won three national championships (1996, 2006, 2008) and eight Southeastern Conference championships, and produced 138 All-Americans, forty-two National Football League (NFL) first-round draft choices and three Heisman Trophy winners. The Gators' most prominent current football rivals are SEC Eastern Division foes Georgia and Tennessee, annual SEC Western Division opponent LSU, and in-state rival Florida State from the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). Florida has historically shared rivalries with Auburn and Miami, too, but those games are no longer played annually and have lessened in intensity. Since 1990, when Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Steve Spurrier returned to his alma mater as head coach, the Gator football team has won more games than any other program in the NCAA's Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS).[83] The 1996 team, coached by Spurrier and led by another Gator Heisman-winner, Danny Wuerffel, finished with a 12–1 record and won the national championship in the Sugar Bowl, beating rival Florida State 52–20. This win was not without controversy from FSU fans who thought they should not have had to play Florida again. FSU won in the regular season match up 24–21. Urban Meyer became Florida's head football coach in December 2004, and his six teams had great success from 2005 to 2010. The 2006 team won the school's second national championship on January 8, 2007, defeating the number one-ranked Ohio State Buckeyes 41–14. Quarterback Tim Tebow won the Heisman Trophy in 2007, and Florida's Tebow-led 2008 team won the 2009 BCS National Championship Game on January 8, 2009, beating the top-ranked Oklahoma Sooners 24–14, for the Gators' third national championship. The Gators have won the SEC Championship Game seven times in eleven appearances since the SEC instituted the championship game in 1992. The Gators won their first official conference title in 1991, the year before the first SEC conference championship game was played, for a total of eight SEC championships in the last twenty-four seasons. The Gators football team plays its home games in Steve Spurrier-Florida Field at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium, more popularly known as The Swamp, the team's home field since 1930.[10] Billy Napier is the current head coach of the Florida Gators football. The men's golf team has won five NCAA Championships (1968, 1973, 1993, 2001, 2023), and has produced three individual NCAA champions, Bob Murphy in 1966, Nick Gilliam in 2001, and Fred Biondi in 2023. The men's golf team has also won sixteen Southeastern Conference (SEC) championships: 1955–56, 1968, 1973–75, 1985, 1989, 1991–94, 1999, 2003, 2011, 2023. Numerous former Gator golfers have represented the University of Florida on the PGA Tour, and the program has produced over thirty male athletes who have competed professionally. Buddy Alexander, the long-time head coach for the men's golf team, retired after the 2013–14 season. J. C. Deacon was hired in June 2014, and the 2022–23 season was his ninth. The Gators men's golf team plays its home matches at the Mark Bostick Golf Course (formerly known as the \"University Golf Course\").[22] The women's golf team has won two NCAA team championships (1985, 1986), and has produced one individual NCAA champion, Page Dunlap. The women's golf team has also won eight Southeastern Conference (SEC) championships. Former Lady Gator golfers have regularly represented the University of Florida on the LPGA Tour, and the program has produced over twenty female athletes who have competed in the professional ranks. Emily Glaser is the head coach for the women's team. The Gators women's golf team plays its home matches at the Mark Bostick Golf Course (formerly known as the \"University Golf Course\").[22] Gymnastics was one of the first women's sports added at the University of Florida and achieved early success by winning the 1982 AIAW national championship. Since the NCAA assumed sponsorship of the national gymnastics championships in 1982, Florida has typically earned invitations to the NCAA national championships (top twelve teams nationally), and advanced to the NCAA \"Super Six\" eighteen times. Florida won the 2013, 2014 and 2015 NCAA national championships, finished in second-place in 1998 and 2012, and the team has only failed to qualify for the NCAA championships once in the past thirty-three seasons. The Gators have won a total of nine SEC gymnastics championships since 1982. The team's biggest SEC rivals are Alabama and Georgia, both of which are also perennial national contenders. Coach Rhonda Faehn's Gator gymnasts were the SEC champions in both 2012 and 2013, and won the NCAA national team championships in 2013, 2014 and 2015 (the 2014 was as co-champions with Oklahoma). Faehn coached the Gators gymnastics team from 2003 to 2015. Under Faehn, the Gator gymnasts have been nationally competitive and remarkably consistent—finishing in the top seven every year and winning three NCAA national championships. The Gators gymnastics team is now coached by Jenny Rowland. The Gators hold their home meets at the O'Connell Center.[13] In June 2006, the University Athletic Association announced the creation of the new Gators women's lacrosse program, citing the growth of high school lacrosse across the country and the increased availability of Division I competition. Florida became the second Southeastern Conference member university to offer lacrosse as a varsity sport, following Vanderbilt University,[84] and played its inaugural 2010 season in the American Lacrosse Conference (ALC) together with the Commodores. The Gators and Commodores continued to play in the ALC until conference realignment led to the demise of the ALC following the 2014 season, after which both programs became single-sport members of the Big East Conference.[85] The Gators and Commodores played in the Big East through the 2018 season, after which they became charter members of the new women's lacrosse league of the American Athletic Conference (The American).[86] After the 2024 season, the Gators left The American to become inaugural members of Big 12 Conference women's lacrosse.[5] The lacrosse team is the only Gators team that does not compete in the SEC. The Gators lacrosse team has had success from its establishment, including four ALC regular-season championships (2011–2014); two ALC tournament titles (2012, 2014); both regular-season and tournament titles in all of its four Big East seasons (2015–2018); the regular-season and tournament championships in four of its five completed seasons[c] as a member of The American (2019, 2021, 2022, 2024); seven appearances in the NCAA tournament national quarterfinals (\"Elite Eight\"); and two appearances in the NCAA tournament national semifinals (\"Final Four\") in 2012 and 2024. The Gators have been ranked among the top ten women's lacrosse teams in the country each of the last five seasons, and have been ranked as high as No. 1.[citation needed] Amanda O'Leary is the Gators' head coach. Before she was named to jump-start Florida's new program, O'Leary was the head coach at Yale University for 14 seasons, and was honored as a two-time All-American midfielder at Temple University, where she led her team to an NCAA championship in 1988. In only the second season of the Gators lacrosse program, the mostly-sophomores team defeated the defending ALC champion Northwestern Wildcats to win their first regular season conference championship.[87] The Gators completed a perfect 5–0 season three days later by defeating the Vanderbilt Commodores in Nashville.[88] The Gators women's lacrosse team plays its home games in the 1,500-seat Donald R. Dizney Stadium.[21] Becky Burleigh was hired to be the first head coach since the women's soccer team began play a varsity sport in 1995. Under Burleigh's leadership, the team quickly became a national contender. In 1998, in the program's fourth season, the Gators won their only NCAA national championship by defeating the defending national champion North Carolina Tar Heels 1–0 in the national finals of the NCAA tournament. The women's soccer team has also won thirteen Southeastern Conference regular season championships and ten SEC tournament titles in its eighteen seasons of play.[89] In 2021, Burleigh retired as women's soccer coach. Notable former Gator soccer players include Abby Wambach, who was a member of the U.S. women's national team and scored the game-winning goal in the final game of the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, Greece; Heather Mitts, who played for the gold medal U.S. national team in the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, China; Melanie Booth, who currently plays for the Canadian women's national soccer team; and Danielle Fotopoulos, who played professionally with the Carolina Courage. Savannah Jordan plays for the Portland Thorns and ranks second in Gators history behind Wambach for goals scored.[90] The Gators women's soccer team is coached by Samantha Bohon and rotates most of its home games between James G. Pressly Stadium and Donald R. Dizney Stadium.[91] The University Athletic Association decided to create the women's varsity softball program in 1995, and the Florida Gators softball team officially started competing in the Southeastern Conference in 1997 under former head coach Larry Ray. Since the beginning of the program, the Florida Gators have had several notable successes, including four SEC championships, 12 appearances in the Women's College World Series (2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2022, and 2024), and back-to-back WCWS national championships (2014 & 2015).[92] The Gators won nine SEC regular season championships (1998, 2008, 2009, 2013, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2021), as well as six SEC tournament titles (2008, 2009, 2013, 2018, 2019, and 2024). In 2009, they played for the NCAA softball championship in the Women's College World Series, losing to the Washington Huskies in the final round. The Gators again advanced to the finals of the 2011 Women's College World Series before falling to the Arizona State Sun Devils. In 2014, the Gators defeated the Alabama Crimson Tide in the first two games of the three-game Women's College World Series to win their first NCAA national championship. In 2015, the Gators repeated as national champions by defeating the Michigan Wolverines in the full three games. The Gators would return to the WCWS finals in 2017 before losing to the Oklahoma Sooners in two games. The current head coach is Tim Walton; the 2023–2024 season was his 18th as the Gators' coach.[93] He was previously the head coach at Wichita State University and he played baseball for the University of Oklahoma and a minor league team affiliated with the Philadelphia Phillies.[93] Through the end of the 2023 season, Walton has acquired a 926–223 (.806) record, while at Florida.[93] Following the conclusion of the 2018 season, Walton was given a 10-year contract extension. The Gators softball team plays its home games at the Katie Seashole Pressly Softball Stadium.[19] The Florida Gators men's swimming and diving teams have won NCAA national championships in 1983 and 1984, and has also won 41 Southeastern Conference team championships – including a stretch of 13 straight from 1956 to 1968.[94] The women's swimming and diving team has won AIAW and NCAA national championships in 1979, 1982 and 2010, and has also won seventeen SEC team championships.[94] The Florida Gators' notable female swimmers include three-time Olympic gold medalist Tracy Caulkins, three-time Olympic gold medalist Nicole Haislett, and four-time Olympic gold medalist Dara Torres, who is also the first American swimmer to compete in five Olympic Games. The Gators' notable male swimmers include Olympic gold medalists Matt Cetlinski, Mike Heath, David Larson, Ryan Lochte, Caeleb Dressel, Anthony Nesty and Martin Zubero. The Gators have had an international flavor since the 1980s, when the Olympic success of Gator swimmers began to attract Canadian, European and Latin American swimmers to train under coach Randy Reese. That tradition continues in the present day under Gregg Troy, the head coach of the Gators men's and women's swimming teams. Troy served as the head coach of the U.S. Olympic men's swim team in 2012. Dale Schultz is the new head coach of the men's and women's diving teams, succeeding long-time coach Donnie Craine in 2014. The Gators swimming and diving teams hold their home meets at the O'Connell Center Natatorium and train in the Carse Swimming Complex. The Florida Gators have one of the strongest and most storied women's tennis programs in NCAA history, and the women's tennis team has won seven NCAA team championships (1992, 1996, 1998, 2003, 2011, 2012, 2017).[95] The team has also produced three individual Gators who have won four NCAA singles championships: Shaun Stafford (1988), Lisa Raymond (1992, 1993), and Jill Craybas (1996).[95] In NCAA championship doubles play, four Gators doubles pairs have won five NCAA doubles championships: Jillian Alexander and Nicole Arendt (1991); Dawn Buth and Stephanie Nickitas (1996, 1997); Whitney Laiho and Jessica Lehnhoff (2001); and Brooke Austin and Kourtney Keegan (2016).[95] The Gator women have also won seven Intercollegiate Tennis Association (ITA) national indoor championships (1988, 1991, 1992, 1996, 1997, 1999, 2017),[96] and twenty-nine SEC team championships.[95] The Gators have also claimed six SEC Tournament titles (1994, 2000, 2005, 2011, 2016, and 2022) in Men's Tennis and 20 in Women's Tennis (1982, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2016). The Gators men's tennis team has a winning tradition and has won 12 Southeastern Conference team championships as of 2022.[97] In 2021, the men's tennis program won its first-ever NCAA team championship. The Gator men have also produced four NCAA singles champions: Mark Merklein (1993), Jeff Morrison (1999), Sam Riffice (2021), and Ben Shelton (2022). Merklein and partner David Blair combined to win an NCAA doubles championship (1994).[97][98] Adam Steinberg is the head coach of the men's tennis team, and coach Roland Thornqvist leads the women's tennis team.[95][97] The Florida Gators tennis teams play their home matches at Linder Stadium at the Ring Tennis Complex on the university's campus.[99] The Florida Gators men's track and field team has won six Southeastern Conference indoor championships, and four SEC outdoor championships. After finishing as the runner-up in both the NCAA indoor and outdoor meets in 2009, the men's team went on to win three consecutive NCAA indoor titles (2010-2012) and its first NCAA outdoor title (2012) over the next three years. The men's team then went on their own \"three-peat\" of NCAA outdoor titles in 2022, 2023, and 2024. The women's track and field team won the NCAA indoor championships in 1992 and 2022. The women's team won its first NCAA outdoor title in 2022. In addition, the women's team has won six SEC indoor championships, and four SEC outdoor championships. The head coach for the track and field program is Mike Holloway, and he is responsible for both the men's and women's teams. The assistant coaches are Steve Lemke, Adrain Mann, Nic Petersen, Chris Solinsky, & Mellanee Welty. The Gators men's and women's track and field teams hold their outdoor home meets at Percy Beard Track, which is part of James G. Pressly Stadium.[17] The Gators began competing in women's volleyball in 1984 under coach Marilyn McReavy, but did not become nationally competitive until coach Mary Wise assumed control of Florida's program in 1991. During her 30 seasons as Florida's head coach, Wise has compiled a 979–168 win–loss record (.854), and her Gators teams have won nineteen SEC regular season titles and twelve SEC Tournament titles in her twenty seasons. The Gators have made nineteen trips to the NCAA tournament, including eight NCAA Final Four appearances (1992, 1993, 1996, 1997, 1998, 2002, 2003, 2017). In 2003 and 2017, they advanced to the NCAA national championship final, where they lost to the USC Trojans and Nebraska Cornhuskers, respectively. Florida landed the nation's top 2008 recruiting class, as ranked by Prepvolleyball.com and Volleyball Magazine, and signed the nation's top recruit and Gatorade National Player of the Year, Kelly Murphy, as well as four other recruits ranked among the top fifty.[100] Murphy garnered First-Team All SEC and a spot on the SEC All-Freshman Team with fellow Gators Colleen Ward and Kristy Jaeckel. Murphy would also gain the SEC Freshman of the Year, AVCA All-South Region Freshman of the Year, the AVCA National Freshman of the Year, and Volleyball Magazine's Freshman of the Year. She was also honored as an AVCA Third-Team All-American and a Volleyball Magazine Second-Team All-American. The Gators volleyball team plays its home matches in the O'Connell Center.[16] In the past, the Florida Gators fielded varsity teams in men's boxing and men's wrestling. Gator boxer John Joca, a \"Gator Great\" member of the University of Florida Athletic Hall of Fame,[101] won the NCAA national boxing championship in the 135-pound weight class in 1940.[102][103] The Gators boxing team, however, was discontinued in 1943 during World War II, and was never revived after the war.[103] The Gators men's wrestling team was an SEC-sponsored sport from 1970 to 1979; the team won the 1975 SEC championship tournament and placed second during four other seasons. The wrestling team was eliminated as a result of cost-cutting and Title IX compliance issues in 1979.[104] The University Athletic Association, under athletic director Ray Graves and associate director Ruth Alexander, desired to take a proactive role in Title IX compliance by balancing the number of available men's and women's athletic scholarships, and the resulting tight athletic budgets ultimately resulted in the elimination of men's wrestling program. The University of Florida has invested significant capital and effort in the construction, expansion and betterment of its major sports facilities, including the following outdoor stadiums, indoor arenas, and training and practice facilities: The University of Florida began its sports program soon after it was established in Gainesville in 1906, and its teams adopted orange and blue as their official colors soon thereafter. These colors are a probably a combination of the colors of the two primary institutions that merged to form the university, as the East Florida Seminary used orange and black and the Florida Agricultural College used blue and white.[107] As with the school colors, the exact origin of the alligator (almost always shortened to \"gator\") as the school mascot is not well documented. It likely originated in 1908, when Gainesville merchant Phillip Miller chose the animal to adorn pennants he designed for sale to students. The school did not yet have a mascot, and Miller chose the alligator because it is native to Florida and was not claimed by any other school.[108] The football team subsequently adopted the \"Gators\" nickname in 1911.[109] There are two theories as how the name become synonymous with the university's athletic programs. One theory is that the 1911 football squad began calling themselves the Gators in honor of team captain Neal \"Bo Gator\" Storter. Storter himself refuted this explanation, saying that it originated when a sportswriter in South Carolina described Florida's 1911 road upset of Clemson as an \"invasion of alligators from Florida\" and the players adopted the name.[110] Whatever its origins, the nickname \"Gators\" (and for a time, \"Lady Gators\" for women's sports) has been used by the University of Florida's athletic program for over a century. Albert and Alberta are the official costumed mascots of the Florida Gators.[111] Many variations of Albert have been present at sporting events over the decades, and a live alligator was used for many years. The current version of Albert was introduced in the early 1980s, and Alberta joined him in 1984. They are unique among the SEC's mascots as the only male-and-female pair, and are featured together in a life-sized statue outside of UF's Alumni Affairs Building.[112] The University of Florida's marching band is known as \"The Pride of the Sunshine\", and plays at every home football game, and also performs at various events such as Gator Growl and parades. Florida's fight song is The Orange and Blue. The Gatorettes are the baton-twirlers, or majorettes, for the marching band.[113] The University of Florida dance team that performs at home basketball games and other sports events is known as the Dazzlers. The \"Gator Chomp\" is a gesture made by Florida Gators fans and players to show their support of the Florida Gators sports teams. The UF band originated in 1981 and is performed by fully extending one's arms, one over the other, in front of the body with the palms facing each other, and then moved apart and together to symbolize an alligator's mouth.[114] When performed by fans at home football or basketball games, the chomp is often accompanied by Florida's marching band or pep band playing the two-note shark motif from the film Jaws.[115] Another football fan tradition, both for home and road games, is playing and singing of \"We Are the Boys from Old Florida\" at the end of every third quarter. Following the death of Gainesville native Tom Petty in October 2017, his song \"I Won't Back Down\" is also played right after \"We Are the Boys\" while the entire stadium sings along. \"Orange and blue\" is a fan cheer that is popular at home sports events, with alternate stadium sections yelling \"Orange!\", and answering back with their loudest \"Blue!\" This can go back and forth for several minutes, with both sections competing to be the louder. The football team had a long-time tradition of having George Edmondson Jr. — better known as \"Mr. Two Bits\"— wandering through the stands with a sign and a whistle to pump up the crowd to the \"Two Bits\" cheer. Edmondson officially retired in 2008, and was made an honorary alumnus in 2005. His final appearance as Mr. Two Bits was at the last home game of the 2008 season against The Citadel. In June 2020, then university president Kent Fuchs announced that the University Athletic Association and the Gator Band would cease the use of the \"Gator Bait\" cheer at UF sporting events. While the university found no direct link between its usage of the phrase at sporting events and historical depictions of black children being used as alligator bait, it decided to end the chant due to \"horrific racist imagery\" associated with the phrase. The decision was reached amid a growing demand for social justice in the United States following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police and the ensuing protests.[116] Over 250 notable former Gators athletes and coaches have been inducted into the University of Florida Athletic Hall of Fame. Hall of Fame inductees fall into three categories: \"Gator Greats\"; \"Distinguished Letterwinners\"; and \"Honorary Letterwinners.\" Gator Greats are those former athletes who distinguished themselves during their undergraduate sports careers, and include former All-Americans, all-conference selections, winners of major national awards, individual national champions, and those who significantly contributed to national team championships. Distinguished Letterwinners are those former Gators athletes who achieved distinction after graduation, as athletic coaches or administrators, professional athletes, or in public service or other career activities. Honorary Letterwinners are those persons who are not University of Florida alumni and former undergraduate athletes, but have distinguished themselves by their significant contributions to the success of Florida Gators sports teams, including former championship Gators coaches. Gator Greats include Heisman Trophy winners Steve Spurrier, Danny Wuerffel, and Tim Tebow; Pro Football Hall of Fame members Jack Youngblood and Emmitt Smith; Olympic gold medal swimmers Tracy Caulkins, Nicole Haislett and Dara Torres; individual NCAA golf champions Page Dunlap, Nick Gilliam and Bob Murphy; Olympic gold medal soccer players Heather Mitts and Abby Wambach; and individual NCAA tennis champions Jill Craybas, Jeff Morrison and Lisa Raymond. Distinguished Letterwinners include head coaches Doug Dickey, Lindy Infante and Dutch Stanley, as well as U.S. Senator George Smathers. Honorary Letterwinners include former Gators national championship coaches Buster Bishop, Andy Brandi, Randy Reese and Mimi Ryan, former football coach and four-star general James Van Fleet, as well as medical professor Robert Cade, who invented the sports drink Gatorade at UF in the mid-1960s as a rehydration aid to assist Gators athletes. The University of Florida has a reputation and long history of producing athletes who compete in the Olympic Games. Over 160 university alumni, including Florida Gators athletes from over 35 countries, have competed in the Games, winning fifty Olympic gold medals, twenty-nine silver medals and thirty bronze medals (through the end of the 2012 Summer Olympics).[117] The list of notable Gator Olympians and gold medalists includes sprinters Kerron Clement, Dennis Mitchell, and Bernard Williams; marathon runner Frank Shorter; baseball outfielder Brad Wilkerson; basketball forward DeLisha Milton-Jones; soccer forward Abby Wambach; and swimmers Tracy Caulkins, Nicole Haislett and Ryan Lochte. Former Gator Dara Torres is the only American swimmer to compete in five Olympic Games (1984, 1988, 1992, 2000, 2008).[118] At the age of 41, Torres became the oldest swimmer to win an Olympic medal when she won a silver medal in her inclusion in three events in 2008, finishing her career with a total of twelve Olympic medals (including four gold).[118]",

During a street interview, Haliey Welch[1] used the catchphrase hawk tuah, an onomatopoeia for spitting or expectoration on a penis during fellatio.[2][3][4] On June 11, 2024, a vox pop YouTube channel, Tim & Dee TV owned by Tim Dickerson and DeArius Marlow, released a video featuring an interview with Haliey Welch in the Broadway district of Nashville, Tennessee, United States.[5] Welch and another woman approached Dickerson and Marlow and asked to be interviewed.[5][6] The interview began with what Dickerson and Marlow considered tamer questions, such as, \"What makes you wifey material?\"[5][6] Eventually, Dickerson and Marlow stated, Welch encouraged Marlow to \"spice up the questions\".[5][6] Marlow responded by asking, \"What's one move in bed that makes a man go crazy every time?\" Welch's reply, in a thick Southern accent was, \"You gotta give 'em that 'hawk tuah' and spit on that thang\", referring to spitting on someone's penis during sex, ostensibly for lubricatory purposes.[2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][excessive citations] In December 2024, Hailey created a coin to trade her logo, but was sued for crypto-fraud.[10] The next day, Marlow uploaded the clip to TikTok and almost immediately other accounts across social media began reposting the video after scrubbing off the \"Tim and Dee TV\" watermark.[5] Dickerson and Marlow estimated that they filed at least fifty copyright claims in the days after they first published the clip.[5] The original video had gone viral, receiving millions of views across TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube, spawning remixes and remakes of the original audio, and gaining Welch the nickname Hawk Tuah Girl.[11] The video and the phrase turned into a meme.[12] Welch, who had been a minimum-wage worker at a factory, subsequently created an Instagram account and gained a sizable social media followership and media attention.[13] She also founded a company under which she registered various trademarks, gained representation by an agent,[12] and began selling merchandise themed on the phrase and making paid appearances.[13] On August 15, 2024, she threw the ceremonial first pitch of a New York Mets game,[14] and launched a podcast, Talk Tuah, under the Betr media company co-founded by Jake Paul.[15] Dickerson and Marlow indicated they were happy for Welch but were remiss for not receiving credit for Welch's fame.[5]",

That rumor has since been walked back, but I had already seen the video and sort of figured out what was going on with the girl going viral for her fun sex tip. So now, I will pass that information on to you. Otherwise known as Haliey Welch, Hawk Tuah Girl is rising to prominence after being featured in a man-on-the-street interview from creators Tim & Dee TV. In the video, she’s asked “What’s one move in bed that makes a man go crazy every time?” Her response is what’s made her go viral. “You gotta give ’em that ‘hawk tuah’ and spit on that thang,” she exclaimed. Words can’t really capture her whole vibe, so let’s run the tape. 😂 #funny #fy #foryoupage #foryou #lol Do you get it now? “Hawk tuah” is like, the sound of the guy in the back of an old Western saloon using a spittoon, but she’s talking about sex. It is funny. Whether or not it’s more than a week’s worth of virality levels of funny is up to you. Yeah. It might be helpful to conceptualize this as a PG-13 version of the “Damn, Daniel” moment. She said something funny, the internet is loving it, and people are quickly scrambling to figure out how to capitalize on it. There was even a rumor that she was going to sign with United Talent Agency, but TMZ is now reporting that no such deal is actually in the works. Someone should figure out something to do with this girl. She’s a good sport with a lot of charisma, which is like half the job of being famous. Might I interest you in a hat? Or maybe a T-shirt that reads, “If she don’t hawk tuah, I don’t want to talk tuah”? Admittedly, that one is clever. Tim & Dee TV have created an official merch line to capitalize on their viral moment, but it’s unclear if Welch is getting a cut or not. (Unofficial “Hawk Tuah ’24” merch was even spotted by one Cut staffer while on vacation in New Buffalo, Michigan.) Where Welch is definitely making her money is from the official Hawk Tuah hats. The trucker-style caps are produced by Jason Poteete, who owns an apparel company called Fathead Threads and has reportedly known Welch for years. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Poteete shared that the merch has been doing big business. They’ve sold more than 2,000 hats already (the signed $50 version sold out quickly), and given the cheapest one is $32.78, the company must have brought in at least $65,000 on hats alone. Poteete wouldn’t say how much of that is going to Welch but said he wanted to make sure she saw some of the money being made off of her. “Of course she hasn’t gotten a dime from the first viral video that went out,” Poteete told the magazine. “Nobody was asking permission for her to do nothing, neither. I just wanted her to get some profit off of this deal.” No, people are just trolling. Tippah County Tribune, a satirical social-media account, shared a post on Facebook in which they claimed that Welch (whom they identify as “Hailey Wellington”) had lost her job as a preschool teacher at “Epstein Day School.” Their fake story included children “spitting on each other and everything else” in the wake of the viral video. Welch later revealed that she actually worked at a spring factory in her hometown in Tennessee, and that she did not lose that job over this whole ordeal. (She quit once the video blew up.) Welch sat down for her first interview with Brianna Lapaglia of the Barstool Sports podcast Plan Bri. Lapaglia is dating country singer Zach Bryan, and interviewed Welch backstage at his concert. (Later in the evening, he brought Welch onstage to sing his hit “Revival” with him and she dutifully screamed “Hawk tuah!” into the mic.) Welch told Lapaglia that she had been in Nashville for CMA Fest when she filmed her infamous clip and that she never expected to see the video again. She said that she saw it was going viral at around 2 a.m. while getting ready for work. “I shit a brick,” Welch said. As the video continued to gain traction, people began to make fake social-media accounts for the 21-year-old, who explained that she had deleted all her accounts six months ago for personal reasons. “It’s kinda creepy, seeing your face on another account that don’t belong to you,” she said. Of course, people have been weird about this whole thing. Welch said that someone recently offered Poteete (the hat guy) $600 if he could get her to spit in a jar and mail it to him. While there are the errant pervs to deal with, Welch says she wants to use this as a springboard to a career. She has a manager and a team now, and says that her plan is to do “a show, and we’re just gonna be on a bunch of podcasts and everything else in between.” No! People are actually being super-weird about her, which unfortunately is to be expected when you’re a cute girl who goes megaviral — especially for answering a question about sex. The internet is filled with freaks and perverts, and they have all become obsessed with Welch and her newly coined phrase. A representative for PornHub told TMZ that the website was projecting 4.7 million searches for the term “hawk tuah” by Tuesday. You have to imagine it would be easier to search for “spitting,” right? Meanwhile, “hawk tuah” has also become a political battleground. In her interview with Lapaglia, Welch declared that she would not give Donald Trump the ol’ hawk tuah. “It’s a no from me,” she said. BREAKING: The Hawk Tuah girl, AKA Hailey Welsh, has come out AGAINST Donald Trump in her first-ever interview: “It’s a no from me,” she said.“No. Absolutely not,” said her friend. pic.twitter.com/8rxdTYys3m People whose brains have been poisoned by the internet interpreted this as Welch stating her politics. “The degenerate Hawk Tuah girl, whose real name is Hailey Welsh, is ANTI TRUMP,” far-right political activist Laura Loomer posted on X. On the other side, a bizarre anonymous liberal account called Biden’s Wins declared that Welch had “demolished” Trump. Neither party seems to understand that Welch has not made a political statement; she simply does not want to engage in a sexual relationship with a 78-year-old man who always looks like he’s melting. As she told Lapaglia, she has a management team and they’re figuring out next steps for her. The Hollywood Reporter reported that Welch had signed with a management firm called The Penthouse. “I’m glad our team can help guide this rocket ship,” said The Penthouse founder Jonnie Forster in a statement. “All the podcasters are right — spend five minutes with her and you’ll see why she is America’s sweetheart.” I’m not sure who “all the podcasters” are, seeing as she’s only done one podcast. Welch, for her part, seems excited about this new venture. “Two weeks ago, it was just my granny and me in itty-bitty Belfast, Tennessee. Then I say something silly and now my life has changed. Isn’t God great?! Can’t wait for what’s ahead,” Welch said in a statement. She has since hit the ground running. Welch returned to Instagram last week and quickly gained 1 million followers. Over the Fourth of July weekend, Welch made her first paid appearance at Daer Dayclub at the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel & Casino in Hollywood, Florida. Welch shared a recap video of the event on Instagram, which included footage of her getting teary as a team of bottle girls celebrated her million-followers milestone. A post shared by Haliey Welch (@hay_welch) The next stop on her grand tour of the United States is New York, where she’ll be making a club appearance this weekend. Do you think Andy Cohen has already put in a request for her to bartend on Watch What Happens Live? The internet darling took some time to sit down with Rolling Stone, which declared in the headline of the piece that Welch is “the national hero we need.” What anyone is ever talking about is beyond me. In the interview, Welch divulged a few personal details. She was raised by her paternal grandmother; her mother has never been in her life; and while she loves animals, she stays away from adopting cats because “they always run away — or get run over.” She clarified what she meant when she said she wouldn’t “hawk tuah” Trump, saying, “I was talking about looks-wise. Donald Trump, I’m sure you’re a nice man, but you ain’t getting the hawk from me. He’s old enough to be my granddaddy.” It still seems as though neither Welch nor her management team know exactly what her next step is going to be. She told the magazine that she likes the idea of podcasting and wants to be in a vaguely comedic space. She has a publicist now, and when she was told she’s repped by the same firm that handles Bruce Springsteen’s publicity, she said, “Who is that?” Now, take a deep breath and repeat after me: It’s okay that a 21-year-old from a town of 700 people doesn’t know who Bruce Springsteen is. Welch is launching her podcast, creatively titled Talk Tuah, later this month through Jake Paul’s media company, Betr. In a press release, the company announced that Welch’s first guest would be Whitney Cummings, followed by content creator Josh Richards, and then Paul himself. The show, according to Betr, will “blend insightful interviews with comedic elements.” Thank God someone is finally bringing that to the podcasting space. “My show will have a little of everything — great guests, laughs, chit chats about your pets, relationship pointers, sports and, of course, some down home southern charm,” Welch said in a statement.

                "title": "“Hawk Tuah” girl: The problem with the whole Haliey Welch phenomenon.",
                "content": "Last week, I wrote a story about Haliey Welch, better known as the “Hawk Tuah” girl, who is enjoying a spurt of viral fame thanks to her puerile response to a man-on-the-street YouTube interviewer. (She was asked what she does in bed to make her man “go crazy,” to which Welch replied that she gives him the old hawk tuah—in layman’s terms, she’ll “spit on that thang.”) The meteoric rise of the Hawk Tuah meme then became a useful locus from which to examine the silent majority of low-information social media users—the Barstool clan, the Call Her Daddy fanatics, the men who post their doomed four-leg college football parlays on Twitter. This group has become better known as the “Zynternet” and, taken as a political faction, it represents the Americans who don’t follow political news, who spend a lot of time on the fairly disengaged “Hawk Tuah” internet, and who are overwhelmingly voting for Trump. I merely postulated that the Democrats had wasted a huge opportunity to co-opt her—something the right did in about 60 seconds—and called it a day. And, really, that’s all there was to say about “Hawk Tuah” girl. We sufficiently bled the discourse dry of all valuable insight, and we’re ready to move on to fresher hells. And yet, for some reason, my brethren in the media have not gotten this message. Yesterday Rolling Stone unveiled a fawning Haliey Welch exclusive that is so overheated in its posture that I almost wonder if it’s satire. Here is the subhead of that piece: She went viral for a sex joke, but Haliey Welch is much more—a charming Gen Z Dolly Parton who’s rightfully becoming America’s Sweetheart. A charming Gen Z Dolly Parton! Lord have mercy. Look, I understand how the game works. Journalists and editors alike are incentivized to gussy up their framing with provocative declarations, and given that all celebrity-focused journalism in the 2020s is a bloodsucking negotiation between various access arbiters and brand interests, I can imagine how the Powers That Be decreed that Welch’s name be invoked adjacent to, you know, one of the most iconic performers to ever walk the earth. But, I swear to God, we cannot keep moving the goalposts this far. Hawk Tuah is a funny meme! I had a nice time thinking about how it reflected an oft-ignored undercurrent in American culture. I even went on NPR to talk about it! And I’m sure Welch enjoyed her brief tour of the Barstool podcast network. But it’s over now, man. Let’s move on before it gets embarrassing. seeing someone wearing a Hawk Tuah hat in public feels like a social experiment. spending real American currency on that is CRAZY I have a brainrotted Adult Swim sense of humor and find the \"Hawk Tuah\" stuff about as funny as early-onset Alzheimer's. Joke-shaped garbage for people with no sense of humor. Hawk Tuah girl has, at best, 1-2 more days left in the news cycle. she's gonna go on Call Her Daddy, she's gonna date Harry Jowsey for a hot minute, and then she'll probably say a slur in an airplane video and it'll all be over. just let it play out and leave her alone I’ve been on the internet long enough to remember when there was a universally established life cycle for viral characters. The “Numa Numa” kid uploaded his video to Newgrounds and enjoyed an in-the-know ubiquity among forum dwellers in the early 2000s, without any predatory talent agents harboring fantasies of him splayed out on the cover of Spin. (Others that fall into this category include Tay Zonday, the Star Wars kid, and whoever made the “End of Ze World” Flash cartoon.) But unfortunately, in our modern hypercapitalized digital ecosystem, everyone who has even the faintest whiff of virality is now encouraged to mine that moment for all it’s worth—morphing, say, a cute, profane YouTube clip into the job. Think of the tools currently at your disposal! Cameo, OnlyFans, ersatz Instagram sponcon for poorly defined health drinks, all working in conjunction to ensure that Being Online is permanently tinged with sweaty desperation from all parties. (Apparently Welch is developing a reality show? Jesus.) Everyone wants to be a star, but really, most people who have a viral moment on the internet were meant to only ever be a meme. But who knows? Maybe I’m wrong and Welch’s career is poised to skyrocket to unfathomable heights. Perhaps she’ll next headline Stagecoach or appear in a forthcoming incarnation of the Fast and Furious franchise, and her fateful blow-job joke will be seen as a strange, divinatory omen of authentic stardom. If so, I will happily eat my words. Until then, if you are lucky (or unlucky) enough to brush against white-hot virality, maybe set your aspirations a smidge lower than Dolly Parton. There is so much grace and dignity in enjoying your 15 minutes of fame before returning to real life. Slate is published by The Slate Group, a Graham Holdings Company.

Ritz-Carlton Golf Club, Grande Lakes Orlando December 19-22 Video: Steve Stricker: The Benefits of a Boring Game In 2004, Steve Stricker faced a pivotal choice: continue with his steady, conservative style or embrace the booming, power-driven approach that was taking over the game. Stricker chose to double down on boring, focusing on his strengths, prioritizing his short game over the popular power-focused trend. While his play style may not be flashy, Stricker has shown that a calculated, risk-averse short game can yield impressive results over time. The PNC Championship continues to evolve since its beginning in 1995. Originally named the Father/Son Challenge, it was created by the International Management Group (IMG) to provide an opportunity for professional golfers to play competitive golf alongside their sons. In the following years, the field had expanded to include daughters and grandchildren. The first Son/Father pairing was added in 2017 and in 2019, Annika Sorenstam became the first female professional to join the field, teaming up with her father. In 2020, the name was changed to PNC Championship to reflect the high level of competition and the field composition while still celebrating the family relationships that make this event unique. Since 2012, PNC has been the presenting sponsor of the event. The sponsorship reflects the values of the groups involved and their focus on relationships, family and community. Among the most unique events in golf, all professional participants must have won a Major tournament to be eligible to participate. Event highlights at the The Ritz-Carlton Golf Club at Grande Lakes Resort in Orlando include 20 teams, a purse over $1 million, and over 35 hours of national coverage on NBC and the Golf Channel. This is a favorite event for the players because it allows them to have experiences with their families that they can’t get anywhere else. Meet the teams competing in this year's tournament.

CLEVELAND (AP) — Donovan Mitchell scored 27 points, Darius Garland added 16 and the Cleveland Cavaliers moved to 15-1 at home with a 124-101 win on Friday night over the Milwaukee Bucks, who played for the first time since winning the NBA Cup. Cleveland is 3-0 this season against Milwaukee, which was without All-Star guard Damian Lillard because of a strained calf. Evan Mobley scored 15 and Cleveland made 20 3-pointers while pushing its league-best record to 24-4. Giannis Antetokounmpo had 33 points and 14 rebounds for the Bucks, who may need a couple more days to shake off their collective hangover after winning the Cup on Tuesday in Las Vegas. With Lillard sidelined, the Bucks were missing their second-best player and 25.7 points per game. Milwaukee’s starting guards — Andre Jackson Jr. and AJ Green — shot a combined 0 of 9. 76ERS 108, HORNETS 98 PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Joel Embiid had 34 points and nine assists after missing a game because of a sinus fracture, helping Philadelphia beat Charlotte. Wearing a protective “ Phantom of the Opera ” mask, Embiid was introduced to a roaring ovation. Embiid scored 22 points in the first three quarters to lead the 76ers to their fourth win in five games. Philadelphia is still well under .500 at 9-16 but a recent hot streak has it at least within striking distance of a play-in tournament berth. Embiid has been ravaged by injuries this season and has only played in seven games, mostly due to knee soreness. Vasilije Micic led the Hornets with 20 points. They lost their fourth straight game and have lost for the 12th time in 13 games. THUNDER 104, HEAT 97 MIAMI (AP) — Jalen Williams scored a season-high 33 points, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander had 25 and Oklahoma City beat Miami for their seventh straight victory. Lu Dort scored 14 points and Isaiah Hartenstein had 13 points and 18 rebounds for the Thunder, who improved to 22-5 — the second-best record in the NBA and tops in the Western Conference. Oklahoma City’s winning streak is alive because the NBA Cup final — a loss Tuesday night to Milwaukee in Las Vegas — doesn’t count as a regular-season game. Tyler Herro had 28 points and 12 rebounds for Miami, which got 17 points and 10 rebounds from Bam Adebayo. The Heat lost Jimmy Butler to illness in the first quarter and briefly lost Adebayo in the third quarter when he got elbowed over an eye by teammate Jaime Jaquez Jr. Adebayo needed seven stitches but returned.

                "content": "Cryptocurrency sometimes called crypto-currency or crypto, refers to digital or virtual currency that utilizes cryptographic techniques for secure transactions. It exists solely in electronic form, independent of any central authority, and operates on decentralized networks, such as blockchain technology. Cryptocurrency is a digital payment system that doesn't rely on banks to verify transactions. It’s a peer-to-peer system that can enable anyone anywhere to send and receive payments. Instead of being physical money carried around and exchanged in the real world, cryptocurrency payments exist purely as digital entries to an online database describing specific transactions. When you transfer cryptocurrency funds, the transactions are recorded in a public ledger. Cryptocurrency is stored in digital wallets. Cryptocurrency received its name because it uses encryption to verify transactions. This means advanced coding is involved in storing and transmitting cryptocurrency data between wallets and to public ledgers. The aim of encryption is to provide security and safety. The first cryptocurrency was Bitcoin, which was founded in 2009 and remains the best known today. Much of the interest in cryptocurrencies is to trade for profit, with speculators at times driving prices skyward. Cryptocurrencies run on a distributed public ledger called blockchain, a record of all transactions updated and held by currency holders. Units of cryptocurrency are created through a process called mining, which involves using computer power to solve complicated mathematical problems that generate coins. Users can also buy the currencies from brokers, then store and spend them using cryptographic wallets. If you own cryptocurrency, you don’t own anything tangible. What you own is a key that allows you to move a record or a unit of measure from one person to another without a trusted third party. Although Bitcoin has been around since 2009, cryptocurrencies and applications of blockchain technology are still emerging in financial terms, and more uses are expected in the future. Transactions including bonds, stocks, and other financial assets could eventually be traded using the technology. There are thousands of cryptocurrencies. Some of the best known include: Bitcoin: Founded in 2009, Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency and is still the most commonly traded. The currency was developed by Satoshi Nakamoto – widely believed to be a pseudonym for an individual or group of people whose precise identity remains unknown. Ethereum: Developed in 2015, Ethereum is a blockchain platform with its own cryptocurrency, called Ether (ETH) or Ethereum. It is the most popular cryptocurrency after Bitcoin. Litecoin: This currency is most similar to bitcoin but has moved more quickly to develop new innovations, including faster payments and processes to allow more transactions. Ripple: Ripple is a distributed ledger system that was founded in 2012. Ripple can be used to track different kinds of transactions, not just cryptocurrency. The company behind it has worked with various banks and financial institutions. Tether (USDT): Launched in 2014, Tether is a stablecoin designed to maintain a 1:1 peg with the US dollar, providing stability in the volatile cryptocurrency market. It is widely used as a trading pair on exchanges. Binance Coin (BNB): Binance Coin was created in 2017 as the native token of the Binance cryptocurrency exchange. It offers reduced trading fees and can be used for various purposes within the Binance ecosystem. Solana (SOL): Developed in 2017, Solana is a high-performance blockchain platform that utilizes proof-of-history (PoH) and proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms to achieve fast transaction speeds and low fees. US Dollar Coin (USDC): US Dollar Coin, launched in 2018, is a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar and issued by Circle. It is fully backed by US dollar reserves held in regulated financial institutions.

It uses a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism called Ouroboros. Non-Bitcoin cryptocurrencies are collectively known as \"altcoins\" to distinguish them from the original. You may be wondering how to buy cryptocurrency safely. There are typically three steps involved. These are: Step 1: Choosing a platform The first step is deciding which platform to use. Generally, you can choose between a traditional broker or dedicated cryptocurrency exchange: When comparing different platforms, consider which cryptocurrencies are on offer, what fees they charge, their security features, storage and withdrawal options, and any educational resources. Step 2: Funding your account Once you have chosen your platform, the next step is to fund your account so you can begin trading. Most crypto exchanges allow users to purchase crypto using fiat (i.e., government-issued) currencies such as the US Dollar, the British Pound, or the Euro using their debit or credit cards – although this varies by platform. Crypto purchases with credit cards are considered risky, and some exchanges don't support them. Some credit card companies don't allow crypto transactions either. This is because cryptocurrencies are highly volatile, and it is not advisable to risk going into debt — or potentially paying high credit card transaction fees — for certain assets. Some platforms will also accept ACH transfers and wire transfers. The accepted payment methods and time taken for deposits or withdrawals differ per platform. Equally, the time taken for deposits to clear varies by payment method. An important factor to consider is fees. These include potential deposit and withdrawal transaction fees plus trading fees. Fees will vary by payment method and platform, which is something to research at the outset. Step 3: Placing an order You can place an order via your broker's or exchange's web or mobile platform. If you are planning to buy cryptocurrencies, you can do so by selecting \"buy,\" choosing the order type, entering the amount of cryptocurrencies you want to purchase, and confirming the order. The same process applies to \"sell\" orders. There are also other ways to invest in crypto. These include payment services like PayPal, Cash App, and Venmo, which allow users to buy, sell, or hold cryptocurrencies. In addition, there are the following investment vehicles: The best option for you will depend on your investment goals and risk appetite. Once you have purchased cryptocurrency, you need to store it safely to protect it from hacks or theft. Usually, cryptocurrency is stored in crypto wallets, which are physical devices or online software used to store the private keys to your cryptocurrencies securely. Some exchanges provide wallet services, making it easy for you to store directly through the platform. However, not all exchanges or brokers automatically provide wallet services for you. There are different wallet providers to choose from. The terms “hot wallet” and “cold wallet” are used: Typically, cold wallets tend to charge fees, while hot wallets don't. When it was first launched, Bitcoin was intended to be a medium for daily transactions, making it possible to buy everything from a cup of coffee to a computer or even big-ticket items like real estate. That hasn’t quite materialized and, while the number of institutions accepting cryptocurrencies is growing, large transactions involving it are rare. Even so, it is possible to buy a wide variety of products from e-commerce websites using crypto. Here are some examples: Technology and e-commerce sites: Several companies that sell tech products accept crypto on their websites, such as newegg.com, AT&T, and Microsoft. Overstock, an e-commerce platform, was among the first sites to accept Bitcoin. Shopify, Rakuten, and Home Depot also accept it. Luxury goods: Some luxury retailers accept crypto as a form of payment. For example, online luxury retailer Bitdials offers Rolex, Patek Philippe, and other high-end watches in return for Bitcoin. Cars: Some car dealers – from mass-market brands to high-end luxury dealers – already accept cryptocurrency as payment. Insurance: In April 2021, Swiss insurer AXA announced that it had begun accepting Bitcoin as a mode of payment for all its lines of insurance except life insurance (due to regulatory issues). Premier Shield Insurance, which sells home and auto insurance policies in the US, also accepts Bitcoin for premium payments. If you want to spend cryptocurrency at a retailer that doesn’t accept it directly, you can use a cryptocurrency debit card, such as BitPay in the US. Unfortunately, cryptocurrency crime is on the rise. Cryptocurrency scams include: Fake websites: Bogus sites which feature fake testimonials and crypto jargon promising massive, guaranteed returns, provided you keep investing. Virtual Ponzi schemes: Cryptocurrency criminals promote non-existent opportunities to invest in digital currencies and create the illusion of huge returns by paying off old investors with new investors’ money. One scam operation, BitClub Network, raised more than $700 million before its perpetrators were indicted in December 2019. \"Celebrity\" endorsements: Scammers pose online as billionaires or well-known names who promise to multiply your investment in a virtual currency but instead steal what you send. They may also use messaging apps or chat rooms to start rumours that a famous businessperson is backing a specific cryptocurrency. Once they have encouraged investors to buy and driven up the price, the scammers sell their stake, and the currency reduces in value. Romance scams: The FBI warns of a trend in online dating scams, where tricksters persuade people they meet on dating apps or social media to invest or trade in virtual currencies. The FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Centre fielded more than 1,800 reports of crypto-focused romance scams in the first seven months of 2021, with losses reaching $133 million. Otherwise, fraudsters may pose as legitimate virtual currency traders or set up bogus exchanges to trick people into giving them money. Another crypto scam involves fraudulent sales pitches for individual retirement accounts in cryptocurrencies. Then there is straightforward cryptocurrency hacking, where criminals break into the digital wallets where people store their virtual currency to steal it. Cryptocurrencies are usually built using blockchain technology. Blockchain describes the way transactions are recorded into \"blocks\" and time stamped. It's a fairly complex, technical process, but the result is a digital ledger of cryptocurrency transactions that's hard for hackers to tamper with. In addition, transactions require a two-factor authentication process. For instance, you might be asked to enter a username and password to start a transaction. Then, you might have to enter an authentication code sent via text to your personal cell phone. While securities are in place, that does not mean cryptocurrencies are un-hackable. Several high-dollar hacks have cost cryptocurrency start-ups heavily. Hackers hit Coincheck to the tune of $534 million and BitGrail for $195 million, making them two of the biggest cryptocurrency hacks of 2018. Unlike government-backed money, the value of virtual currencies is driven entirely by supply and demand. This can create wild swings that produce significant gains for investors or big losses. And cryptocurrency investments are subject to far less regulatory protection than traditional financial products like stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. According to Consumer Reports, all investments carry risk, but some experts consider cryptocurrency to be one of the riskier investment choices out there. If you are planning to invest in cryptocurrencies, these tips can help you make educated choices. Research exchanges: Before you invest, learn about cryptocurrency exchanges. It’s estimated that there are over 500 exchanges to choose from. Do your research, read reviews, and talk with more experienced investors before moving forward. Know how to store your digital currency: If you buy cryptocurrency, you have to store it. You can keep it on an exchange or in a digital wallet. While there are different kinds of wallets, each has its benefits, technical requirements, and security. As with exchanges, you should investigate your storage choices before investing. Diversify your investments: Diversification is key to any good investment strategy, and this holds true when you are investing in cryptocurrency. Don't put all your money in Bitcoin, for example, just because that's the name you know. There are thousands of options, and it's better to spread your investment across several currencies. Prepare for volatility: The cryptocurrency market is highly volatile, so be prepared for ups and downs. You will see dramatic swings in prices. If your investment portfolio or mental wellbeing can't handle that, cryptocurrency might not be a wise choice for you. Cryptocurrency is all the rage right now, but remember, it is still in its relative infancy and is considered highly speculative. Investing in something new comes with challenges, so be prepared. If you plan to participate, do your research, and invest conservatively to start. One of the best ways you can stay safe online is by using a comprehensive antivirus. Kaspersky Premium defends you from malware infections, spyware, data theft and protects your online payments using bank-grade encryption. Related articles: © 2024 AO Kaspersky Lab",

                "title": "Travis Scott - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Jacques Bermon Webster II (born April 30, 1991), known professionally as Travis Scott (formerly stylized as Travi$ Scott), is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, and record producer. Scott has had four number-one hits on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart, along with a total of over one hundred charting songs. In addition to ten Grammy Award nominations, he has won a Latin Grammy Award, Billboard Music Award, MTV Video Music Award, and several BET Hip Hop Awards.[9] Scott's musical style has been described as a \"blend between traditional hip-hop and lo-fi\" and often characterized as \"ambient,\" with a heavily appraised influence from rappers Kanye West and Kid Cudi. His stage name is derived from the latter's real name, Scott Mescudi, combined with the name of a favorite uncle. In 2012, Scott signed his first major-label recording contract with Epic Records, as well as a publishing deal with Kanye West's GOOD Music as an in-house producer. In April 2013, he entered a joint-venture record deal with Georgia-based rapper T.I.'s Grand Hustle Records. Scott self-released his first full-length project, a mixtape titled Owl Pharaoh in 2013, which was followed by his debut mixtape, Days Before Rodeo (2014). His debut studio album, Rodeo (2015), was met with critical and commercial success; it spawned the singles \"3500\" (featuring Future and 2 Chainz) and \"Antidote,\" the latter peaked at number 16 on the Billboard Hot 100. His second album, Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight (2016), became his first number-one album on the Billboard 200 chart. In the following year, Scott formed the duo Huncho Jack with rapper Quavo, with whom he released an eponymous collaborative album (2017). Scott's third studio album, Astroworld (2018), was released to widespread critical acclaim and became his second consecutive number-one album on the Billboard 200. It yielded his first Billboard Hot 100 number-one single, \"Sicko Mode\" (featuring Drake).[10] In late 2019, Scott's vanity label imprint, Cactus Jack Records released the compilation album JackBoys, which also topped the Billboard 200. With his 2019 single \"Highest in the Room\" and his 2020 singles \"The Scotts\" (with Kid Cudi) and \"Franchise\" (featuring Young Thug and M.I.A.), Scott became the first artist on the Billboard Hot 100 to have three songs debut at number one in less than a year.[11] Following a series of controversies and five years after the release of his previous solo album, Scott released Utopia (2023), which became his fourth consecutive number-one album on the Billboard 200. Along with his highly publicized relationship with American media personality Kylie Jenner, Scott has collaborated with organizations including Nike, Dior, and McDonald's. His Cactus Jack record label, founded in 2017, has signed artists including Don Toliver and Sheck Wes. Scott has gained notoriety for controversies and legal issues regarding concert safety. In November 2021, a mass-casualty crowd crush occurred during Scott's hometown performance at his annual Astroworld Festival, causing ten deaths and hundreds of injuries.[12][13][14] Jacques Bermon Webster II[15] was born on April 30, 1991, in Houston, Texas.[16] From ages one through six, Webster lived with his grandmother in South Park, Houston. The neighborhood was notorious for crime and had an impact on a young Webster, \"Growing up, my grandmother stayed in the 'hood so I seen random crazy shit. [I saw] mad bums and crazy spazzed out motherfuckers, I saw people looking weird, hungry, and grimey [sic]. I was always like, 'I gotta get the fuck out this shit.' It gave me my edge—[it made me] who I am right now.\"[17] Webster moved to Missouri City, a middle-class suburban area bordering southwest Houston, to live with his parents. His mother worked for Apple and his father ran his own business.[18] Webster's father is also a soul musician and his grandfather was a jazz composer.[19] Webster attended Elkins High School and graduated at seventeen.[20] During high school, he participated in musical theater.[21] Webster then attended the University of Texas at San Antonio, before dropping out his second year to fully pursue his music career.[22][23] During an interview, Webster revealed he chose his moniker as a combination of his favorite uncle, Travis, and the first name of one of his biggest inspirations, Kid Cudi (whose real name is Scott Mescudi).[24] Webster formed a duo with his longtime friend Chris Holloway known as The Graduates. In 2008, the duo released their untitled first EP on social networking website Myspace. The following year, Scott and OG Chess, one of Scott's schoolmates, formed the group The Classmates. The Classmates released two projects, with Buddy Rich in 2009 and Cruis'n USA in 2010.[25] Scott mainly handled production work on both projects. The duo remained together until late 2012, when personal conflicts and financial disputes led to the disbandment of the group.[26] After leaving college, Scott moved from Houston to Washington Heights in New York City where Scott began working with friend Mike Waxx, who owned the music website Illroots. After moving to New York, Scott slept on the floor at his friend's house and spent most of his time at Just Blaze's studio. Eventually frustrated in New York and the lack of progression,[27] Scott moved to Los Angeles, California, after only four months in the state. In Los Angeles, Webster was abandoned by his friend who had promised to help him by providing housing. His parents cut him off financially and he eventually was forced to relocate back to Houston, where his parents kicked him out of their home. Webster moved back to Los Angeles once again and began to sleep on the couch of a friend who studied at University of Southern California.[28] Atlanta-based rapper and owner of Grand Hustle Records, T.I. would later hear one of Webster's productions, titled \"Lights (Love Sick)\". While in Los Angeles, T.I.'s representative contacted Webster, asking him to attend a studio for a meeting. During the meeting, T.I. freestyled over \"Animal\", one of Webster's productions.[29] Scott's First solo full-length project is a mixtape titled Owl Pharaoh, which was set to be released as a free download in 2012. However, the project was delayed, and was announced to be slated for a later release. The project was later re-created[30] by Kanye West and Mike Dean, and was then again delayed for sample clearance issues. In promotion Scott would release the track, \"Blocka La Flame\", a remix of fellow GOOD Music label-mate Pusha T's single \"Blocka\" (which features production and vocals from Scott). The song was produced by Young Chop, with additional production by Scott himself, alongside Mike Dean. On March 22, 2013, Scott released the music video for a song titled \"Quintana\", set to appear on Owl Pharaoh. On March 27, XXL revealed that Scott was a member of their Freshman Class of 2013.[31] Later on March 29, 2013, following his interview with British disc jockey, DJ Semtex, Scott premiered a snippet of his commercial debut single, titled \"Upper Echelon\", featuring 2 Chainz and T.I. On April 2, 2013, Scott stated Owl Pharaoh was his official debut mixtape and would be released on the iTunes Store on May 21, 2013.[32] On April 23, 2013, \"Upper Echelon\" was sent to urban contemporary radio.[33] On March 13, 2014, Scott performed a new song, tentatively titled \"1975\" featuring Big Sean, from his upcoming project at the time, at the Texan music festival South by Southwest (SXSW).[34] Scott later confirmed via his Twitter account that the song is not called \"1975\", and would be included on his second mixtape, titled Days Before Rodeo.[35] He would later take to his Twitter account to announce Rodeo, as the official title for his major-label debut studio album.[36][37][38] On May 5, 2014, Scott released the full version of the song, with its new title \"Don't Play\", featuring a sample of the song \"M.O.N.E.Y\" by the English rock band the 1975.[39][40] On July 11, 2014, \"Don't Play\" was officially released as the lead single from Days Before Rodeo, via digital distribution.[41] Following the success of Days Before Rodeo, Scott announced that he would headline a concert tour, called The Rodeo Tour, with rapper Young Thug and producer Metro Boomin.[42] The tour started on March 1, 2015, in Santa Ana, California, and ended on April 1, 2015, in Portland, Oregon. The tour ran through major cities and artists such as Kanye West, Chris Brown, Wale and Birdman made special guest appearances in certain cities.[43][44] Rodeo was released on September 4, 2015, by Grand Hustle and Epic Records. The album features guest appearances from Quavo, Juicy J, Kanye West, The Weeknd, Swae Lee, Chief Keef, Justin Bieber, Young Thug and Toro y Moi, and includes production from Mike Dean, Kanye West, WondaGurl, Suber, DJ Dahi, Metro Boomin, 1500 or Nothin', Sonny Digital, Southside, Terrace Martin, Zaytoven, Pharrell Williams and Scott himself, among others. The album was supported by two singles: \"3500\" featuring Future and 2 Chainz, and \"Antidote\". The latter became his highest-charting single on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, peaking at number 16. Rodeo received generally positive reviews from critics and debuted at number three on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart. It also debuted at number one on the Billboard Rap Albums chart.[45] On January 4, 2016, Scott announced that he has a new studio album on the way. On March 29, 2016, 300 Entertainment executive Lyor Cohen, revealed that Scott and Young Thug were releasing a single together and called Scott's upcoming album a \"classic\".[46] On April 7, 2016, Scott previewed a single with Young Thug at one of his shows.[47] On May 17, 2016, Scott announced that the title of his second album would be Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight, while also confirming the title for his third album to be Astroworld.[48] On June 3, 2016, the collaborative single between Thug and Scott was released, titled \"Pick Up the Phone\". The single, which also features vocals from Quavo of Atlanta-based rap trio Migos, reached number 43 on the Billboard Hot 100 and was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). On August 31, 2016, Scott announced that Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight was finally finished in a post on Instagram.[49] Scott premiered the album on his third episode of .wav radio on September 2, 2016,[50] and was later released on iTunes and Apple Music. On September 11, 2016, the album became Scott's first number one album on the U.S. Billboard 200.[51] On September 12, 2016, Universal Music Publishing Group's CEO, Jody Gerson announced that the label signed a worldwide deal with Scott.[52] In the same episode Scott premiered Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight, he also announced that he would be executive producing on Kanye West's Cruel Winter, a follow-up to his G.O.O.D. Music label's debut compilation Cruel Summer.[53] In the episode he described the upcoming album as, \"very youthful, straight to the point, like the illest ever, man, like the illest album\". Scott performed at All-Star Weekend on February 16, 2017, in New Orleans, Louisiana at Champion Square.[54] He also performed at New Orleans BUKU Music + Art Project festival on March 10, 2017.[55] On March 5, Scott announced a concert tour called \"Birds Eye View\".[56] The next day, the dates and cities for the tour were unveiled, with it beginning on March 10, in New Orleans, Louisiana, and coming to an end on June 2, in Eugene, Oregon. In the same month, Scott was also featured alongside American rapper Quavo from the hip-hop group Migos on Canadian rapper Drake's single \"Portland\", from Drake's commercial mixtape, More Life. The song peaked at number nine on the US Billboard Hot 100, becoming his first top ten song as a featured artist.[57][58] In March 2017, Scott announced he would be launching his own imprint, under the name of Cactus Jack Records.[7] On April 3, 2017, it was reported Scott had been working on a collaborative studio album with Quavo, potentially to be released later in 2017.[59][60] Speaking to GQ, he confirmed: 'The Quavo album is coming soon. I'm dropping new music soon. You know how I do it though: I like surprises.[61] In addition to the collaborative album, Scott announced his third studio album Astroworld, named after the defunct Houston theme park of the same name, was nearing completion and would most likely be released in 2017.[62][63] On May 16, 2017, Scott released three new tracks on SoundCloud, after teasing on social media for some time.

The song peaked at 72 on the Billboard Hot 100.[67] On December 21, 2017, Scott and Quavo released their collaborative studio album, Huncho Jack, Jack Huncho, under the name \"Huncho Jack\", a name which comes from Quavo's nickname \"Huncho\" and a play on Scott's first name \"Jack\".

No lying to the artists about album release dates or the budgets of videos and albums.[124] Following the release of Astroworld, Scott announced the Astroworld Festival, an annual festive concert that would take place across the street from the former site of Six Flags AstroWorld.[125] The 2018 Astroworld Festival contained appearances from Post Malone, Lil Wayne, Young Thug, Rae Sremmurd, Gunna, Houston All Stars, Sheck Wes, Metro Boomin, Trippie Redd, Smokepurpp, Virgil Abloh, and Tommy Genesis.[126] Scott was introduced to the creative side of the fashion industry due to his personal stylish pairings of high-end fashion and streetwear. This caught the early attention of brands like Been Trill, Diamond Supply Co., and A Bathing Ape.[citation needed] Travis's liking for camp designs made its way into his collaboration with Been Trill.

At Lollapalooza in 2015, Scott was charged and arrested for disorderly conduct after inciting concertgoers to ignore security and rush the stage.[184] For this, he would later plead guilty to reckless conduct and receive one year of supervised release.[185] That same year, at the Openair Festival in Switzerland, he encouraged fans to attack a man who took his shoe while he was crowd-surfing, by stopping the concert and repeatedly telling the crowd to \"fuck him up\", while also spitting on him.[186] In 2017, he was arrested for similar conduct to his Lollapalooza behavior after a performance at the Walmart Arkansas Music Pavilion[187] in Northwest Arkansas.[188] That same year, a fan sued Scott and the organizers of a 2017 concert at Terminal 5 in Manhattan after falling from a balcony and being dragged on stage, blaming the fall on a crowd surge.[189] In 2019, three people were trampled and injured as a crowd rushed to enter the compound at Astroworld.[190][191] On November 5, 2021, at least ten people died and hundreds were injured in a crowd crush moving toward the stage during Scott's performance at the Astroworld Festival in NRG Park in his hometown of Houston, Texas.[14] On the first night, a crowd crush occurred, resulting in the cancellation of the second night of the festival.[13][192][12] In video footage of the incident, Scott is seen continuing to perform despite chants from the crowd pleading for him to stop; observing at least one audience member had been hurt, then ordering security for a brief moment to \"help, jump in real quick, keep going\", only to continue with the rest of the show for the following hour; encouraging people to \"get wild\" and \"crazy\", despite an ambulance passing through the crowd that was pulling out lifeless bodies.[193][194] Victims killed ranged from 9 to 27 years old.[195] Shortly after, a lawsuit was announced by the concertgoers. It was started by Kristian Paredes, who filed for $1,000,000 due to the injuries he received. On June 29, 2023, a Texas grand jury decided against indicting Scott.[196] The grand jury declined to indict Scott in a criminal probe of the deadly 2021 crowd surge.[197][198][199] The deaths had happened in November 2021 at Scott's Astroworld in Houston, when a surge in the crowd of 50,000 attendees caused a panic.[200][201][202] On March 1, 2023, Scott was performing at Nebula, a nightclub in New York City, alongside Don Toliver when a sound technician, identified only as Mark, asked Scott to lower the music as it was too loud for the venue's size. Scott reportedly responded by giving Mark the middle finger and punching him in the head, resulting in Mark needing medical attention and police being called to the scene around 3:25 a.m. Scott had reportedly been drinking alcohol and damaged $12,000 in the club's sound equipment before he left the premises. The New York City Police Department (NYPD) issued a warrant for Scott's arrest in relation to the incident on March 2, 2023.[203][204] The matter was resolved with a settlement reached and the NYPD not pressing any charges.[205][206] In the early hours of June 20, 2024, Scott was arrested in Miami Beach on charges of disorderly intoxication and trespassing property after warning.[207] He was released over six hours later after posting a $650 bond.[208] The same day, Scott would capitalize on this incident by unleashing merchandise containing his mugshot which was taken following the arrest.[209] In August, prosecutors dropped Scott's disorderly intoxication charge whilst continuing to press charges for trespassing after warning.[210] In the early hours of August 9, 2024, Scott was arrested in Paris after allegedly getting into a fight with his bodyguard. A security guard at the luxury George V hotel where Scott was staying at intervened, which prompted Scott to attack the security guard as well.[211][212] Scott was released without charges the following day.[213] Studio albums Collaborative albums Headlining Supporting",

He had 12 rebounds and six assists while shooting 21-of-22 from the free-throw line.[45] On January 7, he hit the 40-point mark for the third time in six games, finishing with 42 points in a 123–118 overtime win over the Toronto Raptors.[46] Two days later, he was named Eastern Conference Player of the Week for games played Monday, January 2 through Sunday, January 8.[47] On January 19, Butler was named a starter on the Eastern Conference All-Star team for the 2017 NBA All-Star Game.[48] After questioning the desire of the team's younger players following a loss to the Atlanta Hawks on January 25, Butler was fined and held out of the starting lineup against the Miami Heat on January 27. He finished with three points on 1-for-13 shooting.[49] On February 25, 2017, he recorded his third career triple-double with 18 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists in a 117–99 win over the Cleveland

Western Conference All-Star reserve.[59] On February 9, in his return to Chicago, Butler scored 38 points in a 114–113 loss to the Bulls.[60] Butler chose to not play in the All-Star Game, prioritizing the stretch run of the season and thought the rest would benefit him.[61] In the Timberwolves' first game after the All-Star break, on February 23 against the Houston Rockets, Butler left the game late in the third quarter with a right knee injury.[62] Two days later, he underwent meniscus surgery and was ruled out indefinitely.[63] Butler returned to play on April 6 and scored 18

the team in the 2019 off-season.[68] A month after requesting this trade, in an October practice of this season, Butler teamed up with third-string players to scrimmage and win against the team's usual starters.[69] When a trade was not achieved prior to the start of the regular season, Butler opted to play for Minnesota in 2018–19.[68] He appeared in 10 of the Timberwolves' first 13 games before being traded in early November.[67][70] On November 12, 2018, Butler was traded, along with Justin Patton, to the Philadelphia 76ers in exchange for Jerryd Bayless, Robert Covington, Dario

Heat reached the NBA Finals after defeating the Boston Celtics in the Eastern Conference Finals in six games, earning Butler his first finals appearance.[88] In Game 3 of the NBA Finals, Butler finished with 40 points, 11 rebounds, and 13 assists and became the third player in finals history to record a 40+ point triple-double, joining LeBron James (then with Cleveland) in 2015 and Jerry

He became the first player in NBA postseason history to meet all of those benchmarks since steals and blocks were first recorded in 1974. Butler posted his fifth career playoff game with 40 points on 60 percent shooting, and tied with Charles Barkley for third-most over the last 30 playoffs. The only players that have more such games are James (12) and Shaquille O'Neal (8).

He made 16 of 29 shots, including 4-of-8 from the three-point range and all 11 free throws. Butler's 47 points were the seventh-most in NBA history for a player facing elimination. He also became the first player since Michael Jordan in 1988 to have multiple games of at least 40 points and four steals in the same series.[111][112] The Heat lost the series in seven games, despite Butler's 35-point and nine-rebound outing in a 100–96 loss in a decisive Game 7, where he missed his game-winning three-pointer with 16 seconds left in the game.[113][114] Butler had his eighth 30-point game of the postseason, making it the most in a single postseason by a Heat player since James in 2013, who also had eight such games.[115][116] On November 10, 2022, Butler scored a season-high 35 points, along with 10 rebounds and eight assists in an 117–112 overtime win over the Charlotte Hornets. He scored eight consecutive Heat points at the end of regulation just to get them into the extra session.[117] On December 2, Butler returned to the lineup after missing the previous seven games with a sore right knee. He had a season-high 15 rebounds and 25 points in a 120–116 overtime win over the reigning Eastern Conference champions Boston Celtics.[118] On January 10, 2023, Butler tied his season-high with 35 points, along with seven rebounds, four assists, four steals and three blocks in an 112–111 win over the Oklahoma City Thunder.

He also became the first player in Heat history to put up back-to-back 40-point playoff games and also put up his eighth 40-point playoff game as a member of the Heat, surpassing Dwyane Wade's previous Heat franchise record of seven 40-point playoff games. In Games 4 and 5, Butler amassed a total of 98 points, becoming one of five players in NBA playoff history to produce that many points in a two-game span. He joined Michael Jordan (who accomplished the feat on three occasions), Jerry West, Elgin Baylor and Rick Barry. Butler finished the series averaging 37.6 points, 6 rebounds, 4.8 assists and 1.8 steals per game.[130][131][132] In Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals, Butler recorded 35 points, five rebounds, seven assists and a playoff career-high six steals in a 123–116 win over the Boston Celtics.[133] The Heat eventually advanced to the NBA Finals after winning the series in seven games. In Game 7 against the Celtics, Butler posted 28 points, seven rebounds, six assists and three steals in the 103–84 win.[134][135] In a narrow vote between him and Caleb Martin, Butler was named Eastern Conference Finals MVP, averaging 24.7 points, 7.6 rebounds, 6.1 assists and 2.6 steals per game.[136] In Game 2 of the NBA Finals, Butler put up 21 points and nine assists in a 111–108 win over the Denver Nuggets. He joined LeBron James and Dwyane Wade as the only players in Heat history to put up at least 500 points, 100 rebounds, and 100 assists in a single postseason run.[137] However, the Heat went on to lose the next 3 games of the series to lose the finals in 5 games.[138] On November 16, 2023, Butler scored 36 points in a 122–115 win over the Brooklyn Nets, to lead the Heat to their first seven-game win streak since January 14, 2018.[139] On December 16, Butler put up 28 points alongside a buzzer-beating, game-winning stepback jumper in a 118–116 win over the Chicago Bulls.[140][141] On February 7, 2024, Butler recorded his 16th career triple-double with 17 points, 11 rebounds, 11 assists and three steals in a 116–104 win over the San Antonio Spurs.[142] On March 2, Butler scored a season-high 37 points on 12-of-19 shooting, 3-of-3 from three and 10-of-11 from the free throw line in a 126–120 win over the Utah Jazz.[143] Butler missed the 2024 NBA playoffs following a medial collateral ligament (MCL) sprain he sustained during a play-in game against the Philadelphia 76ers.[144] On November 24, 2024, Butler scored 33 points along with nine rebounds and six assists in a 123–118 overtime win over the Dallas Mavericks.[145] On December 16, he had 35 points, 19 rebounds and 10 assists in a 125–124 loss to the Detroit Pistons, becoming the third player in NBA history to finish with at least 35 points, 19 rebounds, 10 assists and four steals in a game, joining DeMarcus Cousins in 2018 and George McGinnis in 1976.[146] While attending Marquette, Butler earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in communications.[147][148] Butler is a fan of country and emo music.

                "content": "This is an accepted version of this page The Texas Longhorns football program is the intercollegiate team representing the University of Texas at Austin (variously Texas or UT) in the sport of American football. The Longhorns compete in the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (formerly Division I-A) as a member of the Southeastern Conference (SEC). Their home games are played at Darrell K Royal–Texas Memorial Stadium in Austin, Texas. With over 900 wins, and an all-time win–loss percentage of .704, the Longhorns rank 4th (tied) and 12th on the all-time wins and win–loss records lists, respectively. Additionally, the program claims 4 national championships, 33 conference championships, 100 First Team All-Americans (62 consensus and 25 unanimous), and 2 Heisman Trophy winners. Beginning in 1893, the Texas Longhorns football program is one of the most highly regarded and historic programs of all time.[4] From 1936 to 1946 the team was led by Hall of Fame coach Dana X. Bible,[5] and then from 1957 to 1976 the team was led by Hall of Fame coach Darrell K Royal,[6] who won three national championships.[7] The first championship was in 1963 and the second was in 1969.[6] In 2009, ESPN ranked Texas as the seventh-most prestigious college football program since 1936.[8] In 2012, the football program was valued at $805 million,[9] more than the calculated value of several NFL teams.[citation needed] Texas is known for their post-season appearances, ranking second in number of bowl game appearances (55),[10] fourth in bowl game victories (29), most Southwest Conference football championships (27), and most Cotton Bowl Classic appearances[11] and victories. Other NCAA records include 108 winning seasons out of 122 total seasons, 24 seasons with 10 or more wins, 9 undefeated seasons, and 26 seasons with at most one loss or tie. From 1936 to 2012, the Longhorns football teams have been in the AP or coaches' rankings 66 out of 76 seasons (86.8% of the time), finishing those seasons ranked in the top twenty-five 48 times and the top ten 28 times. Texas claims four Division I-A national championships (1963, 1969, 1970 and 2005) and 33 conference championships (4 Big 12 Conference, 27 Southwest Conference, and 2 Texas Intercollegiate Athletic Association). A total of 129 (53 consensus and 22 unanimous) Texas players have been named to College Football All-America Teams, while two Longhorn players, Earl Campbell (1977) and Ricky Williams (1998), have won the Heisman Trophy,[12] \"College football's most prestigious individual honor\".[13] Seventeen Longhorns have been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame, while four are enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. At the start of the 2019 season, Texas' all-time record was 909–371–33 (.705), which ranked as the third-most wins.[14][15] By the end of the season, Texas' record was 916–375–33 (.704), losing a spot and dropping to fourth in NCAA Division I FBS overall history.[16] In July 2021, after 25 seasons as members of the Big 12, Texas and rival Oklahoma accepted invitations to join the Southeastern Conference (SEC) no later than the 2025 season.[17] In February 2023, the Big 12 announced that the two schools had negotiated a combined $100 million early termination fee in order to leave for the SEC a year before the schools' media rights deal with the Big 12 was set to expire.[18] The Longhorns football team continued competing in the Big 12 through the 2023 season before moving to the SEC in 2024. Texas has been affiliated with four conferences and twice been an independent.[19] Texas has been selected national champion in 9 seasons from NCAA-designated major selectors, including 4 from the major wire-service: AP Poll and/or Coaches' Poll.[20]: 107–109 The 1963, 1969, 1970, and 2005 championships are claimed by the school, while the remainder are not claimed.[21] Texas has won 33 conference championships, 27 outright and six shared, spanning three conferences, the Texas Intercollegiate Athletic Association, the Southwest Conference, and the Big 12 Conference.[25][19] † Co-champions Texas has won a share of 7 Big 12 South titles, 5 of which resulted in an appearance in the Big 12 Championship Game. Texas is 3–2 in those appearances. As of 2011, the new ten-team Big 12 Conference ceased to have divisions and conference championship games.[26] † Co-champions At the end of the 2018 season, Texas is tied for second in all time bowl appearances in the NCAA FBS at 55, matching Georgia and trailing Alabama's 70 appearances.[27] (Note: Some years Texas went to two bowls although they were in different seasons) ^ The 2006 Rose Bowl was both the Rose Bowl Game and the sanctioned BCS National Championship Game, after that season the BCS NCG became a separate game unaffiliated with the major bowl games. † The Bluebonnet Bowl in Houston was discontinued in 1988, but was replaced by the Houston Bowl (2000–2001) and the Texas Bowl (2006–current). ‡ The Freedom Bowl merged with the Holiday Bowl in 1995. Texas has played in four Bowl Championship Series games (including two BCS National Championships) and one New Year's Six bowl. Texas also played in two Bowl Alliance games (the precursor to the BCS): the 1995 Sugar Bowl and the 1997 Fiesta Bowl. There have been 31 head coaches since the inaugural team in 1893, with Steve Sarkisian being the current head coach of the Longhorns.[28] The Longhorns have played their home games in Darrell K Royal–Texas Memorial Stadium (formerly just \"Memorial Stadium\" and \"Texas Memorial Stadium\") on Campbell-Williams Field[29] since 1924. The stadium is located on the campus of The University of Texas in Austin, Texas. The current official stadium capacity is 100,119,[30] making it the second largest football venue in the state of Texas,[31] the fifth largest in the SEC Conference,[32] the fifth largest on-campus stadium in the NCAA, and the seventh largest non-racing stadium in the world. The stadium has been expanded several times since its original opening, and now includes 100,119 permanent seats, the nation's first high definition video display in a collegiate facility nicknamed \"Godzillatron,\"[33] and a newly renovated Joe Jamail Field with FieldTurf. The current DKR-Texas Memorial Stadium and Big 12 attendance record was set on September 15, 2018, against USC with 103,507 spectators. The final planned phase of the stadium's expansion includes the construction of permanent seating and an upper deck in the south end zone, completely enclosing the playing field. The stadium's seating capacity is expected to reach 112,000 once the south end zone is fully enclosed, which would mean DKR-Texas Memorial Stadium would surpass Michigan Stadium as the largest football stadium in North America.[34] However, the date of the final construction phase to fully enclose the south end zone has not been set nor have any funds been raised. Varying sources claim this phase may not take place for upwards of 10 to 15 years, though on March 11, 2014, an announcement was made that an exploratory committee has been formed regarding the expansion of the stadium in conjunction with the construction of the Dell Medical School on campus. Before the Longhorns football team moved to DKR, they played their home games at Clark Field from 1887[35] to 1924. Clark Field was a wooden-structured stadium located on the University of Texas campus.[36] The Longhorns last game at Clark Field before moving to brand new Memorial Stadium occurred on October 25, 1924. The Longhorns battled the Florida Gators to a 7–7 tie that day.[37] Texas finished with a record of 135–23–3 during their time at Clark Field.[38] Texas has a long-standing rivalry with the University of Oklahoma. The football game between the University of Texas and Oklahoma is commonly known as the \"Red River Rivalry\" and is held annually in Dallas at the Cotton Bowl. Dallas is used as a \"neutral site\" since it is approximately midway between the two campuses. The stadium is split, with each team having an equal number of supporters on each side of the 50 yard line. Texas state flags fly around the Longhorn end of the stadium and Oklahoma state flags fly around the Sooner end. This border rivalry is often considered to be one of the top five current rivalries in the NCAA. The Red River Shootout originated in 1900, while Oklahoma was still a territory of the United States, and it is the longest-running college-football rivalry played on a neutral field.[39] Since 2005, the football game has received sponsorship dollars in return for being referred to as the \"SBC Red River Rivalry\"[40] (changed to AT&T Red River Rivalry in 2006 after SBC merged with AT&T), a move which has been criticized both for its commercialism[41] and its political correctness.[42] The University of Texas holds its annual Torchlight Parade during the week of the Red River Rivalry.[43] In 2005, the Dallas Morning News did an opinion poll of the 119 Division 1A football coaches as to the nations top rivalry game in college football. The Texas-OU game was ranked third.[44] The game typically has conference or even national significance. Since 1945, one or both of the two teams has been ranked among the top 25 teams in the nation coming into 60 out of 65 games. Twice Texas has defeated the Sooners a record eight straight times from 1940 to 1947 and 1958–1965. One of the most significant meetings was in 1963 with Oklahoma ranked No. 1 and Texas ranked No. 2, the game won by Texas 28–7 en route to their first officially recognized national championship. The series has also had its share of games that came down to the wire and comebacks most recently in 2021 which saw sixth-ranked Sooners rallying from a 21-point first-quarter deficit to edge the 21st-ranked Longhorns 55–48 in the highest-scoring game in the rivalry. The game has also been the result of controversy. The meeting in 1976 was a heated affair as the Oklahoma staff was accused of spying on Texas' practices, a move later confirmed by former OU head coach Barry Switzer. In the 2008 season Texas scored 45 points over then No. 1 Oklahoma for the win, but even with the victory Texas would not go on to the Big 12 Championship game due to BCS rankings. Six of the last ten showings featured one of the participants in the BCS National Championship Game (2000, 2003–2005, 2008, 2009), including national titles won by Oklahoma in 2000 and by Texas in 2005. On October 6, 2018, the Longhorns and Sooners squared off in a Red River Rivalry game that will go down in history. After giving up a 21-point 4th Quarter lead, the Longhorns found themselves tied at 45 with the Sooners with just over two minutes left to play in the game. As the Longhorns began to systematically march down the field, time began to run out. However, a Cameron Dicker 40 yard field goal sealed a 48–45 win for the Longhorns and finally ended the 2-year drought in the Red River Rivalry. In 2022, Texas shut out Oklahoma, beating them 49-0. This was the most dominant win by either side since 2003, and the first shut out since 2004. Texas leads the all-time series 63–51–5 through the 2023 season.[45][46] In 2023 Oklahoma surpassed Texas A&M as UT’s most played football rivalry game. The first meeting between the Texas Longhorns and Texas Tech Matadors (as the team was known until 1937) was in 1928, a 12–0 win for Texas. The teams only faced each other nine times before 1960 with Texas holding an 8–1 record over Tech at the time.[47] From 1960 to 1995, both schools played annually as members of the Southwest Conference. Since 1996, both schools have played as members of the Big 12 Conference.[48] In 1996, the Texas Tech University System was established and the system's first chancellor, John T. Montford, a former member of the Texas State Senate, started the exchange of a traveling trophy between the two universities called the Chancellor's Spurs.[49][50] The spurs are gold and silver and engraved with Texas Tech's Double T and Texas' interlocking UT logo and were first awarded to Texas after a 38–32 victory over the Red Raiders in Lubbock.[50] Texas leads the all-time series 54–18 through the 2023 season.[51] Old Southwest Conference rivals, Texas and Arkansas first met in 1894, a 54–0 win by Texas. In the days of the Southwest Conference, the game between the two schools usually decided which team would win the conference championship. Overall, Texas won the game about 71% of the time, which led to an incredibly fierce and intense rivalry. The two programs have met 79 times and have had many big games. The meeting in 1969 is the true Game of the Century commemorating the 100th year of college football, which led to the Longhorns' 1969 national championship. This game, which is commonly known as \"Dixie's Last Stand\" and The Big Shootout, still does not sit well with Razorback fans to this day.[52] The game saw Arkansas lead throughout only to have Texas come from behind and win in the final minutes, 15–14. The game also saw former President Richard Nixon attend the game and crown the Longhorns the National Champion in the locker room. The Texas-Arkansas game has not been played annually since Arkansas's departure from the Southwest Conference to the Southeastern Conference in 1991. However, many Longhorn and Razorback fans still consider this matchup an important rivalry. Texas and Arkansas played in September 2008, with Texas winning, 52–10. Texas and Arkansas also played in the 2014 Texas Bowl, which Arkansas won, 31–7. Texas and Arkansas played in the 2021 regular season, with Arkansas winning by a score of 40-21. Texas leads the series 57–23 through the 2024 season.[53] The first meeting between the football squads of the University of Texas and Texas A&M was in 1894, a 38–0 win for Texas. In fact, Texas won its first seven games against the Aggies, all of them by shutout. By 1915 Texas held a 15–4–2 advantage against the Aggies. The game was a back and forth affair for the next twenty years as the home team usually took the victory in the game, however Texas still maintained the series lead. In 1940, Texas shutout the Aggies 7–0 and kept them from receiving the Rose Bowl bid that year. From that year forward Texas would go on to win 33 of the next 38 games over A&M. It was not until the mid-1980s that A&M developed a win streak over Texas and in the late 1990s and 2000s the rivalry would again go back to Longhorns.[54] The Texas/Texas A&M rivalry has given rise to several stereotypes on both sides: Texas A&M is generally portrayed as the rural smaller school while Texas is portrayed as the urban-wealthy larger school. With the exception of the 1994 game, when A&M's probation restricted the Aggies from being televised, the annual football game with Texas A&M traditionally takes place on Thanksgiving Day or the day after each year. This iconic in-state rivalry is often considered one of the top college rivalries of all time. In July 2011, Texas A&M elected to join the Southeastern Conference beginning in 2012, which ended of the 118-year consecutive meetings between the two schools. On November 24, 2011, Texas faced Texas A&M in College Station in the final scheduled meeting of the rivalry as of January 2019. Texas defeated Texas A&M 27–25 on a last second field goal to win the final meeting. In an attempt to generate more attention for the rivalry in sports other than football, the two schools created the Lone Star Showdown[55] in 2004. Essentially, each time the two schools meet in a sport, the winner of the matchup gets a point. At the end of the year, the school with the most points wins the series and receives the Lone Star Trophy. Texas leads the series 76–37–5 through the 2023 season.[56] The rivalry will resume when Texas moves to the Southeastern Conference in 2024. Baylor and Texas have played each other 111 times, with the first game between Baylor and Texas being played in 1901. Only Oklahoma and Texas A&M have played Texas more times than Baylor. Both Baylor and Texas were founding members of the Southwest Conference and the BIG 12 Conference. Texas leads the series with Baylor 81-28-4. However, starting in 2010 this rivalry intensified as Baylor established themselves as a major contender in the BIG 12 Conference with Baylor playing for 4 BIG 12 titles and winning 3, including a head-to-head win over Texas to clinch the BIG 12 Championship in 2013, in what is now known as the \"Ice Bowl\".[57] Losing the BIG 12 Title to Baylor 30-10 was Mack Brown's last regular season game as the head coach at Texas. Since 2015, Texas holds a 7-2 edge in the series with Baylor.[58] Texas leads the series with TCU 64–28–1 through the 2023 season.[59] Texas leads the series 75–21–1 through the 2023 season. The teams were conference rivals for 81 seasons in the Southwest Conference from 1915 through 1995.[citation needed] The University of Texas has had 129 Longhorns selected to the College Football All-America Team including 62 Consensus and 25 Unanimous; Texas also has 17 players and coaches that have been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame.[63] Major honors Offensive honors Coaching Honors Defensive honors Other honors As of 2016, the Texas Longhorns have had 570 All-Conference Player selections since 1915, including 292 in the Southwest Conference and 278 in the Big 12 where Longhorn players have been named 78 times to the first team and 65 to the second team.[64] 351 Longhorns have been drafted into the NFL, including 44 in the 1st round.[65]As of August 7, 2024[update], the Longhorns have 44 players active on NFL rosters.[66] Texas has had 22 players and three former coaches inducted into the Hall of Fame. Texas has had 5 players inducted into the NFL Hall of Fame. One former Longhorn was inducted as an NFL head coach. The 1893 team did not always wear orange. They also wore gold and white uniforms. In 1895, the Texas Athletic Association moved to orange and white colors. In 1897, the Association moved to orange and maroon to save cleaning costs. The Cactus Yearbook at the time listed the university colors as either gold or orange and white until the 1899 Cactus declared the university colors to be gold and maroon. Students at the university's medical branch in Galveston (UTMB) were in favor of royal blue. By 1899, a UT fan could have worn any of yellow, orange, white, red, maroon, or even blue.[67] The Board of Regents held an election in that year to decide the team colors. Students, faculty, staff and alumni were asked to vote. 1,111 votes were cast, with 562 in favor of orange and white. Orange and maroon received 310, royal blue 203, crimson 10, and royal blue and crimson 11. For the next 30 years, Longhorn teams wore bright orange on their uniforms, which faded to yellow by the end of the season. By the 1920s, other teams sometimes called the Longhorn squads \"yellow bellies,\" a term that didn't sit well with the athletic department. In 1928, UT football coach Clyde Littlefield ordered uniforms in a darker shade of orange that wouldn't fade, which would later become known as \"burnt orange\" or \"Texas orange.\" The dark-orange color was used until the dye became too expensive during the Great Depression, and the uniforms reverted to the bright orange for another two decades, until coach Darrell K Royal revived the burnt-orange color in the early 1960s.[67] For the 2009 Lone Star Showdown, the Longhorns wore a Nike Pro Combat uniform. From 1961 to 1962, the Longhorns' helmets featured the individual player's number on the side in burnt orange above the \"Bevo\" logo, which was also in burnt orange, with a large burnt-orange stripe down the middle of the helmet. The burnt-orange stripe was removed in 1963 and the helmet featured only the burnt-orange Bevo logo below the player's number, which was also in burnt orange. In 1967, the team abandoned the individual player's number above the logo, and moved the burnt-orange Bevo logo to the center of the helmet's side. With the exception of the 1969 season, this remained the team's helmet design until 1977. In 1969, the helmet design commemorated the 100th anniversary of the first college football game. The player's number was replaced by a large burnt-orange football above the Bevo logo. Inside the football was a white number \"100\" that indicated the anniversary year. The University of Texas is a tradition-rich school, and many of those traditions are associated with athletics events, especially football. Some Longhorn traditions include: The Texas football program joined the SEC in 2024. The conference expanded to 16 teams.[73] Only the 2024 conference schedule was announced on June 14, 2023, while the conference still considers a new format for the future.[74] Announced schedules as of June 25, 2023.[76][77] This is subject to change based on Texas' future move to the SEC. As part of the agreement allowing Texas and Oklahoma to move from the Big 12 to the SEC in 2024, instead of 2025, the sites of the home-and-home series with Michigan, originally scheduled to be at Texas in 2024, and at Michigan in 2027, were reversed, giving Fox the right to broadcast the 2024 game at Michigan.[78] Texas Football's recruiting department is led by Billy Glasscock.[79] Glasscock came from NC State in 2021 as director of player personnel, leading a team of staffers and interns in a combination of duties between recruiting and player personnel. On the recruiting side, Taylor Searels[80] directs everything from an events standpoint to accommodate recruiting visits. In player personnel, JM Jones and Austin Shelton[81] are assistant directors of player personnel, handling offense and defense respectively. They manage a team of recruiting assistants that all manage a position and report to their position coach. This recruiting assistant program has been a robust program that has seen the likes of Daniel Bernstein - EDGE, Julian Rowe-Cohen - TEs, Maxwell Solman - OL, Jacob De Santos - DB, Jake Warren - WR, and Tanner Martin - QBs come through. Their jobs were to identify recruits, evaluate them, and bring them to their position coaches if they are deemed worth watching and offering. These are the individuals that found most of the players on the team before anyone else.",

                "content": "The Texas Longhorns are the athletic teams representing the University of Texas at Austin. The teams are sometimes referred to as the Horns and take their name from Longhorn cattle that were an important part of the development of Texas, and are now the official \"large animal\" of the state of Texas.[2] Generally, both the men's and women's teams are referred to as the Longhorns, and the mascot is a Texas Longhorn steer named Bevo. The Longhorns have consistently been ranked as the biggest brand in collegiate athletics, in both department size and breadth of appeal. The Longhorn nickname had begun appearing in Texas newspapers by 1900.[3] The University of Texas at Austin is the flagship institution of the University of Texas System. It offers a wide variety of varsity and intramural sports programs, and was selected as \"America's Best Sports College\" in a 2002 analysis by Sports Illustrated. Texas was also listed as the number one Collegiate Licensing Company client from 2005 to 2013 in regards to the amount of annual trademark royalties received from the sales of its fan merchandise.[4] Until Athletic Director Chris Del Conte altered the organizational structure of the athletic department in 2017,[5] Texas was the only remaining NCAA Division I school to operate separate men's and women's athletic departments, after the other remaining holdout, the University of Tennessee,[6] merged its men's and women's athletic departments at the end of the 2011–12 academic year.[7] A charter member of the Southwest Conference until its dissolution in 1996, the Texas Longhorns competed in the Big 12 Conference until 2024. The Texas Longhorns joined the Southeastern Conference for the 2024–2025 season with the University of Oklahoma for a reported $100 million,[8] as a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association. The school's colors are officially Orange (Pantone 159) and White, with Burnt Orange — also known as Texas Orange – being the specific shade of orange used.[9][10] The University of Texas Longhorn Band performs the alma mater as well as the university fight song (\"Texas Fight\") at various sporting events. Over the years, Longhorn sports teams have won 56 total national championships,[11] 47 of which are NCAA National Championships.[12] The University of Texas currently fields a varsity team in nine men's sports and 12 women's sports.[13] In 1992, seven women athletes representing club-level rowing, soccer and gymnastics and intramural softball, organized by the rowing club coach, sued the university in U.S. District Court charging them with Title IX violations. At the time there were more men on the football team than there were varsity-level women athletes. In July 1993 Texas settled the lawsuit, agreeing to add women's rowing, soccer and softball; and agreeing to devote more than 44 percent of its varsity athletic roster spots and more than 42 percent of its athletic scholarship money to women. Women's soccer was added in 1993, softball in 1995 and rowing in 1997.[14] Two Texas Longhorn running backs have won college football's most prestigious individual award, the Heisman Trophy: Earl Campbell (1977) and Ricky Williams (1998). Seventeen Longhorn players and two Longhorn coaches have been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame,[15] while four are enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.[16] Other Longhorn players have also received recognition for their performance. In terms of total wins, Texas is the 2nd-ranked NCAA Division I FBS program in college football history with 891 wins, after passing Nebraska during the 2016 season. As of the end of the 2016 season, the Longhorns' all-time record is 891–359–33 (.709). Only the University of Michigan has won more games and a greater percentage of games played than Texas,[17] which recorded its 800th victory with the Longhorns' 41–38 win over the USC Trojans in the 2006 BCS National Championship Game at the Rose Bowl. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, the program was somewhat less successful, but the Longhorns have since returned to prominence in college football, finishing in the top six of the AP and coaches' polls in 2001, 2002, 2004, 2005, 2008 and 2009. The University of Texas team plays home games in Darrell K Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium which has a seating capacity of 100,119.[18] Renovations began on the stadium November 14, 2005, two days following the last home football game of the 2005 season. The improvements were completed before the 2008 football season, and included additional seating[19] and the nation's first high definition video display in a collegiate facility nicknamed \"Godzillatron.\"[20] The university completed a $27 million expansion and renovation to the south end zone facilities in August 2009 which added 4,525 permanent bleacher seats and changed the playing surface to FieldTurf. With the new permanent bleacher seating section added behind the south end zone and the total remodeling of the north end zone completed in 2008, the stadium's official capacity now stands at 100,119. This was surpassed when 101,357[21] saw #3-ranked Texas beat Kansas 51–20[22] on November 21, 2009. The University of Texas began varsity intercollegiate competition in men's basketball in 1906.[23] The Longhorns rank 18th in total victories among all NCAA Division I college basketball programs and 25th in all-time win percentage among programs with at least 60 years in Division I, with an all-time win–loss record of 1791–1088 (.622).[24] Among Big 12 Conference men's basketball programs, Texas is second only to Kansas in both all-time wins and all-time win percentage.[24] The Longhorns have won 27 total conference championships in men's basketball and have made 34 total appearances in the NCAA tournament (11th-most appearances all time, with a 35–37 overall record),[25] reaching the NCAA Final Four three times (1943, 1947, 2003) and the NCAA regional finals (Elite Eight) seven times.[26][27] As of the end of the 2017–18 season, Texas ranks sixth among all Division I men's basketball programs for total NCAA Tournament games won without having won the national championship (35), trailing Kansas State (37), Notre Dame (38), Purdue (39), Illinois (40), and Oklahoma (41).[25][28] The Longhorns have also won 2 NIT championships, in 1978 and 2019. Texas's best season is arguably the 1932–33 season when the team went 22–1, won the Southwest Conference and was named unofficial National Champion by the Premo-Porretta Power Poll. Since the introduction of the AP poll, Texas's best season was 2002-2003 when it went 26–7, earned a #1 seed in the NCAA tournament, made it as far as the Final Four and finished the season ranked #3 in the AP poll. The 2005–06 season marked the 100th anniversary of basketball at the University of Texas. Special logos were placed on the uniforms to commemorate this anniversary. In 2007, the men's basketball team was ranked sixth by the Harris Poll for favorite men's college basketball teams, moving up one spot from the previous year.[29] The women's basketball team has long been a national power, especially during the late 1980s (winning a national title in 1986) and through the 1990s. Both teams play home games in the Moody Center. The adjacent Denton A. Cooley Pavilion serves as the training and practice facility for both the men's and women's teams. The Texas Longhorns are the winningest team in college baseball history, both in terms of total wins and in terms of win percentage.[citation needed] Texas holds the records for most appearances in the College World Series (35) and most individual CWS games won. The Longhorns have won six NCAA baseball national championships (1949, 1950, 1975, 1983, 2002, and 2005) — second only to Southern California's total of 12 – and have appeared in the CWS Championship Game or Championship Series on six other occasions (1953, 1984, 1985, 1989, 2004, and 2009). Former Longhorns who have gone on to success in Major League Baseball include Roger Clemens, Bibb Falk, Ron Gardenhire, Calvin Schiraldi, Burt Hooton, Keith Moreland, Spike Owen, Greg Swindell, Huston Street, Omar Quintanilla, Taylor Teagarden, Sam LeCure and Drew Stubbs. From 1997 to 2016, the Longhorns were led by head coach Augie Garrido, the winningest coach in NCAA baseball history.[31] The team plays its home games at Disch-Falk Field. The University of Texas Longhorn's softball team was founded in 1995 as part of its 1993 Title IX settlement. It is currently led by head coach Mike White and assistant coaches Kerry Shaw and Chelsea Spencer. Texas has made 20 total appearances in the NCAA Tournament in 23 seasons of varsity competition, reaching the Women's College World Series (WCWS) five times (1998, 2003, 2005, 2006, 2013) and finishing as high as 3rd on three occasions (2003, 2005 and 2013). The University of Texas has a strong golf tradition, dating back to their first season in 1927. Since then they have won national titles back-to-back in 1971 and 1972 and again in 2012, and finished runner-up six other times (1949, 1983, 1989, 1994, 2016, 2019). Individual national champions were Ed White (1935), Ben Crenshaw (1971, 1972, and 1973), Tom Kite (1972), and Justin Leonard (1994). Longhorns who have won the U.S. Amateur include Justin Leonard and David Gossett. Two-time U.S. Junior Amateur champion and three-time major winner Jordan Spieth played for the Longhorns golf team in 2011 and 2012. In 2022, Longhorn alum Scottie Scheffler won the Masters Tournament and reached World No.1 in the Official World Golf Ranking in March 2022. Besides Majors-winners Kite, Crenshaw, Leonard and Spieth, a number of other former Longhorn players have gone on to win on the PGA Tour, including: Phil Blackmar, Mark Brooks, Jhonattan Vegas, Bob Estes, Wes Ellis, Harrison Frazar, Cody Gribble, Rik Massengale, Wes Short Jr., and Brandel Chamblee. In addition, Longhorns Brandon Stone and Dylan Frittelli have each achieved multiple wins on the European Tour. Legendary golf instructor Harvey Penick was a long-time coach at Texas. The team is currently coached by John Fields.[32] The women's golf team has been to the NCAA Championship 27 times, tied for 7th overall and finished as the runner-up, or tied for runner-up, twice, in 1993 and 2002. As of 2019, they have finished in the top 5 eight times, most recently in 2019 (t-5th) and 2003 (3rd). In 2019 Texas won its first NCAA Regional in school history and was the stroke play medalist at the NCAA Championship. Texas women have won three individual championships. In 1978 Deborah Petrizzi won the AIAW national intercollegiate individual golf championship; and Charlotta Sörenstam and Heather Bowie won in 1993 and 1997 respectively. Former players Betsy Rawls and Sherri Steinhauer went on to win 8 and 2 LPGA major championships respectively, with Rawls being inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame. Tennis was played at The University of Texas as early as 1884, although it was not until 1909 that intercollegiate competition developed. Between that time and the advent of the Southwest Conference in 1915, Texas and Oklahoma annually held a meet for the championship of the Southwest. The first season of Texas Men's Tennis was in 1912. Since forming, the Men's Tennis team has won 17 Southwest Conference Championships, 5 Big 12 Championships and the 2019 NCAA Championship.[33] Texas teams have reached the NCAA Championship semifinals five times (1993, 2006, 2008, 2009 and 2019) and prior to the formation of the tournament when the final standings were determined by a poll, the Longhorns finished fourth or better five times, including 1946 (4th), 1952 (tie 4th), 1955 (2nd), 1957 (3rd), and 1960 (tie 4th).[34] In March 2019 tennis head coach Michael Center was arrested and charged with conspiracy to commit mail fraud as part of the 2019 college admissions bribery scandal.[35] Despite losing their head coach to scandal just two months earlier, the Texas Men's Tennis team won its first ever NCAA tennis championship over Wake Forest in May 2019. [36] The women's Longhorns tennis team began play in 1978, and since then has won 4 NCAA Championships (1993, 1995, 2021, 2022), 23 regular-season conference titles (three shared), 12 Big 12 tournaments and all 9 SWC tournament championships. They were also the NCAA runner-up in 1992 and 2005.[37] The men's program is coached by Edrick Floréal. The Longhorns were runners-up in the outdoor championships in 1987, 1988, and 1997 but have never won a title. Other notable coaches of the Texas men's program have included Bubba Thornton, who also coached the 2008 US Olympic team, Stan Huntsman (1986–95), who also coached the 1988 US Olympic team, and Clyde Littlefield (Texas coach, 1920–60), the 1925 co-founder of the annual Texas Relays. The men won four consecutive Big 12 Indoor Championships between 2006 and 2009. The men have won 41 individual titles, 10th most of all schools. The Longhorn track and field programs have produced numerous Olympians for various nations. Male medalists include Ryan Crouser (United States, gold, shot put, 2016), Leonel Manzano (United States, silver, 1500 meters, 2012), Winthrop Graham (Jamaica, silver, 400m hurdles, 1992 and 4 × 400 m relay, 1988), Patrick Sang (Kenya, silver, 3000m steeplechase, 1992), Du'aine Ladejo (Great Britain, bronze, 4 × 400 m relay, 1992), Lam Jones (USA, gold, 4 × 100 m relay, 1976), Eddie Southern (USA, silver, 400m hurdles, 1956), and Dean Smith (sprinter) (USA, gold, 4 × 100 m relay, 1952). The women's program is coached by Edrick Floréal. Other notable coaches have included Beverly Kearney, who guided the Lady Longhorns to six NCAA Championships: Indoor Championships in 1998, 1999, and 2006, and Outdoor Championships in 1998, 1999, and 2005; and Terry Crawford, whose teams won Indoor Championships in 1986, 1988, and 1990, and Outdoor Championships in 1982 and 1986. Crawford's athletes also won the 1986 Women's Cross Country Championship. The program's first title was the 1982 AIAW outdoor track and field championship. The Longhorn track and field programs have produced numerous Olympians for various nations. Female Olympic medalists have included Michelle Carter (athlete) (USA, gold, shot put, 2016), Sanya Richards-Ross (2012: USA, gold, 400 meters and 4 x 400 meter relay; 2008, bronze, 400 meters and gold, 4 x 400 meter relay, 2008), Moushami Robinson (USA, gold, 4 × 400 meter relay, 2004), Sandie Richards (Jamaica, silver, 4 × 400 m relay, 2000 and 2004), Merlene Frazer (Jamaica, silver, 4 × 100 m relay, 2000), Nanceen Perry (USA, bronze, 4 × 100 m relay, 2000), Carlette Guidry (USA, gold, 4 × 100 m relay, 1992 and 1996), Juliet Cuthbert (Jamaica, silver, 100m and 200m, 1992 and bronze, 4 × 100 m relay, 1996), and Nikole Mitchell (Jamaica, bronze, 4 × 100 m relay, 1996). Courtney Okolo became the first Longhorn to win The Bowerman,[38] an award that honors collegiate track & field's most outstanding athlete of the year. In 2016, she became the first female collegian to run sub-50 seconds in the 400 meters, in turn lowering her own collegiate record to 49.71. Her senior season also included an undefeated record against collegians and four NCAA titles (two individual, two relay). The men's cross country team has 33 Southwest Conference championships and has placed as high as 3rd in the NCAA Men's Division I Cross Country Championship. The 1956 individual championship was won by Walter McNew with a time of 19:55.94.[39] The women's cross country team has 4 Southwest Conference championships and won the 1986 NCAA Cross Country Championship. Texas won the 1988, 2012, 2022, and 2023 NCAA National Championships, with runner-up finishes in 1995, 2009, 2015, 2016 and 2020. They also won an AIAW national championship in 1981. The team is currently coached by Jerritt Elliott and plays home games in Gregory Gymnasium. Texas won the Big 12 Conference in 1997, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023. They finished 2nd in 1996, 1998, 2004, 2005, 2010, and 2016. They finished 3rd in 1999 and 2006. They have qualified for every NCAA tournament since 2004 and advanced to at least the Regional Finals since 2006. Texas volleyball has produced many All-Americans, and in 2007, they won the program's first Big 12 title since 1997, sharing the title with Nebraska. Texas broke Nebraska's three-year streak of winning the title outright. They also earned the programs first AVCA National Freshman of the Year since 1995 in 2007, for Big 12 Freshman of the Year Juliann Faucette, and Logan Eggleston won the program's first ever AVCA National Player of the Year award in 2022. Texas has won fifteen national titles in men's swimming and diving (1981, 1988–1991, 1996, 2000–2002, 2010, 2015–18, 2021) and nine in women's swimming and diving (1981–82, 1984–88, 1990–91), making swimming and diving the most successful Texas athletics program by far, based on number of national titles. The women's swimming team is currently coached by Carol Capitani, and the men's and women's diving teams are coached by Matt Scoggin. The men's swimming team has been coached by Eddie Reese since 1978. In 2021, Reese retired after 43 years as the Texas men's head coach. When a successful replacement was not named, Reese returned to the Head Coach position. Reese has coached numerous former and current world record holders while at Texas, including many competing in the Summer Olympic Games for the United States and other home nations. The swim team was first developed under Coach Tex Robertson.[40] The women's rowing team was established in the fall of 1998 as the result of the 1993 Title IX settlement.[41] At the team's first appearance at the NCAA championships in 2003, its varsity 8 placed 12th nationally. The team won the inaugural Big 12 Championship in 2009 and kept the championship title for the following three years. Additionally, the Texas women's rowing team won the 2011 Conference USA Championship. In June 2014, Dave O'Neill was appointed head coach of the program.[42] Under his coaching, the women's rowing team placed fourth in the 2017 NCAA Championship, third in 2018, second in 2019, and first in 2021, marking the program's best four finishes.[43] The Texas women's soccer program was established in 1993 as part of that year's Title IX settlement. Since then they have won 3 conference championships - one regular season and two tournaments — and been to 13 NCAA tournaments, making it as far as the Sweet Sixteen in 2004, 2006, 2007 and 2017. In 2006 the Longhorns finished ranked #8 in the nation, their highest end-of-season ranking ever.[44] Founded in 1985, the Texas Longhorns rugby team plays in the Allied Rugby Conference, and plays its postseason in the Varsity Cup Championship. The Longhorns rugby program has been improving in recent years.[45] Texas rugby has instituted a combine to identify the most elite athletes on campus with an eye towards recruiting them to play rugby.[46] The increasing popularity of rugby in the United States and the announcement that rugby would return to the Summer Olympics led Texas to upgrade the designation of its rugby program from club to Olympic.[47] The Texas Rugby Alumni association and the Texas Exes have begun an endowment to award scholarships to Texas rugby players, which is viewed as a vital recruitment tool.[48] The Longhorns' improvement led to Texas winning the Southwest Conference in the 2011–12 season to qualify for the sweet sixteen of the 2012 national championship playoffs.[49] Texas won the 2012 Southwest 7s tournament to qualify for the 2012 USA Rugby Sevens Collegiate National Championships.[50] The Longhorns rugby program has been boosted by its participation in the Collegiate Rugby Championship, the highest profile college rugby competition in the US, which is broadcast live on NBC. In the 2011 CRC, Texas defeated Big 12 rival Oklahoma to reach the quarterfinals. Following Texas's participation in the 2011 CRC, Texas \"raised an additional $10,000 from alumni, landed a new apparel sponsor, and have been contacted by 90 students (including two DBs from the football team) who want to play rugby.\"[51] In the 2012 CRC, Texas defeated its rival Oklahoma to again reach the quarterfinals of the tournament. The Longhorns rugby program reached a new all-time high during the 2013–2014 season. Texas won the 2013 Southwest Conference 7s Championship advancing them to the 2013 USA Rugby Sevens Collegiate National Championships, where they finished ranked #12 in the nation.[52] Months later Texas won the 2014 Southwest Conference 15s Championship, making them the first team in the conference to win both the 7s and 15s championships in the same season. The Longhorns finished the season with their first participation in The Varsity Cup Championship, where they finished in the top 8.[53] Texas has won 58 NCAA team national championships.[56] Below are 9 national team titles that were not bestowed by the NCAA: [58][59] * Denotes shared conference title † Denotes an AIAW Championship. The University of Texas began NCAA and Southwest Conference competition in women's sports for the 1982–83 season. The university's biggest rival is Texas A&M University.[60][61] However, in football, Texas considers the Oklahoma Sooners to be a more significant rival. According to Bill Little, the Longhorns' assistant athletic director, the rivalry against A&M is \"based on respect\", while the rivalry against Oklahoma is \"based on anger\".[62] Other teams have also been considered to be rivals of the Longhorns in various sports.[63][64][65][66] This list includes several other colleges in Texas, such as Texas Christian, Baylor, Rice,[67] Texas Tech,[68] and Houston.[69] Texas is also one of the biggest rivals of the University of Arkansas,[70] which may be attributed to their long tenure as the two eponymous state schools of the former Southwest Conference, or to the 1969 game between the two, which decided the national championship in favor of the Longhorns.[71][72] Texas has a long-standing, bitter rivalry with the University of Oklahoma. The football game between the University of Texas and Oklahoma is commonly known as the \"Red River Shootout\" and is held annually in Dallas, Texas, at the Cotton Bowl. This name has come to refer to the two schools' contests in other major team sports as well. Since 2005, the football game has received sponsorship dollars in return for being referred to as the \"SBC Red River Rivalry\"[73] (changed to AT&T Red River Rivalry in 2006 when SBC changed its corporate name to AT&T), a move which has been criticized both for its commercialism[74] and its political correctness.[75] In recent years,[when?] this rivalry has taken on added significance, since both football programs have been highly ranked and compete in the same division of the Big 12 conference. In 2005, The Dallas Morning News did an opinion poll of the 119 Division 1A football coaches as to the nations top rivalry game in college football. The Texas–Oklahoma game was ranked third.[76] The annual football game with Texas A&M usually took place on the weekend of Thanksgiving each year, though it was moved to the first weekend in December in 1994 due to A&M's TV restriction during probation. In either case, the Texas-Texas A&M game was the last regular-season contest for each team. The Longhorns lead the series, 76–37–5. In an attempt to generate more attention for the rivalry in sports other than football, in 2004 the two schools started the Lone Star Showdown,[77] which began as a two-year trial program and has continued ever since. Essentially, each time the two schools meet in a sport, the winner of the matchup gets a point. In sports wherein the teams meet twice one half point is awarded for a victory. If more contests than two occur, such as in baseball, the series winner gets one point. At the end of the year, the school with the most points wins the series and receives a trophy. In the event of a tie the current holder retains the trophy as did A&M after the '08–'09 season. Texas leads the series 6–2. Aspects of the rivalry include: With Texas A&M's move to the Southeastern Conference, the Lone Star Showdown's final game was played on November 24, 2011, at Kyle Field. The Longhorns won, 27–25, on a last-second field goal. The 2011 game marked the end of a 118-year Thanksgiving Day tradition. With the Longhorns set to join the Southeastern Conference no later than July 1, 2024, the rivalry will resume as a conference game. The Longhorns and Red Raiders football teams compete annually for a traveling trophy called the Chancellor's Spurs. The exchange began in 1996, and the Longhorns lead the football series, 55–18. A long-standing and historic rivalry with the Rice Owls, which has been largely dominated by Texas, has been played since 1914. The game is still played frequently, with Texas winning the latest matchup 37–10 (2023). The Owls most recent victory in the rivalry came in 1994 when they won 19–17 at Rice Stadium, they would also go on to win the Southwest Conference that year. There are currently no future games scheduled in the series.[87] Major sporting facilities and their main uses include: In addition, the University of Texas has numerous practice, training, and intramural facilities. The University of Texas many traditions which associated with athletics events, especially football. Some Longhorn traditions include: For nine straight years (2005–2013), Texas was listed as the number one Collegiate Licensing Company client in regards to the amount of annual trademark royalties received from the sales of its fan merchandise.[4] Schools that are not members of Collegiate Licensing Company however are not ranked in the listing.[94] Money from merchandising sales goes to the university, as opposed to being earmarked specifically for athletics programs.[4] On January 20, 2011, the UT athletic department announced plans to launch a 24-hour channel devoted entirely to UT sports and academic activities at the University of Texas.[95] This channel, a joint venture with ESPN, takes advantage of a clause in new Big 12 Conference television contracts allowing Texas a bigger share of revenues than the conference's other members; in turn, it was part of the agreement to keep the conference together amidst a full-scale plan by the Pac-10 Conference to raid Big 12 members. (The Pac-10 only gained one Big 12 school, Colorado). Both sides hoped to launch the channel for the 2011–2012 academic year, but needed carriage commitments first. Banners with the name \"ESPN Texas\" were visible during segments of SportsCenter and other programs originating from Sundance Square in Fort Worth, Texas in the week prior to Super Bowl XLV. The channel was launched in August 2011 as the Longhorn Network. Before its launch, the network had controversial plans to air high school football games, an institution throughout the state of Texas. Currently, the state's governing body for public high school sports, the University Interscholastic League, prohibits live game telecasts on Friday nights. It had also been speculated that any telecast on the new channel, regardless of when it aired, could violate NCAA rules against unfair recruiting inducements.[96] This was especially an issue for Texas A&M; in fact, the plans for the network to air high school games directly led to A&M's decision in July 2011 to leave the Big 12 for the SEC.[97] The Big 12 then approved a temporary rule in August 2011 banning the planned high school telecasts,[98] and within two weeks, the NCAA ruled that no school or conference network could broadcast high school games, ending that particular controversy.[99][100] The University of Texas is known to have a big group of powerful boosters that help support a third of the budget of the athletics department.[101] The main people known to be involved are:",

                "title": "Josh Groban - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Joshua Winslow Groban (born February 27, 1981)[1] is an American singer, songwriter, and actor. His first four solo albums have been certified multi-platinum, and he was charted in 2007 as the number-one best selling artist in the United States, with over 22.3 million records.[2][3] As of 2022[update], he had sold over 25 million records worldwide.[4] Groban originally studied acting, but moved to singing as his voice developed. He attended the Los Angeles County High School for the Arts, a free public school on the campus of California State University, Los Angeles, where students receive a conservatory-style education.[5] David Foster called him to stand in for Andrea Bocelli to rehearse a duet, \"The Prayer\", with Celine Dion at the rehearsal for the 1999 Grammy Awards.[6] Rosie O'Donnell immediately invited him to appear on her talk show.[7] Foster asked him to sing at California Governor Gray Davis' 1999 inauguration.[5][8] He was cast on Ally McBeal by the show's creator, David E. Kelley, performing \"You're Still You\", later released on his debut album, for the 2001 season four finale.[9] After his appearance in two professional productions of Chess, he made his Broadway debut in 2016 as Pierre Bezukhov in the musical Natasha, Pierre & The Great Comet of 1812, to critical acclaim and a Tony Award nomination. In 2018, he received two Primetime Emmy Award nominations for his performance at the 72nd Tony Awards, and starred in the limited series The Good Cop. He also appeared in television series and films, such as Crazy, Stupid, Love and Muppets Most Wanted. In 2022, Groban portrayed the Beast in the television special Beauty and the Beast: A 30th Celebration. He returned to Broadway in 2023 playing the title character in a revival of Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, for which he earned his second Tony Award nomination. Groban was born in Los Angeles, California, to Jack Groban, a businessman, and Lindy Groban (née Johnston), a school teacher.[10] His father is a descendant of Jewish immigrants from Poland and Ukraine,[11][12] but converted to Christianity from Judaism upon marrying his mother.[13] His mother's ancestry is English, German, Norwegian, and one quarter Ashkenazi Jewish.[14][15][16][12] His parents are Episcopalians. Groban first sang in public when he was in the seventh grade. His music teacher chose him to sing a solo of \"S'wonderful\" at the school's cabaret night, where he sang alone on stage for the first time.[17] At this time, he was more focused on acting, playing Tevye in his high school's production of Fiddler on the Roof.[7] In the summers of 1997 and 1998, he also attended the Interlochen Center for the Arts Camp in Michigan,[11] majoring in musical theater, and began taking vocal lessons. He went on to attend the Los Angeles County High School for the Arts as a theater major and graduated in 1999.[11] He was admitted to and briefly attended Carnegie Mellon University, intent on studying musical theater. Four months into his first semester, Groban was offered a recording contract and left college to pursue a singing career.[11] In late 1997, the 16-year-old Groban was introduced by his vocal coach, Seth Riggs, to producer and arranger David Foster and future manager Brian Avnet.[18][failed verification] At the time, Groban had no recording experience and was preparing for his studies at Carnegie Mellon.[18] Groban worked for David Foster as a rehearsal singer on a series of high-profile events, including the January 1999 California gubernatorial inauguration of Gray Davis and the 1999 Grammy Awards where—as a stand-in for Andrea Bocelli—he rehearsed Foster's \"The Prayer\" with Céline Dion. According to Avnet, Groban was very nervous about standing in for Bocelli and had to be talked into it; his performance prompted the show hostess, Rosie O'Donnell, to ask him to appear on her show the following week, which in turn led to an appearance on Ally McBeal.[18] Creator David E. Kelley wrote the character Malcolm Wyatt for Groban in the season finale, aired in May 2001. His performance, including the song \"You're Still You\", was so popular that the show received upwards of 8,000 emails from viewers.[19] The song was included on his eponymous debut album, released in November 2001. Groban was asked to return the next season to reprise his role as Wyatt, performing \"To Where You Are\", airing just two weeks after his debut album was released. Avnet claims this sequence of events effectively got Groban's career off the ground.[18] Groban was offered a recording contract at Warner Bros. Records through Foster's 143 Records imprint. Avnet told HitQuarters that Warner Bros. initially proved resistant to the deal because \"They were afraid they wouldn't be able to get a voice like that on radio.\"[18] Explaining his reasons for signing the artist, Foster said: \"I love his natural ability in the pop and rock arena, but I love his sense of classics even more. He's a true musical force to be reckoned with.\"[19] Under Foster's influence, Groban's first album focused more on classics such as \"Gira Con Me Questa Notte\" and \"Alla Luce Del Sole\". Groban performed \"There For Me\" with Sarah Brightman on her 2000–01 La Luna World Tour, and was featured on her \"La Luna\" concert DVD. He recorded \"For Always\" with Lara Fabian for the movie soundtrack of A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001). Groban performed in many benefit shows, including \"The Andre Agassi Grand Slam Event For Children,\" alongside Elton John, Stevie Wonder, Don Henley, and Robin Williams; \"Muhammad Ali's Fight Night Foundation\" which honored Michael J. Fox and others; \"The Family Celebration\" (2001), which was co-hosted by President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, and David E. Kelley and Michelle Pfeiffer; and Michael Milken's CapCure event, which raised funds for cancer research. His self-titled debut album Josh Groban was released on November 20, 2001. Over the next year it went from gold to double-platinum.[20] On February 24, 2002, Groban performed \"The Prayer\" with Charlotte Church at the closing ceremonies of the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, and by November, he had his own PBS special titled \"Josh Groban In Concert\" (2002). In December 2002, he performed \"To Where You Are\" and sang \"The Prayer\" in a duet with Sissel Kyrkjebø at the Nobel Peace Prize Concert in Oslo, Norway. He joined The Corrs, Ronan Keating, Sting, Lionel Richie, and others for a Christmas performance at the Vatican. In 2003, Groban performed at the David Foster concert for World Children's Day, singing \"The Prayer\" with Celine Dion and the finale song, \"Aren't They All Our Children?\" with artists including Yolanda Adams, Nick Carter, Enrique Iglesias, and Celine Dion. Groban's second album Closer, produced and written by Foster, was released on November 11, 2003. Groban said he believed that this album was a better reflection of him, and his audience would be able to get a better idea of his personality from listening to it. What most people know about me, they know through my music. This time, I've tried to open that door as wide as possible. These songs are a giant step closer to who I really am and what my music is all about. Hence the title.[19] Two months after Closer was released, it rose on the Billboard charts from number 11 to number one.[21] Groban's cover of \"You Raise Me Up\" became his third most popular song on the adult contemporary charts as of March 2004. Later that year, he also performed the song \"Remember\" (with Tanja Tzarovska) on the Troy soundtrack, \"Believe\" on the soundtrack to the 2004 animated film The Polar Express and a cover of Linkin Park's \"My December\". In the summer of 2004, Groban returned to Interlochen, performing and discussing his earlier experiences with local residents and campers. On November 30, 2004, his second live DVD, Live At The Greek, was released; it was also shown as a Great Performances special on PBS. That same year, Groban performed \"Remember When It Rained\", backed by a full orchestra, at the American Music Awards, where he was nominated for Favorite Male Artist in the pop category; he was also nominated for a People's Choice Award. His recording of \"Believe\" secured an Academy Award nomination in 2005 for the songwriters Glen Ballard and Alan Silvestri,[22] and earned them a Grammy in the category Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media at the ceremony held in February 2006.[23] Groban earned his first Grammy nomination in 2005 for his single \"You Raise Me Up\" in the Best Male Pop Vocal Performance category. During the first week of September 2006, Groban's single entitled \"You Are Loved (Don't Give Up)\" was released exclusively on AOL's First Listen. His third studio album Awake was officially released on November 7, 2006. Groban performed \"You Are Loved (Don't Give Up)\" as well as two other tracks from Awake at his recording session for Live from Abbey Road at Abbey Road Studios on October 26, 2006. On that album, Groban also collaborated on the single \"Now or Never\" with British musician and songwriter Imogen Heap. He performed two tracks with the South African group Ladysmith Black Mambazo, \"Lullaby\" and \"Weeping\". Groban's \"Awake\" world tour visited 71 cities between February and August 2007, and toured Australia and the Philippines with Lani Misalucha as his special guest in October 2007. He performed a duet with Barbra Streisand (\"All I Know of Love\") and with Mireille Mathieu (\"Over the Rainbow\"). As to his future, Groban was open to a plethora of possibilities. He said, \"I am fortunate enough to have had many really big moments in my career. I think the mistake a lot of people in my position make is to always search for the next big thing. I am looking forward to playing some small theaters. I'm looking forward to writing more. I want to delve further into my acting career and explore some of the film and TV opportunities that I haven't had time for. My outlook is to expect the unexpected. And when the next step comes, I'm prepared to take it.\"[9] Groban finished his fifth studio album, entitled Illuminations, and the album was released on November 15, 2010.[24] Most of the songs on the album are about \"specific situations that I've had where love has existed and ultimately failed,\" Groban told The New York Times, adding: \"And other songs are about the quest, and it just not working out.\" Groban wrote 11 of the 13 songs on the album.[25] The first single from the album, \"Hidden Away\", was made available for free download via Facebook on September 8.[26] \"For me to sit in a room with a piano in one take with some of Johnny Cash's musicians—that was totally new for me.\" Josh added. \"and I think that excitement is on the record.\"[25] On October 12, a second single from the upcoming album, \"Você Existe Em Mim\", was made available on iTunes.[27] This song is sung in Portuguese and was written by Brazilian artist Carlinhos Brown. The Washington Post said: \"Illuminations\" is not a revelation, but it offers a perfectly fine, and often quite lovely, glimpse at a pop-classical crossover artist in the middle of crossing over.\"[28] Groban plans on making one more record with Rick Rubin.[29] Beginning May 12, 2011, and continuing through December of that year, Groban undertook the 81-city Straight to You Tour to promote Illuminations, encompassing appearances in North America, Europe, and South Africa.[30] Groban's sixth studio album, All That Echoes, was released on February 5, 2013, debuting at number one by selling 141,000 copies.[31][32] Groban promoted the album with the All That Echoes World Tour in 2013. A year later, he embarked on his Summer Symphony Tour.[33] In early March 2015, Josh Groban's Facebook page announced the release of the album Stages, consisting of covers of songs from Broadway musicals. The album was released on April 28, 2015.[34] Starting October 18, 2016, Groban performed on Broadway as Pierre Bezukhov in Natasha, Pierre & The Great Comet of 1812, an electropop opera by composer Dave Malloy based on War and Peace.[35] The production was nominated for twelve Tony Awards. For his performance as Pierre, Groban was nominated for the 2017 Tony Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role in a Musical. His final performance as Pierre was on July 2, 2017 with Malloy replacing him for a week before Okieriete Onaodowan took over the role.[36] In 2017, he released a book titled STAGE to STAGE, My Journey to Broadway. The book detailed the creation of his album and tour, Stages, as well as preparing and performing in The Great Comet of 1812. The book featured pictures both on and off stage from his performances in Stages and Great Comet, as well as messages from Groban and Malloy.[37][38] Groban also performed the song \"Evermore\" during the end credits of the 2017 Disney film Beauty and the Beast.[39] On March 12, 2018, tour dates were announced for Groban's Bridges Tour with special guest Idina Menzel. The US leg of the tour began on October 18, 2018, in Duluth, Georgia and concluded at Madison Square Garden in New York City on November 18. The European leg of the tour began on December 12 at the O2 Arena in London and concluded on December 18 in Poland.[40] On June 26, 2018, Groban announced via social media that his album Bridges would be released on September 21 and would contain a cover of Céline Dion's song \"S'il suffisait d'aimer\" along with new tracks.[41] The album debuted at number two in the US[42] and in the top 10 in the UK[43] and Scotland.[44] Groban released his studio album Harmony on November 20, 2020. In December 2022, Groban portrayed The Beast in the television special Beauty and the Beast: A 30th Celebration, for which he sang Evermore again.[45] Groban returned to Broadway in the title role in a revival of Stephen Sondheim’s musical Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, opposite Annaleigh Ashford as Mrs. Lovett and Jordan Fisher as Anthony Hope, directed by Thomas Kail. The production officially opened on March 26, 2023 (with previews having begun on February 26) at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre; it received positive reviews,[46] and was nominated for eight Tony Awards, including nominations for both Groban and Ashford. He and Ashford departed on 14 January 2024, with Aaron Tveit and Sutton Foster announced to replace them.[47] On May 9-17, 2025, Groban will perform in Las Vegas at Caesars Palace.[48] In June 2007, Groban recorded a Christmas album in London with the London Symphony Orchestra and the Magdalen College Choir. Titled Noël, it was released on October 9, 2007.[49] The album saw great success in the United States, breaking numerous records for a Christmas album and becoming the best-selling album of 2007 in only its tenth week of release, at sales of 3.6 million.[50] He discussed it on the DVD from \"The Making of Noël\". On July 1, 2007, Groban performed with Sarah Brightman at the Concert for Diana at Wembley Stadium; it was broadcast to over 500 million homes in 140 countries. On February 10, 2008, Groban performed at the 2008 Grammy Awards with Andrea Bocelli in a tribute to Luciano Pavarotti. On April 14, 2008, Groban joined Idina Menzel for a PBS Soundstage taping. The next day, he held his own taping for the same PBS TV series at Lincoln Center's Rose Hall at Jazz in Manhattan. On May 12 and 13, 2008, at Royal Albert Hall, London, Groban performed as \"The Russian\" Anatoly Sergievsky with Broadway stars Idina Menzel and Adam Pascal in \"Chess in Concert\" a live concert version of the musical Chess composed by Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus of ABBA fame. This performance has since been made into a DVD and CD recording.[51] On September 21, 2008, Groban performed a comical medley of well-known TV theme songs at the 60th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards.
