                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. The Cincinnati Bengals are still alive in the AFC playoff race. Led by Joe Burrow's four touchdowns (one rushing), the Bengals recorded a 30-24 overtime win over the Denver Broncos, who missed a golden opportunity to clinch their first playoff berth since 2015. Denver forced overtime after Marvin Mims Jr. made an incredible touchdown catch on fourth down in the final seconds of regulation. The Bengals prevailed, though, when Burrow hit Tee Higgins for the game-winning score with 1:07 left in overtime. Burrow was magnificent, throwing for 412 yards and three touchdowns on 39 of 49 passing. He also ran for a score that gave Cincinnati a 24-17 lead late in regulation. All three of his touchdown passes went to Higgins, who caught 11 passes for 131 yards while playing through multiple injuries. Cincinnati won despite starting the game with consecutive drives that ended with unsuccessful fourth-down conversion attempts. The Bengals also survived Cade York's 33-yard field goal attempt hitting the left upright on their second drive of overtime. The Broncos lost despite a solid game by Nix and a pass rush that sacked Burrow seven times. Here's a full breakdown of how the Bengals kept their season alive. The Bengals weren't perfect by any means on Saturday, but they were certainly resilient. In a season that had previously been defined by near misses, the Bengals overcame their mistakes by coming up with game-changing plays when it mattered most. Once again, Burrow gave the Bengals an MVP-caliber performance. Facing Denver's vaunted pass rush, Burrow stood tall and completed a litany of clutch completions, none bigger than his 31-yard completion to Higgins in overtime that set up their game-winning touchdown connection. One of Burrow's biggest plays took place late in the third quarter after a penalty wiped out his nifty 50-yard touchdown pass to Andrei Iosivas. Earlier this year, a similar penalty would have signaled a downward spiral for the Bengals, who started the year with a 4-8 record. But Burrow refused to let that happen, as he kept the drive alive with a 19-yard run on third-and-13 one play later. The drive ended with Burrow's second touchdown pass of the game to Higgins. Burrow and Higgins were great, but they had plenty of help. Ja'Marr Chase caught nine passes for 102 yards, tight end Mike Gesicki caught 10 of 12 targets for 82 yards, and running back Chase Brown had 91 all-purpose before leaving the game with an ankle injury late in regulation. Defensively, the Bengals stepped up when the offense came up short on its early fourth-down attempts. Cincinnati allowed just three points in the first half and forced two crucial punts in overtime. Linebacker Germaine Pratt's interception of Nix late in the fourth quarter set up Burrow's go-ahead touchdown run. Denver's defense entered the night with a league-high 51 sacks, and added to its tally on Saturday night. Zach Allen was virtually unblockable with 3.5 sacks that included 1.5 sacks on consecutive plays on the first drive of overtime that forced a Bengals punt. But when the pass rush didn't get home, Burrow more often than not made the Broncos defense play. After stopping the Bengals twice on fourth down early in the game, Denver allowed Cincinnati to convert on 7 of its 13 third-down attempts. They also allowed the Bengals to convert on a key fourth down (an 11-yard completion from Burrow to Brown) that led to Cincinnati's go-ahead touchdown early in the fourth quarter after Denver had tied the score moments earlier. Offensively, the Broncos received a gritty game from Nix, whose night included a perfectly thrown touchdown pass to Courtland Sutton, a 51-yard bomb to Mims and his game-tying touchdown pass to Mims that forced overtime. But Nix and the rest of the Broncos offense were unable to rekindle that magic in overtime. It's safe to wonder whether or not Broncos coach Sean Payton elected to play it safe on offense in overtime, as Denver could have clinched a playoff berth with a tie. After its defense forced a punt to start overtime, the Broncos offense had a chance to make a game-changing play. Facing a third-and-6 from its own 14-yard line, Nix dropped back and fired a deep pass to Troy Franklin, who was wide open roughly 30 yards downfield. But Nix overthrew Franklin, who dove for the ball but was unable to make the catch. The Broncos punted instead of possibly driving for the game-winning score. While the night had more \"impressive plays,\" the play of the game has got to be Burrow's game-winning touchdown pass to Higgins. The score was the Bengals' first overtime touchdown in franchise history. The Bengals will travel to Pittsburgh next week for another must-win game. Cincinnati will also need Denver to lose next week against the Chiefs, who will likely rest Patrick Mahomes and other key starters with the AFC's No. 1 seed already secured. The Bengals also need the Colts and Dolphins to lose one of their final two games. The Broncos simply need to defeat the Chiefs. If they do, they'll finally snap their playoff drought, which currently stands at nine years. Burrow hits Higgins for a short TD, as Bengals prevail, 30-24. Bengals keep their playoff hopes alive. The Broncos will have to win next week to clinch a playoff berth. Burrow hits Higgins for 31 yards, as the Bengals are now at the Broncos' 3-yard line. Bengals get to the Broncos' 47 at the two minute warning on a 16-yard completion from Burrow to Iosivas. Denver will punt after Nix misfires on third down. Let's see what Joe Burrow can do. Cincy has no timeouts. Biggest play of the season for both teams. It's third-and-9 on Denver's 24 with 2:33 left in OT. Cade York's kick hits the upright. Broncos have another chance to win the game. Broncos can also play for a tie, that would be good enough to get the final playoff spot. Burrow hits Higgins on a slant for 20, and Cincinnati is on Denver's 21. Higgins makes up for his false start penalty on the previous play. Burrow hits Gesicki for 12 yards and the Bengals are at the Broncos' 36-yard-line. Gesicki has 10 catches tonight. Impressive stand by the Bengals, but this punt is on Nix, who overthrows his intended receiver on third-and-6. Bengals start on their own 46. Any score wins the game. Zach Allen has 3.5 sacks tonight, and his half sack on third-and-14 forces a Bengals punt, their first tonight. Any score will win the game for Denver. Broncos penalty gives the Bengals a first down near midfield. Khalil Herbert is in for Chase Brown, who appears to be done for the day after getting hurt late in the fourth quarter. It's officially a right ankle injury for Brown. Cincinnati will get the ball first in OT. Cincy will win the game if they score a TD on this drive. If they kick a FG, the Broncos will get a chance to extend OT with a FG or can win the game with a TD. If the Bengals don't score here, any Broncos score will win the game. Marvin Mims makes an incredible catch in the end zone on 4th and 1. Hilton tired to jar it loose, but Mims never loses his grip on the ball. Broncos face a 4th and 1 on the Bengals' 25 with 14 seconds left. They have enough time to complete something in play and spike the ball. Nix hits Sutton on consecutive plays as the Broncos are now inside the 35-yard-line. Under 50 seconds left. Burrow sneaks for a score as the Bengals take a 24-17 lead with 1:24 left. The Broncos have one timeout to work with. Burrow three total TD's today. Chase Brown is down after getting to within a yard of the end zone. Looks like his right leg as he intentionally slid to keep the clock moving. He's walking off under his own power, which is a good sign. Burrow hits Chase for 11 on third-and-6 and are on the Broncos' 6. Denver uses second timeout. Burrow is now up to 315 yards tonight. Another MVP like performance. Nix throws his sixth pick in the past three games, this one to Germaine Pratt on a third-and-15 play. On the next play, Burrow hits Chase for 38 yards and the Bengals are in FG range at the 2-minute warning. Tee Higgins makes a third down catch that was initially ruled incomplete, but the officials overrule the call, determining that Higgins had possession before Patrick Surtain II forced a fumble. Broncos take over at their own 40 with 5:08 left. Score tied, 17-17. Nix hits Marvin Mims for a 51-yard bomb, and we've got a tied score with 8:48 left. Mims split the safeties and used his 4.38 40 speed to track down Nix's pass. Higgins makes an incredible catch to give the Bengals a 17-10 lead with 11:33 left. So Bengals eventually get a TD on this drive after one was called back. Higgins has 2 TD's tonight despite playing through multiple injuries. Burrow's monster season continues tonight. Now has 41 TD's on the year and is making a case for league MVP. Burrow hits Chase Brown for 11 yards on 4th and 2, as the Bengals keep the drive live and are in the red zone early in the fourth quarter. This is the Bengals' 5th drive. They haven't punted and have been in the red zone 4 times. Burrow and Iosivas connect for a TD, but it's coming back on an illegal shift penalty. Gesicki went in motion while Brown was also moving. Burrow picked up the first down on a 19-yard run on the next play. Losing the TD hurts, but Bengals keep possession as the third quarter ends. Cincinnati has just one TO left after taking one with 1:01 left in the third. Burrow was just sacked again by Jonathon Cooper, who is taking advantage of Amarius Mims' absence. Nix hits Courtland Sutton for the game-tying TD. Sutton beat Bengals rookie Josh Newton, who has played well today and over the past few weeks. But he wasn't about to stop Sutton, who scores Denver's first offensive TD in 12 quarters. McLaughlin had three runs of over 11 yards on that drive. This looks like the Broncos' offense that started the game. McLaughlin rips off an 11-yard run as Denver quickly gets into Bengals territory. Cincinnati has to settle for 3 in the red zone after getting a little too pass happy. Here's how the Bengals' 4 drives have gone: Turnover on downs in Broncos territory, turnover on downs in the red zone, TD, FG An illegal contact penalty gives the Bengals a first and goal after Burrow was sacked on third down. A penalty on the next play gave the Bengals the ball on the Broncos' 3. The Broncos challenged Andrei Iosivas' 26-yard grab that would give the Bengals a first down on the Broncos' 25-yard line. The ball came out after Iosivas had already secured the catch, and the officials obviously saw it that way, too. Bengals with a chance to add to their lead at the start of the second half. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. CBS Sports is a registered trademark of CBS Broadcasting Inc.

The Bengals assured their late-season fight for the postseason would stay alive Saturday, taking down the Broncos, 30-24, on a walk-off touchdown in overtime from Tee Higgins, his third score of the game. Denver came into the Week 17 matchup looking for either a win or tie to secure its first playoff spot since 2015. But despite a valiant effort from rookie quarterback Bo Nix to keep the Broncos in the game, plus a missed Bengals field goal in overtime, Cincinnati held on to keep its playoff hopes alive behind a huge game from Joe Burrow. Burrow totaled 412 passing yards, three touchdowns — all of which went to Higgins — and no interceptions in the thrilling win in Cincinnati. The tension between the two AFC playoff contenders heated up in the fourth quarter, when the Broncos and Bengals scored two touchdowns each in a span of around 11 minutes. Although Denver, now 9-7, didn't clinch a playoff spot as it had hoped entering Week 17, Nix also turned in an outstanding performance. The rookie completed 24 of his 31 passes for 219 yards, three touchdowns and an interception, also putting on a show with two clutch touchdown passes in the fourth quarter to Marvin Mims Jr. Three teams still trail Denver in the AFC wild-card race, including Cincinnati, which is now 8-8. With Saturday's win, the Bengals pushed the conference's playoff chaos into Week 18. Denver, Cincinnati, Indianapolis and Miami could all still compete for the No. 7 seed in the AFC due to the Bengals' overtime win over the Broncos.

A reminder: They'll be in the 2024 NFL playoffs with a win. 7:04 p.m. — Burrow went to Higgins on a critical third down play, but he lost the football after making the short-range catch. The question was: should it have been ruled incomplete, or a fumble? After Sean Payton challenges the incompletion, the ruling is reversed, and Surtain recovered the fumble. Denver takes over, a potentially significant turn of events.

CINCINNATI (AP) Joe Burrow threw his third touchdown pass to Tee Higgins with 1:07 left in overtime, and the Cincinnati Bengals kept their slim playoff hopes alive with a wild 30-24 win over the Denver Broncos on Saturday. Following a Broncos punt, Burrow completed a 31-yard pass to Higgins to the Denver 3, then went back to the lanky receiver for the game-ending play. Higgins finished with 11 receptions for 131 yards. Cade York had a chance to win it for the Bengals with about three minutes left in overtime, but his 33-yard field goal bounced off the left upright. Denver then went three-and-out, including a Bo Nix incompletion on third down, handing the ball right back to Cincinnati (8-8). It was the Bengals' first win this season against a team with a winning record. They need another victory in their final game at Pittsburgh and some help from other teams to make it to the postseason for the first time since 2022. The Broncos (9-7) would have secured an AFC wild card with a victory over the Bengals. They'll have another opportunity to earn a postseason berth when they host Kansas City next weekend. Burrow continued his stellar season, going 39 for 49 for 412 yards and three touchdowns, all to Higgins. Ja’Marr Chase finished with nine receptions for 102 yards. Burrow has at least 250 yards passing and three touchdowns in eight straight games, extending his NFL record. Burrow's 1-yard touchdown run gave Cincinnati a 24-17 lead with 1:29 left in regulation. On the play before Burrow's TD, Chase Brown hurt his right ankle on what appeared to be an awkward slide while going down in what looked like an effort to help the Bengals run out the remaining time. Brown's injury stopped the clock, and Nix threw a spectacular 25-yard touchdown pass to a leaping Marvin Mims Jr. for the tying score with 8 seconds left. Nix was 24 for 31 for 219 yards and three touchdowns with one interception. Mims finished with eight catches for 103 yards and two TDs. Broncos: CB Damarri Mathis left in the first quarter with a hamstring injury. Bengals: Right tackle Amarius Mims left late in the first half with a hand injury. Broncos: Finish the regular season at home against the AFC West champions. The day and time for the game have yet to be announced. Bengals: At Pittsburgh at a date and time still be determined.

                "title": "Rapid Recap: Patriots Discharged by Playoff-Bound Chargers",
                "content": "Patriots.com Writer FOXBOROUGH – The Chargers punted on the first possession of their game Sunday against the New England Patriots, but from there Los Angeles posted seven-straight scoring drives while pulling away and coasting to an eventual 40-7 victory that secured them a playoff spot. Drake Maye briefly left the game for a concussion evaluation but returned and threw a long touchdown pass to Pop Douglas, one of few highlights for New England on the day. The Patriots offense struggled to sustain drives and had the game's only meaningful giveaway. Combined with the defense's inability to get off the field or force any meaningful turnovers of their own, and it was a lopsided result without many positives for the 3-13 Pats to take away. Here's how the disappointing loss went down. 1. Maye Departs Early Patriots rookie quarterback Drake Maye was briefly lost just three plays in the game, as he scrambled up the sideline on the offense's first third down and sustained a hard hit that dropped him to the ground. Maye walked off the field and into the blue medical tent before making his way to the team's locker room, and he was then announced as questionable to return with a head injury. It was the second time this season that Maye sustained a hard hit and had to depart, with the first coming in a 25-22 win over the Jets in Week 8. The Chargers opened the scoring on their next possession, converting a 4th-and-3 along the way of an 11-play, 86-yard drive. Justin Herbert laid out a perfect pass to a diving Derius Davis for a 23-yard touchdown. That came just one play after Herbert completed a 19-yard pass to Quentin Johnston on fourth down to keep the drive alive. After the Patriots offense went three-and-out with Jacoby Brissett at quarterback, the Chargers again went on a long scoring drive, lasting 12 plays and traveling 67 yards. A good tackle by Marte Mapu delivered a third-down stop, holding the Chargers to a 27-yard field goal that made it 10-0 Los Angeles. It was a rough start for the Pats, losing their starting quarterback and then watching the Chargers grab a 10-point lead. 2. Maye Re-Enters the Chat Against expectations, Maye returned to the sideline in the second quarter and re-entered the game after the Chargers took their 10-0 lead. The Gillette Stadium crowd gave the rookie QB a nice ovation as he re-took the field and Maye immediately scrambled on first down and took a hit while sliding that tacked on 15 yards for an unnecessary roughness penalty, quickly taking New England to midfield. The good vibes were short lived, as Maye turned and tried to execute a toss play but Pop Douglas couldn't handle the toss and the ball hit the ground for the second time in three possessions. This time the Chargers recovered, taking over at the New England 44. It was hard to discern what went wrong on the play, but the result was unwelcome as the Chargers would add another touchdown to their lead, making it 17-0 on a six-yard touchdown catch by Ladd McConkey. The Chargers dominated the first half while establishing the 17-point lead, holding a 21:58 to 5:07 advantage in time of possession, while stacking 15 first downs to New England's two, both of which came via penalty. Also among the bad news was the loss of Christian Gonzalez who suffered a concussion while trying to make a second-quarter tackle and was ruled out of the game just before halftime. 3. Maye Takes a Shot to Pop Things were looking bleak as the Patriots got the ball back just before the two-minute warning but that's when the rookie quarterback helped deliver a spark of life. First, Maye threw an 18-yard strike to Kendrick Bourne on a crossing route, and then followed that up with a 12-yard scramble that put the Pats in Chargers territory. On the next play, Chargers defender Bud Dupree jumped offsides, handing the Patriots a free play. Maye made the most of it, heaving the ball to the end zone with pressure in his face. Pop Douglas saw the ball in the air, pulled up and made a great adjustment to come down with the catch just inside the end zone for a quick-strike touchdown. That cut the lead to 17-7 and turned around New England's rough start, but the Chargers stayed aggressive with their final possession of the half, going for a 4th-and-3 and converting it in Patriots territory. It was a risky play with under 30 seconds left, but when Yannick Ngakoue took a roughing the passer penalty on the very next play it moved LA into scoring territory. The Chargers tacked on a 38-yard field goal to take a 20-7 lead into the locker room, as the Patriots defense could not deliver a stop and build off of the momentum from Douglas' score. 4. Chargers keep piling it on After a quick Patriots three-and-out to open the third quarter, the Chargers once again executed a long, sustained drive and capped it off with a touchdown bomb. It was a 10-play, 94-yard drive, as Herbert lofted a perfect throw to McConkey for a 40-yard touchdown that made it 27-7 Chargers midway through the third quarter and effectively sealed the win for LA. After forcing a punt on the Chargers first possession of the game, LA scored three touchdowns and two field goals on their next five possessions, pulling away from a Patriots defense that was on their heels and getting carved up. Two failed Patriots 4th-down attempts set the Chargers up for 10 more points as the lead grew to 30 points. 5. Patriots are now 3-13 With the loss, the Patriots fall to 3-13 on the 2024 season while losing their sixth straight game for the second time this season. Maye's early departure set an unfortunate tone but it mattered little when the defense allowed scores on four of the Chargers five first-half possessions. The Patriots offense was clunky on their own, contributing a momentum-killing fumble when the game was still close, but the defense couldn't get a stop or turnover to stem the tide and open the door for a realistic comeback attempt. Los Angeles kept adding to their lead every time they touched the ball and thoroughly controlled the time of possession throughout the game. Now the Patriots have one more game against a Buffalo team that might have little to play for if they beat the Jets and lock up the AFC's second overall seed.

Ladd McConkey scores on a 40-yard touchdown pass from Justin Herbert to extend the Chargers' lead to 27-7 vs. the Patriots. (0:20) FOXBOROUGH, Mass. -- As New England Patriots coach Jerod Mayo elected to punt from his team's own 28-yard line, down 30 points with 11 minutes left in the fourth quarter of Saturday's game, the few Patriots fans left began to chant \"Fire Mayo.\" It was that kind of game Saturday, as the Los Angeles Chargers dominated the struggling Patriots in front of a barren crowd at Gillette Stadium en route to a 40-7 win. It was the Patriots' second home loss by 30-plus points this century. The victory clinched a playoff spot for the Chargers and gave them double-digit wins for the third time since 2010. The loss dropped the Patriots to 3-13, their second straight season with 13 losses, but it moved them closer to clinching a top pick in the NFL draft. The Patriots will end their season next week with a home game against the Buffalo Bills. The Chargers will head to Las Vegas for their season finale against the Raiders, a game that could have playoff-seeding implications. The Chargers would secure the fifth seed with a win over the Raiders and a Steelers loss next week. Describe the game in two words: Thunderous trouncing. Saturday's win was the Chargers' best performance of the season, scoring a season-high 40 points. A week after the Patriots nearly beat the Bills, the Chargers pummeled them from the beginning of this game to secure a playoff spot. Promising trend I: J.K. Dobbins looks healthy. Dobbins had been one of the best running backs in the NFL, but a sprained left MCL sidelined him for the Chargers' past four games. He appeared to be his old self in his first game back Saturday, as he scored a touchdown and gained 76 rushing yards, which is more than any Chargers running back had in his absence. Promising trend II: The offensive line protected Herbert. This had been an issue all season, and without starting right guard Trey Pipkins II, it appeared it could continue Saturday. But the Chargers had one of their best blocking games of the season. The Patriots pressured Herbert on only six of his 39 dropbacks (15%), his second-lowest pressure rate in a game this season (12% in Week 11 versus the Bengals). -- Kris Rhim Next game: at Raiders (TBD, Sunday) Quarterback Drake Maye left the game on the Patriots' third offensive play after Chargers defensive back Cam Hart's helmet made contact with Maye's helmet, providing a scare on a day when the team was never competitive. Maye remained down after the hit, then visited the medical tent and locker room to be evaluated for a concussion. He eventually returned in the second quarter and was one of the few reasons for Patriots fans to watch in a game the Chargers controlled throughout. Cornerback Christian Gonzalez -- along with Maye, arguably the team's two best players -- wasn't as fortunate. He left in the second quarter to be evaluated for a concussion and was later ruled out. The game was a disappointment for the Patriots, who were hoping to build momentum after playing the AFC East-champion Bills tough last week in a 24-21 loss. Instead, it sparked more questions about first-year head coach Jerod Mayo and the direction of the franchise. Describe the game in two words: No charge. The Patriots ran 15 offensive plays in the first half, tied for the fewest by any team in a first half in the past five seasons -- a reflection of how they were outclassed from the start. Pivotal play: Trailing 10-0 midway through the second quarter, Maye's errant pitch to receiver DeMario Douglas was recovered by Chargers safety Derwin James Jr. and quickly turned into a touchdown to give the Chargers a 17-0 lead. It was the Patriots' 22nd giveaway of the season and their league-worst 29th fumble. Eye-popping stat: With his 36-yard touchdown strike to Douglas, Maye now has three touchdown passes this season of at least 35 air yards, the most such TD passes by a Patriots quarterback since Tom Brady had three in 2009. Biggest hole in the game plan: Mayo said in a pregame radio interview that Antonio Gibson would start at running back over Rhamondre Stevenson after Stevenson fumbled for a league-high seventh time last week, but Stevenson ended up starting the game. Perhaps Mayo misspoke -- otherwise, it appeared the Patriots forgot to follow their own plan. Stevenson finished with two carries for 1 yard. Gibson picked up some garbage-time action to tally 63 yards on 12 carries. Silver lining: Cole Strange, the Patriots' 2022 first-round pick, who spent his first two seasons at left guard, made his first career start at center and seemed to account well for himself. Strange tore his patella tendon last December and didn't return to the game-day roster until last week at Buffalo as a backup option along the offensive line and on the field goal protection unit. So this was his most extended action since the injury, and he showed he could be a viable option at center in the future. -- Mike Reiss Next game: vs. Bills (TBD, Sunday)",

The team plays its home games at Paycor Stadium in downtown Cincinnati.[7] Former Cleveland Browns head coach Paul Brown began planning for the creation of the Bengals franchise in 1965, and Cincinnati's city council approved the construction of Riverfront Stadium in 1966. Finally, in 1967, the Bengals were founded when a group headed by Brown received franchise approval by the American Football League (AFL) on May 23, 1967, and they began play in the 1968 season.[8] Brown was the Bengals' head coach from their inception to 1975. After being dismissed as the Browns' head coach by Art Modell (who had purchased a majority interest in the team in 1961) in January 1963, Brown had shown interest in establishing another NFL franchise in Ohio and looked at both Cincinnati and Columbus. He ultimately chose the former when a deal between the city, Hamilton County, and Major League Baseball's Cincinnati Reds (who were seeking a replacement for the obsolete Crosley Field) was struck that resulted in an agreement to build a multipurpose stadium which could host both baseball and football games. Due to the impending merger of the AFL and the NFL, which was scheduled to take full effect in the 1970 season, Brown agreed to join the AFL as its 10th and final franchise. The Bengals, like the other former AFL teams, were assigned to the AFC following the merger. Cincinnati was also selected because, like their neighbors the Reds, they could draw from several large neighboring cities (Louisville and Lexington, Kentucky; Columbus, Dayton, and Springfield, Ohio) that are all no more than 110 miles (180 km) away from downtown Cincinnati, along with Indianapolis, until the Baltimore Colts relocated there prior to the 1984 NFL season.[9] After Paul Brown's death in 1991, controlling interest in the team was inherited by his son, Mike Brown. In 2011, Brown purchased shares of the team owned by the estate of co-founder Austin Knowlton and is now the majority owner of the Bengals franchise.[7] The Bengals won the AFC championship in 1981, 1988, and in 2021. After each of the 1981 and 1988 conference championships, they went on to lose to the San Francisco 49ers, in Super Bowls XVI and XXIII. The team struggled greatly in the 1990s and the early 2000s, during which time they were sometimes referred to disparagingly as \"The Bungles,\" a term coined by Steelers broadcaster Myron Cope.[10] [11][12][13][14] Following the 1990 season, the team went 14 years without making the NFL playoffs or posting a winning record. The Bengals went through several head coaches in that period, and many of their top draft picks did not pan out. The team's fortunes improved in the mid-2000s and into the mid-2010s, which saw them become more consistent postseason contenders, but they continued to struggle in the playoffs.[15][16][17][18] The turning point for the Bengals was during the 2021 season, when they won their first playoff game in 31 years and advanced to the first of two consecutive AFC Championship games. In 2021, they defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 27–24 in overtime and advanced to Super Bowl LVI, their first appearance in the Super Bowl in 33 years, where they lost to the Los Angeles Rams 23–20.[19] They advanced to the AFC Championship game again in 2022 but lost to the eventual Super Bowl champions, the Chiefs, by a score of 23-20 (the same exact score as in Super Bowl LVI).[20] The team does not have an official general manager. However, Duke Tobin is often, though incorrectly, referred to as the Bengals' general manager because he handles most personnel decisions.[21] In a 2011 survey, Brown was rated as among the worst team owners in American professional sports.[22] In a Forbes article on the value of NFL teams as of August 2022, the Cincinnati Bengals were ranked last with a value of $3 billion.[23] In 1967, an ownership group led by Paul Brown was granted a franchise in the American Football League. Brown named the team the Bengals in order \"to give it a link with past professional football in Cincinnati\".[24] Another Cincinnati Bengals team had existed in the city and played in three previous American Football Leagues[25] from 1937 to 1942. The city's world-renowned zoo was also home to a rare white Bengal tiger. In a possible insult to Art Modell – or possibly as a homage to the Massillon Tigers – Brown chose the exact shade of orange used by his former team. He added black as the secondary color. Brown chose a very simple logo: the word \"BENGALS\" in black lettering. One of the potential helmet designs Brown rejected was a striped motif that was similar to the helmets adopted by the team in 1981 still in use today; however, that design featured stripes which were more uniform in width.[26] The Bengals began play in the 1968 season. In 1966, the American Football League agreed to a merger with its older and more established rival, the National Football League.[27] Among the terms of the merger was that the AFL was permitted to add one additional franchise; the NFL wanted an even number of clubs in the merged league, so a team needed to be added to bring the number of clubs in the merged league to 26 teams. For the AFL, a key motive behind their agreement to accept a new team was that the guarantee of an eventual place in the NFL meant the league could charge a steep expansion fee of $10 million – 400 times the $25,000 the original eight owners paid when they founded the league in 1960. The cash from the new team provided the American Football League with the funds needed to pay the indemnities required to be paid by the AFL to the NFL, as stipulated by the merger agreement. Prior to the merger's announcement, Brown had not seriously considered joining the American Football League and was not a supporter of what he openly regarded to be an inferior competition, once famously stating that \"I didn't pay ten million dollars to be in the AFL.\"[28] However, with the announcement of the merger, Brown realized that the AFL expansion franchise would likely be his only realistic path back into the NFL in the short to medium term, and ultimately acquiesced to joining the AFL after learning that the team was guaranteed to become an NFL franchise after the merger was completed in 1970. There was also a major problem: Major League Baseball's Cincinnati Reds were in need of a facility to replace Crosley Field, which they had used since 1912. By this time, the small park was antiquated and rundown, and parking issues had plagued the city since the early 1950s, while the park also lacked modern amenities – issues that were exacerbated by the Mill Creek Expressway (I-75) project that ran alongside the park. While New York City – which had lost both its National League teams in 1957 after the Dodgers relocated to Los Angeles, and the Giants relocated to San Francisco – had actively courted Reds owner Powel Crosley to relocate his team there, Crosley was adamant that the Reds remain in Cincinnati and tolerated the worsening problems with the Crosley Field location. With assistance from Ohio governor Jim Rhodes, Hamilton County and the Cincinnati city council agreed to build a single multi-purpose facility on the dilapidated riverfront section of the city: the new facility had to be ready by the opening of the 1970 NFL season, and was officially named Riverfront Stadium. With the completion of the merger in 1970, the Cleveland Browns were one of three NFL teams that agreed to move to the AFL-based American Football Conference to give both conferences an equal number of teams and were placed in the AFC Central, the same division as the Bengals. An instant rivalry was born, fueled initially by Paul Brown's rivalry with Art Modell.[29][30] For their first two seasons, the Bengals played at Nippert Stadium, the current home of the University of Cincinnati Bearcats.[31] The team held training camp at Wilmington College in Wilmington, through the 1968 preseason. The team finished its first season with a 3–11 record[32] and running back Paul Robinson, who rushed for 1,023 yards, and was named the AFL Rookie of the Year.[33] Founder Paul Brown coached the team for its first eight seasons.[34] One of Brown's college draft strategies was to draft players from non-traditional football schools. Punter/wide receiver Pat McInally attended Harvard University, and linebacker Reggie Williams attended Dartmouth College and served on Cincinnati city council while on the Bengals' roster. Because of this policy, many former players went on to have successful careers in commentary and broadcasting as well as the arts. In addition, Brown had a knack for locating and recognizing pro football talent in unusual places.[35] In 1970, the Bengals moved to play at Riverfront Stadium, a home they shared with the Cincinnati Reds until the team moved to Paul Brown Stadium in 2000. Notable players of the 1970 team included Virgil Carter, Chip Meyers, Jack Meckstroth, Bob Trumpy, and Lemar Parrish. Virgil Carter threw for 1,647 yards. Chip Myers paced all receivers, catching 32 passes for 542 yards. Bob Trumpy contributed to the receiving game, too.[36] The team reached the playoffs three times during that decade, but could not win any of those postseason games. In 1975, the team posted an 11–3 record, giving them what remains the highest winning percentage (.786) in franchise history. But it only earned them a wild card spot in the playoffs, behind the 12–2 Pittsburgh Steelers, who went on to win the Super Bowl; the Bengals lost to the Oakland Raiders 31–28 in the divisional playoffs.[37] The Bengals reached the Super Bowl twice during the 1980s – in Super Bowl XVI and Super Bowl XXIII – and lost against the San Francisco 49ers both times.[38][39] The team appeared in the playoffs in 1990, making it to the second round before losing to the Los Angeles Raiders.[40] Before the following season got underway, Paul Brown died at age 82.[41] Due to declining health, he had already transferred control to his son, Mike Brown, but was reported to still influence the daily operations of the team.[42] The Bengals' fortunes changed for the worse as the team posted 14 consecutive non-winning seasons and were saddled with numerous draft busts. The Bengals began to emerge from that dismal period into a new era of increased consistency, however, after the team finished with its worst record in team history, 2–14, which led to the hiring of Marvin Lewis as head coach in 2003.[43] Carson Palmer, the future star quarterback, was drafted in 2003, but did not play a snap that whole season, as Jon Kitna had a comeback year (voted NFL Comeback Player of the Year).[44][45] Despite Kitna's success, Palmer was promoted to starting quarterback the following season.[46] The team finished with an 8–8 record and missed the postseason in 2004.[47] Under Palmer, the team advanced to the playoffs for the first time since 1990 losing in the Wild Card Roundto the Pittsburgh Steelers 31–17 in the 2005 season, which also was the first time the team had a winning percentage above .500 since 1990.[48][49][50] The Bengals returned to the playoffs again in 2009 in a season that included the franchise's first-ever division sweep. This was especially impressive since two of the teams swept by the Bengals – the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Baltimore Ravens – had made it to the AFC Championship Game the previous season. Marvin Lewis was rewarded for the accomplishment with the NFL Coach of the Year Award.[51] In the 2010 season, the Bengals posted a 4–12 record.[52] Following the disappointing 2010 season, quarterback Carson Palmer demanded to be traded. When the Bengals refused to do so, Palmer announced his retirement from the NFL.[53] He later was moved at the NFL trade deadline to the Oakland Raiders.[54] In the 2011 NFL draft, the Bengals selected wide receiver A. J. Green in the first round and quarterback Andy Dalton in the second round.[55] The Bengals improved to 9–7 in the 2011 season, and clinched a playoff spot.[56] Dalton and Green became the most prolific rookie WR-QB duo in history, connecting 65 times for 1,057 yards. However, they lost to the Houston Texans, 31–10, in the Wild Card round.[57] In the 2012 season, the Bengals clinched a playoff spot once more with a win over the Pittsburgh Steelers, going to the playoffs in back-to-back years for the first time since 1982.[58] However, the Bengals faced the Texans in the first round yet again and took another early exit, losing 19–13.[59] In the 2013 season, for the third straight year, the Bengals clinched a playoff berth and also won the AFC North, finishing with an 11–5 record.[60] But once again, the Bengals were defeated in the wild card round, this time by the San Diego Chargers, 27–10.[61] Most of the blame was put on Andy Dalton, who threw two interceptions and fumbled on a forward dive. This made the Bengals 0–5 in playoff games since Mike Brown took over as owner. The 2014 season started well, with the Bengals winning their first three contests against the Baltimore Ravens, Atlanta Falcons, and Tennessee Titans. However, they lost their Week 5 road matchup with the New England Patriots, 43–17. An overtime tie with the Carolina Panthers and a shutout loss to the Indianapolis Colts followed the primetime loss to the Patriots. Finishing the season 10–5–1 as the fifth seed, they lost to the Colts, 26–10, in the first round of the playoffs.[62][63] This was the first time the franchise made the playoffs four straight seasons. In 2015, the Bengals got out to a franchise-best 8–0 start with a 31–10 win over the Cleveland Browns.[64] Unfortunately, in Week 14 they would lose starting quarterback Andy Dalton to injury. He would not return that season, leaving A. J. McCarron to start under center. The Bengals finished with a franchise record-tying 12–4 mark.[65] Additionally, they lost to the division rival Pittsburgh Steelers, 18–16, in the Wild Card round in the final minute, making them the first franchise in NFL history to lose five straight opening-round playoff games.[66] This frustration continued in 2016 for the Bengals: they finished the 2016 campaign with a 6–9–1 record, losing several key players to injury, including A. J. Green, Giovani Bernard, and Jeremy Hill.[67][68] They missed the playoffs for the first time since 2010, marking the first time Andy Dalton missed the playoffs as the Bengals' starting quarterback. One notable game was a 27–27 tie against the Washington Redskins which was played in London in 2016.[69] Following a rough 2016 season, the Bengals looked forward into 2017. However, after starting 0–3, the Bengals never found their footing. At one point in the season, the Bengals were 5–9. There were rumors that Marvin Lewis would not return for the next season as the Bengals' head coach. However, after two come-from-behind victories over the Lions and Ravens that eliminated both teams from the playoffs, the Bengals finished 7–9.[70] The final two games were convincing enough for owner Mike Brown to give Lewis a new two-year contract.[71] The 2018 campaign began with promise for the Bengals under Lewis. Cincinnati began the season with a 4–1 record with impressive wins over the Colts, Ravens, Falcons, and Dolphins. However, the Bengals suffered many setbacks after the hot start: defensive coordinator Teryl Austin was fired mid-season because of defensive woes,[72] A. J. Green was injured and officially out for the last four games, and Andy Dalton injured his thumb in the Bengals' first game against the Browns and replaced by Jeff Driskel for the rest of the season.[73][74] The Bengals ended 2018 with a final record of 6–10 and finished last place in the AFC North.[75] On December 31, 2018, with one year to go on his contract, Lewis and the Bengals mutually parted ways after three straight losing seasons under his watch.[76] In 2019, they hired head coach Zac Taylor.[77] The 2019 campaign started off with reasonable success, with the Bengals barely losing to Seattle 21–20 at CenturyLink Field; but what started with promise ended in disaster.[78] The Bengals then lost 10 more games and were 0–11 heading into December 2019. To open the month of December, they got their first win of the season against the Jets, 22–6, in Cincinnati.[79] They eventually lost to the Patriots and then to the Dolphins, 38–35, in overtime after Dalton led the team back from 23 points down in the fourth quarter. With the loss to the Dolphins, the Bengals officially clinched the No. 1 overall pick in the 2020 NFL draft.[80] They capped off the season with a win against the Cleveland Browns, finishing 2–14, equaling the 2002 season as the team's worst record in history.[81][82] In 2020, the Bengals improved under rookies Joe Burrow and Tee Higgins.[83] Starting the season with a 2–5–1 record going into the bye week, including an overtime tie to the Philadelphia Eagles. Going into Week 11 facing the Washington Football Team, they lost Joe Burrow to a season-ending knee injury that all but ended their season, only winning two more contests against the Pittsburgh Steelers and Houston Texans.[84] Finishing the season 4–11–1.[85] In 2021, the Bengals won the AFC North with a 10–7 record, which included dominant sweeps of the rival Pittsburgh Steelers and Baltimore Ravens.[86] Led by Joe Burrow, who was playing in his first full season after recovering from his devastating knee injury in Week 11 of his rookie season and rookie receiver, and Burrow's college teammate at LSU, Ja'Marr Chase, Cincinnati would win the AFC North for the first time since 2015. They beat the Kansas City Chiefs, 34–31, in a Week 17 thriller to clinch the division. They then won their first playoff game since the 1990 season, beating the Las Vegas Raiders, 26–19, in the Wild Card round.[87] After that, they upset the top-seeded Tennessee Titans, 19–16, when Evan McPherson kicked a game-winning 52-yard field goal. A week later, they advanced to their first Super Bowl since 1989 when McPherson kicked a 33-yard field goal in overtime to cap off a comeback from being down 21–3 and shock the No. 2 seed Chiefs, 27–24. They lost a close Super Bowl to the Los Angeles Rams in Super Bowl LVI, 23–20.[88] In Week 1 of the 2022 NFL season, the Bengals lost, 23–20, to the Pittsburgh Steelers in overtime, breaking a three-game winning streak the Bengals had against Pittsburgh. After falling to a 4–4 record in Week 8, the Bengals proceeded to win 8 straight games to tie a franchise-record for single-season wins and earn a 3 seed in the AFC playoffs.[89][90] They defeated divisional rival Baltimore in the first round 24–17, behind a 98-yard fumble recovery returned for a touchdown by Sam Hubbard.[91][92] Despite missing three starting offensive linemen, the Bengals followed that up with a decisive 27–10 road win over the favored Buffalo Bills to reach a second straight AFC Championship appearance for the first time in franchise history.[93] Once again, they faced the Kansas City Chiefs in the Championship Game, but this time they lost 23–20, in another thrilling game.[94] In the 2023 season, during their Week 11 matchup against the Baltimore Ravens, Joe Burrow would suffer a wrist injury that would rule him out the rest of the season.[95] The consistent play of backup quarterback Jake Browning kept the Bengals alive in the postseason hunt after Burrow's injury.[96] The Bengals finished the season 9–8 and missed the playoffs.[97] When the team debuted in 1968, the Bengals' uniforms were modeled after the Cleveland Browns. When Paul Brown was fired by Art Modell, Brown still owned the equipment used by Cleveland, so after the firing, Paul Brown packed up all his equipment, which he then used for his new team in Cincinnati. The Cleveland Browns' team colors were brown, orange, and white, and their helmets were solid orange with a white dorsal stripe over the crest. The Bengals' team colors were orange, black, and white, and their helmets were a similar shade of orange, with the only variations being the word \"Bengals\" in black block letters (with a white outline) on either side of the helmet and no stripe on the helmet. The Cincinnati Bengals were unique in the NFL, as they did not have secondary uniform numbers on the jerseys (called \"TV numbers\") until they appeared on the sleeves in the 1980 season; they were the only NFL team that didn't have them prior to that point. That same year, the team changed their helmet face mask color from gray to black. The team did not discard their Cleveland-like uniforms until 1981. During that year, a then-unique uniform design was introduced: Although the team kept black jerseys, white jerseys, and white pants, they were now trimmed with orange and black tiger stripes. The team also introduced the orange helmets with black tiger stripes that are still in use today. Sports Illustrated likened the Bengals' new helmets to \"varicose pumpkins.\"[98] In 1997, the Bengals designed a logo consisting of a leaping tiger, and it was added to the uniform sleeves (with this, the TV numbers moved to the shoulder). Another alternate logo consisted of a Bengal's head facing to the left. However, the orange helmet with black tiger stripes continued to be the trademark. In 2004, a new tiger stripe pattern and more accents were added to the uniforms. The black jerseys now featured orange tiger-striped sleeves and white side panels, while the white jerseys began to use black tiger-striped sleeves and orange shoulders.[99] A new logo consisting of an orange \"B\" covered with black tiger stripes was introduced.[100] The team also started rotating black pants and debuted an alternate orange jersey, with white side panels and black tiger-striped sleeves. The Bengals have worn their black uniforms at home throughout their history, with some exceptions, such as the 1970 season, when the Bengals wore white at home for the entire season as well as most of the 1971 season (the Bengals were the first AFL team to wear white at home, as its rules required the home team to wear their dark jerseys, unlike the NFL, which allowed the home team choice of jersey color starting in 1964). Since 2005, the Bengals have worn white for September home games where the heat could become a factor. In 2016, the Bengals unveiled their all-white Color Rush alternate uniform, featuring black tiger stripes along the sleeves and pants. Orange was only used on the Nike mark, on the team logo, and as an outline color on the player's name.[101] The club announced a new uniform design on January 21, 2021. The new uniform design would be worn beginning with the 2021 NFL season.[102] The set retains the signature striped helmet, while simplifying the look by removing the side and shoulder panels, creating a new stripe pattern for the sleeves, getting rid of the number block shadow, and removing the stroke on the player's name. This set also puts the team's wordmark on the chest and lacks TV numbers on the sleeves. The shade of orange was changed, as well. The Bengals wore three different pants with this set: black pants with orange stripes, white pants with black stripes, and white pants with orange stripes. The white pants with black stripes were worn with the white jersey in 2021 playoff games at Tennessee and Kansas City. The white pants with orange stripes were worn with the black jersey in Super Bowl LVI against the Rams.[103] In 2022, after the NFL rescinded the \"one-helmet rule,\" the Bengals unveiled an alternate black-striped white helmet. In addition, the team brought back the all-white Color Rush uniform to be paired with the white helmets.[104][105] This would last one season, however, as the team decided to pair the white helmet with the primary white uniform for two games in 2023, effectively retiring the Color Rush uniform for the time being.[106] In 2024, the Bengals added orange pants to the uniform rotation after Madden NFL 25 leaked the option to the public.[107] The Bengals then unveiled a new all-orange uniform combination to be worn September 8 against the Patriots.[108] The team's official mascot is a Bengal tiger named Who Dey.[109] Its jersey number is 1.[110] Aside from Who Dey, the team also has the Ben-Gals, the team's cheerleading squad,[111] which included Laura Vikmanis, the oldest cheerleader in league history.[112] Carol Motsinger in 2015 said, \"In 2012, Cincinnati welcomed another tiger named Who Dey. This time, one that walks on four legs. More than 1,000 Bengals season ticket holders named a Malayan tiger Who Dey at Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Garden. He was recently traded to a zoo in Kansas.\"[113] The Ohio History Central notes: \"In 1940, a third American Football League formed, and the Cincinnati Bengals joined it. Unfortunately, World War II began the following year, causing manpower shortages as men joined the armed forces. This prompted this newer AFL to cease playing after the 1941 season. Paul Brown, former coach of the Cleveland Browns, received authorization from a modern American Football League to create a team in Cincinnati. Brown chose the name Bengals to memorialize the teams of the same name that had represented Cincinnati in the past.\"[114] The Bengals' historic rivalry with the Cleveland Browns is often referred to as the \"Battle of Ohio\", started as the result of former Browns head coach and team founder Paul Brown starting the Bengals franchise after leaving the Browns.[115] The colors of each team are similar since Paul Brown chose the exact shade of orange used by the Browns for the Bengals, and the Bengals' original uniforms were identical to the Browns' uniforms, excluding the word \"Bengals\" on the helmet. The rivalry reached its peak during the 1980s when both teams were vying viciously for a spot in the playoffs. During the 1990s the rivalry also butted heads when Brown's sons were in charge of the day-to-day operations of the Bengals.[116] The Bengals lead the series 53–48 as of the end of the 2023 season.[117] The Bengals and Pittsburgh Steelers have played each other twice a year since becoming division rivals in 1970. This rivalry has gained intensity since the 2000s, as the teams have met twice in the playoffs, with both games being marked by hard hits and injuries with the most infamous example occurring in the 2005 playoffs.[118][119][120] The Steelers lead the overall series 70–39 and the postseason series 2–0.[121] However, the Steelers have been more dominant recently, posting a record of 28–7 since 2004, when they drafted Roethlisberger. There were two times that the rivalry has met during the playoffs: the Wild Card rounds of 2005 and 2015, with the Steelers winning both meetings at Cincinnati. The 2005 game is marked as a special time in the rivalry because this is when Steelers defensive tackle Kimo Von Oelhoffen injured Bengals quarterback Carson Palmer,[122] while the 2015 game is also special because Bengals running back Jeremy Hill fumbled the ball in the waning minutes when the Bengals had a 16–15 lead over the Steelers to give the latter one last chance. They used that chance wisely as they drove down the field (with the help of two costly personal fouls by the Bengals) and kicked a game-winning field goal.[123] The Bengals' rivalry with the Baltimore Ravens began when the original Browns franchise relocated to Baltimore to become the Ravens. Since then, the rivalry heated up when longtime Ravens defensive coordinator Marvin Lewis was hired as the head coach of the Bengals. The Ravens lead the all-time series 30–27 as of the 2023 season.[124] The Bengals won the only playoff meeting in the 2022 AFC Wild Card round.[125] The Joe Burrow-led Bengals have developed a recent rivalry with the Kansas City Chiefs, with Burrow being the only AFC quarterback to date to hold a winning record against Mahomes.[126] As of the 2023 season, the Bengals lead the all-time series 18–16.[127] The Bengals have played the Titans more than any non-divisional opponent by a significant margin. The Titans lead the all-time series 41–37–1.[128] A no-huddle offense was commonly used by all teams when time in the game was running low. However, Sam Wyche, the head coach of the Bengals in 1988, along with offensive coordinator Bruce Coslet, made the high-paced offense the standard modality for the ball club regardless of time remaining. By quickly substituting and setting up for the next play—often within 5–10 seconds after the last play despite being afforded 45 seconds—the Bengals hindered the other team's defense from substituting situational players, regrouping for tactics, and resting. In response, the NFL instituted rules allowing the defense ample time for substitutions when offensive substitutions were made. The hurry-up tactic was used by the franchise during the late 1980s while Sam Wyche was the coach. A rival for AFC supremacy during this time was the Buffalo Bills, coached by Marv Levy, who also used a version of the no-huddle offense starting with the 1989 season. The Bengals had beaten the Bills three times in 1988 (pre-season, regular season, and the AFC Championship Game). Marv Levy threatened to fake injuries if the Bengals used the \"no-huddle\" in the AFC Championship. Wyche was notified that the commissioner had ordered the \"no-huddle\" illegal for the game. The official notified Wyche and the Bengals' team just two hours before the game kickoff.[129] Wyche asked to talk directly to the commissioner and word immediately came back that the \"no-huddle\" would not be penalized. Levy did not have his players' fake injuries in the game but installed his version the next year, 1989. The Bengals first used the \"no-huddle\" in 1984.[130] Most of the high-profile games (the various games for AFC titles and regular-season games) between the two led to these changes in NFL rules. Wyche also first used the timeout periods as an opportunity to bring his entire team to the sideline to talk to all eleven players, plus substitutes, at one time. This allowed trainers time to treat a cut or bruise and equipment managers time to repair an equipment defect. The West Coast offense is the popular name for the high-percentage passing scheme designed by former Bengals assistant Bill Walsh.[131] Walsh formulated what has become popularly known as the West Coast offense during his tenure as assistant coach for the Cincinnati Bengals from 1968 to 1975, while working under the tutelage of Brown (and before embarking on his legendary coaching tenure with the San Francisco 49ers in the 1980s). Bengals quarterback Virgil Carter was the first player to successfully implement Walsh's system, leading the NFL in pass completion percentage in 1971.[132] Ken Anderson replaced Carter as Cincinnati's starting quarterback in 1972 and was even more successful. In 1975 he would bring widespread recognition to the West Coast offense as well as to the Cincinnati team and its quarterback in a nationally televised Monday night contest between the Bengals and a Buffalo Bills team built around the running game of star player O. J. Simpson. Anderson's 447 passing yards were enough to overcome Simpson's 197 yards on the ground in a game that proved a milestone, providing a striking contrast between the \"old\" game of defense-minded football and the new game of higher scores and more action through a sophisticated aerial attack.[133] The game, in effect, offered its viewers a glimpse of the future of professional football. Anderson, who was drafted by Paul Brown in 1971 and installed as starting quarterback in 1972, made four trips to the Pro Bowl, won four passing titles, was named NFL MVP in 1981, and set the record for completion percentage in a single season in 1982 with 70.66%. Defeated frequently during the 1970s by the Pittsburgh Steelers, a team that won four Super Bowls with 9 future Hall of Fame players, the Bengals under Anderson and head coach Forrest Gregg would finally break through the Steel Curtain, defeating the Steelers during both of their meetings in 1980 and again in 1981. Anderson, who had been named the \"team franchise\" by Bengal tight end Bob Trumpy, would ultimately prove his worth with a career record of 91 wins and 81 losses.[134] The defense created to combat the West Coast offense also came from Cincinnati. Then-Bengals defensive coordinator Dick LeBeau (who later served as the team's head coach from 2000 to 2002) created the zone blitz in the 1980s in response to the West Coast offense.[135] Running backs (RB) Wide receivers (WR) Tight ends (TE) Defensive linemen (DL) Defensive backs (DB) Special teams Reserve 53 active, 13 reserve, 16 practice squad In addition, Despite not being formally retired, the Bengals have certain numbers that are in limited circulation: There are four members of the Hall of Fame that have spent some portion of their career with the Bengals, but only Anthony Muñoz and Ken Riley spent their entire playing careers with the Bengals. Listed below are only Hall of Famers whose induction includes their tenure with the Bengals. Bengals founder and first coach Paul Brown is in the Hall of Fame, but was inducted before founding the team and is not credited as a Bengals Hall of Famer. Additionally, the Bengals have had two head coaches, Forrest Gregg and Dick LeBeau inducted for their playing career. In 2007, in celebration of their 40th anniversary the Bengals named an all-time team voted on by the fans.[148] Source:[149] The Bengals announced they would begin a Ring of Honor in 2021.[150] The inaugural class included Pro Football Hall of Fame tackle Anthony Muñoz and Paul Brown, who was the franchise's founder and first coach,[151] with Ken Anderson and Ken Riley added after a season ticket holder vote.[152] *Posthumous induction → Coaching staff → Front office → More NFL staffs The Bengals contract with iHeartMedia as their radio partner,[153] with their flagship radio stations being WCKY (1530) and WEBN (102.7 FM), along with WLW (700) if not in conflict with the Reds. Most preseason and regular season games, are telecast on WKRC-TV, channel 12, the CBS affiliate. Mike Watts and Anthony Muñoz are the TV announcers for preseason games, with Mike Valpredo as the sideline reporter.[154] Games that feature an NFC opponent playing at Paycor Stadium will be televised on WXIX, channel 19, the local Fox affiliate. WLWT-TV airs games when the Bengals are featured on Sunday Night Football. The radio broadcasting crew consists of Dan Hoard (play-by-play), and Dave Lapham (analyst).[155] \"The Bengal Growl\" is the Bengals fight song. It was written by Bengals entertainment director George \"Red\" Bird upon the team's founding in 1968. Bird had been friends with Paul Brown for over 30 years. The two had met at Massillon Washington High School when Brown was head football coach and Bird was director of the famed Massillon Tiger Swing Band. Bird had served as the Browns' music and entertainment director in 1946, and kept that role until Brown convinced him to come to Cincinnati in 1968. His first task was to pen a fight song along the lines of the Browns' fight song, \"Hi! O-Hi-O for Cleveland!\" The song remains very popular among Bengals fans, who are known to belt out the song at \"Bengals backer\" bars all over the country. In 2021, Elizabeth Blackburn, now the team's head of strategy and fan engagement, told The Athletic recalled stopping at one such bar in San Francisco during the 2015 playoffs, and was surprised to hear the viewers break out into the song. As a measure of how popular the song remains among the Bengals fan base, when Blackburn wrote an editorial on her efforts to overhaul the team's image for the Bengals Web site, Blackburn specifically mentioned that the song was not going anywhere.[156] \"Welcome to the Jungle\" is also a fight song for the Bengals.[157][158] The song is mainly played before kick-offs to intimidate visiting teams. \"Who Dey?!\" is the name of a chant of support by fans of the Cincinnati Bengals, in use since the 1980s. The entire chant is: \"Who dey, who dey, who dey think gonna beat dem Bengals?\"[159] The answer screamed in unison, \"Nobody.\" Sometimes fans will instead shout \"Who Dey?\" to represent the entire cheer. \"Who Dey\" is also the name of the team's mascot, a Bengal tiger.[110] Saying \"Who Dey\" at Bengals games is steeped in local beer lore. Hudy, a leading product of Hudepohl Brewing Company 1978 through the late 1980s, bears a phonetic similarity to the \"Who Dey\" chant. Beer vendors who carried full cases of bottled local beer up and down the steep upper stairs of what was then Riverfront Stadium would call out \"If Hudy\", \"Burger\" and other local beer names. Raucous fans would often chant back and forth with them as the vendors called out. During the 1980 season, the banter with the Hudepohl vendors grew organically into the now famous (Hu-Dey) -Who They?- chant.[160] The full Who Dey chant was first known to be used by fans of the 1980 Cincinnati Bengals.[161] While the origin of the chant is disputed, one possible source for the chant is a 1980 commercial for (the now-defunct) Red Frazier Ford of Cincinnati, which used this tagline: \"Who's going to give you a better deal than Red Frazier?...Nobody!\" Cincinnati fans who had seen the commercial many times may have just copied it when cheering.[162] The chant bears some similarities to the phrase \"Who Dat?\", which was officially adopted by the New Orleans Saints in 1983 but had been used by Louisiana's high school team fans for some time. The saying \"Who Dat?\" originated in minstrel shows and vaudeville acts in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, then it was taken up by New Orleans Jazz and various Big band folks in the 1920s and 1930s. In the late 1960s, local Louisiana High Schools, St. Augustine High School and Patterson High School reportedly have been using the cheer and Gulf Coast fans of Alcorn State University and Louisiana State University picked up the cheer in the 1970s. Southern University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana claims to have originated the cheer in the late 1960s in their version: \"Who dat talking 'bout beating dem Jags?\"[163]",

                "content": "The Colorado Buffaloes football program represents the University of Colorado Boulder in college football at the NCAA Division I FBS level, and is a member of the Big 12 Conference. The team was a charter member of the Big 12 before leaving to join the Pac-12 Conference after the 2010 season. After 13 seasons in the Pac-12, the Buffaloes returned to the Big 12 in 2024. Before joining the Big 12, they were members of the Big Eight Conference. The CU football team has played at Folsom Field since 1924.[1] The Buffs all-time record is 716–520–36 (.577 winning percentage) as of the 2022 season. Colorado won the 1990 National Championship. The football program is 27th on the all-time win list and 40th in all-time winning percentage. Beginning in 1890, the Buffaloes have appeared in 29 bowl games (36th all-time), and won 27 conference championships, 5 division championships and an AP national championship in 1990. Folsom Field was built in 1924, and since then, Colorado has a 308–169–14 record at home through the 2016 season. The road game against the Nebraska Cornhuskers on November 24, 2006, was Colorado's 1,100th football game. The game on September 12, 2015, against Massachusetts was the school's 1,200th football game. Colorado won one national championship in football for 1990.[4]: 120 [5] Colorado won the national championship in 1990 under the direction of head coach Bill McCartney, who helmed the team from 1982 to 1994. While the Georgia Tech won the United Press International Coaches Poll, Colorado won the Associated Press, Football Writers Association of America and other polls. Colorado played the most difficult schedule in the country, beat more ranked teams and conference champions, and had a more talented roster.[6] Colorado capped the season with a 10–9 win over Notre Dame in the Orange Bowl, a rematch of the 1989 season Orange Bowl Game which Notre Dame won 21–6. Colorado's tie came against Tennessee, who was ranked No. 8, the first week of the season when Colorado was ranked No. 5. The second week gave the Buffs a scare, scoring with 12 seconds left in the game on a 4th and Goal attempt. The next week gave Colorado its only loss of the season, losing 23–22 to Illinois and dropping Colorado to No. 20 in the polls. Colorado then went on to beat teams ranked (at the time) No. 22 Texas, No. 12 Washington, No. 22 Oklahoma, and No. 3 Nebraska. They ended the season 7–0 in the Big Eight Conference for the second straight season. They then capped the season with a win over Notre Dame who were number 1 until a loss in their second to last game of the regular season.[7] Colorado has won 26 conference championships in over a century of college play, spanning through five conferences. † Co-champions † Co-champions The Buffaloes have played in 1,109 games during their 125 seasons, through 2014. In those seasons, 11 coaches have led Colorado to postseason bowl games: Bunny Oakes, Dallas Ward, Marcel M. Mazur, Bud Davis, Eddie Crowder, Bill Mallory, Bill McCartney, Rick Neuheisel, Gary Barnett, Dan Hawkins, Mike MacIntyre and Karl Dorrell.[8] Ten coaches have won conference championships with the Buffaloes: Fred Folsom, Myron Witham, William Saunders, Oakes, Jim Yeager, Sonny Grandelius, Mallory, McCartney and Barnett. The Buffaloes won the national championship in 1990, and have won a total of 28 conference championships. McCartney is the all-time leader in games coached with 153, total wins with 93, and conference wins with 58.[9] Folsom had the longest tenure as head coach, remaining in the position for 15 seasons. Harry Heller and Willis Keinholtz are tied for the highest overall winning percentage. Each served a single season and won eight of his nine games for a winning percentage of .889. Of coaches who served more than one season, Folsom leads with a .765 winning percentage. Davis, in terms of overall winning percentage, is the worst coach the Buffaloes have had with a .200 winning percentage. No Colorado coach has been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame, although McCartney was inducted into the Orange Bowl Hall of Fame in 1996. Mike MacIntyre had brief success with the program. Hired on Dec. 10, 2012,[10] MacIntyre compiled a 30–44 record over five-plus seasons at Colorado. In 2016, MacIntyre lead Colorado to a 10–2 regular season and a trip to the Pac-12 Championship Game. It was the first winning season for Colorado since 2005, ending a 10-year streak of finishing below .500. 2016 was also the best season for the Buffaloes since 2001. As well, it marked their first time playing in a conference championship game since the 2005 Big 12 Championship Game. The team also went 8–2 in the Pac-12 after having five conference wins in the previous five seasons. Mike MacIntyre was named the Walter Camp 2016 Coach of the Year by the Walter Camp Foundation, the second Colorado football coach to earn the honor (Bill McCartney in 1989). MacIntyre was also awarded the 2016 Pac-12 Coach of the Year, American Football Coaches Association's coach of the year and comeback coach of the year awards, the Associated Press coach of the year, and the Eddie Robinson coach of the year by the Football Writers Association of America. In 2018, the Buffaloes started out the season 5–0 with wins against rivals Colorado State, Nebraska, Arizona State, and UCLA - however, MacIntyre was fired as the head coach on November 18, 2018, after a six-game losing streak.[11] Mike Sanford was named interim Head Coach after Karl Dorrell was fired during the 2022 season, Sanford was previously the Buffaloes Offensive Coordinator for the start of the 2022 campaign.[12] On December 3, Colorado announced Deion Sanders as Head Football Coach.[13] A traditional college football rivalry with the Nebraska Cornhuskers restarted in the 1980s (many historical documents show the importance of this game going back to 1898) when Bill McCartney declared the conference opponent to be their rival. His theory was since Nebraska was such a powerhouse team, if Colorado was able to beat them then they would be a good team. Colorado began to repeatedly threaten Nebraska in the late 1980s, following their win over the Huskers in 1986, and then surpassed the Huskers for the Big 8 crown in 1989. In 1990, Colorado beat Nebraska 27–12 in Lincoln for the first time since 1967, en route to their first national title. From 1996 to 2000, the series was extremely competitive, with the margin of victory by NU in those five years being only 15 points combined. The rivalry was further buoyed by the introduction of the Big 12 Conference in 1996, which moved Oklahoma and Oklahoma State to the southern division with the four new schools from Texas, formerly in the Southwest Conference. Nebraska had traditionally finished the Big 8 conference schedule with a rivalry game with Oklahoma, but the two were now in different divisions, which meant they met every other year in the regular season. Colorado replaced Oklahoma as Nebraska's final conference game of the regular season, which further intensified the rivalry. In 2001 No. 1 Nebraska came to Folsom Field undefeated and left at the short end of a nationally televised 62–36 blowout. Both teams departed the Big 12 in 2011, as NU headed east to join the Big Ten and the future of the rivalry was in doubt. On February 7, 2013, Colorado and Nebraska agreed to renew the rivalry.[14][15][16][17][18][19] Colorado traveled to Lincoln in 2018 and won 33–28 (winning against Nebraska for the first time since 2007 and the first time in Lincoln since 2004). On September 7, 2019, Colorado mounted an improbable comeback after being down 17–0 at half, to win the game in overtime, 34–31. After a 3-year break, Nebraska lost 36–14 to Colorado in Boulder in 2023, but then won against Colorado 28-10 in 2024. Nebraska leads the series 49–21–2 through the 2023 season.[20] Colorado's in-state rival is the Colorado State Rams of the Mountain West Conference, located north of Boulder in Fort Collins. The two schools are separated by 45 miles (72 km) and both consider it important and noteworthy to beat the other for bragging rights for the next year. The two football teams annually compete in the Rocky Mountain Showdown for the Centennial Cup, played in Denver, Fort Collins, and Boulder. The trophy takes its name from the state of Colorado's nickname of \"The Centennial State\". The Buffaloes lead the series 67–22–2 through the 2023 season.[21] The rivalry with Utah ran from 1903 to 1962, in which Utah and Colorado played each other nearly every year; through 1962 they had met 57 times.[22] At the time, it was the second-most played rivalry for both teams (Utah had played Utah State 62 times;[23] Colorado had played Colorado State 61 times[24]). The rivalry was dormant until 2011, when both teams joined the Pac-12, renewing the rivalry on an annual basis. The Colorado–Utah rivalry remains the fifth-most played rivalry in Utah's history, and eighth-most in Colorado's history.[25][26] Utah leads the series 34-32-3 through the 2022 season.[27] Colorado has participated in 29 bowl games, with a record of 12–17 (.414). Colorado has one inductee into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. The following is a list of Consensus All-Americans from CU as listed[when?] in NCAA record books.[2] The following players have been honored by having their uniform numbers designated as retired numbers by the Buffaloes.[42][43] † = Posthumous honored In 2020, Colorado athletic director Rick George announced plans to re-issue uniform numbers 24, 67, and 11, with the support of the noted players (or their families).[42] Contemporary uniforms issued with those numbers will include a commemorative patch.[42] Nonetheless, no player has used any of those numbers since the announcement.[44][45][46][47] Uniform number 19 will remain unused for 19 years, after which it may be re-issued.[42] On November 1, 2023, Colorado's Big 12 opponents from 2024 through 2027 were revealed.[48] Home Schedule Away Schedule Announced schedules as of December 19, 2023.[49] Others beyond 2031: vs. North Texas, Sept. 4, 2032; at North Texas, Sept. 3, 2033; vs. Colorado State, Sept. 17, 2033; at Colorado State, Sept. 16, 2034; vs. Colorado State, Sept. 19, 2037; at Colorado State, Sept. 11, 2038.",

                "title": "Iowa State Cyclones football - Wikipedia",
                "content": "The Iowa State Cyclones football program is the intercollegiate football team at Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa. The team is coached by Matt Campbell. The Cyclones compete in the Big 12 Conference, and are a Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) member of the NCAA. The Cyclones play their home games at Jack Trice Stadium, with a capacity of 61,500. The Iowa State Cyclones football team drew an average home attendance of 60,384 in 2023, the 28th highest in college football.[3] Football first made its way onto the Iowa State campus in 1878 as a recreational sport, but it wasn't until 1892 that an organized group of athletes first represented Iowa State in football. In 1894, college president William M. Beardshear spearheaded the foundation of an athletic association to officially sanction Iowa State football teams. The 1894 team finished with a 6–1 mark, including a 16–8 victory over what is now the University of Iowa.[4] One of the pioneers of football, Pop Warner, spent time at Iowa State early in his career. In 1895 despite already being the coach at Georgia he was offered $25 per week to come to Iowa State, whose season started in mid-August while Georgia's started a month later, as well as to provide weekly advice during the rest of the season.[5] Soon after Warner left for Georgia, Iowa State had its first game of the season. Iowa State came into Evanston as the underdog Iowa State then defeated Northwestern 36–0. A Chicago sportswriter called the team \"cornfed giants from Iowa\" while the Chicago Tribune's headline read, \"Struck by a Cyclone\". Since then, Iowa State teams have been known as the Cyclones. Overall, the team had three wins and three losses and, like Georgia, Iowa State retained Warner for the next season. In 1896 the team had eight wins and two losses.[6] Despite leaving Cornell in 1898, Warner remained as the head coach of Iowa State for another year. During his last three years at Iowa State the team had a winning season but Warner was unable to match his 1896 triumph.[6] After playing at Iowa and then serving as an assistant coach for two years, Clyde Williams came to Ames as an assistant coach for ISU. Williams served as the Cyclones' head football coach for six seasons from 1907 to 1912. During that time, he had a coaching record of 32–15–2. This ranks him fifth at Iowa State in total wins and fourth at Iowa State in winning percentage.[7] In addition, he led Iowa State to two Missouri Valley Conference football titles in 1911 and 1912, which are the only two conference football championships in school history.[8] In addition to his football contributions Williams was the school's first men's basketball coach from 1908 to 1911, where he compiled a 20–29 record. He also served as Iowa State's baseball coach, and was their athletic director from 1914 to 1919. In 1914 Iowa State completed construction of their new football field and it was named Clyde Williams Field in honor of the former coach. Williams was inducted into the State of Iowa Hall of Fame in 1956. He is also one of the few people inducted into both the University of Iowa Athletics Hall of Fame (inducted 1993) and the Iowa State athletics Hall of Fame (inducted 1997).[9] The success Iowa State found in the inception of their football program was not replicated for most of the mid-20th century. In 1922 after having two different head coaches in as many years, ISU hired up-and-comer Sam Willaman away from East Technical HS in Cleveland, OH. When Willaman came to Iowa state, he brought with him six of his former East Tech players, including Jack Trice. Trice was the first African-American player at Iowa State, and one of the first African-Americans to play football in the Midwest. Trice suffered a severe malicious injury during a game at Minnesota in 1923, and died from complications. In 1997, Iowa State's Cyclone Stadium was renamed Jack Trice Stadium in his honor,[10] becoming the first and as of 2020, the only, major college football stadium to be named for a black man.[11] In his first season, Willaman's team finished with a 2–6 record, but posted a winning record in each of the three years that followed. His career coaching record at Iowa state was 14–15–3. This ranks him 16th in total wins and 13th in winning percentage in Iowa State football history.[7] In February 1931, George F. Veenker accepted an offer to become the head football coach for Iowa State.[12] Under Veenker, Iowa State experienced a brief period of success. When Veenker joined Iowa State, the team was coming off a winless season in 1930 and had lost 16 consecutive games dating back to October 1929. In his first year, the 1931 team defeated Missouri 20–0, Oklahoma 13–12, and Kansas State 7–6, compiling a 5–3 record and finishing in second place in the Big Six Conference. In November 1931, the Ames Daily Tribune-Times called Veenker \"a veritable miracle man of football\" for taking a school where \"Cyclone football morale couldn't have been lower\" and turning the program around in his first season. The highlight of Veenker's career as Iowa State's football coach was a 31–6 victory over the Iowa Hawkeyes in 1934. The game was the last meeting between the two schools until 1977. Veenker resigned in 1936, leaving an overall record of 21–22–8.[13] Shortly after Veenker's death in 1959, the university-owned golf course was renamed Veenker Memorial Golf Course in his honor.[14] During the 1938 season, James J. Yeager was in his second year as head coach. Despite going 3–6 in 1937, the Cyclones would go on to a then-best record of 7–1–1. The team was led by outstanding senior guard, Ed Bock. At the conclusion of the season Bock became the first consensus first-team All-American in Iowa State history.[15] Bock was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1970.[16] In 1942, Iowa State hired former Green Bay Packers All-Pro guard and three-time NFL champion Mike Michalske to be the new head coach. Michalske achieved moderate success in his five seasons at Iowa State, finishing with an 18–18 record. Abe Stuber took over as the Cyclones head coach in 1947 and coached the team until 1953, compiling a record of 24–38–3.[17] Vince DiFrancesca was the 21st head coach at Iowa State, leading the team to a record of 6–21–1 from 1954 to 1956.[18] Oregon State assistant coach Clay Stapleton was the head football coach at Iowa State for ten seasons. He is known mainly for his 1959 team the \"Dirty Thirty\". The Cyclones' struggles continued under his tutelage. Seven-win campaigns in 1959 and 1960 were the only winning seasons of his tenure.[19] Stapleton was relieved of his duties following the 1967 season. In 1968, in an attempt to turn the team around, Iowa State hired former standout Tennessee running back and up-and-coming Arkansas assistant Johnny Majors as the 24th head coach in program history. The rebuilding process got off to a slow start as the Cyclones finished 3–7 in his first two seasons. In 1970 the process started moving forward, and the team finished tied for 6th in the Big Eight with a record of 5–6. The 1971 team was picked to finish last in the Big Eight, but overcame odds to finish 4–3 in the conference and 8–3 in the regular season. The only teams they lost to in the conference, Nebraska, Oklahoma and Colorado, ended up first, second, and third in the final rankings. The team was led by junior running back George Amundson, who Majors called \"the finest athlete I have coached in any job I have had.\" Iowa State had one defensive all-conference pick, LB Keith Schroeder. Amundson rushed for 1,260 yards, including a school-record 15 touchdowns. End Keith Krepfle had 40 receptions for 570 yards and 12 touchdowns. Quarterback Dean Carlson threw for a school-record 1,867 yards. These efforts were enough to earn a bid to the 1971 Sun Bowl, the first bowl game in program history. Iowa State was slated to play against LSU on December 18, 1971. Iowa State was outmatched by LSU and future NFL quarterback Bert Jones, falling to the Tigers, 33–15. LSU was ranked 11 after the bowls, but Iowa State was left out of the top 20.[20] In 1972, Iowa State saw the loss of five starters and the move of George Amundson from running back to quarterback to replace Dean Carlson. The Cyclones lost linebacker Matt Blair to a pre-season injury, which forced him into a medical redshirt. The Cyclones tied Nebraska 23–23 on a missed extra point by Iowa State's Tom Goedjen. Three players went on to be named to the first team All-Big Eight team as well be honored as All-Americans, offensive lineman Geary Murdoch, defensive end Merv Krakau and quarterback George Amundson. Amundson was named Big Eight player of the year over Heisman Trophy winner, Johnny Rodgers. It was in this year that Iowa State became known as D-Tackle U, similar to Penn State's moniker \"Linebacker U\". Iowa State's 5–5–1 regular season record was enough to earn them an invitation to the 1972 Liberty Bowl against Georgia Tech. Despite outstanding play, Iowa State lost 31–30 on a failed late-game two-point conversion attempt by George Amundson.[21] At the conclusion of the 1972 season, Majors announced his departure from Iowa State to take the head coaching job at Pittsburgh.[22] In order to continue the success experienced under Johnny Majors Iowa State hired Earle Bruce out of Tampa. With newfound excitement around ISU football, the university broke ground on a new $7.6 million stadium that would eventually become Jack Trice Stadium. Despite future Minnesota Vikings star linebacker Matt Blair being a first team All-American, the Cyclones struggled to a 4–7 finish in Bruce's inaugural 1973 season. Over the next two seasons the Cyclones experienced moderate success but both seasons ended again with 4–7 records. However, Bruce's fourth team blossomed as one of the best teams in school history. En route to their 8–3 final record, the Cyclones scored wins against No. 7 Missouri and No. 9 Nebraska. In spite of the Cyclones' finishing the 1976 season ranked No. 19 in the AP Poll, Iowa State was ultimately snubbed by the bowls. Even so, Bruce was selected as Big Eight Coach of the Year.[23] Iowa State followed up their strong 1976 campaign with another eight-win season in 1977. The Cyclones beat No. 9 Nebraska for the second time in a row and were ranked as high as No. 16 in the AP Poll at one point. Their 5–2 conference record and 8–4 overall record were good enough for a bid to the 1977 Peach Bowl against North Carolina State. Ultimately Iowa State lost the game 14–24.[24] The Cyclones returned 14 starters from the 1977 Peach Bowl team including Heisman Trophy candidate, Dexter Green and Outland Trophy hopeful, Mike Stensrud. Iowa State's post season hopes came down to their last game against Colorado which was nationally televised. The game was close throughout, with ISU clinging to a 17–10 halftime lead. The second half was a defensive battle, but the ISU defense came up with big plays down the stretch. Mike Stensrud had 16 stops and caused a fumble to help ISU preserve a 20–16 win over the Buffaloes. The win earned ISU a bid to the 1978 Hall of Fame Classic against Texas A&M. Iowa State opened the game with two touchdowns, but was unable to convert the extra point on either attempt. The Cyclones were not able to contain future first round NFL draft pick Curtis Dickey, who rushed for 278 yards and a touchdown, and Iowa State lost 28–12.[25] At the conclusion of the 1978 season, Bruce announced he would leave Iowa State to take the head coaching job at Ohio State.[26] In order to continue the success found under Earle Bruce, Iowa State hired Oklahoma assistant Donnie Duncan as its 26th head football coach. He held the position for four seasons, from 1979 until 1982. His 1980 and 1981 Cyclones squads both made appearances in the national rankings. The 1981 Cyclones began the season at 5–1–1 and rose to No. 11 in the AP Poll. Led by future NFL players Dwayne Crutchfield, Dan Johnson, Karl Nelson and Chris Washington, the Cyclones tied No. 5 Oklahoma 7–7 and downed No. 8 Missouri 34–13.[27] However, the success was short lived, and Duncan resigned with a career record of 18–24–2 after the 1982 season.[28] Following the 1982 season Iowa State hired Jim Criner, who had won the 1980 NCAA Division I-AA Football Championship as the head coach at Boise State.[29] During Criner's tenure the Cyclones experienced mild success, however they were embroiled in controversy, with multiple players arrested on different charges as well as several NCAA allegations of wrongdoings. The allegations included coaches giving players cash as well as giving recruits rides and meals. Criner's rough tenure came to an end November 12, 1986, when the school announced his firing.[30] Criner's final career record at Iowa State was 17–25–2.[7] Jim Walden succeeded Jim Criner at Iowa State, where he compiled a 28–57–3 over eight seasons. ISU had been hit with scholarship reductions by the NCAA, both because of infractions by the previous coach, and an overall reduction in scholarships for Division I-A for the 1988 season.[31] In his first four years as Iowa State's head coach, he had just 57, 61, 63, and 67 scholarship players.[32] Walden had only 47 scholarship players on the squad that he took to Lincoln to play Nebraska on October 28, 1989, and they lost 49–17.[33] Walden was the last Iowa State coach to defeat Oklahoma, until Matt Campbell, which they did on October 20, 1990.[34] Oklahoma was ranked 16th in the nation at the time.[35] They had narrowly missed an upset the year before, losing in Ames 43–40. Walden's best record with the Cyclones was 6–5 in 1989. After the 1989 season, Walden was offered the head coaching job at the University of Arizona, but he declined, citing a number of people at Iowa State telling him it would be \"devastating\" if he left. In retrospect, Walden said he was \"too dumb\" to leave.[36] Walden's teams were plagued with injuries, especially at quarterback. In 1991, third-string quarterback Kevin Caldwell, who had begun the season as a tailback, started the final five games under center for the Cyclones.[37] Walden played four different quarterbacks in a 41–0 loss to Kansas in 1991.[38] In 1992, Walden installed the triple-option offense[39] and had mixed results. Iowa State lost to in-state rivals Iowa and UNI early in the 1992 season. The loss to UNI was Walden's first to a Division I-AA school. It was also UNI's first victory over the Cyclones since 1900.[40] Iowa State bounced back to shock the seventh-ranked Nebraska Cornhuskers at home on November 14, 1992. The victory was even more improbable as Walden's third-string quarterback, Marv Seiler, would make his first career start.[41] Walden's 1993 squad went 3–8, but with an upset of 18th ranked Kansas State.[42] Walden ended the 1993 campaign with a walk-on quarterback, Jeff St. Clair. In the spring of 1994, Walden recruited running back Troy Davis out of Miami, Florida. Davis later had consecutive 2,000-yard rushing seasons, but not until after Walden's departure. After starting the 1994 campaign 0–2, many fans began to criticize Walden's coaching ability. He began his weekly press conference by handing out the records of Dennis Erickson, Johnny Majors, and Earle Bruce while they were at Washington State and Iowa State. He then handed out Iowa State's overall record in football since fielding its first team in 1892, which, at the time, was 423–461–45, a .480 percentage, and compared his record to that one. Walden claimed that he was as good a coach or better than Erickson, Majors, and Bruce.[43] On Thursday, November 3, 1994, after starting the season 0–7–1, Walden informed his team that he would resign at season's end.[44] He was allowed to coach his final three games by the university, but was banned from coaching his last game at Colorado because of criticizing the officials after the Kansas State game. Kansas State's Nyle Wiren had body-slammed Walden's quarterback Todd Doxzon into the turf head first.[45] No penalty was called and Walden, with nothing to lose, went off on the officiating after the game: \"I've kept quiet too long, but since I'm leaving there's nothing they can do about me. I think the refereeing in this league is atrocious ... What do you do with bad officials? Do they get fired? You fire bad players and bad coaches. Bad officials get a raise and go fishing.\"[46] Walden coached his final game on November 12 against Nebraska in Ames. Iowa State had an 0–8–1 record and Nebraska was undefeated, with a No. 1 ranking. Unbelievably, Walden's Cyclones hung with the Huskers. At the end of the third quarter, Nebraska led by only two points, 14–12. The final quarter proved to be too much for Walden's team, and Nebraska won the game 28–12.[47] The Cyclones finished with a winless 0–10–1 record in Walden's final 1994 season. Walden ranks sixth at Iowa State in total wins and 22nd in winning percentage.[7] To turn the program around Iowa State hired Wisconsin defensive coordinator, Dan McCarney. The lone bright spot that McCarney inherited was sophomore running back phenom Troy Davis. Davis would go on to break nearly every Iowa State rushing and touchdown record, most that still stand.[48] Davis twice earned unanimous All-American honors, and became the first NCAA Division I-A running back to rush for over 2,000 yards in back-to-back seasons, a feat that has yet to be repeated. Davis finished 5th and 2nd in Heisman voting in his 1995 and 1996 campaigns respectively.[48] McCarney would go 10–34 in his first four seasons as the Cyclones head coach. In McCarney's sixth season, the Cyclones were finally able to put together a competitive team. The 2000 Cyclones were quarterbacked by Sage Rosenfels. Sage is among many former Cyclones from the 2000 team to make it to the NFL. Others were J. J. Moses, Reggie Hayward, Ennis Haywood, Tony Yelk, Mike Banks, Jordan Carstens, Tyson Smith and James Reed. Despite Iowa State being picked by the media to finish 5th in the Big 12 North Division, the Cyclones finished with a 5–3 conference record and a 9–3 overall record.[49] ISU finished the season ranked No. 25 and their nine wins were the program's best total since 1906. The Cyclones were then invited to play in the Insight.com Bowl against Pittsburgh, Iowa State's first appearance in a bowl game since the 1978 Peach Bowl. Iowa State was able to beat the Panthers 37–29, earning their first bowl victory in program history.[50] In an interesting side note, Pittsburgh's defensive coordinator in this game, Paul Rhoads, would eventually become the 31st Iowa State head coach. The 2001 season saw the emergence of JUCO transfer Seneca Wallace and star wide receiver Lane Danielson. The dynamic duo led the Cyclones to a last-second win over Iowa,[51] a 7–5 overall record, and an invitation to the Independence Bowl against Alabama, their second consecutive bowl game. The Cyclones just missed a 47-yard field goal attempt with 0:46 remaining in the fourth, which would have given State the lead and potential victory. The Cyclones lost the game 13–14. Subsequent to the game there was some question about whether or not the field goal was actually good, as it sailed directly over one of the uprights.[52] Seneca Wallace would lead the Cyclones to a 6–1 start in 2002, including a near-win against the Florida State Seminoles in the Eddie Robinson Classic at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri. Wallace dove towards the goal line at the last second but was ruled out shy of the end zone. During a later home game versus Texas Tech, Wallace scored on a 12-yard touchdown by running an estimated 120 yards backwards, forwards, and sideways on the field. Wallace dodged tackles and received numerous blocks from his teammates, including one devastating block by running back Michael Wagner. The play briefly catapulted Wallace into Heisman Trophy contention and was recognized by ESPN as the \"Play of the Week.\" It has since been recognized as one of the great plays in college football history. The play is known among Iowa State fans simply as \"The Run.\" Ultimately their 7–7 record was enough to receive a bid to the Humanitarian Bowl against Boise State on the Broncos' blue home field where they were defeated, 16–34.[53] The 2004 season would be much more successful than the disappointing 2–10 2003 campaign for the Cyclones. Redshirt freshman Bret Meyer took over the quarterback spot and paired up with fellow redshirt freshman receiver Todd Blythe to make a lethal combination. The season got off to a slow start with a 2–4 overall record and a 0–3 record in the conference. McCarney turned the season around by winning the next four games in a row. The Cyclones had a chance to win the Big 12 North title but fell short after a Missouri defender intercepted a pass intended for Jon Davis in the end zone. The Cyclones would go on to play the Miami RedHawks in the 2004 Independence Bowl. In the Independence Bowl, Iowa State prevailed for a 17–13 win as Meyer rolled up 236 yards of total offense. Meyer and Stevie Hicks each rushed for over 100 yards, an Independence Bowl first. All-Big 12 cornerback Ellis Hobbs iced the win with a 41-yard interception return in the game's final minute, and the Cyclones held on to win 17–13.[54] The Cyclones continued their success under McCarney in the 2005 season. High points during the season include a blowout win against No. 8 Iowa and a home victory over No. 22 Colorado. They missed out yet again on the Big 12 title when they lost in overtime to Kansas after a missed field goal by Bret Culbertson. They led the game in the 4th quarter but allowed Kansas to come back.[55] The Cyclones earned a berth in the 2005 Houston Bowl, but lost 24–27 to the TCU Horned Frogs. TCU opened the game with back-to-back first quarter rushing touchdowns. The Cyclones responded with two Bret Meyer touchdown passes and forced a TCU safety. Late in the fourth quarter the game was tied at 24–24 but the Cyclones ultimately suffered yet another bowl loss on a fourth-quarter field goal.[56] McCarney stepped down as head coach after a 4–8 2006 season, and finished his Iowa State head-coaching career as the program's winningest head coach with a 56–85 all-time record.[57] To replace Dan McCarney, Iowa State hired much-touted Texas defensive coordinator Gene Chizik.[58] The Cyclones wore 1977 throwback jerseys for the 2007 contest against Iowa and re-introduced gold pants as a standard part of their uniform. It marked the 30th anniversary since the resumption of the Cy-Hawk rivalry as well as the 30th anniversary of the 1977 Iowa State Peach Bowl team. They finished the season 3–9, including a 15–13 win over Iowa, and back-to-back wins against Kansas State and Colorado. All three wins were upsets. In 2008, Iowa State opened with two wins against weaker non-conference foes, before losing their next 10 games to finish the season 2–10. Chizik left the Cyclones suddenly after the season to become the head football coach at Auburn amid great acrimony.[59] Auburn defensive coordinator Paul Rhoads was introduced as the 31st head coach of the Iowa State Cyclones on December 20, 2008.[60] Rhoads had previously spent time at Iowa State as an assistant coach in the late 1990s and was raised only 20 miles from Ames in Ankeny.[61] His father, Cecil, was one of the winningest coaches in Iowa high school history,[62] coaching for more than three decades and has been inducted into the Iowa High School Football Coaches Hall of Fame. Rhoads' contract was reported to be a 5-year deal worth $5.75 million plus incentives.[63] To round out his coaching staff, Rhoads hired up-and-coming offensive coordinator out of Rice, Tom Herman and veteran defensive coordinator Wally Burnham. Rhoads opened his ISU career with a win over FCS North Dakota State. He then led Iowa State to a victory at Kent State first year, ending a 17-game Cyclones road losing streak.[64] In October 2009 the Cyclones defeated Baylor to end an 11-game losing stretch against conference opponents,[65] and then went on to defeat Nebraska in Lincoln for the first time since 1977.[66] Their 6–6 record was enough to earn them an invitation to the Insight.com Bowl against Minnesota. Rhoads would win his first bowl game in his inaugural year as coach at Iowa State, beating the Golden Gophers 14–13.[67] The lone highlight of the 2010 season was the first ever win at Texas in school history, upsetting the 22nd-ranked Longhorns 28–21.[68] The Cyclones would finish the season 3–5 in the Big 12 and 5–7 overall. In 2011 Iowa State started off the season 3–0 including a triple-overtime win over Iowa in Ames, and a win over Connecticut in East Hartford. The Cyclones would drop the next four games, starting out 0–4 in conference play, but they quickly bounced back with a 41–7 win on October 29 at No. 19 Texas Tech. In that game, Iowa State managed to rack up 512 total yards, the most since the Nov 22, 2008 game at Kansas State. Several other school records were broken, including first-ever win in Lubbock, largest margin of victory against a ranked opponent, and most points scored against a ranked opponent since November 9, 1996.[69] On November 18, Iowa State faced off against undefeated No. 2 Oklahoma State led by Heisman frontrunner Brandon Weeden and two time Biletnikoff winner Justin Blackmon[70] in Ames. Down 24–7 early in the second half, Iowa State came back with 17 unanswered points to force overtime. In overtime, Iowa State scored on its first play from scrimmage, but Oklahoma State answered back with their own touchdown. In the second overtime, Iowa State forced an interception and ran three Jeff Woody dives in a row to beat Oklahoma State 37–31, smashing Oklahoma State's chances of playing for a national championship and Brandon Weeden's Heisman shot. Iowa State became bowl eligible with the win and improved to 6–4. The win over Oklahoma State marked Iowa State's first ever win against an opponent in the top 6 (AP polls).[71] The Cyclones finished the season 6–6 and would receive an invitation to face the Rutgers Scarlet Knights in the Pinstripe Bowl, which they went on to lose, 27–13.[72] The Cyclones opened the 2012 season 3–0 including a 9–6 win at Iowa for the first time in 10 years. The other major highlight of the season was ending TCU's then-longest winning streak in college football by upsetting the No. 15 ranked Horned Frogs in Fort Worth 37–23.[73] The 2012 season ended 6–7 and a berth in that year's Liberty Bowl against the Tulsa Golden Hurricane. Iowa State opened the game strong but they ultimately lost 31–17.[74] While things appeared to be moving in a positive direction for the Cyclones, Rhoads' future teams were unable to continue the success of his earlier teams. In his final three seasons, the Cyclones won just four Big 12 games (including a winless conference record in 2014) and went 8–27 overall. The 2015 season proved to be particularly difficult, as the Cyclones held double-digit halftime leads against both Oklahoma State and Kansas State only to lose both games late in the fourth quarter. Following a 38–35 loss to Kansas State on November 21, in which he came under heavy criticism for play-calling in the game's final 90 seconds,[75] Rhoads was fired as head coach, effective at the conclusion of the season.[76][77] Matt Campbell, who had been the head coach at the University of Toledo, was named head coach at Iowa State on November 29, 2015.[78] Campbell signed a six-year contract worth $2 million his first year.[79] Campbell finished his first season as a Cyclone with a record of 3–9. Despite the disappointing record there were several high points during the season that showed progress including several near upsets and a blowout win over Texas Tech. The 66–10 rout of the Red Raiders included breaking several school records including points scored in a conference game.[80] In Campbell's second season, the Cyclones experienced greater on-field success. After opening the season 2–2, the Cyclones upset the eventual conference champions the No. 3 ranked Oklahoma Sooners.[81] This was Iowa State's first win in Norman since 1990 and only their sixth win against Oklahoma all-time. They followed up the Oklahoma win by going undefeated in the month of October, including a win over No. 4 TCU.[82] During the season the Cyclones were ranked as high as No. 14 in the AP Poll.[83] Finishing the regular season 7–5 and fourth in the Big 12, Iowa State was invited to the Liberty Bowl where they defeated No. 20 Memphis 21–20, their first bowl victory in eight years.[84] Campbell agreed to a six-year, $22.5 million extension with the school on November 27, 2017.[85] On November 30, 2017, Campbell was named the Big 12 Coach of the Year.[86] In the 2018 season, the Cyclones had a disappointing 1–3 start. However, coach Campbell lead the Cyclones to a regular season record of 8–4, including 6 Big 12 conference wins, and a win over No. 6 West Virginia.[87] The Cyclones were invited to the Alamo Bowl, where they lost 28–26 to Washington State.[88] On December 3, 2019, Campbell and Iowa State agreed to a contract extension through 2025.[89] Featuring Quarterback Brock Purdy,[90] and All-American Running Back Breece Hall,[91] the 2020 season was one of the most successful seasons in Cyclones history. Despite losing their season opener to the Louisiana Ragin' Cajuns from the Sun Belt Conference, they recovered quickly and defeated No. 18 Oklahoma two weeks later in Ames. Two weeks later, the No. 17 Cyclones lost to No. 6 Oklahoma State 24–21 in Stillwater. This would be their only conference loss for the season, as they went on to win the rest of their regular season games and clinched a spot in their first-ever Big 12 Championship Game, a rematch with No. 10 Oklahoma. At the time of the Big 12 Championship Game, the Cyclones were ranked No. 6 in the College Football Playoff rankings, their highest CFP ranking ever. Although the Cyclones lost this game 27–21, they were invited to the Fiesta Bowl, where they defeated the No. 25 Oregon Ducks 34–17 in their first-ever New Year's Six bowl game. After the season ended, the Cyclones finished ranked No. 9 in both the AP and Coaches Poll, their highest final ranking ever. On February 8, 2021, Campbell and Iowa State agreed to a contract extension through 2028.[92] In 2023, the Cyclones team became embroiled in an illegal sports-betting scandal. Both defensive lineman Isaiah Lee and the Cyclones’ leading rusher for the 2022 season Jirehl Brock were charged following an investigation into illegal sports betting, and they subsequently left the team. Three other players charged in the investigation were quarterback Hunter Dekkers, offensive lineman Jacob Remsburg and tight end DeShawn Hanika all of which remained on the team roster, with Remsburg being the only to play again for the Cyclones.[93] Iowa State has won two conference championships in school history. Both Iowa State conference championships were during their membership in the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association (MVIAA), which would later be known as the Big Eight Conference.[1] Iowa State currently has the longest conference championship drought in FBS history.[94] † Co-champions Iowa State competed in the Big 12 North Division from 1996 to 2010, winning a share of one division title during that time (since 2011, the conference has had the top two teams matched for the title game). † Co-champions As of Week 1 of the 2022 season, Iowa State has made 70 appearances[95] in the Associated Press poll and been ranked in the final Associated Press poll of the season three times.[96] Iowa State has appeared in 19 bowl games. Their overall bowl record is 6–13.[97] Iowa State has had 32 head coaches in program history.[18] The current head coach is Matt Campbell.[98] Every year, several publications release lists of their ideal \"team\". The athletes on these lists are referred to as All-Americans. The NCAA recognizes five All-American lists. They are the Associated Press (AP), American Football Coaches Association (AFCA), Football Writers Association of America (FWAA), Sporting News (TSN), and the Walter Camp Football Foundation (WCFF). Since the establishment of the team in 1892, Iowa State has had 16 players honored a total of 24 times as First Team All-America for their performance on the field of play. Included in these selections are 6 consensus selections, with four individuals earning the honor (Troy Davis and Breece Hall having earned the honor twice).[99][100] In 1951, the College Football Hall of Fame opened in South Bend, Indiana. Since then, Iowa State has had two players inducted into the Hall of Fame. Ed Bock is widely considered the greatest offensive lineman in Iowa State history. During his 1938 senior season the team finished with a then best 7–1–1 record. At the conclusion of the season Bock became the first consensus first team All-American in ISU history. Following his football career at Iowa State Bock worked for the Monsanto Chemical Company where he eventually rose to become CEO and President. Bock was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1970.[16] Troy Davis is considered the greatest running back in Iowa State history. Davis twice earned consensus All-American honors and was the first NCAA Division I-A running back to rush for over 2,000 yards in back-to-back seasons, a feat that has yet to be repeated. Davis finished 5th and 2nd in Heisman voting in his sophomore and junior seasons, respectively.[48] After completing his college career, Davis went on to have a 10-year career in the NFL and CFL, including as a member of the Edmonton Eskimos 2005 Grey Cup championship team. Davis was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in the class of 2016.[103] The Heisman Trophy is awarded annually to the nation's most outstanding college football player. In 1959 after Dwight Nichols led the Big 7 in total yardage (1,358) and points (54) he became the first player in Iowa State history to receive Heisman votes coming tied for 7th place overall. After his stellar 1972 campaign George Amundson became the second player in ISU history to receive Heisman votes when he finished in 7th place.[106] In 1995 after a 23-year absence Troy Davis became the third Cyclone to gain Heisman attention when he finished 5th. Then in 1996 at the conclusion of his second consecutive 2,000 yard season Davis nearly won the Heisman but ultimately was runner-up.[107] In 2020, Breece Hall became the fourth Cyclone to receive Heisman votes when he finished in 6th place.[108] Iowa and Iowa State played each other 24 times between 1894 and 1934, before the Cy-Hawk Trophy was established. It was originally conceived and created as a traveling trophy by the Greater Des Moines Athletic Club in 1976, the trophy was first presented to the winner by Iowa Governor Robert D. Ray in 1977. That game was the first meeting between the two since 1934. The series halted after 1934 after then University of Iowa Athletic Director and head football coach Ossie Solem would not return calls to reschedule the rivalry. The rivalry was once again temporarily put to a halt in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Of the 69 games in the series played through 2022, 40 of them have been played in Iowa City while 29 games have been contested in Ames. Iowa leads the series 47–24 through the 2024 season.[110] The teams first met in 1917, when both schools were members of the Big Eight Conference. The match-up continued as an annual conference game through the schools' shift into the Big 12 Conference. The series has been dominated by long winning streaks for both teams, with each team's longest winning streak at 10 games. Iowa State leads the series 54–50–4 through the 2024 season.[111] Missouri and Iowa State first met in 1896 and the regional rivalry was born. Before the 1959 match-up between the two schools, which took place in Ames, Iowa, field testing showed that the telephones the two schools used to communicate with their coaches in the coaches box were wired so that either school could hear what was happening on the other sideline. The problem was fixed before the game, but neither of the two coaches knew that. Northwestern Bell Telephone Company of Ames then decided to have a trophy made to commemorate the incident, and thus the Telephone Trophy was born.[112][113] When Missouri left the Big 12 for the SEC the rivalry was essentially ended. Missouri leads the rivalry 61–34–9 all-time.[114] Jack Trice Stadium (formerly Cyclone Stadium) is a stadium in Ames, Iowa. It is primarily used for college football, and is the home field of the Iowa State University Cyclones. It opened on September 20, 1975 (with a win against Air Force), and with hillside tickets it officially has 61,500 seats. The current record for single-game attendance, 61,500, was set on September 5, 2015, when the Cyclones played Northern Iowa. In 1997, the stadium was named in honor of Jack Trice, ISU's first African American athlete and the school's first athletics-related fatality. The stadium is the only stadium in Division I named for an African American individual.[115] The Steve and Debbie Bergstrom Indoor Training Facility opened in March 2004. It is a 92,000-square-foot (8,500 m2) multi-purpose, indoor practice facility. Inside the facility is a full-sized football field. Though typically associated with football, it is also used for practice by the softball and soccer teams, as well as community events. The building sits just northwest of Jack Trice Stadium and is part of the Johnny Majors Practice Complex. The facility cost $9.6 million to build and was funded by private gifts to the athletic department and ISU Foundation. On October 26, 2012, Iowa State dedicated a $20.6 million, 156,000 square-foot, expansion of the football facility with an additional lead gift from the Bergstrom family. This included replacing the playing surface of the indoor facility, a state-of-the-art strength and conditional facility, a coaches office complex, positional meeting rooms, an auditorium, and spacious locker rooms. This completed the goal for Iowa State to have a stand-alone football-only training facility.[116] Built in 1995 and located off the north end zone of Jack Trice Stadium, The Jacobson Athletic Building formerly housed the football offices, locker rooms, meeting rooms, strength and conditioning room, and sports medicine room. The space was renovated in 2008 and 2009 to use the vacated space by the football team. It now is home to men's and women's golf, tennis, swimming, wrestling, cross country and track and field. This allows the entire athletic department staff to be under one roof with the exception of men's and women's basketball and volleyball.[117] Originally, the Iowa Agricultural College (Iowa State University) teams were known as the \"Cardinals.\"[118] The name was changed after Sept. 29, 1895, when under legendary coach Pop Warner[119] the Cardinals routed the Northwestern Wildcats, 36–0. Inspired by an extremely active tornado (then called \"cyclone\") season, the next day, the Chicago Tribune headline read: \"Struck by a Cyclone.\" The article went on to say, \"Northwestern might as well have tried to play football with an Iowa cyclone as with the team it met yesterday.\" Since then the Iowa State teams have been known as the \"Cyclones.\"[118] Jack Trice was Iowa State's first African-American athlete; he was also the first and only Iowa State athlete to die from injuries sustained during athletic competition. He died three days after his first game playing for Iowa State against the University of Minnesota on October 6, 1923. He suffered a broken collarbone early on, but continued to play until he was trampled by a group of Minnesota players. It is disputed whether he was trampled on purpose or if it was an accident. A statue commemorates him outside of the stadium that is named for him, Jack Trice Stadium. His legacy was forgotten until the 1970s, when students discovered a plaque commemorating him in State Gym. They decided to put up a petition to name the stadium, at the time known as Cyclones Stadium, after him. Originally they got the field named after him in 1984. The stadium was named Jack Trice Stadium in 1997. It is the only NCAA Division I stadium named after an African-American.[120] The members of the Iowa State Chapter of Alpha Sigma Phi man and maintain a cannon that is discharged at home football games when the Iowa State team takes the field, following the first kickoff, the kickoff following half-time, all Iowa State kickoffs, and immediately following an Iowa State touchdown.[121] Iowa State uses a cardinal, named Cy, as its mascot instead of an actual tornado or Cyclone. In 1954, the student pep council began the process of creating a mascot to build school spirit. As it would be difficult to, quote \"stuff a cyclone\", a cardinal was selected from the school's official colors and original team namesake. The name of Cy was selected via a naming contest, being submitted by 17 people.[122] Prior to the football matchup against the University of Colorado on November 12, 2005, a tornado touched down in Ames, Iowa, and forced fans to either stand out in the parking lot and watch the storm or flee to shelter in Hilton Coliseum. It created such an atmosphere that Iowa State was able to win over the favored Buffaloes 30–16. When asked about the event, Colorado coach Gary Barnett said, \"I thought we had a pretty good mascot. But when we showed up at Iowa State and they had a real tornado, that's the real deal.\"[121] Iowa State is well regarded for tailgating. The layout of Jack Trice Stadium on a flood-plain accommodates ample parking space immediately surrounding the stadium. Cyclone fans typically arrive hours before kick-off in large SUVs and RVs to grill popular Midwestern foods such as pork loin, bratwurst, hamburgers and hot dogs. Located immediately outside and north of Jack Trice Stadium, the victory bell is rung following a Cyclone victory. Forged in 1890 the victory bell served on campus to signal dismissal from classes before being moved to Clyde Williams Field and subsequently to Jack Trice Stadium.[121] To go along with the installation of the new video board and sound system prior to the 2011 football season, a tornado siren is sounded after touchdowns, defensive stands, and other big plays. While the tornado siren is a new tradition, it is one that numerous Cyclones fans have asked the Iowa State athletic director to implement for many years, especially since the Colorado-Iowa State game of November 12, 2005, when a tornado touched down in Ames and sirens were heard throughout town during what normally would have been pregame activities. Since then, its implementation has become an extremely popular aspect of the Jack Trice Stadium experience.[citation needed] Schedules as of Aug 30, 2024.[123]",

The Bengals assured their late-season fight for the postseason would stay alive Saturday, taking down the Broncos, 30-24, on a walk-off touchdown in overtime from Tee Higgins, his third score of the game. Denver came into the Week 17 matchup looking for either a win or tie to secure its first playoff spot since 2015. But despite a valiant effort from rookie quarterback Bo Nix to keep the Broncos in the game, plus a missed Bengals field goal in overtime, Cincinnati held on to keep its playoff hopes alive behind a huge game from Joe Burrow. Burrow totaled 412 passing yards, three touchdowns — all of which went to Higgins — and no interceptions in the thrilling win in Cincinnati. The tension between the two AFC playoff contenders heated up in the fourth quarter, when the Broncos and Bengals scored two touchdowns each in a span of around 11 minutes. Although Denver, now 9-7, didn't clinch a playoff spot as it had hoped entering Week 17, Nix also turned in an outstanding performance. The rookie completed 24 of his 31 passes for 219 yards, three touchdowns and an interception, also putting on a show with two clutch touchdown passes in the fourth quarter to Marvin Mims Jr. Three teams still trail Denver in the AFC wild-card race, including Cincinnati, which is now 8-8. With Saturday's win, the Bengals pushed the conference's playoff chaos into Week 18. Denver, Cincinnati, Indianapolis and Miami could all still compete for the No. 7 seed in the AFC due to the Bengals' overtime win over the Broncos.

STREAM: Watch Broncos vs. Bengals live with Fubo (free trial) SN's NFL HQ: Live NFL scores | Updated NFL standings | Full NFL schedule (All times ET) 8:01 p.m. TOUCHDOWN — What a game, and what an ending. Naturally, it's Higgins that finishes the job for Cincinnati. His third touchdown of the game, right after an outstanding catch, wins it for the Bengals. The AFC's final playoff spot will be up for grabs in Week 18, and the Bengals are alive in the postseason chase. BENGALS WIN IN OT ‼️Insane game.🎥: @NFL pic.twitter.com/sI7n2NmTTY 8:00 p.m. — What a beautiful, clutch snag from Tee Higgins, continuing his huge performance. The 31-yard play gives Cincinnati great field position to win this one. JOE'S TAKING THIS INTO HIS OWN HANDS.📺: #DENvsCIN on NFL Network📱: Stream on #NFLPlus pic.twitter.com/3izlmZGlSB 7:58 p.m. — With Chase Brown sidelined, Khalil Herbert is in at running back for the Bengals. He goes for 13 yards, with his team now inside the 40-yard line. 7:56 p.m. — Burrow continues an excellent performance, going to Iosivas for 16 yards. A field goal can win it for Cincinnati, but after York's 33-yard miss just minutes ago, you can be sure they'll be strategic about when they kick it. 7:54 p.m. — Denver goes three-and-out, and this game just continues to be thrilling. After everything that's happened, the Bengals will have one more shot to win it. 2:20 remains. Cincinnati has no timeouts. They need to score to keep the AFC's final playoff spot open. 7:50 p.m. — No. Way. Cade York misses the 33-yard field goal to win it. Cincinnati would've kept its playoff hopes alive if the kick didn't hit off the upright. Now, the Broncos can clinch a playoff spot just by eating the rest of the clock, as a tie will function the same as a win. Cincinnati needs the ball back to continue its playoff fight. BENGALS MISS THE FIELD GOAL IN OT.📺: #DENvsCIN on NFL Network📱: Stream on #NFLPlus pic.twitter.com/drXHTxSv5v 7:48 p.m. — Another big play for Cincinnati comes from Higgins, a pickup of 20 yards. The Bengals are down to the 14-yard line and can win it with any type of score. 7:47 p.m. — Mike Gesicki fights for a 12-yard gain, and the Bengals are in field-goal range. 7:44 p.m. — Now, the Bengals defense comes up huge, forcing a three-and-out from Denver. The Broncos punt with five minutes remaining in overtime. An important note: a tie brings the same result as a Broncos win, meaning Denver would clinch a playoff spot with a tie. Bengals playoff hopes stay alive with this 3rd down incompletion.📺: #DENvsCIN on NFL Network📱: Stream on #NFLPlus pic.twitter.com/ZraKYKcJzB 7:40 p.m. — What a game for Zach Allen. He notches back-to-back sacks on Burrow, his third and fourth of the game. The Broncos force the Bengals to punt on the first drive of overtime, and Denver now has a shot to win it. 7:39 p.m. — Cincinnati gets two gains to start overtime, first with a grab from Gesicki, then with a five-yard penalty on Denver. Chase Brown remains on the sidelines. 7:35 p.m. — The Bengals win the coin toss and will get the ball first in overtime. Another reminder: the Broncos make the playoffs with a win or tie. The Bengals only keep their playoff hopes alive if they win. 7:33 p.m. — Burrow takes a knee, sending this game to overtime. This has become a thriller, with Denver continually fighting back to tie the game. Nix is up to three touchdown passes, while Burrow has 315 passing yards and two touchdown passes. 7:32 p.m. — Denver opts for the extra point, tying this game at 24, instead of a two-point try for the win. With eight seconds left in regulation, they're tied in Cincinnati. 7:29 p.m. TOUCHDOWN — Oh my goodness, Bo Nix and Marvin Mims Jr. do it again. With a playoff berth on the line on fourth down, Nix goes deep for Mims once again, and he held onto the ball in the end zone for six. Now, a critical decision: tie the game with an extra point, or attempt to win it? BO NIX ABSOLUTE CINEMA.📺: #DENvsCIN on NFL Network📱: Stream on #NFLPlus pic.twitter.com/LpdaNr6sVi 7:27 p.m. — Denver reaches a 4th & 1 with 14 seconds left. A massive play is coming up, as a stop could seal a Bengals win. The Broncos need a miraculous touchdown. 7:26 p.m. — With under a minute left, Nix gets the Broncos inside the Bengals' 40-yard line with a completion to Sutton. They need a touchdown to pull within one point, then could either tie it or attempt to win it with a two-point conversion. 7:25 p.m. — A griddy from Joe Burrow: WE GOT A JOE BURROW GRIDDY.📺: #DENvsCIN on NFL Network📱: Stream on #NFLPlus pic.twitter.com/aDx7J7TBYP 7:22 p.m. TOUCHDOWN — Joe Burrow sneaks it in from a yard out, giving the Bengals a late lead. If they can hold on, the AFC's No. 7 seed will remain up for grabs. If Denver can pull off a last-minute comeback and win this one, it will secure the final AFC playoff spot. Burrow sneaks for the lead with 1:29 left!📺: #DENvsCIN on NFL Network📱: Stream on #NFLPlus pic.twitter.com/eP9p2IA2pN 7:20 p.m. — Chase Brown appears to be injured after a five-yard gain. He had the option to either go for the touchdown or slide and take more time off the clock, and he went for the score. After being tackled at the one-yard line, he remained on the field before appearing to walk off on his own. 7:17 p.m. — On 3rd & 6 with just over a minute remaining, Burrow once again finds Chase. An 11-yard play not only makes a potential Bengals field goal easier, but allows them to eat more time off the clock. 7:13 p.m. — All momentum has swung in the Bengals' favor. Now, Burrow goes to his star receiver, Ja'Marr Chase, for a 38-yard gain. The Burrow-Chase connection has been the NFL's most dominant this season, and now, it helps set the Bengals up for a potential game-winning score. Joe and Ja'Marr have the @Bengals in position to take the lead.📺: #DENvsCIN on NFL Network📱: Stream on #NFLPlus pic.twitter.com/3qyD42sYVe 7:11 p.m. — Intercepted!

Nix is intercepted! @Bengals take it back.📺: #DENvsCIN on NFL Network📱: Stream on #NFLPlus pic.twitter.com/rKbTszEPjk 7:08 p.m. — Nix picks up a huge first down with his legs. The five-yard scramble gives Denver a fresh set of downs, with the Broncos approaching field-goal territory. A reminder: They'll be in the 2024 NFL playoffs with a win. 7:04 p.m. — Burrow went to Higgins on a critical third down play, but he lost the football after making the short-range catch. The question was: should it have been ruled incomplete, or a fumble? After Sean Payton challenges the incompletion, the ruling is reversed, and Surtain recovered the fumble. Denver takes over, a potentially significant turn of events. What a play, PS2!!! 🎮📺: NFLN | @PatSurtainll pic.twitter.com/lSg2vX6Cvk 7:03 p.m. — An outstanding angle on the gorgeous touchdown connection between Nix and Mims: The best view you'll see of that Bo Nix-Marvin Mims connection 🔥📺: #DENvsCIN on NFL Network📱: Stream on #NFLPlus pic.twitter.com/6Vnb9Sog2r 7:01 p.m. — Chase is up to seven catches on the day and two on this drive, setting up a third and short for Cincinnati.

Things are getting extremely interesting between Denver and Cincinnati, as each team's playoff chances could come down to this fourth quarter. HE GONE!@marvindmims | 📺: NFLN pic.twitter.com/CwxTHQ5dvJ 6:53 p.m. — Nix goes to Sutton for 13 yards, picking up a first down. If Denver can't come back in this game, it will have to leave its playoff fate to Week 18. 6:48 p.m. TOUCHDOWN — The Bengals have reclaimed the lead in this essential Week 17 matchup for their playoff hopes. And once again, it's Burrow's connection to Higgins that gets the job done. After a 12-yard strike, Cincinnati is up by seven. Burrow to Higgins AGAIN.Bengals re-take the lead.📺: #DENvsCIN on NFL Network📱: Stream on #NFLPlus pic.twitter.com/UejCeEE24g 6:44 p.m. — Chase Brown converts on 4th & 2, keeping Cincinnati's drive alive. 6:39 p.m. — Cincinnati had a massive 50-yard touchdown from Iosivas ... but it was brought back due to an illegal shift. The Bengals are still moving the football as the third quarter comes to a close, though. Burrow picks up the 3rd & 13 conversion to end the quarter!📺: #DENvsCIN on NFL Network📱: Stream on #NFLPlus pic.twitter.com/V2ptYyGLqn 6:35 p.m. — Down goes Burrow, for the third time tonight. Cooper and Allen combine for the sack. 6:30 p.m. TOUCHDOWN — Nix finds his top receiver, Courtland Sutton, for a nice six-yard score. Denver and Cincinnati are now tied in a huge game.

Nix has completed 10 of his 12 passes, but for just 68 yards, no touchdowns and no interceptions. 5:51 p.m. — The Bengals effectively shut down the Broncos' offense before the break hits, using two sacks to keep them out of field-goal range. Cincinnati takes its lead into halftime. 5:48 p.m. — Cincinnati's defense comes up with back-to-back sacks on Nix as Denver looks to quickly get in field-goal territory before halftime. 5:42 p.m. TOUCHDOWN — Cincinnati takes the lead.

The game got off to an extremely slow start, with the teams combining for five punts on the first five possessions of the evening. The Cardinals were the first ones to drive deep into opposing territory, but they failed on a fourth-and-1 opportunity just outside L.A.'s 10-yard line and turned it over on downs. The Rams finally got going on a late second-quarter drive as Matthew Stafford hit Cooper Kupp and Puka Nacua with deep completions while under heavy duress. He also scrambled for a first down later in that drive, taking off from the pocket on a second-and-long and setting up what eventually became a 1-yard touchdown run by Kyren Williams. Los Angeles would tack on a Joshua Karty field goal later in the half to take its two-score lead into the break. Will the Rams hang on to their lead, or will the Cardinals stage a comeback? We'll find out soon enough. In the meantime, keep it locked to our live blog throughout the evening as we update you with stats, scores and highlights. Date: Saturday, Dec. 28 | Time: 8:10 p.m. ETLocation: SoFi Stadium (Inglewood, California)Channel: NFL Network | Stream: fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports App Betting odds: Rams -6.5, O/U 48 (via Caesars Sportsbook) The streak continues... Ahkello Witherspoon knocked down what looked like it was about to be Trey McBride's first TD of the year. L.A. got into Cards territory again but stalled out about and had to settle for a 53-yard field goal from Joshua Karty. That said, they look like they will take a two-score lead into the half, unless Arizona puts together a pretty quick scoring drive in the next 27 seconds. The Rams caught a big break on that third-and-10. Puka Nacua looked pretty easily short of the first down but the Rams got their next play off before there could be a review. The Rams will have a chance to take a two-score lead here at the end of the half. Arizona has had one real drive with any success moving the ball, and it ended with a turnover on downs deep in L.A. territory. Kyren gets the scoring started by plunging in from the 1-yard line. It's a 9-play, 60-yard scoring drive, highlighted by several really nice plays from Stafford and capped off by Williams' 16th touchdown of the season. Matthew Stafford NEVER scrambles. I believe he had one scramble all season coming into this game. He just picked up a huge first down with his legs right there, giving the Rams an opportunity to score. And he just did it again, this time to Nacua. Sheeeeesh. Well, that throw looked much more like the Matthew Stafford we've seen throughout his career. Outrageous throw under pressure on the deep corner route to Cooper Kupp. Got clobbered as he let it go. James Conner is now being looked at by trainers on the sideline. He was questionable coming into this game after being limited all week. All we hear about McBride lately is about how he hasn't scored a receiving touchdown yet this year. But the dude is just an awesome player, as he showed on that catch over the middle. Unfortunately, it's coming back due to an illegal man downfield penalty. The Rams are averaging 2.8 yards per play. This is some truly gross offense. Just when it looked like we might get some points, instead we will not. Arizona drove deep into Rams territory but rookie DL Jared Verse stuffed James Conner on fourth-and-1 to get the ball back for L.A. Marvin Harrison Jr.'s best game of the season came back in Week 2 against these same Rams. He had 2 touchdowns in the first quarter, after which the Cardinals were blowing the Rams out and basically ran the ball the rest of the day. He has 2 catches for 41 yards so far. We've now opened the game with five consecutive punts. Maybe we will see some points soon. Kyler Murray tried to get into his improvisation mode on third-and-long, but there was nowhere for him to go with several Rams defenders awaiting him in the backfield. Making matters worse, he tripped over his feet and took an 18-yard sack. Yikes. Marvin Harrison Jr. has been almost exclusively asked to make contested catches this season, and has generally struggled to do so. But he just made a fantastic grab to get the Cardinals out of the shadow of their own end zone. Nice job of getting the ball on his back shoulder. Very strange start for Stafford. He missed on back-to-back throws on first and second down to open L.A.'s second drive. Inaccurate on first and then not on the same page as the receiver on second. Rams punted again after that. Arizona got lucky that the officials ruled Trey McBride's forward progress had been stopped before he fumbled inside the 10-yard line. Kyler Murray converted a third-down opportunity after that play but the Cards couldn't muster much else, so it's back to the Rams. An uncharacteristically inaccurate throw from Matthew Stafford on third-and-5 cut L.A.'s drive short. After a nice gain by Puka Nacua on first down, the Rams went nowhere and then punted. The Rams and Cardinals are certainly following quite an ... interesting game. Let's see what they've got in store for us tonight. No surprises here for L.A. No Trey Benson after he was listed as questionable but James Conner is playing. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. CBS Sports is a registered trademark of CBS Broadcasting Inc.

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. The NFC West has been tight all season, but finally some separation has occurred with the playoffs on the horizon. The Los Angeles Rams bested the New York Jets in Week 16 to win their fourth straight, securing a division lead with two games to go. The Arizona Cardinals, meanwhile, failed to outlast the Carolina Panthers in overtime of their last contest, resulting in elimination from the postseason altogether. Now, the two rivals will go head to head in a Saturday night showdown with additional playoff implications. While Arizona is out of the race, Kyler Murray and Co. can still play spoiler -- and perhaps audition for 2025 jobs -- against a Rams team that is trying to stay ahead of the Seattle Seahawks, who won their game on Thursday night. How can you tune in? Which matchups are most pivotal? And who's primed to walk away with the win? Here's our preview and sports betting prediction: Date: Saturday, Dec. 28 | Time: 8:10 p.m. ETLocation: SoFi Stadium (Inglewood, California)TV: NFL Network | Stream: fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Rams -5.5 (SportsLine consensus) It's wild how much has changed since September, when the Cardinals trounced the Rams, 41-10, and Kyler Murray looked like a potential MVP candidate throwing it up to Marvin Harrison Jr. Arizona has stayed relatively scrappy, but Jonathan Gannon's squad has lacked a finishing touch, or a reliable passing attack (ranked 21st), leaving the Cardinals especially dependent on a ball-control rushing attack. That bodes poorly for a rematch in L.A., where the Rams haven't lit the world on fire but are always liable to explode off the arm of Matthew Stafford. Plus, Sean McVay's team still has January ball ahead. Pick: Rams 26, Cardinals 16 © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. CBS Sports is a registered trademark of CBS Broadcasting Inc.

The Cardinals are coming off a 36-30 overtime loss against the Carolina Panthers in NFL Week 16, a loss that eliminated them from NFL postseason contention. The Rams beat the New York Jets, 19-9. The Cardinals are 7-8 on the season. The Rams are 9-6. Follow our live updates of the game, which is being played at the Rams' SoFi Stadium, for the latest score, news, notes and analysis of the Week 17 NFL game between NFC West rivals Saturday. NFL Week 17 picks, predictions:Who wins Cardinals vs Rams game, other games? A somewhat controversial play went in the Rams' favor toward the end of the first half and it would end up helping Los Angeles score on its second straight possession. The play in question involved a completion from Matthew Stafford to wide receiver Puka Nacua that went for 10 yards and a first down, although replays showed his elbow appeared to be down before the first-down marker. There was no video booth replay, Cardinals coach Jonathan Gannon did not throw a challenge flag, and the play held up in LA's favor. Stafford then completed back-to-back passes to Nacua for 25 and seven yards and after consecutive incompletions, the Rams got a 53-yard field goal from Joshua Karty to make it 10-0 with 27 seconds left in the second quarter. Kyler Murray, meanwhile, was sacked for a 6-yard loss on Arizona's ensuing possession to send the game into halftime. Despite trailing, the Cardinals hold the edge in time of possession, 18:12 to 11:48, and they're holding their own in total yards, trailing 167 to 140. Murray is 13 of 19 for 124 yards and Stafford is 8 of 20 for 123 yards. Nacua leads all receivers with six receptions for 88 yards and Arizona's Trey McBride has four catches for 46 yards. The Rams went 60 yards on nine plays and scored on a 1-yard touchdown, second effort run by Kyren Williams. Big plays included a 29-yard completion from Matthew Stafford to Cooper Kupp, a 15-yard catch and run by Puka Nacua, and a 12-yard scramble by Stafford. Earlier, the Cardinals got into Rams’ territory on their fourth possession of the game and looked like they were going to be on their way to a score of some sort midway through the second quarter. A 34-yard pass completion from Kyler Murray to tight end Trey McBride, however, was wiped out because of an illegal-man-downfield penalty on Arizona rookie lineman Isaiah Adams. The flag moved the ball back, well out of field goal range, and the Cardinals were forced to punt. Running back James Conner, active but playing with a sore knee, left the game during that series but has yet to be ruled out. Score: Rams 7, Cardinals 0 (3:23 left in second quarter) The first quarter between the Cardinals and Rams is over and done at Sofi Stadium and the game remains scoreless. There have been five punts, three by the Rams and two by the Cardinals, but Arizona is driving. Quarterback Kyler Murray has completed seven of his first eight passes for 76 yards, including two to tight end Trey McBride for 41 yards. The Cardinals lead in total yards, 82-46 Score: Cardinals 0, Rams 0 (end of first quarter) The game is on Saturday, Dec. 28 at 6:15 p.m. MST, 8:15 p.m. ET.

                "content": "The Nebraska Cornhuskers football team competes as part of the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision, representing the University of Nebraska–Lincoln in the Big Ten Conference. Nebraska has played its home games at Memorial Stadium since 1923 and sold out every game at the venue since 1962.[5] Nebraska is among the most storied programs in college football history and has the eighth-most all-time victories among FBS teams.[6] NU has won forty-six conference championships and five national championships (1970, 1971, 1994, 1995, and 1997), along with seven other national titles the school does not claim. Its 1971 and 1995 title-winning teams are considered among the best ever.[7][8] Nebraska's three Heisman Trophy winners – Johnny Rodgers, Mike Rozier, and Eric Crouch – join twenty-four other Cornhuskers in the College Football Hall of Fame.[9] The program's first extended period of success came just after the turn of the twentieth century. Between 1900 and 1916, Nebraska had five undefeated seasons and completed a stretch of thirty-four games without a loss, still a program record.[10] Despite a span of twenty-one conference championships in thirty-four seasons, the Cornhuskers did not experience major national success until Bob Devaney was hired in 1962. Devaney won two national championships and eight conference titles in eleven seasons as head coach, but perhaps his most lasting achievement was the hiring of Tom Osborne as offensive coordinator in 1969.[11] Osborne was named Devaney's successor in 1973 and over the next twenty-five years established himself as one of the best coaches in college football history with his trademark I-formation offense and revolutionary strength, conditioning, and nutrition programs.[12][13][14] Following Osborne's retirement in 1997, Nebraska cycled through five head coaches before hiring Matt Rhule in 2022.[15] Nebraska has had thirty-one head coaches in the program's history, with five others coaching at least one game on a non-permanent basis. The program has been coached by Matt Rhule since 2023. Seven past Nebraska head coaches have been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame: Edward N. Robinson, Fielding H. Yost, Dana X. Bible, Biff Jones, Bob Devaney, Tom Osborne, and Frank Solich. Osborne is the program's all-time leader in most major categories; his 0.836 career winning percentage is fifth-highest in major college football history.[17] Thirteen Nebraska coaches have won a conference championship at the school, and Devaney and Osborne combined to win five national titles. Nebraska has won five consensus national championships.[18] The first of these came in 1970 under the leadership of head coach Bob Devaney and featured a unique quarterback rotation between Van Brownson and Jerry Tagge.[19] Nebraska entered the 1971 Orange Bowl ranked third nationally, but losses by No. 1 Texas and No. 2 Ohio State – along with a late game-winning touchdown rush by Tagge – gave NU its first consensus title. The Cornhuskers repeated as national champion the following season with Tagge as the full-time starter, a team that is often considered one of the best in college football history.[20] Nebraska was challenged just once all season, a 35–31 victory over No. 2 Oklahoma in Norman that was billed the \"Game of the Century.\"[20] Wins over Colorado and Alabama (the latter in the 1972 Orange Bowl) made NU the only national champion to defeat the teams that finished No. 2, No. 3, and No. 4 in the final AP poll.[20] Tom Osborne replaced Devaney in 1973, and despite several near-misses, did not win his first national title until over two decades into his tenure.[a] Nebraska's 1994 title-winning season, nearly derailed when star quarterback Tommie Frazier was sidelined with blood clots in September, was capped by a 24–17 victory over Miami in the Orange Bowl.[21] With Frazier at full strength the following season, NU repeated as national champion; its 62–24 Fiesta Bowl victory over Florida was the largest margin of victory in a national title game until 2023. The team is often considered among the best in college football history.[22][23] Osborne's final title came in 1997, two years later. The most significant moment of the season was a game-tying touchdown against Missouri that became known as the \"Flea Kicker.\"[24] Top-ranked Nebraska won the game in overtime, but was jumped in both major polls by Michigan. Postseason wins over Texas A&M and Tennessee vaulted NU back ahead of the Wolverines in the Coaches Poll, though not the AP Poll, sharing the national championship. Unclaimed national championships Nebraska has been awarded seven other national championships from NCAA-designated major selectors the school does not claim.[18] Nebraska has won forty-six conference championships. The earliest of these came in the short-lived Western Interstate University Football Association, one of college football's first conferences, which NU participated in for six seasons with Iowa, Kansas, and Missouri.[25] The conference dissolved in 1897 and NU spent the next decade as an independent until the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association – which became the Big Eight – was founded in 1907. Nebraska dominated the MVIAA in its early years, winning nine championships in twelve years before leaving the conference in 1919 to again play as an independent. NU rejoined in 1921 and won the conference twelve times before 1940. Following Biff Jones's departure to become the athletic director at Army in 1941, NU went twenty-two seasons without a conference championship. Devaney was hired in 1962 and quickly turned NU into a powerhouse, winning eight conference titles and two national titles during his eleven years as head coach. Osborne succeeded him in 1973 and won thirteen conference championships; the late-season meeting between Nebraska and Oklahoma often became a de-facto Big Eight championship game, as the two schools combined to win at least a share of the conference title thirty-three times during Devaney and Osborne's combined thirty-six-year tenure.[7] Osborne's final conference championship was a victory in the 1997 Big 12 Championship Game in the second year of its existence. Nebraska won the Big 12 again two years later, its most recent conference championship. Nebraska won ten division championships. Nine of these were in the Big 12's North Division, which NU played in until its departure for the Big Ten in 2011. Nebraska won one division title across thirteen seasons in the Big Ten's Leaders Division and West Division; the conference disbanded its divisions prior to the 2024 season.[27] † Co-champion Nebraska has played in fifty-four bowl games, including a then-record thirty-five straight from 1969 to 2003, with a record of 27–27.[28] Nebraska declined an invitation to play in the second-ever Rose Bowl Game following the 1915 season and did not make its bowl debut until 1941. Twenty-one years later, Bob Devaney's first season ended with the first bowl victory in program history, a 36–34 victory over Miami (FL) in the 1962 Gotham Bowl.[28] During Devaney's tenure, Nebraska began a stretch of thirty-five consecutive seasons with a bowl appearance, a streak that ended in 2004. The program regularly featured in the Orange Bowl due to the Big Eight's bowl affiliations, playing in the game seventeen times between 1954 and 1997, first against SEC opposition and later against the ACC.[28] Memorial Stadium, known as The Sea of Red, has been home of the Cornhuskers since 1923 and is the location of an ongoing NCAA-record 403-game sellout streak. The sellout streak dates back to 1962, Bob Devaney's first season at Nebraska.[29][30] The stadium becomes the \"third-largest city in Nebraska\" on game days, as its capacity exceeds that of every Nebraska town except for Omaha and Lincoln.[31] The stadium has undergone a series of expansion since 1923, bringing the official capacity to 85,458.[1] The largest crowd in Memorial Stadium history occurred on September 20, 2014, a Nebraska win over Miami with an announced attendance of 91,585.[2] Three statues sit outside of the stadium. The oldest, unveiled in 1997, depicts six Nebraska defenders tackling a ball carrier.[32] Creator Fred Hoppe said, \"the monument displays the sense of pride that Nebraskans have for their football team.\" In 2006, Hoppe created a statue of Tom Osborne with his arm around quarterback Brook Berringer, which is located outside the Osborne Athletic Complex.[33] On August 30, 2013, a bronze statue of Bob Devaney was unveiled at the main entrance of the newly remodeled east stadium. Sculptor Joe Putjenter also created the Tunnel Walk gates inside the stadium.[34] Before the construction of Memorial Stadium, Nebraska played its home games at Antelope Park and Nebraska Field. Gameday traditions Since 1993, Nebraska's home games have opened with the \"Tunnel Walk\" as the team takes the field before kickoff, typically to the Alan Parsons Project instrumental \"Sirius.\" The team first emerged from the southwest corner of the field and later, upon the completion of the Osborne Athletic Complex in 2006, from the northwest corner. When NU's home locker room was moved to the Osborne Legacy Complex in 2023, the team's entrance was moved to the northeast corner of the stadium. The Tunnel Walk is preceded by a \"Husker Power\" chant – half the stadium chants \"Husker\" in unison and the other half responds with \"Power.\"[35] Fans have released red helium balloons when Nebraska scores its first points at home games since the 1930s.[36] Global helium shortages and environmental concerns in recent years have threatened the tradition, which was paused in 2012 and 2022.[37][38] Walk-on program NU accepted its first walk-ons in the early 1960s and Tom Osborne began an official program in 1973 when the NCAA reduced the number of scholarships schools could offer.[39] Nebraska stocked its program with walk-ons from across the region throughout Osborne's and Frank Solich's tenures, and as a result the school's rosters were often unusually large – NU had 202 players on its 2002 Rose Bowl team, while opponent Miami had 107.[40] Osborne credited his walk-ons with providing flexibility to better scout future opponents and provided them the same access to training facilities and academic counseling as those with scholarships.[41] Though NU's expansive walk-on program is most frequently associated with Osborne, the school has typically maintained a larger-than-usual roster since his retirement as well.[40][42] Six former Nebraska walk-ons have become All-Americans and twenty-nine have played in the National Football League.[43] Helmets Nebraska's first helmet was red with a single white stripe, later changed to plain white with a black number on the side. From 1967 to 1969, the helmet featured a red, offset \"NU\" on each side. In 1970, this was changed to the now-familiar single \"N,\" although a few \"NU\" helmets remained as late as 1971. The change was necessitated due to a shortage of \"U\" stickers, and when the program claimed its first national championship, the single N remained.[44] Aside from a facemask swap from gray to red, the helmet design is unchanged since. Jerseys The Cornhuskers wore full shoulder stripes in the late 1960s and early 1970s, which were phased out as mesh and tearaway jerseys became popular. From 1980 to 1983, Nebraska's jerseys featured only a block \"N\" on the sleeves. Stripes and TV numbers were permanently re-added in 1984, although both have decreased in size as jersey sleeves have shortened.[45] A patch was added to the left shoulder to commemorate the hundredth season of Nebraska football in 1989; it remained for future seasons and was altered to read \"Nebraska Football: A Winning Tradition.\"[46] Player last names first appeared on jerseys for road games and bowl games in the late 1970s, but home jerseys remained nameless except for seniors playing their final home game. Last names were permanently affixed to all jerseys in 1988.[45] Nebraska's defense is often referred to as the \"Blackshirts,\" a reference to the black jerseys worn by starting defensive players during practice. The tradition originated in 1964 when Bob Devaney wanted a way to more quickly distinguish between his various units.[47] Depictions of the Blackshirts often include a skull and crossbones. Pants Nebraska traditionally wears white pants at home and red on the road, with rare exceptions. The team first donned red pants with red jerseys for its 1986 contest with Oklahoma; the combination was unofficially retired after a Nebraska loss.[48] Nebraska first wore all-white uniforms in the 1991 Florida Citrus Bowl and again for its first three road games in 1992; NU lost three of these games and \"surrender suits,\" as they became known, were not used again for a decade.[49] Nebraska wore white-on-white in Bill Callahan's final game as head coach, a 65–51 loss to Colorado in 2007, and again on four occasions in 2014.[50] From 1968 through 1994, Nebraska's pants had two stripes down each side. These were removed prior to the 1995 season and the pants remained stripe-less until 2001. In 2002, Nebraska featured large side panels on its jersey and pants, and wore all-white in every road game – the changes were unpopular among fans and most were reverted, which included the return of pant stripes.[45] Pant stripes were again removed during Scott Frost's tenure as head coach as a tribute to the style from his playing career, and returned following his departure.[51] Alternate uniforms The first documented instance of Nebraska wearing alternate uniforms came against South Dakota in 1920 – the Cornhuskers were forced into blue jerseys when the visiting Coyotes mistakenly brought their home reds to Lincoln.[52] The same situation arose three years later against Oklahoma in the first-ever game at Memorial Stadium.[52] Nebraska celebrated the stadium's hundredth anniversary in 2023, wearing blue-trimmed jerseys to commemorate the occasion.[53] Nebraska did not use a pre-planned alternate design until 2009, and has used one each season since 2012. Many of these were throwback or \"fauxback\" uniforms, worn to commemorate past events or championships: 2009 (the 300th consecutive sellout at Memorial Stadium),[54] 2017 (the twentieth anniversary of Nebraska's 1997 national championship),[55] 2018 (the hundredth anniversary of the end of World War I),[56] 2021 (the twentieth anniversary of the September 11 attacks),[57] 2022 (to honor Nebraska's 1983 team),[58] and 2023 (the hundredth anniversary of Memorial Stadium).[53] Nebraska and Wisconsin played the first \"Adidas Unrivaled\" game in 2012; both schools wore uniforms featuring block letters instead of front numbers.[59] NU wore black jerseys with white stencil font numbers against UCLA the following year.[60] Nebraska wore an all-red uniform featuring black metallic stripes on the jersey and pants in 2014, and used similar all-black and all-white designs the next two seasons.[61] Nebraska wore Blackshirt-themed alternate uniforms in 2019, featuring a black jersey with a Blackshirts logo on both sleeves.[62] Scott Frost suggested this iteration may become a permanent alternate design to be worn after Nebraska's defense plays particularly well.[63] Nebraska used the uniforms again in 2020, and unveiled a white version to be worn away from home, but has not used either since.[64] Adidas has been Nebraska's official shoe and uniform sponsor since 1996. In 2017, the school and sponsor signed an eleven-year, $128 million apparel deal.[65] The \"rivalry\" between Nebraska and Colorado, one-sided for much of its history, gained traction with Colorado's resurgence in the 1990s. The teams have met 71 times, with the series dating back to 1898, a 23–10 Nebraska win. The Cornhuskers lead the series 50–21–2. The \"rivalry\" began when Bill McCartney dictated that Nebraska would become Colorado's rival by writing their name in red on the schedule when he arrived in 1982.[66] A bison head named Mr. Chip was presented to the winning team throughout the 1950s, but this exchange ended when Colorado misplaced the trophy in 1961.[67] The teams have not played annually since both programs exited the Big 12 in 2011.[citation needed] The Iowa–Nebraska rivalry debuted in 1891, a 22–0 Iowa win. Since 2011, the game is held annually the Friday after Thanksgiving. Also, the game was named the Heroes Game, and the winner keeps the Heroes Trophy. The teams have met 54 times, with the Cornhuskers leading the series 30–22–3.[citation needed] Nebraska and Kansas share a natural border rivalry and maintained the longest non-interrupted rivalry in college football history at 105 years. The teams have met 117 times, with the series dating back to 1892, a 12–0 Kansas win. The Cornhuskers lead the series 91–23–3, which includes 36 consecutive victories from 1969 to 2004. Since Nebraska's move to the Big Ten in 2011, the series has been dormant. No future games are scheduled.[citation needed] Nebraska and Kansas State were conference rivals from 1913 to 2010. With only 135 miles separating the schools, they were the nearest cross-border rivals in the Big Eight and Big 12 conferences. The teams have met 95 times, with the series dating back to 1911, a 59–0 Nebraska win. Nebraska leads the series 78–15–2, which includes 29 consecutive victories from 1969 to 1997. Since Nebraska's move to the Big Ten in 2011, the series has been dormant. No future games are scheduled.[citation needed] The 1939 game was televised in Manhattan, Kansas, making it the second televised college football game. The 1992 contest was held in Tokyo as the Coca-Cola Classic. Nebraska's series with Miami is among the most significant \"bowl rivalries\" in college football. The teams have met twelve times, with the series dating back to 1951, a 19–7 Miami win. The series is tied, 6–6. No future game is yet scheduled.[citation needed] The rivalry's most notable game is the 1984 Orange Bowl. Top-ranked Nebraska scored with seconds remaining to make the game 31–30, but NU head coach Tom Osborne opted to try for a two-point conversion instead of an extra point, even though a tie would have given Nebraska the national championship. Miami won the game and its first national title.[68] The $5 Bits of Broken Chair Trophy has been awarded to the winner of the Minnesota–Nebraska game since 2014. The teams have met 61 times, dating back to 1900, a 20–12 Minnesota win. The Golden Gophers lead the series 35–25–2. Minnesota holds the trophy after defeating the Cornhuskers in 2023. The teams will meet next in 2025.[citation needed] The Victory Bell (also known as the Missouri–Nebraska Bell) has been awarded to the winner of the Missouri–Nebraska game since 1927. The teams have met 104 times, with the series dating back to 1892, a 1–0 NU win when Missouri forfeited to protest the presence of African-American George Flippin on Nebraska's roster.[69] The Cornhuskers lead the series 65–36–3. Nebraska holds the Victory Bell after defeating the Tigers in 2010. Since Nebraska's move to the Big Ten in 2011, the series has been dormant. No future games are scheduled.[citation needed] Nebraska and Oklahoma has long been considered one of the great college football rivalries. The teams have met 87 times dating back to 1912, a 13–9 Nebraska win. The Sooners lead the series 46–38–3. Since Nebraska's move to the Big Ten in 2011, the series was dormant until 2021 when Oklahoma beat Nebraska 23–16 in Norman. Future non-conference games are scheduled for 2029 and 2030. Notably, the 2021 game in Norman marked the 50th anniversary of Nebraska's 35–31 victory over Oklahoma in the \"Game of the Century\".[citation needed] Nebraska dominated the series until 1942, going 16–3–3 in the first twenty-two meetings. The Sooners then won sixteen consecutive games, the longest streak in the series. Nebraska's 1959 win both ended the Cornhuskers' drought against the Sooners and snapped Oklahoma's 74-game conference win streak. Nebraska won the \"Game of the Century\" in 1971, of which Dave Kindred of The Courier-Journal wrote, \"They can quit playing now, they have played the perfect game.\" Oklahoma won every matchup from 1972 to 1977, a streak that ended in 1978, when Nebraska upset No. 1 Oklahoma; less than two months later, OU won a rematch in the Orange Bowl. Nebraska controlled the 1990s, including a 69–7 win in 1997, the largest margin of victory in series history. When the Big 12 was formed in 1996, the schools no longer played annually, ending a stretch of 68 consecutive years they had met. The teams met for the last time as conference opponents in the 2010 Big 12 Championship Game, when Oklahoma defeated Nebraska 23–20. The two programs combined to win 74 of 89 Big Eight championships, 41 by Nebraska and 33 by Oklahoma. The teams played eighteen times when both were ranked in the AP Poll top ten, and nine times when both were in the top five. The Freedom Trophy has been awarded to the winner of the Nebraska–Wisconsin game since 2014. The teams have met eighteen times, with the series dating back to 1901, an 18–0 Wisconsin win. The Badgers lead the series 13–5. Nebraska holds the Freedom Trophy after defeating the Badgers in 2024. The teams play annually. Winners in bold.

Campbell Trophy AP Player of the Year Twenty-seven former Nebraska coaches and players have been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame.[70] Nebraska has retired the number of three players and the jersey of twenty-two others.[71] The first of these was Tom Novak, the only four-time first-team all-conference selection in NU history, whose No. 60 was permanently retired shortly after the end of his playing career in 1949.[e][72] Johnny Rodgers became the second player to have his number retired after winning the 1972 Heisman Trophy – though Rodgers allowed his No. 20 to be worn by his son Terry (and several others, most recently in 2008), the university considers it \"permanently retired.\"[73] Rich Glover's jersey was retired at the same time as Rodgers's, but his No. 79 remained in circulation. Over the next several decades Nebraska retired the jersey of each of its major award winners, typically during the offseason following the end of their collegiate career.[73] Bob Brown, the first All-American coached by Bob Devaney at NU, had his No. 64 permanently retired in 2004.[f][73] In 2017, the school recognized eight of its early College Football Hall of Fame inductees – including Guy Chamberlin, whose career predated the use of numbers on jerseys – by retiring their jerseys in a ceremony celebrating the 125th anniversary of the N Club, an organization of past letterwinners.[72] The name and number of each honoree is displayed at Memorial Stadium, directly below the North Stadium press box. Nebraska leads the nation in Academic All-America selections, both in football and across all sports. Nebraska boasts seventy CoSIDA First-Team and 108 overall Academic All-America selections, both tops in the nation. The list includes fifteen Huskers that have been named first team Academic All-Americans twice in their careers. The Huskers also lead the nation with a total of 330 Academic All-Americans across all sports.[74] Nebraska has four players that have been selected as a First Team Academic All-American by entities other than CoSIDA: Don Fricke (1960), Pat Clare (1960), Jim Osberg (1965), and Tony Jeter (1965). Nebraska has had 368 former players drafted into the National Football League, including thirty-four first-round picks, two players selected first overall (Sam Francis in 1937 and Irving Fryar in 1984), and one player selected with the last pick of the draft (Stan Hegener in 1971). Guy Chamberlin, Nebraska's first consensus All-American, signed with the Decautur Staleys (now the Chicago Bears) in 1920 and a year later, scored the game-winning touchdown in the controversial \"Staley Swindle\" game.[75] Chamberlin went on to win four more APFA/NFL championships as a player and coach and still has the highest winning percentage of any coach in NFL history (0.784, among coaches with at least fifty wins).[76] Former Nebraska I-back Roger Craig became the first player in NFL history to score three touchdowns in a Super Bowl in 1985. The following season, he became the first player with 1,000 rushing yards and 1,000 receiving yards in a single NFL season, and in 1988 he was named Offensive Player of the Year.[77] Craig and fullback Tom Rathman, another former Cornhusker, played five seasons together on a high-powered San Francisco 49ers offense, winning two more Super Bowls. Vince Ferragamo, Nebraska's quarterback in 1975 and 1976, started Super Bowl XIV for the Los Angeles Rams, the only former Cornhusker to start at quarterback in a Super Bowl.[78] Zac Taylor, another former Nebraska quarterback, was the head coach of the Cincinnati Bengals in Super Bowl LVI.[78] NU was represented by at least one player in each Super Bowl from 1993 until 2019, the longest active streak of any school at the time it was snapped.[g][79] Five former Nebraska players have been enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.[80] There are nineteen Huskers on NFL rosters, along with three coaches.[81] Players Coaches The Big Ten Conference added four new member schools prior to the 2024 season and disbanded the division system it had used in some form since 2011.[82] Nebraska annually faces one protected rivalry in this scheduling format, Iowa. The remaining eight conference games rotate amongst the remaining sixteen teams.[83]",

                "content": "The history of Nebraska Cornhuskers football covers the history of the University of Nebraska–Lincoln's football program from its inception in 1890 until the present day. Nebraska competes as part of the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision, representing the University of Nebraska–Lincoln in the Big Ten Conference. Nebraska has played its home games at Memorial Stadium since 1923 and sold out every game at the venue since 1962.[2] Nebraska is among the most storied programs in college football history and has the eighth-most all-time victories among FBS teams.[3] NU has won forty-six conference championships and five national championships (1970, 1971, 1994, 1995, and 1997), along with seven other national titles the school does not claim. Its 1971 and 1995 title-winning teams are considered among the best ever.[4][5] Nebraska's three Heisman Trophy winners – Johnny Rodgers, Mike Rozier, and Eric Crouch – join twenty-four other Cornhuskers in the College Football Hall of Fame.[6] The program's first extended period of success came just after the turn of the twentieth century. Between 1900 and 1916, Nebraska had five undefeated seasons and completed a stretch of thirty-four games without a loss, still a program record.[7] Despite a span of twenty-one conference championships in thirty-four seasons, the Cornhuskers did not experience major national success until Bob Devaney was hired in 1962. Devaney won two national championships and eight conference titles in eleven seasons as head coach, but perhaps his most lasting achievement was the hiring of Tom Osborne as offensive coordinator in 1969.[8] Osborne was named Devaney's successor in 1973 and over the next twenty-five years established himself as one of the best coaches in college football history with his trademark I-formation offense and revolutionary strength, conditioning, and nutrition programs.[9][10][11] Following Osborne's retirement in 1997, Nebraska cycled through five head coaches before hiring Matt Rhule in 2022.[12] Nebraska's football history unofficially began in 1889 when a group of civil engineering students chopped down enough trees to create a small field at the corner of 10th and R Streets.[13] A team was formally organized the following year as the \"Old Gold Knights\" under the direction of Dr. Langdon Frothingham, a newly hired veterinary pathologist from Harvard University. Frothingham was asked to oversee the program primarily because he was familiar with the rules of the game and had brought a football with him from the East Coast.[14] Nebraska's first game was a 10–0 Thanksgiving Day victory over the Omaha YMCA on November 27, 1890.[15] Frothingham broke his leg during a practice prior to the season's only other game, an 18–0 win over Doane that actually took place in February of 1891,[14] and returned to Massachusetts shortly thereafter.[16] Prior to NU's 1891 matchup with Iowa, the Hawkeyes sent Iowa College coach Theron Lyman to Lincoln to prepare Nebraska – which played the 1891 and 1892 seasons without a coach – for its game against the more experienced Hawkeyes. Nebraska credits Lyman as its head coach for the game, though he likely did not even attend Iowa's 22–0 win in Omaha.[17] In December of 1891, Nebraska, Iowa, Kansas, and Missouri formed the Western Interstate University Football Association, one of college football's first conferences.[18] Nebraska – now playing as the \"Bugeaters,\" but also referred to as the \"Rattlesnake Boys\" and \"Red Stockings\" – appointed attorney J. S. Williams its temporary coach in the middle of the 1892 season. Williams's only game was a 1–0 forfeit victory[a] over Missouri after the Tigers protested the presence of African-American George Flippin on Nebraska's roster.[20] The forfeiture resulted in Nebraska's first-ever win against a conference opponent. Flippin, who was NU's first black athlete and the fifth black athlete at a predominantly white university, joked later in life that \"I was so good I beat the University of Missouri all by myself.\"[21] University supporters soon became upset by the \"cheap-John plan of amateur coaches\"[18] and the school responded by hiring Frank Crawford as its first official head football coach in 1893.[22] Crawford, who was also the first full-time head coach at Michigan,[23] became a vocal critic of Flippin, his star player. Crawford vetoed the election of Flippin as team captain, stating \"it takes a man with brains to be a captain; all there is to Flippin is brute force.\"[24] After an upset victory over Iowa at the end of Crawford's first season, the first documented use of the term \"Cornhuskers\" appeared in a school newspaper headline (\"We Have Met The Cornhuskers And They Are Ours\"); in this instance, \"Cornhuskers\" was used to derogatorily refer to Iowa.[25][26] Crawford led NU to its first conference championship in 1894. Assistant Charles Thomas was named head coach when Crawford left for Texas and led the Bugeaters to a 6–3 record and second WIUFA championship.[22][27] Nebraska faced its first nine-game schedule during this season, which included a long-distance road trip to Butte, Montana.[18] NU was coached by a pair of future College Football Hall of Famers over the next three seasons – though both are better known for their tenures at other universities, Edward N. Robinson and Fielding H. Yost led Nebraska to a combined 19–7–1 record from 1896 to 1898.[28][29][17] Alonzo Edwin Branch took over the program in 1899, which was Nebraska's only losing season prior to World War I.[17] Though many were used unofficially, the University of Nebraska's football program did not have a nickname during its first decade. The term \"Cornhuskers\" had appeared previously but wasn't applied to Nebraska until 1899, when Nebraska State Journal (now the Lincoln Journal Star) writer Cy Sherman began using the moniker; the nickname caught on quickly and was officially adopted in 1900.[30][31] Nebraska hired former Princeton star Walter C. Booth the same year and he quickly turned Nebraska into a Midwest football power.[14] In Booth's debut season as head coach, the Cornhuskers held their first seven opponents scoreless before losing their season finale to Minnesota in the first-ever meeting between the teams. Booth's third team was the best in Nebraska's young football history. The Cornhuskers went 9–0 without allowing a point, outscoring their opponents 164–0.[32] The Cornhuskers' title hopes were dashed when Fielding Yost's 11–0 Michigan team was voted national champion following its season-ending 23–6 win over Minnesota (Nebraska defeated the Gophers 6–0). Nebraska applied to the Western Conference (now the Big Ten Conference) following the season, believing Michigan's membership elevated its title chances, but the application was denied on account of Lincoln's distance from other schools in the conference. Throughout Booth's tenure the Cornhuskers were led by halfback John Bender, who starred at NU for five seasons and retired as college football's all-time leader in points scored.[33] Bender captained NU to another undefeated season in 1903. Having won twenty-two consecutive games, most of them in dominant fashion, it was written that Booth could \"weep with Alexander the Great because there are no more teams to conquer,\" given Nebraska's difficulty finding competitive and willing opposition in the Midwest.[14] Nebraska's winning streak ended in 1904 when Colorado defeated the Cornhuskers 6–0; the twenty-four consecutive victories set a program record that stood until 1995.[b][14] Booth left Nebraska following the 1905 season over a contract dispute (his $2,000 annual salary was higher than any university faculty member) and returned with a newly earned law degree to the East Coast, where he lived the rest of his life away from football.[33] Months after Booth's departure and still without a head coach, Nebraska faced Doane in an exhibition so the team could familiarize itself with college football's significant offseason rule changes.[34] These changes were mandated by United States President Theodore Roosevelt and included the legalization of the forward pass, the banning of the flying wedge, the creation of a neutral zone, and an increase in yards required to gain a new set of downs from five to ten.[34] NU professor and chairman of the athletic board James T. Lees was a member of the committee that drafted the new rules, which were initially unpopular but eventually proved instrumental in improving safety in college football.[c][35] Nebraska hired former Michigan tackle and assistant coach William C. Cole in 1907, the same year it formed the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association (later the Big Six, Big Seven, and Big Eight) along with seven other Midwest universities, including the three from the WIUFA. NU's 16–6 win over Kansas in their lone conference game was enough to claim the first MVIAA title. During the third year of Cole's four-year tenure, the university opened Nebraska Field, its first venue designed to host football games.[36] The driving force behind the new stadium was Earl Eager, one of Nebraska's first graduate managers of athletics (a part-time precursor to the modern athletic director). Eager was a former halfback who played his entire collegiate career at Antelope Field, which had little permanent seating and he described as \"either as hard as pavement or a sea of mud.\"[36] Eager's cause was assisted by the university's expansion, which necessitated the construction of academic buildings on Antelope Field. Eager himself prepared much of the land for the new stadium at the northeast corner of North 10th Street and T Street.[36] Nebraska and Iowa tied 6–6 on October 23, 1909 in the first game at the new field. Cole resigned when the MVIAA passed legislation in 1910 requiring football coaches to be full-time faculty members, feeling he could not manage his farm in Missoula, Montana while living year-round in Lincoln.[37] NU beat Haskell 119–0 at Nebraska Field in his final game as head coach, still the largest margin of victory in program history.[38] Following Cole's departure, Nebraska hired Ewald O. Stiehm from Ripon College as the first full-time head coach in school history.[39] The twenty four-year-old Stiehm – nicknamed \"Jumbo\" because of his large feet, though he despised the term – was given an annual salary of $2,000 to serve as head football coach and director of athletics, the same as Booth's salary five years earlier but less than the $3,000 his predecessor had earned for a less-demanding role.[40][41] Stiehm's tenure began with a 117–0 victory over Kearney–Normal, the only game ever played between Nebraska and what is now Nebraska–Kearney. The fiery Stiehm was subject to such frequent outbursts that the school established a women's sitting section at Nebraska Field far from the home sideline.[42] Nebraska's 1911 season included high-profile meetings with Minnesota (a 21–3 Golden Gophers win) and Michigan (a 6–6 draw). Stiehm was particularly enamored with the Minnesota shift, a precursor to modern pre-snap motion, and had an assistant coach photograph and document the technique during the teams' 1912 meeting.[40] Stiehm implemented the shift the following week, the first game in what would become a school-record thirty-four game unbeaten stretch. This included a 7–0 victory over Minnesota in 1913 which prompted Golden Gophers coach Henry L. Williams to discontinue the annual series between the schools. Stiehm assembled smaller-than-usual rosters with players that relied on quickness and misdirection, a departure from Nebraska's reputation as an \"unusually rough\" program (it's unclear if this reputation was deserved).[43][41] His \"Stiehm Rollers\" lost just twice during his five-year tenure as head coach.[17] Prior to their 1913 meeting with the Cornhuskers in Lincoln, Kansas State head coach Guy Lowman threatened a boycott due to the presence of lineman Clinton Ross, a black player, on Nebraska's roster.[44] Though KSU had faced NU and Ross each of the previous two seasons without complaint, it joined the MVIAA prior to 1913, and Lowman claimed there was a gentlemen's agreement among schools in the conference that disallowed black athletes. Nebraska denied such an agreement existed and the game was played as scheduled. Ross was NU's last black player until 1952 despite Stiehm and university chancellor Samuel Avery outwardly voicing strong opinions favoring integration in collegiate athletics.[44] In 1914, Vic Halligan was named the first first-team All-American in Nebraska history;[d] Guy Chamberlin became NU's first consensus All-American a year later.[e][17] Chamberlin served in the United States Army during World War I and later joined the Canton Bulldogs of the young American Professional Football Association (now the National Football League). He won two NFL championships as a player and four more as a player/coach and was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1965.[46] Led by Chamberlin, Nebraska finished the 1915 season undefeated and won its sixth consecutive MVIAA title. Nebraska faced Notre Dame on October 23, the first meeting of what became an annual rivalry; Nebraska won 20–19, Notre Dame's only loss of the 1915 season.[47] The Cornhuskers were invited to play in the 1916 Rose Bowl Game against unofficial Western champion Washington State, just the second college football bowl game ever played.[41] University officials balked at the cost of sending its team to Pasadena and declined the offer.[40] Nebraska was retroactively awarded the 1915 national championship by multiple iterations of the Billingsley Report, an NCAA-designated official selector developed in the 1960s, but NU does not claim the championship. Stiehm had verbally agreed to remain at Nebraska until at least 1917, but given the successes of NU's entire athletic department (he also coached Nebraska's basketball team to three conference championships), asked the Athletic Board for a raise in 1916.[48][40] The board refused and even declined an offer from local businesses to help pay the additional salary, and Stiehm agreed to take over Indiana's athletic department at an annual salary of $4,500.[40] He later stated that even after receiving Indiana's lucrative offer, he would've stayed at Nebraska if it had met his initial request of $4,250 (what amounted to approximately a twenty-percent raise).[49] Stiehm's career record at NU was 35–2–3 and his .913 winning percentage is still the highest in school history.[50] He arrived in Bloomington to significant fanfare but his teams never reached the same heights they did at Nebraska. After seven years at Indiana, Stiehm died of stomach cancer at age thirty-seven.[40] Nebraska hired E. J. Stewart from Oregon Agricultural College (now Oregon State University) to replace Stiehm as head football and basketball coach. NU traveled to Portland, Oregon to face Stewart's former team during his first season in Lincoln, the furthest west the Cornhuskers had ever traveled for a game.[51] This game was partly a result of Stewart's desire to schedule more difficult opposition across all sports, which he viewed as the best way to \"add to Nebraska prestige around the United States.\"[52] He addressed this in an open letter in the 1917 Cornhusker student yearbook: \"the adoption of the policy of playing only the big institutions in football in the future is probably the most important step undertaken by the new athletic administration.\"[53] Three games after defeating Oregon Agricultural, Nebraska's lengthy unbeaten streak was ended in a 7–3 defeat to Kansas in Lincoln. Two weeks later, they faced new rival Notre Dame and assistant coach Knute Rockne, who served as Notre Dame's head coach for the game, the first of ten he would lead the Irish against the Cornhuskers. Stewart's vision for Nebraska took hold in 1917 as the Cornhuskers faced powerhouses Michigan and Syracuse as well as Notre Dame in their now-annual meeting. As the season progressed the college football landscape was disrupted as the United States entered World War I. Nebraska lost several players to the war throughout 1917 and Stewart himself departed following the season to assist the YMCA, which helped promote morale and provided services to prisoners of war.[54] With its roster and coaching staff depleted by the war and the Spanish flu pandemic, Nebraska turned to professor William G. Kline to lead the shortened 1918 season at Stewart's suggestion.[55][56] The university received word near the end of the year that star end Roscoe Rhodes, set to be a team captain in 1918 before he was drafted into the United States Army, was killed in action in France on October 28, 1918.[57] Stewart briefly returned to Lincoln after the war in an administrative capacity.[58] Though no longer head football coach, he ordered heather green jerseys for the team to wear in its upcoming 1919 season.[59] The university attempted to instead order its traditional scarlet and cream jerseys after Stewart left NU permanently, but the uniforms had already been manufactured.[59] The changes were reverted the following year. Nebraska played the 1919 and 1920 seasons independent of the MVIAA under head coach Henry Schulte. Schulte was considered an excellent developer of linemen, prompting Rockne to describe him as “the greatest line coach in the game.”[60] He was head coach for only two seasons but remained on staff as an assistant until 1927. Nebraska named the Schulte Field House, which served as the program’s primary practice and locker room facility from its completion in 1949 until 2004, in his honor.[61] Nebraska rejoined the MVIAA in 1921, the same year it hired Fred Dawson from Columbia as head coach. Dawson’s first season featured a November trip to Pittsburgh to face Pop Warner and Pitt. Nebraska’s 10–0 victory was broadcast on Pittsburgh radio station KDKA, making it the first Nebraska football game, and one of the first football games ever, broadcast live on radio (though Lincoln was out of signal range).[62] Nebraska held its first “Reds” vs. “Blues” spring games to finish spring practice under Dawson.[63] The Cornhuskers finished 7–1 in Dawson’s first season, falling only to Notre Dame in South Bend. NU repaid the favor the following seasons, beating the Irish in Lincoln in 1922 and 1923, the only two losses across four years for Notre Dame’s famed offensive backfield nicknamed the “Four Horsemen.”[64] Nebraska’s 14–6 victory in 1922 was the final game at Nebraska Field – with an estimated 16,000 fans it was also the highest-attended.[65] The series continued until 1925 when Notre Dame administrators canceled it, citing \"antagonistic, anti-Catholic behavior\" during their visits to Lincoln.[47] The University of Nebraska began exploring the possibility of constructing a larger steel-and-concrete stadium to replace Nebraska Field less than a decade after its completion. Nebraska Field, with wooden bleachers and limited seating, was often filled beyond capacity and the condition of the venue had become \"as inadequate as the old one was in 1907.\"[36] The departure of Jumbo Stiehm and U. S. entry into World War I delayed the project, but fundraising was restarted in earnest when college football exploded in popularity after the war.[66][67] The Nebraska Memorial Association initially planned a stadium, museum, and gymnasium complex to be dedicated in honor of Roscoe Rhodes – the project was soon scaled back to just a stadium due to fundraising difficulties and local pushback (a gymnasium, the NU Coliseum, was constructed three years later). A groundbreaking ceremony was held on April 23, 1923 when the fundraising target of $450,000 had been met.[67] The stadium was designed pro bono by local architects John Latenser Sr. and Ellery Davis. Construction on the 31,000-seat venue was completed in less than six months, in time for the 1923 season. Nebraska defeated Oklahoma 24–0 in the first game at Memorial Stadium on October 13, 1923.[f] Instead of naming the stadium for Rhodes, the dedication was expanded to include all Nebraskans who served in the American Civil War, the Spanish–American War, and World War I (later expanded to include World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War).[69] Nebraska hosted defending Big Ten co-champion Illinois and star Red Grange at Memorial Stadium to open the 1924 season – the Cornhuskers effectively contained Grange but the favored Illini won 9–6. Dawson, who had taken a leave of absence for health reasons the previous winter, retired as head coach following the 1924 season. Ernest Bearg, the top assistant to Illinois head coach Robert Zuppke, was named Dawson's successor; NU's athletic board believed Bearg's experience as a backfield coach with Grange meant he would work well with Henry Schulte, who was still on staff as a highly regarded line coach.[70] Nebraska defeated Illinois and Zuppke 14–0 in Champaign in Bearg's head coaching debut, the first home game of Grange's career in which he did not score.[71] Tackle Ed Weir was the star of this defensive display and after the season he became the first Cornhusker to twice be named a first-team All-American.[71] Weir, who Knute Rockne called \"the greatest tackle I ever saw,\" was a charter member of the College Football Hall of Fame in 1951.[72] Representatives from the ten MVIAA universities met in Lincoln in 1928 and agreed to a splintering of the conference – Iowa State, Kansas, Kansas State, Missouri, Nebraska, and Oklahoma retained the MVIAA name (though it became more commonly referred to as the Big Six) and Drake, Grinnell, Oklahoma A&M (now Oklahoma State), and Washington University formed the Missouri Valley Conference.[73] Nebraska won the inaugural Big Six title in dominating fashion, defeating its five conference opponents by a combined score of 108–6. However, Bearg was criticized by supporters for \"not using deception and strategy\" after disappointing late-season results against Pittsburgh (a 0–0 draw) and Army (a 13–3 loss), and tendered his resignation following the season.[74] Nebraska tried to hire Rockne away from Notre Dame, but ultimately settled on another future Hall of Fame head coach, Dana X. Bible.[75] Bible followed eleven highly successful years at Texas A&M with six Big Six titles in eight years at Nebraska.[76] His 1936 team was ranked No. 15 in the first AP Poll, and finished the year ninth.[76] Bible coached four All-Americans at Nebraska and nearly won the program's first national title (though it would have been a retroactive selection) in 1933.[77] Bible accepted a lucrative offer to coach Texas after the 1936 season, but assisted Nebraska in the search for his replacement, Biff Jones (1937–41, 28–14–4).[76][78] Running back Sam Francis became Nebraska's first No. 1 overall selection in the NFL Draft in 1937. Jones served in World War I and coached at Army for four years, before stints at LSU and Oklahoma.[79] He took NU to the program's first bowl game, a 21–13 loss to Stanford in the 1941 Rose Bowl.[17] The following year, Nebraska lost five consecutive games for the first time ever, and Jones was recalled to serve in World War II just days after the last game of the season.[79] Though Nebraska maintained Jones' position would still be available to him after the war,[80] he remained at West Point for years after and never coached college football again.[81] He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1954.[81] Nebraska's 25–9 victory over Kansas State in 1939 was broadcast locally in certain parts of the Manhattan area, making it the second televised college football game.[82][83] The landscape of college football changed drastically during World War II, as most able-bodied men were drawn into the war effort in some way.[84] While Nebraska was still able to field a team, something many other major programs could not do,[84] the Cornhuskers had four straight losing seasons after only three in the program's first fifty-one years.[17] The situation become so dire that athletic director George Clark (1945, 1948, 6–13–0), a veteran of both wars with an extensive coaching pedigree, had to step in to coach the 1948 season after retiring in 1945.[85][86] During these years, center Tom Novak became Nebraska's first four-time all-conference selection, and later was the first player in program history to have his number retired.[87] In 1950, Nebraska and new head coach Bill Glassford (1949–55, 50–40–4) played the school's first \"spring game\", a 13–13 draw between the varsity team and an alumni team.[88] Led by twenty-two touchdowns from All-American Bobby Reynolds, NU had its first winning season since 1940 and finished the season ranked seventeenth.[89] Glassford led the Cornhuskers during their first night game, a 19–7 loss to Miami in 1951,[90] and college football's first \"NCAA-regulated\" telecast, a 20–12 loss to Oregon in 1953.[91] The hard-nosed coach, who at one point had to overrule a player petition calling for his firing,[92] took Nebraska to its second bowl game, a 34–7 loss to Duke in the 1955 Orange Bowl.[93] Glassford resigned in 1955, but survived until 2014, when he died at 102 as the oldest-living professional football player.[94] After a 4–6–1 1956 season under Pete Elliott,[95] Nebraska hired twenty-nine year-old Bill Jennings (1957–61, 15–34–1) to lead the program. Jennings had no winning seasons in five years as head coach, but was responsible for Nebraska's upset victory over Oklahoma in 1959, which ended OU's seventy-four game conference winning streak.[96] He frequently found himself at odds with program supporters, at one point stating, \"There is an intense desire to do something good in this state, like elect a president or gain prominence in politics. But we can't feed the ego of the state of Nebraska with the football team.\"[97] Jennings' last season in 1961 would be Nebraska's last losing season until 2004.[17] New athletic director Tippy Dye did not renew Jennings' contract in 1962, and attempted to hire Michigan State head coach Duffy Daugherty.[98] Daugherty instead suggested former assistant Bob Devaney, and after a lengthy contract dispute with Wyoming, Nebraska hired Devaney (1962–72, 101–20–2).[98] Nebraska beat Miami for its first bowl win in 1962, the first of forty consecutive winning seasons for the Cornhuskers.[99] NU's November 3 loss to Missouri marked the beginning of Memorial Stadium's lengthy sellout streak.[100] In his second season, Devaney ended Nebraska's thirty-two year conference title drought and won the school's first Orange Bowl. Despite similar success over the following years, including a loss in the 1966 Orange Bowl that would have won Nebraska the national championship, a pair of 6–4 seasons in 1967 and 1968 caused some to call for change within the program.[101] Devaney responded by promoting thirty-one year-old assistant Tom Osborne to offensive coordinator. Osborne's later teams would become famous for their prolific use of the run-heavy I-form option,[102] but his first offenses relied on a balanced attack out of the I formation; Dave Humm's 2,259 passing yards in 1972 were a program record until 2004.[103] Nebraska started the 1969 season 2–2, but did not suffer another loss until 1972.[17] The program won its first national title in 1970, when bowl losses by Texas and Ohio State vaulted the Huskers to the top of the AP Poll.[104][105] NU again won the national title in 1971, becoming the first and only champion to beat the teams that finished No. 2, No. 3, and No. 4 in the AP Poll.[106] This included a 35–31 Thanksgiving Day defeat of No. 2 Oklahoma that caused Dan Jenkins of Sports Illustrated to suggest \"it was the greatest collegiate football battle ever\".[107] It was Nebraska's only game decided by fewer than twenty-four points, including a 38–6 win over Alabama the Orange Bowl.[108][17] Devaney planned to retire following the season, but was convinced to return for 1972 in the hopes of winning an unprecedented third consecutive national title.[109] Wingback Johnny Rodgers won the school's first Heisman Trophy and Nebraska beat Notre Dame to win the Orange Bowl for the third straight year, but a pair of losses effectively ended NU's title hope.[17] Devaney retired after the season and became Nebraska's athletic director, a position he would fill until 1993, and Osborne became head coach.[110] Devaney ended his coaching career with eight Big Eight championships and an 136–30–7 overall record, good for the 11th-highest winning percentage in major college football history.[111] His program produced eighteen All-Americans in his eleven years,[112] including Rodgers, 1971 Outland Trophy winner Larry Jacobson, and 1972 Outland and Lombardi Award winner Rich Glover.[113] The Bob Devaney Sports Center, completed in 1976, was named in his honor, and he was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1982. The school added a statue of Devaney outside the remodeled East Stadium at Memorial Stadium in 2013.[114] Devaney died of a heart attack in 1997 at age eighty-two.[115] Tom Osborne (1973–97, 255–49–3) took over for Devaney in 1973. Over the next twenty-five years, Osborne never lost more than three games in a season, secured thirteen conference titles, and only coached three games where the Cornhuskers were not in the AP Poll Top 25.[116] The first decade of Osborne's tenure was consistent, if not spectacular. NU lost either two or three games and finished ranked between seventh and twelfth every year from 1973 to 1981. After a disappointing 1976 season in which Nebraska started No. 1 but finished the regular season just 8–3–1, it was rumored Osborne may lose his job if he lost the Astro-Bluebonnet Bowl.[117] However, these rumors were never confirmed, and Nebraska defeated Texas Tech 27–24. Two years later, Osborne beat rival Oklahoma for the first time, but Nebraska lost a rematch to the Sooners in the 1979 Orange Bowl after an upset loss to Missouri cost NU a chance at the national title. Following the season, Osborne interviewed for Colorado's head coaching position, but ultimately declined the offer.[118] 1982 was Osborne's tenth season as head coach, and the first in which Nebraska lost just a single game. The Cornhuskers' only loss of the season came at Penn State in week three. On Penn State's game-winning drive, wide receiver Mike McCloskey was ruled in-bounds to convert a fourth down, despite replay clearly showing he was out-of-bounds;[119] with no replay review to overturn the call, Penn State won the game and went on to claim the national title.[120] Nebraska started the following season ranked No. 1, and won a rematch with Penn State 44–6 in the first Kickoff Classic.[121] The Cornhuskers finished the regular season undefeated and set a Division I record for points in a season.[122] The offense – led by option quarterback Turner Gill, Heisman Trophy winner Mike Rozier, and future No. 1 NFL Draft pick Irving Fryar – was termed \"The Scoring Explosion\".[123] In the Orange Bowl, Nebraska immediately fell behind Miami, trailing 17–0 at the end of the first quarter. Early in the second quarter, Osborne called for the fumblerooski, a trick play which had Gill \"fumble\" the snap by intentionally setting the ball on the ground, where it was picked up by All-American guard Dean Steinkuhler, who ran nineteen yards for a touchdown.[124] Nebraska mounted a furious comeback, scoring a touchdown to get within one point with just seconds remaining. However, Osborne elected to go for two and the win outright, despite a tie likely winning the national title for Nebraska, and the conversion pass fell incomplete.[125] Nebraska ended the 1980s with more wins than any other program, but failed to win a national championship from a major selector (though NU has five unclaimed titles from the decade).[126] Barry Switzer's departure from Oklahoma in 1988 left the program mired in sanctions [127] and gave Nebraska a clearer path to conference success, but did not help the Cornhuskers on the national stage; from 1987 to 1993, NU lost seven straight bowl games to ACC opponents. The last of these was the controversial 1993 national championship game,[128] in which a blown call at the goal line and a missed field goal cost Nebraska the title.[129] Osborne was so upset by this loss that he had the scoreboard at Memorial Stadium display the 18–16 final score for the entire offseason.[130] Nebraska's 1993 team was led by star quarterback Tommie Frazier. Frazier was the biggest recruit in Osborne's 1992 class, which has since been listed among the greatest recruiting classes in college football history.[131] Frazier, a Florida native, also represented a philosophical shift in recruiting for Osborne, who had historically been successful largely with Midwestern players and an unusually high number of walk-ons.[132] In the middle of the 1994 season, however, a leg injury to Frazier meant pro-style backup Brook Berringer had to step in and run Osborne's option-based offense; Berringer's kind demeanor and heroics over the rest of the regular season endeared him to fans.[133] While Frazier returned to start the national championship game, Berringer replaced him in the second quarter, and behind two Cory Schlesinger touchdowns, NU won Osborne his first outright national title as a head coach.[134] Nebraska's 1995 team is often listed as the greatest in college football history.[5] Behind Frazier, who finished second in Heisman Trophy voting, and I-back Lawrence Phillips, the Cornhuskers won every game by at least fourteen points and set a college football record by scoring 53.2 points per game.[135] Nebraska beat four teams that finished in the top ten, including a 62–24 Fiesta Bowl blowout victory over Florida and head coach Steve Spurrier to win the national championship.[136] Osborne's title teams in 1994 and 1995 join Devaney's 1970 and 1971 teams as the only undefeated back-to-back national champions since 1956.[137] Berringer was killed in a plane crash two days before the 1996 NFL draft, where he was projected to be a mid-round selection.[138] Over four thousand people attended his funeral service, and in 2006 a statue of Osborne and Berringer was erected at Memorial Stadium.[139] In 1996, the Big Eight merged with the Southwest to create the Big 12 Conference. Despite its similarity in name, the Big 12 was an entirely new conference and did not retain any of the Big Eight's history or records.[140] After a shutout loss at Arizona State in week two, Nebraska won ten straight games to make the first Big 12 Championship Game. However, the Cornhuskers missed out on a fourth straight national championship appearance when they were upset by Texas.[141] Nebraska started the 1997 season outside the top five, but a win at second-ranked Washington quickly vaulted the Cornhuskers up to No. 1.[142] A 45–38 overtime victory at Missouri in week nine kept the Huskers' title hopes alive, though it dropped NU to No. 3 in both polls. The comeback win was highlighted by the Flea Kicker, a last-second, game-tying touchdown that bounced off the foot of intended receiver Shevin Wiggins and directly into the hands of Matt Davison.[143] Nebraska returned to the conference championship game and beat Texas A&M 54–15 for its first Big 12 title.[144] Nebraska entered bowl season trailing Michigan in both polls, but a 42–17 victory over Peyton Manning and Tennessee in the Orange Bowl narrowly boosted NU to the top of the Coaches Poll.[145] On December 10, 1997, Osborne announced he would retire following the Orange Bowl, and longtime assistant Frank Solich would take over. NU's subsequent victory made him the only coach to retire following a national championship.[146] Nebraska posted a 60–3 record in the final five years of Osborne's tenure. His career record of 255–49–3 gives him the fourth-highest winning percentage in major college football history.[147] Osborne was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1999,[148] and has been recognized as one of the greatest coaches in college football history.[149][150] After his retirement from coaching, Osborne was elected to Congress and represented Nebraska's third district from 2001 to 2007. He returned to the University of Nebraska as athletic director in 2007, retiring in 2013.[151] The university finished construction on the Tom and Nancy Osborne Athletic Complex in 2006 and dedicated the field at Memorial Stadium in his honor.[152] Upon Osborne's retirement, the program was handed over to running backs coach Frank Solich (1998–2003, 58–18), who had played at Nebraska under Devaney. In his six seasons, Solich won the 1999 Big 12 title and took the Cornhuskers to the 2001 national championship game, a season in which quarterback Eric Crouch won the Heisman Trophy. The Cornuskers slipped to 7–7 in 2002, the first non-winning season for Nebraska in forty years. That season also saw the Huskers fall out of the AP Poll altogether after being ranked every week since October 11, 1981. The run of 348 consecutive weeks in the AP Poll is still the longest in college football history. Following the season, Solich made aggressive changes to his coaching staff. The approach appeared successful, as the Cornhuskers improved to 9–3 in 2003, but second-year athletic director Steve Pederson fired Solich after the season, justifying the move with the now-infamous claim that he would not \"let Nebraska gravitate into mediocrity\" or \"surrender the Big 12 to Oklahoma and Texas\".[153] First-year defensive coordinator Bo Pelini was appointed interim head coach and led the Cornhuskers to a 17–3 win over Michigan State in the Alamo Bowl. Solich was so upset with his alma mater and longtime employer that he did not return to Lincoln for over fifteen years.[154] Although Pelini interviewed for the position as permanent replacement, former Oakland Raiders coach Bill Callahan (2004–07, 27–22) was named Solich's successor following a forty-day, one-man coaching search conducted by Pederson.[155] Callahan's mandate to prevent Nebraska's decline was not immediately successful, as his NFL-style West Coast offense was criticized harshly by fans for its departure from Osborne's run-dominant option. Criticism did not die down when Nebraska went 5–6 in Callahan's first year, NU's first losing season since 1961.[156] Following moderate success in 2005 and 2006, 2007 saw the Huskers lose five consecutive games for the first time since 1958, including a record-setting 76–39 loss to Kansas.[157] Pederson was fired as athletic director in the middle of the five-game slide. Osborne, who had retired from Congress earlier in the year to make an unsuccessful bid for governor, was named interim athletic director. Callahan later met the same fate as Pederson, as he was fired by Osborne immediately after a season-ending 65–51 loss to Colorado.[158] Osborne was named full-time athletic director in December and hired Pelini (2008–14, 67–27) to return to Nebraska as the program's thirty-second head coach.[159] Pelini's first team tied for the Big 12 North division title with a 9–4 record, the best record among first-year FBS coaches. In 2009, Heisman finalist Ndamukong Suh helped Nebraska lead the country in scoring defense at 10.4 points per game, just two years after ranking among the nation's worst.[160] NU finished 10–4 and Pelini was given a raise and contract extension.[161] Following the 2010–11 academic year, the University of Nebraska announced it was ending its association with the Big 12 and joining the Big Ten Conference.[162] Pelini's four seasons coaching in the new conference resulted in only one conference title game appearance, a 70–31 loss to unranked Wisconsin in 2012. In 2014, following another season in which Nebraska performed poorly against high-quality opposition, athletic director Shawn Eichorst fired Pelini.[163] At the time of the firing, the university still owed Pelini $7.65 million.[164] Pelini left the program with a 67–27 record, winning either nine or ten games each season; NU lost three games under Pelini in his final season, the only year he did not lose exactly four games.[164] School officials cited Pelini's lackluster record in important games and a pattern of \"unprofessional behavior\" toward fans, players, and school employees as contributing factors to his dismissal.[165] Shortly after, Eichorst hired Mike Riley to lead the program, a move that was harshly criticized given Riley's lack of recent success at Oregon State.[166][167] The Cornhuskers ended 2014 under interim coach Barney Cotton, losing to USC in the Holiday Bowl and finishing 9–4, Nebraska's seventh consecutive four-loss season. In 2016, Riley (2015–17, 19–19) took Nebraska into the national top five for the first time since 2010, but a 4–8 2017 season was the program's worst in fifty-six years. Following a home loss to Northern Illinois, University of Nebraska chancellor Ronnie D. Green fired Eichorst and appointed former Husker Dave Rimington interim athletic director.[168] Bill Moos was hired as Eichorst's replacement in October and terminated Riley the day after the season ended.[169] On December 2, 2017, Moos hired alumnus Scott Frost from UCF, after Frost led the Knights to a 13–0 2017 season.[170] Frost began his Nebraska head coaching career just 9–15 through two seasons. In 2019, Nebraska announced construction of a 350,000-square foot, $155 million athletic complex adjacent to Memorial Stadium's northeast corner.[171] The following March, in the midst of a nationwide push to allow further student-athlete compensation, NU partnered with Opendorse to \"help student-athletes build their individual brands\", the first university to do so.[172] Nebraska finished 3–5 in 2020, a season shortened by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the following year finished just 3–9. Frost was fired following a 1–2 start to the 2022 season, his fifth as Nebraska's head coach.[173] At the time of Frost's departure, Nebraska's previous thirteen losses had come by nine points or fewer. Wide receivers coach Mickey Joseph was named Frost's interim replacement, making Joseph NU's first black head coach in any sport. Following the 2022 season, Nebraska announced the hiring of Matt Rhule to be the next head coach, after having served stints at Temple, Baylor and with the NFL's Carolina Panthers.",

As a child, she was enrolled in dancing classes to develop her physique, and she performed well enough to become a member of Les Grands Ballets Canadiens at 13, and was chosen as Miss Montreal at 18. As a model in the 1970s and 1980s, Haddon represented Max Factor, Revlon, Estée Lauder, and L'Oréal. She appeared on the cover of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue in 1973 (January 29)[3] and was twice named to Harper's Bazaar's \"Ten Most Beautiful Women.\" She also appeared nude in the April 1973 issue of Playboy. Haddon worked as an actress, appearing in the Disney movie The World's Greatest Athlete (1973) with Jan-Michael Vincent. She moved to Europe, continued modeling and acting, and appeared in a number of film roles in French and English,[5] as well as occasional small parts in American movies. Her best known roles were in Madame Claude (1977), and North Dallas Forty (1979) opposite actor Nick Nolte. Haddon was originally cast for the role of Dale Arden in the 1980 film version of Flash Gordon, but producer Dino De Laurentiis replaced her with Melody Anderson just before filming commenced.[6] During Haddon's tenure as a main face for L'Oréal, sales for the Age Perfect line had increased by 50%.[7] According to The New York Times, Dayle had \"shattered age taboos\" with her multiyear contracts with L'Oréal and Estée Lauder, among other companies.[8] Clairol selected her as a spokesperson, and she later broke barriers for women over the age of 35 when she became the global face of a new anti-aging line for Estée Lauder, a first in the beauty industry. On the day that her Estée Lauder contract expired, L'Oréal signed her. She then had her own company, Dayle Haddon Concepts Inc. In early 2008 she was named a UNICEF ambassador.[9] Haddon was also the founder of a non-profit called WomenOne. The organization's motto is \"changing the world one woman at a time.\"[10] Through WomenOne, Haddon had partnered with Free The Children, an international charity, to provide scholarships for girls’ education in Kenya. Through her organization, she had raised and donated more than $150,000 for one of Free The Children's all-girls secondary schools.[11] Haddon also appeared as the face of a line of socially and environmentally responsible accessories launched by Me to We, Free The Children's partner organization.[12] She was the mother of Ryan Haddon.[13] On December 27, 2024, first responders found her unresponsive in a carriage house in Solebury Township, Pennsylvania just outside New Hope.

                "content": "The UConn Huskies football team is a college football team that represents the University of Connecticut in the sport of American football. The team competes in NCAA Division I FBS as an independent. Connecticut first fielded a team in 1896, and participated in Division I-AA until 1999. The Huskies began their two-year Division I-A transition period in 2000, and became a full-fledged Division I-A team in 2002. From 2000 to 2003, the team played as an independent. The school's football team then joined the conference of its other sport teams, the Big East (later named the American Athletic Conference (AAC) in 2013), taking effect in 2004, through 2019. In 2019, the UConn football team left the American to again play as an independent, as the school's current primary conference, the current Big East, does not sponsor the sport. The Huskies are currently coached by Jim Mora.[2] The University of Connecticut began playing football in 1896 when the school was known as Storrs Agricultural College, and the team was known as the \"Aggies.\" It teamed up with Massachusetts Agricultural College and the Rhode Island College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts to form the Athletic League of New England State Colleges for the purpose of scheduling football matchups between the schools. The first year was spent playing against local high schools and YMCA clubs. The following year provided their first competition against future rivals Rhode Island, an opponent that would be played over 100 times, and Massachusetts. Other early rivals included the Ivy League and the \"Little Ivies\", particularly Yale University starting in 1948, who have played the Huskies for 50 years. Tragedy struck the team on September 27, 1919, when Gardner Dow died from injuries related to a flying tackle that he delivered in a game against New Hampshire.[3][4] The college would honor Dow by naming the athletic fields after him. These fields would become the home for most of the school's athletic teams for the next three decades. In 1924, the Aggies celebrated their first undefeated season when they finished with six wins, no losses and two ties. The defense was the strength of the team, as they allowed a meager thirteen points to be scored against them over the entire season, including a total of three points over the final seven games.[5] The team was proclaimed by The New York Times to be among the best in the country, and was led by the school's first All-America candidate in captain, Martin \"Red\" O'Neill.[6] The UConn Club memorializes O'Neill with a yearly award given to a former student-athlete who has had a successful professional career. Red O'Neill went on to become one of Connecticut's first players to play in the NFL. He played for the Hartford Blues in 1926, their only year in the NFL.[7] Another player is Art \"Pop\" Williams, winning a championship with the Providence Steam Roller in 1928 and also has the record for the most rushing career touchdowns in Providence's franchise history.[8] The Steam Roller are New England's first NFL champion. The renamed Huskies went on to become long-time members of the Yankee Conference, winning 15 conference championships. In 2012, Bill Belichick stated in an interview on WEEI that in 1983 he applied for the Huskies' head coaching position but was eventually turned down in favor of an internal hire, Tom Jackson. Connecticut hired Lew Perkins as its athletic director in 1990. One of Perkins' first projects was to gather facts for a possible upgrade of the football program to Division I-A.[9] Perkins feared that if the university did not upgrade the football program, that it ran the risk of falling behind other institutions that fielded both football and basketball teams at the highest level. However, UConn was in the middle of a budget deficit and many faculty feared that an upgrade of the football program would result in a loosening of academic standards.[9] Randy Edsall was named the 27th head football coach at the University of Connecticut on December 21, 1998, and led the Huskies from Division I-AA into Division I-A. UConn officially began the upgrade process in January 1999 by applying to join the Big East football conference.[10] They would receive a special waiver from the NCAA in order to play in Memorial Stadium while Rentschler Field was under construction.[11] UConn would become the first school to ever move from the FCS to the Bowl Championship Series as a member of the Big East after three years as an independent. The Huskies would spend the 2000 and 2001 as a transitional Division I-A program as they built their scholarship base to the maximum of 85. They recorded their first win over a Division I-A opponent on September 18, 1999, when they defeated Buffalo, 23-0. They would finish the 1999 season with a final record of 4-7, and the following 2000 season at 3-8. [12] The 2001 season brought their first win over a BCS rival with a victory over Rutgers on September 29, by a score of 20–19. The growing pains continued, as they finished the season at 2–9. The breakthrough came during the Huskies' first year as a full-fledged member of Division I-A in 2002. Led by sophomore quarterback Dan Orlovsky, they showed vast improvement over the previous two seasons, despite starting the season losing six of the first eight games. They closed Memorial Stadium in fashion by routing the last two opponents, Florida Atlantic and Kent State, by a combined score of 124–35. The 63 points scored against Kent State in the Memorial Stadium finale, was the most the Huskies ever scored in the 50 years of playing in the stadium. They concluded a successful season by defeating Navy, 38–0, and Iowa State, 37–20. The victory over Iowa State was the Huskies' first win over a bowl-bound team. Connecticut was originally scheduled to join the Big East as a football member in 2005. However, following the departure of Miami, Virginia Tech, the Huskies' entrance into the Big East was expedited by one year. Boston College would leave the Big East at the conclusion of the 2004 season.[13] The success continued in 2003, when Connecticut began play in Rentschler Field. They would finish the season with an overall record of 9–3. They opened the season with their first victory vs. a Big Ten team (34–10 over Indiana) and the final game of the season provided their first victory over an ACC opponent, when they defeated Wake Forest, 51–17. It was only the third time that a non-conference team had scored over 50 points in an ACC stadium. Despite the stellar record, the Huskies were not invited to play in a bowl game, largely due to their lack of conference affiliation. The Huskies played their first Big East conference game on September 17, 2004, when they dropped a 27–7 decision at Boston College. Their first Big East conference win came only 13 days later, when they defeated Pittsburgh 29–17. They completed their first season in the conference in 5th place with a record of 3–3. That year's overall record of 8–4 was enough to garner an invitation to the 2004 Motor City Bowl, the first bowl invitation in the school's history. The attendance of 52,552 was, at the time, a record crowd for the Bowl. The Huskies were hit hard by graduation and injuries in the 2005 and 2006 seasons. The program opened one of the best and newest college football facilities in 2006 with the completion of the $57.9 million (165,000 sq. ft.) Burton Family Football Complex & Mark R. Shenkman Training Center.[14] The 2007 season saw a quick turnaround with the Huskies' first ever Big East Conference football title, which they shared with West Virginia. For the first time UConn beat a ranked opponent at home, defeating South Florida 22–15. UConn participated in the Meineke Car Care Bowl losing to Wake Forest 24–10. That was followed up with consecutive 8–5 seasons in 2008 and 2009 with wins in both of their bowl games (over Buffalo and the SEC's South Carolina). The team was hit hard in 2009 by the on-campus murder of junior cornerback Jasper Howard, who was stabbed by a non-student outside a dance following their homecoming game win over Louisville. UConn struggled following his death, dropping their next three games and falling to 1–4 in-conference, but got a major win to break the streak at Notre Dame, a victory quoted by Coach Randy Edsall as being the program's \"Best Win\".[15] The game ball from that victory was sent to Howard's mother in Miami, one of many tributes throughout the year for the fallen player. The team honored Howard prior to every game through the 2010 season, which would have been his senior year. The 2010 season brought a second Big East Championship in four years and a trip to the 2011 Fiesta Bowl. After a loss in the Fiesta Bowl, to Oklahoma, Edsall did not fly home with or tell his players that he was leaving the UConn football program. He instead took a separate flight to Maryland to become their new head coach. It had also been noted in the media that Edsall's relationship with then-athletic director Jeff Hathaway had been strained for several years. Two weeks after Edsall left for Maryland and after nearly seven years away from college football, Connecticut native Paul Pasqualoni was hired away as defensive coordinator from the Dallas Cowboys to lead the UConn football program, by the soon to be dismissed AD Hathaway. The Big East's name changed in 2013 to the American Athletic Conference as a result of the non-FBS split that took place as part of the conference's three-way realignment between 2010 and 2013. Three members moved to the ACC as full members, Notre Dame went the ACC as a partial, Rutgers to the Big Ten and West Virginia to the Big 12. With the seven non-FBS basketball schools buying the Big East conference name for their own newly formed conference. Two teams departing to the ACC, Syracuse and Pittsburgh left the Big East with losing records against the Huskies in football.[citation needed] Following two seasons of mediocrity and a struggling offense, Pasqualoni was forced to replace his lifelong colleague George DeLeone as the offensive coordinator, just as he did prior to them both being fired at Syracuse. Pasqualoni named T. J. Weist as his OC for 2013. But Pasqualoni and Deleone (now his OL coach) were both fired after starting 0–4 with UConn's first loss as full D-I member to an FCS team, Towson 33–18 and following a humiliating defeat to Buffalo (41–12), which UConn had never lost to (8–0) as an FBS team. Weist was named the interim head coach and finished the season strong on a 3-game winning streak after starting out 0–5 and totally revamping the offense free of Pasqualoni's control. Though Weist was considered for the head coaching job, UConn AD Warde Manuel announced Notre Dame defensive coordinator and Broyles Award winner Bob Diaco as the new UConn head coach for the 2014 season. After a complete tear down of the program in 2014, which would lead to Diaco finishing the year with only around 60 scholarship players available and needing to use a dozen true freshman, the team finished 2–10. The 2015 season resulted in a revitalization for the program as they finished 6–6 and became bowl eligible for the first time since the 2010 season. On December 26, 2016, UConn announced that Diaco, who posted his 3rd straight losing year with a 3–9 record would be fired effective January 2, 2017. By not making the move immediately, the school saved $1.6 million in buyout expenses.[16] He was replaced by former coach Edsall, making his return to the program after six years.[17] Following a 3–9 third season with the Huskies, Diaco was terminated at the end of the 2016 season.[16] His replacement, Randy Edsall, returning to the program after six years, would not find similar success in his second go-around. In 2019, after several years of losing records with a $41 million sports created deficit, UConn made the choice to leave the AAC and rejoin the current edition of the Big East.[citation needed] This was seemingly a basketball move because the Big East does not have football.[citation needed] The path would be to play as an independent.[citation needed] The UConn football team left the American and became independent in August 2020 as a result of UConn's other sports rejoining the Big East, which does not sponsor football.[18] UConn cancelled their 2020 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Their first season competing independently was in 2021. After three straight losing campaigns and a season cancelled by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Edsall elected to retire after a 0–2 start in 2021.[19] To replace Edsall, UConn hired Jim L. Mora. In his first season with the team, Mora would lead the Huskies to a surprising 6–6 regular season record, highlighted by an upset victory over then-No. 19 Liberty. Bowl-eligible for the first time since 2015, UConn was selected to play in the 2022 Myrtle Beach Bowl against Marshall, in a rematch of their last bowl game.[20] In the 2024 season, UConn had an 8–4 record, their first winning season since 2010. They were invited to compete in the Fenway Bowl against North Carolina.[21] In 2010, Connecticut had 16 players named to the Big East All-Academic Football Team,[22] an honor which requires a cumulative Grade Point Average (GPA) of at least a 3.0 in a minimum of two semesters. And several times UConn was ranked as one of the top bowl teams in the country per the annual Graduation Gap Bowl report.[23][24] In 2015, the team was honored by AF Coaches Assoc. for academic achievement and the 990 single year APR score in 2014–15 under head coach Diaco was also the highest in school history. Connecticut has participated in seven bowl games, with the Huskies garnering a record of 3–4.[25] Connecticut has won 26 conference championships, 17 shared and 9 outright.[citation needed] † Co-champions The Huskies have won one division title, which they shared with UMass. † Co-champions The Yankee Conference rivalry dates back to 1897. The rivalry became dormant in 1999 as UConn moved up to the FBS and UMass remained at the FCS level. The rivalry would be revived in UMass's FBS debut, a 37–0 win for the Huskies. Since 2018, each school has won two of the four contests. The football rivalry dates back to 1897 and was centered around the Ramnapping Trophy after UConn students stole the URI mascot in 1934. The teams played nearly every year until the end of the Yankee Conference. Once UConn moved up to the FBS, the teams seldom play as Rhode Island remains an FCS program. Since 2000, there have been only three meetings: a UConn (52–7) win in 2006, a UConn (52–10) win in 2009, and a back-and-forth 56–49 UConn victory in 2018. Better known for their men's basketball rivalry, the football rivalry between UConn and bordering-state foe Syracuse dates back to 2004 and has been played 12 times.[26][27] The teams were members of the old Big East until Syracuse left in 2012 to join the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) in all sports.[28][29] Since becoming a non-conference matchup, the game has been played intermittently with the next meeting coming in 2024.[30] In 1997, the Big East Conference gave the University of Connecticut and Villanova University a December 31 deadline to decide if they were going to upgrade their respective football programs and join the Big East football conference.[31] Villanova, a private institution, declined the invitation. However, in October 1997, the University of Connecticut Board of Trustees overwhelmingly endorsed, by a vote of sixteen to one, the football team's plan to upgrade the program to Division I-A status.[32] Part of the plan would be to build a new stadium, as the current stadium, Memorial Stadium, fell well below the minimum occupancy level of 30,000, as set by the NCAA. Originally, the new stadium was to be built on campus. However, the enthusiasm toward the new stadium quickly faded as the estimated expenses rose, the idea of an on-campus stadium was tabled, and the upgrade of the program was put on hold by the Connecticut state legislature.[33] A year later, the stadium issue was rehashed during an attempt to bring the New England Patriots to Hartford, Connecticut. A proposed 70,000 seat, open-air stadium in downtown Hartford would also serve as the home of the Huskies football team.[34] The plans for this stadium also fell through and the Patriots announced that they would remain in Foxboro, Massachusetts. Eventually, a new site emerged across the Connecticut River in East Hartford, when Pratt & Whitney donated land on the old Rentschler Airfield to the state for purposes of building an off-campus football stadium which is 20 miles away from the main campus. The Huskies play their home football games at Pratt & Whitney Stadium at Rentschler Field in East Hartford, Connecticut, an off-campus facility located 20 miles (32 km) to the west of the main campus and only 3 miles east of the new Downtown Hartford-Uconn campus. The inaugural game took place on August 30, 2003, when Connecticut defeated the Indiana Hoosiers 34–10. Since the opening, Connecticut has enjoyed a decided home field advantage, posting a 68–59 record when playing at Rentschler. In 2007, the Huskies completed their home season winning each of their seven home games, becoming only the second Big East team to compile a 7–0 home record. The stadium played to an average of 97% near capacity crowds for eight years (2003–2010), prior to Paul Pasqualoni's arrival and during the Big East. The Huskies on-campus home is at the Burton Family Football Complex on Stadium Road in Storrs, Connecticut. It contains the coaches' offices, team meeting rooms, video facilities, dining hall and student-athlete lounge. Construction began in the fall of 2004 and it officially opened in July 2006. The building is named after Robert Burton, who in 2002 made a donation of $2.5 million to the University of Connecticut. The original location of the building was to be where Memorial Stadium stands.[35] However, it was later decided to construct the building across the street. Alongside the Burton Family Football Complex is the 85,000-square-foot (7,900 m2) Mark R. Shenkman Training Center. The indoor training center includes a full-length football field and an 18,000-square-foot (1,700 m2) strength and conditioning center.[36] The training center was made possible by a $2.5 million gift from Connecticut businessman and UConn alum Mark Shenkman.[37] Construction of the Mark R. Shenkman Training Center and the Burton Family Football Complex were handled in tandem by HOK Sport (now Populous) and JCJ Architecture. Upon completion in the summer of 2006, both buildings were granted a LEED silver designation. They are the first buildings on the University of Connecticut campus, and the first football facilities in the nation to be certified as a \"green building.\"[38] [39] [40][41] The Brian Kozlowski Award was first awarded in 1998. It honors the former UConn Husky and former New York Giants, Atlanta Falcons, and Washington Redskins tight end, Brian Kozlowski, who through hard work, effort and dedication has been able to have a lengthy NFL career.[48]: 86 Announced schedules as of August 26, 2024.[49]",

                "content": "Drake Lee Maye (born August 30, 2002) is an American professional football quarterback for the New England Patriots of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the North Carolina Tar Heels, where he was named the ACC Football Player of the Year in 2022 after leading the NCAA in total yards and setting single-season school records in passing yards and touchdowns. Maye was selected third overall by the Patriots in the 2024 NFL draft. Maye was born on August 30, 2002, in Huntersville, North Carolina.[1][2] He attended William A. Hough High School in Cornelius, North Carolina, and transferred after his freshman year to Myers Park High School in Charlotte, where he played football and basketball.[3] He has three brothers, who also played football—two of his brothers won national championships playing collegiate sports. Maye proved to have a competitive nature with them regarding sports.[4] As a junior in high school, he received All-Conference and All-District honors in basketball and was named The Charlotte Observer's 2019 male athlete of the year after throwing for a school-record 3,512 yards and 50 touchdowns en route to a conference championship appearance.[1][5][6] Maye was named a Under Armour All-American in 2020 despite being unable to play his senior season due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[1] Rated a four-star prospect, Maye committed to play college football for the Alabama Crimson Tide in July 2019 before flipping to North Carolina in March 2020.[7] As a redshirt in his freshman season for the North Carolina Tar Heels, Maye appeared in four games behind starter Sam Howell in 2021.[8] With Howell leaving for the NFL in 2022, Maye was named the starter prior to the season.[9] In the opening game against Florida A&M, Maye threw five touchdowns and became the first UNC quarterback to do so in his debut.[10] Maye would also record games with four or more total touchdowns against Appalachian State,[11] Notre Dame,[12] Virginia Tech,[13] Pittsburgh,[14] and Wake Forest.[15] He led the team to appearances in the 2022 ACC Championship Game and Holiday Bowl and was named the ACC Player of the Year after leading the NCAA in total offense with 5,019,[16] passing for school-records 4,321 yards and 38 touchdowns while rushing for 698 yards and 7 touchdowns.[17] In the 2023 season, Maye threw for over 400 yards against Syracuse,[18] Miami,[19] and Campbell.[20] Maye was named second-team All-ACC after passing for 3,608 yards and 24 touchdowns while rushing for 449 yards and nine touchdowns.[21] Maye declared for the 2024 NFL draft following the season.[22] He finished his career fifth in passing yards (8,018) and fourth in passing touchdowns (63) in UNC history.[23] Maye was selected by the New England Patriots as the third overall pick in the 2024 NFL draft.[26] He was the third of a record-tying six quarterbacks taken in the first round (tied with the 1983 draft).[27] Maye signed a four-year fully-guaranteed contract worth $36.64 million on May 28, 2024.[28] Maye was the second consecutive Patriots first round rookie quarterback to choose the number 10, following Mac Jones.[29] Despite a strong preseason, Maye was named a backup to veteran Jacoby Brissett to begin his rookie season.[30] Maye made his regular season debut in Week 3, entering in the fourth quarter of the Patriots' 24–3 road loss to the New York Jets. Maye finished the game, completing four of eight passes for 22 yards and rushing for 12 yards.[31] On October 8, 2024, after the Patriots fell to 1–4 and continued struggles from Brissett, Maye was named the starting quarterback.[32] In his first start against the Houston Texans, Maye completed 20 of 33 passes for 243 yards with 3 touchdowns and 2 interceptions in the 41–21 loss; he also led the team with 38 rushing yards.[33] Maye's three touchdowns were one more than Brissett had thrown in his five 2024 starts,[34] and Maye became the first quarterback since at least 1950 to throw three touchdown passes and lead his team in rushing in his first start.[35] In Week 8 against the Jets, Maye recorded a rushing touchdown before exiting the game in the second quarter with a head injury, later diagnosed as a concussion. The Patriots would go on to win 25–22.[36][37] Maye's first ten passing touchdowns went to ten different receivers, making him the first NFL quarterback to accomplish that feat since Steve Ramsey did so in 1973.[38] Maye is the youngest of four brothers: Luke and Beau played basketball at UNC, with the former landing a buzzer beater in the Elite Eight en route to winning the 2017 national championship.[39] Another brother, Cole, was a pitcher on the Florida Gators baseball team that won the 2017 College World Series.[1] Maye grew up family friends with quarterback Mason Rudolph, as their fathers played together at UNC.[40] Maye's father Mark played quarterback at North Carolina (UNC) in the 1980s prior to playing briefly with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Raleigh–Durham Skyhawks.[1] Maye is good friends with Sam Howell, who preceded him as starting quarterback at UNC.[41]",

                "title": "Drake Maye said English fans should root for Patriots",
                "content": "Awful Announcing A strange element of the NFL’s international games (which hit five this year, and look set to expand further) is how they lead to league players answering questions from international media. Sometimes that produces remarkable results. The latest case there comes from New England Patriots’ recently-anointed starting QB Drake Maye’s response to a press conference question from a British reporter on why fans there should root for his team ahead of their clash with the Jacksonville Jaguars at London’s Wembley Stadium Sunday: “Yeah I think it just starts with the name New England” — Drake Maye on why British people should cheer for a team named the Patriots pic.twitter.com/8E0G61NzTU — Chives (@jarrett_daveler) October 18, 2024 “First off, I think it comes with the team name, New England. I think it’s easy for UK fans to be attracted to that. Our colors are pretty sweet, they represent a lot of different things. And from there, I’m excited for the team, we’re going to come up, and we’ve got a lot of great seasons ahead. So shoutout to the fans that are already Patriots’ fans over here, and look forward to having some more.” It should very much be noted that “New England” was one of the most prominent regions in the 18th-century American Revolution against English rule. And the “Patriots” name directly pays homage to that. Indeed, the team history (dating back to a 1959 founding in the old AFL and the 1960 hiring of Lou Saban as their first head coach) is quite clear on their revolutionary connections, and on their “pretty sweet” colors’ connections to that movement. From a Wikipedia summary of the team history on its webpage: The most popular choice – and the one that [team owner Billy] Sullivan selected – was the “Boston Patriots,” with “Patriots” referring to the colonists of the Thirteen Colonies who rebelled against British control during the American Revolution and in July 1776 declared the United States of America an independent nation, which heavily involved the then-colony of Massachusetts. Immediately thereafter, artist Phil Bissell of The Boston Globe developed the “Pat Patriot” logo. So, yeah, “New England” is not a statement of connection with England, especially with many of the colonists there being early firebrands against Britain. And the team continues to embrace that history of rebellion against Britain, including with the “Militia” reenactors they often showcase. So somewhere, King George III is rolling in his grave after these comments from Maye. (While he’s not talking to trees.) Now, the Patriots playing in England is not Maye’s fault or their team’s fault. Rather, it’s a reflection of the NFL’s focus on growing international games. But still, Maye did not have to try to connect “New England” to “England.” And in doing so, he cast aspersions on his degree from UNC-Chapel Hill in the process. At least he studied “business administration, operations, and management” there, not history. [@Jarrett_Daveler on X] Andrew Bucholtz has been covering sports media for Awful Announcing since 2012.

                "title": "Jerod Mayo says Patriots building 'dynasty' in pitch to English fans",
                "content": "By Conor Roche For roughly two decades, the Patriots had an easy pitch for why football fans should root for their team. That winning pitch has certainly taken a hit in the last few years, though. So, ahead of the Patriots’ game against the Jaguars in London on Sunday, Jerod Mayo was asked why English fans should root for New England amid the team’s 1-5 start. Mayo pointed his answer to the future rather than the present, believing the team is on the right path to recapturing the championship years. “One thing I would say is that we’re hitting the reset button and looking forward to building something special,” Mayo responded. “Building the next dynasty, and it starts with, obviously, through the draft and developing, but also through free agency. We look to get back on top here pretty soon.” The Patriots began that “reset” process this past offseason, parting ways with longtime head coach Bill Belichick after 24 seasons. While Mayo was hired to replace Belichick as the head coach, executive Eliot Wolf was promoted to run the team’s football operations. New England also hit the reset button on the roster, drafting Drake Maye with the third overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft. Following his first NFL start last week, Maye was also posed with the question of why football fans in England should root for the Patriots. His response came off as a bit more humourous before briefly touching on the future of the team. “First off, I think it comes from the team name, New England. I think it’s easy for U.K. fans to be attracted to that,” Maye responded. “Our colors are pretty sweet. They represent a lot of different things. “From there, just kind of the excitement for the team. I think we’re on the come up, and we’ve got a lot of things to look forward to, a lot of bright futures ahead. Shout out to all the fans that are already Patriot fans over here and look forward to having some more.” Beyond Maye’s point about the connection between the Patriots and England, their six Super Bowl titles between 2001-18 certainly seemed to help them pick up fans nationally and internationally. The Patriots were the most followed team in the NFL on Instagram as of August. Additionally, New England is the fourth-most popular team in the United Kingdom, a study done by JD Sports found earlier in 2024. English fans have also gotten to see a couple of Patriots wins in their native land. The Patriots defeated the Buccaneers, 35-7, in London in 2009. In their return trip to London three years later, they took down the Rams, 45-7. Mayo was a part of both wins as a player, remembering the trips to London fondly. “We approached it like a business trip, but at the same time, it was good to get the victory,” Mayo said on the wins he got in London as a player. “I vividly remember after the game; we had a good time as a team. It’s another way for us to build camaraderie, to go out there together and get a victory, so it’s good.” This is also the second straight year that the Patriots are playing overseas, losing to the Colts in Frankfurt in 2023. Ahead of that game, Patriots owner Robert Kraft gave the team a speech that stressed the importance of that game in Germany. When asked if Kraft has given or will give a similar speech this year, Mayo said the team already knows what it needs to do. “It’s always a message, and I would say just as a fan of the game, I think it’s outstanding to grow the popularity of the sport,” Mayo said. “Obviously, it’s the most watched sport in our states, and we’re trying to do the same in other countries, so it is important.” Get breaking news and analysis delivered to your inbox during football season. ©2024 Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC Stay up to date with everything Boston.

McConkey attended North Murray High School in Chatsworth, Georgia.[1][2] He made the varsity team as a freshman. McConkey played quarterback, running back, defensive back, and punter and was also a return specialist.[3] In his senior year, he led North Murray to a 9–1 record and the school's first ever region championship.[4] McConkey finished the year with 36 total touchdowns and 3,051 total yards, being named the offensive player of the year for the region.[5] McConkey was a three-star recruit and committed to the University of Georgia, his only Power Five offer, on February 2, 2020.[6][7] His jersey number, 15, was retired by North Murray in 2023.[8] McConkey redshirted and was initially a member of Georgia's scout team.[9] In McConkey's redshirt freshman year, he caught five touchdowns with 28 receptions for 430 yards.[10] His first career touchdown came against Vanderbilt. McConkey also rushed for one touchdown. He was named the SEC Freshman of the Week after the 34-10 win over Auburn, where he received 135 yards and scored one touchdown.[11] McConkey played in all of Georgia's games making seven starts.[12] McConkey scored two touchdowns, one receiving, and one rushing, against Oregon in the 2022 season opener.[13] Against Kent State, McConkey recorded a career high six receptions.[14] He scored a touchdown against Florida before tallying a season-high 94 yards against #1 Tennessee.[15][16] The following week against Mississippi State, McConkey would rush for a 70-yard touchdown while also adding a 17-yard receiving touchdown.[17] He left the SEC Championship Game against LSU on December 3, 2022, due to knee tendinitis.[18] In the 2023 College Football Playoff National Championship Game, McConkey recorded five receptions for 88 yards and two touchdowns in a 65–7 victory.[19] Following the game, he announced that he would return to Georgia for the 2023 season.[20][21] The following season, McConkey missed significant time due to injuries.[22][23] He finished the regular season with 29 receptions for 456 yards and two touchdowns, and he was named the recipient of the Wuerffel Trophy.[24][25] On January 1, 2024, McConkey declared for the 2024 NFL draft.[26][27] McConkey graduated from Georgia in 2023 with a degree in finance.[28] McConkey was selected by the Los Angeles Chargers 34th overall with the pick acquired from a trade with New England Patriots.[32] On June 19, 2024, McConkey signed his four-year rookie contract with the Chargers worth $9.9 million guaranteed, with a $4 million signing bonus.[33] In his NFL debut, he scored a receiving touchdown in a 22–10 victory over the Las Vegas Raiders in Week 1.[34] A middle child, McConkey grew up a fan of the Tennessee Volunteers.[16][35] His father, Benji McConkey, was a star quarterback in high school at Dalton High,[36] while his brother, Hinton McConkey, played quarterback for the University of West Georgia in Division II in 2018.[37] McConkey writes \"1-20-16\" on his towel before games to honor his grandfather Vic McConkey, who died on that date.[38]",

He has previously played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Milwaukee Brewers and Baltimore Orioles. The Brewers selected Burnes in the fourth round of the 2016 MLB draft, and he made his MLB debut in 2018. Burnes is a four-time All-Star. He won the National League Cy Young Award in 2021, when he led the National League (NL) in earned run average. He led the NL in strikeouts in 2022. Burnes attended Centennial High School in Bakersfield, California. In 2013, his senior year, he had a 9–4 win–loss record with a 2.23 earned run average (ERA) in 22 appearances.[1] After high school, he enrolled and played college baseball at Saint Mary's College of California.[2][3] In 2015, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Orleans Firebirds of the Cape Cod Baseball League.[4] In 2016, his junior year, he posted a 9–2 record with a 2.48 ERA in 16 starts. After the season, he was drafted by the Milwaukee Brewers in the fourth round of the 2016 Major League Baseball draft.[5] Burnes made his professional debut with the Arizona League Brewers and was later promoted to the Wisconsin Timber Rattlers.[6] In 35+2⁄3 innings pitched between Arizona and Wisconsin, Burnes posted a 3–0 record with a 2.02 ERA. He started the 2017 season with the Carolina Mudcats and was later promoted to the Biloxi Shuckers after recording a 1.05 ERA after ten starts.[7][8] Burnes finished 2017 with a combined 8–3 record and 1.67 ERA between both teams.[9] The Brewers named him their minor league pitcher of the year after the season.[10] MLB.com ranked Burnes as Milwaukee's second-best prospect going into the 2018 season.[11] He began the season with the Colorado Springs Sky Sox.[12] The Brewers promoted Burnes to the majors for the first time on July 8, 2018.[13] He made his major league debut on July 10, pitching two scoreless innings, striking out one, and recording his first major league save.[14] In the 2018 NLDS against the Colorado Rockies, he pitched four scoreless innings in relief across two appearances, earning the win in the clinching 6–0 Game 3 victory. In the 2018 NLCS, Burnes got the last six outs of their game six win against the Dodgers.[citation needed] To start 2019, Burnes began the year in the starting rotation. However, he struggled in that role, allowing 11 home runs across his first 3 starts. It was announced he would move back to the bullpen. He continued to struggle in the bullpen, compiling a 9.00 ERA through 26 appearances. He was placed on the injured list on July 15 with shoulder discomfort. He finished the season with a 1–5 record and an 8.82 ERA in 49 innings. In the shortened 2020 season, Burnes pitched to a 4–1 record and recorded an ERA of 2.11 while striking out 88 batters in 59+2⁄3 innings. He finished 6th in the NL Cy Young voting.[15] Burnes struck out 40 batters without issuing a walk in his first four starts of 2021, an unprecedented four game stretch for an MLB starting pitcher.[16] On May 13, Burnes set the MLB record for the most strikeouts to begin a season before issuing a walk, with 58, surpassing the previous record of 51, held by Kenley Jansen.[17] Burnes was named to the 2021 MLB All-Star Game.[18] On August 12, Burnes tied an MLB record after striking out 10 consecutive batters in a game against the Chicago Cubs.[19] On September 11, Burnes pitched the first eight innings of a combined no-hitter with Josh Hader against the Cleveland Indians, in which he struck out 14 batters. He held a perfect game until a seventh-inning walk to Myles Straw.[20] Burnes finished the 2021 season with an 11–5 record and led the major leagues in ERA (2.43), strikeouts per nine innings (12.6), home runs per nine innings (0.4), and strikeout-to-walk ratio (6.88).[21] He won the National League Cy Young Award, becoming the third Brewers pitcher to win the award.[22] He was also named to the first 2021 All-MLB Team as a starting pitcher.[23] Burnes was selected as the starter for Game 1 of the 2021 NLDS against the Atlanta Braves. Burnes pitched six shutout innings, striking out six. He was not credited with the win, however, as he battled in a tight pitchers' duel with Atlanta's Charlie Morton. Milwaukee won the game, 2–1.[citation needed] On March 22, 2022, Burnes signed a $6.5 million contract with the Brewers, avoiding salary arbitration.[24] The Brewers named Burnes their Opening Day starting pitcher.[25] He was named to the 2022 MLB All-Star Game.[26] In 2022, Burnes was 12–8 with a 2.94 ERA in 202 innings, and struck out a league-high 243 batters.[27] On defense, he had a .961 fielding percentage.[27] He was a finalist for the NL Gold Glove Award at pitcher, but it was won for the third straight season by Max Fried.[28] Burnes went to salary arbitration with the Brewers, with the arbiter choosing the $10.01 million salary requested by the Brewers, rather than the $10.75 million requested by Burnes. He said that the process \"definitely hurt\" his relationship with the franchise.[29] Burnes started for the Brewers on Opening Day.[30] In 32 starts for Milwaukee, he posted a 10–8 record and 3.39 ERA with 200 strikeouts, and was named an All–Star for the third straight season.[31] On February 1, 2024, the Brewers traded Burnes to the Baltimore Orioles in exchange for DL Hall, Joey Ortiz, and a compensatory draft pick.[32] He made 32 appearances - all starts - for the Orioles in 2024, pitching to a 2.92 ERA and a 15-9 record with 181 strikeouts across 194.1 innings pitched.[33] Burnes also made his fourth consecutive All-Star team.[34] After the 2024 season, Burnes became a free agent.[35] The Orioles extended the qualifying offer of $21.05 million for the 2025 season to Burnes, but he declined.[36] Burnes is a power pitcher who has thrown six different pitches: a four-seam fastball between 94–97 miles per hour (151–156 km/h), a sinker between 95–97 miles per hour (153–156 km/h), a changeup between 88–91 miles per hour (142–146 km/h), a slider between 86–89 miles per hour (138–143 km/h), a curveball between 80–83 miles per hour (129–134 km/h), and a cut fastball between 93–96 miles per hour (150–154 km/h). He virtually abandoned his four-seamer after 2020 after finding far more success exclusively using his cutter.[37] During spring training of 2024, Burnes broke out a second curveball, which he throws about 5 miles per hour (8.0 km/h) faster than his first, in strikeout situations.[38] Burnes is the son of Rick and Kandi Burnes.[39] Burnes and his wife Brooke married in 2020.[40][41] They have three children.[42][43]",

                "content": "Editions: En/mlb/arizona-diamondbacks Nobody expected this to happen in Arizona This came as a surprise to everyone involved, even the rest of the baseball fans. In a significant offseason move, the Arizona Diamondbacks have reportedly agreed to a six-year, $210 million contract with right-handed pitcher Corbin Burnes. The deal, which includes an opt-out clause after 2026, represents the largest contract in franchise history and underscores the Diamondbacks' commitment to bolstering their pitching staff for the 2025 season and beyond and competing in the National League. Burnes, who shined during his time with the Baltimore Orioles in the 2024 season, has been a standout performer since becoming a full-time starter in 2020. Known for his exceptional command and strikeout ability, The pitcher has compiled a 2.94 ERA and averaged 214 strikeouts per year over the past four seasons. His impressive track record includes winning the National League Cy Young Award in 2021 and playing a pivotal role in leading the Orioles back to the playoffs last season. The Diamondbacks, who made it to the World Series in 2023, are aiming to build on their recent success and compete with the powerhouse Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West. Adding Burnes to a rotation that already features Zac Gallen, Merrill Kelly, Eduardo Rodriguez, and Brandon Pfaadt makes the Diamondbacks' starting rotation one of the best in baseball. Burnes' agent, the renowned Scott Boras, negotiated the deal, which is part of a flurry of offseason contracts totaling over $1.6 billion. The Diamondbacks' decision to invest heavily in Burnes reflects their commitment to constructing a formidable team capable of contending for championships. As the 2025 season approaches, all eyes will be on Burnes and the Diamondbacks. Fans are eagerly anticipating the impact that Burnes will have on the team's success and their pursuit of another deep playoff run. With this new contract, Burnes is set to become a cornerstone of the franchise, and his presence in the rotation is expected to elevate the team's performance to new heights. © Unidad Editorial Información Deportiva, S.L.U.

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. The Arizona Diamondbacks have landed the best starting pitcher on the free-agent market. The D-backs and righty Corbin Burnes have agreed to a six-year contract worth $210 million, reports the New York Post. According to Heyman, Burnes' contract with Arizona includes an opt-out after the 2026 season. Burnes, 30, joined the Baltimore Orioles in a three-player trade with the Milwaukee Brewers last offseason. He had a terrific season with the O's, throwing 194 ⅓ innings with a 2.92 ERA and 181 strikeouts. That earned him a fifth-place finish in the AL Cy Young voting. Burnes allowed one run in eight innings in his only start this postseason. Our R.J. Anderson ranked Burnes the second-best free agent available this offseason, behind only Juan Soto. Here's his write-up: At first blush, Burnes is clearly this free-agent class' best and most reliable starting pitcher. He's earned four consecutive trips to the All-Star Game; he's among the league leaders in innings pitched since the pandemic; and he's proved that his game works both inside the American League and outside of Milwaukee, as if there was any doubt. Yet if you look closely enough at his profile, you'll notice some hints of potential decline. For starters, Burnes' strikeout rate deteriorated for a fourth year in a row, dipping beneath a batter per inning for the first time in his career. His trademark cutter, the primary pitch in his bag, returned its worst results (highest average and lowest whiff rate) until some late-season tinkering helped get it back on course. His in-zone contact rate, meanwhile, put him in the same neighborhood occupied by Kyle Gibson, Chris Flexen, and Carson Fulmer, among others. Mind you, none of the above prevented Burnes from notching another high-quality season. His command remains superb, enabling him to control quality of contact the way few others can. Burnes himself has explained away his strikeout rate by saying he was prioritizing early outs. Maybe so, but we suspect teams will think a little longer and a little harder than they expected to before handing him a long-term deal. As noted, Burnes has seen his strikeout rate gradually slip since becoming a full-time member of the rotation in 2021. He struck out 35.6% of the batters he faced in 2021, a top-of-the-line number for a starter. That dipped to 30.5% in 2022, 25.5% in 2023, and an almost perfectly league average 23.1% in 2024. Burnes remains excellent, but that is a noticeable decline. Burnes won the NL Cy Young Award as a member of the Brewers in 2021, and he's now finished in the top 10 of the Cy Young balloting for five straight years. Burnes enters the 2025 season with a career ERA+ of 129 and a career WAR of 17.1 across parts of seven major-league seasons. With Arizona, Burnes joins a potentially strong rotation that also includes Zac Gallen, Eduardo Rodriguez, Merrill Kelly and Brandon Pfaadt. The Diamondbacks, who won the National League pennant in 2023, are coming off a 2024 season in which they went 89-73 and just missed securing a wild-card spot in the postseason. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive.

                "content": "Snoop Dogg has his own college football bowl game. The Snoop Dogg? Yes. Seriously? Also yes. In what will be a first-of-a-kind bowl game, the American rapper will serve as the leading sponsor in Saturday's Snoop Dogg Arizona Bowl at 2:30 p.m. MT between Colorado State and Miami (OH) at Arizona Stadium in Tuscon, Arizona. REQUIRED READING:Colorado State football bowl history: Rams' all-time bowl scores, results The Snoop Dogg Arizona Bowl is the latest big sports event that the American treasure, rapper and celebrity has been part of, as he served as a correspondent for NBC and Peacock at the 2024 Paris Olympics. Saturday's meeting between Colorado State and Miami (OH) is the third all-time meeting between both programs, and the first since 2010 when the Redhawks defeated the Rams 31-10. It is also the first bowl game appearance for Colorado State since 2017. The Rams will not just look for their ninth win on the season — which would be their most since 2014 — but also their first bowl game win since 2013. Here's what you need to know about why Snoop Dogg has his own college football bowl game this season: LIVE UPDATES:Colorado State vs Miami (Ohio) live score, highlights, how to watch Arizona Bowl Like other college football bowl games, Snoop Dogg signed a partnership agreement with the Arizona Bowl to be the bowl game title and presenting sponsor. The rapper announced the multi-year sponsorship deal partnership between the Arizona Bowl and himself on Monday, May 6 on X (formerly Twitter). Snoop Dogg's sponsorship allows his alcoholic beverage with Dr. Dre — Gin & Juice by Dre and Snoop — to be the presenting sponsor of the bowl game. Before Snoop Dogg partnered with the Arizona Bowl, the bowl itself was sponsored by Barstool Sports. The Snoop Dogg Arizona Bowl, as it is referred to, is the first alcohol product to serve as the presenting sponsor of an NCAA-sanctioned bowl game. \"College football fans are exhausted by the talk around NIL, conference realignment, coach movement, transfer portal and super conferences. So it is time we get back to the roots of college football, when it was focused on the colleges, the players, the competition, the community, the fan experience and the pageantry,\" Snoop Dogg said in a video on X (formerly Twitter) on May 6. \"Being a fan, coach, supporter of all levels of the game. ... It's only fitting that I step up and help this thing right. I'm ready to bring the juice back to college football.\" REQUIRED READING:Why Snoop Dogg is making history with college football bowl game sponsorship As noted in a press release by the Arizona Bowl, as part of the partnership agreement, Snoop Dogg will also \"promote the new line of premium Gin & Juice By Dre and Snoop flavors\" at Saturday's game. Gin & Juice By Dre and Snoop launched in February of this year, with the company's name and first ready-to-drink product paying homage to a Snoop Dogg's hit from the album \"Doggystyle\" that was produced by Dr. Dre and Death Row Records. \"We’re thrilled about our groundbreaking partnership with Snoop and Gin & Juice By Dre and Snoop,” Executive director of the Arizona Bowl Kym Adair said in a statement. \"This year, the Arizona Bowl is bringing sports, libations, and entertainment into a singular bowl game, and we are changing the definition of what a brand partnership is in the NCAA.” Colorado State and Miami (OH) will compete in the 2024 Snoop Dogg Arizona Bowl. The Snoop Dogg Arizona Bowl has conference ties with the Mountain West and the Mid-American Conference (MAC) The Snoop Dogg Arizona Bowl will take place at Arizona Stadium, the home of the University of Arizona, in Tucson, Arizona. The Snoop Dogg Arizona Bowl between Colorado State and Miami (OH) will start at 2:30 p.m. MT on Saturday, Dec. 28.",

                "content": "The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a massive, nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, heated to incandescence by nuclear fusion reactions in its core, radiating the energy from its surface mainly as visible light and infrared radiation with 10% at ultraviolet energies. It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. The Sun has been an object of veneration in many cultures. It has been a central subject for astronomical research since antiquity. The Sun orbits the Galactic Center at a distance of 24,000 to 28,000 light-years. From Earth, it is 1 astronomical unit (1.496×108 km) or about 8 light-minutes away. Its diameter is about 1,391,400 km (864,600 mi), 109 times that of Earth. Its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, making up about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. Roughly three-quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron. The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star (G2V), informally called a yellow dwarf, though its light is actually white. It formed approximately 4.6 billion[a] years ago from the gravitational collapse of matter within a region of a large molecular cloud. Most of this matter gathered in the center, whereas the rest flattened into an orbiting disk that became the Solar System. The central mass became so hot and dense that it eventually initiated nuclear fusion in its core. Every second, the Sun's core fuses about 600 billion kilograms (kg) of hydrogen into helium and converts 4 billion kg of matter into energy. About 4 to 7 billion years from now, when hydrogen fusion in the Sun's core diminishes to the point where the Sun is no longer in hydrostatic equilibrium, its core will undergo a marked increase in density and temperature which will cause its outer layers to expand, eventually transforming the Sun into a red giant. This process will make the Sun large enough to render Earth uninhabitable approximately five billion years from the present. After the red giant phase, models suggest the Sun will shed its outer layers and become a dense type of cooling star (a white dwarf), and no longer produce energy by fusion, but will still glow and give off heat from its previous fusion for perhaps trillions of years. After that, it is theorized to become a super dense black dwarf, giving off negligible energy. The English word sun developed from Old English sunne. Cognates appear in other Germanic languages, including West Frisian sinne, Dutch zon, Low German Sünn, Standard German Sonne, Bavarian Sunna, Old Norse sunna, and Gothic sunnō. All these words stem from Proto-Germanic *sunnōn.[17][18] This is ultimately related to the word for sun in other branches of the Indo-European language family, though in most cases a nominative stem with an l is found, rather than the genitive stem in n, as for example in Latin sōl, ancient Greek ἥλιος (hēlios), Welsh haul and Czech slunce, as well as (with *l > r) Sanskrit स्वर् (svár) and Persian خور (xvar). Indeed, the l-stem survived in Proto-Germanic as well, as *sōwelan, which gave rise to Gothic sauil (alongside sunnō) and Old Norse prosaic sól (alongside poetic sunna), and through it the words for sun in the modern Scandinavian languages: Swedish and Danish sol, Icelandic sól, etc.[18] The principal adjectives for the Sun in English are sunny for sunlight and, in technical contexts, solar (/ˈsoʊlər/),[3] from Latin sol.[19] From the Greek helios comes the rare adjective heliac (/ˈhiːliæk/).[20] In English, the Greek and Latin words occur in poetry as personifications of the Sun, Helios (/ˈhiːliəs/) and Sol (/ˈsɒl/),[2][1] while in science fiction Sol may be used to distinguish the Sun from other stars. The term sol with a lowercase s is used by planetary astronomers for the duration of a solar day on another planet such as Mars.[21] The astronomical symbol for the Sun is a circle with a center dot, .[22] It is used for such units as M☉ (Solar mass), R☉ (Solar radius) and L☉ (Solar luminosity).[23][24] The scientific study of the Sun is called heliology.[25] The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star that makes up about 99.86% of the mass of the Solar System.[26] It has an absolute magnitude of +4.83, estimated to be brighter than about 85% of the stars in the Milky Way, most of which are red dwarfs.[27][28] It is more massive than 95% of the stars within 7 pc (23 ly).[29] The Sun is a Population I, or heavy-element-rich,[b] star.[30] Its formation approximately 4.6 billion years ago may have been triggered by shockwaves from one or more nearby supernovae.[31][32] This is suggested by a high abundance of heavy elements in the Solar System, such as gold and uranium, relative to the abundances of these elements in so-called Population II, heavy-element-poor, stars. The heavy elements could most plausibly have been produced by endothermic nuclear reactions during a supernova, or by transmutation through neutron absorption within a massive second-generation star.[30] The Sun is by far the brightest object in the Earth's sky, with an apparent magnitude of −26.74.[33][34] This is about 13 billion times brighter than the next brightest star, Sirius, which has an apparent magnitude of −1.46.[35] One astronomical unit (about 150 million kilometres; 93 million miles) is defined as the mean distance between the centres of the Sun and the Earth. The instantaneous distance varies by about ± 2.5 million km or 1.55 million miles as Earth moves from perihelion on ~ January 3 to aphelion on ~ July 4th.[36] At its average distance, light travels from the Sun's horizon to Earth's horizon in about 8 minutes and 20 seconds,[37] while light from the closest points of the Sun and Earth takes about two seconds less. The energy of this sunlight supports almost all life[c] on Earth by photosynthesis,[38] and drives Earth's climate and weather.[39] The Sun does not have a definite boundary, but its density decreases exponentially with increasing height above the photosphere.[40] For the purpose of measurement, the Sun's radius is considered to be the distance from its center to the edge of the photosphere, the apparent visible surface of the Sun.[41] By this measure, the Sun is a near-perfect sphere with an oblateness estimated at 9 millionths,[42][43][44] which means that its polar diameter differs from its equatorial diameter by only 10 kilometers (6.2 mi).[45] The tidal effect of the planets is weak and does not significantly affect the shape of the Sun.[46] The Sun rotates faster at its equator than at its poles. This differential rotation is caused by convective motion due to heat transport and the Coriolis force due to the Sun's rotation. In a frame of reference defined by the stars, the rotational period is approximately 25.6 days at the equator and 33.5 days at the poles. Viewed from Earth as it orbits the Sun, the apparent rotational period of the Sun at its equator is about 28 days.[47] Viewed from a vantage point above its north pole, the Sun rotates counterclockwise around its axis of spin.[d][48] A survey of solar analogs suggest the early Sun was rotating up to ten times faster than it does today. This would have made the surface much more active, with greater X-ray and UV emission. Sun spots would have covered 5–30% of the surface.[49] The rotation rate was gradually slowed by magnetic braking, as the Sun's magnetic field interacted with the outflowing solar wind.[50] A vestige of this rapid primordial rotation still survives at the Sun's core, which has been found to be rotating at a rate of once per week; four times the mean surface rotation rate.[51][52] The Sun consists mainly of the elements hydrogen and helium. At this time in the Sun's life, they account for 74.9% and 23.8%, respectively, of the mass of the Sun in the photosphere.[53] All heavier elements, called metals in astronomy, account for less than 2% of the mass, with oxygen (roughly 1% of the Sun's mass), carbon (0.3%), neon (0.2%), and iron (0.2%) being the most abundant.[54] The Sun's original chemical composition was inherited from the interstellar medium out of which it formed. Originally it would have been about 71.1% hydrogen, 27.4% helium, and 1.5% heavier elements.[53] The hydrogen and most of the helium in the Sun would have been produced by Big Bang nucleosynthesis in the first 20 minutes of the universe, and the heavier elements were produced by previous generations of stars before the Sun was formed, and spread into the interstellar medium during the final stages of stellar life and by events such as supernovae.[55] Since the Sun formed, the main fusion process has involved fusing hydrogen into helium. Over the past 4.6 billion years, the amount of helium and its location within the Sun has gradually changed. The proportion of helium within the core has increased from about 24% to about 60% due to fusion, and some of the helium and heavy elements have settled from the photosphere toward the center of the Sun because of gravity. The proportions of heavier elements are unchanged. Heat is transferred outward from the Sun's core by radiation rather than by convection (see Radiative zone below), so the fusion products are not lifted outward by heat; they remain in the core,[56] and gradually an inner core of helium has begun to form that cannot be fused because presently the Sun's core is not hot or dense enough to fuse helium. In the current photosphere, the helium fraction is reduced, and the metallicity is only 84% of what it was in the protostellar phase (before nuclear fusion in the core started). In the future, helium will continue to accumulate in the core, and in about 5 billion years this gradual build-up will eventually cause the Sun to exit the main sequence and become a red giant.[57] The chemical composition of the photosphere is normally considered representative of the composition of the primordial Solar System.[58] Typically, the solar heavy-element abundances described above are measured both by using spectroscopy of the Sun's photosphere and by measuring abundances in meteorites that have never been heated to melting temperatures. These meteorites are thought to retain the composition of the protostellar Sun and are thus not affected by the settling of heavy elements. The two methods generally agree well.[59] The core of the Sun extends from the center to about 20–25% of the solar radius.[60] It has a density of up to 150 g/cm3[61][62] (about 150 times the density of water) and a temperature of close to 15.7 million kelvin (K).[62] By contrast, the Sun's surface temperature is about 5800 K. Recent analysis of SOHO mission data favors the idea that the core is rotating faster than the radiative zone outside it.[60] Through most of the Sun's life, energy has been produced by nuclear fusion in the core region through the proton–proton chain; this process converts hydrogen into helium.[63] Currently, 0.8% of the energy generated in the Sun comes from another sequence of fusion reactions called the CNO cycle; the proportion coming from the CNO cycle is expected to increase as the Sun becomes older and more luminous.[64][65] The core is the only region of the Sun that produces an appreciable amount of thermal energy through fusion; 99% of the Sun's power is generated in the innermost 24% of its radius, and almost no fusion occurs beyond 30% of the radius. The rest of the Sun is heated by this energy as it is transferred outward through many successive layers, finally to the solar photosphere where it escapes into space through radiation (photons) or advection (massive particles).[66][67] The proton–proton chain occurs around 9.2×1037 times each second in the core, converting about 3.7×1038 protons into alpha particles (helium nuclei) every second (out of a total of ~8.9×1056 free protons in the Sun), or about 6.2×1011 kg/s. However, each proton (on average) takes around 9 billion years to fuse with another using the PP chain.[66] Fusing four free protons (hydrogen nuclei) into a single alpha particle (helium nucleus) releases around 0.7% of the fused mass as energy,[68] so the Sun releases energy at the mass–energy conversion rate of 4.26 billion kg/s (which requires 600 billion kg of hydrogen[69]), for 384.6 yottawatts (3.846×1026 W),[5] or 9.192×1010 megatons of TNT per second. The large power output of the Sun is mainly due to the huge size and density of its core (compared to Earth and objects on Earth), with only a fairly small amount of power being generated per cubic metre. Theoretical models of the Sun's interior indicate a maximum power density, or energy production, of approximately 276.5 watts per cubic metre at the center of the core,[70] which, according to Karl Kruszelnicki, is about the same power density inside a compost pile.[71] The fusion rate in the core is in a self-correcting equilibrium: a slightly higher rate of fusion would cause the core to heat up more and expand slightly against the weight of the outer layers, reducing the density and hence the fusion rate and correcting the perturbation; and a slightly lower rate would cause the core to cool and shrink slightly, increasing the density and increasing the fusion rate and again reverting it to its present rate.[72][73] The radiative zone is the thickest layer of the Sun, at 0.45 solar radii. From the core out to about 0.7 solar radii, thermal radiation is the primary means of energy transfer.[74] The temperature drops from approximately 7 million to 2 million kelvins with increasing distance from the core.[62] This temperature gradient is less than the value of the adiabatic lapse rate and hence cannot drive convection, which explains why the transfer of energy through this zone is by radiation instead of thermal convection.[62] Ions of hydrogen and helium emit photons, which travel only a brief distance before being reabsorbed by other ions.[74] The density drops a hundredfold (from 20,000 kg/m3 to 200 kg/m3) between 0.25 solar radii and 0.7 radii, the top of the radiative zone.[74] The radiative zone and the convective zone are separated by a transition layer, the tachocline. This is a region where the sharp regime change between the uniform rotation of the radiative zone and the differential rotation of the convection zone results in a large shear between the two—a condition where successive horizontal layers slide past one another.[75] Presently, it is hypothesized that a magnetic dynamo, or solar dynamo, within this layer generates the Sun's magnetic field.[62] The Sun's convection zone extends from 0.7 solar radii (500,000 km) to near the surface. In this layer, the solar plasma is not dense or hot enough to transfer the heat energy of the interior outward via radiation. Instead, the density of the plasma is low enough to allow convective currents to develop and move the Sun's energy outward towards its surface. Material heated at the tachocline picks up heat and expands, thereby reducing its density and allowing it to rise. As a result, an orderly motion of the mass develops into thermal cells that carry most of the heat outward to the Sun's photosphere above. Once the material diffusively and radiatively cools just beneath the photospheric surface, its density increases, and it sinks to the base of the convection zone, where it again picks up heat from the top of the radiative zone and the convective cycle continues. At the photosphere, the temperature has dropped 350-fold to 5,700 K (9,800 °F) and the density to only 0.2 g/m3 (about 1/10,000 the density of air at sea level, and 1 millionth that of the inner layer of the convective zone).[62] The thermal columns of the convection zone form an imprint on the surface of the Sun giving it a granular appearance called the solar granulation at the smallest scale and supergranulation at larger scales. Turbulent convection in this outer part of the solar interior sustains \"small-scale\" dynamo action over the near-surface volume of the Sun.[62] The Sun's thermal columns are Bénard cells and take the shape of roughly hexagonal prisms.[76] The visible surface of the Sun, the photosphere, is the layer below which the Sun becomes opaque to visible light.[77] Photons produced in this layer escape the Sun through the transparent solar atmosphere above it and become solar radiation, sunlight. The change in opacity is due to the decreasing amount of H− ions, which absorb visible light easily.[77] Conversely, the visible light perceived is produced as electrons react with hydrogen atoms to produce H− ions.[78][79] The photosphere is tens to hundreds of kilometers thick, and is slightly less opaque than air on Earth. Because the upper part of the photosphere is cooler than the lower part, an image of the Sun appears brighter in the center than on the edge or limb of the solar disk, in a phenomenon known as limb darkening.[77] The spectrum of sunlight has approximately the spectrum of a black-body radiating at 5,772 K (9,930 °F),[12] interspersed with atomic absorption lines from the tenuous layers above the photosphere. The photosphere has a particle density of ~1023 m−3 (about 0.37% of the particle number per volume of Earth's atmosphere at sea level). The photosphere is not fully ionized—the extent of ionization is about 3%, leaving almost all of the hydrogen in atomic form.[80] The Sun's atmosphere is composed of five layers: the photosphere, the chromosphere, the transition region, the corona, and the heliosphere. The coolest layer of the Sun is a temperature minimum region extending to about 500 km above the photosphere, and has a temperature of about 4,100 K.[77] This part of the Sun is cool enough to allow for the existence of simple molecules such as carbon monoxide and water.[81] The chromosphere, transition region, and corona are much hotter than the surface of the Sun.[77] The reason is not well understood, but evidence suggests that Alfvén waves may have enough energy to heat the corona.[82] Above the temperature minimum layer is a layer about 2,000 km thick, dominated by a spectrum of emission and absorption lines.[77] It is called the chromosphere from the Greek root chroma, meaning color, because the chromosphere is visible as a colored flash at the beginning and end of total solar eclipses.[74] The temperature of the chromosphere increases gradually with altitude, ranging up to around 20,000 K near the top.[77] In the upper part of the chromosphere helium becomes partially ionized.[83] Above the chromosphere, in a thin (about 200 km) transition region, the temperature rises rapidly from around 20,000 K in the upper chromosphere to coronal temperatures closer to 1,000,000 K.[84] The temperature increase is facilitated by the full ionization of helium in the transition region, which significantly reduces radiative cooling of the plasma.[83] The transition region does not occur at a well-defined altitude, but forms a kind of nimbus around chromospheric features such as spicules and filaments, and is in constant, chaotic motion.[74] The transition region is not easily visible from Earth's surface, but is readily observable from space by instruments sensitive to extreme ultraviolet.[85] The corona is the next layer of the Sun. The low corona, near the surface of the Sun, has a particle density around 1015 m−3 to 1016 m−3.[83][e] The average temperature of the corona and solar wind is about 1,000,000–2,000,000 K; however, in the hottest regions it is 8,000,000–20,000,000 K.[84] Although no complete theory yet exists to account for the temperature of the corona, at least some of its heat is known to be from magnetic reconnection.[84][86] The corona is the extended atmosphere of the Sun, which has a volume much larger than the volume enclosed by the Sun's photosphere. A flow of plasma outward from the Sun into interplanetary space is the solar wind.[86] The heliosphere, the tenuous outermost atmosphere of the Sun, is filled with solar wind plasma and is defined to begin at the distance where the flow of the solar wind becomes superalfvénic—that is, where the flow becomes faster than the speed of Alfvén waves,[87] at approximately 20 solar radii (0.1 AU). Turbulence and dynamic forces in the heliosphere cannot affect the shape of the solar corona within, because the information can only travel at the speed of Alfvén waves. The solar wind travels outward continuously through the heliosphere,[88][89] forming the solar magnetic field into a spiral shape,[86] until it impacts the heliopause more than 50 AU from the Sun. In December 2004, the Voyager 1 probe passed through a shock front that is thought to be part of the heliopause.[90] In late 2012, Voyager 1 recorded a marked increase in cosmic ray collisions and a sharp drop in lower energy particles from the solar wind, which suggested that the probe had passed through the heliopause and entered the interstellar medium,[91] and indeed did so on August 25, 2012, at approximately 122 astronomical units (18 Tm) from the Sun.[92] The heliosphere has a heliotail which stretches out behind it due to the Sun's peculiar motion through the galaxy.[93] On April 28, 2021, NASA's Parker Solar Probe encountered the specific magnetic and particle conditions at 18.8 solar radii that indicated that it penetrated the Alfvén surface, the boundary separating the corona from the solar wind, defined as where the coronal plasma's Alfvén speed and the large-scale solar wind speed are equal.[94][95] During the flyby, Parker Solar Probe passed into and out of the corona several times. This proved the predictions that the Alfvén critical surface is not shaped like a smooth ball, but has spikes and valleys that wrinkle its surface.[94] The Sun emits light across the visible spectrum, so its color is white, with a CIE color-space index near (0.3, 0.3), when viewed from space or when the Sun is high in the sky. The Solar radiance per wavelength peaks in the green portion of the spectrum when viewed from space.[96][97] When the Sun is very low in the sky, atmospheric scattering renders the Sun yellow, red, orange, or magenta, and in rare occasions even green or blue. Some cultures mentally picture the Sun as yellow and some even red; the cultural reasons for this are debated.[98] The Sun is classed as a G2 star,[66] meaning it is a G-type star, with 2 indicating its surface temperature is in the second range of the G class. The solar constant is the amount of power that the Sun deposits per unit area that is directly exposed to sunlight. The solar constant is equal to approximately 1,368 W/m2 (watts per square meter) at a distance of one astronomical unit (AU) from the Sun (that is, at or near Earth's orbit).[99] Sunlight on the surface of Earth is attenuated by Earth's atmosphere, so that less power arrives at the surface (closer to 1,000 W/m2) in clear conditions when the Sun is near the zenith.[100] Sunlight at the top of Earth's atmosphere is composed (by total energy) of about 50% infrared light, 40% visible light, and 10% ultraviolet light.[101] The atmosphere filters out over 70% of solar ultraviolet, especially at the shorter wavelengths.[102] Solar ultraviolet radiation ionizes Earth's dayside upper atmosphere, creating the electrically conducting ionosphere.[103] Ultraviolet light from the Sun has antiseptic properties and can be used to sanitize tools and water. This radiation causes sunburn, and has other biological effects such as the production of vitamin D and sun tanning. It is the main cause of skin cancer. Ultraviolet light is strongly attenuated by Earth's ozone layer, so that the amount of UV varies greatly with latitude and has been partially responsible for many biological adaptations, including variations in human skin color.[104] High-energy gamma ray photons initially released with fusion reactions in the core are almost immediately absorbed by the solar plasma of the radiative zone, usually after traveling only a few millimeters. Re-emission happens in a random direction and usually at slightly lower energy. With this sequence of emissions and absorptions, it takes a long time for radiation to reach the Sun's surface. Estimates of the photon travel time range between 10,000 and 170,000 years.[105] In contrast, it takes only 2.3 seconds for neutrinos, which account for about 2% of the total energy production of the Sun, to reach the surface. Because energy transport in the Sun is a process that involves photons in thermodynamic equilibrium with matter, the time scale of energy transport in the Sun is longer, on the order of 30,000,000 years. This is the time it would take the Sun to return to a stable state if the rate of energy generation in its core were suddenly changed.[106] Electron neutrinos are released by fusion reactions in the core, but, unlike photons, they rarely interact with matter, so almost all are able to escape the Sun immediately. However, measurements of the number of these neutrinos produced in the Sun are lower than theories predict by a factor of 3. In 2001, the discovery of neutrino oscillation resolved the discrepancy: the Sun emits the number of electron neutrinos predicted by the theory, but neutrino detectors were missing 2⁄3 of them because the neutrinos had changed flavor by the time they were detected.[107] The Sun has a stellar magnetic field that varies across its surface. Its polar field is 1–2 gauss (0.0001–0.0002 T), whereas the field is typically 3,000 gauss (0.3 T) in features on the Sun called sunspots and 10–100 gauss (0.001–0.01 T) in solar prominences.[5] The magnetic field varies in time and location. The quasi-periodic 11-year solar cycle is the most prominent variation in which the number and size of sunspots waxes and wanes.[108][109][110] The solar magnetic field extends well beyond the Sun itself. The electrically conducting solar wind plasma carries the Sun's magnetic field into space, forming what is called the interplanetary magnetic field.[86] In an approximation known as ideal magnetohydrodynamics, plasma particles only move along magnetic field lines. As a result, the outward-flowing solar wind stretches the interplanetary magnetic field outward, forcing it into a roughly radial structure. For a simple dipolar solar magnetic field, with opposite hemispherical polarities on either side of the solar magnetic equator, a thin current sheet is formed in the solar wind. At great distances, the rotation of the Sun twists the dipolar magnetic field and corresponding current sheet into an Archimedean spiral structure called the Parker spiral.[86] Sunspots are visible as dark patches on the Sun's photosphere and correspond to concentrations of magnetic field where convective transport of heat is inhibited from the solar interior to the surface. As a result, sunspots are slightly cooler than the surrounding photosphere, so they appear dark. At a typical solar minimum, few sunspots are visible, and occasionally none can be seen at all. Those that do appear are at high solar latitudes. As the solar cycle progresses toward its maximum, sunspots tend to form closer to the solar equator, a phenomenon known as Spörer's law. The largest sunspots can be tens of thousands of kilometers across.[111] An 11-year sunspot cycle is half of a 22-year Babcock–Leighton dynamo cycle, which corresponds to an oscillatory exchange of energy between toroidal and poloidal solar magnetic fields. At solar-cycle maximum, the external poloidal dipolar magnetic field is near its dynamo-cycle minimum strength; but an internal toroidal quadrupolar field, generated through differential rotation within the tachocline, is near its maximum strength. At this point in the dynamo cycle, buoyant upwelling within the convective zone forces emergence of the toroidal magnetic field through the photosphere, giving rise to pairs of sunspots, roughly aligned east–west and having footprints with opposite magnetic polarities. The magnetic polarity of sunspot pairs alternates every solar cycle, a phenomenon described by Hale's law.[112][113] During the solar cycle's declining phase, energy shifts from the internal toroidal magnetic field to the external poloidal field, and sunspots diminish in number and size. At solar-cycle minimum, the toroidal field is, correspondingly, at minimum strength, sunspots are relatively rare, and the poloidal field is at its maximum strength. With the rise of the next 11-year sunspot cycle, differential rotation shifts magnetic energy back from the poloidal to the toroidal field, but with a polarity that is opposite to the previous cycle. The process carries on continuously, and in an idealized, simplified scenario, each 11-year sunspot cycle corresponds to a change, then, in the overall polarity of the Sun's large-scale magnetic field.[114][115] The Sun's magnetic field leads to many effects that are collectively called solar activity. Solar flares and coronal mass ejections tend to occur at sunspot groups. Slowly changing high-speed streams of solar wind are emitted from coronal holes at the photospheric surface. Both coronal mass ejections and high-speed streams of solar wind carry plasma and the interplanetary magnetic field outward into the Solar System.[116] The effects of solar activity on Earth include auroras at moderate to high latitudes and the disruption of radio communications and electric power. Solar activity is thought to have played a large role in the formation and evolution of the Solar System.[117] Long-term secular change in sunspot number is thought, by some scientists, to be correlated with long-term change in solar irradiance,[118] which, in turn, might influence Earth's long-term climate.[119] The solar cycle influences space weather conditions, including those surrounding Earth. For example, in the 17th century, the solar cycle appeared to have stopped entirely for several decades; few sunspots were observed during a period known as the Maunder minimum. This coincided in time with the era of the Little Ice Age, when Europe experienced unusually cold temperatures.[120] Earlier extended minima have been discovered through analysis of tree rings and appear to have coincided with lower-than-average global temperatures.[121] The temperature of the photosphere is approximately 6,000 K, whereas the temperature of the corona reaches 1,000,000–2,000,000 K.[84] The high temperature of the corona shows that it is heated by something other than direct heat conduction from the photosphere.[86] It is thought that the energy necessary to heat the corona is provided by turbulent motion in the convection zone below the photosphere, and two main mechanisms have been proposed to explain coronal heating.[84] The first is wave heating, in which sound, gravitational or magnetohydrodynamic waves are produced by turbulence in the convection zone.[84] These waves travel upward and dissipate in the corona, depositing their energy in the ambient matter in the form of heat.[122] The other is magnetic heating, in which magnetic energy is continuously built up by photospheric motion and released through magnetic reconnection in the form of large solar flares and myriad similar but smaller events—nanoflares.[123] Currently, it is unclear whether waves are an efficient heating mechanism. All waves except Alfvén waves have been found to dissipate or refract before reaching the corona.[124] In addition, Alfvén waves do not easily dissipate in the corona. Current research focus has therefore shifted towards flare heating mechanisms.[84] The Sun today is roughly halfway through the main-sequence portion of its life. It has not changed dramatically in over four billion[a] years and will remain fairly stable for about five billion more. However, after hydrogen fusion in its core has stopped, the Sun will undergo dramatic changes, both internally and externally. The Sun formed about 4.6 billion years ago from the collapse of part of a giant molecular cloud that consisted mostly of hydrogen and helium and that probably gave birth to many other stars.[125] This age is estimated using computer models of stellar evolution and through nucleocosmochronology.[13] The result is consistent with the radiometric date of the oldest Solar System material, at 4.567 billion years ago.[126][127] Studies of ancient meteorites reveal traces of stable daughter nuclei of short-lived isotopes, such as iron-60, that form only in exploding, short-lived stars. This indicates that one or more supernovae must have occurred near the location where the Sun formed. A shock wave from a nearby supernova would have triggered the formation of the Sun by compressing the matter within the molecular cloud and causing certain regions to collapse under their own gravity.[128] As one fragment of the cloud collapsed it also began to rotate due to conservation of angular momentum and heat up with the increasing pressure.[129] Much of the mass became concentrated in the center, whereas the rest flattened out into a disk that would become the planets and other Solar System bodies.[130][131] Gravity and pressure within the core of the cloud generated a lot of heat as it accumulated more matter from the surrounding disk, eventually triggering nuclear fusion.[132] The stars HD 162826 and HD 186302 share similarities with the Sun and are thus hypothesized to be its stellar siblings, formed in the same molecular cloud.[133][134] The Sun is about halfway through its main-sequence stage, during which nuclear fusion reactions in its core fuse hydrogen into helium. Each second, more than four billion kilograms of matter are converted into energy within the Sun's core, producing neutrinos and solar radiation. At this rate, the Sun has so far converted around 100 times the mass of Earth into energy, about 0.03% of the total mass of the Sun. The Sun will spend a total of approximately 10 to 11 billion years as a main-sequence star before the red giant phase of the Sun.[135] At the 8 billion year mark, the Sun will be at its hottest point according to the ESA's Gaia space observatory mission in 2022.[136] The Sun is gradually becoming hotter in its core, hotter at the surface, larger in radius, and more luminous during its time on the main sequence: since the beginning of its main sequence life, it has expanded in radius by 15% and the surface has increased in temperature from 5,620 K (9,660 °F) to 5,772 K (9,930 °F), resulting in a 48% increase in luminosity from 0.677 solar luminosities to its present-day 1.0 solar luminosity. This occurs because the helium atoms in the core have a higher mean molecular weight than the hydrogen atoms that were fused, resulting in less thermal pressure. The core is therefore shrinking, allowing the outer layers of the Sun to move closer to the center, releasing gravitational potential energy. According to the virial theorem, half of this released gravitational energy goes into heating, which leads to a gradual increase in the rate at which fusion occurs and thus an increase in the luminosity. This process speeds up as the core gradually becomes denser.[137] At present, it is increasing in brightness by about 1% every 100 million years. It will take at least 1 billion years from now to deplete liquid water from the Earth from such increase.[138] After that, the Earth will cease to be able to support complex, multicellular life and the last remaining multicellular organisms on the planet will suffer a final, complete mass extinction.[139] The Sun does not have enough mass to explode as a supernova. Instead, when it runs out of hydrogen in the core in approximately 5 billion years, core hydrogen fusion will stop, and there will be nothing to prevent the core from contracting. The release of gravitational potential energy will cause the luminosity of the Sun to increase, ending the main sequence phase and leading the Sun to expand over the next billion years: first into a subgiant, and then into a red giant.[137][140][141] The heating due to gravitational contraction will also lead to expansion of the Sun and hydrogen fusion in a shell just outside the core, where unfused hydrogen remains, contributing to the increased luminosity, which will eventually reach more than 1,000 times its present luminosity.[137] When the Sun enters its red-giant branch (RGB) phase, it will engulf (and very likely destroy) Mercury and Venus. According to a 2008 paper, Earth's orbit will have initially expanded to at most 1.5 AU (220 million km; 140 million mi) due to the Sun's loss of mass. However, Earth's orbit will then start shrinking due to tidal forces (and, eventually, drag from the lower chromosphere) so that it is engulfed by the Sun during the tip of the red-giant branch phase 7.59 billion years from now, 3.8 and 1 million years after Mercury and Venus have respectively suffered the same fate.[141] By the time the Sun reaches the tip of the red-giant branch, it will be about 256 times larger than it is today, with a radius of 1.19 AU (178 million km; 111 million mi).[141][142] The Sun will spend around a billion years in the RGB and lose around a third of its mass.[141] After the red-giant branch, the Sun has approximately 120 million years of active life left, but much happens. First, the core (full of degenerate helium) ignites violently in the helium flash; it is estimated that 6% of the core—itself 40% of the Sun's mass—will be converted into carbon within a matter of minutes through the triple-alpha process.[143] The Sun then shrinks to around 10 times its current size and 50 times the luminosity, with a temperature a little lower than today. It will then have reached the red clump or horizontal branch, but a star of the Sun's metallicity does not evolve blueward along the horizontal branch. Instead, it just becomes moderately larger and more luminous over about 100 million years as it continues to react helium in the core.[141] When the helium is exhausted, the Sun will repeat the expansion it followed when the hydrogen in the core was exhausted. This time, however, it all happens faster, and the Sun becomes larger and more luminous. This is the asymptotic-giant-branch phase, and the Sun is alternately reacting hydrogen in a shell or helium in a deeper shell. After about 20 million years on the early asymptotic giant branch, the Sun becomes increasingly unstable, with rapid mass loss and thermal pulses that increase the size and luminosity for a few hundred years every 100,000 years or so. The thermal pulses become larger each time, with the later pulses pushing the luminosity to as much as 5,000 times the current level. Despite this, the Sun's maximum AGB radius will not be as large as its tip-RGB maximum: 179 R☉, or about 0.832 AU (124.5 million km; 77.3 million mi).[141][144] Models vary depending on the rate and timing of mass loss. Models that have higher mass loss on the red-giant branch produce smaller, less luminous stars at the tip of the asymptotic giant branch, perhaps only 2,000 times the luminosity and less than 200 times the radius.[141] For the Sun, four thermal pulses are predicted before it completely loses its outer envelope and starts to make a planetary nebula.[145] The post-asymptotic-giant-branch evolution is even faster. The luminosity stays approximately constant as the temperature increases, with the ejected half of the Sun's mass becoming ionized into a planetary nebula as the exposed core reaches 30,000 K (53,500 °F), as if it is in a sort of blue loop. The final naked core, a white dwarf, will have a temperature of over 100,000 K (180,000 °F) and contain an estimated 54.05% of the Sun's present-day mass.[141] (Simulations indicate that the Sun may be among the least massive stars capable of forming a planetary nebula.[146]) The planetary nebula will disperse in about 10,000 years, but the white dwarf will survive for trillions of years before fading to a hypothetical super-dense black dwarf.[147][148][149] As such, it would give off no more energy.[150] The Sun has eight known planets orbiting it. This includes four terrestrial planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars), two gas giants (Jupiter and Saturn), and two ice giants (Uranus and Neptune). The Solar System also has nine bodies generally considered as dwarf planets and some more candidates, an asteroid belt, numerous comets, and a large number of icy bodies which lie beyond the orbit of Neptune. Six of the planets and many smaller bodies also have their own natural satellites: in particular, the satellite systems of Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus are in some ways like miniature versions of the Sun's system.[151] The Sun is moved by the gravitational pull of the planets. The center of the Sun moves around the Solar System barycenter, within a range from 0.1 to 2.2 solar radii. The Sun's motion around the barycenter approximately repeats every 179 years, rotated by about 30° due primarily to the synodic period of Jupiter and Saturn.[152] The Sun's gravitational field is estimated to dominate the gravitational forces of surrounding stars out to about two light-years (125,000 AU). Lower estimates for the radius of the Oort cloud, by contrast, do not place it farther than 50,000 AU.[153] Most of the mass is orbiting in the region between 3,000 and 100,000 AU.[154] The furthest known objects, such as Comet West, have aphelia around 70,000 AU from the Sun.[155] The Sun's Hill sphere with respect to the galactic nucleus, the effective range of its gravitational influence, is thought to extend up to a thousand times farther and encompasses the hypothetical Oort cloud.[156] It was calculated by G. A. Chebotarev to be 230,000 AU.[157] Within 10 light-years of the Sun there are relatively few stars, the closest being the triple star system Alpha Centauri, which is about 4.4 light-years away and may be in the Local Bubble's G-Cloud.[159] Alpha Centauri A and B are a closely tied pair of Sun-like stars, whereas the closest star to the Sun, the small red dwarf Proxima Centauri, orbits the pair at a distance of 0.2 light-years. In 2016, a potentially habitable exoplanet was found to be orbiting Proxima Centauri, called Proxima Centauri b, the closest confirmed exoplanet to the Sun.[160] The Solar System is surrounded by the Local Interstellar Cloud, although it is not clear if it is embedded in the Local Interstellar Cloud or if it lies just outside the cloud's edge.[161] Multiple other interstellar clouds exist in the region within 300 light-years of the Sun, known as the Local Bubble.[161] The latter feature is an hourglass-shaped cavity or superbubble in the interstellar medium roughly 300 light-years across. The bubble is suffused with high-temperature plasma, suggesting that it may be the product of several recent supernovae.[162] The Local Bubble is a small superbubble compared to the neighboring wider Radcliffe Wave and Split linear structures (formerly Gould Belt), each of which are some thousands of light-years in length.[163] All these structures are part of the Orion Arm, which contains most of the stars in the Milky Way that are visible to the unaided eye.[164] Groups of stars form together in star clusters, before dissolving into co-moving associations. A prominent grouping that is visible to the naked eye is the Ursa Major moving group, which is around 80 light-years away within the Local Bubble. The nearest star cluster is Hyades, which lies at the edge of the Local Bubble. The closest star-forming regions are the Corona Australis Molecular Cloud, the Rho Ophiuchi cloud complex and the Taurus molecular cloud; the latter lies just beyond the Local Bubble and is part of the Radcliffe wave.[165] The Sun, taking along the whole Solar System, orbits the galaxy's center of mass at an average speed of 230 km/s (828,000 km/h) or 143 mi/s (514,000 mph),[168] taking about 220–250 million Earth years to complete a revolution (a Galactic year),[169] having done so about 20 times since the Sun's formation.[170][171] The direction of the Sun's motion, the Solar apex, is roughly in the direction of the star Vega.[172] The Milky Way is moving with respect to the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) in the direction of the constellation Hydra with a speed of 550 km/s. Since the sun is moving with respect to the galactic center in the direction of Cygnus (galactic longitude 90°; latitude 0°) at more than 200 km/sec, the resultant velocity with respect to the CMB is about 370 km/s in the direction of Crater or Leo (galactic latitude 264°, latitude 48°).[173] In many prehistoric and ancient cultures, the Sun was thought to be a solar deity or other supernatural entity.[174][175] In the early first millennium BC, Babylonian astronomers observed that the Sun's motion along the ecliptic is not uniform, though they did not know why; it is today known that this is due to the movement of Earth in an elliptic orbit, moving faster when it is nearer to the Sun at perihelion and moving slower when it is farther away at aphelion.[176] One of the first people to offer a scientific or philosophical explanation for the Sun was the Greek philosopher Anaxagoras. He reasoned that it was a giant flaming ball of metal even larger than the land of the Peloponnesus and that the Moon reflected the light of the Sun.[177] Eratosthenes estimated the distance between Earth and the Sun in the third century BC as \"of stadia myriads 400 and 80000\", the translation of which is ambiguous, implying either 4,080,000 stadia (755,000 km) or 804,000,000 stadia (148 to 153 million kilometers or 0.99 to 1.02 AU); the latter value is correct to within a few percent. In the first century AD, Ptolemy estimated the distance as 1,210 times the radius of Earth, approximately 7.71 million kilometers (0.0515 AU).[178] The theory that the Sun is the center around which the planets orbit was first proposed by the ancient Greek Aristarchus of Samos in the third century BC,[179] and later adopted by Seleucus of Seleucia (see Heliocentrism).[180] This view was developed in a more detailed mathematical model of a heliocentric system in the 16th century by Nicolaus Copernicus.[181] Observations of sunspots were recorded during the Han dynasty (206 BC–AD 220) by Chinese astronomers, who maintained records of these observations for centuries. Averroes also provided a description of sunspots in the 12th century.[182] The invention of the telescope in the early 17th century permitted detailed observations of sunspots by Thomas Harriot, Galileo Galilei and other astronomers. Galileo posited that sunspots were on the surface of the Sun rather than small objects passing between Earth and the Sun.[183] Arabic astronomical contributions include Al-Battani's discovery that the direction of the Sun's apogee (the place in the Sun's orbit against the fixed stars where it seems to be moving slowest) is changing.[184] (In modern heliocentric terms, this is caused by a gradual motion of the aphelion of the Earth's orbit). Ibn Yunus observed more than 10,000 entries for the Sun's position for many years using a large astrolabe.[185] From an observation of a transit of Venus in 1032, the Persian astronomer and polymath Ibn Sina concluded that Venus was closer to Earth than the Sun.[186] In 1677, Edmond Halley observed a transit of Mercury across the Sun, leading him to realize that observations of the solar parallax of a planet (more ideally using the transit of Venus) could be used to trigonometrically determine the distances between Earth, Venus, and the Sun.[187] Careful observations of the 1769 transit of Venus allowed astronomers to calculate the average Earth–Sun distance as 93,726,900 miles (150,838,800 km), only 0.8% greater than the modern value.[188] In 1666, Isaac Newton observed the Sun's light using a prism, and showed that it is made up of light of many colors.[189] In 1800, William Herschel discovered infrared radiation beyond the red part of the solar spectrum.[190] The 19th century saw advancement in spectroscopic studies of the Sun; Joseph von Fraunhofer recorded more than 600 absorption lines in the spectrum, the strongest of which are still often referred to as Fraunhofer lines. The 20th century brought about several specialized systems for observing the Sun, especially at different narrowband wavelengths, such as those using Calcium H (396.9 nm), K (393.37 nm) and Hydrogen-alpha (656.46 nm) filtering.[191] During early studies of the optical spectrum of the photosphere, some absorption lines were found that did not correspond to any chemical elements then known on Earth. In 1868, Norman Lockyer hypothesized that these absorption lines were caused by a new element that he dubbed helium, after the Greek Sun god Helios. Twenty-five years later, helium was isolated on Earth.[192] In the early years of the modern scientific era, the source of the Sun's energy was a significant puzzle. Lord Kelvin suggested that the Sun is a gradually cooling liquid body that is radiating an internal store of heat.[193] Kelvin and Hermann von Helmholtz then proposed a gravitational contraction mechanism to explain the energy output, but the resulting age estimate was only 20 million years, well short of the time span of at least 300 million years suggested by some geological discoveries of that time.[193][194] In 1890, Lockyer proposed a meteoritic hypothesis for the formation and evolution of the Sun.[195] Not until 1904 was a documented solution offered. Ernest Rutherford suggested that the Sun's output could be maintained by an internal source of heat, and suggested radioactive decay as the source.[196] However, it would be Albert Einstein who would provide the essential clue to the source of the Sun's energy output with his mass–energy equivalence relation E = mc2.[197] In 1920, Sir Arthur Eddington proposed that the pressures and temperatures at the core of the Sun could produce a nuclear fusion reaction that merged hydrogen (protons) into helium nuclei, resulting in a production of energy from the net change in mass.[198] The preponderance of hydrogen in the Sun was confirmed in 1925 by Cecilia Payne using the ionization theory developed by Meghnad Saha. The theoretical concept of fusion was developed in the 1930s by the astrophysicists Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar and Hans Bethe. Hans Bethe calculated the details of the two main energy-producing nuclear reactions that power the Sun.[199][200] In 1957, Margaret Burbidge, Geoffrey Burbidge, William Fowler and Fred Hoyle showed that most of the elements in the universe have been synthesized by nuclear reactions inside stars, some like the Sun.[201] The first satellites designed for long term observation of the Sun from interplanetary space were NASA's Pioneers 6, 7, 8 and 9, which were launched between 1959 and 1968. These probes orbited the Sun at a distance similar to that of Earth, and made the first detailed measurements of the solar wind and the solar magnetic field. Pioneer 9 operated for a particularly long time, transmitting data until May 1983.[202][203] In the 1970s, two Helios spacecraft and the Skylab Apollo Telescope Mount provided scientists with significant new data on solar wind and the solar corona. The Helios 1 and 2 probes were U.S.–German collaborations that studied the solar wind from an orbit carrying the spacecraft inside Mercury's orbit at perihelion.[204] The Skylab space station, launched by NASA in 1973, included a solar observatory module called the Apollo Telescope Mount that was operated by astronauts resident on the station.[85] Skylab made the first time-resolved observations of the solar transition region and of ultraviolet emissions from the solar corona.[85] Discoveries included the first observations of coronal mass ejections, then called \"coronal transients\", and of coronal holes, now known to be intimately associated with the solar wind.[204] In 1980, the Solar Maximum Mission probes were launched by NASA. This spacecraft was designed to observe gamma rays, X-rays and UV radiation from solar flares during a time of high solar activity and solar luminosity. Just a few months after launch, however, an electronics failure caused the probe to go into standby mode, and it spent the next three years in this inactive state. In 1984, Space Shuttle Challenger mission STS-41C retrieved the satellite and repaired its electronics before re-releasing it into orbit. The Solar Maximum Mission subsequently acquired thousands of images of the solar corona before re-entering Earth's atmosphere in June 1989.[205] Launched in 1991, Japan's Yohkoh (Sunbeam) satellite observed solar flares at X-ray wavelengths. Mission data allowed scientists to identify several different types of flares and demonstrated that the corona away from regions of peak activity was much more dynamic and active than had previously been supposed. Yohkoh observed an entire solar cycle but went into standby mode when an annular eclipse in 2001 caused it to lose its lock on the Sun. It was destroyed by atmospheric re-entry in 2005.[206] The Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, jointly built by the European Space Agency and NASA, was launched on 2 December 1995.[85] Originally intended to serve a two-year mission,[207] SOHO remains in operation as of 2024.[208] Situated at the Lagrangian point between Earth and the Sun (at which the gravitational pull from both is equal), SOHO has provided a constant view of the Sun at many wavelengths since its launch.[85] Besides its direct solar observation, SOHO has enabled the discovery of a large number of comets, mostly tiny sungrazing comets that incinerate as they pass the Sun.[209] All these satellites have observed the Sun from the plane of the ecliptic, and so have only observed its equatorial regions in detail. The Ulysses probe was launched in 1990 to study the Sun's polar regions. It first traveled to Jupiter, to \"slingshot\" into an orbit that would take it far above the plane of the ecliptic. Once Ulysses was in its scheduled orbit, it began observing the solar wind and magnetic field strength at high solar latitudes, finding that the solar wind from high latitudes was moving at about 750 km/s, which was slower than expected, and that there were large magnetic waves emerging from high latitudes that scattered galactic cosmic rays.[210] Elemental abundances in the photosphere are well known from spectroscopic studies, but the composition of the interior of the Sun is more poorly understood. A solar wind sample return mission, Genesis, was designed to allow astronomers to directly measure the composition of solar material.[211] The brightness of the Sun can cause pain from looking at it with the naked eye; however, doing so for brief periods is not hazardous for normal non-dilated eyes.[212][213] Looking directly at the Sun (sungazing) causes phosphene visual artifacts and temporary partial blindness. It also delivers about 4 milliwatts of sunlight to the retina, slightly heating it and potentially causing damage in eyes that cannot respond properly to the brightness.[214][215] Viewing of the direct Sun with the naked eye can cause UV-induced, sunburn-like lesions on the retina beginning after about 100 seconds, particularly under conditions where the UV light from the Sun is intense and well focused.[216][217] Viewing the Sun through light-concentrating optics such as binoculars may result in permanent damage to the retina without an appropriate filter that blocks UV and substantially dims the sunlight. When using an attenuating filter to view the Sun, the viewer is cautioned to use a filter specifically designed for that use. Some improvised filters that pass UV or IR rays, can actually harm the eye at high brightness levels.[218] Brief glances at the midday Sun through an unfiltered telescope can cause permanent damage.[219] During sunrise and sunset, sunlight is attenuated because of Rayleigh scattering and Mie scattering from a particularly long passage through Earth's atmosphere,[220] and the Sun is sometimes faint enough to be viewed comfortably with the naked eye or safely with optics (provided there is no risk of bright sunlight suddenly appearing through a break between clouds). Hazy conditions, atmospheric dust, and high humidity contribute to this atmospheric attenuation.[221] An optical phenomenon, known as a green flash, can sometimes be seen shortly after sunset or before sunrise. The flash is caused by light from the Sun just below the horizon being bent (usually through a temperature inversion) towards the observer. Light of shorter wavelengths (violet, blue, green) is bent more than that of longer wavelengths (yellow, orange, red) but the violet and blue light is scattered more, leaving light that is perceived as green.[222] Solar deities play a major role in many world religions and mythologies.[223] Worship of the Sun was central to civilizations such as the ancient Egyptians, the Inca of South America and the Aztecs of what is now Mexico. In religions such as Hinduism, the Sun is still considered a god, known as Surya. Many ancient monuments were constructed with solar phenomena in mind; for example, stone megaliths accurately mark the summer or winter solstice (for example in Nabta Playa, Egypt; Mnajdra, Malta; and Stonehenge, England); Newgrange, a prehistoric human-built mount in Ireland, was designed to detect the winter solstice; the pyramid of El Castillo at Chichén Itzá in Mexico is designed to cast shadows in the shape of serpents climbing the pyramid at the vernal and autumnal equinoxes.[224] The ancient Sumerians believed that the Sun was Utu,[225][226] the god of justice and twin brother of Inanna, the Queen of Heaven,[225] who was identified as the planet Venus.[226] Later, Utu was identified with the East Semitic god Shamash.[225][226] Utu was regarded as a helper-deity, who aided those in distress.[225] From at least the Fourth Dynasty of Ancient Egypt, the Sun was worshipped as the god Ra, portrayed as a falcon-headed divinity surmounted by the solar disk, and surrounded by a serpent. In the New Empire period, the Sun became identified with the dung beetle. In the form of the sun disc Aten, the Sun had a brief resurgence during the Amarna Period when it again became the preeminent, if not only, divinity for the Pharaoh Akhenaton.[227][228] The Egyptians portrayed the god Ra as being carried across the sky in a solar barque, accompanied by lesser gods, and to the Greeks, he was Helios, carried by a chariot drawn by fiery horses. From the reign of Elagabalus in the late Roman Empire the Sun's birthday was a holiday celebrated as Sol Invictus (literally \"Unconquered Sun\") soon after the winter solstice, which may have been an antecedent to Christmas. Regarding the fixed stars, the Sun appears from Earth to revolve once a year along the ecliptic through the zodiac, and so Greek astronomers categorized it as one of the seven planets (Greek planetes, \"wanderer\"); the naming of the days of the weeks after the seven planets dates to the Roman era.[229][230][231] In Proto-Indo-European religion, the Sun was personified as the goddess *Seh2ul.[232][233] Derivatives of this goddess in Indo-European languages include the Old Norse Sól, Sanskrit Surya, Gaulish Sulis, Lithuanian Saulė, and Slavic Solntse.[233] In ancient Greek religion, the sun deity was the male god Helios,[234] who in later times was syncretized with Apollo.[235] In the Bible, Malachi 4:2 mentions the \"Sun of Righteousness\" (sometimes translated as the \"Sun of Justice\"),[236][237] which some Christians have interpreted as a reference to the Messiah (Christ).[238] In ancient Roman culture, Sunday was the day of the sun god. In paganism, the Sun was a source of life, giving warmth and illumination. It was the center of a popular cult among Romans, who would stand at dawn to catch the first rays of sunshine as they prayed. The celebration of the winter solstice (which influenced Christmas) was part of the Roman cult of the unconquered Sun (Sol Invictus). It was adopted as the Sabbath day by Christians. The symbol of light was a pagan device adopted by Christians, and perhaps the most important one that did not come from Jewish traditions. Christian churches were built so that the congregation faced toward the sunrise.[239] Tonatiuh, the Aztec god of the sun,[240] was closely associated with the practice of human sacrifice.[240] The sun goddess Amaterasu is the most important deity in the Shinto religion,[241][242] and she is believed to be the direct ancestor of all Japanese emperors.[241] Solar System → Local Interstellar Cloud → Local Bubble → Gould Belt → Orion Arm → Milky Way → Milky Way subgroup → Local Group → Local Sheet → Virgo Supercluster → Laniakea Supercluster → Local Hole → Observable universe → UniverseEach arrow (→) may be read as \"within\" or \"part of\".",

                "content": "This is an accepted version of this page Sven Magnus Øen Carlsen[a] (born 30 November 1990) is a Norwegian chess grandmaster. Carlsen is a five-time World Chess Champion, the reigning five-time World Rapid Chess Champion, the reigning seven-time World Blitz Chess Champion and the reigning Chess World Cup Champion. He has held the No. 1 position in the FIDE world chess rankings since 1 July 2011 and trails only Garry Kasparov in time spent as the highest-rated player in the world.[1] His peak rating of 2882 is the highest in history. He also holds the record for the longest unbeaten streak at an elite level in classical chess at 125 games.[2][3] A chess prodigy, Carlsen finished first in the C group of the Corus chess tournament shortly after he turned 13 and earned the title of grandmaster a few months later. At 15, he won the Norwegian Chess Championship, and later became the youngest ever player to qualify for the Candidates Tournament in 2005.[1] At 17, he finished joint first in the top group of Corus. He surpassed a rating of 2800 at 18, the youngest at the time to do so. In 2010, at 19, he reached No. 1 in the FIDE world rankings, the youngest person ever to do so. Carlsen became World Chess Champion in 2013 by defeating Viswanathan Anand. He retained his title against Anand the following year and won both the 2014 World Rapid Championship and World Blitz Championship, becoming the first player to hold all three titles simultaneously, a feat which he repeated in 2019 and 2022.[4][5] He defended his classical world title against Sergey Karjakin in 2016, Fabiano Caruana in 2018, and Ian Nepomniachtchi in 2021. Carlsen declined to defend his title in 2023, citing a lack of motivation.[6] Known for his attacking style as a teenager, Carlsen has since developed into a universal player. He uses a variety of openings to make it harder for opponents to prepare against him and reduce the utility of pre-game computer analysis.[7] Carlsen was born in Tønsberg, Norway, on 30 November 1990[8][9] to Sigrun Øen (1963–2024), a chemical engineer, and Henrik Albert Carlsen, an IT consultant.[10] The family spent one year in Espoo, Finland, and then in Brussels, Belgium, before returning to Norway in 1998, where they lived in Lommedalen, Bærum. They later moved to Haslum.[11] Carlsen showed an aptitude for intellectual challenges at a young age. At two years, he could solve 500-piece jigsaw puzzles; at four, he enjoyed assembling Lego sets with instructions intended for children aged 10–14.[12] His father, a keen amateur chess player,[13] taught him to play at age five, although he initially showed little interest in it.[14] He has three sisters, and in 2010 stated that one thing that first motivated him to take up chess seriously was the desire to beat his elder sister at the game.[15] The first chess book Carlsen read was a booklet named Find the Plan by Bent Larsen,[16] and his first book on openings was Eduard Gufeld's The Complete Dragon.[17] Carlsen developed his early chess skills playing by himself for hours on end—moving the pieces around, searching for combinations, and replaying games and positions his father showed him. Simen Agdestein emphasises Carlsen's exceptional memory, stating that he was able to recall the locations, populations, flags and capitals of all the countries in the world by age five. Later, he memorised the locations, populations, coats-of-arms and administrative centres of \"virtually all\" 356 Norwegian municipalities.[18] He participated in his first tournament—the youngest division of the 1999 Norwegian Chess Championship—at 8 years and 7 months, and scored 6/11.[19] Carlsen was coached at the Norwegian College of Elite Sport by the country's top player, Grandmaster (GM) Simen Agdestein,[10] who in turn cites Norwegian football manager Egil \"Drillo\" Olsen as a key inspiration for his coaching strategy.[20] In 2000, Agdestein introduced Carlsen to Torbjørn Ringdal Hansen, a former Norwegian junior champion and later International Master (IM) and Grandmaster (GM),[21] as Ringdal served a one-year siviltjeneste (an alternative civilian service programme) at the college. Over the course of that year, Carlsen's rating rose from 904 in June 2000 to 1907. His breakthrough occurred in the Norwegian junior teams championship in September 2000, where he scored 3½/5 against the country's top junior players and gained a tournament performance rating (TPR) of around 2000.[22] Apart from chess, which he studied about three to four hours a day, his favourite pastimes included playing football and reading Donald Duck comics.[23] He also practised skiing until age ten.[24] From autumn 2000 to the end of 2002, Carlsen played almost 300 rated tournament games, as well as in several blitz tournaments, and participated in other minor events.[25] In October 2002, he placed sixth in the European Under-12 Championship in Peñiscola.[26] The following month, he tied for first place in the 2002 World Under-12 Championship in Heraklion, placing second to Ian Nepomniachtchi on tiebreak.[27] He then obtained three IM norms in relatively quick succession: the first at the January 2003 Gausdal Troll Masters (score 7/10, 2453 PR); the second at the June 2003 Salongernas IM-tournament in Stockholm (6/9, 2470 PR); and the third at the July 2003 Politiken Cup in Copenhagen (8/11, 2503 PR). He was officially awarded the IM title on 20 August 2003.[28] After finishing primary school, Carlsen took a year off to participate in international chess tournaments in Europe during the autumn of 2003, then returned to complete secondary education at a sports school.[29][30] During the year away from school, he placed joint-third in the European Under-14 Championship[31] and ninth in the 2003 World Under-14 Championship.[32] Carlsen made headlines after his victory, at the age of 13, in the C group at the 2004 Corus chess tournament in Wijk aan Zee.[33] He obtained a score of 10½/13, losing just one game (against the highest-rated player of the C group, Duško Pavasovič).[34] As a result, he earned his first GM norm, and achieved a PR of 2702. Particularly notable was his win over Sipke Ernst in the penultimate round, when he sacrificed material to give mate in just 29 moves.[35] His victory in the C group qualified him to play in the B group in 2005, and it led Lubomir Kavalek, writing for the Washington Post, to give him the title \"the Mozart of chess\" (although, as pointed out by Edward Winter, the nickname had been given to many illustrious predecessors).[36] Agdestein said that Carlsen had an excellent memory and played an unusually wide range of openings.[37] Carlsen's prowess caught the attention of Microsoft, which became his sponsor.[38] Carlsen obtained his second GM norm at the Moscow Aeroflot Open in February. On 17 March, in a blitz chess tournament in Reykjavík, Iceland, he defeated former World Champion Anatoly Karpov. It was a preliminary event leading up to a rapid knockout tournament beginning the next day. In that event, Carlsen was paired with Garry Kasparov, then the top-rated player in the world. Carlsen achieved a draw in their first game but lost the second, and was thus knocked out of the tournament.[39] In the sixth Dubai Open Chess Championship, held 18–28 April, Carlsen obtained his third GM norm, which made him the world's youngest GM at the time, and the second-youngest GM in history at the time (after Sergey Karjakin, who earned the title at 12 years and 7 months).[40] Carlsen played in the FIDE World Chess Championship, becoming the youngest player ever to participate in one, but was knocked out in the first round by Levon Aronian.[41] In July, Carlsen and Berge Østenstad, then the reigning Norwegian champion, tied for first in the Norwegian Chess Championship, each scoring 7/9. A two-game match between them was arranged to decide the title. Both games were drawn, which left Østenstad the champion because he had superior tiebreaks in the tournament.[42] In the Smartfish Chess Masters event at the Drammen International Chess Festival 2004–05, Carlsen defeated Alexei Shirov, then ranked No. 10[43] in the world, as well as the co-winner of the tournament.[44] In the semi-finals of the Ciudad de León rapid chess tournament in June, Carlsen played a four-game match against Viswanathan Anand, who was ranked No. 2 in the world at the time and had won the 2003 World Rapid Chess Championship.[45] Anand won 3–1.[46] In the Norwegian Chess Championship, Carlsen again finished in shared first place, this time with his mentor Simen Agdestein. A playoff between them was played between 7 and 10 November. This time, Carlsen had the better tiebreaks, but the rule giving the title to the player with better tiebreak scores in the event of a 1–1 tie had been revoked. The match was closely fought—Agdestein won the first game, Carlsen the second—so it went into a series of two-game rapid matches until there was a winner. Carlsen won the first rapid game, Agdestein the second. Then followed three draws until Agdestein won the championship title with a victory in the sixth rapid game.[47] In October, Carlsen took first place at the Arnold Eikrem Memorial in Gausdal with a score of 8/9 and a PR of 2792.[48] At the end of 2005, Carlsen participated at the Chess World Cup in Khanty-Mansiysk, Russia. In the knockout tournament, he upset 44th-ranked Zurab Azmaiparashvili in round one, and proceeded to defeat Farrukh Amonatov and Ivan Cheparinov to reach the round of 16. There he lost to Evgeny Bareev,[49] but won against Joël Lautier and Vladimir Malakhov before losing again to Gata Kamsky. Carlsen finished in tenth place and became the youngest player to be an official World Championship Candidate.[50] Carlsen qualified for a place in the Corus B group due to his first-place finish in Corus group C in 2004. His shared first place with Alexander Motylev with 9/13 (+6−1=6) qualified him to play in the Corus group A in 2007.[51] At the 2006 international 'Bosna' tournament in Sarajevo, Carlsen shared first place with Liviu-Dieter Nisipeanu (who won on tiebreak evaluation) and Vladimir Malakhov; this could be regarded as Carlsen's first \"A\" elite tournament win, although it was not a clear first.[52] Carlsen was close to winning the 2006 Norwegian Chess Championship outright, but a last-round loss to Berge Østenstad dropped him into another tie for first place with Agdestein. It also prevented Carlsen from beating Agdestein's record as the youngest Norwegian champion ever.[53] Nonetheless, in the playoff held from 19 to 21 September, Carlsen won 3–1. After two draws at standard time controls, Carlsen won both rapid games in round two, securing his first Norwegian championship win.[54] Carlsen won the Glitnir Blitz Tournament in Iceland.[55] He achieved a 2–0 win over Viswanathan Anand in the semi-finals and achieved the same score in the finals.[56] He scored 6/8 in the 37th Chess Olympiad and achieved a PR of 2820.[57] In the Midnight Sun Chess Tournament in Tromsø, Carlsen finished second to Sergei Shipov.[58] In the Biel Grandmaster Tournament, he placed second, beating the tournament winner Alexander Morozevich twice.[59] In the NH Chess Tournament held in Amsterdam in August, Carlsen participated in an \"Experience\" vs. \"Rising Stars\" Scheveningen team match. The \"Rising Stars\" won the match 28–22, with Carlsen achieving the best individual score for the Rising Stars team (6½/10) and a 2700 PR, thus winning the right to participate in the 2007 Melody Amber tournament.[60] With a score of 7½/15, Carlsen placed 8th out of 16 participants at the World Blitz Championship in Rishon LeZion, Israel.[61] In the rapid chess tournament Rencontres nationales et internationales d'échecs in Cap d'Agde, France, he reached the semi-final, losing there to Sergey Karjakin.[62] In November, Carlsen achieved a shared 8th place of 10 participants in the Mikhail Tal Memorial in Moscow with two losses and seven draws. He finished ninth in a group of 18 participants in the associated blitz tournament, which was won by Anand.[63] Playing in the top group of the Corus chess tournament for the first time, Carlsen placed last with nine draws and four losses, scoring 4½/13.[64] In the Linares chess tournament, Carlsen played against top-rated players Veselin Topalov, Viswanathan Anand, Peter Svidler, Alexander Morozevich, Levon Aronian, Peter Leko, and Vasyl Ivanchuk. Despite being rated significantly lower than any of them, he finished in second place on tiebreaks with 7½/14, having scored four wins, seven draws and three losses, and achieving a PR of 2778.[65] Carlsen played for the first time in the Melody Amber blind and rapid chess tournament in Monte Carlo in March. In the 11 rounds, he achieved eight draws and three losses in the blindfold games, as well as three wins, seven draws and one loss in the rapid games. This resulted in a shared ninth place in the blindfold, shared second place in the rapid (behind Anand), and a shared eighth place overall.[66] In May and June, he participated in the Candidates Tournament for the FIDE World Chess Championship 2007, facing Levon Aronian in a six-game match at standard time controls, which Carlsen drew (+2−2=2) by coming from behind twice. The four-game rapid playoff was drawn as well (+1−1=2), with Carlsen winning the last game to stay in the match. Eventually, Aronian eliminated Carlsen from the tournament after winning both tiebreak blitz games.[67] In July and August, Carlsen won the Biel Grandmaster Tournament with a 6/10 record and a PR of 2753. His score was matched by Alexander Onischuk and they played a match to break the tie. After drawing two rapid and two blitz games, Carlsen won the armageddon game.[68] Immediately after the Biel tournament, Carlsen entered the open Arctic Chess Challenge in Tromsø, but his fourth-place result with +5=4 was a slight underperformance in terms of rating. In the first round, Carlsen conceded a draw to his classmate Brede Hagen (rated 2034)[69] after having a lost position at one point.[70] A game which attracted some attention was his sixth-round win over his father, Henrik Carlsen.[71] Carlsen reached the semi-final round of the World Chess Cup in December, after defeating Michael Adams in the round of 16 and Ivan Cheparinov in the quarterfinals. In the semi-final, he was eliminated by the eventual winner, Gata Kamsky, scoring ½–1½.[72] In the top group A of the 69th Corus chess tournament, Carlsen scored 8/13, achieving a PR of 2830. Carlsen won five games, lost two and drew six, sharing first place with Levon Aronian.[73] At the Linares chess tournament, Carlsen had another 2800+ PR, scoring 8/14. He finished in sole second place, ½ point behind the winner World Champion Viswanathan Anand.[74] In March, Carlsen played for the second time in the Melody Amber blind and rapid chess tournament, held in Nice for the first time. In the 11 rounds he achieved four wins, four draws and two losses in the blindfold, and three wins, two losses, and six draws in the rapid. This resulted in a shared fifth place in the blindfold, shared third place in the rapid and a shared second place in the overall tournament.[75] Carlsen was one of 21 players in the six-tournament FIDE Grand Prix 2008–2010, a qualifier for the World Chess Championship 2012. In the first tournament, in Baku, Azerbaijan, he finished in a three-way tie for first place, with another 2800 PR. He later withdrew from the Grand Prix cycle despite his initial success, criticising FIDE for \"changing the rules dramatically in the middle of a World Championship cycle\".[76] Carlsen won a rapid match against Peter Leko held in Miskolc, Hungary, scoring 5–3.[77] In June, Carlsen won the annual Aerosvit chess tournament,[78] finishing undefeated with 8/11 in a category 19 field and achieving a PR of 2877, his best PR at that point in his career.[79] Playing in the category 18 Biel Grandmaster Tournament, Carlsen finished third with 6/10, with a PR of 2740.[80] In the Mainz World Rapid Chess Championship, Carlsen finished in second place after losing the final to defending champion Anand 3–1.[81] In the qualification round Carlsen scored 1½–½ against Judit Polgár, 1–1 against Anand and 1–1 against Alexander Morozevich.[82] In the category 22 Bilbao Masters, Carlsen tied for second with a 2768 PR.[83] Playing in Group A of the 71st Corus chess tournament, Carlsen tied for fifth with a 2739 PR.[84] In the Linares chess tournament, he finished third with a 2777 PR.[85] He tied for second place with Veselin Topalov at the M-Tel Masters (category 21) tournament in Sofia, Bulgaria. He lost to eventual winner Alexei Shirov in their final game, dropping him from first.[86] Carlsen won the category 21 Nanjing Pearl Spring tournament, 2½ points ahead of second-place finisher Topalov, the world's highest-rated player at the time. He scored an undefeated 8/10, winning every game as white (against Topalov, Wang Yue, Leko, Teimour Radjabov, and Dmitry Jakovenko), and also winning as black against Jakovenko. By rating performance, this was one of the greatest results in history, with a PR of 3002.[87] Chess statistician Jeff Sonas has declared it one of the 20 best tournament performances of all time, and the best chess performance of all time by a teenager.[88] In the Tal Memorial, played from 5 to 14 November, Carlsen started with seven straight draws, but finished with wins over former FIDE World Champion Ruslan Ponomariov and Peter Leko. This result put Carlsen in shared second place behind former World Champion Vladimir Kramnik and equal with Ivanchuk.[89][90] After the Tal Memorial, Carlsen won the World Blitz Championship, played from 16 to 18 November in Moscow, Russia. His score of 28 wins, 6 draws and 8 losses left him three points ahead of Anand, who finished in second place.[91] Carlsen entered the London Chess Classic as the top seed in a field including Kramnik, Hikaru Nakamura, Michael Adams, Nigel Short, Ni Hua, Luke McShane and David Howell. He defeated Kramnik in round one and went on to win the tournament with 13/21 (three points were awarded for a win, and one for a draw; using classical scoring he finished with 5/7) and a PR of 2844, one point ahead of Kramnik. This victory propelled him to No. 1 of the FIDE rating list, surpassing Veselin Topalov.[92][93] Based on his average ranking from the July 2009 and January 2010 FIDE lists, Carlsen qualified for the Candidates Tournament that would determine the challenger to World Champion Viswanathan Anand in the World Chess Championship 2012. In November 2010, however, Carlsen announced he was withdrawing from the Candidates Tournament. Carlsen described the 2008–12 cycle as \"[not] sufficiently modern and fair\", and wrote that \"Reigning champion privileges, the long (five-year) span of the cycle, changes made during the cycle resulting in a new format (Candidates) that no World Champion has had to go through since Kasparov, puzzling ranking criteria as well as the shallow ceaseless match-after-match concept are all less than satisfactory in my opinion.\"[94] In early 2009 Carlsen engaged former World Champion Garry Kasparov as a personal trainer.[95] In September their partnership was revealed to the public by Norwegian newspapers.[96][97] Responding to a question in an interview with Time magazine in December 2009 as to whether he used computers when studying chess, Carlsen explained that he does not use a chess set when studying on his own.[98] Carlsen won the 72nd Corus chess tournament played 16–31 January with 8½ points. His ninth-round loss to Kramnik ended a streak of 36 rated games undefeated.[99] Carlsen struggled in the last round against Fabiano Caruana, but saved a draw, leaving him half a point ahead of Kramnik and Shirov.[100] In March it was announced that Carlsen had split from Kasparov and would no longer use him as a trainer,[101] although Carlsen later stated that they would remain in contact and he would continue to attend training sessions with Kasparov.[102] Carlsen shared first place alongside Ivanchuk in the Amber blindfold and rapid tournament. Scoring 6½/11 in the blindfold and 8/11 in the rapid, Carlsen accumulated 14½ from a possible 22 points.[103] Carlsen helped Anand prepare for the World Chess Championship 2010 against Veselin Topalov, which Anand won 6½–5½ to retain the title. Carlsen had also helped Anand prepare for the World Chess Championships in 2007 and 2008.[104] Carlsen won the Bazna Kings Tournament in Romania in June, two points ahead of Radjabov and Boris Gelfand.[105] In August, Carlsen played in the Arctic Securities Chess Stars tournament in Kristiansund, Norway., defeating Anand 1½–½ in the two-game final to win the championship.[106] Carlsen suffered setbacks in his next two tournaments. In the 39th Chess Olympiad he scored 4½/8, losing three games, to Baadur Jobava, Michael Adams, and Sanan Sjugirov; these were his first losses with the black pieces in more than a year.[107] His team, Norway, finished 51st out of 149 teams.[108] Carlsen played in the Grand Slam Masters Final in October, which he had qualified for automatically by winning three of the previous year's four Grand Slam chess events.[109][110] The average Elo of the participants at the time was 2789, making the Grand Slam Final the strongest chess tournament in history. In the first round, Carlsen lost with black to Kramnik; this was Carlsen's second consecutive loss to Kramnik, and placed his hold on the world No. 1 ranking in jeopardy. In his second round, Carlsen lost with the white pieces to Anand; this was his first loss as White since January 2010. Carlsen recovered somewhat in the latter part of the tournament, achieving a win over Shirov, and finishing with 2½/6; Kramnik won the event with 4/6.[111] In October, Carlsen competed at the Pearl Spring chess tournament in Nanjing, China.[112] This was the only tournament in 2010 to feature Anand, Carlsen and Topalov, at the time the top three players in the world, and was the first tournament in history to feature three players rated at least 2800. Carlsen secured first place by defeating Topalov with black. This was his second victory in the tournament over the former world No. 1; his final score of 7/10 (with a PR of 2903) was a full point ahead of runner-up Anand.[113] On 5 November, Carlsen withdrew from the 2011 Candidates Tournament, having qualified as the highest rated challenger, citing dissatisfaction with the World Championship cycle format.[114] In the World Blitz Championship, held in Moscow in November, Carlsen finished third with a score of 23½/38, behind Radjabov and winner Levon Aronian.[115] After the tournament, Carlsen played a private 40-game blitz match against Hikaru Nakamura,[116] winning with a score of 24½–15½.[117] Carlsen won the London Chess Classic in December, ahead of Anand and McShane.[118] Carlsen competed in the GM-A group of the 73rd Tata Steel Chess Tournament (formerly called the Corus chess tournament) on 14–30 January in Wijk aan Zee in an attempt to defend his title; the field included World Champion Viswanathan Anand, Levon Aronian, former World Champion Vladimir Kramnik, Alexander Grischuk, Hikaru Nakamura, Ruslan Ponomariov, among others. Despite losing games with white against Anish Giri and reigning Russian champion Ian Nepomniachtchi, Carlsen finished with 8/13, including victories over Kramnik and tournament winner Nakamura.[119] Although Carlsen's performance raised his rating from 2814 to 2815, Anand's 8½/13 score elevated his rating to 2817, making him the world No. 1 for the March 2011 FIDE rating list.[120] The first tournament victory of the year came in the Bazna Kings tournament, a double round robin played in Mediaș, Romania on 11–21 June. Carlsen finished with 6½/10, equal with Sergey Karjakin but with a better tiebreak score. Carlsen won his White games against Nakamura, Nisipeanu, and Ivanchuk and drew the rest of the games.[121] Carlsen won the 44th Biel Grandmaster tournament, held from 16 to 29 July. He took clear first place with a score of 19/30 (+5−1=4; three points for a win) in a field comprising Fabiano Caruana, Maxime Vachier-Lagrave, Alexander Morozevich, Alexey Shirov and Yannick Pelletier, two points ahead of Morozevich. This was Carlsen's second title.[122][123] The Grand Slam Chess Final was held as a double round robin with six players, in São Paulo (25 September – 1 October) and Bilbao (5–11 October). Although Carlsen had a slow start, including a loss against bottom-ranked Francisco Vallejo Pons, he finished +3−1=6, equal with Ivanchuk (whose +4−3=3 finish was equal due to three points for a win). Carlsen then won the blitz tiebreak against Ivanchuk. The other players were Anand, Aronian, Nakamura, and Vallejo Pons.[124] Another tournament victory was achieved in the Tal Memorial in Moscow 16–25 November as a round robin with ten players. Carlsen won two games, against Gelfand and Nakamura, and drew the rest. Although he finished equal on points with Aronian, he placed ahead since the tiebreak was determined by the number of black games; Carlsen had five black games, while Aronian only had four.[125][126] In the London Chess Classic, played 3–12 December, Carlsen's streak of tournament victories ended when he finished third, behind Kramnik and Nakamura. Carlsen won three games and drew five. Although he did not win the tournament, Carlsen gained rating points, rising to a new personal record of 2835.[127] At the 74th Tata Steel Chess Tournament held on 14–29 January in Wijk aan Zee, Carlsen finished in a shared second place with 8/13, behind Aronian, and equal with Radjabov and Caruana. Carlsen defeated Gashimov, Aronian, Gelfand, and Topalov, but lost against Karjakin.[128] At the blitz chess tournament at Tal Memorial, held in Moscow on 7 June, Carlsen shared first place with Morozevich.

In the exhibition blitz tournament at Biel before the GM tournament, Carlsen was eliminated (+1−2=0) in the first round by Étienne Bacrot. Bacrot deprived Carlsen of a win in the classical tournament by holding him to a draw in the final round. Carlsen would have won the classical tournament on the traditional 1–½–0 scoring system, with 7/10.[130] The Grand Slam Chess Final was again held as a double round robin with six players, in São Paulo and Bilbao. Carlsen started with a loss against Caruana, but after three wins in the second (Bilbao) round, finished +4−1=5, equal first with Caruana, and ahead of Aronian, Karjakin and Anand.

He had his first win in game 5 by taking advantage of a small mistake by Anand, and emerged victorious in games 6 and 9, making him the 16th undisputed World Chess Champion. From 29 January to 4 February, Carlsen played in the Zurich Chess Challenge, winning the blitz event (+2−1=2) and the classical event (+3−0=2).

Each of the panel members proposed a move and the public could then vote over the proposed moves. Each panel member was allowed three chances to let chess engine Houdini propose a move during the game. Norway's moves were executed by Oddvar Brå who was disguised in a red spandex suit for the occasion. The game was drawn when Carlsen forced a perpetual check.[148] From 2–13 June, Carlsen played in the second edition of Norway Chess, a ten-man round robin.

Carlsen had a poor start to the tournament with two draws and a loss in the third round to Radosław Wojtaszek, which left him in tenth place among the fourteen players. However, six consecutive wins thrust Carlsen into clear first place. Drawing the final four games was sufficient to win the tournament with 9 points out of 13, half a point ahead of Anish Giri, Maxime Vachier-Lagrave, Wesley So and Ding Liren.[155][156] In February, Carlsen won the 3rd Grenke Chess Classic after a five-game tiebreak with Arkadij Naiditsch. Carlsen had finished joint first with Naiditsch on 4½/7, beating Michael Adams, Anand, and David Baramidze, and losing to Naiditsch in their classical encounter.[157] This tournament victory meant that Carlsen began 2015 by winning two out of two tournaments.

He won against Grischuk in round 5, drew against Nakamura and Vachier-Lagrave in rounds 6 and 7, and defeated Aronian in round 8, but he lost the last round against Jon Ludvig Hammer, leaving him in seventh place and with a performance rating of 2693.[160] Carlsen said of this result: \"It's just extremely frustrating not to be able to show anything close to what I am capable of in my home country.\"[161] From 22 August to 3 September, Carlsen played in the 2015 Sinquefield Cup. He finished in second place with 5/9 (+3−2=4), one point behind winner Levon Aronian.

He scored 5½/9 (+2−0=7) in the event, defeating Nakamura (thus inflicting Nakamura's 12th classical loss to Carlsen) and Grischuk, and finished joint first with Anish Giri and Maxime Vachier-Lagrave. In the 3-way tiebreak, Carlsen was the top seed, meaning he faced the winner of the first tie-break match between Giri and Vachier-Lagrave. Carlsen eventually won the tournament by defeating Vachier-Lagrave, which meant he also won the overall Grand Chess Tour.[167] Carlsen then played in the second edition of the Qatar Masters Open, which was held from 20 to 29 December.

It was the first decisive result in a classical time limit World Chess Championship game in more than 5 years and at 136 moves was also the longest game in World Chess Championship history.[243] Subsequently, Carlsen also defeated Nepomniachtchi in Games 8, 9, and 11, thus retaining his championship title.[244] After the match, Carlsen announced that \"Unless Firouzja wins the Candidates Tournament, it is unlikely that I will play the next world championship match.\"[245] In January, Carlsen won his eighth Tata Steel Chess Tournament. He finished with a score of 9½/13, with no losses and six wins, including wins against Shakhriyar Mamedyarov and Fabiano Caruana.[246] In early June, Carlsen placed first in the Norway Chess Tournament, ahead of Shakhriyar Mamedyarov and Viswanathan Anand who finished second and third, respectively.[247] He finished with a score of 16½/30,[247] with no losses and three wins, including wins against Teimour Radjabov, Anish Giri and Shakhriyar Mamedyarov. This was Carlsen's fourth consecutive win of the prestigious super tournament and fifth overall in the last decade. On 20 July, the deadline FIDE had given him, Carlsen announced that he would not defend his World Championship title against Nepomniachtchi in the 2023 World Chess Championship match.[248] Carlsen said he enjoyed playing chess tournaments more than championships,[249] and would still continue playing professional chess.[250] Throughout the year, Carlsen competed in the Champions Chess Tour 2022.[251] He won the Airthings Masters, Charity Cup, and FTX Crypto Cup. Carlsen joined the Norway team for the 44th Chess Olympiad.[251] He was the runner-up in the Chess.com Speed Championship.[252] Carlsen won the World Rapid Chess Championship 2022 with a score of 10/13 (+8-1=4). He also won the World Blitz Chess Championship 2022 with a score of 16/21 (+13-2=6). This marks the third time in Carlsen's career that he has simultaneously held the Classical, Rapid, and Blitz World Titles, with 2014 and 2019 being the other two occurrences. In August and September, Carlsen participated as a wildcard in the 2022 Sinquefield Cup as part of the Grand Chess Tour 2022. He won his first game against Nepomniachtchi, the Candidates Tournament 2022 winner. He subsequently drew his second game to Levon Aronian, leaving him in tied first place with American wildcard Hans Niemann. In the third game, Carlsen was defeated by Niemann, ending his 53-game unbeaten streak in classical chess that chess24 described as a \"stunning victory\".[253][254] Carlsen soon after announced his withdrawal in a tweet with a video of Portuguese football manager José Mourinho saying, \"I prefer really not to speak. If I speak, I am in big trouble.\"[255][256] The New York Times stated that \"online observers interpreted Mr. Carlsen's post as insinuating that Mr. Niemann cheated in some way during the game\", though no concrete evidence of cheating had been found.[257] Carlsen's previous results still affect his FIDE rating; however, they will be removed from the tournament standing.[256] This was the first time in Carlsen's career to withdraw from a major event in progress, and was considered \"virtually unprecedented\" in top level chess.[256] Two weeks later, Carlsen faced Niemann in the Julius Baer Generation Cup, a section of the Champions Chess Tour 2022, an online chess tour. Carlsen, playing as black, resigned after one move, continuing the scandal.[258] On 26 September, Carlsen finally broke his silence and accused Niemann of cheating.[259] Subsequently, on 20 October Niemann filed a lawsuit against Carlsen and four other defendants, alleging five counts of action, including libel and slander.[260][261] The case was dismissed in June 2023, with the judge ruling that the claim of defamation was outside her federal jurisdiction.[262] In December 2023, the FIDE Ethics & Disciplinary Commission fined Carlsen €10,000 for his withdrawal from the tournament.[263][264] In January, Carlsen participated in the Tata Steel Chess Tournament. He lost consecutive games, which had not happened since 2015, first to Anish Giri and then to the young Uzbek prodigy Nodirbek Abdusattorov.[265] He recovered and finished 3rd, with the same score as Abdusattorov, but behind Giri, who won the tournament.[266] In February, Carlsen participated in the Airthings Masters 2023 which he won by defeating the American Grandmaster Hikaru Nakamura in the finals. Having earlier declined to defend his World Championship title, Carlsen ceased to be World Champion at the completion of the title match between Ding Liren and Ian Nepomniachtchi (the World Chess Championship 2023), won by Ding. In an interview after the match, Carlsen said he was \"suffering from a lack of motivation to play classical chess, because of the dominance of opening preparation\".[267] Subsequently, he did not enter the cycle for the World Chess Championship 2024. Carlsen competed in the Norway Chess tournament, and performed poorly with a score of 11½/27, drawing 8 classical games, losing 1, and winning 0. He managed to win 7/8 Armageddon blitz games (after a drawn classical game). Carlsen competed in two Grand Chess Tour events as wild cards, winning both, the Poland Rapid & Blitz and Croatia Rapid & Blitz. In the 2023 Chess World Cup, Carlsen reached the finals by defeating 65th seed Aryan Tari in the third round, 32nd seed Vincent Keymer in the fourth round, Vasyl Ivanchuk in the fifth round, Gukesh D in the quarterfinals, and Nijat Abasov in the semi-finals. Carlsen was sickened by food poisoning during the tournament.[268] In the finals against R Praggnanandhaa, Carlsen won during the tiebreaks, making it his first time winning a World Cup.[268][269] He defeated Alireza Firouzja in the final of the 2023 Julius Baer Generation Cup to clinch his third tournament victory on the 2023 Champions Chess Tour.[270] Carlsen won his third Speed Chess Championship, beating five-time defending champion Hikaru Nakamura in the final to deny him a sixth consecutive title.[271] Carlsen beat Wesley So in the 2023 Champions Chess Tour finals to win the Champions Chess Tour for a third consecutive year.[272] Carlsen won the World Rapid Chess Championship 2023 with a score of 10/13 (+7-0=6). He won his 5th World Rapid Chess Championship title. He also won the World Blitz Chess Championship 2023 with a score of 16/21 (+12-1=8). He won his 7th World Blitz Chess Championship title. He became the first man to successfully defend both the rapid and blitz titles simultaneously in the world championships.[273] In February, Carlsen participated in the Champions Chess Tour Chessable Masters competition, where he won the grand finale for a $30,000 prize.[274][275] In February, Carlsen organized and played in the Freestyle Chess G.O.A.T. Challenge, which was an over-the-board Fischer random chess tournament which included some of the top players in the world. He placed fifth in the round-robin rapid portion of the tournament, which determined the pairings for the main event, which was played under classical time controls. He won the main event, beating Fabiano Caruana in the final for a $60,000 prize.[276] It was the first ever classical Fischer random chess super-tournament.[277] In September, Carlsen won his fourth Speed Chess Championship title, defeating GM Alireza Firouzja in the finals held in Paris, France. Carlsen displayed a dominant performance, finishing with a score of 23.5-7.5, winning 21 games, drawing 5, and losing only 5 in the four-hour match. Carlsen and GM Hikaru Nakamura remain the only players to have won the tournament since its inception in 2016.[278] Also in September, Carlsen played in the 45th Chess Olympiad for Team Norway, and they placed 14th out of 188 countries. Carlsen finished with a score of 6/8, conceding draws to Mustafa Yilmaz, and Parham Maghsoodloo, while only losing to Vladimir Fedoseev. A notable win was against Vietnam GM Liem Le.[279] To finish September, Carlsen also took home the 2024 Julius Baer Generation Cup, by going undefeated and beating Alireza Firouzja 2.5-1.5 in the Grand Final.[280] On 21 December, Carlsen defeated Ian Nepomniachtchi in the finals of Champions Chess Tour 2024, winning the tournament for a fifth consecutive time.[281][282] On 27 December, following round six of the World Rapid Chess Championship, Carlsen was warned and fined for wearing jeans. He refused to change his jeans, causing him to not be paired for round nine. He proceeded to withdraw himself from both the Rapid and the Blitz tournaments.[283][284][285] TPR (Tournament Performance ratings) of FIDE-rated events calculated according to FIDE.[286] Carlsen won the Chess Oscars from 2009 to 2013. The Chess Oscar, organised by the Russian chess magazine 64, was awarded to the year's best player according to a worldwide poll of leading chess critics, writers, and journalists, but it was no longer awarded after 2013, as 64 ceased publication.[466][467] The Norwegian tabloid Verdens Gang (VG) has awarded Carlsen the \"Name of the Year\" (Årets navn) twice, in 2009[468] and 2013.[469] VG also named him \"Sportsman of the Year\" in 2009.[470] Carlsen has also won the Folkets Idrettspris, a people's choice award from the Norwegian newspaper Dagbladet, in 2009[471] and 2010.[472] In 2011, he was awarded the Peer Gynt Prize, a Norwegian prize awarded annually to \"a person or institution that has achieved distinction in society\".[473] In 2013, Time magazine named Carlsen one of the 100 most influential people in the world.[474] In the January 2006 FIDE rankings, at the age of 15 years and 32 days, Carlsen attained a 2625 Elo rating, which made him the youngest person to surpass 2600[475] (the record has since been broken by Wesley So, Wei Yi, John M. Burke, and Yağız Kaan Erdoğmuş[476]). In the July 2007 FIDE rankings, at the age of 16 years and 213 days, Carlsen attained a 2710 Elo rating, which made him the youngest person to surpass 2700 (the record has since been broken by Wei Yi).[477] On 5 September 2008, after winning in round 4 of the Bilbao Masters, Carlsen, aged 17 years and 280 days old, briefly became No. 1 on the unofficial live ratings list.[478][479] Carlsen's victory in the 2009 Nanjing Pearl tournament raised his FIDE rating to 2801, making him, aged 18 years and 336 days, at the time the youngest player ever to surpass 2800[87] (a record subsequently broken by Alireza Firouzja).[480] The youngest before Carlsen to achieve this feat was Vladimir Kramnik at the age of 25,[481] and up until this point only Kasparov, Topalov, Kramnik, and Anand had achieved a 2800+ rating.[482] The FIDE rankings in January 2010 recorded Carlsen's rating at 2810, which made him No. 1 rated player in the world.[483] This meant that Carlsen became, at the age of 19 years and 32 days, the youngest ever world No. 1, as well as the first player from a Western nation to reach the top of the FIDE rankings since Bobby Fischer in 1971.[484][485][486] The March 2010 FIDE rankings showed Carlsen with a new peak rating of 2813, a figure that only Kasparov had bettered at that time.[101] On the January 2013 FIDE rankings, Carlsen reached 2861, thus surpassing Garry Kasparov's 2851 record from July 1999.[134][135] In the May 2014 rankings, Carlsen achieved an all-time high record of 2882,[487] with a peak of 2889 on the live ratings list achieved on 21 April 2014.[488] In August 2019 he equalled his peak FIDE rating of 2882.[489] As of December 2024,[update] Carlsen is also ranked No. 1 in the FIDE rapid rating list with a rating of 2838, and No. 1 in the FIDE blitz rating list with a rating of 2890.[490] Carlsen had an aggressive style of play as a youth,[491][492] and, according to Simen Agdestein, his play was characterised by \"a fearless readiness to offer material for activity\".[493] As he matured, Carlsen found that this risky playing style was not as well suited against the elite of the chess world. When he started playing in top tournaments, he had trouble getting much out of the opening. To progress, Carlsen's style became more universal, capable of handling all sorts of positions well. He opens with both 1.d4 and 1.e4, as well as 1.c4, and, on occasion, 1.Nf3, thus making it harder for opponents to prepare against him and reducing the effect of computer analysis.[494][495][496] He said in 2015 that the middlegame is his favourite part of the game as it comes down to \"pure chess\".[494] In a 2016 interview, Anish Giri said: \"Magnus and I are very close in terms of style, but in our approach to the game we're total opposites. Magnus tries to put the accent only on play, getting away from preparation, but for me preparation plays an enormous role.\"[497] [Carlsen] has been known to say that he isn't all that interested in opening preparation; his main forte is the middlegame, in which he manages to outplay many of his opponents with positional means. ... Carlsen's repertoire is aimed at avoiding an early crisis in the game. He invariably aims for middlegames that lend themselves to a strategic approach. Garry Kasparov, who coached Carlsen from 2009 to 2010, said that Carlsen has a positional style similar to that of past world champions such as Anatoly Karpov, José Raúl Capablanca, and Vasily Smyslov, rather than the tactical style of Alexander Alekhine, Mikhail Tal, and Kasparov himself.[499] In a 2013 interview, Peter Heine Nielsen said: \"The days of big novelties are over, and that fits Magnus' style well.\"[500] According to Carlsen, however, he does not have any preferences in playing style.[501] Kasparov said in 2013 that \"Carlsen is a combination of Karpov [and] Fischer. He gets his positions [and] then never lets go of that bulldog bite. Exhausting for opponents.\"[502][non-primary source needed] Carlsen has also stated that he follows in the traditions of Karpov and Fischer, but additionally mentions Reuben Fine as a player who \"was doing in chess similar to what I am doing\".[503] Anand said of Carlsen in 2012: \"Magnus has an incredible innate sense. ... The majority of ideas occur to him absolutely naturally. He's also very flexible, he knows all the structures and he can play almost any position.\" He also compared Carlsen to Boris Spassky in his prime, and stated that \"Magnus can literally do almost everything.\"[504] Kasparov expressed similar sentiments: \"[Carlsen] has the ability to correctly evaluate any position, which only Karpov could boast of before him.\"[505] When asked in a 2016 interview whether Carlsen's style resembles his own, Karpov answered: \"It is quite possible. He grew up when I was in power, and perhaps he studied my games. He can convert a minimal advantage into a real one.\"[506] In a 2012 interview, Vladimir Kramnik stated that Carlsen's \"excellent physical shape\" was a contributing factor to his success against other top players as it prevents \"psychological lapses\", which enables him to maintain a high standard of play over long games and at the end of tournaments, when the energy levels of others have dropped.[507] Levon Aronian said in 2015: \"Magnus' main secret is his composure and the absence of any soul-searching after mistakes during a game.\"[508] Tyler Cowen gave a point of view on Carlsen's playing style: \"Carlsen is demonstrating one of his most feared qualities, namely his 'nettlesomeness,' to use a term coined for this purpose by Ken Regan, of the University at Buffalo.[509] Using computer analysis, you can measure which players do the most to cause their opponents to make mistakes. Carlsen has the highest nettlesomeness score by this metric, because his creative moves pressure the other player and open up a lot of room for mistakes. In contrast, a player such as Kramnik plays a high percentage of very accurate moves, and of course he is very strong, but those moves are in some way calmer and they are less likely to induce mistakes in response.\"[510] Carlsen's endgame prowess has been singled out for praise.[511][512][513] Jon Speelman, analysing several of Carlsen's endgames from the 2012 London Classic (in particular, his wins against McShane, Aronian, and Adams), described what he calls the \"Carlsen effect\": ... through the combined force of his skill and no less important his reputation, he drives his opponents into errors. ... He plays on for ever, calmly, methodically and, perhaps most importantly of all, without fear: calculating superbly, with very few outright mistakes and a good proportion of the \"very best\" moves. This makes him a monster and makes many opponents wilt.[514] An artificial intelligence approach, designed by Jean-Marc Alliot of the Institut de recherche en informatique de Toulouse (\"Toulouse Computer Science Research Institute\"), which compares chess grandmaster moves against that of Stockfish—a chess engine that outperforms all human opponents—rated Carlsen as the best player of all time as he had the highest probability among all World Chess Champions to play the moves that Stockfish suggested.[515] Carlsen also plays speed chess online under many screen names. He is known for meme openings such as the Bongcloud Attack and exceptionally strong play, despite banter and gags.[516] Carlsen modelled for G-Star Raw's Fall/Winter 2010 advertising campaign along with American actress Liv Tyler. The campaign was shot by Dutch film director and photographer Anton Corbijn.[522] The campaign was coordinated with the RAW World Chess Challenge in New York, an event in which Carlsen played an online team of global chess players, who voted on moves suggested by Maxime Vachier-Lagrave, Hikaru Nakamura and Judit Polgár. Carlsen, playing white, won in 43 moves.[523] In February 2014, he appeared in G-Star Raw's Spring/Summer 2014 campaign along with actress and model Lily Cole.[524] Film director J. J. Abrams offered Carlsen a role in the movie Star Trek Into Darkness as \"a chess player from the future\", but Carlsen was unable to get a work permit in time for shooting.[525] In 2012, Carlsen was featured in a 60 Minutes segment[526] and appeared as a guest on The Colbert Report.[527] He was also interviewed by Rainn Wilson for SoulPancake in 2013.[528] As of 2012[update], Carlsen is the only active chess professional with a full-time manager; Espen Agdestein, a FIDE Master and brother of Carlsen's former trainer Simen Agdestein, began working as an agent for Carlsen in late 2008.[529] Agdestein's work consisted initially of finding sponsors and negotiating media contacts but, since 2011, he has taken over management tasks formerly performed by Carlsen's father Henrik.[530] According to The New York Times, Carlsen earned US$1.2 million in 2012, the bulk of which was from sponsorships.[531] In August 2013, Carlsen became an ambassador for Nordic Semiconductor,[532] and in November was selected as one of the \"sexiest men of 2013\" by Cosmopolitan.[533] In 2017, Carlsen made a special guest appearance on The Simpsons in an episode where Homer's chess history is revealed.[534] In 2020, Carlsen announced that he had signed a two-year sponsorship deal with gambling company Unibet to act as a \"global ambassador\".[535] Unibet parent company Kindred Group is also a sponsor of Offerspill Chess Club. Offerspill was founded by Carlsen in 2019 after the Norwegian Chess Federation turned down Kindred's sponsorship offer. It is now Norway's largest chess club; Carlsen is its current chairman.[536] In April 2022, the Kindred Group (through Unibet) extended its partnership with Carlsen for another two years, and also extended its sponsorship of Offerspill.[537] In October 2013, Carlsen co-founded a company, Play Magnus AS, with Espen Agdestein and Anders Brandt.[538] Based in Oslo, Norway, Play Magnus' first product was an iOS app, called Play Magnus, that allows the user to play a chess engine created using a database of thousands of Carlsen's recorded games from the age of five and up. Carlsen stated he wished for the app to encourage more people to play chess.[539][540] In March 2019, Play Magnus AS merged with chess24.com, consolidating into the Play Magnus Group.[541] On 8 October 2020, Play Magnus Group was listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange. Magnus Chess, an entity controlled by Carlsen and his family, then owned 9.5% of Play Magnus Group.[542] In August 2022, Chess.com finalised an offer of acquisition for Play Magnus Group, which officially closed on 16 December 2022. As part of the acquisition, Carlsen signed as a brand ambassador for Chess.com.[543][544][545] As of 2016, Carlsen identifies as a social democrat and mostly follows a vegetarian diet; two of his sisters are vegetarians.[546] Carlsen is an avid fan of association football, with Real Madrid CF as his favourite club. In recognition of becoming world chess champion, he took the honorary kick-off in a La Liga game between Real Madrid and Real Valladolid on 30 November 2013.[547] Carlsen also follows the Premier League and plays fantasy football. In December 2019, he reached the No. 1 spot on a Fantasy Premier League game, ahead of seven million other players, before eventually finishing the season in 10th place.[548][549]",

                "content": "Magnus Carlsen (born Sven Magnus Øen Carlsen, 30 November 1990) was the World Chess Champion (2013-2023). He became World Champion on 22 November 2013, by defeating Viswanathan Anand by 6½ to 3½.[1] Carlsen also won the return match in 2014 by 6½–4½. He also won the match against Sergey Karjakin in 2016, against Fabiano Caruana in 2018, and against Ian Nepomniachtchi in 2021. A Norwegian chess grandmaster and chess prodigy, Carlsen is the highest rated player in the world,[2] and the highest rated player in the history of chess.[3][4] His peak rating of 2882 is higher than even Kasparov achieved. Kasparov's highest rating was 2851.[5] On 26 April 2004, Carlsen became a grandmaster at the age of 13 years, 148 days. This made him the third-youngest grandmaster in history. He played at the Nanjing Pearl Spring tournament in September–October 2009. This lifted him to an Elo rating of 2801. This made him second in the world. He is the fifth player to have a rating over 2800. He was 18 years old when he got this rating. This made him the youngest person to have a rating above 2800. On 1 January 2010, the new FIDE rating list was published. He was 19 years and 32 days old when he became the youngest chess player in history to be ranked world number one. He broke the previous record held by Vladimir Kramnik.[6][7] In London, March 2013, Carlsen won the 2013 Candidates tournament and qualified to challenge Anand for the World Chess Championship. Carlsen has won the World Championship matches in 2014, 2016, 2018 and 2021. In 2023, Magnus announced, that he would not take part in World chess Championship 2023. Ding Liren won. The coming of chess databases and strong chess-playing engines makes it difficult to compare his achievements with previous world champions. However, he is thought to be one of the best.[8] In 2024, he won a set of matches against Hans Niemann.[9] A lawsuit against Carlsen, was rejected (2023) by the U.S. federal court system. Hans Niemann was the plaintiff.[10] When Carlsen became the fourth-best player in the world he reached an agreement with a public relations (PR) expert in early 2009. This arrangement has borne fruit. Carlsen now has two sponsors, each of which provides 100,000 Euros a year. One is a stockbroker, the other a law firm. With this money, Carlsen is able to travel, and spend time on training. His coach is Garry Kasparov, a former World chess champion.[11] In return for the sponsorship, Carlsen wears the names of the sponsors on his jackets. This is called 'logo exposure'. He attends meetings, and gives talks. His image helps the companies to hire 'high achievers' to their staff. Put simply, companies of that type are keen to hire intelligent people. Carlsen's overall business manager is his father, Henrik.[11] Norway held the 2014 Chess Olympiad, and the Norwegian Government gave 70 million kroner (~8.5 million euros) in support of the event.[11]",

                "content": "The TCU Horned Frogs football team represents Texas Christian University (TCU) in college football at the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS). The Horned Frogs play their home games in Amon G. Carter Stadium, which is located on the TCU campus in Fort Worth. TCU began playing football in 1896 and has been a member of the Big 12 Conference since 2012. The Horned Frogs claim national championships in 1935 and 1938, when they were led by Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterback Sammy Baugh and Heisman Trophy winner Davey O'Brien, respectively. TCU has had six other Heisman finalists. In addition to Baugh and O'Brien, TCU has had six other former players inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. Following decades of futility during the late 20th century, TCU returned to national prominence under head coach Dennis Franchione (1998-2000). Franchione led the Horned Frogs to their first bowl game win and AP poll finish since the 1950s. TCU enjoyed further success under Franchione's successor, Gary Patterson (2001-2021). Patterson led the Horned Frogs to ten seasons of 11 or more wins, including a perfect 2010 season, six AP top 10 finishes. Sonny Dykes would replace Patterson in 2022 and lead TCU to their first College Football Playoff berth. They defeated Michigan in the Fiesta Bowl semifinal and advanced to the national championship, where they lost to Georgia. TCU ranks 4th all time in final AP poll points among private schools, behind Notre Dame, USC, and Miami-FL.[6] The Horned Frogs are also one of only four FBS teams to have played in all six College Football Playoff Bowls, winning all but the Orange.[7] TCU's first year of football started on December 7, 1896, when it went by the name AddRan Christian University until 1902. TCU won its first game ever played by beating Toby's Business College to the score of 8–6, without having to use any substitutes. TCU finished the 1896 season with a record of 1–1–1, before improving to 3–1 the following year. During this time, the university was located in Waco, Texas, until they returned to Fort Worth in 1910 where the school was founded. Prior to joining the Southwest Conference in 1923, TCU amassed a record of 165–15–0. In 1912, TCU went 8–1–0 and scored 230 points while only allowing 53 points the whole season. In 1920, TCU won its first conference title as a member of the Texas Intercollegiate Athletic Association (TIAA). The Horned Frogs' 9–1–0 record earned them a spot in the Fort Worth Classic, also known as the Dixie Bowl, against Centre College. Although the game was played in Fort Worth, Centre won the game 63–7.[8] In 1923, during TCU's first year in the SWC, it earned a 2–1–0 conference record and a 5–4–0 overall record. One loss that year was a 40–21 decision against TCU's emerging rival, the SMU Mustangs, who went 9–0 en route to a conference championship.[9] The next year, TCU finished second place in the conference with a 5–1 SWC record and another 5–2 overall record.[10] After two great seasons, the Horned Frogs righted the ship. Prior to 1923 TCU had had a revolving door of coaches, with no one coaching the football team for more than two years. Following entrance to the SWC, the school established a high degree of stability, employing just four coaches over the next 43 years, and would not hit last place again until 1953.[8] Under those four coaches (Bell, Schmidt, Meyer, and Martin), the Frogs accumulated a record of 262–165–30. Matty Bell, who began coaching the Frogs in 1923, had his best year in 1928, his last year as coach. That year's only losses came at home 7–6 to the Baylor Bears and to Texas by a score of 6–0. That year the Frogs finished in second place in the conference at 8–2–0 overall and 3–2 in conference play.[11] The 1929 season saw the arrival of Coach Francis Schmidt and TCU's first SWC title. The title was won in the last game of the year on November 30, 1929, against SMU. Coming into the game TCU led SMU in the conference standings. TCU had 4 wins, while SMU's conference record was 3–0–1. Since this was the last conference game of the year for both teams, TCU could win its first SWC title with a win or a tie. The first half of the game was scoreless, but in the third quarter Weldon \"Speedy\" Mason tacked on 40 yards to a 16-yard pass from SMU quarterback Bob Gilbert. After the extra point, the Mustangs led 7–0. TCU would not score until its second time on the SMU 1-yard line in the fourth quarter. That is when TCU quarterback Howard Grubbs ran behind All-SWC fullback Harlos Green and Mike Brumbelow for the game-tying score. The Frogs left plenty of time on the clock for SMU to answer their score, but Grubbs, now playing defense, intercepted Gilbert's pass. TCU then ran the clock out to force the tie and to win its first SWC title.[12] 1935 began the first year for TCU coach Dutch Meyer. That year TCU and SMU again met to decide not only the SWC title but the first trip to the Rose Bowl for a team from the SWC. Grantland Rice of the New York Sun called it the \"Game of the Century\" and reported the following: In a TCU Stadium that seated 30,000 spectators, over 36,000 wildly excited Texans and visitors from every corner of the map packed, jammed, and fought their way into every square foot of standing and seating space to see one of the greatest football games ever played…this tense, keyed up crowd even leaped the wire fences from the top of automobiles...[13] SMU scored the first 14 points of the game. TCU, led by All-American quarterback Sammy Baugh, tied the game at the beginning of the fourth quarter. Then, with seven minutes left in the game SMU, on a 4th and 4 on the Frogs' 37 yard-line, lined up to punt. Quarterback Bob Finley threw a 50-yard pass to running back Bobby Wilson who made what is described as a \"jumping, twisting catch that swept him over the line for the touchdown.\"[13] TCU would lose the game 20–14, but would be invited to play the LSU Tigers in the 1936 Sugar Bowl, where the Frogs would be victorious 3–2 at messy and muddy Tulane Stadium.[14] Even with the loss to SMU, who later lost to Stanford in the 1936 Rose Bowl, TCU claims 1935 as a national championship year. Dan Jenkins states that one of the first statistical national polls was created by Frank G. Dickinson in 1924. By 1935 there were several other polls, and \"…only one of them was big and caught on big and rivaled Dickinson. This was the Paul O. Williamson System out of New Orleans. It quickly gained nation-wide respect and a large syndicated circulation.\"[15] The Williamson System awarded TCU a shared championship with LSU in 1935, the year before the first sportswriter poll by the Associated Press. The Dickinson poll awarded SMU the national title, and several smaller polls designated the University of Minnesota and Princeton University as their champions[16] Meyer led TCU to a win in the inaugural Cotton Bowl Classic in 1937. A year later, TCU would go undefeated in 1938 behind TCU's only Heisman Trophy winner—quarterback Davey O'Brien. That year the Frogs' closest game came against the University of Arkansas where they beat the Razorbacks 21–14 in Fort Worth. They were invited to the 1939 Sugar Bowl and beat the Carnegie Tech Tartans from Pittsburgh by a score of 15–7 in front of more than 50,000 spectators.[17] Meyer coached TCU from 1934 to 1952, compiling a record of 109–79–13.[18] He also won seven Southwest Conference titles. During Meyer's tenure, TCU played in the first nationally televised regular season game against Kansas. When Dutch Meyer retired, his backfield assistant, Abe Martin, became head coach at TCU. One of his three tries at a SWC title came in 1958. The Frogs only losses were to Iowa by a score of 0–17 and at No. 18 SMU, 13–20.[19] The 1958 season ended in a scoreless tie against the Air Force Falcons in the 1959 Cotton Bowl Classic. Martin-led TCU teams amassed a 1–3–1 record in bowl games. The lone win came in the 1957 Cotton Bowl Classic against a Jim Brown-led Syracuse team in front of 68,000 spectators.[20] A blocked extra-point attempt was the difference in the game and allowed the Horned Frogs to win 28–27.[21] After TCU won the 1959 SWC championship, the Horned Frogs did not earn another share of the conference title for 20 years. During this time, TCU played the role of the underdog. In 1961, Bill Van Fleet of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram called the Horned Frogs' 6–0 win at then-No. 1 Texas, \"the season's greatest upset of the year.\"[17] In 1965, TCU traveled to El Paso to play in the Sun Bowl against UTEP; the Frogs lost[18] 13–12. The subpar results of Martin's last eight seasons would become the norm for TCU for most of the next quarter century. Martin retired in 1966 to focus on his role as athletic director, and the state of football at TCU declined in the late 1960s and into the 1970s. Coaches Fred Taylor, Jim Pittman, and Billy Tohill showed limited success from 1967 until 1973. Pittman had a .500 (3–3–1) record in his lone season when he succumbed to a sideline heart attack at Baylor in game eight of 1971. The Horned Frogs bottomed out in the second half of the 1970s. Under Coach Jim Shofner (1974–76) the Frogs struggled mightily to a 2–31 record that included a winless 1976 campaign. F.A. Dry's coaching administration commenced in 1977 and reveled in a 2–9 record after the previous poor seasons. In his six seasons, Dry's Frog teams mustered only 12 wins total and no seasons with more than three wins. During the nine year stretch from 1974 to 1982, TCU won just 14 games overall while losing 82 (and tying three), one of the worst showings for any Division I(-A) team during this period. Only Northwestern had a worse record (12-86-1) during this stretch among \"power conference\" teams (at the time, the ACC, Big 8, Big 10, Pac-8/Pac-10, SEC and SWC) and major independents. TCU would have a successful year in 1984 under coach Jim Wacker. That year TCU leaned on All-American running back Kenneth Davis. The squad started the season 8–0 finishing the regular season with three losses. The Frogs got invited to the Bluebonnet Bowl in Houston that year to play the West Virginia Mountaineers, their first bowl appearance in 20 years. The Frogs would lose to the Mountaineers 31–14 and finish with a record of 8–4. TCU wouldn't attend another bowl game until the 1994 Independence Bowl. TCU had very high hopes for 1985. Davis had been a finalist for the Heisman Trophy in 1984, and was one of the early favorites to win it in 1985. However, for all intents and purposes, the Horned Frogs' season ended a few days after the first game when Wacker discovered that several players, including Davis, had been benefiting from a payment plan in violation of NCAA rules. Wacker promptly kicked the players off the team and self-reported the infractions to the NCAA. The Frogs collapsed to a 3–8 record, including a winless SWC slate. In 1986, the NCAA slapped TCU with three years' probation and a ban on postseason play in the 1986 season. The most severe penalty in the long run, however, was a reduction to only 25 scholarships in 1987 and 1988. To this day, Horned Frog fans remain bitter that the NCAA imposed such a severe penalty given that the violations were voluntarily reported.[22] As heavy-handed as this penalty was, the NCAA seriously considered banning the Horned Frogs from bowl games and live television for three years and no new scholarships in 1987 or 1988. However, it praised Wacker for taking swift corrective action once the violations came to light, including kicking the players off the team when he was well aware that it would cripple the team for the upcoming season.[23] As it turned out, the penalties that were imposed were severe enough that TCU would need the rest of the 1980s and most of the 1990s to recover; they would only have three winning seasons from 1985 to 1997. TCU wouldn't have another winning season until 1991 (though coming close in 1987 and 1990). In 1991, the Horned Frogs finished 7–4, their first winning season in eight years. However, blowout losses to Texas and Texas A&M kept them out of a bowl. Following the season, Wacker left for Minnesota. In 1992, TCU hired Pat Sullivan, the 1971 Heisman Trophy winner from Auburn, as head coach.[24] His tenure at TCU was plagued with inconsistency, but he had some success. In 1992, his first year as head coach, Sullivan introduced a new arched TCU logo. This change to the uniforms was part of a broader plan by Sullivan and the school to replace the expectation of losing with a new look and attitude, including returning to a natural grass playing field. Since its introduction the arched TCU has become the preferred and most popular of the school's logos. In 1992 Sullivan's team finished 2–8–1, but one of their victories was a 28–14 triumph over the Texas Longhorns, which was a major accomplishment for the program at that time. The 1993 team continued to show signs of improvement, finishing 4–7. 1994 was Sullivan's best year. In the final game of that season, Sullivan led TCU to a 24–17 victory over Texas Tech before a crowd of 43,000 at Amon G. Carter Stadium. That victory propelled the Frogs to a 7–5 record and a share of the Southwest Conference title. It was the first Southwest Conference title for TCU since 1959. Invited to the Independence Bowl in Shreveport, Louisiana, the Frogs lost, 20–10, to the Virginia Cavaliers. After 1994, the team regressed: the Frogs went 6–5 in 1995, the last year of the Southwest Conference. TCU struggled even more during Sullivan's final two seasons, when the team competed in the Western Athletic Conference. They finished 4–7 in 1996, and a disastrous 1–10 campaign in 1997 led to Sullivan's mid-season resignation; the lone win was in the season finale over SMU for the Iron Skillet.[25] One of Coach Sullivan's greatest contributions to TCU was the recruitment of future NFL star running back LaDainian Tomlinson to Fort Worth. Franchione inherited a program that had posted a very poor .323 winning percentage from 1966 to 1997.[26] However, he immediately turned the program around. Under Dennis Franchione, and with the stellar play of backs Tomlinson and Basil Mitchell, a 6–5 TCU defeated the USC Trojans in the 1998 Sun Bowl. The high point of the Franchione era was a 10–1 regular season record, a Mobile Alabama Bowl berth vs. Southern Miss and a season-ending No. 13 AP national ranking in 2000. In the three years Coach Franchione coached TCU, his bowl record was 2–0 and he accumulated three WAC Championships. Franchione coached the entire 2000 regular season, but left for the head coaching position at the University of Alabama prior to the 2000 Mobile Alabama Bowl.[27] Defensive Coordinator Gary Patterson took over as head coach for the bowl game in 2000, a 28–21 loss to Southern Miss. In 2001 TCU left the WAC for Conference USA (C-USA). TCU would stay in C-USA for only four years before accepting an invitation to join the Mountain West Conference (MWC). Patterson led the Horned Frogs to six conference championships. In 2002, TCU shared the C-USA title with Cincinnati. In 2005, TCU won the MWC title their first year in the league, and the Frogs claimed additional conference crowns in 2009, 2010, and 2011, and Patterson has had a winning season every year except for 2004, 2013, and 2016, and TCU has gone to a bowl game every year except 2004 and 2013. In the 2005 Houston Bowl, played at Reliant Stadium in Houston, Texas, the Horned Frogs defeated the Iowa State Cyclones by a score of 27–24. In the 2006 Poinsettia Bowl TCU defeated the Northern Illinois Huskies 37–7. In 2007, the Horned Frogs returned to play in the 2007 Texas Bowl, a revival of the old Houston Bowl, and defeated the Houston Cougars, 20–13. In a return to the Poinsettia Bowl in 2008, the No. 11 Frogs defeated unbeaten No. 9 Boise State 17–16. Boise State was the second-to-last unbeaten team in the nation in 2008 besides the Utah Utes. TCU's Poinsettia Bowl victory helped them finish the 2008 season ranked No. 7 in the country. In 2009, TCU again attained national prominence with its second undefeated regular season (12–0) and first since Dutch Meyer led the Frogs to perfection in 1938. They lost in the 2010 Tostitos Fiesta Bowl 17–10 to the Boise State Broncos, on January 4, 2010—their first major-bowl appearance since the 1959 Cotton Bowl. In the following year, the Horned Frogs capped their second consecutive perfect regular season with a win in their first Rose Bowl, a 21–19 victory over Big Ten co-champion Wisconsin on New Year's Day, 2011. This capped off only the second undefeated and untied season in school history. After going 11–2 and winning the Mountain West title again in 2011, the Horned Frogs played Louisiana Tech in the Poinsettia Bowl. TCU won 31–24 in a somewhat lackluster performance after narrowly (and somewhat controversially) missing their third BCS Bowl bid in a row. TCU finished 16th in the final BCS rankings, two slots below the cutoff for a non-AQ team to get a BCS bid. The win allowed Patterson to tie Meyer as the winningest coach in TCU history. On October 10, 2011, the TCU Board of Trustees approved an invitation to join the Big 12 Conference, and entered that conference on July 1, 2012. The move to the Big 12 was a return \"home\" in a sense for the Horned Frogs, as they renewed many of their in-state rivalries from the old Southwest Conference. Before the move to the Big 12, the Horned Frogs had been reckoned as one of the closest things to a major football power in a mid-major conference. Amon G. Carter Stadium, the Horned Frogs' home field since 1929, concluded large renovations prior to the 2012 season. It featured a new press box, suites, club seats and improved fan amenities in many areas—new and more comfortable seating, wider concourses, new and improved restrooms and concessions areas, handicapped-accessible accommodations, elevators and escalators to move patrons among levels, and new lighting. The stadium was used during the 2011 season while being renovated.[28] The Horned Frogs played their first game in the renovated stadium on September 8, 2012, and routed Grambling 56–0. The win was also Patterson's 110th win with the Horned Frogs, making him the winningest coach in TCU history. TCU would finish their first regular season in the Big 12 at 7–5 before losing to Michigan State in the Buffalo Wild Wings Bowl 17–16. The Horned Frogs returned to national prominence in 2014, after they finished the 2013 season with a disappointing 4–8 record. The Horned Frogs started with a 4–0 record to begin the year, with wins over Samford, SMU, No. 24-ranked Minnesota which would finish the season unranked, and rallying in the 4th quarter to beat No. 4-ranked Oklahoma, which would also finish the season unranked. After the upset of Oklahoma, the Horned Frogs rose to the No. 9 ranking going into their October 11 meeting with then No. 7-ranked Baylor. With approximately 11 minutes remaining in the game and despite Baylor leading in every offensive statistical category, TCU had a commanding 58–37 lead over the Bears. Baylor then dominated TCU by scoring 24 unanswered points in the fourth quarter to defeat the Horned Frogs 61–58. Baylor would finish the game with 782 yards of offense and 39 first downs compared to TCU's 485 yards of offense and 23 first downs.[29] The Baylor game would be the lone loss for TCU in 2014, and despite having to rally against Big 12 bottom-dweller Kansas, they would win their remaining seven games behind the leadership of their Heisman Trophy finalist quarterback, Trevone Boykin. The Horned Frogs began to emerge as a National Championship contender after their convincing 41–20 win over then No. 7-ranked Kansas State. Despite their struggles against last-place Kansas and Oklahoma and their loss to Baylor, going into the final week of the regular season, TCU was ranked No. 3 in the newly formed College Football Playoff poll, which coincided with the new College Football Playoff system, whose format selects the Top 4 teams in the rankings at the end of the season to participate in a four-team playoff system to decide a National Champion. TCU soundly defeated Iowa State in their final regular season game to finish the 2014 season with an 11–1 record. On December 7, 2014, the final College Football Playoff rankings were released, and the Horned Frogs dropped to the No. 6 ranking in the poll, abruptly ending the Horned Frogs' National Championship hopes. TCU decimated No. 9 Ole Miss 42–3 in the Peach Bowl.[30] Patterson resigned under pressure as TCU head coach on October 21, 2021.[31] Assistant coach Jerry Kill finished out the season as the team's interim head coach.[32] On November 26, 2021, SMU head coach Sonny Dykes left to take over the rival TCU football program as head coach.[33] Dykes also has head coaching experience at Louisiana Tech and California and signed a six-year contract with the Horned Frogs.[34] In his first season, Dykes went 12–0 before losing to Kansas State in the Big 12 Championship Game. The Horned Frogs finished 12–1 and ranked 3rd in the College Football Playoff rankings.[35] They beat the Michigan Wolverines in the college football semi-final on December 31, 2022, 51–45. They played the Georgia Bulldogs in the College Football Playoff National Championship on January 9, 2023, with the Bulldogs coming out victorious 65–7 to win their second title in a row. Sources:[36] TCU claims two national championships in college football, for 1935 and 1938. Both years, in addition to an un-claimed title in 2010, were awarded by contemporary NCAA-designated \"major selectors\" of national championships.[37]: 112–115 In 1935, TCU spent most of the season ranked No. 1 in the country before losing a regular season game to then No. 2 ranked SMU in the \"Game of the Century.\" SMU went on to lose to Stanford in the Rose Bowl, while TCU went on to beat LSU in the Sugar Bowl. TCU recognizes a statistical poll created by Paul O. Williamson who ranked TCU first in his final post-bowl rankings for the 1935 season.[38] The 1938 team was undefeated and was the No. 1 team in the Associated Press Poll. The 2010 team topped the Congrove Computer Rankings, though the school does not claim this title.[39][40][41] The Horned Frogs have also been awarded retroactive titles by AFCA through their Blue Ribbon Commission.[42] TCU has won a combined 18 conference championships in six different conferences, with 12 outright and six shared. † Co-champions ‡ Note that the 1920 TIAA Championship was disputed between TCU and Austin College. Although TCU defeated the Kangaroos 9–7 on October 9, 1920, one of the TCU players, Allen Rowson, was declared ineligible after the 1920 season due to transfer rules. In 2014, TCU became just the fourth program in history to have competed in all six of the modern day CFP bowls (Rose, Fiesta, Sugar, Cotton, Peach and Orange). TCU joined Florida State, Miami (FL) and Tennessee as the only schools to have earned this distinction. TCU has a combined 6–5–1 record in those bowls, notching wins in all but the Orange. † New Year's Six bowl game TCU has had 27 head coaches since 1897.[43] Because TCU was a member of the Southwest Conference for 72 years, rivalries remain with many of the schools that once participated in that conference. Most of the former Southwest Conference members are located within the state of Texas. This rivalry with SMU is prominent for both schools, as both are located in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex and were long-time members of the SWC before its dissolution. The SMU–TCU football game is called \"The Battle for the Iron Skillet\", with the winning team gaining possession of a ceremonial iron skillet. Since 1915, when SMU was founded and began football competition, the game has not been played in only four years when both fielded football teams—1919, 1920, 2006 and 2020. The schools are scheduled to compete through at least 2023. Because they are no longer members of the same conference, annual meetings may or may not be scheduled after 2023.[44] TCU leads the series 53–43–7 through the 2024 season.[45] The TCU-Baylor rivalry is one of the most-played rivalry games in college football. At its inception, the rivalry was a battle of two cross-town, church affiliated rivals in Waco, Texas. When the main administration building at TCU was destroyed by fire in 1910, Baylor generously offered the use of its classrooms, libraries, and laboratories to the displaced TCU students. TCU eventually relocated to Fort Worth, Texas, but the rivalry between the two private universities continued. Appropriately, given the more than century-long history of this highly-competitive rivalry, the first game between TCU and Baylor, played October 27, 1899, ended in a scoreless tie. Each school achieved various period of dominance between 1899 and the breakup of the Southwest Conference at the conclusion of the 1995 season, but at the time the Southwest Conference disbanded, the Bears held only a slight 49–47–7 advantage. After a 10-year, post-Southwest Conference breakup hiatus, the series was renewed for 4 non-conference games in 2006, 2007, 2010 and 2011. TCU, then a member of the Mountain West Conference, notched a 3–1 non-conference record over Baylor in these games. TCU leads the series 59–54–7 through the 2024 season.[46] Texas leads the series with TCU 65–28-1 through the 2024 season.[47] The football series with Texas Tech dates to 1926. TCU was the first Southwest Conference team to play Texas Tech. The Texas Tech University Goin' Band from Raiderland was the first college marching band to travel to an away game when Will Rogers financed their trip to accompany the Red Raiders to Fort Worth.[48] After the collapse of the Southwest Conference, Texas Tech was the first of the schools that joined the Big 12 Conference in 1996 to schedule a non-conference game with TCU. This first post-Southwest Conference game between TCU and its former conference mate was played in the regular season in 2004. Prior to Texas Tech joining the SWC, a traveling trophy was exchanged between the Horned Frogs and Red Raiders. The trophy was of a miniature saddle and the game between the teams was dubbed \"The West Texas Championship.\"[49] TCU and Texas Tech return to being conference mates, competing in football annually, in 2012. In 2014, 109 points combined was put up, in an 82–27 rout by TCU. Texas Tech leads the series 33–31–3 through the 2024 season.[50] The Horned Frogs have played their home football games at Amon G. Carter Stadium, located on the campus of TCU, since 1930. Named for the famous Fort Worth newspaper magnate who made the original donation to finance the stadium, Amon G. Carter Stadium opened in 1930 with an original seating capacity of 22,000. The first game played in the stadium was in October, a 70–6 TCU victory over the Arkansas Razorbacks. Renovations in 1947 and 1955 added additional seating and an upper deck, which increased capacity to 46,083. In 1991, the upper deck seats were replaced by aluminum bleachers, which reduced its capacity to 44,008, and the artificial turf was replaced by natural grass at the request of the new coaching staff. The stadium remained in this configuration until 2010, when a major renovation reduced the entire stadium to its original lower bowl, before erecting a new stadium on the same site. The design of the current Amon Carter stadium was influenced heavily by the surrounding architecture of Fort Worth, with emphasis on Art Deco style. The Frogs opened the new stadium in time for the 2012 season. The new Amon G. Carter Stadium features a natural grass field and a seating capacity of 45,000. Standing-room only concourses allow capacity to exceed this number when ticket demand exceeds seating availability. The record attendance is 50,307 which took place on November 14, 2009, when the Frogs played the then No. 16 ranked Utah Utes. The final score was 55–28 in favor of the Frogs. The 2012 renovation added a 54 ft. video board over the North endzone, with a smaller videoboard located in the Southeast corner. Before Amon G. Carter Stadium, the Horned Frogs played their home games on campus at Clark Field, located at the current site of Mary Couts Burnett Library. TCU's school colors are purple and white. Historically, black has also featured prominently in the school's uniforms. As early as 1935 the football team wore black leather helmets with a purple stripe, or occasionally purple helmets with a black stripe. Jerseys were purple with white numbers were, worn with beige or khaki pants. Beginning with the introduction of plastic helmets in the 1946 TCU dropped black from their uniforms and introduced a new purple helmet with a white stripe. The team's pants remained khaki colored until the 1950s, when they were changed to white. During this period the exact shade of TCU purple varied wildly depending on the uniforms worn, though a royal purple was most common. In 1971 the school hired Jim Pittman as its head coach. Pittman had been an assistant at the University of Texas when the Longhorns had changed their color from orange to burnt orange, and wanted to do something similar at TCU. Pittman chose to introduce a very pale shade of lilac into the TCU uniforms, and the team quickly became known as the \"Lavender Hill Mob.\" These uniforms are often regarded as the worst in TCU's history. TCU returned to a royal purple in 1974 following Pittman's death on the sidelines. Beginning in 1998, TCU began once again incorporating black into the uniforms. The practice was started by Coach Franchione, who introduced a new helmet with black facemask, and purple jerseys with black pants. In 2012, the school debuted helmets which featured a black stripe in addition to the black facemask, reflecting the helmets worn during the TCU championship years of the 1930s. Several TCU helmets designs also feature a small red \"blood stripe\" in the middle of the central black stripe, a reference to how horned frogs can squirt blood from their eyes/forehead onto potential predators. TCU was the last school in college football to wear leather helmets, switching to hard plastic helmets in 1946. Prior to 1946, the TCU football team wore either black helmets with a purple stripe or purple helmets with a black stripe. Since the introduction of plastic, the TCU helmet has gone through a number of design changes. In the 1950s, TCU wore a purple helmet with a white stripe down the middle. In 1954, a gray facemask was introduced, and in 1958, white numbers were added to the sides of the helmet. In 1965, a new helmet was introduced featuring a purple shell and a white stylized Horned Frog on the side. A different, fiercer Horned Frog design was used for the 1966 helmets, featuring just the frog's head. In 1967, the school used a pattern similar to that of Texas A&M. In 1977, the school introduced a \"Flying TCU\" logo, which remained on the helmets through the 1991 season. In 1992, new head coach Pat Sullivan introduced an arched TCU design, which eventually became the official logo of the school. This logo has been featured on most TCU helmets, sometimes with a white or gray horned frog underneath, ever since.

With fewer than two weeks left in the regular season, here's an updated look at who would be in, who would be out, and where all the potential postseason teams would be seeded going into Week 17 POWER RANKINGS: Lions, Vikings, Rams rise; Eagles, Steelers, Broncos fall for Week 17 1. Kansas City Chiefs 15-1 (champions, AFC West): The Chiefs clinched the top seed, home-field advantage, and only bye in the AFC playoffs with their win over the Steelers on Christmas. 2. Buffalo Bills 12-3 (champions, AFC East): The Bills can't be the top seed anymore after the Chiefs clinched and will look to keep this position ahead of the Ravens after losing the head-to-head tiebreaker earlier in the season. 3. Baltimore Ravens 11-5 (first place, AFC North): The Ravens, who had already clinched a playoff berth, took first place back in the AFC North from the Steelers by a full game after winning at Houston while Pittsburgh lost to Kansas City on Christmas. 4. Houston Texans 9-7 (champions, AFC South). The Texans are locked into the No. 4 seed with their loss against the Ravens, and now it's looking like they will have a tough playoff opener vs. the Steelers. 3. Pittsburgh Steelers 10-6 (second place, AFC North): The Steelers, who have clinched a playoff spot, now need to win in Week 18 over the Bengals and a Ravens loss to the Browns to win the division. 6. Los Angeles Chargers 9-6 (second place, AFC West): The Chargers can clinch a wild-card playoff spot behind the Chiefs with either a win over the Patriots or losses by both the Dolphins and Colts. 7. Denver Broncos 9-6 (third place, AFC West): The Broncos also can clinch a wild-card spot with a win over the Bengals on Saturday. Who's in the hunt? The Colts, Dolphins, and Bengals all need to win to stay in the wild-card race after Week 17, but all three teams would be eliminated if the Chargers win and the Broncos beat the Bengals. Who's out? SN's NFL HQ: Live NFL scores | Updated NFL standings | Full NFL schedule 1. Detroit Lions 13-2 (first place, NFC North): The Lions have clinched a playoff berth. They can lock up a second straight division title with a win over the 49ers and a Vikings loss to the Packers in Week 17. 2. Philadelphia Eagles 12-3 (first place, NFC East): The Eagles have clinched a playoff spot and will clinch the division title with a win over the Cowboys or a Commanders loss to the Falcons. 3. Los Angeles Rams 9-6 (first place, NFC West) (first place, NFC West): The Rams can still win the division with a home win over the Cardinals despite the Seahawks winning, but it requires four of the Bengals, Commanders, Bills, Vikings, 49ers, and Browns to win to give them the strength of schedule tiebreaker. 4. Atlanta Falcons 8-7 (first place, NFC South): The Falcons would clinch the division with a win over the Commanders coupled with a Buccaneers' loss to the Panthers. 5. Minnesota Vikings 13-2 (second place, NFC North): The Vikings will try to make the division title come down to the final week with a win over the Packers. 6. Green Bay Packers 11-4 (third place, NFC North): The Packers have joined the Lions, Eagles, and Vikings in clinching at least a wild-card playoff berth going into a big divisional game against Minnesota. 7. Washington Commanders 10-5 (second place, NFC East): The Commanders would clinch a playoff berth with a win over the Falcons or a Buccaneers loss to the Panthers. Who's in the hunt? The Seahawks can only get into the playoffs as division champions and need a lot of help beyond the Rams losing. The Buccaneers will have to root for Washington over Atlanta if they beat Carolina earlier in the day. Who's out?

Cincinnati beat Denver 30-24 on a walk-off touchdown from Tee Higgins, the third time in the matchup that Joe Burrow found his star receiver in the end zone. The Broncos' rookie quarterback, Bo Nix, also put on a show with three touchdown passes, but his squad came up just short in its attempt to lock down a playoff spot. Now, the Bengals and Broncos will officially be among up to four AFC teams still alive for the conference's final available playoff spot next week. Here's a closer look at how Cincinnati's dramatic Week 17 win over Denver impacted the AFC wild-card race, including the playoff scenarios for both the Bengals and Broncos. MORE NFL WEEK 17: *Clinched a playoff berth Depending on which team wins the AFC North, either the Steelers or Ravens will be one of the AFC wild-card teams, and the Chargers also secured a spot with their win over the Patriots on Saturday. There's only one AFC playoff spot still open, which is currently held by Denver. There's a lot to be decided within the AFC wild-card picture between the final stages of Week 17 and the entirety of Week 18. With the Broncos' loss to the Bengals, four teams are still alive for the No. 7 seed: Denver, Cincinnati, Indianapolis and Miami. The Broncos could have secured the last playoff spot with a win or tie against the Bengals. The Colts and Dolphins have yet to play in Week 17. Each team would be eliminated from the playoff picture if they lose in their respective matchups, but if they win, they'll also have a shot at the seventh seed in Week 18. As things stand, the Broncos still have the most direct path to the conference's final playoff spot: with a win or tie against Kansas City in Week 18, they make the playoffs. If Denver loses next week, though, things will get much more interesting. In that scenario, any team that also finishes with a 9-8 record between Cincinnati, Indianapolis and Miami would be tied in record for the No. 7 seed. Tiebreakers could play a vital role in the AFC's final playoff spot. Right now, the Bengals have the head-to-head tiebreaker over the Broncos. The Broncos have the head-to-head tiebreaker over the Colts. And the Colts have the head-to-head tiebreaker over the Dolphins. There are no remaining meetings between the four squads vying for the No. 7 seed. NFL DRAFT NEWS: Denver had a shot to clinch its first playoff berth since 2015 with a win or tie against the Bengals on Saturday. That didn't happen, but the Broncos still control their own destiny to the postseason. With a win or tie against the Chiefs in Week 18, the Broncos will claim the AFC's seventh seed. If Denver loses, it could still make the playoffs but would then need help, either through losses from the group of Cincinnati/Indianapolis/Miami, or through tiebreaker scenarios. NFL HQ: Live NFL scores | Updated NFL standings | Full NFL schedule Cincinnati kept its playoff hopes alive with its win over Denver on Saturday, but the Bengals still need help to reach the postseason. In order to clinch a playoff spot, the Bengals will first have to beat the Steelers in Week 18, also needing Denver to lose to Kansas City. If those two things happen, Cincinnati would automatically claim a higher seed than Denver thanks to Saturday's head-to-head victory. But due to tiebreaker scenarios, the Bengals also need both Indianapolis (at Giants, vs. Jaguars) and Miami (at Browns, at Jets) to lose one of their last two games in order to clinch the AFC's seventh seed.

The Los Angeles Chargers wrapped up their playoff berth with a victory over the New England Patriots, but the final playoff spot will be up for grabs heading into the season's final week. The Cincinnati Bengals remained alive in the playoff race with their thrilling overtime win over the Denver Broncos, keeping the Indianapolis Colts and Miami Dolphins alive in the playoff race as well. Denver can still clinch a playoff berth with a victory in Week 18. Christmas Day games also had major playoff implications around the NFL. The Kansas City Chiefs needed just one victory to lock up home-field advantage in the AFC, and they earned it by defeating the Pittsburgh Steelers in the opener of the Christmas Day doubleheader. The Steelers lost the AFC North lead, as the Baltimore Ravens took over first place in the division with their blowout victory over the Houston Texans. Baltimore is one win away from clinching the AFC North.

Kansas City gets the lone bye in the conference and can rest its starters in Week 18. Remaining schedule: at Broncos The Bills needed the Chiefs to lose out to still have a shot at the No. 1 seed. That didn't happen, so the Bills need a win in their final two games to lock up the No. 2 seed. Remaining schedule: vs. Jets, at Patriots The Ravens have taken over the AFC North lead with their win and the Steelers' loss, having a one-game lead over Pittsburgh heading into the final week. A win or a Steelers loss in Week 18 gives Baltimore the division. Remaining schedule: vs. Browns The Texans have already clinched the AFC South. They will be the No. 4 seed in the AFC and will have a home game in the wild-card round of the playoffs. Remaining schedule: at Titans The Steelers lose the AFC North lead after falling to the Chiefs. They need a win and a Ravens loss in the final week to win the division. They hold the tiebreaker over the Chargers for the No. 5 seed due beating Los Angeles in Week 3. Remaining schedule: vs. Bengals The Chargers clinched a playoff berth their win over the Patriots. Remaining schedule: at Raiders The Broncos are a win away from clinching a playoff spot, even with their overtime loss to the Bengals. They need to win in Week 18 to clinch a playoff spot. Remaining schedule: vs. Chiefs The Bengals remain alive in the AFC playoff race, thanks to their overtime win over the Broncos. They will make the playoffs if they win in Week 18 and the Broncos lose along with Miami and Indianapolis losing one of their final two games. Remaining schedule: at Steelers The Colts are 1.5 games out of the final wild-card spot in the AFC, but are eliminated from playoff contention with a loss in one of their final two games. The Colts have the head-to-head tiebreaker over the Dolphins for the No. 9 seed by virtue of their Week 7 victory. Remaining schedule: at Giants, vs. Jaguars The Dolphins' AFC playoff hopes are still alive, but Miami will be eliminated with a loss in one of its final two games. Miami is 1.5 games behind Denver for the final playoff spot. Remaining schedule: at Browns, at Jets Six teams are eliminated from the playoff race in the AFC: Raiders, Patriots, Titans, Jets, Jaguars and Browns. x - Lions 13 2 0 .867 Falcons 8 7 0 .533 x -- clinched playoff berth e -- eliminated from playoffs The Lions remain the No. 1 seed in the conference.

Remaining schedule: at 49ers, vs. Vikings The Eagles remain in the hunt for home-field advantage, but need the Lions to lose out, the Vikings to lose next week and for Minnesota to beat Detroit in Week 18. Philadelphia can clinch the NFC East and the No. 2 seed with a win in one of its final two games. Remaining schedule: vs. Cowboys, vs. Giants The Rams lead the NFC West by a game over the Seahawks with two to play. Los Angeles clinches the division next week with a win and a Seattle loss. Remaining schedule: vs. Cardinals, vs. Seahawks The Falcons lead the NFC South and can clinch the division with a win and Buccaneers loss. Atlanta holds the head-to-head tiebreaker over Tampa Bay and control its own destiny in the division. Remaining schedule: at Commanders, vs. Panthers Minnesota remains the top wild-card team in the conference and is tied with Detroit for first place in the NFC North. Detroit still has the division lead via the head-to-head tiebreaker. Remaining schedule: vs. Packers, at Lions The Packers clinched a playoff berth and are currently the No. 6 seed in the NFC. Remaining schedule: at Vikings, vs. Bears The Commanders lead the Buccaneers and Seahawks by two games for the final playoff spot in the conference. They clinch a playoff berth with a win next week (or a Buccaneers loss). Remaining schedule: vs. Falcons, at Cowboys The Seahawks are 1.5 games back of the Commanders for the final wild-card spot after their win over the Bears. They are also 0.5 game back for the NFC West lead, but the Rams hold the head-to-head tiebreaker. A Rams win Saturday doesn't eliminate the Seahawks from the NFC West, but there is an intriguing playoff scenario in Week 17 which Seattle could lose the division. Remaining schedule: at Rams The Buccaneers dropped from NFC South leaders to out of the playoff picture. They need to finish with a better record than the Falcons to win the division since they lost both games to Atlanta. A loss this week also wraps up a playoff berth for the Commanders. Remaining schedule: vs. Panthers, vs. Saints The Cardinals, Cowboys, 49ers, Saints, Bears, Panthers and Giants have been eliminated from the playoffs. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive.

                "content": "Every week for the duration of the 2024 NFL regular season, USA TODAY Sports will provide timely updates to the league's ever-evolving playoff picture − typically starting after Sunday afternoon's late games and then moving forward for the remainder of the week (through Monday's and Thursday's games or Saturday's, if applicable.) What just happened? What does it mean? What are the pertinent factors (and, perhaps, tiebreakers) prominently in play as each conference's seven-team bracket begins to crystallize? All will be explained and analyzed up to the point when the postseason field is finalized on Sunday, Jan. 5. Here's where things stand with Week 17 of the 2024 season underway: x – 1. Detroit Lions (13-2), NFC North leaders: Last week, they were in a three-way tie atop the conference and deadlocked for the division lead with Minnesota. But Philadelphia's Week 16 defeat makes it increasingly likely the Lions and Vikings will be playing for all the important regular-season marbles in Week 18. Winning out gives the Lions everything they want, including home-field advantage. So would a win at San Francisco on Monday night combined with a Minnesota loss to Green Bay. Remaining schedule: at 49ers, vs. Vikings NFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more. x – 2. Philadelphia Eagles (12-3), NFC East leaders: They're coming off a rough Sunday. They lost their 10-game winning streak, an opportunity to wrap up the division and fell a game behind Detroit and Minnesota in the race for home-field advantage. Also, concussed QB Jalen Hurts won't play Sunday. But the Eagles are still just one win or Commanders loss from locking up the division and at least the No. 2 seed. Remaining schedule: vs. Cowboys, vs. Giants 3. Los Angeles Rams (9-6), NFC West leaders: Neither they nor the Seahawks have a pathway to a wild-card berth. If both the Rams and Seattle wind up 10-7, the currently undetermined strength-of-victory tiebreaker will come into play, likely in LA's favor – and it could actually allow the Rams to clinch the division Sunday if they first take care of business against Arizona on Saturday. Remaining schedule: vs. Cardinals, vs. Seahawks 4. Atlanta Falcons (8-7), NFC South leaders: Rookie QB Michael Penix Jr. won his starting debut against the lowly Giants. But the real payoff came last Sunday night, when the Bucs – they were swept earlier in the season by Atlanta – lost at Dallas. The Falcons can win the division in Week 17 with another victory and another Tampa Bay loss. Remaining schedule: at Commanders, vs. Panthers x – 5. Minnesota Vikings (13-2), wild card No. 1: Like Detroit, they control their own potentially high-yield fate – win out, and the NFC North and No. 1 seed are Minnesota's. Remaining schedule: vs. Packers, at Lions x – 6. Green Bay Packers (11-4), wild card No. 2: Getting swept by Detroit and losing once already to Minnesota relegated the Pack to wild-card status ... though Monday's whitewash of the Saints was the latest reminder that this might actually be the last NFC North team you want to see in January. But given Packers are guaranteed to open the playoffs on the road, it will be interesting to see how much they play their key starters over the next two weeks given the limited upside to doing so. Remaining schedule: at Vikings, vs. Bears 7. Washington Commanders (10-5), wild card No. 3: Despite beating the Eagles, they didn't quite clinch a postseason berth in Week 16 – but did remain alive in the NFC East while eliminating both the Dallas Cowboys and San Francisco 49ers from the playoff picture. A win in Week 17 puts Washington into the dance. A loss could be highly problematic in the tiebreaker space as it would open an alternate avenue for the Bucs, who beat Washington in Week 1. Remaining schedule: vs. Falcons, at Cowboys 8. Seattle Seahawks (9-7), in the hunt: They're going to need help to win the NFC West after a heartbreaking loss to Minnesota last Sunday. Thursday night's win at Chicago got the Seahawks back on track ... to a degree. Seattle's best-case scenario involves a Rams loss Saturday and then beating them in Week 18. If both teams wind up 10-7, the undetermined strength-of-victory tiebreaker will prove pivotal, likely in LA's favor. The Seahawks can be eliminated this weekend by a Rams win and a loss of the strength-of-victory tiebreaker, which will still be in flux Sunday. Remaining schedule: at Rams 9. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (8-7), in the hunt: The Bucs could see their aspirations to keep the NFC South throne die this weekend. However, if Atlanta beats Washington, then Tampa Bay has a more favorable shot at the NFC's final wild-card slot. Remaining schedule: vs. Panthers, vs. Saints All NFL news on and off the field.

Kansas City Chiefs (15-1), AFC West champions: By crushing Pittsburgh on Christmas Day, they secured home-field advantage and a first-round bye – and really two-plus weeks off in actuality depending on whom they want to play in what's now a meaningless Week 18 contest for the champs. Remaining schedule: at Broncos, BYE y – 2. Buffalo Bills (12-3), AFC East champions: Now out of the running for the No. 1 seed, finishing second in the conference should still have meaning given the road to Super Bowl 59 could go through Western New York if the Chiefs lose their playoff opener. A win would also ensure Buffalo wouldn't have to go on the road for a playoff game unless the AFC championship is staged in Kansas City. Remaining schedule: vs. Jets, at Patriots x – 3. Baltimore Ravens (11-5), AFC North leaders: Catching fire? Probably an understatement. The Steelers' loss before Baltimore's Christmas kickoff vaulted the Ravens atop the division, and their dominant win over Houston keeps them there. A win or tie in Week 18 clinches it. Remaining schedule: vs. Browns y – 4. Houston Texans (9-7), AFC South champions: They rule a weak division for the second straight year, however Wednesday's loss locked them into the fourth seed ... which will likely mean a tough wild-card matchup, albeit in Houston, against an AFC North team. Remaining schedule: at Titans x – 5. Pittsburgh Steelers (10-6), wild card No. 1: That's three losses in a row, Wednesday's flat performance against Kansas City costing them first place in the AFC North. However they can capture the divisional title by winning in Week 18 if Baltimore also loses to Cleveland. Remaining schedule: vs. Bengals x – 6. Los Angeles Chargers (10-6), wild card No. 2: Saturday's rout of the Patriots locked Bolts into the field and ensures Jim Harbaugh has been a playoff participant in four of his five NFL seasons as a head coach. Yet, having lost to the Ravens and Steelers earlier this season, the Chargers will most likely be the sixth seed – and probably head to Baltimore or Pittsburgh for a rematch. Remaining schedule: at Raiders 7. Denver Broncos (9-7), wild card No. 3: They've had win-and-in scenarios in their past two games and lost both times. Still, one more victory – or tie – will advance Denver to the playoffs for the first time since they won Super Bowl 50 with Peyton Manning and Von Miller nearly nine years ago. The Broncos' Week 18 game against Kansas City now means basically nothing to the Chiefs – which could be a real advantage for Denver, which can do no better than the seventh seed at this point. Remaining schedule: vs. Chiefs 8. Cincinnati Bengals (8-8), in the hunt: Still alive thanks to a four-game winning streak, including Saturday's overtime thriller against Denver. Though they appear like the best team outside the postseason field, the Bengals still need the most help to get in, including at least one loss by both the Colts and Dolphins. Cincinnati must also next beat Pittsburgh in Week 18 and hope Denver loses its final regular-season game. Though the Bengals jumped Indy and Miami on Saturday, both hold tiebreakers that would move them past Cincinnati if they continue winning. Remaining schedule: at Steelers 9. Indianapolis Colts (7-8), in the hunt: Technically alive after winning in Week 16 and with a soft schedule on the way out. Their record in AFC games (6-5) is better than Miami's (5-5) and Cincinnati's (5-6). Indianapolis clinches if it winds up in a three- or four-way tie with teams all possessing 9-8 records. A two-way tie with Denver would mean the Broncos advance due to their Week 15 win over the Colts. Remaining schedule: at Giants, vs. Jaguars 10. Miami Dolphins (7-8), in the hunt: Technically alive after winning in Week 16 and with a soft schedule on the way out. They advance if tied with any combination of 9-8 teams that does not include the Colts. Remaining schedule: at Browns, at Jets Detroit clinches NFC North and NFC's No. 1 seed (first-round bye and home-field advantage) with: ▶ Win + Minnesota loss Atlanta clinches NFC South with: ▶ Win + Tampa Bay loss Philadelphia clinches NFC East with: Los Angeles Rams clinch NFC West with: ▶ Win while clinching strength-of-victory tiebreaker over Seattle (Note: Rams clinch strength-of-victory tiebreaker with 2½ or more wins from the following teams: Buffalo, Cleveland, Minnesota, San Francisco and Washington. A tie equates to a half-win in this formula.) Washington clinches playoff berth with: Baltimore clinches AFC North with: ▶ Win or tie Pittsburgh clinches AFC North with: ▶ Win + Baltimore loss Denver clinches playoff berth with: ▶ Win or tie ▶ New York Giants ▶ Las Vegas Raiders ▶ New England Patriots ▶ Jacksonville Jaguars ▶ Tennessee Titans ▶ Cleveland Browns ▶ New York Jets ▶ Chicago Bears ▶ Carolina Panthers ▶ New Orleans Saints ▶ Dallas Cowboys ▶ San Francisco 49ers ▶ Arizona Cardinals x – clinched playoff berth y – clinched division z – clinched home-field advantage, first-round bye *** Follow USA TODAY Sports' Nate Davis on X, formerly Twitter, @ByNateDavis",
