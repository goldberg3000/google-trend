                "content": "by Maddy Myers It’s time for the Game Awards, when the video game industry looks back on 2024’s best games and debuts trailers for upcoming projects for 2025 and beyond. The annual awards show and video game trailer extravaganza hosted by Geoff Keighley celebrates its 10th anniversary this year. Pinned Michael McWhertor The Game Awards celebrates its 10th anniversary in 2024. The annual awards show and video game trailer extravaganza hosted by Geoff Keighley returns on Thursday, Dec. 12 for a night that aims to celebrate the year’s best and biggest games, while giving viewers sneak peeks of games to come. What reveals will be at this year’s Game Awards? We’re guaranteed to get new looks at Mafia: The Old Country, Borderlands 4, Dying Light: The Beast, and the next game from Hazelight Studios (It Takes Two, A Way Out) Beyond that 2025’s calendar is loaded. We could get fresh looks at upcoming releases like Sid Meier’s Civilization 7, Doom: The Dark Ages, Fable, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra, Judas, and South of Midnight. Michael McWhertor Over the past 10 years, The Game Awards has become the go-to awards show for recognizing the best of the best video games, thanks to its splashy presentation, celebrity appearances, and exclusive reveals secured by the show’s host and creator, Geoff Keighley. The Game Awards is also known for its actual awards, though they often take a backseat to the spectacle. That’s not unheard for awards shows, which often focus on entertainment, not on acceptance speeches from the winners themselves. But the awards are still a huge part of The Game Awards, especially for the artists, performers, designers, and producers who are nominated each year. Maddy Myers and Toussaint Egan The Game Awards is simultaneously an awards show and a trailer extravaganza in which game studios and publishers show off their upcoming slates. Some of these trailers are for games that have already been announced; others are what TGA host Geoff Keighley calls “world premieres.” We already know from official announcements about what’s confirmed to show up, but we also have some informed guesses as to what titles and franchises could get trailers, release date reveals, or other updates — plus some far-flung wishes about what should appear. What we know: Mecha Break will get “a special announcement.” Bandai Namco will reveal a new fighter for Tekken 8. Borderlands 4 will get its first actual trailer, along with Mafia: The Old Country. Plus, there’s some sort of update coming on Warframe: 1999. Oli Welsh This year marks the 10th anniversary of The Game Awards, and in that time Geoff Keighley’s annual event has established itself quite firmly as the leading awards ceremony for the game industry — the Oscars of gaming. It remains promotionally overstuffed to the point that it’s still arguably better known for trailers than awards, but that’s changing. And although its winners tend to be pretty conservative, they are broadly representative of the critical consensus. Its voting body is composed of a wide range of international games media, so the chances are your favorite publications’ and critics’ picks factor into The Game Awards. (Polygon’s do.) The top prize of the night is, of course, Game of the Year — and there are clear indicators of what makes a Game of the Year at The Game Awards, based on a decade of data. On Nov. 18, The Game Awards announced the nominees for this and all the other categories, mostly confirming those indicators. Still, it’s a particularly open race in 2024, with no cut-and-dried frontrunner. Below, after crunching numbers and taking temperatures, we pick the likely Game of the Year winner and rank the rest of the six nominees in order of their likeliness to win. We’ll find out if we got it right when the winner is announced at The Game Awards on Dec. 12. Zoë Hannah The Game Awards announced its nominees for Game of the Year 2024 in a livestream Monday. This year’s race for GOTY hasn’t had an obvious frontrunner thus far, making the announcement one of the bigger surprises in the show’s 10-year history. As of today’s announcement, the six nominees for Game of the Year are locked in. There were big surprises, like a resurgence for Black Myth Wukong and a near shutout for Dragon Age: The Veilguard. On the sweet side, there was a strong showing for indies, including Balatro. The best of Polygon in your inbox, every Friday. © 2024 Vox Media, LLC. All Rights Reserved",

                "content": "By James Perkins Mastromarino , A Martínez Co-host A Martinez and NPR gaming editor James Mastromarino discuss the nominees of this year's Game Awards and their significance in gaming culture. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)GEOFF KEIGHLEY: Good evening, everyone, and welcome to the Game Awards.(CHEERING)A MARTÍNEZ, HOST: One of the world's most-watched awards shows is happening tonight. It's the 11th annual Game Awards. Hosted and produced by video game journalist Geoff Keighley. The self-described biggest night in gaming has been getting more popular. More than 100 million people livestreamed the event last year, even as the awards also face criticism and controversy. NPR gaming lead James Mastromarino joins us now to talk about the whole affair. Now, James, before we start, we should acknowledge that NPR is among the more than 130 media organizations who contributed to the Game Awards shortlist. So, James, how does this all work? I mean, some sort of critics' choice?JAMES MASTROMARINO, BYLINE: Yeah, mostly. International media organizations have two voting rounds - one where they nominate games for the shortlist and another where they pick their favorites in each category. So the jury is mostly English-speaking, as you could expect from a U.S.-based show. But there's decent representation across the world, particularly in Asian countries and Brazil. But the most unique thing about the Game Awards is that 10% of the final tally comes from the public, who can vote online. There's even a players' choice category that's entirely based on online votes. So that all lends the Game Awards this kind of populist, carnival-like atmosphere compared to, say, the Oscars.MARTÍNEZ: Ooh, players' choice. That's like when I go to Vegas. It's players' choice all around.MASTROMARINO: (Laughter). Yeah. Yep.MARTÍNEZ: All right. So who are the - some of the favorites to win this year?MASTROMARINO: Yeah, it's been a mixed year for PlayStation commercially, but it's been a great year for them critically. Two PS5 exclusives lead with seven nominations, including game of the year. There's the big-budget role-playing game \"Final Fantasy VII Rebirth.\" It's sort of a remake, sort of a sequel to the beloved RPG from 1997.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) We can handle this. I will reclaim our world.MASTROMARINO: Then, kind of on the flip side, there's this cute 3D platformer, \"Astro Bot,\" which is just pure joy to play. And it feels like PlayStation finally created something to rival the best Mario platformer games.(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"I AM ASTRO BOT\")KENNETH C M YOUNG: (Singing) I am Astro Bot.MASTROMARINO: The other game of the year nominees are the politically charged metaphor, \"ReFantazio,\" \"Black Myth: Wukong\" - an action game inspired by Chinese literature and mythology - and \"Shadow Of The Erdtree,\" the expansion to the 2022 game of the year, \"Elden Ring.\" But then there's also this little indie game, \"Balatro.\" You can think of it as a single-player poker sort of game - all of the pleasure of gambling with none of the risk.MARTÍNEZ: (Laughter).MASTROMARINO: And compared to these other games, \"Balatro\" had an incredibly small budget but has really been blowing up. And it's been playing all of its cards right, and may actually take home the big prize this year.MARTÍNEZ: Now, I understand that this year, some people are a little upset that too many games are eligible for awards.MASTROMARINO: Yeah, so the main thing here is that never before has an expansion - not a full sequel, just an appendage to an existing game - been up for the big game of the year award. That's \"Shadow Of The Erdtree\" - again, the follow-up to the 2022 hit, \"Elden Ring,\" which won game of the year. And some folks think that other games should be allowed to compete in that space and that \"Elden Ring\" already had its time.MARTÍNEZ: Now, it sounds like the awards have been criticized for being too close to the industry for some time. Is it more like a four-hour advertisement more than an awards show like, say, the Oscars?MASTROMARINO: Well, all awards shows exist to promote their respective industries, but the Game Awards is very nakedly a showcase. It debuts exclusive trailers and sells advertisement slots for hundreds of thousands of dollars. It broadcasts out of LA and brings out Hollywood celebrities to announce partnerships with game companies. And host Geoff Keighley rattles off some categories so fast that winners don't have the chance to give acceptance speeches. And even when they do, they often have only about a minute to do so. There are many examples of heartfelt speeches that get cut off before their time. So I'm curious to see if the awards won't be quite as rapid-fire this year.MARTÍNEZ: All right. Now, still, despite those complaints, it sounds like people are tuning in. So what are you going to be watching for?MASTROMARINO: Yeah, so there always are big announcements and surprises. This host, Geoff Keighley, has been indicating that we're going to get some big news. I'm expecting a new trailer for \"Grand Theft Auto VI,\" which is slated to come out next year. We also know we're getting the reveal of the new game from the 2021 game of the year winner, \"It Takes Two.\" They'll show off what they've been cooking up. So there's always room for surprises. And my guess is come tomorrow morning, we will have a completely different set of topics to discuss.MARTÍNEZ: All right. That's NPR gaming lead James Mastromarino. James, for our segment, it is game over.MASTROMARINO: (Laughter) Game over, man. Thanks, A. Copyright © 2024 NPR. All rights reserved.

It debuts exclusive trailers and sells advertisement slots for hundreds of thousands of dollars. It broadcasts out of LA and brings out Hollywood celebrities to announce partnerships with game companies. And host Geoff Keighley rattles off some categories so fast that winners don't have the chance to give acceptance speeches. And even when they do, they often have only about a minute to do so. There are many examples of heartfelt speeches that get cut off before their time. So I'm curious to see if the awards won't be quite as rapid-fire this year.MARTÍNEZ: All right. Now, still, despite those complaints, it sounds like people are tuning in. So what are you going to be watching for?MASTROMARINO: Yeah, so there always are big announcements and surprises. This host, Geoff Keighley, has been indicating that we're going to get some big news. I'm expecting a new trailer for \"Grand Theft Auto VI,\" which is slated to come out next year. We also know we're getting the reveal of the new game from the 2021 game of the year winner, \"It Takes Two.\" They'll show off what they've been cooking up. So there's always room for surprises. And my guess is come tomorrow morning, we will have a completely different set of topics to discuss.MARTÍNEZ: All right. That's NPR gaming lead James Mastromarino. James, for our segment, it is game over.MASTROMARINO: (Laughter) Game over, man. Thanks, A. Copyright © 2024 NPR. All rights reserved.

GEOFF KEIGHLEY: Good evening, everyone, and welcome to the Game Awards.(CHEERING)A MARTÍNEZ, HOST: One of the world's most-watched awards shows is happening tonight. It's the 11th annual Game Awards. Hosted and produced by video game journalist Geoff Keighley. The self-described biggest night in gaming has been getting more popular. More than 100 million people livestreamed the event last year, even as the awards also face criticism and controversy. NPR gaming lead James Mastromarino joins us now to talk about the whole affair. Now, James, before we start, we should acknowledge that NPR is among the more than 130 media organizations who contributed to the Game Awards shortlist. So, James, how does this all work? I mean, some sort of critics' choice?JAMES MASTROMARINO, BYLINE: Yeah, mostly. International media organizations have two voting rounds - one where they nominate games for the shortlist and another where they pick their favorites in each category. So the jury is mostly English-speaking, as you could expect from a U.S.-based show. But there's decent representation across the world, particularly in Asian countries and Brazil. But the most unique thing about the Game Awards is that 10% of the final tally comes from the public, who can vote online. There's even a players' choice category that's entirely based on online votes. So that all lends the Game Awards this kind of populist, carnival-like atmosphere compared to, say, the Oscars.MARTÍNEZ: Ooh, players' choice. That's like when I go to Vegas. It's players' choice all around.MASTROMARINO: (Laughter). Yeah. Yep.MARTÍNEZ: All right. So who are the - some of the favorites to win this year?MASTROMARINO: Yeah, it's been a mixed year for PlayStation commercially, but it's been a great year for them critically. Two PS5 exclusives lead with seven nominations, including game of the year. There's the big-budget role-playing game \"Final Fantasy VII Rebirth.\" It's sort of a remake, sort of a sequel to the beloved RPG from 1997.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) We can handle this. I will reclaim our world.MASTROMARINO: Then, kind of on the flip side, there's this cute 3D platformer, \"Astro Bot,\" which is just pure joy to play. And it feels like PlayStation finally created something to rival the best Mario platformer games.(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"I AM ASTRO BOT\")KENNETH C M YOUNG: (Singing) I am Astro Bot.MASTROMARINO: The other game of the year nominees are the politically charged metaphor, \"ReFantazio,\" \"Black Myth: Wukong\" - an action game inspired by Chinese literature and mythology - and \"Shadow Of The Erdtree,\" the expansion to the 2022 game of the year, \"Elden Ring.\" But then there's also this little indie game, \"Balatro.\" You can think of it as a single-player poker sort of game - all of the pleasure of gambling with none of the risk.MARTÍNEZ: (Laughter).MASTROMARINO: And compared to these other games, \"Balatro\" had an incredibly small budget but has really been blowing up. And it's been playing all of its cards right, and may actually take home the big prize this year.MARTÍNEZ: Now, I understand that this year, some people are a little upset that too many games are eligible for awards.MASTROMARINO: Yeah, so the main thing here is that never before has an expansion - not a full sequel, just an appendage to an existing game - been up for the big game of the year award. That's \"Shadow Of The Erdtree\" - again, the follow-up to the 2022 hit, \"Elden Ring,\" which won game of the year. And some folks think that other games should be allowed to compete in that space and that \"Elden Ring\" already had its time.MARTÍNEZ: Now, it sounds like the awards have been criticized for being too close to the industry for some time.

I will reclaim our world.MASTROMARINO: Then, kind of on the flip side, there's this cute 3D platformer, \"Astro Bot,\" which is just pure joy to play. And it feels like PlayStation finally created something to rival the best Mario platformer games.(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"I AM ASTRO BOT\")KENNETH C M YOUNG: (Singing) I am Astro Bot.MASTROMARINO: The other game of the year nominees are the politically charged metaphor, \"ReFantazio,\" \"Black Myth: Wukong\" - an action game inspired by Chinese literature and mythology - and \"Shadow Of The Erdtree,\" the expansion to the 2022 game of the year, \"Elden Ring.\" But then there's also this little indie game, \"Balatro.\" You can think of it as a single-player poker sort of game - all of the pleasure of gambling with none of the risk.MARTÍNEZ: (Laughter).MASTROMARINO: And compared to these other games, \"Balatro\" had an incredibly small budget but has really been blowing up. And it's been playing all of its cards right, and may actually take home the big prize this year.MARTÍNEZ: Now, I understand that this year, some people are a little upset that too many games are eligible for awards.MASTROMARINO: Yeah, so the main thing here is that never before has an expansion - not a full sequel, just an appendage to an existing game - been up for the big game of the year award. That's \"Shadow Of The Erdtree\" - again, the follow-up to the 2022 hit, \"Elden Ring,\" which won game of the year. And some folks think that other games should be allowed to compete in that space and that \"Elden Ring\" already had its time.MARTÍNEZ: Now, it sounds like the awards have been criticized for being too close to the industry for some time. Is it more like a four-hour advertisement more than an awards show like, say, the Oscars?MASTROMARINO: Well, all awards shows exist to promote their respective industries, but the Game Awards is very nakedly a showcase. It debuts exclusive trailers and sells advertisement slots for hundreds of thousands of dollars. It broadcasts out of LA and brings out Hollywood celebrities to announce partnerships with game companies. And host Geoff Keighley rattles off some categories so fast that winners don't have the chance to give acceptance speeches. And even when they do, they often have only about a minute to do so. There are many examples of heartfelt speeches that get cut off before their time. So I'm curious to see if the awards won't be quite as rapid-fire this year.MARTÍNEZ: All right. Now, still, despite those complaints, it sounds like people are tuning in. So what are you going to be watching for?MASTROMARINO: Yeah, so there always are big announcements and surprises. This host, Geoff Keighley, has been indicating that we're going to get some big news. I'm expecting a new trailer for \"Grand Theft Auto VI,\" which is slated to come out next year. We also know we're getting the reveal of the new game from the 2021 game of the year winner, \"It Takes Two.\" They'll show off what they've been cooking up. So there's always room for surprises. And my guess is come tomorrow morning, we will have a completely different set of topics to discuss.MARTÍNEZ: All right. That's NPR gaming lead James Mastromarino. James, for our segment, it is game over.MASTROMARINO: (Laughter) Game over, man. Thanks, A. Copyright © 2024 NPR. All rights reserved.

One of the world's most-watched awards shows is happening tonight. It's the 11th annual Game Awards. Hosted and produced by video game journalist Geoff Keighley. The self-described biggest night in gaming has been getting more popular. More than 100 million people livestreamed the event last year, even as the awards also face criticism and controversy. NPR gaming lead James Mastromarino joins us now to talk about the whole affair. Now, James, before we start, we should acknowledge that NPR is among the more than 130 media organizations who contributed to the Game Awards shortlist. So, James, how does this all work? I mean, some sort of critics' choice?JAMES MASTROMARINO, BYLINE: Yeah, mostly. International media organizations have two voting rounds - one where they nominate games for the shortlist and another where they pick their favorites in each category. So the jury is mostly English-speaking, as you could expect from a U.S.-based show. But there's decent representation across the world, particularly in Asian countries and Brazil. But the most unique thing about the Game Awards is that 10% of the final tally comes from the public, who can vote online. There's even a players' choice category that's entirely based on online votes. So that all lends the Game Awards this kind of populist, carnival-like atmosphere compared to, say, the Oscars.MARTÍNEZ: Ooh, players' choice. That's like when I go to Vegas. It's players' choice all around.MASTROMARINO: (Laughter). Yeah. Yep.MARTÍNEZ: All right. So who are the - some of the favorites to win this year?MASTROMARINO: Yeah, it's been a mixed year for PlayStation commercially, but it's been a great year for them critically. Two PS5 exclusives lead with seven nominations, including game of the year. There's the big-budget role-playing game \"Final Fantasy VII Rebirth.\" It's sort of a remake, sort of a sequel to the beloved RPG from 1997.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) We can handle this.

MASTROMARINO: (Laughter). Yeah. Yep.MARTÍNEZ: All right. So who are the - some of the favorites to win this year?MASTROMARINO: Yeah, it's been a mixed year for PlayStation commercially, but it's been a great year for them critically. Two PS5 exclusives lead with seven nominations, including game of the year. There's the big-budget role-playing game \"Final Fantasy VII Rebirth.\" It's sort of a remake, sort of a sequel to the beloved RPG from 1997.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) We can handle this. I will reclaim our world.MASTROMARINO: Then, kind of on the flip side, there's this cute 3D platformer, \"Astro Bot,\" which is just pure joy to play. And it feels like PlayStation finally created something to rival the best Mario platformer games.(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"I AM ASTRO BOT\")KENNETH C M YOUNG: (Singing) I am Astro Bot.MASTROMARINO: The other game of the year nominees are the politically charged metaphor, \"ReFantazio,\" \"Black Myth: Wukong\" - an action game inspired by Chinese literature and mythology - and \"Shadow Of The Erdtree,\" the expansion to the 2022 game of the year, \"Elden Ring.\" But then there's also this little indie game, \"Balatro.\" You can think of it as a single-player poker sort of game - all of the pleasure of gambling with none of the risk.MARTÍNEZ: (Laughter).MASTROMARINO: And compared to these other games, \"Balatro\" had an incredibly small budget but has really been blowing up. And it's been playing all of its cards right, and may actually take home the big prize this year.MARTÍNEZ: Now, I understand that this year, some people are a little upset that too many games are eligible for awards.MASTROMARINO: Yeah, so the main thing here is that never before has an expansion - not a full sequel, just an appendage to an existing game - been up for the big game of the year award. That's \"Shadow Of The Erdtree\" - again, the follow-up to the 2022 hit, \"Elden Ring,\" which won game of the year. And some folks think that other games should be allowed to compete in that space and that \"Elden Ring\" already had its time.MARTÍNEZ: Now, it sounds like the awards have been criticized for being too close to the industry for some time. Is it more like a four-hour advertisement more than an awards show like, say, the Oscars?MASTROMARINO: Well, all awards shows exist to promote their respective industries, but the Game Awards is very nakedly a showcase. It debuts exclusive trailers and sells advertisement slots for hundreds of thousands of dollars. It broadcasts out of LA and brings out Hollywood celebrities to announce partnerships with game companies. And host Geoff Keighley rattles off some categories so fast that winners don't have the chance to give acceptance speeches. And even when they do, they often have only about a minute to do so. There are many examples of heartfelt speeches that get cut off before their time. So I'm curious to see if the awards won't be quite as rapid-fire this year.MARTÍNEZ: All right. Now, still, despite those complaints, it sounds like people are tuning in. So what are you going to be watching for?MASTROMARINO: Yeah, so there always are big announcements and surprises. This host, Geoff Keighley, has been indicating that we're going to get some big news. I'm expecting a new trailer for \"Grand Theft Auto VI,\" which is slated to come out next year. We also know we're getting the reveal of the new game from the 2021 game of the year winner, \"It Takes Two.\" They'll show off what they've been cooking up. So there's always room for surprises. And my guess is come tomorrow morning, we will have a completely different set of topics to discuss.MARTÍNEZ: All right. That's NPR gaming lead James Mastromarino.

UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) We can handle this. I will reclaim our world.MASTROMARINO: Then, kind of on the flip side, there's this cute 3D platformer, \"Astro Bot,\" which is just pure joy to play. And it feels like PlayStation finally created something to rival the best Mario platformer games.(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"I AM ASTRO BOT\")KENNETH C M YOUNG: (Singing) I am Astro Bot.MASTROMARINO: The other game of the year nominees are the politically charged metaphor, \"ReFantazio,\" \"Black Myth: Wukong\" - an action game inspired by Chinese literature and mythology - and \"Shadow Of The Erdtree,\" the expansion to the 2022 game of the year, \"Elden Ring.\" But then there's also this little indie game, \"Balatro.\" You can think of it as a single-player poker sort of game - all of the pleasure of gambling with none of the risk.MARTÍNEZ: (Laughter).MASTROMARINO: And compared to these other games, \"Balatro\" had an incredibly small budget but has really been blowing up. And it's been playing all of its cards right, and may actually take home the big prize this year.MARTÍNEZ: Now, I understand that this year, some people are a little upset that too many games are eligible for awards.MASTROMARINO: Yeah, so the main thing here is that never before has an expansion - not a full sequel, just an appendage to an existing game - been up for the big game of the year award. That's \"Shadow Of The Erdtree\" - again, the follow-up to the 2022 hit, \"Elden Ring,\" which won game of the year. And some folks think that other games should be allowed to compete in that space and that \"Elden Ring\" already had its time.MARTÍNEZ: Now, it sounds like the awards have been criticized for being too close to the industry for some time. Is it more like a four-hour advertisement more than an awards show like, say, the Oscars?MASTROMARINO: Well, all awards shows exist to promote their respective industries, but the Game Awards is very nakedly a showcase. It debuts exclusive trailers and sells advertisement slots for hundreds of thousands of dollars. It broadcasts out of LA and brings out Hollywood celebrities to announce partnerships with game companies. And host Geoff Keighley rattles off some categories so fast that winners don't have the chance to give acceptance speeches. And even when they do, they often have only about a minute to do so. There are many examples of heartfelt speeches that get cut off before their time. So I'm curious to see if the awards won't be quite as rapid-fire this year.MARTÍNEZ: All right. Now, still, despite those complaints, it sounds like people are tuning in. So what are you going to be watching for?MASTROMARINO: Yeah, so there always are big announcements and surprises. This host, Geoff Keighley, has been indicating that we're going to get some big news. I'm expecting a new trailer for \"Grand Theft Auto VI,\" which is slated to come out next year. We also know we're getting the reveal of the new game from the 2021 game of the year winner, \"It Takes Two.\" They'll show off what they've been cooking up. So there's always room for surprises. And my guess is come tomorrow morning, we will have a completely different set of topics to discuss.MARTÍNEZ: All right. That's NPR gaming lead James Mastromarino. James, for our segment, it is game over.MASTROMARINO: (Laughter) Game over, man. Thanks, A. Copyright © 2024 NPR. All rights reserved.

It debuts exclusive trailers and sells advertisement slots for hundreds of thousands of dollars. It broadcasts out of LA and brings out Hollywood celebrities to announce partnerships with game companies. And host Geoff Keighley rattles off some categories so fast that winners don't have the chance to give acceptance speeches. And even when they do, they often have only about a minute to do so. There are many examples of heartfelt speeches that get cut off before their time. So I'm curious to see if the awards won't be quite as rapid-fire this year.MARTÍNEZ: All right. Now, still, despite those complaints, it sounds like people are tuning in. So what are you going to be watching for?MASTROMARINO: Yeah, so there always are big announcements and surprises. This host, Geoff Keighley, has been indicating that we're going to get some big news. I'm expecting a new trailer for \"Grand Theft Auto VI,\" which is slated to come out next year. We also know we're getting the reveal of the new game from the 2021 game of the year winner, \"It Takes Two.\" They'll show off what they've been cooking up. So there's always room for surprises. And my guess is come tomorrow morning, we will have a completely different set of topics to discuss.MARTÍNEZ: All right. That's NPR gaming lead James Mastromarino. James, for our segment, it is game over.MASTROMARINO: (Laughter) Game over, man. Thanks, A. Copyright © 2024 NPR. All rights reserved.

And it's been playing all of its cards right, and may actually take home the big prize this year.MARTÍNEZ: Now, I understand that this year, some people are a little upset that too many games are eligible for awards.MASTROMARINO: Yeah, so the main thing here is that never before has an expansion - not a full sequel, just an appendage to an existing game - been up for the big game of the year award. That's \"Shadow Of The Erdtree\" - again, the follow-up to the 2022 hit, \"Elden Ring,\" which won game of the year.

We also know we're getting the reveal of the new game from the 2021 game of the year winner, \"It Takes Two.\" They'll show off what they've been cooking up. So there's always room for surprises. And my guess is come tomorrow morning, we will have a completely different set of topics to discuss.MARTÍNEZ: All right. That's NPR gaming lead James Mastromarino.

                "title": "Voice of America - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Voice of America (VOA or VoA) is an international broadcasting state media network funded by the federal government of the United States of America. It is the largest and oldest of the U.S. international broadcasters.[3][4][5] VOA produces digital, TV, and radio content in 48 languages, which it distributes to affiliate stations around the world.[6] Its targeted and primary audience is non-American outside of the US borders. As of November 2022, its reporting reached 326 million adults per week across all platforms.[7] It is financed by the U.S. Agency for Global Media after approval by Congress.[8] VOA was established in 1942, and the VOA charter was signed into law in 1976 by U.S. President Gerald Ford.[9][10] It is headquartered in Washington, D.C., and overseen by the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM), an independent agency of the U.S. government.[11] Funds are appropriated annually under the budget for embassies and consulates. As of 2022, VOA had a weekly worldwide audience of approximately 326 million (up from 237 million in 2016) and employed 961 staff with an annual budget of $267.5 million.[1][12][13] The Voice of America website had five English-language broadcasts as of 2014 (worldwide, Learning English, Cambodia, Zimbabwe, and Tibet). Additionally, the VOA website has versions in 48 foreign languages.[14][1] Radio programs are marked with an \"R\"; TV programs with a \"T\": The number of languages varies according to the priorities of the United States government and the world situation.[15][16] Before World War II, all American shortwave radio stations were in private hands.[17] Privately controlled shortwave networks included the National Broadcasting Company's International Network (or White Network), which broadcast in six languages, the Columbia Broadcasting System's Latin American international network, which consisted of 64 stations located in 18 countries, the Crosley Broadcasting Corporation in Cincinnati, Ohio, and General Electric which owned and operated WGEO and WGEA, both based in Schenectady, New York, and KGEI in San Francisco, all of which had shortwave transmitters.[18][19] Experimental programming began in the 1930s, but there were fewer than 12 transmitters in operation.[20] In 1939, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission set the following policy, which was intended to enforce the US State Department's Good Neighbor Policy, but which some broadcasters felt was an attempt to direct censorship:[21] A licensee of an international broadcast station shall render only an international broadcast service which will reflect the culture of this country and which will promote international goodwill, understanding and cooperation. Any program solely intended for, and directed to an audience in the continental United States does not meet the requirements for this service.[22] Around 1940, shortwave signals to Latin America were regarded as vital to counter Nazi propaganda.[20] Initially, the US Office of the Coordinator of Information sent releases to each station, but this was seen as an inefficient means of transmitting news.[17] The director of Latin American relations at the Columbia Broadcasting System was Edmund A. Chester, and he supervised the development of CBS's extensive \"La Cadena de las Américas\" radio network to improve broadcasting to South America during the 1940s.[23] Even before the December 1941 Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the U.S. government's Office of the Coordinator of Information (COI) had already begun providing war news and commentary to the commercial American shortwave radio stations for use on a voluntary basis, through its Foreign Information Service (FIS) headed by playwright Robert E. Sherwood, who served as President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's speech writer and information advisor.[24] Direct programming began a week after the United States' entry into World War II in December 1941, with the first broadcast from the San Francisco office of the FIS via General Electric's KGEI transmitting to the Philippines in English (other languages followed). The next step was to broadcast to Germany, which was called Stimmen aus Amerika (\"Voices from America\") and was transmitted on February 1, 1942. It was introduced by the “Battle Hymn of the Republic\" and included the pledge: \"Today, and every day from now on, we will be with you from America to talk about the war... The news may be good or bad for us – We will always tell you the truth.\"[25] Roosevelt approved this broadcast, which then-Colonel William J. Donovan (COI) and Sherwood (FIS) had recommended to him. It was Sherwood who actually coined the term \"The Voice of America\" to describe the shortwave network that began its transmissions on February 1, from 270 Madison Avenue in New York City. The Office of War Information, when organized in the middle of 1942, officially took over VOA's operations. VOA reached an agreement with the British Broadcasting Corporation to share medium-wave transmitters in Great Britain, and expanded into Tunis in North Africa and Palermo and Bari, Italy, as the Allies captured these territories. The OWI also set up the American Broadcasting Station in Europe.[26] Asian transmissions started with one transmitter in California in 1941; services were expanded by adding transmitters in Hawaii and, after recapture, the Philippines.[27] By the end of the war, VOA had 39 transmitters and provided service in 40 languages.[27] Programming was broadcast from production centers in New York and San Francisco, with more than 1,000 programs originating from New York. Programming consisted of music, news, commentary, and relays of U.S. domestic programming, in addition to specialized VOA programming.[28] About half of VOA's services, including the Arabic service, were discontinued in 1945.[29] In late 1945, VOA was transferred to the US Department of State. Also included among the cultural diplomacy programming on the Columbia Broadcasting System was the musical show Viva America (1942–49) which featured the Pan American Orchestra and the artistry of several noted musicians from both North and South America, including Alfredo Antonini, Juan Arvizu, Eva Garza, Elsa Miranda, Nestor Mesta Chaires, Miguel Sandoval, John Serry Sr., and Terig Tucci.[30][31][32] By 1945, broadcasts of the show were carried by 114 stations on CBS's \"La Cadena de las Américas\" network in 20 Latin American nations. These broadcasts proved to be highly successful in supporting President Roosevelt's policy of Pan-Americanism throughout South America during World War II.[33] The VOA ramped up its operations during the Cold War.[34] Foy Kohler, the director of VOA from 1949 to 1952, strongly believed that the VOA was serving its purpose, which he identified as aiding in the fight against communism.[35] He argued that the numbers of listeners they were getting such as 194,000 regular listeners in Sweden, and 2.1 million regular listeners in France, was an indication of a positive impact. As further evidence, he noted that the VOA received 30,000 letters a month from listeners all over the world, and hundreds of thousands of requests for broadcasting schedules.[36] There was an analysis done of some of those letters sent in 1952 and 1953 while Kohler was still director. The study found that letter writing could be an indicator of successful, actionable persuasion. It was also found that broadcasts in different countries were having different effects. In one country, regular listeners adopted and practiced American values presented by the broadcast. Age was also a factor: younger and older audiences tended to like different types of programs, no matter the country.[37] Kohler used all of this as evidence to claim that the VOA helped to grow and strengthen the free world. It also influenced the UN in their decision to condemn communist actions in Korea, and was a major factor in the decline of communism in the \"free world, including key countries such as Italy and France.[35] In Italy, the VOA did not just bring an end to communism, but it caused the country to Americanize.[38] The VOA also had an impact behind the Iron Curtain. Practically all defectors during Kohler's time said that the VOA helped in their decision to defect.[39] Another indication of impact, according to Kohler, was the Soviet response. Kohler argued that the Soviets responded because the VOA was having an impact. Based on Soviet responses, it can be presumed that the most effective programs were ones that compared the lives of those behind and outside the Iron Curtain, questions on the practice of slave labor, as well as lies and errors in Stalin's version of Marxism.[35] In 1947, VOA started broadcasting to the Soviet citizens in Russia under the pretext of countering \"more harmful instances of Soviet propaganda directed against American leaders and policies\" on the part of the internal Soviet Russian-language media, according to John B. Whitton's treatise, Cold War Propaganda.[40] The Soviet Union responded by initiating electronic jamming of VOA broadcasts on April 24, 1949.[40] Charles W. Thayer headed VOA in 1948–49.[41] Over the next few years, the U.S. government debated the best role of Voice of America. The decision was made to use VOA broadcasts as a part of U.S. foreign policy to fight the propaganda of the Soviet Union and other countries. The Arabic service resumed on January 1, 1950, with a half-hour program. This program grew to 14.5 hours daily during the Suez Crisis of 1956, and was six hours a day by 1958.[29] Between 1952 and 1960, Voice of America used a converted U.S. Coast Guard cutter Courier as a first mobile broadcasting ship.[42] Control of VOA passed from the State Department to the U.S. Information Agency when the latter was established in 1953[29] to transmit worldwide, including to the countries behind the Iron Curtain and to the People's Republic of China. From 1955 until 2003, VOA broadcast American jazz on the Voice of America Jazz Hour. Hosted for most of that period by Willis Conover, the program had 30 million listeners at its peak. A program aimed at South Africa in 1956 broadcast two hours nightly, and special programs such as The Newport Jazz Festival were also transmitted. This was done in association with tours by U.S. musicians, such as Dizzy Gillespie, Louis Armstrong, and Duke Ellington, sponsored by the State Department.[43] From August 1952 through May 1953, Billy Brown, a high school senior in Westchester County, New York, had a Monday night program in which he shared everyday happenings in Yorktown Heights, New York. Brown's program ended due to its popularity: his \"chatty narratives\" attracted so much fan mail, VOA couldn't afford the $500 a month in clerical and postage costs required to respond to listeners' letters.[44] During 1953, VOA personnel were subjected to McCarthyist policies, where VOA was accused by Senator Joseph McCarthy, Roy Cohn, and Gerard David Schine of intentionally planning to build weak transmitting stations to sabotage VOA broadcasts. However, the charges were dropped after one month of court hearings in February and March 1953.[45] Sometime around 1954, VOA's headquarters were moved from New York to Washington D.C. The arrival of cheap, low-cost transistors enabled the significant growth of shortwave radio listeners. During the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, VOA's broadcasts were deemed controversial, as Hungarian refugees and revolutionaries thought that VOA served as a medium and insinuated the possible arrival of the Western aid.[46] Throughout the Cold War, many of the targeted countries' governments sponsored jamming of VOA broadcasts, which sometimes led critics to question the broadcasts' actual impact. For example, in 1956, Polish People's Republic stopped jamming VOA transmissions,[47] but People's Republic of Bulgaria continued to jam the signal through the 1970s. In 1966 Edward R. Murrow said that: \"The Russians spend more money jamming the Voice of America than we have to spend for the entire program of the entire Agency. They spend about $125 million ($1,200,000,000 in current dollar terms) a year jamming it.\"[48] Chinese-language VOA broadcasts were jammed beginning in 1956 and extending through 1976.[49] However, after the collapse of the Warsaw Pact and the Soviet Union, interviews with participants in anti-Soviet movements verified the effectiveness of VOA broadcasts in transmitting information to socialist societies.[50] The People's Republic of China diligently jams VOA broadcasts.[51] Cuba has also been reported to interfere with VOA satellite transmissions to Iran from its Russian-built transmission site at Bejucal.[52] David Jackson, former director of Voice of America, noted: \"The North Korean government doesn't jam us, but they try to keep people from listening through intimidation or worse. But people figure out ways to listen despite the odds. They're very resourceful.\"[53] Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, VOA covered some of the era's most important news, including Martin Luther King Jr.'s 1963 \"I Have a Dream\" speech[55] and Neil Armstrong's 1969 first walk on the Moon, which drew an audience estimated at between 615 and 750 million people. In 1973, due to the détente policies in the Cold War, Soviet jamming of the VOA ceased; it restarted in 1979.[56] In the early 1980s, VOA began a $1.3 billion rebuilding program to improve broadcast with better technical capabilities. During the implementation of the Martial law in Poland between 1981 and 1983, VOA's Polish broadcasts expanded to seven hours daily. Throughout the 1980s, VOA focused on covering events from the 'American hinterland', such as 150th anniversary of the Oregon Trail.[45] Also in the 1980s, VOA also added a television service, as well as special regional programs to Cuba, Radio Martí and TV Martí. Cuba has consistently attempted to jam such broadcasts and has vociferously protested U.S. broadcasts directed at Cuba. In September 1980, VOA started broadcasting to Afghanistan in Dari and in Pashto in 1982.[57] In 1981, VOA opened a bureau in Beijing, China.[58] The next year, it began regular exchanges with Radio Peking.[58] In 1985, VOA Europe was created as a special service in English that was relayed via satellite to AM, FM, and cable affiliates throughout Europe. With a contemporary format including live disc jockeys, the network presented top musical hits as well as VOA news and features of local interest (such as \"EuroFax\") 24 hours a day. VOA Europe was closed down without advance public notice in January 1997 as a cost-cutting measure.[59] It was followed by VOA Express, which from July 4, 1999, revamped into VOA Music Mix.[60] Since November 1, 2014, stations are offered VOA1 (which is a rebranding of VOA Music Mix).[61] In 1989, Voice of America expanded its Mandarin and Cantonese programming to reach the millions of Chinese and inform the country about the pro-democracy movement within the country, including the demonstration in Tiananmen Square.[62] Starting in 1990, the U.S. consolidated its international broadcasting efforts, with the establishment of the Bureau of Broadcasting.[63] With the breakup of the Soviet bloc in Eastern Europe, VOA added many additional language services to reach those areas. This decade was marked by the additions of services in Standard Tibetan, Kurdish (to Iran and Iraq), Serbo-Croatian (Croatian, Serbian, Bosnian), Macedonian, and Rwanda-Rundi.[64][65] In 1993, the Clinton administration advised cutting funding for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, as it believed post-Cold War information and influence was not needed in Europe. This plan was not well received, and US President Bill Clinton then proposed the compromise of the International Broadcasting Act, which he signed into law in 1994. This law established the International Broadcasting Bureau as a part of the United States Information Agency (USIA), and established the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) with oversight authority, which took control from the Board for International Broadcasters which previously had overseen funding for RFE/RL.[66] In 1998, the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act was signed into law, and mandated that the BBG become an independent federal agency as of October 1, 1999. This act also abolished the USIA, and merged most of its functions into those of the State Department.[67] In 1994, Voice of America became the first broadcast-news organization to offer continuously updated programs on the Internet.[68] The Arabic Service was abolished in 2002 and replaced by a new radio service, called the Middle East Radio Network or Radio Sawa, with an initial budget of $22 million. Radio Sawa offered mostly Western and Middle Eastern popular songs with periodic brief news bulletins. The Arabic Service expanded to television with Alhurra on February 14, 2004 (and later to various social media and websites).[69] On May 16, 2004, the US government's international English language TV service Worldnet, became part of VOA as \"VOA TV\". Radio programs in Russian ended in July 2008.[70] In September 2008, VOA eliminated the Hindi-language service after 53 years.[70] Broadcasts in Ukrainian, Serbian, Macedonian, and Bosnian also ended.[71] These reductions were part of American efforts to concentrate more resources to broadcast to the Muslim world.[70][71] In September 2010, VOA began radio broadcasts in Sudan. As U.S. interests in South Sudan grew, there was a desire to provide people with free information.[72] In 2013, VOA ended foreign-language transmissions on shortwave and medium wave to Albania, Georgia, Iran, and Latin America, as well as English-language broadcasts to the Middle East and Afghanistan.[73] This was done due to budget cuts.[73] On July 1, 2014, VOA cut most of its English-language transmissions to Asia,[74] as well as shortwave transmissions in Azerbaijani, Bengali, Khmer, Kurdish, Lao, and Uzbek.[74] The following month, the Greek service ended after 72 years on air.[75][76] RFE/RL launched the Russian language Current Time TV, in October 2014.[77] In January 2016, upon his arrival in Moscow, Russian authorities detained and then deported Jeff Shell, the Chairman of the Broadcasting Board of Governors that oversees the Voice of America, despite his having a valid Russian visa.[78] Russian authorities did not explain their actions.[78] Round-the-clock broadcasting of Current Time began on February 7, 2017.[79][80][81] In December 2017, under a new directive from Russia's Kremlin after a new law was passed by the State Duma (Russia's lower house of parliament) and the upper house Federation Council and signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin, Voice of America was deemed a \"foreign agent\" under the Russian foreign agent law.[82][83] In June 2021, the Russian news agency TASS reported that Russia's state communications watchdog Roskomnadzor complained that the foreign agent Voice of America radio station challengingly refused to observe Russian law because it had not established a Russian legal entity.[84] Roskomnadzor also said that VOA was as a foreign agent \"obliged to mark their content and provide information about all aspects of their activity, including a detailed description of contacts with the authorities.\"[84] In March 2022, VOA and other news broadcasters, including the BBC, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, and Deutsche Welle were blocked in Russia,[85] as after the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Russian authorities increased censorship of independent journalism, anti-war protests, and dissenting voices.[86][87][88][89] Nevertheless, many Russians have used VPNs and other software to get around Russian government blocks.[90][91] As of March 2022, VOA broadcasts were reaching people in Russia and the region through TV, FM and medium wave radio, digital, and direct-to-home satellite.[89] In May 2023, Russia banned acting VOA chief Yolanda Lopez from ever entering the country.[92] The current director, Michael Abramowitz, assumed the position in July 2024. He previously served as president of Freedom House and spent nearly 25 years as a reporter and editor for The Washington Post.[93] In December 2024, president-elect Trump announced he would be picking former news anchor Kari Lake to be the director of VOA.[94] Voice of America has been a part of several agencies. From its founding in 1942 to 1945, it was part of the Office of War Information, and then from 1945 to 1953 as a function of the State Department. VOA was placed under the U.S. Information Agency in 1953. When the USIA was abolished in 1999, VOA was placed under the BBG which is an autonomous U.S. government agency, with bipartisan membership. The Secretary of State has a seat on the BBG.[95] The BBG was established as a buffer to protect VOA and other U.S.-sponsored, non-military, international broadcasters from political interference. It replaced the Board for International Broadcasting (BIB) that oversaw the funding and operation of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, a branch of VOA.[66] In 2021, Voice of America launched 52 Documentary, a series that publishes weekly films about human experiences.[96] The series is presented on the streaming app, VOA+, and YouTube. Films average 10–15 minutes and are translated with captions in several languages, including Russian, Persian, Mandarin, Urdu, and English. Euna Lee directs the program.[97] From 1948 until its amendment in 2013, Voice of America was forbidden to broadcast directly to American citizens, pursuant to § 501 of the Smith–Mundt Act.[98] The intent of the 1948 legislation was to protect the American public from propaganda by its own government and to avoid any competition with private American companies.[99] The act was amended via the passage of the Smith-Mundt Modernization Act provision of the National Defense Authorization Act for 2013.[100] The amendment was intended to adapt the law to the Internet and to allow American citizens access to VOA content.[101] Under the Eisenhower administration in 1959, VOA Director Henry Loomis commissioned a formal statement of principles to protect the integrity of VOA programming and define the organization's mission, and was issued by Director George V. Allen as a directive in 1960 and was endorsed in 1962 by USIA director Edward R. Murrow.[102] VOA's charter was signed into law by President Gerald Ford.[3]: 218 VOA's charter requires it to \"present the policies of the United States clearly and effectively.\"[103]: 218 Academics including Téwodros W. Workneh have described this as a public diplomacy function.[103]: 218 VOA's charter also requires it to be \"a reliable and authoritative source of news\" which \"shall be accurate, objective, and comprehensive\".[103]: 218 The Voice of America Firewall was put in place with the 1976 VOA Charter and laws passed in 1994 and 2016 as a way of ensuring the integrity of VOA's journalism. This policy fights against propaganda and promotes unbiased and objective journalistic standards in the agency. The charter is one part of this firewall and the other laws assist in ensuring high standards of journalism.[104][105] According to former VOA correspondent Alan Heil, the internal policy of VOA News is that any story broadcast must have two independently corroborating sources or have a staff correspondent witness an event.[106] VOA Radiogram was an experimental Voice of America program that started in March 2013 and ended in June 2017, which transmitted digital text and images via shortwave radiograms.[107][108] There were 220 editions of the program, transmitted each weekend from the Edward R. Murrow transmitting station. The audio tones that comprised the bulk of each 30-minute program were transmitted via an analog transmitter, and could be decoded using a basic AM shortwave receiver with freely downloadable software of the Fldigi family. This software was available for Windows, macOS, Linux, and FreeBSD systems. Broadcasts could also be decoded using the free TIVAR app from the Google Play store using any Android device. The mode used most often on VOA Radiogram, for both text and images, was MFSK32, but other modes were also occasionally transmitted. The final edition of VOA Radiogram was transmitted during the weekend of June 17–18, 2017, a week before the retirement of the program producer from VOA. An offer to continue the broadcasts on a contract basis was declined, so a follow-on show called Shortwave Radiogram began transmission on June 25, 2017, from the WRMI transmitting site in Okeechobee, Florida.[109][110] The Bethany Relay Station, operational from 1944 to 1994, was based on a 625-acre (2.53 km2) site in Union Township (now West Chester Township) in Butler County, Ohio, near Cincinnati.[112] Major transmitter upgrades first were undertaken around 1963, when shortwave and medium-wave transmitters were built, upgraded, or rebuilt.[45] The site is now a recreational park with a Voice of America museum. Other former sites include California (Dixon and Delano), Hawaii, Okinawa, Liberia (Monrovia), Costa Rica, Belize, and at least two in Greece (Kavala and Rhodos). Between 1983 and 1990, VOA made significant upgrades to transmission facilities in Botswana (Selebi-Phikwe), Morocco, Thailand (Udon Thani), Kuwait, and São Tomé (Almas).[113] Some of them are shared with Radio Liberty and Radio Free Asia. VOA and USAGM continue to operate shortwave radio transmitters and antenna farms at International Broadcasting Bureau Greenville Transmitting Station (known as \"Site B\") in the United States, close to Greenville, North Carolina. They do not use FCC-issued call signs, since the FCC does not regulate communications by other federal government agencies. The International Broadcasting Bureau also operates transmission facilities on São Tomé and Tinang, Concepcion, Tarlac, Philippines for VOA.[114] Kosovo Republic of Kosovo (2008–present) On June 12, 2024, the House Foreign Affairs Committee concluded that there was \"credible evidence of corruption\" regarding the matter of Setareh Derakhshesh Sieg, the former director of Voice of America's Persian News Network (PNN).[116] Following a series of whistleblower complaints and an extensive internal investigation by civil servants, Sieg had been terminated in January 2021 for falsifying her education credentials, severe abuses of taxpayer dollars for personal benefit, and engaging in a pattern of favoritism that materially benefitted some employees and contractors at the expense of the public.[117] However, within hours after President Biden took office, Sieg was reinstated then transferred to a different role by then-acting VOA Director Yolanda Lopez and cleared of wrongdoing.[118] Lopez abruptly resigned in September 2023 as the Committee intensified its investigation.[119] In its June 2024 report, the Committee found that the original allegations had merit and were supported by substantial evidence.[120] Sieg remains employed at VOA. On April 2, 2007, Abdul Malik Rigi, the leader of Jundullah, an Iranian Muslim Sunni Salafi militant group with possible links to al-Qaeda, appeared on Voice of America's Persian-language service. The interview was condemned by the Iranian government.[121][122] Jundullah was linked to attacks on both Iranian military and civilians.[123][124] Rigi was captured by the Iranian security services and executed in 2010 in Evin Prison in Tehran.[125][126] In February 2013, a documentary released by China Central Television interviewed a Tibetan alleged self-immolator who failed to kill himself. The interviewee said he was motivated by Voice of America's broadcasts of commemorations of people who committed suicide in political self-immolation. VOA denied instigating self-immolations and demanded that the Chinese station retract its report.[127] After the January 2017 inauguration of US President Donald Trump, tweets by Voice of America (one of which was later removed) seemed to support the widely criticized statements by White House press secretary Sean Spicer about the crowd size and biased media coverage. This raised concerns over possible attempts by Trump to politicize VOA.[128][129][130][131] This amplified already growing propaganda concerns over the provisions in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, signed into law by Barack Obama, which gave the powers of the board of the Broadcasting Board of Governors, which was relegated to an advisory role, to a CEO appointed by the president. Trump sent two of his political aides to the agency to aid its CEO during the transition to the Trump administration. Criticism was raised over Trump's choice of aides; Matthew Schuck was a staff writer for right-wing website The Daily Surge until 2015, while Matthew Ciepielowski was a field director at the conservative libertarian advocacy group Americans for Prosperity.[128] VOA officials responded with assurances that they would not become \"Trump TV\".[128] BBG head John F. Lansing told NPR that it would be illegal for the administration to tell VOA what to broadcast, while VOA director Amanda Bennett stressed that while \"government-funded\", the agency is not \"government-run\".[130] On April 10, 2020, the White House published an article in its daily newsletter critical of VOA coverage of the coronavirus pandemic.[132] Emails revealed in a Freedom of Information Act request showed Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) press official Michawn Rich had sent a memo to agency employees stating in part, \"as a rule, do not send up [interview] requests for [VOA contributor] Greta Van Susteren or anyone affiliated with Voice of America\", referencing the White House story.[133] On April 30, The Washington Post, referring to Steven L. Herman who covered the White House for VOA, reported Vice President Mike Pence's office \"threatened to retaliate against a reporter who revealed that Pence's office had told journalists they would need masks for Pence's visit to the Mayo Clinic – a requirement Pence himself did not follow.\"[134] On June 3, 2020, the US Senate confirmed Michael Pack, a conservative documentaries filmmaker and close ally of Steve Bannon, to serve as head of the US Agency for Global Media, which oversees VOA.[135] Subsequently, Director Bennet and deputy director Sandy Sugawara resigned from VOA. CNN reported on June 16 that plans for a leadership shakeup at VOA were being discussed, including the possibility that controversial former White House aide Sebastian Gorka would be given a leadership role at VOA.[136] On June 17, the heads of VOA's Middle East Broadcasting, Radio Free Asia, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and the Open Technology Fund were all fired, their boards were dissolved, and external communications from VOA employees were made to require approval from senior agency personnel in what one source described as an \"unprecedented\" move, while Jeffrey Scott Shapiro, like Pack a Bannon ally, was rumored to be in line to head the Office of Cuba Broadcasting.[137] Four former members of the advisory boards filed suit challenging Pack's standing to fire them.[138] On July 9, NPR reported VOA would not renew the work visas of dozens of non-resident reporters, many of whom could face repercussions in their home countries.[139] In late July, four contractors and the head of VOA's Urdu-language service were suspended after a video featuring extensive clips from a Muslim-American voter conference, including a campaign message from then-Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, was determined not to meet editorial standards and taken down.[140] On August 12, 2020, USAGM chief financial officer Grant Turner and general counsel David Kligerman were removed from their positions and stripped of their security clearances, reportedly for their opposition to what Turner called \"gross mismanagement\", along with four other senior agency officials.[141] Politico reported on August 13 that Trump administration official and former shock jock Frank Wuco had been hired as a USAGM senior advisor, responsible for auditing the agency's office of policy and research.[142] As a radio host, Wuco issued insults and groundless claims against former US President Barack Obama, CIA Director John O. Brennan, and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi.[143] VOA's Twitter account during this period featured stories favorable to Vice President Mike Pence and White House advisor Ivanka Trump.[144] In response to Pack's August 27 interview with The Federalist website, a group of VOA journalists sent a letter to VOA Acting Director Elez Biberaj complaining that Pack's \"comments and decisions 'endanger the personal security of VOA reporters at home and abroad, as well as threatening to harm U.S. national security objectives.'\"[145] VOA's response was that \"it would not respond directly to the letter because it was 'improper' and 'failed to follow procedure.' Instead, the leadership of USAGM and VOA 'are handling the choice of complaint transmission as an administrative issue,' which suggested that the journalists could face sanctions for their letter,\" according to The Washington Post. In the same story, the Post reported that VOA Spanish-language service White House correspondent's Brigo Segovia's interview with an official about the administration's response to Pack's personnel and other moves had been censored and his own access to VOA's computer system restricted.[146] On July 20, 2020, District of Columbia attorney general Karl A. Racine filed suit under the District's Nonprofit Corporations Act to reverse Pack's replacement of the Open Technology Fund (OTF) board.[147] Beginning in August 2020, OTF came under increasing pressure from Peck and USAGM leadership. According to Axios,[148][149] this was related to OTF's reluctance to extend grants to Falun Gong-related enterprises working on technology directed against China's Great Firewall; The New York Times noted Falun Gong and its Epoch Times media group frequently supported the Trump administration.[150] On August 18, USAGM announced it was setting up its own Office of Internet Freedom with less strict grant requirements and began soliciting OTF's grantees to apply to the new office.[151][152] On August 20, OTF sued USAGM in the US Court for Federal Claims for withholding nearly $20 million in previously agreed grant funds.[153] On October 15, summary judgment was granted nullifying Pack's attempt to replace the OTF board.[154] On September 29, six senior USAGM officials filed a whistleblower complaint in which they alleged that Pack or one of his aides had ordered research conducted into the voting history of at least one agency employee, which would be a violation of laws protecting civil servants from undue political influence.[155] NPR reported that two Pack aides had compiled a report on VOA White House bureau chief Steven L. Herman's social media postings and other writings in an attempt to charge him with a conflict of interest, and that the agency released a conflict of interest policy stating in part that a \"journalist who on Facebook 'likes' a comment or political cartoon that aggressively attacks or disparages the President must recuse themselves from covering the President.\"[156] A preliminary injunction issued on November 20 barred Pack \"from making personnel decisions involving journalists at the networks; from directly communicating with editors and journalists employed by them; and from investigating any editors or news stories produced by them,\" and characterized the investigation of Herman as an \"unconstitutional prior restraint\" of his, his editors', and fellow journalists' free speech.[157] Suspended officials from Voice of America sued the agency news outlet on October 8. They accused Pack of using Voice of America as a vehicle to promote the personal agenda of President Trump and of violating a statutory firewall intended to prevent political interference with the agency, and they sought their reinstatement.[158] In June 2020, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's campaign told Vox News that Biden would fire Pack if Biden won election.[159] In November 2020, US District Court Judge Beryl Howell found Pack violated the First Amendment rights of Voice of America journalists.[160] In December 2020, The Washington Post reported that Pack was refusing to cooperate with President-elect Biden's transition team and, in an end run around the court order, had persuaded VOA Acting Director Biberaj to step down, replacing him with Robert Reilly, a former VOA director who had written critically of Muslims, gays, and lesbians.[161][162] On December 19, 33 days before President-elect Biden's inauguration, Pack named Ted Lipien, a former VOA veteran journalist who headed the Polish Service during the final struggle for democracy in Poland in the 1980s and a former acting associate director of VOA who, according to NPR, \"became a sharp critic of USAGM, VOA and the other affiliated networks on a pair of blogs\" and \"of the three network presidents affected, the only one without established partisan ties,\" as head of RFE/RL, and Jeffrey Scott Shapiro, a writer for Breitbart and The Washington Times who had claimed President Obama \"hates America,\" as head of the Office of Cuba Broadcasting.[163][164][165][166] On December 30, NPR reported Pack was attempting to add contractual language that would make it impossible to fire the broadcasting board members he had installed for two years, after which they could only be fired \"for cause.\" Reportedly the new contracts were withdrawn after inquiries from media and Congress.[167] On January 11, 2021, VOA interim director Reilly ordered veteran reporter Patsy Widakuswara off the White House beat. Earlier that day, Widakuswara had followed US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo out of the building after his speech criticizing the VOA[168] and his VOA-sponsored interview with VOA Director Robert Reilly during which reporters were not allowed to ask questions.[169] Widakuswara asked Pompeo what he was doing to repair the international reputation of the U.S. and whether he regretted saying there would be a second Trump administration.[170][171] The theme of the preceding interview with VOA Director Robert Reilly was reportedly the dangers of censorship.[172] In response, dozens of VOA journalists, including Widakuswara, wrote and circulated a petition calling on Reilly and public affairs specialist Elizabeth Robbins to resign.[173] In a statement, U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Gregory Meeks and ranking member Michael McCaul said, \"Absent a legitimate reason for this move, which has not been provided, we believe she should be reinstated\".[169] Widakuswara was reinstated to the White House beat after President Biden requested the resignation of Michael Pack.[168] On January 19, the nonprofit Government Accountability Project, representing fired USAGM employees and whistleblowers, sent a letter to the congressional foreign affairs committees, the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, and the Inspector General of the US Department of State. The letter said that Pack had hired the McGuireWoods law firm to investigate USAGM employees and the OTF at a cost of over $2 million in the last quarter of 2020, bypassing US government investigators including USAGM's own Office of Human Resources, and called for further investigation of what it termed a gross misuse of taxpayer dollars.[174] The Washington Post later reported that a second law firm, Caplin & Drysdale, had also been granted a similar no-bid contract in possible violation of federal contracting regulations for a total cost of $4 million.[175] Also on January 19, the last full day of the Trump presidency, Pack named a slate of five directors to head each of the three USAGM boards for RFE/RL, Radio Free Asia, and Middle East Broadcasting Networks: conservative radio talk show host Blanquita Cullum, Liberty Counsel officer Johnathan Alexander, former White House staffer Amanda Milius, conservative writer Roger Simon, and Center for the National Interest Fellow Christian Whiton.[176] The following day, Pack resigned at the request of the Biden administration.[177] On January 21, Shapiro resigned from the Office of Cuba Broadcasting. Biden named veteran VOA journalist Kelu Chao to replace Pack. Chao in turn dismissed Riley and Robbins from VOA, naming Yolanda Lopez, another VOA veteran, as acting director; Lopez had also been reassigned in the wake of the Pompeo interview.[178] On January 22, the Biden administration fired Victoria Coates and her deputy Robert Greenway from the Middle East Broadcasting Networks, naming Kelley Sullivan as acting head.[179][180] On April 19, 2017, the VOA Mandarin Service interviewed Chinese real estate tycoon Guo Wengui in a live broadcast. The government of China warned VOA representatives not to interview Guo about his \"unsubstantiated allegations\".[181][182] The interview was scheduled by the team for 3 hours. After Guo alleged that he had evidence of corruption among the members of the Politburo Standing Committee of China, the highest political authority of China, the interview was abruptly cut off by VOA leadership, after one hour and 17 minutes. Guo's allegations involved Fu Zhenhua and Wang Qishan (a member of the Politburo Standing Committee, and the leader of the anti-graft movement).[183] On August 27, four U.S. Congressmen requested that the Office of Inspector General (OIG) conduct an investigation into the interruption.[184] The OIG investigation concluded that the VOA leadership decision to curtail the Guo interview was based solely on journalistic best practices, rather than due to any pressure from the Chinese government.[185] Another investigation, by Mark Feldstein, Chair of Broadcast Journalism at the University of Maryland, College Park, concluded that \"VOA’s senior management did its best to make decisions consistent with journalism’s best practices and industry standards,” and “was not improperly influenced by the Chinese government or anyone else. The failure [of the VOA Mandarin Service interview team] to comply with leadership's instructions during the Guo interview 'was a colossal and unprecedented violation of journalistic professionalism and broadcast industry standards.'\"[185] The Feldstein report also noted that \"There had been a grossly negligent approach\" by the VOA Mandarin Service interview team to pre-interview vetting, and failure to \"corroborate the authenticity of Guo's evidence or interview other sources,\" in violation of industry standards. The VOA Mandarin Service interview team apparently \"demonstrated greater loyalty to its source than to its employer – at the expense of basic journalistic standards of accuracy, verification, and fairness,\" the Feldstein report concluded.[186][187] It has been reported that a Voice of America relay station in Udon Thani Province, Thailand was used as a CIA black site referred to as \"Cat's Eye\" or \"Detention Site Green\".[188][189] The Amharic Service was started in 1982.[190] From 1982 to 1986, the VOA service had a mix of staff consisting of former members of the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Party (EPRP) and US-educated staff without strong political involvement in the 1974 Ethiopian Revolution and the associated student movement of the revolutionary period. Reporting was mostly critical of the Derg led by Mengistu Haile Mariam.[190] The 1986 to 1996 phase was according to Annette Sheckler, who became head of the VOA Horn of Africa Service in December 1998, opposed to the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF)/Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), which took control of Ethiopia in 1991. According to Sheckler, the reporting became more politicized due to the loss of qualified staff, the role of EPRP-supporting staff being opposed to the TPLF government, and the role of former Derg officials who were recruited to the Service. US ambassadors to Ethiopia Mark Bass, Irvin Hicks, and David Shinn objected to what they saw as a lack of balance in the Service. Sheckler believed the Chief of the Horn of Africa service's EPRP background was a factor in what she viewed as imbalanced reporting. Broadcasts in Tigrinya and Oromo were added in addition to Amhara.[190] Sheckler sees the 18-month period during 1996–98, with a new temporary service Chief, as having become \"essentially ungovernable\" with a \"legacy of personal animosity, hostility and complete lack of professionalism\".[190] Sheckler described the June 1998 phase of the Eritrean–Ethiopian War as exacerbating ethnic conflicts within the service. Sheckler wrote memos to VOA leadership describing her assessment of serious problems in the service, and was fired on November 20, 1998, officially for \"a lack of professional journalistic ethics\"; she describes the reason for her firing as \"telling the truth\".[190] Peter Heinlein led the service from 2012 to 2014. In 2013, he wrote a complaint about his view of problems in the service. He saw a significant flaw being the confusion of roles in which translators, untrained in the principles and methods of journalism, took on the role of journalists.[191] The service was mostly seen as anti-Ethiopian government until 2018, when Negussie Mengesha, the head of the VOA Africa division for several years, met the newly appointed Ethiopian prime minister Abiy Ahmed.[191] In May 2021, several former employees accused VOA's Amharic service, under the leadership of Negussie Mengesha, of being biased in favor of the government of Abiy Ahmed, including failing to report on atrocities committed during the Tigray War.[192] VOA journalist Jason Patinkin said that he had reported the problems \"at every level of the VOA hierarchy\". Patinkin resigned from the service, saying that VOA had \"sided with the perpetrators both by commission and omission\" of \"potential crimes against humanity, ethnic cleansing and perhaps even genocide\".[191] In June 2021, Mail & Guardian reported on an investigation based on \"hundreds of internal memos and interviews with about a dozen former and current members\" of the VOA Horn of Africa service.[191] Mail & Guardian stated that during the Tigray War, the only major foreign news service that was not harassed by Ethiopian security services was VOA. VOA gave frequent coverage to the Mai Kadra massacre, mostly attributed to Tigrayan youth and documented by Amnesty International, while later focusing on the Ethiopian government's dismissal of Amnesty International's report on the Axum massacre rather than on the methods and content of the report itself. During 107 meetings of the Horn of Africa service from November 4, 2020, to April 30, 2021, during the Tigray War, most (81%) of the meetings did not have approvals by Tizita Belachew, head of the service, or by Solomon Abate, of stories on the war that included Tigrayan points of view; a majority of the stories only showed government or military officials' points of view; a fifth of the meetings had no reports on the war. Instructions emailed to staff stated that the terms \"civil war\" and \"war\" were forbidden in reporting on the Tigray War, with Scott Stearns writing on 14 November, according to Mail & Guardian, \"There are to be no deviations from these instructions by any member of any Africa division language service on any platform.\"[191] After Elon Musk acquired social media platform Twitter, in April 2023 National Public Radio's main Twitter account was briefly designated as \"US state-affiliated media\", a label typically reserved for foreign media outlets that directly represented the point of view of their respective governments, like Russia's RT and China's Xinhua.[193][194][195] A few days later, Twitter changed the designation of NPR's account from \"state-affiliated\" to \"government-funded\".[196] Twitter then added the label to other sources such as PBS, the BBC, and Voice of America, which all three objected to.[197] VOA criticized the decision, stating \"the label gives the impression that VOA is not an independent outlet,\" and that \"its editorial independence is protected by regulations and a firewall.\"[198] After the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack on Israel, an email was sent to Voice of America staff from the associate editor for news standards with guidance related to how to refer to the actions (\"terrorist acts\" or \"acts of terror\") and advice about how to refer to individual members of Hamas, i.e. to use the term \"terrorist\" only in direct quotes from sources.[199] At the time, VOA was not the only news outlet with journalists discussing how to objectively refer to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.[199] Six Republican members of Congress signed a letter sent by Senator Bill Hagerty, which criticized and strongly objected to the editorial guidance about how to refer to individual members of Hamas.[199] USAGM chief executive Amanda Bennett sent a letter to the senators to clarify that the VOA email was guidance only, and \"There is no policy prohibiting the use of the words 'terror,' 'terrorism,' or 'terrorist'\" at VOA, and stating the news organizations within USAGM \"counsel care and attention in the use of the words but do not place any restrictions on the appropriate use.\"[199] The controversy prompted Congress to reduce the budget of VOA's parent organization, USAGM.[200] A study was done on Chinese students in America. It found that through the VOA, they disapproved of the actions of the Chinese government.[201] Another study was done on Chinese scholars in America, and found that the VOA had an effect on their political beliefs. Their political beliefs did not change in relation to China, though, as they did not tend to believe the VOA's reports on China.[202] VOA's service in Iran had a negative impact on Kurds and Kurdistan according to the publication Kurdish Life in 2000. They claimed that the VOA exacerbated the conflict between the Talabani and the Barzani.[203] They further claimed that the VOA covered up wrongful imprisonments, wrongful arrests, and the building of extremist mosques. According to the same publication, Kurds were being turned into fanatics, and a new generation of terrorists was forming because of the VOA. They claimed the VOA was doing this to help PUK.[204] The VOA's DEEWA Radio airs in Pakistan. Although in 2015 some listeners were suspicious that the program was promoting an American agenda, others said they were experiencing a positive effect. Some listeners felt that the programs were giving a voice to the voiceless, giving them a sense of empowerment.[205] In 2018, the Pakistani authorities blocked the website of VOA's Pashto and Urdu language radio service.[206][207] In response to the request of the United States Department of Justice that RT register as a foreign agent under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, Russia's Justice Ministry Konovalov labeled Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty as foreign agents in December 2017.[208][209] On June 30, 2022, the Turkish media watchdog, Radio and Television Supreme Council (RTÜK), blocked access to VOA's website amerikaninsesi.com in Turkey because VOA had not applied for the necessary licence, which would subject VOA to certain obligations.[210][211] The RTÜK regulation requires foreign news outlets that publish in Turkey to apply for publication licenses, mandates that at least half of the media organization be owned by a Turkish citizen, and would force VOA to remove content deemed inappropriate by RTÜK.[212] VOA Turkish subsequently broadcast over a different VOA website domain name, voaturkce.com, which in August 2023 was blocked as well.[213] VOA said that \"Given VOA's status as a public service international broadcaster legally required to provide 'accurate, objective, and comprehensive' news coverage to its global audience, VOA cannot comply with any directive intended to enable censorship.\"[213] VOA Turkey, after it was blocked, shared instructions on its social media accounts as to how to use VPN to access its content.[214] Voice of America is seen by some listeners as having a positive impact and serving as US diplomacy, while others, like University of Peshawar's lecturer Faizullah Jan, see it as American propaganda.[205][201][215]",

Despite the mammoth 6,000km trip to Kazakhstan, a rotated Blues side hit the ground running, as Marc Guiu slotted them in front after 14 minutes. Guiu was heavily involved again - as Chelsea doubled their lead four minutes later - with Astana defender Aleksandr Marochkin forcing Pedro Neto's cross into his own net under pressure from the Spaniard. Renato Veiga headed home Kiernan Dewsbury's corner just before the break - to put the result beyond real doubt - before Astana captain Marin Tomasov curled home in first-half added time. Tomasov's intervention did not trigger a second-half revival as Chelsea effectively booked their place in the Round of 16 automatically for 2025.

Here's how that time translates across some of the major territories around the globe: With the Kazakhstan Premier League having concluded in mid-November — Astana lost out to Kairat in the title race by a single point — Grigori Babayan's team have only played one game in a month: their 1-1 home draw with Vitoria in this competition. The coach should at least be able to field a first-choice side for this game, with their lack of playing time keeping injuries to a minimum. Astana XI (4-3-3, right to left): Seysen (GK) — Bartolec, Kazukolovas, Kalaica, Vorogovskiy — Ebong, Marochkin, Amanovic — Tomasov, Chinedu, Camara Astana subs: Bystrov, Kuat, Ahanonu, Beysebekov, Osei, Astanov, Zarutskiy, Basmanov, Gripshi, Karimov, Condric, Zhaksylykov MORE: All the latest Chelsea news | Premier League schedule for 2024/25 | Latest Premier League top scorer rankings Maresca has rotated his side heavily as he usually does for these Conference League matches. The coach confirmed that young defender Josh Acheampong was in line to start for the first time, and the teenager gets the nod at right-back. There are also places in the lineup for Tyrique George and Samuel Rak-Sakyi. Cole Palmer is not in the squad for the league phase, so he will get some rest. Romeo Lavia is also ineligible but would likely have sat this one out anyway after feeling some discomfort during the win at Spurs. Cesare Casadei is suspended after his red card against Heidenheim.

                "content": "Benjamin Joseph Levin (born March 8, 1988), known professionally as Benny Blanco (stylized in all lowercase), is an American record producer, songwriter, record executive and author. He is the recipient of the 2013 Hal David Starlight Award from the Songwriters Hall of Fame.[2] He also won the BMI Songwriter of the Year Award five non-consecutive times, and won the 2017 iHeartRadio Producer of the Year Award. Blanco was initially mentored by songwriter and producer Dr. Luke, who signed Blanco to his production company Kasz Money Productions. Under his tutelage, Blanco co-produced and co-wrote a multitude of hit singles in the late 2000s and thereafter. Blanco's work has led to sales of over 500 million album-equivalent units worldwide for artists including Ed Sheeran, BTS, Eminem, Justin Bieber, Halsey, Katy Perry, Maroon 5, Christina Aguilera, Kesha, Britney Spears, Rihanna, Sia, The Weeknd, Kanye West, Avicii, Selena Gomez, Adam Lambert, Charlie Puth, Keith Urban, OneRepublic, Wiz Khalifa, J Balvin, Ariana Grande, Kali Uchis, Juice Wrld and SZA. In July 2018, Blanco released his debut single as a lead artist, \"Eastside\" (with Halsey and Khalid).[3] The song peaked at number nine on the Billboard Hot 100—marking his 27th top-ten song as a writer, a sum which includes seven number one singles on the chart—while peaking the charts in four countries, and reaching the top ten in several others.[4] It was followed by the singles \"I Found You\" (with Calvin Harris), \"Better to Lie\" (with Jesse and Swae Lee), \"Roses\" (with Brendon Urie and Juice Wrld), and \"Graduation\" (with Juice Wrld). His debut studio album, Friends Keep Secrets was released in December of that year to modest success.[5] A deluxe issue of the album was released in March 2021, a date which coincided with the original receiving platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[6] Blanco has founded two labels as imprints of Interscope Records—Mad Love Records and Friends Keep Secrets—in 2014, through both of which he has signed artists including Tory Lanez, Jessie Ware, and Cashmere Cat, among others.[7] After Friends Keep Secrets and Mad Love were dissolved in 2024, Blanco owns an imprint of Interscope, A&M Records (founded by Herb Alpert and Jerry Moss in 1962). Benny Blanco was born Benjamin Joseph Levin in Reston, Virginia,[8] and has an older brother.[9] He is Jewish.[9][10] He began producing hip-hop instrumentals in his bedroom and recording his own vocals on top of them. His first serious exposure to music came in 1994, when he was six years old with Nas's \"The World Is Yours\" and All-4-One's \"I Swear\" on cassette tapes, which influenced his early productions.[11][12] After early experiments with beat making and recording himself on his boombox, Blanco's rapping earned the attention of The Source and executives at Columbia Records. He attended Camp Airy for many years of his childhood in Thurmont, Maryland, where he would routinely perform and host a radio show under the name \"Ebba Ebba\". Blanco eventually secured an apprenticeship with producer Disco D after multiple trips to New York City from his home in Virginia to meet with labels and producers.[12] Blanco was mentored for several years by songwriter and producer Dr. Luke, who signed Blanco to his production company Kasz Money Productions.[13] While under Dr. Luke's tutelage, Blanco co-produced and co-wrote many songs, including hits such as Katy Perry's \"Teenage Dream\", Kesha's \"TiK ToK\", and Taio Cruz's \"Dynamite\". In 2008, he took part in writing and producing Britney Spears' \"Circus\" (with Dr. Luke, and Claude Kelly). The song reached number three on the Billboard Hot 100 and number one on American pop radio and is her second-best-selling digital song in the United States, having sold over 3.2 million downloads as of July 2016.[14] On a global scale, \"Circus\" was one of the top 10 best-selling songs of 2009 with 5.5 million digital copies sold that year across the world, according to the IFPI.[15] In 2011, Blanco wrote and produced his first charting hits without Dr. Luke, among them Maroon 5's \"Moves Like Jagger\", Gym Class Heroes' \"Stereo Hearts\" and 3OH!3's \"Don't Trust Me\". The same year, Blanco went on to work on Maroon 5's Platinum-selling album Overexposed and its lead single \"Payphone\" featuring Wiz Khalifa.[16] On June 13, 2013, Blanco was presented with the Hal David Starlight Award at the 44th Annual Songwriters Hall of Fame ceremony, an honor awarded to young artists who have already made an impression on the music industry.[17] In his acceptance speech, he joked, \"They picked the wrong person, I'm in a room with people I should probably be serving food to.\"[18] In the years since, Blanco has amassed 29 total number-one songs and is recognized for his achievements with artists including BTS, Gracie Abrams, Ed Sheeran, Justin Bieber, The Weeknd, Selena Gomez, Ariana Grande, Britney Spears, Lana Del Rey, Miguel, Halsey, and Camila Cabello. Blanco was named Producer of the Year at the 2017 iHeartRadio Music Awards.[19] In 2007, Blanco teamed up with Baltimore rappers Spank Rock to release Spank Rock and Benny Blanco Are...Bangers & Cash, a collaborative EP for both artists based on 2 Live Crew samples that caught the attention of many in the industry and sparked connections to future collaborators Amanda Blank and Santigold. The EP received acclaim from the likes of Rolling Stone, Pitchfork and more. In July 2018, Blanco released his debut song as a standalone solo artist, \"Eastside\" featuring Halsey and Khalid, on his own label Friends Keep Secrets with Interscope Records. The song peaked at number nine on the Billboard Hot 100, and was also a global success, topping the charts in New Zealand, the Republic of Ireland, Singapore, and the United Kingdom, and peaking within the top ten of the charts in several other countries, including Australia, Canada, Denmark, and Norway.[20] Later in 2018, he released his second, third, and fourth singles: \"I Found You\" with Calvin Harris, \"Better to Lie\" with Jesse and Swae Lee, and \"Roses\" with Juice Wrld featuring Brendon Urie, respectively.[21] His debut album Friends Keep Secrets was released on December 7, 2018.[22] In January 2019, Blanco released \"I Found You / Nilda's Story\" with Calvin Harris and Miguel in conjunction with the launch of The While They Wait Fund to benefit asylum seekers in the United States, an initiative by Brooklyn Defender Services, Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services and American Civil Liberties Union.[23][24] The song debuted with a video directed by Jake Schreier highlighting the story of one Honduran woman, Nilda, and her two-year-old son Keyden.[25] In February 2019, Blanco released \"I Can't Get Enough\" with Tainy, Selena Gomez, and J Balvin. On August 30, 2019, Blanco released a song with Juice Wrld called \"Graduation\", their second collaboration after \"Roses\".[26] In October 2020, Blanco released his first artist collaboration with Justin Bieber titled \"Lonely\".[27] The second and third singles (\"Real Shit\" with Juice Wrld[28] and \"Unlearn\" with Gracie Abrams[29]) followed in December 2020 and March 2021, respectively. A deluxe version of his album Friends Keep Secrets 2 was released on March 26, 2021, and was certified RIAA platinum on the day of release.[6] On August 5, 2022, Blanco released his first artist collaboration with BTS members Jin, Jimin, V, and Jung Kook as well as Snoop Dogg titled \"Bad Decisions\".[30] On December 16, 2023, a posthumous Juice Wrld song with Blanco and Eminem titled \"Lace It\" was released.[31] On March 9, 2020, Blanco and acclaimed chef Matty Matheson debuted a new collaborative cooking show, Matty and Benny Eat Out America, on Blanco's YouTube channel. The first episode featured a behind-the-scenes visit to fellow YouTuber Kenny Beats's show The Cave where Blanco teaches Matheson to rap. Additional episodes included Lil Dicky, Mason Ramsey, Diplo, Laird Hamilton and more.[32] On April 16, 2020, Blanco made his TV debut playing a fictionalized version of himself on the first and second seasons of the FXX series Dave with Lil Dicky.[33] On March 31, 2021, Blanco and chef Matty Matheson debuted a new cooking show on Blanco's YouTube channel, called Stupid F*cking Cooking Show. Blanco's first book, Open Wide: A Cookbook for Friends,[34] was published on April 30, 2024, by Dey Street Books/HarperCollins.[35] Co-authored with Jess Damuck, Open Wide debuted on best seller lists from The New York Times, Los Angeles Times and USA Today,[36] sitting on The New York Times list for two weeks at publication. The book is a guide to entertaining and features benny's own recipes as well as dishes and advice from friends including Matty Matheson, Lil Dicky, Mike Solomonov, Mario Carbone and Eric André. In 2014, Blanco founded two imprint labels under Interscope, Mad Love Records and Friends Keep Secrets.[37] The former label includes the following artists, many of whom were initially signed with the former, which served as its predecessor.[38][39] As of 2024, they were both defunct, Interscope relaunched a new A&M Records label, operated by Blanco. Blanco has been in a relationship with singer-actress Selena Gomez since June 2023.[46][47] They formally announced their engagement on December 11, 2024, following a period of media rumors.[48] Blanco has written and produced songs for artists including Ed Sheeran (\"Don't\" and \"Castle on the Hill\"),[90] Justin Bieber (\"Love Yourself\"), Major Lazer (\"Cold Water\"), Maroon 5 (\"Moves Like Jagger\", \"Payphone\", \"Maps\", \"Animals\", \"Don't Wanna Know\"), Katy Perry (\"Teenage Dream\", \"California Gurls\"), Rihanna (\"Diamonds\"), Kesha (\"TiK ToK\"), Taio Cruz (\"Dynamite\"), Wiz Khalifa (\"Work Hard, Play Hard\"), Gym Class Heroes (\"Stereo Hearts\"), Lil Dicky (\"Freaky Friday\"), Tory Lanez (\"Luv\").[91]",

                "title": "Mysterious New Jersey drones appear to avoid detection by traditional methods | New Jersey | The Guardian",
                "content": "State lawmaker briefed by homeland security officials says devices appear not to be being flown by hobbyists The large mysterious drones reported flying over parts of New Jersey in recent weeks appear to avoid detection by traditional methods such as helicopter and radio, according to a state lawmaker briefed on Wednesday by the Department of Homeland Security. In a post on the social media platform X, the assemblywoman Dawn Fantasia described the drones as up to 6ft in diameter and sometimes traveling with their lights switched off. The Morris county Republican was among several state and local lawmakers who met with state police and homeland security officials to discuss the spate of sightings that range from the New York City area through New Jersey and westward into parts of Pennsylvania, including over Philadelphia. The devices do not appear to be being flown by hobbyists, Fantasia wrote. Dozens of mysterious night-time flights started last month and have raised growing concern among residents and officials. Part of the worry stems from the flying objects initially being spotted near the Picatinny Arsenal, a US military research and manufacturing facility; and over Donald Trump’s golf course in Bedminster. Drones are legal in New Jersey for recreational and commercial use, but they are subject to local and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations and flight restrictions. Operators must be certified by the FAA. Most, but not all, of the drones spotted in New Jersey were larger than those typically used by hobbyists. The number of sightings has increased in recent days, though officials say many of the objects seen may have been planes rather than drones. It is also possible that a single drone has been reported more than once. The governor, Phil Murphy, and law enforcement officials have stressed that the drones do not appear to threaten public safety. The FBI has been investigating and has asked residents to share any videos, photos or other information they may have. Two Republican Jersey Shore-area congressmen, Chris Smith and Jeff Van Drew, have called on the military to shoot down the drones. Smith said a coastguard commanding officer briefed him on an incident over the weekend in which a dozen drones followed a motorized coastguard lifeboat “in close pursuit” near Barnegat Light and Island Beach state park in Ocean county. Lt Luke Pinneo with the US Coast Guard told the Associated Press on Wednesday “that multiple low-altitude aircraft were observed in vicinity of one of our vessels near Island Beach state park”. The aircraft were not perceived as an immediate threat and did not disrupt operations, Pinneo said. The coastguard is assisting the FBI and state agencies in investigating. In a letter to the defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, Smith called for military help dealing with the drones, noting that Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst had the capability “to identify and take down unauthorized unmanned aerial systems”. However, a Pentagon spokesperson, Sabrina Singh, told reporters on Wednesday that “our initial assessment here is that these are not drones or activities coming from a foreign entity or adversary”. On Tuesday, the senators of New York and New Jersey issued a letter to the homeland security department, the Federal Aviation Administration and the FBI, demanding a briefing on the drone sightings as soon as possible. In the joint letter, Senators Kirsten Gillibrand, Chuck Schumer, Cory Booker and Andy Kim urged the government agencies to “brief us as soon as possible on how your agencies are working with federal and local law enforcement to identify and address the source of these incursions”. “In addition to potential privacy concerns raised by these aerial systems, we are also especially concerned about how these drones may harm public safety,” they said. “The potential safety and security risks posed by these drones in civilian areas is especially pertinent considering recent drone incursions at sensitive military sites in and outside of the continental United States over the past year … For this reason, we request that the briefing you provide also include any authorities, tools, or staff your agencies may require to address these ongoing incidents and the broader security challenge posed by UAS [unmanned aerial system(s)].” Meanwhile, Illinois’s Democratic representative Raja Krishnamoorthi said to NewsNation on Wednesday that he thought China might be conducting the drones in the US. Sign up to Headlines US Get the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning after newsletter promotion “It’s a non-trivial chance … It’s definitely a possibility, and the likelihood that they can then access data that is collected by these drones is very high,” he said. “You can easily imagine a situation where these drones are flying over sensitive sites in the DC airspace,” he added, referring to Chinese-made drones. Many municipal lawmakers have called for more restrictions on who is entitled to fly the unmanned devices. At least one state lawmaker proposed a temporary ban on drone flights in the state. “This is something we’re taking deadly seriously. I don’t blame people for being frustrated,” Murphy said earlier this week. A spokesperson for the Democratic governor said he did not attend Wednesday’s meeting. The Republican assemblyman Erik Peterson, whose district includes parts of the state where the drones have been reported, said he also attended Wednesday’s meeting at a state police facility in West Trenton. The session lasted for about 90 minutes. Peterson said DHS officials were generous with their time, but appeared dismissive of some concerns, saying not all the sightings reported had been confirmed to involve drones. So who or what is behind the flying objects? Where are they coming from? What are they doing? “My understanding is [officials] have no clue,” Peterson said. A message seeking comment was left with the Department of Homeland Security. Most of the drones have been spotted along coastal areas and some were recently reported flying over a large reservoir in Clinton. Sightings have also been reported in neighboring states. James Edwards, of Succasunna, New Jersey, said he had seen a few drones flying over his neighborhood since last month. “It raises concern mainly because there’s so much that’s unknown,” Edwards said on Wednesday. “There are lots of people spouting off about various conspiracies that they believe are in play here, but that only adds fuel to the fire unnecessarily. We need to wait and see what is really happening here, not let fear of the unknown overtake us.”",

They seem to take to the air mostly over Hunterdon and Morris counties at sunset, seemingly over areas of interest – Trump National Golf Club, Round Valley Reservoir and Picatinny Arsenal in Morris County – and ending around 11 p.m. That has led to widespread speculation and frustration from residents and public officials who are not receiving answers about the origins of the drones and if they present any potential danger. While Gov. Phil Murphy has said the drones pose no harm, that reassurance has done little to settle the nerves of residents who have been rattled by the drone sightings and are clamoring for answers from elected officials to President Joe Biden. Local officials have also expressed frustration about the lack of definitive word from federal government officials about the drones, information that could potentially quell rumors that the drones have a nefarious purpose or are on a clandestine mission from either the American government or a foreign adversary. Assemblyman Roy Freiman, D-Somerset, and Hillsborough Mayor Robert Briting in a joint statement urged residents to remain calm. “Our top priority is the safety and well-being of our residents,” Freiman stated. “We take these reports seriously because these drones are obviously not a child’s holiday toy. We will continue to coordinate with local, state, and federal authorities to investigate, and identify the source of the drone activity.” Though saying there is “no cause for alarm at this moment,” Britting said residents should report any suspicious drone activity to the FBI.

Cory Booker and Andy Kim, and U.S. Rep. Tom Kean to address the drone sightings and urged them to call upon the Department of Homeland Security, FBI, and the Federal Aviation Administration \"for greater transparency in communicating what is known about this surge in drone sightings” “The ongoing drone sightings near private homes, military installations, and critical infrastructure facilities throughout New Jersey cannot and should not be taken lightly,\" Kuhl said. \"Our residents deserve credible and meaningful answers to why swarms of drones are hovering outside their homes late at night.” Hunterdon County Public Safety Director Brayden Fahey and Hunterdon County Sheriff Fred Brown reported that drone sightings have been made around sensitive areas such as the Round Valley Reservoir, the county’s 911 center, radio transmission towers and in residential neighborhoods.“Should a public safety or national security threat be posed by these drones, there should be a Whole-of-Government Approach that includes partners at the state and local levels,\" Kuhl continued. Mayors of six northern Somerset County towns – Bedminster, Bernards Township, Bernardsville, Bridgewater, Far Hills and Peapack-Gladstone – have sent a joint letter to Gov. Murphy and Rep. Kean asking for more information about the drones that they can pass on to their residents. 'They couldn't give us a straight answer' The State Police held a meeting with local officials on Wednesday in Newark about the drone sightings, but many of those in attendance were frustrated with the lack of definitive answers. “We had a lot of discussion back and forth about where these drones are coming from,” said South River Mayor Pete Guindi. “They couldn’t give us a straight answer because they don’t know themselves.” More:What's so scary about NJ's drones? Maybe it's the word Ryan Herd, the mayor of the Morris County community of Pequannock, said on Facebook that while state officials could not say the origin or mission of the drones, they are not tied to high-tech large companies such as Google or Amazon, they said the drones are not related to the U.S. military.\" \"We must demand answers,\" Herd said. \"The safety and security of our community depend on it.\" Morris County Assemblyman Brian Bergen, who walked out of the meeting, said the briefing was \"worthless.\" \"It was the biggest amateur hour I've ever seen about anything,\" he said. Guindi said South River residents should report any sightings to authorities. “As a mayor, for my residents in town, as well as for residents of the state, I understand your concern and I value your concern because I’m questioning this, too,” Guindi said. “The best thing you can do is stay open minded and gather whatever facts you see. There is no reason for residents to take any action other than reporting what they see. Your facts can help lead to resolving this situation. Being accurate about your information means everything.” 'Shoot them down' The political outcry over the drones escalated Wednesday when U.S. Rep. Jeff Van Drew said in a press release that \"we cannot allow unidentified drones to operate freely in our airspace with no consequences and it is time we eliminate the threat they pose and shoot them down.\" The Cape May legislator speculated \"there is circumstantial evidence that suggests these drones could be the work of foreign adversaries, specifically Iran.\" More:NJ 'swarming drones' expert says U.S. military likely behind mystery Later Wednesday, Van Drew sent a letter to President Biden demanding immediate action by imposing flight restrictions and ordering the drones to be \"neutralized as soon as possible.\" \"While I remain open to alternate explanations,” Van Drew wrote, \"I have not been presented a single credible, cohesive narrative except for that Iran is controlling these drones from offshore.\" But a U.S. Department of Defense spokesperson rejected Van Drew's claims, saying there is no Iranian \"mothership\" off the coast, but still do not know the origin of the drones which were first sighted on Nov. 18. Adding to the speculation was U.S Rep. Chris Smith who said during a Congressional hearing on Tuesday and in an interview on Fox News, that he went drone-hunting at Island Beach State Park on Monday with Ocean County Sheriff Michael Mastronardy. Smith said they went to that beach because the night before, a law enforcement officer had counted 50 drones coming in from the ocean onto land. In addition, he said that he was told by a Coast Guard official that one of its 47-foot ships in the ocean was trailed by 12 to 30 drones. State Sen. Jon Bramnick, a Republican candidate for governor, called for a State of Emergency to be declared until the drone mystery is solved. On Wednesday morning, the Westfield legislator delivered an update on the situation, saying \"Unfortunately the State of New Jersey has very little information regarding the drones being seen. The Department of Defense must investigate and until that occurs we must shut down the airspace to drones. That would require a limited state of emergency and FAA cooperation.” Contributing: Staff Writer Susan Loyer Email: mdeak@mycentraljersey.com",

Under the tropical zodiac, the sun transits this sign between about May 21 to June 21.[3] Gemini is represented by the twins, Castor and Pollux,[4] known as the Dioscuri in Greek mythology. It is known as a positive, mutable sign. In Babylonian astronomy, the stars Pollux and Castor were known as the Great Twins. Their names were Lugal-irra and Meslamta-ea, meaning \"The Mighty King\" and \"The One who has arisen from the Underworld\". Both names are titles of Nergal. Also could be referencing Zeus and Hades.[5] In Greek mythology, Gemini is associated with the myth of Castor and Pollux, a pair of twins conceived by different fathers. Zeus, who seduced Leda and conceived Pollux while Tyndareus, the king of Sparta and Leda's husband, conceived Castor. When Castor died, because he was a mortal, Pollux begged his father Zeus to give Castor immortality, which was done through uniting them together in the heavens. NASA named its two-person space capsule Project Gemini after the zodiac sign because the spacecraft could carry two astronauts.[6] Google's next-generation AI model announced on December 6, 2023, is named Gemini.[7]",

Advertisement Gemini is the name of a constellation that is interpreted as representing a pair of twins. It is sometimes referred to as the Twins. A constellation is a group of stars that appear near each other in the sky—especially a group that has been given a name. Gemini is considered one of the 12 zodiacal constellations—constellations that appear within a particular portion of the sky called the zodiac. In astronomy, the zodiac is the band of sky along which the paths of the sun, the moon, and the planets appear to move. Despite its basis in astronomy, the word zodiac is mainly associated with and most often used in the context of astrology, the nonscientific practice in which the positions of heavenly bodies at certain times are thought to influence or be correlated with human behavior and events. In astrology, zodiac refers to a diagram (often a circular one) representing the zodiac belt and showing the symbols associated with each of the 12 constellations or sections, which are called the signs of the zodiac. Gemini is one of these signs. It is situated between Taurus and Cancer and is considered the third sign of the zodiac. The other signs of the zodiac are Aries, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces. The position of the sun in a particular portion of the zodiac at the moment of a person’s birth is thought to correlate with their personality. This is what people are referring to when they talk about their zodiac sign (or star sign or often just sign). People whose sign is Gemini are those born between May 21 and June 20. The word Gemini can be used as a noun to refer to someone who is born during this time, as in I was born in late May, so I’m a Gemini. The word Geminian can be used to mean the same thing. It can also be used as an adjective form of Gemini. The constellation is linked to the classical myth of the twins Castor and Pollux. The two brightest stars in Gemini are named after them. Gemini is also the name of a 1960s NASA program that involved multiple launches of a two-person spacecraft in preparation for the Apollo moon landings. Example: Even though I’m a Gemini, I don’t fit into the charismatic Gemini stereotype. People with the sign Gemini are traditionally considered to be those born in the range of May 21–June 20. However, interpretations vary. The first records of the word Gemini in English come from the 1300s. It comes from the Latin geminī, plural of geminus, meaning “twin.” In astrology, the different signs of the zodiac are thought to be associated with certain personality traits. People whose sign is Gemini are said to be charismatic and resourceful and to sometimes have a dual nature (in parallel with the twin stars of the constellation). Gemini and the other signs of the zodiac are often used in the context of a person’s horoscope. The word horoscope can refer to a diagram of the heavens that maps the relative position of planets and the signs of the zodiac. It can also refer to a prediction based (or said to be based) on a person’s sign and the location of other celestial bodies at the time they were born.

                "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI), in its broadest sense, is intelligence exhibited by machines, particularly computer systems. It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals.[1] Such machines may be called AIs. Some high-profile applications of AI include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search); recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix); interacting via human speech (e.g., Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa); autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo); generative and creative tools (e.g., ChatGPT, and AI art); and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go). However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: \"A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it's not labeled AI anymore.\"[2][3] The various subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics.[a] General intelligence—the ability to complete any task performed by a human on an at least equal level—is among the field's long-term goals.[4] To reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics.[b] AI also draws upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and other fields.[5] Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956,[6] and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism,[7][8] followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as AI winter.[9][10] Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when deep learning outperformed previous AI techniques.[11] This growth accelerated further after 2017 with the transformer architecture,[12] and by the early 2020s hundreds of billions of dollars were being invested in AI (known as the \"AI boom\"). The widespread use of AI in the 21st century exposed several unintended consequences and harms in the present and raised concerns about its risks and long-term effects in the future, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology. The general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken into subproblems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of AI research.[a] Early researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions.[13] By the late 1980s and 1990s, methods were developed for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information, employing concepts from probability and economics.[14] Many of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a \"combinatorial explosion\": They become exponentially slower as the problems grow.[15] Even humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early AI research could model. They solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments.[16] Accurate and efficient reasoning is an unsolved problem. Knowledge representation and knowledge engineering[17] allow AI programs to answer questions intelligently and make deductions about real-world facts. Formal knowledge representations are used in content-based indexing and retrieval,[18] scene interpretation,[19] clinical decision support,[20] knowledge discovery (mining \"interesting\" and actionable inferences from large databases),[21] and other areas.[22] A knowledge base is a body of knowledge represented in a form that can be used by a program. An ontology is the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties used by a particular domain of knowledge.[23] Knowledge bases need to represent things such as objects, properties, categories, and relations between objects;[24] situations, events, states, and time;[25] causes and effects;[26] knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know);[27] default reasoning (things that humans assume are true until they are told differently and will remain true even when other facts are changing);[28] and many other aspects and domains of knowledge. Among the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are the breadth of commonsense knowledge (the set of atomic facts that the average person knows is enormous);[29] and the sub-symbolic form of most commonsense knowledge (much of what people know is not represented as \"facts\" or \"statements\" that they could express verbally).[16] There is also the difficulty of knowledge acquisition, the problem of obtaining knowledge for AI applications.[c] An \"agent\" is anything that perceives and takes actions in the world. A rational agent has goals or preferences and takes actions to make them happen.[d][32] In automated planning, the agent has a specific goal.[33] In automated decision-making, the agent has preferences—there are some situations it would prefer to be in, and some situations it is trying to avoid. The decision-making agent assigns a number to each situation (called the \"utility\") that measures how much the agent prefers it. For each possible action, it can calculate the \"expected utility\": the utility of all possible outcomes of the action, weighted by the probability that the outcome will occur. It can then choose the action with the maximum expected utility.[34] In classical planning, the agent knows exactly what the effect of any action will be.[35] In most real-world problems, however, the agent may not be certain about the situation they are in (it is \"unknown\" or \"unobservable\") and it may not know for certain what will happen after each possible action (it is not \"deterministic\"). It must choose an action by making a probabilistic guess and then reassess the situation to see if the action worked.[36] In some problems, the agent's preferences may be uncertain, especially if there are other agents or humans involved. These can be learned (e.g., with inverse reinforcement learning), or the agent can seek information to improve its preferences.[37] Information value theory can be used to weigh the value of exploratory or experimental actions.[38] The space of possible future actions and situations is typically intractably large, so the agents must take actions and evaluate situations while being uncertain of what the outcome will be. A Markov decision process has a transition model that describes the probability that a particular action will change the state in a particular way and a reward function that supplies the utility of each state and the cost of each action. A policy associates a decision with each possible state. The policy could be calculated (e.g., by iteration), be heuristic, or it can be learned.[39] Game theory describes the rational behavior of multiple interacting agents and is used in AI programs that make decisions that involve other agents.[40] Machine learning is the study of programs that can improve their performance on a given task automatically.[41] It has been a part of AI from the beginning.[e] There are several kinds of machine learning. Unsupervised learning analyzes a stream of data and finds patterns and makes predictions without any other guidance.[44] Supervised learning requires labeling the training data with the expected answers, and comes in two main varieties: classification (where the program must learn to predict what category the input belongs in) and regression (where the program must deduce a numeric function based on numeric input).[45] In reinforcement learning, the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. The agent learns to choose responses that are classified as \"good\".[46] Transfer learning is when the knowledge gained from one problem is applied to a new problem.[47] Deep learning is a type of machine learning that runs inputs through biologically inspired artificial neural networks for all of these types of learning.[48] Computational learning theory can assess learners by computational complexity, by sample complexity (how much data is required), or by other notions of optimization.[49] Natural language processing (NLP)[50] allows programs to read, write and communicate in human languages such as English. Specific problems include speech recognition, speech synthesis, machine translation, information extraction, information retrieval and question answering.[51] Early work, based on Noam Chomsky's generative grammar and semantic networks, had difficulty with word-sense disambiguation[f] unless restricted to small domains called \"micro-worlds\" (due to the common sense knowledge problem[29]). Margaret Masterman believed that it was meaning and not grammar that was the key to understanding languages, and that thesauri and not dictionaries should be the basis of computational language structure. Modern deep learning techniques for NLP include word embedding (representing words, typically as vectors encoding their meaning),[52] transformers (a deep learning architecture using an attention mechanism),[53] and others.[54] In 2019, generative pre-trained transformer (or \"GPT\") language models began to generate coherent text,[55][56] and by 2023, these models were able to get human-level scores on the bar exam, SAT test, GRE test, and many other real-world applications.[57] Machine perception is the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras, microphones, wireless signals, active lidar, sonar, radar, and tactile sensors) to deduce aspects of the world. Computer vision is the ability to analyze visual input.[58] The field includes speech recognition,[59] image classification,[60] facial recognition, object recognition,[61]object tracking,[62] and robotic perception.[63] Affective computing is an interdisciplinary umbrella that comprises systems that recognize, interpret, process, or simulate human feeling, emotion, and mood.[65] For example, some virtual assistants are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously; it makes them appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction, or to otherwise facilitate human–computer interaction. However, this tends to give naïve users an unrealistic conception of the intelligence of existing computer agents.[66] Moderate successes related to affective computing include textual sentiment analysis and, more recently, multimodal sentiment analysis, wherein AI classifies the effects displayed by a videotaped subject.[67] A machine with artificial general intelligence should be able to solve a wide variety of problems with breadth and versatility similar to human intelligence.[4] AI research uses a wide variety of techniques to accomplish the goals above.[b] AI can solve many problems by intelligently searching through many possible solutions.[68] There are two very different kinds of search used in AI: state space search and local search. State space search searches through a tree of possible states to try to find a goal state.[69] For example, planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process called means-ends analysis.[70] Simple exhaustive searches[71] are rarely sufficient for most real-world problems: the search space (the number of places to search) quickly grows to astronomical numbers. The result is a search that is too slow or never completes.[15] \"Heuristics\" or \"rules of thumb\" can help prioritize choices that are more likely to reach a goal.[72] Adversarial search is used for game-playing programs, such as chess or Go. It searches through a tree of possible moves and countermoves, looking for a winning position.[73] Local search uses mathematical optimization to find a solution to a problem. It begins with some form of guess and refines it incrementally.[74] Gradient descent is a type of local search that optimizes a set of numerical parameters by incrementally adjusting them to minimize a loss function. Variants of gradient descent are commonly used to train neural networks.[75] Another type of local search is evolutionary computation, which aims to iteratively improve a set of candidate solutions by \"mutating\" and \"recombining\" them, selecting only the fittest to survive each generation.[76] Distributed search processes can coordinate via swarm intelligence algorithms. Two popular swarm algorithms used in search are particle swarm optimization (inspired by bird flocking) and ant colony optimization (inspired by ant trails).[77] Formal logic is used for reasoning and knowledge representation.[78] Formal logic comes in two main forms: propositional logic (which operates on statements that are true or false and uses logical connectives such as \"and\", \"or\", \"not\" and \"implies\")[79] and predicate logic (which also operates on objects, predicates and relations and uses quantifiers such as \"Every X is a Y\" and \"There are some Xs that are Ys\").[80] Deductive reasoning in logic is the process of proving a new statement (conclusion) from other statements that are given and assumed to be true (the premises).[81] Proofs can be structured as proof trees, in which nodes are labelled by sentences, and children nodes are connected to parent nodes by inference rules. Given a problem and a set of premises, problem-solving reduces to searching for a proof tree whose root node is labelled by a solution of the problem and whose leaf nodes are labelled by premises or axioms. In the case of Horn clauses, problem-solving search can be performed by reasoning forwards from the premises or backwards from the problem.[82] In the more general case of the clausal form of first-order logic, resolution is a single, axiom-free rule of inference, in which a problem is solved by proving a contradiction from premises that include the negation of the problem to be solved.[83] Inference in both Horn clause logic and first-order logic is undecidable, and therefore intractable. However, backward reasoning with Horn clauses, which underpins computation in the logic programming language Prolog, is Turing complete. Moreover, its efficiency is competitive with computation in other symbolic programming languages.[84] Fuzzy logic assigns a \"degree of truth\" between 0 and 1. It can therefore handle propositions that are vague and partially true.[85] Non-monotonic logics, including logic programming with negation as failure, are designed to handle default reasoning.[28] Other specialized versions of logic have been developed to describe many complex domains. Many problems in AI (including in reasoning, planning, learning, perception, and robotics) require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information. AI researchers have devised a number of tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics.[86] Precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan, using decision theory, decision analysis,[87] and information value theory.[88] These tools include models such as Markov decision processes,[89] dynamic decision networks,[90] game theory and mechanism design.[91] Bayesian networks[92] are a tool that can be used for reasoning (using the Bayesian inference algorithm),[g][94] learning (using the expectation–maximization algorithm),[h][96] planning (using decision networks)[97] and perception (using dynamic Bayesian networks).[90] Probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering, prediction, smoothing, and finding explanations for streams of data, thus helping perception systems analyze processes that occur over time (e.g., hidden Markov models or Kalman filters).[90] The simplest AI applications can be divided into two types: classifiers (e.g., \"if shiny then diamond\"), on one hand, and controllers (e.g., \"if diamond then pick up\"), on the other hand. Classifiers[98] are functions that use pattern matching to determine the closest match. They can be fine-tuned based on chosen examples using supervised learning. Each pattern (also called an \"observation\") is labeled with a certain predefined class. All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set. When a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience.[45] There are many kinds of classifiers in use.[99] The decision tree is the simplest and most widely used symbolic machine learning algorithm.[100] K-nearest neighbor algorithm was the most widely used analogical AI until the mid-1990s, and Kernel methods such as the support vector machine (SVM) displaced k-nearest neighbor in the 1990s.[101] The naive Bayes classifier is reportedly the \"most widely used learner\"[102] at Google, due in part to its scalability.[103] Neural networks are also used as classifiers.[104] An artificial neural network is based on a collection of nodes also known as artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. It is trained to recognise patterns; once trained, it can recognise those patterns in fresh data. There is an input, at least one hidden layer of nodes and an output. Each node applies a function and once the weight crosses its specified threshold, the data is transmitted to the next layer. A network is typically called a deep neural network if it has at least 2 hidden layers.[104] Learning algorithms for neural networks use local search to choose the weights that will get the right output for each input during training. The most common training technique is the backpropagation algorithm.[105] Neural networks learn to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs and find patterns in data. In theory, a neural network can learn any function.[106] In feedforward neural networks the signal passes in only one direction.[107] Recurrent neural networks feed the output signal back into the input, which allows short-term memories of previous input events. Long short term memory is the most successful network architecture for recurrent networks.[108] Perceptrons[109] use only a single layer of neurons; deep learning[110] uses multiple layers. Convolutional neural networks strengthen the connection between neurons that are \"close\" to each other—this is especially important in image processing, where a local set of neurons must identify an \"edge\" before the network can identify an object.[111] Deep learning[110] uses several layers of neurons between the network's inputs and outputs. The multiple layers can progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input. For example, in image processing, lower layers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits, letters, or faces.[112] Deep learning has profoundly improved the performance of programs in many important subfields of artificial intelligence, including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, image classification,[113] and others. The reason that deep learning performs so well in so many applications is not known as of 2023.[114] The sudden success of deep learning in 2012–2015 did not occur because of some new discovery or theoretical breakthrough (deep neural networks and backpropagation had been described by many people, as far back as the 1950s)[i] but because of two factors: the incredible increase in computer power (including the hundred-fold increase in speed by switching to GPUs) and the availability of vast amounts of training data, especially the giant curated datasets used for benchmark testing, such as ImageNet.[j] Generative pre-trained transformers (GPT) are large language models (LLMs) that generate text based on the semantic relationships between words in sentences. Text-based GPT models are pretrained on a large corpus of text that can be from the Internet. The pretraining consists of predicting the next token (a token being usually a word, subword, or punctuation). Throughout this pretraining, GPT models accumulate knowledge about the world and can then generate human-like text by repeatedly predicting the next token. Typically, a subsequent training phase makes the model more truthful, useful, and harmless, usually with a technique called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Current GPT models are prone to generating falsehoods called \"hallucinations\", although this can be reduced with RLHF and quality data. They are used in chatbots, which allow people to ask a question or request a task in simple text.[122][123] Current models and services include Gemini (formerly Bard), ChatGPT, Grok, Claude, Copilot, and LLaMA.[124] Multimodal GPT models can process different types of data (modalities) such as images, videos, sound, and text.[125] In the late 2010s, graphics processing units (GPUs) that were increasingly designed with AI-specific enhancements and used with specialized TensorFlow software had replaced previously used central processing unit (CPUs) as the dominant means for large-scale (commercial and academic) machine learning models' training.[126] Specialized programming languages such as Prolog were used in early AI research,[127] but general-purpose programming languages like Python have become predominant.[128] The transistor density in integrated circuits has been observed to roughly double every 18 months—a trend known as Moore's law, named after the Intel co-founder Gordon Moore, who first identified it. Improvements in GPUs have been even faster.[129] AI and machine learning technology is used in most of the essential applications of the 2020s, including: search engines (such as Google Search), targeting online advertisements, recommendation systems (offered by Netflix, YouTube or Amazon), driving internet traffic, targeted advertising (AdSense, Facebook), virtual assistants (such as Siri or Alexa), autonomous vehicles (including drones, ADAS and self-driving cars), automatic language translation (Microsoft Translator, Google Translate), facial recognition (Apple's Face ID or Microsoft's DeepFace and Google's FaceNet) and image labeling (used by Facebook, Apple's iPhoto and TikTok). The deployment of AI may be overseen by a Chief automation officer (CAO). The application of AI in medicine and medical research has the potential to increase patient care and quality of life.[130] Through the lens of the Hippocratic Oath, medical professionals are ethically compelled to use AI, if applications can more accurately diagnose and treat patients.[131][132] For medical research, AI is an important tool for processing and integrating big data. This is particularly important for organoid and tissue engineering development which use microscopy imaging as a key technique in fabrication.[133] It has been suggested that AI can overcome discrepancies in funding allocated to different fields of research.[133] New AI tools can deepen the understanding of biomedically relevant pathways. For example, AlphaFold 2 (2021) demonstrated the ability to approximate, in hours rather than months, the 3D structure of a protein.[134] In 2023, it was reported that AI-guided drug discovery helped find a class of antibiotics capable of killing two different types of drug-resistant bacteria.[135] In 2024, researchers used machine learning to accelerate the search for Parkinson's disease drug treatments. Their aim was to identify compounds that block the clumping, or aggregation, of alpha-synuclein (the protein that characterises Parkinson's disease). They were able to speed up the initial screening process ten-fold and reduce the cost by a thousand-fold.[136][137] Applications of AI in this domain include AI-enabled menstruation and fertility trackers that analyze user data to offer prediction,[138] AI-integrated sex toys (e.g., teledildonics),[139] AI-generated sexual education content,[140] and AI agents that simulate sexual and romantic partners (e.g., Replika).[141] AI is also used for the production of non-consensual deepfake pornography, raising significant ethical and legal concerns.[142] AI technologies have also been used to attempt to identify online gender-based violence and online sexual grooming of minors.[143][144] Game playing programs have been used since the 1950s to demonstrate and test AI's most advanced techniques.[145] Deep Blue became the first computer chess-playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion, Garry Kasparov, on 11 May 1997.[146] In 2011, in a Jeopardy! quiz show exhibition match, IBM's question answering system, Watson, defeated the two greatest Jeopardy! champions, Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings, by a significant margin.[147] In March 2016, AlphaGo won 4 out of 5 games of Go in a match with Go champion Lee Sedol, becoming the first computer Go-playing system to beat a professional Go player without handicaps. Then, in 2017, it defeated Ke Jie, who was the best Go player in the world.[148] Other programs handle imperfect-information games, such as the poker-playing program Pluribus.[149] DeepMind developed increasingly generalistic reinforcement learning models, such as with MuZero, which could be trained to play chess, Go, or Atari games.[150] In 2019, DeepMind's AlphaStar achieved grandmaster level in StarCraft II, a particularly challenging real-time strategy game that involves incomplete knowledge of what happens on the map.[151] In 2021, an AI agent competed in a PlayStation Gran Turismo competition, winning against four of the world's best Gran Turismo drivers using deep reinforcement learning.[152] In 2024, Google DeepMind introduced SIMA, a type of AI capable of autonomously playing nine previously unseen open-world video games by observing screen output, as well as executing short, specific tasks in response to natural language instructions.[153] In mathematics, special forms of formal step-by-step reasoning are used.[154] In contrast, LLMs such as GPT-4 Turbo, Gemini Ultra, Claude Opus, LLaMa-2 or Mistral Large are working with probabilistic models, which can produce wrong answers in the form of hallucinations. Therefore, they need not only a large database of mathematical problems to learn from but also methods such as supervised fine-tuning or trained classifiers with human-annotated data to improve answers for new problems and learn from corrections.[155] A 2024 study showed that the performance of some language models for reasoning capabilities in solving math problems not included in their training data was low, even for problems with only minor deviations from trained data.[156] Alternatively, dedicated models for mathematical problem solving with higher precision for the outcome including proof of theorems have been developed such as Alpha Tensor, Alpha Geometry and Alpha Proof all from Google DeepMind,[157] Llemma from eleuther[158] or Julius.[159] When natural language is used to describe mathematical problems, converters transform such prompts into a formal language such as Lean to define mathematical tasks. Some models have been developed to solve challenging problems and reach good results in benchmark tests, others to serve as educational tools in mathematics.[160] Finance is one of the fastest growing sectors where applied AI tools are being deployed: from retail online banking to investment advice and insurance, where automated \"robot advisers\" have been in use for some years.[161] World Pensions experts like Nicolas Firzli insist it may be too early to see the emergence of highly innovative AI-informed financial products and services: \"the deployment of AI tools will simply further automatise things: destroying tens of thousands of jobs in banking, financial planning, and pension advice in the process, but I'm not sure it will unleash a new wave of [e.g., sophisticated] pension innovation.\"[162] Various countries are deploying AI military applications.[163] The main applications enhance command and control, communications, sensors, integration and interoperability.[164] Research is targeting intelligence collection and analysis, logistics, cyber operations, information operations, and semiautonomous and autonomous vehicles.[163] AI technologies enable coordination of sensors and effectors, threat detection and identification, marking of enemy positions, target acquisition, coordination and deconfliction of distributed Joint Fires between networked combat vehicles involving manned and unmanned teams.[164] AI was incorporated into military operations in Iraq and Syria.[163] In November 2023, US Vice President Kamala Harris disclosed a declaration signed by 31 nations to set guardrails for the military use of AI. The commitments include using legal reviews to ensure the compliance of military AI with international laws, and being cautious and transparent in the development of this technology.[165] In the early 2020s, generative AI gained widespread prominence. GenAI is AI capable of generating text, images, videos, or other data using generative models,[166][167] often in response to prompts.[168][169] In March 2023, 58% of U.S. adults had heard about ChatGPT and 14% had tried it.[170] The increasing realism and ease-of-use of AI-based text-to-image generators such as Midjourney, DALL-E, and Stable Diffusion sparked a trend of viral AI-generated photos. Widespread attention was gained by a fake photo of Pope Francis wearing a white puffer coat, the fictional arrest of Donald Trump, and a hoax of an attack on the Pentagon, as well as the usage in professional creative arts.[171][172] Artificial intelligent (AI) agents are software entities designed to perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions autonomously to achieve specific goals. These agents can interact with users, their environment, or other agents. AI agents are used in various applications, including virtual assistants, chatbots, autonomous vehicles, game-playing systems, and industrial robotics. AI agents operate within the constraints of their programming, available computational resources, and hardware limitations. This means they are restricted to performing tasks within their defined scope and have finite memory and processing capabilities. In real-world applications, AI agents often face time constraints for decision-making and action execution. Many AI agents incorporate learning algorithms, enabling them to improve their performance over time through experience or training. Using machine learning, AI agents can adapt to new situations and optimise their behaviour for their designated tasks.[173][174][175] There are also thousands of successful AI applications used to solve specific problems for specific industries or institutions. In a 2017 survey, one in five companies reported having incorporated \"AI\" in some offerings or processes.[176] A few examples are energy storage, medical diagnosis, military logistics, applications that predict the result of judicial decisions, foreign policy, or supply chain management. AI applications for evacuation and disaster management are growing. AI has been used to investigate if and how people evacuated in large scale and small scale evacuations using historical data from GPS, videos or social media. Further, AI can provide real time information on the real time evacuation conditions.[177][178][179] In agriculture, AI has helped farmers identify areas that need irrigation, fertilization, pesticide treatments or increasing yield. Agronomists use AI to conduct research and development. AI has been used to predict the ripening time for crops such as tomatoes, monitor soil moisture, operate agricultural robots, conduct predictive analytics, classify livestock pig call emotions, automate greenhouses, detect diseases and pests, and save water. Artificial intelligence is used in astronomy to analyze increasing amounts of available data and applications, mainly for \"classification, regression, clustering, forecasting, generation, discovery, and the development of new scientific insights.\" For example, it is used for discovering exoplanets, forecasting solar activity, and distinguishing between signals and instrumental effects in gravitational wave astronomy. Additionally, it could be used for activities in space, such as space exploration, including the analysis of data from space missions, real-time science decisions of spacecraft, space debris avoidance, and more autonomous operation. During the 2024 Indian elections, US$50 millions was spent on authorized AI-generated content, notably by creating deepfakes of allied (including sometimes deceased) politicians to better engage with voters, and by translating speeches to various local languages.[180] AI has potential benefits and potential risks.[181] AI may be able to advance science and find solutions for serious problems: Demis Hassabis of DeepMind hopes to \"solve intelligence, and then use that to solve everything else\".[182] However, as the use of AI has become widespread, several unintended consequences and risks have been identified.[183] In-production systems can sometimes not factor ethics and bias into their AI training processes, especially when the AI algorithms are inherently unexplainable in deep learning.[184] Machine learning algorithms require large amounts of data. The techniques used to acquire this data have raised concerns about privacy, surveillance and copyright. AI-powered devices and services, such as virtual assistants and IoT products, continuously collect personal information, raising concerns about intrusive data gathering and unauthorized access by third parties. The loss of privacy is further exacerbated by AI's ability to process and combine vast amounts of data, potentially leading to a surveillance society where individual activities are constantly monitored and analyzed without adequate safeguards or transparency. Sensitive user data collected may include online activity records, geolocation data, video or audio.[185] For example, in order to build speech recognition algorithms, Amazon has recorded millions of private conversations and allowed temporary workers to listen to and transcribe some of them.[186] Opinions about this widespread surveillance range from those who see it as a necessary evil to those for whom it is clearly unethical and a violation of the right to privacy.[187] AI developers argue that this is the only way to deliver valuable applications. and have developed several techniques that attempt to preserve privacy while still obtaining the data, such as data aggregation, de-identification and differential privacy.[188] Since 2016, some privacy experts, such as Cynthia Dwork, have begun to view privacy in terms of fairness. Brian Christian wrote that experts have pivoted \"from the question of 'what they know' to the question of 'what they're doing with it'.\"[189] Generative AI is often trained on unlicensed copyrighted works, including in domains such as images or computer code; the output is then used under the rationale of \"fair use\". Experts disagree about how well and under what circumstances this rationale will hold up in courts of law; relevant factors may include \"the purpose and character of the use of the copyrighted work\" and \"the effect upon the potential market for the copyrighted work\".[190][191] Website owners who do not wish to have their content scraped can indicate it in a \"robots.txt\" file.[192] In 2023, leading authors (including John Grisham and Jonathan Franzen) sued AI companies for using their work to train generative AI.[193][194] Another discussed approach is to envision a separate sui generis system of protection for creations generated by AI to ensure fair attribution and compensation for human authors.[195] The commercial AI scene is dominated by Big Tech companies such as Alphabet Inc., Amazon, Apple Inc., Meta Platforms, and Microsoft.[196][197][198] Some of these players already own the vast majority of existing cloud infrastructure and computing power from data centers, allowing them to entrench further in the marketplace.[199][200] In January 2024, the International Energy Agency (IEA) released Electricity 2024, Analysis and Forecast to 2026, forecasting electric power use.[201] This is the first IEA report to make projections for data centers and power consumption for artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency. The report states that power demand for these uses might double by 2026, with additional electric power usage equal to electricity used by the whole Japanese nation.[202] Prodigious power consumption by AI is responsible for the growth of fossil fuels use, and might delay closings of obsolete, carbon-emitting coal energy facilities. There is a feverish rise in the construction of data centers throughout the US, making large technology firms (e.g., Microsoft, Meta, Google, Amazon) into voracious consumers of electric power. Projected electric consumption is so immense that there is concern that it will be fulfilled no matter the source. A ChatGPT search involves the use of 10 times the electrical energy as a Google search. The large firms are in haste to find power sources – from nuclear energy to geothermal to fusion. The tech firms argue that – in the long view – AI will be eventually kinder to the environment, but they need the energy now. AI makes the power grid more efficient and \"intelligent\", will assist in the growth of nuclear power, and track overall carbon emissions, according to technology firms.[203] A 2024 Goldman Sachs Research Paper, AI Data Centers and the Coming US Power Demand Surge, found \"US power demand (is) likely to experience growth not seen in a generation....\" and forecasts that, by 2030, US data centers will consume 8% of US power, as opposed to 3% in 2022, presaging growth for the electrical power generation industry by a variety of means.[204] Data centers' need for more and more electrical power is such that they might max out the electrical grid. The Big Tech companies counter that AI can be used to maximize the utilization of the grid by all.[205] In 2024, the Wall Street Journal reported that big AI companies have begun negotiations with the US nuclear power providers to provide electricity to the data centers. In March 2024 Amazon purchased a Pennsylvania nuclear-powered data center for $650 Million (US).[206] Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang said nuclear power is a good option for the data centers.[207] In September 2024, Microsoft announced an agreement with Constellation Energy to re-open the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant to provide Microsoft with 100% of all electric power produced by the plant for 20 years. Reopening the plant, which suffered a partial nuclear meltdown of its Unit 2 reactor in 1979, will require Constellation to get through strict regulatory processes which will include extensive safety scrutiny from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission. If approved (this will be the first ever US re-commissioning of a nuclear plant), over 835 megawatts of power – enough for 800,000 homes – of energy will be produced. The cost for re-opening and upgrading is estimated at $1.6 billion (US) and is dependent on tax breaks for nuclear power contained in the 2022 US Inflation Reduction Act.[208] The US government and the state of Michigan are investing almost $2 billion (US) to reopen the Palisades Nuclear reactor on Lake Michigan. Closed since 2022, the plant is planned to be reopened in October 2025. The Three Mile Island facility will be renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center after Chris Crane, a nuclear proponent and former CEO of Exelon who was responsible for Exelon spinoff of Constellation.[209] After the last approval in September 2023, Taiwan suspended the approval of data centers north of Taoyuan with a capacity of more than 5 MW in 2024, due to power supply shortages.[210] Taiwan aims to phase out nuclear power by 2025.[210] On the other hand, Singapore imposed a ban on the opening of data centers in 2019 due to electric power, but in 2022, lifted this ban.[210] Although most nuclear plants in Japan have been shut down after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident, according to an October 2024 Bloomberg article in Japanese, cloud gaming services company Ubitus, in which Nvidia has a stake, is looking for land in Japan near nuclear power plant for a new data center for generative AI.[211] Ubitus CEO Wesley Kuo said nuclear power plants are the most efficient, cheap and stable power for AI.[211] On 1 November 2024, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) rejected an application submitted by Talen Energy for approval to supply some electricity from the nuclear power station Susquehanna to Amazon's data center.[212] According to the Commission Chairman Willie L. Phillips, it is a burden on the electricity grid as well as a significant cost shifting concern to households and other business sectors.[212] YouTube, Facebook and others use recommender systems to guide users to more content. These AI programs were given the goal of maximizing user engagement (that is, the only goal was to keep people watching). The AI learned that users tended to choose misinformation, conspiracy theories, and extreme partisan content, and, to keep them watching, the AI recommended more of it. Users also tended to watch more content on the same subject, so the AI led people into filter bubbles where they received multiple versions of the same misinformation.[213] This convinced many users that the misinformation was true, and ultimately undermined trust in institutions, the media and the government.[214] The AI program had correctly learned to maximize its goal, but the result was harmful to society. After the U.S. election in 2016, major technology companies took steps to mitigate the problem [citation needed]. In 2022, generative AI began to create images, audio, video and text that are indistinguishable from real photographs, recordings, films, or human writing. It is possible for bad actors to use this technology to create massive amounts of misinformation or propaganda.[215] AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton expressed concern about AI enabling \"authoritarian leaders to manipulate their electorates\" on a large scale, among other risks.[216] Machine learning applications will be biased[k] if they learn from biased data.[218] The developers may not be aware that the bias exists.[219] Bias can be introduced by the way training data is selected and by the way a model is deployed.[220][218] If a biased algorithm is used to make decisions that can seriously harm people (as it can in medicine, finance, recruitment, housing or policing) then the algorithm may cause discrimination.[221] The field of fairness studies how to prevent harms from algorithmic biases. On June 28, 2015, Google Photos's new image labeling feature mistakenly identified Jacky Alcine and a friend as \"gorillas\" because they were black. The system was trained on a dataset that contained very few images of black people,[222] a problem called \"sample size disparity\".[223] Google \"fixed\" this problem by preventing the system from labelling anything as a \"gorilla\". Eight years later, in 2023, Google Photos still could not identify a gorilla, and neither could similar products from Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon.[224] COMPAS is a commercial program widely used by U.S. courts to assess the likelihood of a defendant becoming a recidivist. In 2016, Julia Angwin at ProPublica discovered that COMPAS exhibited racial bias, despite the fact that the program was not told the races of the defendants. Although the error rate for both whites and blacks was calibrated equal at exactly 61%, the errors for each race were different—the system consistently overestimated the chance that a black person would re-offend and would underestimate the chance that a white person would not re-offend.[225] In 2017, several researchers[l] showed that it was mathematically impossible for COMPAS to accommodate all possible measures of fairness when the base rates of re-offense were different for whites and blacks in the data.[227] A program can make biased decisions even if the data does not explicitly mention a problematic feature (such as \"race\" or \"gender\"). The feature will correlate with other features (like \"address\", \"shopping history\" or \"first name\"), and the program will make the same decisions based on these features as it would on \"race\" or \"gender\".[228] Moritz Hardt said \"the most robust fact in this research area is that fairness through blindness doesn't work.\"[229] Criticism of COMPAS highlighted that machine learning models are designed to make \"predictions\" that are only valid if we assume that the future will resemble the past. If they are trained on data that includes the results of racist decisions in the past, machine learning models must predict that racist decisions will be made in the future. If an application then uses these predictions as recommendations, some of these \"recommendations\" will likely be racist.[230] Thus, machine learning is not well suited to help make decisions in areas where there is hope that the future will be better than the past. It is descriptive rather than prescriptive.[m] Bias and unfairness may go undetected because the developers are overwhelmingly white and male: among AI engineers, about 4% are black and 20% are women.[223] There are various conflicting definitions and mathematical models of fairness. These notions depend on ethical assumptions, and are influenced by beliefs about society. One broad category is distributive fairness, which focuses on the outcomes, often identifying groups and seeking to compensate for statistical disparities. Representational fairness tries to ensure that AI systems do not reinforce negative stereotypes or render certain groups invisible. Procedural fairness focuses on the decision process rather than the outcome. The most relevant notions of fairness may depend on the context, notably the type of AI application and the stakeholders. The subjectivity in the notions of bias and fairness makes it difficult for companies to operationalize them. Having access to sensitive attributes such as race or gender is also considered by many AI ethicists to be necessary in order to compensate for biases, but it may conflict with anti-discrimination laws.[217] At its 2022 Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (ACM FAccT 2022), the Association for Computing Machinery, in Seoul, South Korea, presented and published findings that recommend that until AI and robotics systems are demonstrated to be free of bias mistakes, they are unsafe, and the use of self-learning neural networks trained on vast, unregulated sources of flawed internet data should be curtailed.[dubious – discuss][232] Many AI systems are so complex that their designers cannot explain how they reach their decisions.[233] Particularly with deep neural networks, in which there are a large amount of non-linear relationships between inputs and outputs. But some popular explainability techniques exist.[234] It is impossible to be certain that a program is operating correctly if no one knows how exactly it works. There have been many cases where a machine learning program passed rigorous tests, but nevertheless learned something different than what the programmers intended. For example, a system that could identify skin diseases better than medical professionals was found to actually have a strong tendency to classify images with a ruler as \"cancerous\", because pictures of malignancies typically include a ruler to show the scale.[235] Another machine learning system designed to help effectively allocate medical resources was found to classify patients with asthma as being at \"low risk\" of dying from pneumonia. Having asthma is actually a severe risk factor, but since the patients having asthma would usually get much more medical care, they were relatively unlikely to die according to the training data. The correlation between asthma and low risk of dying from pneumonia was real, but misleading.[236] People who have been harmed by an algorithm's decision have a right to an explanation.[237] Doctors, for example, are expected to clearly and completely explain to their colleagues the reasoning behind any decision they make. Early drafts of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation in 2016 included an explicit statement that this right exists.[n] Industry experts noted that this is an unsolved problem with no solution in sight. Regulators argued that nevertheless the harm is real: if the problem has no solution, the tools should not be used.[238] DARPA established the XAI (\"Explainable Artificial Intelligence\") program in 2014 to try to solve these problems.[239] Several approaches aim to address the transparency problem. SHAP enables to visualise the contribution of each feature to the output.[240] LIME can locally approximate a model's outputs with a simpler, interpretable model.[241] Multitask learning provides a large number of outputs in addition to the target classification. These other outputs can help developers deduce what the network has learned.[242] Deconvolution, DeepDream and other generative methods can allow developers to see what different layers of a deep network for computer vision have learned, and produce output that can suggest what the network is learning.[243] For generative pre-trained transformers, Anthropic developed a technique based on dictionary learning that associates patterns of neuron activations with human-understandable concepts.[244] Artificial intelligence provides a number of tools that are useful to bad actors, such as authoritarian governments, terrorists, criminals or rogue states. A lethal autonomous weapon is a machine that locates, selects and engages human targets without human supervision.[o] Widely available AI tools can be used by bad actors to develop inexpensive autonomous weapons and, if produced at scale, they are potentially weapons of mass destruction.[246] Even when used in conventional warfare, it is unlikely that they will be unable to reliably choose targets and could potentially kill an innocent person.[246] In 2014, 30 nations (including China) supported a ban on autonomous weapons under the United Nations' Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, however the United States and others disagreed.[247] By 2015, over fifty countries were reported to be researching battlefield robots.[248] AI tools make it easier for authoritarian governments to efficiently control their citizens in several ways. Face and voice recognition allow widespread surveillance. Machine learning, operating this data, can classify potential enemies of the state and prevent them from hiding. Recommendation systems can precisely target propaganda and misinformation for maximum effect. Deepfakes and generative AI aid in producing misinformation. Advanced AI can make authoritarian centralized decision making more competitive than liberal and decentralized systems such as markets. It lowers the cost and difficulty of digital warfare and advanced spyware.[249] All these technologies have been available since 2020 or earlier—AI facial recognition systems are already being used for mass surveillance in China.[250][251] There many other ways that AI is expected to help bad actors, some of which can not be foreseen. For example, machine-learning AI is able to design tens of thousands of toxic molecules in a matter of hours.[252] Economists have frequently highlighted the risks of redundancies from AI, and speculated about unemployment if there is no adequate social policy for full employment.[253] In the past, technology has tended to increase rather than reduce total employment, but economists acknowledge that \"we're in uncharted territory\" with AI.[254] A survey of economists showed disagreement about whether the increasing use of robots and AI will cause a substantial increase in long-term unemployment, but they generally agree that it could be a net benefit if productivity gains are redistributed.[255] Risk estimates vary; for example, in the 2010s, Michael Osborne and Carl Benedikt Frey estimated 47% of U.S. jobs are at \"high risk\" of potential automation, while an OECD report classified only 9% of U.S. jobs as \"high risk\".[p][257] The methodology of speculating about future employment levels has been criticised as lacking evidential foundation, and for implying that technology, rather than social policy, creates unemployment, as opposed to redundancies.[253] In April 2023, it was reported that 70% of the jobs for Chinese video game illustrators had been eliminated by generative artificial intelligence.[258][259] Unlike previous waves of automation, many middle-class jobs may be eliminated by artificial intelligence; The Economist stated in 2015 that \"the worry that AI could do to white-collar jobs what steam power did to blue-collar ones during the Industrial Revolution\" is \"worth taking seriously\".[260] Jobs at extreme risk range from paralegals to fast food cooks, while job demand is likely to increase for care-related professions ranging from personal healthcare to the clergy.[261] From the early days of the development of artificial intelligence, there have been arguments, for example, those put forward by Joseph Weizenbaum, about whether tasks that can be done by computers actually should be done by them, given the difference between computers and humans, and between quantitative calculation and qualitative, value-based judgement.[262] It has been argued AI will become so powerful that humanity may irreversibly lose control of it. This could, as physicist Stephen Hawking stated, \"spell the end of the human race\".[263] This scenario has been common in science fiction, when a computer or robot suddenly develops a human-like \"self-awareness\" (or \"sentience\" or \"consciousness\") and becomes a malevolent character.[q] These sci-fi scenarios are misleading in several ways. First, AI does not require human-like \"sentience\" to be an existential risk. Modern AI programs are given specific goals and use learning and intelligence to achieve them. Philosopher Nick Bostrom argued that if one gives almost any goal to a sufficiently powerful AI, it may choose to destroy humanity to achieve it (he used the example of a paperclip factory manager).[265] Stuart Russell gives the example of household robot that tries to find a way to kill its owner to prevent it from being unplugged, reasoning that \"you can't fetch the coffee if you're dead.\"[266] In order to be safe for humanity, a superintelligence would have to be genuinely aligned with humanity's morality and values so that it is \"fundamentally on our side\".[267] Second, Yuval Noah Harari argues that AI does not require a robot body or physical control to pose an existential risk. The essential parts of civilization are not physical. Things like ideologies, law, government, money and the economy are made of language; they exist because there are stories that billions of people believe. The current prevalence of misinformation suggests that an AI could use language to convince people to believe anything, even to take actions that are destructive.[268] The opinions amongst experts and industry insiders are mixed, with sizable fractions both concerned and unconcerned by risk from eventual superintelligent AI.[269] Personalities such as Stephen Hawking, Bill Gates, and Elon Musk,[270] as well as AI pioneers such as Yoshua Bengio, Stuart Russell, Demis Hassabis, and Sam Altman, have expressed concerns about existential risk from AI. In May 2023, Geoffrey Hinton announced his resignation from Google in order to be able to \"freely speak out about the risks of AI\" without \"considering how this impacts Google.\"[271] He notably mentioned risks of an AI takeover,[272] and stressed that in order to avoid the worst outcomes, establishing safety guidelines will require cooperation among those competing in use of AI.[273] In 2023, many leading AI experts issued the joint statement that \"Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war\".[274] Other researchers, however, spoke in favor of a less dystopian view. AI pioneer Juergen Schmidhuber did not sign the joint statement, emphasising that in 95% of all cases, AI research is about making \"human lives longer and healthier and easier.\"[275] While the tools that are now being used to improve lives can also be used by bad actors, \"they can also be used against the bad actors.\"[276][277] Andrew Ng also argued that \"it's a mistake to fall for the doomsday hype on AI—and that regulators who do will only benefit vested interests.\"[278] Yann LeCun \"scoffs at his peers' dystopian scenarios of supercharged misinformation and even, eventually, human extinction.\"[279] In the early 2010s, experts argued that the risks are too distant in the future to warrant research or that humans will be valuable from the perspective of a superintelligent machine.[280] However, after 2016, the study of current and future risks and possible solutions became a serious area of research.[281] Friendly AI are machines that have been designed from the beginning to minimize risks and to make choices that benefit humans. Eliezer Yudkowsky, who coined the term, argues that developing friendly AI should be a higher research priority: it may require a large investment and it must be completed before AI becomes an existential risk.[282] Machines with intelligence have the potential to use their intelligence to make ethical decisions. The field of machine ethics provides machines with ethical principles and procedures for resolving ethical dilemmas.[283] The field of machine ethics is also called computational morality,[283] and was founded at an AAAI symposium in 2005.[284] Other approaches include Wendell Wallach's \"artificial moral agents\"[285] and Stuart J. Russell's three principles for developing provably beneficial machines.[286] Active organizations in the AI open-source community include Hugging Face,[287] Google,[288] EleutherAI and Meta.[289] Various AI models, such as Llama 2, Mistral or Stable Diffusion, have been made open-weight,[290][291] meaning that their architecture and trained parameters (the \"weights\") are publicly available. Open-weight models can be freely fine-tuned, which allows companies to specialize them with their own data and for their own use-case.[292] Open-weight models are useful for research and innovation but can also be misused. Since they can be fine-tuned, any built-in security measure, such as objecting to harmful requests, can be trained away until it becomes ineffective. Some researchers warn that future AI models may develop dangerous capabilities (such as the potential to drastically facilitate bioterrorism) and that once released on the Internet, they cannot be deleted everywhere if needed. They recommend pre-release audits and cost-benefit analyses.[293] Artificial Intelligence projects can have their ethical permissibility tested while designing, developing, and implementing an AI system. An AI framework such as the Care and Act Framework containing the SUM values—developed by the Alan Turing Institute tests projects in four main areas:[294][295] Other developments in ethical frameworks include those decided upon during the Asilomar Conference, the Montreal Declaration for Responsible AI, and the IEEE's Ethics of Autonomous Systems initiative, among others;[296] however, these principles do not go without their criticisms, especially regards to the people chosen contributes to these frameworks.[297] Promotion of the wellbeing of the people and communities that these technologies affect requires consideration of the social and ethical implications at all stages of AI system design, development and implementation, and collaboration between job roles such as data scientists, product managers, data engineers, domain experts, and delivery managers.[298] The UK AI Safety Institute released in 2024 a testing toolset called 'Inspect' for AI safety evaluations available under a MIT open-source licence which is freely available on GitHub and can be improved with third-party packages. It can be used to evaluate AI models in a range of areas including core knowledge, ability to reason, and autonomous capabilities.[299] The regulation of artificial intelligence is the development of public sector policies and laws for promoting and regulating AI; it is therefore related to the broader regulation of algorithms.[300] The regulatory and policy landscape for AI is an emerging issue in jurisdictions globally.[301] According to AI Index at Stanford, the annual number of AI-related laws passed in the 127 survey countries jumped from one passed in 2016 to 37 passed in 2022 alone.[302][303] Between 2016 and 2020, more than 30 countries adopted dedicated strategies for AI.[304] Most EU member states had released national AI strategies, as had Canada, China, India, Japan, Mauritius, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, U.S., and Vietnam. Others were in the process of elaborating their own AI strategy, including Bangladesh, Malaysia and Tunisia.[304] The Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence was launched in June 2020, stating a need for AI to be developed in accordance with human rights and democratic values, to ensure public confidence and trust in the technology.[304] Henry Kissinger, Eric Schmidt, and Daniel Huttenlocher published a joint statement in November 2021 calling for a government commission to regulate AI.[305] In 2023, OpenAI leaders published recommendations for the governance of superintelligence, which they believe may happen in less than 10 years.[306] In 2023, the United Nations also launched an advisory body to provide recommendations on AI governance; the body comprises technology company executives, governments officials and academics.[307] In 2024, the Council of Europe created the first international legally binding treaty on AI, called the \"Framework Convention on Artificial Intelligence and Human Rights, Democracy and the Rule of Law\". It was adopted by the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and other signatories.[308] In a 2022 Ipsos survey, attitudes towards AI varied greatly by country; 78% of Chinese citizens, but only 35% of Americans, agreed that \"products and services using AI have more benefits than drawbacks\".[302] A 2023 Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 61% of Americans agree, and 22% disagree, that AI poses risks to humanity.[309] In a 2023 Fox News poll, 35% of Americans thought it \"very important\", and an additional 41% thought it \"somewhat important\", for the federal government to regulate AI, versus 13% responding \"not very important\" and 8% responding \"not at all important\".[310][311] In November 2023, the first global AI Safety Summit was held in Bletchley Park in the UK to discuss the near and far term risks of AI and the possibility of mandatory and voluntary regulatory frameworks.[312] 28 countries including the United States, China, and the European Union issued a declaration at the start of the summit, calling for international co-operation to manage the challenges and risks of artificial intelligence.[313][314] In May 2024 at the AI Seoul Summit, 16 global AI tech companies agreed to safety commitments on the development of AI.[315][316] The study of mechanical or \"formal\" reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity. The study of logic led directly to Alan Turing's theory of computation, which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as \"0\" and \"1\", could simulate any conceivable form of mathematical reasoning.[317][318] This, along with concurrent discoveries in cybernetics, information theory and neurobiology, led researchers to consider the possibility of building an \"electronic brain\".[r] They developed several areas of research that would become part of AI,[320] such as McCullouch and Pitts design for \"artificial neurons\" in 1943,[115] and Turing's influential 1950 paper 'Computing Machinery and Intelligence', which introduced the Turing test and showed that \"machine intelligence\" was plausible.[321][318] The field of AI research was founded at a workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956.[s][6] The attendees became the leaders of AI research in the 1960s.[t] They and their students produced programs that the press described as \"astonishing\":[u] computers were learning checkers strategies, solving word problems in algebra, proving logical theorems and speaking English.[v][7] Artificial intelligence laboratories were set up at a number of British and U.S. universities in the latter 1950s and early 1960s.[318] Researchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that their methods would eventually succeed in creating a machine with general intelligence and considered this the goal of their field.[325] In 1965 Herbert Simon predicted, \"machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do\".[326] In 1967 Marvin Minsky agreed, writing that \"within a generation ... the problem of creating 'artificial intelligence' will substantially be solved\".[327] They had, however, underestimated the difficulty of the problem.[w] In 1974, both the U.S. and British governments cut off exploratory research in response to the criticism of Sir James Lighthill[329] and ongoing pressure from the U.S. Congress to fund more productive projects.[330] Minsky's and Papert's book Perceptrons was understood as proving that artificial neural networks would never be useful for solving real-world tasks, thus discrediting the approach altogether.[331] The \"AI winter\", a period when obtaining funding for AI projects was difficult, followed.[9] In the early 1980s, AI research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems,[332] a form of AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts. By 1985, the market for AI had reached over a billion dollars. At the same time, Japan's fifth generation computer project inspired the U.S. and British governments to restore funding for academic research.[8] However, beginning with the collapse of the Lisp Machine market in 1987, AI once again fell into disrepute, and a second, longer-lasting winter began.[10] Up to this point, most of AI's funding had gone to projects that used high-level symbols to represent mental objects like plans, goals, beliefs, and known facts. In the 1980s, some researchers began to doubt that this approach would be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition, especially perception, robotics, learning and pattern recognition,[333] and began to look into \"sub-symbolic\" approaches.[334] Rodney Brooks rejected \"representation\" in general and focussed directly on engineering machines that move and survive.[x] Judea Pearl, Lofti Zadeh and others developed methods that handled incomplete and uncertain information by making reasonable guesses rather than precise logic.[86][339] But the most important development was the revival of \"connectionism\", including neural network research, by Geoffrey Hinton and others.[340] In 1990, Yann LeCun successfully showed that convolutional neural networks can recognize handwritten digits, the first of many successful applications of neural networks.[341] AI gradually restored its reputation in the late 1990s and early 21st century by exploiting formal mathematical methods and by finding specific solutions to specific problems. This \"narrow\" and \"formal\" focus allowed researchers to produce verifiable results and collaborate with other fields (such as statistics, economics and mathematics).[342] By 2000, solutions developed by AI researchers were being widely used, although in the 1990s they were rarely described as \"artificial intelligence\" (a tendency known as the AI effect).[343] However, several academic researchers became concerned that AI was no longer pursuing its original goal of creating versatile, fully intelligent machines. Beginning around 2002, they founded the subfield of artificial general intelligence (or \"AGI\"), which had several well-funded institutions by the 2010s.[4] Deep learning began to dominate industry benchmarks in 2012 and was adopted throughout the field.[11] For many specific tasks, other methods were abandoned.[y] Deep learning's success was based on both hardware improvements (faster computers,[345] graphics processing units, cloud computing[346]) and access to large amounts of data[347] (including curated datasets,[346] such as ImageNet). Deep learning's success led to an enormous increase in interest and funding in AI.[z] The amount of machine learning research (measured by total publications) increased by 50% in the years 2015–2019.[304] In 2016, issues of fairness and the misuse of technology were catapulted into center stage at machine learning conferences, publications vastly increased, funding became available, and many researchers re-focussed their careers on these issues. The alignment problem became a serious field of academic study.[281] In the late teens and early 2020s, AGI companies began to deliver programs that created enormous interest. In 2015, AlphaGo, developed by DeepMind, beat the world champion Go player. The program was taught only the rules of the game and developed strategy by itself. GPT-3 is a large language model that was released in 2020 by OpenAI and is capable of generating high-quality human-like text.[348] These programs, and others, inspired an aggressive AI boom, where large companies began investing billions in AI research. According to AI Impacts, about $50 billion annually was invested in \"AI\" around 2022 in the U.S. alone and about 20% of the new U.S. Computer Science PhD graduates have specialized in \"AI\".[349] About 800,000 \"AI\"-related U.S. job openings existed in 2022.[350] Philosophical debates have historically sought to determine the nature of intelligence and how to make intelligent machines.[351] Another major focus has been whether machines can be conscious, and the associated ethical implications.[352] Many other topics in philosophy are relevant to AI, such as epistemology and free will.[353] Rapid advancements have intensified public discussions on the philosophy and ethics of AI.[352] Alan Turing wrote in 1950 \"I propose to consider the question 'can machines think'?\"[354] He advised changing the question from whether a machine \"thinks\", to \"whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour\".[354] He devised the Turing test, which measures the ability of a machine to simulate human conversation.[321] Since we can only observe the behavior of the machine, it does not matter if it is \"actually\" thinking or literally has a \"mind\". Turing notes that we can not determine these things about other people but \"it is usual to have a polite convention that everyone thinks.\"[355] Russell and Norvig agree with Turing that intelligence must be defined in terms of external behavior, not internal structure.[1] However, they are critical that the test requires the machine to imitate humans. \"Aeronautical engineering texts,\" they wrote, \"do not define the goal of their field as making 'machines that fly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool other pigeons.'\"[357] AI founder John McCarthy agreed, writing that \"Artificial intelligence is not, by definition, simulation of human intelligence\".[358] McCarthy defines intelligence as \"the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world\".[359] Another AI founder, Marvin Minsky similarly describes it as \"the ability to solve hard problems\".[360] The leading AI textbook defines it as the study of agents that perceive their environment and take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals.[1] These definitions view intelligence in terms of well-defined problems with well-defined solutions, where both the difficulty of the problem and the performance of the program are direct measures of the \"intelligence\" of the machine—and no other philosophical discussion is required, or may not even be possible. Another definition has been adopted by Google,[361] a major practitioner in the field of AI. This definition stipulates the ability of systems to synthesize information as the manifestation of intelligence, similar to the way it is defined in biological intelligence. Some authors have suggested in practice, that the definition of AI is vague and difficult to define, with contention as to whether classical algorithms should be categorised as AI,[362] with many companies during the early 2020s AI boom using the term as a marketing buzzword, often even if they did \"not actually use AI in a material way\".[363] No established unifying theory or paradigm has guided AI research for most of its history.[aa] The unprecedented success of statistical machine learning in the 2010s eclipsed all other approaches (so much so that some sources, especially in the business world, use the term \"artificial intelligence\" to mean \"machine learning with neural networks\"). This approach is mostly sub-symbolic, soft and narrow. Critics argue that these questions may have to be revisited by future generations of AI researchers. Symbolic AI (or \"GOFAI\")[365] simulated the high-level conscious reasoning that people use when they solve puzzles, express legal reasoning and do mathematics. They were highly successful at \"intelligent\" tasks such as algebra or IQ tests. In the 1960s, Newell and Simon proposed the physical symbol systems hypothesis: \"A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action.\"[366] However, the symbolic approach failed on many tasks that humans solve easily, such as learning, recognizing an object or commonsense reasoning. Moravec's paradox is the discovery that high-level \"intelligent\" tasks were easy for AI, but low level \"instinctive\" tasks were extremely difficult.[367] Philosopher Hubert Dreyfus had argued since the 1960s that human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation, and on having a \"feel\" for the situation, rather than explicit symbolic knowledge.[368] Although his arguments had been ridiculed and ignored when they were first presented, eventually, AI research came to agree with him.[ab][16] The issue is not resolved: sub-symbolic reasoning can make many of the same inscrutable mistakes that human intuition does, such as algorithmic bias. Critics such as Noam Chomsky argue continuing research into symbolic AI will still be necessary to attain general intelligence,[370][371] in part because sub-symbolic AI is a move away from explainable AI: it can be difficult or impossible to understand why a modern statistical AI program made a particular decision. The emerging field of neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence attempts to bridge the two approaches. \"Neats\" hope that intelligent behavior is described using simple, elegant principles (such as logic, optimization, or neural networks). \"Scruffies\" expect that it necessarily requires solving a large number of unrelated problems. Neats defend their programs with theoretical rigor, scruffies rely mainly on incremental testing to see if they work. This issue was actively discussed in the 1970s and 1980s,[372] but eventually was seen as irrelevant. Modern AI has elements of both. Finding a provably correct or optimal solution is intractable for many important problems.[15] Soft computing is a set of techniques, including genetic algorithms, fuzzy logic and neural networks, that are tolerant of imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth and approximation. Soft computing was introduced in the late 1980s and most successful AI programs in the 21st century are examples of soft computing with neural networks. AI researchers are divided as to whether to pursue the goals of artificial general intelligence and superintelligence directly or to solve as many specific problems as possible (narrow AI) in hopes these solutions will lead indirectly to the field's long-term goals.[373][374] General intelligence is difficult to define and difficult to measure, and modern AI has had more verifiable successes by focusing on specific problems with specific solutions. The sub-field of artificial general intelligence studies this area exclusively. The philosophy of mind does not know whether a machine can have a mind, consciousness and mental states, in the same sense that human beings do. This issue considers the internal experiences of the machine, rather than its external behavior. Mainstream AI research considers this issue irrelevant because it does not affect the goals of the field: to build machines that can solve problems using intelligence. Russell and Norvig add that \"[t]he additional project of making a machine conscious in exactly the way humans are is not one that we are equipped to take on.\"[375] However, the question has become central to the philosophy of mind. It is also typically the central question at issue in artificial intelligence in fiction. David Chalmers identified two problems in understanding the mind, which he named the \"hard\" and \"easy\" problems of consciousness.[376] The easy problem is understanding how the brain processes signals, makes plans and controls behavior. The hard problem is explaining how this feels or why it should feel like anything at all, assuming we are right in thinking that it truly does feel like something (Dennett's consciousness illusionism says this is an illusion). While human information processing is easy to explain, human subjective experience is difficult to explain. For example, it is easy to imagine a color-blind person who has learned to identify which objects in their field of view are red, but it is not clear what would be required for the person to know what red looks like.[377] Computationalism is the position in the philosophy of mind that the human mind is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing. Computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the mind–body problem. This philosophical position was inspired by the work of AI researchers and cognitive scientists in the 1960s and was originally proposed by philosophers Jerry Fodor and Hilary Putnam.[378] Philosopher John Searle characterized this position as \"strong AI\": \"The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds.\"[ac] Searle challenges this claim with his Chinese room argument, which attempts to show that even a computer capable of perfectly simulating human behavior would not have a mind.[382] It is difficult or impossible to reliably evaluate whether an advanced AI is sentient (has the ability to feel), and if so, to what degree.[383] But if there is a significant chance that a given machine can feel and suffer, then it may be entitled to certain rights or welfare protection measures, similarly to animals.[384][385] Sapience (a set of capacities related to high intelligence, such as discernment or self-awareness) may provide another moral basis for AI rights.[384] Robot rights are also sometimes proposed as a practical way to integrate autonomous agents into society.[386] In 2017, the European Union considered granting \"electronic personhood\" to some of the most capable AI systems. Similarly to the legal status of companies, it would have conferred rights but also responsibilities.[387] Critics argued in 2018 that granting rights to AI systems would downplay the importance of human rights, and that legislation should focus on user needs rather than speculative futuristic scenarios. They also noted that robots lacked the autonomy to take part to society on their own.[388][389] Progress in AI increased interest in the topic. Proponents of AI welfare and rights often argue that AI sentience, if it emerges, would be particularly easy to deny. They warn that this may be a moral blind spot analogous to slavery or factory farming, which could lead to large-scale suffering if sentient AI is created and carelessly exploited.[385][384] A superintelligence is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind.[374]If research into artificial general intelligence produced sufficiently intelligent software, it might be able to reprogram and improve itself. The improved software would be even better at improving itself, leading to what I. J. Good called an \"intelligence explosion\" and Vernor Vinge called a \"singularity\".[390] However, technologies cannot improve exponentially indefinitely, and typically follow an S-shaped curve, slowing when they reach the physical limits of what the technology can do.[391] Robot designer Hans Moravec, cyberneticist Kevin Warwick and inventor Ray Kurzweil have predicted that humans and machines may merge in the future into cyborgs that are more capable and powerful than either. This idea, called transhumanism, has roots in the writings of Aldous Huxley and Robert Ettinger.[392] Edward Fredkin argues that \"artificial intelligence is the next step in evolution\", an idea first proposed by Samuel Butler's \"Darwin among the Machines\" as far back as 1863, and expanded upon by George Dyson in his 1998 book Darwin Among the Machines: The Evolution of Global Intelligence.[393] Thought-capable artificial beings have appeared as storytelling devices since antiquity,[394] and have been a persistent theme in science fiction.[395] A common trope in these works began with Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, where a human creation becomes a threat to its masters. This includes such works as Arthur C. Clarke's and Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (both 1968), with HAL 9000, the murderous computer in charge of the Discovery One spaceship, as well as The Terminator (1984) and The Matrix (1999). In contrast, the rare loyal robots such as Gort from The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) and Bishop from Aliens (1986) are less prominent in popular culture.[396] Isaac Asimov introduced the Three Laws of Robotics in many stories, most notably with the \"Multivac\" super-intelligent computer. Asimov's laws are often brought up during lay discussions of machine ethics;[397] while almost all artificial intelligence researchers are familiar with Asimov's laws through popular culture, they generally consider the laws useless for many reasons, one of which is their ambiguity.[398] Several works use AI to force us to confront the fundamental question of what makes us human, showing us artificial beings that have the ability to feel, and thus to suffer. This appears in Karel Čapek's R.U.R., the films A.I. Artificial Intelligence and Ex Machina, as well as the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, by Philip K. Dick. Dick considers the idea that our understanding of human subjectivity is altered by technology created with artificial intelligence.[399] The two most widely used textbooks in 2023 (see the Open Syllabus): These were the four of the most widely used AI textbooks in 2008: Other textbooks:",

Artificial intelligence is the ability of a computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks that are commonly associated with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason. Although there are as yet no AIs that match full human flexibility over wider domains or in tasks requiring much everyday knowledge, some AIs perform specific tasks as well as humans. Learn more. No, artificial intelligence and machine learning are not the same, but they are closely related. Machine learning is the method to train a computer to learn from its inputs but without explicit programming for every circumstance. Machine learning helps a computer to achieve artificial intelligence. artificial intelligence (AI), the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings. The term is frequently applied to the project of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience. Since their development in the 1940s, digital computers have been programmed to carry out very complex tasks—such as discovering proofs for mathematical theorems or playing chess—with great proficiency. Despite continuing advances in computer processing speed and memory capacity, there are as yet no programs that can match full human flexibility over wider domains or in tasks requiring much everyday knowledge. On the other hand, some programs have attained the performance levels of human experts and professionals in executing certain specific tasks, so that artificial intelligence in this limited sense is found in applications as diverse as medical diagnosis, computer search engines, voice or handwriting recognition, and chatbots. Artificial intelligence is changing how we interact online, how we manage our finances, and even how we work. Learn more with Britannica Money. All but the simplest human behavior is ascribed to intelligence, while even the most complicated insect behavior is usually not taken as an indication of intelligence. What is the difference? Consider the behavior of the digger wasp, Sphex ichneumoneus. When the female wasp returns to her burrow with food, she first deposits it on the threshold, checks for intruders inside her burrow, and only then, if the coast is clear, carries her food inside. The real nature of the wasp’s instinctual behavior is revealed if the food is moved a few inches away from the entrance to her burrow while she is inside: on emerging, she will repeat the whole procedure as often as the food is displaced. Intelligence—conspicuously absent in the case of the wasp—must include the ability to adapt to new circumstances. (Read Ray Kurzweil’s Britannica essay on the future of “Nonbiological Man.”) Psychologists generally characterize human intelligence not by just one trait but by the combination of many diverse abilities. Research in AI has focused chiefly on the following components of intelligence: learning, reasoning, problem solving, perception, and using language. There are a number of different forms of learning as applied to artificial intelligence. The simplest is learning by trial and error. For example, a simple computer program for solving mate-in-one chess problems might try moves at random until mate is found. The program might then store the solution with the position so that, the next time the computer encountered the same position, it would recall the solution. This simple memorizing of individual items and procedures—known as rote learning—is relatively easy to implement on a computer. More challenging is the problem of implementing what is called generalization. Generalization involves applying past experience to analogous new situations. For example, a program that learns the past tense of regular English verbs by rote will not be able to produce the past tense of a word such as jump unless the program was previously presented with jumped, whereas a program that is able to generalize can learn the “add -ed” rule for regular verbs ending in a consonant and so form the past tense of jump on the basis of experience with similar verbs.

                "content": "Magazine says we are ‘living in the Age of Trump’ as US president-elect outlines mass deportation and foreign policy plans. TIME Magazine has named Donald Trump its “Person of the Year”, saying “perhaps no single individual has played a larger role in changing the course of politics and history” than the United States president-elect. In a statement on Thursday explaining the choice, TIME wrote that Trump — who defeated Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris to win last month’s presidential election — is experiencing his “apotheosis”. “On the cusp of his second presidency, all of us—from his most fanatical supporters to his most fervent critics—are living in the Age of Trump,” the magazine said. “For marshaling a comeback of historic proportions, for driving a once-in-a-­generation political realignment, for reshaping the American presidency and altering America’s role in the world, Donald Trump is TIME’s 2024 ­Person of the Year.” Trump surged to victory in the November 5 election after a campaign marked by incendiary and often hateful rhetoric against migrants, Democrats and other perceived opponents. The Republican, who will take office on January 20, has promised to carry out the largest deportation operation in US history – a pledge that has drawn rebuke from rights advocates and spurred a sense of fear in many communities. Late last month, Trump also threatened to impose huge tariffs on Mexico and Canada if the two countries do not stem irregular migration as well as the flow of illegal drugs over their borders with the US. In an interview with TIME published on Thursday, the US president-elect said he would be willing to use the army to deport migrants from the country. “It doesn’t stop the military if it’s an invasion of our country,” he said, adding that he would “only do what the law allows”. “But I will go up to the maximum level of what the law allows,” Trump said. Asked whether he would reinstate a policy that saw migrant children separated from their parents, Trump said: “I don’t think we’ll have to because we will send the whole family back”. The Republican leader’s “America First” foreign policy has also been in the spotlight since his election victory. Trump has pledged to end the war in Ukraine on his first day in the White House and take a hard line against China and Iran. He also has reiterated his staunch support for Israel while threatening in early December that there will be “hell to pay” if captives held in the Gaza Strip are not released before he takes office. In his TIME interview, Trump said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu knows he wants the war in Gaza to end. Asked if he trusts the Israeli leader, he answered: “I don’t trust anybody.” Trump also told the magazine that he disagrees with Ukraine’s firing of US missiles into Russian territory, saying the move was “escalating this war and making it worse”. But he said he would use Washington’s support for Kyiv as leverage against Moscow to end the conflict. “I want to reach an agreement,” he told TIME, “and the only way you’re going to reach an agreement is not to abandon.” Trump was named the magazine’s “Person of the Year” in 2016, when he was first elected to the White House. The other finalists for this year’s designation were Harris, Netanyahu, X owner Elon Musk, and Kate, the Princess of Wales. The magazine emphasises that its choice of “Person of the Year” is based on the figure being “newsworthy – not necessarily praiseworthy”, and acknowledges that the choices are “often controversial”. Previous picks include Nazi leader Adolf Hitler and Soviet Union leader Joseph Stalin, as well as more popular figures such as the US civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr and the South African anti-apartheid figure and later President Nelson Mandela.

                "content": "Citing his \"political rebirth\" on the 2024 presidential campaign trail, his comeback after an assassination bid and his \"realignment of American politics\", Time magazine on Thursday selected US President-elect Donald Trump as its Person of the Year. Issued on: 12/12/2024 - 14:53 About six months ago, Donald Trump was sitting in a courtroom in lower Manhattan listening to a jury make him the first former president convicted of a crime. On Thursday, he will ring the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange just blocks from that courthouse and as he was recognized by Time magazine as its person of the year. The honors for the businessman-turned-politician represent the latest chapter in his love-hate relationship with New York. They're also a measure of Trump's remarkable comeback from an ostracized former president who refused to accept his election loss four years ago to a president-elect who won the White House decisively in November. Sam Jacobs, Time's editor in chief, announced on NBC's “Today” show that Trump was Time’s 2024 Person of the Year. Jacobs said Trump was someone who “for better or for worse, had the most influence on the news in 2024.” “This is someone who made an historic comeback, who reshaped the American presidency and who’s reordering American politics,\" Jacobs said. \"It’s hard to argue with the fact that the person who’s moving into the Oval Office is the most influential person in news.\" He added that “there’s always a hot debate” at the magazine over the honor, \"although I have to admit that this year was an easier decision than years past.” To display this content from X (Twitter), you must enable advertisement tracking and audience measurement. In an interview with the magazine published Thursday, Trump spoke about his final campaign blitz and election win. “I called it ‘72 Days of Fury,’” Trump said. “We hit the nerve of the country. The country was angry.” Trump is expected to be on Wall Street to mark the ceremonial start of the day’s trading, according to four people with knowledge of his plans who were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. Trump was also Time's Person of the Year in 2016, when he was first elected to the White House. He was listed as a finalist for this year’s award alongside notables including Vice President Kamala Harris, X owner Elon Musk, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Kate, the Princess of Wales. The NYSE regularly invites celebrities and business leaders to participate in the 9:30 a.m. ceremonial opening trading. Thursday will be Trump's first time doing the honors, which have become a marker of culture and politics. Last year, Time CEO Jessica Sibley rang the NYSE opening bell to unveil the magazine’s 2023 Person of the Year: Taylor Swift. During Trump's first term, his wife, Melania Trump, rang the bell to promote her “Be Best” initiative on children’s well-being. Donald Trump's trip to New York from his adopted home of Florida to sound the call of capitalism in the mecca of finance tops a string of visits that the former president has made to various spots in the city this year. Outside of his required presence in a downtown courthouse for his trial, Trump, who is always attuned to the art of a photo op, held campaign events around the city: at a firehouse, a bodega and a construction site. He also held a rally in the Bronx, among the places in the city where Trump made inroads during the election. To mark the final stretch of his campaign, he held a high-octane rally at Madison Square Garden, which drew immediate blowback after speakers there made rude and racist insults and incendiary remarks. To display this content from , you must enable advertisement tracking and audience measurement. Trump has long had a fascination with being on the cover of Time, where he first made an appearance in 1989. He has falsely claimed to hold the record for cover appearances, and The Washington Post reported in 2017 that Trump had a fake picture of himself on the cover of the magazine hanging in several of his golf country clubs. Earlier this year, Trump sat for interviews with the magazine for a story that ran in April. Time’s billionaire owner, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, criticized Trump’s Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, for not granting the magazine an interview. \"Despite multiple requests, Time has not been granted an interview with Kamala Harris—unlike every other Presidential candidate,” Benioff said in a post on X. “We believe in transparency and publish each interview in full. Why isn’t the Vice President engaging with the public on the same level?” In his latest interview published Thursday, Trump reiterated that he’s going to pardon most of those convicted in riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. “It’s going to start in the first hour,” he said of the pardons. “Maybe the first nine minutes.” Trump crafted his image as a wealthy real estate developer, which he played up as the star of the TV reality show “The Apprentice” and during his presidential campaign. He won the election in part by channeling Americans' anxieties about the economy’s ability to provide for the middle class. After the Nov. 5 election, the S&P 500 rallied 2.5% for its best day in nearly two years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 1,508 points, or 3.6%, while the Nasdaq composite jumped 3%. All three indexes topped records they had set in previous weeks. Trump, who often regards the stock market as a measure of public support, has said his coming term as president should be dated to the day after the election so he is credited for the gains. Trump's campaign promises have included pledges to deliver historic levels of economic growth, and the people he's selecting to fill out his incoming administration skew heavily from the business sector. The larger business community has applauded his promises to reduce corporate taxes and cut regulations. But there are also concerns about his stated plans to impose broad tariffs and possibly target companies that he sees as not aligning with his own political interests. The U.S. stock market has historically tended to rise regardless of which party wins the White House, with Democrats scoring bigger average gains since 1945. But Republican control could mean big shifts in the winning and losing industries underneath the surface, and investors are adding to bets built earlier on what the higher tariffs, lower tax rates and lighter regulation that Trump favors will mean. In light of his election win, his lawyers have sought to have his conviction in the Manhattan case be thrown out. (AP) © 2024 Copyright France 24 - All rights reserved.

                "content": "Barcelona (/ˌbɑːrsəˈloʊnə/ ⓘ BAR-sə-LOH-nə; Catalan: [bəɾsəˈlonə] ⓘ; Spanish: [baɾθeˈlona] ⓘ) is a city on the northeastern coast of Spain. It is the capital and largest city of the autonomous community of Catalonia, as well as the second-most populous municipality of Spain. With a population of 1.6 million within city limits,[8] its urban area extends to numerous neighbouring municipalities within the province of Barcelona and is home to around 5.3 million people,[3] making it the fifth most populous urban area of the European Union after Paris, the Ruhr area, Madrid and Milan.[3] It is one of the largest metropolises on the Mediterranean Sea, located on the coast between the mouths of the rivers Llobregat and Besòs, bounded to the west by the Serra de Collserola mountain range. According to tradition, Barcelona was founded by either the Phoenicians or the Carthaginians, who had trading posts along the Catalonian coast.[9] In the Middle Ages Barcelona became the capital of the County of Barcelona. After joining with the Kingdom of Aragon to form the confederation of the Crown of Aragon, Barcelona, which continued to be the capital of the Principality of Catalonia, became the most important city in the Crown of Aragon and the main economic and administrative centre of the Crown, only to be overtaken by Valencia, wrested from Moorish control by the Catalans, shortly before the dynastic union between the Crown of Castile and the Crown of Aragon in 1492. Barcelona became the centre of Catalan separatism, briefly becoming part of France during the 17th century Reapers' War and again in 1812 until 1814 under Napoleon. It was the capital of Revolutionary Catalonia during the Spanish Revolution of 1936, and the seat of government of the Second Spanish Republic later in the Spanish Civil War, until its capture by the fascists in 1939. After the Spanish transition to democracy in the 1970s, Barcelona once again became the capital of an autonomous Catalonia. Barcelona has a rich cultural heritage and is today an important cultural centre and a major tourist destination. Particularly renowned are the architectural works of Antoni Gaudí and Lluís Domènech i Montaner, which have been designated UNESCO World Heritage Sites. The city is home to two of the most prestigious universities in Spain: the University of Barcelona and Pompeu Fabra University. The headquarters of the Union for the Mediterranean are located in Barcelona. The city is known for hosting the 1992 Summer Olympics as well as world-class conferences and expositions. In addition, many international sport tournaments have been played here. Barcelona is a major cultural, economic, and financial centre in southwestern Europe,[10] as well as the main biotech hub in Spain.[11] As a leading world city, Barcelona's influence in global socio-economic affairs qualifies it for global city status (Beta +).[12] Barcelona is a transport hub, with the Port of Barcelona being one of Europe's principal seaports and busiest European passenger port,[13] an international airport, Barcelona–El Prat Airport, which handles over 50 million passengers per year,[14] an extensive motorway network, and a high-speed rail line with a link to France and the rest of Europe.[15] The name Barcelona comes from the ancient Iberian Baŕkeno, attested in an ancient coin inscription found on the right side of the coin in Iberian script as ,[16] in Ancient Greek sources as Βαρκινών, Barkinṓn;[17][18] and in Latin as Barcino,[19] Barcilonum[20] and Barcenona.[21][22][23] Other sources suggest that the city may have been named after the Carthaginian general Hamilcar Barca, who was supposed to have founded the city in the 3rd century BC,[9][24] but there is no evidence its name in antiquity, Barcino, was connected with the Barcid family of Hamilcar.[25] During the Middle Ages, the city was variously known as Barchinona, Barçalona, Barchelonaa, and Barchenona. An abbreviated form sometimes used by locals for the city is Barna. Barça is only applied to the local football club FC Barcelona, not to the city. Another common abbreviation is 'BCN', which is also the IATA airport code of the Barcelona-El Prat Airport. The city is referred to as the Ciutat Comtal in Catalan and Ciudad Condal in Spanish (i.e., \"Comital City\" or \"City of Counts\"), owing to its past as the seat of the Count of Barcelona.[26] The origin of the earliest settlement at the site of present-day Barcelona is unclear. The ruins of an early settlement have been found, including different tombs and dwellings dating to earlier than 5000 BC.[27][28] In Greek mythology, the founding of Barcelona had been attributed to the mythological Hercules. According to tradition, Barcelona was founded by Punic (Phoenician) settlers, who had trading posts along the Catalonian coast.[9][29][30] In particular, some historians attribute the foundation of the city directly to the historical Carthaginian general, Hamilcar Barca, father of Hannibal, who supposedly named the city Barcino after his family in the 3rd century BC,[9][31] but this theory has been questioned.[25] Archeological evidence in the form of coins from the 3rd century BC have been found on the hills at the foot of Montjuïc with the name Bárkeno written in an ancient script in the Iberian language[citation needed]. Thus, we can conclude[clarification needed] that the Laietani[citation needed], an ancient Iberian (pre-Roman) people of the Iberian peninsula, who inhabited the area occupied by the city of Barcelona around 3–2 BC[clarification needed], called the area Bàrkeno, which means \"The Place of the Plains\" (Barrke = plains/terrace).[32][better source needed] In about 15 BC, the Romans redrew the town as a castrum (Roman military camp) centred on the \"Mons Taber\", a little hill near the Generalitat (Catalan Government) and city hall buildings. The Roman Forum, at the crossing of the Cardo Maximus and Decumanus Maximus, was approximately placed where current Plaça de Sant Jaume is. Thus, the political centre of the city, Catalonia, and its domains has remained in the same place for over 2,000 years. Under the Romans, it was a colony with the surname of Faventia,[33] or, in full, Colonia Faventia Julia Augusta Pia Barcino[34] or Colonia Julia Augusta Faventia Paterna Barcino. Pomponius Mela[35] mentions it among the small towns of the district, probably as it was eclipsed by its neighbour Tarraco (modern Tarragona), but it may be gathered from later writers that it gradually grew in wealth and consequence, favoured as it was with a beautiful situation and an excellent harbour.[36] It enjoyed immunity from imperial burdens.[37] The city minted its own coins; some from the era of Galba survive. Important Roman vestiges are displayed in Plaça del Rei underground, as a part of the Barcelona City History Museum (MUHBA); the typically Roman grid plan is still visible today in the layout of the historical centre, the Barri Gòtic (Gothic Quarter). Some remaining fragments of the Roman walls have been incorporated into the cathedral.[38] The cathedral, Catedral Basílica Metropolitana de Barcelona, is also sometimes called La Seu, which simply means cathedral (and see, among other things) in Catalan.[39][40] It is said to have been founded in 343. The city was conquered by the Visigoths in the early 5th century, becoming for a few years the capital of all Hispania. After being conquered by the Umayyads in the early 8th century, it was conquered after a siege in 801 by Charlemagne's son Louis, who made Barcelona the seat of the Carolingian \"Hispanic March\" (Marca Hispanica), a buffer zone ruled by the Count of Barcelona.[41] The Counts of Barcelona became increasingly independent and expanded their territory to include much of modern Catalonia, although in 985, Barcelona was sacked by the army of Almanzor.[42] The sack was so traumatic that most of Barcelona's population was either killed or enslaved.[43] In 1137, Aragon and the County of Barcelona merged in dynastic union[44][45] by the marriage of Ramon Berenguer IV and Petronilla of Aragon, their titles finally borne by only one person when their son Alfonso II of Aragon ascended to the throne in 1162. His territories were later to be known as the Crown of Aragon, which conquered many overseas possessions and ruled the western Mediterranean Sea with outlying territories in Naples and Sicily and as far as Athens in the 13th century. Barcelona was the leading slave trade centre of the Crown of Aragon up until the 15th century, when it was eclipsed by Valencia.[46] It initially fed from eastern and Balkan slave stock later drawing from a Maghribian and, ultimately, Subsaharan pool of slaves.[47] The Bank or Taula de canvi de Barcelona, often viewed as the oldest public bank in Europe, was established by the city magistrates in 1401. It originated from necessities of the state, as did the Bank of Venice (1402) and the Bank of Genoa (1407).[48] In the beginning of the Early Modern period, Barcelona lost political primacy, but the economy managed to achieve a balance between production capacity and imports.[49] In the context of the wider early recovery of Catalonia from the 17th-century crisis in the second half of the century, increasing maritime activity since 1675 doubled traffic in the port of Barcelona compared to figures from the beginning of the 17th century.[50] In the late 17th and early 18th century, Barcelona repeatedly endured the effects of war, including the 1691 bombing, the sieges of 1697, 1704, 1705, 1706, and the 1713 blockade and ensuing 1714 siege and assault.[51] In the 18th century, the population grew from 30,000 to about 100,000 inhabitants, as the city became one of the key mercantile centres in the Western Mediterranean, with inland influence up to Zaragoza, and to the south up to Alicante.[52] A fortress was built at Montjuïc that overlooked the harbour. Much of Barcelona was negatively affected by the Napoleonic wars, but the start of industrialization saw the fortunes of the province improve. In the mid-1850s, Barcelona was struggling with population density as it became an industrial, port city and European capital. The city's density was at 856 people per hectare, more than double that of Paris. Mortality rates were on the rise and any outbreaks of disease would devastate the population. To solve the issue, a civil engineer named Ildefons Cerdà proposed a plan for a new district known as the Eixample. The citizens of Barcelona had begun to demolish the medieval wall surrounding and constricting the city. Cerdà thought it best to transform the land outside the walls into an area characterized by a scientific approach to urbanization. His proposal consisted of a grid of streets to unite the old city and surrounding villages. There would also be wide streets to allow people to breathe clean air, gardens in the centre of each street block, integration of rich and poor giving both groups access to the same services, and smooth-flowing traffic. Urban quality, egalitarianism, hygiene, sunlight, and efficiency were all major keys for Cerdà's vision. Not everything he imagined would be realized within the Eixample district, but the iconic octagonal superblocks with chamfered corners for better visibility are his direct brainchild and remain immensely helpful even 170 years later. The district and its ideals were not appreciated at the time. The city council awarded the design of the extension plan to another architect. The Spanish government was the one to step in and impose Cerdà's plan, laying the groundwork for many more tensions between the Spanish and Catalan administrations. Regardless, some of the upper class citizens of Barcelona were excited by the new plan and began a race to build \"the biggest, tallest, most attractive house\" in the district. Their interest and money fueled the rich diversity that we now see in the district's architecture. In the end, Cerdà's ideas would have a lasting impact on Barcelona's development, earning it international recognition for its highly efficient approach to urban planning and design.[53][54] During the Spanish Civil War, the city, and Catalonia in general, were resolutely Republican. Many enterprises and public services were collectivized by the CNT and UGT unions. As the power of the Republican government and the Generalitat diminished, much of the city was under the effective control of anarchist groups. The anarchists lost control of the city to their own allies, the Communists and official government troops, after the street fighting of the Barcelona May Days. The fall of the city on 26 January 1939, caused a mass exodus of civilians who fled to the French border. The resistance of Barcelona to Franco's coup d'état was to have lasting effects after the defeat of the Republican government. The autonomous institutions of Catalonia were abolished,[57] and the use of the Catalan language in public life was suppressed. Barcelona remained the second largest city in Spain, at the heart of a region which was relatively industrialized and prosperous, despite the devastation of the civil war. The result was a large-scale immigration from poorer regions of Spain (particularly Andalusia, Murcia and Galicia), which in turn led to rapid urbanization. In 1992, Barcelona hosted the Summer Olympics. The after-effects of this are credited with driving major changes in what had, up until then, been a largely industrial city. As part of the preparation for the games, industrial buildings along the sea-front were demolished and 3 km (2 mi) of beach were created. New construction increased the road capacity of the city by 17%, the sewage handling capacity by 27% and the amount of new green areas and beaches by 78%. Between 1990 and 2004, the number of hotel rooms in the city doubled. Perhaps more importantly, the outside perception of the city was changed making, by 2012, Barcelona the 12th most popular city destination in the world and the 5th amongst European cities.[58][59][60][61][62] The death of Franco in 1975 brought on a period of democratization throughout Spain. Pressure for change was particularly strong in Barcelona, which considered that it had been punished during nearly forty years of Francoism for its support of the Republican government.[63] Massive, but peaceful, demonstrations on 11 September 1977 assembled over a million people in the streets of Barcelona to call for the restoration of Catalan autonomy. It was granted less than a month later.[64] The development of Barcelona was promoted by two events in 1986: Spanish accession to the European Community, and particularly Barcelona's designation as host city of the 1992 Summer Olympics.[65][66] The process of urban regeneration has been rapid, and accompanied by a greatly increased international reputation of the city as a tourist destination. The increased cost of housing has led to a slight decline (−16.6%) in the population over the last two decades of the 20th century as many families move out into the suburbs. This decline has been reversed since 2001, as a new wave of immigration (particularly from Latin America and from Morocco) has gathered pace.[67] In 1987, an ETA car bombing at Hipercor killed 21 people. On 17 August 2017, a van was driven into pedestrians on La Rambla, killing 14 and injuring at least 100, one of whom later died. Other attacks took place elsewhere in Catalonia. The Prime Minister of Spain, Mariano Rajoy, called the attack in Barcelona a jihadist attack. Amaq News Agency attributed indirect responsibility for the attack to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).[68][69][70] During the 2010s, Barcelona became the focus city[citation needed] for the ongoing Catalan independence movement, its consequent standoff between the regional and national government and later protests.[71] In July 2023, Barcelona was announced as the UNESCO-UIA World Capital of Architecture for the 2024–2026 term. This means it will be the hub for discussion around global challenges including culture, heritage, urban planning and architecture. In addition to being the capital through 2026, it will also host the UIA World Congress of Architects for that year. The honour is befitting of Barcelona, as its history is peppered with architectural achievement and various iconic styles and influences. From its ancient Roman roots, to the Gothic and Modernisme movements, Barcelona has thrived through the way it ties together architecture and culture.[72] Barcelona is located on the northeast coast of the Iberian Peninsula, facing the Mediterranean Sea, on a plain approximately 5 km (3 mi) wide limited by the mountain range of Collserola, the Llobregat river to the southwest and the Besòs river to the north.[73] This plain covers an area of 170 km2 (66 sq mi),[73] of which 101 km2 (39.0 sq mi)[74] are occupied by the city itself. It is 120 km (75 mi) south of the Pyrenees and the Catalan border with France. Tibidabo, 512 m (1,680 ft) high, offers striking views over the city[75] and is topped by the 288.4 m (946.2 ft) Torre de Collserola, a telecommunications tower that is visible from most of the city. Barcelona is peppered with small hills, most of them urbanized, that gave their name to the neighbourhoods built upon them, such as Carmel (267 m or 876 ft), Putxet (es) (181 m or 594 ft) and Rovira (261 m or 856 ft). The escarpment of Montjuïc (173 m or 568 ft), situated to the southeast, overlooks the harbour and is topped by Montjuïc Castle, a fortress built in the 17–18th centuries to control the city as a replacement for the Ciutadella. Today, the fortress is a museum and Montjuïc is home to several sporting and cultural venues, as well as Barcelona's biggest park and gardens. The city borders on the municipalities of Santa Coloma de Gramenet and Sant Adrià de Besòs to the north; the Mediterranean Sea to the east; El Prat de Llobregat and L'Hospitalet de Llobregat to the south; and Sant Feliu de Llobregat, Sant Just Desvern, Esplugues de Llobregat, Sant Cugat del Vallès, and Montcada i Reixac to the west. The municipality includes two small sparsely-inhabited exclaves to the north-west. According to the Köppen climate classification, Barcelona has a hot summer Mediterranean climate (Csa), with mild winters and warm to hot summers,[76] while the rainiest seasons are autumn and spring. The rainfall pattern is characterized by a short (3 months) dry season in summer, as well as less winter rainfall than in a typical Mediterranean climate. However, both June and August are wetter than February, which is unusual for the Mediterranean climate. This subtype, labelled as \"Portuguese\" by the French geographer George Viers after the climate classification of Emmanuel de Martonne[77] and found in the NW Mediterranean area (e.g. Marseille), can be seen as transitional to the humid subtropical climate (Cfa) found in inland areas. Barcelona is densely populated, thus heavily influenced by the urban heat island effect. Areas outside of the urbanized districts can have as much as 2 °C of difference in temperatures throughout the year.[78] Its average annual temperature is 21.2 °C (70.2 °F) during the day and 15.1 °C (59.2 °F) at night. The average annual temperature of the sea is about 20 °C (68 °F). In the coldest month, January, the temperature typically ranges from 12 to 18 °C (54 to 64 °F) during the day, 6 to 12 °C (43 to 54 °F) at night and the average sea temperature is 13 °C (55 °F).[79] In the warmest month, August, the typical temperature ranges from 27 to 31 °C (81 to 88 °F) during the day, about 23 °C (73 °F) at night and the average sea temperature is 26 °C (79 °F).[79] Generally, the summer or \"holiday\" season lasts about six months, from May to October. Two months – April and November – are transitional; sometimes the temperature exceeds 20 °C (68 °F), with an average temperature of 18–19 °C (64–66 °F) during the day and 11–13 °C (52–55 °F) at night. December, January and February are the coldest months, with average temperatures around 15 °C (59 °F) during the day and 9 °C (48 °F) at night. Large fluctuations in temperature are rare, particularly in the summer months. Because of the proximity to the warm sea plus the urban heat island, frosts are very rare in the city of Barcelona. Snow is also very infrequent in the city of Barcelona, but light snowfalls can occur yearly in the nearby Collserola mountains, such as in the Fabra Observatory located in a nearby mountain.[80] Barcelona averages 78 rainy days per year (≥ 1 mm), and annual average relative humidity is 72%, ranging from 69% in July to 75% in October. Rainfall totals are highest in late summer and autumn (September–November) and lowest in early and mid-summer (June–August), with a secondary winter minimum (February–March). Sunshine duration is 2,524 hours per year, from 138 (average 4.5 hours of sunshine a day) in December to 310 (average 10 hours of sunshine a day) in July.[81] According to Barcelona's City Council, the city's population as of 1 January 2016[update] was 1,608,746 people,[86] on a land area of 101.4 km2 (39 sq mi). It is the main component of an administrative area of Greater Barcelona, with a population of 3,218,071 in an area of 636 km2 (246 sq mi) (density 5,060 inhabitants/km2). The population of the urban area was 4,840,000.[3] It is the central nucleus of the Barcelona metropolitan area, which relies on a population of 5,474,482.[4] In 1900, Barcelona had a population of 533,000,[73] which grew steadily but slowly until 1950, when it started absorbing a high number of people from other less-industrialized parts of Spain. Barcelona's population peaked in 1979 at 1,906,998, and fell throughout the 1980s and 1990s as more people sought a higher quality of life in outlying cities in the Barcelona Metropolitan Area. After bottoming out in 2000 with 1,496,266 residents, the city's population began to rise again as younger people started to return, causing a great increase in housing prices.[87] Spanish is the most spoken language in Barcelona (according to the linguistic census held by the Government of Catalonia in 2013) and it is understood almost universally. Catalan is also very commonly spoken in the city: it is understood by 95% of the population, while 72.3% can speak it, 79% can read it, and 53% can write it.[88] Knowledge of Catalan has increased significantly in recent decades thanks to a language immersion educational system. After Catalan and Spanish, the most spoken languages in Barcelona are those from North Africa, such as Amazigh and Arabic, followed by Bengali, Urdu, Panjabi, Mandarin Chinese, Romanian, English, Russian and Quechua, according to data collected by the University of Barcelona.[89] Barcelona is one of the most densely populated cities in Europe. For the year 2008 the city council calculated the population to 1,621,090 living in the 102.2 km2 sized municipality, giving the city an average population density of 15,926 inhabitants per square kilometre with Eixample being the most populated district.[90][full citation needed] In the case of Barcelona though, the land distribution is extremely uneven. Half of the municipality or 50.2 km2, all of it located on the municipal edge is made up of the ten least densely populated neighbourhoods containing less than 10% of the city's population, the uninhabited Zona Franca industrial area and Montjuïc forest park. Leaving the remaining 90% or slightly below 1.5 million inhabitants living on the remaining 52 km2 (20 sq mi) at an average density close to 28,500 inhabitants per square kilometre.[90][full citation needed] Of the 73 neighbourhoods in the city, 45 had a population density above 20,000 inhabitants per square kilometre with a combined population of 1,313,424 inhabitants living on 38.6 km2 at an average density of 33,987 inhabitants per square kilometre. The 30 most densely populated neighbourhoods accounted for 57.5% of the city population occupying only 22.7% of the municipality, or in other words, 936,406 people living at an average density of 40,322 inhabitants per square kilometre. The city's highest density is found at and around the neighbourhood of la Sagrada Família where four of the city's most densely populated neighbourhoods are located side by side, all with a population density above 50,000 inhabitants per square kilometre.[90][full citation needed] In 1900, almost a third (28.9 percent) of the population were children (aged younger than 14 years). In 2017, this age group constituted only 12.7% of the population. In 2017, people aged between 15 and 24 years made up 9 percent of the population; those aged between 25 and 44 years made up 30.6 percent of the population; while those aged between 45 and 64 years formed 56.9% of all Barcelonans. In 1900, people aged 65 and older made up just 6.5 percent of the population. In 2017, this age group made up 21.5 percent of the population.[91][92] In 2016, about 59% of the inhabitants of the city were born in Catalonia and 18.5% coming from the rest of the country. In addition to that, 22.5% of the population was born outside of Spain, a proportion which has more than doubled since 2001 and more than quintupled since 1996 when it was 8.6% and 3.9% respectively.[86] The most important region of origin of migrants is Europe, with many coming from Italy (26,676) or France (13,506).[86] Moreover, many migrants come from Latin American nations such as Bolivia, Ecuador or Colombia. Since the 1990s, and similar to other migrants, many Latin Americans have settled in northern parts of the city.[94] There exists a relatively large Pakistani community in Barcelona with up to twenty thousand nationals. The community consists of significantly more men than women. Many of the Pakistanis are living in Ciutat Vella. First Pakistani migrants came in the 1970s, with increasing numbers in the 1990s.[95] Other significant migrant groups come from Asia as from China and the Philippines.[86] There is a Japanese community clustered in Bonanova, Les Tres Torres, Pedralbes, and other northern neighbourhoods, and a Japanese international school serves that community.[96] In 2007 most of the inhabitants stated they are Roman Catholic (208 churches).[97] In a 2011 survey conducted by InfoCatólica, 49.5% of Barcelona residents of all ages identified themselves as Catholic.[98] This was the first time that more than half of respondents did not identify themselves as Catholic Christians.[98] The numbers reflect a broader trend in Spain whereby the numbers of self-identified Catholics have declined.[98] In 2019, a survey by Centro de Investigaciones Sociológicas showed that 53.2% of residents in Barcelona identified themselves as Catholic (9.9% practising Catholics, 43.3% non-practising Catholics).[99] The province has the largest Muslim community in Spain, 322,698 people in Barcelona province are of Muslim religion.[100] A considerable number of Muslims live in Barcelona due to immigration (169 locations, mostly professed by Moroccans in Spain).[97] In 2014, 322,698 out of 5.5 million people in the province of Barcelona identified themselves as Muslim,[100] which makes 5.6% of the total population. The city also has the largest Jewish community in Spain, with an estimated 3,500 Jews living in the city.[101] There are also a number of other groups, including Evangelical (71 locations, mostly professed by Roma), Jehovah's Witnesses (21 Kingdom Halls), Buddhists (13 locations),[102] and Eastern Orthodox.[103] The Barcelona metropolitan area comprises over 66% of the people of Catalonia, one of the richer regions in Europe and the fourth richest region per capita in Spain, with a GDP per capita amounting to €28,400 (16% more than the EU average). The greater Barcelona metropolitan area had a GDP amounting to $177 billion (equivalent to $34,821 in per capita terms, 44% more than the EU average), making it the 4th most economically powerful city by gross GDP in the European Union, and 35th in the world in 2009.[104] Barcelona city had a very high GDP of €80,894 per head in 2004, according to Eurostat.[105] Furthermore, Barcelona was Europe's fourth best business city and fastest improving European city, with growth improved by 17% per year as of 2009[update].[106] Barcelona was the 24th most \"livable city\" in the world in 2015 according to lifestyle magazine Monocle.[107] Similarly, according to Innovation Analysts 2thinknow, Barcelona occupies 13th place in the world on Innovation Cities™ Global Index.[108] At the same time it is according to the Global Wealth and Lifestyle Report 2020 one of the most affordable cities in the world for a luxury lifestyle.[109] Barcelona has a long-standing mercantile tradition. Less well known is that the city industrialized early, taking off in 1833, when Catalonia's already sophisticated textile industry began to use steam power. It became the first and most important industrial city in the Mediterranean basin. Since then, manufacturing has played a large role in its history. Borsa de Barcelona (Barcelona Stock Exchange) is the main stock exchange in the northeastern part of the Iberian Peninsula. Barcelona was recognized as the Southern European City of the Future for 2014/15, based on its economic potential,[110] by FDi Magazine in their bi-annual rankings.[111] It also has several congress halls, notably Fira de Barcelona – the second largest trade fair and exhibition centre in Europe, that host a quickly growing number of national and international events each year (at present above 50). The total exhibition floor space of Fira de Barcelona venues is 405,000 m2 (41 ha), not counting Gran Via centre on the Plaza de Europa. However, the Eurozone crisis and deep cuts in business travel affected the council's positioning of the city as a convention centre. An important business centre, the World Trade Center Barcelona, is located in Barcelona's Port Vell harbour. The city is known for hosting well as world-class conferences and expositions, including the 1888 Exposición Universal de Barcelona, the 1929 Barcelona International Exposition (Expo 1929), the 2004 Universal Forum of Cultures and the 2004 World Urban Forum.[112] Barcelona was the 20th-most-visited city in the world by international visitors and the fifth most visited city in Europe after London, Paris, Istanbul and Rome, with 5.5 million international visitors in 2011.[113] By 2015, both Prague and Milan had more international visitors.[114] With its popular tree-lined pedestrian street, Les Rambles (Las Ramblas), Barcelona is ranked the most popular city to visit in Spain.[115] Barcelona is an internationally renowned tourist destination, with numerous recreational areas, one of the best beaches in the world,[116][117] mild and warm climate, historical monuments, including eight UNESCO World Heritage Sites, 519 hotels as of March 2016[update][118] including 35 five-star hotels,[119] and developed tourist infrastructure. Due to its large influx of tourists each year, Barcelona, like many other tourism capitals, has to deal with pickpockets, with wallets and passports being commonly stolen items. Despite its moderate pickpocket rate, Barcelona is considered one of the safest cities in terms of security and personal safety,[120] mainly because of a sophisticated policing strategy that has dropped crime by 32% in just over three years and has led it to be considered the 15th safest city in the world by Business Insider in 2016.[121] While tourism produces economic benefits, according to one report,[citation needed] the city is \"overrun [by] hordes of tourists\". In early 2017, over 150,000 protesters warned that tourism is destabilizing the city. Slogans included \"Tourists go home\", \"Barcelona is not for sale\" and \"We will not be driven out\". By then, the number of visitors had increased from 1.7 million in 1990 to 32 million in a city with a population of 1.62 million, increasing the cost of rental housing for residents and overcrowding the public places. While tourists spent an estimated €30 billion in 2017, they are viewed by some as a threat to Barcelona's identity.[122] A May 2017 article in the British online daily The Independent included Barcelona among the \"Eight Places That Hate Tourists the Most\" and included a comment from Mayor Ada Colau, \"We don't want the city to become a cheap souvenir shop\", citing Venice as an example.[123] To moderate the problem, the city has stopped issuing licenses for new hotels and holiday apartments; it also fined AirBnb €30,000. The mayor has suggested introducing a new tourist tax and setting a limit on the number of visitors.[123] One industry insider, Justin Francis, founder of the Responsible Travel agency, stated that steps must be taken to limit the number of visitors that are causing an \"overtourism crisis\" in several major European cities. \"Ultimately, residents must be prioritised over tourists for housing, infrastructure and access to services because they have a long-term stake in the city's success\", he said.[124] \"Managing tourism more responsibly can help\", Francis later told a journalist, \"but some destinations may just have too many tourists, and Barcelona may be a case of that\".[125] Industry generates 21% of the total gross domestic product (GDP) of the region,[126] with the energy, chemical and metallurgy industries accounting for 47% of industrial production.[127] The Barcelona metropolitan area had 67% of the total number of industrial establishments in Catalonia as of 1997.[128] Barcelona has long been an important European automobile manufacturing centre. Formerly there were automobile factories of AFA, Abadal, Actividades Industriales, Alvarez, America, Artés de Arcos, Balandrás, Baradat-Esteve, Biscúter, J. Castro, Clúa, David, Delfín, Díaz y Grilló, Ebro trucks, Edis [ca], Elizalde, Automóviles España, Eucort, Fenix, Fábrica Hispano, Auto Academia Garriga, Fábrica Española de Automóviles Hebe, Hispano-Suiza, Huracán Motors, Talleres Hereter, Junior SL, Kapi, La Cuadra, M.A., Automóviles Matas, Motores y Motos, Nacional Custals, National Pescara, Nacional RG, Nacional Rubi, Nacional Sitjes, Automóviles Nike, Orix, Otro Ford, Patria, Pegaso, PTV, Ricart, Ricart-España, Industrias Salvador, Siata Española, Stevenson, Romagosa y Compañía, Garaje Storm, Talleres Hereter, Trimak, Automóviles Victoria, Manufacturas Mecánicas Aleu.[129][130] Today, the headquarters and a large factory of SEAT (the largest Spanish automobile manufacturer) are in one of its suburbs. There is also a Nissan factory in the logistics and industrial area of the city.[131] The factory of Derbi, a large manufacturer of motorcycles, scooters and mopeds, also lies near the city.[132] As in other modern cities, the manufacturing sector has long since been overtaken by the services sector, though it remains very important. The region's leading industries are textiles, chemical, pharmaceutical, motor, electronic, printing, logistics, publishing, in telecommunications industry and culture the notable Mobile World Congress, and information technology services. The traditional importance of textiles is reflected in Barcelona's drive to become a major fashion centre. There have been many attempts to launch Barcelona as a fashion capital, notably Gaudi Home.[citation needed] Beginning in the summer of 2000, the city hosted the Bread & Butter urban fashion fair until 2009, when its organizers announced that it would be returning to Berlin. This was a hard blow for the city as the fair brought €100 m to the city in just three days.[133][134] From 2009, The Brandery, an urban fashion show, was held in Barcelona twice a year until 2012. According to the Global Language Monitor's annual ranking of the world's top fifty fashion capitals Barcelona was named as the seventh most important fashion capital of the world right after Milan and before Berlin in 2015.[135] As the capital of the autonomous community of Catalonia, Barcelona is the seat of the Catalan government, known as the Generalitat de Catalunya; of particular note are the executive branch, the parliament, and the High Court of Justice of Catalonia. The city is also the capital of the Province of Barcelona and the Barcelonès comarca (district). Barcelona is governed by a city council formed by 41 city councillors, elected for a four-year term by universal suffrage. As one of the two biggest cities in Spain, Barcelona is subject to a special law articulated through the Carta Municipal (Municipal Law). A first version of this law was passed in 1960 and amended later, but the current version was approved in March 2006.[136] According to this law, Barcelona's city council is organized in two levels: a political one, with elected city councillors, and one executive, which administers the programs and executes the decisions taken on the political level.[137] This law also gives the local government a special relationship with the central government and it also gives the mayor wider prerogatives by the means of municipal executive commissions.[138] It expands the powers of the city council in areas like telecommunications, city traffic, road safety and public safety. It also gives a special economic regime to the city's treasury and it gives the council a veto in matters that will be decided by the central government, but that will need a favourable report from the council.[136] The Comissió de Govern (Government Commission) is the executive branch, formed by 24 councillors, led by the Mayor, with 5 lieutenant-mayors and 17 city councillors, each in charge of an area of government, and 5 non-elected councillors.[139] The plenary, formed by the 41 city councillors, has advisory, planning, regulatory, and fiscal executive functions.[140] The six Commissions del Consell Municipal (City council commissions) have executive and controlling functions in the field of their jurisdiction. They are composed by a number of councillors proportional to the number of councillors each political party has in the plenary.[141] The city council has jurisdiction in the fields of city planning, transportation, municipal taxes, public highways security through the Guàrdia Urbana (the municipal police), city maintenance, gardens, parks and environment, facilities (like schools, nurseries, sports centres, libraries, and so on), culture, sports, youth and social welfare. Some of these competencies are not exclusive, but shared with the Generalitat de Catalunya or the central Spanish government. In some fields with shared responsibility (such as public health, education or social services), there is a shared Agency or Consortium between the city and the Generalitat to plan and manage services.[142] The executive branch is led by a Chief Municipal Executive Officer which answers to the Mayor. It is made up of departments which are legally part of the city council and by separate legal entities of two types: autonomous public departments and public enterprises.[143] The seat of the city council is on the Plaça de Sant Jaume, opposite the seat of Generalitat de Catalunya. Since the coming of the Spanish democracy, Barcelona had been governed by the PSC, first with an absolute majority and later in coalition with ERC and ICV. After the May 2007 election, the ERC did not renew the coalition agreement and the PSC governed in a minority coalition with ICV as the junior partner. After 32 years, on 22 May 2011, CiU gained a plurality of seats at the municipal election, gaining 15 seats to the PSC's 11. The PP hold 8 seats, ICV 5 and ERC 2. Since 1987, the city has been divided into 10 administrative districts (districtes in Catalan, distritos in Spanish): The districts are based mostly on historical divisions, and several are former towns annexed by the city of Barcelona in the 18th and 19th centuries that still maintain their own distinct character. Each district has its own council led by a city councillor. The composition of each district council depends on the number of votes each political party had in that district, so a district can be led by a councillor from a different party than the executive council. Barcelona has a well-developed higher education system of public universities. Most prominent among these are the University of Barcelona (established in 1450) and the more modern Pompeu Fabra University.[144][145] Barcelona is also home to the Polytechnic University of Catalonia, and in the private sector the EADA Business School (founded in 1957), which became the first Barcelona institution to run manager training programmes for the business community. IESE Business School, as well as the largest private educational institution, the Ramon Llull University, which encompasses schools and institutes such as the ESADE Business School. The Autonomous University of Barcelona, another public university, is located in Bellaterra, a town in the Metropolitan Area. Toulouse Business School and the Open University of Catalonia (a private Internet-centred open university) are also based in Barcelona. The city has a network of public schools, from nurseries to high schools, under the responsibility of a consortium led by city council (though the curriculum is the responsibility of the Generalitat de Catalunya). There are also many private schools, some of them Roman Catholic. Most such schools receive a public subsidy on a per-student basis, are subject to inspection by the public authorities, and are required to follow the same curricular guidelines as public schools, though they charge tuition. Known as escoles concertades, they are distinct from schools whose funding is entirely private (escoles privades). The language of instruction at public schools and escoles concertades is Catalan, as stipulated by the 2009 Catalan Education Act. Spanish may be used as a language of instruction by teachers of Spanish literature or language, and foreign languages by teachers of those languages. An experimental partial immersion programme adopted by some schools allows for the teaching of a foreign language (English, generally) across the curriculum, though this is limited to a maximum of 30% of the school day. No public school or escola concertada in Barcelona may offer 50% or full immersion programmes in a foreign language, nor does any public school or escola concertada offer International Baccalaureate programmes. Barcelona's cultural roots go back 2000 years. Since the arrival of democracy, the Catalan language (very much repressed during the dictatorship of Franco) has been promoted, both by recovering works from the past and by stimulating the creation of new works. Barcelona is designated as a world-class city by the Globalization and World Cities Study Group and Network.[146] It has also been part of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network as a City of Literature since 2015.[147] Barcelona has many venues for live music and theatre, including the world-renowned Gran Teatre del Liceu opera house, the Teatre Nacional de Catalunya, the Teatre Lliure and the Palau de la Música Catalana concert hall. Barcelona also is home to the Barcelona Symphony and Catalonia National Orchestra (Orquestra Simfònica de Barcelona i Nacional de Catalunya, usually known as OBC), the largest symphonic orchestra in Catalonia. In 1999, the OBC inaugurated its new venue in the brand-new Auditorium (L'Auditori). It performs around 75 concerts per season and its current director is Eiji Oue.[148] It is home to the Barcelona Guitar Orchestra, directed by Sergi Vicente. The major thoroughfare of La Rambla is home to mime artists and street performers. Yearly, two major pop music festivals take place in the city, the Sónar Festival and the Primavera Sound Festival. The city also has a thriving alternative music scene, with groups such as The Pinker Tones receiving international attention.[149] Barcelona is an international hub of highly active and diverse nightlife with bars, dance bars and nightclubs staying open well past midnight.[150] El Periódico de Catalunya, La Vanguardia and Ara are Barcelona's three major daily newspapers (the first two with Catalan and Spanish editions, Ara only in Catalan) while Sport and El Mundo Deportivo (both in Spanish) are the city's two major sports daily newspapers, published by the same companies. The city is also served by a number of smaller publications such as Ara and El Punt Avui (in Catalan), by nationwide newspapers with special Barcelona editions such as El País (in Spanish, with an online version in Catalan) and El Mundo (in Spanish), and by several free newspapers like 20 minutos and Què (all bilingual). Barcelona's oldest and main online newspaper VilaWeb is also the oldest one in Europe[citation needed] (with Catalan and English editions). Several major FM stations include Catalunya Ràdio, RAC 1, RAC 105 and Cadena SER. Barcelona also has a local TV station, Betevé, owned by city council. The headquarters of Televisió de Catalunya, Catalonia's public network, are located in Sant Joan Despí, in Barcelona's metropolitan area. Barcelona has a long sporting tradition and hosted the highly successful 1992 Summer Olympics as well as several matches during the 1982 FIFA World Cup (at the two stadiums). It has hosted about 30 sports events of international significance.[citation needed] FC Barcelona is a sports club best known worldwide for its football team, one of the largest and the wealthiest in the world.[151] It has 74 national trophies (while finishing 46 times as runners-up) and 17 continental prizes (with being runners-up 11 times), including five UEFA Champions League trophies out of eight finals and three FIFA Club World Cup wins out of four finals. The club won six trophies in a calendar year in 2009, becoming one of only 2 male football teams in the world to win the coveted sextuple, apart from FC Bayern Munich in 2020. FC Barcelona also has professional teams in other sports like FC Barcelona Regal (basketball), FC Barcelona Handbol (handball), FC Barcelona Hoquei (roller hockey), FC Barcelona Ice Hockey (ice hockey), FC Barcelona Futsal (futsal) and FC Barcelona Rugby (rugby union), all at one point winners of the highest national or European competitions. The club's museum is the second most visited in Catalonia. The matches against cross-town rivals RCD Espanyol are of particular interest, but there are other Barcelonan football clubs in lower categories, like CE Europa and UE Sant Andreu. FC Barcelona's basketball team has a noted rivalry in the Liga ACB with nearby Joventut Badalona. Barcelona has three UEFA elite stadiums: FC Barcelona's Camp Nou, the largest stadium in Europe with a capacity of 99,354; the publicly owned Estadi Olímpic Lluís Companys, with a capacity of 55,926; used for the 1992 Olympics; and Estadi Cornellà-El Prat, with a capacity of 40,500. Furthermore, the city has several smaller stadiums such as Mini Estadi (also owned by FC Barcelona) with a capacity of 15,000, Camp Municipal Narcís Sala with a capacity of 6,563 and Nou Sardenya with a capacity of 7,000. The city has a further three multifunctional venues for sports and concerts: the Palau Sant Jordi with a capacity of 12,000 to 24,000 (depending on use), the Palau Blaugrana with a capacity of 7,500, and the Palau dels Esports de Barcelona with a capacity of 3,500. Barcelona was the host city for the 2013 World Aquatics Championships, which were held at the Palau San Jordi.[152] Several road running competitions are organized year-round in Barcelona: the Barcelona Marathon every March with over 10,000 participants in 2010, the Cursa de Bombers in April, the Cursa de El Corte Inglés in May (with about 60,000 participants each year), the Cursa de la Mercè, the Cursa Jean Bouin, the Milla Sagrada Família and the San Silvestre. There is also the Ultratrail Collserola which passes 85 km (53 mi) through the Collserola forest. The Open Seat Godó, a 50-year-old ATP World Tour 500 Series tennis tournament, is held annually in the facilities of the Real Club de Tenis Barcelona. Each year on Christmas Day, a 200-meter swimming race across the Old Port of Barcelona takes place.[153] Near Barcelona, in Montmeló, the 107,000 capacity Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya racetrack hosts the Formula One Spanish Grand Prix, the Catalan motorcycle Grand Prix, the Spanish GT Championship and races in the GP2 Series. Skateboarding and cycling are also very popular in Barcelona; in and around the city there are dozens of kilometers of bicycle paths.[citation needed] Barcelona is also home to numerous social centres and illegal squats that effectively form a shadow society mainly made up of the unemployed, immigrants, dropouts, anarchists, anti-authoritarians and autonomists.[154] Peter Gelderloos estimates that there around 200 squatted buildings and 40 social centres across the city with thousands of inhabitants, making it one of the largest squatter movements in the world. He notes that they pirate electricity, internet and water allowing them to live on less than one euro a day. He argues that these squats embrace an anarcho-communist and anti-work philosophy, often freely fixing up new houses, cleaning, patching roofs, installing windows, toilets, showers, lights and kitchens. In the wake of austerity, the squats have provided a number of social services to the surrounding residents, including bicycle repair workshops, carpentry workshops, self-defense classes, free libraries, community gardens, free meals, computer labs, language classes, theatre groups, free medical care and legal support services.[155] The squats help elderly residents avoid eviction and organize various protests throughout Barcelona. Notable squats include Can Vies and Can Masdeu.[citation needed] Barcelona is served by Barcelona-El Prat Airport, about 17 km (11 mi) south-west of the centre of Barcelona. It is the second-largest airport in Spain, and the largest on the Mediterranean coast, which handled more than 50.17 million passengers in 2018, showing an annual upward trend.[156] It is a main hub for Vueling Airlines and Ryanair, and also a focus for Iberia and Air Europa. The airport mainly serves domestic and European destinations, although some airlines offer destinations in Latin America, Asia and the United States. The airport is connected to the city by highway, metro (Airport T1 and Airport T2 stations), commuter train (Barcelona Airport railway station) and scheduled bus service. A new terminal (T1) has been built, and entered service on 17 June 2009. Some low-cost airlines, also use Girona-Costa Brava Airport, about 90 km (56 mi) to the north, Reus Airport, 77 km (48 mi) to the south, or Lleida-Alguaire Airport, about 150 km (93 mi) to the west, of the city. Sabadell Airport is a smaller airport in the nearby town of Sabadell, devoted to pilot training, aerotaxi and private flights. The Port of Barcelona has a 2000-year-old history and a great contemporary commercial importance. It is Europe's ninth largest container port, with a trade volume of 1.72 million TEU's in 2013.[157] The port is managed by the Port Authority of Barcelona. Its 10 km2 (4 sq mi) are divided into three zones: Port Vell (the old port), the commercial port and the logistics port (Barcelona Free Port). The port is undergoing an enlargement that will double its size thanks to diverting the mouth of the Llobregat river 2 km (1 mi) to the south.[158] The Barcelona harbour is the leading European cruiser port and a very important Mediterranean turnaround base.[159] In 2013, 3.6 million pleasure cruise passengers used the Port of Barcelona.[157] The Port Vell area also houses the Maremagnum (a commercial mall), a multiplex cinema, the IMAX Port Vell and one of Europe's largest aquariums – Aquarium Barcelona, containing 8,000 fish and 11 sharks contained in 22 basins filled with 4 million litres of sea water. The Maremagnum, being situated within the confines of the port, is the only commercial mall in the city that can open on Sundays and public holidays. Barcelona is a major hub for the Spanish rail network. The city's main Inter-city rail station is Barcelona Sants railway station, whilst Estació de França terminus serves a secondary role handling suburban, regional and medium distance services. Freight services operate to local industries and to the Port of Barcelona. RENFE's AVE high-speed rail system, which is designed for speeds of 310 km/h (193 mph), was extended from Madrid to Barcelona in 2008 in the form of the Madrid–Barcelona high-speed rail line. A shared RENFE-SNCF high-speed rail connecting Barcelona and France (Paris, Marseilles and Toulouse, through Perpignan–Barcelona high-speed rail line) was launched in 2013. Both these lines serve Barcelona Sants terminal station.[160][161] Barcelona is served by an extensive local public transport network that includes a metro system, a bus network, a regional railway system, trams, funiculars, rack railways, a Gondola lift and aerial cable cars. These networks and lines are run by a number of different operators but they are integrated into a coordinated fare system, administered by the Autoritat del Transport Metropolità (ATM). The system is divided into fare zones (1 to 6) and various Integrated Travel Cards are available.[162] The Barcelona Metro network comprises twelve lines, identified by an \"L\" followed by the line number as well as by individual colours. The Metro largely runs underground; eight Metro lines are operated on dedicated track by the Transports Metropolitans de Barcelona (TMB), whilst four lines are operated by the Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya (FGC) and some of them share tracks with RENFE commuter lines. In addition to the city Metro, several regional rail lines operated by RENFE's Rodalies de Catalunya run across the city, providing connections to outlying towns in the surrounding region. The city's two modern tram systems, Trambaix and Trambesòs, are operated by TRAMMET.[163] A heritage tram line, the Tramvia Blau, also operates between the metro Line 7 and the Funicular del Tibidabo.[164] Barcelona's metro and rail system is supplemented by several aerial cable cars, funiculars and rack railways that provide connections to mountain-top stations. FGC operates the Funicular de Tibidabo up the hill of Tibidabo and the Funicular de Vallvidrera (FGC), while TMB runs the Funicular de Montjuïc up Montjuïc. The city has two aerial cable cars: the Montjuïc Cable Car, which serves Montjuïc castle, and the Port Vell Aerial Tramway that runs via Torre Jaume I and Torre Sant Sebastià over the port. Buses in Barcelona are a major form of public transport, with extensive local, interurban and night bus networks. Most local services are operated by the TMB, although some other services are operated by a number of private companies, albeit still within the ATM fare structure. There are 21 night lines, 19 of them go through Plaça de Catalunya, where you can change to other lines. The frequency is 15/20 minutes between 22:20 and 06:00. A separate private bus line, known as Aerobús, links the airport with the city centre, with its own fare structure. The Estació del Nord (Northern Station), a former railway station which was renovated for the 1992 Olympic Games, now serves as the terminus for long-distance and regional bus services. Barcelona has a metered taxi fleet governed by the Institut Metropolità del Taxi (Metropolitan Taxi Institute), composed of more than 10,000 cars. Most of the licences are in the hands of self-employed drivers. With their black and yellow livery, Barcelona's taxis are easily spotted, and can be caught from one of many taxi ranks, hailed on street, called by telephone or via app.[165][166] On 22 March 2007,[167] Barcelona's City Council started the Bicing service, a bicycle service understood as a public transport. Once the user has their user card, they can take a bicycle from any of the more than 400 stations spread around the city and use it anywhere the urban area of the city, and then leave it at another station.[168] The service has been a success, with 50,000 subscribed users in three months.[169] Barcelona lies on three international routes, including European route E15 that follows the Mediterranean coast, European route E90 to Madrid and Lisbon, and European route E09 to Paris. It is also served by a comprehensive network of motorways and highways throughout the metropolitan area, including A-2, A-7/AP-7, C-16, C-17, C-31, C-32, C-33, C-60. The city is circled by three half ring roads or bypasses, Ronda de Dalt (B-20) (on the mountain side), Ronda del Litoral (B-10) (along the coast) and Ronda del Mig (separated into two parts: Travessera de Dalt in the north and the Gran Via de Carles III), two partially covered[170] fast highways with several exits that bypass the city. The city's main arteries include Diagonal Avenue, which crosses it diagonally, Meridiana Avenue which leads to Glòries and connects with Diagonal Avenue and Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes, which crosses the city from east to west, passing through its centre. The famous boulevard of La Rambla, whilst no longer an important vehicular route, remains an important pedestrian route. The Barri Gòtic (Catalan for \"Gothic Quarter\") is the centre of the old city of Barcelona. Many of the buildings date from medieval times, some from as far back as the Roman settlement of Barcelona. Catalan modernista architecture (related to the movement known as Art Nouveau in the rest of Europe) developed between 1885 and 1950 and left an important legacy in Barcelona. Several of these buildings are World Heritage Sites. Especially remarkable is the work of architect Antoni Gaudí, which can be seen throughout the city. His best-known work is the immense but still unfinished church of the Sagrada Família, which has been under construction since 1882 and is still financed by private donations. As of 2015[update], completion is planned for 2026.[171] Barcelona was also home to Mies van der Rohe's Barcelona Pavilion. Designed in 1929 for the International Exposition for Germany, it was an iconic building that came to symbolize modern architecture as the embodiment of van der Rohe's aphorisms \"less is more\" and \"God is in the details\".[172] The Barcelona pavilion was intended as a temporary structure and was torn down in 1930 less than a year after it was constructed. A modern re-creation by Spanish architects now stands in Barcelona, however, constructed in 1986. Barcelona won the 1999 RIBA Royal Gold Medal for its architecture,[173] the first (and as of 2015[update], only) time that the winner has been a city rather than an individual architect. Barcelona is the home of many points of interest declared World Heritage Sites by UNESCO:[174] Barcelona has a great number of museums, which cover different areas and eras. The National Museum of Art of Catalonia possesses a well-known collection of Romanesque art, while the Barcelona Museum of Contemporary Art focuses on post-1945 Catalan and Spanish art. The Fundació Joan Miró, Picasso Museum, and Fundació Antoni Tàpies hold important collections of these world-renowned artists, as well as the Can Framis Museum, focused on post-1960 Catalan Art owned by Fundació Vila Casas. Several museums cover the fields of history and archaeology, like the Barcelona City History Museum (MUHBA), the Museum of the History of Catalonia, the Archeology Museum of Catalonia, the Maritime Museum of Barcelona, the Music Museum of Barcelona and the privately owned Egyptian Museum. The Erotic museum of Barcelona is among the most peculiar ones, while CosmoCaixa is a science museum that received the European Museum of the Year Award in 2006.[175] The Museum of Natural Sciences of Barcelona was founded in 1882 under the name of \"Museo Martorell de Arqueología y Ciencias Naturales\"[176][177] (Spanish for \"Martorell Museum of Archaeology and Natural Sciences\"). In 2011 the Museum of Natural Sciences ended up with a merge of five institutions: the Museum of Natural Sciences of Barcelona (the main site, at the Forum Building), the Martorell Museum (the historical seat of the Museum, opened to the public from 1924 to 2010 as a geology museum), the Laboratori de Natura, at the Castle of the Three Dragons (from 1920 to 2010: the Zoology Museum), the Historical Botanical Garden of Barcelona, founded 1930, and the Botanical garden of Barcelona, founded 1999. Those two gardens are a part of the Botanical Institute of Barcelona too. The FC Barcelona Museum is the third most popular tourist attraction in Catalonia, with 1,51 million visitors in 2013.[178] Barcelona contains sixty municipal parks, twelve of which are historic, five of which are thematic (botanical), forty-five of which are urban, and six of which are forest.[179] They range from vest-pocket parks to large recreation areas. The urban parks alone cover 10% of the city (549.7 ha or 1,358.3 acres).[74] The total park surface grows about 10 ha (25 acres) per year,[180] with a proportion of 18.1 m2 (195 sq ft) of park area per inhabitant.[181] Of Barcelona's parks, Montjuïc is the largest, with 203 ha located on the mountain of the same name, and includes the Botanical Garden of Barcelona, the Mossèn Costa i Llobera Gardens, and more.[74] It is followed by Parc de la Ciutadella (which occupies the site of the old citadel and which houses the Parliament building, the Barcelona Zoo, and several museums); 31 ha or 76.6 acres including the zoo), the Guinardó Park (19 ha or 47.0 acres), Park Güell (designed by Antoni Gaudí; 17.2 ha or 42.5 acres), Oreneta Castle Park (also 17.2 ha or 42.5 acres), Diagonal Mar Park (13.3 ha or 32.9 acres, inaugurated in 2002), Nou Barris Central Park (13.2 ha or 32.6 acres), Can Dragó Sports Park and Poblenou Park (both 11.9 ha or 29.4 acres), the Labyrinth Park (9.10 ha or 22.5 acres), named after the garden maze it contains.[74] There are also several smaller parks, for example, the Parc de Les Aigües (2 ha or 4.9 acres). A part of the Collserola Park is also within the city limits. PortAventura World, one of the largest resort in Europe, with 5,837,509 visitors per year, is located one hour's drive from Barcelona.[182][183] Also, within the city lies Tibidabo Amusement Park, a smaller amusement park in Plaza del Tibidabo, with the Muntanya Russa amusement ride. Barcelona beach was listed as number one in a list of the top ten city beaches in the world according to National Geographic[116] and Discovery Channel.[184] Barcelona contains seven beaches, totalling 4.5 km (2+3⁄4 mi) of coastline. Sant Sebastià, Barceloneta and Somorrostro beaches, both 1,100 m (3,610 ft) in length,[74] are the largest, oldest and the most-frequented beaches in Barcelona. The Olympic Harbour separates them from the other city beaches: Nova Icària, Bogatell, Mar Bella, Nova Mar Bella and Llevant. These beaches (ranging from 400 to 640 m (1,310 to 2,100 ft) were opened as a result of the city restructuring to host the 1992 Summer Olympics, when a great number of industrial buildings were demolished. At present, the beach sand is artificially replenished given that storms regularly remove large quantities of material. The 2004 Universal Forum of Cultures left the city a large concrete bathing zone on the eastmost part of the city's coastline. Most recently, Llevant is the first beach to allow dogs access during summer season. Barcelona is twinned with:[185] Barcelona also cooperates with:[185]",

WhatsApp, a popular service outside the U.S. for making calls to other users of the service, had reports of problems from users in countries including Argentina and Brazil. Wednesday's outage follows widespread issues with Meta's apps in March, when more than half a million users reported widespread issues, such as getting booted out of the social media platforms and unable to log back in.

                "content": "Garrett Nolan Crochet (/kroʊˈʃeɪ/; born June 21, 1999) is an American professional baseball pitcher for the Boston Red Sox of Major League Baseball (MLB). He has previously played in MLB for the Chicago White Sox. He made his MLB debut in 2020. The White Sox selected Crochet with the 11th overall selection of the 2020 MLB draft out of the University of Tennessee. Crochet was called up in September by the White Sox to become the first MLB player in six years to reach the big leagues in the same year in which he was drafted.[1][2] Crochet grew up in Ocean Springs, Mississippi, and attended Ocean Springs High School. During his junior season, he posted a 3–0 win–loss record with a 0.51 earned run average (ERA) and 25 strikeouts in 27+2⁄3 innings pitched. Following the season, Crochet initially committed to play college baseball at Jones County Junior College.[3] As a senior, he went 6–4 with a 1.48 ERA and 76 strikeouts to draw late recruiting interest from many top collegiate programs, including Texas and Tennessee.[4][5] Crochet was selected by the Milwaukee Brewers in the 34th round of the 2017 Major League Baseball draft, but chose not to sign and instead enrolled at Tennessee.[6][7] As a true freshman at Tennessee in 2018, Crochet appeared in 17 games with 11 starts, posting a 5–6 record with a 5.51 ERA and 62 strikeouts.[8] In 2019, his sophomore year, he went 5–3 with a 4.02 ERA over 18 appearances (six starts), missing the SEC Tournament after suffering a broken jaw in his last regular season start.[9][10] After the season Crochet was invited to training camp for the United States Collegiate National Baseball Team,[11][12] and entered his junior season as a first team preseason All-American by Baseball America and on the watch list for the Golden Spikes Award.[13][14][15] Crochet missed the first three weeks of the season due to arm soreness,[16] then appeared in one game before the college baseball season was cut short due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The White Sox selected Crochet in the first round, with the 11th overall selection, in the 2020 Major League Baseball draft,[17] and he signed a contract on June 22, 2020, that included a $4,547,500 bonus.[18] On September 18, 2020, Crochet became the first player from the 2020 MLB Draft class to be promoted to the major leagues. He is the 22nd player to go straight from the draft to the majors without playing in the minor leagues, and the first since Mike Leake in 2010 and was the first player to be promoted in their draft year since Brandon Finnegan in 2014.[19] With the 2020 Chicago White Sox, Crochet appeared in five games, not allowing a run in six innings pitched while consistently throwing 100 miles per hour (160 km/h).[20][21] He came out of the bullpen to strike out both batters he faced in Chicago's 6–4 loss to the Oakland Athletics in the decisive Game 3 of the 2020 American League Wild Card Series before leaving with forearm tightness.[22] Crochet had his first full season in 2021, when he recorded a 2.82 ERA with 65 strikeouts in 54+1⁄3 innings. He would miss the entire 2022 season after undergoing Tommy John surgery on April 2.[23] In 2023, Crochet made his return from surgery, appearing in 13 games and recording a 3.55 ERA with 12 strikeouts across 12+2⁄3 innings pitched.[24] On March 18, 2024, Crochet was named the White Sox Opening Day starting pitcher.[25] In his first start, Crochet went 6 innings giving up 5 hits, one run, and striking out 8 batters in a 1–0 loss to the Detroit Tigers. He was named MLB Pitcher of the Month for June that year becoming the 17th White Sox pitcher to do so. In the month of June, Crochet went 1–1 with an ERA of 1.91 with a 0.93 WHIP in 37+2⁄3 innings while striking out 56 batters in six starts.[26] On July 7, Crochet would be named to his first All-Star Game in his career.[27] In the first half of the season, Crochet was 6–6 with an 3.02 ERA and a WHIP of 0.95 in 20 starts in 107+1⁄3 innings, while leading the league in strikeouts with 150 and strikeouts per 9 innings at 12.6. Crochet made 32 starts for the White Sox in 2024, posting a 3.58 ERA with 209 strikeouts across 146 innings pitched, setting a new career-high.[28] After the season, he was named AL Comeback Player of the Year.[29] On December 11, 2024, Crochet was traded to the Boston Red Sox in exchange for prospects Kyle Teel, Braden Montgomery, Chase Meidroth and Wikelman González.[30]",

                "content": "MLB.com The Red Sox and White Sox provided the biggest blockbuster of the offseason so far on Wednesday night when Boston acquired All-Star left-hander Garrett Crochet from Chicago in exchange for a significant prospect haul. TRADE DETAILSRed Sox get: LHP Garrett CrochetWhite Sox get: C Kyle Teel (No. 25 overall prospect), OF Braden Montgomery (No. 54 overall), INF Chase Meidroth (BOS No. 11 prospect), Wikelman Gonzalez (BOS No. 14 prospect) Here is a breakdown of this intriguing exchange from all angles, via MLB.com experts. Why it makes sense for the Red SoxVia Red Sox beat writer Ian Browne The Red Sox were able to pull off the deal without subtracting anyone from the strong young core of their Major League roster, leaving the club with a robust stable of position players and now the front-line pitcher for the rotation that Breslow has coveted all winter. Breslow had engaged in talks with the two lefties in the free-agent market in Blake Snell and Max Fried. After losing Snell to the Dodgers last week and Fried to the rival Yankees on Tuesday, the Red Sox responded with their big answer, one that won’t need a big financial commitment, at least off the bat. Crochet has two arbitration-eligible seasons left. Though Crochet doesn’t have the extended track record of excellence Sale had eight years ago, the upside is comparable. The 25-year-old, who debuted in 2020, bounced back from Tommy John surgery in 2022 to become the bright light in a rough season for the White Sox. Crochet was an All-Star for Chicago in 2024, his first year as a starting pitcher in the Majors. While pitching 146 innings -- the White Sox had him on a pitch count down the stretch -- Crochet had 209 strikeouts with just 33 walks. He had a 1.07 WHIP and averaged 12.9 strikeouts per nine innings. More >> Why it makes sense for the White SoxVia White Sox beat writer Scott Merkin Crochet was arguably the best starting pitcher in the Majors at the 2024 All-Star break, and with one full year as a starter behind him and his innings restrictions lifted, he only figures to get better after 209 strikeouts over 146 innings and 32 starts. So why trade the 25-year-old southpaw? The White Sox had two years of contractual control over the rotation ace and team leader, and the club doesn't figure to be compete for a title during that time. General manager Chris Getz is leading a total rebuild for this organization, ranging from improving the infrastructure to the overall talent core, and this was a chance to get four players from among Boston’s Top 14 prospects, per MLB Pipeline. Call it a rebuild accelerator. “We'll get a better idea come Spring Training; some have more experience at Triple-A than others,” Getz said on Wednesday afternoon at the close of the Winter Meetings. “But we're talking about upper-level talent. We want these guys ready to go in Spring Training, competing for spots.\" Teel (MLB's No. 25 overall prospect), who was part of the four-player return from Boston, and Edgar Quero (No. 59) give the White Sox two catchers in MLB Pipeline’s Top 60 overall, along with Korey Lee, who made great strides over the course of the 2024 season. The switch-hitting Montgomery could become one of the more dynamic young offensive players in the game. He's expected to be fully healthy in 2025 after a broken right ankle sustained in Texas A&M’s Super Regional loss to Oregon prevented him from making his professional debut last season. It's a big picture look for Getz. It’s a trade benefitting both teams in terms of their immediate goals. “This is a deal that was above what we could have gotten at the [2024 Trade] Deadline from our evaluations,” Getz said. “That, more or less, set the bar for us. It wasn’t met at the Deadline and we feel like we went past that. That’s why we went forward to make the decision to make the trade.\" More >> Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball.

Teel is one of the best catching prospects in the game, a disciplined hitter with 20-homer potential who also has solid receiving skills and a strong arm behind the plate. Montgomery has classic right-field tools with well-above-average raw power and plus-plus arm strength that delivered fastballs up to 96 mph when he pitched in college. In retrospect, Teel shouldn't have lasted until the 14th pick in the 2023 Draft, and Montgomery wouldn't have made it to No. 12 last July if he hadn't broken his right ankle on an awkward slide in the NCAA Super Regionals. Meidroth, who has played all over the infield but is best suited for second base, is an on-base machine (he led the Triple-A International League with a .437 OBP), though he offers little power. Gonzalez can display a mid-90s fastball and a hammer curveball when he's on, and he led the Minors in strikeout rate (13.6 K's per nine innings) and percentage (35%) in 2023, but he regressed last season. Hot Stove implicationsVia senior national reporter Mark Feinsand The first big pitching domino on the trade market fell on the final day of the Winter Meetings with the White Sox dealing Crochet to the Red Sox for four prospects. Although none of the other potential trade candidates on the starting pitching market offer the same combination of talent and control -- both in terms of cost and years -- as Crochet, Boston’s trade should help spur some other clubs with available pitchers to get more aggressive. Luis Castillo is signed for $68.25 million over the next three years, with a vesting option for 2028 if he throws 180 innings during the 2027 season. The Mariners are loaded with starting pitching and need a bat, making Castillo a logical contract to move to acquire an impact hitter. Sonny Gray (Cardinals) is set to make $25 million in 2025 and $35 million in '26, with a $30 million club option for '27, though he has a full no-trade clause, adding a wrinkle into any potential deal. Dylan Cease (Padres) and Framber Valdez (Astros) are arbitration-eligible for the final time this winter, meaning each is set to become a free agent next offseason. Jesús Luzardo (Marlins) is arbitration-eligible for two more years before becoming a free agent, though injuries have been an issue for him during his career. The closest comps to Crochet are Clarke Schmidt and Luis Gil, two young Yankees starters who could be part of trade talks following New York’s agreement with Max Fried. Schmidt and Gil are under club control for three and four years, respectively, and the Yankees now have seven starting pitchers under contract. Diving deepVia national content editor Andrew Simon As tempting as it can be to immediately declare a winner and a loser to any trade, sometimes a swap just makes sense for both sides. That’s the case here. The Red Sox, after coming up short on both Juan Soto and Max Fried, desperately needed both a big splash and a top-of-the-rotation arm as they try to return to contention in the AL East. Crochet checks both boxes, and he instantly becomes Boston’s clear ace. FanGraphs projects him for 4.9 WAR in 2025, a huge upgrade for a Red Sox rotation that ranked 20th in projected WAR before this trade, led by Tanner Houck’s 2.9. This unit, which finished 15th in the Majors in K-rate last season (22.0%) now adds a pitcher who struck out 35.1% of batters, the highest rate in MLB (minimum 100 innings). There is certainly quite a bit of risk here, because pitchers are risky in general. Crochet in particular already has a Tommy John surgery on his record and had never started a Major League game prior to this year. But the Red Sox were in a position where they needed to take a big swing, and giving up a significant prospect haul hurts them less than it would almost any other team. Even with two of MLB Pipeline’s Top 100 prospects changing their Sox, Boston still has four remaining in its system, including Roman Anthony, Marcelo Mayer and Kristian Campbell in the top 10 and nearing the Majors. For a White Sox team trying to dig its way back from a 41-121 mess, though, Crochet’s two remaining seasons of club control did not line up with what is likely to be its next competitive window. The time was now to cash in those chips, especially given Crochet’s injury history and short (if impressive) track record of success. Chicago elected to hold on to Crochet at the Trade Deadline, and that patience seemed to pay off here. For two seasons of Crochet, the White Sox landed a stellar, four-prospect package. Catchers who can contribute on both sides of the ball are one of the toughest commodities to find, and Teel has a chance to be just that, as soon as 2025. Montgomery was just the No. 12 pick in the Draft five months ago, and even that might undersell the ultra-talented switch-hitter, who was MLB Pipeline’s No. 8 Draft prospect but sustained a broken right ankle while playing for Texas A&M in the NCAA Super Regional. Of course, prospects don’t always pan out. Look no further than the four players the White Sox acquired from the Red Sox for a different left-hander (Chris Sale), also at the Winter Meetings, almost exactly eight years ago. But at this point in time, Chris Getz and his front office needed to take their shot at jumpstarting a rebuild on the South Side, and this trade could be a big leap in that direction.",

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. The Red Sox have acquired hard-throwing left-handed starting pitcher Garrett Crochet in a trade with the Chicago White Sox, the teams announced Wednesday. The return for the White Sox is catcher Kyle Teel, outfielder Braden Montgomery, infielder Chase Meidroth and right-handed pitcher Wikelman Gonzalez. Crochet, 25, is coming off a standout 2024 season for the White Sox – one in which he pitched as a member of a big-league rotation for the first time. In 2024, Crochet made 32 starts and pitched to a 3.58 ERA/115 ERA+ with an even more promising FIP of 2.69. Most impressively, he struck out 209 batters against 33 unintentional walks in 146 innings. While he didn't work a qualifying number of innings, Crochet led all regular starting pitchers with a strikeout rate of 35.1%. His fastball, which he threw more than half the time, averaged 97.2 mph – a sky-scraping figure for any pitcher, let alone a starter. Earlier in the offseason, CBS Sports ranked Crochet as one of the leading trade candidates of the winter. While Crochet's durability and capacity to handle a heavier workload are left to question, there's no doubting his ability to dominate, particularly at the swing-and-miss level. Crochet isn't slated for free agency until after the 2026 season, so he'll be going to the Red Sox with two remaining years of team control. He's arbitration-eligible for 2025, which will mean a substantial jump over the $800,000 salary he made in 2024. The Red Sox have been reportedly aggressive throughout the offseason with big targets, but before this deal have whiffed. They were in on both Juan Soto and Max Fried until the end, for example, before losing out the Mets and Yankees, respectively. Crochet now gives the Red Sox one left-hander and has the makings of the ace of the staff. If he throws like he's capable, the Boston rotation right now could look something like this: Remember that Lucas Giolito will return at some point from Tommy John surgery and it's always possible they add another starter from outside the organization. The Red Sox went 81-81, but should be aggressive in continuing to build around a talented core. As for the White Sox, Crochet's exit is part of an ongoing deep rebuild on the South Side of Chicago – one that led to them losing a modern-record 121 games during the 2024 season. Teel was the Red Sox's first-round pick in 2023 out of the University of Virginia. He rose to Triple-A last season, getting in 28 games of action there. In his 112 games between Double-A and Triple-A last year, he hit .288/.386/.433 with 23 doubles, 13 home runs, 78 RBI, 88 runs and 12 stolen bases. He played some outfield in college but has been a primary catcher in the pros. Montgomery, 21, was the Red Sox's first-rounder this past year out of Texas A&M. He didn't get a taste of professional ball after the draft, as he broke his ankle during the NCAA tournament. As a junior in college, he hit .322/.454/.733 with 27 homers in 61 games. Meidroth was a fourth-round pick in 2022. He played all season with Triple-A Worcester last season, seeing time at second base, third base and shortstop. In 122 games, the table-setter hit .293/.437/.401 with 13 stolen bases and 87 runs. Gonzalez, 22, started 19 games and came in relief five times in Double-A last season, pitching to a 4.73 ERA and 1.26 WHIP with 92 strikeouts against 46 walks in 83 ⅔ innings. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive.

                "content": "College Baseball, MLB Draft, Prospects – Baseball America Image credit: Garrett Crochet (Photo by Melissa Tamez/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images) As the Winter Meetings neared their conclusion, the Red Sox reportedly swung a deal with the White Sox to acquire lefthanded fireballer Garrett Crochet and place him atop their rotation. The move answers the one the rival Yankees made a day earlier when they signed former Braves lefty Max Fried to a long-term deal. In return, the White Sox buttressed their farm system with a package of prospects that included the team’s last two first-rounders—catcher Kyle Teel and outfielder Braden Montgomery—as well as infielder Chase Meidroth and righthander Wikelman Gonzalez, according to The Athletic’s Ken Rosenthal. RED SOX RECEIVE – LHP Garrett CrochetWHITE SOX RECEIVE – C Kyle Teel (Boston's No. 4 Prospect)– OF Braden Montgomery (Boston's No. 6 Prospect) – SS Chase Meidroth (Boston's No. 8 Prospect)– RHP Wikelman GonzalezScouting reports⬇️ (Trade returns per Ken Rosenthal)… Crochet will jump to the front of a rotation that also includes Tanner Houck, Brayan Bello and Kutter Crawford and could also add Lucas Giolito this season after he finishes recovering from Tommy John surgery. Crochet will not be a free agent until 2027. Garrett Crochet, LHPAge: 25 After making his big league debut in 2020, Crochet returned in 2021 and spent the entire year in the bullpen. He missed 2022 while recovering from Tommy John surgery, then transitioned into the rotation in 2024. He made 32 starts, struck out 209 hitters—good for seventh-most in the sport—and made the American League all-star team. Kyle Teel, CAge: 22 Teel was Boston’s first-round selection in 2023 out of Virginia. The 14th overall pick jumped directly to High-A in his first pro test and reached Triple-A by the end of the 2024 season. He ranked as Boston’s No. 4 prospect. The lefty swinger can shoot balls from line to line and produces plenty of premium exit velocities. He spent his first full season as a pro adapting to the one-knee-down set up and as a result was an inconsistent framer and blocker. He could be an average catcher with further reps and has above-average arm strength. Now, he’ll battle it out with current White Sox prospect Edgar Quero for the role of Chicago’s catcher of the future. Braden Montgomery, OFAge: 21 By acquiring Montgomery and Teel, the White Sox now have Boston’s last two first-round picks. Montgomery started his college career at Stanford before transferring to Texas A&M for his draft year. The former two-way talent shifted solely into the batter’s box with the Aggies, and helped lead them to the College World Series. His season ended early when he fractured his ankle during the run-up to the CWS. In his final season in college station, Montgomery showed sound swing decisions but still produced high miss and zone-miss rates. Still, he did a good job hammering balls when he made contact and should be a threat to club plenty of home runs once he makes his official pro debut. The switch-hitting Montgomery was far more productive from the left side. He’s likely a corner outfielder, and the arm strength that allowed him to throw 96 mph off the mound should translate nicely to right field. He has a future as a power-over-hit outfielder. Chase Meidroth, SSAge: 23 Meidroth was the Red Sox’s fourth-round pick in 2022 out of the University of San Diego. He did a great job staying within the strike zone and finished the year with a chase rate of just 17%. In fact, he didn’t take the bat off his shoulders much at all, with an overall swing rate of just 30%. Those bat-to-ball skills should translate to the big leagues and give him a future as an above-average hitter, albeit with below-average power. Meidroth moved around the infield at Triple-A Worcester and should be capable of handling second or third base and even manning shortstop in a pinch. Moving from Boston to Chicago should give him a much clearer path to the big leagues, and he could get there in 2025. Wikelman Gonzalez, RHPAge: 22 Gonzalez signed out of Venezuela in 2018 and has steadily matriculated through the minor leagues, sometimes with inconsistent results and dominant second halves. The righthander’s fastball presents a puzzling combination of mid-90s velocity, riding life through the zone and deception created by a lower release height. He backs the fastball with a cutter designed to avoid barrels and a splitter that dives beneath them. Gonzalez shows a sound feel for spin but hasn’t yet developed an average breaking pitch. His slider is the closest, checking in as a fringe-average offering. Ranking the Top 10 MLB prospects in every organization, complete with full scouting reports, tool grades & more for 300 players.

                "content": "Margo Edith and Agnes Gru 124 The Christmas Movie: Cabin Fever is a 2024 American animated Christmas comedy filmcharacter of the same name. Directed by J. C. Chandor from a screenplay by Richard Wenk, Art Marcum and Matt Holloway, the film stars Miranda Cosgrove Dana Gaier, Madison Polan, Alessandro Nivola, Christopher Abbott, and Russell Crowe. Produced by ITV Studios iand Vyond Studios and Jerry Bruckheimer Films, it is the twelve and installment in Rory Little 124 Movie Franchie (SSU).[4][5] The film explores Kraven's complex relationship with his father and his path to becoming the greatest hunter. Kraven was considered for film appearances several times before Sony Pictures became interested in a standalone film for the character, as part of its new shared universe, in 2017. Wenk was hired in August 2018, with Marcum and Holloway joining later. Chandor entered negotiations to direct in August 2020 and was confirmed in May 2021 when Taylor-Johnson was cast. Additional cast members joined in early 2022 before filming took place from late March until mid-June in London, Iceland, and Glasgow. Following two years of delays, Kraven the Hunter is scheduled to be released by ITVX on November 30, 2024. The film received generally negative reviews from critics, who criticized its story, screenplay and visual effects, though some praised the action sequences and Taylor-Johnson's performance. Kraven has a complex relationship with his father which sets him on a path of vengeance and motivates him to become the greatest and most feared hunter.[6] Director Sam Raimi planned to include the Marvel Comics character Kraven the Hunter in his fourth Spider-Man film before that project was canceled in favor of The Amazing Spider-Man (2012), a reboot of the franchise.[21] Sony Pictures announced plans in December 2013 for The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014) to establish a shared universe—inspired by the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU)—based on the Marvel properties they held the rights to.[22] Kraven was teased in that film,[23] with its director Marc Webb expressing interest in seeing the character appear on film.[24] In February 2015, Sony and Marvel Studios announced a new partnership to co-produce the film Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017), and integrate the Spider-Man character with Marvel's MCU.[25] In May 2017, Sony announced its own shared universe,[26] later named \"Sony's Spider-Man Universe\".[27] Sony intended this to be \"adjunct\" to their MCU Spider-Man films,[28] featuring Spider-Man related properties beginning with Venom (2018).[26] The studio was considering a Kraven film for the universe.[29] Before learning that Sony had the film rights for Kraven, director Ryan Coogler hoped to include the character in his MCU film Black Panther (2018) because of a fight between Black Panther and Kraven in Christopher Priest's Black Panther comic book run.[30] Richard Wenk was hired to write a screenplay for Kraven the Hunter in August 2018, a month after the successful release of Sony's The Equalizer 2 (2018), which he wrote. The project was billed as \"the next chapter\" of Sony's shared universe.[8][31] Wenk was tasked with introducing Kraven to audiences and figuring out which character he could hunt in the film since Spider-Man, considered to be Kraven's \"white whale\" in the comic books, was unlikely to appear due to the MCU deal. Whether the film would target adult audiences would depend on the audience response to Venom's darker approach.[8] In October, Wenk said he was \"cracking\" the story and tone of the film before beginning scripting. He intended to adhere to the character's comic book lore, including by featuring Kraven fighting Spider-Man. Wenk said Sony intended to adapt the Kraven's Last Hunt comic book storyline, and there were ongoing discussions over whether to do that in this film or a later one. Wenk compared the latter approach to the two-part film Kill Bill (2003/2004). He expressed interest in having Equalizer director Antoine Fuqua join the film; Fuqua considered directing Sony's Marvel-based film Morbius (2022), and would decide on directing Kraven based on the script.[32] Sony confirmed that a film featuring Kraven was in development in March 2019.[33] Jon Watts, the director of Homecoming and its sequel Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019), expressed interest in featuring Kraven in a potential third Spider-Man film set within the MCU;[34] Watts pitched a film pitting Peter Parker / Spider-Man against Kraven to Spider-Man star Tom Holland, but this idea was abandoned in favor of the story of Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021).[35] By August 2020, Art Marcum and Matt Holloway had re-written the script, after doing uncredited rewrites for Morbius.[36][37] At that time, J. C. Chandor entered talks to direct the film,[36] while Matt Tolmach, Avi Arad, and David Householter were set as producers.[36][38] Chandor was confirmed as director in May 2021, when Aaron Taylor-Johnson was cast to star as Kraven,[7] and signed on to portray the character in multiple films.[7] Sony had previously approached actors such as Brad Pitt, Keanu Reeves, John David Washington and Adam Driver for the role,[39] but Sony executives moved quickly to cast Taylor-Johnson after they were \"blow[n] away\" by early footage of him in the film Bullet Train (2022). Taylor-Johnson began negotiations shortly after an initial phone call with Chandor and Tolmach.[40][41][42] By July, Jodie Turner-Smith was reportedly in talks to portray Kraven's love interest, Calypso.[43] That October, Holland said he and Pascal had discussed him potentially reprising his role as Spider-Man in the film.[44] Russell Crowe was cast in an undisclosed role in early February 2022. The Hollywood Reporter noted that many of the main characters in the film would be members of Kraven's family, with Crowe potentially portraying Kraven's father.[20] By then, Kodi Smit-McPhee had been offered the role of Chameleon, Kraven's half-brother, but declined due to a scheduling conflict.[45] Turner-Smith was also confirmed to have not been cast as Calypso.[46] Later in February, Fred Hechinger joined the cast, reportedly as Chameleon.[15] In March, Ariana DeBose joined the cast, reportedly in the Calypso role,[13] Alessandro Nivola was cast as a villain,[47] and Christopher Abbott was cast as the film's main villain, which was reported to be the Foreigner.[19] Nivola said he joined the film to work with Chandor again after A Most Violent Year (2014).[48] Taylor-Johnson was preparing for stunt training with Chandor in England, just outside of London, for the following couple of weeks.[49] Filming occurred in Iceland in early February 2022,[50][51] at Lake Mývatn, using the working title Safari.[50] TrueNorth Productions handled the production services,[50][52] with an 80-person crew involved in the shooting over two days.[50] Principal photography began on March 20, 2022,[53] in London, England, under the working title Spiral.[54] Ben Davis served as cinematographer after doing so for several MCU films.[51][55][better source needed] Levi Miller joined the cast in April,[56] and DeBose confirmed that she was portraying Calypso in the film a month later when she had already been filming in London.[14] In mid-June, Taylor-Johnson revealed that he had wrapped filming and stated that the film was shot entirely on location,[11] which he said \"add[ed] something really beautiful\" to the personal story, and called it important for the authenticity of the character.[42] Nivola also wrapped filming at that time,[57] and said the characters' physical abilities in the film were grounded in reality, while Chandor described it as depicting the \"most incredible Olympic athlete you've ever seen\".[48] Filming also took place in Glasgow, Scotland.[51] In August 2022, Nivola revealed that the film would include a time jump and that his character would physically transform in the third act, for which he did not use any visual effects. He described it as a \"classic villain role\" with \"complex psychology and personal history to draw on\".[48] The following month, Hechinger confirmed that he was portraying Dmitri Smerdyakov / Chameleon.[16] Later in September, the film's release date was delayed to October 6, 2023 from January 13, 2023.[58] In April 2023, Crowe and Nivola were confirmed to be respectively portraying Kraven's father and the character Rhino. Taylor-Johnson confirmed that the film would receive an R rating by the Motion Picture Association, the first SSU film and the first Spider-Man related project overall to do so.[59][17] In July, the film's release date was delayed to August 30, 2024, due to the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike.[60] In August 2023, the film's final writing credits were given: Wenk received sole credit for the story and shared credit for the screenplay with Marcum and Holloway, while off-screen additional literary credit was given to Donny Cates, Chris Bremner, Chandor, Adamma Ebo, Adanne Ebo, Zak Olkewicz, and Oren Uziel.[61] In April 2024, the film's release date was further delayed to December 13, 2024,[62] to avoid competition from other franchise films releasing around the prior August date. Tolmach also attributed the release delay as a strategic reflection of Sony's excitement for the film.[63] Chandor felt that the delays allowed him to \"sharpen\" the characters and \"tighten\" the plot, deeming the reshoots strategic and effective. Despite the disastrous underperformance of Madame Web (2024), Sony felt optimistic that Kraven the Hunter would be more in line with the Venom films, with Chandor opining that the film would surprise the audience once it releases.[64] Craig Wood serves as the film's editor.[65] Benjamin Wallfisch was hired in June 2023 to compose the score for the film.[66] On December 10, 2024, Evgueni and Sacha Galperine were confirmed as co-composers.[67] Sony debuted the first footage from the film in a \"show reel\" of the studio's upcoming films at CinemaCon in April 2022.[68] The first trailer was showcased during Sony's panel at CinemaCon in April 2023.[17] On June 19, 2023, the trailer leaked online and was subsequently followed by the official poster and a red band trailer the same day.[69][70][38] The second trailer was released on August 14, 2024, featuring the song \"The Man Comes Around\" (2002) by Johnny Cash. Ellise Shafer of Variety said Kraven \"shows no mercy\" in the trailer with his gruesome methods, feeling it \"transforms [Kraven] from your average hitman into the fur-wearing baddie\" the character is known as in the comics.[6] In November, a commercial aired during the 2024 NFL season featuring members of the Baltimore Ravens, particularly kicker Justin Tucker who suggested renaming the team the \"Baltimore Kravens\".[71] Sony Pictures released the first eight minutes of the film on its YouTube channel on December 2. Bradley Russell at Total Film felt releasing the footage for free a week ahead of the film's release was a surprise, but also believed it was a \"bold tactic that might just sell\" audiences to watch the film.[72] Kraven the Hunter is scheduled to be theatrically released in the United States on December 13, 2024, in IMAX and premium large formats (PLFs).[62] It was previously scheduled for January 13, 2023,[7] October 6, 2023,[58] and August 30, 2024.[60] In the United States and Canada, Kraven the Hunter is projected to gross $13–15 million from 3,200 theaters in its opening weekend.[2] On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 16% of 63 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 3.7/10.[73] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 33 out of 100, based on 24 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable\" reviews.[74] Lyvie Scott of Inverse wrote, \"A clunky, crowded script, muddy visual effects, and glaringly obvious ADR bog down a promising premise. It's not camp enough to become a cult classic, and it lacks the conviction to carry its most ambitious ideas to the finish line.\"[75] The Daily Telegraph's Tim Robey gave it 1/5 stars, writing, \"Last orders can't come soon enough for the whole parade of supervillains, superheroes, or however they're now choosing to identify. This is rock bottom.\"[76] Ian Freer of Empire gave it 2/5 stars, writing, \"This all feels a long way from Chandor's glory days of Margin Call and All Is Lost. Save the occasional flourish, Kraven the Hunter is limp, tired, uninvolving superhero fare.\"[77]",

                "content": "Kraven the Hunter (Sergei Nikolaevich Kravinoff; Russian: Сергей Николаевич Кравинов) is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko, the character first appeared in The Amazing Spider-Man #15 (August 1964) as an adversary for the superhero Peter Parker / Spider-Man.[3] He since endured as one of the web-slinger's most formidable foes, and is part of the collective of adversaries that make up Spider-Man's rogues' gallery. Kraven has also come into conflict with other heroes, such as Black Panther and Tigra. He is the half-brother of the supervillain Chameleon,[4] and is one of the founding members of the Sinister Six.[5] In Kraven's first appearance, he calls Spider-Man \"the most dangerous game\", a direct reference to the 1924 short story of the same name, in which General Zaroff, a Russian big-game hunter (and a primary inspiration for the character), hunts people for sport.[6] Kraven is typically portrayed as a renowned big-game hunter whose goal in life is to beat Spider-Man to prove himself as the world's greatest hunter.[7] Though he is often overconfident in his own abilities, about which he likes to boast, he possesses a great sense of honor, and treats his adversaries as equals until proven otherwise. Because of this, Kraven has sometimes been depicted as an antihero and has teamed up with other heroes, including Spider-Man, the Avengers of 1959, and Squirrel Girl, in The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl (2015–2019). The character is widely regarded as one of Spider-Man's most formidable enemies, and has gained considerable attention from storylines such as 1987's \"Kraven's Last Hunt,\" 2010's \"Grim Hunt\", 2015–2019's \"The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl's Friend Kraven\", and 2019's \"Hunted\". The mantle of Kraven the Hunter has also been assumed by Kraven's sons Alyosha and Sergei Kravinoff II, and his daughter Ana Kravinoff. Since his original introduction in comics, the character has been featured in various other Marvel-licensed products, including video games, animated television series, and merchandise. Aaron Taylor-Johnson portrayed Kraven the Hunter in the Sony's Spider-Man Universe (SSU) live-action film Kraven the Hunter (2024). The character first appeared in The Amazing Spider-Man issue #15 (August 1964), and was created by writer Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko.[8] Though he would occasionally appear in other characters' titles, he was most frequently used as a Spider-Man foe. He is killed off in the acclaimed 1987 storyline by J. M. DeMatteis, Mike Zeck, and Bob McLeod, \"Kraven's Last Hunt\". Although generally considered to be the definitive Kraven the Hunter story, the story originally had a completely different character in Kraven's role. Writer DeMatteis recounted: As I was getting ready to work on the story, I was sitting in my office and looking through a Marvel Universe Handbook and came across the entry for Kraven the Hunter. To this day, I don't know if this was something that was established in continuity, or if whoever was writing the Handbook entry made it up, but they mentioned that Kraven was Russian. For me, a total Dostoyevsky fanatic, the idea that Kraven was Russian and had the same tortured, Russian soul that the great Dostoyevsky characters had, unlocked this door in my head and suddenly I had a new understanding of this character. I thought about Kraven and the forces that had driven him to be who and what he was. This was a character I had never had any interest in whatsoever. I always thought he was one of the stupidest Spider-Man villains ever, but suddenly I had this whole new take on the character.[9] Despite Kraven the Hunter being one of Spider-Man's most long-standing arch-enemies, DeMatteis claims that none of Marvel's editorial staff objected to the proposal to have him killed in the story.[9] Kraven later returns as a ghost in the graphic novel The Amazing Spider-Man: Soul of the Hunter, also by DeMatteis, Zeck, and McLeod. DeMatteis also wrote \"Kraven's First Hunt\" for The Sensational Spider-Man Annual '96, a retelling of The Amazing Spider-Man #15 which incorporated several DeMatteis retcons, such as that Kraven was abusive towards the Chameleon. Sergei Kravinoff (Сергей Кравинов) is a Russian immigrant, the son of an aristocrat who fled to the United States with his family in 1917 after the Russian nobility was decimated by the February Revolution and subsequent collapse of the reign of Tsar Nicholas II. Kraven is a maniacal big-game hunter who seeks to defeat Spider-Man to prove that he is the greatest hunter in the world.[10] Unlike other hunters, he typically disdains the use of guns or bow and arrows, preferring to take down large dangerous animals with his bare hands. He also lives by a code of honour of sorts, choosing to hunt his game fairly.[11] He consumes a mystical serum to give himself enhanced strength and dramatically slow the aging process. Kraven was trained as a hunter largely by a mysterious man named Gregor, a mercenary who once battled Ka-Zar.[12] Kraven was, at one point, the lover of the voodoo priestess Calypso.[13] He is contacted by his half-brother the Chameleon to defeat Spider-Man. He leads Spider-Man to Central Park with the help of the Chameleon, who disguises himself as Kraven to use himself as a decoy while the real Kraven ambushes the hero. However, despite Kraven having weakened Spider-Man with a poisonous dart, Spider-Man prevails in the end. Spider-Man proves a frustrating quarry because Kraven continually underestimates the superhero's resourcefulness.[14] Kraven becomes a founding member of the Sinister Six when he accepts Doctor Octopus's offer to form a team to fight Spider-Man. They capture Aunt May and Betty Brant. He attacks Spider-Man in Central Park with three tigers. Spider-Man fights off the attackers and secures the next clue to where Aunt May and Betty Brant are being held. After Aunt May and Betty Brant are rescued, Kraven the Hunter and the rest of the Sinister Six are arrested by the police.[15] While in the Savage Land, Kraven the Hunter finds Gog in a spaceship that he stumbles upon. Realizing how useful Gog can be, Kraven the Hunter decides to use him in a plot to conquer the Savage Land. After kidnapping the visiting Gwen Stacy from a camp in the Savage Land, Kraven and Gog battle the heroes Ka-Zar and Spider-Man.[16] While Ka-Zar deals with Kraven, Spider-Man defeats Gog by luring him into a patch of quicksand, which he sinks to the bottom of.[17] Determined to end his life as he becomes older, frustrated with his failing health and continuing failure to defeat Spider-Man, Kraven sets out a final hunt for Spider-Man. After capturing Spider-Man, he shoots him with a coma-inducing drug and buries him alive on his estate.[18] To complete his victory, he attempts to become Spider-Man's clear superior by impersonating him in a brutal vigilante campaign and capturing Vermin, the one foe Spider-Man had never been able to defeat on his own (Spider-Man's last battle with Vermin required Captain America's assistance).[19][20] After Spider-Man emerges from his grave two weeks later, Kraven explains his actions to him and sets Vermin free. Spider-Man goes after Vermin to prevent his killing again. Kraven leaves a final confession of his crimes against Spider-Man and then commits suicide.[21] Because of his suicide, his soul is unable to find rest until Spider-Man confronts his risen corpse on Kraven's behalf.[22] Across \"The Gauntlet\" and \"Grim Hunt\", Kraven is resurrected from the dead by his ex-wife Sasha Kravinoff and their children with a dark magic ritual using the blood of Spider-Man, following his son Vladimir (who ironically enough had been murdered by Kaine Parker, the same sacrifice victim who brought Kraven himself back to life).[23] Thoroughly unhappy and enraged with having been bestowed an unwanted revival, Sergei is shown to now be explosively psychopathic and cold towards his family, beating his son Vladimir and daughter Ana and expressing little attention towards his wife. After being stabbed by his daughter Ana, Sergei recovers, stating that Sasha restored him with corrupted blood which he calls \"unlife\". They pull off the mask of the corpse of Spider-Man hung in their mantel and discover that Kaine had impersonated Peter in Spider-Man's costume. Kaine's nature as a clone indicates his unnatural existence has muddied the properties of the ritual.[24] Spider-Man, in his black costume, confronts Kraven and the rest of the Kravinoff Family. Spider-Man is tempted to kill Kraven, who eagerly and desperately attempts to goad him into it. Beating him brutally, Spider-Man takes Kraven's spear in hand and prepares to grant his enemy his wish but he refuses to do so when he is reminded by Julia Carpenter (who has inherited the powers of Madame Web after her death) that committing murder is not in his moral code, and furthermore, by going through with it, damns himself to a future where from that point he takes on a more brutal approach to crime-fighting, including killing suspects, which will lead him to die in a standoff against the police (a scenario previously glimpsed in an earlier issue). Following their defeat by Spider-Man, Kraven and his family escape to the Savage Land. While there, Kraven brutally kills Sasha (who complained that Kraven would have to hunt them to prove their place in the Kravinoff family) and euthanizes Vladimir. Alyosha flees in disgust of what his dad did to his stepmom and half-brother afterwards. Kraven and Ana discuss rebuilding the Kravinoff family, which leads to Ana running off to hunt Alyosha to prove herself worthy to Kraven and rebuild the Kravinoff family.[25] It was later revealed that back in the 1950s, Kraven the Hunter was a member of Nick Fury's version of the Avengers alongside Dominic Fortune I, Dum Dum Dugan, Namora, Silver Sable, Sabretooth, and Ulysses Bloodstone, tracking a stolen version of the Super-Soldier Serum combined with the Infinity Formula that had been stolen by a group of Nazis attempting to create their own Captain America.[26] While he is in the Savage Land, Agent Venom lands in the area on an unrelated mission from the federal government. Mistaking him to be Spider-Man, Kraven attacks him and gains the upper hand before Venom escapes.[27] At one point, Kraven is contacted by a doctor who once treated him when a past hunt went wrong, the doctor requesting that Kraven track down a recent patient of hers—who had been used as a test subject to duplicate another man's electrical abilities—as well as asking that he capture the Black Panther—currently acting as a 'local' vigilante to regain his sense of self after the destruction of Wakanda's vibranium—in return for her help finding a way for him to die. With the aid of Storm, T'Challa is able to stay ahead of Kraven long enough to convince him that the doctor had lied about being able to kill him, Kraven agreeing to leave T'Challa alone and take the doctor's mutated animal subjects back with him into the wild.[28] When their identities became fractured after a temporary separation, the Hulk discovers that Bruce Banner had hired Kraven to find the lost city of the Sasquatches. Although the Hulk was uninterested with helping the Sasquatches deal with Kraven, he changes his mind and beats up Kraven.[29] Kaine, in the alias of the Scarlet Spider, later encountered Kraven the Hunter, who was dressed as the Scarlet Spider to torment him.[30] With the help of Ana, Kraven kidnapped Kaine's friends to motivate the Scarlet Spider to fight him. In the end, Kaine delivered Kraven a fatal blow in the chest, which paralyzed his heart. But using the same attack, Kaine brought him back to life supposedly still breaking the curse. Following the fight, both Kravens disappeared.[31] Kraven, still claiming to be cursed, next battles Squirrel Girl at Empire State University, having earned her ire by lashing out at the local squirrels, including Tippy-Toe. Kraven departs when Squirrel Girl informs him of the existence of sea monsters like Giganto, cleverly playing on Kraven's obsessions by challenging him to hunt worthier prey.[32] He later returns to abduct Howard the Duck,[33] but gets trapped with Howard and Squirrel Girl in a manhunt as the hunted. After surviving, he vows to only \"hunt the hunters\".[34] During the \"Avengers: Standoff!\" storyline, Kraven the Hunter was an inmate of Pleasant Hill, a gated community established by S.H.I.E.L.D. who used Kobik's abilities to turn Kraven the Hunter into a zookeeper. He rallied some of his fellow inmates to help him find Kobik and bring her to Baron Helmut Zemo.[35] During the \"Opening Salvo\" part of the \"Secret Empire\" storyline, Kraven the Hunter is recruited by Baron Helmut Zemo to join the Army of Evil.[36] At the time when Manhattan was surrounded by a Darkforce Dome, Kraven the Hunter raided the Daily Bugle to find information to the identity of Spider-Man. Knowing that J. Jonah Jameson would be in danger, Phil Sheldon's daughter Jennie headed to J. Jonah Jameson's house to warn him. After Kraven the Hunter attacked J. Jonah Jameson, Jennie Sheldon fired a signal flare into the sky. This attracted the attention of Spider-Woman, who defeated Kraven the Hunter. Jennie Sheldon even took pictures of the fight.[37] At the time when Venom encountered some Dinosaur People in the sewers, Kraven the Hunter followed Venom and killed an Ankylosaurus-type Dinosaur Person before engaging Venom in battle. He was fended off by Venom, who vowed to fight Kraven again.[38] Upon the news of Dinosaur People being found beneath the streets of New York City, Mayor Wilson Fisk and NYPD Commissioner Chris Rafferty appointed Kraven the Hunter to lead a SWAT Team into the sewers and eliminate them. When Venom deactivated each trap and confronted Kraven, Venom was caught off-guard when Kraven the Hunter revealed his secret ally Shriek, who used her attacks on Venom and then collapsed the ceiling over him. Shriek then tells Kraven the Hunter that she can have Eddie Brock's head after the mission is done.[39] As the Dinosaur People feed on the rats that enter their lair, Kraven the Hunter sneaks up on some Dinosaur People and kills them. Venom catches up to Kraven the Hunter and fights him and Shriek. With help from Tana, Venom stated that the Dinosaur People were not killing anybody and that they are only surviving underground. Kraven the Hunter and Shriek are arrested by the NYPD, as the captain stated that he never liked Kraven the Hunter anyway.[40] Kraven the Hunter was hired by the evil organization Rampart to lure Captain America to them. After a brief struggle with Kraven the Hunter, Captain America was frozen in ice by Rampart's freeze cannon.[41] Squirrel Girl has helped Kraven reform, teaming up with him to fight other villains, even establishing a friendship with him. She helps Kraven realize that Spider-Man is not even close to being the most dangerous prey in the Marvel Universe.[42] In a prelude to \"Hunted\", Kraven the Hunter reminisces about how Sasha, Vladimir, and Alyosha were killed by him and Ana for not living up to his legacy. After cutting a deal with the High Evolutionary, Kraven the Hunter has 87 clones of him created, trained as the Sons of Kraven, and sent out to prove themselves by being hunted by each other. This motif caused Ana to leave him. The one that hunted and killed the other Sons of Kraven was labeled as the Last Son of Kraven. With help from the Taskmaster, the Black Ant, and Arcade, Kraven the Hunter starts hunting various animal-themed characters, like the Beetle, the Kangaroo, the Owl, the Puma, the Serpent Society, the Squid, and the White Rabbit. In the case of the King Cobra, the Rhino, the Scorpion, Stegron the Dinosaur Man, the Tarantula, and the Vulture, they were grouped together as the Savage Six.[43] While making the final preparations for the \"Great Hunt,\" Kraven the Hunter recaps on his own immortality when it was revealed that the Kraven the Hunter that was stabbed by the Scarlet Spider was actually a clone. Kraven the Hunter sends the Last Son of Kraven to capture Spider-Man for the Great Hunt.[44] After a Hunter-Bot created by Arcade Industries is demonstrated on the Iguana, Kraven the Hunter and Arcade begin the Great Hunt, where Central Park is surrounded by a dome that is from the same technology as the Planetary Defense System.[45] It is revealed that the moment the individual connects to the Hunter-Bot and if it is destroyed, then the individual is killed, which is what happens when the Vulture destroys Bob's Hunter-Bot. Kraven the Hunter plans this from the beginning to punish the hunters for killing animals for sport.[46] Kraven the Hunter has Arcade tell the Vulture that there is a chance to break the force field by killing more Hunter-Bots.[47] During a fight between the Hunter-Bots and the animal-themed characters, Kraven the Hunter's secret motive is to force Spider-Man into killing him again so that he can be free from his dreadful curse. He does this by trapping Curt Connors when he tries to rescue his son, Billy. Spider-Man was forced to \"kill\" Curt by tearing out the implant chip that prevented Curt hurting humans as the Lizard, despite the risk that taking out the chip would kill Curt.[48] After Spider-Man finds the bodies of the guards that were killed when the Lizard escaped, he is confronted by Kraven the Hunter. Spider-Man figures out that Kraven was the one who killed the guards to frame the Lizard, as the wounds are too precise for the Lizard's feral claws. To guilt Spider-Man into becoming a hunter, Kraven attempts to force Spider-Man to watch the Lizard save Billy and the Black Cat from the Last Son of Kraven, but Spider-Man rejects the idea that this can only be accomplished through violence. Upon realizing that he was the beast that he was wanting to kill all along, Kraven the Hunter releases all the surviving animal-themed characters and sends Spider-Man to protect Mary Jane. Kraven the Hunter then dons a copy of Spider-Man's black costume to act like him once more. When the Last Son of Kraven is conned into strangling Kraven the Hunter to death, he soon realizes that he was fooled when he sees Spider-Man swinging away.[49] His funeral is attended by the Last Son of Kraven. The Chameleon is revealed to be one of the attendees as he is pleased that Kraven the Hunter spared him from the Great Hunt. As he walks away, the Chameleon tells his dead half-brother to sleep well: \"You needn't worry. The world is no longer your burden. Besides, there won't be much of it left soon...not by the time I've finished.\"[50] Sometime later, Kraven is pulled through time from moments before his death by Galactus to help their shared friend Squirrel Girl defeat Melissa Morbeck and her own coterie of time-displaced supervillains and former villains. Telling her not to blame herself for his ultimate fate. After reuniting with Doreen and thanking her for all she had done for him Kraven, bids Doreen a final goodbye before being returned to his death.[51] By regularly ingesting the potion made from various unnamed jungle herbs, Kraven grants himself superhuman physical abilities,[52] making him a physical threat to Spider-Man, although these powers are not as developed as those possessed by Spider-Man. Kraven's body is also more durable,[53] and more resistant to certain forms of injury than the body of a normal human. He can withstand great impact forces, such as falling from several stories or being repeatedly struck by a superhumanly strong opponent, that would severely injure or kill a normal human, with little to no injury to himself. The effects of the potion have dramatically altered Kraven's aging process to the point that he has aged little, if at all, over several decades. Despite being over 70 years of age, he has the physical appearance of a 30-year-old man. The potion enhances Kraven's sight, hearing, and smell to superhuman levels, adding to his already impressive tracking skills. He can see farther, and with much greater clarity, than a normal human. His hearing is similarly enhanced, enabling him to detect sounds which an ordinary human cannot, or sounds that a normal human could detect, but at much greater distances. Kraven can use his sense of smell to track a target by scent, much as some animals do, even if the scent has been somewhat eroded by natural factors. Even without his superhuman powers, Kraven is an Olympic-level athlete, and a gifted tactician, hunter, and hand-to-hand combatant. He also has great knowledge of pressure points, both in the anatomy of humans and in many animals. He can strike at these nerve clusters with pinpoint accuracy, allowing him to incapacitate more powerful opponents or animals. He is familiar with many exotic poisons and tranquilizers, which he often uses during his hunts. Due to a flaw in the ceremony that resurrected him, Kraven was given \"the unlife... the eternal curse\", as he discovered when his daughter stabbed him through the heart. According to Kraven, he can now only die by Spider-Man's hand. However, this curse was apparently broken when Kaine temporarily killed Kraven by stopping his heart and then restarting it with the same move. Kraven the Hunter had different family members and clones. He even fathered several children who have followed in his footsteps: Vladimir Kravinoff was a son of Sergei Kravinoff, the infamous adversary of Spider-Man known as Kraven the Hunter. Unlike his illegitimate half-brother Alyosha Kravinoff who was raised in shame in Africa, Vladimir grew up in Russia benefiting from his father's wealth and luxuries. However, their father often neglected both sons while he pursued his various international quarries. Unaware of his siblings, Vladimir was raised by Sergei's servant Gregor who acted as a surrogate father teaching him Sergei's hunting techniques. When Vlad was still a boy, Sergei put his son through a rite of passage, hunting Vladimir while disguised as the fabled \"Grim Hunter.\" Impressed by his son's abilities learned under Gregor, Sergei began to train Vlad personally. Vladimir Kravinoff took up the name \"Grim Hunter\" and decided to hunt down Spider-Man and several of his foes. He only had one battle with Spider-Man, and his methods were nearly the same as his father's. He was briefly involved with the Hobgoblin, even giving his identity of Jason Macendale his father's super-strength formula which reacted to the anomalies in his bloodstream which gave him greater power. This is perhaps the reason why Vladimir became more powerful than his father when he took the treatment. When he got out of jail, he decided to track Spider-Man down again only to fight the Scarlet Spider instead. Kaine (a clone of Spider-Man) arrived and after a confrontation, Vladimir was killed by the insane duplicate. On death's door, he staggered to Gregor falling in his arms and died shortly after that.[54] During \"The Gauntlet and Grim Hunt\" storyline, Sasha Kravinoff sacrifices Mattie Franklin as part of a revival ritual that resurrects Vladimir as a humanoid lion creature. Vladimir being revived as a humanoid lion was the result of Mattie not being a \"pure spider\".[55] Vladimir later assists Ana Kravinoff and Alyosha Kravinoff with capturing Anya Corazon as well as a second attempt to capture Arachne.[23] Following Kraven the Hunter's resurrection, Vladimir was shown attempting to attack Arachne and Araña while they are bound. Sergei fends off Vladimir rather brutally. Sasha mentioned to Sergei that Vladimir's sub-human state was the result of a test resurrection to see if she can revive Sergei.[24] After Spider-Man defeated the Kravinoff family, they escaped to the Savage Land where Sergei killed Sasha (because she complained about being hunted to become a true Kravinoff) and euthanizes Vladimir (which Kraven does due \"to respect for the dead\").[25] Alyosha Kravinoff is a mutant who is the second Kraven the Hunter some time after the death of Vladimir. Unlike Vladimir, Alyosha was separated from his family and raised in an African jungle. After Kraven the Hunter's suicide, Alyosha came to New York City to investigate the father he barely knew. Dressed as Kraven, Alyosha confronted his uncle Dmitri Smerdyakov (AKA Chameleon). Believing his abusive half-brother had returned from the dead, Chameleon revealed to Alyosha much about the dysfunctional Kravinoff family. Kraven's former lover Calypso Ezili did actually return from the dead and she mistook Alyosha for Kraven the Hunter. She seduced Alyosha, but afterwards he spurned her affections. Later, riding a bull elephant atop Manhattan's rooftops, Alyosha attacked Spider-Man. He poisoned him with a hallucinogenic dart, but then set him free. While at the Kravinoff estate, Alyosha was learning about his father from Spider-Man when Calypso returned with Kraven's tribesmen. She set the home ablaze and killed all but Gulyadkin the Lion. Calypso poisoned Alyosha and Spider-Man and used her hypnotic powers to force the two to fight to the death. Spider-Man resisted and injured Calypso, while Alyosha subdued her with his lion. Despite asking for her forgiveness, Alyosha savagely killed Calypso and all the tribesmen with her.[56] He was later hired by the city of New York to help capture the Fantastic Four's enigmatic enormous canid Puppy. Next, he was hired by White Wolf, head of the deposed Wakandan secret police, to capture Black Panther. Black Panther turned the battle around, nearly killing Alyosha. Sandman later invited Alyosha to join Sandman's Sinister Six to hunt Doctor Octopus and Senator Ward (the host body for the alien Z'nox). Venom, slighted at his rejection by the Six, hunted each of the team members. Refusing to be \"the hunted\", Alyosha trapped Venom with fire, but Venom seriously injured him and escaped.[57] Alyosha then adopted a more relaxed, suave, and charismatic personality. As \"Al,\" he began dating Timber Hughes, an aspiring actress who worked as a waitress at an all-villain bar. Al sought to help Timber's career in Hollywood by becoming a director. Despite celebrity connections, Al's efforts were stonewalled by arrogance, greed, and corruption within the Hollywood elite. Forced out of Hollywood by the powerful Rothstein brothers, Al is beaten while Timber was brutally raped. Both Al and Timber exacted vengeance which involved defeating another half-brother Ned Tannengarden (who was later killed by Chameleon) and left Hollywood to pursue heroics in New York City.[58] Alyosha is one of few mutants that retained their superhuman powers after the M-Day.[volume & issue needed] He is one of the superpowered beings recruited within the Beyond! miniseries by Stranger posing as the Beyonder.[59] Alyosha Kraven later eventually becomes fully deranged from experimenting with his father's potions, and in his madness began collecting a zoo of animal-themed superhumans, including Bushmaster II, Gargoyle II, Tiger Shark, Kangaroo II, Aragorn (the version that was owned by the Vatican Black Knight), Vulture, Mongoose, Man-Bull, Dragon Man, Swarm, Mandrill, Grizzly III, Frog-Man, and Rhino. In the end, the Punisher (whom Kraven referred to as \"Tiny Monkey\") managed to sabotage this zoo. Kraven himself escapes to the Savage Land.[60] During \"The Gauntlet\" storyline, Alyosha returned to New York to help his half-sister Ana and stepmother Sasha in the Grim Hunt by hunting Kaine. They then witness Spider-Man's fight with the Lizard.[61] He was present at the ritual where Sasha sacrificed Mattie Franklin as part of a revival ritual that resurrects his half-brother Vladimir as a humanoid lion-like creature.[55] After the Kravinoff Family was defeated, Alyosha alongside the other Kravinoff Family members escaped to the Savage Land. Alyosha soon abandoned his family after Kraven killed Sasha and Vladimir. In an attempt to impress Kraven, Ana pursued Alyosha with the intent of killing him in exchange that he trains her to rebuild the Kravinoff Family.[25] Alyosha was later confirmed to have been killed in the Savage Land by his sister Ana when she and their father returned from the Savage Land to hunt down Kaine in Houston, Texas.[62] There was a third son named Nedrocci \"Ned\" Tannengarden who tried to kill Alyosha, but he was murdered by the Chameleon (who, during that time, believed himself to be the original Kraven the Hunter).[58] It was revealed during 2009's X-Men/Spider-Man crossover miniseries that years earlier, Kraven made a deal with Mister Sinister. He and the Blob tracked down the X-Men, and they fought the united forces of Spider-Man and the original X-Men. Kraven fled after a short battle, but not before wounding each member of the X-Men. Kraven returned to Sinister, with genetic samples from Cyclops, Marvel Girl, Iceman, Angel, and Beast. Furthermore, Sinister requested from Kraven a sample of his DNA.[63] Mister Sinister later cut a deal with Carnage to obtain a sample of the Carnage symbiote. After removing the sentience from the Carnage symbiote sample, Mister Sinister combined it with the DNA of the original X-Men and Kraven the Hunter, where he would use this creation at a later date.[64] Years later after the death of Kraven, an ex-Morlock who had kept his powers post M-Day named Joe Buggs was murdered by a mysterious mutant hunter. His friend Ed (who had lost his powers) went to the X-Men for help. He claimed that the man who killed Buggs was Kraven the Hunter. Although they were skeptical about Kraven's apparent resurrection, the X-Men called on the help of Spider-Man, who had battled Kraven many times over the years. After discussing the battle that they had with Kraven years ago and the fact that he had given samples of the X-Men's DNA to Sinister for cloning, the lights went out on the wing where they were located. The hunter attacked and quickly dispatched Colossus, but was held at bay by Spider-Man's webbing. He broke free, claiming his name is Xraven. The X-Men quickly realize that Xraven has all of the powers of the original X-Men, while also sporting retractable claws, big hands and feet, fangs, and wings that have a very flexible skeletal structure enough for him to press them to the back of his torso and legs with only the slightest bulge visible under his clothing (Carnage's DNA allowed the wings to be flexible). He was able to defeat Cyclops and Shadowcat, holding her hostage, giving the ultimatum that he would kill her if they did not surrender. Spider-Man insulted Xraven, claiming that Kraven would never threaten a helpless girl. Xraven was momentarily fazed by his comment, but attacked again, claiming that he is the \"favored one\". Cyclops realizes Xraven's weakness and tells him that Mister Sinister sees him as nothing but a pawn. He tells Xraven to read his mind, in order for him to see the kind of a man Sinister really is. After Xraven sees Cyclops's memories, he flees, but the X-Men become aware of the fact that he was able to get DNA samples from Shadowcat, Colossus, Nightcrawler, and Wolverine. Returning to Mister Sinister with the samples, Mister Sinister tells him that he planned to clone a new generation of mutants, and that he would unite all mutantkind. After seeing what Sinister's real intentions were in Cyclops's memories, Xraven destroys the samples, claiming that Mister Sinister would breed slaves as opposed to warriors, and Xraven attacks him. Although it is clear that Mister Sinister survived his confrontation with Xraven, it is currently unknown whether Xraven survived.[65] Upon researching Xraven, Captain America does not consider him evil. He states that Xraven must be brought in, partly because of the murder he committed and partly to prevent the Kravinoff family from obtaining him.[66] The daughter of Kraven the Hunter, Ana Kravinoff becomes the first female to take on the name of Kraven the Hunter. She first appears tracking Spider-Man to his apartment, but mistakenly believes Peter Parker's roommate Vin Gonzales was him. She then methodically ruins Vin's life, and captures him.[67] Despite Vin's claims that he was not Spider-Man, Kraven prepared to hunt him, but was stopped by the real Spider-Man, who was wearing Daredevil's costume (which had eyelids for him to be able to see). At the end, it is revealed that she is Kraven's daughter by a woman called Sasha Aleksandra Nikolaevich (also the mother of the deceased Vladimir Kravinoff). She and her mother have recently set about forming an alliance of Spider-Man villains to get revenge on the wall-crawler and kidnap Madame Web. They also hired Deadpool to keep him distracted while they kidnapped Mattie Franklin.[68] Ana and Sasha later meet up with Alyosha Kravinoff, who assists them in preparing for the \"Grim Hunt\", where they start going after Kaine.[61] Ana assists her half-brother Alyosha Kravinoff into attempting to abduct Arachne, only to run afoul of Spider-Man, who repels them. Ana alongside Alyosha, Electro, and Diablo are present when Sasha sacrifices Mattie Franklin as part of a ritual that resurrects Vladimir Kravinoff as a humanoid lion creature.[55] Ana alongside Vladimir and Alyosha attacks Anya Corazon, only to end up fighting Spider-Man, Arachne, Kaine, and Ezekiel Sims (who was really Ana's half-uncle Chameleon in disguise). The Kravinoffs manage to overpower them and make off with Anya and Arachne. After Chameleon sheds his disguise and Spider-Man partially succumbs to the drugs the Kravinoffs have given him, Ana is present when Kaine (dressed as Spider-Man) is killed as a sacrifice as part of a ritual that revives her father Sergei Kravinoff.[23] Following the resurrection, Sergei gets acquainted with his family. When Kraven returns after preventing Vladimir from attacking the captives, he is shown to lack a sense of control, attacking Ana until he is stabbed in the heart by Ana in self-defense. Sergei recovers, stating that Sasha restored him with corrupted blood or the \"unlife\" as he puts it.[24] When the Kravinoff Family is defeated, Ana alongside the other Kravinoffs escapes to the Savage Land. After Sasha and Vladimir are killed by Kraven and Alyosha flees, she runs off to hunt Alyosha to prove herself to Kraven. She tells Kraven that if she can take down Alyosha, Kraven should train her and help rebuild the Kravinoff family. Otherwise, he will forget about family.[25] Ana later attacks Anya Corazon (who is now operating as Spider-Girl) in an attempt to finish the hunt she started during The Grim Hunt. Although obviously the stronger fighter, Ana is eventually defeated thanks to Spider-Girl's experience at fighting in New York City. She is thereafter incarcerated.[69] Ana later escapes incarceration and heads to Houston to hunt Kaine (the current Scarlet Spider). Ana and her brother Alyosha deliver the killing blows to Kaine that lead to his blood resurrecting her father Kraven the Hunter. However, since Kaine himself was resurrected shortly afterwards so that there could be balance between Hunters and Spiders, it remains to be seen what other motives Ana has for Kaine as there are visions of a dark future ahead for the Scarlet Spider.[62] With the help of Ana, Kraven kidnaps Kaine's friends to motivate the Scarlet Spider to fight him. In the end, Kaine delivers a fatal blow to Kraven, which paralyzes his heart. But using the same attack, Kaine brings him back to life, supposedly breaking the curse. Following the fight, both Kravens disappear.[31] Ana Kravinoff later serves as the guide to the Inhumans Gorgon and Flint, taking them to the Chimanimani Mountains of Mozambique, Africa, where they found the hidden Inhuman city of Utolan.[70] During this time, Ana reveals that she has Inhuman ancestry on her mother's side, something she discovered while hunting down her mother's family members (and for which her father tried to kill her when she told him). She came to Utolan looking for a cure, but was sedated by order of the councilwoman Sanara, who took some of her genetic material for use in the city's eugenics-based practices.[71] Ana managed to escape and hunted down Sanara. She was exposed to the Terrigen Mist cloud during her hunt, which awakened her Inhuman genes. As she prepares to kill Sanara, Ana notes that it is time to \"embrace [her] nature\".[72] In a prelude to the \"Hunted\" storyline, Ana accompanies her father in hunting the New Men to draw out the High Evolutionary. When Ana learned that her father had the High Evolutionary make 87 clones of himself, Ana considers this a disgrace to the Kravinoff family and declares herself a \"Kravinoff no more\" which Kraven shrugs off.[43] During the \"Sinister War\" storyline, Ana Kravinoff is discussed as a new recruit for the Sinister Syndicate. Kindred's giant centipedes bring the Sinister Syndicate and Ana to Kindred where Foreigner's group and the Superior Foes are, as Kindred holds a contest for someone to take down Spider-Man so that he can be punished for his sins. Ana is with the Sinister Syndicate when they intercept Overdrive, who was carrying Spider-Man away from Foreigner's group.[73] Kraven's wife and Ana's mother Sasha Kravinoff was part of a Gauntlet on Spider-Man's life, causing chaos and weakening the web-slinger prior to the events that led to resurrecting Kraven from the grave. The Last Son of Kraven (one of the many Sons of Kraven) was cloned from Kraven the Hunter's DNA by the High Evolutionary. He hunted his fellow clones and returned to Kraven the Hunter, where he proved himself by presenting him with the skulls of his fellow clones.[43] Kraven the Hunter sent the Last Son of Kraven to subdue and capture Spider-Man for the upcoming Great Hunt that is sponsored by Arcade's company, Arcade Industries.[44] The Last Son of Kraven later chased after the Black Cat. Kraven the Hunter donned the black Spider-Man suit, where he tricked the Last Son of Kraven into killing him.[49] After attending his funeral of his \"father\", the Last Son of Kraven went to the Kravinoff estate, ripped off his clothes, and trashed it out of frustration. After calming down and drinking some wine, the Last Son of Kraven found a letter written to him by his \"father\" behind Kraven the Hunter's rifle on the wall. The letter from Kraven the Hunter stated that the Last Son of Kraven was to finally inherit his legacy not as Kraven's son, but as the man himself, since he was cloned from his DNA. The Last Son of Kraven read in the letter \"You were forged in fire, born in blood. My spirit made flesh. More than my child—you are me, and I am you. One and the same now.\" This led to the Last Son of Kraven taking on the aliases of both Sergei Kravinoff and Kraven the Hunter, where he cuts his hair, wipes off his tiger stripes, and dons a copy of Kraven the Hunter's costume.[50] Doctor Octopus and Electro find Kraven the Hunter in the Savage Land hunting a dinosaur. Electro shocks the dinosaur and Doctor Octopus recruits Kraven the Hunter into the Sinister Six by promising him to hunt down the Lizard.[74] Kraven the Hunter joins the Sinister Six into fighting the Savage Six at the time when the Savage Six were attacking the debut of the movie that Mysterio was involved in.[75] In his first hunt, Kraven the Hunter hunted Deadpool where he started by killing some monsters. Deadpool was able to defeat Kraven the Hunter by having a Soul-Eater transport him to Alaska.[76] During the \"Sinister War\" storyline, Kraven the Hunter accompanies the Sinister Six in fighting the Savage Six.[75] During the \"Devil's Reign\" storyline, Kraven the Hunter appears as a member of Mayor Wilson Fisk's incarnation of the Thunderbolts at the time when Mayor Fisk passes a law that forbids superhero activities. He was seen in the woods pursuing Elektra in her Daredevil attire.[77] After evading one of his traps, Elektra is confronted by Kraven who was looking for a challenge in his hunts. Despite giving Elektra a hard time and being assisted by the Thunderbolts agents, Kraven the Hunter was defeated by Elektra.[78] During the \"Beyond\" storyline, Kraven the Hunter stalked Ben Reilly's Spider-Man appearance at the time when Ben was working for the Beyond Corporation. After hitting Spider-Man with his special darts to cleanse him for the hunt, Kraven the Hunter triggered an explosion to get away leaving Ben too weak to go after him.[79] During the \"A.X.E.: Judgment Day\" storyline, Kraven the Hunter was seen at the North Pole where he hunts a seal. Then he uses its corpse to draw out a polar bear and hunt it. Though Kraven the Hunter did find something on the removed body part of the polar bear. Sometime later, Kraven the Hunter arrived at a Siberian bar wearing the pelt of the dead polar bear and carrying a bag containing a ripped-up Deadpool. A patron speaks in Russian about the mutants becoming apex predators in light of recent events. Kraven the Hunter asks in question \"What did you say?\"[80] After seeing the Progenitor and showing it an X that he carved into the palm of his left hand, Kraven the Hunter prepared to hunt mutants when Deadpool pulled himself back together. Upon learning that Deadpool was \"given the keys\" to Krakoa, Kraven the Hunter beheaded him to access a Krakoan gate.[81] Once on Krakoa, he started desecrating the mutant eggs. Then he hunted Maggott, an unidentified blue-skinned mutant, an unidentified mutant with antlers, and a mutant family with tusks. Before slaying Icarus, Kraven the Hunter learned from him that Wolverine was the best among them. This led to Kraven the Hunter abducting Beast and used him to get the knowledge he needed for the Shadow Room which he started to use on Wolverine when he returned.[82] When Wolverine caught up to Kraven the Hunter at the time when the Progenitor's attack on Krakoa caused the Shadow Room to have a structural failure that will cause it collapse, he fought Kraven the Hunter and defeated him as Kraven the Hunter is attacked by a Tyrannosaurus. Sometime after the Progenitor was defeated, an injured Kraven the Hunter finds its remains once again occupied by the Avengers and claims that he will return to Krakoa and butcher the mutants when its end is near and taste the iron in their hearts.[83] Kraven the Hunter is among the villains that are captured by Ultra Living Brain. After Spider-Man defeated the Sinister Six-type Super-Adaptoid, Ultra Living Brain teleported the villains away.[84] Kraven the Hunter later fights Queen Goblin as they hunt each other. Then they share a bed the Kravinoff estate as Queen Goblin mentions about the resurrection of some totems. Kraven the Hunter narrates that this hunt would nourish them both as his heart beats with life's fire.[85] Kraven the Hunter and Queen Goblin perfect a ritual that drains the sins of Norman Osborn into his spear. Queen Goblin states that she will be free when the sins find their way back to Norman Osborn. Queen Goblin later states that the original Kraven the Hunter was a selfish man as she claims to Kraven the Hunter that she will become better by besting Norman Osborn as they look into the casket containing the Green Goblin costume. He must return Norman Osborn his sins and then kill him. Kraven the Hunter then invades Oscorp and wrecks the Gold Goblin armor. When Spider-Man arrives, Norman Osborn locks the lab that he and Kraven the Hunter are in as Norman fights Kraven the Hunter who tries to get Norman to take his sins back. When Spider-Man gets through, he throws himself before Kraven the Hunter's spear. Norman Osborn then quotes \"What have I done\" as Spider-Man gets infected with Norman's sins while Kraven the Hunter flees.[86] Wearing a black suit, Spider-Man confronts Kraven the Hunter at the Kravinoff estate and injects him with something while ordering him to run. Kraven proceeds to run as he starts to hear his father talking to him. While in the sewers, the stuff that Kraven the Hunter was injected with has pheromones where they attract Vermin and his clones. Kraven the Hunter then defeats many of them before being knocked out. Spider-Man fights off the remaining Vermin clones and drags Kraven the Hunter where he throws him inside his grave with his gun. Then Spider-Man proceeds to bury him alive.[87] Kraven the Hunter found that Spider-Man left him some matches and a gun. He is later freed by Norman wielding the spear that was used on Spider-Man so that he can help him \"make it right\".[88] Norman Osborn and Kraven the Hunter work on a cursed weapon that would eat sins. They catch up to Spider-Man at the Holland Tunnel. Spider-Man wrestles with Kraven the Hunter who proceeds to fake being overwhelmed so that Norman can use the spear to remove the Green Goblin sins from Spider-Man. Afterwards, Kraven the Hunter states that he will bind the spear in a ceremony and bury it underground.[89] IGN ranked Kraven the Hunter 53rd in their \"Top Comic Book Villains\" list.[90] David Harth of Comic Book Resources described Kraven the Hunter as a \"cool villain\", praising the design of the character, and described him as \"more than a match for Spider-Man.\"[91] An alternate universe variant of Kraven from Earth-5030 appears in Marvel Age Spider-Man #14.[92] An alternate universe variant of Kraven from Earth-18119 appears in The Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows as a member of Regent's Sinister Six.[93] An alternate universe variant of Kraven from Earth-9997 appears in Earth X.

As Sergei fought the giant spider, he was bitten by it as Sergei managed to slay the giant spider. The giant spider's bite gave Sergei a spider physiology and the abilities that come with it. Some months later, Sergei took on the name of Hunter Spider where he hunted animal-themed costumed villains upon being contracted by J. Jonah Jameson as he managed to slay Black Cat, Grizzly, Human Fly, Lizard, Puma, Rhino, Stegron, Vulture, and White Rabbit where their remains were made into his hunting trophies. He later joined the Spider-Army during the threat of Shathra.[96] Hunter Spider was seen with the Spider-Society when they are attacked by the Sinister Squadron. When Spider-Man 2099 of Earth-2099 was seen being tortured by Halloween Jack of Earth-2099 by the time the remaining Spider-Society members arrive, Spider-Man 2099 breaks free and restrains Halloween Jack while stating that Hunter Spider became their spy.

Sergei Kravinoff was a billionaire oligarch whose family was exiled from Russia during the \"Rasputin Purge\". Stated to be from a long line of hunters, he has a personal modus operandi, always hunting in pairs, always killing one and preserving the latter.

City went into the game on a run of just one win in their last nine matches in all competitions and it showed in a cagey first half in which the visitors dominated possession, but managed just one shot on target at the Juventus Stadium. However, it was the sort of opening you have come to expect Erling Haaland to bury, slipped through on goal by Kevin De Bruyne's clever pass, only for Michele Di Gregorio to race off his line and claw away the striker's dinked effort. That miss proved costly eight minutes after half-time when Juventus made the breakthrough in scruffy fashion as Kenan Yildiz hung a ball up to the back post for Vlahovic to attack and power a close-range header past Ederson. Pep Guardiola made three changes from the 2-2 draw with Crystal Palace, handing a first start in four games to Ederson, who replaced Stefan Ortega. Also coming in were Jack Grealish and Jeremy Doku, with Matheus Nunes and Savinho dropping to the bench. City responded to falling behind with Bernardo Silva and Ilkay Gundogan both going close, before getting caught on the counter with a quarter of an hour to go. The hosts' broke down their left before working the ball to Timothy Weah and although his initial cross was blocked, he picked out fellow substitute McKennie, who volleyed spectacularly past Ederson to end the game as a contest. As a result, City lie way in 22nd place in the new Champions League standings and with just two games left to play - at 25th-placed Paris Saint-Germain and then at home to Club Brugge - they are in real danger of not even finishing in the top 24 and missing out on the play-offs after a seventh loss in their last 10 matches. Live Champions League table How the teams lined up Match stats Champions League results The pressure shows no sign of easing on City and Guardiola - they host Manchester United on Sunday, live on Sky Sports. Man City boss Pep Guardiola on TNT Sport: \"We played really, really good, we missed the last pass and action when we arrive, we concede a few, the transitions happen, but I am so proud of these players, they give everything and tried and now we live in this period, but hopefully we can change with good results - I know it is difficult, it is always difficult in Champions League, but we played really good. \"We have two games and need one point maybe, one victory with the last one at home - we lost it against Feyenoord and Inter Milan, when we played really good again and that is what created the problems. \"But when you go to Sporting Lisbon in that moment, and to Turin, Paris, our three away games were really, really tough and you have to accept it. \"But when we turn it around, we will not forget this period, we will appreciate more what we have done in the past and what we are going to do in the future and now let's continue to do it.\" Lee Hendrie on Sky Sports: Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player \"Man City are so predictable in how they approach games. That is where teams are figuring them out. \"Juventus are Juventus - they do not score many goals, they defend well and make it hard for teams, and then counter-attack. \"If I were Ruben Amorim watching that game tonight, I would copy what Juventus did - make them force balls out wide. What is the point of having [Jeremy] Doku on the pitch if not to provide crosses? \"I am watching the game, they are 2-0 down and still trying to find that perfect pass - why? Get the ball out wide to your full-backs, get support and put balls into the box. \"Try something a little bit different to try and break them down - Juventus just loved it. \"Juventus were not even that good tonight - they dug in, defended well, forced it out wide, made it hard for them and as soon as the first goal went in, it was game over. \"They brought on [Matheus] Nunes - I do not know why, I do not know what he brings to the side, I really do not. Savinho comes on and does absolutely nothing. \"It was one of those performances that was predictable and the longer this run goes on, the harder it is going to get for them.\" Tom from Southampton became a millionaire for free with Super 6!

The ailing Premier League champions have now won only once in their past 10 matches and are in very real danger of missing out on a top-24 place in the league phase and the knockout stages of Europe's top competition. City dominated possession for large periods at the Allianz Stadium but, to repeat one of the themes of their slump, lacked cutting edge as Erling Haaland cut a sometimes forlorn figure. The other hulking No. 9 on the field, Vlahovic, opened the scoring early in the second half and, after a Bianconeri defence marshalled expertly by Federico Gatti soaked up mounting waves of pressure, substitute McKennie made the points safe on the counter-attack. Thiago Motta's side, who had drawn each of their past four matches, move on to 11 points and are fairly sure of at least a place in the knockout playoffs. City are three points further back and looking nervously over their shoulder ahead of what might be a do-or-die trip to Paris Saint-Germain in January.

MORE: All the latest Champions League news | How does the 2024/25 Champions League work? | Full UCL match schedule Before the match, Guardiola insisted the injury list that has cloaked City's ongoing misery was no excuse for his players. They largely took his message on board, going back to basics to hog the ball with long, methodical spells of possession. It wasn't the sort of stuff to set the pulse racing but a moment of magic from Kevin De Bruyne released Haaland to attempt a dinked finish. Michele De Gregorio produced an excellent save in what would prove to be a pivotal moment. Vlahovic was also feeding off scraps but after Ederson saved a scissors-kick from the marauding Gatti, City were slow to react and the Brazil goalkeeper could not keep the Juve striker's header out. City then produced their most incisive period of the contest but Juve made a succession of blocks, De Bruyne drove past the post and De Gregorio denied Ilkay Gundogan. But when the Bianconeri broke with 15 minutes to play, despite Rico Lewis' initial success in stopping Timothy Weah, there was a sense of inevitability the McKennie would land the finishing blow with a sweetly taken volley. The moment represented the first time in Champions League history that one American international assisted another for a goal. The result eases mounting pressure on Motta, while Guardiola must lift his fallen, bereft champions for a derby showdown with Manchester United on Sunday. Available in the US Scored in Torino, made in America! 🇮🇹🤝🇺🇸Juve's #USMNT duo combine for a goal to remember as Tim Weah sets up Weston McKennie 🪄 pic.twitter.com/ZaZsL3u7jY City experience the increasingly familiar feeling of disappointment. They controlled this game for long periods in Turin but were tentative in attack, something probably explained by how vulnerable they are in transitions. That was highlighted once again by both goals from what is far from a vintage Juventus side. The Manchester derby is up next for Pep Guardiola's side, who are in a rut unlike anything he has experienced in his historic career. 89 mins: Another long period of City possession. Lewis's shot is deflected into De Gregorio's gloves. He wants a penalty for handball but that's not happening, even in this competition with it's bizarre interpretation of that law. 86 mins: De Bruyne, who has been excellent in a losing cause tonight, drills in a cross but again there's no one looking likely for City in the box. Silva gets in an argument with Gatti and De Gregorio and gets booked. That's awfully contructive. 84 mins: City have not found a similar response to going behind this time. They look completely sapped. Savinho is on for Doku but has not made any sort of impression. 74 mins: GOOOOOAAAAAALLLLLLL!!!!! Weston McKennie!!!! Smash and grab and that'll be the three points for Juve. The hosts have been under the cosh since going ahead but there's room to break. Lewis gets in the way of Weah at the first attempt but the cross comes in for his USMNT team-mate McKennnie who smashes home an acrobatic volley. 72 mins: City work a corner to De Bruyne outside the box and he lifts this one over. 68 mins: Nice save from De Gregorio, who scrambles across to tip a Gundogan effort out of the top corner. City take the corner quickly, nice interplay before Gatti flies in last-ditch. Messers Chiellini and Bonucci will be looking on approvingly. 66 mins: De Bruyne lines up a low drive from 25 yards. Wide, but I'm not sure De Gregorio was getting there if it was on target. 65 mins: Juve can't keep turning over possession like this. More black and white bodies in the way to deny De Bruyne. City knocking more loudly at the door. 63 mins: De Bruyne releases Doku, who drills across goal but Haaland has made a different run. City should have made more of that. 61 mins: Yildiz clatters a cross that Ederson can't get hold of. City manage to scramble clear but Grealish and Haaland are unable to get the counter-attack going. 59 mins: Nice play from Grealish, to Silva whose shot is cleared behind by Danilo. De Bruyne's corner is another poor one. 58 mins: But it means City are going to leave opportunities on the break. Lewis gets back to thwart Conceicao on this occasion. Phil Foden is warming up. 57 mins: City look to respond and there are Juve bodies on the line to deny Doku and Lewis in quick succession. 53 mins: GOOOOAAAAAALLLLLLL!!!!! Dusan Vlahovic!!! Juve get the breakthrough! Gatti drives a counter-attack and draws a fine save from Ederson with a scissors-kick. The hosts pick up the pieces, City put no pressure on the ball and, despite Ederson's best efforts, he can't keep out Vlahovic's header from Yildiz's cross. Available in the UK Juventus take the lead over Man City 🫣How will Pep Guardiola's men respond...? 🤔📺 @tntsports & @discoveryplusUK pic.twitter.com/d7xPOxByen 50 mins: De Bruyne in that position he likes down the right channel. Nice ball to pick out Gundogan, whose shot is blocked. 47 mins: Nice play from Thuram allows Conceicao to win a corner off Doku. Koopmeiners' delivery is half-cleared, Yildiz slices a shot back towards the taker, who is offside. We're back. You ne ver know, some stuff might happen... Juve end the half with a rare attack, go down a bit of a blind ally and the whistle goes before they can take a throw-in. That probably sums up a very tentative half from Thiago Motta's men. These are two teams whose confidence has taken a bit of a battering lately. City have been the better side. However, at their best, you fancy they'd have chewed up this Bianconeri and spat them out. In their current reality, Guardiola will be happy enough. 44 mins: It's getting a bit feisty inside that six-yard box. De Bruyne's in-swinger is cleared and Lewis can't make a clean contact with the bouncing ball. 43 mins: The Belgian maestro spotted a gap at the near post there but Thuram is wise to it and heads behind. 42 mins: Conceicao knows all about the dangers of a livewire, dribbling winger. I'm not sure his team-mates will thank him for clouting Doku up in the air though. De Bruyne over the free-kick. 40 mins: Here's a chance for Haaland... saved by De Gregorio! Fabulous, deft pass from De Bruyne that Haaland tries to match for impudence with a dinked finish. The Juventus goalkeeper reads it superbly. Juve go up the other end and Locatelli thuds one into Ederson's gloves from distance. 37 mins: Now Grealish finds Haaland, probably delaying the pass a little too much. Haaland crosses - I'm not sure who he thinks might be there - and Thuram chests back to De Gregorio. 36 mins: More patient, zipping City possession. De Bruyne's cross is blocked, half a chance for Haaland to shoot on the turn but there are bodies in the way. 33 mins: Koopmeiners runs into Clement Turpin and the referee looks in a bit of pain! He's going to soldier on. 31 mins: Walker probably isn't a fan of the late offside flag. It comes to his aid here, but only after the livewire Yildiz has given the struggling veteran a going over. 29 mins: Lovely turn inside from Yildiz, who's looked the most likely of Juve's creators. Vlahovic gets past Walker but can't get the ball under his spell. It runs too wide and City are able to mop up. 24 mins: Now De Bruyne gets to the byline inside the box on the underlapping run. He looks for Haaland but the big No. 9 is crowded out. 23 mins: De Bruyne and Gundogan combine smartly inside the Juve box. The ball comes across to Doku and his attempt is booted out of the goalmouth. The game is getting a bit more stretched. 22 mins: Conceicao has Lewis in his sights again. He cuts it back to about 12 yards out. No Juve player reads it but Silva does smartly. 19 mins: Locatelli produces a searching cross that Gvardiol heads out towards Yildiz about 25 yards out. That's a sweet strike from the Turkish teenager and it whistles just past Ederson's left post. 17 mins: Some nice feet form Silva wins City a corner but it comes to nought. 16 mins: Another interesting set-piece position for De Bruyne and another disappointing outcome as a tame, floated delivery is cleared. 15 mins: That looks more like a Thiago Motta side: Juve harry City in their own third and Walker ends up clattering the ball out for a throw. 14 mins: De Bruyne takes is short, exchanging passes with Doku. Juve clear, City retain possession. We're still waiting for any notable goalmouth action. 13 mins: Savona brings down Doku about 25 yards out on the left. Nice angle for De Bruyne... 10 mins: Koopmeiners overcooks the delivery. That's a waste. Timothy Weah is warming up in case Conceicao doesn't manage to run his knock off. 9 mins: Lewis gets himself in a mess against Conceicao, who's still down and in pain as Juve wait to take the resulting corner. The Portugal winger looked like he was fouled, in all honesty. A corner will have to do. 5 mins: Juve get their first foray of the night in behind the City defence. Vlahovic thinks he's won a corner off Dias but the offside flag goes up. That City line has not been especially settled or reliable of late but they did their job there. 2 mins: City hogging possession and Juve not fully committing to their press just yet. Interestingly, De Bruyne has been doing a bit of quarterbacking in the right-back position. He attacks down the same flank and looks for Haaland but De Gregorio claims the cross smartly. City's pre-match huddle draws whistles from a pumped-up Bianconeri crowd. Now we're underway. 5 mins before kickoff: The players are in the tunnel and the Allianz Stadium lights show is in operation. Here they come. 30 mins before kickoff: City's previous outing in the Champions League was arguably the most damaging game of their recent slump. Sure, they took a point from the game against Feyenoord, but it would have been unthinkable at pretty much any point over the past seven years that Guardola's all-conquering team would let a 3-0 lead at home slip with 15 minutes to go. But that's exactly what happened. FEYENOORD COME BACK FROM 3-0 DOWN TO STUN MANCHESTER CITY 😱 pic.twitter.com/HWB2NGMOjN 1 hour before kickoff: Here's the Juve XI. Dusan Vlahovic is fit to start after his weekend return. Experienced Brazilian defender Danilo is selected as captain against his former club.

City have the same patched-up back four that played out a 2-2 draw at Crystal Palace, with Kyle Walker at fault for both goals before Rico Lewis was sent off. Guardiola is shy on defensive options in defence. The same can be said in midfield, where Ilkay Gundogan, Bernardo Silva and Kevin De Bruyne all start for the third time in a week despite the Manchester derby being on the horizon this Sunday. Ederson comes back in having lost his place to Stefan Orteta for the past three Premier League matches.

They last faced Juventus in the group stage of 2015/16, Manuel Pellegrini's final season in charge before making way for Guardiola. His side lost 2-1 from 1-0 up in Manchester before Juve completed the double with a 1-0 triumph in Turin. However, results in the other four matches led to City topping the group and plotting a path to the semifinals, where they lost 1-0 to eventual winners Real Madrid. 2 hours before kickoff. Hello and welcome to The Sporting News' live coverage of Juventus vs. Manchester City in the Champions League. Juve have drawn their past four games in all competitions, while City have won just one of their past nine. Both Thiago Motta and Pep Guardiola could badly do with a change in fortunes. This UEFA Champions League match kicks off in Turin, Italy at 9 p.m. local time. Here's how that time translates across some of the major territories: Motta was boosted by the return of striker Dusan Vlahovic from a thigh injury at the weekend and his first-choice No. 9 is in from kickoff tonight. Danilo starts as captain against his former club, while Douglas Luiz and Weston McKennie have recovered from their respective setbacks to be named among the substitutes.

            {
                "title": "Maria Callas - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Maria Callas[a] Commendatore OMRI[1] (born Maria Anna Cecilia Sofia Kalogeropoulos;[b] December 2, 1923 – September 16, 1977) was an American-born Greek soprano[2] and one of the most renowned and influential opera singers of the 20th century. Many critics praised her bel canto technique, wide-ranging voice and dramatic interpretations. Her repertoire ranged from classical opera seria to the bel canto operas of Donizetti, Bellini, and Rossini, and further to the works of Verdi and Puccini, and in her early career to the music dramas of Wagner. Her musical and dramatic talents led to her being hailed as La Divina (\"The Divine One\"). Born in Manhattan, New York City, to Greek immigrant parents, she was raised by an overbearing mother who had wanted a son. Maria received her musical education in Greece at age 13 and later established her career in Italy. Forced to deal with the exigencies of 1940s wartime poverty and with near-sightedness that left her nearly blind onstage, she endured struggles and scandal over the course of her career. She underwent a mid-career weight loss, which might have contributed to her vocal decline and the premature end of her career. The press exulted in publicizing Callas' temperamental behavior, the alleged Callas-Tebaldi rivalry, and her love affair with Greek shipping tycoon Aristotle Onassis. Although her dramatic life and personal tragedy have often overshadowed Callas the artist in the popular press, her artistic achievements were such that Leonard Bernstein called her \"the Bible of opera\",[3] and her influence so enduring that, in 2006, Opera News wrote of her: \"Nearly thirty years after her death, she's still the definition of the diva as artist—and still one of classical music's best-selling vocalists.\"[4] The name on Callas' New York birth certificate is Sophie Cecilia Kalos,[5] although she was christened Maria Anna Cecilia Sofia Kalogeropoulos (Greek: Μαρία Άννα Καικιλία Σοφία Καλογεροπούλου).[6] She was born at Flower Fifth Avenue Hospital (now the Terence Cardinal Cooke Health Care Center) on December 2, 1923, to Greek parents, George Kalogeropoulos (c. 1881–1972) and Elmina Evangelia \"Litsa\", née Demes, originally Dimitriadou (c. 1894–1982). Callas' father had shortened the surname Kalogeropoulos, first to \"Kalos\" and subsequently to \"Callas\" to make it more manageable.[7] George and Litsa Callas were an ill-matched couple from the beginning. George was easy-going and unambitious, with no interest in the arts, and Litsa was vivacious and socially ambitious and had dreamed of a life in the arts, which her middle-class parents had stifled in her childhood and youth.[8] Litsa's father, Petros Dimitriadis (1852–1916), was in failing health when Litsa introduced George to her family. Petros, distrustful of George, had warned his daughter, \"You will never be happy with him. If you marry that man, I will never be able to help you\". Litsa had ignored his warning, but soon realized that her father was right.[9] The situation was aggravated by George's philandering and was improved neither by the birth of a daughter, named Yakinthi (later called \"Jackie\") in 1917, nor the birth of a son, named Vassilis, in 1920. Vassilis's death from meningitis in the summer of 1922 dealt another blow to the marriage.[citation needed] In 1923, after realizing that Litsa was pregnant again, George made the decision to move his family to the United States, a decision which Yakinthi recalled was greeted with Litsa \"shouting hysterically\" followed by George \"slamming doors\".[10] The family left for New York in July 1923, moving first into an apartment in the heavily ethnic neighborhood of Astoria, Queens.[citation needed] Litsa was convinced that her third child would be a boy; her disappointment at the birth of another daughter was so great that she refused to even look at her new baby for four days.[5] Maria was christened three years later at the Archdiocesan Cathedral of the Holy Trinity in 1926.[11] When Maria was 4, George Callas opened his own pharmacy, settling the family in Manhattan on 192nd Street in Washington Heights, where Callas grew up. Around the age of three, Maria's musical talent began to manifest itself, and after Litsa discovered that her youngest daughter also had a voice, she began pressing \"Mary\" to sing. Callas later recalled, \"I was made to sing when I was only five, and I hated it.\"[12] George was unhappy with his wife favoring their elder daughter, as well as the pressure put upon young Mary to sing and perform,[13] and Litsa was increasingly embittered with George and his absences and infidelity, and often violently reviled him in front of their children.[14] The marriage continued to deteriorate, and in 1937, Litsa returned to Athens with her two daughters.[15] Callas' relationship with her mother continued to erode during the years in Greece, and in the prime of her career, it became a matter of great public interest, especially after a 1956 cover story in Time magazine which focused on this relationship and later, by Litsa's book My Daughter Maria Callas (1960). In public, Callas recalls the strained relationship with Litsa on her unhappy childhood spent singing and working at her mother's insistence, saying, My sister was slim and beautiful and friendly, and my mother always preferred her. I was the ugly duckling, fat and clumsy and unpopular. It is a cruel thing to make a child feel ugly and unwanted... I'll never forgive her for taking my childhood away. During all the years I should have been playing and growing up, I was singing or making money. Everything I did for them was mostly good and everything they did to me was mostly bad.[16] In 1957, she told Chicago radio host Norman Ross Jr., \"There must be a law against forcing children to perform at an early age. Children should have a wonderful childhood. They should not be given too much responsibility.\"[17] Biographer Nicholas Petsalis-Diomidis [el] says that Litsa's hateful treatment of George in front of their young children led to resentment and dislike on Callas' part.[18] According to both Callas' husband and her close friend Giulietta Simionato, Callas related to them that her mother, who did not work, pressed her to \"go out with various men\", mainly Italian and German soldiers, to bring home money and food during the Axis occupation of Greece during World War II. Simionato was convinced that Callas \"managed to remain untouched\", but never forgave her mother for what she perceived as a kind of prostitution forced on her.[19] Litsa, beginning in New York and continuing in Athens, had adopted a questionable lifestyle that included not only pushing her daughters into degrading situations to support her financially, but also entertaining Italian and German soldiers during the Axis occupation.[20] In an attempt to patch things up with her mother, Callas took Litsa along on her first visit to Mexico in 1950, but this only reawakened the old frictions and resentments, and after leaving Mexico they never met again. After a series of angry and accusatory letters from Litsa lambasting Callas' father and husband, Callas ceased communication with her mother altogether.[21] A 1955 Time story [22][23][24] covered Callas' response to her mother's request of $100, \"for my daily bread.\" Callas had replied, \"Don't come to us with your troubles. I had to work for my money, and you are young enough to work, too. If you can't make enough money to live on, you can jump out of the window or drown yourself.\" Callas justified her behavior...\"They say my family is very short of money. Before God, I say why should they blame me? I feel no guilt and I feel no gratitude. I like to show kindness, but you mustn't expect thanks, because you won't get any. That's the way life is. If some day I need help, I wouldn't expect anything from anybody. When I'm old, nobody is going to worry about me.\"[23] Callas received her musical education in Athens. Initially, her mother tried to enroll her at the prestigious Athens Conservatoire, without success. At the audition, her voice, still untrained, failed to impress, and the conservatoire's director Filoktitis Oikonomidis [el] refused to accept her without her satisfying the theoretic prerequisites (solfege). In the summer of 1937, her mother visited Maria Trivella at the younger Greek National Conservatoire, asking her to take Mary, as she was then called, as a student for a modest fee. In 1957, Trivella recalled her impression of \"Mary, a very plump young girl, wearing big glasses for her myopia\": The tone of the voice was warm, lyrical, intense; it swirled and flared like a flame and filled the air with melodious reverberations like a carillon. It was by any standards an amazing phenomenon, or rather it was a great talent that needed control, technical training and strict discipline in order to shine with all its brilliance.[25] Trivella agreed to tutor Callas, completely waiving her tuition fees, but no sooner had Callas started her formal lessons and vocal exercises than Trivella began to feel that Callas was not a contralto, as she had been told, but a dramatic soprano. Subsequently, they began working on raising the tessitura of her voice and to lighten its timbre.[25] Trivella recalled Callas as A model student. Fanatical, uncompromising, dedicated to her studies heart and soul. Her progress was phenomenal. She studied five or six hours a day. ...Within six months, she was singing the most difficult arias in the international opera repertoire with the utmost musicality.[25] On April 11, 1938, in her public debut, Callas ended the recital of Trivella's class at the Parnassos music hall with a duet from Tosca.[25] Callas recalled that Trivella had a French method, which was placing the voice in the nose, rather nasal... and I had the problem of not having low chest tones, which is essential in bel canto... And that's where I learned my chest tones.[26] However, when interviewed by Pierre Desgraupes on the French program L'invitée du dimanche, Callas attributed the development of her chest voice not to Trivella, but to her next teacher, the Spanish coloratura soprano Elvira de Hidalgo.[27] Callas studied with Trivella for two years before her mother secured another audition at the Athens Conservatoire with de Hidalgo. Callas auditioned with \"Ocean, Thou Mighty Monster\" from Weber's Oberon. De Hidalgo recalled hearing \"tempestuous, extravagant cascades of sounds, as yet uncontrolled but full of drama and emotion\".[25] She agreed to take her as a pupil immediately, but Callas' mother asked de Hidalgo to wait for a year, as Callas would be graduating from the National Conservatoire and could begin working. On April 2, 1939, Callas undertook the part of Santuzza in a student production of Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana at the Greek National Opera at the Olympia Theatre, and in the fall of the same year she enrolled at the Athens Conservatoire in Elvira de Hidalgo's class.[25] In 1968, Callas told Lord Harewood, De Hildalgo had the real great training, maybe even the last real training of the real bel canto. As a young girl—thirteen years old—I was immediately thrown into her arms, meaning that I learned the secrets, the ways of this bel canto, which of course as you well know, is not just beautiful singing. It is a very hard training; it is a sort of a strait-jacket that you're supposed to put on, whether you like it or not. You have to learn to read, to write, to form your sentences, how far you can go, fall, hurt yourself, put yourself back on your feet continuously. De Hidalgo had one method, which was the real bel canto way, where no matter how heavy a voice, it should always be kept light, it should always be worked on in a flexible way, never to weigh it down. It is a method of keeping the voice light and flexible and pushing the instrument into a certain zone where it might not be too large in sound, but penetrating. And teaching the scales, trills, all the bel canto embellishments, which is a whole vast language of its own.[26] De Hidalgo later recalled Callas as \"a phenomenon... She would listen to all my students, sopranos, mezzos, tenors... She could do it all.\"[28] Callas said that she would go to \"the conservatoire at 10 in the morning and leave with the last pupil ... devouring music\" for 10 hours a day. When asked by her teacher why she did this, her answer was that even \"with the least talented pupil, he can teach you something that you, the most talented, might not be able to do.\"[29] After several appearances as a student, Callas began appearing in secondary roles at the Greek National Opera. De Hidalgo was instrumental in securing roles for her, allowing Callas to earn a small salary, which helped her and her family get through the difficult war years.[25] Callas made her professional debut in February 1941, in the small role of Beatrice in Franz von Suppé's Boccaccio. Soprano Galatea Amaxopoulou, who sang in the chorus, later recalled, \"Even in rehearsal, Maria's fantastic performing ability had been obvious, and from then on, the others started trying ways of preventing her from appearing.\"[25] Fellow singer Maria Alkeou similarly recalled that the established sopranos Nafsika Galanou and Anna (Zozó) Remmoundou \"used to stand in the wings while [Callas] was singing and make remarks about her, muttering, laughing, and point their fingers at her\".[25] Despite these hostilities, Callas managed to continue and made her debut in a leading role in August 1942 as Tosca, going on to sing the role of Marta in Eugen d'Albert's Tiefland at the Olympia Theatre. Callas' performance as Marta received glowing reviews. Critic Spanoudi declared Callas \"an extremely dynamic artist possessing the rarest dramatic and musical gifts\", and Evangelos Magkliveras evaluated Callas' performance for the weekly To Radiophonon: The singer who took the part of Marta, that new star in the Greek firmament, with a matchless depth of feeling, gave a theatrical interpretation well up to the standard of a tragic actress. About her exceptional voice with its astonishing natural fluency, I do not wish to add anything to the words of Alexandra Lalaouni: 'Kalogeropoulou is one of those God-given talents that one can only marvel at.'[25] Following these performances, even Callas' detractors began to refer to her as \"The God-Given\".[25] Some time later, watching Callas rehearse Beethoven's Fidelio, rival soprano Anna Remoundou asked a colleague \"Could it be that there is something divine and we haven't realized it?\"[25] Following Tiefland, Callas sang the role of Santuzza in Cavalleria rusticana again and followed it with O Protomastoras [el] (Manolis Kalomiris) at the ancient Odeon of Herodes Atticus theatre at the foot of the Acropolis. During August and September 1944, Callas performed the role of Leonore in a Greek language production of Fidelio, again at the Odeon of Herodes Atticus. German critic Friedrich Herzog, who witnessed the performances, declared Leonore Callas' \"greatest triumph\":[25] When Maria Kaloyeropoulou's Leonore let her soprano soar out radiantly in the untrammelled jubilation of the duet, she rose to the most sublime heights...Here she gave bud, blossom and fruit to that harmony of sound that also ennobled the art of the prima donna.[25] After the liberation of Greece, de Hidalgo advised Callas to establish herself in Italy. Callas proceeded to give a series of concerts around Greece, and then, against her teacher's advice, she returned to America to see her father and to further pursue her career. When she left Greece on September 14, 1945, two months short of her 22nd birthday, Callas had given 56 performances in seven operas and had appeared in around 20 recitals.[25] Callas considered her Greek career as the foundation of her musical and dramatic upbringing, saying \"When I got to the big career, there were no surprises for me.\"[30] After returning to the United States and reuniting with her father in September 1945, Callas made the round of auditions.[25] In December of that year, she auditioned for Edward Johnson, general manager of the Metropolitan Opera, and was favorably received: \"Exceptional voice—ought to be heard very soon on stage\".[25] Callas maintained that the Metropolitan Opera offered her Madama Butterfly and Fidelio, to be performed in Philadelphia and sung in English, both of which she declined, feeling she was too fat for Butterfly and did not like the idea of opera in English.[30] Although no written evidence of this offer exists in the Met's records,[21] in a 1958 interview with the New York Post, Johnson confirmed that a contract was offered: \"... but she didn't like it—because of the contract, not because of the roles. She was right in turning it down—it was frankly a beginner's contract.\"[25] In 1946, Callas was engaged to re-open the opera house in Chicago as Turandot, but the company folded before opening. Basso Nicola Rossi-Lemeni, who also was to star in this opera, was aware that Tullio Serafin was looking for a dramatic soprano to cast as La Gioconda at the Arena di Verona. He later recalled the young Callas as being \"amazing—so strong physically and spiritually; so certain of her future. I knew in a big outdoor theatre like Verona's, this girl, with her courage and huge voice, would make a tremendous impact.\"[31][page needed] Subsequently he recommended Callas to retired tenor and impresario Giovanni Zenatello. During her audition, Zenatello became so excited that he jumped up and joined Callas in the act 4 duet.[13] It was in this role that Callas made her Italian debut. Upon her arrival in Verona, Callas met Giovanni Battista Meneghini, an older, wealthy industrialist, who began courting her. They married in 1949, and he assumed control of her career until 1959, when the marriage dissolved. It was Meneghini's love and support that gave Callas the time needed to establish herself in Italy,[31][page needed] and throughout the prime of her career, she went by the name of Maria Meneghini Callas. After La Gioconda, Callas had no offers, and when Serafin, looking for someone to sing Isolde, called on her, she told him that she already knew the score, even though she had looked at only the first act out of curiosity while at the conservatory.[30] She sight-read the opera's second act for Serafin, who praised her for knowing the role so well, whereupon she admitted to having bluffed and having sight-read the music. Even more impressed, Serafin immediately cast her in the role.[30] Serafin thereafter served as Callas' mentor and supporter. Lord Harewood stated \"Very few Italian conductors have had a more distinguished career than Tullio Serafin, and perhaps none, apart from Toscanini, more influence\".[29] In 1968, Callas recalled that working with Serafin was the \"really lucky\" opportunity of her career because \"he taught me that there must be an expression; that there must be a justification. He taught me the depth of music, the justification of music. That's where I really really drank all I could from this man\".[26] The great turning point in Callas' career occurred in Venice in 1949.[32] She was engaged to sing the role of Brünnhilde in Die Walküre at the Teatro la Fenice, when Margherita Carosio, who was engaged to sing Elvira in I puritani in the same theatre, fell ill. Unable to find a replacement for Carosio, Serafin told Callas that she would be singing Elvira in six days; when Callas protested that she not only did not know the role, but also had three more Brünnhildes to sing, he told her \"I guarantee that you can\".[29] Michael Scott's words, \"the notion of any one singer embracing music as divergent in its vocal demands as Wagner's Brünnhilde and Bellini's Elvira in the same career would have been cause enough for surprise; but to attempt to essay them both in the same season seemed like folie de grandeur\".[21] Before the performance actually took place, one incredulous critic snorted, \"We hear that Serafin has agreed to conduct I puritani with a dramatic soprano ... When can we expect a new edition of La traviata with [male baritone] Gino Bechi's Violetta?\"[21] After the performance, one critic wrote, \"Even the most sceptical had to acknowledge the miracle that Maria Callas accomplished... the flexibility of her limpid, beautifully poised voice, and her splendid high notes. Her interpretation also has a humanity, warmth and expressiveness that one would search for in vain in the fragile, pellucid coldness of other Elviras.\"[33] Franco Zeffirelli recalled, \"What she did in Venice was really incredible. You need to be familiar with opera to realize the size of her achievement. It was as if someone asked Birgit Nilsson, who is famous for her great Wagnerian voice, to substitute overnight for Beverly Sills, who is one of the great coloratura sopranos of our time.\"[28][34][35] Scott asserts that \"Of all the many roles Callas undertook, it is doubtful if any had a more far-reaching effect.\"[21] This initial foray into the bel canto repertoire changed the course of Callas' career and set her on a path leading to Lucia di Lammermoor, La traviata, Armida, La sonnambula, Il pirata, Il turco in Italia, Medea, and Anna Bolena, and reawakened interest in the long-neglected operas of Cherubini, Bellini, Donizetti and Rossini.[28][31][page needed] In the words of soprano Montserrat Caballé: She opened a new door for us, for all the singers in the world, a door that had been closed. Behind it was sleeping not only great music but great idea of interpretation. She has given us the chance, those who follow her, to do things that were hardly possible before her. That I am compared with Callas is something I never dared to dream. It is not right. I am much smaller than Callas.[31][page needed] As with I puritani, Callas learned and performed Cherubini's Medea, Giordano's Andrea Chénier and Rossini's Armida on a few days' notice.[31][page needed][36] Throughout her career, Callas displayed her vocal versatility in recitals that juxtaposed dramatic soprano arias alongside coloratura pieces, including in a 1952 RAI recital in which she opened with \"Lady Macbeth's letter scene\", followed by the \"Mad Scene\" from Lucia di Lammermoor, then Abigaille's treacherous recitative and aria from Nabucco, finishing with the \"Bell Song\" from Lakmé capped by a ringing high E in alt (E6).[36] Although by 1951, Callas had sung at all the major theatres in Italy, she had not yet made her official debut at Italy's most prestigious opera house, Teatro alla Scala in Milan. According to composer Gian Carlo Menotti, Callas had substituted for Renata Tebaldi in the role of Aida in 1950, and La Scala's general manager, Antonio Ghiringhelli, had taken an immediate dislike to Callas.[28] Menotti recalls that Ghiringhelli had promised him any singer he wanted for the premiere of The Consul, but when he suggested Callas, Ghiringhelli said that he would never have Callas at La Scala except as a guest artist. However, as Callas' fame grew, and especially after her great success in I vespri siciliani in Florence, Ghiringhelli had to relent: Callas made her official debut at La Scala in Verdi's I vespri siciliani on opening night in December 1951, and this theatre became her artistic home throughout the 1950s.[28] La Scala mounted many new productions specially for Callas by directors such as Herbert von Karajan, Margherita Wallmann, Franco Zeffirelli and, most importantly, Luchino Visconti.[31][page needed] Visconti stated later that he began directing opera only because of Callas,[37] and he directed her in lavish new productions of La vestale, La traviata, La sonnambula, Anna Bolena and Iphigénie en Tauride. Callas was instrumental in arranging Franco Corelli's debut at La Scala in 1954, where he sang Licinio in Spontini's La vestale opposite Callas' Julia. The two had sung together for the first time the year previously in Rome in a production of Norma. Anthony Tommasini wrote that Corelli had \"earned great respect from the fearsomely demanding Callas, who, in Mr Corelli, finally had someone with whom she could act.\"[38] The two collaborated several more times at La Scala, singing opposite each other in productions of Fedora (1956), Il pirata (1958) and Poliuto (1960). Their partnership continued throughout the rest of Callas' career.[39] The night of the day she married Meneghini in Verona, she sailed for Argentina to sing at the Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires. Callas made her South American debut in Buenos Aires on May 20, 1949, during the European summer opera recess. Aida, Turandot and Norma roles were directed by Serafin, supported by Mario Del Monaco, Fedora Barbieri and Nicola Rossi-Lemeni. These were her only appearances on this world-renowned stage. Her debut in the United States was five years later in Chicago in 1954, and \"with the Callas Norma, Lyric Opera of Chicago was born.\"[40] Her Metropolitan Opera debut, opening the Met's seventy-second season on October 29, 1956, was again with Norma,[41] but was preceded by an unflattering cover story in Time magazine, which rehashed all of the Callas clichés, including her temper, her supposed rivalry with Renata Tebaldi, and especially her difficult relationship with her mother.[13][32] As she had done with Lyric Opera of Chicago, on November 21, 1957, Callas gave a concert to inaugurate what then was billed as the Dallas Civic Opera, and helped establish that company with her friends from Chicago, Lawrence Kelly and Nicola Rescigno.[42] She further consolidated this company's standing when, in 1958, she gave \"a towering performance as Violetta in La traviata, and that same year, in her only American performances of Medea, gave an interpretation of the title role worthy of Euripides.\"[43] In 1958, a feud with Rudolf Bing led to Callas' Metropolitan Opera contract being cancelled. Impresario Allen Oxenburg realised that this situation provided him with an opportunity for his own company, the American Opera Society, and he accordingly approached her with a contract to perform Imogene in Il pirata. She accepted and sang the role in a January 1959 performance that according to opera critic Allan Kozinn \"quickly became legendary in operatic circles\".[44] Bing and Callas later reconciled their differences, and she returned to the Met in 1965 to sing the title role in two performances as Tosca opposite Franco Corelli as Cavaradossi for one performance (March 19, 1965) and Richard Tucker (March 25, 1965) with Tito Gobbi as Scarpia for her final performances at the Met.[citation needed] In 1952, she made her London debut at the Royal Opera House in Norma with veteran mezzo-soprano Ebe Stignani as Adalgisa, a performance which survives on record and also features the young Joan Sutherland in the small role of Clotilde.[36] Callas and the London public had what she called \"a love affair\",[13] and she returned to the Royal Opera House in 1953, 1957, 1958, 1959, and 1964 to 1965.[31][page needed] It was at the Royal Opera House where, on July 5, 1965, Callas ended her stage career in the role of Tosca, in a production designed and mounted for her by Franco Zeffirelli and featuring her friend and colleague Tito Gobbi.[31][page needed] In the early years of her career, Callas was a heavy woman; in her own words, \"Heavy—one can say—yes I was; but I'm also a tall woman, 5' 8+1⁄2\" (1.74 m), and I used to weigh no more than 200 pounds (90 kilograms).\"[30] Tito Gobbi relates that during a lunch break while recording Lucia in Florence, Serafin commented to Callas that she was eating too much and allowing her weight to become a problem. When she protested that she was not so heavy, Gobbi suggested she should \"put the matter to test\" by stepping on the weighing machine outside the restaurant. The result was \"somewhat dismaying, and she became rather silent.\"[46] In 1968, Callas told Edward Downes that during her initial performances in Cherubini's Medea in May 1953, she realized that she needed a leaner face and figure to do dramatic justice to this as well as the other roles she was undertaking. She adds, I was getting so heavy that even my vocalizing was getting heavy. I was tiring myself, I was perspiring too much, and I was really working too hard. And I wasn't really well, as in health; I couldn't move freely. And then I was tired of playing a game, for instance playing this beautiful young woman, and I was heavy and uncomfortable to move around. In any case, it was uncomfortable and I didn't like it. So I felt now if I'm going to do things right—I've studied all my life to put things right musically, so why don't I diet and put myself into a certain condition where I'm presentable.[30] During 1953 and early 1954, she lost almost 80 pounds (36 kg), turning herself into what Rescigno called \"possibly the most beautiful lady on the stage\".[28] Various rumors spread regarding her weight loss method; one had her swallowing a tapeworm, and Rome's Panatella Mills pasta company claimed she lost weight by eating their \"physiologic pasta\", prompting Callas to file a lawsuit.[21] Callas stated that she lost the weight by eating a sensible low-calorie diet of mainly salads and chicken.[30] Callas never regained the weight she lost and kept her slim figure until her death. Some believe that the loss of body mass made it more difficult for her to support her voice, triggering the vocal strain that became apparent later in the decade, and others believed the weight loss effected a newfound softness and femininity in her voice, as well as a greater confidence as a person and performer.[31][page needed] Tito Gobbi said, Now she was not only supremely gifted both musically and dramatically—she was a beauty too. And her awareness of this invested with fresh magic every role she undertook. What it eventually did to her vocal and nervous stamina I am not prepared to say. I only assert that she blossomed into an artist unique in her generation and outstanding in the whole range of vocal history.[46] Callas' voice was and remains controversial; it bothered and disturbed as many as it thrilled and inspired.[31][page needed][36][page needed] Walter Legge stated that Callas possessed that most essential ingredient for a great singer: an instantly recognizable voice.[47] During \"The Callas Debate\", Italian critic Rodolfo Celletti stated, \"The timbre of Callas' voice, considered purely as sound, was essentially ugly: it was a thick sound, which gave the impression of dryness, of aridity. It lacked those elements which, in a singer's jargon, are described as velvet and varnish... yet I really believe that part of her appeal was precisely due to this fact. Why? Because for all its natural lack of varnish, velvet and richness, this voice could acquire such distinctive colours and timbres as to be unforgettable.\"[48] However, in his review of Callas' 1951 live recording of I vespri siciliani, Ira Siff writes, \"Accepted wisdom tells us that Callas possessed, even early on, a flawed voice, unattractive by conventional standards—an instrument that signaled from the beginning vocal problems to come. Yet listen to her entrance in this performance and one encounters a rich, spinning sound, ravishing by any standard, capable of delicate dynamic nuance. High notes are free of wobble, chest tones unforced, and the middle register displays none of the \"bottled\" quality that became more and more pronounced as Callas matured.\"[49] Nicola Rossi-Lemeni relates that Callas' mentor Serafin used to refer to her as Una grande vociaccia; he continues, \"Vociaccia is a little bit pejorative—it means an ugly voice—but grande means a big voice, a great voice. A great ugly voice, in a way.\"[50] Callas did not like the sound of her own voice; in one of her last interviews, answering whether or not she was able to listen to her own voice, she replies, Yes, but I don't like it. I have to do it, but I don't like it at all because I don't like the kind of voice I have. I really hate listening to myself! The first time I listened to a recording of my singing was when we were recording San Giovanni Battista by Stradella in a church in Perugia in 1949. They made me listen to the tape and I cried my eyes out. I wanted to stop everything, to give up singing... Also now even though I don't like my voice, I've become able to accept it and to be detached and objective about it so I can say, \"Oh, that was really well sung,\" or \"It was nearly perfect.\"[51] Carlo Maria Giulini has described the appeal of Callas' voice: It is very difficult to speak of the voice of Callas. Her voice was a very special instrument. Something happens sometimes with string instruments—violin, viola, cello—where the first moment you listen to the sound of this instrument, the first feeling is a bit strange sometimes. But after just a few minutes, when you get used to, when you become friends with this kind of sound, then the sound becomes a magical quality. This was Callas.[28] Callas' voice has been difficult to place in the modern vocal classification or Fach system, especially since in her prime, her repertoire contained the heaviest dramatic soprano roles as well as roles usually undertaken by the highest, lightest and most agile coloratura sopranos. Regarding this versatility, Serafin said, \"This woman can sing anything written for the female voice\".[13] Michael Scott argues that Callas' voice was a natural high soprano,[21] and going by evidence of Callas' early recordings, Rosa Ponselle likewise felt that \"At that stage of its development, her voice was a pure but sizable dramatic coloratura—that is to say, a sizable coloratura voice with dramatic capabilities, not the other way around.\"[52] On the other hand, music critic John Ardoin has argued that Callas was the reincarnation of the 19th-century soprano sfogato or \"unlimited soprano\", a throwback to Maria Malibran and Giuditta Pasta, for whom many of the famous bel canto operas were written. He avers that like Pasta and Malibran, Callas was a natural mezzo-soprano whose range was extended through training and willpower, resulting in a voice which \"lacked the homogeneous color and evenness of scale once so prized in singing. There were unruly sections of their voices never fully under control. Many who heard Pasta, for example, remarked that her uppermost notes seemed produced by ventriloquism, a charge which would later be made against Callas\".[53] Ardoin points to the writings of Henry Chorley about Pasta which bear an uncanny resemblance to descriptions of Callas: There was a portion of the scale which differed from the rest in quality and remained to the last 'under a veil.' ...out of these uncouth materials she had to compose her instrument and then to give it flexibility. Her studies to acquire execution must have been tremendous; but the volubility and brilliancy, when acquired, gained a character of their own... There were a breadth, an expressiveness in her roulades, an evenness and solidity in her shake, which imparted to every passage a significance totally beyond the reach of lighter and more spontaneous singers... The best of her audience were held in thrall, without being able to analyze what made up the spell, what produced the effect—as soon as she opened her lips.[31][page needed] Callas appears to have been in agreement not only with Ardoin's assertions that she started as a natural mezzo-soprano, but also saw the similarities between herself and Pasta and Malibran. In 1957, she described her early voice as: \"The timbre was dark, almost black—when I think of it, I think of thick molasses\", and in 1968 she added, \"They say I was not a true soprano, I was rather toward a mezzo\".[25] Regarding her ability to sing the heaviest as well as the lightest roles, she told James Fleetwood, It's study; it's Nature. I'm doing nothing special, you know. Even Lucia, Anna Bolena, Puritani, all these operas were created for one type of soprano, the type that sang Norma, Fidelio, which was Malibran of course. And a funny coincidence last year, I was singing Anna Bolena and Sonnambula, same months and the same distance of time as Giuditta Pasta had sung in the nineteenth century... So I'm really not doing anything extraordinary. You wouldn't ask a pianist not to be able to play everything; he has to. This is Nature and also because I had a wonderful teacher, the old kind of teaching methods...I was a very heavy voice, that is my nature, a dark voice shall we call it, and I was always kept on the light side. She always trained me to keep my voice limber.[54] Regarding the sheer size of Callas' instrument, Rodolfo Celletti says, \"Her voice was penetrating. The volume as such was average: neither small nor powerful. But the penetration, allied to this incisive quality (which bordered on the ugly because it frequently contained an element of harshness) ensured that her voice could be clearly heard anywhere in the auditorium.\"[48] Celletti wrote that Callas had \"a voluminous, penetrating, and dark voice\" (una voce voluminosa, squillante e di timbro scuro).[55] After her first performance of Medea in 1953, the critic for Musical Courier wrote that \"she displayed a vocal generosity that was scarcely believable for its amplitude and resilience.\"[33] In a 1982 Opera News interview with Joan Sutherland and Richard Bonynge, Bonynge stated, \"But before she slimmed down, I mean this was such a colossal voice. It just poured out of her, the way Flagstad's did.... Callas had a huge voice. When she and Stignani sang Norma, at the bottom of the range you could barely tell who was who ... Oh it was colossal. And she took the big sound right up to the top.\"[56] In his book, Michael Scott makes the distinction that whereas Callas' pre-1954 voice was a \"dramatic soprano with an exceptional top\", after the weight loss, it became, as one Chicago critic described the voice in Lucia,[33] a \"huge soprano leggiero\".[21] In performance, Callas' vocal range was just short of three octaves, from F-sharp (F♯3) below middle C (C4) heard in \"Arrigo! Ah parli a un core\" from I vespri siciliani to E-natural (E6) above high C (C6), heard in the aria \"Mercè, dilette amiche\" in the final act of the same opera, as well as in Rossini's Armida and Lakmé's Bell Song. Whether or not Callas ever sang a high F-natural in performance has been open to debate. After her June 11, 1951, concert in Florence, Rock Ferris of Musical Courier said, \"Her high E's and F's are taken full voice.\"[33] Although no definite recording of Callas singing high Fs has surfaced, the presumed E-natural at the end of Rossini's Armida—a poor-quality bootleg recording of uncertain pitch—has been referred to as a high F by Italian musicologists and critics Eugenio Gara and Rodolfo Celletti.[48] Callas expert Dr. Robert Seletsky, however, stated that since the finale of Armida is in the key of E, the final note could not have been an F, as it would have been dissonant. Author Eve Ruggieri has referred to the penultimate note in \"Mercè, dilette amiche\" from the 1951 Florence performances of I vespri siciliani as a high F;[57] however, this claim is refuted by John Ardoin's review of the live recording of the performance as well as by the review of the recording in Opera News, both of which refer to the note as a high E-natural.[36][page needed][49] In a 1969 French television interview with Pierre Desgraupes on the program L'invitée du dimanche, Francesco Siciliani [it] speaks of Callas' voice going to high F (he also talked about her lower register extending to C3), but within the same program, Callas' teacher, Elvira de Hidalgo, speaks of the voice soaring to a high E-natural but does not mention a high F. Callas remained silent on the subject, neither confirming nor denying either claim.[27] Callas' voice was noted for its three distinct registers: Her low or chest register was extremely dark and powerful, and she used this part of her voice for dramatic effect, often going into this register much higher on the scale than most sopranos.[47][48] Her middle register had a peculiar and highly personal sound—\"part oboe, part clarinet\", as Claudia Cassidy described it[31][page needed]—and was noted for its veiled or \"bottled\" sound, as if she were singing into a jug.[47] Walter Legge, husband of diva Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, attributed this sound to the \"extraordinary formation of her upper palate, shaped like a Gothic arch, not the Romanesque arch of the normal mouth\".[47] The upper register was ample and bright, with an impressive extension above high C, which—in contrast to the light flute-like sound of the typical coloratura, \"she would attack these notes with more vehemence and power—quite differently therefore, from the very delicate, cautious, 'white' approach of the light sopranos.\"[48] Legge adds, \"Even in the most difficult fioriture there were no musical or technical difficulties in this part of the voice which she could not execute with astonishing, unostentatious ease. Her chromatic runs, particularly downwards, were beautifully smooth and staccatos almost unfailingly accurate, even in the trickiest intervals. There is hardly a bar in the whole range of nineteenth-century music for high soprano that seriously tested her powers.\"[47] And as she demonstrated in the finale of La sonnambula on the commercial EMI set and the live recording from Cologne, she was able to execute a diminuendo on the stratospheric high E-flat, which Scott describes as \"a feat unrivaled in the history of the gramophone.\"[21] Regarding Callas' soft singing, Celletti says, \"In these soft passages, Callas seemed to use another voice altogether, because it acquired a great sweetness. Whether in her florid singing or in her canto spianato, that is, in long held notes without ornamentation, her mezza voce could achieve such moving sweetness that the sound seemed to come from on high ... I don't know, it seemed to come from the skylight of La Scala.\"[48] This combination of size, weight, range and agility was a source of amazement to Callas' own contemporaries. One of the choristers present at her La Scala debut in I vespri siciliani recalled, \"My God! She came on stage sounding like our deepest contralto, Cloe Elmo. And before the evening was over, she took a high E-flat. And it was twice as strong as Toti Dal Monte's!\"[31][page needed] In the same vein, mezzo-soprano Giulietta Simionato said: \"The first time we sang together was in Mexico in 1950, where she sang the top E-flat in the second-act finale of Aida. I can still remember the effect of that note in the opera house—it was like a star!\"[58] For Italian soprano Renata Tebaldi, \"the most fantastic thing was the possibility for her to sing the soprano coloratura with this big voice! This was something really special. Fantastic absolutely!\"[28] Callas' vocal registers, however, were not seamlessly joined; Walter Legge writes, \"Unfortunately, it was only in quick music, particularly descending scales, that she completely mastered the art of joining the three almost incompatible voices into one unified whole, but until about 1960, she disguised those audible gear changes with cunning skill.\"[47] Rodolfo Celletti states, In certain areas of her range her voice also possessed a guttural quality. This would occur in the most delicate and troublesome areas of a soprano's voice—for instance where the lower and middle registers merge, between G and A. I would go so far as to say that here her voice had such resonances as to make one think at times of a ventriloquist ... or else the voice could sound as though it were resonating in a rubber tube. There was another troublesome spot ... between the middle and upper registers. Here, too, around the treble F and G, there was often something in the sound itself which was not quite right, as though the voice were not functioning properly.[48] As to whether these troublesome spots were due to the nature of the voice or to technical deficiencies, Celletti says: \"Even if, when passing from one register to another, Callas produced an unpleasant sound, the technique she used for these transitions was perfect.\"[48] Musicologist and critic Fedele D'Amico [it] adds, \"Callas' 'faults' were in the voice and not in the singer; they are so to speak, faults of departure but not of arrival. This is precisely Celletti's distinction between the natural quality of the voice and the technique.\"[48] In 2005, Ewa Podleś said of Callas, \"Maybe she had three voices, maybe she had three ranges, I don't know—I am a professional singer. Nothing disturbed me, nothing! I bought everything that she offered me. Why? Because all of her voices, her registers, she used how they should be used—just to tell us something!\"[59] Eugenio Gara states, \"Much has been said about her voice, and no doubt the discussion will continue. Certainly no one could in honesty deny the harsh or \"squashed\" sounds, nor the wobble on the very high notes. These and others were precisely the accusations made at the time against Pasta and Malibran, two geniuses of song (as they were then called), sublime, yet imperfect. Both were brought to trial in their day. ... Yet few singers have made history in the annals of opera as these two did.\"[48] Callas' own thoughts regarding music and singing can be found at Wikiquote. Adored by many opera enthusiasts, Callas was a controversial artist. Although Callas was the great singer often dismissed simply as an actress,[60] Callas considered herself foremost a musician, that is, the first instrument of the orchestra.\"[26] Grace Bumbry has stated, \"If I followed the musical score when [Callas] was singing, I would see every tempo marking, every dynamic marking, everything being adhered to, and at the same time, it was not antiseptic; it was something that was very beautiful and moving.\"[61] Victor de Sabata confided to Walter Legge [when?], \"If the public could understand, as we do, how deeply and utterly musical Callas is, they would be stunned\",[47] and Serafin assessed Callas' musicality as \"extraordinary, almost frightening.\"[62] Callas possessed an innate architectural sense of line-proportion[31][page needed] and an uncanny feel for timing and for what one of Callas’ colleagues described as \"a sense of the rhythm within the rhythm\".[25] Regarding Callas' technical prowess, Celletti says, \"We must not forget that she could tackle the whole gamut of ornamentation: staccato, trills, half-trills, gruppetti, scales, etc.\"[48] D'Amico adds, \"The essential virtue of Callas' technique consists of supreme mastery of an extraordinarily rich range of tone colour (that is, the fusion of dynamic range and timbre). And such mastery means total freedom of choice in its use: not being a slave to one's abilities, but rather, being able to use them at will as a means to an end.\"[48] While reviewing the many recorded versions of \"perhaps Verdi's ultimate challenge\", the aria \"D'amor sull'ali rosee\" from Il trovatore, Richard Dyer writes, Callas articulates all of the trills, and she binds them into the line more expressively than anyone else; they are not an ornament but a form of intensification. Part of the wonder in this performance is the chiaroscuro through her tone—the other side of not singing full-out all the way through. One of the vocal devices that create that chiaroscuro is a varying rate of vibrato; another is her portamento, the way she connects the voice from note to note, phrase to phrase, lifting and gliding. This is never a sloppy swoop, because its intention is as musically precise as it is in great string playing. In this aria, Callas uses more portamento, and in greater variety, than any other singer ... Callas is not creating \"effects\", as even her greatest rivals do. She sees the aria as a whole, \"as if in an aerial view\", as Sviatoslav Richter's teacher observed of his most famous pupil; simultaneously, she is on earth, standing in the courtyard of the palace of Aliaferia, floating her voice to the tower where her lover lies imprisoned.[63] In addition to her musical skills, Callas had a particular gift for language and the use of language in music.[47] In recitatives, she always knew which word to emphasize and which syllable in that word to bring out.[31][page needed] Michael Scott notes, \"If we listen attentively, we note how her perfect legato enables her to suggest by musical means even the exclamation marks and commas of the text.\"[21] Technically, not only did she have the capacity to perform the most difficult florid music effortlessly, but also she had the ability to use each ornament as an expressive device rather than for mere fireworks.[59] Soprano Martina Arroyo states, \"What interested me most was how she gave the runs and the cadenzas words. That always floored me. I always felt I heard her saying something—it was never just singing notes. That alone is an art.\"[59] Walter Legge states that, Most admirable of all her qualities, however, were her taste, elegance and deeply musical use of ornamentation in all its forms and complications, the weighting and length of every appoggiatura, the smooth incorporation of the turn in melodic lines, the accuracy and pacing of her trills, the seemingly inevitable timing of her portamentos, varying their curve with enchanting grace and meaning. There were innumerable exquisite felicities—minuscule portamentos from one note to its nearest neighbor, or over widespread intervals—and changes of color that were pure magic. In these aspects of bel canto she was supreme mistress of that art.[47] Regarding Callas' acting ability, vocal coach and music critic Ira Siff remarked, \"When I saw the final two Toscas she did in the old [Met], I felt like I was watching the actual story on which the opera had later been based.\"[64] Callas was not, however, a realistic or verismo style actress:[21] her physical acting was merely \"subsidiary to the heavy Kunst of developing the psychology of the roles under the supervision of the music, of singing the acting...Suffering, delight, humility, hubris, despair, rhapsody—all this was musically appointed, through her use of the voice flying the text upon the notes.\"[60] Seconding this opinion, verismo specialist soprano Augusta Oltrabella said, \"Despite what everyone says, [Callas] was an actress in the expression of the music, and not vice versa.\"[65][66] Matthew Gurewitsch adds, In fact the essence of her art was refinement. The term seems odd for a performer whose imagination and means of expression were so prodigious. She was eminently capable of the grand gesture; still, judging strictly from the evidence of her recordings, we know (and her few existing film clips confirm) that her power flowed not from excess but from unbroken concentration, unfaltering truth in the moment. It flowed also from irreproachable musicianship. People say that Callas would not hesitate to distort a vocal line for dramatic effect. In the throes of operatic passion plenty of singers snarl, growl, whine, and shriek. Callas was not one of them. She found all she needed in the notes.[67] Ewa Podleś likewise stated that \"It's enough to hear her, I'm positive! Because she could say everything only with her voice! I can imagine everything, I can see everything in front of my eye.\"[59] Opera director Sandro Sequi, who witnessed many Callas performances close-up, states, \"For me, she was extremely stylized and classic, yet at the same time, human—but humanity on a higher plane of existence, almost sublime. Realism was foreign to her, and that is why she was the greatest of opera singers. After all, opera is the least realistic of theater forms... She was wasted in verismo roles, even Tosca, no matter how brilliantly she could act such roles.\"[31][page needed] Scott adds, \"Early nineteenth-century opera... is not merely the antithesis of reality, it also requires highly stylized acting. Callas had the perfect face for it. Her big features matched its grandiloquence and spoke volumes from a distance.\"[21] In regard to Callas' physical acting style, Nicola Rescigno states, \"Maria had a way of even transforming her body for the exigencies of a role, which is a great triumph. In La traviata, everything would slope down; everything indicated sickness, fatigue, softness. Her arms would move as if they had no bones, like the great ballerinas. In Medea, everything was angular. She'd never make a soft gesture; even the walk she used was like a tiger's walk.\"[68] Sandro Sequi recalls, \"She was never in a hurry. Everything was very paced, proportioned, classical, precise... She was extremely powerful but extremely stylized. Her gestures were not many... I don't think she did more than 20 gestures in a performance. But she was capable of standing 10 minutes without moving a hand or finger, compelling everyone to look at her.\"[31][page needed] Edward Downes recalled Callas watching and observing her colleagues with such intensity and concentration as to make it seem that the drama was all unfolding in her head.[30] Sir Rudolf Bing similarly recalled that in Il trovatore in Chicago, \"it was Callas' quiet listening, rather than Björling's singing that made the dramatic impact... He didn't know what he was singing, but she knew.\"[69] Callas stated that, in opera, acting must be based on the music, quoting Serafin's advice to her: When one wants to find a gesture, when you want to find how to act onstage, all you have to do is listen to the music. The composer has already seen to that. If you take the trouble to really listen with your Soul and with your Ears—and I say 'Soul' and 'Ears' because the Mind must work, but not too much also—you will find every gesture there.[29] Callas' most distinguishing quality was her ability to breathe life into the characters she portrayed,[31][page needed] or in the words of Matthew Gurewitsch, \"Most mysterious among her many gifts, Callas had the genius to translate the minute particulars of a life into tone of voice.\"[67] Italian critic Eugenio Gara adds: Her secret is in her ability to transfer to the musical plane the suffering of the character she plays, the nostalgic longing for lost happiness, the anxious fluctuation between hope and despair, between pride and supplication, between irony and generosity, which in the end dissolve into a superhuman inner pain. The most diverse and opposite of sentiments, cruel deceptions, ambitious desires, burning tenderness, grievous sacrifices, all the torments of the heart, acquire in her singing that mysterious truth, I would like to say, that psychological sonority, which is the primary attraction of opera.[48] Ethan Mordden writes, \"It was a flawed voice. But then Callas sought to capture in her singing not just beauty but a whole humanity, and within her system, the flaws feed the feeling, the sour plangency and the strident defiance becoming aspects of the canto. They were literally defects of her voice; she bent them into advantages of her singing.\"[60] Giulini believes, \"If melodrama is the ideal unity of the trilogy of words, music, and action, it is impossible to imagine an artist in whom these three elements were more together than Callas.\"[21] He recalls that during Callas' performances of La traviata, \"reality was onstage. What stood behind me, the audience, auditorium, La Scala itself, seemed artifice. Only that which transpired on stage was truth, life itself.\"[31][page needed] Sir Rudolf Bing expressed similar sentiments: Once one heard and saw Maria Callas—one can't really distinguish it—in a part, it was very hard to enjoy any other artist, no matter how great, afterwards, because she imbued every part she sang and acted with such incredible personality and life. One move of her hand was more than another artist could do in a whole act.[28] To Antonino Votto, Callas was: The last great artist. When you think this woman was nearly blind, and often sang standing a good 150 feet from the podium. But her sensitivity! Even if she could not see, she sensed the music and always came in exactly with my downbeat. When we rehearsed, she was so precise, already note-perfect... She was not just a singer, but a complete artist. It's foolish to discuss her as a voice. She must be viewed totally—as a complex of music, drama, movement. There is no one like her today. She was an esthetic phenomenon.[31][page needed] During the early 1950s, an alleged rivalry arose between Callas and Renata Tebaldi, an Italian lyrico spinto soprano.[31][page needed] The contrast between Callas' often unconventional vocal qualities and Tebaldi's classically beautiful sound resurrected a debate, namely, beauty of sound versus the expressive use of sound.[31][page needed][48] In 1951, Tebaldi and Maria Callas were jointly booked for a vocal recital in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Although the singers agreed that neither would perform encores, Tebaldi took two, and Callas was reportedly incensed.[70] This incident began the rivalry, which reached a fever pitch in the mid-1950s, at times even engulfing the two women themselves, who were said by their more fanatical followers to have engaged in verbal barbs in each other's direction. Tebaldi was quoted as saying, \"I have one thing that Callas doesn't have: a heart\",[13] and Callas was quoted in Time magazine as saying that comparing her with Tebaldi was like \"comparing Champagne with Cognac...No...with Coca Cola\".[71] However, witnesses to the interview stated that Callas had said only \"champagne with cognac\", and that it was a bystander who had quipped: \"...No...with Coca-Cola.\" Nevertheless, the Time reporter attributed the latter comment to Callas.[13] According to John Ardoin, these two singers never should have been compared.[31][page needed] Tebaldi was trained by Carmen Melis, a noted verismo specialist, and she was rooted in the early 20th century Italian school of singing just as firmly as Callas was rooted in 19th century bel canto.[31][page needed] Callas was a dramatic soprano, whereas Tebaldi was considered essentially a lyric soprano. Callas and Tebaldi generally sang a different repertoire: In the early years of her career, Callas concentrated on the heavy dramatic soprano roles and later in her career on the bel canto repertoire, whereas Tebaldi concentrated on late Verdi and verismo roles, where her limited upper extension[48] and her lack of a florid technique were not issues.[31][page needed] They shared a few roles, including Tosca in Puccini's opera and La Gioconda, which Tebaldi performed only late in her career.[citation needed] The alleged rivalry aside, Callas made remarks appreciative of Tebaldi, and vice versa. During an interview with Norman Ross Jr. in Chicago, Callas said, \"I admire Tebaldi's tone; it's beautiful—also some beautiful phrasing. Sometimes, I actually wish I had her voice.\" Francis Robinson of the Met wrote of an incident in which Tebaldi asked him to recommend a recording of La Gioconda in order to help her learn the role. Being fully aware of the alleged rivalry, he recommended Zinka Milanov's version. A few days later, he went to visit Tebaldi, only to find her sitting by the speakers, listening intently to Callas' recording. She then looked up at him and asked, \"Why didn't you tell me Maria's was the best?\"[72] Callas visited Tebaldi after a performance of Adriana Lecouvreur at the Met in 1968, and the two were reunited. In 1978, Tebaldi spoke warmly of her late colleague and summarized this rivalry: This rivality [sic] was really building from the people of the newspapers and the fans. But I think it was very good for both of us, because the publicity was so big and it created a very big interest about me and Maria and was very good in the end. But I don't know why they put this kind of rivality [sic], because the voice was very different. She was really something unusual. And I remember that I was very young artist too, and I stayed near the radio every time that I know that there was something on radio by Maria.[28] In the opinion of several singers, the heavy roles undertaken in her early years damaged Callas' voice.[65] The mezzo-soprano Giulietta Simionato, Callas' close friend and frequent colleague, stated that she told Callas that she felt that the early heavy roles led to a weakness in the diaphragm and subsequent difficulty in controlling the upper register.[73] Louise Caselotti, who worked with Callas in 1946 and 1947, prior to her Italian debut, felt that it was not the heavy roles that hurt Callas' voice, but the lighter ones.[25] Several singers have suggested that Callas' heavy use of the chest voice led to stridency and unsteadiness with the high notes.[65] In his book, Callas' husband Meneghini wrote that Callas suffered an unusually early onset of menopause, which could have affected her voice. Soprano Carol Neblett once said, \"A woman sings with her ovaries—you're only as good as your hormones.\"[60] Critic Henry Pleasants has stated that it was a loss of physical strength and breath-support that led to Callas' vocal problems, saying, Singing, and especially opera singing, requires physical strength. Without it, the singer's respiratory functions can no longer support the steady emissions of breath essential to sustaining the production of focused tone. The breath escapes, but it is no longer the power behind the tone, or is only partially and intermittently. The result is a breathy sound—tolerable but hardly beautiful—when the singer sings lightly, and a voice spread and squally when under pressure.[74] In the same vein, Joan Sutherland, who heard Callas throughout the 1950s, said in a BBC interview, [Hearing Callas in Norma in 1952] was a shock, a wonderful shock. You just got shivers up and down the spine. It was a bigger sound in those earlier performances, before she lost weight. I think she tried very hard to recreate the sort of \"fatness\" of the sound which she had when she was as fat as she was. But when she lost the weight, she couldn't seem to sustain the great sound that she had made, and the body seemed to be too frail to support that sound that she was making. Oh, but it was oh so exciting. It was thrilling. I don't think that anyone who heard Callas after 1955 really heard the Callas voice.[75] Michael Scott has proposed that Callas' loss of strength and breath support was directly caused by her rapid and progressive weight loss,[21] something that was noted even in her prime. Of her 1958 recital in Chicago, Robert Detmer wrote, \"There were sounds fearfully uncontrolled, forced beyond the too-slim singer's present capacity to support or sustain.\"[33] Photos and videos of Callas during her heavy era show a very upright posture with the shoulders relaxed and held back. Of a television broadcast from May 1960 of a recital in Hamburg, The Opera Quarterly noted, \"[W]e [can] watch ... the constantly sinking, depressed chest and hear the resulting deterioration\".[76] This continual change in posture has been cited as visual proof of a progressive loss of breath support.[21][59] Commercial and bootleg recordings of Callas from the late 1940s to 1953—the period during which she sang the heaviest dramatic soprano roles—show no decline in the fabric of the voice, no loss in volume and no unsteadiness or shrinkage in the upper register.[36][page needed] Of her December 1952 Lady Macbeth—coming after five years of singing the most strenuous dramatic soprano repertoire—Peter Dragadze wrote for Opera, \"Callas' voice since last season has improved a great deal, the second passagio on the high B-natural and C has now completely cleared, giving her an equally colored scale from top to bottom.\"[31][page needed] And of her performance of Medea a year later, John Ardoin writes, \"The performance displays Callas in as secure and free a voice as she will be found at any point in her career. The many top B's have a brilliant ring, and she handles the treacherous tessitura like an eager thoroughbred.\"[36][page needed] In recordings from 1954 (immediately after her 80-pound or 36-kilogram weight loss) and thereafter, \"not only would the instrument lose its warmth and become thin and acidulous, but the altitudinous passages would to her no longer come easily.\"[21] It was at this time that unsteady top notes first begin to appear.[36][page needed] Walter Legge, who produced nearly all of Callas' EMI/Angel recordings, states that Callas \"ran into a patch of vocal difficulties as early as 1954\": during the recording of La forza del destino, done immediately after the weight loss, the \"wobble had become so pronounced\" that he told Callas they \"would have to give away seasickness pills with every side\".[47] There were others, however, who felt that the voice had benefitted from the weight loss. Of her performance of Norma in Chicago in 1954, Claudia Cassidy wrote that \"there is a slight unsteadiness in some of the sustained upper notes, but to me her voice is more beautiful in color, more even through the range, than it used to be\".[33] And at her performance of the same opera in London in 1957 (her first performance at Covent Garden after the weight loss), critics again felt her voice had changed for the better, that it had now supposedly become a more precise instrument, with a new focus.[33] Many of her most critically acclaimed appearances are from 1954–58 (Norma, La traviata, Sonnambula and Lucia of 1955, Anna Bolena of 1957, Medea of 1958, among others). Callas' close friend and colleague Tito Gobbi thought that her vocal problems all stemmed from her state of mind: I don't think anything happened to her voice. I think she only lost confidence. She was at the top of a career that a human being could desire, and she felt enormous responsibility. She was obliged to give her best every night, and maybe she felt she wasn't [able] any more, and she lost confidence. I think this was the beginning of the end of this career.[28] In support of Gobbi's assertion, a bootleg recording of Callas rehearsing Beethoven's aria \"Ah! perfido\" and parts of Verdi's La forza del destino shortly before her death shows her voice to be in much better shape than much of her 1960s recordings and far healthier than the 1970s concerts with Giuseppe Di Stefano.[36][page needed] Soprano Renée Fleming posited that videos of Callas in the late 1950s and early 1960s reveal a posture that betrays breath-support problems: I have a theory about what caused her vocal decline, but it's more from watching her sing than from listening. I really think it was her weight loss that was so dramatic and so quick. It's not the weight loss per se—you know, Deborah Voigt has lost a lot of weight and still sounds glorious. But if one uses the weight for support, and then it's suddenly gone and one doesn't develop another musculature for support, it can be very hard on the voice. And you can't estimate the toll that emotional turmoil will take as well. I was told, by somebody who knew her well, that the way Callas held her arms to her solar plexus [allowed her] to push and create some kind of support. If she were a Soubrette, it would never have been an issue. But she was singing the most difficult repertoire, the stuff that requires the most stamina, the most strength.[59] However, writing about dramatic soprano Deborah Voigt in 2006 shortly after her 135-pound (60 kg) weight loss after gastric bypass surgery, music critic Peter G. Davis brings up comparisons with Callas and notes an increasing acidity and thinning in Voigt's voice that recall the changes in Callas' voice after her weight loss: A change has also come over Voigt's voice lately, though it's hard to tell if it's from weight loss or normal aging—controversy still rages over whether Maria Callas' drastic diets contributed to her rapid vocal decline. Not that Voigt as yet exhibits any of Callas' technical problems: Her voice continues to be reliably supported and under control. What is noticeable, however—earlier this season in Verdi's La Forza del Destino and now in Tosca—is a marked thinning of quality at the very center of the instrument, together with a slight acidity and tightening of the tone that has definitely taken the youthful bloom off, especially at the top.[77] Voigt explained how her dramatic weight loss affected her breathing and breath support: Much of what I did with my weight was very natural, vocally. Now I've got a different body—there's not as much of me around. My diaphragm function, the way my throat feels, is not compromised in any way. But I do have to think about it more now. I have to remind myself to keep my ribs open. I have to remind myself, if my breath starts to stack. When I took a breath before, the weight would kick in and give it that extra whhoomf! Now it doesn't do that. If I don't remember to get rid of the old air and re-engage the muscles, the breath starts stacking, and that's when you can't get your phrase, you crack high notes.[78] Callas attributed her problems to a loss of confidence brought about by a loss of breath support, even though she does not make the connection between her weight and her breath support. In an April 1977 interview with journalist Philippe Caloni [fr], she stated, My best recordings were made when I was skinny, and I say skinny, not slim, because I worked a lot and couldn't gain weight back; I became even too skinny ... I had my greatest successes — Lucia, Sonnambula, Medea, Anna Bolena — when I was skinny as a nail. Even for my first time here in Paris in 1958 when the show was broadcast through Eurovision, I was skinny. Really skinny.\"[79] And shortly before her death, Callas confided her own thoughts on her vocal problems to Peter Dragadze: I never lost my voice, but I lost strength in my diaphragm. ... Because of those organic complaints, I lost my courage and boldness. My vocal cords were and still are in excellent condition, but my 'sound boxes' have not been working well even though I have been to all the doctors. The result was that I overstrained my voice, and that caused it to wobble. (Gente, October 1, 1977)[25] Whether Callas' vocal decline was due to ill health, early menopause, over-use and abuse of her voice, loss of breath-support, loss of confidence, or weight loss will continue to be debated. Whatever the cause may have been, her singing career was effectively over by age 40, and even at the time of her death at age 53, according to Walter Legge, \"she ought still to have been singing magnificently\".[47] A 2010 study by Italian vocal researchers Franco Fussi and Nico Paolillo revealed Callas was very ill at the time of her death and her illness was related to her vocal deterioration. According to their findings, presented at the University of Bologna in 2010, Callas had dermatomyositis, a rare, connective tissue disease that causes a failure of the muscles and ligaments, including the larynx. They believe she was showing signs of this disease as early as the 1960s. Fussi and Paolillo cite an initial report by physician Mario Giacovazzo, who in 2002 revealed he had diagnosed Callas with dermatomyositis in 1975. Treatment included corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents, which affect heart function.[citation needed] At an event hosted by the journal Il Saggiatore Musicale, Fussi and Paolillo presented documentation showing when and how her voice changed over time. Using modern audio technology, they analyzed live Callas studio recordings from the 1950s through the 1970s, looking for signs of deterioration. Spectrographic analysis showed that she was losing the top half of her range. Fussi observed video recordings in which Callas' posture seemed strained and weakened. He felt that her drastic weight loss in 1954 further contributed to reduced physical support of her voice.[citation needed] Fussi and Paolillo also examined restored footage of the infamous 1958 Norma \"walkout\" in Rome, which led to harsh criticism of Callas as a temperamental superstar. By applying spectrographic analysis to that footage, the researchers observed her voice was tired and she lacked control and that she had bronchitis and tracheitis as she claimed, and that the dermatomyositis was already causing her muscles to deteriorate.[80] The latter half of Callas' career was marked by a number of scandals. Following a performance of Madama Butterfly in Chicago in 1955, Callas was confronted by a process server who handed her papers about a lawsuit brought by Eddy Bagarozy, who claimed he was her agent. Callas was photographed with her mouth turned in a furious snarl.[81] The photo was sent around the world and gave rise to the myth of Callas as a temperamental prima donna and a \"Tigress\". In 1956, just before her debut at the Metropolitan Opera, Time ran a damaging cover story about Callas, with special attention paid to her difficult relationship with her mother and some unpleasant exchanges between the two.[16][82][24] In 1957, Callas was starring as Amina in La sonnambula at the Edinburgh International Festival with the forces of La Scala. Her contract was for four performances, but due to the great success of the series, La Scala decided to put on a fifth performance. Callas told the La Scala officials that she was physically exhausted and that she had already committed to a previous engagement, a party thrown for her by her friend Elsa Maxwell in Venice. Despite this, La Scala announced a fifth performance, with Callas billed as Amina. Callas refused to stay and went on to Venice. Despite the fact that she had fulfilled her contract, she was accused of walking out on La Scala and the festival. La Scala officials did not defend Callas or inform the press that the additional performance was not approved by Callas. Renata Scotto took over the part, which was the start of her international career.[citation needed] In January 1958, Callas was to open the Rome Opera House season with Norma, with Italy's president, Giovanni Gronchi, in attendance. The day before the opening night, Callas alerted the management that she was not well and that they should have a standby ready. She was told \"No one can double Callas\".[28] After being treated by doctors, she felt better on the day of performance and decided to go ahead with the opera.[21] A surviving bootleg recording of the first act reveals Callas sounding ill.[36]: 133 Feeling that her voice was slipping away, she felt that she could not complete the performance, and consequently, she cancelled after the first act. She was accused of walking out on the president of Italy in a fit of temperament, and pandemonium broke out. Doctors confirmed that Callas had bronchitis and tracheitis, and the President's wife called to tell her they knew she was sick. However, they made no statements to the media, and the endless stream of press coverage aggravated the situation.[31][page needed] A newsreel included file footage of Callas from 1955 sounding well, intimating the footage was of rehearsals for the Rome Norma, with the voiceover narration, \"Here she is in rehearsal, sounding perfectly healthy\", followed by \"If you want to hear Callas, don't get all dressed up. Just go to a rehearsal; she usually stays to the end of those.\"[83] Callas' relationship with La Scala had also started to become strained after the Edinburgh incident, and this effectively severed her major ties with her artistic home. Later in 1958, Callas and Rudolf Bing were in discussion about her season at the Met. She was scheduled to perform in Verdi's La traviata and in Macbeth, two very different operas which almost require totally different singers. Callas and the Met could not reach an agreement, and before the opening of Medea in Dallas, Bing sent a telegram to Callas terminating her contract. Headlines of \"Bing Fires Callas\" appeared in newspapers around the world.[13] Nicola Rescigno later recalled, \"That night, she came to the theater, looking like an empress: she wore an ermine thing that draped to the floor, and she had every piece of jewellery she ever owned. And she said, 'You all know what's happened. Tonight, for me, is a very difficult night, and I will need the help of every one of you.' Well, she proceeded to give a performance [of Medea] that was historical.\"[32] Bing later said that Callas was the most difficult artist he ever worked with, \"because she was so much more intelligent. Other artists, you could get around. But Callas you could not get around. She knew exactly what she wanted, and why she wanted it.\"[28] Despite this, Bing's admiration for Callas never wavered, and in September 1959, he sneaked into La Scala in order to listen to Callas record La Gioconda for EMI.[13] Callas and Bing reconciled in the mid 1960s, and Callas returned to the Met for two performances of Tosca with her friend Tito Gobbi. In her final years as a singer, she sang in Medea and Norma, and Tosca in Paris, New York, and London from January–February 1964. Her last stage performance was July 5, 1965, at Covent Garden. A live television transmission of act 2 of the Covent Garden Tosca of 1964 was broadcast in Britain on February 9, 1964, giving a rare view of Callas in performance and of her on-stage collaboration with Tito Gobbi. In 1969, the Italian filmmaker Pier Paolo Pasolini cast Callas in her only non-operatic acting role, as the Greek mythological character of Medea, in his film by that name. The production was grueling, and according to the account in Ardoin's Callas, the Art and the Life, Callas is said to have fainted after a day of strenuous running back and forth on a mudflat in the sun. The film was not a commercial success, but as Callas' only film appearance, it documents something of her stage presence. From October 1971 to March 1972, Callas gave a series of master classes at the Juilliard School in New York. These classes later formed the basis of Terrence McNally's 1995 play Master Class. Callas staged a series of joint recitals in Europe in 1973 and in the U.S., South Korea, and Japan in 1974 with the tenor Giuseppe Di Stefano. Critically, this was a musical disaster owing to both performers' worn-out voices.[13] However, the tour was an enormous popular success. Audiences thronged to hear the two performers, who had so often appeared together in their prime. Her final public performance was on November 11, 1974, in Sapporo, Japan. Callas and Di Stafano were to have appeared together in four staged performances of Tosca in Japan in late 1975 but Callas cancelled.[84] In 1957, while still married to husband Giovanni Battista Meneghini, Callas was introduced to Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis at a party given in her honor by Elsa Maxwell after a performance in Donizetti's Anna Bolena.[21] The affair that followed received much publicity in the popular press, and in November 1959, Callas left her husband. Michael Scott asserts that Onassis was not sure why Callas largely abandoned her career, but that he offered her a way out of a career that was made increasingly difficult by scandals and by vocal resources that were diminishing at an alarming rate.[21] Franco Zeffirelli, on the other hand, recalls asking Callas in 1963 why she had not practiced her singing, and Callas responding that \"I have been trying to fulfill my life as a woman.\"[28] According to one of her biographers, Nicholas Gage, Callas and Onassis had a child, a boy, who died hours after he was born on March 30, 1960.[85] In his book about his wife, Meneghini states categorically that Maria Callas was unable to bear children.[86] Various sources also dismiss Gage's claim, as they note that the birth certificates Gage used to prove this \"secret child\" were issued in 1998, twenty-one years after Callas' death.[87] Still other sources claim that Callas had at least one abortion while involved with Onassis.[88] In 1966, Callas renounced her U.S. citizenship at the American Embassy in Paris, to facilitate the end of her marriage to Meneghini.[25][89] This was because after her renunciation, she was only a Greek citizen, and under Greek law of that time, a Greek could legally marry only in a Greek Orthodox church. As she had married in a Roman Catholic church, this divorced her in Greece. The renunciation also helped her finances, as she no longer had to pay U.S. taxes on her income. Her relationship with Onassis ended two years later in 1968, when he left Callas for Jacqueline Kennedy. However, the Onassis family's private secretary Kiki writes in her memoir that even while Aristotle was with Jackie, he frequently met with Maria in Paris, where they resumed what had now become a clandestine affair.[85] Callas spent her last years living largely in isolation in Paris and died of a heart attack at age 53 on September 16, 1977.[90] A funerary liturgy was held at St Stephen's Greek Orthodox Cathedral on rue Georges-Bizet, Paris on September 20, 1977. She was later cremated at the Père Lachaise Cemetery and her ashes were placed in the columbarium there. After being stolen and later recovered, they were scattered over the Aegean Sea, off the coast of Greece, according to her wish, in the spring of 1979.[91] During a 1978 interview, upon being asked \"Was it worth it to Maria Callas? She was a lonely, unhappy, often difficult woman\", music critic and Callas' friend John Ardoin replied: That's such a difficult question. There are times, you know, when there are people – certain people who are blessed, and cursed, with an extraordinary gift, in which the gift is almost greater than the human being. And Callas was one of these people. It was almost as if her wishes, her life, her own happiness were all subservient to this incredible, incredible gift that she was given, this gift that reached out and taught us all – taught us things about music we knew very well, but showed us new things, things we never thought about, new possibilities. I think that's why singers admire her so; I think that's why conductors admire her so; I know that's why I admire her so. And she paid a tremendously difficult and expensive price for this career. I don't think she always understood what she did or why she did. She knew she had a tremendous effect on audiences and on people. But it was not something that she could always live with gracefully or happily. I once said to her, \"It must be very enviable to be Maria Callas.\" And she said, \"No, it's a very terrible thing to be Maria Callas, because it's a question of trying to understand something you can never really understand.\" Because she couldn't explain what she did – it was all done by instinct; it was something, incredibly, embedded deep within her.[92][68] According to several Callas biographers, Vasso Devetzi, a Greek pianist near the same age as Callas, insinuated herself into Callas' trust during her last years and acted virtually as her agent.[93][94][95][96] This claim is corroborated by Iakintha (Jackie) Callas in her 1990 book Sisters, wherein she asserts that Devetzi conned Maria out of control of half of her estate while promising to establish the Maria Callas Foundation to provide scholarships for young singers; after hundreds of thousands of dollars had allegedly vanished, Devetzi finally did establish the foundation.[97] Callas' stage repertoire included the following roles:[133] All recordings are in mono unless otherwise indicated. Live performances are typically available on multiple labels. In 2014, Warner Classics (formerly EMI Classics) released the Maria Callas Remastered Edition, consisting of her complete studio recordings totaling 39 albums in a boxed set remastered at Abbey Road Studios in 24-bit/96 kHz digital sound from original master tapes.

                "content": "Greek soprano, Maria Callas, (born New York, 2 December 1923; died Paris, 16 September 1977) was one of the most iconic opera singers of the 20th century. She enjoyed unequalled artistic pre-eminence, musical instincts and intelligence; especially in the core 19th-century Italian opera (from Rossini to Puccini) in which she excelled. Callas possessed a natural authority on stage. Her voice – at least for a decade in the 1950s – was impressive albeit individual in quality. Vocally, she was agile. She was able to deliver a wide range of vocal colours depending on the mood or type of music she was singing. Continue reading as we delve into the often colourful life of Maria Callas; explore some of her most famous songs and stage roles and consider her legacy. In this section, we’ll look at Maria Callas’s upbringing during wartime Greece, her career highlights – including high-profile performances in both Europe and America, and her incredible 1965 performance in the title role of Tosca – and her legacy and personal life off-stage. Though American by birth (her Greek parents had emigrated to the USA in the year of Maria’s birth), Callas left the USA for Athens in 1937 (aged 13) when her mother became fed up with her husband’s cheating. In Greece, the young Maria Callas began her musical education at the age of 13. Her first vocal training was undertaken by Maria Trivella at the Greek National Conservatory. Callas’s then lower contralto voice raised and lightened to that of a soprano. Learn about opera voice types Video Video Video Callas launched her post-war career by singing Ponchielli’s La Gioconda in Verona under leading Italian conductor, Tullio Serafin. She was soon in demand all over Italy, often singing “heavier” soprano roles such as Verdi’s Aida and Wagner’s (Tristan and Isolde), Kundry (Parsifal) and even Brünnhilde from The Valkyrie. Serafin became a mentor to her, and he steered her away from heavier roles towards earlier, lighter-voiced Italian works. These included Bellini (I Puritani and Norma), Donizetti (Lucia di Lammermoor and Anna Bolena), Verdi’s Violetta (La traviata) and Leonora (Il trovatore), Desdemona (Otello) which includes the beautiful “Ave Maria” from Act 4 and Gilda (Rigoletto), and Puccini’s Tosca, Madame Butterfly and Gianni Schicchi which includes the famous aria “O mio babbino caro”. Callas also performed many rare and challenging ‘bel canto’ operas including Gluck’s Alceste, Cherubini’s Médée and Spontini’s La vestale. Video She made triumphant appearances at the world’s most notable opera houses throughout the 1950s. She sung at La Scala, Milan; Covent Garden, London; the Lyric Theatre of Chicago; and the Metropolitan Opera, New York. Her high-profile appearances were not without their own dramas off-stage. Callas fell out spectacularly with the Met Opera’s General Manager, Rudolf Bing. She alsohad well-known rivalry with the other leading international soprano of the period, Renata Tebaldi. Always her own fiercest critic, her exacting high standards and stringent demands on herself sometimes meant she would prefer to withdraw from an engagement, rather than sing below par and disappoint her public – despite any contractual consequences. Video Even in the 1950s, when Callas was at the height of her career and commanded the highest fees, vocal problems were becoming evident. These included an unevenness in her vocal registers and a pronounced tremolo on high notes. Some have argued that a noticeable loss of weight around 1953/54 were the cause of these vocal difficulties, or that her training was inadequate. Video To be sure, there were problems. But anyone who listens to two of Maria Callas’s greatest roles – ‘Casta diva’ from Bellini’s Norma and Tosca from 1965 (the only existing footage of a Callas role) – cannot fail to be moved by the expressive power of her acting and singing in combination. Video In the 1960s, Callas withdrew from the operatic stage more and more, probably because of the problems with her voice, but also because of changes in her personal life. She made her final operatic appearances in July 1965, in Tosca at Covent Garden. She was only 41 years old, an age when most sopranos are at their peak. Video In the late 1950s, Maria Callas began an affair with the Greek shipping magnate, Aristotle Onassis, while she was still married to her husband, Giovanni Battista Meneghini. This affair relationship received much publicity at the time, and even after Onassis married Jacqueline Kennedy (widow of President John F. Kennedy) he continued to meet frequently with Callas. It has been argued that Callas saw the affair with Onassis, which she might have hoped lead to marriage, as a way out of a career in crisis. Video After Onassis abandoned her for good, Callas attempted to revive her career by giving masterclasses at the Juilliard School in New York. She also embarked on an international series of joint recitals in 1973/4 with Giuseppe di Stefano, the tenor with whom she had performed often in her heyday. These sold-out recitals were artistically flawed – both singers were past their sell-by-date – however, they proved hugely popular with the public, who had never forgotten the Callas magic. After the final recital in November 1974, Callas withdrew from public life and lived alone in her Paris apartment, seeing virtually no one. Video In September 1977, she suffered a heart attack which was her unfortunate cause of death. Her remains were cremated, and her ashes placed in the Père Lachaise Cemetery. After being stolen and later recovered, her ashes were scattered over the Aegean Sea, according to her wish, in the spring of 1979. Even from beyond the grave, Maria Callas seemed to be playing out a drama worthy of the operatic stage. Over a century on from her birth, the fascination with Maria Callas as an artist and as a woman shows no sign of abating. She has been the subject of biographies and film documentaries, including ‘Maria by Callas’ (2018) directed by Tom Volf and ‘Maria’ (2024) directed by Pablo Larraín, her many recordings (official and pirated) sell in vast numbers, and she is the focus of stage plays and operatic events such as Marina Abramović’s 7 Deaths of Maria Callas, which played in the UK for the first time as part of the English National Opera’s 2023/24 Season.

                "content": "Maria Callas (December 3, 1923 – September 16, 1977) was a Greek soprano. She was one of the most famous and most controversial opera singers of the 20th century. She had a very distinctive voice of great range, power and agility enabling her to sing a wide variety of roles and was a singer-actress of great dramatic intensity. She was dubbed La Divina (The Divine One) by her admirers. She was mainly associated with the Italian repertoire, particularly Bellini's Norma, Donizetti's Lucia di Lammermoor, Verdi's La traviata and Puccini's Tosca. Maria was born Maria Kalogeroupoulou at Terence Cardinal Cooke Health Care Center in New York City, to Greek parents, she returned to Greece in 1937, with her mother and older sister. There, she studied singing with Elvira de Hidalgo, and made her debut while still a teenager with the Athens Opera in 1941. During a short return to America to visit her father in 1945, she auditioned at the Metropolitan Opera without success. Her first major break came with her Italian debut in Verona in 1947, as La Gioconda. There, she met conductor Tullio Serafin who became her mentor and guided her towards the bel canto repertoire. She sang her first Norma in Florence in 1948, and the following year, as a last minute replacement, she appeared as Elvira in Bellini's I puritani in Venice, which was to be her first great success. In 1949, she married industrialist Giovanni Battista Meneghini who became her manager. She was sometimes known as Maria Meneghini Callas after her marriage. Shortly after, she made her debut at La Scala in Milan, where the major part of her career and greatest triumphs were to take place. In collaboration with conductors like Carlo Maria Giulini, Leonard Bernstein, Gianandrea Gavazzeni, and directors like Franco Zeffirelli and Luchino Visconti, lavish productions of works such as Cherubini's Medea, Spontini's La Vestale, Bellini's La sonnambula and Norma, Donizetti's Anna Bolena and Poliuto, Verdi's La traviata and Un ballo in maschera, were made especially for her to great acclaim. She also made guest appearances at the Royal Opera House in London, the Berlin State Opera, the Paris Opéra, the Lyric Chicago Opera, the Dallas Opera and the Metropolitan Opera in New York City. In 1958, she met Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis which led to her divorce from Meneghini, and slowly began to withdraw from the stage. Her final appearance was in Tosca in London in 1965. She made a last world concert tour in 1973–74 with her often partner tenor Giuseppe Di Stefano, but by then her voice was almost gone. Callas died of a heart attack in Paris, France, at the age of 53.",

We may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back. Famed opera singer Maria Callas is the subject of a new biopic Maria﻿, now streaming on Netflix﻿, with﻿ Academy Award–winning actor Angelina Jolie portraying the late music icon. The movie received an eight-minute standing ovation after its world premiere at the Venice Film Festival this summer, not uncommon for the fest, that The Hollywood Reporter called “electric.” The movie reimagines the American-born Greek soprano’s final days in Paris in the 1970s, before her death of what was believed to be a heart attack at age 53. The highly influential opera singer was known for her coloratura vocal range and technique before becoming something of a recluse in her last years. “I take very seriously the responsibility to Maria’s life and legacy,” Jolie told The Hollywood Reporter in October 2022. Indeed, she did. Over the course of roughly seven months, Jolie worked with opera singers and coaches—including “La Divina,” herself, via recorded lectures—to perfect Callas’ presence, movement, and accent. She did sing during filming, but most of the movie’s vocals are from old recordings of Callas. Maria Callas was a legendary opera singer who performed throughout the world. The American-born Greek soprano made her professional debut as a teenager with the Royal Opera of Athens in 1941 and soon won her first major role with Tosca. Eventually garnering international acclaim, Callas became known for her signature role in Norma and her temperamental nature. During the 1960s, the quality and frequency of her performances waned, and she later transitioned to teaching. Offstage, Callas’ high-profile relationship﻿ with businessman Aristotle Onassis led to the end of her marriage. The celebrated singer spent her final years away from the spotlight and died in 1977 at age 53. FULL NAME: Sophia Cecilia Anna Maria KalogeropoulosBORN: December 2, 1923DIED: September 16, 1977BIRTHPLACE: New York, New YorkSPOUSE: Giovanni Meneghini (1949-1959)ASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Sagittarius Maria Callas was born in New York City on December 2, 1923, a date confirmed by the attending physician for the delivery and what is believed to be her birth certificate. Over the years, discrepancies and confusion have arisen concerning Callas’ birth date. Callas, herself, along with school records, had stated she was born on the 3rd while her mother had claimed the 4th. Her parents were Georgios Kalogeropoulos and Evangelia “Litsa” Dimitriadis, both Greek immigrants. Maria was their third child, following another daughter and a son who died around age 3. According to a 2001 biography by Nicholas Petsalis-Diomidis, Maria was born Sophie Cecilia Kalos and later christened Sophia Cecilia Anna Maria. This aligns with the full name listed by Maria’s estate, however other sources report Maria Cecilia Sophia Anna Kalogeropoulos. In fact, the family’s surname was Kalogeropoulos, but they took to using Kalos and later Callas, which was easier for English speakers to pronounce. To family, the future opera singer was always Mary, but the world eventually knew her as Maria Callas. She began taking classical piano lessons when she was 7 years old only to be overshadowed by her older sister, Jackie, who was seen as beautiful and charismatic. Yet, young Maria proved adept at singing with dramatic flair, and her mother pushed her to pursue a vocal career. In 1937, when Maria was a teen, her parents separated, and she, her mother, and her sister moved back to Greece. In Athens, Maria studied voice as a soprano under opera singer Elvira de Hidalgo at the famed Athens Conservatory. As a student, Callas made her stage debut in 1939 in a school production of Cavalleria Rusticana. The conservatory honored her for her dazzling performance in the role of Santuzza. In 1941, while still a teenager, Callas made her professional debut with the Royal Opera of Athens with a modest role in Franz von Suppé’s Boccaccio. Later in the year, she took on her first major role as Tosea in Tosca, one of Giacomo Puccini’s operas. Callas largely struggled to find roles during World War II. In the mid-1940s, she moved back to New York to spend time with her father and look for work but experienced a number of rejections. After moving to Verona, Italy, she made her Italian opera debut at the Verona Arena in August 1947 in a performance of La Gioconda. Over the next few years, Callas continued to perform in Verona and Florence, Italy, to critical acclaim. She expanded to other Italian cities and went abroad for performances in Buenos Aires, Mexico City, and London. Her voice captivated audiences, though as her fame increased, Callas developed a reputation as a temperamental, demanding diva and was nicknamed “The Tigress.” Fiercely resilient, Callas said of audience members’ jeers, “Hissing from the gallery is part of the scene. It is a hazard of the battlefield. Opera is a battlefield, and it must be accepted.” Her American debut arrived in 1954 in a production of Norma at the Lyric Opera of Chicago. The performance was a triumph and was seen as a signature role. Callas continued working with the Lyric Opera and, the following year, gave three performances as Cio-Cio-San in Madama Butterfly. While she was initially only booked for two dates, they were so successful that the Lyric Opera added a third. In 1956, she had the opportunity to sing with the Metropolitan Opera in her home city of New York at last. However, she was fired in 1958 by director Rudolf Bing after a dispute over which roles Callas would agree to perform for the season. During the 1960s, the soprano’s formerly stellar singing voice was discernibly faltering. Her performances grew fewer and farther between as a result of her frequent cancellations. Although she formally retired from the stage in the early 1960s, Callas made a brief return to performing with the Metropolitan Opera mid-decade, reprising her role in Tosca on March 19, 1965. The audience roared with applause at her return, which also received critical praise. Her final operatic performance was in another production of Tosca at Covent Garden in London on July 5, 1965. Queen Mother Elizabeth was among the audience members for the show. Callas didn’t limit herself to stage performances solely. She recorded multiple albums during her career. She starred in the title role of the 1969 movie Medea, which flopped at the box office. Callas met her husband, Giovanni Meneghini, in Verona in 1947. The two married in April 1949, and Meneghini, a rich industrialist, eventually became her manager. However, the singer’s marriage began to unravel in the 1950s, and the couple parted ways at the end of the decade. The split was partially fueled by an affair Callas had been having with shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis. Their relationship continued for several years, though his 1968 marriage to former U.S. First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy caused much sadness for Callas. Nonetheless, Onassis still tried to woo the singer after his nuptials. In the early 1970s, Callas tried her hand at teaching. In ’71 and ’72, she conducted master classes at Juilliard in New York. Despite her failing health, Callas accompanied a friend on an international recital tour in 1973 to help him raise money for his ailing daughter. Following the tour, Callas moved to Paris and became a recluse. On September 16, 1977, at the age of 53, Callas died suddenly and mysteriously in her home in Paris. The cause of death is believed to have been a heart attack. Over the years, Callas’ life has been portrayed in a handful of movies, including Franco Zeffirelli’s Callas Forever (2002) and the documentary Maria by Callas (2017). In late 2023, production began on a new biopic, titled Maria, about the late opera star with actor Angelina Jolie in the lead role. “Maria Callas, the greatest opera singer of all time, undoubtedly had a most unique, beautiful and tormented life,” director Pablo Larrain said of the movie. “This is the story of her last days, a celebration depicted through memories, friends and, most importantly, her singing.” Maria premiered at the Venice Film Festival in late August 2024 to moderate praise, though Jolie is already generating Oscar buzz. The movie began streaming on Netflix December 11 after a limited theatrical run. The Biography.com staff is a team of people-obsessed and news-hungry editors with decades of collective experience.

                "content": "The Paralympic Games or Paralympics is a periodic series of international multisport events involving athletes with a range of disabilities. There are Winter and Summer Paralympic Games, which since the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, have been held shortly after the corresponding Olympic Games. All Paralympic Games are governed by the International Paralympic Committee (IPC). The Paralympics began as a small gathering of British World War II veterans in 1948. The 1960 Games in Rome drew 400 athletes with disabilities from 23 countries, as proposed by doctor Antonio Maglio. Currently it is one of the largest international sporting events: the 2020 Summer Paralympics featuring 4,520 athletes from 163 National Paralympic Committees.[1] Paralympians strive for equal treatment with non-disabled Olympic athletes, but there is a large funding gap between Olympic and Paralympic athletes.[2][circular reporting?] The Paralympic Games are organized in parallel with and in a similar way to the Olympic Games. The IOC-recognized Special Olympics World Games include athletes with intellectual disabilities (although since 1992, people with intellectual disabilities also participate in the Paralympic Games), and the Deaflympics held since 1924 are exclusive for deaf athletes.[3][4] Given the wide variety of disabilities of Para athletes, there are several categories in which they compete. The allowable disabilities are divided into ten eligible impairment types: impaired muscle power, impaired passive range of movement, limb deficiency, leg length difference, short stature, hypertonia, ataxia, athetosis, vision impairment and intellectual impairment.[5] These categories are further divided into various subcategories. Athletes with disabilities did compete at the Olympic Games prior to the advent of the Paralympics. The first athlete to do so was German-American gymnast George Eyser in 1904, who had one artificial leg. Olivér Halassy, a Hungarian amputee water polo player, competed in three successive Olympic Games, beginning in 1928.[6] Hungarian Károly Takács competed in shooting events in both the 1948 and 1952 Summer Olympics. He was a right-arm amputee and could shoot left-handed. Another athlete with a disability who appeared in the Olympics prior to the Paralympic Games was Lis Hartel, a Danish equestrian athlete who had contracted polio in 1943 and won a silver medal in the dressage event in the 1952 Summer Olympics.[7] The first organized athletic event for athletes with disabilities that coincided with the Olympic Games took place on the day of the opening of the 1948 Summer Olympics in London. The German-Jewish doctor Ludwig Guttmann, of Stoke Mandeville Hospital,[8] who had fled Nazi Germany with the help of the Council for Assisting Refugee Academics (CARA) in 1939,[9] hosted a sports competition for British World War II veteran patients with spinal cord injuries. The first games were called the 1948 International Wheelchair Games, and were intended to coincide with the 1948 Olympics.[10] Guttman's aim was to create an elite sports competition for people with disabilities that would be equivalent to the Olympic Games. The games were held at the same location each year, and in 1952 Dutch and Israeli veterans took part alongside the British, making it the first international competition of its own kind. In 1960, the 9th annual games took place outside of the UK for the first time in Rome, to coincide with the 1960 Summer Olympics which were also being held in Rome. These were to be later designated the 1st Paralympic Games.[11] These early competitions have been described as the precursors of the Paralympic Games, and Stoke Mandeville holds a similar place in the history of the Paralympic movement as Greece holds in the Olympic Games; since 2012, the Paralympic flame has incorporated a \"heritage flame\" lit at Stoke Mandeville, although it was combined with flames lit in the host country for the formal start of the torch relay. Beginning in 2024, future Paralympic torch relays will officially begin in Stoke Mandeville, as an equivalent to the Olympic flame being created in Olympia.[12][13][14] There have been several milestones in the Paralympic movement. The first official Paralympic Games, coincident with the ninth Stoke Mandeville Games but no longer open solely to war veterans, was held in Rome in 1960.[15] They were the brainchild of Antonio Maglio, a friend and follower of Guttmann and were financed almost entirely by Maglio's employer, the Workers National Accident Insurance Fund of Italy, then led by Renato Morelli, who was also Chairman of the International Social Security Association.[16] Four hundred athletes from 23 countries competed at the 1960 Games. Since 1960, the Paralympic Games have taken place in the same year as the Olympic Games.[17][18] The Games were initially open only to athletes in wheelchairs; at the 1976 Summer Games, athletes with different disabilities were included for the first time at a Summer Paralympics.[10] With the inclusion of more disability classifications the 1976 Summer Games expanded to 1,600 athletes from 40 countries.[17] The 1988 Summer Paralympics in Seoul was another milestone for the Paralympic movement. It was in Seoul that the Paralympic Summer Games were held directly after the 1988 Summer Olympics, in the same host city, and using the majority of the venues. This set a precedent that was followed in 1992, 1996 and 2000. It was eventually formalized in an agreement between the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 2001,[17][19] and was extended through 2020.[20] On March 10, 2018, the two committees further extended their contract to 2032.[21] Despite being held in the same region, the 1992 Winter Paralympics used different competition venues than those used for the Olympic Games. 1994 Winter Paralympics were the first Winter Games to use the same venues and had the same Organizing Committee as the Winter Olympics. The first Winter Paralympic Games were held in 1976 in Örnsköldsvik, Sweden. This was the first Paralympics in which multiple categories of athletes with disabilities could compete.[17] The Winter Games were celebrated every four years on the same year as their summer counterpart, just as the Olympics were. This tradition was upheld through the 1992 Games in Albertville, France; after that, beginning with the 1994 Games, the Winter Paralympics and the Winter Olympics have been held in those even-numbered years separate from the Summer Olympics. The winter games happen two years after the summer games.[17] The International Paralympic Committee is the global governing body of the Paralympic Movement. It comprises 178[22] National Paralympic Committees (NPC) and four disability-specific international sports federations.[23] The president of the IPC is Andrew Parsons. The IPC's international headquarters are in Bonn, Germany.[24] The IPC is responsible for organizing the Summer and Winter Paralympic Games. It also serves as the International Federation for nine sports (Paralympic athletics, Paralympic swimming, Paralympic archery, Paralympic powerlifting, Para-alpine skiing, Paralympic biathlon, Paralympic cross-country skiing, ice sledge hockey and Wheelchair DanceSport). This requires the IPC to supervise and coordinate the World Championships and other competitions for each of the nine sports it regulates.[25] IPC membership also includes National Paralympic Committees[22] and international sporting federations.[26] International Federations are independent sport federations recognized by the IPC as the sole representative of a Paralympic Sport. International Federations responsibilities include technical jurisdiction and guidance over the competition and training venues of their respective sports during the Paralympic Games. The IPC also recognizes media partners, certifies officials, judges, and is responsible for enforcing the bylaws of the Paralympic Charter.[27] Since its creation in 1989, IPC has a cooperative relationship with the International Olympic Committee (IOC). Delegates of the IPC are also members of the IOC and participate on IOC committees and commissions. The two governing bodies remain distinct, with separate Games, despite the close working relationship.[28] The Paralympic Games were designed to emphasize the participants' athletic achievements and not their disability. Recent games have emphasized that these games are about ability and not disability.[25] The movement has grown dramatically since its early days – for example, the number of athletes participating in the Summer Paralympic Games has increased from 400 athletes in Rome in 1960 to 4,342 athletes from 159 countries in Rio de Janeiro in 2016.[29] Both the Paralympic Summer and Winter Games are recognized on the world stage. Unlike the Olympic Games, English is the official language of the Paralympic movement. The other languages used at each Paralympic Games are the official languages of the host country or host region. Every proclamation (such as the announcement of each country during the parade of nations in the opening ceremony) is spoken in these two or more languages. Although the name was originally coined as a portmanteau combining paraplegic (due to its origins as games for people with spinal injuries) and Olympic,[30] the inclusion of other disability groups meant that this was no longer considered very accurate. The present formal explanation for the name is that it derives from the Greek preposition παρά, pará ('beside' or 'alongside') and thus refers to a competition held in parallel with the Olympic Games.[31] The Summer Games of 1988 held in Seoul was the first time the term Paralympic came into official use. \"Spirit in Motion\" is the current motto for the Paralympic movement. The current Paralympic flag is used since 2020 and contains three colours, red, blue, and green, which are the colours most widely represented in the flags of nations. The colours are each in the shape of an Agito (which is Latin for 'I move/I shake/I stir'), which is the name given to an asymmetrical crescent specially designed for the Paralympic movement. The three Agitos circle a central point, which is a symbol for the athletes congregating from all points of the globe.[32] The motto and symbol of the IPC were changed in 2003 to their current versions. The change was intended to convey the idea that Paralympians have a spirit of competition and that the IPC as an organization realizes its potential and is moving forward to achieve it. The vision of the IPC is, \"To enable Paralympic athletes to achieve sporting excellence and to inspire and excite the world.\"[33] The Paralympic anthem is \"Hymne de l'Avenir\" or \"Anthem of the Future\". It was composed by Thierry Darnis and adopted as the official anthem in March 1996.[34] As mandated by the Paralympic Charter, various elements frame the opening ceremonies of the Paralympic Games. Most of these rituals were established are the same that 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp and were shared with the Olympic Games.[35] The Opening ceremony typically starts with the hoisting of the host country's flag and a performance of its national anthem. Immediately after the welcome act and the host country anthem and hosting their flag the \"Parade of Nations\" starts with the athletes into the stadium grouped by nation. Since the 1960 Summer Paralympics, the nations enter the stadium alphabetically according to the host country's or region official language, though with the host country's athletes being the last to enter. Beginning with the 2020 Summer Paralympics, the succeeding hosts of the respective Olympic Games (summer or winter) will enter immediately before the current host in descending order. The host nation presents artistic displays of their culture and folklore. Protocolary segments are held with the speeches given, formally opening the games. After the opening declaration, the Paralympic flag enters the stadium and is hosted along with the Paralympic Anthem, aside from the host country flag, and the oaths by athletes, coaches, and judges are taken. Finally, the Paralympic flame is brought into the stadium and passed on until it reaches the final torch carrier—often a Paralympic athlete from the host nation—who lights the Paralympic flame in the stadium's cauldron.[36] The closing ceremony of the Paralympic Games takes place after all sporting events have concluded. Flag-bearers from each participating country enter, followed by the athletes who enter together, without any national distinction. The Paralympic flag is taken down. Since the 1988 Winter Paralympics, with some exceptions, the national flag of the country hosting the next Summer or Winter Paralympic Games is hoisted while the corresponding national anthem is played. The games are officially closed, and the Paralympic flame is extinguished.[37] After these compulsory elements, the next host nation briefly introduces itself with artistic displays of dance and theater representative of its culture. A medals ceremony is held after the conclusion of each Paralympic event. The winner, second and third-place competitors or teams stand on top of a three-tiered rostrum when they are awarded their respective medal by an IPC member. The national flags of the medalists are then raised while the national anthem of the gold medalist is played.[38] Volunteering citizens of the host country also act as hosts during the medal ceremonies, as they aid the officials who present the medals and act as flag-bearers.[39] For every Paralympic event, the respective medal ceremony is held, at most, one day after the event's final. In June 2001, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) signed an agreement that would ensure that the staging of the Paralympic Games is automatically included in the bid for the Olympic Games.[40] The agreement was set to take effect at the 2008 Paralympic Summer Games in Beijing and the 2010 Paralympic Winter Games in Vancouver. However, the Salt Lake 2002 Organizing Committee (SLOC) chose to follow the practice of \"one bid, one city\", with one Organizing Committee for both Games, which was followed up by the 2004 Summer Games in Athens. The agreement was adjusted in 2003. An extension was signed in June 2006, after some troubles at the 2006 Winter Paralympics.[40] Initially agreed to remain in effect until the 2012 Summer Olympics,[17] this was later extended to encompass all Summer and Winter games up until the 2020 Summer Olympics.[41][42] Even beyond this, all Summer and Winter host cities currently[update] announced are preparing pairs of Olympic and Paralympics Games. This was further confirmed when on 10 March 2018, the IOC and the IPC agreed to further extend the contract to the 2032 Summer Olympics.[21] The IOC has written its commitment to equal access to athletics for all people into its charter, which states,[43] The practice of sport is a human right. Every individual must have the possibility of practising sport, without discrimination of any kind and in the Olympic spirit, which requires mutual understanding with a spirit of friendship, solidarity and fair play....Any form of discrimination with regard to a country or a person on grounds of race, religion, politics, gender or otherwise is incompatible with belonging to the Olympic Movement. While the charter is silent on discrimination specifically related to disability; given the language in the charter regarding discrimination it is reasonable to infer that discrimination on the basis of disability would be against the ideals of the Olympic Charter and the IOC.[44] This is also consistent with the Paralympic Charter, which forbids discrimination on the basis of political, religious, economic, disability, gender, sexual orientation or racial reasons.[45] Chairman of the London organising committee, Sebastian Coe, said about the 2012 Summer Paralympics and 2012 Summer Olympics in London, England, that, \"We want to change public attitudes towards disability, celebrate the excellence of Paralympic sport and to enshrine from the very outset that the two Games are an integrated whole.\"[46] The 2014 Winter Paralympic Games is the first such Paralympics hosted by Russia. Russia ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities during that period. Notably at 2010 Vancouver, their Paralympic team topped the medal table at the Winter Paralympics, while their Olympic team performed well below expectations at the Winter Olympics. This led the media to highlight the contrast between the achievements of the country's Olympic and Paralympic delegations, despite the greater attention and funding awarded to the Olympic athletes.[47] The Russian Federation organizers of the 2014 Winter Paralympic Games have, since 2007, made efforts to make the host city Sochi more accessible.[48] In 2012, as part of its prohibition on unauthorised advertising, the Paralympic movement began requiring any tattoo of the Olympic rings to be covered during competition, on the basis that the Olympics is technically a third-party organisation. In 2024 the prohibition was ended after protests from athletes.[49] Paralympic athletes have sought equal opportunities to compete at the Olympic Games. The precedent was set by Neroli Fairhall, a Paralympic archer from New Zealand, who competed at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.[50] In 2008, Oscar Pistorius, a South African sprinter, attempted to qualify for the 2008 Summer Olympics. Pistorius had both his legs amputated below the knee and races with two carbon fibre blades manufactured by Össur. He holds the Paralympic world record in the 400 meter event.[51] Pistorius missed qualifying for the 2008 Summer Olympics in the 400 meter race, by 0.70 seconds. He qualified for the 2008 Summer Paralympics where he won gold medals in the 100, 200, and 400 meter sprints.[52] In 2011, Pistorius qualified for the 2012 Summer Olympics and competed in two events: he made the semi-final in the 400 metres race; and his team came 8th in the final of the 4 × 400 metres relay race.[53] Even though all athletes are given equal opportunities to participate in these events, such as the 400 meter race, there has been growing criticism that the games may not be fair to all athletes. For example, athletes running a race with a left prosthetic leg may be disadvantaged compared to those with a right side prosthesis because the races are run in an anticlockwise direction, giving some athletes an advantage.[54] Some athletes without a disability also compete at the Paralympics. The sighted guides for athletes with a visual impairment are such a close and essential part of the competition that the athlete with visual impairment and the guide are considered a team, and both athletes are medal candidates.[55] Starting at the 1992 Summer Paralympics, recent games have also been supported by contributions from major sponsors. Unlike the Olympics, where the IOC mandates that arenas be clean of sponsor logos, the Paralympics do allow the logos of official sponsors to be displayed inside arenas and on uniforms.[56] While the Olympic Games have experienced tremendous growth in global media coverage since the 1984 Summer Paralympics, the Paralympics had been slower to develop a consistent mainstream media presence. In June 2023, IPC executives noted that interest in the Paralympics had been improving among broadcasters, citing that it had already reached rights deals for the 2024 Summer Paralympics covering 75% of the world over a year in advance (in comparison to 2020, where many deals were made \"last minute\"), and that it had been pushing for broader coverage and increased rights fees since broadcasters were starting to \"[realize] that [the Paralympics are] actually a great sporting event\", and not treat them as a low-effort obligation bundled with their Olympics rights. Unlike the Olympics, the IPC holds the digital rights to the Paralympics in some markets, allowing it to promote live coverage and other highlights via its own social media platforms to engage online audiences.[57] Television broadcasts of Paralympic Games began in 1976, but this early coverage was confined to tape-delayed broadcasts to one nation or region. At the 1992 Summer Paralympics, there were 45 hours of live coverage but it was available only in Europe. Other countries broadcast highlight packages during the Games. No meaningful improvements in coverage occurred until the 2000 Summer Paralympics in Sydney. The 2000 Paralympics represented a significant increase in global media exposure for the Paralympic Games. A deal was reached between the Sydney Paralympic Organizing Committee (SPOC) and All Media Sports (AMS) to broadcast the Games internationally. Deals were reached with Asian, South American, and European broadcast companies to distribute coverage to as many markets as possible. The Games were also webcast for the first time. Because of these efforts, the Sydney Paralympics reached a global audience estimated at 300 million people.[58] Also significant was the fact that the organizers did not have to pay networks to televise the Games as had been done at the 1992 and 1996 Games.[59] Despite these advances, consistent media attention has been a challenge, which was evidenced in the coverage in Great Britain of the 2010 Winter Paralympics. The BBC was criticized for its minimal coverage of the 2010 Winter Paralympics as compared to its coverage of the 2010 Winter Olympics. The BBC announced it would stream some content on its website and show a one-hour highlight program after the Games ended. For the Winter Olympics the BBC aired 160 hours of coverage. The response from the BBC was that budget constraints and the \"time zone factor\" necessitated a limited broadcast schedule.[60] The reduction in coverage was done in spite of increased ratings for the 2008 Summer Paralympics, which was watched by 23% of the population of Great Britain.[60] In Norway, the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK) broadcast 30 hours of the 2010 Winter Games live. NRK-sport were critical of parts of the TV production from Vancouver, and notified the EBU of issues such as the biathlon coverage excluding the shooting, and cross-country skiing with skiers in the distance, making it hard to follow the progress of the competition. NRK were far more pleased with the production of the ice sledge hockey and wheelchair curling events, which they felt reached the same level as the Olympic Games.[61] Not all Paralympic events have received television coverage; the IPC and its organisers currently contract with the IOC's media unit Olympic Broadcasting Services (OBS) to produce the broadcast feeds for the Paralympics. At the Summer Paralympics, coverage was limited to 16 sports in 2016, but increased to 19 sports in 2020. In 2024, all 22 Summer Paralympic sports were televised for the first time.[57] In the UK, Channel 4 assumed the television rights beginning in the 2012 Summer Paralympics, promising major increases in coverage on television and digital platforms, efforts to heighten the Games' profile, and commitments to incorporate people with disabilities among its staff and presenters.[62][63] Its coverage of the Paralympics have been promoted through major marketing campaigns; several of its advertisements have won Cannes Lions awards, with its trailer for 2016 \"We're the Superhumans\" receiving an overall Grand Prix award.[64][65] In January 2020, the Paralympics were classified as a Category A \"listed\" event by the British telecom regulator Ofcom as with the Olympics, mandating that they be broadcast in whole or in part by a free-to-air network, as with the Olympics.[66] Channel 4 reported that its coverage of the 2024 Summer Paralympics was seen by a total audience of 20 million, with the channel achieving its highest viewer share since the 2012 Paralympics.[67] A 2010 study by the University of British Columbia (UBC) on the Olympic Games Impact (OGI), showed that of roughly 1,600 Canadian respondents, 41 to 50 percent believed the 2010 Paralympic and Olympic Games in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, triggered additional accessibility of buildings, sidewalks and public spaces. 23 percent of employers said the Games had increased their willingness to hire people with disabilities.[68] Chief Executive Officer for the International Paralympic Committee Xavier Gonzalez said about the 2008 Summer Paralympics in Beijing, China, that: In China, the (Paralympic) Games were really a transformation tool for changing attitudes across the board in China towards people with disability, to building accessibility facilities in the city, to changing laws to allow people with a disability to be part of society.[69] Within the framework of the International Olympic Committee's commitment to equal access to athletics, concerns have been raised regarding inclusion of athletes with Down syndrome in the Paralympic Games. While the Paralympic movement strives for inclusivity, the absence of a specific classification for athletes with Down syndrome within Paralympic swimming events raises questions about equal and fair competition for Down syndrome athletes. International Paralympic Committee Para-swimming classification codes are based upon single impairment only, whereas Down syndrome individuals have both physical and intellectual impairments. Although swimmers with Down syndrome are able to compete in the S14 intellectual impairment category (provided they score low in IQ tests), they are often outmatched by the superior physicality of their opponents.[70][71] At present there is no designated Paralympic category for swimmers with Down syndrome, meaning they have to compete as intellectually disadvantaged athletes. This disregards their physical disabilities.[72][73] A number of advocacy groups globally have been lobbying for the inclusion of a distinct classification category for Down syndrome swimmers within the IPC Classification Codes framework.[74] Initiatives aimed at promoting greater inclusivity within the Paralympic movement have emerged, including advocacy and awareness-raising efforts targeting discrimination and ensuring equal opportunities for athletes with Down syndrome.[75] Despite ongoing advocacy, the issue remains unresolved, and swimmers with Down syndrome continue to face challenges in accessing appropriate classification pathways.[76] The International Paralympic Committee (IPC) has established ten disability categories. Athletes are divided within each category according to their level of impairment, in a functional classification system which differs from sport to sport. The IPC has established ten disability categories, including physical, visual, and intellectual impairment. Athletes with one of these disabilities can compete in the Paralympics, though not every sport can allow for every disability category. These categories apply to both Summer and Winter Paralympics.[77] Physical Impairment – There are eight different types of physical impairment: Visual impairment – Athletes with visual impairment ranging from partial vision, sufficient to be judged legally blind, to total blindness. This includes impairment of one or more component of the visual system (eye structure, receptors, optic nerve pathway, and visual cortex).[77] The sighted guides for athletes with a visual impairment are such a close and essential part of the competition that the athlete with visual impairment and the guide are considered a team. Beginning in 2012, these guides along with sighted goalkeepers in 5-a-side football became eligible to receive medals of their own.[55][78] Intellectual Disability – Athletes with a significant intellectual impairment and associated limitations in adaptive behaviour. The IPC primarily serves athletes with physical disabilities, but the disability group Intellectual Disability has been added to some Paralympic Games. This includes only elite athletes with intellectual disabilities diagnosed before the age of 18.[77] However, the IOC-recognized Special Olympics World Games are open to all people with intellectual disabilities.[4] Within the disability categories, athletes are further divided into Sport Classes according to the degree of activity limitation resulting from their impairments; this aims to minimise the impact of an athlete's impairment on their sporting performance against their rivals. Sport Classes are numbered, with a lower number signifying a greater level of impairment: for example, in Paralympic swimming athletes with visual impairments compete in three Sport Classes from S/SB11 to S/SB13, with S/SB11 athletes having a very low light acuity and/or no light perception, and S/SB13 athletes having the least severe visual impairment eligible for Paralympic sport.[79] From its inception until the 1980s, the Paralympic system for classifying athletes consisted of a medical evaluation and diagnosis of impairment. An athlete's medical condition was the only factor used to determine what class they competed in. For example, an athlete who had a spinal cord injury that resulted in lower limb paresis, would not compete in the same wheelchair race as an athlete with a double above-knee amputation. The fact that their disability caused the same impairment did not factor into classification determination, the only consideration was their medical diagnosis. It was not until views on disabled athletics shifted from just a form of rehabilitation to an end in itself, that the classification system changed from medical diagnosis to a focus on the functional abilities of the athlete.[80] While there is no clear date when the shift occurred, a functional classification system became the norm for disabled athletic classification in the 1980s. In a functional system, the focus is on what effect the athlete's impairment has on his or her athletic performance. Under this system, athletes with total loss of function in their legs will compete together in most sports, because their functional loss is the same and the reason for the loss is immaterial. The only exception to the functional system is the classification format used by International Blind Sports Federation (IBSA), which still uses a medically based system.[80] Some sports are only held for certain disability types. For example, goalball is only for visually impaired athletes. The Paralympics recognizes three different grades of visual impairment, consequently all competitors in goalball must wear a visor or \"black out mask\" so that athletes with less visual impairment will not have an advantage.[81] Other sports, like athletics, are open to athletes with a wide variety of impairments. In athletics, participants are broken down into a range of classes based on the disability they have and then they are placed in a classification within that range based on their level of impairment. For example: classes 11–13 are for visually impaired athletes, which class they are in depends on their level of visual impairment.[82] There are also team competitions such as wheelchair rugby. Members of the team are each given a point value based on their activity limitation. A lower score indicates a more severe activity limitation than a higher score. A team cannot have more than a certain maximum total of points on the field of play at the same time to ensure equal competition. For example, in wheelchair rugby, the four players' combined disability number must total no more than eight points.[83] There are twenty-two sports on the Summer Paralympic program and six sports on the Winter Paralympics program. Within some of the sports are several events. For example, alpine skiing has downhill, super combined, super-G, slalom, giant slalom. The IPC has governance over several of the sports but not all of them. Other international organizations, known as International Sports Federations (IF), notably the International Wheelchair and Amputee Sports Federation (IWAS), the International Blind Sports Federation (IBSA), and the Cerebral Palsy International Sports and Recreation Association (CP-ISRA), govern some sports that are specific to certain disability groups.[84] There are national chapters for these International Sport Federations including National Paralympic Committees, which are responsible for recruitment of athletes and governance of sports at the national level.[85] After the 2000 Sydney games, a Spanish basketball player alleged that several members of the gold medal-winning Spanish basketball team with intellectual disabilities (ID) did not have disabilities. He claimed that only two athletes out of the twelve-member team met the qualifications of an athlete with an intellectual disability.[86] A controversy ensued and the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) called on the Spanish National Paralympic Committee to launch an investigation.[87] The investigation uncovered several Spanish athletes who had flouted the ID rules. In an interview with the president of the federation that oversees ID competition, Fernando Martín Vicente admitted that athletes around the world were breaking the ID eligibility rules. The IPC responded by starting an investigation of its own.[86] The results of the IPC's investigation confirmed the Spanish athlete's allegations and also determined that the incident was not isolated to the basketball ID event or to Spanish athletes.[86] As a result, all ID competitions were suspended indefinitely.[88] The ban was lifted after the 2008 Games after work had been done to tighten the criteria and controls governing admission of athletes with intellectual disabilities. Four sports, swimming, athletics, table tennis and rowing, were anticipated to hold competitions for ID athletes at the 2012 Summer Paralympics.[89][90] The Paralympics have also been tainted by steroid use. At the 2008 Games in Beijing, three powerlifters and a German basketball player were banned after having tested positive for banned substances.[89] This was a decrease in comparison to the ten powerlifters and one track athlete who were banned from the 2000 Games.[91] German skier Thomas Oelsner became the first Winter Paralympian to test positive for steroids. He had won two gold medals at the 2002 Winter Paralympics, but his medals were stripped after his positive drug test.[92] At the 2010 Winter Paralympics in Vancouver, Swedish curler Glenn Ikonen tested positive for a banned substance and was suspended for six months[93] by the IPC. He was removed from the rest of the curling competition but his team was allowed to continue. The 54-year-old curler said his doctor had prescribed a medication on the banned substances list.[94][95] Another concern now facing Paralympic officials is the technique of \"boosting\". Athletes can artificially increase their blood pressure, often by self-harming, which has been shown to improve performance by up to 15%. This is most effective in the endurance sports such as cross-country skiing. To increase blood pressure athletes will deliberately cause trauma to limbs below a spinal injury. This trauma can include breaking bones, strapping extremities in too tightly, and using high-pressure compression stockings. The injury is painless but it does affect the athlete's blood pressure.[96] Another potential concern is the use of gene therapy among Paralympic athletes. All Paralympic athletes are banned from enhancing their abilities through gene doping, but it is extremely difficult to differentiate these concepts.[97] The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) is currently researching both gene doping and gene therapy, in part to discern the boundary between the two closely related concepts.[98] The IPC have been working with WADA since 2003, to ensure compliance with WADA's anti-doping code among its Paralympic athletes.[99] The IPC has also promised to continue increasing the number of athletes tested at each of its Games, in order to further minimize the possible effect of doping in Paralympic sports.[99] Mandatory in- and out-of competition testing has also been implemented by the IPC to further ensure all of its athletes are performing in compliance with WADA regulations.[99] Having sent samples for forensic analysis, the IPC found evidence that the prevalent doping by Russian athletes was in operation at the 2014 Winter Paralympics in Sochi.[100] On 7 August 2016, the IPC's Governing Board voted unanimously to ban the entire Russian team from the 2016 Summer Paralympics, citing the Russian Paralympic Committee's inability to enforce the IPC's Anti-Doping Code and the World Anti-Doping Code which is \"a fundamental constitutional requirement\".[100] IPC President Sir Philip Craven stated that the Russian government had \"catastrophically failed its Para athletes\".[101] IPC Athletes' Council Chairperson and CPC Member Todd Nicholson said that Russia had used athletes as \"pawns\" in order to \"show global prowess\".[102] Trischa Zorn of the United States is the most decorated paralympian in history. She competed in the blind swimming events and won a total of 55 medals, 41 of which are gold. Her Paralympic career spanned 24 years from 1980 to 2004. She was also an alternate on the 1980 American Olympic swim team, but did not go to the Olympics due to a boycott by the United States and several of its allies.[103][104] Ragnhild Myklebust of Norway holds the record for the most medals ever won at the Winter Paralympic Games. Competing in a variety of events between 1988 and 2002, she won a total of 22 medals, of which 17 were gold. After winning five gold medals at the 2002 Games she retired at the age of 58.[105] Neroli Fairhall, a paraplegic archer from New Zealand, was the first paraplegic competitor, and the third Paralympian, to participate in the Olympic Games, when she competed in the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. She placed thirty-fourth in the Olympic archery competition, and won a Paralympic gold medal in the same event.[50] a Postponed to 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, marking the first time that the Paralympic Games has been postponed. They are still called the 2020 Summer Paralympics, even with the change in scheduling to one year later.[138] The Games were held from 24 August to 5 September 2021.[139]",

                "content": "Sport for athletes with an impairment has existed for more than 100 years, and the first sport clubs for the deaf were already in existence in 1888 in Berlin. It was not until after World War II however, that it was widely introduced. The purpose of it at that time was to assist the large number of war veterans and civilians who had been injured during wartime. In 1944, at the request of the British Government, Dr. Ludwig Guttmann opened a spinal injuries centre at the Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Great Britain, and in time, rehabilitation sport evolved to recreational sport and then to competitive sport. STOKE MANDEVILLE GAMES On 29 July 1948, the day of the Opening Ceremony of the London 1948 Olympic Games, Dr. Guttmann organised the first competition for wheelchair athletes which he named the Stoke Mandeville Games, a milestone in Paralympic history. They involved 16 injured servicemen and women who took part in archery. In 1952, Dutch ex-servicemen joined the Movement and the International Stoke Mandeville Games were founded. FIRST PARALYMPIC GAMES The Stoke Mandeville Games later became the Paralympic Games which first took place in Rome, Italy, in 1960 featuring 400 athletes from 23 countries. Since then they have taken place every four years. In 1976 the first Winter Games in Paralympics history were held in Sweden, and as with the Summer Games, have taken place every four years, and include a Paralympics Opening Ceremony and Paralympics Closing Ceremony. Since the Summer Games of Seoul, Korea in 1988 and the Winter Games in Albertville, France in 1992 the Games have also taken part in the same cities and venues as the Olympics due to an agreement between the IPC and IOC. GROWTH OF THE PARALYMPIC FAMILY Also in 1960, under the aegis of the World Federation of ex-servicemen, an International Working Group on Sport for the Disabled was set up to study the problems of sport for persons with an impairment. It resulted in the creation, in 1964, of the International Sport Organisation for the Disabled (ISOD) who offered opportunities for those athletes who could not affiliate to the International Stoke Mandeville Games: vision impaired, amputees, persons with cerebral palsy and paraplegics. At the start, 16 countries were affiliated to ISOD and the organisation pushed very hard to include blind and amputee athletes into the Toronto 1976 Paralympics and athletes with cerebral palsy in 1980 in Arnhem. Its aim was to embrace all impairments in the future and to act as a Co-coordinating Committee. Nevertheless, other disability-orientated international organisations such as the Cerebral Palsy International Sports and Recreation Association (CPISRA) and International Blind Sports Federation (IBSA) were founded in 1978 and 1980. The four international organisations experienced the need of co-ordinating the Games so they created the \"International Co-coordinating Committee Sports for the Disabled in the World\" (ICC) in 1982. The ICC was originally composed of the four presidents of CPISRA, IBSA, ISMGF and ISOD, the general secretaries and one additional member (in the beginning it was the Vice-President, and later on the Technical Officer). The International Committee of Sport for the Deaf (CISS) and International Sports Federations for Persons with an Intellectual Disability (INAS-FID) joined in 1986, but the deaf still maintained their own organisation. However, the member nations demanded more national and regional representation in the organisation.INTERNATIONAL PARALYMPIC COMMITTEE IS BORN Finally, on 22 September 1989, the International Paralympic Committee was founded as an international non-profit organisation in Dusseldorf, Germany, to act as the global governing body of the Paralympic Movement. The word “Paralympic” derives from the Greek preposition “para” (beside or alongside) and the word “Olympic”. Its meaning is that Paralympics are the parallel Games to the Olympics and illustrates how the two movements exist side-by-side.",

                "content": "In 1948, Sir Ludwig Guttmann organised a sports competition involving 16 World War II veterans with spinal cord-related injuries in Stoke Mandeville, England. Four years later, competitors from Holland joined, and the international movement, now known as the Paralympic Movement, was born. Olympic-style games for athletes with a disability were organised for the first time in Rome in 1960. Taking place soon after the conclusion of the Olympic Games, the Olympic-style games for athletes with a disability attracted 400 participants from 23 countries, who competed in eight sports. Taking place every four years in the same year as the Olympic Games, the Paralympic Games have since grown into one of the world’s biggest sport events, with a track record for driving social inclusion. Following the Tokyo 1964 Games, the Paralympics were held in different cities from the Olympic Games, including the first Paralympic Winter Games, which were held in Örnsköldsvik, Sweden in 1976. In the same year in Toronto, other disability groups were added and the idea of merging together different disability groups for international sports competitions was born. The two Games were held in different cities until the Seoul 1988 Summer Games and Albertville 1992 Winter Games, when the two Games once again came together, with the Paralympics taking place shortly after the Olympic Games in the same venues. On 19 June 2001, an agreement was signed between the IOC and the IPC aimed at protecting the organisation of the Paralympic Games and securing the practice of \"one bid, one city\". This means that cities looking to host the Olympic Games automatically have to include the Paralympics as part of their bid. This agreement came into effect with the Beijing 2008 Paralympic Games, followed by the Vancouver 2010 Paralympic Winter Games. Since the Salt Lake City 2002 Games, one organising committee has been responsible for hosting both the Olympic and the Paralympic Games. Athletes from both Games live in the same village and enjoy the same catering services, medical care and facilities. Ticketing, technology and transport systems for the Olympic Games are seamlessly extended to the Paralympics. Today, the Paralympic Games are the world’s third biggest sport event in terms of ticket sales; only the Olympic Games and the FIFA World Cup sell more. The Rio 2016 Paralympics attracted 4,328 athletes from 159 countries, who competed in 22 sports. An Independent Paralympic Athletes team featuring two refugee athletes also took part. The Games attracted a record cumulative TV audience of 4.1 billion people in more than 150 countries, while 2.15 million tickets were sold. Ahead of the Games, the city of Rio invested in improving infrastructure so that it was accessible for the Paralympics and future generations. This included making tourist destinations accessible for all and the development of the Bus Rapid Transport system, which enables residents and visitors of all abilities to get around the city. The Brazilian government also invested in the creation of a world-leading Paralympic Training Centre for the Brazilian Paralympic Committee in São Paulo. Providing world class facilities for 15 sports, the centre is used all year round by Brazilian athletes and National Paralympic Committees from around the world. South Korea staged record-breaking Paralympic Winter Games in March 2018. Featuring a record 567 athletes from 49 countries, the Games were viewed by cumulative TV audience of 2.02 billion – more than ever before – and a record 343,000 spectators.",

This year, we share how sports have the power to transform people’s lives. At the Paralympics, there is a story behind every athlete - whether it’s about finding their passion, winning a medal, or embracing their disability. Today, we invite you to discover the journeys of incredible Para athletes and how Change Starts With Sports. The IPC Governing Board discussed key learnings from the Paris 2024 Paralympic Games and received progress updates on future Paralympic Games editions and the IPC membership. Two months after competing at Paris 2024, five-time Paralympic champion Benjamin Daviet is looking forward to Milano Cortina 2026 The Paralympic Games are the largest global sporting event for athletes with disabilities and have taken place every four years since the inaugural edition in Rome, Italy, in 1960. In 1976, the first Winter Games were held in Ornskoldsvik, Sweden and featured 198 athletes from 16 countries. Following the 1988 Games in Seoul, Republic of Korea, and the Winter Games in Albertville, France in 1992, the Paralympic and Olympic Games have been held in the same city. The next Paralympic Games will be held in LA in 2028 followed by Brisbane in 2032. The next winter edition is Milano Cortina 2026 with the French Alps to follow in 2030 and Salt Lake City in 2034. The International Paralympic Committee (IPC) is the global governing body of the Paralympic Movement. Founded on 22 September 1989 as a non-profit organisation, we aim to be athlete-centred and membership-focussed in all our endeavours. Through partnerships with more than 200 member organisations, we leverage Para sport to advance the lives of the 1.2 billion individuals with disabilities across the globe. Sport for athletes with an impairment has existed for more than 100 years. It was not until after World War II, however, that it was widely introduced. The purpose of it at that time was to assist the large number of war veterans and civilians who had been injured during wartime. On 29 July 1948, the day of the Opening Ceremony of the London 1948 Olympic Games, Dr. Ludwig Guttmann organised a competition for wheelchair athletes at the Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Great Britain. Sixteen injured servicemen and women took part in archery at the inaugural Stoke Mandeville Games, which later became the Paralympic Games. Classification is the cornerstone of the Paralympic Movement; it determines which athletes are eligible to compete in a sport and how athletes are grouped together for competition. In Para sports, athletes are grouped by the degree of activity limitation resulting from the impairment. This, to a certain extent, is similar to grouping athletes by age, gender or weight. Classification aims to minimise the impact of the impairment on athletes' performance so that the sporting excellence determines which athlete or team is ultimately victorious. Ensuring that athletes are classified prior to competing is crucial to safeguarding the integrity and credibility of the competition. The International Paralympic Committee (IPC) recognises a total of 28 Paralympic sports. The 22 summer sports are Para archery, Para athletics, Para badminton, blind football, boccia, Para canoe, Para cycling, Para equestrian, goalball, Para judo, Para powerlifting, Para rowing, shooting Para sport, sitting volleyball, Para swimming, Para table tennis, Para taekwondo, Para triathlon, wheelchair basketball, wheelchair fencing, wheelchair rugby, and wheelchair tennis. Winter sports include Para alpine skiing, Para biathlon, Para cross-country skiing, Para ice hockey, Para snowboard, and wheelchair curling.",

                "title": "Smokey Robinson - Wikipedia",
                "content": "William \"Smokey\" Robinson Jr. (born February 19, 1940) is an American R&B and soul singer, songwriter, record producer, and former record executive. He was the founder and frontman of the pioneering Motown vocal group the Miracles, for which he was also chief songwriter and producer.[1] He led the group from its 1955 origins, when they were called The Five Chimes, until 1972, when he retired from the group to focus on his role as Motown Records vice president. Robinson returned to the music industry as a solo artist the following year. He left Motown in 1999. Robinson was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987 and awarded the 2016 Library of Congress Gershwin Prize for his lifetime contributions to popular music.[2][3] He is a double Hollywood Walk of Fame Inductee, as a solo artist (1983) and as a member of The Miracles (2009). In 2022, he was inducted into the Black Music & Entertainment Walk of Fame. William Robinson Jr. was born to an African-American father and a mother of African-American and French descent in a poor family in the North End area of Detroit, Michigan.[1] He had two maternal half-sisters, and his parents divorced when he was three years old.[4] Robinson's ancestry is also part Nigerian, Scandinavian, Portuguese, and Cherokee.[5] His uncle Claude gave him the nickname \"Smokey Joe\" when he was a child.[6] In 2012, Robinson explained: My Uncle Claude was my favorite uncle. He was also my godfather. He and I were really, really close. He used to take me to see cowboy movies all the time when I was a little boy because I loved cowboy movies. He got a cowboy name for me, which was Smokey Joe. So from the time I was three years old if people asked me what my name was I didn't tell them my name was William, I told them my name was Smokey Joe. That's what everyone called me until I was about 12 and then I dropped the Joe part. I've heard that story about him giving it to me because I'm a light skinned black man but that's not true.[7] When Robinson was 10, his mother died, and he began living with older sister, Geraldine, with her husband, who had 10 children together.[4] He attended Northern High School, where he was above average academically and a determined athlete. However, his main interest was music, and he formed a doo-wop group named the Five Chimes. He and Aretha Franklin lived several houses from each other on Belmont; he said he'd known Franklin since she was about five, overhearing her play the piano when he had come to play with her older brother Cecil after her family first moved to Detroit.[8][9] Robinson's interest in music started during childhood after he heard the groups Nolan Strong & the Diablos and Billy Ward and his Dominoes on the radio. He has cited Barrett Strong, a Detroit native, as a strong vocal influence.[citation needed] In 1955, he formed the first lineup of The Five Chimes with childhood friend Ronald White and classmate Pete Moore. Two years later, they were renamed the Matadors and included Bobby Rogers. Another member, Emerson (Sonny) Rogers, Bobby Rogers' cousin, was replaced by his sister, Claudette Rogers (who would marry Smokey Robinson in 1959). The group's guitarist, Marv Tarplin, joined them sometime in 1958. The Matadors began touring Detroit venues around this time. Eventually they changed their name to The Miracles. In August 1957, Robinson and the Miracles met songwriter Berry Gordy after a failed audition for Brunswick Records. At that time during the audition, Robinson had brought along with him a \"Big 10\" notebook with 100 songs he wrote while in high school. Gordy was impressed with Robinson's vocals and even more impressed with Robinson's ambitious songwriting.[1] With his help, the Miracles released their first single, \"Got a Job\", an answer song to the Silhouettes' hit single \"Get a Job\"[10] on End Records. It was the beginning of a long and successful collaboration. During this time, Robinson attended college and started classes in January 1959, studying electrical engineering. He dropped out after only two months, following the Miracles' release of their first record.[11] Gordy formed Tamla Records, which was later reincorporated as Motown. The Miracles became one of the first acts signed to the label,[1] although they had actually been with Gordy since before the formation of Motown Records.[12] In late 1960, the group recorded their first hit single, \"Shop Around\", which became Motown's first million-selling hit record.[10] Between 1960 and 1970, Robinson would produce 26 top forty hits with the Miracles as lead singer, chief songwriter and producer, including several top ten hits such as \"You've Really Got a Hold on Me\",[10] \"Mickey's Monkey\", \"I Second That Emotion\", \"Baby Baby Don't Cry\" and the group's only number-one hit during their Robinson years, \"The Tears of a Clown\". Other notable hits such as \"Ooo Baby Baby\", \"Going to a Go-Go\", the multi-award-winning \"The Tracks of My Tears\", \"(Come Round Here) I'm The One You Need\", \"The Love I Saw in You Was Just a Mirage\" and \"More Love\" peaked in the top twenty. In 1965, the Miracles were the first Motown group to change their name when they released their 1965 album Going to a Go-Go as Smokey Robinson & the Miracles. Between 1962 and 1966, Robinson was also one of the major songwriters and producers for Motown, penning many hit singles such as \"Two Lovers\",[10] \"The One Who Really Loves You\", \"You Beat Me to the Punch\" and \"My Guy\" for Mary Wells; \"The Way You Do The Things You Do\", \"My Girl\",[10] \"Since I Lost My Baby\" , \"It's Growing\" , and \"Get Ready\" for the Temptations; \"Still Water (Love)\" for the Four Tops; \"When I'm Gone\" and \"Operator\" for Brenda Holloway; \"Don't Mess With Bill\", \"The Hunter Gets Captured by the Game\" and \"My Baby Must Be a Magician\" for the Marvelettes; and \"I'll Be Doggone\" and \"Ain't That Peculiar\" for Marvin Gaye.[1] After the arrival of Holland–Dozier–Holland and the team of Norman Whitfield and Barrett Strong, Robinson was eclipsed as a top writer and producer for the label, and other Motown artists such as Gaye and Stevie Wonder began to compose more original material. Later in his career, Robinson wrote lyrics and music for the Contours such as \"First I Look at the Purse\", as well as the Four Tops' \"Still Water\" and The Supremes' \"Floy Joy\". The other Miracles—Bobby Rogers, Pete Moore, Ronnie White, and Marv Tarplin—collaborated with him as writers on many of these hits, and Pete Moore also doubled as co-producer with Robinson on several of them. By 1969, Robinson wanted to retire from touring to focus on raising his two children with his wife Claudette, and on his duties as Motown's vice president, a job he had taken on by the mid-1960s after Esther Gordy Edwards had left the position. However, the success of the group's \"Tears of a Clown\" made Robinson stay with the group until 1972.[1] His last performance with the group was in July 1972 in Washington, D.C. After a year of retirement, Robinson announced his comeback with the release of the eponymous Smokey album, in 1973.[1] The album included the Miracles tribute song, \"Sweet Harmony\", and the hit ballad \"Baby Come Close\". In 1974, Robinson's second album, Pure Smokey, was released but failed to produce hits. Robinson struggled to compete with his former collaborators Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder and former Temptations member Eddie Kendricks, as all three had multiple hit singles during this period. Former Beatle George Harrison featured the track \"Pure Smokey\" on his 1976 album Thirty Three & 1/3 as a tribute to Robinson.[citation needed] (Harrison's fellow Beatles John Lennon and Paul McCartney were also fans of Robinson's songwriting and the group covered \"You Really Gotta Hold on Me\" on their second UK album With the Beatles and US album The Beatles' Second Album, respectively.) Robinson answered his critics the following year with A Quiet Storm, released in 1975.[1] The album launched three singles – the number-one R&B hit \"Baby That's Backatcha\", \"The Agony & The Ecstasy\" and \"Quiet Storm\" (the radio format quiet storm, originated by DJ Melvin Lindsey, is named after the album). However, Robinson's solo career suffered from his work as Motown's vice president, and his own music took the backseat. As a result, several albums including Smokey's Family Robinson, Deep in My Soul, Love Breeze and Smokin, saw poor promotion and received bad reviews. At this point Robinson relied on other writers and producers to help him with his albums. Following these albums, Robinson got out of a writer's block after his close collaborator (and fellow Miracle), Marv Tarplin, who joined him on the road in 1973 after Robinson left the Miracles, presented him a tune he had composed on his guitar. Robinson later wrote the lyrics that became his first solo top ten Pop single, \"Cruisin'\".[1] The song hit number one in Cash Box and peaked at number four on the Billboard Hot 100. It also became his first solo number one in New Zealand. Robinson would follow a similar approach with his next album, Warm Thoughts, which produced another top 40 hit, \"Let Me Be the Clock\", though it did not repeat the success of \"Cruisin'\". In 1981, Robinson topped the charts again with another sensual ballad, \"Being with You\", which was another number one hit in Cash Box and peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100.[1] It also hit number one in the UK Singles Chart, becoming his most successful single to date.[1] The Gold-plus parent album sparked a partnership with George Tobin and with Tobin, Robinson released his next several Motown albums, Yes It's You Lady, which produced the hit \"Tell Me Tomorrow\", Touch the Sky and Essar. In 1983, Robinson teamed up with fellow Motown label mate Rick James recording the R&B ballad, \"Ebony Eyes\". In 1987, following a period of personal and professional issues, Robinson made a comeback with the album, One Heartbeat and the singles, \"Just to See Her\" and \"One Heartbeat\",[1] which were Top 10 hits on Billboard's Pop, Soul, and Adult Contemporary charts. They were aided by popular music videos. \"Just to See Her\" won Robinson his first Grammy Award in 1988.[13] The album became one of his most successful ever, selling over 900,000 copies in the United States alone. In the same year, Robinson released One Heartbeat, the UK group ABC released a tribute song, \"When Smokey Sings\". He was inducted as a solo artist to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988,[1] later igniting controversy as the committee had inducted only Robinson and not members of his group, the Miracles, which Robinson saw as an affront.[14][15] In 2012, however, the committee rectified the mistake announcing that the group would be inducted on their own merit. Though Robinson was not listed as an inductee, he was due to induct his former group at the ceremony in April 2012. After MCA purchased Motown in 1988, Robinson relinquished his position as vice president. Following the release of the album, Love Smokey, in 1990, Robinson left Motown for a deal with SBK Records in 1991. However, the album, Double Good Everything failed to chart. Robinson remained virtually quiet during the nineties (though he would make a notable cameo appearance in The Temptations 1998 miniseries), making a brief comeback in 1999 when he re-signed with Motown and issued the album, Intimate, which included the song \"Easy to Love\". In 2003, he once again split ties with Motown, releasing the gospel album, Food for the Spirit on Liquid 8 Records in 2004. In 2004, Robinson sang the main title theme song \"Colorful World\" to the American children's animated series ToddWorld for Discovery Kids, TLC and Mike Young Productions. Two years later, Robinson released the standards album, Timeless Love, in 2006 on Universal Records. In 2009, he issued the album, Time Flies When You're Having Fun on his own label, Robso Records. It reached number 59 on the Billboard album chart, his highest showing since One Heartbeat. He subsequently released \"Now And Then\" in 2010, which peaked at number 131. Smokey & Friends was released in mid-August 2014. It was an album of duets, including songs with Elton John, Linda Ronstadt and James Taylor. It reached number 12 on the Billboard album chart. Christmas Everyday was Robinson's first post-Miracles Christmas album, and was released on November 10, 2017. In 2018, he appeared on an episode of CMT Crossroads alongside country singer Cam.[citation needed] In April 2017, Robinson visited Fremont-Lopez Elementary School in Stockton, California, where he served as a designated arts mentor under Turnaround Arts.[16][17] On July 31, 2018, Robinson appeared on the Fox network's show Beat Shazam as a special guest.[18] Robinson appeared on the song \"Make It Better\" from Anderson Paak's 2019 album Ventura. In 2023, Robinson announced that he would release his first album in almost a decade in April 2023. The nine-track album will be called Gasms, and will feature entirely new music. The first single from the album, called \"If We Don't Have Each Other\", was already available on streaming services by January 2023.[19] Robinson married a fellow Miracles member, Claudette Rogers, in 1959. The couple had two children: a son, Berry Robinson (born 1968), named after Motown's first label founder Berry Gordy, and a daughter, Tamla Robinson (born 1971), named after the original \"Tamla\" label set up by Gordy that would eventually become Motown. According to Robinson, he had affairs with multiple women while married to Claudette, among them an approximately year-long affair with Diana Ross. According to Robinson, Ross ended it because she felt uncomfortable as she was friends with Claudette, whom Robinson admitted he still loved. (A representative for Ross had no comment on Robinson's claim.) Robinson says that loving multiple people in that way simultaneously is natural.[20][21] Robinson also had a son named Trey (born 1984) with another woman during his marriage to Claudette. After Robinson admitted to having fathered a child with a woman other than his wife, he filed for legal separation and later filed for divorce that was finalized in 1986. The Robinsons had also separated in 1974 and during that separation, Robinson engaged in an extramarital affair that inspired the song \"The Agony & The Ecstasy\" (later featured on A Quiet Storm).[22] Robinson married Frances Gladney in May 2002. They own a home in Pittsburgh and use it as a winery.[23] Robinson has not eaten red meat since 1972.[24] He practices Transcendental Meditation.[24][25] Robinson has golden green eyes, which he believes were passed down from his French great-grandmother.[26] Beginning in November 2023, Robinson is the current owner and host of the SiriusXM channel Soul Town, a station that plays R&B and soul hits from the 1950s to the early 1980s. Released under the banner Smokey's Soul Town, Robinson occasionally appears on the channel, recalling his best moments with Motown and meeting other artists as well as pick his favorite songs during that time period.[27][28] On February 22, 1983, Smokey was awarded an individual star on The Hollywood Walk of Fame.[29] Four years later, in 1987, Robinson was inducted to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. Robinson's single \"Just to See Her\" from the One Heartbeat album was awarded the 1988 Grammy Award for Grammy Award for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance. This was Robinson's first Grammy Award.[13] One year later, in 1989, he was inducted to the Songwriter's Hall of Fame In 1993, Robinson was awarded a medal at the National Medal of Arts. Two years before, he won the Heritage Award at the Soul Train Music Awards. In 2005, Robinson was voted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame.[30] At its 138th Commencement Convocation in May 2006, Howard University conferred on Robinson the degree of Doctor of Music, honoris causa. In December 2006 Robinson was one of five Kennedy Center honorees, along with Dolly Parton, Zubin Mehta, Steven Spielberg and Andrew Lloyd Webber. On March 20, 2009, the Miracles were finally honored as a group with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Smokey was present with original Miracles members Bobby Rogers, Pete Moore, (Bobby's cousin) Claudette Rogers, and Gloria White, accepting for her husband, the late Ronnie White, whose daughter Pamela and granddaughter Maya were there representing him as well. Smokey's replacement, 1970s Miracles lead singer Billy Griffin, was also honored.[31] Controversially, original Miracle Marv Tarplin was not honored, against the wishes of his fellow Miracles and the group's fans, who felt that he should have also been there to share the honor. Later, Tarplin did receive his star. He was also inducted with the rest of the original Miracles, Bobby Rogers, Pete Moore, Ronnie White, and Claudette Robinson, into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012, 25 years after Robinson's controversial solo induction in 1987. He was also awarded Society of Singers Lifetime Achievement Award in 2011.[31] In 2009, Robinson received an honorary doctorate degree—along with Linda Ronstadt—and gave a commencement speech at Berklee College of Music's commencement ceremony. In 2015, he was given a BET Lifetime Achievement Award. In 2016, Robinson received the Library of Congress' Gershwin Prize for Popular Song; and, on August 21, 2016, he was inducted into the National Rhythm & Blues Hall of Fame in his hometown of Detroit. In 2019, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement presented by Awards Council members Jimmy Page and Peter Gabriel.[32][33] In 2023, Rolling Stone ranked Robinson at No. 23 on their list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.[34] Studio albums",

                "content": "William \"Smokey\" Robinson (born February 19, 1940 in Detroit, Michigan) is an American R&B singer-songwriter. Most of his hit records were on Motown Records or one of its labels, and many of them were performed with The Miracles, his longtime band. Robinson is an African American. His mother died when he was young; his sister raised him afterwards. Robinson met Berry Gordy when Motown first became famous. He showed Gordy the lyrics to a song he had written. When Gordy asked if Smokey had any other songs, the young man pulled out a notebook with nearly a hundred of them. Few of the songs had potential, but Gordy liked what he saw in Robinson, and signed him and his band to Motown. Gordy helped Robinson become a better songwriter, and sometimes they wrote together. Some of Robinson's songs, like \"My Girl\" and \"My Guy\", were hits for other Motown artists. Robinson's hits with the Miracles included \"Goin' to a Go-Go\", \"You Really Got a Hold On Me\", \"Shop Around\", \"Ooh Baby Baby\", \"Mickey's Monkey\", and \"Baby, Baby Don't Cry\". Stevie Wonder gave Robinson an unfinished song he'd begun in the studio, to see if he could add lyrics and a tune. The song reminded Robinson of circus music, and he remembered I Pagliacci, an opera about clowns. The finished song was called \"The Tears of a Clown\", and it became another hit. Robinson left the Miracles during the 1970s, and began a solo career. The Miracles still had hits (like \"Love Machine\"), and so did Robinson, with songs like \"Cruisin'\" and \"Being With You\". In the 2000s, Robinson went into the frozen food business, with a line of gumbos and similar cuisine.",

                "content": "Our editors will review what you’ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article. Smokey Robinson and the Miracles, American vocal group that helped define the Motown sound of the 1960s and was led by one of the most gifted and influential singer-songwriters in 20th-century popular music. In addition to Smokey Robinson (byname of William Robinson; b. February 19, 1940, Detroit, Michigan, U.S.), the principal members of the group were Warren (“Pete”) Moore (b. November 19, 1938, Detroit—d. November 19, 2017, Las Vegas, Nevada), Bobby Rogers (b. February 19, 1940, Detroit—d. March 3, 2013, Southfield, Michigan), Ronnie White (b. April 5, 1939, Detroit—d. August 26, 1995, Detroit), and Claudette Rogers (b. June 20, 1942, New Orleans, Louisiana, U.S.). Whether writing for fellow artists Mary Wells, the Temptations, or Marvin Gaye or performing with the Miracles, singer-lyricist-arranger-producer Robinson created songs that were supremely balanced between the joy and pain of love. At once playful and passionate, Robinson’s graceful lyrics led Bob Dylan to call him “America’s greatest living poet.” Coming of age in the doo-wop era and deeply influenced by jazz vocalist Sarah Vaughan, Robinson formed the Five Chimes with school friends in the mid-1950s. After some personnel changes, the group, as the Matadors, auditioned unsuccessfully for Jackie Wilson’s manager. However, they greatly impressed Wilson’s songwriter Berry Gordy, who soon became their manager and producer. Most importantly, Gordy became Robinson’s mentor, harnessing his prodigious but unformed composing talents, and Robinson, assisted by the Miracles, became Gordy’s inspiration for the creation of Motown Records. With the arrival of Claudette Rogers, the group changed its name to the Miracles and released “Got a Job” on End Records in 1958. The Miracles struggled onstage in their first performance at the Apollo Theater that year, but good fortune came their way in the form of Marv Tarplin, guitarist for the Primettes, who were led by Robinson’s friend Diana Ross. Tarplin became an honorary (but essential) Miracle, while Robinson introduced Gordy to the Primettes, who soon became the Supremes. In 1959 Robinson and Claudette Rogers were married, and “Bad Girl,” licensed to Chess Records, peaked nationally at number 93. The fiery “Way Over There” and the shimmering “(You Can) Depend on Me” were followed in 1960 by “Shop Around,” the second version of which became an enormous hit, reaching number one on the rhythm-and-blues charts and number two on the pop charts. While Robinson was writing such vital songs as “My Guy” for Mary Wells, “I’ll Be Doggone” for Marvin Gaye, and “My Girl” for the Temptations, he and the Miracles proceeded to record stunning compositions, including “You’ve Really Got a Hold on Me” (1962), “I’ll Try Something New” (1962), “Ooo Baby Baby” (1965), “Choosey Beggar” (1965), “The Tracks of My Tears” (1965), and “More Love” (1967, written following the premature birth and death of Robinson’s twin daughters). The Miracles complemented their songs of aching romance and mature love with buoyant numbers such as “Mickey’s Monkey” (1963), “Going to a Go-Go” (1965), “I Second That Emotion” (1967), and “The Tears of a Clown” (1970). In 1972 Robinson left the Miracles to pursue a solo career. Without him the Miracles enjoyed moderate success in subsequent years—the disco-era “Love Machine (Part 1)” hit number one on the pop charts in 1975—while Robinson produced such solo hits as “Cruisin’ ” (1979), “Being with You” (1981), and Grammy Award-winning “Just to See Her” (1987). He also unintentionally inspired the new soul radio format that took its name from the title track of his 1975 conceptual album A Quiet Storm. Robinson was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987. The Miracles were inducted in 2012. In addition, Robinson was awarded the 2002 National Medal of Arts. He also received a Kennedy Center Honor in 2006, and in 2016 he won the Gershwin Prize for Popular Song.",

                "content": "Once pronounced by Bob Dylan as America’s “greatest living poet,” acclaimed singer-songwriter Smokey Robinson’s career spans over 4 decades of hits. He has received numerous awards including the Grammy Living Legend Award, NARAS Lifetime Achievement Award, Honorary Doctorate (Howard University), Kennedy Center Honors and the National Medal of Arts Award from the President of the United States. He has also been inducted into the Rock ‘n’ Roll Hall of Fame and the Songwriters’ Hall of Fame. Born and raised in Detroit, Michigan, Robinson founded The Miracles while still in high school. The group was Berry Gordy’s first vocal group, and it was at Robinson’s suggestion that Gordy started the Motown Record dynasty. Their single of Robinson’s “Shop Around” became Motown’s first #1 hit on the R&B singles chart. In the years following, Robinson continued to pen hits for the group including “You’ve Really Got a Hold on Me,” “Ooo Baby Baby,” “The Tracks of My Tears,” “Going to a Go-Go,” “More Love,” “Tears of a Clown” (co-written with Stevie Wonder), and “I Second That Emotion.” The Miracles dominated the R&B scene throughout the 1960’s and early 70’s and Robinson became Vice President of Motown Records serving as in-house producer, talent scout and songwriter. In addition to writing hits for the Miracles, Robinson wrote and produced hits for other Motown greats including The Temptations, Mary Wells, Brenda Holloway, Marvin Gaye and others. “The Way You Do the Things You Do,” “My Girl,” “Get Ready,” “You Beat Me to the Punch,” “Don’t Mess with Bill,” “Ain’t That Peculiar,” and “My Guy” are just a few of his songwriting triumphs during those years. John Lennon of The Beatles made countless remarks regarding Robinson’s influence on his music. The Beatles had recorded Robinson and The Miracles’ “You’ve Really Got A Hold On Me” in 1963 and in 1982 another popular British group, The Rolling Stones covered the Robinson and the Miracles’ hit “Going To A Go-Go.” He later turned to a solo career where he continued his tradition of hitmaking with “Just to See Her,” “Quiet Storm,” “Cruisin’,” and “Being with You,” among others. He remained Vice President of Motown records until the sale of the company, shaping the label’s success with friend and mentor Berry Gordy. Following his tenure at Motown, he continued his impressive touring career and released several successful solo albums. During the course of his 50-year career in music, Robinson has accumulated more than 4,000 songs to his credit and continues to thrill sold-out audiences around the world with his high tenor voice, impeccable timing, and profound sense of lyric. Never resting on his laurels, Smokey Robinson remains a beloved icon in our musical heritage.",
