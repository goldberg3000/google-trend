                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Patrick Mahomes' three touchdown passes keyed the Kansas City Chiefs to a convincing 29-10 win over the Pittsburgh Steelers on Christmas Day. With the win, the Chiefs clinched the AFC's No. 1 seed and the coveted first-round playoff bye that comes with it. The Chiefs are also the eighth team in NFL history to win at least 15 regular-season games. While it wasn't a lump of coal, the Steelers received a third straight loss for Christmas and are now trailing the Ravens in the AFC North division standings. While they have already clinched a playoff berth, the Steelers would have to settle for a wild-card spot if the postseason started today. The visiting Chiefs stormed out to a 13-0 lead after scoring on their first two possessions. The Steelers cut their deficit to 13-7 at halftime and were trailing 16-10 late in the third quarter. Kansas City responded by once again scoring touchdowns on consecutive drives, with the second score being set up by a Pittsburgh turnover. Mahomes' third touchdown pass of the day -- a 12-yard completion to Travis Kelce with 12:38 left -- essentially put a bow on the game. On the play, Kelce passed Hall of Fame tight end Tony Gonzalez for the most touchdown receptions in franchise history. Mahomes torched Pittsburgh's secondary to the tune of 320 yards on 29 of 38 passing. Kansas City's defensive charge was spearheaded by its pass rush that sacked Russell Wilson five times. The Chiefs were able to get to Wilson despite the absence of Chris Jones, who was sidelined with an injury. Here's a closer look at how the Chiefs gave their fans a Merry Christmas. The Chiefs received an early Christmas present when Marquise Brown made his Kansas City debut this past Saturday. Kansas City showed off its shiny \"new\" toy on Christmas, as Brown's presence put even more strain on the Steelers' already stretched out defense. While his numbers don't jump off a page, \"Hollywood\" Brown's four receptions forced the Steelers to focus on him while giving the Chiefs' other playmakers more room to roam. That included fellow speedster Xavier Worthy, who gave the Chiefs an early 7-0 with with his short touchdown catch. Kansas City never took its foot off the gas pedal, especially Mahomes, who proved once again that the conversation regarding the NFL's best player stops and ends with him. Mahomes riddled Pittsburgh's proud defense while completing passes to eight different teammates. At the top of that the stat sheet was Kelce, whose 87 yards was his most in a game since Week 9. Defensively, the Chiefs pounced on Pittsburgh's traditionally slow-starting offense by pressuring Wilson, who threw a costly interception to safety Justin Reid late in the first quarter (more on that later). Kansas City's defense later made the game-clinching play when Trent McDuffie forced a fumble that set up Kelce's knockout punch. Where do you want to start? Pittsburgh's third loss in 11 days can be chalked up to a variety of things. Among those things was an underperforming offense and a defense that no longer seems capable of bailing the team out. It's clear that the Steelers' plan was to control the ball while limiting Mahomes' possessions. While the strategy somewhat worked (Pittsburgh won time of possession and controlled the ball for over 17 minutes in the first half), the Steelers didn't fully capitalize on their scoring opportunities. The offense's slow start (and the defense's subsequent slow start) was a crushing blow to Pittsburgh's upset hopes. The Steelers tried to claw back into the game, but they ultimately dug themselves too deep of a hole to climb out of. Offensively, the Steelers didn't do enough to protect Wilson, who continues to pay for price for Pittsburgh's inability to give him a proven No. 2 receiver. Defensively, the Steelers secondary looked confused and out of sync, which was likely somewhat due to the absence of injured starting cornerback Joey Porter Jr. Pittsburgh outrushed the Chiefs 202-61, with Najee Harris leading the way with 74 yards on 13 carries (Harris became the first player in franchise history to rush for over 1,000 yards in each of his first four seasons). But the Steelers' mistakes and their defense's inability to come up with big plays made Pittsburgh's running game a moot point. As noted earlier, the game was up for grabs late in the third quarter after a Chris Boswell field goal made it a 16-10 game. But the Chiefs countered with an 11-play, 77-yard drive that was capped off by a short Kareem Hunt touchdown run. The drive featured two big catches by Brown that included a 17-yard gain on a second-and-14 play. Pittsburgh's next drive was quickly doomed after defensive end Felix Anudike-Uzomah dumped Wilson for a 5-yard loss on second down. On the next play, Steelers tight end Pat Freiermuth caught a short pass and tried to fight for the first down, but he fumbled the ball away in the process. Kansas City quickly cashed in on the turnover on Kelce's record-setting score. Reid's pick was crucial as it abruptly ended a sure Steelers scoring drive. The pick occurred one play after a holding call on Steelers tight end Broderick Jones wiped out a touchdown run by Jaylen Warren. The win gave the Chiefs a franchise-record 15 wins. Kansas City is the first 15-win team since the 2015 Carolina Panthers. Of the previous seven 15-win teams, only two (the 1984 49ers and 1985 Bears) went onto win the Super Bowl. The last five teams to win at least 15 games came up short in their quest to win the Super Bowl. The Steelers will get a little time off before hosting the Bengals in Week 18. The Bengals (7-8) may not be playing for a possible playoff spot depending on what happens between now and the end of the season. Cincinnati has to defeat the Broncos on Saturday if it's going to have any shot at the postseason. Speaking of Denver, the Chiefs will face the Broncos in Denver in Week 18. With the No. 1 seed in hand, the Chiefs will likely rest several key players for that game. George Pickens screams at the sideline after being offsides on a 4th-and-15 play. Things have unraveled quickly for the Steelers, who turn the ball over on downs. Kelce has now passed HOF TE Tony Gonzalez for the most career TD catches in franchise history. Kelce now has 77 career TD grabs. Gonzalez caught 76 scores during his 12-year run in Kansas City. Fittingly, the Chiefs' knockout punch was delivered by Mahomes and Kelce. Mahomes fires a 12-yard TD pass to Kelce while capitalizing on the Freiermuth fumble. Cam Heyward appeared to sustain an injury on the play; he's sitting on the field as trainers are looking at his right leg. Heyward was able to walk off the field under his own power. It's 29-10 KC with 12:38 left. Freiermuth fumbles while fighting for the first down on third-and-15. The ball was punched out by Trent McDuffie and recovered by Nick Bolton. That play occurred one play after Wilson was sacked for a fifth time. Chiefs about to extend their lead and especially put a bow on their franchise record 15th win of the season. Chiefs open the 4th with a short Kareem Hunt TD while extending lead to 22-10. Mahomes picked on the two-point try, though by second-year CB Cory Trice. Chiefs have been getting the necessary yards on the ground when they need them, but really, the key has been the Chiefs' speed at WR and their pass protection. KC takes a 16-10 lead into the fourth quarter. The Chiefs have a second-and-3 on the Steelers' 6-yard line with a chance to take a commanding lead. Mahomes is 25 of 32 with 274 yards with 2 TD's and has yet to be sacked. Eight different Chiefs have caught passes, led by Worthy, who has 79 yards and a score on 8 catches (8 targets). Quick slants to Hollywood Brown that gain 17 and 12 yards give the Chiefs the ball in Steelers territory late in the third quarter. KC's running game has been non-existent, but their newfound depth at receiver with Hollywood has proven to be critical in this game. Wilson was ... you guessed it ... sacked on third down as the Steelers settle for a Chris Boswell. It's 16-10 Chiefs with 5:45 left in the third. Adding to injury was that Wilson had Freiermuth open on that third down. Wilson has been sacked four times today, two by Mike Danna. KC's pass rush has been effective despite Chris Jones' absence. Justin Reid leaves the game after helping tackle Jaylen Warren. We'll keep you monitored on his status. Steelers near midfield, but Wilson continues to be under duress. Karlaftis (who already has two sacks) just hit Wilson, nearly forcing a fumble. Wilson does give the Steelers a first down on a 15-yard run. Wilson's scrambling has been significant today. Chiefs got a second chance on a third down following offsetting penalties. But Mahomes misfires on third down, and Harrison gives KC a 16-7 lead on a short FG with 12:21 left in the third. Steelers ramped up the pressure on Mahomes, but they still haven't been able to sack him. That was a win for Pittsburgh. The Chiefs haven't had many possessions, and given how that drive started, I don't think Mike Tomlin is that upset with allowing a field goal. Worthy burns Steelers rookie LB Payton Wilson for a 21-yard gain as the Chiefs are in the red zone early in the third quarter. Talking and communication issues for Pittsburgh today, especially on pass defense. Score: 13-7 ChiefsFirst downs: Steelers 12-8Third down: Both teams 3-7Total yards: Steelers 181-175Red zone: Chiefs 2-2, Steelers 1-2TOP: Steelers 17:03 Mahomes: 14-18, 143 yards, 2 TD, 0 sacksMahomes leads KC with 12 yards on 1 carry (team has 32 yards on 10 carries ...

Nice open field tackle by Minkah Fitzpatrick on third down forces the Chiefs to punt with 38 seconds left in the first half. Steelers still have one TO left. Was going to be hard for KC to score there as they used up all of their timeouts earlier in the half. Steelers punt, but Chiefs flagged for having too many men on the field, so Pittsburgh re-gains possession with 2:07 left in the first half with the ball near midfield. Wilson scampers for 12 yards as Steelers trying to get on the board before halftime. Wilson has been more mobile in recent weeks, and it's mostly paying dividends. It's giving the offense with what Justin Fields provided during the season's first six weeks. KC appeared entered the red zone on a completion to Kelce, but a questionable hold against Jawaan Taylor wiped the play out and moved KC back to its own 40. KC called time as it appeared that they may discuss a long FG, but they ultimately punt. Steelers have the ball on their own 20, down 13-7 with 6:06 left in the first half. Mahomes hits Xavier Worthy for 13 yards on 3rd and 7 as the Chiefs are now past midfield. Steelers getting some pressure on Mahomes but aren't getting home. Steelers score after Wilson runs it in after no one was open on a play-action pass play. Wilson was 4 of 5 on the drive that included a few completions to Freiermuth, who is having his best season since his rookie year (which was Ben Roethlisberger's final season in Pittsburgh). Warren also making an impact with 50 yards on 6 carries. 13-7 Chiefs with 10:28 left in the first half. Feels like this is a significant drive in the game, with Pitt already being down 13-0. Steelers cross midfield after Wilson hits three straight passes, including a 15-yard completion to Pat Freiermuth. First quarter was summed up by two Mahomes TD passes and a missed scoring opportunity by the Steelers after a Warren TD was called back (holding). Mahomes 7 of 10 for 92 yards and 2 TD's in the first quarter. Wilson was 2 of 4 for 48 yards with a pick. After scoring on their first two drives, the Chiefs have to punt on their third drive. It could have been much worse, though, had Patrick Queen been able to hang onto a possible pick on third down (off a deflected pass) that would have given the Steelers the ball deep in KC territory. Pittsburgh is squandering its opportunities to get turnovers. That's now five turnovers they could have recorded over the past two games (four fumbles, one pick). Wilson goes deep and hits Pickens for 41. Warren rips off a 22-yard run on the next play and appeared to score a TD, but a holding call on TE Darnell Washington wiped out the score. Wilson throws a pick to Justin Reid one play later. Steelers get no points as Wilson has now turned it over three times over the past 5 quarters. Steelers blitz and Mahomes makes them pay with a 49-yard bomb to Justin Watson, who beat Donte Jackson downfield. Watson then scores on an 11-yard completion on third-and-4. Pittsburgh punts for a second time on two drives after George Karlaftis sacks Wilson on second down. Chiefs muff the punt, but are able to recover the fumble. That's now four consecutive fumbles by the opposition that the Steelers have been unable to recover. Najee Harris bursts to the outside for Pitt's first first down on their second drive. Nice block by Van Jefferson to seal the corner for Harris, who should be fresh after getting a total of 15 carries the past two games. Mahomes throws a quick dart to a wide open Xavier Worthy in the flat. Worthy out-ran Minkah Fitzpatrick to the end zone. But KC missed the point after after a penalty on Worthy after the TD pushed Harrison Butler's attempt back 15 yards. Kareem Hunt gains 4 on both down as the Chiefs are in scoring range. KC starts the game with four straight runs, including an 8-yard run by Isiah Pacheco on their first play. But Chiefs have already had to call two timeouts on this drive. Steelers gain 7 yards on first down but have to punt after Wilson takes a sack on third down (he fumbled but pounced on the ball). DE Mike Danna sacked Wilson, but it was more of a coverage sack as no one was open. Chiefs start on Pittsburgh's 42 after a long punt return.

After the Chiefs blew out the Steelers in the early game, the Ravens embarrassed the Texans in the second. Baltimore dominated Houston 31-2 behind another MVP-caliber performance from Lamar Jackson. Houston recorded a safety with 10 minutes left in the second quarter, getting within eight points of Baltimore, but the Texans were held off the scoreboard for the rest of the game. The Ravens run game was on full display. Derrick Henry wasn't thrown off his game by being tackled in the end zone for the early safety, ending with 147 yards and a touchdown on 27 carries.

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. The Baltimore Ravens have taken over first place in the AFC North, and Lamar Jackson made his statement for his third MVP award in a Christmas Day blowout of the Houston Texans. Jackson threw for 168 yards and two touchdowns while rushing for 87 yards -- and passing Michael Vick for the most rushing yards by a quarterback in NFL history -- in the blowout victory. Jackson passed Vick on a 6-yard run with 7:16 remaining in the third quarter to give him 6,110 rushing yards in his career, passing Vick's mark of 6,109. He had 87 of his yards on just four carries and amassed 73 yards on his first two carries -- including a 48-yard touchdown run in the third quarter that put him within striking distance of Vick. Derrick Henry rushed for 147 yards as the Ravens finished with 251 rushing yards in the win. The Ravens defense also didn't allow a point, as the Texans' points came off a safety in the second quarter. C.J. Stroud finished 17 of 31 for 185 yards and an interception. Baltimore needs a win in Week 18 to wrap up the AFC North and the No. 3 seed in the playoffs. Houston appears locked into the No. 4 seed in the AFC with the loss, needing a lot to happen to improve its playoff standing. Takeaways and a recap of this Christmas Day blowout can be found in the live blog below. The Ravens were just better than the Texans in every facet of this game, but the biggest discrepancy ended up being the rushing totals. Baltimore set the tone on the first possession by rushing for 51 yards on an eight-play, 75-yard touchdown drive to kick off the game -- and never relented. Baltimore had 115 rushing yards to Houston's eight after the first quarter, and the Ravens finished with 228 rushing yards to the Texans' 45. Henry had 143 rushing yards and Jackson had 87 on four carries. Just the Ravens doing what they do very well. The Texans are just not on the same level as the Ravens, and were underwhelming in a lot of areas. The defense allowed the Ravens to average 7.7 yards per play and 6.5 yards per carry when the starters were in. The Ravens also scored touchdowns on four of their nine possessions when the starters were in. Stroud and the offense were shut out as well, with the only points coming via the defense (a safety). The Texans quarterback was inaccurate early in the game, which led to them getting into a hole. Houston was also 3 of 13 on third down and 0 of 2 on fourth down when the starters were in. Just a poor showing by the Texans. The Texans were facing a fourth-and-goal at the 4-yard line late in the second quarter, but failed to convert a touchdown and get back in the game. Stroud threw a pass underneath to Joe Mixon that only got three yards. The Texans turned the ball over on down, and that was the closest they got to scoring anything on offense. The Ravens responded with a six-play drive that went 99 yards, capped with a Jackson 9-yard touchdown pass to Isaiah Likely that was an MVP-type throw. Baltimore took a 17-2 lead, and the game felt out of reach at that point. The Texans needed a touchdown on that fourth-and-goal. There were plenty of plays from Jackson that could qualify for this list, but let's go with the Likely touchdown that put Baltimore up 17-2. Jackson took a read-option and rolled to his right, pump faked twice and saw nothing open, so he bought himself more time along the sideline. Jackson had Texans pass rusher Danielle Hunter on skates as he moved backwards and faked him out several times before pointing to Likely in the end zone. He fired to Likely in the middle of the field for the 9-yard touchdown that showcased why Jackson will likely win MVP. This was on the same day Jackson broke the rushing yardage record for quarterbacks. Just another amazing play for Jackson in a career full of them. The Ravens (11-5) close their regular season against the Browns, while the Texans (9-7) end their season against the Jaguars. Both teams are going to the playoffs. The Ravens are going to take over first in the AFC North. They'll clinch the division with a win or Steelers loss next week. Ravens 31, Texans 2 Jackson has 166 passing yards and 2 TD. He has 87 rushing yards on four carrie. The Ravens have 216 rushing yards. Give Lamar the MVP at this rate. Jackson has passed Michael Vick for the most rushing yards by a quarterback in NFL history. Jackson passed Vick on a 6-yard run with 7:16 remaining in the third quarter to give him 6,110 rushing yards in his career, passing Vick's mark of 6,109. C.J. Stroud throws an interception to Kyle Hamilton on the Texans first drive of the second half. On the first play of Baltimore's ensuing possession, Lamar Jackson runs for 48 yards and a score. Jackson is 13 yards away from passing Michael Vick for the most rushing yards ever by a QB. The Ravens are cruising. Enjoy your Christmas dinner. Ravens 24, Texans 2 Looks like Stroud has a leg injury. He'll get it looked at on the sidelines, but missed just one play. Great sign for the Texans. Ravens halted at midfield and Texans will punt. Houston gets ball to start the second half. Hard to see them try to score with 21 seconds left in the half. Texans go 3-and-out. Baltimore has just over a minute to get more points. All three timeouts left. Let's see what Lamar can do. At a loss of words for this Lamar Jackson TD pass to Isaiah Likely. Just an incredible QB. Watch and enjoy. Ravens 17, Texans 2 The reigning MVP doing MVP things. Lamar went to his left, eluded a sack, and threw past the right hashmark to Andrews for 67-yard reception. Andrews almost broke it and scored, but Ravens are inside the 10 at the 2:00 warning. Jackson is 4-of-6 for 110 yards. The Texans decide to go for it on 4th-and-goal at the 3, but Stroud's pass to Joe Mixon only gets one yard. Turnover on downs. Ar'Darius Washington with the stop as the Texans get nothing. Ravens still up 10-2 late in the 2nd Stroud's pass is high to Robert Woods on 4th-and-3 at the BAL 30, but certainly didn't think that warranted a PI call. That may have been a missed call by the officials. That looked like Humphrey was playing the football. Texans get a break. Derrick Henry was tackled in the end zone by Kamari Lassiter for a four-yard loss and a safety. Henry has lost 8 yards in his last 2 carries, but the Texans are on the board. The Texans get the ball back. The 70-yard punt by Tommy Townsend set that up. Ravens 10, Texans 2 Odofe Oweh sacks Stroud for a 13-yard loss. The sack was really bad since it was 3rd-and-2 from the Texans 45. This was easily 4-down territory prior to the sack. Just not a good start for Stroud. Houston held Derrick Henry to -4 yards, then Keaton Mitchell to -6 yards. Lamar Jackson had nothing on 3rd-and-20. The Ravens punt for the first time, but are still up 10-0. Down to 105 rushing yards now. Henry has 10 carries for 86 yards after the first quarter. The Ravens are ahead in rushing yards 115-8. They are up 10-0. Three straight misses for Stroud to end the drive. Stroud missed Dalton Schultz for an easy first down on 3rd-and-10, which would have been a huge gain. Texans put again down 10-0 to Ravens. Stroud is 3-of-6 for 30 yards to start. The Ravens had another impressive drive, but the biggest development was 52-yard Justin Tucker FG. Very encouraging sign for the Ravens, although we need to see Tucker hit that outdoors. Now 6-for-11 on kicks from 50+ this year. Ravens 10, Texans 0 -- Baltimore with 83 rushing yards Baltimore gets a sack on 3rd down. C.J. Stroud taken down by Kyle Van Noy on 3rd down and Houston will punt. The Ravens defense has come alive over the past month, allowing just 187.3 yards per game -- 1st in NFL. Derrick Henry scored on a 2-yard touchdown run on an easy 8-play, 75-yard TD drive for the Ravens. 51 rushing yards for the Ravens on the drive as Lamar Jackson had a 27-yard pass to Zay Flowers and a 25-yard run. Texans had 10-men on the field on the Henry TD. Ravens 7, Texans 0 The Texans are the 1st team ever to win back-to-back division titles with a QB-HC duo each in their 1st 2 NFL seasons -- C.J. Stroud and DeMeco Ryans. Ravens -- First place in AFC North (right now in first with Steelers loss) Texans -- No. 3 seed (would have conference-record tiebreaker over Steelers) A look at the Christmas Day jerseys: Santa Claus is coming to Houston. The Ravens enter the field in front of the Texans crowd. WR Nelson Agholor is among those out on Christmas Day The Texans are without C Juice Scruggs (foot) and G Nick Broeker against the Ravens defense. Good afternoon everyone and Merry Christmas! We got you covered for Ravens and Texans in Houston today. Perhaps maybe there will be some Beyonce halftime updates as well. Excited to watch Lamar Jackson again, and see how C.J. Stroud faces in his first matchup with the Ravens since the AFC Divisional Playoff loss last year. Should be a fun one! © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

                "title": "Lamar Jackson continues historic MVP push as Ravens manhandle Texans - Yahoo Sports",
                "content": "Lamar Jackson won his second NFL MVP award last season. He has been even better this season. Much better, amazingly enough. We’ve seen split MVPs before and that would probably be the most appropriate ending to the Jackson/Josh Allen MVP race. Allen has been tremendous for the Buffalo Bills, doing everything for an offense that won the AFC East. But Jackson can point to many stats ​— including a passer rating that is challenging the all-time single-season NFL record — and say he has been better than Allen and better than his own first two MVP seasons as well. Jackson’s brilliance was on display again on Wednesday. The Ravens took a step toward winning the AFC North title as they dominated the Houston Texans 31-2. It wasn’t Jackson carrying the team on his back, which we’ve seen plenty through his career, but he didn’t do anything to hurt his MVP case. Jackson had two passing touchdowns and another one rushing. After that performance, Jackson’s passer rating is at 121.6, not far from Aaron Rodgers’ NFL single-season record of 122.5. Jackson also broke Michael Vick’s record for career rushing yards by a quarterback, and he will shatter the record considering he’s just 27. The MVP narrative and the betting odds have been in Allen’s favor for the past few weeks. And if Allen wins, he’s deserving. It wouldn’t be quite Joel Embiid winning NBA MVP a couple years ago because voters were tired of giving it to Nikola Jokić every year. Perhaps some Jackson voter fatigue will factor in. Even though Allen has a great case, there’s no good reason to deny Jackson his third MVP. It’ll be a difficult vote. Jackson has help like he never has through his Ravens career. Derrick Henry ensures that Jackson isn’t on his own in the Baltimore offense. Henry set the tone right away at Houston. He had 86 yards and a touchdown in the first quarter alone. Every time he touched the ball the Texans seemed to part to let him through toward the secondary. Henry has been excellent for the Ravens all season, and a big part of why they might be very dangerous in the playoffs. The Ravens gave away two points on a safety when Henry was tackled in the end zone, but the rest of the half was controlled by them. Jackson had a drive in which he escaped the rush to hit tight end Mark Andrews for a 67-yard gain and then finished the drive with another magic trick, moving around to avoid the pass rush for what seemed like a minute before finding Isaiah Likely in the end zone for the touchdown. Jackson completed just six passes in the first half, in part because the Ravens were in no trouble and Henry was running so well, but he had 147 yards on those six passes. The Ravens led 17-2 at halftime, the first 17-2 halftime score in NFL history according to the Netflix broadcast. Jackson said he would skip the Ravens’ halftime to watch Beyoncé perform at halftime, but he stayed in the locker room. He probably could have gone out and caught at least a couple of songs. It’s not like the Ravens had much to worry about. Especially after Jackson had a 48-yard touchdown run to start the scoring in the second half. Jackson is the best running quarterback the NFL has ever seen and has the record to prove it. Jackson is also one game from being the fourth quarterback to post a passer rating of 120 in a season. It will be very hard to deny a player with that unfathomable combination of skills an MVP award. Allen is a similar dual threat, of course. He has 26 touchdown passes to only six interceptions, with 514 rushing yards and 11 touchdowns on the ground. He’s elevated his play despite the Bills trading his No. 1 receiver, Stefon Diggs, in the offseason. Both quarterbacks are similar in that they can pass or run at a dominant level. For a while it seemed like one of Allen’s edges in voters’ eyes would be that he won a division title and Jackson didn’t, but the Ravens have stormed back and are the new favorite to win the AFC North. The Ravens can win the division with a win next week or a Steelers loss. Statistically, Jackson leads Allen in rushing yards, passing yards, passer rating and passing touchdowns. Allen leads in rushing touchdowns, and some advanced stats, like EPA (expected points added) per play, prefer Allen. Jackson probably has more help. Allen’s team has the better record. It’s one of the more interesting MVP debates in a while. The truth is, Jackson’s legacy changes some with a third MVP but a Super Bowl would do way more for it. The Ravens have taken some bad losses this season. But over the past few weeks they look more and more like a contender. Blowing out the Texans on Christmas should be a message to the rest of the AFC, and perhaps MVP voters as well. Lamar Jackson is now the NFL's all-time quarterback leader in rushing yards. He passed Michael Vick tonight in their blowout win in Houston. For more on Lamar Jackson's historic outing, click here.

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. HOUSTON (AP) Lamar Jackson broke the NFL career rushing record for quarterbacks in the Baltimore Ravens' victory over the Houston Texans on Wednesday. A highlight came when Jackson dashed 48 yards for a touchdown on a run where he reached a career-best top speed of 21.25 mph. “I was jogging,” Jackson said. “I didn’t have to do anything.” It was that kind of day for Jackson, who led the Ravens to the 31-2 victory that bolstered his case for MVP as the Ravens moved closer to the AFC North title. “It’s just another phenomenal performance,” coach John Harbaugh said. “He set the all-time NFL record for rushing yards (for a quarterback) in pro football. That kind of speaks for itself. It’s just kind of what he does every week.” Jackson threw for 168 yards and two touchdowns and ran for 87 yards with that long score. He pushed his career rushing total to 6,110 to move past Michael Vick, who had 6,109 in his 13-year career. “Michael Vick, one of my favorite players,” Jackson said. “That’s just dope.” The Ravens (11-5) have already wrapped up their third straight playoff berth and need a victory over Cleveland next week to win the division over Pittsburgh. The Steelers dropped a third straight with a loss to Kansas City on Wednesday. Jackson, the MVP last season and in 2019, put on a show rivaled only by the spectacular Super Bowl-caliber halftime performance by Beyoncé to give Baltimore its third straight win. And he needed just more than three quarters to do it, giving way to Josh Johnson with about 10 minutes left and the game long decided. “Just having fun,” Jackson said. “The NFL is not easy. I don’t care what nobody says. It looks easy, but it’s not.” Jackson threw 9- and 1-yard TD passes and was not touched on the 48-yard scoring scamper that made it 24-2 in the third quarter. Derrick Henry ran for 147 yards and set the Ravens season record with his 16th touchdown on a 2-yard run in the first quarter. He eclipsed Ray Rice (2011) and Mark Ingram (2019). Baltimore dominated a Houston team reeling after losing dynamic receiver Tank Dell to a season-ending knee injury Saturday. “This game comes down to guys making plays and they had two exceptional playmakers on their side in Lamar and Derrick Henry,” Houston coach DeMeco Ryans said. “They made plays and that was the game.” The AFC South champs struggled to finish drives and got their only points on a safety in the second quarter. C.J. Stroud threw for 185 yards, but was sacked five times and threw an interception and Joe Mixon managed just 26 yards rushing as the Texans (9-7) lost a second straight. Mixon refused to speak to reporters postgame, but Stroud took the blame for the loss. “Terrible on my behalf, probably one of my worst games in my whole career,” he said. “Just came out flat, didn’t have any energy. I didn’t lead the offense the way I should have.” Rookie Kamari Lassiter dropped Henry for a 4-yard loss for the safety with about 10 minutes left in the first half to cut the lead to 10-2. Dameon Pierce then returned the kickoff 45 yards to get the Texans to their 43. But they came away empty when Mixon was stopped on the 1 after grabbing a short pass on fourth-and-3. Jackson then orchestrated a 99-yard drive to pad the lead. He scrambled to evade the rush and found Mark Andrews for a 67-yard gain to get the Ravens in the red zone with just more than two minutes left in the first half. Isaiah Likely’s 9-yard TD reception two plays later made it 17-2. It was the first 17-2 halftime score in NFL history. Kyle Hamilton intercepted Stroud's pass on the first drive of the second half. Two plays later, Jackson’s long TD run made it 24-2. He set the rushing record on a 6-yard run on Baltimore’s next drive. Later in the drive, he scrambled to escape several defenders before finding Andrews for a 1-yard score to leave Baltimore up 31-2. Ravens RB Rasheen Ali injured his hip in the third quarter and didn’t return. … Texans TE Cade Stover returned after missing two games following an emergency appendectomy. The Ravens host the Browns, and the Texans visit the Titans next weekend. The game dates have yet to be determined. --- AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl Copyright 2024 STATS LLC and Associated Press.

                "title": "Beyoncé - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Beyoncé Giselle Knowles-Carter (/biˈɒnseɪ/ ⓘ, bee-ON-say;[6] born September 4, 1981)[7] is an American singer, songwriter, actress, and businesswoman. Regarded as one of the most influential cultural figures in music history,[8] she has transformed the sound of popular music with her vocal ability, live performances and artistic innovations. Her work is considered to be amongst the greatest of all time.[9] As a child, Beyoncé began performing through various singing and dancing competitions. She debuted in the late 1990s and rose to fame as a member of Destiny's Child, one of the best-selling girl groups of all time. Her debut solo album, Dangerously in Love (2003), became one of the best-selling albums of the 21st century and spawned the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles \"Crazy in Love\" and \"Baby Boy\". Beyoncé's commercial success continued with the albums B'Day (2006), I Am... Sasha Fierce (2008) and 4 (2011), all of which featured hit singles including \"Irreplaceable\", \"Check on It\", \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on it)\", \"If I Were a Boy\", \"Halo\", \"Run the World (Girls)\" and \"Love On Top\". She has also ventured into acting, with leading roles in the films Dreamgirls (2006), Cadillac Records (2008) and Obsessed (2009). Beyoncé's career shifted after forming her own management company Parkwood Entertainment, creating monocultural events through acclaimed concept albums.[10] She explored personal and sociopolitical themes on Beyoncé (2013) and Lemonade (2016), which are credited with popularizing the surprise album and visual album. The former inspired setting Friday as the Global Release Day, while the latter became the best-selling album of 2016 worldwide. Her ongoing trilogy project – currently consisting of queer-inspired dance album Renaissance (2022) and Americana epic Cowboy Carter (2024) – has highlighted the contributions of Black pioneers to American musical and cultural history, spawning the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles \"Break My Soul\" and \"Texas Hold 'Em\". Beyoncé is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold 200 million records worldwide, making her the most Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA)-certified female artist in history.[11][12][13] Her accolades include the most Grammy Awards (32), NAACP Image Awards (25), BET Awards (32) and Soul Train Music Awards (25) of any artist. Billboard ranked her as the greatest pop star of the 21st century and Rolling Stone named her among the best singers of all time.[14][15] She was repeatedly named artist of the decade for both the 2000s and 2010s, including recognition as the RIAA's Top Certified Artist of the Decade and Pollstar's Touring Artist of the Decade.[16] She is the only female artist to debut all of her eight solo albums at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200, and she is the only artist to release new Billboard Hot 100 number-one hits in four different decades (including group achievements).[17] She is a ubiquitous figure within popular culture and has influenced various other artists. Beyoncé Giselle Knowles was born on September 4, 1981, at the Park Plaza Hospital[18] in Houston, Texas to Tina Knowles (née Beyoncé), a hairdresser and salon owner, and Mathew Knowles, a Xerox sales manager.[19] Tina is Louisiana Creole and Mathew is African American.[20][21][22][23] Beyoncé's younger sister, Solange Knowles, is also a singer and a former backup dancer for Destiny's Child. Solange and Beyoncé are the first sisters to have both had number one solo albums.[24] Beyoncé's maternal grandparents, Lumis Albert Beyincé and Agnéz Deréon (daughter of Odilia Broussard and Eugène DeRouen),[25] were French-speaking Louisiana Creoles, with roots in New Iberia;[26][25][27] She is a descendant of Acadian militia officer Joseph Broussard, who was exiled to French Louisiana after the expulsion of the Acadians, and of the French military officer and Abenaki chief Jean-Vincent d'Abbadie, Baron de Saint-Castin.[21][28] She has additional Breton heritage. Beyoncé's fourth great-grandmother, Marie-Françoise Trahan, was born in 1774 in Bangor, located on Belle Île, France. Trahan was a daughter of Acadians who had taken refuge on Belle Île after the Acadian expulsion. The Estates of Brittany had divided the lands of Belle Île to distribute them among 78 other Acadian families and the already settled inhabitants. The Trahan family lived on Belle Île for over ten years before migrating to Louisiana, where she married a Broussard descendant.[29] Beyoncé researched her ancestry and discovered that she is descended from a slave owner who married his slave.[30] Her mother is also of distant Irish and Jewish ancestry.[31][32][33][26] Beyoncé also has Belgian ancestry from Hainaut Province, Wallonia and is related to a former mayor of Froidchapelle, Belgium.[34][35] Beyoncé was raised with multiple religious traditions, attending St. John's United Methodist Church in Houston as well as St. Mary of the Purification Catholic Church.[36][37][38] She went to St. Mary's Catholic Montessori School in Houston and enrolled in dance classes there.[39] Her singing ability was discovered when dance instructor Darlette Johnson began humming a song and Beyoncé finished it, able to hit the high-pitched notes.[40] Beyoncé's interest in music and performing continued after winning a school talent show at age seven, singing John Lennon's \"Imagine\" to beat 15/16-year-olds.[41][42] In the fall of 1990, Beyoncé enrolled in Parker Elementary School, a music magnet school in Houston, where she performed with the school's choir.[43] She also attended the High School for the Performing and Visual Arts[44] and later Alief Elsik High School.[20][45] Beyoncé was also a member of the choir at St. John's United Methodist Church where she sang her first solo and was a soloist for two years.[37][46] When Beyoncé was eight, she met LaTavia Roberson at an audition for an all-girl entertainment group.[47] They were placed into a group called Girl's Tyme with three other girls, and rapped and danced on the talent show circuit in Houston.[48] After seeing the group, R&B producer Arne Frager brought them to his Northern California studio and placed them in Star Search, the largest talent show on national TV at the time. Girl's Tyme failed to win, and Beyoncé later said the song they performed was not good.[49][50] In 1995, Beyoncé's father, Mathew, resigned from his job to manage the group.[51] The move reduced the family's income by half, and Beyoncé's parents were forced to sell their house and cars and move into separated apartments.[20][52] Mathew cut the original line-up to four and the group continued performing as an opening act for other established R&B girl groups.[47] The girls auditioned before record labels and were finally signed to Elektra Records, moving to Atlanta Records briefly to work on their first recording, only to be cut by the company.[20] This put further strain on the family, and Beyoncé's parents separated. On October 5, 1995, Dwayne Wiggins's Grass Roots Entertainment signed the group. In 1996, the girls began recording their debut album under an agreement with Sony Music, the Knowles family reunited, and shortly after, the group got a contract with Columbia Records with the assistance of Columbia talent scout Teresa LaBarbera Whites.[41] The group changed their name to Destiny's Child in 1996, based upon a passage in the Book of Isaiah.[53] In 1997, Destiny's Child released their major label debut song \"Killing Time\" on the soundtrack to the 1997 film Men in Black.[50] In November, the group released their debut single and first major hit, \"No, No, No\". They released their self-titled debut album in February 1998, which established the group as a viable act in the music industry.[47] The group released their Multi-Platinum second album The Writing's on the Wall in 1999. The record features songs such as \"Bills, Bills, Bills\", the group's first number-one single, \"Jumpin' Jumpin'\" and \"Say My Name\", which became their most successful song at the time, and would remain one of their signature songs. \"Say My Name\" won the Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals and the Best R&B Song at the 43rd Annual Grammy Awards.[47] The Writing's on the Wall sold more than eight million copies worldwide.[49] During this time, Beyoncé recorded a duet with Marc Nelson, an original member of Boyz II Men, on the song \"After All Is Said and Done\" for the soundtrack to the 1999 film, The Best Man, as well as \"Ways To Get Cut Off\", a collaboration with fellow Columbia Records signee JoJo Robinson that was later shelved.[54][55] The remaining band members recorded \"Independent Women Part I\", which appeared on the soundtrack to the 2000 film Charlie's Angels. It became their best-charting single, topping the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart for eleven consecutive weeks.[47] In early 2001, while Destiny's Child was completing their third album, Beyoncé landed a major role in the MTV made-for-television film, Carmen: A Hip Hopera, starring alongside American actor Mekhi Phifer. Set in Philadelphia, the film is a modern interpretation of the 19th-century opera Carmen by French composer Georges Bizet.[56] When the third album Survivor was released in May 2001, Luckett and Roberson filed a lawsuit claiming that the songs were aimed at them.[47] The album debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200, with first-week sales of 663,000 copies sold.[57] The album spawned other number-one hits, \"Bootylicious\" and the title track, \"Survivor\", the latter of which earned the group a Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals.[58] After releasing their holiday album 8 Days of Christmas in October 2001, the group announced a hiatus to further pursue solo careers.[47] In July 2002, Beyoncé made her theatrical film debut, playing Foxxy Cleopatra alongside Mike Myers in the comedy film Austin Powers in Goldmember,[59] which spent its first weekend atop the U.S. box office and grossed $73 million.[60] Beyoncé released \"Work It Out\" as the lead single from its soundtrack album which entered the top ten in the UK, Norway, and Belgium.[61] In 2003, Beyoncé starred opposite Cuba Gooding Jr. in the musical comedy The Fighting Temptations as Lilly, a single mother with whom Gooding's character falls in love.[62] The film received mixed reviews from critics but grossed $30 million in the U.S.[63][64] Beyoncé released \"Fighting Temptation\" as the lead single from the film's soundtrack album, with Missy Elliott, MC Lyte, and Free which was also used to promote the film.[65] Another of Beyoncé's contributions to the soundtrack, \"Summertime\", fared better on the U.S. charts.[66] Beyoncé's first solo recording was a feature on Jay-Z's song \"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\" that was released in October 2002, peaking at number four on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart.[68] On June 14, 2003, Beyoncé premiered songs from her first solo album Dangerously in Love during her first solo concert and the pay-per-view television special, \"Ford Presents Beyoncé Knowles, Friends & Family, Live From Ford's 100th Anniversary Celebration in Dearborn, Michigan\".[69] The album was released on June 24, 2003, after Michelle Williams and Kelly Rowland had released their solo efforts.[70] The album sold 317,000 copies in its first week, debuted atop the Billboard 200,[71] and has since sold 11 million copies worldwide.[72] The album's lead single, \"Crazy in Love\", featuring Jay-Z, became Beyoncé's first number-one single as a solo artist in the US.[73] The single \"Baby Boy\" also reached number one,[67] and singles, \"Me, Myself and I\" and \"Naughty Girl\", both reached the top-five.[74] The album earned Beyoncé a then record-tying five awards at the 46th Annual Grammy Awards; Best Contemporary R&B Album, Best Female R&B Vocal Performance for \"Dangerously in Love 2\", Best R&B Song and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration for \"Crazy in Love\", and Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals for \"The Closer I Get to You\" with Luther Vandross. During the ceremony, she performed with Prince.[75] In November 2003, she embarked on the Dangerously in Love Tour in Europe and later toured alongside Missy Elliott and Alicia Keys for the Verizon Ladies First Tour in North America.[76] On February 1, 2004, Beyoncé performed the American national anthem at Super Bowl XXXVIII, at the Reliant Stadium in Houston, Texas.[77] After the release of Dangerously in Love, Beyoncé had planned to produce a follow-up album using several of the left-over tracks. However, this was put on hold so she could concentrate on recording Destiny Fulfilled, the final studio album by Destiny's Child.[78] Released on November 15, 2004, in the U.S.[79] and peaking at number two on the Billboard 200,[80][81] Destiny Fulfilled included the singles \"Lose My Breath\" and \"Soldier\", which reached the top five on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.[82] Destiny's Child embarked on a worldwide concert tour, Destiny Fulfilled... and Lovin' It sponsored by McDonald's Corporation,[83] and performed songs such as \"No, No, No\", \"Survivor\", \"Say My Name\", \"Independent Women\" and \"Lose My Breath\".

This would have made Beyoncé only the second female headliner of the festival since it was founded in 1999.[190] It was later announced on February 23, 2017, that Beyoncé would no longer be able to perform at the festival due to doctor's concerns regarding her pregnancy. The festival owners announced that she would instead headline the 2018 festival.[191] Upon the announcement of Beyoncé's departure from the festival lineup, ticket prices dropped by 12%.[192] At the 59th Grammy Awards in February 2017, Lemonade led the nominations with nine, including Album, Record, and Song of the Year for Lemonade and \"Formation\" respectively.[193] and ultimately won two, Best Urban Contemporary Album for Lemonade and Best Music Video for \"Formation\".[194] In September 2017, Beyoncé collaborated with J Balvin and Willy William, to release a remix of the song \"Mi Gente\".

Her performance of April 14, attended by 125,000 festival-goers, was immediately praised, with multiple media outlets describing it as historic. The performance became the most-tweeted-about performance of weekend one, as well as the most-watched live Coachella performance and the most-watched live performance on YouTube of all time. The show paid tribute to black culture, specifically historically black colleges and universities and featured a live band with over 100 dancers. Destiny's Child also reunited during the show.[203][204] On June 6, 2018, Beyoncé and husband Jay-Z kicked-off the On the Run II Tour in Cardiff, United Kingdom.

She stated that the album is influenced by everything from R&B, pop, hip hop, gqom and Afro Beat.[218][220] The songs were produced by African producers, which Beyoncé said was because \"authenticity and heart were important to [her]\", since the film is set in Africa.[218] In September of the same year, a documentary chronicling the development, production and early music video filming of The Lion King: The Gift entitled \"Beyoncé Presents: Making The Gift\" was aired on ABC.[221] In March 2020, a photograph Beyoncé captured of her swimming pool was used as the album cover for rapper Jay Electronica's highly anticipated debut album A Written Testimony.[222] In April of the same year, Beyoncé was featured on the remix of Megan Thee Stallion's song \"Savage\", marking her first music release for the year.[223] The song peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, marking Beyoncé's eleventh song to do so across all acts.[224] On June 19, 2020, Beyoncé released the nonprofit charity single \"Black Parade\".[225] On June 23, she followed up the release of its studio version with an a cappella version exclusively on Tidal.[226] Black Is King, a visual album based on the music of The Lion King: The Gift, premiered globally on Disney+ on July 31, 2020.

A time she found to be her \"most creative [period].\"[240][235] The three recorded projects are designated into acts under Roman numerals.[241] Upon release, Renaissance received universal acclaim from critics.[242] Renaissance debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart, making her the first female artist to have her first seven studio albums debut at number one in the United States.[243] \"Break My Soul\" concurrently rose to number-one on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming the twelfth song to do so across her career discography.[244] The song \"Heated\", which was co-written with Canadian rapper Drake, originally included the lyrics \"Spazzin' on that ass / spazz on that ass\". Critics, including a number of disability charities and activists, argued that the word \"spaz\" represented a derogatory term for spastic diplegia, a form of cerebral palsy. In response, in August 2022, a representative for Beyoncé issued a statement and explained that \"The word, not used intentionally in a harmful way, will be replaced\".[245][246] On January 21, 2023, Beyoncé performed in Dubai at a private show.[247] The performance, which was her first full concert in more than four years, was delivered to an audience of influencers and journalists.[248] Beyoncé was reportedly paid $24 million to perform.[249] Beyoncé faced criticism for her decision to perform in the United Arab Emirates where homosexuality is illegal.[249][248][250] On February 1, Beyoncé announced the Renaissance World Tour with dates in North America and Europe,[251] becoming for a short-span, the highest-grossing tour by a female artist.[252] On July 28, Beyoncé appeared on \"Delresto (Echoes)\", the second single from rapper Travis Scott's album Utopia, eventually becoming her 100th career appearance on the Billboard Hot 100 chart (encompassing Destiny's Child, her solo career, and musical duo The Carters).[253] On November 30, 2023, Beyoncé released documentary concert film Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé written, directed, and produced by her in collaboration with film distributor AMC Theatres. The film chronicles the development and execution of Beyoncé's Renaissance World Tour, and contained new song \"My House\" in the end credits.[254] In February 2024, Beyoncé launched her hair care brand Cécred.[255] On February 11, 2024, immediately following a partner commercial with Verizon for the Super Bowl LVIII, she announced the second installment of her trilogy project and released its first two songs, \"Texas Hold 'Em\" and \"16 Carriages\".[256] \"Texas Hold 'Em\" became her highest chart debut in her career, her ninth solo number-one and her thirteenth across all credits on the Billboard Hot 100. On March 12, 2024, she announced the album's title, Cowboy Carter.[257][258] A country and gospel-tinged record, it was released on March 29 to universal acclaim from critics, and includes collaborations with artists including Tanner Adell and her daughter Rumi Carter, Miley Cyrus, Tiera Kennedy, Willie Jones, Post Malone, Linda Martell, Willie Nelson, Shaboozey, Brittney Spencer, Dolly Parton, and Reyna Roberts.[259] In July 2024, NBC released two promotional commercials featuring Beyoncé for their coverage of the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, France.[260] Set to Cowboy Carter songs \"Ya Ya\" and \"Just For Fun\", she introduced the entire USA Olympic Team and Gold-medal gymnast Simone Biles, respectively.[261][262] On August 20, Beyoncé announced SirDavis, a whiskey in collaboration with Moët Hennessy developed for years prior and co-founded with master distiller Dr. Bill Lumsden.[263] In October 2024, Levi's launched a four-part global campaign with Beyoncé titled \"Reiimagine\" that will stretch into 2025 and focus on women's history of the company, using Cowboy Carter track \"Levii's Jeans\".[264] The first commercial starring Beyoncé amassed 2.4 billion impressions in under a month.[265] Beyoncé reprised her role as Nala for Mufasa: The Lion King, a prequel to the 2019 remake, released in December 2024.[266] On December 25, 2024, Beyoncé headlined the first ever NFL Christmas Gameday Halftime Show.[267] With \"Single Ladies\", clearly I'd just gotten married, and people want to get married every day – then there was the whole Justin Timberlake thing [recreating the video] on Saturday Night Live, and it was also the year YouTube blew up. With \"Irreplaceable\", the aggressive lyrics, the acoustic guitar, and the 808 drum machine – those things don't typically go together, and it sounded fresh. \"Crazy in Love\" was another one of those classic moments in pop culture that none of us expected. I asked Jay to get on the song the night before I had to turn my album in – thank God he did. It still never gets old, no matter how many times I sing it. Critics have described Beyoncé's voice as being mezzo-soprano.[269][270] Jody Rosen highlights her tone and timbre as particularly distinctive, describing her voice as \"one of the most compelling instruments in popular music\".[271] Her vocal abilities mean she is identified as the centerpiece of Destiny's Child.[272] Jon Pareles of The New York Times commented that her voice is \"velvety yet tart, with an insistent flutter and reserves of soul belting\".[273] Rosen notes that the hip hop era highly influenced Beyoncé's unique rhythmic vocal style, but also finds her quite traditionalist in her use of balladry, gospel and falsetto.[271] Other critics praise her range and power, with Chris Richards of The Washington Post saying she was \"capable of punctuating any beat with goose-bump-inducing whispers or full-bore diva-roars.\"[274] On the 2023 Rolling Stone's list of the 200 Greatest Singers of all time, Beyoncé ranked at number 8, with the publication noting that \"in [her] voice lies the entire history of Black music\".[275] Beyoncé's music is generally R&B,[276][277] pop[276][278] and hip hop[279] but she also incorporates soul and funk into her songs. 4 demonstrated Beyoncé's exploration of 1990s-style R&B, as well as further use of soul and hip hop than compared to previous releases.[268] While she almost exclusively releases English songs, Beyoncé recorded several Spanish songs for Irreemplazable (re-recordings of songs from B'Day for a Spanish-language audience), and the re-release of B'Day. To record these, Beyoncé was coached phonetically by American record producer Rudy Perez.[280] Beyoncé has received co-writing credits for most of her songs.[281] Her early songs with Destiny's Child were personally driven and female-empowerment themed compositions like \"Independent Women\" and \"Survivor\", but after the start of her relationship with Jay-Z, she transitioned to more man-tending anthems such as \"Cater 2 U\".[282] Beyoncé's songwriting process is also known for combining parts of different tracks, resulting in alteration of song structures. Sia, who co-wrote \"Pretty Hurts\", called Beyoncé \"very Frankenstein when she comes to songs\";[283] Diana Gordon, who co-wrote \"Don't Hurt Yourself\" called her a \"scientist of songs\";[284] Caroline Polachek who co-wrote \"No Angel\", called her a \"genius writer and producer for this reason. She's so good at seeing connections.\"[285] In 2001, she became the first Black woman and second female lyricist to win the Pop Songwriter of the Year award at the ASCAP Pop Music Awards.[20][286] Beyoncé was the third woman to have writing credits on three number-one songs (\"Irreplaceable\", \"Grillz\" and \"Check on It\") in the same year, after Carole King in 1971 and Mariah Carey in 1991. She is tied with American lyricist Diane Warren at third with nine songwriting credits on number-one singles.[287] The latter wrote her song \"I Was Here\" for 4, which was motivated by the September 11 attacks.[288] In May 2011, Billboard magazine listed Beyoncé at number 17 on their list of the Top 20 Hot 100 Songwriters for having co-written eight singles that hit number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. She was one of only three women on that list, along with Alicia Keys and Taylor Swift.[289] Beyoncé has received criticism, including from journalists and musicians, for the extensive writing credits on her songs.[281] The controversy surrounding her songwriting credits began with interviews in which she attributed herself as the songwriter for songs in which she was a co-writer[290] or for which her contributions were marginal.[281] In a cover story for Vanity Fair in 2005, she claimed to have \"written\" several number-one songs for Destiny's Child, contrary to the credits, which list her as a co-writer among others.[290] During a 2007 interview with Barbara Walters, she claimed to have conceived the musical idea for the Destiny's Child song \"Bootylicious\",[291] which provoked the song's producer Rob Fusari to call her father and then-manager Mathew Knowles in protest over the claim. In 2010, Fusari told Billboard: \"[Knowles] explained to me, in a nice way, he said, 'People don't want to hear about Rob Fusari, producer from Livingston, N.J. No offense, but that's not what sells records. What sells records is people believing that the artist is everything.'\"[292] However, in an interview for Entertainment Weekly in 2016, Fusari said Beyoncé \"had the 'Bootylicious' concept in her head. That was totally her. She knew what she wanted to say. It was very urban pop angle that they were taking on the record.\"[293] I am really passionate about all of the steps [during] the production [...] I love to stack vocals, and I love to create my own little Oreo with arrangements, sometimes it can be thousands of vocals [and then] I go back and then kind of piece things together, because usually the songs are way too long [...] I go back and edit the structure of the song. [I] make sure that [...] every section has an intention, so that takes months. [...] I hear certain elements of things that go with things that are opposites. I am rarely happy with one track, it's usually four or five things put together that again don't really go together. I am so excited when I'm able to adjust the tempo and key and mute certain elements that don't complement and put opposites together. Sometimes it's just like the EQ of a synth or the warmth of a bass or the distortion of a bass that's on a different song and I can hear like, 'Ah! That's exactly what is missing to make the track full and complete!' Beyoncé's collaborators frequently mention her talent and involvement in the record production of her songs,[295][296] sometimes describing her as a genius in the skill.[297] She is known to have favorite saturation and distortion plug‑ins, intentionality about stereo imaging and concentration on individual elements of her songs as a \"focal point\" in production.[298] Beyoncé names Michael Jackson as her major musical influence.[299][300] Aged five, Beyoncé attended her first ever concert where Jackson performed and she claims to have realized her purpose.[301] When she presented him with a tribute award at the World Music Awards in 2006, Beyoncé said, \"if it wasn't for Michael Jackson, I would never ever have performed.\"[302] Beyoncé was heavily influenced by Tina Turner, and once said \"Tina Turner is someone that I admire, because she made her strength feminine and sexy\".[303][304] She admires Diana Ross as an \"all-around entertainer\",[305] and Whitney Houston, who she said \"inspired me to get up there and do what she did.\"[306][307] Beyoncé cited Madonna as an influence \"not only for her musical style, but also for her business sense\",[308] saying that she wanted to \"follow in the footsteps of Madonna and be a powerhouse and have my own empire.\"[309] She also credits Mariah Carey's singing and her song \"Vision of Love\" as influencing her to begin practicing vocal runs as a child.[310][311] Her other musical influences include Rachelle Ferrell,[312] Aaliyah,[313] Janet Jackson,[314] Prince,[315] Lauryn Hill,[305] Sade Adu,[316] Donna Summer,[317] Fairuz,[318][319] Mary J. Blige,[320] Selena,[321] Anita Baker, and Toni Braxton.[305] The feminism and female empowerment themes on Beyoncé's second solo album B'Day were inspired by her role in Dreamgirls[322] and by singer Josephine Baker.[323] Beyoncé paid homage to Baker by performing \"Déjà Vu\" at the 2006 Fashion Rocks concert wearing Baker's trademark mini-hula skirt embellished with fake bananas.[324] Beyoncé's third solo album, I Am... Sasha Fierce, was inspired by Jay-Z and especially by Etta James, whose \"boldness\" inspired Beyoncé to explore other musical genres and styles.[325] Her fourth solo album, 4, was inspired by Fela Kuti, 1990s R&B, Earth, Wind & Fire, DeBarge, Lionel Richie, Teena Marie, The Jackson 5, New Edition, Adele, Florence and the Machine, and Prince.[268] Beyoncé has stated that she is personally inspired by Michelle Obama (the 44th First Lady of the United States), saying \"she proves you can do it all\",[326] and has described Oprah Winfrey as \"the definition of inspiration and a strong woman.\"[305] She has also discussed how Jay-Z is a continuing inspiration to her, both with what she describes as his lyrical genius and in the obstacles he has overcome in his life.[327] Beyoncé has expressed admiration for the artist Jean-Michel Basquiat, posting in a letter \"what I find in the work of Jean-Michel Basquiat, I search for in every day in music ... he is lyrical and raw\".[328][329] Beyoncé has also cited Cher as a fashion inspiration.[330] In 2006, Beyoncé introduced her all-female tour band Suga Mama (also the name of a song on B'Day) which includes bassists, drummers, guitarists, horn players, keyboardists and percussionists.[331] Her background singers, The Mamas, consist of Montina Cooper-Donnell, Crystal Collins and Tiffany Moniqué Riddick. They made their debut appearance at the 2006 BET Awards and re-appeared in the music videos for \"Irreplaceable\" and \"Green Light\".[280] The band have supported Beyoncé in most subsequent live performances, including her 2007 concert tour The Beyoncé Experience, I Am... Tour (2009–2010), The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour (2013–2014) and The Formation World Tour (2016). Beyoncé has received praise for her stage presence and voice during live performances. According to Barbara Ellen of The Guardian, Beyoncé is the most in-charge female artist she's seen onstage.[332] Similarly, Alice Jones of The Independent wrote she \"takes her role as entertainer so seriously she's almost too good.\"[333] The ex-President of Def Jam L.A. Reid has described Beyoncé as the greatest entertainer alive.[334] Jim Farber of the Daily News and Stephanie Classen of The StarPhoenix both praised her strong voice and her stage presence.[335][336] I choose to invest my time and energy only in projects that I am passionate about. Once I've committed, I give it all of me. I start with identifying my intention and making sure that I am aligned with the collaborators for the same purpose. It takes enormous patience to rock with me. My process is tedious. I review every second of footage several times and know it backwards and forwards. I find every ounce of magic and then I deconstruct it. I keep building more layers and repeat this editing process for months. I won't let up until it's undeniably reached its full potential. I believe my strength is understanding how storytelling, music, lighting, angles, fashion, art direction, history, dance, and editing work together. They are all equally important. Beyoncé's stage outfits have been met with criticism from many countries, such as Malaysia, where she has postponed or cancelled performances due to the country's strict laws banning revealing costumes.[338] Beyoncé has worked with numerous directors for her music videos throughout her career, including Melina Matsoukas, Jonas Åkerlund, and Jake Nava. Bill Condon, director of Beauty and the Beast, stated that the Lemonade visuals in particular served as inspiration for his film, commenting, \"You look at Beyoncé's brilliant movie Lemonade, this genre is taking on so many different forms ... I do think that this very old-school break-out-into-song traditional musical is something that people understand again and really want.\"[339] Described as being \"sexy, seductive and provocative\" when performing on stage, Beyoncé has said that she originally created the alter ego \"Sasha Fierce\" to keep that stage persona separate from who she really is. She described Sasha Fierce as being \"too aggressive, too strong, too sassy [and] too sexy\", stating, \"I'm not like her in real life at all.\"[340] Sasha was conceived during the making of \"Crazy in Love\", and Beyoncé introduced her with the release of her 2008 album, I Am... Sasha Fierce. In February 2010, she announced in an interview with Allure magazine that she was comfortable enough with herself to no longer need Sasha Fierce.[341] However, Beyoncé announced in May 2012 that she would bring her back for her Revel Presents: Beyoncé Live shows later that month.[342] Beyoncé has been described as having sex appeal, with music journalist Touré writing that since the release of Dangerously in Love, she has \"become a crossover sex symbol\".[343] When off stage, Beyoncé says that while she likes to dress sexily, her onstage dress \"is absolutely for the stage\".[344] Due to her curves and the term's catchiness, in the 2000s, the media often used the term \"bootylicious\" (a portmanteau of the words \"booty\" and \"delicious\") to describe Beyoncé,[345][346] the term popularized by the single of the same name by her group Destiny's Child. In 2006, it was added to the Oxford English Dictionary.[347] In September 2010, Beyoncé made her runway modelling debut at Tom Ford's Spring/Summer 2011 fashion show.[348] She was named the \"World's Most Beautiful Woman\" by People[349] and the \"Hottest Female Singer of All Time\" by Complex in 2012.[350] In January 2013, GQ placed her on its cover, featuring her atop its \"100 Sexiest Women of the 21st Century\" list.[351][352] VH1 listed her at number 1 on its 100 Sexiest Artists list.[353] Several wax figures of Beyoncé are found at Madame Tussauds Wax Museums in major cities around the world.[354] According to Italian fashion designer Roberto Cavalli, Beyoncé uses different fashion styles to work with her music while performing.[355] Her mother co-wrote a book, published in 2002, titled Destiny's Style,[356] an account of how fashion affected the trio's success.[357] The B'Day Anthology Video Album showed many instances of fashion-oriented footage, depicting classic to contemporary wardrobe styles.[358] In 2007, Beyoncé was featured on the cover of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue, becoming the second African American woman after model and television personality Tyra Banks,[359] and People magazine recognized Beyoncé as the best-dressed celebrity.[360] Beyoncé has been nicknamed \"Queen Bey\" by publications over the years. The term is a reference to the common phrase \"queen bee\", a term used for the leader of a group of females. The nickname also refers to the Queen bee of a beehive, with her fan base being named \"BeyHive\". BeyHive was previously titled \"The Beyontourage\", (a portmanteau of Beyoncé and entourage), but was changed after online petitions on Twitter and online news reports during competitions.[361] In 2006, the animal rights organization People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), criticized Beyoncé for wearing and using fur in her clothing line House of Deréon.[362] Emmett Price, a professor of music at Northeastern University, wrote in 2007 that he thinks race plays a role in many criticisms of Beyoncé's image, saying white celebrities who dress similarly do not attract as many comments.[363] In 2008, the French personal care company L'Oréal was accused of whitening her skin in their Feria hair color advertisements, responding that \"it is categorically untrue\",[364][365] and in 2013, Beyoncé herself criticized H&M for their proposed \"retouching\" of promotional images of her, and according to Vogue requested that only \"natural pictures be used\".[366] Beyoncé has been a vocal advocate for the Black Lives Matter movement. The release of \"Formation\" on February 6, 2016, saw her celebrate her Sub-Saharan Black African ancestry, with the song's music video featuring pro-black imagery and a shot of wall graffiti that says \"Stop shooting us\". The day after the song's release, she performed it at the 2016 Super Bowl halftime show with back up dancers dressed to represent the Black Panther Party. This incited criticism from conservative politicians and police officers, with some police boycotting Beyoncé's then upcoming Formation World Tour.[367] Beyoncé responded to the backlash by releasing tour merchandise that said \"Boycott Beyoncé\",[368][369][370] and later clarified her sentiment, saying: \"Anyone who perceives my message as anti-police is completely mistaken. I have so much admiration and respect for officers and the families of officers who sacrifice themselves to keep us safe,\" Beyoncé said. \"But let's be clear: I am against police brutality and injustice. Those are two separate things.\"[371] In 2002, Beyoncé and Jay-Z collaborated on the song \"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\",[372] which appeared on his seventh album The Blueprint 2: The Gift & The Curse (2002).[373] Beyoncé appeared as Jay-Z's girlfriend in the music video for the song, fueling speculation about their relationship.[374] On April 4, 2008, Beyoncé and Jay-Z married without publicity.[375] As of April 2014[update], the couple had sold a combined 300 million records together.[168] They are known for their private relationship, although they have appeared to become more relaxed since 2013.[376] Both have acknowledged difficulty that arose in their marriage after Jay-Z had an affair.[377][378] Beyoncé miscarried around 2010 or 2011, describing it as \"the saddest thing\" she had ever endured.[379] She returned to the studio and wrote music to cope with the loss. In April 2011, Beyoncé and Jay-Z traveled to Paris to shoot the album cover for 4, and she unexpectedly became pregnant in Paris.[380] In August, the couple attended the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, at which Beyoncé performed \"Love On Top\" and ended the performance by revealing she was pregnant.[381] Her appearance helped that year's MTV Video Music Awards become the most-watched broadcast in MTV history, pulling in 12.4 million viewers;[382] the announcement was listed in Guinness World Records for \"most tweets per second recorded for a single event\" on Twitter,[383] receiving 8,868 tweets per second[384] and \"Beyonce pregnant\" was the most Googled phrase the week of August 29, 2011.[385] On January 7, 2012, Beyoncé gave birth to a daughter, Blue Ivy, at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.[386] Following the release of Lemonade, which included the single \"Sorry\", in 2016, speculations arose about Jay-Z's alleged infidelity with a mistress referred to as \"Becky\". Jon Pareles in The New York Times pointed out that many of the accusations were \"aimed specifically and recognizably\" at him.[387] Similarly, Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone noted the lines \"Suck on my balls, I've had enough\" were an \"unmistakable hint\" that the lyrics revolve around Jay-Z.[388] On February 1, 2017, she revealed on her Instagram account that she was expecting twins. Her announcement gained over 6.3 million likes within eight hours, breaking the world record for the most liked image on the website at the time.[389] On July 13, 2017, Beyoncé uploaded the first image of herself and the twins onto her Instagram account, confirming their birth date as a month prior, on June 13, 2017,[390] with the post becoming the second most liked on Instagram, behind her own pregnancy announcement.[391] The twins, a daughter named Rumi and a son named Sir, were born at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in California via caesarean section. She wrote of her pregnancy and its aftermath in the September 2018 issue of Vogue, in which she had full control of the cover, shot at Hammerwood Park by photographer Tyler Mitchell.[392][393] Beyoncé performed \"America the Beautiful\" at President Barack Obama's 2009 presidential inauguration, as well as \"At Last\" during the first inaugural dance at the Neighborhood Ball two days later.[394] The couple held a fundraiser at Jay-Z's 40/40 Club in Manhattan for President Obama's 2012 presidential campaign[395] which raised $4 million.[396] Beyoncé voted for Obama in the 2012 presidential election.[397] She performed the American national anthem \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" at his second inauguration in January 2013.[147] The Washington Post reported in May 2015, that Beyoncé attended a major celebrity fundraiser for 2016 presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.[398] She also headlined for Clinton in a concert held the weekend before Election Day the next year. In this performance, Beyoncé and her entourage of backup dancers wore pantsuits; a clear allusion to Clinton's frequent dress-of-choice. The backup dancers also wore \"I'm with her\" tee shirts, the campaign slogan for Clinton. In a brief speech at this performance Beyoncé said, \"I want my daughter to grow up seeing a woman lead our country and knowing that her possibilities are limitless.\"[399] She endorsed the bid of Beto O'Rourke during the 2018 United States Senate election in Texas.[400] In July 2024, Beyoncé gave Vice President Kamala Harris permission to use Lemonade promotional single \"Freedom\" as the official song for her 2024 presidential campaign.[401][402] Harris subsequently launched a digital ad in support of her candidacy featuring the song.[403] In October 2024, Beyoncé, alongside her mother Tina and Kelly Rowland endorsed Harris for president at a campaign rally in her hometown of Houston.[404] In a 2013 interview with Vogue, Beyoncé stated that she considered herself to be \"a modern-day feminist\".[405] She would later align herself more publicly with the movement, sampling \"We should all be feminists\", a speech delivered by Nigerian author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie at a TEDx talk in April 2013, in her song \"Flawless\", released later that year.[406] The next year she performed live at the MTV Video Awards in front a giant backdrop reading \"Feminist\".[407] Her self-identification incited a circulation of opinions and debate about whether her feminism is aligned with older, more established feminist ideals. Annie Lennox, celebrated artist and feminist advocate, referred to Beyoncé's use of her word feminist as 'feminist lite'.[408] Adichie responded with \"her type of feminism is not mine, as it is the kind that, at the same time, gives quite a lot of space to the necessity of men.\"[409] Adichie expands upon what \"feminist lite\" means to her, referring that \"more troubling is the idea, in Feminism Lite, that men are naturally superior but should be expected to 'treat women well'\" and \"we judge powerful women more harshly than we judge powerful men. And Feminism Lite enables this.\"[410] Beyoncé responded about her intent by utilizing the definition of feminist with her platform was to \"give clarity to the true meaning\" behind it. She says to understand what being a feminist is, \"it's very simple. It's someone who believes in equal rights for men and women.\" She advocated to provide equal opportunities for young boys and girls, men and women must begin to understand the double standards that remain persistent in our societies and the issue must be illuminated in effort to start making changes.[411] She has also contributed to the Ban Bossy campaign, which uses TV and social media to encourage leadership in girls.[412] Following Beyoncé's public identification as a feminist, the sexualized nature of her performances and the fact that she championed her marriage was questioned.[413] In December 2012, Beyoncé along with a variety of other celebrities teamed up and produced a video campaign for \"Demand A Plan\", a bipartisan effort by a group of 950 U.S. mayors and others[414] designed to influence the federal government into rethinking its gun control laws, following the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.[415] Beyoncé publicly endorsed same-sex marriage on March 26, 2013, after the Supreme Court debate on California's Proposition 8.[416] She spoke against North Carolina's Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act, a bill passed (and later repealed) that discriminated against the LGBT community in public places in a statement during her concert in Raleigh as part of the Formation World Tour in 2016.[417] She has condemned police brutality against black Americans. She and Jay-Z attended a rally in 2013 in response to the acquittal of George Zimmerman for the killing of Trayvon Martin.[418] The film for her sixth album Lemonade included the mothers of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown and Eric Garner, holding pictures of their sons in the video for \"Freedom\".[419] In a 2016 interview with Elle, Beyoncé responded to the controversy surrounding her song \"Formation\" which was perceived to be critical of the police. She clarified, \"I am against police brutality and injustice. Those are two separate things. If celebrating my roots and culture during Black History Month made anyone uncomfortable, those feelings were there long before a video and long before me\".[420] In February 2017, Beyoncé spoke out against the withdrawal of protections for transgender students in public schools by Donald Trump's presidential administration. Posting a link to the 100 Days of Kindness campaign on her Facebook page, Beyoncé voiced her support for transgender youth and joined a roster of celebrities who spoke out against Trump's decision.[421] Beyoncé has been documented pursuing many passions, sometimes being described as a renaissance woman.[422][423] Some of these include canvas painting,[424] video editing,[425] poetry,[426] scriptwriting,[427] lighting and stage design,[428] animation and clothes design,[429] photography,[222] cultural historiography[430] and beekeeping (with around 80,000 bees).[337] I started painting portraits of women [in 2002], while filming Austin Powers [...] I got hooked and wouldn't sleep. I made this special room with saris and pillows. I would light candles, play Miles Davis and Björk, and paint all night. It was very therapeutic. Whenever I finish one of my paintings, I try to figure out what it represents in my life. I'll be like, 'It's dark behind her and light in front of her, so a dark period must be coming to an end. Something light and beautiful is going to happen.' Forbes magazine began reporting on Beyoncé's earnings in 2008, calculating that the $80 million earned between June 2007 to June 2008, for her music, tour, films and clothing line made her the world's best-paid music personality at the time, above Madonna and Celine Dion.[431][432] It placed her fourth on the Celebrity 100 list in 2009[433] and ninth on the \"Most Powerful Women in the World\" list in 2010.[434] The following year, the magazine placed her eighth on the \"Best-Paid Celebrities Under 30\" list, having earned $35 million in the past year for her clothing line and endorsement deals. In 2012, Forbes placed Beyoncé at number 16 on the Celebrity 100 list, twelve places lower than three years ago yet still having earned $40 million in the past year for her album 4, clothing line and endorsement deals.[435][436] In 2012, Beyoncé and Jay-Z placed at number one on the \"World's Highest-Paid Celebrity Couples\", for collectively earning $78 million.[437] The couple made it into the previous year's Guinness World Records as the \"highest-earning power couple\" for collectively earning $122 million in 2009.[438] For the years 2009 to 2011, Beyoncé earned an average of $70 million per year, and earned $40 million in 2012.[439] In 2013, Beyoncé's endorsements of Pepsi and H&M made her and Jay-Z the world's first billion-dollar couple in the music industry.[440] That year, Beyoncé was listed as the fourth-most-powerful celebrity in the Forbes rankings.[441] In June 2014, Beyoncé ranked at number one on the Forbes Celebrity 100 list, earning an estimated $115 million throughout June 2013 – June 2014. This in turn was the first time she had topped the Celebrity 100 list as well as being her highest yearly earnings to date.[442] In 2016, Beyoncé ranked at number 34 on the Celebrity 100 list with earnings of $54 million. She and Jay-Z also topped the highest-paid celebrity couple list, with combined earnings of $107.5 million.[443] Beyoncé is one of the wealthiest musical artists. As of 2018[update], Forbes calculated her net worth to be $355 million, and in June of the same year, ranked her as the 35th-highest-earning celebrity, with annual earnings of $60 million. This tied Beyoncé with Madonna as the only two female artists to earn more than $100 million within a single year twice.[444][445] As a couple, Beyoncé and Jay-Z have a combined net worth of $1.16 billion.[446] In July 2017, Billboard announced that Beyoncé was the highest-paid musician of 2016, with an estimated total of $62.1 million.[447] By December 2023, Forbes estimated Beyoncé's net worth to be $800 million.[448] In 2023, the couple bought a house in Malibu, California, designed by the architect Tadao Ando, for $200 million. It established a record for the most expensive residence sold in the state of California.[449] Beyoncé's success has led to her becoming a cultural icon and earning her the nickname \"Queen Bey\".[450] Constance Grady wrote for Vox, \"The transformation of Beyoncé from well-liked pop star to cultural icon came in three phases, punctuated by the self-titled Beyoncé album of 2013, 2016's Lemonade, and 2018's Homecoming concert at Coachella.\"[451] In The New Yorker, music critic Jody Rosen described Beyoncé as \"the most important and compelling popular musician of the twenty-first century ... the result, the logical end point, of a century-plus of pop.\"[452] She topped NPR list of the \"21st Century's Most Influential Women Musicians\".[453] James Clear, in his book Atomic Habits (2018), draws a parallel between Beyoncé's success and the dramatic transformations in modern society: \"In the last one hundred years, we have seen the rise of the car, the airplane, the television, the personal computer, the internet, the smartphone, and Beyoncé.\"[454] The Observer named her Artist of the Decade (2000s) in 2009.[455] Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Alex Suskind opined that Beyoncé was the decade's (2010s) defining pop star, stating \"no one dominated music in the 2010s like Queen Bey\", explaining that her \"songs, album rollouts, stage presence, social justice initiatives, and disruptive public relations strategy have influenced the way we've viewed music since 2010.\"[456] Based on Billboard rankings of chart success and sales, Beyonce was ranked 9th on the Top R&B and Hip Hop artists of the 2010s decade chart, behind the likes of Drake, Rihanna, Chris Brown, Nicki Minaj, Post Malone, The Weeknd, Kendrick Lamar and Lil Wayne in ranks 1 through 8, respectively.[457] British publication NME also shared similar thoughts on her impact in the 2010s, including Beyoncé on their list of the \"10 Artists Who Defined The Decade\".[458] In 2018, Rolling Stone included her on its Millennial 100 list.[459] Music critics have often credited Beyoncé with the invention of the staccato rap-singing style that has since dominated pop, R&B, and rap music. Lakin Starling of The Fader wrote that Beyoncé's innovative implementation of the delivery style on Destiny's Child's 1999 album The Writing's on the Wall invented a new form of R&B.[460] The staccato rap-singing style continued to be used in the music industry in the late 2010s and early 2020s; Aaron Williams of Uproxx described Beyoncé as the \"primary pioneer\" of the rapping style that dominates the music industry today, with many rappers implementing Beyoncé's rap-singing.[461] Michael Eric Dyson agrees, saying in 2019 that Beyoncé \"changed the whole genre\" and has become the \"godmother\" of mumble rappers, who use the staccato rap-singing cadence. Dyson added: \"She doesn't get credit for the remarkable way in which she changed the musical vocabulary of contemporary art.\"[462] Beyoncé has been credited with reviving the album as an art form in an era dominated by singles and streaming. This started with her 2011 album 4; while mainstream R&B artists were forgoing albums-led R&B in favor of singles-led EDM, Beyoncé aimed to place the focus back on albums as an art form and re-establish R&B as a mainstream concern.[463] This remained a focus of Beyoncé's, and in 2013, she made her eponymous album only available to purchase as a full album on iTunes, rather than being able to purchase individual tracks or consume the album via streaming. Kaitlin Menza of Marie Claire wrote that this made listeners \"experience the album as one whole sonic experience, the way people used to, noting the musical and lyrical themes\".[464] Jamieson Cox for The Verge described how Beyoncé's 2013 album initiated a gradual trend of albums becoming more cohesive and self-referential, and this phenomenon reached its endpoint with Lemonade, which set \"a new standard for pop storytelling at the highest possible scale\".[465] Megan Carpentier of The Guardian wrote that with Lemonade, Beyoncé has \"almost revived the album format\" by releasing an album that can only be listened to in its entirety.[466] Myf Warhurst on Double J's \"Lunch With Myf\" explained that while most artists' albums consist of a few singles plus filler songs, Beyoncé \"brought the album back\", changing the art form of the album \"to a narrative with an arc and a story and you have to listen to the entire thing to get the concept\".[467] She is known for coining popular phrases such as \"put a ring on it\", a euphemism for marriage proposal, \"I woke up like this\", which started a trend of posting morning selfies with the hashtag #iwokeuplikethis, and \"boy, bye\", which was used as part of the Democratic National Committee's campaign for the 2020 election.[468][469] Similarly, she also came up with the phrase \"visual album\" following the release of her fifth studio album, which had a video for every song. This has been recreated by many other artists since, such as Frank Ocean and Melanie Martinez.[470] The album also popularized surprise releases, with many artists releasing songs, videos or albums with no prior announcement, such as Taylor Swift, Nicki Minaj, Eminem, Frank Ocean, Jay-Z and Drake.[471] In January 2012, research scientist Bryan Lessard named Scaptia beyonceae, a species of horse-fly found in Northern Queensland, Australia after Beyoncé due to the fly's unique golden hairs on its abdomen.[472] Beyoncé has received numerous awards and is the most-awarded female artist of all time.[473] Having sold over 200 million records worldwide (a further 60 million additionally with Destiny's Child), Beyoncé is one of the best-selling music artists of all time.[474] The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) listed Beyoncé as the top certified artist of the 2000s decade, with a total of 64 certifications.[475][476] In 2009, Billboard named her the Top Female Artist and Top Radio Songs Artist of the Decade.[477][478][479] In 2010, Billboard named her in their Top 50 R&B/Hip-Hop Artists of the Past 25 Years list at number 15.[480] In 2012, VH1 ranked her third on their list of the \"100 Greatest Women in Music\", behind Mariah Carey and Madonna.[481] In 2002, she received Songwriter of the Year from American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers becoming the First African American woman to win the award. In 2004 and 2019, she received NAACP Image Award for Entertainer of the Year and the Soul Train Music Award for Sammy Davis Jr. – Entertainer of the Year. In 2005, she also received APEX Award at the Trumpet Award honoring the achievements of Black African Americans. In 2007, Beyoncé received the International Artist of Excellence award by the American Music Awards. She also received Honorary Otto at the Bravo Otto. The following year, she received the Legend Award for Outstanding Contribution to the Arts at the World Music Awards[482] and Career Achievement Award at the LOS40 Music Awards. In 2010, she received the Award of Honor for Artist of the Decade at the NRJ Music Award.[483] At the 2011 Billboard Music Awards, Beyoncé received the inaugural Billboard Millennium Award.[484] Beyoncé received the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award at the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards and was honored as Honorary Mother of the Year at the Australian Mother of the Year Award in Barnardo's Australia for her Humanitarian Effort in the region and the Council of Fashion Designers of America Fashion Icon Award in 2016. In 2019, alongside Jay-Z, she received GLAAD Vanguard Award which is presented to a member of the entertainment community who does not identify as LGBT but who has made a significant difference in promoting equal rights for LGBT people.[485] In 2020, she was awarded the BET Humanitarian Award. Consequence named her the 30th best singer of all time.[486] Beyoncé has won 32 Grammy Awards, both as a solo artist and member of Destiny's Child and The Carters, making her the most honored individual by the Grammys.[487][488] She is also the most nominated artist in Grammy Award history with a total of 88 nominations.[489] \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\" won Song of the Year in 2010 while \"Say My Name\",[47] \"Crazy in Love\" and \"Drunk in Love\" have each won Best R&B Song.

Parkwood Entertainment is named after a street in Houston, Texas where Beyoncé once lived.[512] With headquarters in New York City, the company serves as an umbrella for the entertainer's various brands in music, movies, videos, and fashion. The staff of Parkwood Entertainment have experiences in arts and entertainment, from filmmaking and video production to web and fashion design. In addition to departments in marketing, digital, creative, publicity, fashion design and merchandising, the company houses a state-of-the-art editing suite, where Beyoncé works on content for her worldwide tours, music videos, and television specials. Parkwood Entertainment's first production was the musical biopic Cadillac Records (2008), in which Beyoncé starred and co-produced.[513] The company has distributed Beyoncé's albums such as her self-titled fifth studio album (2013), Lemonade (2016) and The Carters, Everything is Love (2018). Beyoncé has signed other artists to Parkwood such as Chloe x Halle, who performed at Super Bowl LIII in February 2019.[514] In February 2024, Beyoncé launched Cécred, a hair care product line developed to fit different hair textures.[255] Following its launch, she established an annual grant in collaboration with BeyGood. This is an effort to provide financial support to cosmetology students and professional hair stylists within the beauty industry.[515] A yearly $500,000 is funding cosmetology school scholarships and salon business grants across five cities chosen for their large, diverse community of hair stylists: Atlanta, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles and Clementon.[c][516] Beyoncé has worked with Pepsi since 2002,[517] and in 2004 appeared in a Gladiator-themed commercial with Britney Spears, Pink, and Enrique Iglesias.[518] In 2012, Beyoncé signed a $50 million deal to endorse Pepsi.[519] The Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPINET) wrote Beyoncé an open letter asking her to reconsider the deal because of the unhealthiness of the product and to donate the proceeds to a medical organisation.[520] Nevertheless, NetBase found that Beyoncé's campaign was the most talked about endorsement in April 2013, with a 70 percent positive audience response to the commercial and print ads.[521] Beyoncé has worked with Tommy Hilfiger for the fragrances True Star (singing a cover version of \"Wishing on a Star\")[522] and True Star Gold;[523] she also promoted Emporio Armani's Diamonds fragrance in 2007.[524] Beyoncé launched her first official fragrance, Heat, in 2010.[525] In February 2011, Beyoncé launched her second fragrance, Heat Rush.[526] Beyoncé's third fragrance, Pulse, was launched in September 2011.[527] In 2013, The Mrs. Carter Show Limited Edition version of Heat was released.[528] The six editions of Heat are the world's best-selling celebrity fragrance line,[528] with sales of over $400 million.[529] The release of a video-game Starpower: Beyoncé was cancelled after Beyoncé pulled out of a $100 million deal with GateFive who alleged the cancellation meant the sacking of 70 staff and millions of pounds lost in development.[530] It was settled out of court by her lawyers in June 2013 who said that they had cancelled because GateFive had lost its financial backers.[531] Beyoncé also has had deals with American Express,[432] Nintendo DS[532] and L'Oréal since the age of 18.[533] In March 2015, Beyoncé became a co-owner, with other artists, of the music streaming service Tidal. The service specializes in lossless audio and high definition music videos. Beyoncé's husband Jay-Z acquired the parent company of Tidal, Aspiro, in the first quarter of 2015.[534] Including Beyoncé and Jay-Z, sixteen artist stakeholders (such as Kanye West, Rihanna, Madonna, Chris Martin, Nicki Minaj and more) co-own Tidal, with the majority owning a 3% equity stake.[535] The idea of having an all artist owned streaming service was created by those involved to adapt to the increased demand for streaming within the current music industry.[536] In November 2020, Beyoncé formed a multi-year partnership with exercise equipment and media company Peloton. The partnership was formed to celebrate homecoming season in historically black colleges and universities, providing themed workout experiences inspired by Beyoncé's 2019 Homecoming film and live album after 2020's homecoming celebrations were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of the partnership, Beyoncé and Peloton are donating free memberships to all students at 10 HBCUs, and Peloton are pursuing long-term recruiting partnerships at the HCBUs. Gwen Bethel Riley, head of music at Peloton, said: \"When we had conversations with Beyoncé around how critical a social impact component was to all of us, it crystallized how important it was to embrace Homecoming as an opportunity to celebrate and create dialogue around Black culture and music, in partnership with HBCUs.\"[537] Upon news of the partnership, a decline in Peloton's shares reversed, and its shares rose by 8.6%.[538] In 2021, Beyoncé and Jay-Z partnered with Tiffany & Co. for the company's \"About Love\" campaign. Beyoncé became the fourth woman, and first Black woman, to wear the 128.54-carat Tiffany Yellow Diamond.[539] The campaign featured a robin egg blue painting by Jean-Michel Basquiat titled Equals Pi (1982).[540] Both Beyonce and the brand faced significant backlash for the campaign, as the Tiffany Yellow Diamond, which was discovered in the Kimberley diamond mines in South Africa in 1877, is classified as a blood diamond and viewed as a symbol of British colonialism over Africa.[541][542][543] Beyoncé and her mother introduced House of Deréon, a women's fashion line, in 2005.[544] The concept is inspired by three generations of women in their family, with the name paying tribute to Beyoncé's grandmother, Agnèz Deréon, a respected seamstress.[545][546] According to Tina, the overall style of the line best reflects her and Beyoncé's taste and style. Beyoncé and her mother founded their family's company Beyond Productions, which provides the licensing and brand management for House of Deréon, and its junior collection, Deréon.[544] House of Deréon pieces were exhibited in Destiny's Child's shows and tours, during their Destiny Fulfilled era.[547][548] The collection features sportswear, denim offerings with fur, outerwear and accessories that include handbags and footwear, and are available at department and specialty stores across the U.S. and Canada.[544] In 2005, Beyoncé teamed up with House of Brands, a shoe company, to produce a range of footwear for House of Deréon.[549] In January 2008, Starwave Mobile launched Beyoncé Fashion Diva, a \"high-style\" mobile game with a social networking component, featuring the House of Deréon collection.[544] In July 2009, Beyoncé and her mother launched a new junior apparel label, Sasha Fierce for Deréon, for back-to-school selling. The collection included sportswear, outerwear, handbags, footwear, eyewear, lingerie and jewelry.[550] It was available at department stores including Macy's and Dillard's, and specialty stores Jimmy Jazz and Against All Odds.[550] In May 2010, Beyoncé teamed up with clothing store C&A to launch Deréon by Beyoncé at their stores in Brazil.[551] The collection included tailored blazers with padded shoulders, little black dresses, embroidered tops and shirts and bandage dresses.[551] In October 2014, Beyoncé signed a deal to launch an activewear line of clothing with British fashion retailer Topshop.[552][553] The 50–50 venture is called Ivy Park and was launched in April 2016. The brand's name is a nod to Beyoncé's daughter and her favorite number four (IV in Roman numerals), and also references the park where she used to run in Texas.[554] She has since bought out Topshop owner Philip Green from his 50% share after he was alleged to have sexually harassed, bullied and racially abused employees.[555] She now owns the brand herself.[556] In April 2019, it was announced that Beyoncé would become a creative partner with Adidas and further develop her athletic brand Ivy Park with the company. Knowles will also develop new clothes and footwear for Adidas. Shares for the company rose 1.3% upon the news release.[557] In December 2019, they announced a launch date of January 18, 2020.[558] Beyoncé uploaded a teaser on her website and Instagram.[559] The collection was previewed on the upcoming Elle January 2020 issue, where Beyoncé is seen wearing several garments, accessories and footwear from the first collection.[560] In February 2023, The Wall Street Journal reported that the line was struggling financially with revenue falling by more than 50% over the past fiscal year to $40 million; well short of the company's $250 million projected forecast.[561] In March 2023, it was announced that Beyoncé and Adidas reached a mutual decision to end their partnership.[562][563] In March 2023, Olivier Rousteing, the creative director of Balmain, announced that he and Beyoncé collaborated on a couture collection complete with sixteen looks corresponding to the sixteen tracks on her album Renaissance. This \"Renaissance Couture\" collection marked the first time that a Black woman oversaw the development of a collection from a Parisian couture house.[564] In September 2024, Beyoncé partnered with Levi Strauss & Co. to remake a classic '80s 'Launderette' campaign.[565] Michelle Gass, the CEO of Levis Strauss & Co., shared insights regarding the advantages of the company's collaboration with Beyoncé, emphasizing that the advertising campaign could significantly enhance sales in the women's clothing segment.[566] In 2002, Beyoncé, Kelly Rowland and Tina Knowles built the Knowles-Rowland Center for Youth, a community center in Downtown Houston. After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Beyoncé and Rowland founded the Survivor Foundation to provide transitional housing to displaced families and provide means for new building construction, to which Beyoncé contributed an initial $250,000.[567] The foundation has since expanded to work with other charities in the city,[568] and also provided relief following Hurricane Ike three years later.[569] Beyoncé also donated $100,000 to the Gulf Coast Ike Relief Fund.[570] In 2007, Beyoncé founded the Knowles-Temenos Place Apartments, a housing complex offering living space for 43 displaced individuals. As of 2016, Beyoncé had donated $7 million for the maintenance of the complex.[571] After starring in Cadillac Records in 2009 and learning about Phoenix House, a non-profit drug and alcohol rehabilitation organization, Beyoncé donated her full $4 million salary from the film to the organization. Beyoncé and her mother subsequently established the Beyoncé Cosmetology Center, which offers a seven-month cosmetology training course helping Phoenix House's clients gain career skills during their recovery.[572] In January 2010, Beyoncé participated in George Clooney and Wyclef Jean's Hope for Haiti Now: A Global Benefit for Earthquake Relief telethon,[573] donated a large sum to the organization,[574] and was named the official face of the limited edition Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) \"Fashion For Haiti\" T-shirt.[575] In April 2011, Beyoncé joined forces with U.S. First Lady Michelle Obama and the National Association of Broadcasters Education Foundation, to help boost the latter's campaign against child obesity[576] by reworking her single \"Get Me Bodied\".[577] Following the death of Osama bin Laden, Beyoncé released her cover of the Lee Greenwood song \"God Bless the U.S.A.\", as a charity single to help raise funds for the New York Police and Fire Widows' and Children's Benefit Fund.[578] Beyoncé became an ambassador for the 2012 World Humanitarian Day campaign donating her song \"I Was Here\" and its music video, shot in the UN, to the campaign.[579][580] In 2013, it was announced that Beyoncé would work with Salma Hayek and Frida Giannini on a Gucci \"Chime for Change\" campaign that aims to spread female empowerment. The campaign, which aired on February 28, was set to her new music.[581] A concert for the cause took place on June 1, 2013, in London.[582] With help of the crowdfunding platform Catapult, visitors of the concert could choose between several projects promoting education of women and girls.[583][584] Beyoncé also took part in \"Miss a Meal\", a food-donation campaign,[585] and supported Goodwill Industries through online charity auctions at Charitybuzz that support job creation throughout Europe and the U.S.[586][587] Beyoncé and Jay-Z secretly donated tens of thousands of dollars to bail out Black Lives Matter protesters in Baltimore and Ferguson, as well as funded infrastructure for the establishment of Black Lives Matter chapters across the U.S.[588] Before Beyoncé's Formation World Tour show in Tampa, her team held a private luncheon for more than 20 community leaders to discuss how Beyoncé could support local charitable initiatives, including pledging on the spot to fund 10 scholarships to provide students with financial aid. Tampa Sports Authority board member Thomas Scott said: \"I don't know of a prior artist meeting with the community, seeing what their needs are, seeing how they can invest in the community. It says a lot to me about Beyoncé. She not only goes into a community and walks away with (money), but she also gives money back to that community.\"[589] In June 2016, Beyoncé donated over $82,000 to the United Way of Genesee County to support victims of the Flint water crisis. Beyoncé additionally donated money to support 14 students in Michigan with their college expenses.[590] In August 2016, Beyoncé and Jay-Z donated $1.5 million to civil rights groups including Black Lives Matter, Hands Up United and Dream Defenders.[591] After Hurricane Matthew, Beyoncé and Jay-Z donated $15 million to the Usain Bolt Foundation to support its efforts in rebuilding homes in Haiti.[592] During Hurricane Harvey in August 2017, Beyoncé launched BeyGOOD Houston to support those affected by the hurricane in Houston. The organization donated necessities such as cots, blankets, pillows, baby products, feminine products and wheelchairs, and funded long-term revitalization projects.[593] On September 8, Beyoncé visited Houston, where she sponsored a lunch for 400 survivors at her local church, visited the George R Brown Convention Center to discuss with people displaced by the flooding about their needs, served meals to those who lost their homes, and made a significant donation to local causes.[594][595] Beyoncé additionally donated $75,000 worth of new mattresses to survivors of the hurricane.[596] Later that month, Beyoncé released a remix of J Balvin and Willy William's \"Mi Gente\", with all of her proceeds being donated to disaster relief charities in Puerto Rico, Mexico, the U.S. and the Caribbean after hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, and the Chiapas and Puebla earthquakes.[597] In April 2020, Beyoncé donated $6 million to the National Alliance in Mental Health, UCLA and local community-based organizations in order to provide mental health and personal wellness services to essential workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Other sources state that she possesses a contralto vocal range at age of 30s. Jon Pareles of The New York Times commented that her voice is \"velvety yet tart, with an insistent flutter and reserves of soul belting\". Jody Rosen notes that the hip hop era highly influenced Knowles' unique rhythmic vocal style, but also finds her quite traditionalist in her use of balladry, gospel and falsetto. Her first role in a movie was for the musical Carmen: A Hip Hopera (2001). Her first major movie was Austin Powers in Goldmember (2002). The movie Dreamgirls (2006) was nominated for two Golden Globe Awards. Her other movies Cadillac Records (2008) and Obsessed (2009) did not do so well.

She has sold more than 30.4 million digital singles as of January 2012.[24] Worldwide, she has sold 245 million records. This makes her one of the best-selling music artists of all time.[25] Knowles appeared on [VH1]'s 2010 list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\".[26] They ranked her third on their \"100 Greatest Women in Music\" list in 2012.

On January 7, 2012, she gave birth to their first daughter, Blue Ivy Carter, via natural birth in Lennox Hill Hospital, New York. Knowles is a feminist. In the February 2013 issue of GQ magazine she said, \"You know, equality is a myth, and for some reason, everyone accepts the fact that women don’t make as much money as men do. I don’t understand that. Why do we have to take a backseat? I truly believe that women should be financially independent from their men. And let’s face it, money gives men the power to run the show. It gives men the power to define value. They define what’s sexy. And men define what’s feminine. It’s ridiculous.\"[27] Knowles joined the Ban Bossy campaign in 2014.[28] In December 2013, it was revealed that she and her husband Jay-Z were longtime vegans.[29] She wrote the foreword to the book The 22-Day Revolution by trainer Marco Borges, which was released in April 2015.[30] On February 1, 2017, Knowles announced via Instagram that she was expecting twins.[31] She gave birth to a daughter, Rumi and a son, Sir on June 13, 2017 via cesarean section.[32][33]",

Their eldest daughter was born in 2012 and is named Blue Ivy. Their twins, a boy and a girl, were born in 2017 and are named Sir and Rumi, respectively.

Her hit solo albums included Dangerously in Love (2003), B’Day (2006), I Am…Sasha Fierce (2008), 4 (2011), Beyoncé (2013), and Lemonade (2016). By 2019 Beyoncé had won 23 Grammy Awards and was the most-nominated female artist in Grammy history, with 62 nominations. She first won the award as a member of the R&B group Destiny’s Child in 2000. Beyoncé (born September 4, 1981, Houston, Texas, U.S.) is an American singer-songwriter and actress who achieved fame in the late 1990s as the lead singer of the R&B group Destiny’s Child and then launched a hugely successful solo career.

Beyoncé was born Beyoncé Giselle Knowles to Tina (née Beyoncé) and Mathew Knowles (divorced 2011). She has a younger sister, Solange, who also became a successful recording artist. At age nine Beyoncé formed the singing-rapping girl group Destiny’s Child (originally called Girl’s Tyme) in 1990 with childhood friends. In 1992 the group lost on the Star Search television talent show, and three years later it was dropped from a recording contract before an album had been released. In 1997 Destiny’s Child’s fortunes reversed with a Columbia recording contract and then an eponymous debut album that yielded the hit single “No, No, No Part 2.” Its follow-up album, The Writing’s on the Wall (1999), earned the group two Grammy Awards and sold more than eight million copies in the United States. Survivor (2001), the group’s third album, reached the number one spot on the Billboard 200 chart. By this time the group’s lineup, which had seen several personnel changes, was composed of Beyoncé, Kelly Rowland, and Michelle Williams. With her powerful voice and charisma, Beyoncé was clearly the leader of the group and wrote hit songs for Destiny’s Child, such as the saucy “Bootylicious.” Eventually, the group parted ways to pursue individual projects. Beyoncé used her songwriting talents to pen her first solo album, Dangerously in Love (2003). The album debuted to rave reviews, and, aided by the exuberant single “Crazy in Love,” which features rapper Jay-Z, it topped charts around the world. In 2004 Beyoncé won five Grammy Awards, including best contemporary R&B album and best female R&B vocal performance. Destiny’s Child reunited in 2004 to release Destiny Fulfilled. While generally not as acclaimed as the group’s previous efforts, the album sold more than seven million copies worldwide and spawned several hit singles. The trio embarked on a world tour in 2005, during which they announced that the group would officially disband. That same year they released #1’s, a collection of well-known songs and number one hits. In 2006 Beyoncé released her second solo studio album, B’Day, which features several coproducers, including the hit-making duo the Neptunes. Although much of the album carried echoes of 1970s-style funk, the pop ballad “Irreplaceable” became its most successful single. In 2008 she and Jay-Z married, and the union made them one of the top-earning couples in the entertainment industry. Later that year Beyoncé released the double album I Am…Sasha Fierce. Whereas the first half (I Am) captures an introspective mood, the second (Sasha Fierce) contains songs better suited to the dance floor. The album as a whole generated several hits, including the assertive “Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It),” and it contributed to Beyoncé’s dominance of the 2010 Grammy Awards. Her six awards, which included those for song of the year, best female pop vocal performance, and best contemporary R&B album, amounted to the most Grammys collected by a female artist in a single night. (The record was matched by pop singer Adele in 2012.) Days after a triumphant headlining performance at England’s Glastonbury Festival, Beyoncé released 4 (2011), a genre-bending mix of ballads and dance tracks that evokes influences ranging from Motown-era torch songs to the audio collages of rapper M.I.A. In early 2013 Destiny’s Child reunited for a halftime appearance at the Super Bowl and released a new song, “Nuclear.” Shortly thereafter Beyoncé collected a Grammy for her single “Love on Top.” She returned later in the year with the confidently sensuous and expressive Beyoncé, which boasts brand-name producers and appearances from, among others, the Nigerian author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie and the singer’s toddler daughter, Blue Ivy. The record, initially offered exclusively on iTunes, was promoted as a “visual album,” with music videos made to accompany each track. The single “Drunk in Love,” which features Jay-Z, was awarded several Grammys, including best R&B song. On the expansive and musically variegated Lemonade (2016), Beyoncé focused on themes of betrayal and perseverance. Conceived as another visual album, it debuted as an HBO television special. Lemonade attracted considerable acclaim, and it netted Beyoncé two Grammys, including a best music-video award for the anthemic “Formation.” In 2018 Beyoncé and Jay-Z released a collaborative album, Everything Is Love, credited to the Carters, and it took the Grammy for best urban contemporary album. That same year Beyoncé became the first Black woman to headline the Coachella Valley Festival in Indio, California. Her highly acclaimed performance, which featured marching bands from historically Black colleges, was the subject of Homecoming, a Netflix documentary and live album released in 2019. Although Beyoncé worked on a number of projects between studio albums, fans were left waiting for a new solo album. In 2022 she finally delivered with act i: RENAISSANCE. It received four Grammys, including best dance/electronic music album, and with those awards, Beyoncé surpassed classical music conductor Georg Solti for the most Grammy wins (32). Her world concert tour in 2023 broke the record, previously held by Madonna, for the highest grossing concert tour by a female artist. It also broke the record for the highest grossing tour of all time, until it was surpassed by Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour, which began in 2023. In February 2024 Beyoncé appeared in a commercial during the Super Bowl telecast to announce that she was releasing new music. Immediately after the game, she dropped two singles, “Texas Hold ’Em” and “16 Carriages,” on the music streaming service Tidal. Both songs feature a country music sound, leading her fans to guess that her new album, which she teased right after the Super Bowl on her Instagram page, would be a country album. The following month she revealed the album’s name, Cowboy Carter, confirming her fans’ guess. In the meantime, “Texas Hold ’Em” went to number one on the Billboard country chart, marking the first time in history that a Black woman had topped that chart. It was not her first foray into country music; in 2016 she performed her song “Daddy Lessons” with the Dixie Chicks (now known as the Chicks) at the Country Music Awards. In another Instagram post, Beyoncé revealed that the backlash she received after that performance spurred her to “dive into the history of Country music” as a future project. She also asserted, “This ain’t a Country album. This is a ‘Beyoncé album.’ ” The album’s release in late March prompted a long-overdue discourse about the African American roots of country music. Cowboy Carter’s impressive roster of guest artists includes singers Miley Cyrus and Linda Martell, folk musician Rhiannon Giddens, and singer-songwriters Dolly Parton and Willie Nelson. Parton’s classic song “Jolene” is reimagined with new lyrics by Beyoncé, and country singer Tanner Adell is among several vocalists who join in on a cover of the Beatles’ “Blackbird.” In 2001 Beyoncé made her acting debut in the television movie Carmen: A Hip Hopera, which aired on MTV. Her role as Foxxy Cleopatra in Austin Powers in Goldmember (2002) made her a film star and led to parts in The Fighting Temptations (2003) and The Pink Panther (2006). In 2006 she played Deena Jones in Dreamgirls, the film adaptation of the 1981 Broadway musical about a 1960s singing group. Beyoncé’s performance was nominated for a Golden Globe Award and her song “Listen” for an Academy Award. She later starred in Cadillac Records (2008), in which she portrayed singer Etta James, and the thriller Obsessed (2009) before providing the voice of a fairylike forest queen in the animated Epic (2013). For the 2019 remake of Disney’s The Lion King, Beyoncé voiced the character of Nala and performed several songs on the soundtrack, including “Spirit,” an original song she cowrote, and a rendition of “Can You Feel the Love Tonight.” She also concurrently released an album inspired by the movie, The Lion King: The Gift. Songs from that record were later featured in the visual album Black Is King (2020), which aired on the streaming service Disney+. For the single “Black Parade,” Beyoncé earned the Grammy for best R&B performance in 2021. That year she received three other awards to set the record for most Grammys (28) won by a female artist, surpassing bluegrass musician and singer Alison Krauss. Beyoncé later cowrote and performed “Be Alive” for the film King Richard (2021), and it received an Oscar nomination for best original song.",

                "title": "Nosferatu (word) - Wikipedia",
                "content": "\"Nosferatu\" has been presented as an archaic Romanian word[1] synonymous with \"vampire\". It was largely popularized in the late 19th and early 20th centuries by Western fiction such as the gothic novel Dracula (1897) and the German expressionist film Nosferatu (1922). One of the suggested etymologies of the term is that it is derived from the Romanian Nesuferitu (\"the offensive one\" or \"the insufferable one\"). The etymology of the word nosferatu is undetermined. There is no doubt that it achieved currency through Bram Stoker's 1897 novel Dracula and its unauthorised first cinematic adaptation, Nosferatu (1922). Stoker identified his source for the term as 19th-century British author and speaker Emily Gerard. It is commonly thought that Gerard introduced the word into print in an 1885 magazine article, \"Transylvanian Superstitions\",[2] and in her travelogue The Land Beyond the Forest[3] (\"Transylvania\" is Latin for \"[the land] across/beyond the forest\"). She merely refers to \"Nosferatu\" as the Romanian word for vampire:[4] More decidedly evil, however, is the vampire, or nosferatu, in which every Romanian peasant believes as firmly as he does in heaven or hell. There are two sorts of vampires-—living and dead. The living vampire is in general the illegitimate offspring of two illegitimate persons, but even a flawless pedigree will not ensure anyone against the intrusion of a vampire into his family vault, since every person killed by a nosferatu becomes likewise a vampire after death, and will continue to suck the blood of other innocent people till the spirit has been exorcised, either by opening the grave of the person suspected and driving a stake through the corpse, or firing a pistol shot into the coffin. In very obstinate cases it is further recommended to cut off the head and replace it in the coffin with the mouth filled with garlic, or to extract the heart and burn it, strewing the ashes over the grave.[2] However, the word had already appeared in an 1865 German-language article by Wilhelm Schmidt.[5] Schmidt's article discusses Transylvanian customs and appeared in an Austro-Hungarian magazine, which Gerard could have encountered as a reviewer of German literature living in Austria-Hungary. Schmidt's article also mentions the legendary Scholomance by name, which parallels Gerard's \"Transylvanian Superstitions\".[2] Schmidt does not identify the language explicitly, but he puts the word nosferatu in a typeface which indicates it to be a language other than German. Schmidt's description is unambiguous in identifying nosferatu as a \"Vampyr\". At this point, I come to the vampire – nosferatu. It is this, the illegitimate offspring of two illegitimately begotten people or the unfortunate spirit of one killed by a vampire, who can appear in the form of dog, cat, toad, frog, louse, flea, bug, in any form, in short, and plays his evil tricks on newly engaged couples as incubus or succubus – zburatorul – by name, just like the Old Slavonic or Bohemian Blkodlak [sic], Vukodlak or Polish Mora and Russian Kikimora. That which was believed about this and used as a defense[6] more than 100 years ago is still true today, and there can hardly dare to be a village which would not be in a position to present a personal experience or at least hearsay with firm conviction of the veracity.[7] Schmidt expanded on his 1865 article in an 1866 monograph, adding the observation that the vampire was the \"uncanniest spawn of national-slavic fantasy\" and that his description was the Romanian perception.[8] However, nosferatu in that form does not appear to be a standard word in any known historical phase of Romanian (aside from that introduced by the novel and the films).[9] Internal evidence in Dracula suggests that Stoker believed the term meant \"not dead\" in Romanian, and thus he may have intended the word undead to be its calque.[10] Peter Haining identifies an earlier source for nosferatu as Roumanian Superstitions (1861) by Heinrich von Wlislocki.[11] However, Wlislocki seems only to have written in German, and according to the Magyar Néprajzi Lexikon, Wlislocki was born in 1856 (d. 1907), which makes his authorship of an English-titled 1861 source doubtful. Certain details of Haining's citation also conflict with David J. Skal,[9] so this citation seems unreliable. Skal identifies a similar reference to the word \"nosferat\" in an article by Wlislocki dating from 1896.[12] Since this postdates Gerard and has a number of parallels to Gerard's work, Skal considers it likely that Wlislocki is derivative from Gerard. There is also evidence to suggest that Haining derived his citation for Roumanian Superstitions from a confused reading of an extract in Ernest Jones's book, On the Nightmare (1931).[13] Wlislocki's later description of \"der Nosferat\" is more extensive than either Schmidt's or Gerard's. The former two German-language sources particularly emphasize the dual role of the creature as both blood-drinker and incubus/succubus. Wlislocki's nosferat is said to drink the blood of older people, while seeking to have sexual intercourse with young people and especially newlyweds, often being blamed for illegitimate children (who become moroi), impotence, and infertility. From the description by Wlislocki, who was a half-Saxon native of Kronstadt (Hungarian Brassó, Romanian Brașov, one of Saxon Transylvania's \"seven cities\"), it is difficult not to get the impression that both the term and the idea must have been quite well known in his community, which makes the inability to confirm its existence in Romanian literature rather puzzling. One proposed etymology of nosferatu is that the term originally came from the Greek nosophoros (Greek: νοσοφόρος), meaning \"disease-bearing\".[14] F. W. Murnau's film Nosferatu (1922) strongly emphasizes this theme of disease, and Murnau's creative direction in the film may have been influenced by this etymology (or vice versa).[15] There are several difficulties with this etymology. Schmidt, Gerard, and Wlislocki, all three sometime residents of Transylvania, identified the word as Romanian, and even proponents of the \"nosophoros\" etymology (as well as most other commentators) seem to have little doubt that this is correct; Wlislocki particularly was regarded as an expert in Transylvanian languages and folklore and was a prolific author on the subjects. Curiously, in Wlislocki's 1896 article, he presents a parenthetical analysis of the related Romanian term solomonar but has nothing to say regarding the origin and connections of the term nosferat, despite having normalized the spelling of both relative to Schmidt's earlier account. If this Romanian identification is taken to be correct, the first objection to the \"nosophoros\" etymology is that Romanian is a Romance language. While Romanian does have some words borrowed from Greek, as do most European languages, Greek is generally considered to be only a minor contributor to the Romanian vocabulary—absent any other information, any given Romanian word is much more likely to be of Latin origin than Greek. Second, the word appears to be quite rare in Greek. One instance of a Greek word similar to νοσοφόρος, νοσηφόρος (\"nosēphoros\"), is attested in fragments from a 2nd-century AD work by Marcellus Sidetes on medicine plus another of the Ionic dialect variant νουσοφόρος (\"nousophoros\") from the Palatine Anthology.[16] These two variant forms are subsumed as examples of the main νοσοφόρος lemma in the definitive Liddel-Scott Greek–English Lexicon, but examples of the normalized form itself seem to be lacking. In any event, supporting evidence for a relationship between this rare and obscure Greek term and nosferatu appears weak. In some versions of the \"nosophoros\" etymology, an intermediate form *nesufur-atu,[15] or sometimes *nosufur-atu is presented[14] but both the original source for this and the justification for it are unclear. This form is often indicated to be Slavonic or Slavic. It is likely that either Old Church Slavonic or the protolanguage Proto-Slavic is intended. As with νοσοφόρος, this supposed Slavonic word does not appear to be attested in primary sources, which severely undermines the credibility of the argument. Another common etymology suggests that the word meant \"not breathing\", which appears to be attempting to read a derivative of the Latin verb spirare (\"to breathe\") as a second morpheme in nosferatu, with the closest hypothetical Romanian word being *nuspirândul. Skal notes that this is \"without basis in lexicography\", viewing all these etymologies (including the widely repeated nosophoros etymology) with skepticism.[9] A final possibility is that the form given by Gerard and the German folklorists is a well-known Romanian term without the benefit of normalized spelling, or possibly a misinterpretation of the sounds of the word due to Gerard's limited familiarity with the language, or possibly a dialectal variant of the word. The standardization of Romanian was rather incomplete in the 19th century, as can be seen in Dictionariulu Limbei Romane of 1871, which in a highly Latinized orthography defines incubu (\"incubus\") as \"unu spiritu necuratu\" compared to the modern standard \"un spirit necurat\". Three candidate words that have been put forth are necurat (\"unclean\", usually associated with the occult, compare a avea un spirit necurat, to have an evil spirit, be possessed),[dubious – discuss][17][18] nesuferit[dubious – discuss],[9] and nefârtat (\"enemy\", lit. \"unbrothered\").[19] The nominative masculine definite form of a Romanian noun in the declension to which these words belong takes the ending \"-ul\" or even the shortened \"u\", as in Romanian \"l\" is usually lost in the process of speaking, so the definite forms nefârtatu, necuratu and nesuferitu are commonly encountered.",

                "content": "Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror (German: Nosferatu – Eine Symphonie des Grauens) is a 1922 silent German Expressionist vampire film directed by F. W. Murnau and starring Max Schreck as Count Orlok, a vampire who preys on the wife (Greta Schröder) of his estate agent (Gustav von Wangenheim) and brings the plague to their town. Nosferatu was produced by Prana Film and is an unauthorized and unofficial adaptation of Bram Stoker's 1897 novel Dracula. Various names and other details were changed from the novel, including Count Dracula being renamed Count Orlok then finally Nosferatu, an archaic Romanian word with a suggested etymology of Nesuferitu`, meaning \"the offensive one\" or \"the insufferable one\". Although those changes are often represented as a defense against copyright infringement,[3] the original German intertitles acknowledged Dracula as the source. Film historian David Kalat states in his commentary track that since the film was \"a low-budget film made by Germans for German audiences... setting it in Germany with German-named characters makes the story more tangible and immediate for German-speaking viewers\".[4] Even with several details altered, Stoker's heirs sued over the adaptation, and a court ruling ordered all copies of the film to be destroyed. However, several prints of Nosferatu survived,[1] and the film came to be regarded as an influential masterpiece of cinema and the horror genre.[5][6] Critic and historian Kim Newman declared it as a film that set the template for the genre of horror film.[7] In 1838, in the fictional German town of Wisborg,[1][8] Thomas Hutter is sent to Transylvania by his employer, estate agent Herr Knock, to visit a new client, Count Orlok, who is planning on buying a house across from Hutter's own residence. While embarking on his journey, Hutter stops at an inn in which the locals are frightened by the mere mention of Orlok's name. Hutter rides on a coach to Orlok's castle in the Carpathian Mountains, where he is welcomed by Orlok himself. When he is eating dinner and accidentally cuts his thumb, Orlok tries to suck the blood out, but his repulsed guest pulls his hand away. Hutter wakes up the morning after to find fresh punctures on his neck, which he attributes to mosquitoes. That night, Orlok signs the documents to purchase the house and notices on the table a miniature portrait of Hutter's wife, Ellen, an image that the young man carries with him in a small circular frame. Admiring the portrait, the count remarks that she has a \"lovely neck.\" Reading a book about vampires that he took from the inn, Hutter begins to suspect that Orlok is indeed a vampire. With no way to bar the door to his bedroom, Hutter desperately tries to hide as midnight approaches. Suddenly, the door begins to slowly open by itself; and, as Orlok enters, a terrified Hutter hides under the bedcovers and falls unconscious. Meanwhile, back in Wisborg, Ellen arises from her own bed and sleepwalks to the railing of her bedroom's balcony. She starts walking on top of the railing, which gets the attention of her friend Harding in the adjacent room. When the doctor arrives, Ellen shouts Hutter's name and envisions Orlok in his castle threatening her unconscious husband. The next day, Hutter explores the castle, only to retreat back into his room after he finds the coffin in which Orlok is resting dormant in the crypt. Hours later, Orlok piles up coffins on a coach and climbs into the last one before the coach departs; Hutter rushes home after learning of this. The coffins are taken aboard a schooner, where the sailors discover rats in the coffins. All of the crewmen later die, and Orlok takes control of the vessel. When the ship arrives in Wisborg, Orlok leaves unobserved, carries one of his coffins and moves into the house that he purchased. Many deaths in the town follow after Orlok's arrival, which the local doctors blame on an unspecified plague caused by the rats from the ship. Ellen reads the book that Hutter found; it claims that a vampire can be defeated if a pure-hearted woman distracts the vampire with her beauty and offers him her blood of her own free will; she decides to sacrifice herself. Ellen opens her window to invite Orlok in and pretends to fall ill so that she can send Hutter to fetch Professor Bulwer, a physician. After he leaves, Orlok enters and drinks her blood, but the sun rises, which causes Orlok to vanish in a puff of smoke. Ellen lives just long enough to be embraced by her grief-stricken husband. Orlok's castle is later shown destroyed. Making uncredited appearances are Karl Etlinger as one of Bulwer's students, Hardy von Francois [de] as a doctor at a mental hospital, Guido Herzfeld as an innkeeper, and Fanny Schreck as a hospital nurse. Nosferatu has been noted for its themes regarding fear of the Other, as well as for possible antisemitic undertones,[1] both of which may have been partially derived from the Bram Stoker novel Dracula, upon which the film was based.[9] The physical appearance of Count Orlok, with his hooked nose, long claw-like fingernails, and large bald head, has been compared to stereotypical caricatures of Jewish people from the time in which Nosferatu was produced.[10] His features have also been compared to those of a rat or a mouse, the former of which Jews were often equated with.[11][12] Orlok's interest in acquiring property in the German town of Wisborg, a shift in locale from the Stoker novel's London, has also been analyzed as preying on the fears and anxieties of the German public at the time.[13] Professor Tony Magistrale wrote that the film's depiction of an \"invasion of the German homeland by an outside force [...] poses disquieting parallels to the anti-Semitic atmosphere festering in Northern Europe in 1922.\"[13] When the foreign Orlok arrives in Wisborg by ship, he brings with him a swarm of rats which, in a deviation from the source novel, spread the plague throughout the town.[12][14] This plot element further associates Orlok with rodents and the idea of the \"Jew as disease-causing agent\".[10][12] It is also notable that Orlok's accomplice in conspiracy Knock is a Jewish realtor, who acts as the vampire's fifth column in the Biedermeier town of Wisborg.[15] There were other views – writer Kevin Jackson has noted that director F. W. Murnau \"was friendly with and protective of a number of Jewish men and women\" throughout his life, including Jewish actor Alexander Granach, who plays Knock in Nosferatu.[16] Additionally, Magistrale wrote that Murnau, being a homosexual, would have been \"presumably more sensitive to the persecution of a subgroup inside the larger German society\".[12] As such, it has been said that perceived associations between Orlok and antisemitic stereotypes are unlikely to have been conscious decisions on the part of Murnau.[12][16] Murnau and Grau gave Orlok in the film a demonic lineage and an occult origin: Orlok is the creation of Belial, one of the Satanic archdemons. Belial in Psalm 41:8–10 is also associated with pestilence, with Orlok in film being the very manifestation of contagion, rats pouring out of his coffins onto the streets of Wisborg, spreading Black Death.[17] Orlok's link to Belial is also highly significant because Belial is \"one of the demons traditionally summoned by Goetic magicians\" – making Orlok someone who practiced dark sorcery before becoming a vampire.[18] Orlok and his servant Knock are communicating in occult language – the documents between Orlok and Knock are written in the Enochian language, a constructed language said to be that of the angels, which was recorded in the private journals of English occultist John Dee and his colleague English alchemist Edward Kelley in late 16th-century Elizabethan England.[19][20] The character of Professor Bulwer in the film is named in reference to English occult novelist Edward Bulwer-Lytton.[20] The idea of astral entities, arising from the dark thoughts of human beings, responsible for epidemics that call for blood sacrifices in order to prevent them, is also closely linked to that of the alchemist Paracelsus, whose figure is partly embodied in the film in the character of Professor Bulwer (who is mentioned in the film to be Paracelsian himself). This is made concrete in the film in the plague epidemic that spreads through the city of Wisborg, which cannot be remedied by scientific methods, but by the blood sacrifice of a woman, thus destroying forever the dark being responsible for this catastrophic situation.[21] The idea for making this vampire film saw its genesis in the war-time experience of producer Albin Grau. Grau served in the German army during World War I on the Serbian front. While in Serbia Grau encountered a local farmer who told him of his father, who the farmer believed had become an undead vampire. F. W. Murnau, director of the film, also saw considerable action in World War I – not only as a company commander in the trenches of the Eastern Front, but also later in the air after he transferred to the German air service. He survived at least eight crashes. Max Schreck who portrayed Count Orlok also served in the trenches with the German army. Little is known of his war-time experience, but there are some signs he may have dealt with some form of post-traumatic stress disorder. Colleagues commented that he preferred to keep to himself. He was known to take long walks in the forest alone, often times disappearing for hours at a time. He once stated that he lived in \"a remote and incorporeal world\". Thus it is considered that the turmoil of 1920s Germany and the war-time experiences of those who produced the film left their marks on the production of the film.[22] As Lotte Eisner, a dedicated occultist, wrote: \"Mysticism and magic, the dark forces to which Germans have always been more than willing to commit themselves, had flourished in the face of death on the battlefields\" – these forces were intrinsic to the shaping of cinema's first vampires. Albin Grau himself also linked the war and vampires: \"this monstrous event that is unleashed across the earth like a cosmic vampire to drink the blood of millions and millions of men\". Belial as well is the link between war and contagion, as Orlok is linked directly to the Black Death and many critics have linked Nosferatu's disease-bearing rodents to the transmissible sickness associated with trench warfare in which rats flourished. As noted by Ernest Jones in his psychoanalytic study of nightmares, vampire legends proliferate in periods of mass contagion.[23] The studio behind Nosferatu, Prana Film, was a short-lived silent-era German film studio founded in 1921 by Enrico Dieckmann and occultist artist Albin Grau,[1] named after a Theosophical journal which was itself named for the Hindu concept of prana.[4] Although the studio's intent was to produce occult- and supernatural-themed films, Nosferatu was its only production,[24] as it declared bankruptcy shortly after the film's release. Grau claimed he was inspired to shoot a vampire film by a war experience: in Grau's apocryphal tale, during the winter of 1916, a Serbian farmer told him that his father was a vampire and one of the undead.[25] As a lifelong student of the occult and member of Fraternitas Saturni, under the magical name of Master Pacitius, Grau was able to imbue Nosferatu with hermetic and mystical undertones. One example in particular was the cryptic contract that Count Orlok and Knock exchanged, which was filled in Enochian, hermetic and alchemical symbols. Grau was also a strong influence on Orlok's verminous and emaciated look[26] and he also designed the film’s sets, costumes, make-up and the letter with the Enochian symbols. He also was responsible for film's advertising campaign, creating movie posters and advertisements. Grau’s visual style was also deeply influenced by work of the artist Hugo Steiner-Prag who had illustrated other texts with esoteric subjects such as Gustav Meyrink’s Golem and E. T. A. Hoffmann’s Die Elixiere des Teufels (1907).[27] Diekmann and Grau gave Henrik Galeen, a disciple of Hanns Heinz Ewers, the task to write a screenplay inspired by the Dracula novel, although Prana Film had not obtained the film rights. Galeen was an experienced specialist in dark romanticism; he had already worked on The Student of Prague (1913), and the screenplay for The Golem: How He Came into the World (1920). Galeen set the story in the fictional north German harbour town of Wisborg. He changed the characters' names and added the idea of the vampire bringing the plague to Wisborg via rats on the ship. Galeen's Expressionist style screenplay was poetically rhythmic, without being so dismembered as other books influenced by literary Expressionism, such as those by Carl Mayer. Lotte Eisner described Galeen's screenplay as \"voll Poesie, voll Rhythmus\" (\"full of poetry, full of rhythm\").[28] Actor Conrad Veidt was offered the role of Count Orlok, having previously worked with Murnau, but had to decline for scheduling reasons. In the search for an alternative the choice finally fell on the then-still-unknown actor Max Schreck.[29] Filming began in July 1921, with exterior shots in Wismar. A take from Marienkirche's tower over Wismar marketplace with the Wasserkunst Wismar [de] served as the establishing shot for the Wisborg scene. Other locations were the Wassertor [de], the Heiligen-Geist-Kirche yard and the harbour. In Lübeck, the abandoned Salzspeicher served as Nosferatu's new Wisborg house, the one of the churchyard of the Aegidienkirche served as Hutter's, and down the Depenau a procession of coffin bearers bore coffins of supposed plague victims. Many scenes of Lübeck appear in the hunt for Knock, who ordered Hutter in the Yard of Füchting to meet Count Orlok. Further exterior shots followed in Lauenburg, Rostock and on Sylt. The exteriors of the film set in Transylvania were actually shot on location in northern Slovakia, including the High Tatras, Vrátna dolina, Orava Castle, the Váh River, and Starý Castle [sk].[30] The team filmed interior shots at the JOFA studio in Berlin's Johannisthal locality and further exteriors in the Tegel Forest.[1] For cost reasons, cameraman Fritz Arno Wagner only had one camera available, and therefore there was only one original negative.[31] The director followed Galeen's screenplay carefully, following handwritten instructions on camera positioning, lighting, and related matters.[28] Nevertheless, Murnau completely rewrote 12 pages of the script, as Galeen's text was missing from the director's working script. This concerned the last scene of the film, in which Ellen sacrifices herself and the vampire dies in the first rays of the sun.[32][33] Murnau prepared carefully; there were sketches that were to correspond exactly to each filmed scene, and he used a metronome to control the pace of the acting.[34] The original score was composed by Hans Erdmann and performed by an orchestra at the film's Berlin premiere. However, most of the score has been lost, and what remains is only a partial adapted suite.[1] Thus, throughout the history of Nosferatu screenings, many composers and musicians have written or improvised their own soundtrack to accompany the film. For example, James Bernard, composer of the soundtracks of many Hammer horror films in the late 1950s and 1960s, wrote a score for a reissue.[1][35] Bernard's score was released in 1997 by Silva Screen Records. A version of Erdmann's original score reconstructed by musicologists and composers Gillian Anderson and James Kessler was released in 1995 by BMG Classics, with multiple missing sequences composed anew, in an attempt to match Erdmann's style. An earlier reconstruction by German composer Berndt Heller has many additions of unrelated classical works.[1] In 2022, the New York Times wrote about Dutch composer Jozef van Wissem's new score and record release for Nosferatu. Beginning with a solo played on the lute, his performance incorporates electric guitar and distorted recordings of extinct birds, graduating from subtlety to gothic horror. \"My soundtrack goes from silence to noise over the course of 90 minutes,\" he said, culminating in \"dense, slow death metal.\"[36] A new score for full orchestra and piano was commissioned by the Louisville Orchestra from its former composer-in-residence Sebastian Chang. It premiered, played live with the film in October 2023. [1] Shortly before the premiere, an advertisement campaign was placed in issue #21 of the magazine Bühne und Film, with a summary, scene and work photographs, production reports, and essays, including a treatment on vampirism by Albin Grau.[38] Nosferatu opened in the Netherlands on 16 February 1922 at the Hague Flora and Olympia cinemas.[39] Nosferatu premiered in Germany on 4 March 1922 in the Marmorsaal of the Berlin Zoological Garden. This was planned as a large society evening entitled Das Fest des Nosferatu (Festival of Nosferatu), and guests were asked to arrive dressed in Biedermeier costume. The German cinema premiere itself took place on 15 March 1922 at Berlin's Primus-Palast.[1] The 1930s sound version Die zwölfte Stunde – Eine Nacht des Grauens (The Twelfth Hour: A Night of Horror), which is less commonly known, was a completely unauthorized and re-edited version of the film. It was released in Vienna, Austria on 16 May 1930 with sound-on-disc accompaniment and a recomposition of Hans Erdmann's original score by Georg Fiebiger, a German production manager and composer of film music. It had an alternative ending lighter than the original and the characters were renamed again; Count Orlok's name was changed to Prince Wolkoff, Knock became Karsten, Hutter and Ellen became Kundberg and Margitta, and Annie was changed to Maria.[1] This version, of which Murnau was unaware, contained many scenes filmed by Murnau but not previously released. It also contained additional footage not filmed by Murnau but by a cameraman, Günther Krampf, under the direction of Waldemar Roger [de] (also known as Waldemar Ronger),[40] supposedly also a film editor and lab chemist.[citation needed] The name of director F. W. Murnau is no longer mentioned in the credits.[citation needed] This version, lasting approximately 80 minutes, was presented on 5 June 1981 at the Cinémathèque Française.[41] Nosferatu brought Murnau into the public eye, especially when his film Der brennende Acker (The Burning Soil) was released a few days later. The press reported extensively on Nosferatu and its premiere. With the laudatory votes, there was also occasional criticism that the technical perfection and clarity of the images did not fit the horror theme. The Filmkurier of 6 March 1922 said that the vampire appeared too corporeal and brightly lit to appear genuinely scary. Hans Wollenberg described the film in photo-Stage No. 11 of 11 March 1922 as a \"sensation\" and praised Murnau's nature shots as \"mood-creating elements.\"[42] In the Vossische Zeitung of 7 March 1922, Nosferatu was praised for its visual style.[43] Nosferatu was also the first film to show a vampire dying from exposure to sunlight. Previous vampire novels such as Dracula had shown them being uncomfortable with sunlight, but not undeath-threateningly so.[44] The film has received overwhelmingly positive reviews. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 97% based on 63 reviews, with an average rating of 9.05/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"One of the silent era's most influential masterpieces, Nosferatu's eerie, gothic feel – and a chilling performance from Max Schreck as the vampire – set the template for the horror films that followed.\"[45] In 1995, the Vatican included Nosferatu on a list of 45 important films that people should watch.[46] It was ranked twenty-first in Empire magazine's \"The 100 Best Films of World Cinema\" in 2010.[47] In 1997, critic Roger Ebert added Nosferatu to his list of The Great Movies, writing: Here is the story of Dracula before it was buried alive in clichés, jokes, TV skits, cartoons and more than 30 other films. The film is in awe of its material. It seems to really believe in vampires. ...Is Murnau's Nosferatu scary in the modern sense? Not for me. I admire it more for its artistry and ideas, its atmosphere and images, than for its ability to manipulate my emotions like a skillful modern horror film. It knows none of the later tricks of the trade, like sudden threats that pop in from the side of the screen. But Nosferatu remains effective: It doesn't scare us, but it haunts us.[48] Nosferatu only entered the public domain worldwide by the end of 2019. Despite this, the film had already been subject to widespread circulation via a sped-up, unrestored black and white bootleg copy.[49] Beginning in 1981, the film has had various different official restorations, several of which have been issued on home video in the U.S., Europe and Australia. These versions, which are all tinted, speed-corrected and have specially recorded scores, are separately copyrighted with respect to new copyrightable elements.[1] The most recent restoration, completed in 2005/2006, has been released on DVD and Blu-ray throughout the world, and features a reconstruction of Hans Erdmann's original score by Berndt Heller.[50] In 1977, Spanish amateur filmmaker José Ernesto Díaz Noriega added humorous and iconoclastic dialogues to the film. His adaptation or détournement, titled Manuscrito encontrato en Zarazwela or Nos fera tu la pugnete, was based on a S8 mm print of the English version. \"Observing the curious coincidence of the fiction that is related in the film with history\",[51] Díaz Noriega adapted Nosferatu's plot to the years of the Spanish transition to democracy: Prime Minister Arias Navarro becomes Draculas Navarro and Juan Carlos de Borbón becomes Jonathan Carolus (prince of Franconia). The original Transylvania becomes Galitzia and the Pazo de Meirás becomes the vampire's castle. All Murnau's characters find equivalence in the political actors of the Spanish transition to democracy.[52] A 1979 adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel Dracula by director Werner Herzog, Nosferatu the Vampyre, starred Klaus Kinski (as Count Dracula, not Count Orlok).[53] The film is a remake of the 1922 film with character names that are faithful to the novel. A remake by director David Lee Fisher was in development after being successfully funded on Kickstarter on 3 December 2014.[54] On 13 April 2016, it was reported that Doug Jones had been cast as Count Orlok in the film and that filming had begun. The film would use green screen to insert colorized backgrounds from the original film atop live-action, a process Fisher previously used for his remake The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (2005).[55][1] In November 2023, it premiered at the Emagine Theater in Novi.[56] It was later released on video on demand via Amazon Prime Video in September 2024 and on streaming though Apple TV+ on 18 October 2024.[57] In July 2015, a remake was announced with Robert Eggers writing and directing.[58] It was reported in September 2022 that Eggers' remake would be distributed by Focus Features, with Bill Skarsgård set to star as Orlok and Lily-Rose Depp as Ellen Hutter. Willem Dafoe, Nicholas Hoult, and Emma Corrin also appear.[59] The film wrapped principal photography on 19 May 2023.[60] The film's first teaser trailer was released on 24 June 2024, and it confirmed that the film will be released on 25 December 2024.[61]",

                "title": "Mariah Carey - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Mariah Carey (/məˈraɪə/ mə-RY-ə;[1]: 0:01 born March 27, 1969)[a] is an American singer, songwriter, record producer, and actress. Dubbed the \"Songbird Supreme\" by Guinness World Records, Carey is known for her five-octave vocal range, melismatic singing style and signature use of the whistle register. An influential figure in music, she was ranked as the fifth greatest singer of all time by Rolling Stone in 2023. Carey rose to fame in 1990 with her self-titled debut album and became the only artist to have their first five singles reach number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, from \"Vision of Love\" to \"Emotions\". She achieved an international success with the best-selling albums Music Box (1993) and Daydream (1995), before adopting a new image with hip hop-inflected sounds, following the release of Butterfly (1997). The remix of her song \"Fantasy\", featuring Ol' Dirty Bastard, popularized the blend of pop and hip-hop into mainstream music. With eleven consecutive years of US number-one songs, Billboard ranked Carey as the most successful artist of the 1990s. Following a career decline and the failure of her 2001 film Glitter, she returned to the top of the charts with The Emancipation of Mimi (2005), one of the best-selling albums of the 21st century. Carey's public and personal life, including her diva persona, high-profile relationships and public breakdown in 2001, has received widespread media coverage. She has also been dubbed the \"Queen of Christmas\" due to the enduring popularity of her holiday music, particularly Merry Christmas (1994), the best-selling holiday album, and its single \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\", which is the best selling holiday single by a female artist of all time. Outside of music, she has acted in major roles in the films Tennessee (2008), Precious (2009), The Butler (2013), A Christmas Melody (2015), and The Lego Batman Movie (2017). Carey also served as an American Idol judge in 2013 and starred in the docu-series Mariah's World. She published a memoir, The Meaning of Mariah Carey, in 2020. Carey is one of the best-selling music artists, with over 220 million records sold worldwide. She was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, the Long Island Music and Entertainment Hall of Fame, and the National Recording Registry at the Library of Congress. Her accolades include 5 competitive Grammy Awards and a Grammy Global Impact Award, 10 American Music Awards, 19 World Music Awards and 20 Billboard Music Awards. She holds the record for the most Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles by a solo artist (19), a female songwriter (18), and a female producer (15), spending a record 96 weeks atop the chart. \"One Sweet Day\" and \"We Belong Together\" were ranked by Billboard as the most successful songs of the 1990s and 2000s, respectively. Carey is the highest-certified female artist in the United States and 10th overall, with 75 million certified album-equivalent units. Carey was born on March 27, 1969,[a] in Huntington, New York.[5][6] Her name is derived from the song \"They Call the Wind Maria\", originally from the 1951 Broadway musical Paint Your Wagon.[7][8] She is the youngest of three children born to Patricia (née Hickey), a former opera singer and vocal coach of Irish descent, and Alfred Roy Carey, an aeronautical engineer of both African-American and Afro-Venezuelan lineage. The last name \"Carey\" was adopted by her Venezuelan grandfather, Francisco Núñez, after he emigrated to New York.[9][6] Patricia's family disowned her for marrying a black man. Racial tensions prevented the Carey family from integrating into their community. While they lived in Huntington, their neighbors poisoned the family dog and set fire to their car.[9] After her parents' divorce, Carey had little contact with Alfred, and Patricia worked several jobs to support the family. Carey spent much of her time at home alone and began singing at age three, often imitating her mother's take on Verdi's opera Rigoletto in Italian. Her older sister Alison moved in with their father while Mariah and her elder brother Morgan lived with their mother.[10][11] During her years in elementary school, she excelled in the arts, such as music and literature. Carey began writing poetry and lyrics while attending Harborfields High School in Greenlawn, New York,[12] where she graduated in 1987.[13] Carey began vocal training under her mother's guidance. Though she was a classically trained opera singer, Patricia Carey never pressured her daughter to pursue a career in classical opera. Mariah Carey recalled that she had \"never been a pushy mom. She never said, 'Give it more of an operatic feel.' I respect opera like crazy, but it didn't influence me.\"[12][14] In high school, Mariah Carey was often absent because of her work as a demo singer. This led to her classmates giving her the nickname Mirage.[14] Working in the Long Island music scene gave her opportunities to work with musicians such as Gavin Christopher and Ben Margulies, with whom she co-wrote material for her demo tape. After moving to New York City, she worked part-time jobs to pay the rent and completed 500 hours of beauty school.[15] Carey moved into a one-bedroom apartment in Manhattan with four female students as roommates.[16] She landed a gig singing backup for freestyle singer Brenda K. Starr.[17][18] In December 1988, Carey accompanied Starr to a music executive's party and handed her demo tape to the head of Columbia Records, Tommy Mottola.[19][20] After listening to the tape during the ride home, he immediately requested the driver turn around. She had already left the event, and Mottola spent two weeks looking for her. Another record label expressed interest and a bidding war ensued. He signed Carey to Columbia and enlisted producers Ric Wake, Narada Michael Walden, and Rhett Lawrence for her first album.[19] Columbia marketed Carey as the main female artist on their roster, competing with Arista Records's Whitney Houston and Madonna of Sire Records.[21] It spent upwards of $1 million promoting Carey's debut studio album, Mariah Carey.[22] On June 5, 1990, Carey made her first public appearance at the 1990 NBA Finals, singing \"America the Beautiful\". The highlight was the piercing whistle note toward the song's conclusion, sparking CBS Sports anchor Pat O'Brien to declare, \"The palace now has a queen.\"[23] The album topped the US Billboard 200 for eleven consecutive weeks, after Carey's exposure at the 33rd Annual Grammy Awards, where she won the award for Best New Artist, and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for her single \"Vision of Love\".[24][25] The album's singles \"Vision of Love\", \"Love Takes Time\", \"Someday\", and \"I Don't Wanna Cry\" all topped the US Billboard Hot 100.[26] Mariah Carey was the best-selling album in the United States in 1991,[27] and achieved worldwide sales of 15 million copies.[28] Carey co-wrote, co-produced, and recorded her second studio effort, Emotions, during 1991.[29][30] She described it as a homage to Motown soul music and employed the help of Walter Afanasieff, who only had a small role on her debut, as well as Robert Clivillés and David Cole, from the dance group C+C Music Factory.[31] Carey's relationship with Margulies deteriorated over a songwriting royalties dispute. After he filed a lawsuit against Columbia's parent company, Sony Music Entertainment, the songwriting duo parted ways.[30] Emotions was released on September 17 that year. Its title track served as the album's lead single and became Carey's fifth chart topper on the Billboard Hot 100, making her the first artist whose first five singles reached the chart's summit.[32] Though critics praised the album's content and described it as a more mature effort, the album was criticized as calculated and lacking originality.[33] While the album managed sales of eight million copies globally, Emotions failed to reach the commercial and critical heights of its predecessor.[34] Carey did not embark on a world tour to promote the album.[35] Although she attributed this to stage fright and the vocally challenging nature of her material, speculation grew that Carey was a \"studio worm\" and incapable of producing the perfect pitch and five-octave vocal range for which she was known.[36][37] In hopes of ending any speculation of her being a manufactured artist, Carey booked an appearance on MTV Unplugged. The show presented artists \"unplugged\" or in a stripped setting and devoid of studio equipment.[38] Days prior to the show's taping, Carey and Afanasieff chose to add a cover of the Jackson 5's 1970 song \"I'll Be There\" to the set-list. On March 16, 1992, she played and recorded an intimate seven-song show at Kaufman Astoria Studios in Queens, New York.[39] The acclaimed revue was aired more than three times as often as the average episode,[40] and critics heralding it as a \"vocal Tour de force\".[41] Carey's live version of \"I'll Be There\" became her sixth number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Sony capitalized on this success and released an extended play (EP) of her performance. It earned a triple-Platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA)[42] and earned Gold and Platinum certifications in several European markets.[43] Following years of dating,[44] Carey and Mottola got married on June 5, 1993.[45] After Emotions failed to achieve the commercial heights of her debut album, Carey's subsequent release was to be marketed as adult contemporary and pop-friendly. Music Box was produced by Carey and Afanasieff, and it began a songwriting partnership that would extend until 1997's Butterfly.[46] The album was released on August 31, 1993, to mixed reviews from music critics. Carey's songwriting was derided as clichéd and her vocal performances were described as less emotive and lazier in their delivery. In his review of the album, AllMusic's Ron Wynn concluded: \"sometimes excessive spirit is preferable to an absence of passion.\"[47] In promotion of the album, Carey embarked on her debut tour, a six-date concert series, the Music Box Tour.[48] Music Box's first and second singles, \"Dreamlover\" and \"Hero\", became Carey's seventh and eighth chart-toppers in the United States, while her cover of Badfinger's \"Without You\" became her first number-one single in Germany,[49] Sweden[50] and the United Kingdom.[51] Music Box remains Carey's best-seller and one of the best-selling albums, with worldwide sales of over 28 million copies.[52] In mid-1994, Carey and Luther Vandross recorded and released a cover of Lionel Richie and Diana Ross's \"Endless Love\".[53] Merry Christmas, released on November 1, 1994, became the best-selling Christmas album, with global sales of over 15 million copies.[54][55][56] The lead single, \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\", became a holiday standard and continues to surge in popularity each holiday season.[57] By October 2017, it had become the 11th best-selling single in history with over 16 million copies sold worldwide.[58] Carey's fifth studio album, Daydream, found her consolidating creative control over her career, leading to tensions with Columbia.[59] Songs from her prior two albums had been primarily shaped by Mottola's conceptualization of what Carey should sound like, as innocent and wholesome tracks dominated by her vocal performance.[60] Daydream featured a departure from her allegiance to pop and gravitated heavily towards R&B and hip hop.[59] Critically, the album was described as Carey's best to date. The New York Times named it one of 1995's best albums and wrote it \"brings R&B candy-making to a new peak of textural refinement ... Carey's songwriting has taken a leap forward and become more relaxed, sexier and less reliant on thudding clichés.\"[61] Its lead single, \"Fantasy\", became the first single by a female artist to debut at number one on the Billboard Hot 100,[62] and the second song overall after Michael Jackson's \"You Are Not Alone\".[63] \"One Sweet Day\", a collaboration with R&B group Boyz II Men, served as the second single from Daydream and remained atop the Billboard Hot 100 for a record-breaking 16 consecutive weeks, becoming the longest-running number-one song in the history of the charts at the time.[64] It also opened at the top spot, becoming Carey's second track to do so.[63] The album's third single, \"Always Be My Baby\", became Carey's eleventh chart-topper, tying her with Madonna and Whitney Houston for the most number-one singles among female artists at the time.[64] Daydream became Carey's biggest-selling album in the United States,[65] and her second album to be certified Diamond by the RIAA, after Music Box.[42] The album continued Carey's dominance in Asian music markets and sold in excess of 2.2 million copies in Japan alone and over 20 million copies globally.[66][67] Daydream and its singles were nominated in six categories at the 38th Grammy Awards.[68] Though considered a favorite to win the top awards of the evening, Carey was shut out, prompting her to comment \"What can you do? I will never be disappointed again.\"[69] In early 1996, she embarked on her first international string of concerts, the Daydream World Tour. Its seven dates spanned three in Japan and four throughout Europe.[70] Forbes named Carey the top-earning female musician of 1996, collecting an estimated $32 million.[71] During the recording of Daydream, Carey also worked on the alternative rock album Someone's Ugly Daughter by the band Chick, contributing writing, production, vocals and art direction. As Columbia Records refused to release the album with her lead vocals, Carey's friend Clarissa Dane was brought in to become the face of Chick, and her vocals were layered on top of Carey's, masking her voice.[72] Her contributions were secret until the release of her 2020 memoir The Meaning of Mariah Carey.[73] Carey's subsequent musical releases followed the trend that began with Daydream. Her music began relying less on pop and adult contemporary-tinged balladry and instead incorporating heavy elements of hip hop and R&B. On Butterfly, she collaborated with a bevy of producers other than Afanasieff, such as Sean Combs, Q-Tip, Missy Elliott and Jean Claude Oliver and Samuel Barnes from Trackmasters.[74] Butterfly was released on September 10, 1997,[75] and introduced a more subdued style of singing, with critics noting Carey's incorporation of breathy vocals.[76] Some viewed her lack of propensity to use her upper range as a sign of maturity,[77] while others questioned whether it forebode waning vocal prowess.[78][79] The music video for the album's lead single, \"Honey\", her first since separating from Mottola, introduced a more overtly sexual image.[80] Butterfly became Carey's best-reviewed album, with attention placed on the album's exploration of more mature lyrical themes. In their review of the album, Rolling Stone wrote it was \"not as if Carey has totally dispensed with her old saccharine, Houston-style balladry ... but the predominant mood of Butterfly is one of coolly erotic reverie.\"[81] AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine described Carey's vocals as \"sultrier and more controlled than ever,\" and felt the album \"illustrates that Carey continues to improve and refine her music, which makes her a rarity among her '90s peers.'\"[82] \"Honey\" and \"My All\", the album's fifth single, both topped the Hot 100, making Carey a female artist with the most number-one singles in the chart's history. Though a commercial success, Butterfly failed to reach the commercial heights of her previous albums, Music Box and Daydream.[83] After concluding her Butterfly World Tour, Carey participated in the VH1 Divas benefit concert on April 14, 1998, where she sang alongside Aretha Franklin, Celine Dion, Shania Twain, Gloria Estefan, and Carole King.[84] Carey began conceptualizing a film project All That Glitters, later re-titled to simply Glitter (2001),[85] and wrote songs for other projects, such as Men in Black (1997) and How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000). After Glitter fell into developmental hell, Carey postponed the project and began writing material for a new album.[86] Sony Music executives insisted she prepare a greatest hits collection in time for the holiday season.[87] The album, titled #1's (1998), featured a cover of Brenda K. Starr's \"I Still Believe\" and a duet with Whitney Houston, \"When You Believe\", which was included on the soundtrack for The Prince of Egypt (1998).[88] #1's became a phenomenon in Japan, selling over one million copies in its opening week, making Carey the only international artist to accomplish this feat. It sold over 3.25 million copies in Japan in its first three months and holds the record as the best-selling album by a non-Asian artist.[89] With only one album left to fulfill her contract with Sony, and with a desire to separate herself professionally from the record label her ex-husband still headed, Carey completed the album in three months in mid-1999.[45] Titled Rainbow, the album found Carey exploring with producers whom she had not worked with before. Rainbow became Carey's first album to not feature a collaboration with her longtime writing partner, Walter Afanasieff. She instead chose to work with David Foster and Diane Warren. \"Heartbreaker\" and \"Thank God I Found You\" both topped the Billboard Hot 100, while her rendition of Phil Collins' \"Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now)\" with Irish boy band Westlife became her second number-one song on the UK charts. Rainbow was released on November 2, 1999, to the highest first-week sales of her career at the time, and debuted at number two on the Billboard 200.[90] Carey's tense relationship with Columbia grew increasingly fractious; she began posting messages on her website, sharing inside information with fans on the dispute, as well as instructing them to request \"Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme)\" on radio stations.[91] Ultimately, the song was only given a very limited and low-promotion release.[92] Critical reception of Rainbow was generally positive, with the general consensus finding: \"what began on Butterfly as a departure ends up on Rainbow a progression – perhaps the first compelling proof of Carey's true colors as an artist.\"[93] Though a commercial success, Rainbow became Carey's lowest selling album at that point in her career.[94] Carey received Billboard's Artist of the Decade Award and the World Music Award for Best-Selling Pop Female Artist of the Millennium,[95] and parted from Columbia Records. She signed an unprecedented $80 million five-album recording contract with Virgin Records (EMI Records) in April 2001.[96][97] Glitter was a musical departure, recreating a 1980s post-disco era to accompany the film, set in 1983. Carey was given full conceptual and creative control over the project.[96] She said that Columbia had regarded her as a commodity, with her separation from Mottola exacerbating her relations with label executives. Carey's three-year relationship with Latin singer Luis Miguel ended.[98] In July 2001, Carey suffered a physical and emotional breakdown. She began posting disturbing messages on her website and behaved erratically in live promotional outings.[99] On July 19, Carey made a surprise appearance on the MTV program Total Request Live (TRL). As the show's host Carson Daly began taping following a commercial break, she came out pushing an ice cream cart while wearing a large men's shirt and began a striptease that revealed a tight ensemble.[100] She credited exhaustion for the appearance going awry.[101] Days later, Carey posted irregular voice notes on her website.[100] On July 26, she was hospitalized due to exhaustion and a \"physical and emotional breakdown\". Carey was admitted to a hospital in Connecticut and remained under doctor's care for two weeks, followed by an extended absence from the public.[102] Virgin Records and 20th Century Fox delayed the release of Glitter and its soundtrack.[103][104] Critics panned Glitter and its soundtrack; both were unsuccessful commercially.[105] The soundtrack became Carey's lowest-selling album to that point. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch condemned it as \"an absolute mess that'll go down as an annoying blemish on [her] career.\"[106] She attributed the poor performance to her state of mind, its postponement and the soundtrack having been released on September 11.[107] Carey's record deal with Virgin Records was bought out for $28 million.[96][97] She flew to Capri, Italy, for five months, and wrote material for a new album there.[99] Carey described her time at Virgin \"a complete and total stress-fest ... I made a total snap decision which was based on money and I never make decisions based on money. I learned a big lesson from that.\"[108] She signed a contract with Island Records, valued at more than $24 million,[109] and launched the record label MonarC. Carey's father, Alfred Roy, with whom she had had little contact since childhood, died of cancer that year.[110] Her song \"Sunflowers for Alfred Roy\" from Charmbracelet is dedicated to his memory.[111] In 2002, she was cast in the independent film WiseGirls alongside Mira Sorvino and Melora Walters, who co-starred as waitresses at a mobster-operated restaurant. It premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, and received negative reviews, though Carey's performance was praised. Roger Friedman of Fox News described her as \"a Thelma Ritter for the new millennium\", and wrote, \"Her line delivery is sharp and she manages to get the right laughs.\"[112] In December 2002, Carey released her ninth studio album, Charmbracelet, which she said marked \"a new lease on life\" for her.[113] Sales of Charmbracelet were moderate and the quality of Carey's vocals came under criticism. Joan Anderson from The Boston Globe declared the album \"the worst of her career, and revealed a voice [that is] no longer capable of either gravity-defying gymnastics or soft coos\",[114] while AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote, \"Mariah's voice is shot, sounding in tatters throughout the record. She can no longer coo or softly croon nor can she perform her trademark gravity-defying vocal runs.\"[115] To support the album, Carey embarked on the Charmbracelet World Tour, spanning North America and East Asia over three months.[116] While smaller venues were booked throughout the tour's stateside leg, Carey performed in stadiums in Asia and Europe.[117] In the United Kingdom, it was her first tour to feature shows outside London.[118] The tour garnered generally positive reviews, with many praising the production and Carey's vocals.[119] Carey's tenth studio album, The Emancipation of Mimi in 2005, was produced with the Neptunes, Kanye West and Carey's longtime collaborator, Jermaine Dupri. She described the album as \"very much like a party record ... the process of putting on makeup and getting ready to go out ... I wanted to make a record that was reflective of that.\"[120] The Emancipation of Mimi topped the charts in the United States, becoming her fifth number-one album and first since Butterfly (1997), and was warmly accepted by critics. Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian defined it as \"cool, focused and urban [... some of] the first Mariah Carey tunes in years which I wouldn't have to be paid to listen to again,\"[121] while USA Today's Elysa Gardner wrote, \"The [songs] truly reflect the renewed confidence of a songbird who has taken her shots and kept on flying.\"[122] The album's second single, \"We Belong Together\", became a \"career re-defining\"[123] song for Carey, after a relatively unsuccessful period and a point when many critics had considered her career over.[124] Music critics heralded the song as her \"return to form,\" as well as the \"return of The Voice,\"[125] while many felt it would revive \"faith\" in Carey's potential as a balladeer.[120] \"We Belong Together\" broke several records in the United States and became Carey's sixteenth chart topper on the Billboard Hot 100. After staying at number one for fourteen non-consecutive weeks, the song became the second-longest-running number one song in US chart history, behind Carey's \"One Sweet Day\".[126] Billboard listed it as the \"song of the decade\" and the ninth most popular song of all time.[127] The song broke several airplay records, and according to Nielsen BDS, and gathered both the largest one-day and one-week audiences in history.[128] During the week of September 25, 2005, Carey set another record, becoming the first woman to occupy the first two spots atop the Hot 100, as \"We Belong Together\" remained at number one, and her next single, \"Shake It Off\", moved into the number two spot (Ashanti had topped the chart in 2002 while being a featured singer on the number two single).[126] On the US Billboard Hot 100 Year-end Chart of 2005, \"We Belong Together\" was declared the number one song, a first for Carey.[129] Billboard listed \"We Belong Together\" ninth on The Billboard Hot 100 All-Time Top Songs and was declared the most popular song of the 2000s decade by Billboard.[130] The album was re-released as The Ultra Platinum Edition, from which \"Don't Forget About Us\" became her seventeenth number-one in the United States.[131][132] The Emancipation of Mimi earned ten Grammy Award nominations: eight in 2006 for the original release, the most received by Carey in a single year, and two in 2007 for the Ultra Platinum Edition. Carey won Best Contemporary R&B Album for The Emancipation of Mimi and Best Female R&B Vocal Performance and Best R&B Song for \"We Belong Together\".[133] The Emancipation of Mimi was 2005's best-selling album in the United States, with nearly five million units sold. It was the first album by a solo female artist to become the year's best-selling album within the country since Alanis Morissette's Jagged Little Pill in 1996.[134] At the end of 2005, the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) reported that The Emancipation of Mimi had sold more than 7.7 million copies globally, and was the second-best-selling album of the year after Coldplay's X&Y.[135][136][137] It has since sold 12 million copies worldwide.[138] In support of the album, Carey embarked on her first headlining tour in three years, named The Adventures of Mimi after a \"Carey-centric fan's\" music diary.[139] The tour spanned 40 dates, with 32 in the United States and Canada, two in Africa, and six in Japan.[140] It received warm reception from music critics and concert goers, many of which lauded Carey's vocals.[141][142] In early 2007, Carey began to work on her eleventh studio album, E=MC². Although the album was well received by some critics,[143][144] others criticized it for being very similar to the formula used on The Emancipation of Mimi.[145] Two weeks before the album's release, \"Touch My Body\", the record's lead single, reached the top position on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Carey's eighteenth number one and making her the solo artist with the most number one singles in United States history, pushing her past Elvis Presley into second place according to the magazine's revised methodology.[146] Carey is second only to The Beatles, who have twenty number-one singles. Additionally, it gave Carey her 79th week atop the Hot 100, tying her with Presley as the artist with the most weeks at number one in the Billboard chart history.\"[147] E=MC² debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 with 463,000 copies sold, the biggest opening week sales of her career.[148] In 2008, Carey also played an aspiring singer named Krystal in Tennessee[149] and had a cameo appearance in Adam Sandler's film You Don't Mess with the Zohan, playing herself.[150] Since the album's release, Carey had planned to embark on an extensive tour in support of E=MC².[151] However, the tour was suddenly cancelled in early December 2008.[152] Carey later stated that she had been pregnant during that time period and suffered a miscarriage, prompting the tour's cancellation.[153][154] On January 20, 2009, Carey performed \"Hero\" at the Neighborhood Inaugural Ball after Barack Obama was sworn as the first African-American president of the United States.[155] On July 7, 2009, Carey—alongside Trey Lorenz—performed her version of \"I'll Be There\" at the memorial service for Michael Jackson.[156] In 2009, she appeared as a social worker in Precious, the movie adaptation of the 1996 novel Push by Sapphire. The film garnered mostly positive reviews from critics, also for Carey's performance.[157] Variety described her acting as \"pitch-perfect.\"[158] In January 2010, Carey won the Breakthrough Actress Performance Award for her role in Precious at the Palm Springs International Film Festival.[159] On September 25, 2009, Carey's twelfth studio album, Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel, was released. Reception for the album was mostly mixed; Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called it \"her most interesting album in a decade,\"[160] while Jon Caramanica from The New York Times criticized Carey's vocal performances, complaining she overused softer vocal registers at the expense of her more powerful lower and upper registers.[161] Commercially, the album debuted at number three on the Billboard 200 with first week sales of 168,000 copies.[162] \"Obsessed\" served as the lead single and debuted at number eleven in the US before peaking at number seven. It became Carey's 27th top-ten entry within the nation, tying her with Elton John and Janet Jackson for having the fifth most top-tens.[163] Its follow-up single, a cover of Foreigner's \"I Want to Know What Love Is\", broke airplay records in Brazil. The song spent 27 weeks atop the Brasil Hot 100, making it the longest running song in the chart's history.[164] On December 31, 2009, Carey embarked on her seventh concert tour, Angels Advocate Tour, which visited the United States and Canada and ended on September 26, 2010.[165][166] A planned remix album of Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel, titled Angels Advocate, was slated for a March 30, 2010, release but was eventually cancelled after Island Def Jam decided to instead distribute \"Up Out My Face\" with Nicki Minaj and \"Angels Cry\" with Ne-Yo as stand-alone releases.[167] Following the cancellation of Angels Advocate, it was announced that Carey would return to the studio to start work on her thirteenth studio album.[168] It was later revealed that it would be her second Christmas album, and follow-up to Merry Christmas.[55] The release date for the album, titled Merry Christmas II You, was November 2, 2010;[169] the track list included new songs as well as a remix of \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\".[170] Merry Christmas II You debuted at number four on the Billboard 200 with sales of 56,000 copies, and number one on the R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, making it only the second Christmas album to top this chart.[171] In February 2011, she recorded a duet with Tony Bennett for his Duets II album, titled \"When Do The Bells Ring For Me?\",[172] and re-recorded \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" with Justin Bieber as a duet for his Christmas album, Under the Mistletoe.[173][174] In November that year, Carey was included in the remix to the mixtape single \"Warning\" by Uncle Murda; the remix also features 50 Cent and Young Jeezy.[175] Later that month, Carey released a duet with John Legend titled \"When Christmas Comes\", originally part of Merry Christmas II You.[176] On March 1, 2012, Carey performed at New York City's Gotham Hall; her first time performing since her pregnancy.[177][178] She also performed a three-song set at a special fundraiser for US President Barack Obama held in New York's Plaza Hotel. A new song titled \"Bring It On Home\", which Carey wrote for the event to show her support for Obama's re-election campaign, was also performed.[179] In August 2012, she released a stand-alone single, \"Triumphant (Get 'Em)\", featuring rappers Rick Ross and Meek Mill.[180] Carey joined the judging panel of the twelfth season of American Idol.[181][182] Throughout the show there were on-set disagreements between Carey and fellow judge Nicki Minaj.[183][184] Three years later, Carey did not make an appearance for its original series finale.[185][186] In 2013, Carey appeared in Lee Daniels' film The Butler[187] and had a guest role voicing as a redneck character on the adult animated series American Dad!.[188] In February 2013, Carey recorded and released a song called \"Almost Home\", for the soundtrack of The Walt Disney Studios film Oz the Great and Powerful. The video was directed by photographer David LaChapelle.[189][190] For her 14th album, she worked with producers including DJ Clue?, Randy Jackson, Q-Tip, R. Kelly, David Morales, Afanasieff, Dupri, The-Dream, and Da Brat. Carey told Billboard: \"It's about making sure I have tons of good music, because at the end of the day that's the most important thing... There are a lot more raw ballads than people might expect...there are also uptempo and signature-type songs that represent [my] different facets as an artist.\"[191] The lead single, \"Beautiful\", featuring singer Miguel, was released on May 6, 2013, and peaked at number 15 on the Hot 100.[192] Carey taped a performance of \"Beautiful\" along with a medley of her greatest hits on May 15, 2013. This taping aired on the American Idol season finale the following day.[193] After multiple delays, The album, titled Me. I Am Mariah... The Elusive Chanteuse, was released on May 27, 2014.[194] In October 2014, Carey announced an annual residency show All I Want for Christmas Is You: A Night of Joy and Festivity. Originally performed at the Beacon Theatre in New York City, the residency began on December 15, 2014, and ended in 2019.[195][196] On January 30, 2015, it was announced that Carey had left Universal Music Group's Def Jam Recordings to reunite with L.A. Reid and Sony Music via Epic Records.[197][198][199] Carey also announced her new #1 to Infinity residency at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas the same month.[200] To coincide with the residency, Carey released #1 to Infinity, a greatest hits compilation album containing all of her eighteen Billboard Hot 100 number one singles at the time, along with a new recording, \"Infinity\", which was released as a single on April 27.[201] In 2015 Carey had her directorial debut for the Hallmark Channel Christmas movie A Christmas Melody, in which she also performed as one of the main characters.[202] In December 2015, Carey announced The Sweet Sweet Fantasy Tour which spanned a total of 27-dates beginning in March 2016, marking Carey's first major tour of mainland Europe in 13 years. Four stops included shows in South Africa.[203] The tour grossed $30.3 million.[204] On March 15, 2016, Carey announced that she was filming Mariah's World, a docu-series for the E! network documenting her Sweet Sweet Fantasy tour and her wedding planning process. Carey told The New York Times, \"I thought it would be a good opportunity to kind of, like, show my personality and who I am, even though I feel like my real fans have an idea of who I am... A lot of people have misperceptions about this and that.\"[205] The series premiered on December 4, 2016.[206] Carey guest starred on the musical drama Empire, as a superstar singer named Kitty and sang the song \"Infamous\" featuring Jussie Smollett.[207] On December 5, 2016, Carey participated in the VH1 Divas Holiday: Unsilent Night benefit concert, alongside Vanessa Williams, Chaka Khan, Patti LaBelle, and Teyana Taylor.[208] On December 31, 2016, Carey's performance on Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve in Times Square received worldwide attention after technical difficulties caused her in-ear monitors to malfunction, resulting in what The New York Times referred to as a \"performance train wreck.\"[209] She said her inability to hear the music without in-ear auditory feedback caused the mishap.[210] Carey's representatives and Dick Clark Productions placed blame on each other.[211] On February 3, 2017, Carey released the single \"I Don't\" featuring YG.[212] Later that month, she voiced the Mayor of Gotham City in the animated film The Lego Batman Movie.[213] In July 2017, Carey made a cameo in the comedy film Girls Trip[214] and embarked on a tour with Lionel Richie, titled, All the Hits Tour.[215] She was also featured in the official remix for French Montana's single \"Unforgettable\", alongside Swae Lee.[216] In October 2017, Carey released a new soundtrack single, \"The Star\", for the movie of the same name.[217] She also voiced a hen named Rebecca in the film.[218] The song was nominated for the Best Original Song at the 75th Golden Globe Awards.[219] Carey additionally developed an animated Christmas film, Mariah Carey's All I Want For Christmas Is You, for which she recorded an original song called \"Lil' Snowman\". The film was released direct-to-video on November 14, 2017.[220][221] On December 31, 2017, Carey returned to perform on Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve after the technical difficulties that hindered her previous performance, in what The New York Times described as a \"made-for-television act of pop culture redemption\".[222] In July 2018, Carey embarked on a new Las Vegas residency, The Butterfly Returns, which received critical acclaim.[223][224] Its first 12 shows in 2018 grossed $3.6 million, with dates later extending into 2019 and 2020.[225] Following the residency, Carey embarked on her Mariah Carey: Live in Concert tour in Asia and returned to Europe with her All I Want for Christmas Is You concert series.[226][227] In September 2018, Carey announced plans to release her fifteenth studio album later in the year.[228][229] The project was announced alongside the release of a new song titled \"GTFO\",[230] which she performed on September 21, 2018, when she headlined the 2018 iHeartRadio Music Festival.[231] The album's lead single, \"With You\", was released in October and performed for the first time at the American Music Awards of 2018.[232] It became Carey's highest-charting non-holiday song on the US Adult Contemporary chart since \"We Belong Together\" in 2005. This was followed by a second single, \"A No No\".[233] The album, titled Caution, was released on November 16, 2018, and received universal acclaim from critics.[234] By December 2018, the album had been featured on numerous year-end lists by music critics and publications.[235] In February 2019, Carey commenced the Caution World Tour in support of the album.[236] Later in 2019, Carey engaged in a series of business and television ventures. On September 18, 2019, Carey released \"In the Mix\", the theme song for the ABC sitcom Mixed-ish.[237] On November 1, 2019, Carey re-released her holiday album Merry Christmas for its 25th anniversary. The album package included the original album and another disc which include live performances from Carey's 1994 concert at St. John the Divine Church, several tracks from Merry Christmas II You, as well as other stand-alone singles such as \"Lil Snowman\" and \"The Star\".[238] On December 5, 2019, it was announced that a mini-documentary titled Mariah Carey Is Christmas!, charting the creation and subsequent cultural legacy of \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" was to be produced and broadcast on Amazon Music; it premiered later that month.[239] Peaking at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 for the first time the same year, the song ended up giving Carey her nineteenth chart-topper in the US.[240] In January 2020, it was announced that Carey would be inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.[241] Carey celebrated the 30th anniversary of her debut album through 2020, in a promotional campaign billed \"#MC30\".[242] The first release consisted of the live EP The Live Debut – 1990 which was released on July 17, 2020.[243] Her memoir, The Meaning of Mariah Carey which was co-written with Michaela Angela Davis, was published in September of the same year.[244] The memoir reached number one on The New York Times Best Seller list after its first week of release. On October 2, 2020, Carey released a compilation album titled The Rarities, which includes rare and unreleased songs that Carey recorded at various stages of her career.[245] Its songs included \"Save the Day\" featuring Lauryn Hill[246] and a cover of Irene Cara's \"Out Here on My Own\".[247] At the end of October, Carey was featured on Busta Rhymes' single \"Where I Belong\".[248] Carey's 2020 Christmas special, Mariah Carey's Magical Christmas Special, premiered on December 4, 2020, on Apple TV+ along with a soundtrack. A new version of Carey's 2010 song \"Oh Santa!\", featuring Ariana Grande and Jennifer Hudson, was released as a single the same day.[249] \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" topped the UK chart for the first time that month, becoming her third number one in the nation,[250] and spent an unprecedented 69 weeks in its top 40 before reaching the summit.[251] In July 2021, Carey was featured on the track \"Somewhat Loved\" from Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis' debut studio album Jam & Lewis: Volume One.[252] On November 5, 2021, Carey released \"Fall in Love at Christmas\", which features Khalid and Kirk Franklin. The single was performed on her second Christmas special, Mariah's Christmas: The Magic Continues.[253] In March 2022, Carey was featured alongside DJ Khaled on the remix of Latto's single \"Big Energy\", which interpolates Carey's 1995 single \"Fantasy\".[254] In April, an online course from MasterClass based on singing, in which Carey served as a vocal coach, was released.[255] On September 16, 2022, an expanded version of Butterfly was released for the 25th anniversary of the album.[256][257] In November, Carey released a children's picture book titled The Christmas Princess, co-written with Michaela Angela Davis and illustrated by Fuuji Takashi.[258][259] In December 2022, Carey performed two pairs of shows at Scotiabank Arena in Toronto and Madison Square Garden in New York City.[260] Carey also served as a co-producer of Some Like It Hot on Broadway theatre, a musical based on the 1959 comedy film Some Like It Hot.[261] It earned her a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Musical.[262] In February 2023, the 2009 track \"It's a Wrap\" experienced a revival on TikTok, prompting Carey to release an EP for the song, which included a new sped-up version.[263] On September 8, 2023, she released a deluxe version of Music Box in celebration of the album's thirtieth anniversary.[264] A remix of \"Workin Hard\" by Terry Hunter, which featured on the deluxe album, was nominated for Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical at the 66th Annual Grammy Awards.[265] Carey embarked on her 16-date concert tour, Merry Christmas One and All!, which ran from November 15 to December 17, 2023, in the United States.[266] The tour grossed approximately $30 million and sold more than 200,000 tickets.[267] On February 16, 2024, Carey featured on the remix of Ariana Grande's single \"Yes, And?\", which was included in the \"slightly deluxe\" edition of Grande's seventh studio album, Eternal Sunshine.[268] On April 12, Carey began a new residency at the Dolby Live in Las Vegas titled The Celebration of Mimi.[269][270] On May 21, Carey appeared on the remix to Muni Long's \"Made for Me\".[271][272] In June, Carey released an expanded edition of Rainbow to coincide with its twenty-fifth anniversary.[273] While promoting the re-release, she said that new music was being worked on.[274] On November 6, 2024, Carey embarked on Mariah Carey's Christmas Time tour to celebrate the 30th anniversary of Merry Christmas. It shall conclude the following December 17.[275][276] A thirtieth anniversary edition of Merry Christmas was also released.[277] Carey has said that from childhood she has been influenced by Billie Holiday, Sarah Vaughan as well as R&B and soul musicians including Al Green, Stevie Wonder, Gladys Knight, Aretha Franklin, and George Michael. Her music contains strong influences of gospel music, and she credits the Clark Sisters, Shirley Caesar, and Edwin Hawkins as the most influential in her early years.[278][279] When Carey incorporated hip hop into her sound, speculation arose that she was making an attempt to take advantage of the genre's popularity, but she told Newsweek, \"People just don't understand. I grew up with this music.\"[280] She has expressed appreciation for rappers such as the Sugarhill Gang, Eric B. & Rakim, the Wu-Tang Clan, The Notorious B.I.G. and Mobb Deep, with whom she collaborated on the single \"The Roof (Back in Time)\" (1998). Carey was heavily influenced by Minnie Riperton, and began experimenting with the whistle register due to her original practice of the range.[281] During Carey's career, her vocal and musical style, along with her level of success, has been compared to Whitney Houston, whom she has also cited as an influence.[282] Carey and her peers, according to Garry Mulholland, are \"the princesses of wails... virtuoso vocalists who blend chart-oriented pop with mature MOR torch song.\" Author and writer Lucy O'Brien attributed the comeback of Barbra Streisand's \"old-fashioned showgirl\" to Carey and Celine Dion, and described them and Houston as \"groomed, airbrushed and overblown to perfection.\" Carey's musical transition and use of more revealing clothing during the late 1990s were, in part, initiated to distance herself from this image, and she subsequently said that most of her early work was \"schmaltzy MOR.\"[283] Some have noted that unlike Houston and Dion, Carey writes and produces her own music.[284] Love is the subject of the majority of Carey's lyrics, although she has written about themes such as loss, sex, race, abuse and spirituality.[285][286] Andrew Chan of the University of Texas Press identifies \"the purging of private emotions\" as the main theme of Carey's ballads, though he believes several others aim to have an \"all-purpose feeling\" with mass appeal.[287] Carey has said that much of her work is partly autobiographical, but Time magazine's Christopher John Farley wrote: \"If only Mariah Carey's music had the drama of her life. Her songs are often sugary and artificial—NutraSweet soul. But her life has passion and conflict,\" applying it to the first stages of her career. He commented that as her albums progressed, so too her songwriting and music blossomed into more mature and meaningful material.[288] Jim Faber of the New York Daily News, made similar comments, \"For Carey, vocalizing is all about the performance, not the emotions that inspired it. Singing, to her, represents a physical challenge, not an emotional unburdening.\"[289] While reviewing Music Box, Stephen Holden from Rolling Stone commented that Carey sang with \"sustained passion,\" while Arion Berger of Entertainment Weekly wrote that during some vocal moments, Carey becomes \"too overwhelmed to put her passion into words.\"[290] In 2001, The Village Voice wrote that \"Carey's Strawberry Shortcake soul still provides the template with which teen-pop cuties draw curlicues around those centerless [Diane] Warren ballads.\"[291] Carey gained public perception as a balladeer with her first few releases.[292] Following her divorce with Tommy Mottola, Carey broke free of adult contemporary arrangements in favor of what Alex Macpherson of The Guardian described as \"a lovingly crafted, hip-hop-inflected quiet storm\".[293] Carey often records her layered background vocals, which have been described as \"a swooning bank of a hundred Mariahs\".[294] The singer has said that \"it's because I started out as a backup singer and doing sessions as a background vocalist learning from some of the greatest background vocalists, and also people like Luther Vandross. Growing up, I admired his texture in and of itself but also his use of background vocals\".[295] Carey's songwriting is noted for its \"eccentric verbosity\".[293][296][297] Jeffrey Ingold of Vice argues that her lyrics are \"among the most verbose in pop music.\"[298] Since the beginning of her career, Carey has repeatedly described herself as a songwriter and producer and emphasized the importance of being acknowledged for these roles.[299] Carey's output makes use of electronic instruments such as drum machines,[120] keyboards and synthesizers.[300] Many of her songs contain piano-driven melodies,[301] as she was given piano lessons at age six. Carey said that she cannot read sheet music and prefers to collaborate with a pianist when composing her material, but feels that it is easier to experiment with faster and less-conventional melodies and chord progressions using this technique.[10] While Carey learned to play the piano at a young age, and incorporates several ranges of production and instrumentation into her music, she has maintained that her voice has always been her most important asset: \"My voice is my instrument; it always has been.\"[83] Carey began commissioning remixes of her material early in her career and helped to spearhead the practice of recording entirely new vocals for remixes.[302] Disc jockey David Morales has collaborated with Carey on several occasions, starting with \"Dreamlover\" (1993), which popularized the tradition of remixing R&B songs into house records, and which Slant Magazine named one of the greatest dance songs.[303] From \"Fantasy\" (1995) onward, Carey enlisted both hip hop and house producers to re-structure her album compositions.[69] Entertainment Weekly included two remixes of \"Fantasy\" on a list of Carey's greatest recordings compiled in 2005: a National Dance Music Award-winning remix produced by Morales, and a Sean Combs production featuring rapper Ol' Dirty Bastard.[304] The latter has been credited with popularizing the pop and hip hop collaboration trend that has continued into the 2000s, through artists such as Ashanti and Beyoncé.[302] Combs said that Carey \"knows the importance of mixes, so you feel like you're with an artist who appreciates your work—an artist who wants to come up with something with you.\"[305] Carey possesses a five-octave vocal range.[306][307][308] Regarding her type of voice, several critics have described her as a lyric coloratura soprano or just a soprano.[309][310] Jon Pareles of The New York Times described Carey's lower register as a \"rich, husky alto\" that extends to \"dog-whistle high notes.\"[311] She once described herself as an alto singer.[312] Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker adds her timbre on \"Vision of Love\" possesses various colors, stating, \"Carey's sound changes with nearly every line, mutating from a steely tone to a vibrating growl and then to a humid, breathy coo.\"[54] Chan believes that Carey moved through several \"vocal personas\" throughout her discography, like the \"stentorian, full-throated belting of her first few albums; the fluid mix of chest and head voice deployed to masterful effect in the mid-1990s; and the delicate, foggy tones and manic cadences that predominated after the turn of the millennium\".[313] In an analysis of Carey's voice for ClassicFM, singer Catherine Bott claims that Carey's chest voice could go up \"higher in pitch\" compared to classical singer.\"[314] Her sense of pitch is admired and Jon Pareles adds \"she can linger over sensual turns, growl with playful confidence, syncopate like a scat singer... with startlingly exact pitch.\"[311] Carey claims that she has had nodules on her vocal cords since childhood, enabling her to sing in a higher register than others. However, tiredness and sleep deprivation can affect them due to the nodules, and Carey explained that she went through a lot of practice as a child to maintain a balance during singing.[281][315] Carey is noted for her vocal improvisation skills.[316][317] Towards the late 1990s, she began incorporating breathy vocals into her material.[318] Tim Levell from BBC News described her vocals as \"sultry close-to-the-mic breathiness,\"[318] while USA Today's Elysa Gardner wrote \"it's impossible to deny the impact her vocal style, a florid blend of breathy riffing and resonant belting, has had on today's young pop and R&B stars.\"[319] In an interview, Ron Givens of Entertainment Weekly described it this way, \"first, a rippling, soulful ooh comes rolling effortlessly from her throat: alto. Then, after a quick breath, she goes for the stratosphere, with a sound that nearly changes the barometric pressure in the room. In one brief swoop, she seems to squeal and roar at the same time.\"[320] Alex Macpherson of The Guardian noted that Carey's voice on Butterfly is \"an instrument of texture rather than volume, with pillows of lavishly layered vocals and nuanced phrasing magnifying the emotional intensity of the songs.\"[293] Randy Jackson said that \"It's in the tone, that buttery tone that she has with her voice that is unbelievably amazing and unbelievably identifiable.\"[321] Despite being called a \"show stopper\" and \"the 1990s pop phenomenon\",[322] Carey suffered from stage fright in her early years in the music industry.[323] One of her earliest performances was at MTV Unplugged, which received positive reception as Carey silenced critics saying her vocals were studio-made.[324][325] Chan identifies the Milli Vanilli lip syncing controversy as a potential contributor to the initial accusations.[299] Carey's \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" rendition at the Super Bowl XXXVI was called \"stunning\" by Billboard.[326] She also performed \"America the Beautiful\" at the 1990 NBA Finals in which Rolling Stone writer, Brittany Spanos, stated the players were struck \"with awe by the incredible talent of a burgeoning young star\".[327] The singer received the only standing ovation of the night at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards, after performing the medley of \"We Belong Together and \"Fly Like a Bird\".[328] Although Carey's performance at Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve 2017 was marred by technical issues, she returned to the stage a year later and, according to Time, \"effectively redeemed herself\".[329] Carey is known for being very static during her live performances. Some reviewers credited her stage fright and lack of confidence as the reasoning,[330][331] while others pointed out that her performances focus on her vocals and the quality of her songs.[332] Her onstage hand gesticulations have usually been mimicked,[333] as the singer has a tendency for \"using her hands to point, flutter and sweep through the air as she deftly crests each run\".[334] When reviewing Carey's 2014 concert, Michael Lallo wrote that \"If you're Mariah, you ... stroke your hair a lot. When a high note is on the horizon, you brace yourself by touching your ear and adopting a pained expression, provoking the crowd into losing its collective mind.\"[335] Carey had been open about the fact that she had not been happy with some of her early music videos, and has subsequently been noted for self-directing and co-producing her subsequent videography.[336] The music video for \"Fantasy\" was the first that Carey directed entirely on her own,[337] and \"Honey\" pushed Carey further towards hip hop and R&B than before.[337] Its music video gained further attention, as Carey, for the first time in her career, was provocatively dressed, giving viewers a \"taste of the freer Mariah.\"[337] In 2007, author Saul Austerlitz wrote Carey had been \"marketed as a whitebread pop princess\" in her earlier music videos, adding the plots, directorial styles, clothes, and auras from later videos like \"Heartbreaker\" were very different and she was displayed as an \"R&B diva\".[338] Billboard ranked Carey 73rd on its list of \"The 100 Greatest Music Video Artists of All Time\" in 2020, stating that \"over three decades, [Carey] has gone from breezy girl next door, flaunting a denim collection as wide as her vocal range, to secret agent, runaway bride and even her own stalker in a collection of music videos that play like mini-dramas\".[339] The music video for \"The Roof\" was ranked 18th on Slant Magazine's \"100 Greatest Music Videos.[340] The music videos for \"Honey\" and \"Heartbreaker\" remain among the most expensive ever made, costing over $2 million.[341][342] In 2021, Carey was honoured at the African American Film Critics Association with a Special Achievement Innovator Award for her \"visual storytelling in her music videos and specials\".[343] Throughout her career, Carey has been called a pop icon,[344][345][346] a gay icon,[347] and a fashion icon.[348] Guinness World Records and music critics have dubbed Carey the \"Songbird Supreme\".[349][350][351] She has been labeled a \"diva\" for her stardom and persona.[352] Her diva persona has received heavy attention, gaining admiration from her fans.[353][354] Author Lily E. Hirsch argues that while Carey has displayed diva behavior during several incidents in her career, the media's association of the term with her is influenced by gender.[355] Carey's style has often been described as \"eccentric\" and \"over the top\".[356][357] Throughout her career, she has also been used in several social media memes, gaining the \"Queen of Shade\" title from Elle.[358] Carey's reactions in various interviews have often gone viral, becoming the originator for various memes including \"I don't know her\".[359] Carey's public image has undergone significant transformations, often receiving heavy media attention. Early in her career, Carey had a polished image, influenced by Mottola and his control over her career. After their separation, Carey took on a more provocative image in her career and has since been called a sex symbol.[360][361] Her career has received heavy media attention, particularly during the rollout of her 2001 film, Glitter which became \"tabloid legend\".[362][363] Academic Shara Rambarran believes that Carey has matched the media's intense scrutiny and attention on her personal life through \"her diva attitude, performance, identity, and music\".[364] Carey's enduring popularity as a musician has received extensive recognition and often praised for its longevity.[365][366] She has been credited for her role in breaking down racial barriers in popular culture and facilitating public discourse surrounding multiracialism in the music industry.[367] Carey has also been credited for popularizing the use of melisma amongst her peers and the generation after her, and has often been considered one of the greatest vocalists in pop music.[368] Carey has influenced numerous artists and her music has also been recorded, performed or sampled by a variety of acts.[369][370][371][372] In a 2010 article for The New York Times, David Browne wrote that in the early 1990s, \"melisma overtook pop in a way it hadn't before. Mariah Carey's debut hit from 1990, 'Vision of Love', [set] the bar insanely high for notes stretched louder, longer and knottier than most pop fans had ever heard\". He added that because of this, various artists have since \"built their careers around melisma\" including Christina Aguilera, Jennifer Hudson and Beyoncé.[373] \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\", as well as its parent album Merry Christmas, have become such a ubiquitous part of wider popular culture that Carey's name became synonymous with the season, and she has since been dubbed the \"Queen of Christmas\".[374] Multiple media sources have referred to Carey as a holiday icon.[375][376][377] The singer has often incorporated holiday-themed outfits during her Christmas shows and music videos.[375] Throughout her career, Carey has earned numerous awards and honors. She has won six Grammy Awards (including a Grammy Global Impact Award),[378] nineteen World Music Awards, ten American Music Awards,[379] and twenty Billboard Music Awards.[380] Carey is one of the best-selling recording artists in history, with more than 220 million records sold.[381] She is also an inductee of the Songwriters Hall of Fame,[241] according to whom she is \"the all-time most successful female songwriter in chart history\",[382] and The Long Island Music and Entertainment Hall of Fame.[383] Carey was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2015,[384] and a Billboard Icon Award in 2019.[385] In 2023, she became one of the first 13 recipients of the BRIT Billion Award, for surpassing the milestone one billion streams in the United Kingdom.[386] Declining offers to appear in commercials in the United States during her early career, Carey was not involved in brand marketing initiatives until 2006, when she participated in endorsements for Intel Centrino personal computers and launched a jewelry and accessories line for teenagers, Glamorized, in American Claire's and Icing stores.[387] During this period, as part of a partnership with Pepsi and Motorola, Carey recorded and promoted a series of exclusive ringtones, including \"Time of Your Life\".[388] She signed a licensing deal with the cosmetics company Elizabeth Arden, and in 2007, she released her own fragrance, \"M\".[389] The Elizabeth Arden deal has netted her $150 million.[390] For the fragrance, Carey won a Basenotes Fragrance Award for Best Celebrity Women's Fragrance as well as being nominated in three other categories.[391] She has released a series of fragrances with Elizabeth Arden, including Luscious Pink (2008) and Forever (2009).[392][393] On November 29, 2010, she debuted a collection on HSN, which included jewelry, shoes and fragrances.[394] In November 2011, Carey was announced as \"brand ambassador\" for Jenny Craig, Inc. which included \"participation in a new company initiative... public service announcements and community and education programs.\"[395] In 2018, Carey featured in an advertisement for Hostelworld with the tagline \"Even Divas are Believers\".[396] On August 25, 2019, Carey signed a $12 million contract with the Walkers crisps brand as part of their Christmas campaign[397] and starred in a commercial for the company.[398] In December 2020, Carey launched a partnership with Virtual Dining Concepts and restaurateur, Robert Earl, for a biscuit line titled Mariah's Cookies.[399] In 2021, Carey announced the launch of a new line of alcohol called Black Irish, an homage to her Black, Venezuelan, and Irish heritage.[400] That same year, Carey also partnered with McDonald's, promoting an entirely new limited time menu.[401] In 2022, Carey recorded nine video lessons for MasterClass titled \"Mariah Carey Teaches the Voice as an Instrument\", as well as re-recording \"The Roof (Back in Time)\" alongside Brandy.[402] Carey is a philanthropist who has been involved with several charitable organizations. She became associated with the Fresh Air Fund in the early 1990s, and co-founded a camp located in Fishkill, New York, that enables inner-city youth to embrace the arts and introduces them to career opportunities.[403] The camp was called Camp Mariah \"for her generous support and dedication to Fresh Air children,\" and she received a Congressional Horizon Award for her youth-related charity work.[404] Carey has continued her direct involvement with Camp Mariah, and by 2019 the executive director of The Fresh Air Fund reported that \"...the kids who have gone to Camp Mariah have higher graduation rates out of high school and college.[405] In 1999, Carey was presented with a Congressional Award for contributing \"to expanding opportunities for all Americans through their own personal contributions, and [setting] exceptional examples for young people through their own successes in life.[406] In 2019, she was honored by Variety's Power of Women for her work with The Fresh Air Fund's Camp Mariah.[407] Carey also donated royalties from her songs \"Hero\" and \"One Sweet Day\" to charities.[408] She has worked with the Make-A-Wish Foundation, and in November 2006 she was awarded the Foundation's Wish Idol for her \"extraordinary generosity and her many wish granting achievements.\"[409][410] Carey has volunteered for the Police Athletic League of New York City and contributed to the obstetrics department of New York Presbyterian Hospital Cornell Medical Center. A percentage of the sales of MTV Unplugged was donated to various other charities.[411] In 2008, Carey was named Hunger Ambassador of the World Hunger Relief Movement.[412] In February 2010, the song, \"100%\", which was originally written and recorded for the film, Precious,[413] was used as one of the theme songs for the 2010 Winter Olympics, with all money proceeds going to Team USA.[414] In 2017, Carey was awarded with PETA's Angel for Animals Award for promoting animal adoption through her animated movie All I Want for Christmas Is You.[415] One of Carey's most high-profile benefit concert appearances was on VH1's 1998 Divas Live special, during which she performed alongside other female singers in support of the Save the Music Foundation. The concert was a ratings success, and Carey participated in the Divas 2000 special and a 2016 holiday edition.[84][416] She appeared at the America: A Tribute to Heroes nationally televised fundraiser in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks and performed before peacekeeping troops in Kosovo.[417] Carey hosted the CBS television special At Home for the Holidays, which documented real-life stories of adopted children and foster families.[418] In 2005, Carey performed for Live 8 in London[419] and at the Hurricane Katrina relief telethon \"Shelter from the Storm\".[420] In August 2008, Carey and other singers recorded the charity single, \"Just Stand Up\" produced by Babyface and L.A. Reid, to support Stand Up to Cancer.[421] During the COVID-19 pandemic, Carey participated in the iHeart Living Room Concert for America and Rise Up New York! telethons to raise money for those affected by COVID-19.[422][423] In response to the murder of George Floyd, Carey took to social media and sang a snippet of her 1990 song \"There's Got to Be a Way\" while encouraging fans to demand justice.[424] In 2008, Carey performed in a New Year's Eve concert for the family of Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. She later said she felt \"horrible and embarrassed\" to have taken part in the concert.[425] To make amends, in March 2011, Carey's representative Cindi Berger stated that royalties for the song \"Save the Day\", written for her fourteenth studio album, would be donated to charities that create awareness for human rights. Berger also said that Carey \"has and continues to donate her time, money and countless hours of personal service to many organizations both here and abroad.\"[408] \"Save the Day\" remained unreleased until 2020.[245] In 2013, human rights activists criticized Carey for performing in a concert for Angola's \"father-daughter kleptocracy\" and accused her of accepting \"dictator cash\".[426] Carey stated in 2006: \"I do believe that I have been born again in a lot of ways. I think what I've changed are my priorities and my relationships with God. I feel the difference when I don't have my private moments to pray... I'm a fighter, but I learned that I'm not in charge. Whatever God wants to happen is what's going to happen. I feel like I've had endless second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth chances. It's by the grace of God I'm still here.\"[427] Carey began dating Tommy Mottola while recording Mariah Carey,[44] and they were married at the Episcopal Saint Thomas Church in New York City on June 5, 1993, in a half-million dollar ceremony.[45] The newlyweds moved into a custom-built mansion, located on a 51-acre (21 ha) estate in Bedford, New York, referred to by Carey as \"Sing Sing\"[428] (alluding to her feeling imprisoned there).[429] After the release of Daydream and the success that followed, Carey began focusing on her personal life, which was a constant struggle at the time. Their relationship began to deteriorate due to their growing creative differences in terms of her music, as well as Mottola's controlling nature.[430] They separated in December 1996,[431] and announced it publicly on May 30, 1997.[432] The couple divorced on March 4, 1998.[433] Shortly afterwards they sold their home to Nelson Peltz for $20.5 million;[434] it burned down in 1999.[435] Carey was in a relationship with baseball player Derek Jeter from 1997 to 1998,[436] and with singer Luis Miguel from 1998 to 2001.[98] She began dating actor and comedian Nick Cannon while conceiving the music video for her song \"Bye Bye\", which they filmed together on an island off the coast of Antigua in April 2008.[437] They were married on April 30, 2008, in the Bahamas.[438] That same year, Carey suffered a miscarriage.[439] At 35 weeks into her next pregnancy, she gave birth to their fraternal twins, Moroccan and Monroe, on April 30, 2011,[440] via caesarean section.[441] In August 2014, Cannon confirmed he and Carey had separated.[442] He filed for divorce on December 12, 2014,[443] which was finalized in 2016.[444] In 2015, Carey began dating Australian billionaire James Packer and, on January 21, 2016, she announced they were engaged.[445] By October, however, they had called off the engagement.[446] In October 2016, she began dating American choreographer Bryan Tanaka.[447] On December 26, 2023, Tanaka confirmed that he and Carey had parted ways after seven years of dating.[448] In April 2018, Carey opened up about taking therapy sessions and medication for her struggle with bipolar II disorder. She was diagnosed in 2001 and initially kept the diagnosis private.[449] Headlining tours Co-headlining tours Residencies",

                "content": "Mariah Carey (born March 27, 1969)[a] is an American singer, songwriter, record producer, actress, philanthropist, author and businesswoman. She is best known for the song \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\". She is recognized as the Queen of Christmas and Songbird Supreme by the Guinness World Records with her five-octave coloratura soprano voice, melismatic singing style and her signature use of the whistle register. She has sold over 200 million copies worldwide and is one of the best-selling artists of all time. She has sold over 71 million albums in the US alone, the most US albums sold for a female artist.[4] Mariah Carey was born on March 27, 1969, in Huntington, New York, the daughter of Alfred Roy Carey, an African American and Afro-Venezuelan ancestry and Patricia Hickey, an Irish ancestry. She is the youngest of three children. Carey's father is an aeronautical engineer while her mother is a opera singer and a freelance vocal coach. Her siblings are Morgan (born 1960) and Alison (born 1962). Her parents divorced when she was three years old. She practiced playing piano when she was a little girl.[5] In December 1988, Carey started making her first album. She released her self-titled debut studio album in 1990. It was released from Columbia Records. The album was certified multi-platinum by the RIAA. Four singles from the album all reached number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart (\"Vision of Love\", \"Love Takes Time\", \"Someday\", and \"I Don't Wanna Cry\"). It reached number one on the US Billboard 200. It was certified 9× platinum. This means that 9 million copies of the album were shipped in the US. Carey married Tommy Mottola, the head of Sony Music, in 1993. Mottola was the executive producer for Carey. Many critics believed that this helped Carey's musical career. In 1991, her second album Emotions reached number four on the Billboard 200. It was certified 4× platinum and sold less than her previous album. Her songs \"Emotions\" (#1), \"Can't Let Go\" (#2), and \"Make It Happen\" (#5) were released as singles from the album. Carey released her first EP MTV Unplugged (1992). It reached number three on the Billboard 200. The songs \"I'll Be There\" (#1) and \"If It's Over\" were released as singles from the album. Carey's third album Music Box (1993) reached number one on the Billboard 200. As of 2012, the album has sold 10,000,000 copies in the US, according to Nielsen Soundcan, and was certified Diamond because of this. Worldwide, it sold 32 million copies and became one of the best-selling albums of all time. \"Dreamlover\" (#1), \"Hero\" (#1), \"Without You\" (#3), \"Never Forget You\" (#3), and \"Anytime You Need a Friend\" (#12) helped Carey to become more popular. Her fourth studio album and first holiday album, Merry Christmas (1994), reached number three on the Billboard 200 chart. Two singles were released: \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" and \"Joy to the World\". Carey's fifth album Daydream became her third number-one album in the US. It was given a diamond award from the RIAA. This means that 10 million copies of the album were shipped in the US. There were six singles for the album. They include \"Fantasy\" (#1), \"One Sweet Day\" (#1), \"Open Arms\", \"Always Be My Baby\" (#1), \"Forever\" (#9) and \"Underneath the Stars\". On September 16, 1997, Carey released her sixth album Butterfly. The album reached number one on the Billboard 200 chart. The album released five singles. They include \"Honey\" (#1), \"Butterfly\" (#16), \"The Roof (Back in Time)\", \"Breakdown\" (#53) and \"My All\" (#1). On November 2, 1999, her seventh album Rainbow was released. After selling 323,000 copies the first week, it debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 chart. It featured her fifteenth number-one US single, \"Thank God I Found You\" (with R&B singer Joe and boy band 98°), along with a cover of singer Phil Collins' song \"Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now)\". The cover reached number one in the UK. Carey starred in the movie Glitter in 2001. It did not do so well and grossed $5,271,666 out of a $20,000,000 budget. It was released on the day of the September 11 attacks.[6] It was nominated for several \"worst movie\" categories. The soundtrack did better than the movie. The single \"Loverboy\" reached number two on the Billboard Hot 100. In 2002, her album Charmbracelet was released. Her 2005 album, The Emancipation of Mimi, became one of her most successful albums. Many music critics believed it was her \"comeback album\". It contained her sixteenth and seventeenth US number-one hits, \"We Belong Together\" and \"Don't Forget About Us\". \"We Belong Together\" was the number-one song of 2005 and of the 2000s decade in the US. Her following album, E=MC² (2008), featured her eighteenth number-one song, \"Touch My Body\". With this, Carey holds the most US number-ones for a solo artist in history. However, this album, along with its followups Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel (2009) and Merry Christmas II You (2010), did not sell well. She played the role of a social worker, Ms. Weiss, in the 2009 movie Precious. In 2013, she was a judge on the competition series American Idol. Carey's fourteenth album, Me. I Am Mariah… The Elusive Chanteuse, was released in 2014 and reached number three on the Billboard 200. The song \"#Beautiful\", featuring R&B singer Miguel, was released in May 2013 as the first single from the album. It reached the top fifteen in the US and was certified platinum. The next single, \"The Art of Letting Go\", was released on November 11, 2013. \"You're Mine (Eternal)\" was released in time for Valentine's Day in 2014 as the third single from the album. Carey released a greatest hits collection, #1 to Infinity, in 2015. It features all eighteen of her US number-one songs along with a new song, \"Infinity\". She performed a Las Vegas residency show at Caesars Palace called Mariah Carey #1 to Infinity and completed her Sweet Sweet Fantasy Tour across Europe. She performed at the New Year's Eve countdown show, Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve with Ryan Seacrest, on December 31, 2016. This performance was not received well by viewers. Her in-ear monitors were not working, which led her to walk around the stage and eventually lip-sync \"We Belong Together\". On February 3, 2017, she released a new single, \"I Don't\", featuring rapper YG. Footage was shown of Carey recording the song on her docuseries, Mariah's World. In October 2017, a new song, \"The Star\", was released for the soundtrack of a film of the same name. During Christmas 2017, \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" reached a new high of #9 on the Billboard Hot 100. Carey again performed at Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve with Ryan Seacrest on New Year's Eve 2017. This performance was much more acclaimed than the one of the previous year. The song finally reached number one for the week ending December 19, 2019.[7] It became Carey's nineteenth US number-one, continuing her record of the most number-ones in the US by a soloist. Carey revealed that she had joined rapper Jay-Z's company, Roc Nation, for management.[8] In 2020, Carey announced that she would be releasing an autobiography, The Meaning of Mariah Carey, on September 29, 2020.[9] She is also releasing a compilation album, The Rarities, on October 2, 2020.[10] Carey possesses a five-octave coloratura soprano vocal range. She lists Aretha Franklin, Patti LaBelle, Chaka Khan, Luther Vandross, Michael Jackson, Deniece Williams, Minnie Riperton, Diana Ross, Natalie Cole, Whitney Houston, Donna Summer, Billie Holiday, Sarah Vaughan Al Green, George Michael, Stevie Wonder and Gladys Knight as her musical influences. She cited Minnie Riperton as one of her musical influences for the use of a whistle register. During the release of Glitter, Carey suffered a breakdown and was put in the hospital for exhaustion.[11] Carey married Nick Cannon on April 30, 2008.[12] On their 3rd wedding anniversary, she gave birth to her fraternal twins, a boy, Moroccan and a girl, Monroe. Cannon announced his separation from Carey in 2014. He filed for divorce the same year of their separation and it was finalized in 2016. Carey became engaged to Australian billionaire James Packer in 2016.[13] However, Carey's E! docuseries, Mariah's World, showed their breakup while she was on the Sweet Sweet Fantasy Tour. She dated her backup dancer, Bryan Tanaka, on and off from November 2016 until April 2017 before resuming their relationship later in 2017.[14][15] He later became Carey's creative director. Tanaka announced their separation on social media in December 2023.[16] In November 2017, Carey was accused of sexual harassment by a former security official, Michael Anello.[17] On April 18, 2018, Carey was accused of sexual harassment by a former manager Stella Stolper.[18][19] Carey denies the allegations.[19] Palm Springs International Film Festival Breakthrough Performance Award Capri Hollywood International Film Festival Award for Supporting Actress of the Year Black Reel Award for Best Ensemble Boston Society of Film Critics Award for Best Ensemble Cast Nominated – Black Reel Award for Best Supporting Actress Nominated – NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture Nominated – Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Cast in a Motion Picture Nominated – Critics' Choice Awards for Best Acting Ensemble",

                "content": "Our editors will review what you’ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article. Mariah Carey is an American pop singer noted for her remarkable vocal range. She was one of the most successful female performers of the 1990s and has remained popular since then. Mariah Carey was born in Huntington, New York, in the United States. After graduating from high school in 1987, Mariah Carey made a demo tape that led Tommy Mottola, an executive at Columbia Records, to sign her in 1988. Her debut album, Mariah Carey, was released in 1990 and showcased her talent and ability. In 1991 Carey won Grammy Awards for best new artist and best female pop vocalist. Mariah Carey’s first marriage was to Tommy Mottola, an executive at Columbia Records, which released her early albums. Carey was married to Mottola from 1993 to 1998. Carey then married comedian and rapper Nick Cannon in 2008; their divorce was finalized in 2016. In addition to five Grammy Awards, Mariah Carey has won numerous Billboard Music Awards and World Music Awards. She also has had 19 number-one songs in the U.S., which is short of the Beatles’ record by one. Carey also appeared in films and on television shows. Mariah Carey (born March 27, 1969, Huntington, New York, U.S.) is an American pop singer, noted for her remarkable vocal range. She was one of the most successful female performers of the 1990s and remained popular into the early 21st century. While some sources state that Carey was born in 1970, a newspaper from 1969 features her birth announcement. Her mother was a vocal coach and former opera singer, and Carey began performing as a child. After graduating (1987) from high school in Greenlawn, New York, she moved to New York City to pursue a singing career. Carey made a demo tape that led Tommy Mottola, an executive at Columbia Records, to sign her in 1988; the couple married in 1993. Her debut album, Mariah Carey (1990), showcased her incredible vocal range and blended several musical genres, including gospel, pop, and rhythm and blues (R&B). It was a huge success, and in 1991 Carey won Grammy Awards for best new artist and best female pop vocalist. That same year the title track from her follow-up album, Emotions, became her fifth consecutive chart-topping single. Subsequent hit albums included Music Box (1993) and Daydream (1995), both of which sold some 10 million copies in the United States, as well as the holiday-themed Merry Christmas (1994). The latter featured “All I Want for Christmas Is You,” which became a holiday classic and one of the best-selling songs of all time. This and her other recordings were accompanied by music videos that helped make Carey a fixture on the cable network MTV. Despite such success, Carey grew tired of the sweet and wholesome image that her label had developed for her. After announcing her separation from Mottola in 1997 (they divorced in 1998), she released Butterfly (1997), which reflected her new independence. The album was heavily influenced by hip-hop and rap, and the related music videos revealed a more sexual Carey. The single “Heartbreaker” (featuring Jay-Z) topped the charts in 1999, making Carey the first artist to hit number one on the Billboard singles chart in each year of a decade. The achievement underscored her status as one of the best-selling vocalists in the world that decade. In 2001 Carey signed an $80 million contract with Virgin Records that made her the highest-paid recording artist. Her career was soon interrupted, however, when she suffered a breakdown and was hospitalized following erratic behaviour. (Carey revealed in 2018 that she had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder.) She starred in Glitter (2001), but both the semiautobiographical film and its accompanying album did not fare well. In 2002 Virgin terminated its contract with Carey. Later that year she signed with Island/Def Jam, but her first album for the label, Charmbracelet (2002), was a disappointment. However, her follow-up, The Emancipation of Mimi (2005), was a critical and commercial success, becoming the top-selling album of the year in the United States, with more than six million copies sold. It also earned three Grammy Awards, including best contemporary R&B album. “Touch My Body,” from E=MC2 (2008), became Carey’s 18th number one song on the Billboard singles chart, moving her past Elvis Presley on the all-time list and leaving her just two short of the Beatles’ record. Carey’s later recordings included Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel (2009), a second Christmas album (2010), Me. I Am Mariah…The Elusive Chanteuse (2014), and Caution (2018). She also starred in Mariah Carey’s Magical Christmas Special and Mariah’s Christmas: The Magic Continues (2021), both of which aired on Apple TV+. In addition to her recording career, Carey continued to act. After appearing in the drama Tennessee (2008), she earned praise for her portrayal of a social worker in the critically acclaimed Precious (2009). Her later film credits included Lee Daniels’ The Butler (2013) and Girls Trip (2017). She also lent her voice to All I Want for Christmas Is You (2017), an animated film inspired by her hit song. In 2013 she joined the television talent show American Idol as a judge for its 12th season, and two years later she began a series of residencies in Las Vegas, with her last appearance in 2020. Her memoir, The Meaning of Mariah Carey (written with Michaela Angela Davis), was published in 2020. Carey also cowrote several children’s books.",

                "content": "Hanukkah[a] (/ˈhænəkə/, /ˈhɑːnəkə/; חֲנֻכָּה‎ Ḥănukkā listenⓘ) is a Jewish festival commemorating the recovery of Jerusalem and subsequent rededication of the Second Temple at the beginning of the Maccabean Revolt against the Seleucid Empire in the 2nd century BCE.[3][4] Hanukkah is observed for eight nights and days,[5] starting on the 25th day of Kislev according to the Hebrew calendar, which may occur at any time from November 28 to December 27 in the Gregorian calendar. The festival is observed by lighting the candles of a candelabrum with nine branches, commonly called a menorah or hanukkiah. One branch is typically placed above or below the others and its candle is used to light the other eight candles. This unique candle is called the shammash (שַׁמָּשׁ‎, \"attendant\"). Each night, one additional candle is lit by the shammash until all eight candles are lit together on the final night of the festival.[6] Other Hanukkah festivities include singing Hanukkah songs, playing the game of dreidel and eating oil-based foods, such as latkes and sufganiyot (similar to jelly donuts), and dairy foods. Since the 1970s, the worldwide Chabad Hasidic movement has initiated public menorah lightings in open public places in many countries.[7] Originally instituted as a feast \"in the manner of Sukkot (Booths)\", it does not come with the corresponding obligations, and is therefore a relatively minor holiday in strictly religious terms. Nevertheless, Hanukkah has attained major cultural significance in North America and elsewhere, especially among secular Jews, due to often occurring around the same time as Christmas during the festive season.[8] The name \"Hanukkah\" derives from the Hebrew verb \"חנך‎\", meaning \"to dedicate\". On Hanukkah, the Maccabean Jews regained control of Jerusalem and rededicated the Temple.[9][10] Many homiletical explanations have been given for the name:[11] In Hebrew, the word Hanukkah is written חֲנֻכָּה‎ or חֲנוּכָּה‎ (Ḥănukā). It is most commonly transliterated to English as Hanukkah or Chanukah. The spelling Hanukkah, which is based on using characters of the English alphabet as symbols to re-create the word's correct spelling in Hebrew,[14] is the most common[15] and the preferred choice of Merriam–Webster,[16] Collins English Dictionary, the Oxford Style Manual, and the style guides of The New York Times and The Guardian.[17] The sound represented by Ch ([χ], similar to the Scottish pronunciation of loch) is not native to the English language.[18] Furthermore, the letter ḥeth (ח‎), which is the first letter in the Hebrew spelling, is pronounced differently in modern Hebrew (voiceless uvular fricative) from in classical Hebrew (voiceless pharyngeal fricative [ħ]), and neither of those sounds is unambiguously representable in English spelling. However, its original sound is closer to the English H than to the Scottish Ch, and Hanukkah more accurately represents the spelling in the Hebrew alphabet.[14] Moreover, the 'kaf' consonant is geminate in classical (but not modern) Hebrew. Adapting the classical Hebrew pronunciation with the geminate and pharyngeal Ḥeth can lead to the spelling Hanukkah, while adapting the modern Hebrew pronunciation with no gemination and uvular Ḥeth leads to the spelling Chanukah.[19][20][21] In Modern Hebrew, Hanukkah may also be called the Festival of Lights (חַג הַאוּרִים‎, Ḥag HaUrim), based on a comment by Josephus in Antiquities of the Jews, καὶ ἐξ ἐκείνου μέχρι τοῦ δεῦρο τὴν ἑορτὴν ἄγομεν καλοῦντες αὐτὴν φῶτα \"And from then on we celebrate this festival, and we call it Lights\". The first Hebrew translation of Antiquities (1864) used (חַג הַמְּאֹרוֹת‎) \"Festival of Lamps\", but the translation \"Festival of Lights\" (חַג הַאוּרִים‎) appeared by the end of the nineteenth century.[22] The story of Hanukkah is told in the books of the First and Second Maccabees, which describe in detail the rededication of the Temple in Jerusalem and the lighting of the menorah. These books, however, are not a part of the canonized Masoretic Text version of the Tanakh (Hebrew and Aramaic language Jewish Bible) used and accepted by normative Rabbinical Judaism and therefore modern Jews (as copied, edited and distributed by a group of Jews known as the Masoretes between the 7th and 10th centuries of the Common Era). However, the books of Maccabees were included among the deuterocanonical books added to the Septuagint, a Jewish scholarly Greek-language translation of the Hebrew Bible originally compiled in the mid-3rd century BCE. The Roman Catholic and Orthodox Churches consider the books of Maccabees as a canonical part of the Old Testament.[23] The eight-day rededication of the temple is described in 1 Maccabees,[24] though the miracle of the oil does not appear here. A story similar in character, and older in date, is the one alluded to in 2 Maccabees[25] according to which the relighting of the altar fire by Nehemiah was due to a miracle which occurred on the 25th of Kislev, and which appears to be given as the reason for the selection of the same date for the rededication of the altar by Judah Maccabee.[26] The above account in 1 Maccabees, as well as 2 Maccabees[27] portrays the feast as a delayed observation of the eight-day Feast of Booths (Sukkot); similarly 2 Maccabees explains the length of the feast as \"in the manner of the Feast of Booths\".[28] Megillat Taanit (1st century) contains a list of festive days on which fasting or eulogizing is forbidden. It specifies, \"On the 25th of [Kislev] is Hanukkah of eight days, and one is not to eulogize\" and then references the story of the rededication of the Temple.[29] The Mishna (late 2nd century) mentions Hanukkah in several places,[30] but never describes its laws in detail and never mentions any aspect of the history behind it. To explain the Mishna's lack of a systematic discussion of Hanukkah, Nissim ben Jacob postulated that information on the holiday was so commonplace that the Mishna felt no need to explain it.[31] Modern scholar Reuvein Margolies suggests that as the Mishnah was redacted after the Bar Kochba revolt, its editors were reluctant to include explicit discussion of a holiday celebrating another relatively recent revolt against a foreign ruler, for fear of antagonizing the Romans.[32] The miracle of the one-day supply of oil miraculously lasting eight days is described in the Talmud, committed to writing about 600 years after the events described in the books of Maccabees.[33] The Talmud says that after the forces of Antiochus IV had been driven from the Temple, the Maccabees discovered that almost all of the ritual olive oil had been profaned. They found only a single container that was still sealed by the High Priest, with enough oil to keep the menorah in the Temple lit for a single day. They used this, yet it burned for eight days (the time it took to have new oil pressed and made ready).[34] The Talmud presents three options:[35] Except in times of danger, the lights were to be placed outside one's door, on the opposite side of the mezuza, or in the window closest to the street. Rashi, in a note to Shabbat 21b, says their purpose is to publicize the miracle. The blessings for Hanukkah lights are discussed in tractate Succah, p. 46a.[36] Megillat Antiochus (probably composed in the 2nd century[37]) concludes with the following words: ...After this, the sons of Israel went up to the Temple and rebuilt its gates and purified the Temple from the dead bodies and from the defilement. And they sought after pure olive oil to light the lamps therewith, but could not find any, except one bowl that was sealed with the signet ring of the High Priest from the days of Samuel the prophet and they knew that it was pure. There was in it [enough oil] to light [the lamps therewith] for one day, but the God of heaven whose name dwells there put therein his blessing and they were able to light from it eight days. Therefore, the sons of Ḥashmonai made this covenant and took upon themselves a solemn vow, they and the sons of Israel, all of them, to publish amongst the sons of Israel, [to the end] that they might observe these eight days of joy and honour, as the days of the feasts written in [the book of] the Law; [even] to light in them so as to make known to those who come after them that their God wrought for them salvation from heaven. In them, it is not permitted to mourn, neither to decree a fast [on those days], and anyone who has a vow to perform, let him perform it.[38] The Al HaNissim prayer is recited on Hanukkah as an addition to the Amidah prayer, which was formalized in the late 1st century.[39] Al HaNissim describes the history of the holiday as follows: The Jewish historian Titus Flavius Josephus narrates in his book, Jewish Antiquities XII, how the victorious Judas Maccabeus ordered lavish yearly eight-day festivities after rededicating the Temple in Jerusalem that had been profaned by Antiochus IV Epiphanes.[40] Josephus does not say the festival was called Hanukkah but rather the \"Festival of Lights\": In the New Testament, John 10:22–23 says, \"Then came the Festival of Dedication at Jerusalem. It was winter, and Jesus was in the temple courts walking in Solomon's Colonnade\" (NIV). The Greek noun used appears in the neuter plural as \"the renewals\" or \"the consecrations\" (Ancient Greek: τὰ ἐγκαίνια; ta enkaínia).[42] The same root appears in 2 Esdras 6:16 in the Septuagint to refer specifically to Hanukkah. This Greek word was chosen because the Hebrew word for 'consecration' or 'dedication' is Hanukkah (חנכה). The Aramaic New Testament uses the Aramaic word hawdata (a close synonym), which literally means 'renewal' or 'to make new'.[43] After the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BCE, Judea became part of the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt until 200 BCE, when King Antiochus III the Great of Syria defeated King Ptolemy V Epiphanes of Egypt at the Battle of Panium. Judea then became part of the Seleucid Empire of Syria.[44] King Antiochus III the Great, wanting to conciliate his new Jewish subjects, guaranteed their right to \"live according to their ancestral customs\" and to continue to practice their religion in the Temple of Jerusalem.[45] The Seleucids, like the Ptolemies before them, held a suzerainty over Judea, where they respected Jewish culture and protected Jewish institutions. This policy was drastically reversed by Antiochus IV Epiphanes, the son of Antiochus III, seemingly after what was either a dispute over leadership of the Temple in Jerusalem and the office of High Priest, or possibly a revolt whose nature was lost to time after being crushed.[46] In 175 BCE, Antiochus IV invaded Judea at the request of the sons of Tobias.[47] The Tobiads, who led the Hellenizing Jewish faction in Jerusalem, were expelled to Syria around 170 BCE when the high priest Onias and his pro-Egyptian faction wrested control from them. The exiled Tobiads lobbied Antiochus IV Epiphanes to recapture Jerusalem. As Flavius Josephus relates: The king being thereto disposed beforehand, complied with them, and came upon the Jews with a great army, and took their city by force, and slew a great multitude of those that favored Ptolemy, and sent out his soldiers to plunder them without mercy. He also spoiled the temple, and put a stop to the constant practice of offering a daily sacrifice of expiation for three years and six months. When the Second Temple in Jerusalem was looted and services stopped, Judaism was outlawed. In 167 BCE, Antiochus ordered an altar to Zeus erected in the Temple. He banned brit milah (circumcision) and ordered pigs to be sacrificed at the altar of the temple.[49] Antiochus's actions provoked a large-scale revolt. Mattathias (Mattityahu), a Jewish priest, and his five sons Jochanan, Simeon, Eleazar, Jonathan, and Judah led a rebellion against Antiochus. It started with Mattathias killing first a Jew who wanted to comply with Antiochus's order to sacrifice to Zeus, and then a Greek official who was to enforce the government's behest (1 Mac. 2, 24–25[50]). Judah became known as Yehuda HaMakabi (\"Judah the Hammer\"). By 166 BCE, Mattathias had died, and Judah took his place as leader. By 164 BCE, the Jewish revolt against the Seleucid monarchy was successful. The Temple was liberated and rededicated. The festival of Hanukkah was instituted to celebrate this event.[51] Judah ordered the Temple to be cleansed, a new altar to be built in place of the polluted one and new holy vessels to be made.[26] According to the Talmud, \"For when the Greeks entered the Sanctuary, they defiled all the oils therein, and when the Hasmonean dynasty prevailed against and defeated them, they made search and found only one cruse of oil which lay with the seal of the kohen gadol (high priest), but which contained sufficient [oil] for one day's lighting only; yet a miracle was wrought therein, and they lit [the lamp] therewith for eight days. The following year these [days] were appointed a Festival with [the recital of] Hallel and thanksgiving.\" —Shabbat 21b Tertiary sources in the Jewish tradition make reference to this account.[52] Maimonides (12th century) described Hanukkah as follows: When, on the twenty-fifth of Kislev, the Jews had emerged victorious over their foes and destroyed them, they re-entered the Temple where they found only one jar of pure oil, enough to be lit for only a single day; yet they used it for lighting the required set of lamps for eight days, until they managed to press olives and produce pure oil. Because of this, the sages of that generation ruled that the eight days beginning with the twenty-fifth of Kislev should be observed as days of rejoicing and praising the Lord. Lamps are lit in the evening over the doors of the homes, on each of the eight nights, so as to display the miracle. These days are called Hanukkah, when it is forbidden to lament or to fast, just as it is on the days of Purim. Lighting the lamps during the eight days of Hanukkah is a religious duty imposed by the sages.[53] Some modern scholars, following the account in 2 Maccabees, observe that the king was intervening in an internal civil war between the Maccabean Jews and the Hellenized Jews in Jerusalem.[54][55][56][57] These competed violently over who would be the High Priest, with traditionalists with Hebrew/Aramaic names like Onias contesting with Hellenizing High Priests with Greek names like Jason and Menelaus.[58] In particular, Jason's Hellenistic reforms would prove to be a decisive factor leading to eventual conflict within the ranks of Judaism.[59] Other authors point to possible socioeconomic reasons in addition to the religious reasons behind the civil war.[60] What began in many respects as a civil war escalated when the Hellenistic kingdom of Syria sided with the Hellenizing Jews in their conflict with the traditionalists.[61] As the conflict escalated, Antiochus took the side of the Hellenizers by prohibiting the religious practices the traditionalists had rallied around. This may explain why the king, in a total departure from Seleucid practice in all other places and times, banned a traditional religion.[62] The miracle of the oil is widely regarded as a legend and its authenticity has been questioned since the Middle Ages.[63] However, given the famous question Joseph Karo (1488–1575) posed concerning why Hanukkah is celebrated for eight days when the miracle was only for seven days (since there was enough oil for one day),[64] it was clear that writing in the 16th century CE, he believed it to be a historical event. This belief has been adopted by most of Orthodox Judaism, in as much as Karo's Shulchan Aruch is a main code of Jewish Law. Selected battles between the Maccabees and the Seleucid Syrian-Greeks: Hanukkah is celebrated with a series of rituals that are performed every day throughout the eight-day holiday, some are family-based and others communal. There are special additions to the daily prayer service, and a section is added to the blessing after meals.[79] Hanukkah is not a \"Sabbath-like\" holiday, and there is no obligation to refrain from activities that are forbidden on the Sabbath, as specified in the Shulkhan Arukh.[80][81] Adherents go to work as usual but may leave early in order to be home to kindle the lights at nightfall. There is no religious reason for schools to be closed, although in Israel schools close from the second day for the whole week of Hanukkah.[82][83] Many families exchange gifts each night, such as books or games, and \"Hanukkah Gelt\" is often given to children. Fried foods—such as latkes (potato pancakes), jelly doughnuts (sufganiyot) and Sephardic bimuelos—are eaten to commemorate the importance of oil during the celebration of Hanukkah. Some also have a custom of eating dairy products to remember Judith and how she overcame Holofernes by feeding him cheese, which made him thirsty, and giving him wine to drink. When Holofernes became very drunk, Judith cut off his head.[84] Each night throughout the eight-day holiday, a candle or oil-based light is lit. As a universally practiced \"beautification\" (hiddur mitzvah) of the mitzvah, the number of lights lit is increased by one each night.[85] An extra light called a shammash, meaning \"attendant\" or \"sexton\",[86] is also lit each night, and is given a distinct location, usually higher, lower, or to the side of the others.[81] Among Ashkenazim the tendency is for every male member of the household (and in many families, girls as well) to light a full set of lights each night,[87][88] while among Sephardim the prevalent custom is to have one set of lights for the entire household.[89] The purpose of the shammash is to adhere to the prohibition, specified in the Talmud,[90] against using the Hanukkah lights for anything other than publicizing and meditating on the Hanukkah miracle. This differs from Sabbath candles which are meant to be used for illumination and lighting. Hence, if one were to need extra illumination on Hanukkah, the shammash candle would be available, and one would avoid using the prohibited lights. Some, especially Ashkenazim, light the shammash candle first and then use it to light the others.[91] So altogether, including the shammash, two lights are lit on the first night, three on the second and so on, ending with nine on the last night, for a total of 44 (36, excluding the shammash). It is Sephardic custom not to light the shammash first and use it to light the rest. Instead, the shammash candle is the last to be lit, and a different candle or a match is used to light all the candles. Some Hasidic Jews follow this Sephardic custom as well.[92] The lights can be candles or oil lamps.[91] Electric lights are sometimes used and are acceptable in places where open flame is not permitted, such as a hospital room, or for the very elderly and infirm; however, those who permit reciting a blessing over electric lamps only allow it if it is incandescent and battery operated (an incandescent flashlight would be acceptable for this purpose), while a blessing may not be recited over a plug-in menorah or lamp. Most Jewish homes have a special candelabrum referred to as either a Hanukkah menorah (the traditional name, menorah being Hebrew for 'lamp') or a Chanukiah (the modern Israeli term). Some families use an oil lamp menorah (traditionally filled with olive oil) for Hanukkah; like the candle version, it has eight wicks to light plus the additional shammash light.[93] In the United States, Hanukkah became a more visible festival in the public sphere from the 1970s when Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson called for public awareness and observance of the festival and encouraged the lighting of public menorahs.[94][95][96][97] The reason for the Hanukkah lights is not for the \"lighting of the house within\", but rather for the \"illumination of the house without\", so that passersby should see it and be reminded of the holiday's miracle (i.e. that the sole cruse of pure oil found which held enough oil to burn for one night actually burned for eight nights). Accordingly, lamps are set up at a prominent window or near the door leading to the street. It is customary amongst some Ashkenazi Jews to have a separate menorah for each family member (customs vary), whereas most Sephardi Jews light one for the whole household. Only when there was danger of antisemitic persecution were lamps supposed to be hidden from public view, as was the case in Persia under the rule of the Zoroastrians,[26] or in parts of Europe before and during World War II. However, most Hasidic groups light lamps near an inside doorway, not necessarily in public view. According to this tradition, the lamps are placed on the opposite side from the mezuzah, so people passing through the door are surrounded by the holiness of mitzvot (the commandments).[98] Generally, women are exempt in Jewish law from time-bound positive commandments, although the Talmud requires that women engage in the mitzvah of lighting Hanukkah candles \"for they too were involved in the miracle.\"[99][100] Some Jews in North America and Israel have taken up environmental concerns in relation to Hanukkah's \"miracle of the oil\", emphasizing reflection on energy conservation and energy independence. An example of this is the Coalition on the Environment and Jewish Life's renewable energy campaign.[101][102][103] Hanukkah lights should usually burn for at least half an hour after it gets dark.[104] Many light at sundown, while most Hasidim and many other communities light later, generally around nightfall.[105] Many Hasidic Rebbes light much later to fulfill the obligation of publicizing the miracle by the presence of their Hasidim when they kindle the lights.[106] Inexpensive small wax candles sold for Hanukkah burn for approximately half an hour so should be lit no earlier than nightfall.[104] Friday night presents a problem, however. Since candles may not be lit on Shabbat itself, the candles must be lit before sunset.[104] However, they must remain lit through the lighting of the Shabbat candles. Therefore, the Hanukkah menorah is lit first with larger candles than usual,[104] followed by the Shabbat candles. At the end of the Shabbat, there are those who light the Hanukkah lights before Havdalah and those who make Havdalah before the lighting Hanukkah lights.[107] If for whatever reason one didn't light at sunset or nightfall, the lights should be kindled later, as long as there are people in the streets.[104] Later than that, the lights should still be kindled, but the blessings should be recited only if there is at least somebody else awake in the house and present at the lighting of the Hannukah lights.[108] Typically two blessings (brachot; singular: brachah) are recited during this eight-day festival when lighting the candles. On the first night only, the shehecheyanu blessing is added, making a total of three blessings.[109] The first blessing is recited before the candles are lit, and while most recite the other blessing(s) beforehand as well, some have the custom to recite them after. On the first night of Hanukkah one light (candle or oil) is lit on the right side of the menorah, on the following night a second light is placed to the left of the first but it is lit first, and so on, proceeding from placing candles right to left but lighting them from left to right over the eight nights.[110] Transliteration: Barukh ata Adonai Eloheinu, melekh ha'olam, asher kid'shanu b'mitzvotav v'tzivanu l'hadlik ner Hanukkah. Translation: \"Blessed are You, LORD our God, King of the universe, Who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to kindle the Hanukkah light[s].\" Transliteration: Barukh ata Adonai Eloheinu, melekh ha'olam, she'asa nisim la'avoteinu ba'yamim ha'heim ba'z'man ha'ze. Translation: \"Blessed are You, LORD our God, King of the universe, Who performed miracles for our ancestors in those days at this time...\" After the lights are kindled the hymn Hanerot Halalu is recited. There are several different versions; the version presented here is recited in many Ashkenazic communities:[112] In the Ashkenazi tradition, each night after the lighting of the candles, the hymn Ma'oz Tzur is sung. The song contains six stanzas. The first and last deal with general themes of divine salvation, and the middle four deal with events of persecution in Jewish history, praising God for survival despite these tragedies (the exodus from Egypt, the Babylonian captivity, the miracle of the holiday of Purim, the Hasmonean victory) and expressing a longing for the days when Judea will finally triumph over Rome.[113] The song was composed in the thirteenth century by a poet only known through the acrostic found in the first letters of the original five stanzas of the song: Mordechai. The familiar tune is most probably a derivation of a German Protestant church hymn or a popular folk song.[114] After lighting the candles and Ma'oz Tzur, singing other Hanukkah songs is customary in many Jewish homes. Some Hasidic and Sephardi Jews recite Psalms, such as Psalm 30, Psalm 67, and Psalm 91. In North America and in Israel it is common to exchange presents or give children presents at this time. In addition, many families encourage their children to give tzedakah (charity) in lieu of presents for themselves.[115][116] \"We thank You also for the miraculous deeds and for the redemption and for the mighty deeds and the saving acts wrought by You, as well as for the wars which You waged for our ancestors in ancient days at this season. In the days of the Hasmonean Mattathias, son of Johanan the high priest, and his sons, when the iniquitous Greco-Syrian kingdom rose up against Your people Israel, to make them forget Your Torah and to turn them away from the ordinances of Your will, then You in your abundant mercy rose up for them in the time of their trouble, pled their cause, executed judgment, avenged their wrong, and delivered the strong into the hands of the weak, the many into the hands of few, the impure into the hands of the pure, the wicked into the hands of the righteous, and insolent ones into the hands of those occupied with Your Torah. Both unto Yourself did you make a great and holy name in Thy world, and unto Your people did You achieve a great deliverance and redemption. Whereupon your children entered the sanctuary of Your house, cleansed Your temple, purified Your sanctuary, kindled lights in Your holy courts, and appointed these eight days of Hanukkah in order to give thanks and praises unto Your holy name.\" An addition is made to the \"hoda'ah\" (thanksgiving) benediction in the Amidah (thrice-daily prayers), called Al HaNissim (\"On/about the Miracles\").[118] This addition refers to the victory achieved over the Syrians by the Hasmonean Mattathias and his sons.[119][120][26] The same prayer is added to the grace after meals. In addition, the Hallel (praise) Psalms[121] are sung during each morning service and the Tachanun penitential prayers are omitted.[119][122] The Torah is read every day in the shacharit morning services in synagogue, on the first day beginning from Numbers 6:22 (according to some customs, Numbers 7:1), and the last day ending with Numbers 8:4. Since Hanukkah lasts eight days it includes at least one, and sometimes two, Jewish Sabbaths (Saturdays). The weekly Torah portion for the first Sabbath is almost always Miketz, telling of Joseph's dream and his enslavement in Egypt. The Haftarah reading for the first Sabbath Hanukkah is Zechariah 2:14 – Zechariah 4:7. When there is a second Sabbath on Hanukkah, the Haftarah reading is from 1 Kings 7:40–50. The Hanukkah menorah is also kindled daily in the synagogue, at night with the blessings and in the morning without the blessings.[123] The menorah is not lit during Shabbat, but rather prior to the beginning of Shabbat as described above and not at all during the day. During the Middle Ages \"Megillat Antiochus\" was read in the Italian synagogues on Hanukkah just as the Book of Esther is read on Purim. It still forms part of the liturgy of the Yemenite Jews.[124] The last day of Hanukkah is known by some as Zot Hanukkah and by others as Chanukat HaMizbeach, from the verse read on this day in the synagogue Numbers 7:84, Zot Hanukkat Hamizbe'ach: \"This was the dedication of the altar\". According to the teachings of Kabbalah and Hasidism, this day is the final \"seal\" of the High Holiday season of Yom Kippur and is considered a time to repent out of love for God. In this spirit, many Hasidic Jews wish each other Gmar chatimah tovah (\"may you be sealed totally for good\"), a traditional greeting for the Yom Kippur season. It is taught in Hasidic and Kabbalistic literature that this day is particularly auspicious for the fulfillment of prayers.[125] It is customary for women not to work for at least the first half-hour of the candles' burning, and some have the custom not to work for the entire time of burning. It is also forbidden to fast or to eulogize during Hanukkah.[81] Some Hasidic scholars teach that the Hanukkah is in fact the final conclusion of God's judgment extending High Holy Days of Rosh Hashana when humanity is judged and Yom Kippur when the judgment is sealed: Hanukkah songs (in Hebrew except where indicated) include \"Ma'oz Tzur\" (Rock of Ages), \"Latke'le Latke'le\" (Yiddish: \"Little Latke, Little Latke\"), \"Hanukkiah Li Yesh\" (\"I Have a Hanukkah Menorah\"), \"Ocho Kandelikas\" (Judeo-Spanish: \"Eight Little Candles\"), \"Kad Katan\" (\"A Small Jug\"), \"S'vivon Sov Sov Sov\" (\"Dreidel, Spin and Spin\"), \"Haneirot Halolu\" (\"These Candles Which We Light\"), \"Mi Yimalel\" (\"Who Can Retell\") and \"Ner Li, Ner Li\" (\"I have a Candle\"). Among the best known songs in English-speaking countries are \"Dreidel, Dreidel, Dreidel\"[127] and \"Oh Chanukah\".[128] In the Nadvorna Hasidic dynasty, it is customary for the rebbes to play violin after the menorah is lit.[129] Penina Moise's Hannukah Hymn published in the 1842 Hymns Written for the Use of Hebrew Congregations was instrumental in the beginning of Americanization of Hanukkah.[130][131][132] There is a custom of eating foods fried or baked in oil (preferably olive oil) to commemorate the miracle of a small flask of oil keeping the Second Temple's Menorah alight for eight days.[133] Traditional foods include potato pancakes, known as latkes in Yiddish, especially among Ashkenazi families. Sephardi, Polish, and Israeli families eat jam-filled doughnuts (Yiddish: פּאָנטשקעס pontshkes), bimuelos (fritters) and sufganiyot which are deep-fried in oil. Italkim and Hungarian Jews traditionally eat cheese pancakes known as \"cassola\" or \"cheese latkes\".[134] Latkes are not popular in Israel, having been largely replaced by sufganiyot due to local economic factors, convenience and the influence of trade unions.[135] Bakeries in Israel have popularized many new types of fillings for sufganiyot besides the traditional strawberry jelly filling, including chocolate cream, vanilla cream, caramel, cappuccino and others.[136] In recent years, downsized, \"mini\" sufganiyot containing half the calories of the regular, 400-to-600-calorie version, have become popular.[137] Rabbinic literature also records a tradition of eating cheese and other dairy products during Hanukkah.[138] This custom, as mentioned above, commemorates the heroism of Judith during the Babylonian captivity of the Jews and reminds us that women also played an important role in the events of Hanukkah.[139] The deuterocanonical book of Judith (Yehudit or Yehudis in Hebrew), which is not part of the Tanakh, records that Holofernes, an Assyrian general, had surrounded the village of Bethulia as part of his campaign to conquer Judea. After intense fighting, the water supply of the Jews was cut off and the situation became desperate. Judith, a pious widow, told the city leaders that she had a plan to save the city. Judith went to the Assyrian camps and pretended to surrender. She met Holofernes, who was smitten by her beauty. She went back to his tent with him, where she plied him with cheese and wine. When he fell into a drunken sleep, Judith beheaded him and escaped from the camp, taking the severed head with her (the beheading of Holofernes by Judith has historically been a popular theme in art). When Holofernes' soldiers found his corpse, they were overcome with fear; the Jews, on the other hand, were emboldened and launched a successful counterattack. The town was saved, and the Assyrians defeated.[140] Roast goose has historically been a traditional Hanukkah food among Eastern European and American Jews, although the custom has declined in recent decades.[141] Indian Jews traditionally consume gulab jamun, fried dough balls soaked in a sweet syrup, similar to teiglach or bimuelos, as part of their Hanukkah celebrations. Italian Jews eat fried chicken, cassola (a ricotta cheese latke almost similar to a cheesecake), and fritelle de riso par Hanukkah (a fried sweet rice pancake). Romanian Jews eat pasta latkes as a traditional Hanukkah dish, and Syrian Jews consume Kibbet Yatkeen, a dish made with pumpkin and bulgur wheat similar to latkes, as well as their own version of keftes de prasa spiced with allspice and cinnamon.[142] After lighting the candles, it is customary to play (or spin) the dreidel. The dreidel, or sevivon in Hebrew, is a four-sided spinning top that children play with during Hanukkah. Each side is imprinted with a Hebrew letter which is an abbreviation for the Hebrew words נס גדול היה שם (Nes Gadol Haya Sham, \"A great miracle happened there\"), referring to the miracle of the oil that took place in the Beit Hamikdash. The fourth side of some dreidels sold in Israel are inscribed with the letter פ (Pe), rendering the acronym נס גדול היה פה (Nes Gadol Haya Po, \"A great miracle happened here\"), referring to the fact that the miracle occurred in the land of Israel, although this is a relatively recent[when?] innovation. Stores in Haredi neighborhoods sell the traditional Shin dreidels as well, because they understand \"there\" to refer to the Temple and not the entire Land of Israel, and because the Hasidic Masters ascribe significance to the traditional letters.[143][144] Chanukkah gelt (Yiddish for \"Chanukkah money\"), known in Israel by the Hebrew translation Hebrew: דְּמֵי חֲנֻכָּה, romanized: dmei Hanukkah, is often distributed to children during the festival of Hanukkah. The giving of Hanukkah gelt also adds to the holiday excitement. The amount is usually in small coins, although grandparents or relatives may give larger sums. The tradition of giving Chanukah gelt dates back to a long-standing East European custom of children presenting their teachers with a small sum of money at this time of year as a token of gratitude. One minhag favors the fifth night of Hanukkah for giving Hanukkah gelt.[145] Unlike the other nights of Hanukkah, the fifth does not ever fall on the Shabbat, hence never conflicting with the Halachic injunction against handling money on the Shabbat.[146] The earliest Hanukkah link with the White House occurred in 1951 when Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion presented United States President Harry Truman with a Hanukkah menorah. In 1979 President Jimmy Carter took part in the first public Hanukkah candle-lighting ceremony of the National Menorah held across the White House lawn. In 1989, President George H. W. Bush displayed a menorah in the White House. In 1993, President Bill Clinton invited a group of schoolchildren to the Oval Office for a small ceremony.[95] The United States Postal Service has released several Hanukkah-themed postage stamps. In 1996, the United States Postal Service (USPS) issued a 32 cent Hanukkah stamp as a joint issue with Israel.[147] In 2004, after eight years of reissuing the menorah design, the USPS issued a dreidel design for the Hanukkah stamp. The dreidel design was used through 2008. In 2009 a Hanukkah stamp was issued with a design featured a photograph of a menorah with nine lit candles.[148] In 2008, President George W. Bush held an official Hanukkah reception in the White House where he linked the occasion to the 1951 gift by using that menorah for the ceremony, with a grandson of Ben-Gurion and a grandson of Truman lighting the candles.[149] In December 2014, two Hanukkah celebrations were held at the White House. The White House commissioned a menorah made by students at the Max Rayne school in Israel and invited two of its students to join U.S. President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama as they welcomed over 500 guests to the celebration. The students' school in Israel had been subjected to arson by extremists. President Obama said these \"students teach us an important lesson for this time in our history. The light of hope must outlast the fires of hate. That's what the Hanukkah story teaches us. It's what our young people can teach us – that one act of faith can make a miracle, that love is stronger than hate, that peace can triumph over conflict.\"[150] Rabbi Angela Warnick Buchdahl, in leading prayers at the ceremony commented on the how special the scene was, asking the President if he believed America's founding fathers could possibly have pictured that a female Asian-American rabbi would one day be at the White House leading Jewish prayers in front of the African-American president.[151] The dates of Hanukkah are determined by the Hebrew calendar. Hanukkah begins at the 25th day of Kislev and concludes on the second or third day of Tevet (Kislev can have 29 or 30 days). The Jewish day begins at sunset. Hanukkah dates for recent and upcoming: In 2013, on 28 November, the American holiday of Thanksgiving fell during Hanukkah for only the third time since Thanksgiving was declared a national holiday by President Abraham Lincoln. The last time was 1899, and due to the nature of the Gregorian and Jewish calendars being slightly out of sync with each other, it will not happen again in the foreseeable future.[152] This rare convergence prompted the creation of the neologism Thanksgivukkah.[153][154][155] Major Jewish holidays are those when all forms of work are forbidden, and that feature traditional holiday meals, kiddush, holiday candle-lighting, etc. Only biblical holidays fit these criteria, and Chanukah was instituted some two centuries after the Hebrew Bible was completed. Nevertheless, though Chanukah is of rabbinic origin, it is traditionally celebrated in a major and very public fashion. The requirement to position the menorah, or Chanukiah, at the door or window, symbolizes the desire to give the Chanukah miracle a high-profile.[156] Moreover, Hallel (a set of Psalms expressing praise that is recited on significant Jewish holidays) is recited on all eight days of Hanukkah, which signifies Hanukkah's importance on the Jewish calendar. While not considered the most significant holiday, the recitation of Hallel on Hanukkah highlights its importance in Jewish tradition.[157] Some Jewish historians suggest a different explanation for the rabbinic reluctance to laud the militarism.[clarification needed] First, the rabbis wrote after Hasmonean leaders had led Judea into Rome's grip and so may not have wanted to offer the family much praise. Second, they clearly wanted to promote a sense of dependence on God, urging Jews to look toward the divine for protection. They likely feared inciting Jews to another revolt that might end in disaster, as the Bar Kochba revolt did.[158] \"Hanukkah is an ancient holiday, but a modest one. The holiday of the Hasmoneans is new, yet it is full of spiritual exaltation and national joy. What was Hanukkah forty years ago? 'Al ha-nissim' and Hallel; a short reading in the synagogue; lighting the tiny, slender wax candles or oil lights; at home, levivot [latkes-potato pancakes], cards for the older children, and sevivonim [dreidels-spinning tops] for the little ones. But what is Hanukkah today? The holiday of the Hasmoneans. A holiday of salvation. A great national holiday, celebrated in all the countries of the Diaspora with dances and speeches, melody and song, outings and parades, as if a new soul has been breathed into the ancient holiday, another spirit renewed within it. One thing is clear: if those tiny, modest candles had been extinguished in Diaspora times, if our grandparents had not preserved the traditions of Hanukkah in the synagogue and at home . .., the holiday of the Hasmoneans could never have been created. There would have been nothing to change, nothing to renew. The new soul of our times would not have found a body in which to envelop itself.\" The emergence of Jewish nationalism and the Zionist movement in the late 19th and early 20th centuries had a profound impact on the celebration and reinterpretation of Jewish holidays. These developments resulted in increased emphasis on certain Jewish celebrations, of which Hanukkah and Tu BiShvat are prominent examples.[161] Hanukkah took on renewed meaning following the rise of Jewish nationalism as a nationalist holiday, symbolizing the struggle of the Jewish people against foreign oppression and their desire for national re-creation [162] (although the struggle of Jews against foreign oppression has always been a core componant of Hanukkah, as shown by the Al HaNissim, which has been part of Jewish liturgy since at least 700 CE).[163] Hanukkah served as a common ground where both religious and secular Zionists could unite around their nationalist agenda. Rabbi Shmuel Mohilever, an early religious Zionist, proposed making Hanukkah the official holiday of the proto-Zionist organization Hovevei Zion in Russia in 1881. Public celebrations of Hanukkah gained prominence in the early 20th century, with parades and public events becoming common. Schools in Mandate Palestine played an early role in promoting these celebrations.[164] With the advent of Zionism and the state of Israel, the themes of militarism were reconsidered. In modern Israel, the national and military aspects of Hanukkah became, once again, more dominant.[165][166] In North America, Hanukkah in the 21st century has taken a place equal to Passover as a symbol of Jewish identity. Both the Israeli and North American versions of Hanukkah emphasize resistance, focusing on some combination of national liberation and religious freedom as the defining meaning of the holiday.[167][8] Diane Ashton attributed the increased visibility and reinvention of Hanukkah by some of the American Jewish community as a way to adapt to American life, re-inventing the festival in \"the language of individualism and personal conscience derived from both Protestantism and the Enlightenment\".[130] In the Catholic Church, Christmastide has its own Octave, being eight days especially set aside to celebrate Christmas from 25 December to 1 January. This is seen as a Christian fulfillment of the original text's demand for Hanukkah to be eight days, \"And they kept the eight days with gladness, as in the feast of the tabernacles, remembering that not long afore they had held the feast of the tabernacles\" (2 Macc 10:6). Advent is considered as the season of darkness preceding the season of light, Christmas, so for this reason, Christmas can be said to be the \"New Hanukkah\", or its fulfillment through the Nativity of Christ. This is similar to the Easter Octave being the solemn eight days of the Passover of Exodus.[citation needed] In North America, Hanukkah became increasingly important to many Jewish individuals and families during the latter part of the 20th century, including a large number of secular Jews, who wanted to celebrate a Jewish alternative to the Christmas celebrations which frequently overlap with Hanukkah.[168][169] Diane Ashton argues that Jewish immigrants to America raised the profile of Hanukkah as a kid-centered alternative to Christmas as early as the 1800s.[170] This in parts mirrors the ascendancy of Christmas, which like Hanukkah increased in importance in the 1800s.[171] During this time period, Jewish leaders (especially Reform) such as Max Lilienthal and Isaac Mayer Wise made an effort to rebrand Hanukkah and started creating Hanukkah celebration for kids at their synagogues, which included candy and singing songs.[170][172] By the 1900s, it started to become a commercial holiday like Christmas, with Hanukkah gifts and decorations appearing in stores and Jewish Women's magazines printing articles on holiday decorations, children's celebrations, and gift giving.[170] Ashton says that Jewish families did this in order to maintain a Jewish identity which is distinct from mainline Christian culture, on the other hand, the mirroring of Hanukkah and Christmas made Jewish families and kids feel that they were American.[170] Though it was traditional for Ashkenazi Jews to give \"gelt\" or money to children during Hanukkah, in many families, this tradition has been supplemented with the giving of other gifts so that Jewish children can enjoy receiving gifts just like their Christmas-celebrating peers do.[173] Children play a big role in Hanukkah, and Jewish families with children are more likely to celebrate it than childless Jewish families, and sociologists hypothesize that this is because Jewish parents do not want their kids to be alienated from their non-Jewish peers who celebrate Christmas.[168] Recent celebrations have also seen the presence of the Hanukkah bush, which is considered a Jewish counterpart to the Christmas tree. Today, the presence of Hanukkah bushes is generally discouraged by most rabbis.[174] In December 2022, New York City Mayor Eric Adams, Reverends Al Sharpton and Conrad Tillard, businessman Robert F. Smith, Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, and Elisha Wiesel joined to celebrate Hanukkah and Kwanzaa together, and combat racism and antisemitism, at Carnegie Hall.[175][176][177][178]",

                "content": "Smile — Squid Game is ready to play once again. And the new trailer reveals the games are going to be as sinister as ever when Season 2 premieres on Dec. 26. In the trailer, which was released in early December, a hardened Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae), aka Player 456, returns to the deadly games with one goal in mind: to end the horrifying competition once and for all. Forced to play a new set of games, Gi-hun finds himself locked in a tense battle with the shadowy Front Man (Lee Byung-hun), whose true motivations remain cloaked in secrecy as the twists and turns of Season 2 unfurl. Will Gi-hun succeed, and how many more lives will the system claim as he tries? Director Hwang Dong-hyuk is thrilled about what’s in store when Squid Game returns. “I do have a lot on my shoulders, but I’ll make sure it’s worth the wait,” Hwang told Netflix in 2023. The Golden Globes seem to think it is: Squid Game Season 2 has already been nominated for Best Drama Series at the upcoming awards show. Squid Game Season 1 introduced fans to the K-drama’s titular deadly game, which forces citizens to gamble with their lives. In return, they may win a world-changing cash prize — or suffer dire consequences. Down-on-his-luck Gi-hun will continue to lead the series, and Season 2 picks up after his jaw-dropping decisions in the Season 1 finale. “Season 2 explores how Gi-hun follows through on his words after leaving the airport,” says Hwang below in a new behind-the-scenes featurette that revisits Season 1. “Gi-hun’s endeavor to find out who these people are and why they do what they do is the core story of Season 2.” Lee adds: “In Season 1, there was room to show glimpses of Gi-hun’s various personalities, such as his optimistic nature and positive energy. This time, the focus was on his determination.” As you prepare to get into the upcoming game, keep reading to learn everything you want to know about Season 2 — from the release date to details about the new players. The Golden Globe–nominated new season will launch Dec. 26. “Three years after winning Squid Game, Player 456 gave up going to the States and comes back with a new resolution in his mind,” reads the official Season 2 synopsis. “Gi-hun once again dives into the mysterious survival game, starting another life-or-death game with new participants gathered to win the prize of 45.6 billion won.” The trailer also confirms that Wi Ha-jun is back in the role of Hwang Jun-ho, driving the narrative forward as the relentless detective on a mission of his own. What we know so far is that Squid Game Season 2, Episode 1 is called: “Bread and Lottery.” It’s confirmed that some familiar faces will return to the Squid Game cast, including Lee Jung-jae, Lee Byung-hun, Wi Ha-jun, and Gong Yoo. Impeccable newcomers Yim Si-wan, Kang Ha-neul, Park Gyu-young, Lee Jin-uk, Park Sung-hoon, Yang Dong-geun, Kang Ae-sim, Lee David, Choi Seung-hyun, Roh Jae-won, Jo Yu-ri, and Won Ji-an will all appear in Squid Game Season 2 as an ensemble of colorful new characters. You can catch a glimpse of the characters in the brand-new trailer above. Please extend a heartfelt welcome to the following Squid Game Season 2 players: The teaser trailer very clearly reveals Player 456 will return to Squid Game. The actor who plays him, Lee, and director Hwang swear Gi-hun has a good reason for stepping back into the deadly competition. “He wants to return to a ‘normal’ so-called life. [But] there’s something inside him that has already been broken, where he cannot return to the way he was before,” Hwang said during Netflix’s Fall Edit event in November. Although Gi-hun yearns to reconnect with his daughter, “he understands … that he has changed in a way where [that’s] no longer possible.” Gi-hun’s only recourse is to focus on the savage game that transformed him into the person he is now. “That is why I believe that character decides to return [to Squid Game], turn away from [his daughter], and begin this further journey,” Hwang explained. Although Gi-hun will be putting his tracksuit back on, Lee is quick to remind us he’s not the same man he was in Season 1. “I had many opportunities where I was able to express that goodness of heart in the character [in Season 1],” the actor said. “However, in Season 2, while there are certain circumstances that allow for that [quality] to peek out of him … I didn’t have that many opportunities.” You’ll have to tune in this winter to learn how this new version of Gi-hun tackles a contest as treacherous as Squid Game. The Squid Game cast and creative team are happy to help answer this question. In a new video (below), the team looks back on the success of Season 1, while reminiscing about the character dynamics, compelling backstories, and shocking games that enthralled audiences around the world. And they hint at what Season 2 holds. “So we don’t have many survivors from Season 1, meaning that I had to continue on with the narrative with Gi-hun and a handful of other survivors,” director Hwang says in the clip. “I thought it’d be fun to bring back characters who had just a brief appearance in Season 1.” Watch the entire video for a star-studded walk down Squid Game memory lane. And, for even more insights, read the complete Season 1 recap here. Yes, there are. In 2023, the team released photos of the cast gathering for the first table read of Season 2. Now, even more Season 2 photos have just arrived, and you can sneak a peek at them. Below, you can see the much-anticipated return of Gi-hun, Front Man (Lee Byung-hun), and Recruiter (Gong Yoo), and get your first look at a new character played by Park Gyu-young. The thriller’s main set is located in South Korea. Yes! Squid Game: The Official Podcast will also return to help unravel every Season 2 surprise, alongside hosts Phil Yu and Kiera Please. The duo will unpack the thriller’s deadly challenges, layered characters, and each new episode’s moral dilemmas. Listen to the trailer below for a tease of what’s ahead before Squid Game: The Official Podcast Season 2 arrives on Dec. 26. Emmy winner Hwang serves as writer, director, and executive producer. He made history at the 74th Primetime Emmys as the first Asian director to ever win the award for Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series. In a letter to fans in June 2022 (seen above), he teased what viewers could expect from Season 2. The series is produced by Firstman Studio; Kim is the CEO of Firstman Studio and an executive producer. “There’s definitely a lot of pressure on how to make [Season 2] even better,” Kim told Tudum in 2022. “I know that a lot of the different fans and audiences have enjoyed the series very much, but, really, we’re focusing on how to make it even more joyful to the global audience.” Chae Kyoung-sun is Squid Game’s production designer. “I still can’t believe I’ve won a Primetime Emmy. I’m just exhilarated to once again be part of Squid Game,” she told Netflix, looking ahead to Season 2. Hold onto your tracksuit — more Squid Game is on the way. Hwang confirms Season 3 is coming in 2025, and it will be the series’ last. For more information on Squid Game’s farewell season, visit here for updates.

                "title": "Taylor Swift - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. Known for her autobiographical songwriting, artistic reinventions, and cultural impact, Swift is a leading figure in popular music and the subject of widespread media coverage. Swift signed to Big Machine Records in 2005, starting as a country singer with the albums Taylor Swift (2006) and Fearless (2008). The singles \"Teardrops on My Guitar\", \"Love Story\", and \"You Belong with Me\" found crossover success on country and pop radio formats. She incorporated rock on Speak Now (2010) and electronic on Red (2012), later re-calibrating her image from country to pop with the synth-pop set 1989 (2014); the ensuing media scrutiny inspired the hip-hop-imbued Reputation (2017). The albums contained the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\", \"Shake It Off\", \"Blank Space\", \"Bad Blood\" and \"Look What You Made Me Do\". Shifting to Republic Records in 2018, Swift released the electropop album Lover (2019) and switched to indie folk styles in the 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore. She experimented with subdued pop genres on Midnights (2022) and The Tortured Poets Department (2024), and began re-recording her Big Machine albums as Taylor's Version[a] due to an ownership dispute with the label. Through the 2020s, she garnered the US number one songs \"Cardigan\", \"Willow\", \"All Too Well\", \"Anti-Hero\", \"Cruel Summer\", \"Is It Over Now?\", and \"Fortnight\". She has undertaken six concert tours, including the Eras Tour (2023–2024), the highest-grossing tour of all time. Her films include Miss Americana (2020), All Too Well: The Short Film (2021), and The Eras Tour (2023)—the highest-grossing concert film. Swift is one of the world's best-selling music artists, with a record seven albums that moved one million copies first-week. She is the highest-grossing performer, the first billionaire from music primarily, and the world's richest female musician. She has been listed amongst history's greatest artists by publications such as Rolling Stone, Billboard and Forbes, as well as the only individual from the arts to have been named the Time Person of the Year (2023). Swift is the most-awarded artist of the American Music Awards (40), the Billboard Music Awards (49), and the MTV Video Music Awards (30). She also received 14 Grammy Awards (including a record four Album of the Year wins), a Primetime Emmy Award, and a record four IFPI Global Recording Artist of the Year awards. She is an advocate of artists' rights and women's empowerment. Her fans are known as Swifties. Taylor Alison Swift was born on December 13, 1989, in West Reading, Pennsylvania.[1] She is named after the singer-songwriter James Taylor.[2][3] Her father, Scott Kingsley Swift, was a stockbroker for Merrill Lynch, and her mother, Andrea Gardner Swift (née Finlay), worked as a mutual fund marketing executive.[4] Swift's younger brother, Austin, is an actor.[5] Their maternal grandmother, Marjorie Finlay (née Moehlenkamp), was an opera singer,[6] whose singing in church became one of Swift's earliest memories of music that shaped her career.[4] Swift is of Scottish, English, and German descent, with distant Italian and Irish ancestry.[7][8][9] Swift spent her early years on a Christmas tree farm in Pennsylvania that her father had purchased from one of his clients,[10] and she spent her summers at her family's vacation home in Stone Harbor, New Jersey, where she occasionally performed acoustic songs at a local coffee shop.[11] She is a Christian[12] and attended preschool and kindergarten at a Montessori school run by the Bernardine Sisters of St. Francis before transferring to the Wyndcroft School.[13][14] When her family moved to Wyomissing, she attended Wyomissing Area Junior/Senior High School.[15][16] As a child, she performed in Berks Youth Theatre Academy productions[17] and traveled regularly to New York City for vocal and acting lessons.[18] Her early love for country music was influenced by Shania Twain, Patsy Cline, LeAnn Rimes, and the Dixie Chicks,[14] and she spent weekends performing at local festivals and events.[19][20] After watching a documentary about Faith Hill, she became determined to pursue a country-music career in Nashville, Tennessee.[21] At 11, Swift traveled to Nashville with her mother to visit record labels and submit demo tapes of Dolly Parton and Dixie Chicks karaoke covers.[22] She was rejected by all the labels, which led her to focus on songwriting.[23] She started learning the guitar at 12 with the help of Ronnie Cremer, a computer repairman and local musician who also assisted Swift with writing an original song.[24] In 2003, Swift and her parents started working with the talent manager Dan Dymtrow. With his help, Swift modeled for Abercrombie & Fitch and had an original song included on a Maybelline compilation CD.[25] After performing original songs at an RCA Records showcase, 13-year-old Swift was given an artist development deal and began to travel regularly to Nashville with her mother.[26][27] To help Swift break into the country music scene, her father transferred to Merrill Lynch's Nashville office when she was 14 years old, and the family relocated to Hendersonville, Tennessee.[28][29] Swift attended Hendersonville High School[30] before transferring to Aaron Academy after two years, which better accommodated her touring schedule through homeschooling. She graduated one year early.[3][31] In Nashville, Swift worked with experienced Music Row songwriters such as Troy Verges, Brett Beavers, Brett James, Mac McAnally, and the Warren Brothers[32][33] and formed a lasting working relationship with Liz Rose.[34] They began meeting for two-hour writing sessions every Tuesday afternoon after school.[35] Rose called the sessions \"some of the easiest I've ever done. Basically, I was just her editor. She'd write about what happened in school that day. She had such a clear vision of what she was trying to say. And she'd come in with the most incredible hooks.\" Swift became the youngest artist signed by Sony/ATV Tree Music Publishing,[36] but left then BMG-owned RCA Records (later bought by Sony Music) at the age of 14 due to the label's lack of care and them \"cut[ting] other people's stuff\". She was also concerned that development deals can shelve artists[27][20] and recalled: \"I genuinely felt that I was running out of time. I wanted to capture these years of my life on an album while they still represented what I was going through.\"[37] At an industry showcase at Nashville's Bluebird Cafe in 2005, Swift caught the attention of Scott Borchetta, a DreamWorks Records executive who was preparing to form an independent record label, Big Machine Records. She had first met Borchetta in 2004.[39] She was one of Big Machine's first signings,[27] and her father purchased a three-percent stake in the company for an estimated $120,000.[40][41][42] She began working on her eponymous debut album with Nathan Chapman.[20] Swift wrote or co-wrote all album tracks, and co-writers included Rose, Robert Ellis Orrall, Brian Maher, and Angelo Petraglia.[43] Released in October 2006, Taylor Swift peaked at number five on the US Billboard 200, on which it spent 157 weeks—the longest stay on the chart by any release in the US in the 2000s decade.[44][45] Swift became the first female country music artist to write or co-write every track on a platinum-certified debut album.[46] Big Machine Records was still in its infancy during the June 2006 release of the lead single, \"Tim McGraw\", which Swift and her mother helped promote by packaging and sending copies of the CD single to country radio stations.[47] She spent much of 2006 promoting Taylor Swift with a radio tour and television appearances; she opened for Rascal Flatts on select dates during their 2006 tour,[48] as a replacement for Eric Church.[49] Borchetta said that although record industry peers initially disapproved of his signing a 15-year-old singer-songwriter, Swift tapped into a previously unknown market—teenage girls who listen to country music.[47][28] Following \"Tim McGraw\", four more singles were released throughout 2007 and 2008: \"Teardrops on My Guitar\", \"Our Song\", \"Picture to Burn\", and \"Should've Said No\". All appeared on Billboard's Hot Country Songs, with \"Our Song\" and \"Should've Said No\" reaching number one. \"Our Song\" made Swift the youngest person to single-handedly write and sing a Hot Country Songs number-one single,[50] and \"Teardrops on My Guitar\" was Swift's breakthrough single on mainstream radio and charts.[51][52][53] Swift released two EPs, The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection in October 2007 and Beautiful Eyes in July 2008.[54][55] She promoted her debut album extensively as the opening act for other country musicians' tours in 2006 and 2007, including those by George Strait,[56] Brad Paisley,[57] and Tim McGraw and Faith Hill.[58] Swift won multiple accolades for Taylor Swift. She was one of the recipients of the Nashville Songwriters Association's Songwriter/Artist of the Year in 2007, becoming the youngest person given the title.[59] She also won the Country Music Association's Horizon Award for Best New Artist,[60] the Academy of Country Music Awards' Top New Female Vocalist,[61] and the American Music Awards' Favorite Country Female Artist honor.[62] She was also nominated for Best New Artist at the 50th Annual Grammy Awards.[63] In 2008, she opened for Rascal Flatts again[64] and briefly dated the singer Joe Jonas.[65] Swift's second studio album, Fearless, was released in November 2008 in North America,[66] and in March 2009 in other markets.[67] On the Billboard 200, Fearless spent 11 weeks at number one, becoming Swift's first chart topper and the longest-running number-one female country album.[68] It was the bestselling album of 2009 in the US.[69] Its lead single, \"Love Story\", was her first number one in Australia and the first country song to top Billboard's Pop Songs chart,[70][71] and its third single, \"You Belong with Me\", was the first country song to top Billboard's all-genre Radio Songs chart.[72] Three other singles were released in 2008–2010: \"White Horse\", \"Fifteen\", and \"Fearless\". All five singles were Hot Country Songs top 10 entries, with \"Love Story\" and \"You Belong with Me\" topping the chart.[73] In 2009, Swift toured as an opening act for Keith Urban and embarked on her first headlining tour, the Fearless Tour.[74] \"You Belong with Me\" won Best Female Video at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards.[75] Her acceptance speech was interrupted by the rapper Kanye West, an incident that became the subject of controversy and widespread media coverage.[76] That year, Swift won five American Music Awards, including Artist of the Year and Favorite Country Album.[77] Billboard named her the 2009 Artist of the Year.[78] She won Video of the Year and Female Video of the Year for \"Love Story\" at the 2009 CMT Music Awards, where she made a parody video of the song with rapper T-Pain called \"Thug Story\".[79] At the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards, Fearless was named Album of the Year and Best Country Album, and \"White Horse\" won Best Country Song and Best Female Country Vocal Performance.[80] At the 2009 Country Music Association Awards, Swift won Album of the Year for Fearless and was named Entertainer of the Year, the youngest person to win the honor.[81] Throughout 2009, Swift featured on and wrote other musicians' releases. She featured on \"Half of My Heart\" by John Mayer, whom she was romantically linked with in late 2009.[82][83] She wrote \"Best Days of Your Life\" for Kellie Pickler,[84] co-wrote and featured on Boys Like Girls' \"Two Is Better Than One,[85] and wrote two songs—\"You'll Always Find Your Way Back Home\" and \"Crazier\"—for the soundtrack of Hannah Montana: The Movie, in which she had a cameo appearance.[86][87] She wrote and recorded \"Today Was a Fairytale\" for the soundtrack of Valentine's Day (2010), in which she had her acting debut.[88] \"Today Was a Fairytale\" was her first number-one single on the Canadian Hot 100.[89] While shooting Valentine's Day in October 2009, Swift dated co-star Taylor Lautner.[90] On television, she made her debut as a rebellious teenager in an CSI: Crime Scene Investigation episode[91] and hosted and performed as the musical guest on Saturday Night Live; she was the first host ever to write their own opening monologue.[92][93] Swift's third studio album, Speak Now, was released in October 2010.[94] Written solely by Swift,[95] the album debuted the Billboard 200 with over one million US copies sold first week[96] and became the fastest-selling digital album by a female artist.[97] Speak Now was supported by six singles: \"Mine\", \"Back to December\", \"Mean\", \"The Story of Us\", \"Sparks Fly\", and \"Ours\". \"Mine\" peaked at number three and was the highest-charting single on the Billboard Hot 100,[98] the first three singles reached the top 10 in Canada,[89] and the last two reached number one on Hot Country Songs.[73] Swift promoted Speak Now with the Speak Now World Tour from February 2011 to March 2012[99] and the live album Speak Now World Tour – Live.[100] At the 54th Annual Grammy Awards in 2012, Swift performed \"Mean\", which won Best Country Song and Best Country Solo Performance.[101] She was named Songwriter/Artist of the Year by the Nashville Songwriters Association (2010 and 2011),[102][103] Woman of the Year by Billboard (2011),[104] and Entertainer of the Year by the Academy of Country Music (2011 and 2012)[105] and the Country Music Association in 2011.[106] At the American Music Awards of 2011, Swift won Artist of the Year and Favorite Country Album.[107] Rolling Stone named Speak Now on its list of \"50 Best Female Albums of All Time\" (2012).[108] Red, Swift's fourth studio album, was released in October 2012.[109] On Red, Swift worked with Chapman and new producers including Max Martin, Shellback, Dan Wilson, Jeff Bhasker, Dann Huff, and Butch Walker, resulting in a genre-spanning record that incorporated eclectic styles of pop and rock such as Britrock, dubstep, and dance-pop.[110][111] The album opened at number one on the Billboard 200 with 1.21 million sales[112] and was Swift's first number-one album in the UK.[113] Its lead single, \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\", was her first number one on the Billboard Hot 100,[114] and its third single, \"I Knew You Were Trouble\", reached the top five on charts worldwide.[115] Other singles from Red were \"Begin Again\", \"22\", \"Everything Has Changed\", \"The Last Time\", and \"Red\".[116] Red and its single \"Begin Again\" received three nominations at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards (2014).[117] Swift received American Music Awards for Best Female Country Artist in 2012, Artist of the Year in 2013,[118][119] and the Nashville Songwriters Association's Songwriter/Artist Award for the fifth and sixth consecutive years.[120] At the 2014 Country Music Association Awards, Swift was honored with the Pinnacle Award, making her the second recipient in history after Garth Brooks.[121] The Red Tour ran from March 2013 to June 2014 and became the highest-grossing country tour upon completion.[122] Swift continued writing songs for films and featuring on other artists' releases. On the soundtrack album to The Hunger Games (2012), Swift wrote and recorded \"Eyes Open\" and \"Safe & Sound\"; the latter of which was co-written with the Civil Wars and T-Bone Burnett. \"Safe & Sound\" won the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media.[123] She wrote and produced \"Sweeter than Fiction\" with Jack Antonoff for the soundtrack to One Chance (2013).[124] Swift featured on B.o.B's \"Both of Us\" (2012)[125] and provided vocals for Tim McGraw's \"Highway Don't Care\" (2013), also featuring Keith Urban.[126] She was a voice actress in The Lorax (2012),[127] made a cameo in the sitcom New Girl (2013),[128] and had a supporting role in the dystopian film The Giver (2014).[129] From 2010 to 2013, Swift was romantically involved with the actor Jake Gyllenhaal, the political heir Conor Kennedy, and the singer Harry Styles.[83] In March 2014, Swift began living in New York City, which she credited as a creative influence on her fifth studio album, 1989.[note 1] She described 1989 as her first \"official pop album\" and produced it with Jack Antonoff, Max Martin, Shellback, Imogen Heap, Ryan Tedder, and Ali Payami.[132] Released in October 2014, the album opened atop the Billboard 200 with 1.28 million copies sold.[133] Its singles \"Shake It Off\", \"Blank Space\", and \"Bad Blood\" reached number one in Australia, Canada, and the US, with the first two making Swift the first woman to replace herself at the Hot 100 top spot.[134] Other singles include \"Style\", \"Wildest Dreams\", \"Out of the Woods\", and \"New Romantics\".[135] The 1989 World Tour (2015) was the highest-grossing tour of the year with $250 million in total revenue.[136] After publishing an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal stressing the importance of albums as a creative medium for artists,[137] in November 2014, Swift removed her catalog from ad-supported, free music streaming platforms such as Spotify.[138] In a June 2015 open letter, Swift criticized Apple Music for not offering royalties to artists during its free three-month trial period and threatened to withdraw her music from the platform,[139] which prompted Apple Inc. to announce that it would pay artists during the free trial period.[140] Swift then agreed to keep 1989 and her catalog on Apple Music.[141] Big Machine Records returned Swift's catalog to Spotify among other free streaming platforms in June 2017.[142] Swift was named Billboard's Woman of the Year in 2014, becoming the first artist to win the award twice.[143] At the 2014 American Music Awards, Swift received the inaugural Dick Clark Award for Excellence.[144] On her 25th birthday in 2014, the Grammy Museum at L.A. Live opened an exhibit in her honor in Los Angeles that ran until October 4, 2015.[145][146] In 2015, Swift won the Brit Award for International Female Solo Artist.[147] \"Bad Blood\" won Video of the Year and Best Collaboration at the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards.[148] At the 58th Grammy Awards (2016), 1989 won Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album, making Swift the first woman to win Album of the Year twice.[149] Swift dated the DJ Calvin Harris from March 2015 to June 2016.[150] They co-wrote the song \"This Is What You Came For\", featuring vocals from Rihanna; Swift was initially credited under the pseudonym Nils Sjöberg.[151] She recorded \"I Don't Wanna Live Forever\" with Zayn Malik for the soundtrack to Fifty Shades Darker (2017)[152] and won a Country Music Association Award for Song of the Year with \"Better Man\", which she wrote for the band Little Big Town.[153] In April 2016, Kanye West released the single \"Famous\", in which he references Swift in the line, \"I made that bitch famous.\" Swift criticized West and said she never consented to the lyric, but West claimed that he had received her approval and his then-wife Kim Kardashian released video clips of Swift and West discussing the song amicably over the phone. The controversy made Swift a subject of an online \"cancel\" movement.[154] In late 2016, after briefly dating Tom Hiddleston, Swift began a six-year relationship with Joe Alwyn and retreated herself from the public spotlight.[155][156] In August 2017, Swift successfully countersued David Mueller, a former radio jockey for KYGO-FM, who sued her for damages from loss of employment. Four years earlier, she informed Mueller's bosses that he had sexually assaulted her by groping her at an event.[157] The public controversies influenced Swift's sixth studio album, Reputation, which explored the impact of her fame and musically incorporated electropop with urban styles of hip hop and R&B.[158] Released in November 2017,[159] Reputation opened atop the Billboard 200 with 1.21 million US sales[160] and topped the charts in the UK, Australia, and Canada.[161] The album's lead single, \"Look What You Made Me Do\", was Swift's first UK number-one single[162] and topped charts in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, and the US.[163] Its singles \"...Ready for It?\", \"End Game\", and \"Delicate\" were released to pop radio.[164] Reputation was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album.[165] Swift featured on the country duo Sugarland's \"Babe\" (2018).[166] At the 2018 American Music Awards, Swift won four awards, which made her accumulate 23 trophies in total and become the AMAs' most awarded female musician, surpassing Whitney Houston.[167] The same year, she embarked on her Reputation Stadium Tour,[168] which became the highest-grossing North American concert tour in history and grossed $345.7 million worldwide.[169] In November 2018, Swift signed a new deal with Universal Music Group, which promoted her subsequent albums under Republic Records' imprint.[170] The contract included a provision for Swift to maintain ownership of her masters. In addition, in the event that Universal sold any part of its stake in Spotify, it agreed to distribute a non-recoupable portion of the proceeds among its artists.[171][172] Swift's first album with Republic Records, Lover, was released in August 2019.[173] She produced the album with Antonoff, Louis Bell, Frank Dukes, and Joel Little.[174] Lover peaked atop the charts of such territories as Australia, Canada, Ireland, Mexico, Norway, Sweden, the UK, and the US.[175] The album spawned five singles: \"Me!\", \"You Need to Calm Down\", \"Lover\", \"The Man\", and \"Cruel Summer\"; the first two singles peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100, and the lattermost single became a resurgent success in 2023, reaching number one.[176] Lover was 2019's best selling album in the US and best selling album by a solo artist worldwide.[177] The album and its singles earned three nominations at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards in 2020.[178] At the 2019 MTV Video Music Awards, Swift won three awards including Video of the Year for \"You Need to Calm Down\", becoming the first female and second artist overall to win the category for a self-directed video.[179] While promoting Lover in 2019, Swift became embroiled in a public dispute with the talent manager Scooter Braun after he purchased Big Machine Records, including the masters of her albums that the label had released.[180] Swift said she had been trying to buy the masters, but Big Machine would only allow her to do so if she exchanged one new album for each older one under a new contract, which she refused to sign.[180] In November 2020, Swift began re-recording her back catalog, which enabled her to own the new masters and the licensing of her songs for commercial use, substituting for the Big Machine-owned masters.[181] In February 2020, Swift signed a global publishing deal with Universal Music Publishing Group after her 16-year contract with Sony/ATV expired.[182] Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Swift surprise-released two \"sister albums\" that she recorded and produced with Antonoff and Aaron Dessner: Folklore in July and Evermore in December.[183] Joe Alwyn co-wrote and co-produced a few songs under the pseudonym William Bowery.[184] Both albums incorporated a muted indie folk production;[185] each was supported by three singles catering to US pop, country, and triple A radio formats. The singles were \"Cardigan\", \"Betty\", and \"Exile\" from Folklore, and \"Willow\", \"No Body, No Crime\", and \"Coney Island\" from Evermore.[186] Folklore was the bestselling album of 2020 in the US[187] and, together with \"Cardigan\", made Swift the first artist to debut a US number-one album and a number-one song in the same week; she achieved the feat again with Evermore and \"Willow\".[188] According to Billboard, Swift was the highest-paid musician in the US and highest-paid solo musician worldwide of 2020.[189] Folklore made Swift the first woman to win the Grammy Award for Album of the Year three times, winning the category at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards (2021).[190] At the American Music Awards, Swift won three awards including Artist of the Year for a third record time (2020)[191] and Favorite Pop/Rock Female Artist and Favorite Pop/Rock Album (2021).[192] Swift played Bombalurina in the film adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical Cats (2019), for which she co-wrote and recorded the Golden Globe-nominated original song \"Beautiful Ghosts\".[193][194] The documentary Miss Americana, which chronicled parts of Swift's life and career, premiered at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival.[195] Swift's re-recordings of her first six studio albums began with Fearless (Taylor's Version) and Red (Taylor's Version), which were released in April and November 2021. Both peaked atop the Billboard 200, and the former was the first re-recorded album to do so.[196] Fearless (Taylor's Version) was preceded by \"Love Story (Taylor's Version)\", which made Swift the second artist after Dolly Parton to have both the original and re-recorded versions of a song reach number one on Hot Country Songs.[197] Red (Taylor's Version) was supported by \"All Too Well (10 Minute Version)\", which became the longest song in history to top the Hot 100.[198] Swift's tenth studio album, Midnights, was released in October 2022.[199] The album incorporates a restrained electropop[200] and synth-pop sound[201] with elements of hip hop, R&B, and electronica.[199][202] In the US, Midnights was her fifth to open atop the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of over one million copies, and its tracks, led by the single \"Anti-Hero\", made Swift the first artist to monopolize the top 10 of the Hot 100.[203] Globally, the album broke the record for the most single-day streams and most single-week streams on Spotify and peaked atop the charts of at least 14 countries.[204] The album's two further singles, \"Lavender Haze\" and \"Karma\", both peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100.[205] According to Billboard, Swift was the top-earning solo artist in the US and the top-earning musician worldwide of 2021.[206][207] She won six American Music Awards including Artist of the Year in 2022.[208] At the MTV Video Music Awards, Swift won her third and fourth trophies for Video of the Year with All Too Well: The Short Film, her self-directed short film that accompanies \"All Too Well (10 Minute Version)\", in 2022[209] and \"Anti-Hero\" in 2023.[210] During this period, Swift won three Grammy Awards: Best Music Video for All Too Well: The Short Film[211] and Best Pop Vocal Album and Album of the Year for Midnights. Swift became the first artist to win Album of the Year four times in Grammy history.[212] Swift's next two re-recorded albums, Speak Now (Taylor's Version) and 1989 (Taylor's Version), were released in July and October 2023. The former made Swift the woman with the most number-one albums (12) in Billboard 200 history, surpassing Barbra Streisand,[213] and the latter was her sixth album to sell one million copies in a single week in the US, claiming her career's largest album sales week.[214] 1989 (Taylor's Version)'s single \"Is It Over Now?\" peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100.[215] Swift featured on Big Red Machine's \"Renegade\" and \"Birch\" (2021),[216] Haim's \"Gasoline\" (2021),[217] Ed Sheeran's \"The Joker and the Queen\" (2022),[218] and the National's \"The Alcott\" (2023).[219] For the soundtrack of Where the Crawdads Sing (2022), she wrote and recorded \"Carolina\", which received nominations for Best Original Song at the Golden Globes and Best Song Written for Visual Media at the Grammy Awards.[220] In 2023, Swift was the most streamed artist on Spotify,[221] Apple Music,[222] and Amazon Music;[223] and the first act to place number one on the year-end Billboard top artists list in three different decades (2009, 2015 and 2023).[224] She had five out of the 10 best-selling albums of 2023 in the US, a record since Luminate began tracking US music sales in 1991.[225] Besides music, Swift had a supporting role in the period comedy film Amsterdam (2022).[226] In March 2023, Swift embarked on the Eras Tour, a retrospective tour covering all her studio albums. Media outlets extensively covered the tour's global cultural and economic impact,[227] and its US leg broke the record for the most tickets sold in a day.[203] Ticketmaster received public and political criticisms for mishandling the tour's ticket sales.[228] The Eras Tour became the highest-grossing tour in history.[229][230] Its concert film, released to theaters worldwide on October 13, 2023, grossed over $250 million to become the highest-grossing concert film and was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Cinematic and Box Office Achievement.[231][232] Swift's eleventh studio album, The Tortured Poets Department, was released on April 19, 2024.[233] Topping charts globally, the album broke a string of records: it marked the first album ever to amass 1 billion Spotify streams in a week; sold 2.6 million units in its first week in the US; made Swift the first artist to monopolize the top 14 of the Billboard Hot 100 and the top 10 of Australia's ARIA Singles Chart; and went on to spend 17 weeks atop the Billboard 200—Swift's longest-running number-one album on the chart. The lead single, \"Fortnight,\" featuring Post Malone, became Swift's 12th number one song on the Hot 100.[234][235][236] After the pandemic, Swift's music releases, touring, and related activities culminated in an unprecedented height of popularity.[237] From 2023 onward, Swift found ubiquitous success, albeit more dominant than before, with the successes of the re-recordings, the Eras Tour, its concert film, Midnights, and The Tortured Poets Department, significantly increasing her net worth; Music Business Worldwide remarked this as a \"new stratosphere of global career success\" for Swift.[238][239] In 2023, she began dating the American football player Travis Kelce,[240] and in 2024, won Artist of the Year at the 2024 iHeartRadio Music Awards.[241] Swift was Spotify's most streamed artist of 2023 and 2024.[242][243] In January 2024, AI-generated fake pornographic images portraying Swift were posted to Twitter and spread to other social media platforms, spurring criticism and demands for legal reform.[244] In July, Swift and Kelce received death threats from a stalker in Gelsenkirchen, Germany,[245] and three children were killed in a stabbing attack at a Swift-themed workshop in Southport, England, leading to civil unrest in the UK.[246] In August, all three of the Eras Tour concerts in Vienna were canceled following the arrest of two suspects for allegedly planning an Islamic State-inspired terrorist attack in the city. The plan was uncovered by US Intelligence and was thwarted by Austrian police forces.[247] Swift has ventured into diverse genres throughout her career, including pop,[b] country,[c] folk,[d] rock,[e] and alternative music.[f] Her early musical influences were 1990s female country musicians such as Shania Twain, Faith Hill, LeAnn Rimes, and the Dixie Chicks,[264] and Keith Urban's country crossover sounds incorporating rock, pop, and blues.[265] She self-identified as a country musician and achieved prominence as a country pop singer with her first four studio albums, from Taylor Swift to Red.[266] The albums feature country signifiers such as banjo, six-string banjo, mandolin, fiddle, and a slight vocal twang, in addition to pop melodies and rock influences;[267][268] Speak Now draws on rock styles such as pop rock, pop-punk, and 1980s arena rock.[95][269] Critics argued that country was an indicator of Swift's narrative songwriting rather than musical direction[270][271] and accused her of causing mainstream country music to stray from its roots.[272][273] After the critical debate around Red's eclectic pop, rock, and electronic styles, Swift chose 1980s synth-pop as a defining sound of her recalibrated pop artistry and image, inspired by the music of Phil Collins, Annie Lennox, Peter Gabriel, and Madonna.[274][275] 1989, the first album in this direction, incorporates electronic arrangements consisting of dense synthesizers and drum machines.[276] Swift expanded on the electronic production on her next albums;[277] Reputation consists of hip hop, R&B, and EDM influences;[158][278] and Lover features eclectic elements from country, pop-punk, and folk rock.[279] When Swift embraced a pop identity, rockist critics regarded her move as an erosion of her country music songwriting authenticity,[280] but others regarded it as necessary for Swift's artistic evolution and defended her as a pioneer of poptimism.[281][282] Her 2020 alternative albums Folklore and Evermore explore indie styles of rock and folk, and both incorporate a subtle, stripped-back soundscape with orchestration, synthesizers, and drum pads.[263][283][284] The latter experiments with varied song structures, asymmetric time signatures, and diverse instruments.[285][286] Critics deemed the indie styles a mature representation of Swift's artistry as a singer-songwriter.[284] Midnights and The Tortured Poets Department both incorporate a minimalist, subdued synth-pop sound, making use of analog synthesizers, sustained bass notes, and simple drum machine patterns.[287][288] With continuous musical reinventions,[289] Swift was described by Time and the BBC as a musical \"chameleon\".[290][291] Jody Rosen commented that by originating her career in Nashville, Swift made a \"bait-and-switch maneuver, planting roots in loamy country soil, then pivoting to pop\".[292] Clash wrote that she has the versatility to \"no longer [...] be defined by any genre or sound label\".[293] According to Ann Powers, Swift's sound is genre-agnostic, blending and \"reconfiguring\" elements of country, R&B, indie pop, and hip hop.[294][295] Swift possesses a mezzo-soprano vocal range[300] and a generally soft and breathy timbre that Rolling Stone deemed versatile.[301][302] Reviews of Swift's early country albums criticized her vocals as weak and strained compared to those of other female country singers.[303] Despite the criticism, most reviewers appreciated that Swift refrained from correcting her pitch with Auto-Tune and how she prioritized \"intimacy over power and nuance\" to communicate the messages of her songs with her audience[304]—a style that has been described as conversational.[305][306] According to Powers, Swift's defining vocal feature was her attention to detail to convey an exact feeling—\"the line that slides down like a contented sigh or up like a raised eyebrow\".[307] On Red and 1989, Swift's vocals are electronically processed to accompany the pop production.[308][305] Her voice on Reputation and Midnights incorporates hip-hop and R&B influences that result in a near-rap delivery which emphasizes rhythm and cadence over melody.[309][294] She uses her lower register vocals extensively in \"Cardigan\"[310] and both her lower and upper registers in Evermore; the musicologist Alyssa Barca described her timbre in the upper register as \"breathy and bright\" and the lower register as \"full and dark\".[286] Reviews in The New York Times, Variety and The Atlantic were more appreciative of Swift's vocals in her later albums.[268][311][312][313] She ranked 102nd on Rolling Stone's 2023 list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time: \"A decade ago, including her on this list would have been a controversial move, but recent releases like Folklore, Evermore, and Midnights officially settled the argument.\"[302] Laura Snapes of The Guardian said that Swift's \"vocal directness\" enables her to express wide-ranging feelings, highlighting some trademarks such as \"yo-yoing vocal yelp\" and \"climactic, processed cri de coeur\".[314] Amanda Petrusich praised how the clarity and tone of Swift's live vocals accentuate her lyrics.[315] Swift's fascination with songwriting began in her childhood. She credited her mother with igniting confidence and early songwriting interests by helping her prepare for class presentations.[316][317] She enjoyed Disney film soundtracks and would make up lyrics once she had run out of words singing them.[318] Her lyrical influences include female country songwriters such as Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Tammy Wynette, and Dolly Parton;[19][104] 1990s songwriters such as Melissa Etheridge, Sarah McLachlan, and Alanis Morissette;[319] Joni Mitchell;[320] and Fall Out Boy.[321] She listed Paul McCartney, Bruce Springsteen, Emmylou Harris, and Kris Kristofferson as career role models, citing their both evolving and consistent songwriting outputs.[28][322] Her literary influences include the authors William Shakespeare, Nathaniel Hawthorne, F. Scott Fitzgerald,[323] and the poets William Wordsworth, Robert Frost, and Emily Dickinson;[324] the last of whom was a distant cousin of Swift.[325] In The New Yorker in 2011, Swift said she identifies as a songwriter first: \"I write songs, and my voice is just a way to get those lyrics across\".[28] Her personal experiences were a common inspiration for her early songs, which helped her navigate life.[326][29] Her \"diaristic\" technique began with identifying an emotion, followed by a corresponding melody.[327][328] On her first three studio albums, love, heartbreak, and insecurities, from an adolescent perspective, were dominant themes.[95][329] She delved into the tumult of toxic relationships on Red,[330] and embraced nostalgia and post-romance positivity on 1989.[274] Reputation was inspired by the downsides of Swift's fame,[331] and Lover detailed her realization of the \"full spectrum of love\".[332] Other themes in Swift's music include family dynamics, friendship,[333][334] alienation, self-awareness, and tackling vitriol, especially sexism.[317][335] She often references or draws inspiration from historical events and figures.[336] Swift's confessional lyrics received positive reviews from critics,[337][28][338] who highlighted their vivid details and emotional engagement, which they found uncommon in pop music,[339][340][341] although some perceived her as a fragile, juvenile artist, a label she has consistently challenged.[337] Critics also praised her melodic compositions; Rolling Stone described Swift as \"a songwriting savant with an intuitive gift for verse-chorus-bridge architecture\".[342][305] NPR dubbed Swift \"a master of the vernacular in her lyrics\",[158] remarking that her songs offer emotional engagement because \"the wit and clarity of her arrangements turn them from standard fare to heartfelt disclosures\".[305] Despite the positive reception, The New Yorker stated she was generally portrayed \"more as a skilled technician than as a Dylanesque visionary\".[28] Tabloid media often speculated and linked the subjects of her songs with her ex-lovers, a practice reviewers and Swift herself criticized as sexist.[343][344][345] Aside from clues in album liner notes, Swift avoided talking about the subjects of her songs.[346] On her 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, Swift was inspired by escapism and romanticism to explore fictional narratives.[347] She imposed emotions onto imagined characters and story arcs, which liberated her from tabloid attention and suggested new paths for her artistry.[327] Swift explained that she welcomed the new songwriting direction after she stopped worrying about commercial success.[347] According to Spin, she explored complex emotions with \"precision and devastation\" on Evermore.[348] Consequence stated her 2020 albums convinced skeptics of her songwriting prowess, noting her transformation from \"teenage wunderkind to a confident and careful adult\".[349] Swift divides her writing into three types: \"quill lyrics\", songs rooted in antiquated poeticism; \"fountain pen lyrics\", based on modern and vivid storylines; and \"glitter gel pen lyrics\", which are lively and frivolous.[350] Fans noticed that the fifth track of every Swift album was the most emotionally vulnerable of the album.[351] Awarding her with the Songwriter Icon Award in 2021, the National Music Publishers' Association remarked that \"no one is more influential when it comes to writing music today\".[352] The Week deemed her the foremost female songwriter of modern times,[353] and the Nashville Songwriters Association International named her Songwriter-Artist of the Decade in 2022.[203] Swift has also published two original poems: \"Why She Disappeared\" and \"If You're Anything Like Me\".[354] Critics have analyzed the distinctive qualities and thematic depth in Swift's songwriting. Critic Kitty Empire opined in 2024 that Swift is \"a profoundly old-fashioned artist\", whose songs \"tell a story, in succinct, emotive ways that often scan meticulously\" unlike most pop music of the time; Empire attributed it to Swift's country beginnings.[355] Swift's bridges are often noted as one of the best aspects of her songs,[356][349] earning her the title \"Queen of Bridges\" from Time.[357] Mojo dubbed her \"a sharp narrator with a gift for the extended metaphor\".[358] Academics have variably described her as a poet laureate,[359] philosopher,[360] and bard.[292] Swift commands large audiences on stage,[361][362][363] captivating them through emotional storytelling and vocal delivery rather than relying on elaborate choreography.[364] According to V magazine's Greg Krelenstein, she possesses \"a rare gift of turning a stadium spectacle into an intimate setting\", irrespective of whether she is \"plucking a guitar or leading an army of dancers\".[365] In a 2008 review of Swift's early performances, Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker called Swift a \"preternaturally skilled\" entertainer with a vibrant stage presence, adding \"she returned the crowd's energy with the professionalism she has shown since the age of fourteen.\"[271] In 2023, Adrian Horton of The Guardian noted her \"seemingly endless stamina\" on the Eras Tour,[366] and i critic Ilana Kaplan called her showmanship \"unparalleled\".[367] Swift's concert productions have been characterized by elaborate Broadway theatricality and high technology,[368] and her performances frequently incorporate a live band, with whom she has played and toured since 2007.[369] Swift also often accompanies herself with musical instruments such as electric guitar;[370] acoustic guitar; piano;[371] and sometimes twelve-string guitar,[372][373] six-string banjo,[374] or ukulele.[375] Interacting frequently with the audience, her solo acoustic performances are considered intimate and emotionally resonant, complementing her story-based lyrics and fan connection.[315][376] Lydia Burgham of The Spinoff opined that this intimacy remains \"integral to her singer-songwriter origins\".[377][371] Chris Willman of Variety called Swift \"pop's most approachable superstar\",[378] and the 21st century's most popular performer.[379] Swift emphasizes visuals as a key creative component of her music-making process.[380] She has collaborated with different directors to produce her music videos, and over time, she has become more involved with writing and directing. She developed the concept and treatment for \"Mean\" in 2011[381] and co-directed the music video for \"Mine\" with Roman White the year before.[382] In an interview, White said that Swift \"was keenly involved in writing the treatment, casting and wardrobe. And she stayed for both the 15-hour shooting days, even when she wasn't in the scenes.\"[383] From 2014 to 2018, Swift collaborated with director Joseph Kahn on eight music videos—four each from her albums 1989 and Reputation. Kahn has praised Swift's involvement.[384] She worked with American Express for the \"Blank Space\" music video (which Kahn directed) and served as an executive producer for the interactive app AMEX Unstaged: Taylor Swift Experience, for which she won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Interactive Program in 2015.[385] Swift produced the music video for \"Bad Blood\" and won a Grammy Award for Best Music Video in 2016.[386] Her production company, Taylor Swift Productions, is credited with producing all of her visual media, starting with the 2018 concert documentary Reputation Stadium Tour.[387] She continued to co-direct music videos for the Lover singles \"Me!\" with Dave Meyers, and \"You Need to Calm Down\" (also serving as a co-executive producer) and \"Lover\" with Drew Kirsch,[388] but first ventured into sole direction with the video for \"The Man\" (which won her the MTV Video Music Award for Best Direction).[389] After Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions, Swift debuted as a filmmaker with All Too Well: The Short Film,[203] which made her the first artist to win the Grammy Award for Best Music Video as a sole director.[390] Swift has cited Chloé Zhao, Greta Gerwig, Nora Ephron, Guillermo del Toro, John Cassavetes, and Noah Baumbach as filmmaking influences.[380] Swift's discography is a \"critically hailed songbook\", as per Time's Sam Lansky.[391] She has won 14 Grammy Awards (including four for Album of the Year—the most won by an artist),[392] an Emmy Award,[393] 40 American Music Awards (the most won by an artist),[394] 49 Billboard Music Awards (the most won by an artist),[395] 118 Guinness World Records,[396] 30 MTV Video Music Awards (including five Video of the Year wins—the most by an act),[397] 12 Country Music Association Awards (including the Pinnacle Award),[398] eight Academy of Country Music Awards,[399] and two Brit Awards.[147] As a songwriter, she has been honored by the Nashville Songwriters Association,[59][400] the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and the National Music Publishers' Association and was the youngest person on Rolling Stone's list of the 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time in 2015.[401][402] At the 64th BMI Awards in 2016, Swift was the first woman to be honored with an award named after its recipient.[403] From available data, Swift has amassed over 50 million album sales and 150 million single sales as of 2019,[404][405][406] and 114 million units globally, including 78 billion streams as of 2021.[407][408] The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry ranked her as the Global Recording Artist of the Year for a record four times (2014, 2019, 2022, and 2023).[409] Swift has the most number-one albums in the UK and Ireland for a female artist this century,[410][411] earned the highest income for an artist on Chinese digital music platforms (CN¥ 159,000,000 as of 2021),[412] and is the first artist to occupy the entire top five[note 2] of the Australian albums chart[415][416] and the top ten of the country's singles chart.[417] Swift remains the world's highest-grossing touring act ever, with cumulative ticket sales at $3.12 billion as of December 2024, per Pollstar.[418] The Eras Tour is the highest-grossing tour of all time and the first to surpass $1 billion in revenue.[419][229] Beginning with Fearless, each of her studio albums have opened with over one million global units.[420][421] Swift is the most-streamed act on Spotify,[422] and the most-streamed female artist on Apple Music.[423] On Spotify, she is the only artist to have received more than 250 million and 350 million streams in one day (260 million on October 27, 2023, and 380 million on April 19, 2024)[424] and was the first female act to reach 100 million monthly listeners.[425][198] The most entries and the most simultaneous entries (175 and 34 songs), and most number-ones (5) for a soloist on the Billboard Global 200, are among her feats.[426][427] Swift is the first and only artist to occupy the top nine spots on the Global 200.[426] She has the most entries (154), top-ten songs (20), and number-ones (3)[note 3] among solo acts on the Global 200 Excl.

Time included her on its annual list of the 100 most influential people in 2010, 2015, and 2019.[447] She was one of the \"Silence Breakers\" that the magazine spotlighted as Person of the Year in 2017 for speaking up about sexual assault,[448] and she received the honor again in 2023 for her cultural domination that year.[391] Time described Swift as the first Person of the Year to be recognized for \"achievement in the arts\", as well as the first woman to be recognized and appear on a Person of the Year cover more than once.[449][391] In 2014, she was named to Forbes' 30 Under 30 list in the music category[450] and again in 2017 in its \"All-Star Alumni\" category.[451] Swift became the youngest woman to be included on Forbes' list of the 100 most powerful women in 2015, ranked at number 64.[452] In 2023, she was ranked by Forbes as the fifth-most powerful woman in the world, the first entertainer to place in the top five.[453] Swift received an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree from New York University and served as its commencement speaker on May 18, 2022.[203] In 2024, Billboard ranked her at number 2 on its \"Greatest Pop Stars of the 21st Century\" list.[254] Swift has been credited with making a profound impact on the music industry, popular culture, and the economy.[454][455] She dominates cultural conversations,[456][457] leading some publications to describe her as a cultural \"vitality\" or zeitgeist.[458][459][360] Her music, life, and public image are points of attention in global celebrity culture.[289] Initially a teen idol,[460] she has been referred to as a pop icon;[277][461] publications describe her enormous popularity and longevity as unwitnessed since the 20th century.[462][463] In 2013, New York magazine's Jody Rosen dubbed Swift the \"world's biggest pop star\" and opined that the trajectory of her stardom has defied established patterns. Rosen added that Swift \"falls between genres, eras, demographics, paradigms, trends\", leaving her contemporaries \"vying for second place\".[292] Critics regard Swift as a rare yet successful combination of the pop star and singer-songwriter archetypes.[464] Swift's fans are known as Swifties.[228] Billboard noted that only a few artists have achieved her level of chart success, critical acclaim, and fan support.[465] Swift's million-selling albums are considered an anomaly in the streaming-dominated industry following the end of the album era in the 2010s.[466][467] Economist Alan Krueger described Swift as an \"economic genius\".[468] Although labeled by the media in her early career as \"America's Sweetheart\" for her girl next door persona,[469][470] Swift has been called by detractors \"calculated\" and manipulative of her image, a narrative bolstered by her 2016 dispute with West.[471][472] Critics have also noted that her personal life and career have been subject to intense misogyny and \"slut-shaming\",[473][474] as well as rampant media scrutiny and tabloid speculation.[475] Swift has also been a victim of numerous house break-ins and stalkers, some of whom were armed.[476][477] Swift's private jet use has drawn scrutiny for its carbon emissions.[478][479] In 2023, a spokesperson for Swift stated that she had purchased more than double the required carbon credits to offset all tour travel and personal flights.[480][481] In December 2023, Swift's lawyers sent a cease and desist letter to American programmer Jack Sweeney over tracking her private jet, alleging stalking and safety risks; media outlets have reported that the information posted by Sweeney is a synthesis of publicly available data.[482][483] In February 2024, it was reported that Swift had sold one of her two private jets.[484] \"You have different artists dominating different sectors of the industry: Some are huge at streaming, some are big draws on the road. But we're at this moment where there's no one better than Taylor Swift, whether that's on the radio, with streaming, ticket sales or just cultural impact.\" Swift helped shape the modern country music scene,[486] having extended her success beyond the Anglosphere,[292][486] pioneered the use of the internet (Myspace) as a marketing tool,[27][47] and introduced the genre to a younger generation.[487][292] Country labels have since become interested in signing young singers who write their own music;[488] her guitar performances contributed to the \"Taylor Swift factor\": a phenomenon to which an upsurge in guitar sales to women, a previously ignored demographic, is attributed.[489][490] According to Pitchfork, Swift changed the music landscape with her genre transitions, a discography that accommodates cultural shifts,[491] and Billboard notes her ability to popularize any sound in mainstream music.[492] Lyrically, in being personal and vulnerable in her songs, music journalist Nick Catucci opined Swift helped make space for later singers like Billie Eilish, Ariana Grande, and Halsey to do the same.[174] Scholars have highlighted the literary sensibility and poptimist implications of Swift.[324][493] She has been credited with legitimizing and popularizing the concept of album \"eras\".[494][495] Swift is a subject of academic study and scholarly media research.[289] Various educational institutions offer courses on Swift in literary, cultural, and sociopolitical contexts.[496][289] Swift has influenced numerous music artists, and her albums have inspired a generation of singer-songwriters.[487][283][497] Journalists praise her ability to reform industry practices, noting how her actions changed streaming policies, prompted awareness of intellectual property in new musicians,[498][499] and reshaped ticketing models.[500] Various sources deem Swift's music a paradigm representing the millennial generation;[501] Vox called her the \"millennial Bruce Springsteen\",[502] and The Times named her \"the Bob Dylan of our age\".[503] Swift earned the title Woman of the Decade (2010s) from Billboard,[504] Artist of the Decade (2010s) at the American Music Awards,[505] and Global Icon at the Brit Awards for her impact.[408] Senior artists such as Madonna,[506] Stevie Nicks,[507] Jon Bon Jovi,[508] Dolly Parton,[509] and Elton John have praised her musicianship.[510] Carole King regards Swift as her \"professional granddaughter\" and thanked Swift for \"carrying the torch forward\".[511] Springsteen called her a \"tremendous\" writer,[512] while Elvis Costello compared Swift's songwriting to that of Bob Dylan,[513] and Billy Joel considered Swift the Beatles' successor.[514] Britney Spears labeled Swift \"the most iconic pop woman of our generation\".[515] Media outlets describe Swift as a savvy businesswoman;[516][517] in 2024, she topped Billboard's annual Power 100 ranking of the top music industry executives.[518] Swift is known for her traditional album rollouts, consisting of a variety of promotional activities that Rolling Stone termed as an inescapable \"multimedia bonanza\".[519][520] Easter eggs and cryptic teasers became a common practice in contemporary pop music because of Swift.[521] Publications describe her discography as a music \"universe\" subject to analysis by fans, critics, and journalists.[522][523][524] Swift maintains an active presence on social media and a close relationship with fans, to which many journalists attribute her success.[525][455][526] Her in-house management team is called 13 Management.[527] Swift has endorsed many brands and businesses, having launched clothing lines with L.E.I. and Stella McCartney,[528][529] designed American

for the National Hockey League's Nashville Predators and Sony Cyber-shot digital cameras,[535][536] and became the global ambassador for New York City in 2014 and Record Store Day in 2022.[537][538] Swift identifies as a pro-choice feminist,[539] and is a founding signatory of the Time's Up movement against sexual harassment.[540] Specifically, she criticized the US Supreme Court's decision to end federal abortion rights in 2022.[541] Swift also advocates for LGBT rights,[542] and has called for the passing of the Equality Act, which prohibits discrimination based on sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity.[543][544] She performed during WorldPride NYC 2019 at the Stonewall Inn, a gay rights monument, and has donated to the LGBT organizations Tennessee Equality Project and GLAAD.[545][546][547] A supporter of the March for Our Lives movement and gun control reform in the US,[548] Swift is a vocal critic of white supremacy, racism, and police brutality.[321][539] Following the George Floyd protests, she donated to the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund and the Black Lives Matter movement,[549] called for the removal of Confederate monuments in Tennessee,[550] and advocated for Juneteenth to become a national holiday.[551] She has openly criticized former president Donald Trump.[552] In 2020, Swift urged her fans to check their voter registration ahead of elections, which resulted in 65,000 people registering to vote within one day of her post,[553] and endorsed Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in the 2020 US presidential election.[554] For the 2024 election, she endorsed Harris and Tim Walz.[555][556] Swift became a billionaire in October 2023, becoming the world's first musician to achieve the status \"solely based on her songs and performances\".[557][558] Forbes has estimated her net worth at $1.6 billion as of October 2024,[450] making her the richest female musician in the world.[559] Forbes had named her the annual top-earning female musician in 2016, 2019, 2021, and 2022.[560] She was the highest-paid celebrity of 2016 with $170 million—a feat recognized by Guinness World Records as the highest annual earnings ever for a female musician,[561] which she herself surpassed with $185 million in 2019.[562] Overall, Swift was listed as the Forbes highest-paid female artist of the 2010s, earning

Today she's the most recognizable country-- or formerly country? or pop?-- artist in North America, if not the world: her songwriting takes in half a dozen genres, and her economic impact changes cities. We will move through Swift's own catalogue, including hits, deep cuts, outtakes, re-recordings, considering songwriting as its own art, distinct from poems recited or silently read. We will learn how to study fan culture, celebrity culture, adolescence, adulthood and appropriation; how to think about white texts, Southern texts, transatlantic texts, and queer subtexts. We will learn how to think about illicit affairs, and hoaxes, champagne problems and incomplete closure. We will look at her precursors, from Dolly Parton to the Border Ballads, and at work about her (such as the documentary \"Miss Americana\"). And we will read literary works important to her and works about song and performance, with novels, memoirs and poems by (among others) Willa Cather, James Weldon Johnson, Tracey Thorn, and William Wordsworth.

                "content": "Luka Dončić (/ˈluːkə ˈdɒntʃɪtʃ/ LOO-kə DON-chitch;[1] Slovene: [ˈlùːka ˈdòːntʃitʃ]; born February 28, 1999) is a Slovenian professional basketball player for the Dallas Mavericks of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Nicknamed \"Luka Magic\",[2] he also plays for the Slovenia national team and is regarded as one of the greatest European players of all time.[3][4][5][6][7][8] Born in Ljubljana, Dončić shone as a youth player for Union Olimpija before joining the youth academy of Real Madrid. In 2015, he made his debut for the academy's senior team at age 16, becoming the youngest in club history. He made his senior debut for Slovenia in 2016 at only 17 years of age. He later helped his country win its first EuroBasket title, in 2017, while also being named to the All-Tournament Team. Dončić led Madrid to the 2018 EuroLeague title, winning the EuroLeague MVP and the Final Four MVP. He was named the ACB Most Valuable Player and won back-to-back EuroLeague Rising Star and ACB Best Young Player awards. Dončić was also selected to the EuroLeague 2010–20 All-Decade Team.[9] In 2018, Dončić declared for the NBA draft, where he was drafted third overall by the Atlanta Hawks and then traded to the Dallas Mavericks.[note 1] Dončić was unanimously selected to the NBA All-Rookie First Team and won Rookie of the Year for the 2018–19 season. Since his rookie season, Dončić has been selected to five consecutive NBA All-Star games and five All-NBA First Team selections. He led the NBA in scoring during the 2023–24 season, becoming the first European to lead the NBA in scoring and second international player to achieve the feat. That season, he led the Mavericks to their third NBA Finals appearance. Dončić is also the Mavericks' franchise leader in career triple-doubles,[12] and holds the record for most points in a Mavericks season.[13] Dončić was born in Ljubljana to Mirjam Poterbin [sl], an owner of beauty salons,[14] and Saša Dončić, a basketball coach and former player.[15][16] His mother is Slovenian, and his father is a Slovenian of Serbian descent from Kosovo.[17][18][19] His parents filed for divorce in 2008, with custody and legal guardianship granted to his mother.[16][20] According to his family, Dončić first touched a basketball when he was seven months old and frequently played with a miniature hoop in his room by age one.[15][21] Dončić played various sports in his childhood, including football, which he later quit after growing too tall.[22] At age seven, Dončić began playing organized basketball at a primary school in Ljubljana.[21][23] His opponents at the time were up to 10 years old, as Dončić reflected: \"I was always training and playing with older kids who had much more experience than me. Many of them were bigger and faster than me too, so I had to beat them with my brain.\"[23] Dončić admired Greek basketball player Vassilis Spanoulis from his early teenage years, stating that he was \"enchanted\" by him.[24] Dončić wore the number 7 at Real Madrid in honor of Spanoulis.[25] Dončić also grew up admiring American basketball player LeBron James.[26] When Dončić was eight, his father started playing for his hometown club Union Olimpija. Olimpija Basketball School coach Grega Brezovec invited Dončić to practice with players his age.[21][27] Only 16 minutes into his first training session, the coaching staff moved Dončić to the 11-year-old group. Starting in the next session, he primarily practiced with Olimpija's under-14 team. Still, due to league rules, Dončić only played for the club's under-12 selection team, coming off the bench against opponents three or four years older than him.[21][23] Despite his exclusion from under-14 games at the time, Dončić often asked to attend practice, even when his coach asked him to stay home.[21] Representing Olimpija at the under-14 Vasas Intesa Sanpaolo Cup in Budapest in September 2011, Dončić was named the most valuable player (MVP) despite finishing as runners-up to FC Barcelona.[28] In February 2012, he was loaned to Spanish club Real Madrid for the Minicopa Endesa, an under-14 Spanish club competition.[29][30] Dončić averaged 13.0 points, 4.0 rebounds, 2.8 assists, and 3.3 steals per game to win tournament MVP honors, leading Real Madrid to a second-place finish.[30] In April 2012, he participated in the under-13 Lido di Roma Tournament for Olimpija, finishing as MVP and leading scorer with 34.5 points per game.

The decision was made by the Real Madrid board of directors chaired by Florentino Pérez.[93][94] On June 21, 2018, Dončić was selected with the third overall pick by the Atlanta Hawks in the 2018 NBA draft. He was then traded to the Dallas Mavericks in exchange for the draft rights to Trae Young and a protected future first-round pick in 2019.[95][96] After the draft, Mavericks head coach Rick Carlisle said, \"At one point, we thought there might be a slight chance Dončić could fall to us, but a couple of days ago it was pretty clear that there was no way that was going to happen. He's just too good. We get a guy we think is franchise foundation piece.\"[97] Dončić signed his rookie contract with the Mavericks on July 9, 2018.[98] He did not play at the 2018 NBA Summer League due to his late buyout from Real Madrid.[99] Before the 2018–19 season, ESPN considered Dončić the favorite to win the NBA Rookie of the Year award.[100] Dončić made his regular-season debut on October 17, 2018, recording 10 points, eight rebounds, and four assists in a 121–100 loss to the Phoenix Suns.[101] On October 20, Dončić recorded 26 points and 6 rebounds in a 140–136 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves.[102] He became the youngest 20-point scorer in franchise history.[103] On October 29, Dončić posted 31 points and eight rebounds in a 113–108 loss to the San Antonio Spurs for his first 30-point game in the NBA.[104] Three weeks later, Dončić recorded his first NBA double-double, with 15 points and 10 rebounds in a 98–88 loss to the Memphis Grizzlies.[105] He was named NBA Rookie of the Month in the Western Conference for November 2018.[106] On December 8, Dončić scored 21 points in a 107–104 victory over the Houston Rockets.

Mavericks head coach Rick Carlisle refuted some of the worries regarding Dončić's athleticism, stating that \"for a 19-year-old, he's got a really unusual combination of size, speed, and deceptive quickness.\"[301] By his second year, Dončić's ability to accelerate off a pick and blow by defenders to get to the basket is seen as one of his strengths.[302] Given the false characterisation of Dončić's abilities and his subsequent success in the NBA, some speculate that prejudiced stereotyping might have had a role in his negative pre-draft evaluation.[303][304][305] Before his draft, basketball journalist and scout Austin Green compared Dončić to NBA players Paul Pierce and Joe Johnson.[306] Dončić compared himself to Ben Simmons due to his versatility.[307] In his second season, Los Angeles Clippers coach Doc Rivers, when asked about Dončić, stated that \"there's a lot of people in him.\" He likened Dončić's stepback three-pointers to James Harden, his passing ability to Larry Bird, and his court vision to LeBron James.[308] NBA analyst Kendrick Perkins called Dončić \"baby LeBron\" due to his overall skill and dominance on the court.[309] In December 2019, San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich called Dončić's playing style \"Magic Johnson-like\" because \"he sees the floor in that same way.\"[310] In August 2020, head coach Rick Carlisle compared Dončić's playmaking and court vision to Larry Bird and Jason Kidd.[311] Milwaukee Bucks forward Giannis Antetokounmpo called Dončić \"one of the most talented guys I've ever played against.\"[312] During his first career playoff game against the Los Angeles Clippers, TV analyst and former point guard Mark Jackson, reiterated his view of Dončić, calling him \"an absolute combination of Magic Johnson and Larry Bird.\"[313] In January 2024, former basketball player and Dallas Mavericks head coach Jason Kidd stated about Dončić that \"he's better than Dirk [Nowitzki]\" and that \"he's in the atmosphere of [Michael Jordan], the best to ever do it, LeBron [James], Kobe [Bryant]\".[314] In July 2023, Dončić got engaged to his longtime girlfriend Anamaria Goltes.[350] On December 1, 2023, his daughter Gabriela was born.[351][352] Dončić can speak four languages: Slovenian, Serbian, English, and Spanish.[353] He learned Spanish after joining Real Madrid.[354] In 2017, while playing at Real Madrid, Dončić signed a two-year deal with Nike.[355] In December 2019, it was announced that he had signed a multi-year endorsement deal with Air Jordan including a signature shoe, the Jordan Luka 1.[356][357][358] On July 14, 2021, it was announced that Dončić would be the cover athlete for NBA 2K22, the 23rd installment in the NBA 2K video game series.[359] In 2023 he inked a 6 year deal with Jordan, solidifying the continuation of his Jordan Luka line.[358] Dončić's 2018–19 Panini National Treasures basketball card sold for $4.6 million dollars in 2021.[360] Sports journalist Mina Kimes profiled Dončić in April 2018, writing that he is a gamer and enjoys playing Call of Duty, FIFA, and Overwatch.[307][361] Dončić's skill in the latter has been particularly noted, having reached the \"Grandmaster\" tier in competitive play in March 2023,[362] and later becoming a top 500 player in the tank role in Overwatch 2.[363] In 2018, he was noted as playing Genji and Hanzo,[361] and as a tank player, Dončić plays as Zarya.[362]",

You hosted Thanksgiving dinner, baked sugar cookies and even made cute hors d’oeuvres for your friend’s Christmas party. Yep, you’ve spent quite enough time in the kitchen this holiday season, and so you’ve decided it’s time to treat yourself to a day off...preferably on Christmas Day or Christmas Eve. Fear not: This well-deserved act of defiance doesn’t mean you have to go hungry. Whether you’re seeking basic takeout or a cozy spot for dining in with a group, our round up of restaurants open on Christmas 2024 will do you right—provided you call your local chain to confirm days/hours before hanging up your apron, that is. Swing by any Village Inn location during their regular business hours on Christmas Eve for a casual dining experience, or perhaps just to scoop up one of their famous pies. (You know, in case you fell short of star baker status this year.) The restaurant chain will also be open until 4pm on Christmas Day so families can enjoy some good eats when the gift opening mayhem has passed. There’s nothing better than a short stack with a side of bacon after a whirlwind Christmas morning, especially when you don’t have to make it yourself, which is why I recommend you hop on over to your nearest International House of Pancakes. This popular breakfast chain will be open both on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, albeit with limited hours at certain locations. It’s also a fun place to go after a day full of Christmas crafts with the kids. Treat everyone to a stack of pancakes and some hot cocoa to reward their creativity and round out the festive fun! You can’t count on all the restaurants in this franchise to be open on Christmas, but a good number of them are. To be safe, check the holiday hours of your local Mickey D’s before you hit up the drive-thru for your fast-food fix. Your local Applebee’s will most likely be happy to take Christmas Eve cooking duties off your plate. Yep, all branches will be open and serving their typical family-friendly fare on the holiday, though some will have reduced hours. As for Christmas Day, call before you go as some locations will be closed, while others will be keeping regular hours.

Here’s another fast-food joint that’s usually open on Christmas Eve and typically stays open on Christmas, too. Still, you’ll want to check the holiday hours of the franchise near you before heading out for burgers and fries at Sonic. If you’re craving a juicy piece of steak served on a platter of sizzling butter this Christmas, you’re in luck. Most Ruth’s Chris locations will be open on both Christmas Eve and Christmas Day—just be sure to call before you go, as hours vary by location. This year, hang up the apron strings and head out to Morton’s Steakhouse on either Christmas Eve or Christmas Day, though specific holiday hours will be available on the website after Thanksgiving has passed. From seasonal cocktails (try the Blackberry Mojito) to signature steaks, you’re in for a very merry meal (and you’re off the hook for the dishes). Historically, Panda Express tends to be open on both Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. It’s worth noting, though, that all the franchise locations set their own holiday hours, and some may choose not to open at all, so definitely call before you go. You were up until the wee hours wrapping presents and cooking Christmas Day brunch for your fam feels like a big ask. We get it. Fortunately, Waffle house is open 24/7 on Christmas Day (and every day) so you can score some comfort food for your brood the easy way. That’s right, you can count on Denny’s to serve up your favorite diner food all day, every day, Christmas Eve and Christmas Day included. 14. Smith & Wollensky Get in on the premium steaks, fresh seafood and killer wine list at any Smith & Wollensky location across the country on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day—and pretty much every other major holiday, too. This year, all Massachusetts locations will be open Christmas Day (12 pm - 9 pm) and guests can choose from their Prime Rib Experience, Wine & Wagyu pairing menu, or regular menu to celebrate. The Classic S&W Prime Rib Experience invites guests to enjoy an 18 oz. Slow Roasted Prime Rib, with au jus & horseradish cream, house-made popover, roasted potatoes & grilled asparagus. Yum. Enjoy breathtaking views and seriously delicious seafood at Chart House, an upscale restaurant chain with 24 waterfront locations across the country—all of which are open on Christmas Day. If you live out West, Marie Callender’s could save you a load of cooking and clean up. Call up your local chain and confirm its hours, but many are open for take out (not dine in) the week leading up to Christmas. Bonus: If you order in advance, you can even score a ready-made feast or pie to take home for the holiday. Though not open on Christmas Day this year, Chili’s is a beloved nationwide chain that will be serving up its classic all-American fare during regular hours on Christmas Eve, so you can spare yourself the hassle of cooking up a feast at home. 18. Legal Sea Foods Not all locations of this top-notch chain won’t be open on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day for 2024, but you can visit the Harborside, Chestnut Hill, Framingham, Burlington, and Braintree locations during regular hours on both days. Don’t live near those particular restaurants? No problem. You can still treat yourself and all your holiday guests to an amazing seafood spread. Legal Sea Foods has introduced an array of holiday seafood specials for pre-holiday, local pick up. Best of all, the catering platters also ship nationwide, with the goods—generous lobster roll kits, shrimp cocktail, crab cakes and more—arriving frozen, along with all the sauces and fixings, plus easy-to-follow cooking and assembly instructions. (Having sampled the catering platter myself, I can personally attest to the premium quality and intend to avail myself of their seafood selection when I make our yearly holiday paella.) You’ve worked hard this holiday season, which is why it’s perfectly acceptable to phone in a Domino’s delivery order for your Christmas Day dinner. You can even gussy it up with an easy homemade side or two. Do check with your local branch before you go this route, though, as only some locations will be open for business on the 25th. Fleming’s is another excellent option if you want to keep it classy (but don’t feel like cooking) over the holiday. All locations of this acclaimed steakhouse chain will be open on Christmas Eve from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. So your extended family is visiting for the holidays and the thought of cooking for them all is overwhelming. No biggie—just reserve a table at Buca di Beppo on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day for a family-style Italian dinner that will leave everyone satiated. Keep in mind, though, that not all locations will be open on Christmas Day. Alas, this family favorite will be closed on the 25th, so if you’re in the mood for large portions of pasta on Christmas Day, Buca di Beppo is a better bet. However, Olive Garden will be open and serving unlimited breadsticks on Christmas Eve, so you can conceivably bring home enough carbs to feed a whole family until the New Year. Cracker Barrel will be closed on Christmas Day, but don’t let that stop you from feasting on your favorite country-style comfort food—just pre-order one of their heat-and-serve holiday meals and you’re good to go. (Note: You can also dine in at any location before 2 p.m. on Christmas Eve.) Take a trip to Dunkin’ Donuts on Christmas morning and jolt yourself awake with a one-two punch of caffeine and sugar. Most, if not all, locations will be open, but store hours vary so pick up the phone before you head out for a fresh dozen. Don’t just go to some snoozy restaurant over the holidays. Instead, make a day (or night) of it at Dave & Busters. Stop by this popular chain for holiday drinks, games and good eats on Christmas Eve (but not Christmas Day). The holidays can really sap your energy, so it’s only natural to crave an extra hit of caffeine to get by. Luckily, Starbucks will have their doors open on both Christmas Eve and Christmas Day to provide this very service—just keep in mind that holiday hours vary by location. Attention Tex-Mex fiends: Del Taco (not Taco Bell) will be answering your prayers with open doors this Christmas Eve, though hours vary by location. Skip the Feast of the Seven Fishes (because do you really want to prepare seven courses?) and hit up this fast-food joint if you’re feeling famished—you won’t even have to pick a team in the great tacos vs. burgers debate. We’ll take three frozen custards to go, please. Though not open on Christmas Day, some Shake Shack locations are still flipping burgers on Christmas Eve, so you might as well head out for a Christmas Cookie Shake before ‘tis no longer the season. Christmas Eve dinner is served at your local Carrabba’s Italian Grill, though Christmas Eve hours vary by location. Still, what better refuge from the chilly winter wind than a towering plate of pasta? The Short Rib Marsala and Cannoli Cake aren’t too bad, either. Start your Christmas Eve with an apple martini and don’t look back. It will make all that last minute wrapping more fun—just be sure to check in with your nearest location before you go, since hours vary. Hours vary by location, but many are open on both Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. Plus, it doesn’t hurt to give your local Perkins Restaurant and Bakery a call, especially when one of their decadent desserts is up for grabs. No one said turkey or ham and stuffing were the rules of Christmas Day, so why not spice things up with a generous plate of fajitas, nachos and enchiladas? This Tex-Mex chain is open on both Christmas Eve and Christmas Day for folks craving a nontraditional feast that delivers plenty of flavor. Macaroni Grill has you covered on Christmas Day (open 11 a.m. to 8 p.m.) and Christmas Eve (11 a.m. to 10 p.m). Their full menu will be available, so load up on all the pasta—but don’t forget dessert. ‘Tis the season for peace, love…and crab. You may not live near the beach, but Joe’s Crab Shack can bring you decently close on Christmas Eve between the hours of 11 a.m. and 9 p.m., or Christmas day from 3 p.m. to 9 p.m. Tuck into a three-course Christmas dinner at Black Bear Diner with a choice of turkey, ham and prime rib. You can also order to-go and have a ready Christmas meal at your own table. There is literally never a bad time for onion rings and French fries. Pop on in for your fix on Christmas Eve, and don’t forget a burger while you’re at it. It’s all gravy, baby. At least that’s what they say at Luby’s. The Texas cafeteria chain has locations throughout the state dishing up Christmas catering specials and some restaurants will be open on Christmas Eve, too. 38. Hard Rock Cafe Swap the Christmas carols for some rock and roll; the iconic restaurant chain Hard Rock Cafe has a motto of “love all, serve all. 365 days a year” and thus will be open on both Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. Tuck into the special holiday offerings or check out their recent collaboration with soccer superstar Lionel Messi, which has yielded a seriously delicious chicken sandwich and an excellent kids menu to boot. Then, wash it all down with a festive cocktail and enjoy the family-friendly atmosphere and decidedly refreshing soundtrack. 39. KFC If you’re craving some Southern comfort this holiday season, you will be pleased to know that all KFC locations are operating during regular hours on Christmas Eve. Locations will be closed on Christmas Day, but don’t let that stop you from going to town on a fried chicken feast the night before, complete with all the tasty sides, of course. 40. Burger King Good ol’ BK is among the several fast food restaurants that will be open on Christmas in 2024. Indeed, the joint will be grilling up fresh patties during regular hours on Christmas Eve. Some locations will also be open with reduced hours on Christmas Day, but it’s best to call before you go out of your way for your fast food fix. Still, it’s handy information to have—particularly if you’re traveling by car for the holidays and are looking for a quick drive-thru meal. 41. TGI Friday’s Christmas Eve might not fall on a Friday this year, but that’s not a reason to pass on a filling meal at the family-favorite restaurant chain TGI Friday’s, which will be open during regular hours at all locations on Tuesday, December 24. 20 Grocery Stores Open on Thanksgiving",

                "content": "The Houston Texans are a professional American football team based in Houston. The Texans compete in the National Football League as a member of the American Football Conference (AFC) South division. The team plays its home games at NRG Stadium. The Texans were founded in 1999, and were owned by Bob McNair until his death in 2018; following McNair's death, the majority ownership of the team went to his wife, Janice. The McNairs' son, Cal, became operating head of the franchise upon his father's death, and became principal owner when his mother transferred ownership to him in 2024.[7] The team replaced the city's previous NFL franchise, the Houston Oilers, who played from 1960 to 1996 before moving to Nashville and eventually becoming the Tennessee Titans. The Texans began play as an expansion team in 2002, making them the youngest franchise currently competing in the NFL.[8] While the Texans mainly struggled in the 2000s, their fortunes would take a turn for the better in the 2010s when they won their first division championship in 2011, clinching their first playoff berth.[9][10] The Texans have gone on to win seven more AFC South division championships in 2012, 2015, 2016, 2018, 2019, 2023, and 2024. They are the only franchise to have never won a road playoff game along with the only one to have never appeared in a conference championship game; they are also one of four franchises to have never appeared in a Super Bowl,[11] alongside the Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions, and division rival Jacksonville Jaguars. According to an article by Forbes, the Houston Texans are the eleventh richest team in the NFL with a value of $4.7 billion in August 2022.[12] After the Texas Rangers won the 2023 World Series, the Houston Texans became the only big four professional sports franchise currently based in Texas without a championship. In 1997, Houston entrepreneur Bob McNair had a failed bid to bring a National Hockey League (NHL) expansion team to the city, and Bud Adams relocated the city's NFL team, the Houston Oilers, to Nashville, Tennessee, where they were renamed the Tennessee Titans in 1999. In 1996, the Cleveland Browns had controversially relocated to become the Baltimore Ravens. As part of the settlement between the NFL, the city of Cleveland, and the team owned by Art Modell, the league promised to return football to Cleveland within the next three years. In order to even out the franchises to 32, the NFL contemplated adding another expansion franchise. As Houston was one of the favorites for the extra franchise, along with Toronto and Los Angeles (the latter of whom had lost the Rams and the Raiders in 1995), McNair then decided to join the football project and founded Houston NFL Holdings with partner Steve Patterson. With Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, they would push for a domed stadium as part of the bid to lure the NFL back to Houston. On October 6, 1999, the NFL awarded the 32nd team to Houston at a cost of $700 million.[1] The Houston Texans joined the NFL in the 2002 season, playing at the newly opened Reliant Stadium under head coach Dom Capers.[13] With their opening game victory over the Dallas Cowboys on September 8, 2002, the Texans became the first expansion team to win its opening game since the Minnesota Vikings beat the Chicago Bears in 1961.[14] The Texans went 4–12 and finished last in the AFC South in their debut season.[15] The team improved to a 5–11 mark in the 2003 season.[16] The team continued to make progress with a 7–9 record in the 2004 season.[17] In the 2005 season, the Texans fell to a 2–14 record for the worst mark in the league.[18] Following the end of the season, the team fired Capers as head coach.[19] They earned the top pick in the 2006 NFL Draft.[20] While the team struggled in its early seasons, results began to improve when native Houstonian Gary Kubiak became the head coach in 2006.[21] The Texans finished with a .500 season (8–8) in 2007 and 2008, and nearly qualified for the 2009–10 playoffs with a 9–7 result in 2009. The Texans started the 2010 season on a 4–2 record going into a Week 7 bye week, but promptly collapsed 2–8 in the second half of the season, finishing 6–10. In the 2011 NFL draft, the Texans acquired Wisconsin star defensive end J. J. Watt 11th overall. The following season, former Cowboys head coach Wade Phillips was hired as the defensive coordinator for the Texans, and the improved defense led to them finishing 10–6, winning their first AFC South title.[22] The Texans then beat wild card Cincinnati Bengals 31–10 in the first round of the 2011–12 playoffs,[23] before a 20–13 defeat by the Ravens in the Divisional Round.[24] The Texans surged as the team to beat in the AFC South in 2012, starting 5–0 and holding an 11–1 record by week 14. However, they lost three of their last four games to finish 12–4; beating the rival Indianapolis Colts in that four-game stretch allowing them to clinch their 2nd AFC South title. The Texans beat the Bengals again in the wild-card round,[25] but they lost in the Divisional Round to the New England Patriots.[26] In the 2013 NFL draft, the Texans acquired Clemson wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins 27th overall.[27] In 2013, the Texans started 2–0 but went into a tailspin and lost every game afterwards.[28] Kubiak was fired as head coach after being swept by the rival Jacksonville Jaguars, who themselves started 0–8.[29] Wade Phillips filled in as head coach, but the Texans' poor form did not change, and they finished 2–14, tying, with 2005, their worst record in franchise history.[30] The 14-game losing streak is the worst in franchise history. The Texans entered the 2014 season with a 14-game losing streak. Former Penn State head coach Bill O'Brien became the Texans' new head coach, and the third in franchise history, during the offseason.[31][32] In 2014, the Texans won three of their first four games, defeating the Redskins in the season opener while ending the losing streak, the Raiders, and the Bills, losing to the New York Giants. They lost three of their next four games, losing to the Dallas Cowboys, the Indianapolis Colts, and the Pittsburgh Steelers, respectively. The Texans went on to finish 9–7 in the 2014 season and barely missed the playoffs.[33] In the 2015 season, they were featured on HBO, on the show \"Hard Knocks\".[34] That year, the Texans started with a 2–5 record. Quarterback Ryan Mallett was released amidst controversy regarding his benching in favor of Brian Hoyer during a loss against the Indianapolis Colts.[35] After a poor start, the Texans finished with a 9–7 record and won their third AFC South title.[36] However, they were shut out by the Kansas City Chiefs in the Wild Card round 30–0, ending their championship hopes for the year.[37] On March 9, 2016, the Texans signed former Denver Broncos quarterback Brock Osweiler to a 4-year, $72 million deal.[38] Despite Osweiler's lucrative deal, he struggled significantly during the 2016 season. After throwing two interceptions in Week 15 against the Jaguars, coach Bill O'Brien benched the offseason acquisition in favor of backup quarterback Tom Savage. Savage led a comeback effort against the Jaguars, and was named the starter for the remainder of the season. The Texans clinched their fourth AFC South division title in six years in Savage's first career start against the Bengals in Week 16. They defeated the wildcard Oakland Raiders 27–14 in the opening round of the playoffs with Osweiler as the starting quarterback due to Savage being out with a concussion.[39] Osweiler started in the Divisional Playoffs game against the New England Patriots, throwing three interceptions in the second half. The Texans lost 34–16.[40] In the 2017 NFL draft, the Texans traded up to the 12th overall selection to select Clemson star quarterback Deshaun Watson.[41] Watson started six games his rookie year, going 3–3 and having arguably the greatest and most decorated rookie season by a quarterback in NFL history, eventually rising up to become the Texans' franchise quarterback. However, his success would come up very short, following a Week 8 41–38 loss to the Seattle Seahawks, Watson tore his ACL in practice and was ruled out the remainder of the season, which caused the Texans to have one of their worst seasons.[42] Plagued by a series of unexpected injuries (including a second consecutive season-ending injury to J. J. Watt) and controversy involving the team's suspected violation of the league's concussion protocol, after backup quarterback Tom Savage suffered a seizure following a Week 14 game against the San Francisco 49ers, the Texans went 1–9 the rest of the season and eventually finish 4–12 and last in the AFC South in 2017, missing the playoffs for the first time since 2014 and giving Bill O'Brien his first losing season as Texans head coach.[43] In 2018, the Texans started the season 0–3, losing by a combined 15 points to the New England Patriots, Tennessee Titans, and New York Giants, before winning a 37–34 overtime shootout on the road in Indianapolis. This win sparked a nine-game winning streak for the Texans, their first since starting 5–0 in 2012, which included a Week 8 win against the Miami Dolphins that included five touchdown passes from Deshaun Watson.[44] This streak was the longest ever for a team that started the season 0–3; the previous record was a seven-game win-streak set by the New York Giants in 1918 after starting out 0–3.[45] On November 23, 2018, the owner of the Houston Texans, Bob McNair, died from skin cancer.[46] On November 26, 2018, McNair's wife, Janice McNair, became the principal owner and Senior Chair of the Houston Texans, while their son, D. Cal McNair, became the chairman and Chief Operating Officer.[47] The Texans finished the season 11–5, and won another AFC South division championship under Bill O'Brien.[48] They lost 21–7 in the first round of the playoffs to their AFC South division rival Indianapolis Colts.[49] In 2019, the Texans won the AFC South division championship and qualified for the NFL playoffs on the back of a 10–6 record.[50] They went on to defeat the Buffalo Bills by a score of 22–19 in overtime in the AFC wild-card round.[51] However, the Texans' 2019 season came to an end the following week, as they lost to the eventual Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs by a score of 51–31 in the AFC divisional round.[52] The Texans had a 24–0 lead in the game before the Chiefs came back.[53] On March 22, 2020, the Texans traded away all-pro wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins and a fourth-round pick in the 2020 NFL draft to the Arizona Cardinals. In return, Houston received running back David Johnson, a 2020 second-round pick, and a 2021 fourth-round pick.[54] The move was confusing and controversial among fans and sportswriters alike, as many claimed that the Texans should have received more valuable assets for Hopkins, who was among the best receivers in the NFL.[55] The Texans began the 2020 NFL season with a record of 0–4, and Bill O'Brien was consequentially fired following a disappointing loss to the Minnesota Vikings in Week 4. Romeo Crennel, who was the head coach of the Cleveland Browns from 2005 to 2008 and of the Kansas City Chiefs in 2011–12,[56] was named the interim head coach for the remainder of the season.[57] Crennel managed to win more than half of his first 7 games as Houston's head coach, giving Houston a record of 4–7. However, the Texans ended the season on a five-game losing streak.[58] With a final record of 4–12, the Texans were unable to make the playoffs.[59] On January 27, 2021, the Texans hired David Culley as the team's head coach.[60] Culley most recently worked as the Baltimore Ravens assistant head coach, wide receivers coach and passing game coordinator. On February 12, 2021, the Texans released all-pro defensive end J.J. Watt. It was confirmed that Watt personally requested owner Cal McNair for his release.[61] On January 13, 2022, the Texans fired David Culley after posting a 4–13 record[62] as the team's head coach and promoted defensive coordinator Lovie Smith as the team's fifth head coach on February 7, 2022.[63] The team traded away their starting quarterback Deshaun Watson to the Cleveland Browns and a 2024 fifth round pick for three 1st round picks, a 3rd round pick and a 4th round pick on March 20, 2022, due to sexual misconduct lawsuits toward Watson.[64] The Texans opened their 2022 season in a tie game against the Indianapolis Colts, the franchise's first tie in their 20-year existence.[65][66] On January 9, 2023, the Texans announced that they were going in a different direction by firing Lovie Smith after a 3–13–1 season.[67] On January 31, 2023, the Texans hired former player and 49ers defensive coordinator DeMeco Ryans as their new head coach, making him the sixth head coach in franchise history.[68] In the 2023 NFL draft the Texans selected Ohio State quarterback C. J. Stroud and traded up to the third pick to select Defensive End Will Anderson Jr..[69] Under Ryans and Stroud, the team saw improved fortunes as they made the playoffs while winning the AFC South for the first time since the 2019 season with a 10–7 record, becoming the first NFL team to win their division under a rookie head coach and quarterback.[70] The team defeated the Cleveland Browns 45–14 in the Wild Card Round.[71] The Texans saw their season end in the Divisional Round with a 34–10 loss to the Baltimore Ravens.[72] Stroud would later be named NFL offensive Rookie of the Year, and Anderson Jr. would be named NFL defensive Rookie of the Year Award.[73][74] Ryans also finished in a tie in total votes for NFL Coach of the Year with Browns head coach Kevin Stefanski though he lost the award in a tiebreaker due to having one less first place vote.[75] The Texans are the youngest expansion team in the NFL, having only been competing in the NFL for 23 seasons since 2002 and have had limited regular season and postseason success. For that reason, they have not had the history or the reputation on which to build classic rivalries like the ones that often exist between older franchises. Despite this, the team has developed some rivalries. Its natural rivals are its fellow AFC South teams, which are the Tennessee Titans, Jacksonville Jaguars, and Indianapolis Colts.[76][77][78] The Tennessee Titans, who were formerly the Houston Oilers before their relocation in 1996, are viewed by many Houston fans as the Texans' chief rival as members of the AFC South ever since the early 2000s.[79][80] As of the 2023 season, the Titans lead the all-time series 23–21.[81] Ever since the early 2000s, the Texans also have an AFC South Division rivalry with the Indianapolis Colts, whom the Texans had not defeated until the 2006 season.[82] The first time that the Texans would sweep the Colts was in the 2016 NFL season.[83] More recently, Houston has increased bitterness with the Indianapolis Colts due to their young Houston-native quarterback Andrew Luck having been drafted by the Colts in 2012 and the franchise's first ever sweep of the Colts against Luck in 2016. In 2018 the two teams met in the AFC Wild Card Playoffs, with the Colts winning 21–7.[84][85][86][87] Having begun play in 1995 and 2002, respectively, the Jaguars and Texans are among two of the most-recently established franchises in the NFL. The Jaguars relocated from the AFC Central to the newly created AFC South where the Texans were placed into and have competed as division rivals since. The Jaguars are the only division rival the Texans have a winning record against as the Texans lead the series 29–15.[88] The Texans also have an intrastate/interconference rivalry with the Dallas Cowboys, with whom they contest the so-called Governor's Cup every year (a tradition started between the cities prior to the Oilers relocating) either in the preseason or the regular season for bragging rights in the state of Texas. In 2017, the destruction and flooding caused during Hurricane Harvey a few days before their Week 4 pre-season match up time scheduled caused the game to be relocated to AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. However, out of concern for the safety of the fans and the condition of the player's families & communities, the game was canceled.[89] As of the 2024 season, the Cowboys lead the all-time series 4–3.[90] The Texans are the newest team in the league, but they have been embraced by a fair amount of celebrities since joining the NFL in 2002. The team has also adopted a number of former Houston Oilers fans in search of a new home team. Despite the lacking playoff success, there have been a present amount of loyal fans and even various celebrities such as Ryan Trahan, George Foreman, Paul Wall, Rico Rodriguez, and Raini Rodriguez who have been strong supporters of the team.[91][92][93] During the 2010s, the team adopted the moniker \"Bulls on Parade\" in honor of the Rage Against the Machine song, regularly used prior to the team's introduction before entering the field.[94] In the process of naming the new franchise leadership conducted an extensive review and research process; the final list of names was determined after several months of research conducted jointly by Houston NFL 2002 and NFL Properties. This included an online survey asking fans and the community to weigh in which received more than 65,000 responses in one week. On March 2, 2000, it was announced that the team name search had been narrowed down to five choices: Apollos, Bobcats, Stallions, Texans, and Wildcatters.[95] On September 6, 2000, the NFL's 32nd franchise was officially christened the Houston Texans before thousands at a downtown rally in Houston. McNair explained that the name and logo were chosen to \"embody the pride, strength, independence and achievement that make the people of Houston and our area special.\"[96][97] The name \"Texans\" had been used by several now-defunct football teams, including the Canadian Football League franchise in San Antonio; the World Football League franchise in Houston, which moved to Louisiana to become the Shreveport Steamer; the Dallas Texans of the NFL which played in only the 1952 season; and by the precursor of the present-day Kansas City Chiefs, when they were the second incarnation of the Dallas Texans in the American Football League (AFL). Owner Bob McNair received permission from Chiefs' owner Lamar Hunt to use the Texans name for his new team.[22] It is also a subtle homage to the naming style of the NHL team the Montreal Canadiens who also named their team after their respective demonym.[22] Along with the team name, McNair unveiled the team logo, an abstract depiction of a bull's head, split in such a way to resemble the flag of Texas and the state of Texas, including a lone star to stand for the eye, the five points of which representing pride, courage, strength, tradition and independence. McNair described the colors as \"Deep Steel Blue\", \"Battle Red\" and \"Liberty White\".[96] A year later the Texans unveiled their uniforms during another downtown rally.[98] The Texans' helmet is dark blue with the Texans bull logo. The helmet was initially white when the team name and logo were unveiled, but was later changed to dark blue. The uniform design consists of red trim and either dark blue or white jerseys. The team typically wears white pants with its blue jerseys and blue pants with its white jerseys. Starting with the 2006 season, the Texans wore all-white for their home opener, and the team began to wear an all-blue combination for home games vs. the Indianapolis Colts. In 2003, the Texans introduced an alternative red jersey with blue trim; they wear this jersey at one home game each year, usually against a division rival. In 2007, the Texans introduced red pants for the first time, pairing them with the red jerseys for an all-red look. They would wear this look until 2010, but was brought back in 2023. In October 2008 the Texans paired blue socks (instead of the traditional red) with their blue pants and white jerseys, eventually becoming the team's primary road uniform combination. In 2016, the Texans unveiled a new uniform combo against the Jacksonville Jaguars, pairing the red jersey with blue pants and red socks. In 2017, the Texans unveiled a Color Rush uniform, using an all-blue uniform but with minimal white elements. In 2021, the Texans began sporting all-white socks on select home and road games. In 2022, the Texans began using a red alternate helmet with the red uniform. In 2023, the red alternate helmet was worn with the Color Rush uniform in a 21–16 victory against the Arizona Cardinals.[99] In 2002, the team wore a patch commemorating their inaugural season. Also, they celebrated 10 years as a franchise by wearing an anniversary patch throughout 2012. From 2018 to 2019, the Texans wore a memorial patch to honor Bob McNair after his death.[100] In April 2024, the Texans unveiled redesigned uniforms. The primary dark blue helmets remained, but the home blue uniforms were updated to include the Texans primary crest on the sleeve and new collar stripes, while the road white uniform featured blue and red horn stripes on the sleeves, along with blue numbers with red trim. The white uniform's design also served as the basis for the red alternate uniform, which is paired with a red helmet containing the blue horn stripes. A second alternate uniform is a navy blue base with \"H-Town blue\" accents; numbers are red with \"H-Town blue\" trim. This set is paired with a navy blue alternate helmet containing the \"H-Star\" decal in \"H-Town blue\" with red trim. The inclusion of a second alternate helmet is due to the NFL allowing teams with new uniforms to unveil these helmets in advance this season.[101] Running backs (RB) Wide receivers (WR) Tight ends (TE) Defensive linemen (DL) Defensive backs (DB) Special teams Reserve 52 active, 14 reserve, 15 practice squad (+1 exempt) The Texans have had the top-overall pick in the NFL Draft three times.[102] On November 19, 2017, Andre Johnson was the first-ever inductee into the Texans Ring of Honor.[103] On October 6, 2019, Bob McNair was posthumously the second inductee into the Texans Ring of Honor.[104] On October 1, 2023, J. J. Watt was the third inductee into the Texans Ring of Honor.[105] Only two members of the Pro Football Hall of Fame have spent any portion of their career with Texans, due in part to the requirements to be inducted and the Texans only having been established in 2002. In 2024, Andre Johnson became the first player to be inducted into the Hall of Fame primarily for his time with the Texans.[106] → Coaching staff → Front office → More NFL staffs The Texans have had six full-time head coaches in their franchise history. The team has had two interim head coaches.[108] The team's official mascot is Toro, an anthropomorphic blue bull.[111] The team also has a cheerleading squad simply named the Houston Texans Cheerleaders.[112] Community outreach by the Houston Texans is primarily operated by the Houston Texans Foundation, who works with multiple community partners.[113] The Houston Texans organization is also a supporter of the character education program, Heart of a Champion.[114] In 2017, the 15th annual Houston Texans Charity Golf Classic raised more than $380,000 for the Foundation. More than $27.2 million has been raised for the Foundation since its creation in 2002.[115] Former Texans DE J. J. Watt raised $41.6 million in relief funds for Hurricane Harvey after the storm devastated the city in 2017.[116] Watt ended up winning the Walter Payton Man of the Year Award that season.[117] As of 2023[update], the Texans' flagship radio stations were KILT SportsRadio 610AM and KILT 100.3FM.[118] The AM station has an all-sports format, while the FM station plays contemporary country music. Both are owned by Audacy. Marc Vandermeer is the play-by-play announcer.[119] Heisman Trophy winner Andre Ware provides color commentary, and SportsRadio 610 host Rich Lord serves as the sideline reporter.[120][121] Preseason and regular season Monday night games from ESPN are telecast by KTRK, an ABC owned and operated station. Kevin Kugler calls the preseason games on TV, with former Texans defensive end N. D. Kalu providing color commentary.[122] Regular season games are aired over CBS affiliate KHOU, Fox affiliate KRIV if the Texans host an NFC team, and NBC affiliate KPRC for Sunday night games. Spanish-language radio broadcasts of the team's games are aired on KGOL ESPN Deportes 1180AM.[123] Enrique Vásquez is the play-by-play announcer. José Jojo Padrón provides color commentary,[124] and Fernando Hernández serves as sideline reporter.

                "content": "Travis Michael Kelce (/ˈkɛlsi/ ⓘ KEL-see;[a] born October 5, 1989) is an American professional football tight end for the Kansas City Chiefs of the National Football League (NFL). He was selected by the Chiefs in the third round of the 2013 NFL draft and later won Super Bowls LIV, LVII, and LVIII with the team. He played college football for the University of Cincinnati Bearcats football program. Considered one of the greatest tight ends of all time,[11][12] Kelce is a nine-time Pro Bowler and a seven-time All-Pro, with four first-team and three second-team selections. He holds the NFL records for most consecutive and most overall seasons with 1,000 receiving yards by a tight end: seven.[4] He holds the record for most receiving yards by a tight end in a single season with 1,416 in 2020, despite playing in only 15 games.[5][13] During the 2022 season, Kelce became the fifth NFL tight end to reach 10,000 career receiving yards and reached the milestone faster than any tight end in NFL history.[4] Kelce was named to the NFL 2010s All-Decade Team.[14][15] During the 2023 season, he surpassed Jerry Rice in career playoff receptions en route to Super Bowl LVIII, his fourth Super Bowl appearance in five seasons. Outside of football, Kelce has appeared on reality and scripted television, including being the namesake of the dating show Catching Kelce on E!, hosting the March 5, 2023, episode of Saturday Night Live, and in advertisements. He co-hosts the podcast New Heights with his brother Jason, covering topics from football to popular culture. The show was ranked as the 8th most popular show in the US on Apple Podcasts in 2024.[16] Kelce's relationship with singer-songwriter Taylor Swift has drawn massive media coverage and stimulated viewership and revenue for his team and its league. Kelce was born on October 5, 1989, in Westlake, Ohio. His father, Ed Kelce, is a former sales representative in the steel industry, and his mother, Donna, is a former bank executive. Kelce's older brother Jason played center for the Philadelphia Eagles for 13 seasons.[17] Kelce attended Cleveland Heights High School in his hometown of Cleveland Heights, Ohio, where he played football, basketball, and baseball.[18] He was a three-year letter winner as quarterback for the Tigers. As a senior in 2007, he ran for 1,016 yards and 10 touchdowns and threw for 1,523 yards, 21 touchdowns, and eight interceptions. His 2,539 yards of total offense garnered him All-Lake Erie League honors.[19][20] Considered a two-star recruit by Rivals.com, Kelce accepted a scholarship offer from the University of Cincinnati over offers from Akron, Eastern Michigan, and Miami (OH).[21] He joined his brother, Jason Kelce, who was the starting left guard for the Bearcats. After redshirting in 2008, he appeared in 11 games in 2009, playing at tight end and quarterback out of the Wildcat formation. He tallied eight rushes for 47 yards and two touchdowns and had one reception for three yards.[22] He was suspended for the 2010 season after testing positive for marijuana, a violation of team rules.[23][24] Returning for the 2011 season, he played tight end, recording 13 catches totaling 150 yards and two touchdowns.[25] In 2012, his last collegiate season, he set personal season highs in receptions (45), receiving yards (722), yards per receptions (16.0), and receiving touchdowns (8). Kelce earned first-team all-conference honors[26] and in March 2013, was named the College Football Performance Awards Tight End of the Year.[27] Kelce graduated in 2022 with a Bachelor of Interdisciplinary Studies degree,[28] he received his diploma during an April 2024 podcast event at the Fifth Third Arena with his brother Jason.[29] Kelce was selected by the Kansas City Chiefs in the third round (63rd pick overall) of the 2013 NFL draft.[33] The Chiefs had hired Andy Reid as their new head coach during the off-season. Reid was familiar with Kelce, having drafted and coached his brother, Jason Kelce, in 2011 during his time as the head coach of the Eagles.[34][35] On June 6, 2013, the Chiefs signed Kelce to a four-year, $3.12 million rookie contract that also included a signing bonus of $703,304.[36] Kelce injured his knee in the preseason. The injury was later diagnosed as a bone bruise. After being limited the first two weeks of the season due to the injury and being inactive the next three games, Kelce was placed on injured reserve on October 12, 2013, after having a microfracture surgery performed on his knee.[37] He only played one snap, on special teams in the Chiefs' Week 2 game against the Dallas Cowboys.[38] During Week 3 against the Miami Dolphins, Kelce recorded his first NFL touchdown on a 20-yard reception from quarterback Alex Smith.[39] On November 30, he was fined $11,025 for \"unsportsmanlike conduct\" during a 29–16 loss to the Denver Broncos. Kelce made an inappropriate hand gesture and motion at Broncos linebacker Von Miller. Chiefs' head coach Andy Reid later called this \"immature\".[40] In the next game against the Arizona Cardinals, Kelce had seven receptions for 110 yards for his first NFL game with over 100 receiving yards.[41] In the regular-season finale against the San Diego Chargers, he had an offensive fumble recovery for a touchdown in the 19–7 victory.[42] Kelce was the Chiefs' leading receiver during the 2014 season, totaling 862 yards off 67 receptions.[43] Kelce began the 2015 season with his first NFL multiple touchdown game, with six receptions for 106 yards and two touchdowns in the 27–20 victory over the Houston Texans.[44] It was his only 100-plus-yard game, but he had at least one reception in all 16 games,[45] and was ranked a top-five tight end by ESPN.[46] He started all 16 regular season games and recorded 72 catches for 875 yards and five touchdowns, earning his way to his first Pro Bowl.[47][48] The Chiefs finished the regular season with an 11–5 record and made the playoffs.[49] In his first NFL playoff game, Kelce had eight receptions for 128 yards in a 30–0 Wild Card Round victory over the Texans.[50] In the Divisional Round against the New England Patriots, Kelce had six receptions for 23 yards as the Chiefs lost 27–20.[51] He was ranked 91st by his peers on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2016.[52] On January 29, 2016, Kelce signed a five-year, $46 million contract extension.[53] He was ranked 91st by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2016.[52] During Week 8 against the Indianapolis Colts, Kelce had seven receptions for 101 yards and a touchdown.[54] In the next game against the Jacksonville Jaguars, he was ejected after receiving two unsportsmanlike conduct penalties after arguing with two officials over not having a pass interference penalty called.[55] The second resulted from him sarcastically throwing his towel at field judge Mike Weatherford in a flagging motion due to being upset about the first penalty. He was later fined $24,309 for his outburst.[56] During Week 13 against the Atlanta Falcons, he had eight receptions for 140 yards.[57] In the next game, Kelce recorded 101 receiving yards against the Oakland Raiders, his fourth consecutive game topping 100.[58] He joined Jimmy Graham and former Chiefs tight end Tony Gonzalez as the only NFL tight ends ever to do so.[59] In a Christmas Day win over the Broncos, Kelce had career bests of 11 receptions for 160 yards and a career-long 80-yard touchdown on a screen pass.[45] He finished the season with career highs in yards (1,125) and receptions (85).[60] His 1,125 receiving yards led the league among tight ends and his 85 receptions were second among tight ends behind Dennis Pitta of the Baltimore Ravens.

                "content": "Editions: En/nfl/kansas-city-chiefs Missed last two Chiefs road games Despite Taylor Swift's absence from Travis Kelce's last two NFL games, the couple is reportedly doing just fine. Kelce has never expected Swift to be present for every game, and an old interview from 2016 has resurfaced to support this, revealing that he's comfortable with his partner not attending all his matches. In the interview, Kelce was promoting his reality show \"Catching Kelce,\" where he eventually met his ex, Maya Benberry. During the conversation, he shared that while having a supportive partner is important to him, he doesn't expect them to attend every single game, as long as they cheer him on when they do make it to the stands. \"If you're dating a professional athlete, I do not believe, at least for me, that you have to go to all the games,\" Kelce said. \"I mean, there's 8 home games, 8 away games, plus playoffs. I don't even expect my parents and my friends to make every single game.\" This was back when the NFL played a 16-game schedule. Now, there's an added game. \"I need her to cheer when we're doing awesome, just to make sure that that look is being presented to everyone.\" Swift attended Kelce's first two home games of the season in Kansas City but was not present for the Chiefs' recent away games in Atlanta and Los Angeles. Despite her absence, TMZ sources close to the couple confirm that their relationship is still going strong, with no signs of tension over her decision to miss a few matchups. \"If she is going to a place that isn't Arrowhead, there are security concerns,\" a Page Six source said. \"She has worked with Arrowhead so many times, they feel at ease and comfortable. Going to all kinds of different stadiums, you need to send a team in advance.\" © Unidad Editorial Información Deportiva, S.L.U. All rights reserved. Follow us",

Keep in mind, hours and openings vary by location, so you should still confirm with your local restaurant. Caffeine can be a necessity on Christmas morning. To help you fuel up, some Dunkin' stores will be open on their regular hours. But keep in mind, other stores will elect to close on the holidays, so call ahead for Christmas hours. Starbucks is to remain open to serve its festive coffee beverages all throughout the day on Christmas Eve and Christmas day. The specific hours and openings could vary depending on location. According to the company, many Burger King locations will not be fully open on Christmas Day. \"Customers can expect Burger King restaurants to be more accessible on Christmas Eve,\" said the company.

                "content": "Kwanzaa (/ˈkwɑːnzə/) is an annual celebration of African-American culture from December 26 to January 1, culminating in a communal feast called Karamu, usually on the sixth day.[1] It was created by activist Maulana Karenga, based on African harvest festival traditions from various parts of West, East, as well as Southeast Africa. Kwanzaa was first celebrated in 1966. Twenty-first-century estimates place the number of Americans who celebrate Kwanzaa between 500,000 and 2,000,000.[2] American black separatist[3] Maulana Karenga created Kwanzaa in 1966 during the aftermath of the Watts riots[4] as a non-Christian,[5] specifically African-American, holiday.[6] Karenga said his goal was to \"give black people an alternative to the existing holiday of Christmas and give black people an opportunity to celebrate themselves and their history, rather than simply imitate the practice of the dominant society.\"[7] For Karenga, a figure in the Black Power movement of the 1960s and 1970s, the creation of such holidays also underscored the essential premise that \"you must have a cultural revolution before the violent revolution. The cultural revolution gives identity, purpose, and direction.\"[8]: 63–65 According to Karenga, the name Kwanzaa derives from the Swahili phrase matunda ya kwanza, meaning \"first fruits\".[9] First fruits festivals exist in Southern Africa and are celebrated in December/January with the southern solstice. Karenga was partly inspired by an account he read of the Zulu festival Umkhosi Wokweshwama.[8]: 84 It was decided to spell the holiday's name with an additional \"a\" so that it would have a symbolic seven letters.[8]: 228 During the early years of Kwanzaa, Karenga said it was meant to be an alternative to Christmas. He believed Jesus was psychotic and Christianity was a \"White\" religion that Black people should shun.[10] As Kwanzaa gained mainstream adherents, Karenga altered his position so practicing Christians would not be alienated, stating in the 1997 book Kwanzaa: A Celebration of Family, Community, and Culture that \"Kwanzaa was not created to give people an alternative to their own religion or religious holiday.\"[11] Many African Americans who celebrate Kwanzaa do so in addition to observing Christmas.[12] After its creation in California, Kwanzaa spread outside the United States.[13] In December 2022, Reverend Al Sharpton, Mayor Eric Adams, businessman Robert F. Smith, Reverend Conrad Tillard, Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, and Elisha Wiesel joined to celebrate Kwanzaa and Hanukkah together at Carnegie Hall.[14][15][16][17] Kwanzaa celebrates what its founder called the seven principles of Kwanzaa, or Nguzo Saba (originally Nguzu Saba – the seven principles of African Heritage). They were developed in 1965, a year before Kwanzaa itself. These seven principles are all Swahili words, and together comprise the Kawaida or \"common\" philosophy, a synthesis of nationalist, pan-Africanist, and socialist values. Each of the seven days of Kwanzaa is dedicated to one of the principles, as follows:[18] Kwanzaa celebratory symbols include a mat (Mkeka) on which other symbols are placed: Supplemental representations include a Nguzo Saba poster,[21] the black, red, and green bendera (flag), and African books and artworks—all to represent values and concepts reflective of African culture and contribution to community building and reinforcement.[22] Families celebrating Kwanzaa decorate their households with objects of art, colorful African cloth such as kente, especially the wearing of kaftans by women, and fresh fruits that represent African idealism. It is customary to include children in Kwanzaa ceremonies and to give respect and gratitude to ancestors. Libations are shared, generally with a common chalice, Kikombe cha Umoja, passed around to all celebrants. Non-African Americans also celebrate Kwanzaa.[2] \"Joyous Kwanzaa\" may be used as a greeting during the holiday.[24][25][26] A Kwanzaa ceremony may include drumming and musical selections, libations, a reading of the African Pledge and the Principles of Blackness, reflection on the Pan-African colors, a discussion of the African principle of the day or a chapter in African history, a candle-lighting ritual, artistic performance, and, finally, a feast of faith (Karamu Ya Imani).[27][28] The greeting for each day of Kwanzaa is Habari Gani?,[29] which is Swahili for \"How are you?\"[30] At first, observers of Kwanzaa avoided the mixing of the holiday or its symbols, values, and practice with other holidays, as doing so would violate the principle of kujichagulia (self-determination) and thus violate the integrity of the holiday, which is partially intended as a reclamation of important African values. Today, some African American families celebrate Kwanzaa along with Christmas and New Year.[31] Cultural exhibitions include the Spirit of Kwanzaa, an annual celebration held at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts featuring interpretive dance, African dance, song and poetry.[32][33][34] A Karamu Ya Imani (Feast of Faith) is a feast that typically takes place on December 31, the sixth day of the Kwanzaa period. The Karamu feast was developed in Chicago during a 1971 citywide movement of Pan-African organizations. It was proposed by Hannibal Afrik of Shule ya Watoto as a communitywide promotional and educational campaign. The initial Karamu Ya Imani occurred on January 1, 1973, at a 200-person gathering at the Ridgeland club.[35] In 1992, the National Black United Front of Chicago held one of the largest Karamu Ya Imani celebrations in the country. It included dancing, a youth ensemble and a keynote speech by NBUF and prominent black nationalist leader Conrad Worrill.[36] The celebration includes the following practices: The popularity of celebration of Kwanzaa has declined with the waning of the popularity of the black separatist movement.[37][38][39][40] Kwanzaa observation has declined in both community and commercial contexts.[41][42][43] University of Minnesota Professor Keith Mayes did not report exact figures, noting that it is also difficult to determine these for the three other main African-American holidays, which he names as Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Malcolm X Day, and Juneteenth.[8]: 210, 274 Mayes added that white institutions now also celebrate it.[2] In a 2019 National Retail Federation poll, 2.6 percent of people who planned to celebrate a winter holiday said they would celebrate Kwanzaa.[44]. Roughly 14% of the United States population is African American. Starting in the 1990s, the holiday became increasingly commercialized, with the first Hallmark card being sold in 1992.[45] Some have expressed concern about this potentially damaging the holiday's values.[46] The first Kwanzaa stamp, designed by Synthia Saint James, was issued by the United States Post Office in 1997, and in the same year Bill Clinton gave the first presidential declaration marking the holiday.[47][48] Subsequent presidents George W. Bush,[24] Barack Obama,[49] Donald Trump,[50] and Joe Biden[51] also issued greetings to celebrate Kwanzaa. Maya Angelou narrated a 2008 documentary film about Kwanzaa, The Black Candle, written and directed by M. K. Asante and featuring Chuck D.[52][53] In the Arthur (TV series) special Arthur's Perfect Christmas, Brain's family celebrated Kwanzaa as a family, and added a Kwanzaa Ice Cream Special (red, black, and green ice cream) to their ice cream shop menu. [54] Other countries that celebrate Kwanzaa include Jamaica, France, Canada, and Brazil.[55] In Canada it is celebrated in provinces including Saskatchewan[56] and Ontario. Kwanzaa week was first declared in Toronto in 2018.[57] There are local chapters that emerged in the 2010s in provinces like British Columbia, where there are much smaller groups of the diaspora, founding members may be immigrants from countries like Uganda.[58] (federal) = federal holidays, (abbreviation) = state/territorial holidays, (religious) = religious holidays, (cultural) = holiday related to a specific racial/ethnic group or sexual minority, (week) = week-long holidays, (month) = month-long holidays, (36) = Title 36 Observances and Ceremonies",

During the week of Kwanzaa, families and communities come together to share a feast, to honor the ancestors, affirm the bonds between them, and to celebrate African and African American culture. Each day they light a candle to highlight the principle of that day and to breathe meaning into the principles with various activities, such as reciting the sayings or writings of great black thinkers and writers, reciting original poetry, African drumming, and sharing a meal of African diaspora-inspired foods. The table is decorated with the essential symbols of Kwanzaa, such as the Kinara (Candle Holder), Mkeka (Mat), Muhindi (corn to represent the children), Mazao (fruit to represent the harvest), and Zawadi (gifts). One might also see the colors of the Pan-African flag, red (the struggle), black (the people), and green (the future), represented throughout the space and in the clothing worn by participants. These colors were first proclaimed to be the colors for all people of the African diaspora by Marcus Garvey.

Yonder, out there, they will see it broken and break it again. What you say out of it they will not heed. What you scream from it they do not hear. What you put into it to nourish your body they will snatch away and give you leavins instead. No, they don’t love our mouth. You got to love it. This is flesh I’m talking about here. Flesh that needs to be loved. Feet that need to rest and to dance; backs that need support; shoulders that need arms, strong arms I’m telling you. And o my people, out yonder, hear me, they do not love your neck unnoosed and straight. So love your neck; put a hand on it, grace it, stroke it and hold it up.

                "title": "Kwanzaa ‑ Meaning, Candles & Principles | HISTORY",
                "content": "By: History.com Editors Updated: December 19, 2024 | Original: October 14, 2009 Dr. Maulana Karenga, professor and chairman of Black Studies at California State University, Long Beach, created Kwanzaa in 1966. After the Watts riots in Los Angeles, Dr. Karenga searched for ways to bring African Americans together as a community. He founded US, a cultural organization, and started to research African “first fruit” (harvest) celebrations. Karenga combined aspects of several different harvest celebrations, such as those of the Ashanti and those of the Zulu, to form the basis of the week-long holiday. Kwanzaa 2024 begins on Thursday, December 26, and lasts through Wednesday, January 1, 2024. The name Kwanzaa is derived from the phrase “matunda ya kwanza” which means “first fruits” in Swahili. Each family celebrates Kwanzaa in its own way, but celebrations often include songs and dances, African drums, storytelling, poetry reading, and a large traditional meal. On each of the seven nights, the family gathers and a child lights one of the candles on the Kinara (candleholder), then one of the seven principles is discussed. The principles, called the Nguzo Saba (seven principles in Swahili) are values of African culture which contribute to building and reinforcing community among African-Americans. Kwanzaa also has seven basic symbols which represent values and concepts reflective of African culture. An African feast, called a Karamu, is held on December 31. Did you know? The seven principles, or Nguzo Saba, are a set of ideals created by Dr. Maulana Karenga. Each day of Kwanzaa emphasizes a different principle. The candle-lighting ceremony each evening provides the opportunity to gather and discuss the meaning of Kwanzaa. The first night, the black candle in the center is lit (and the principle of umoja/unity is discussed). One candle is lit each evening and the appropriate principle is discussed. The seven principles, or Nguzo Saba are a set of ideals created by Dr. Maulana Karenga. Each day of Kwanzaa emphasizes a different principle. Unity:Umoja (oo–MO–jah)To strive for and maintain unity in the family, community, nation, and race. Self-determination: Kujichagulia (koo–gee–cha–goo–LEE–yah)To define ourselves, name ourselves, create for ourselves, and speak for ourselves. Collective Work and Responsibility: Ujima (oo–GEE–mah)To build and maintain our community together and make our brother’s and sister’s problems our problems and to solve them together. Cooperative Economics: Ujamaa (oo–JAH–mah)To build and maintain our own stores, shops, and other businesses and to profit from them together. Purpose: Nia (nee–YAH)To make our collective vocation the building and developing of our community in order to restore our people to their traditional greatness. Creativity: Kuumba (koo–OOM–bah)To do always as much as we can, in the way we can, in order to leave our community more beautiful and beneficial than we inherited it. Faith: Imani (ee–MAH–nee)To believe with all our heart in our people, our parents, our teachers, our leaders, and the righteousness and victory of our struggle. Mazao, the crops (fruits, nuts, and vegetables) Symbolizes work and the basis of the holiday. It represents the historical foundation for Kwanzaa, the gathering of the people that is patterned after African harvest festivals in which joy, sharing, unity, and thanksgiving are the fruits of collective planning and work. Since the family is the basic social and economic center of every civilization, the celebration bonded family members, reaffirming their commitment and responsibility to each other. In Africa, the family may have included several generations of two or more nuclear families, as well as distant relatives. Ancient Africans didn’t care how large the family was, but there was only one leader – the oldest male of the strongest group. For this reason, an entire village may have been composed of one family. The family was a limb of a tribe that shared common customs, cultural traditions, and political unity and were supposedly descended from common ancestors. The tribe lived by traditions that provided continuity and identity. Tribal laws often determined the value system, laws, and customs encompassing birth, adolescence, marriage, parenthood, maturity, and death. Through personal sacrifice and hard work, the farmers sowed seeds that brought forth new plant life to feed the people and other animals of the earth. To demonstrate their mazao, celebrants of Kwanzaa place nuts, fruit, and vegetables, representing work, on the mkeka. Mkeka: Place Mat The mkeka, made from straw or cloth, comes directly from Africa and expresses history, culture, and tradition. It symbolizes the historical and traditional foundation for us to stand on and build our lives because today stands on our yesterdays, just as the other symbols stand on the mkeka. In 1965, James Baldwin wrote: “For history is not merely something to be read. And it does not refer merely, or even principally, to the past. On the contrary, the great force of history comes from the facts that we carry it within us, are consciously controlled by it in many ways, and history is literally present in all that we do. It could scarcely be otherwise, since it is to history that we owe our frames of reference, our identities, and our aspirations.” During Kwanzaa, we study, recall, and reflect on our history and the role we are to play as a legacy to the future. Ancient societies made mats from straw, the dried seams of grains, sowed and reaped collectively. The weavers took the stalks and created household baskets and mats. Today, we buy mkeka that are made from Kente cloth, African mud cloth, and other textiles from various areas of the African continent. The mishumaa saba, the vibunzi, the mazao, the zawadi, the kikombe cha umoja, and the kinara are placed directly on the mkeka. Vibunzi: Ear of CornThe stalk of corn represents fertility and symbolizes that through the reproduction of children, the future hopes of the family are brought to life. One ear is called vibunzi, and two or more ears are called mihindi. Each ear symbolizes a child in the family, and thus one ear is placed on the mkeka for each child in the family. If there are no children in the home, two ears are still set on the mkeka because each person is responsible for the children of the community. During Kwanzaa, we take the love and nurturance that was heaped on us as children and selflessly return it to all children, especially the helpless, homeless, loveless ones in our community. Thus, the Nigerian proverb “It takes a whole village to raise a child” is realized in this symbol (vibunzi), since raising a child in Africa was a community affair, involving the tribal village, as well as the family. Good habits of respect for self and others, discipline, positive thinking, expectations, compassion, empathy, charity, and self-direction are learned in childhood from parents, from peers, and from experiences. Children are essential to Kwanzaa, for they are the future, the seed bearers that will carry cultural values and practices into the next generation. For this reason, children were cared for communally and individually within a tribal village. The biological family was ultimately responsible for raising its own children, but every person in the village was responsible for the safety and welfare of all the children. Mishumaa Saba: The Seven CandlesCandles are ceremonial objects with two primary purposes: to re-create symbolically the sun’s power and to provide light. The celebration of fire through candle burning is not limited to one particular group or country; it occurs everywhere. Mishumaa saba are the seven candles: three red, three green and one black. The back candle symbolizes Umoja (unity), the basis of success, and is lit on December 26. The three green candles, representing Nia, Ujima, and Imani, are placed to the right of the Umoja candle, while the three red candles, representing Kujichagulia, Ujamaa, and Kuumba, are placed to the left of it. During Kwanzaa, on candle, representing one principle, is lit each day. Then the other candles are relit to give off more light and vision. The number of candles burning also indicate the principle that is being celebrated. The illuminating fire of the candles is a basic element of the universe, and every celebration and festival includes fire in some form. Fire’s mystique, like the sun, is irresistible and can destroy or create with its mesmerizing, frightening, mystifying power. Mishumaa saba’s symbolic colors are from the red, black and green flag (bendara) created by Marcus Garvey. The colors also represent African gods. Red is the color of Shango, the Yoruba god of fire, thunder, and lightning, who lives in the clouds and sends down his thunderbolt whenever he is angry or offended. It also represents the struggle for self-determination and freedom by people of color. Black is the people, the earth, the source of life, representing hope, creativity, and faith and denoting messages and the opening and closing of doors. Green represents the earth that sustains our lives and provides hope, divination, employment, and the fruits of the harvest. Kinara: The CandleholderThe kinara is the center of the Kwanzaa setting and represents the original stalk from which we came: our ancestry. The kinara can be shape – straight lines, semicircles, or spirals – as long as the seven candles are separate and distinct, like a candelabra. Kinaras are made from all kinds of materials, and many celebrants create their own from fallen branches, wood, or other natural materials. The kinara symbolizes the ancestors, who were once earthbound; understand the problems of human life; and are willing to protect their progeny from danger, evil, and mistakes. In African festivals, the ancestors are remembered and honored. The mishumaa saba are placed in the kinara. Kikombe Cha Umoja: The Unity CupThe kikombe cha umoja is a special cup that is used to perform the libation (tambiko) ritual during the Karamu feast on the sixth day of Kwanzaa. In many African societies libation are poured for the living dead whose souls stay with the earth they tilled. The Ibo of Nigeria believe that to drink the last portion of a libation is to invite the wrath of the spirits and the ancestors; consequently, the last part of the libation belongs to the ancestors. During the Karamu feast, the kikombe cha umoja is passed to family member and guests, who drink from it to promote unity. Then, the eldest person present pours the libation (tambiko), usually water, juice, or wine, in the direction of the four winds – north, south, east, and west – to honor the ancestors. The eldest asks the gods and ancestors to share in the festivities and, in return, to bless all the people who are not at the gathering. After asking for this blessing, the elder pours the libation on the ground and the group says “Amen.” Large Kwanzaa gatherings may operate just as communion services in most churches, for which it is common for celebrants to have individual cups and to drink the libation together as a sign of unity. Several families may have a cup that is specifically for the ancestors, and everyone else has his or her own. The last few ounces of the libation are poured into the cup of the host or hostess, who sips it and then hands it to the oldest person in the group, who asks for the blessing. Zawadi: GiftsWhen we celebrate Imani on the seventh day of Kwanzaa, we give meaningful zawadi (gifts) to encourage growth, self-determination, achievement, and success. We exchange gifts with members of our immediate family, especially the children, to promote or reward accomplishments and commitments kept, as well as with our guests. Handmade gifts are encouraged to promote self-determination, purpose, and creativity and to avoid the chaos of shopping and conspicuous consumption during the December holiday season. A family may spend the year making kinaras or may create cards, dolls, or mkekas to give to their guests. Accepting a gift implies a moral obligation to fulfill the promise of the gift; it obliges the recipient to follow the training of the host. The gift cements social relationships, allowing the receiver to share the duties and the rights of a family member. Accepting a gift makes the receiver part of the family and promotes Umoja.

                "content": "The holiday season is a time to give thanks, connect with loved ones, and think ahead to the future. For those who celebrate Kwanzaa, this festive season ends and the new year begins with a celebration of pan-African culture and history. Observers light candles, commemorate key principles and ideals, and spend time with friends and family from December 26 until January 1. Look no further if you’re getting ready for your first Kwanzaa celebration, or if you simply need to brush up on some of the holiday’s terminology. From the origin of the holiday’s name to the seven principles and symbols, this is the language you need to know to understand Kwanzaa. Kwanzaa is a relatively new holiday. African-American scholar, professor, and activist Maulana Karenga created Kwanzaa in the 1960s when he was 25 years old. In doing so, he combined elements from various African harvest celebrations to highlight the values and strength of the African-American community, like the struggle for self-determination, equality, and justice. In a 2008 newspaper interview, Karenga said he created the holiday to “give Blacks an opportunity to celebrate themselves and their history.” Kwanzaa is a celebration of African heritage and Black culture, and it’s also meant to be a counter to holidays that center mainstream culture and consumerism. Though it’s most commonly observed in the United States, people in the African diaspora celebrate Kwanzaa in other parts of the world, too. According to a 2012 study, approximately 4 percent of Americans reported celebrating Kwanzaa—which would represent more than 12.5 million people. Keep Learning New Words Every Day! The name for this holiday originally comes from the Swahili word kwanza, which translates to “first, firstly,” and is a reference to the Swahili saying matunda ya kwanza, or “first fruits of the harvest.” Karenga used African harvest celebrations to create Kwanzaa because the communal aspects that lead to a successful harvest are also aspects that build and maintain strong communities. Kwanzaa, the holiday, has an extra -a tacked onto the end of the original Swahili word. It’s believed that the extra letter was added so that each of the seven children participating in the first Kwanzaa gatherings in 1966 could have a letter. The number is fitting, considering that seven holds an especially important place in Kwanzaa celebrations, and the number runs through many aspects of the holiday. There are seven days of Kwanzaa, seven symbols, seven candles in the rituals (more on that later), and seven key principles focused on family and community. Kwanzaa is part of the holiday season in the US along with Thanksgiving, Hanukkah, Christmas, and New Year’s Eve. It’s a secular holiday, and therefore is not affiliated with any major organized religion. In fact, those who celebrate Kwanzaa often also celebrate one or more of the other holidays during the season. The seven-day holiday is defined by the seven principles (or Nguzu Saba) of Kwanzaa, which are typically referenced by their Swahili word. Each principle has a day devoted to it and to discussion about what it represents. The seven principles are: People greet each other on each of the seven days of Kwanzaa with the Swahili way to ask “What is the news?”: habari gani. The expected response is the principle of the day (for example, “Umoja” on the first day). The specifics of how each family celebrates Kwanzaa vary, but family gatherings, music, and storytelling are typical. The seven symbols are another commonality. The primary symbol is the set of seven candles (mishumaa saba) that plays a central role throughout the holiday. The three green candles, one black candle, and three red candles are placed in a kinara, or candle holder. Ears of corn (muhindi), gifts (zawadi), a mat (mkeka), crops (mazao), and a ceremonial unity cup called kikombe cha umoja are other important symbols. The second-to-last day of Kwanzaa is New Year’s Eve. It’s called karamu, and people rejoice with food, drinks, and music. On either karamu or the final day of Kwanzaa, imani, kids open their gifts, called zawadi, that are either handmade or purchased from Black-owned businesses. Another New Year’s Eve tradition is singing Auld Lang Syne. Learn the meaning of this song here. One of the most important Kwanzaa rituals revolves around the candles. The black candle is always in the center, while the red candles are on the left and the green on the right. Marcus Garvey listed these colors as representative of the people of the African diaspora, where red represents the struggle, black the people, and green the future. On each day before lighting, the entire family gathers and starts the ritual with tambiko, which is an African form of praise to their ancestors. The house elder pours a drink (either alcoholic or non-alcoholic) from the unity cup (kikombe cha umoja), and says a remembrance for friends and family who have died. Then, they drink juice, wine, or spirits from the kikombe cha umoja and pass it to others to do the same. The candle lighting is also a time for the family to discuss the meaning of the principle of the day. The black candle is lit on the first day, December 26, and then the remaining candles are lit in an alternating left to right pattern each day until the end of Kwanzaa on January 1.

                "content": "Kwanzaa is a week long celebration held in the United States to honor universal African heritage and culture. People light a kinara (candle holder with seven candles)[1] and give each other gifts. It takes place from December 26 to January 1 every year. It was created by Maulana Karenga and was first celebrated in 1966 - 1967. Non-African Americans also celebrate Kwanzaa.[2] The holiday greeting is \"Joyous Kwanzaa\".[3][4][5] Kwanzaa is a celebration that started in the black nationalist movement of the 1960s. It was created as a way to help African Americans reconnect with their African cultural and historical heritage.[source?] The name Kwanzaa comes from the Swahili phrase matunda ya kwanza, meaning first fruits of the harvest.[6] During the early years of Kwanzaa, Karenga said that it was meant to be an alternative to Christmas, that Jesus was psychotic, and that Christianity was a white religion that black people should shun.[7] However, as Kwanzaa became more popular, Karenga changed his position so that practicing Christians could also feel included. He stated in the 1997 Kwanzaa: A Celebration of Family, Community, and Culture, \"Kwanzaa was not created to give people an alternative to their own religion or religious holiday.\"[8] Many Christian African Americans who celebrate Kwanzaa do so in addition to observing Christmas.[9] Kwanzaa celebrates what its founder called the seven principles of Kwanzaa, or Nguzo Saba (originally Nguzu Saba—the seven principles of blackness). Karenga said that this \"is a communitarian African philosophy,\" . It consists of what Karenga called \"the best of African thought and practice in constant exchange with the world.\" These seven principles comprise Kawaida, a Swahili term for tradition and reason. Each of the seven days of Kwanzaa is dedicated to one of the following principles, as follows: Kwanzaa symbols include a decorative mat on which other symbols are placed, corn and other crops, a candle holder with seven candles, called a kinara, a communal cup for pouring libations, gifts, a poster of the seven principles, and a black, red, and green flag. The symbols were designed to convey the seven principles.[10] During Kwanzaa, families also decorate their households with objects of art. They use colorful African cloth such as kente, especially the wearing of kaftans by women. Fresh fruits that represent African idealism are also used. It is normal to include children in Kwanzaa ceremonies and to give respect and gratitude to ancestors. Libations are shared, generally with a common chalice (a shared cup), Kikombe cha Umoja, passed around to all people present. A Kwanzaa ceremony may include drumming and musical selections, libations, a reading of the African Pledge and the Principles of Blackness, reflection on the Pan-African colors, a discussion of the African principle of the day or a chapter in African history, a candle-lighting ritual, artistic performance, and, finally, a feast (Karamu). The greeting for each day of Kwanzaa is Habari Gani?[11] which is Swahili for \"What's the News?\"[12] Cultural exhibitions include the Spirit of Kwanzaa, an annual celebration held at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts featuring interpretive dance, African dance, song and poetry.[13][14]",

                "content": "George Malik Pickens Jr. (born March 4, 2001) is an American professional football wide receiver for the Pittsburgh Steelers of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at Georgia and was selected by the Steelers in the second round of the 2022 NFL draft. Pickens was born in Hoover, Alabama but grew up in nearby Birmingham.[1][2] He grew up with his older brother, Chris Humes, a former cornerback for the Arkansas Razorbacks and later the Oakland Raiders of the NFL, who is seven years his senior.[3][4] Pickens attended Hoover High School in Hoover, Alabama. As a senior, he had 69 receptions for 1,368 yards and 16 touchdowns.[5] On November 16, 2018, Pickens had five receptions for 202 yards in what was the highest stat line of his tenure at Hoover.[6] He played in the 2019 Under Armour All-American Game.[7] A five star recruit, he originally committed to play college football at Auburn University before flipping his commitment to the University of Georgia.[8][9] He graduated from Hoover High School in June 2019.[10] Pickens earned immediate playing time his freshman year at Georgia in 2019, leading the team in receptions (49), receiving yards (727) and receiving touchdowns (8).[11][12][13] In the following season Pickens caught 36 passes for 513 yards and a team-leading six touchdowns in an eight-game season shortened by the COVID-19 pandemic.[14] In the spring of 2021, Pickens tore his ACL causing him to miss most of his junior season.[15] He returned to play in the final four games of the year, catching just five passes, but made a crucial 52-yard reception during the first quarter in Georgia's win over Alabama in the 2022 College Football Playoff National Championship game. The catch is what put Georgia in Alabama territory for the first time during the game, setting up a short field goal for the Bulldogs.[16][17] Pickens declared for the 2022 NFL draft following the season.[18] Pickens was selected by the Pittsburgh Steelers in the second round (52nd overall) of the 2022 NFL draft.[21] He made his first professional start in the Steelers season opener against the Cincinnati Bengals where he caught one pass on three targets for three yards as the Steelers won 23–20.[22] In Week 3 against the Cleveland Browns, Pickens corralled a one-handed catch while fully extending his body in the air. It was called by some the \"Catch of the Year.\"[23] In Week 4, against the New York Jets, he had six receptions for 102 yards in the 24–20 loss.[24] Pickens scored his first professional touchdown during primetime in Week 7 against the Miami Dolphins when he caught a seven-yard pass from quarterback Kenny Pickett. This was the Steelers' only touchdown in the game, as they lost 16–10.[25] In Week 16, Pickens caught the game-winning touchdown against the Las Vegas Raiders with less than a minute remaining.[26] He finished the 2022 season with 52 receptions for 801 yards and a team-high four receiving touchdowns.[27][28] In Week 2 of the 2023 season, Pickens had four receptions for 127 yards and a touchdown in the win over the Browns.[29] In Week 5, against the Ravens, he had six receptions for 130 yards and a touchdown in the 17–10 win.[30] In Week 16 against the Bengals, he had four receptions for 195 yards and two touchdowns, including a 86-yard reception for a score in the first quarter.[31] In the following game, against the Seahawks, he had seven receptions for 131 yards in the win.[32] He finished his second NFL season with 63 receptions for 1,140 yards and five touchdowns in 17 games and 16 starts.[33] He finish the season leading the league in yards per reception with 18.1. Pickens was on the receiving end of controversy throughout the 2023 season. After the Steelers' 20–16 victory over the Tennessee Titans, Pickens was criticized for lacking effort on the field. Throughout the previous two games, Pickens only completed three of ten receptions for 21 yards. He followed the criticism by posting on his Instagram story the words \"free me\" and deleted all posts related to the Steelers.[34] Pickens defended his post by making another post on Instagram explaining that the post was not directed at the Steelers, stating it has \"[nothing] to do with football.\"[35] During Week 15 against the Indianapolis Colts, Pickens was again criticized for a lack of effort, most notably not blocking for running back Jaylen Warren on a potential touchdown drive near the goal line.[36] Following the game, Pickens responded to the criticism stating he was attempting to avoid injury. Following the 2024 preseason, Pickens was named wide receiver one on the Steelers' depth chart.[37] In his first start of the season during Week 1, he made six catches on seven targets for 85 yards. During Week 2's 13–6 win over the Denver Broncos, Pickens caught a pass from quarterback Justin Fields to pick up 51 yards and move the ball to the Broncos' six yard line, however it was negated by a holding penalty on right tackle Broderick Jones.[38] He would finish the game with two receptions for 29 yards.[39] Pickens would eclipse his first 100 receiving yard game of the season during the team's Week 4 24–27 loss to the Indianapolis Colts. During the game, he caught seven passes for 113 yards, but failed to score a touchdown. He would also fumble once, causing the Steelers to lose possession of the ball and set up a touchdown drive for the Colts.[40] In the final moments of the Steelers' 17–20 loss to the Dallas Cowboys, Pickens would get his third and final reception of the game. The Steelers needed to gain significant yardage with no timeouts remaining to put themselves in field goal range to tie the score. Pickens caught the ball around the 25 yard line and stood in place momentarily before throwing a backwards pass to Isaac Seumalo leading to multiple lateral passes being thrown before time expired with a failed lateral from Pat Freiermuth to Mason McCormick to end the game.[41] Pickens finished the game with three catches on seven targets for just 26 yards, his worst game statistically of the season through five weeks.[42] Pickens would rebound during the Steelers' 37–15 victory over the New York Jets on October 20. He caught five passes for 111 yards and a touchdown, making him the team's leading receiver for the game.[43] On November 10, Pickens caught a 20-yard touchdown pass from Russell Wilson in which he leaped in the air and contorted his body backwards while extending his arms backwards over his head in what was named another \"catch of the year\" for Pickens.[44][45][46] During December 1's 44–38 win over the Cincinnati Bengals, Pickens was the team's leading receiver with three catches for 76 yards and a touchdown in the first game the Steelers had put up over 40 points in a single game since November 8, 2018.[47][48] On December 8, Pickens was ruled out of Week 14's victory over the Cleveland Browns with a hamstring injury he sustained earlier in the week during practice. This was the first game of his career in which he did not play.[49] After being drafted by the Steelers in 2022, Pickens moved into an apartment in Pittsburgh with his older brother, Chris Humes.[50] In 2023, Pickens spent Thanksgiving with teammate Broderick Jones at head coach Mike Tomlin's home.[51] On the second night of the 2022 NFL Draft, Pickens was the subject of a viral meme. Dressed in a white T-shirt, blue basketball shorts, and a ski mask, commonly called a \"sheisty,\" Pickens watched as he was selected by the Pittsburgh Steelers in the second round from his family's living room. His outfit, combined with his nonchalant posture, became a meme. Pickens later explained that his look was a mix of humor and frustration after not being chosen in the first round, admitting he was \"a little salty\". He told CBS Sports he decided to take a more relaxed approach to Day 2, skipping the formal suit he had prepared for the draft's opening night.[52]",

                "content": "By Ignacio Cairola December 06, 2024 08:41PM EDT December 06, 2024 08:41PM EDT By Ignacio Cairola The game that the Pittsburgh Steelers will play next Sunday against the Cleveland Browns attracts many statements, a section in which wide receiver George Pickens cannot miss to add a new controversy to his record in the 2024 NFL season. Pickens has a rebellious style when it comes to making statements about opponents or game situations. An example of this was seen just a few days ago when the Steelers wide receiver said after the last game against the Browns that the Cleveland team won thanks to the snow. His words have proven to be unpredictable. In recent hours, even head coach Mike Tomlin has expressed concern about Pickens’ problems, such as in the game against the Cincinnati Bengals, when the 23-year-old was flagged for taunting. “He’s got to grow up fast,” Pittsburgh’s head coach said of the complications Pickens’ behavior brings. In this case, a new conflict is looming. The new controversy involving Pickens began with a statement by the Browns‘ Greg Newsome, who said after the Week 12 game between Pittsburgh and Cleveland that the Steelers receiver was “a fake tough guy“. In that game, the two players had gotten into a scuffle on separate plays. Greg Newsome II #0 of the Cleveland Browns intercepts a pass during the second quarter in the game against the Denver Broncos at Empower Field At Mile High on December 02, 2024 in Denver, Colorado. This Friday, days after Newsome’s previous statement to Pickens, the Steelers receiver was blunt when asked to respond to the controversy with the Browns player. “I don’t even know who that is,” was Pickens’ strong message to the Cleveland cornerback. His comments add spice to the Week 14 matchup between the two franchises. see also NFL News: Mike Tomlin's Steelers set to lose key weapon for Russell Wilson ahead of game vs Browns “I don’t care what he has to say. So I don’t take it as disrespectful because I don’t care about the dude at all. The only way you would take something someone says as disrespectful is if you really care about that person,” Newsome reacted in a dialogue with 92.3 The Fan to Pickens’ statement, who claimed not to know who the Browns player is. Beyond the controversy, which adds tension to the Browns-Steelers game, Pickens may not take the field next Sunday, as he was listed as questionable due to a hamstring injury. His presence will be evaluated in the coming hours. Ignacio Cairola is a bilingual sports journalist and writer fluent in English and Spanish.

Flowers is dealing with a shoulder injury after the Ravens' 34-17 win against the Steelers, in which he went over 1,000 receiving yards on his final catch of 49 yards. Flowers took a big hit at the end of that reception. Reporters saw Flowers with his arm in a sling in the locker room Sunday, but Head Coach John Harbaugh said he's \"pretty optimistic\" about his availability. Fellow wide receiver Nelson Agholor also missed practice after suffering a concussion in the Ravens' Dec. 15 game against the Giants. Running back Justice Hill did not practicing after leaving Saturday's game against the Steelers with a concussion and it would be tough for him to play on a short week. Keaton Mitchell could be active for the first time in weeks as a backup, along with Rasheen Ali, to Derrick Henry. Other players who missed Monday's practice were right guard Daniel Faalele (knee), cornerback Tre'Davious White (shoulder), and cornerback Jalyn Armour-Davis (hamstring). Harbaugh also expressed optimism about Faalele's chances to play in Houston. Center Tyler Linderbaum (back) was limited Monday after missing Sunday's practice. With frigid temperatures in Owings Mills, Md., and the Ravens set for a dome game against the Texans, Monday's practice is being held indoors.

                "title": "Hanukkah - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Hanukkah[a] (/ˈhænəkə/, /ˈhɑːnəkə/; חֲנֻכָּה‎ Ḥănukkā listenⓘ) is a Jewish festival commemorating the recovery of Jerusalem and subsequent rededication of the Second Temple at the beginning of the Maccabean Revolt against the Seleucid Empire in the 2nd century BCE.[3][4] Hanukkah is observed for eight nights and days,[5] starting on the 25th day of Kislev according to the Hebrew calendar, which may occur at any time from November 28 to December 27 in the Gregorian calendar. The festival is observed by lighting the candles of a candelabrum with nine branches, commonly called a menorah or hanukkiah. One branch is typically placed above or below the others and its candle is used to light the other eight candles. This unique candle is called the shammash (שַׁמָּשׁ‎, \"attendant\"). Each night, one additional candle is lit by the shammash until all eight candles are lit together on the final night of the festival.[6] Other Hanukkah festivities include singing Hanukkah songs, playing the game of dreidel and eating oil-based foods, such as latkes and sufganiyot (similar to jelly donuts), and dairy foods. Since the 1970s, the worldwide Chabad Hasidic movement has initiated public menorah lightings in open public places in many countries.[7] Originally instituted as a feast \"in the manner of Sukkot (Booths)\", it does not come with the corresponding obligations, and is therefore a relatively minor holiday in strictly religious terms. Nevertheless, Hanukkah has attained major cultural significance in North America and elsewhere, especially among secular Jews, due to often occurring around the same time as Christmas during the festive season.[8] The name \"Hanukkah\" derives from the Hebrew verb \"חנך‎\", meaning \"to dedicate\". On Hanukkah, the Maccabean Jews regained control of Jerusalem and rededicated the Temple.[9][10] Many homiletical explanations have been given for the name:[11] In Hebrew, the word Hanukkah is written חֲנֻכָּה‎ or חֲנוּכָּה‎ (Ḥănukā). It is most commonly transliterated to English as Hanukkah or Chanukah. The spelling Hanukkah, which is based on using characters of the English alphabet as symbols to re-create the word's correct spelling in Hebrew,[14] is the most common[15] and the preferred choice of Merriam–Webster,[16] Collins English Dictionary, the Oxford Style Manual, and the style guides of The New York Times and The Guardian.[17] The sound represented by Ch ([χ], similar to the Scottish pronunciation of loch) is not native to the English language.[18] Furthermore, the letter ḥeth (ח‎), which is the first letter in the Hebrew spelling, is pronounced differently in modern Hebrew (voiceless uvular fricative) from in classical Hebrew (voiceless pharyngeal fricative [ħ]), and neither of those sounds is unambiguously representable in English spelling. However, its original sound is closer to the English H than to the Scottish Ch, and Hanukkah more accurately represents the spelling in the Hebrew alphabet.[14] Moreover, the 'kaf' consonant is geminate in classical (but not modern) Hebrew. Adapting the classical Hebrew pronunciation with the geminate and pharyngeal Ḥeth can lead to the spelling Hanukkah, while adapting the modern Hebrew pronunciation with no gemination and uvular Ḥeth leads to the spelling Chanukah.[19][20][21] In Modern Hebrew, Hanukkah may also be called the Festival of Lights (חַג הַאוּרִים‎, Ḥag HaUrim), based on a comment by Josephus in Antiquities of the Jews, καὶ ἐξ ἐκείνου μέχρι τοῦ δεῦρο τὴν ἑορτὴν ἄγομεν καλοῦντες αὐτὴν φῶτα \"And from then on we celebrate this festival, and we call it Lights\". The first Hebrew translation of Antiquities (1864) used (חַג הַמְּאֹרוֹת‎) \"Festival of Lamps\", but the translation \"Festival of Lights\" (חַג הַאוּרִים‎) appeared by the end of the nineteenth century.[22] The story of Hanukkah is told in the books of the First and Second Maccabees, which describe in detail the rededication of the Temple in Jerusalem and the lighting of the menorah. These books, however, are not a part of the canonized Masoretic Text version of the Tanakh (Hebrew and Aramaic language Jewish Bible) used and accepted by normative Rabbinical Judaism and therefore modern Jews (as copied, edited and distributed by a group of Jews known as the Masoretes between the 7th and 10th centuries of the Common Era). However, the books of Maccabees were included among the deuterocanonical books added to the Septuagint, a Jewish scholarly Greek-language translation of the Hebrew Bible originally compiled in the mid-3rd century BCE. The Roman Catholic and Orthodox Churches consider the books of Maccabees as a canonical part of the Old Testament.[23] The eight-day rededication of the temple is described in 1 Maccabees,[24] though the miracle of the oil does not appear here. A story similar in character, and older in date, is the one alluded to in 2 Maccabees[25] according to which the relighting of the altar fire by Nehemiah was due to a miracle which occurred on the 25th of Kislev, and which appears to be given as the reason for the selection of the same date for the rededication of the altar by Judah Maccabee.[26] The above account in 1 Maccabees, as well as 2 Maccabees[27] portrays the feast as a delayed observation of the eight-day Feast of Booths (Sukkot); similarly 2 Maccabees explains the length of the feast as \"in the manner of the Feast of Booths\".[28] Megillat Taanit (1st century) contains a list of festive days on which fasting or eulogizing is forbidden. It specifies, \"On the 25th of [Kislev] is Hanukkah of eight days, and one is not to eulogize\" and then references the story of the rededication of the Temple.[29] The Mishna (late 2nd century) mentions Hanukkah in several places,[30] but never describes its laws in detail and never mentions any aspect of the history behind it. To explain the Mishna's lack of a systematic discussion of Hanukkah, Nissim ben Jacob postulated that information on the holiday was so commonplace that the Mishna felt no need to explain it.[31] Modern scholar Reuvein Margolies suggests that as the Mishnah was redacted after the Bar Kochba revolt, its editors were reluctant to include explicit discussion of a holiday celebrating another relatively recent revolt against a foreign ruler, for fear of antagonizing the Romans.[32] The miracle of the one-day supply of oil miraculously lasting eight days is described in the Talmud, committed to writing about 600 years after the events described in the books of Maccabees.[33] The Talmud says that after the forces of Antiochus IV had been driven from the Temple, the Maccabees discovered that almost all of the ritual olive oil had been profaned. They found only a single container that was still sealed by the High Priest, with enough oil to keep the menorah in the Temple lit for a single day. They used this, yet it burned for eight days (the time it took to have new oil pressed and made ready).[34] The Talmud presents three options:[35] Except in times of danger, the lights were to be placed outside one's door, on the opposite side of the mezuza, or in the window closest to the street. Rashi, in a note to Shabbat 21b, says their purpose is to publicize the miracle. The blessings for Hanukkah lights are discussed in tractate Succah, p. 46a.[36] Megillat Antiochus (probably composed in the 2nd century[37]) concludes with the following words: ...After this, the sons of Israel went up to the Temple and rebuilt its gates and purified the Temple from the dead bodies and from the defilement. And they sought after pure olive oil to light the lamps therewith, but could not find any, except one bowl that was sealed with the signet ring of the High Priest from the days of Samuel the prophet and they knew that it was pure. There was in it [enough oil] to light [the lamps therewith] for one day, but the God of heaven whose name dwells there put therein his blessing and they were able to light from it eight days. Therefore, the sons of Ḥashmonai made this covenant and took upon themselves a solemn vow, they and the sons of Israel, all of them, to publish amongst the sons of Israel, [to the end] that they might observe these eight days of joy and honour, as the days of the feasts written in [the book of] the Law; [even] to light in them so as to make known to those who come after them that their God wrought for them salvation from heaven. In them, it is not permitted to mourn, neither to decree a fast [on those days], and anyone who has a vow to perform, let him perform it.[38] The Al HaNissim prayer is recited on Hanukkah as an addition to the Amidah prayer, which was formalized in the late 1st century.[39] Al HaNissim describes the history of the holiday as follows: The Jewish historian Titus Flavius Josephus narrates in his book, Jewish Antiquities XII, how the victorious Judas Maccabeus ordered lavish yearly eight-day festivities after rededicating the Temple in Jerusalem that had been profaned by Antiochus IV Epiphanes.[40] Josephus does not say the festival was called Hanukkah but rather the \"Festival of Lights\": In the New Testament, John 10:22–23 says, \"Then came the Festival of Dedication at Jerusalem. It was winter, and Jesus was in the temple courts walking in Solomon's Colonnade\" (NIV). The Greek noun used appears in the neuter plural as \"the renewals\" or \"the consecrations\" (Ancient Greek: τὰ ἐγκαίνια; ta enkaínia).[42] The same root appears in 2 Esdras 6:16 in the Septuagint to refer specifically to Hanukkah. This Greek word was chosen because the Hebrew word for 'consecration' or 'dedication' is Hanukkah (חנכה). The Aramaic New Testament uses the Aramaic word hawdata (a close synonym), which literally means 'renewal' or 'to make new'.[43] After the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BCE, Judea became part of the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt until 200 BCE, when King Antiochus III the Great of Syria defeated King Ptolemy V Epiphanes of Egypt at the Battle of Panium. Judea then became part of the Seleucid Empire of Syria.[44] King Antiochus III the Great, wanting to conciliate his new Jewish subjects, guaranteed their right to \"live according to their ancestral customs\" and to continue to practice their religion in the Temple of Jerusalem.[45] The Seleucids, like the Ptolemies before them, held a suzerainty over Judea, where they respected Jewish culture and protected Jewish institutions. This policy was drastically reversed by Antiochus IV Epiphanes, the son of Antiochus III, seemingly after what was either a dispute over leadership of the Temple in Jerusalem and the office of High Priest, or possibly a revolt whose nature was lost to time after being crushed.[46] In 175 BCE, Antiochus IV invaded Judea at the request of the sons of Tobias.[47] The Tobiads, who led the Hellenizing Jewish faction in Jerusalem, were expelled to Syria around 170 BCE when the high priest Onias and his pro-Egyptian faction wrested control from them. The exiled Tobiads lobbied Antiochus IV Epiphanes to recapture Jerusalem. As Flavius Josephus relates: The king being thereto disposed beforehand, complied with them, and came upon the Jews with a great army, and took their city by force, and slew a great multitude of those that favored Ptolemy, and sent out his soldiers to plunder them without mercy. He also spoiled the temple, and put a stop to the constant practice of offering a daily sacrifice of expiation for three years and six months. When the Second Temple in Jerusalem was looted and services stopped, Judaism was outlawed. In 167 BCE, Antiochus ordered an altar to Zeus erected in the Temple. He banned brit milah (circumcision) and ordered pigs to be sacrificed at the altar of the temple.[49] Antiochus's actions provoked a large-scale revolt. Mattathias (Mattityahu), a Jewish priest, and his five sons Jochanan, Simeon, Eleazar, Jonathan, and Judah led a rebellion against Antiochus. It started with Mattathias killing first a Jew who wanted to comply with Antiochus's order to sacrifice to Zeus, and then a Greek official who was to enforce the government's behest (1 Mac. 2, 24–25[50]). Judah became known as Yehuda HaMakabi (\"Judah the Hammer\"). By 166 BCE, Mattathias had died, and Judah took his place as leader. By 164 BCE, the Jewish revolt against the Seleucid monarchy was successful. The Temple was liberated and rededicated. The festival of Hanukkah was instituted to celebrate this event.[51] Judah ordered the Temple to be cleansed, a new altar to be built in place of the polluted one and new holy vessels to be made.[26] According to the Talmud, \"For when the Greeks entered the Sanctuary, they defiled all the oils therein, and when the Hasmonean dynasty prevailed against and defeated them, they made search and found only one cruse of oil which lay with the seal of the kohen gadol (high priest), but which contained sufficient [oil] for one day's lighting only; yet a miracle was wrought therein, and they lit [the lamp] therewith for eight days. The following year these [days] were appointed a Festival with [the recital of] Hallel and thanksgiving.\" —Shabbat 21b Tertiary sources in the Jewish tradition make reference to this account.[52] Maimonides (12th century) described Hanukkah as follows: When, on the twenty-fifth of Kislev, the Jews had emerged victorious over their foes and destroyed them, they re-entered the Temple where they found only one jar of pure oil, enough to be lit for only a single day; yet they used it for lighting the required set of lamps for eight days, until they managed to press olives and produce pure oil. Because of this, the sages of that generation ruled that the eight days beginning with the twenty-fifth of Kislev should be observed as days of rejoicing and praising the Lord. Lamps are lit in the evening over the doors of the homes, on each of the eight nights, so as to display the miracle. These days are called Hanukkah, when it is forbidden to lament or to fast, just as it is on the days of Purim. Lighting the lamps during the eight days of Hanukkah is a religious duty imposed by the sages.[53] Some modern scholars, following the account in 2 Maccabees, observe that the king was intervening in an internal civil war between the Maccabean Jews and the Hellenized Jews in Jerusalem.[54][55][56][57] These competed violently over who would be the High Priest, with traditionalists with Hebrew/Aramaic names like Onias contesting with Hellenizing High Priests with Greek names like Jason and Menelaus.[58] In particular, Jason's Hellenistic reforms would prove to be a decisive factor leading to eventual conflict within the ranks of Judaism.[59] Other authors point to possible socioeconomic reasons in addition to the religious reasons behind the civil war.[60] What began in many respects as a civil war escalated when the Hellenistic kingdom of Syria sided with the Hellenizing Jews in their conflict with the traditionalists.[61] As the conflict escalated, Antiochus took the side of the Hellenizers by prohibiting the religious practices the traditionalists had rallied around. This may explain why the king, in a total departure from Seleucid practice in all other places and times, banned a traditional religion.[62] The miracle of the oil is widely regarded as a legend and its authenticity has been questioned since the Middle Ages.[63] However, given the famous question Joseph Karo (1488–1575) posed concerning why Hanukkah is celebrated for eight days when the miracle was only for seven days (since there was enough oil for one day),[64] it was clear that writing in the 16th century CE, he believed it to be a historical event. This belief has been adopted by most of Orthodox Judaism, in as much as Karo's Shulchan Aruch is a main code of Jewish Law. Selected battles between the Maccabees and the Seleucid Syrian-Greeks: Hanukkah is celebrated with a series of rituals that are performed every day throughout the eight-day holiday, some are family-based and others communal. There are special additions to the daily prayer service, and a section is added to the blessing after meals.[79] Hanukkah is not a \"Sabbath-like\" holiday, and there is no obligation to refrain from activities that are forbidden on the Sabbath, as specified in the Shulkhan Arukh.[80][81] Adherents go to work as usual but may leave early in order to be home to kindle the lights at nightfall. There is no religious reason for schools to be closed, although in Israel schools close from the second day for the whole week of Hanukkah.[82][83] Many families exchange gifts each night, such as books or games, and \"Hanukkah Gelt\" is often given to children. Fried foods—such as latkes (potato pancakes), jelly doughnuts (sufganiyot) and Sephardic bimuelos—are eaten to commemorate the importance of oil during the celebration of Hanukkah. Some also have a custom of eating dairy products to remember Judith and how she overcame Holofernes by feeding him cheese, which made him thirsty, and giving him wine to drink. When Holofernes became very drunk, Judith cut off his head.[84] Each night throughout the eight-day holiday, a candle or oil-based light is lit. As a universally practiced \"beautification\" (hiddur mitzvah) of the mitzvah, the number of lights lit is increased by one each night.[85] An extra light called a shammash, meaning \"attendant\" or \"sexton\",[86] is also lit each night, and is given a distinct location, usually higher, lower, or to the side of the others.[81] Among Ashkenazim the tendency is for every male member of the household (and in many families, girls as well) to light a full set of lights each night,[87][88] while among Sephardim the prevalent custom is to have one set of lights for the entire household.[89] The purpose of the shammash is to adhere to the prohibition, specified in the Talmud,[90] against using the Hanukkah lights for anything other than publicizing and meditating on the Hanukkah miracle. This differs from Sabbath candles which are meant to be used for illumination and lighting. Hence, if one were to need extra illumination on Hanukkah, the shammash candle would be available, and one would avoid using the prohibited lights. Some, especially Ashkenazim, light the shammash candle first and then use it to light the others.[91] So altogether, including the shammash, two lights are lit on the first night, three on the second and so on, ending with nine on the last night, for a total of 44 (36, excluding the shammash). It is Sephardic custom not to light the shammash first and use it to light the rest. Instead, the shammash candle is the last to be lit, and a different candle or a match is used to light all the candles. Some Hasidic Jews follow this Sephardic custom as well.[92] The lights can be candles or oil lamps.[91] Electric lights are sometimes used and are acceptable in places where open flame is not permitted, such as a hospital room, or for the very elderly and infirm; however, those who permit reciting a blessing over electric lamps only allow it if it is incandescent and battery operated (an incandescent flashlight would be acceptable for this purpose), while a blessing may not be recited over a plug-in menorah or lamp. Most Jewish homes have a special candelabrum referred to as either a Hanukkah menorah (the traditional name, menorah being Hebrew for 'lamp') or a Chanukiah (the modern Israeli term). Some families use an oil lamp menorah (traditionally filled with olive oil) for Hanukkah; like the candle version, it has eight wicks to light plus the additional shammash light.[93] In the United States, Hanukkah became a more visible festival in the public sphere from the 1970s when Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson called for public awareness and observance of the festival and encouraged the lighting of public menorahs.[94][95][96][97] The reason for the Hanukkah lights is not for the \"lighting of the house within\", but rather for the \"illumination of the house without\", so that passersby should see it and be reminded of the holiday's miracle (i.e. that the sole cruse of pure oil found which held enough oil to burn for one night actually burned for eight nights). Accordingly, lamps are set up at a prominent window or near the door leading to the street. It is customary amongst some Ashkenazi Jews to have a separate menorah for each family member (customs vary), whereas most Sephardi Jews light one for the whole household. Only when there was danger of antisemitic persecution were lamps supposed to be hidden from public view, as was the case in Persia under the rule of the Zoroastrians,[26] or in parts of Europe before and during World War II. However, most Hasidic groups light lamps near an inside doorway, not necessarily in public view. According to this tradition, the lamps are placed on the opposite side from the mezuzah, so people passing through the door are surrounded by the holiness of mitzvot (the commandments).[98] Generally, women are exempt in Jewish law from time-bound positive commandments, although the Talmud requires that women engage in the mitzvah of lighting Hanukkah candles \"for they too were involved in the miracle.\"[99][100] Some Jews in North America and Israel have taken up environmental concerns in relation to Hanukkah's \"miracle of the oil\", emphasizing reflection on energy conservation and energy independence. An example of this is the Coalition on the Environment and Jewish Life's renewable energy campaign.[101][102][103] Hanukkah lights should usually burn for at least half an hour after it gets dark.[104] Many light at sundown, while most Hasidim and many other communities light later, generally around nightfall.[105] Many Hasidic Rebbes light much later to fulfill the obligation of publicizing the miracle by the presence of their Hasidim when they kindle the lights.[106] Inexpensive small wax candles sold for Hanukkah burn for approximately half an hour so should be lit no earlier than nightfall.[104] Friday night presents a problem, however. Since candles may not be lit on Shabbat itself, the candles must be lit before sunset.[104] However, they must remain lit through the lighting of the Shabbat candles. Therefore, the Hanukkah menorah is lit first with larger candles than usual,[104] followed by the Shabbat candles. At the end of the Shabbat, there are those who light the Hanukkah lights before Havdalah and those who make Havdalah before the lighting Hanukkah lights.[107] If for whatever reason one didn't light at sunset or nightfall, the lights should be kindled later, as long as there are people in the streets.[104] Later than that, the lights should still be kindled, but the blessings should be recited only if there is at least somebody else awake in the house and present at the lighting of the Hannukah lights.[108] Typically two blessings (brachot; singular: brachah) are recited during this eight-day festival when lighting the candles. On the first night only, the shehecheyanu blessing is added, making a total of three blessings.[109] The first blessing is recited before the candles are lit, and while most recite the other blessing(s) beforehand as well, some have the custom to recite them after. On the first night of Hanukkah one light (candle or oil) is lit on the right side of the menorah, on the following night a second light is placed to the left of the first but it is lit first, and so on, proceeding from placing candles right to left but lighting them from left to right over the eight nights.[110] Transliteration: Barukh ata Adonai Eloheinu, melekh ha'olam, asher kid'shanu b'mitzvotav v'tzivanu l'hadlik ner Hanukkah. Translation: \"Blessed are You, LORD our God, King of the universe, Who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to kindle the Hanukkah light[s].\" Transliteration: Barukh ata Adonai Eloheinu, melekh ha'olam, she'asa nisim la'avoteinu ba'yamim ha'heim ba'z'man ha'ze. Translation: \"Blessed are You, LORD our God, King of the universe, Who performed miracles for our ancestors in those days at this time...\" After the lights are kindled the hymn Hanerot Halalu is recited. There are several different versions; the version presented here is recited in many Ashkenazic communities:[112] In the Ashkenazi tradition, each night after the lighting of the candles, the hymn Ma'oz Tzur is sung. The song contains six stanzas. The first and last deal with general themes of divine salvation, and the middle four deal with events of persecution in Jewish history, praising God for survival despite these tragedies (the exodus from Egypt, the Babylonian captivity, the miracle of the holiday of Purim, the Hasmonean victory) and expressing a longing for the days when Judea will finally triumph over Rome.[113] The song was composed in the thirteenth century by a poet only known through the acrostic found in the first letters of the original five stanzas of the song: Mordechai. The familiar tune is most probably a derivation of a German Protestant church hymn or a popular folk song.[114] After lighting the candles and Ma'oz Tzur, singing other Hanukkah songs is customary in many Jewish homes. Some Hasidic and Sephardi Jews recite Psalms, such as Psalm 30, Psalm 67, and Psalm 91. In North America and in Israel it is common to exchange presents or give children presents at this time. In addition, many families encourage their children to give tzedakah (charity) in lieu of presents for themselves.[115][116] \"We thank You also for the miraculous deeds and for the redemption and for the mighty deeds and the saving acts wrought by You, as well as for the wars which You waged for our ancestors in ancient days at this season. In the days of the Hasmonean Mattathias, son of Johanan the high priest, and his sons, when the iniquitous Greco-Syrian kingdom rose up against Your people Israel, to make them forget Your Torah and to turn them away from the ordinances of Your will, then You in your abundant mercy rose up for them in the time of their trouble, pled their cause, executed judgment, avenged their wrong, and delivered the strong into the hands of the weak, the many into the hands of few, the impure into the hands of the pure, the wicked into the hands of the righteous, and insolent ones into the hands of those occupied with Your Torah. Both unto Yourself did you make a great and holy name in Thy world, and unto Your people did You achieve a great deliverance and redemption. Whereupon your children entered the sanctuary of Your house, cleansed Your temple, purified Your sanctuary, kindled lights in Your holy courts, and appointed these eight days of Hanukkah in order to give thanks and praises unto Your holy name.\" An addition is made to the \"hoda'ah\" (thanksgiving) benediction in the Amidah (thrice-daily prayers), called Al HaNissim (\"On/about the Miracles\").[118] This addition refers to the victory achieved over the Syrians by the Hasmonean Mattathias and his sons.[119][120][26] The same prayer is added to the grace after meals. In addition, the Hallel (praise) Psalms[121] are sung during each morning service and the Tachanun penitential prayers are omitted.[119][122] The Torah is read every day in the shacharit morning services in synagogue, on the first day beginning from Numbers 6:22 (according to some customs, Numbers 7:1), and the last day ending with Numbers 8:4. Since Hanukkah lasts eight days it includes at least one, and sometimes two, Jewish Sabbaths (Saturdays). The weekly Torah portion for the first Sabbath is almost always Miketz, telling of Joseph's dream and his enslavement in Egypt. The Haftarah reading for the first Sabbath Hanukkah is Zechariah 2:14 – Zechariah 4:7. When there is a second Sabbath on Hanukkah, the Haftarah reading is from 1 Kings 7:40–50. The Hanukkah menorah is also kindled daily in the synagogue, at night with the blessings and in the morning without the blessings.[123] The menorah is not lit during Shabbat, but rather prior to the beginning of Shabbat as described above and not at all during the day. During the Middle Ages \"Megillat Antiochus\" was read in the Italian synagogues on Hanukkah just as the Book of Esther is read on Purim. It still forms part of the liturgy of the Yemenite Jews.[124] The last day of Hanukkah is known by some as Zot Hanukkah and by others as Chanukat HaMizbeach, from the verse read on this day in the synagogue Numbers 7:84, Zot Hanukkat Hamizbe'ach: \"This was the dedication of the altar\". According to the teachings of Kabbalah and Hasidism, this day is the final \"seal\" of the High Holiday season of Yom Kippur and is considered a time to repent out of love for God. In this spirit, many Hasidic Jews wish each other Gmar chatimah tovah (\"may you be sealed totally for good\"), a traditional greeting for the Yom Kippur season. It is taught in Hasidic and Kabbalistic literature that this day is particularly auspicious for the fulfillment of prayers.[125] It is customary for women not to work for at least the first half-hour of the candles' burning, and some have the custom not to work for the entire time of burning. It is also forbidden to fast or to eulogize during Hanukkah.[81] Some Hasidic scholars teach that the Hanukkah is in fact the final conclusion of God's judgment extending High Holy Days of Rosh Hashana when humanity is judged and Yom Kippur when the judgment is sealed: Hanukkah songs (in Hebrew except where indicated) include \"Ma'oz Tzur\" (Rock of Ages), \"Latke'le Latke'le\" (Yiddish: \"Little Latke, Little Latke\"), \"Hanukkiah Li Yesh\" (\"I Have a Hanukkah Menorah\"), \"Ocho Kandelikas\" (Judeo-Spanish: \"Eight Little Candles\"), \"Kad Katan\" (\"A Small Jug\"), \"S'vivon Sov Sov Sov\" (\"Dreidel, Spin and Spin\"), \"Haneirot Halolu\" (\"These Candles Which We Light\"), \"Mi Yimalel\" (\"Who Can Retell\") and \"Ner Li, Ner Li\" (\"I have a Candle\"). Among the best known songs in English-speaking countries are \"Dreidel, Dreidel, Dreidel\"[127] and \"Oh Chanukah\".[128] In the Nadvorna Hasidic dynasty, it is customary for the rebbes to play violin after the menorah is lit.[129] Penina Moise's Hannukah Hymn published in the 1842 Hymns Written for the Use of Hebrew Congregations was instrumental in the beginning of Americanization of Hanukkah.[130][131][132] There is a custom of eating foods fried or baked in oil (preferably olive oil) to commemorate the miracle of a small flask of oil keeping the Second Temple's Menorah alight for eight days.[133] Traditional foods include potato pancakes, known as latkes in Yiddish, especially among Ashkenazi families. Sephardi, Polish, and Israeli families eat jam-filled doughnuts (Yiddish: פּאָנטשקעס pontshkes), bimuelos (fritters) and sufganiyot which are deep-fried in oil. Italkim and Hungarian Jews traditionally eat cheese pancakes known as \"cassola\" or \"cheese latkes\".[134] Latkes are not popular in Israel, having been largely replaced by sufganiyot due to local economic factors, convenience and the influence of trade unions.[135] Bakeries in Israel have popularized many new types of fillings for sufganiyot besides the traditional strawberry jelly filling, including chocolate cream, vanilla cream, caramel, cappuccino and others.[136] In recent years, downsized, \"mini\" sufganiyot containing half the calories of the regular, 400-to-600-calorie version, have become popular.[137] Rabbinic literature also records a tradition of eating cheese and other dairy products during Hanukkah.[138] This custom, as mentioned above, commemorates the heroism of Judith during the Babylonian captivity of the Jews and reminds us that women also played an important role in the events of Hanukkah.[139] The deuterocanonical book of Judith (Yehudit or Yehudis in Hebrew), which is not part of the Tanakh, records that Holofernes, an Assyrian general, had surrounded the village of Bethulia as part of his campaign to conquer Judea. After intense fighting, the water supply of the Jews was cut off and the situation became desperate. Judith, a pious widow, told the city leaders that she had a plan to save the city. Judith went to the Assyrian camps and pretended to surrender. She met Holofernes, who was smitten by her beauty. She went back to his tent with him, where she plied him with cheese and wine. When he fell into a drunken sleep, Judith beheaded him and escaped from the camp, taking the severed head with her (the beheading of Holofernes by Judith has historically been a popular theme in art). When Holofernes' soldiers found his corpse, they were overcome with fear; the Jews, on the other hand, were emboldened and launched a successful counterattack. The town was saved, and the Assyrians defeated.[140] Roast goose has historically been a traditional Hanukkah food among Eastern European and American Jews, although the custom has declined in recent decades.[141] Indian Jews traditionally consume gulab jamun, fried dough balls soaked in a sweet syrup, similar to teiglach or bimuelos, as part of their Hanukkah celebrations. Italian Jews eat fried chicken, cassola (a ricotta cheese latke almost similar to a cheesecake), and fritelle de riso par Hanukkah (a fried sweet rice pancake). Romanian Jews eat pasta latkes as a traditional Hanukkah dish, and Syrian Jews consume Kibbet Yatkeen, a dish made with pumpkin and bulgur wheat similar to latkes, as well as their own version of keftes de prasa spiced with allspice and cinnamon.[142] After lighting the candles, it is customary to play (or spin) the dreidel. The dreidel, or sevivon in Hebrew, is a four-sided spinning top that children play with during Hanukkah. Each side is imprinted with a Hebrew letter which is an abbreviation for the Hebrew words נס גדול היה שם (Nes Gadol Haya Sham, \"A great miracle happened there\"), referring to the miracle of the oil that took place in the Beit Hamikdash. The fourth side of some dreidels sold in Israel are inscribed with the letter פ (Pe), rendering the acronym נס גדול היה פה (Nes Gadol Haya Po, \"A great miracle happened here\"), referring to the fact that the miracle occurred in the land of Israel, although this is a relatively recent[when?] innovation. Stores in Haredi neighborhoods sell the traditional Shin dreidels as well, because they understand \"there\" to refer to the Temple and not the entire Land of Israel, and because the Hasidic Masters ascribe significance to the traditional letters.[143][144] Chanukkah gelt (Yiddish for \"Chanukkah money\"), known in Israel by the Hebrew translation Hebrew: דְּמֵי חֲנֻכָּה, romanized: dmei Hanukkah, is often distributed to children during the festival of Hanukkah. The giving of Hanukkah gelt also adds to the holiday excitement. The amount is usually in small coins, although grandparents or relatives may give larger sums. The tradition of giving Chanukah gelt dates back to a long-standing East European custom of children presenting their teachers with a small sum of money at this time of year as a token of gratitude. One minhag favors the fifth night of Hanukkah for giving Hanukkah gelt.[145] Unlike the other nights of Hanukkah, the fifth does not ever fall on the Shabbat, hence never conflicting with the Halachic injunction against handling money on the Shabbat.[146] The earliest Hanukkah link with the White House occurred in 1951 when Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion presented United States President Harry Truman with a Hanukkah menorah. In 1979 President Jimmy Carter took part in the first public Hanukkah candle-lighting ceremony of the National Menorah held across the White House lawn. In 1989, President George H. W. Bush displayed a menorah in the White House. In 1993, President Bill Clinton invited a group of schoolchildren to the Oval Office for a small ceremony.[95] The United States Postal Service has released several Hanukkah-themed postage stamps. In 1996, the United States Postal Service (USPS) issued a 32 cent Hanukkah stamp as a joint issue with Israel.[147] In 2004, after eight years of reissuing the menorah design, the USPS issued a dreidel design for the Hanukkah stamp. The dreidel design was used through 2008. In 2009 a Hanukkah stamp was issued with a design featured a photograph of a menorah with nine lit candles.[148] In 2008, President George W. Bush held an official Hanukkah reception in the White House where he linked the occasion to the 1951 gift by using that menorah for the ceremony, with a grandson of Ben-Gurion and a grandson of Truman lighting the candles.[149] In December 2014, two Hanukkah celebrations were held at the White House. The White House commissioned a menorah made by students at the Max Rayne school in Israel and invited two of its students to join U.S. President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama as they welcomed over 500 guests to the celebration. The students' school in Israel had been subjected to arson by extremists. President Obama said these \"students teach us an important lesson for this time in our history. The light of hope must outlast the fires of hate. That's what the Hanukkah story teaches us. It's what our young people can teach us – that one act of faith can make a miracle, that love is stronger than hate, that peace can triumph over conflict.\"[150] Rabbi Angela Warnick Buchdahl, in leading prayers at the ceremony commented on the how special the scene was, asking the President if he believed America's founding fathers could possibly have pictured that a female Asian-American rabbi would one day be at the White House leading Jewish prayers in front of the African-American president.[151] The dates of Hanukkah are determined by the Hebrew calendar. Hanukkah begins at the 25th day of Kislev and concludes on the second or third day of Tevet (Kislev can have 29 or 30 days). The Jewish day begins at sunset. Hanukkah dates for recent and upcoming: In 2013, on 28 November, the American holiday of Thanksgiving fell during Hanukkah for only the third time since Thanksgiving was declared a national holiday by President Abraham Lincoln. The last time was 1899, and due to the nature of the Gregorian and Jewish calendars being slightly out of sync with each other, it will not happen again in the foreseeable future.[152] This rare convergence prompted the creation of the neologism Thanksgivukkah.[153][154][155] Major Jewish holidays are those when all forms of work are forbidden, and that feature traditional holiday meals, kiddush, holiday candle-lighting, etc. Only biblical holidays fit these criteria, and Chanukah was instituted some two centuries after the Hebrew Bible was completed. Nevertheless, though Chanukah is of rabbinic origin, it is traditionally celebrated in a major and very public fashion. The requirement to position the menorah, or Chanukiah, at the door or window, symbolizes the desire to give the Chanukah miracle a high-profile.[156] Moreover, Hallel (a set of Psalms expressing praise that is recited on significant Jewish holidays) is recited on all eight days of Hanukkah, which signifies Hanukkah's importance on the Jewish calendar. While not considered the most significant holiday, the recitation of Hallel on Hanukkah highlights its importance in Jewish tradition.[157] Some Jewish historians suggest a different explanation for the rabbinic reluctance to laud the militarism.[clarification needed] First, the rabbis wrote after Hasmonean leaders had led Judea into Rome's grip and so may not have wanted to offer the family much praise. Second, they clearly wanted to promote a sense of dependence on God, urging Jews to look toward the divine for protection. They likely feared inciting Jews to another revolt that might end in disaster, as the Bar Kochba revolt did.[158] \"Hanukkah is an ancient holiday, but a modest one. The holiday of the Hasmoneans is new, yet it is full of spiritual exaltation and national joy. What was Hanukkah forty years ago? 'Al ha-nissim' and Hallel; a short reading in the synagogue; lighting the tiny, slender wax candles or oil lights; at home, levivot [latkes-potato pancakes], cards for the older children, and sevivonim [dreidels-spinning tops] for the little ones. But what is Hanukkah today? The holiday of the Hasmoneans. A holiday of salvation. A great national holiday, celebrated in all the countries of the Diaspora with dances and speeches, melody and song, outings and parades, as if a new soul has been breathed into the ancient holiday, another spirit renewed within it. One thing is clear: if those tiny, modest candles had been extinguished in Diaspora times, if our grandparents had not preserved the traditions of Hanukkah in the synagogue and at home . .., the holiday of the Hasmoneans could never have been created. There would have been nothing to change, nothing to renew. The new soul of our times would not have found a body in which to envelop itself.\" The emergence of Jewish nationalism and the Zionist movement in the late 19th and early 20th centuries had a profound impact on the celebration and reinterpretation of Jewish holidays. These developments resulted in increased emphasis on certain Jewish celebrations, of which Hanukkah and Tu BiShvat are prominent examples.[161] Hanukkah took on renewed meaning following the rise of Jewish nationalism as a nationalist holiday, symbolizing the struggle of the Jewish people against foreign oppression and their desire for national re-creation [162] (although the struggle of Jews against foreign oppression has always been a core componant of Hanukkah, as shown by the Al HaNissim, which has been part of Jewish liturgy since at least 700 CE).[163] Hanukkah served as a common ground where both religious and secular Zionists could unite around their nationalist agenda. Rabbi Shmuel Mohilever, an early religious Zionist, proposed making Hanukkah the official holiday of the proto-Zionist organization Hovevei Zion in Russia in 1881. Public celebrations of Hanukkah gained prominence in the early 20th century, with parades and public events becoming common. Schools in Mandate Palestine played an early role in promoting these celebrations.[164] With the advent of Zionism and the state of Israel, the themes of militarism were reconsidered. In modern Israel, the national and military aspects of Hanukkah became, once again, more dominant.[165][166] In North America, Hanukkah in the 21st century has taken a place equal to Passover as a symbol of Jewish identity. Both the Israeli and North American versions of Hanukkah emphasize resistance, focusing on some combination of national liberation and religious freedom as the defining meaning of the holiday.[167][8] Diane Ashton attributed the increased visibility and reinvention of Hanukkah by some of the American Jewish community as a way to adapt to American life, re-inventing the festival in \"the language of individualism and personal conscience derived from both Protestantism and the Enlightenment\".[130] In the Catholic Church, Christmastide has its own Octave, being eight days especially set aside to celebrate Christmas from 25 December to 1 January. This is seen as a Christian fulfillment of the original text's demand for Hanukkah to be eight days, \"And they kept the eight days with gladness, as in the feast of the tabernacles, remembering that not long afore they had held the feast of the tabernacles\" (2 Macc 10:6). Advent is considered as the season of darkness preceding the season of light, Christmas, so for this reason, Christmas can be said to be the \"New Hanukkah\", or its fulfillment through the Nativity of Christ. This is similar to the Easter Octave being the solemn eight days of the Passover of Exodus.[citation needed] In North America, Hanukkah became increasingly important to many Jewish individuals and families during the latter part of the 20th century, including a large number of secular Jews, who wanted to celebrate a Jewish alternative to the Christmas celebrations which frequently overlap with Hanukkah.[168][169] Diane Ashton argues that Jewish immigrants to America raised the profile of Hanukkah as a kid-centered alternative to Christmas as early as the 1800s.[170] This in parts mirrors the ascendancy of Christmas, which like Hanukkah increased in importance in the 1800s.[171] During this time period, Jewish leaders (especially Reform) such as Max Lilienthal and Isaac Mayer Wise made an effort to rebrand Hanukkah and started creating Hanukkah celebration for kids at their synagogues, which included candy and singing songs.[170][172] By the 1900s, it started to become a commercial holiday like Christmas, with Hanukkah gifts and decorations appearing in stores and Jewish Women's magazines printing articles on holiday decorations, children's celebrations, and gift giving.[170] Ashton says that Jewish families did this in order to maintain a Jewish identity which is distinct from mainline Christian culture, on the other hand, the mirroring of Hanukkah and Christmas made Jewish families and kids feel that they were American.[170] Though it was traditional for Ashkenazi Jews to give \"gelt\" or money to children during Hanukkah, in many families, this tradition has been supplemented with the giving of other gifts so that Jewish children can enjoy receiving gifts just like their Christmas-celebrating peers do.[173] Children play a big role in Hanukkah, and Jewish families with children are more likely to celebrate it than childless Jewish families, and sociologists hypothesize that this is because Jewish parents do not want their kids to be alienated from their non-Jewish peers who celebrate Christmas.[168] Recent celebrations have also seen the presence of the Hanukkah bush, which is considered a Jewish counterpart to the Christmas tree. Today, the presence of Hanukkah bushes is generally discouraged by most rabbis.[174] In December 2022, New York City Mayor Eric Adams, Reverends Al Sharpton and Conrad Tillard, businessman Robert F. Smith, Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, and Elisha Wiesel joined to celebrate Hanukkah and Kwanzaa together, and combat racism and antisemitism, at Carnegie Hall.[175][176][177][178]",

                "content": "The Jewish Festival of Lights is an eight-day celebration that commemorates the rededication of the Second Temple of Jerusalem. It is one of the most popular holidays in Judaism and is marked by the lighting of the menorah. For many English speakers, the festival is also known for confusion over the spelling of its name: Is it Hanukkah or Chanukah? The answer is that both are considered correct, though Hanukkah is the most widely used spelling, while Chanukah is more traditional. In addition, more than 20 other variations are recorded. Why so many spellings? Transliteration. Hebrew does not use the Latin alphabet, which is the standard script of many languages, including English. Thus, when used in an English context, the sounds of the different Hebrew characters must be converted, or transliterated, into Latin letters. However, the Hebrew word for the holiday uses sounds that aren’t found in the Latin alphabet. The difficulty begins with the very first letter of the word, which is the eighth letter of the Hebrew alphabet—ḥet, or chet. It is pronounced with a guttural sound that is similar to the /ch/ in loch. So, when the Hebrew word was transliterated in the 17th century, the ḥet became ch (Chanukah). However, when the English ch appears at the beginning of a word, it sounds quite different than the Hebrew ḥet (compare loch and chair). Thus, in the 18th century another spelling appeared—Hanukkah—even though the h doesn’t really sound like ḥet either. Transliteration issues also arose over the use of other letters—such as one or two k’s—resulting in many spelling variations.",
